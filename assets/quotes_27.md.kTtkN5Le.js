It is known from the holotype UFRGS PV393P, a nearly complete skull. The type species T. eccentricus was named in 2011. Description Restoration Tiarajudens is a member of Anomodontia, a suborder of therapsids. Like other anomodonts, it was a quadrupedal herbivore about the size of a wild boar. NYTimes.com. ‚ÄúFearsome Fangs, for a Plant- Eater.‚Äù Bhando. March 25, 2011. The single fragmented holotype skull is short and robust at about in length. The most prominent features of Tiarajudens are its two large saber-like canine teeth. These teeth are unlike the tusks of dicynodonts, a later group of anomodonts. Twenty-one high-crowned teeth are present on either side of the upper jaw, including spoon-shaped incisors. Wide palatal teeth are also present. The top and bottom sets of teeth fit closely together, much like the teeth of mammals, allowing it to easily chew plants.  History  The type species of Tiarajudens, T. eccentricus, was described in the journal Science in 2011. It was named by Juan Carlos Cisneros, Fernando Abdala, Bruce S. Rubidge, Paula Camboim Dentzien-Dias, and Ana de Oliveira Bueno. The skull was found in the Middle Permian Rio do Rasto Formation in Rio Grande do Sul. Paleontologists found the location using satellite photographs from Google Earth. The locality was identified as a clearing within a thickly vegetated area. The degree of erosion and the color of the rocks were an indication of the locality's age and likelihood of preserving fossils.  Phylogeny  Cladogram after Cisneros et al., 2011: Paleobiology The saber-like teeth of Tiarajudens are unique among anomodonts, a group of entirely herbivorous therapsids. Although large canines are often found in carnivores, the surrounding teeth of Tiarajudens indicate that it was an herbivore. Tiarajudens is one of the earliest herbivores to possess saber-like canines; previously the oldest known saber-toothed herbivores were large extinct mammals such as Titanoides, which lived around 60 million years ago. The teeth are even larger than those of the carnivorous therapsid Inostrancevia, one of the largest members of Gorgonopsia, a group characterized by the presence of long canines. The large canines of Tiarajudens were likely used as a defense against predators or as a means of fighting for mates; living mammals such as the water deer and musk deer use their saber teeth for these purposes. The palatal teeth are broad and fit tightly together, an adaptation to consuming fibrous plants. This variation in tooth shape, known as a heterodont dentition, is common in mammals. While most other Permian therapsids had homodont dentitions (teeth of the same shape), Tiarajudens is one of the earliest therapsids to have a heterodont dentition.

The superconducting slab is initially at H = 0. Increasing H to critical field H* causes the blue curve; dropping H back to 0 and reversing direction to increase it to -H* causes the green curve; dropping H back to 0 again and increase H to H* causes the orange curve. Bean's critical state model, introduced by C. P. Bean in 1962, gives a macroscopic explanation of the irreversible magnetization behavior (hysteresis) of hard Type-II superconductors. Assumptions Hard superconductors often exhibit hysteresis in magnetization measurements. C. P. Bean postulated for the Shubnikov phase an extraordinary shielding process due to the microscopic structure of the materials. He assumed lossless transport with a critical current density Jc(B) (Jc(B‚Üí0) = const. and Jc(B‚Üí‚àû) = 0). An external magnetic field is shielded in the Meissner phase (H < Hc1) in the same way than in a soft superconductor. In the Shubnikov phase (Hc1 < H < Hc2), the critical current flows below the surface within a depth necessary to reduce the field in the inside of the superconductor to Hc1. Explanation of the irreversible magnetization A schematic of the magnetic field distribution in a superconducting cylinder during the change of external magnetic field H, based on Bean's model. To understand the origin of the irreversible magnetization: assume a hollow cylinder in an external magnetic field parallel to the cylinder axis.Supraleitung, W. Buckel and R. Kleiner, Wiley-Verlag, 6. Auflage (2004) In the Meissner phase, a screening current is within the London penetration depth. Exceeding Hc1, vortices start to penetrate into the superconductor. These vortices are pinned on the surface (Bean‚ÄìLivingston barrier). In the area below the surface, which is penetrated by the vortices, is a current with the density Jc. At low fields (H < H0), the vortices do not reach the inner surface of the hollow cylinder and the interior stays field-free. For H > H0, the vortices penetrate the whole cylinder and a magnetic field appears in the interior, which then increases with increasing external field. Let us now consider what happens, if the external field is then decreased: Due to induction, an opposed critical current is generated at the outer surface of the cylinder keeping inside the magnetic field for H0 < H < H1 constant. For H > H1, the opposed critical current penetrates the whole cylinder and the inner magnetic field starts to decrease with decreasing external field. When the external field vanishes, a remnant internal magnetic field occurs (comparable to the remanent magnetization of a ferromagnet). With an opposed external field H0, the internal magnetic field finally reaches 0T (H0 equates the coercive field of a ferromagnet). Extension of Bean‚Äôs model Bean assumed a constant critical current meaning that H << Hc2. Kim et al. extended the model assuming 1/J(H) proportional to H, yielding excellent agreement of theory and measurements on Nb3Sn tubes. Different geometries have to be considered as the irreversible magnetization depends on the sample geometry.Critical Currents in Superconductors, Campbell, A. M., and J. E.

According to Jenner, active absorption takes place in low transpiring and well-watered plants, and 4% of total water absorption is carried out in this process. The active absorption is carried out by two theories; active osmotic water absorption and Active non-osmotic water absorption. In this process, energy is not required. =Active osmotic water absorption= This theory was given by Atkins (1916) and Preistley (1923). According to this theory, the root cells behave as an ideal osmotic pressure system through which water moves up from the soil solution to the root xylem along an increasing gradient of D.P.D. (suction pressure, which is the real force for water absorption). If the solute concentration is high and water potential is low in the root cells, water can enter from soil to root cells through endosmosis. Mineral nutrients are absorbed actively by the root cells due to utilisation of adenosine triphosphate (ATP). As a result, the concentration of ions (osmotica) in the xylem vessels is more in comparison to the soil water. A concentration gradient is established between the root and the soil water. Hence, the solute potential of xylem water is more in comparison to that of soil and correspondingly water potential is low than the soil water. If stated, water potential is comparatively positive in the soil water. This gradient of water potential causes endosmosis. The endosmosis of water continues until the water potential both in the root and soil becomes equal. It is the absorption of minerals that utilise metabolic energy, but not water absorption. Hence, the absorption of water is indirectly an active process in a plant's life. Active transport is in an opposite direction to that of diffusion. =Active non-osmotic water absorption= This theory was given by Thimann (1951) and Kramer (1959). According to the theory, sometimes water is absorbed against a concentration gradient. This requires the expenditure of metabolic energy released from the respiration of root cells. There is no direct evidence, but some scientists suggest the involvement of energy from respiration. In conclusion, it is said that the evidence supporting active absorption of water are themselves poor. Passive absorption of water This mechanism is carried out without utilisation of metabolic energy. Here, only the roots act as an organ of absorption or passage. Hence, sometimes it is called water absorption 'through roots', rather than 'by' roots. It occurs in rapidly transpiring plants during the daytime, because of the opening of stomata and the atmospheric conditions. The force for absorption of water is created at the leaf end i.e. the transpiration pull. The main cause behind this transpiration pull, water is lifted up in the plant axis like a bucket of water is lifted by a person from a well. Transpiration pull is responsible for dragging water at the leaf end, the pull or force is transmitted down to the root through column of water in the xylem elements. The continuity of the water column remains intact due to the cohesion between the molecules and it act as a rope. Roots simply act as a passive organ of absorption. As transpiration proceeds, water absorption occurs simultaneously to compensate the water loss from the leaf end. Most volume of water entering plants is by means of passive absorption. Passive transport is no different from diffusion, it requires no input of energy: there is free movement of molecules from their higher concentration to their lower concentration. The water will enter the plant via the root cells that can be found in the roots where mainly passive absorption occurs. Also, with the absorption of water, minerals and nutrients are also absorbed.

The diffusion pressure deficit in a cell of a leaf is developed because of transpiration then water from the adjacent cell moves towards the cell in the same way diffusion pressure deficit is developed in the second cell and water moves to it from the adjacent cell. This way a continuous diffusion pressure deficit is extended up to root hair and a suction force is developed.

Hung in 2003 to classify instances of data sets. Extension neural network is composed of artificial neural network and extension theory concepts. It uses the fast and adaptive learning capability of neural network and correlation estimation property of extension theory by calculating extension distance. ENN was used in: * Failure detection in machinery. * Tissue classification through MRI. * Fault recognition in automotive engine. * State of charge estimation in lead-acid battery. * Classification with incomplete survey data.  Extension Theory  Extension theory was first proposed by Cai in 1983 to solve contradictory problems. While classical mathematic is familiar with quantity and forms of objects, extension theory transforms these objects to matter-element model. where in matter R, N is the name or type, C is its characteristics and V is the corresponding value for the characteristic. There is a corresponding example in equation 2. where Height and Weight characteristics form extension sets. These extension sets are defined by the V values which are range values for corresponding characteristics. Extension theory concerns with the extension correlation function between matter-element models like shown in equation 2 and extension sets. Extension correlation function is used to define extension space which is composed of pairs of elements and their extension correlation functions. The extension space formula is shown in equation 3. where, A is the extension space, U is the object space, K is the extension correlation function, x is an element from the object space and y is the corresponding extension correlation function output of element x. K(x) maps x to a membership interval \\\\left [ -\\\\infin,\\\\infin \\\\right ] . Negative region represents an element not belonging membership degree to a class and positive region vice versa. If x is mapped to \\\\left [ 0,1 \\\\right ] , extension theory acts like fuzzy set theory. The correlation function can be shown with the equation 4. where, X_{in} and X_{out} are called concerned and neighborhood domain and their intervals are (a,b) and (c,d) respectively. The extended correlation function used for estimation of membership degree between x and X_{in}, X_{out} is shown in equation 5. \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\frac{\\\\rho(x,X_{in})}{\\\\rho(x,X_{out})-\\\\rho(x,X_{in})} &x; ot \\\\in{X_{in}} \\\\end{cases} }} alt=Extension Correlation Function  Extension Neural Network  Extension neural network has a neural network like appearance. Weight vector resides between the input nodes and output nodes. Output nodes are the representation of input nodes by passing them through the weight vector. There are total number of input and output nodes are represented by n and n_c, respectively. These numbers depend on the number of characteristics and classes. Rather than using one weight value between two layer nodes as in neural network, extension neural network architecture has two weight values. In extension neural network architecture, for instance i, x^p_{ij} is the input which belongs to class p and o_{ik} is the corresponding output for class k. The output o_{ik} is calculated by using extension distance as shown in equation 6. {\\\\frac{w_{kj}^U-w_{kj}^L}{2}}+1 \\\\right) k=1,2,....,n_c }} Estimated class is found through searching for the minimum extension distance among the calculated extension distance for all classes as summarized in equation 7, where k^* is the estimated class. = Learning Algorithm = Each class is composed of ranges of characteristics. These characteristics are the input types or names which come from matter-element model. Weight values in extension neural network represent these ranges. In the learning algorithm, first weights are initialized by searching for the maximum and minimum values of inputs for each class as shown in equation 8 where, i is the instance number and j is represents number of input. This initialization provides classes' ranges according to given training data. After maintaining weights, center of clusters are found through the equation 9. Before learning process begins, predefined learning performance rate is given as shown in equation 10 where, N_m is the misclassified instances and N_p is the total number of instances. Initialized parameters are used to classify instances with using equation 6. If the initialization is not sufficient due to the learning performance rate, training is required. In the training step weights are adjusted to classify training data more accurately, therefore reducing learning performance rate is aimed. In each iteration, E_\\\\tau is checked to control if required learning performance is reached. In each iteration every training instance is used for training. Instance i, belongs to class p is shown by: X_{i}^p=\\\\\\\\{x_{i1}^p,x_{i2}^p,...,x_{in}^p\\\\\\\\} 1\\\\leq p\\\\leq n_c Every input data point of X_i^p is used in extension distance calculation to estimate the class of X_i^p. If the estimated class k^*=p then update is not needed. Whereas, if k^* eq p then update is done. In update case, separators which show the relationship between inputs and classes, are shifted proportional to the distance between the center of clusters and the data points. The update formula: z_{pj}^{new} = z_{pj}^{old} + \\\\eta (x_{ij}^p-z_{pj}^{old}) z_{k^*j}^{new} = z_{k^*j}^{old} - \\\\eta (x_{ij}^p-z_{k^*j}^{old}) w_{pj}^{L(new)} = w_{pj}^{L(old)} + \\\\eta (x_{ij}^p-z_{pj}^{old}) w_{pj}^{U(new)} = w_{pj}^{U(old)} + \\\\eta (x_{ij}^p-z_{pj}^{old}) w_{k^*j}^{L(new)} = w_{k^*j}^{L(old)} - \\\\eta (x_{ij}^p-z_{k^*j}^{old}) w_{k^*j}^{U(new)} = w_{k^*j}^{U(old)} - \\\\eta (x_{ij}^p-z_{k^*j}^{old}) To classify the instance i accurately, separator of class p for input j moves close to data-point of instance i, whereas separator of class k^* for input j moves far away. In the above image, an update example is given. Assume that instance i belongs to class A, whereas it is classified to class B because extension distance calculation gives out ED_A>ED_B. After the update, separator of class A moves close to the data-point of instance i whereas separator of class B moves far away. Consequently, extension distance gives out ED_B>ED_A, therefore after update instance i is classified to class A.  References  # # Kuei-Hsiang Chao, Meng-Hui Wang, and Chia-Chang Hsu.

He was born in Johnstown, Pennsylvania.Baseball Reference Bullpen entry Born to immigrants from Slovenia who settled in Johnstown, Dezelan served in the United States Navy during the Korean War. He played baseball during military service, and on the sandlots of Cambria County. He spent thirteen years umpiring in baseball before ending his career due a brain tumor.Legacy.com ‚Äì Obituary His umpiring career was launched in a dentist's chair, according to his family. While being treated by his dentist, Richard Goldberg, Frank discussed his love of baseball, and Goldberg suggested that he become an umpire. Dezelan decided to heed the advice and was accepted into the Al Somers Academy of Professional Umpiring in Daytona Beach, Florida. After graduating in 1958, Dezelan began his umpiring career in the Northern League that year and returned for the 1959 season. According to a story told by former and longtime major league umpire Bruce Froemming, Dezelan and his crew were scheduled to work a minor league doubleheader in which future Hall of Famer Earl Weaver was managing. Notorious for mixing it up with umpires, Weaver got into a pregame argument over some tree limbs that jutted into fair territory. Dezelan ejected the argumentative Weaver before the game even began. Dezelan moved up to the South Atlantic League in 1960 and 1961 and to the Pacific Coast League from 1962 to 1963. He then worked in the Southern League in 1964 and 1965 and in the International League from 1966 through 1968. In addition, he would be an umpire in the National League for the last weeks of the season from 1966 to 1968, then full-time from 1969 to 1970. When the National League umpires began wearing numbers in 1970, Dezelan was assigned number 6. During his career, Dezelan worked some Major League milestones involving some of its biggest star players. He was behind home plate when Willie Mays hit his 600th career home run in 1969. He was part of the umpiring crew at the 1970 All-Star Game that ended with Pete Rose colliding with catcher Ray Fosse at home plate, and also worked the inaugural game at Three Rivers Stadium during the 1970 season.MLB.com ‚Äì Former umpire Dezelan dies In 1971 Dezelan had surgery to remove a brain tumor, which ended his career when he was 42. He survived six brain operations over the next four decades. According to his son Daryl, Dezelan loved to work games with pitchers Sandy Koufax and Bob Gibson, because they worked so efficiently, and with outfielder Roberto Clemente because he never argued over calls, but just held his head high and played the game. Additionally, he worked with many of the most notable players and coaches in Major League history, including Sparky Anderson, Carl Yastrzemski and Willie Stargell, amongst others. Irene Dezelan, his wife of 52 years, noted that her husband made it to the big leagues when there were more U.S. senators than major league umpires. The couple raised five children, three daughters and two sons, in the Pittsburgh area. Frank Dezelan died in Monroeville, Pennsylvania, at the age of 81.

Although not exclusively limited to the 1950s period, the literature tends to suggest that this decade was a particularly fruitful time for CNS drug discovery and it has been referred to as a \\"golden era\\". Chlorpromazine The history of chlorpromazine can be traced back to the work of BASF who were creating dyes at around the turn of the 20th century (c.f. methylene blue). It was found that attaching basic side chains to the tricyclic phenothiazine residue resulted in compounds that functioned as reliable antihistamines. Henri Laborit was first using chlorpromazine to treat the anxiety of patients prior to surgery. He noted the so-called \\"indifference\\" that this agent causes and suggested that it be used on agitated psychotic patients. Chlorpromazine has H1, M1, and Œ±1 receptor antagonist activity. This causes sedation, anticholinergic effects, as well as orthostatic hypotension. It also functions as a blocker of D2 receptors, although it is much weaker and less selective than haloperidol in this respect. Blockade of the D2 receptors is thought to underlie the antipsychotic effect of the typical antipsychotics. However, in the case of atypicals such as clozapine and risperidone, blockade of 5HT2A receptors are thought to also account for an important part of their pharmacology. Minor chemical manipulations in the chemical structure of chlorpromazine was used to create novel antipsychotic agents such as thioridazine and fluoperazine. Imipramine Minor chemical manipulations in the structure of chlorpromazine led to the first tricyclic antidepressant (TCA), imipramine (Tofranil), whose structure is iminodibenzyl (dibenzazepine) based. Imipramine was first used on agitated psychotic patients, but it was shown that in the majority of cases their condition did not improve and actually worsened slightly. However, it was noted that a few of the patients who were depressed became more animated so its use in the treatment of depression became apparent. Due to the chemical similarity of imipramine to chlorpromazine, this agent also functions as a H1, M1, and Œ±1 receptor antagonist. Imipramine is also known to function as a fast sodium channel blocker, which is said to account for the cardiotoxicity of this agent. The collective effect of imipramine on these receptors is not thought to contribute to its therapeutic activity in the treatment of depression, although it is believed to account for mostly all of its side effects. The usefulness of the TCAs in treating depression is thought to stem from their ability to inhibit the uptake of the neurotransmitters serotonin (5-HT) and noradrenaline (NA). It was proposed that designing agents that were more selective for 5-HT and/or NA would lower the incidence of side effects. This in turn has led to the development/discovery of the SSRIs and SNRIs. Iproniazid The so-called golden era also covers the discovery of the first monoamine oxidase inhibitor, iproniazid (Marsilid), which is hydrazine based. Like imipramine, this also was used in the treatment of depression. Iproniazid was the result of a failed medicinal chemistry attempt to improve on the anti- tubercular activity of isoniazid. It was first given to patients suffering from tuberculosis where a surprising but wholly unexpected improvement in mood was noticed. Nathan Kline coined the term \\"psychic energizer\\" to account for this effect and posited that they be used in the treatment of depression. Iproniazid is no longer used because it caused an unacceptable incidence in jaundice. Nevertheless related agents such as phenelzine and isocarboxazid are still on the market. In addition, tranylcypromine is a non-hydrazine containing irreversible inhibitor of MAO which is also available. A limitation of these agents is their potential to cause hypertension so their safety is not guaranteed. However, it seems that the selective inhibitor of the B isoform of MAO, selegiline, is much less likely to cause hypertension. Theory of mood disorders The investigations into the mechanism of activity of these agents that followed their discovery led to the proposal of the \\"chemical imbalance\\" of neurotransmitters theory of mood disorders, which is supposed to account for the pathophysiology and/or pathogenesis of these states. It follows that these so-called \\"imbalances\\" can be corrected by the judicious application of appropriately selected psychotropic medication(s). An excess of dopamine is cited as the cause of schizophrenia, whereas a deficiency of noradrenaline and serotonin were cited as the cause for depression. The discovery of reserpine was also of great significance to the development of the monoamine amine theory of depression. Prior to the 1950s Prior to the introduction of these agents, the management of mental disorders in America relied mainly on \\"psychoanalytic\\" methods said to be deriving from a \\"Freudian\\" understanding of the subject area. Apparently, there was great resistance to the use of medicine in the treatment of mental disorders prior to the 1950s. It is, however, known that various other agents including amphetamine and opium have documented use in the history of treating depression, and that barbiturates, lithium salts, bromide salts, various anticholinergic alkaloids, as well as opium, were all used in the history of the treatment of schizophrenia.

It is a rare plant known from about 34 populations in the US states of Arkansas, Louisiana, Missouri, and Texas. There are a number of threats to its survival and it was listed as a threatened species of the United States in 1987. Most of the populations are located in Missouri, with a few more in Arkansas and Louisiana. It was discovered in Anderson County, Texas, in 2004.Geocarpon minimum. Texas Parks and Wildlife. The plant was probably widespread on the North American continent long ago, but the climate changed, and it now exists as a relict species in a narrow strip of hospitable habitat. It grows on sandstone glades and outcrops as well as bare, sparsely vegetated areas where the soil contains relatively large amounts of magnesium and sodium salts. It can be found on \\"slicks\\" with a coating of lichens and Nostoc cyanobacteria that are very wet after winter rain and then dry into a hard crust. Lichens of genus Xanthoparmelia occur on the slicks.Geocarpon minimum. Center for Plant Conservation. Few flowering plants grow in this harsh habitat. It is an ephemeral species, sprouting up and generally undergoing its full life cycle within four weeks around February and March, or as late as June in some areas. The yearly abundance of this tiny annual plant in a particular area depends on the amount of recent rainfall there; populations are small or nonexistent in dry years and can contain thousands of plants in a wet season. Geocarpon minimum is a petite succulent plant measuring no more than 4 centimeters (1.6 inches) tall with a hair-thin stem. The plant is grayish, brownish, or green when new and then turns magenta, red, bright pink, or purplish as it matures. The red color is from anthocyanins.Geocarpon minimum. The Nature Conservancy. It has tiny leaves 3 or 4 millimeters long and a red or purplish inflorescence containing one flower no more than 4 millimeters long.Geocarpon minimum. Flora of North America.Mackenzie, Kenneth Kent 1914. Torreya 14(4): 67‚Äì68 Geocarpon minimum requires a specific type of habitat. The slicks and saline prairies it inhabits have become uncommon as the soil has changed. As the substrate has become more suitable for other types of flowering plants, the tinytim is easily outcompeted. What causes this change in the soils is not clear. They probably require some sort of disturbance, such as fire, to stay bare, eroded, and salty. However, too much disturbance can destroy this type of habitat. For example, cattle grazing tends to alter the soil in such a way that plants can take hold, turning bare patches to prairie, but there is also evidence that intensive grazing can keep larger plants down and allow the tinytim to spring up. Off-road vehicles have been noted to destroy habitat, but the type of disturbance they create may also be helpful in keeping the soil barren. More research may help clarify the ecological relationships of the plant. Although the tinytim is still quite limited in range and minor threats still exist, it has a \\"high recovery potential\\" and is almost ready to be removed from the endangered species list. Since it was listed, more populations have been discovered and a few have been planted in appropriate habitat. However, the populations require more monitoring to make sure they can survive and research should be done to establish the genetic variability of the species across its range. There has been some disagreement over which family this genus should be assigned to. Mackenzie in his initial description placed it in the Aizoaceae but most present-day taxonomists regard it as part of the Caryophyllaceae.Bogle, A. L., T. Swain, R. D. Thomas, and E. D. Kohn. 1971.

The Boschpoort gate and the outlying defense works were demolished in the 1860s when Maastricht ceased to be a fortress town. The Boschpoort neighbourhood was built slightly North of the old city gate in the early twentieth century. It was largely a working class neighbourhood, being close to the Sphinx potteries, the paper factory and other industries around the Bassin inner harbour and the Zuid-Willemsvaart canal. After the Second World War some new areas were added. Recent history Populationwise, the area has been in decline for several decades. The Roman Catholic church of Saint Hubert, an imposing expressionist building dating from the 1920s, was sold in 2009 after having stood empty for several years and has been converted into a fitness centre. The local primary school was closed in 2010 after an intense and emotional fight by locals and parents to keep it open.de Blickopener It is hoped that the neighbourhood will benefit from plans for regeneration of the industrial North Western part of Maastricht (Belv√©d√®re Project).

Born in the Riverina district of New South Wales, he was a farmer and a member of the Militia before joining the RAAF in 1940. After training in Australia and Canada, he was posted to Britain in 1941 to take part in the air war over Europe. Brill first saw combat with No. 460 Squadron RAAF, flying Vickers Wellington medium bombers. He was awarded the Distinguished Flying Cross (DFC) in May 1942 for attacking a target after his plane was badly damaged by anti- aircraft fire. Following assignment as an instructor with the Royal Air Force (RAF), he returned to the bombing campaign in January 1944 as a flight commander with No. 463 Squadron RAAF, flying Avro Lancaster heavy bombers. Brill's leadership and determination to complete his missions despite damage to his aircraft‚Äîon one occasion inflicted by another Lancaster's bombs from above‚Äîearned him the Distinguished Service Order. Promoted to wing commander in May 1944, he took over No. 467 Squadron RAAF after the death in combat of its then-commander, Group Captain John Balmer. Brill was awarded a bar to his DFC in July, for his skill in evading three German night fighters. Returning to Australia, he remained in the Air Force after the war and led No. 10 Squadron in 1949‚Äì50. He went on to command air bases at Rathmines, Canberra and Townsville during the 1950s and 1960s. Brill served two terms as RAAF Director of Personnel Services, in 1956‚Äì59 and 1960‚Äì63, by which time he had been promoted to group captain. His final posting was at the Department of Air in Canberra. He died of a heart attack in October 1964. Early life Brill was born on 17 May 1916 in the Riverina town of Ganmain, New South Wales. He was the fourth of seven children of farmer Edward Brill and his wife Bertha, who were originally from Victoria. The Brills owned a property called \\"Clearview\\", and Bill attended the local school. He completed his education at Yanco Agricultural High, gaining his Intermediate Certificate before joining his brothers in wheat farming.Nelson, \\"From Wagga to Waddington\\", pp. 3‚Äì6 Thickly set and physically strong, he was a keen Australian rules footballer, playing for Ganmain, Grong Grong, and Matong. On 5 January 1939, Brill enlisted in the 21st Light Horse Regiment, a Militia unit, at Narrandera. He was promoted to corporal in May. The previous month he had been tested as a potential air cadet, the interview panel finding him a \\"quiet country chap\\" who was \\"rather slow\\" but \\"intelligent\\".Nelson, \\"From Wagga to Waddington\\", pp. 6‚Äì7 On 11 November 1940, Brill transferred to the RAAF active reserve, known as the Citizen Air Force (CAF).Coulthard-Clark, The Third Brother, pp. 225‚Äì226 He went through the Empire Air Training Scheme (EATS), undergoing initial instruction at RAAF Bradfield Park in Sydney. Selected to be a pilot, he received his elementary flying training on De Havilland Tiger Moths at RAAF Station Narrandera. In March 1941, Brill was posted to Canada for advanced instruction on Avro Ansons at No. 3 Service Flying Training School, Calgary. He was commissioned as a pilot officer on 28 July 1941, and sailed to Britain the next month. In October he began converting to Vickers Wellington medium bombers at No. 27 Operational Training Unit, Lichfield, and was assigned to No. 460 Squadron RAAF,Nelson, \\"From Wagga to Waddington\\", pp. 16‚Äì17. which formed at RAF Molesworth the following month. Air war in Europe=First tour of operations= Raised under the Article XV provisions of EATS, No. 460 Squadron was one of several nominally Australian formations taking part in RAF Bomber Command's strategic air campaign against Germany.Herington, Air War Against Germany and Italy, p. 649 RAAF Historical Section, Bomber Units, pp. 118‚Äì123 In January 1942, the unit moved from Molesworth to RAF Breighton, Yorkshire. Brill flew as a co-pilot in No. 460 Squadron's first operation, against the German port of Emden in March.Nelson, \\"From Wagga to Waddington\\", pp. 20‚Äì24 He was soon in command of his own Wellington, attacking targets in northern France. On 5 April 1942, he undertook his first sortie against a well-defended city deep in enemy territory, Cologne. He later recorded his apprehension before the raid: alt=Informal half portrait of two men in dark military uniforms, with peaked caps On the night of 29/30 May 1942, Brill's was one of 27 aircraft detailed to bomb the Gnome et Rh√¥ne, Thomson Houston, and Goodrich factories in the Paris suburb of Gennevilliers. The crews were required to have good visibility of the target area before bombing, to ensure accuracy and reduce civilian casualties. Due to foul weather over the Channel, Brill flew at an altitude of less than until crossing the French coast. The clouds had begun to clear over Paris and searchlights swept the sky, accompanied by heavy anti-aircraft fire. Most of the bombers released their loads from between , but Brill dropped to before making his attack. With the bomb bay doors open, his Wellington was struck by flak, damaging the hydraulics and rear gun turret, and leaving one of the bombs hanging after the others dropped on target. Returning to England through more bad weather, he spotted an emergency landing ground and brought the crippled Wellington down with the bomb doors still open and one tyre flat; the plane was later scrapped. Brill's was the only one of four Wellingtons from No. 460 Squadron to find the target area and successfully attack.Nelson, \\"From Wagga to Waddington\\", pp. 26‚Äì27Herington, Air War Against Germany and Italy, pp. 309‚Äì310 For his \\"splendid courage and determination\\" in pressing home the assault, he was awarded the Distinguished Flying Cross on 26 June, the first pilot in his squadron to be decorated. No. 460 Squadron participated in 1,000-bomber raids against Cologne, Essen and Bremen in May and June 1942. Brill was promoted to acting flight lieutenant in July, and completed his first tour of operations, numbering 31 sorties, on 11 August.Nelson, \\"From Wagga to Waddington\\", pp. 27‚Äì30 He was seconded to the RAF as an instructor in November 1942, returning to No. 27 Operational Training Unit at Lichfield. He spent the next eleven months there, leading a training flight and gaining promotion to acting squadron leader in April 1943. In August, he was best man at the wedding of his friend and fellow RAAF pilot, Arthur Doubleday. The press would come to refer to the pair as the \\"Flying Twins\\", as their wartime careers closely paralleled one another‚Äîboth men came from the Riverina district, joined the Air Force together on Remembrance Day 1940, arrived in England in August 1941, flew Wellingtons in No. 460 Squadron, volunteered for second tours in Bomber Command, and received many decorations and promotions in tandem. Doubleday would go on to survive the war and become active in civil aviation.Nelson, \\"From Wagga to Waddington\\", pp. 52‚Äì53 =Second tour of operations= alt=Four-engined, twin-finned military aircraft taking off Having volunteered for his second tour, Brill underwent conversion to Handley Page Halifax and Avro Lancaster heavy bombers in the last months of 1943. In the new year, he was appointed a flight commander in No. 463 Squadron RAAF, operating Lancasters out of RAF Waddington, Lincolnshire. Waddington was also home to another Australian squadron, No. 467, and Brill took an active part in the station's raucous mess life.Nelson, \\"From Wagga to Waddington\\", pp. 31‚Äì32 His younger brother Vic, who had joined the RAAF in 1941, was in the same squadron. Brill returned to combat in the middle of the Battle of Berlin, flying his first sortie to the \\"Big City\\" on 20 January 1944.Nelson, \\"From Wagga to Waddington\\", pp. 33‚Äì36 The statistical likelihood of surviving an operational tour of 30 missions in Bomber Command was never more than 50%, but loss rates during the Battle of Berlin were far higher.Stephens, The Royal Australian Air Force, pp. 95‚Äì96 Brill took off for his second mission to Berlin on 27 January. The Lancaster he flew was said to be jinxed, possessed of an engine that lost power in the air but always tested well on the ground, and suffering oxygen failure that killed its rear gunner on the previous sortie. One of the engines did begin to falter before Brill reached Berlin, forcing him to fly lower than normal. Having released his bombs over target, he felt the plane take several strikes that he assumed were anti-aircraft fire, but were in fact the incendiaries of a Lancaster flying above. His aircraft's nose, rudder controls, and electricals were all severely damaged, and the port wing was on fire. Having warned his crew to prepare to bail out, Brill dived the Lancaster and succeeded in putting out the flames. The crew was able to remain on board and, after a nine-hour flight, the plane landed back at Waddington. Brill's verdict on the mission was, as he later wrote, \\"not my idea of an evening's entertainment\\".Herington, Air War Against Germany and Italy, p. 645 He flew a total of eleven operations during the Battle of Berlin, including Bomber Command's costliest raid of the war, against Nuremberg in March. On that occasion, one of his engines failed and another was damaged when he had to fly through a cloud of debris from a Lancaster that was blown to pieces directly in his path. alt=Half portrait of man in dark military uniform with peaked cap By April 1944, No. 463 Squadron had begun to concentrate on targets in France and Belgium as the Allied air campaign shifted focus from strategic bombing to destroying airfields and disrupting lines of communication prior to the invasion of the continent.Nelson, \\"From Wagga to Waddington\\", pp. 37‚Äì38RAAF Historical Section, Bomber Units, pp. 130‚Äì133 On 8 May, Brill was the bombing controller for a raid on an airfield near Brest. The controller was required to arrive ahead of the main Allied force, check that flares marking the target were in place, and warn his fellows if they were bombing inaccurately. By the time Brill had completed this task and gone in himself to attack, the ground defences were fully alert and peppered his Lancaster with 140 bullet holes, but he refused to take evasive action until he had delivered his bombload.Herington, Air Power Over Europe, pp. 13‚Äì21 Promoted to acting wing commander, Brill assumed control of No. 467 Squadron on 12 May, following the death in combat of its previous commanding officer, Group Captain John Balmer.RAAF Historical Section, Bomber Units, pp. 144‚Äì147 According to the official history of the RAAF in World War II, Brill \\"proved a very worthy successor to Balmer both in administration and in the dashing type of leadership which had brought the Waddington squadrons to the fore in No. 5 Group\\".Herington, Air Power Over Europe, p. 38 He was awarded the Distinguished Service Order on 19 May for \\"leadership, skill and gallantry of the highest order\\" and \\"his determination to make every sortie a success\\" in spite of frequent damage to his aircraft. Early the next month he led No. 467 Squadron in raids on Axis radar stations in northern France.Herington, Air Power Over Europe, pp. 34‚Äì35 The unit was in action on D-Day over Pointe du Hoc and, later, clearing a corridor for Allied troops advancing up the Cherbourg peninsula. On the night of 4/5 July, Nos. 463 and 467 Squadrons bombed supply depots for V-weapons near Saint-Leu-d'Esserent. Brill's Lancaster was attacked by three German night fighters, but he was able to evade them with only a few bullets striking his plane.Herington, Air Power Over Europe, pp. 180‚Äì181 His \\"fine leadership and courage\\" during the action earned him a bar to his DFC; the award was promulgated in The London Gazette on 16 January 1945. Brill completed his second tour of operations later in July but stayed on to fly more missions, often mentoring less experienced crews. By now he had earned a reputation for being quite \\"mad\\", as he would often circle back and check over his handiwork after a bombing run, rather than making his escape from the target area as quickly as possible.Nelson, \\"From Wagga to Waddington\\", pp. 38‚Äì42 During non-operational periods, he made a habit of taking a Lancaster on a so-called test flight to the southern border of Northern Ireland, where he and his crew would change into civilian clothes, cross into Ireland and stock up on food and liquor for a party back at Waddington; he always made a point of inviting the Air Officer Commanding RAAF Overseas Headquarters, Air Vice Marshal Henry Wrigley, to such events, which Wrigley attended without fail.Brown, Skylarks, p. 70 Brill handed over command of No. 467 Squadron on 12 October 1944, becoming the first man to survive his time as its leader. He had flown a total of 58 missions in Bomber Command when he returned to Australia in the new year. On 29 January 1945 he married Ilma Kitto, a teacher, at Ganmain's Methodist Church. The couple had been engaged since before the war; they later had two sons and a daughter.Nelson, \\"From Wagga to Waddington\\", pp. 4, 16 Post-war career alt=Four-engined military aircraft with twin tail fins in flight Brill remained in the Air Force following the end of hostilities. From February 1946 to August 1947 he served as the first and only commanding officer of the RAAF's newly formed and soon-disbanded Heavy Bomber Crew Conversion Unit at RAAF Station East Sale, Victoria. Little support or direction on its use as a training facility was forthcoming from higher command, and in the summer months its Avro Lincoln bombers were employed in bushfire patrols over East Gippsland, reporting 44 outbreaks in February 1947 alone.RAAF Historical Section, Training Units, pp. 152‚Äì153 Brill transferred from the CAF to the Permanent Air Force in 1948, and reverted to the rank of squadron leader. In March 1949 he became the inaugural commanding officer of a re-formed No. 10 (General Reconnaissance) Squadron, which had been disbanded in 1945 after service throughout World War II. In its new guise the squadron was established from the staff and facilities of RAAF Station Garbutt in Townsville. Brill's main tasks were organising to absorb or close surplus wartime facilities in North Queensland, and preparing No. 10 Squadron for search-and-rescue operations. The unit took delivery of its first four Lincoln Mk 30s in September 1949, and Brill handed over command the following January.RAAF Historical Section, Maritime Units, pp. 8‚Äì16 Raised to substantive wing commander, Brill served as a director at RAAF Staff College in Point Cook, Victoria, until his appointment as Staff Officer to the Chief of the Air Staff, Air Marshal Sir Donald Hardman, in March 1952. He was posted to command the Officer Training School (OTS) at RAAF Base Rathmines, New South Wales, in December 1953. In this role he was also the commanding officer of the base.RAAF Historical Section, Training Units, pp. 161‚Äì162 His title changed in May 1956 as Rathmines and OTS were reorganised under the newly established RAAF School of Ground Training, with Brill taking charge of the school until July.RAAF Historical Section, Training Units, p. 194 Considered an empathetic leader, he then became Director of Personnel Services. Promoted to group captain, Brill served throughout 1959 as commanding officer of RAAF Base Canberra before again being appointed Director of Personnel Services.RAAF Historical Section, Introduction, Bases, Supporting Organisations, pp. 138‚Äì140 Active in local charities and youth organisations, he became a Freemason and in the early 1960s was assistant commissioner for the Canberra‚ÄìMonaro Boy Scouts. In January 1964 he assumed command of RAAF Base Townsville, returning to Canberra that October for assignment to the Department of Air.RAAF Historical Section, Introduction, Bases, Supporting Organisations, pp. 160‚Äì163 He died of a heart attack at his home in Campbell on 12 October. Survived by his wife and children, Brill was buried in Canberra. He is commemorated by Brill Place, in Gowrie.

The shrub is of interest to the botanist because of its unique (within the genus) resting buds and the different types of inflorescence produced through the year. Description B. delavayi spring inflorescence Buddleja delavayi is a deciduous shrub or small tree growing 2 - 6 m high by up to 3 m wide. The young branches and shoots are rounded, bearing elliptic leaves 1.5 - 6 cm long, usually with short < 4 mm petioles, the margins either serrate or entire. The heavily honey-scented flowers, which appear in April and occasionally again in September, are rose-lilac with an orange eye, borne in lax, terminal and axillary panicles. The inflorescences produced in spring are small, 4 - 12 cm long, whereas those produced in autumn are more than twice the length, at 20 - 25 cm. The individual flowers are relatively large, the corollas 8 mm wide by 10 mm long, and a deep salmon - rose in colour. The buds of the spring flowers are formed in autumn, and protected from frost by small dry brown scales resembling those of the Cherry, and are unique within the genus.

It is recorded in the National Heritage List for England as a designated Grade II* listed building, and is under the care of the Churches Conservation Trust. The church is situated some southeast of Stockbridge, to the east of the A3057 road. History All Saints has its origin in the Anglo-Saxon era, and it is recorded in the Domesday book. The original church had a nave and a chancel, but in 1170 the chancel was removed, the nave was extended towards the east, and a very small chancel was added at the east end. The chancel was removed during the 17th century, the chancel arch was filled in with a wall and a window was inserted. Architecture The church is constructed in flint rubble with stone dressings. The walls have been rendered and colourwashed. The roof is tiled. Its plan is simple, consisting of a nave and a chancel in a single range, with a weatherboarded bellcote at the west end. At the east end, within the former chancel arch, is a three-light square-headed window, and above this are two lancet windows. In the north wall of the chancel is a 12th-century single-light window. To the west of this is a blocked door dating from the same period. Also in the north wall is a Anglo-Saxon pilaster strip made in Binstead stone from the Isle of Wight. In the south wall of the chancel is a 13th-century lancet window. To the west of this are two single-light square-headed windows. Between these is a Norman round-headed doorway. The west window dates from the 14th century and has two lights with trefoil heads, and there is a quatrefoil window above it. The plaster has been stripped from the interior of the walls, and the floor has been partly removed and replaced by flags. To the south of the chancel arch is a small round-headed niche. The font dates from the 19th century. External features In the churchyard is the grave of Thomas Sopwith, the pioneer aviator, who developed the Sopwith Camel, and died in 1989.

The group supports the Marketplace Fairness Act (S.1832;112th Congress). Members include retailers such as Wal-Mart, Target, Best Buy, Home Depot, Sears, and thousands of small retailers. Mission The Alliance for Main Street Fairness says it \\"is a coalition of business owners and concerned citizens who want to bring sales tax laws up-to-date and level the playing field so all businesses can compete fairly.\\" They argue, \\"Current law dates from an era before people shopped online. A loophole in this law allows online-only retailers to avoid collecting sales taxes at the point of sale, unlike brick- and-mortar retailers. This gives online-only retailers an unfair advantage over their Main Street competitors, which costs local communities jobs and tax revenue and creates significant unfairness in the marketplace for businesses and consumers alike.\\" Issues=Alibaba= The Alliance for Main Street Fairness purchased radio and television ads in December 2014 calling for Congress to end what the group called \\"special tax treatment\\" for Alibaba and other e-commerce sites. This was one of the largest public relations campaigns ever conduct against a Chinese company in the United States. =Amazon= AMSF criticized Amazon's Price Check app and Price Check Day promotion. The AMSF stated, \\"This app is simply another ploy by Amazon to exploit the loophole that allows them to evade collecting state sales taxes.‚Äù AMSF also stated, \\"no retailer can compete with the special treatment\\" Amazon receives by not being required to collect sales taxes. =Borders Books= In a statement on the bankruptcy and liquidation of Borders Books AMSF wrote, \\"Special treatment for Amazon.com is decimating job providers like Borders and countless small businesses across the country. It is simply not fair that one business is able to operate with a government-sanctioned advantage that allows it to undercut its competitors forcing lost jobs and business closures. Lawmakers need to level the playing field and end the special deal that gives Amazon a competitive advantage over Main Street.‚Äù =Marketplace Fairness Act= After eBay implicitly endorsed an exemption for businesses with $30 million or less in annual sales, AMSF attacked the online auctioneer. saying that it was only trying to protect the largest firms selling from its site. AMSF released a video in late 2014 in support of the Marketplace Fairness Act. The video showcased testimonials from conservative groups and intellectuals supporting \\"e-fairness.\\" The video includes a brief statement from economist Art Laffer. Laffer released a study touting the benefits of treating online and offline commerce equally. He said that the Marketplace Fairness Act would give states the ability to reduce other taxes. AMSF criticized Senator Ted Cruz in a BuzzFeed post for his opposition to the Marketplace Fairness Act. AMSF claimed that Cruz had \\"flip-flopped\\" on his conservative principles by supporting special tax treatment for online retailers. ‚ÄúWhile Ted Cruz gallivants across the country giving speeches on the American dream,‚Äù the post reads, ‚Äúhe denies it to the local small business owners back home.‚Äù In its post AMSF also stated, \\"Ted Cruz works to tilt the free market in favor of big online retailers LIKE ALIBABA...\\" State legislation=Illinois= Following the March 2011 signature of Illinois' Main Street Fairness Act into law by Governor Pat Quinn, the Alliance issued a press release stating that \\"In Illinois, small business retailers are the backbone of the state's economy and are vital components of the community, and they have been operating at a significant disadvantage as online-only retailers have exploited a decades-old loophole to gain an unfair and artificial advantage in the marketplace. By signing HB 3659, Quinn ensures that all businesses will compete on the same playing field, collecting the sales tax at the point of purchase whether they operate on the Internet or in Illinois' communities.\\" Quinn said, \\"This law will put Illinois-based businesses on a level playing field, protect and create jobs and help us continue to grow in the global marketplace.\\" =Pennsylvania= In May 2011 the Alliance announced its intention to hand deliver a petition to each state legislator in order to encourage them to support legislation mandating sales taxes for online retailers. In June 2011 the Alliance launched an ad campaign in Pennsylvania featuring television, radio, and newspaper ads across the state. In December 2011 Pennsylvania changed its rules regarding what constitutes a physical nexus within the state to require more businesses to collect and remit sales tax. Pennsylvania has also added a line on its 2011 income tax form for taxpayers to report online purchases and pay use tax. In February 2012 the Pennsylvania state government predicted that it would collect an additional $40 million in sales tax from internet retailers. Out-of-state online retailers, such as Amazon.com, were granted a one-time reprieve until September 2012 after which they could face enforcement action. The Alliance for Main Street Fairness praised all of these actions. =South Carolina= In May 2011, in response to Amazon agreeing to notify South Carolina customers by email that sales tax was owed on their purchases but that shoppers would still be responsible for paying the tax by themselves, the Alliance called the vote ‚Äújust one step in the process,\\" but \\"unfortunate that the majority of the House favors special deals for one prospective retailer at the expense of [the] state‚Äôs existing employers and their 375,000 employees.\\" The Alliance expressed disapproval of the South Carolina Senate's approval of this arrangement and called on Governor Nikki Haley to veto the legislation stating that, ‚Äúthis special exemption only passed after backroom deals and last-minute promises were made by Amazon officials ‚Äì something which should disappoint everyone interested in transparency and good government.\\" =Tennessee= In March 2011 the Alliance ran advertisements opposing the efforts of Tennessee officials, including Gov. Bill Haslam, to finalize an agreement with Amazon.com that would exempt the company from collecting sales taxes in exchange for opening two distribution centers in the state. ‚ÄúWhy would the state let Amazon get away with not collecting and paying the biggest source of revenue in Tennessee: its sales tax?‚Äù one ad said. In May 2011 the Alliance responded to testimony given to the state Senate Finance Committee by Amazon officials regarding their arrangement with the Department of Revenue for an exemption from collecting Tennessee sales taxes saying that ‚ÄúSecret, backroom deals would hurt Main Street jobs and give an out-of-state company a competitive advantage over mom- and-pop shops across our state.‚Äù In June 2011, state attorney general Roy Cooper affirmed the constitutionality of a proposed bill in the state legislature that building distribution centers in a state creates a physical presence or nexus sufficient to force retailers like Amazon to collect sales tax on goods it ships to Tennessee residents. The Alliance for Main Street Fairness called the attorney general‚Äôs opinion ‚Äúencouraging news for the thousands of Tennessee small business owners who don‚Äôt want our elected officials to give Amazon special treatment.‚Äù =Texas= In May 2011 despite Governor Rick Perry's veto of House Bill 2403, which would have taxed online sales in the same manner as sales made by traditional retailers. the Alliance for Main Street Fairness expressed confidence that bill would eventually pass in some form. State Senators Duncan and Shapiro amended Senate Bill 1811, a fiscal bill intended to fund education and balance the state budget, to insert the same language and the Alliance, calling for its passage, cited a study by Angelos Angelou that estimated that Texas loses $774 million in tax revenue due to the failure of online retailers to collect sales tax and full compliance with sales and use tax laws would create 13,000 jobs in the state. =Virginia= In January 2012 the Alliance announced its support for legislation introduced by State Senator Frank Wagner that would require companies with a distribution center, warehouse, fulfillment center, office, or other such location in the Commonwealth of Virginia to collect and remit sales tax. In January 2012 Virginia and Amazon.com reached an agreement regarding the collection of sales tax on purchases made by Virginia residents. Under the agreement Amazon will begin collecting sales tax on purchases made by Virginia residents on 1 September 2013. Amazon will begin collecting sales tax ten months after opening distribution centers in Chesterfield and Dinwiddle counties.

It was named after a song initially performed by American singer Maria Taylor. Written by series creator Shonda Rhimes and directed by Tony Phelan, it premiered on ABC in the United States on March 31, 2011. It is the series's first musical episode, and features the cast performing songs previously featured within the program. It is accompanied by a soundtrack album, titled Grey's Anatomy: The Music Event, also released on March 31, 2011. The episode revolves around Callie Torres (Sara Ramirez) and Arizona Robbins (Jessica Capshaw), just after they are involved in a vehicular collision. Various songs are performed by the cast members, as they attempt to save the life of Torres. Rhimes originally idealized the episode at the conception of the drama, while the show remained untitled. The episode opened to polarized reviews from television critics, and it was the second most-watched program of the night. \\"Song Beneath the Song\\" was ranked in several \\"best and worst\\" lists, and the soundtrack also charted on the Billboard 200. Plot En route to a weekend getaway, surgeons Callie Torres (Sara Ramirez) and Arizona Robbins (Jessica Capshaw) are involved in a vehicular collision, moments after Robbins proposes marriage. Torres suffers severe injuries, which endanger both her life and the life of her unborn child. She and Robbins are taken to Seattle Grace Mercy West Hospital, the institute at which they both work. Their colleagues attempt to save Torres, while Robbins and Mark Sloan (Eric Dane), the father of Torres's baby, stand by. Torres's many injuries include neurological trauma. While barely conscious, she hallucinates an uninjured version of herself standing beside her. The hallucinatory Torres begins to sing, and is gradually joined by the doctors treating her. This singing continues throughout the episode, as Torres's projection of herself attempts to reach out to Robbins. Torres goes into cardiac arrest and is taken into an operating room she is temporarily stabilized, pending further surgery. She is moved into intensive care, while neonatal surgeon Addison Montgomery (Kate Walsh) is flown in by helicopter in case the baby has to be delivered prematurely. Robbins and Sloan argue over Torres's treatment; Robbins believes that Torres would not risk endangering the baby, but Sloan argues for saving Torres at all costs. The attending surgeons devise a treatment plan, led by trauma surgeon Owen Hunt (Kevin McKidd). As they do so, Torres dreams about the moments preceding the accident. Her dream self sings to Robbins, interspersed with shots of the hospital staff singing and dancing with their own partners. Dr. Cristina Yang (Sandra Oh) suggests treating Torres with a high-risk but potentially effective cardiothoracic procedure she learned from her old mentor, Preston Burke (Isaiah Washington). Her current mentor, Teddy Altman (Kim Raver), refuses to perform it, but when Torres's condition deteriorates and she is rushed back into surgery, Hunt agrees that Yang should attempt the procedure. When Torres again goes into cardiac arrest, Montgomery delivers her daughter at twenty-three week's gestation. The baby is initially unable to breathe, so with Sloan's support, Robbins steps in and is able to revive her. Across the operating room, Torres's condition begins to improve. Once the surgery is complete, the doctors deal with their own affairs; Sloan's former partner Lexie Grey (Chyler Leigh) commits to her new relationship with resident Jackson Avery (Jesse Williams); Lexie's sister, Meredith Grey (Ellen Pompeo) confesses that she was jealous of Torres's pregnancy, which prompts her husband Derek Shepherd (Patrick Dempsey) to promise that they will have a child together; Altman tells Yang that she can no longer teach her; Sloan and Robbins bond over their shared parenthood. Later, as Robbins keeps a vigil by Torres's bedside, the hallucinatory Torres is able to rouse her recovering self. As she regains consciousness, Torres accepts Robbins's proposal. Production=Conception= Since Grey's Anatomy began, series creator Shonda Rhimes had planned to produce a musical episode. She first discussed the idea during filming of the pilot episode, when the program was as yet untitled. Rhimes felt that seasons 6 and 7 were the right time for the crew to \\"try anything and everything [they had] always wanted to do,\\" and explained that she \\"finally [had] the right idea and the right talent to make [a musical episode] happen.\\" Filming began 7-and-a-half years after Rhimes initially raised the idea. The episode was shot in approximately 2 weeks. Though cast member Dempsey jokingly referred to the episode as Glee M.D., Rhimes intended for it to differ from other musical television episodes. She called it the opposite of \\"Once More, with Feeling,\\" the \\"all-out, show-stopping,\\" musical episode of Buffy the Vampire Slayer, as she aimed to \\"do something that was musical without being a musical.\\" Rhimes said she had difficulty getting the network's permission. She added: \\"I begged the studio people. I begged the network people. I took these people to dinner and begged. I jumped out at these people in bathrooms and begged. And they all smiled politely but what they were clearly really thinking was, 'This woman is an idiot.'\\" Rhimes also told about delays in producing this episode: The script was written by Rhimes in November 2010. She centered the episode around Ramirez's character, Callie, and stated that the storyline would have developed regardless of whether it involved musical performances. Sara Ramirez used the opportunity to launch her career as a singer-songwriter; an alternate version of \\"The Story\\" is included on her debut EP, released four days prior to the episode's premiere. In this episode, Mark and Arizona improve their relationship. Capshaw said, \\"The traumatic circumstance leads to them having a greater understanding of each other and then appreciation, and then need for each other and desire to be in each other‚Äôs lives. They come to care, I think, for one another.\\" =Musical performances= Ramirez (pictured) was the episode's primary vocalist. Rhimes, executive producer Betsy Beers and director Tony Phelan selected songs that had become well-known by their use in Grey's Anatomy, and chose \\"the most iconic ones, the ones that best suited [their] singers, and the ones that made the most sense.\\" The multiple cover versions include the program's theme tune, \\"Cosy in the Rocket\\" by Psapp. The primary vocalists are cast members Ramirez, McKidd, Leigh and Chandra Wilson. The soundtrack also includes \\"How to Save a Life\\" by The Fray and \\"Running on Sunshine\\" by Jesus Jackson, performed as ensemble pieces by Ramirez, McKidd, Leigh, Daniel Sunjata, Scott Foley, Ellen Pompeo, Justin Chambers, Raver, Dane, and Capshaw. Ramirez, McKidd and Wilson also perform together on Snow Patrol's \\"Chasing Cars.\\" Ramirez is the lead vocalist on \\"The Story\\" by Brandi Carlile, and \\"Grace\\" by Kate Havnevik, which also features the other female cast members, including Leigh and Sarah Drew on the chorus. Capshaw duets with Ramirez on KT Tunstall's \\"Universe & U.\\" Wilson is the lead vocalist on \\"Wait\\" by Get Set Go, McKidd on \\"How We Operate\\" by Gomez, and Leigh on Anna Nalick's \\"Breathe (2 AM).\\" Leigh said that some actors were not \\"excited\\" about singing but still could participate in the episode. \\"There were certain ways in which the scenes were written, even if there was a song in there, that perhaps a line was spoken instead of sung,\\" she said. A vocal coach was enlisted to help the cast. Music director Chris Horvath was recruited to arrange the selected songs for the cast. The arrangements took around two months, with vocals recorded over four days in February 2011. Horvath praised the cast's response to the episode, noting that only four performers had \\"serious vocal talent,\\" while some had \\"barely sung in the shower\\" before. Those with professional singing experience include Ramirez, who won a Tony Award for her role in the musical Spamalot, and Wilson, who appeared in the Broadway production of Caroline, or Change. Cast members' reactions toward the episode varied. Pompeo initially deemed the idea \\"crazy,\\" but changed her mind following the first read-through. Recurring cast member Sunjata stated that singing was \\"a bit out of [his] comfort zone,\\" but found it an \\"interesting challenge,\\" and McKidd deemed it \\"very exciting to do something that's completely out on a limb for the show.\\" Reception=Pre- Broadcast Commentary= Critical response prior to broadcast was mixed. TVLine Michael Ausiello assessed that the episode would \\"either be a show-stopping triumph or a spectacular failure,\\" with no possible middle ground. William Keck of TV Guide initially had \\"serious doubts,\\" which were allayed by a visit to the set, during which he listened to the soundtrack. Keck likened it to the \\"much-beloved early seasons of Grey, when music played a vital role on the show.\\" Entertainment Weekly Dan Snierson predicted heavy use of Auto Tune, though fellow EW writer Jennifer Armstrong was optimistic that the episode would be a success, commenting: \\"I have faith. I like musicals, I like Grey. I'm rooting for this to work.\\" =Ratings= During its original broadcast, \\"Song Beneath the Song\\" was watched by an average of 13.09 million American viewers. It attained a 4.9/13 Nielsen rating/share in the 18‚Äì49 demographic, making it the second highest-rated program of the night, behind only American Idol on the Fox network. The rating was the second-highest of the seventh season until that point, and a 30% increase from the previous episode, \\"This is How We Do It,\\" which was watched by 2.4 million fewer viewers. In Canada, where the episode also aired on March 31, 2011, it was watched by 3.18 million viewers. Viewership again increased on \\"This is How We Do It,\\" which attained 2.63 million viewers. However, while the preceding episode was the most-viewed scripted show for the week of its original broadcast, \\"Song Beneath the Song\\" ranked second, behind The Big Bang Theory. =Post-Broadcast Commentary= Following the first minutes of the drama, reactions on Twitter were polarized. Nicole Golden from TV Fanatic gave the episode 4.5 stars out of 5.0. She found that \\"overall, the concept worked since music really has always played a big part in the show. Some songs were more appropriate and/or better performed than others, though.\\" She also wrote the concept worked in part because it was new but noted \\"the format would probably not have the same effect if used in future episodes.\\" Even though Boston Heralds critic Mark Perigard was not a fan of the concept, saying \\"the Grey's Anatomy event proved how tricky it is for an established show, especially a drama, to pull off a musical episode,\\" he did like several actors' performances. He wrote: \\"Chandra Wilson and Chyler Leigh (whom I never have anything good to say about) delivered some impressive vocal work. Eric Dane did some of his best acting of his career last night as an anxious father-to-be terrified he would lose his best friend.\\" Lyneka Little of The Wall Street Journal wrote, \\"If Glee and ER had a baby it would be tonight‚Äôs episode of the medical drama Grey‚Äôs Anatomy titled 'Song Beneath the Song'.\\" In his review of the episode Alan Sepinwall of HitFix wrote \\"Like Grey's Anatomy as a whole, some parts were unintentionally silly, others were surprisingly powerful, and it was rarely dull, at least.\\" Patrick Dempsey admitted that the musical episode might not have been showrunner Shonda Rhimes's best idea. He explained: \\"It's very difficult to keep it fresh when you're doing 24 episodes a year. Shonda Rhimes has a lot of ideas, and she is in a position where she can take more chances. Sometimes that works, sometimes it does not. Last year we had the singing episode, which I think was a big mistake. But you have to try.\\" =Accolades= In 2011, the episode was ranked #19 on the TV Guide Network special, 25 Biggest TV Blunders 2. It was included in TV Guides list \\"The Worst Of 2011\\" saying, \\"Sara Ramirez has powerhouse pipes, but what this episode desperately needed was a better playlist.\\" BuddyTV, however, ranked it #43 on its list of 2011's 50 Best TV Episodes and it also appeared on Digital Spys shortlist of \\"TV's Best Musical Episodes.\\" Supervising Music Editor Jennifer Barak and Music Editors Carli Barber and Jessica Harrison were nominated in the Best Sound Editing: Short Form Musical in Television category at the 2012 Golden Reel Awards for their work on the episode. Soundtrack=Track listingChart History= Grey's Anatomy: The Music Event debuted at #24 on the Billboard 200, with 19,000 copies sold. It reached #2 on the U.S. Soundtracks chart, and was #5 on the Independent Album chart. \\"The Story\\" entered the Billboard Hot 100 singles chart at #69, and the Canadian Hot 100 at #72.

In administering the DICWP, the Office of the Inspector General, U.S. Department of Defense (DoDIG) balances the competing national security and separation of powers interests raised by whistleblowing within the Defense Intelligence Community.The DoDIG provides a safe, authorized conduit for Defense Department whistleblowers to disclose classified information. The Inspector General also has authority to investigate whistleblowing reprisal allegations filed by civilian and military members of the Defense Intelligence Community. It therefore accepts the disclosures and provides source protection for those providing the information. The Department of Defense funds and supervises much of the Republic's intelligence gathering. DoD IG accordingly provides protection to a large number of civilian and military intelligence personnel.Lindsay Boyd & Brian Futagaki, Intelligent Whistleblowing, Journal of Public Integrity (Summer 2010 ) at 20 (an article presenting a history of the intelligence community whistleblowing and outlining the procedures employed by DoD IG to protect DoD intelligence community whistleblowers from reprisal.).  Defense Intelligence Community & Whistleblower Protection  DoDIG administers the DICWP not as a member of the Intelligence community (above), but as an independent and neutral outsider to the circle of agencies collecting and analyzing the Republic's intelligence. The Defense Intelligence Community includes the Defense Intelligence Agency (DIA), the National Security Agency (NSA), the National Reconnaissance Office (NRO), and the National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency (NGA), all military service and combatant command intelligence components, as well as those DoD components providing counter-intelligence mission capability. The DoD does not receive disclosures or investigate reprisal involving intelligence personnel outside of DoD, such as persons employed by the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) or the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI).Id. The Civil Service Reform Act of 1978 (CSRA or Act) was passed in response to public concern over the efficiency, integrity, and accountability of the federal workforce.H. Manley Case, Project on the Merit Systems Protection Board: The Civil Service Reform Act of 1978: Article: Federal Employee Job Rights: The Pendleton Act of 1883 to the Civil Service Reform Act of 1978, 29 How. L.J. 283 (1986). The Act codified the merit system principles governing the federal workforce.5 U.S.C. ¬ß 2301. One of these statutory principles states that employees should be protected from reprisal in response to whistleblowing.5 U.S.C. 2302(b)(8)&(b)(9). The CSRA provided the first substantive protections for agency whistleblowers, creating the Office of Personnel Management, the Office of Special Counsel and the Merit Systems Protection Board.Civil Service Reform Act of 1978, P.L. 95-454; 92 Stat. 1111 (codified at 5 U.S.C. ¬ß¬ß 1101, 1201, 1211). A little over a decade later, the Whistleblower Protection Act of 1989 (WPA) enhanced CSRA whistleblower protections. The WPA recognized that whistleblowing federal employees ‚Äúserve the public interest by assisting in the elimination of fraud, waste, abuse, and unnecessary government expenditures.‚ÄùWhistleblower Protection Act of 1989, P.L 101-12; 103 Stat. 16. Through the WPA, whistleblowers gained an independent right to pursue an appeal to MSPB.5 U.S.C. ¬ß 1221. Neither the CRSA nor the WPA provided protection for employees of the Defense Intelligence Community.5 U.S.C. ¬ß 2302 (a)(2)(c). The Church Committee hearings concurrently led to passage of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act of 1978 (FISA). To enable and implement the FISA, the Department of Defense issued DOD Regulation 5240.R. Procedures 14 and 15 of this regulation provided whistleblower protection for Defense Intelligence Community service members and employees reporting ‚Äúquestionable activities.‚Äù In a separate move, the Congress legislated to protect its own access to Defense Intelligence Community whistleblowers through the Intelligence Community Whistleblower Protection Act of 1998 (ICWPA).Intelligence Community Whistleblower Protection Act of 1998, P.L. 105-272; 112 Stat. 2396 (codified at 5 U.S.C. App. ¬ß 8h). Whistleblower reprisal allegations under both the FISA and the ICWPA can be docketed and filed through the Defense Hotline. The ICWPA's protection, however, is narrow. The ICWPA does not contain general protections against reprisal. Subject- matter experts in the field have suggested that a more appropriate name for the ICWPA would be the Intelligence Community Disclosure Act because the statute addresses only a very specific dilemma, namely, how one reports wrongdoing to the U.S. Congress when the wrongdoing involves classified information.Boyd & Futagaki at 21.  Protecting Sources  Defense whistleblower investigations aid in making sure counter-intelligence agents get the right spy, such as Major John Andr√©. The mechanics of protecting Defense Intelligence Community whistleblowers occurs, in part, through the Inspector General Act passed in 1978. The IG Act authorizes statutory inspectors general to receive and investigate complaints or information received from agency employees concerning a violation of law, rules, or regulations; or mismanagement; gross waste of funds; abuse of authority; or a substantial and specific danger to the public health and safety. Like the CSRA, the IG Act also contains substantive protections against whistleblower reprisal.5 U.S.C. App. ¬ß 7(c) However, unlike the CSRA, the IG Act provides no general exemption preventing protection of intelligence and counterintelligence employees.The IG Act does provide the Secretary of Defense with the discretion to place intelligence and national security matters beyond the jurisdiction of the Inspector General. See 5 U.S.C. Appx. ¬ß 8(b)(1). The DoDIG, accordingly, uses this authority to provide protection to those filing reprisal complaint using the Defense Hotline. If the Defense Inspector General has jurisdiction over an intelligence or counter-intelligence service member or employee, there is a means of providing whistleblower protection. Within the Defense Intelligence Community, the DoD IG‚Äîas the lead inspector general of the Defense Department ‚Äì delegates to the Civilian Reprisal Investigations (CRI) and Military Reprisal Investigations directorates the responsibility of conducting investigations into allegations of reprisal from civilian appropriated fund employees and military members.Department of Defense Directive 5106.1 ¬∂ 5.19.1. DoD IG accordingly exercises primary jurisdiction over complainants from the Defense Intelligence Community not having access to the federal government's primary agency for whistleblower protection, the U.S. Office of Special Counsel.See Inspector General Instruction 7050.71(2)(h)(1) & 7050.11 (e) & (f). With respect to civilian Defense Department employees working in the intelligence and counterintelligence fields, the Inspector General's CRI directorate was established in 2003. The directorate investigates whistleblower reprisal by determining whether a complainant was subject to a negative action as a result of disclosing instances of fraud, waste, and abuse; or violations of law, rule, and regulation.Lindsay Boyd & Brian Futagaki, Intelligent Whistleblowing, Journal of Public Integrity (Summer 2010 ) at 22. CRI uses title 5 of the United States Code (5 U.S.C.) as the standard for its intelligence and counter-intelligence whistleblower reprisal investigations. Under section 2302 of title 5, a negative action such as a suspension, a demotion or termination is defined as a personnel action.5 U.S.C. ¬ß 2302 If a CRI investigation finds causation between a disclosure and a personnel action taken against the disclosure's source, the case is substantiated.Boyd & Futagaki at 22. But if the employee's Agency has clear and convincing evidence that a personnel action would have been taken against a civilian employee absent their disclosure of alleged wrongdoing, the Inspector General ‚Äúnon-substantiates‚Äù the case.Id. The Defense Intelligence Community reprisal complaints prompting DoDIG investigation may come to CRI and MRI through several channels. An employee may file through the Defense Hotline, or one of the DoD component hotlines oversighted by the DoDIG. In addition, complainants may contact a member of Congress to report the whistleblower retaliation and then be sent to the Inspector General, or the case may be referred to the DoDIG by the Assistant to the Secretary of Defense for Intelligence Oversight (ATSD-IO), if it is forwarded through that office. The ATSD-IO administers DoD Regulation 5240.1-R, but very few of the complaints filed by DoD employees involved in intelligence and counterintelligence activities have included allegations of reprisal for whistleblowing activities.Office of the Inspector General, U.S. Department of Defense, Statement of Mr. Thomas F. Gimble Acting Inspector General Department of Defense before the Subcommittee on National Security, Emerging Threats, and International Relations House Committee on Government Reform on National Security Whistleblower Protection (Feb. 14, 2006) at 6-10. The varied means of filing complaints lead to a process called ‚Äúdeconfliction,‚Äù by which government agencies prevent duplicative efforts. ‚ÄúDeconfliction‚Äù may be resolved by a component inspector general undertaking an investigation, with the DoDIG oversighting the effort. Similarly, inspectors general of the Defense intelligence agencies themselves may receive reprisal complaints and refer them to the Defense Hotline.Boyd & Futagaki at 22. Once an investigation is concluded, the Inspector General issues a report to the Agency's proponent command. Unsubstantiated allegations result in case closure with no corrective action. Reports of substantiated whistleblower reprisal bear recommendations that the complainant be made whole through remedies provided by the command or component.  Recent Defense Intelligence & Counter-intelligence Cases  Spying for the nation does not come at the price of whistleblower protection. Notable examplesBoyd & Futagaki at 23-24. of the Defense Intelligence Community Whistleblower Program work within the last three years include: * A report of investigation issued by the National Security Agency and oversighted by the DoDIG. The complainant alleged reprisal for disclosing creation of a hostile work environment through intimidating workplace conduct. NSA substantiated the reprisal allegation through a significant change in work duties, responsibilities, and hours. DoD IG concurred; * A report of investigation issued by the Defense Intelligence Agency. The complainant alleged reprisal after disclosing misuse of a Congressionally authorized countertrafficking and counternarcotics billet funds. DIA did not substantiate the allegation, concluding that clear and convincing evidence existed and that the negative action would have been taken absent the complainant's disclosure. DoD IG concurred; * A report of investigation issued by the former Counterintelligence Field Activity. The complainant alleged reprisal for disclosing an agency supervisor's relationship with and preferential treatment of a retained defense contractor. DoD IG substantiated the complainant's allegation of reprisal by removal of duties, reassignment, and eventual termination. As partners of DoD IG in the Defense Intelligence Community Whistleblower Program, the NSA and DIA are thought by subject-matter experts in the field to be at the forefront of whistleblower protection within the general intelligence and counterintelligence community. By fostering these partnerships, as well as utilizing the IG Act of 1978, DoD IG investigates claims of whistleblower reprisal from the defense intelligence community in order to protect all of its employees from reprisal.Boyd & Futagaki at 24.

Jonas Federal Building. and a United States post office. Designed by the Office of the Supervising Architect under James A. Wetmore, it was completed in 1915; the building was renamed in honor of long-serving North Carolina Congressman Charles R. Jonas, and was transferred to the city in exchange for land in the fall of 2005, and has been leased back to the federal government for continued use. History The Charles R. Jonas Federal Building is located on a site important to the history of Charlotte, and is one of the few historic structures remaining in the Central Business District. The first branch of the U.S. Mint had been built on the northeast section of the site in 1836, and in 1891, a Post Office facility was built on the southwest portion of the site. The space between the two buildings was converted to a park/plaza. In 1913 the Mint functions were discontinued (the building eventually becoming the Mint Museum) and the 1891 post office building was torn down. In 1915 the first portion of what would later become the Charles R. Jonas Federal Building, a new post office, was built on the site of the older one. In 1934 an addition to the original Post Office was completed on the site of the Mint. The addition tripled the size of the original and changed the orientation of the main facade and entry of the building to West Trade Street at the southeast. The site of the Federal building has historically been used for U.S. government buildings. That use continues today as the site of the Jonas Federal Building where the 1915-1934 building remains a symbol of the Federal presence in Charlotte. It is, in fact, the busiest statutory location for holding Federal Court in the Western District of North Carolina. Although the settlement of Charlotte dates from the colonial period, it is very much a symbol of the \\"new South\\". It has become one of the nation's most important financial and marketing centers. As a result of this, the Central Business District is now largely given over to commercial enterprises housed in new buildings. Therefore, in addition to representing the Federal government in Charlotte, the Charles R. Jonas Federal Building is one of the few historic structures remaining in the Central Business District. Architectural description The building is a two-story Neoclassical limestone structure. The main elevation (northeast) faces West Trade Street. It features a full-length colonnade, with a projecting central temple-front pavilion. On either side of the central pavilion are colonnades divided into eight bays. Massive, monolithic Corinthian columns support an entablature with denticulated cornice. Each of the three entry doors has an elaborate limestone surround featuring fluted engaged pilasters which support a decorative cornice. There are two secondary entrances with decorative limestone surrounds set within the flanking colonnades. The southeast elevation is the main elevation of the original 1915 building and features two entries, one at either end. The entry doors are set within projecting corner pavilions. The decorative door surrounds feature fluted engaged pilasters which support a classical cornice. Flanking each entry door are original bronze wall-mounted lanterns. The central pavilion of the elevation is expressed as nine bays delineated by engaged Corinthian pilasters. The denticulated cornice and unembellished frieze are present on the southeast, northwest, and northeast. The northwest elevation reflects the design of the southeast elevation though there are no main entry doors here. The central portion of the facade is divided into nine bays delineated by engaged pilasters. Due to the slope of the site, basement windows are above grade on this elevation. The southwest elevation features a distinctive original copper-clad loading dock. Significant interior spaces include the main lobby and the ceremonial courtroom on the second floor. The L-shaped lobby, once a Post Office sales area, retains its original marble floors, wainscot, pilasters, light fixtures and ornamental plaster ceiling.

Proprietor 1754 to 1796. Firmin & Sons is a British company, founded in 1655, that manufactures and supplies military ceremonial buttons, badges, accoutrements, and uniforms. Thomas Firmin was born in Ipswich, Suffolk in 1632 and was apprenticed to The Girdlers Company the makers of belts both for fine dress and for utility. The account records of the Master and Wardens of the Girdlers survived the Great Fire of London. There is an entry in the accounts for the year 1653/54 of Thomas Firmin paying six shillings for the half year. By this time he appears to have completed his apprenticeship as he is listed amongst the yeomen of the company for that year. Upon completion of his apprenticeship he is known to have set up in business on his own, in premises at Three King‚Äôs Court, off Lombard Street, in the Langborne Ward in the City of London. By the account year for The Girdlers Company 1655/56 Richard Overston is Master and John Taylor Renter Warden. Thomas Firmin's business is such that the account records show that John Taylor receives a sum of two pounds and six shillings in the year aforesaid for the presentment of George Robotham, his apprentice for eight years. The business can therefore be said to have been established by this date of 1655. By the year 1661/62, the accounts show that Thomas Firmin has moved up in seniority within The Girdlers' Company, possibly joining the assistants as he is no longer listed further down as yeoman. He went on to be a noteworthy citizen of London. He was a great philanthropist of his day, establishing many work support schemes for the poor of London. This included providing work for Huguenot and other refugees settling in and around London. He was appointed a governor of Christ‚Äôs Hospital, a governor of St Thomas‚Äôs Hospital, the administrator responsible for considerable sums for the day of several charitable works set up by King Charles II. He was elected an early member of the Royal Society, having been proposed by Robert Hook the contemporary of Sir Isaac Newton and Sir Christopher Wren. Out of the ashes of the Great Fire of 1666, Thomas Firmin continues his business in the City eventually rebuilding parts of Three Kings Court. The previous established date of 1677 is in the trade directory of that date \\"The List of Merchants for the City of London\\", a copy of which is also held in Guildhall Library. Following the discovery of several entries in this Ancient Livery Company‚Äôs manuscript records, the establishment date of 1655 can now be adopted (manuscript references have been given and are available for public scrutiny). Through the reigns of sixteen British monarchs, Firmin & Sons at the age of 362 years (in 2017), can be said to be the oldest manufacturing company and is one of the 10 oldest established companies in the United Kingdom and is among the 500 oldest companies in the world. After Wilkinson Sword stopped the production of swords in 2005, Firmin & Sons began sponsoring the Sword of Peace award.

Until 2009, two other gliding clubs shared the airfield with the BVS, AKA Flieg Freiburg and CFM Emmendingen. They have both moved their operations to Freiburg Airport since.  Operations  ASK 13 on short final runway 36L Currently, only winch launching for gliders is permitted at Kirchzarten. Motorized take-offs are forbidden due to local noise restrictions. There have been occasional exceptions to this rule during special events. Runway 18C / 36C (1170m) is used for winch launches, in most cases 36C due to wind conditions. Landings are usually done on the two shorter landing fields, but in calm wind conditions and with little traffic the center runway is used in the opposite direction to reduce turnaround times.

Biography James Gruber was born August 21, 1928 in Des Moines, Iowa. Growing up he considered himself bisexual and was involved with both men and women. His father, a former vaudevillian turned music teacher, relocated the family to Los Angeles in 1936. Gruber enlisted in the United States Marine Corps in 1946 at the age of 18 and was honorably discharged in 1949. Using his G.I. Bill benefits, Gruber studied English literature at Occidental College in Los Angeles.James Gruber, last original Mattachine member, dies Gruber met and began a relationship with photographer Konrad Stevens. The couple attended a meeting of an early homophile organization then called the \\"Society of Fools\\". Gruber and Stevens joined the group in April 1951 and became part of the \\"Fifth Order\\", the group's central leadership.Bullough, p. 78 Both men were eager to join despite not having been previously politically involved and not having backgrounds in the Marxist philosophy that informed the group.D'Emilio, p. 66 That lack of familiarity led the group to restate its ideas in ways that those without a Marxist background could understand.D'Emilio, p. 67 Founding member Chuck Rowland recalled the energy the two brought to the group. \\"It was like magic when they joined. Suddenly everything started to happen.\\"Sears, p. 118 Following a conversation with co-founder Harry Hay about Medieval masque troops known as \\"mattachines\\", Gruber suggested changing the group's name from \\"Society of Fools\\" to Mattachine Society.Johansson and Percy, p. 92 Gruber attributed Mattachine's success to the feeling of acceptance that it fostered. \\"All of us had known a whole lifetime of not talking, of repression. Just the freedom to open up...really, that's what it was all about. We had found a sense of belonging, of camaraderie, of openness in an atmosphere of tension and distrust....Such a great deal of it was a social climate. A family feeling came out of it, a great nonsexual emphasis....It was a brand new idea.\\"Quoted in D'Emilio, pp. 67-8 In 1953, the Communist ties of several of the Fifth Order led the leadership, including Gruber, to resign.Faderman and Timmons, p. 113 Through his studies at Occidental, Gruber met the author Christopher Isherwood, who in turn introduced him to W. H. Auden. Isherwood also introduced Gruber to his landlady, Evelyn Hooker. Hooker, a psychologist, pioneered research into sexual orientation that contributed to the removal of homosexuality as a mental illness from the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders. Growing increasingly disillusioned with life in Los Angeles, Gruber moved to Palo Alto in 1960 and changed his first name to John. He pursued a teaching career at Foothill College and San Francisco State University and also taught or tutored at Cubberly High School, Milpitas High School and de Anza College. Gruber helped to document the early LGBT movement through interviews with historians, participating in a panel discussion in San Francisco in 2000 commemorating the 50th anniversary of the founding of Mattachine and appearing in the 2001 documentary film Hope Along the Wind about the life of Harry Hay. Death Gruber suffered increasingly ill health for several years before his death on February 27, 2011, at his home in Santa Clara. ReferencesBibliography * Bullough, Vern L. \\"Harry Hay\\".

Paterson states that the Cuninghame family continuously held Ashinyards from circa 1570Dobie, Page 70 until an eldest daughter, Elizabeth Cuninghame, married John Bowman Esq in 1695; who did however, as stated, purchase the estate. John Bowman was a Glasgow merchant, and chief magistrate in 1715. Their son, John Bowman, became Lord Provost of Glasgow and married a Miss Houghton of Dublin in 1734, the couple had two sons and two daughters. When he died in 1796 he left the estate and other properties in the parish to Anne, his eldest daughter, because his eldest son John married and settled in North America, whilst his second son Houghton married a Miss Vere and moved to Dominica. John Bowman changed the name from Ashinyards to Ashgrove. Anne Bowman married Miller Hill Hunt, a captain in the 6th Regiment of Foot who had fought and been wounded at the Battle of Culloden. Captain Hunt died in 1783 and his wife died in 1811. They had three daughters, Maria, Margaret Anne and Elizabeth Ballantyne. Margaret inherited in 1811 as the only surviving heir and changed her name to Bowman, her maternal grandfathers surname, and took his coat of arms. Elizabeth had married Roger Rollo, brother of Lord Rollo, a Collector of Customs in Ayr and had four sons and two daughters. The coat of arms are a classic armorial rebus or pun on the 'Bowman' name with two strung bows and a quiver of arrows. Records show that family members joined the Ancient Society of Kilwinning Archers. Anne, or Lady Bowman as she was known locally, was succeeded by Andrew FitzJames Cuninghame Rollo-Bowman-Ballantyne of Ashgrove and Castlehill, born, 1835, who was the son of Elizabeth and Roger Rollo, her sister and brother in law. Andrew married Anne Harriet Curzon Chalmers in 1864 and the couple had offspring.Burke's Peerage Retrieved : 25 March 2011 The Ballantine family still held the property in the 1930s. Ashgrove Loch and natural history Ashgrove Loch's stone crannog or dun. Ashgrove Loch from Lochwood. Ashgrove Loch, Lochwood Loch, or Stevenston Loch lies to the west of Ashgrove and is recorded as the only mineral enriched mesotrophic loch in North Ayrshire. The area has been extensively drained by means of a deep ditch or \\"cunnel\\"Smith, Page 45 and only 10% of the surviving loch is open water; a floating raft of vegetation covers the remainder. The name 'Loch Canal' on the OS maps is recorded for the Canal or burn from Stevenston Loch that ran to a Sluice at the North side of Lochend. It was called a canal because this section of the Burn or lade was cleaned on a three yearly basis and a sluice was once present that regulated the flow of water to Stevenston Mill.Ayrshire OS Name Book, Volume 57 The loch is a Site of Special Scientific Interest (SSSI) since 1975 and many interesting plant species, including greater bladderwort, lesser pond sedge, tufted loosestrife, and the nationally rare cowbane have been recorded. Breeding birds include snipe, water rail, grasshopper warbler, and reed bunting. The countryside around Ashgrove Loch is amongst the richest in the area; the fields attract flocks of chaffinch, reed bunting, yellowhammer, and tree sparrow. =Crannogs= John Smith recorded up to six crannogs in Ashgrove Loch, one, on the eastern side, is said to be unique as a crannog in that it was mainly of a stone rather than the usual timber construction with a causeway built of large sandstone blocks. It is possible that this 'crannog' was actually a dun or mediaeval fort. A considerable number of relics were found, such as chisels, wooden spoons, shears, bone implements, etc.Smith, Page 51 A local tradition holds that the treasures of Kilwinning Abbey were hidden on a crannog in the loch by the monks when the abbey was sacked during the reformation. The proximity of the old 'Kings Road' to Portencross to the site is of interest in this regard. Micro-history The old 'White Gates' entrance ruins to Ashgrove House. The old Ashgrove House driveway. In 1673 James Cunninghame was appointed as then tutor to Sir William Cunninghame of Cunninghamhead. James Cunninghame of Ashinyards was a Covenanter and was jailed for 9 months for his refusal to conform.Records of Parliament Retrieved : 25 March 2011 John Bowman Esg of Ashgrove purchased the estate of Montgreenan in 1778, however he later sold the property to Robert Glasgow Esq of Glasgow in 1794.Robertson, Page 266 The 1851 census records that Margaret Ann Bowman Margaret, aged 78 was the landed proprietrix, farming about 130 acres. Alexander Currie was an agricultural labourer at Ashgrove, together with a dairymaid Margaret Macallum and a housemaid, Janet Baillie1851 census Retrieved : 25 March 2011 A film of Ashgrove in the 1930s exists with a DeHavilland DH-60 Moth aeroplane G-EBUX on display. At the time the property was still owned by the Ballantine family and Monica Ballantine often landed her aircraft on the estate fields near to the house.Scran Site Retrieved : 25 March 2011 Ashgrove House stood derelict for many years and became ruinous prior to its demolition by a local farmer. The foresters cottage was located on an estate lane near to the south west of the house and was rebuilt as a bungalow in the 1930s only to be vandalised when unoccupied and it was subsequently demolished as a result. A steading known as Ashinyards was located on the hill however this was demolished and the stones removed. The estate fields were largely planted with turnips and potatoes in the 1940s. The monks of Kilwinning Abbey traditionally mined coal near to Ashgrove House and a later mine was abandoned due to flooding when the workings dug into the old flooded monk's workings. An Asiatic Cholera pit is traditionally said to be located near the Long Ride Plantation. See also * Stevenston * Kilwinning * Montgreenan References Notes; Sources; # Dobie, James D.

It is most commonly used either during union organizing efforts, or during strikes. The aim most often is to prevent a union from forming, to destroy an existing union, or to reduce the effectiveness of a union or a particular strike action. If strikers prevent people or goods to enter or leave a workplace, violence may be used to allow people and goods to pass the picket line. Violence against unions may be isolated, or may occur as part of a campaign that includes spying, intimidation, impersonation, disinformation, and sabotage.Robert Michael Smith, From Blackjacks To Briefcases ‚Äî A History of Commercialized Strikebreaking and Unionbusting in the United States, 2003, p. 87 Violence in labor disputes may be the result of unreasonable polarization, or miscalculation. It may be willful and provoked, or senseless and tragic. On some occasions, violence in labor disputes may be purposeful and calculated,Robert Hunter, Violence and the labor movement, Macmillan, 1914 (1919 version), page 318 for example the hiring and deployment of goon squads to assault strikers. Incidents of violence during periods of labor unrest are sometimes perceived differently by different parties. It is sometimes a challenge to ascertain the truth about labor-related violence, and incidents of violence committed by, or in the name of, unions or union workers have occurred as well.  History  The practice of workers organizing, and meeting resistance for organizing, dates to antiquity.John Romer, Ancient Lives; the story of the Pharaoh's Tombmakers. London: Phoenix Press, 1984, pp. 116-123 See also E.F. Wente, \\"A letter of complaint to the Vizier To\\", in Journal of Near Eastern Studies, 20, 1961 and W.F. Edgerton, \\"The strikes in Ramses III's Twenty-ninth year\\", Journal of Near Eastern Studies, 10, 1951. The first known individual killed by authorities for labor activities is likely Cinto Brandini, executed with nine others in 1345 Florence for attempting to organize woolcombers. According to a study in 1969, the United States has had the bloodiest and most violent labor history of any industrial nation in the world.Philip Taft and Philip Ross, \\"American Labor Violence: Its Causes, Character, and Outcome,\\" The History of Violence in America: A Report to the National Commission on the Causes and Prevention of Violence, ed. Hugh Davis Graham and Ted Robert Gurr, 1969. Mass labor violence in the U.S. peaked in the early 20th century and has largely subsided since the 1940s. But the deadly suppression of labor unions on a large scale persists into the new century, in the 2012 Marikana killings in South Africa, in the ongoing assassinations of trade union members in Colombia, and the South Korean government's response to Korean Confederation of Trade Unions protests.  Causes  Since unions are organized to achieve collective bargaining power to begin with, most union conflicts have been motivated primarily by economic issues (wages, working hours, safety conditions, work rules, etc.), and have engaged antagonists (employers, hired strikebreakers, replacement workers, local law enforcement) with economic goals in mind. In some instances, however, other causes emerge. =Race= French cartoon of the Rand Rebellion in South Africa, 1922 The 1887 Thibodaux massacre in Louisiana, the 1899 Pana riot in southern Illinois, and the 1911 Queen & Crescent killings in Kentucky and Tennessee are three examples of deliberate campaigns of murder against organized black workers in the American south, the first committed by landowners, the other two by white competitors. In South Africa the 1922 Rand Rebellion also had underlying racial causes, taking on the slogan \\"Workers of the world, unite and fight for a white South Africa!\\", before their strike grew to a small-scale rebellion at the cost of 200 lives. The behavior of South African police in the 1946 African Mine Workers' Union strike is said to have led to the formation of the Northern Rhodesian African Mineworkers' Union in 1949 as a cornerstone of the anti-apartheid movement. =Political power= As with race, for some incidents there is no clear distinction between anti- union violence and political suppression. Polish labor unions were centrally involved in workers‚Äô uprisings and/or general strikes that challenged the sitting governments in 1905, 1923, and 1937. In a similar way the strike of Asturian miners in 1934, put down by right-wing Spanish government forces with great loss of life, amounted to an insurrection through work stoppage, not an economic labor action. Unions continued to play a political and military role in the subsequent Spanish Civil War. Along with Franco in Spain, other totalitarian regimes in Europe brought their labor unions under government control, violently when necessary. After coming to power as chancellor in January 1933, Adolf Hitler declared May Day a national holiday, then on May 2, 1933 unexpectedly moved to outlaw labor unions as part of the Nazi \\"synchronization\\" process. Major unions such as the Allgemeiner Deutscher Gewerkschaftsbund were raided that day, their accounts seized, and their leaders (Gustav Schiefer, Wilhelm Leuschner, Erich Luebbe) arrested and sent to concentration camps. (The bodies of four murdered trade union officials in Duisburg were only found a year later, in April 1934.) Every worker in the nation was then compelled to join the single party-controlled union, the German Labour Front. Similar coercive violence was exercised against labor unions in conquered nations, as in the Netherlands in 1941.  Types of violence  Some anti-union violence appears to be random, such as an incident during the 1912 textile strike in Lawrence, Massachusetts, in which a police officer fired into a crowd of strikers, killing Anna LoPizzo.William Dudley Haywood, Autobiography of Big Bill Haywood, 1929, page 249 Anti-union violence may be used as a means to intimidate others, as in the hanging of union organizer Frank Little from a railroad trestle in Butte, Montana. A note was pinned to his body which said, \\"Others Take Notice! First And Last Warning!\\" The initial of the last names of seven well-known union activists in the Butte area were on the note, with the \\"L\\" for Frank Little circled.Melvyn Dubofsky, We Shall Be All, A History of the Industrial Workers of the World, University of Illinois Press Abridged, 2000, pages 223-224Peter Carlson, Roughneck, The Life and Times of Big Bill Haywood, 1983, pages 17, 248-249 Anti-union violence may be abrupt and unanticipated. Three years after Frank Little was lynched, a strike by Butte miners was suppressed with gunfire when deputized mine guards suddenly fired upon unarmed picketers in the Anaconda Road Massacre. Seventeen were shot in the back as they tried to flee, and one man died.Mary Murphy, Mining cultures: men, women, and leisure in Butte, 1914-41, University of Illinois Press, 1997, page 33 Other anti-union violence may seem orchestrated, as in 1914 when mine guards and the state militia fired into a tent colony of striking miners in Colorado, an incident that came to be known as the Ludlow Massacre.Zinn, H. \\"The Ludlow Massacre\\", A People's History of the United States. pgs 346‚Äì349 During that strike, the company hired the Baldwin Felts agency, which built an armored car so their agents could approach the strikers' tent colonies with impunity. The strikers called it the \\"Death Special\\". At the Forbes tent colony, > \\"[The Death Special] opened fire, a protracted spurt that sent some six > hundred bullets tearing through the thin tents. One of the shots struck > miner Luka Vahernik, fifty, in the head, killing him instantly. Another > striker, Marco Zamboni, eighteen ... suffered nine bullet wounds to his > legs... One tent was later found to have about 150 bullet holes...\\"Scott > Martelle, Blood Passion, Rutgers University Press, 2008, page 98 Sometimes, there is simultaneous violence on both sides. In an auto workers strike organised by Victor Reuther and others in 1937, \\"[u]nionists assembled rocks, steel hinges, and other objects to throw at the cops, and police organized tear gas attacks and mounted charges.\\"Nelson Lichtenstein, Walter Reuther: the most dangerous man in Detroit, University of Illinois Press, 1997, page 101 There have been cases where violence has been perpetrated or encouraged by agents of management, intending it to be blamed on the union.Robert Hunter, Violence and the labor movement, Macmillan, 1914 (1919 version), page 317  Violence by country = Europe = Depiction of the 1902 Belgium general strike, by Henri Meurnier ;Belgium * the Belgian general strike of 1902 was led by the coal miners of Li√®ge, lasting 10 to 20 days and killing about 12 ;Russia * in the Lena massacre hundreds of striking goldfield workers were killed by tsarist government forces in northeast Siberia near the Lena River on ;United Kingdom * on 17 May 1869, a labor action of Welsh colliers (forcibly delivering the mine's new operator to the police station) developed into The Mold Riot, a confrontation between a mob of 1500 workers and citizens, versus King's Own Royal Regiment.

Rosvall and Voutilainen were murdered for their pro-union efforts resulting in the authorities in Thunder Bay conducting a major cover up in an attempt to conceal the truth.

The Trades Hall was the headquarters of a number of trade unions, and it is most commonly assumed that they were the target of the bombing, although other theories have been put forward. Ernie Abbott, the building's caretaker, was killed when he attempted to move the suitcase, which is believed to have contained three sticks of gelignite triggered by a mercury switch.Minchin, William (2005) To this day, the perpetrator has never been identified. Those elements of the New Zealand Police responsible for preventing and investigating such crimes were headquartered in the building across the street.

Mazzucato became the first woman to give the Ra√∫l Prebisch Lecture organised by the United Nations Economic Commission for Latin America and the Caribbean in Santiago, Chile, in April 2016. She is also a regular contributor to Project Syndicate since 2015.  Research  Mazzucato's research focuses on the relationship between financial markets, innovation and economic growth ‚Äì at the company, industry and national level. She works within the Schumpeterian framework of evolutionary economics, studying the origin and evolution of persistent differences between firms and how these differences vary across sectors and over the industry life-cycle. Her empirical studies have focused on the automobile, PC, biotech and pharma industries. Her most recent work has analyzed the co-evolution of technological change and stock market bubbles. In this, she claims that stock price volatility tends to be highest at the firm and industry level, when technological innovation is the most \\"radical\\". In 2013 Mazzucato published The Entrepreneurial State: debunking public vs. private sector myths (Anthem). The ideas in the book were first set out in a shorter pamphlet for the think tank Demos, called The Entrepreneurial State. The 2013 book argues that the idea of the State as a static bureaucratic organisation only needed to ‚Äòfix‚Äô market failures, leaving dynamic entrepreneurship and innovation to the private sector, is wrong. She outlines a number of case studies across different sectors, including biotech, pharmaceuticals and clean technology, to show that the high-risk investments are being made by the state before the private sector gets involved. In a chapter examining the iPhone, she outlines how the technologies that make it ‚Äòsmart‚Äô ‚Äì the internet, GPS, its touchscreen display and the voice-activated Siri ‚Äì were all Government funded. Two chapters in the book are dedicated to the emerging ‚Äògreen technology‚Äô revolution. She details the public funds that she argues are laying the groundwork for this revolution in a similar way that the state invested in the most high-risk areas of biotech and nanotech. The book concludes with the author's contention that in all these examples, the risks were socialized while the rewards were privatized, and considers different ways to change this dynamic to produce more ‚Äòinclusive growth‚Äô. In 2015 a US edition was published by PublicAffairs that included a new introduction. Her 2015 article in Foreign Affairs provides a summary of the book and outlines its implications for the public sector sharing not only risks, but also rewards.\\"‚ÄòThe Innovative State‚Äô\\", Foreign Affairs, Jan/Feb 2015 She has also focused on inequality in her work with William Lazonick (Professor and Director of the University of Massachusetts Center for Industrial Competitiveness). Their joint article, \\"The Risk-Reward Nexus: Who takes the risks? Who gets the rewards?\\" for a special issue of Corporate and Industrial Change, edited by Mazzucato, describes the tension between how value is created and how value is extracted in modern-day capitalism. The authors argue that there is a disproportionate balance between the 'collective' distribution of risk taking in the innovation process, and the increasingly narrow distribution of the rewards. The paper was first published in a 2012 paper for the think tank Policy Network.M. (2012), Policy Network, The Risk-Reward Nexus: The Risk-Reward Nexus: Innovation, Finance and Inclusive Growth Similarly, in another paper for the think tank Policy Network called \\"Rebalancing What?\\", Mazzucato argues that the problem is not only one of short-termism, it is also about the way in which financial activities focused on value extraction have been rewarded above activities focused on value creation ‚Äì often leading to value destruction.Mazzucato, M. (2012), Policy Network, Rebalancing What?: Reforming finance for creative destruction not destructive creation In her recent work, since 2014, Mazzucato has developed her critique of \\"market failure theory\\" and her concept of the state's role in the economy as one of \\"creating and shaping new markets\\" rather than just fixing them. Her work with Carlota Perez has considered how such a view can enable a new understanding of ‚Äògreen‚Äô as a redirection of the entire economy. Her work with Caetano Penna has focussed on the way in which a mission oriented market shaping framework can provide a new understanding of the role of state investment banks. Her new book The Value of Everything: making and taking in the global economy was published in April 2018 in the UK by Penguin (Allen Lane), and was launched in the US in September 2018 by Public Affairs. It has been shortlisted for this year's Financial Times and McKinsey Business Book of the Year prize.  Awards and nominations  In 2013, Mazzucato's book Entrepreneurial State was listed in Financial Times Selection of Books of the Year. The book also won her the New Statesman/SPERI Prize in Political Economy in the next year. In 2014, she was nominated for the IPEG Book Prize and the Industry & Innovation DRUID Award for Best Paper for her novel thinking in understanding the roles of the state in public policy and innovation. In the same year, a German translation of The Entrepreneurial State (Das Kapital des Staates) was shortlisted for the \\"German Business Book Prize\\" (‚ÄúDeutscher Wirtschaftsbuchpreis‚Äù). In 2015, she was awarded the Hans Matth√∂fer German book prize by the German political foundation Friedrich Ebert Foundation. She was awarded a Doctor Honoris Causa Award by National University of San Mart√≠n and a Doctor Honoris Causa by Simon Fraser University in 2016. She was also awarded a Doctor Honoris Causa by Hasselt University in 2017. In 2018, her research focused on how governments foster innovation won her the Leontief Prize for Advancing the Frontiers of Economic Thought. In 2019, she was awarded the All European Academies Madame de Sta√´l Prize for Cultural Values, honoring her contributions for analyzing the governments' roles in fostering innovation.\\"https://www.allea.org/economist-mariana-mazzucato-winner-of- the-2019-madame-de-stael-prize/\\"  Reception  Critics have argued that Mazzucato offers a confused definition of \\"public goods,\\" which is a \\"crucial point,\\" since \\"the non-rivalrous and non-excludable nature [of public goods] make them difficult to profit from providing,\\" and thus the private sector cannot, by definition, be interested in them.\\"The Intellectual Hole At The Heart Of Mariana Mazzucato's Entrepreneurial State\\" by Tim Worstall, Forbes, December 15, 2013 Others claim that she is \\"too hard on business\\"\\"The entrepreneurial state\\", The Economist, August 31, 2013 but acknowledge that \\"she is right to argue that the state has played a central role in producing game-changing breakthroughs, and that its contribution to the success of technology-based businesses should not be underestimated.\\" Martin Wolf wrote that The Entrepreneurial State offers \\"a controversial thesis,\\" but \\"it is basically right,\\"\\"A much-maligned engine of innovation\\" by Martin Wolf, Financial Times, August 4, 2013 and warns that the \\"failure to recognise the role of the government in driving innovation may well be the greatest threat to rising prosperity.\\" Another critic stated that \\"it is one thing to legitimize the state as a driver of innovation and give credit where credit is due ‚Äì something [Mazzucato's] book does masterfully\\", but \\"it is another thing altogether to craft effective innovation policy that deals with risk in a politically acceptable way.\\"\\"Winners only the state can pick: Mariana Mazzucato's The Entrepreneurial State\\" by Robert D.

The population of Loverna was 5 at the 2001 Canada Census. The hamlet is approximately 50 km north west of the Town of Kindersley at the intersection of Highway 772 and Range road 290. The Grand Trunk Pacific played a big role in the town's economy when it was completed in 1913 on its way from Biggar, SK to Hemaruka, AB. The line was planned as a thorough route, however the planned connection to another line under construction at the time to Spondin, AB was never finished. The track was lightly built and poorly maintained and so could only support boxcars and lightweight hopper cars for grain loading. As well the line was restricted to special lightweight GMD-1 locomotives. During the drastic closure of uneconomic branch lines in the late 1970s and '80s the tracks west from Smiley through Loverna were closed. The Canadian Pacific Railway took over operation of the remaining track from a connection on their line at Dodsland to Smiley. This too was closed in 1996, and Loverna's population has since declined. History  Prior to March 10, 2003, Loverna was incorporated under village status, but was restructured as a hamlet under the jurisdiction of the Rural municipality of Antelope Park on that date. Demographics In 2001, Loverna had a population of 5 living in 9 dwellings, a -58.3% decrease from 1996. The village had a land area of and a population density of .

Eligible technologies for the ITC are solar water heat, solar space heat, solar thermal electric, solar thermal process heat, photovoltaics, wind, biomass, geothermal electric, fuel cells, geothermal heat pumps, CHP/cogeneration, solar hybrid lighting, microturbines, and geothermal direct-use. This program is co-administered by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) and the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE). The tax credits were expanded by the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 and most components will last until December 31, 2016.  History of energy tax credits  The history of federal energy tax policy can be divided into four eras: the oil and gas period from 1916 to 1970, the energy crisis period of the 1970s, the free market era of the Reagan Administration, and the post-Reagan era. The United States federal energy tax policy historically focused on the increased production of oil and natural gas with no focus on alternative energy or conservation. Two policies were the driving force that allowed this policy to become successful. The first was expending of intangible drilling costs (IDCs). This allowed companies to write off costs such as labor costs, material costs, supplies, and repairs associated with drilling a well which allowed companies to write off their start up costs to make a profit in their start up year. The second policy was a depletion allowance that allowed oil and gas producers to claim 27.5% of revenue as a deduction for the cost of exhaustion or depletion of the deposit. This allowed for reduced capital investment and encouraged businesses to develop their resource faster. Oil and gas production increased from 16% of total U.S. energy production in 1920 to 71.1% of total energy production in 1970. . Large revenue losses associated with the oil and gas tax preferences compared to federal deficit cuts, the oil embargo of 1973, and the Iranian Revolution from 1978-1979 led to a shift in energy policy to alternative energy and conservation. The first major change was the reduction of IDCs and percent depletion for the oil and gas companies. The second change was the implementation of the Energy Tax Act of 1978 which started taxing cars with sub par fuel economy. New energy tax credits were also placed. Examples include investment in conservation or alternative fuels technologies, such as synthetic fuels, solar, wind, geothermal, and biomass. There was also tax credits for production of alcohol fuels, percentage depletion for geothermal deposits, and exempting facilities that turned solid waste into fuel from federal taxation of interest. The Reagan Administration brought along a more neutral stance on energy tax policy that did not promote oil and gas development, energy conservation, or the supply of alternative fuels. This would allow true oil prices that were very high to be shown and would encourage private investment in alternative energy development. The tax credits previously put in place were not renewed and only the tax credits for business solar, geothermal, ocean thermal, and biomass technologies were extended. This however resulted in negative effective tax rates for many investments, including alternative energy investments. The lowered tax credits for oil and gas were still high enough to make those investments a more attractive option.  Current energy tax policy  On June 28, 2005, the Senate approved an expansive energy bill with an 11-year, $18.6 billion package of energy tax breaks with a renewed focus toward renewable energy resources and conservation. Tax credits were introduced for Solar Water Heat, Solar Space Heat, Solar Thermal Electric, Solar Thermal Process Heat, Photovoltaics, Wind, Biomass, Geothermal Electric, Fuel Cells, Geothermal Heat Pumps, CHP/Cogeneration, Solar Hybrid Lighting, Microturbines, and Geothermal Direct-Use. These tax credits were greatly expanded in 2008 as part of the Energy Improvement and Extension Act of 2008. The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 is the latest expansion of energy tax credits and has laid out the framework of tax credit policy until 31 December 2016..  Incentives = Solar = Technologies that directly convert solar energy to electric, heat water, and heat space are included in the tax credit. Solar credits do not have a maximum. 30% of all expenditures can be included in the credit. Eligible technologies for the solar credit are equipment that uses solar energy to generate electricity, to heat or cool (or provide hot water for use in) a structure, or to provide solar process heat. Hybrid lighting systems that use fiber optics to distribute light and illuminate the inside of a building are also eligible for the credit. Passive solar systems and solar pool heating systems are not included in the credit. = Wind = Wind technologies include any turbine that uses the flow of air to generate electricity. Wind credits are for small turbines that generate up to 100 kW. There was no original max credit for wind turbines, but after 2008 the maximum credit was set at $4,000. The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 removed the maximum credit for wind turbines so there is currently no maximum credit. = Fuel cells = A fuel cell is an electrochemical cell that converts chemical energy from a fuel into electric energy. The credit is equal to 30% of expenditures, with no maximum credit. However, the credit for fuel cells is capped at $1,500 per 0.5 kilowatt (kW) of capacity. Eligible property includes fuel cells with a minimum capacity of 0.5 kW that have an electricity-only generation efficiency of 30% or higher. = Microturbines = A microturbine is a small turbine that is generally used for combined heat and power, and distributed power applications. The credit is equal to 10% of expenditures, with no maximum credit limit stated. The credit for microturbines is capped at $200 per kW of capacity. Eligible property includes microturbines up to two megawatts in capacity that have an electricity only generation efficiency of 26% or higher. = Combined heat and power = Combined heat and power is the use of a heat engine or a power station to simultaneously generate both electricity and useful heat. The credit is equal to 10% of expenditures, with no maximum. Combined heat and power systems must exceed 60% energy efficiency to be included in the credit. The max amount of power the system can generate is 50 megawatts to meet the credit requirements. The efficiency requirement does not apply to combined heat and power systems that use biomass for at least 90% of the system's energy source, but the credit may be reduced for less-efficient systems. = Geothermal systems = Geothermal for businesses is using the earth as a heat and cooling source to lower the cost of air conditioning and heating. The credit is equal to 10% of expenditures, with no maximum credit limit stated. Eligible geothermal energy property includes geothermal heat pumps and equipment used to produce, distribute or use energy derived from a geothermal deposit. For electricity produced by geothermal power, equipment qualifies only up to, but not including, the electric transmission stage.

The Cassville Democrat focuses on local issues and news and has little national or international coverage.  Coverage area and competitors  While the Cassville Democrat is located in the town of Cassville, its coverage extends across Barry County to most of the smaller towns and hamlets that do not have any independent traditional news services. In addition, it has not been alone in its local news coverage, as for a nearly 20-year period between 1967 and 1984, there were no less than three weekly newspapers operating out of Cassville, a town with a population of less than 3,000, and providing coverage to people across the county. Of those two competing papers, the Cassville Republican and the Barry County Advertiser, only the Barry County Advertiser continues to this day, with the 106-year-old Republican closing in 1984. As the names signify, during their prime, the Cassville Democrat espoused and promoted the views of the Democratic Party while the Cassville Republican did the same for the Republican Party, creating a fierce political climate in the small town.Ozarks Editors; Guardians and Gadflies - Politicians and Promoters - Preachers and Teachers By Robert Gilmore; Vol. VII, No. 1, Summer 1993 Since that time, the Cassville Democrat has shred its former political affiliation and instead focuses on being the primary local news source.  Ownership history  The Cassville Democrat was established in 1871 by John Ray, a native of Barren County, Kentucky, who moved to Barry County in 1850. Ray had been a surgeon in the Union army during the Civil War. He would publish the Cassville Democrat until his death in 1889. Following Ray's death, his son Charles Ray took over as editor and publisher of the paper and continued in that role until his own death in 1926. During his time as publisher, Charles Ray also served two terms as county treasurer, and was postmaster of Cassville under the Cleveland administration.Biographies of Cole County Persons; http://www.colecohistsoc.org/bios/bio_qr.html Charles Ray's wife, Jennie Pharis Ray, and sons John and Means Ray took over the responsibilities of the newspaper following his death.Barry County Missouri - Edward & Mary Russell Easley of Eagle Rock; Eventually, ownership of the paper moved on to Bob Mitchell, Charles Ray's grandson through his youngest daughter, Katherine.

The adoption of the resolution came as Afghan President Hamid Karzai announced that seven locations in Afghanistan would be transferred from coalition to Afghan control. Observations The Council recognised that there was no purely military solution to the situation in Afghanistan and reiterated its support to the Afghan people in rebuilding their country. Support was given to the Kabul International Conference held on July 22, 2010. It was stressed that the central role of the United Nations in Afghanistan was promoting peace and stability by leading the efforts of the international community. The Council also welcomed the continued commitment of the international community to support the stability and development of the country, particularly those that were increasing civilian and humanitarian efforts to assist the Government of Afghanistan and its people. The resolution welcomed an agreement between the International Security Assistance Force (ISAF) and the Afghan government to transfer lead security responsibilities to the Afghan security forces by the end of 2014. The Council also recognised the interconnected nature of the challenges in Afghanistan with regards to progress on security, governance, human rights, the rule of law and development, as well as the issues of anti‚Äëcorruption, counter-narcotics and transparency. The need for greater co- operation between United Nations and international agencies was noted. Also important to the Council was the humanitarian situation in the country and the delivery and co-ordination of humanitarian assistance, while all attacks against humanitarian workers were condemned. Concern was expressed at the security situation in the country in particular the increased violent and terrorist activities by the Taliban, Al-Qaeda, illegally armed groups, criminals and those involved in the narcotics trade. Acts UNAMA's mandate, as set out in resolutions 1662 (2006), 1746 (2007), 1806 (2008), 1868 (2009) and 1917 was extended until March 23, 2012. It was also guided by the principle of reinforcing Afghan ownership with a particular focus on: :(a) promoting more coherent international support for the Government's development and governance priorities; :(b) strengthening co-operation with international security forces as recommended in a report by the Secretary-General Ban Ki- moon; :(c) providing political outreach and good offices to support the implementation of the Afghan-led reconciliation and reintegration programmes; :(d) supporting as well as taking into account progress on electoral reform; :(e) working in co-operation with the Special Representative of the Secretary- General in a variety of areas. It also stressed the importance of strengthening and expanding the presence of UNAMA and other United Nations entities, and encouraged the Secretary-General to continue his current efforts to take measures to address the security issues associated with such strengthening and expansion. The Council also addressed tackling opium production, respect for human rights, protection of humanitarian workers, demining, regional co-operation, refugees and enhancing the capabilities of the Afghan National Police and Afghan National Army. It also condemned terrorist activities and attacks on humanitarian workers, and welcomed efforts to improve the security situation.

The order was circumscribed in 2010 to contain mostly resupinate (crust-like) forms that have been referred to genera Anomoporia, Amyloathelia, Amylocorticiellum, Amylocorticium, Amyloxenasma, Anomoloma, Athelia, Athelopsis, Ceraceomyces, Hypochniciellum, Leptosporomyces and Serpulomyces. Phylogenetics The order contains one of three assemblages of basal lineages of Agaricomycetidae that contain corticioid fungi; the others are the Jaapiales and the Atheliales. Although several molecular studies have confirmed the placement of the Amylocorticiales in the Agaricomycetidae, its relationship with other higher- level taxa is not known precisely. Depending on the loci used for analysis, the order is supported as sister group to the Agaricales, or as sister to a clade that contains the Agaricales, Boletales and Atheliales. Description Species in the Amylocorticiales form fruit bodies that are effused (stretched out flat like a film-like growth), effused-reflexed (stretched out but with edges curled up) to almost pileate (with a cap), or stipitate (with a stipe). They have smooth hymenophores that can be either merulioid (wrinkled with low, uneven ridges), irpicoid (with \\"teeth\\") or poroid (with pores). The hyphal system is monomitic (containing only generative hyphae) and all hyphae are nodose-septate (with nodes and septa). The cystidia are rare and when present, are tube-like and often nodose-septate. The basidia (spore-bearing cells) are mostly terminal but in one genus borne laterally on horizontal hyphae (pleurobasidia), invariably producing four spores. The basidiospores are smooth, thin-walled or thick-walled, ellipsoid, cylindrical or allantoid (sasuage-shaped), in most species amyloid. Taxa that do not exhibit amyloid reactions include Ceraceomyces, Podoserpula, Serpulomyces and Leptosporomyces septentrionalis. Species are saprobic on decaying wood or as plant parasites. Amylocorticiales typically cause brown rot or white rot. Genera Podoserpula pusio is an exception to the typically resupinate fruit body form characteristic of the Amylocorticiales. *Anomoporia *Amyloathelia *Amylocorticiellum *Amylocorticium *Amyloxenasma *Anomoloma *Athelopsis *Ceraceomyces *Hypochniciellum *Irpicodon *Leptosporomyces *Plicaturopsis *Podoserpula *Serpulomyces ReferencesExternal links * Basidiomycota orders ","title":"Amylocorticiales"},{"id":"31295123","text":"Histori me zhurmues () is a show on Klan TV about communist histories.

Blanquism and the International Edme Marie Gustave Tridon was born in Ch√¢tillon-sur-Seine on January 1, 1841. He came from a very wealthy family. Although he studied law and obtained all his professional qualifications, he never actually practised law, due to his independent wealth. As a student Tridon became a radical republican and an opponent of the Second Empire of Napol√©on III. He became a convinced atheist, considering atheism the highest achievement of scientific reason, a metaphysical materialist and a revolutionary socialist. Among the figures of the first French Revolution, he most admired Jacques-Ren√© H√©bert (1757‚Äì1794), the Parisian sans-colotte leader who was guillotined by the Jacobins. Tridon published two books on the H√©bertists: The H√©bertists: Protest Against a Historical Calumny (1864) and The Commune of 1793: The H√©bertists (1871). He also published a history of the Girondists, The Gironde and the Girondists (1869). In addition, Tridon was a glowing French patriot. Tridon's views in all these matters corresponded closely to the veteran revolutionary Louis Auguste Blanqui. Tridon first met Blanqui in the Sainte- P√©lagie prison in 1865; Tridon had been incarcerated there for writing anti- religious articles that were deemed contrary to morality. He became a close friend and follower of Blanqui. After his release, Tridon founded the journal Candide in 1865. Tridon financed the paper, which served as a platform for Blanqui and his associates. Blanqui himself contributed articles under a pseudonym. The paper was eventually shut down by the authorities, and Tridon was jailed again. In 1866, he joined the First International, one of the first Blanquists to do so. (Some Blanquists were wary of the International because its French section was dominated by syndicalists, Mutualists and Proudhonists, whom they considered insufficiently revolutionary.) Tridon was one of six French Blanquists who attended the Geneva congress of the First International in 1866; he acted as Blanqui's representative. Tridon and his fellow Blanquists angrily denounced the Proudhonist majority of the French delegation as agents of Napol√©on III. The Blanquists were thrown out of the congress, but they earned the gratitude of Karl Marx, whose feud with Proudhon dated back to the 1840s. On his return to France from the International congress, Tridon was arrested. He remained in prison until 1868. Imprisonment, however, did not stop his publicistic activities. He founded the journal Revue, among others, and contributed articles to several other journals. In January 1870, he was implicated in a political trial at Blois; fearing imminent arrest, he went to Brussels. The Paris Commune Although Tridon detested the r√©gime of Napol√©on III, he was a passionate advocate of national defence during the Franco-Prussian War of 1870-71. In 1870 he founded the journal La Patrie en Danger (The Fatherland in Danger), another Blanquist mouthpiece. In its pages, Tridon sharply attacked the government of Napol√©on III for prosecuting the war so badly. Tridon returned to France after Napol√©on III fell from power. He strongly opposed the peace negotiations with Germany carried out by the conservative republican government of Adolphe Thiers. On October 31, 1870, the Blanquists led an unsuccessful uprising against the Thiers government, but Tridon avoided imprisonment. In January 1871, as Paris lay besieged by the German army, Tridon collaborated with √âdouard Vaillant, Jules Vall√®s and others in writing the Affiche rouge (red poster), which denounced the Thiers government, called for the establishment of an autonomous Paris Commune and put forward three main demands: general requisitioning of all human and material resources, free rations for all, and fighting to the utmost against the siege. Tridon joined the Republican Central Committee of the Twenty Districts, in which Blanquists, Proudhonists, Jacobins and various other radicals, who had until recently been rivals, collaborated. In February 1871, Tridon ran as a candidate in elections to the National Assembly and was elected as a deputy for the C√¥te-d'Or. He voted against the peace treaty with Germany signed by the Thiers government, then resigned his seat and returned to Paris. In March, he was elected to the Council of the Commune by the fifth arrondissement. He sat on the Commune's Executive Commission as well as on the Commission of War. Tridon was among the minority in the Council who voted against the creation of a Committee of Public Safety, modelled on that of the first French Revolution, which had unleashed the terror. Tridon's opposition to the Committee of Public Safety made him a strange bedfellow of many of his erstwhile rivals, Proudhonists like Eug√®ne Varlin, and put him at odds with Jacobin socialists like F√©lix Pyat and Th√©ophile Ferr√©, whose ideology might on the whole have seemed closer to his own. Perhaps Tridon's sympathy for the H√©bertists, who had been victims of the first Committee of Public Safety, motivated his opposition to its revival. Apparently Tridon had long been suffering from some sort of nervous disorder; the massacres of the Bloody Week (Semaine sanglante) precipitated an emotional crisis. Tridon escaped from Paris and fled to Brussels, where he died on August 29, 1871. Apparently his death was a suicide. Anti-Semitism Anti-Semitic opinions were widespread in nineteenth century Europe and can be found in the writings of many French socialists of the period as well. Usually, however, these were private expressions of prejudice. Proudhon, for example, complained in his diaries that France was overrun with Jews and foreigners, while Blanqui, in his letters, sometimes used the term 'shylock' as a synonym for capitalist or usurer.Cp. Green, N.L., 'Socialist Anti-Semitism, Defense of a Bourgeois Jew and Discovery of the Jewish Proletariat: Changing Attitudes of French Socialists Before 1914.' In: International Review of Social History (1985), 30: pp. 374-399. However, in the late nineteenth century, some veterans of the previous revolutionary movements expressed a more vehement and public anti- Semitism, usually combined with fierce nationalism. This ideological mixture‚Äînationalism, anti-Semitism and social radicalism‚Äîpaved the way for the French fascist movements of the twentieth century. The high-water mark of this revolutionary anti-Semitism came during the Dreyfus affair of the 1890s, when some former republican revolutionaries, including some Blanquist veterans like Ernest Granger, sided with the anti-Dreyfusards. These events occurred long after Tridon's death. Nevertheless, he had a posthumous influence on them, primarily through a manuscript he had written but not published in his lifetime: Du Molochisme Juif: √âtudes Critiques et Philosophiques (On Jewish Molochism: Critical and Philosophical Studies.) This book was published in 1884, and was cited as an influence by such apostles of French anti-Semitism as √âdouard Drumont. In the book, Tridon proclaimed the superiority of 'Indo- Aryan' over 'Semitic' culture and traced Judaism back to the ancient worship of the god Moloch, who, he claims, demanded human sacrifice. Christianity and Islam, as derivatives of Judaism, are also condemned; by contrast, 'Aryan' culture and western civilization are said to have culminated in the scientific rationalism of the Enlightenment and its corresponding atheism. Tridon also associates Judaism with capitalism and exploitation. Tridon's posthumous screed thus makes for a mixed legacy. Writers who value his contributions to French socialism tend not to dwell on the Moloch book, while Tridon's anti- Semitism makes him one of the patron saints of far right movements that have much less use for his involvement in such organisations as the First International.

Elliot, \\"Boniface, Incest, and the Earliest Extant Version of Pope Gregory I‚Äôs Libellus responsionum (JE 1843)\\", in Zeitschrift der Savigny-Stiftung f√ºr Rechtsgeschichte: Kanonistische Abteilung 100 (2014), pp. 62‚Äì111, at pp. 62‚Äì73. It has since been shown, however, that this hypothesis was based on incomplete evidence and historical misapprehensions. In particular, twentieth-century scholarship focused on the presence in the Libellus of what appeared to be an impossibly lax rule regarding consanguinity and marriage, a rule that (it was thought) Gregory could not possibly have endorsed. It is now known that this rule is not in fact as lax as historians had thought, and moreover that the rule is fully consistent with Gregory's style and mode of thought.K. Ubl, Inzestverbot und Gesetzgebung: die Konstruktion eines Verbrechens (300‚Äì1100), Millennium- Studien 20 (Berlin, 2008), pp. 219‚Äì51; Elliot, \\"Boniface, Incest, and the Earliest Extant Version\\", pp. 73‚Äì96. Today, Gregory I's authorship of the Libellus is generally accepted.P. Meyvaert, \\"Diversity within unity, a Gregorian theme\\", in The Heythrop journal 4 (1963), pp. 141‚Äì62; B. M√ºller, F√ºhrung im Denken und Handeln Gregors des Grossen, Studien und Texte zu Antike und Christentum 57 (T√ºbingen, 2009), pp. 341‚Äì62. The question of authenticity aside, manuscript and textual evidence indicates that the document was being transmitted in Italy by perhaps as early as the beginning of the seventh century (i.e. shortly after Gregory I's death in 604), and in England by the end of the same century. Creation The Libellus is a reply by Pope Gregory I to questions posed by Augustine of Canterbury about certain disciplinary, administrative, and sacral problems he was facing as he tried to establish a bishopric amongst the Kentish people following the initial success of the Gregorian mission in 596.J. M. Wallace-Hadrill, Bede's Ecclesiastical History of the English People: A Historical Commentary (Oxford, 1988), p. 37. Modern historians, including Ian Wood and Rob Meens, have seen the Libellus as indicating that Augustine had more contact with native British Christians than is indicated by Bede's narrative in the Historia Ecclesiastica.I. Wood, Ian, \\"Augustine and Aidan: Bureaucrat and Charismatic?\\", in L'√âglise et la Mission au VIe Si√®cle: La Mission d'Augustin de Cantorb√©ry et les √âglises de Gaule sous L'Impulsion de Gr√©goire le Grand Actes du Colloque d'Arles de 1998 (Paris, 2000), p. 170; R. Meens, \\"A Background to Augustine's Mission to Anglo-Saxon England\\", in: Anglo-Saxon England 23 (1994), 5‚Äì17, at p. 13. Augustine's original questions (no longer extant) would have been sent to Rome around 598, but Gregory's reply (i.e. the Libellus) was delayed some years due to illness, and was not composed until perhaps the summer of 601.F. M. Stenton, Anglo-Saxon England, 3rd edition (Oxford, 1971), pp. 106‚Äì107 The Libellus may have been brought back to Augustine by Laurence and Peter, along with letters to the king of Kent and his wife and other items for the mission.Stenton, Anglo-Saxon England, p. 109 However, some scholars have suggested that the Libellus may in fact never have reached its intended recipient (Augustine) in Canterbury.P. Meyvaert, \\"Le Libellus responsionum √† Augustin de Cantorb√©ry: une oeuvre authentique de Saint Gr√©goire le Grand\\", in Gr√©goire le Grand: actes de le Colloque international du Centre national de la recherche scientifique, Chantilly, Centre culturel Les Fontaines, 15‚Äì 19 septembre 1982, eds J. Fontaine, R. Gillet, and S. Pellistrandi (Paris, 1986), pp. 543‚Äì50; Elliot, \\"Boniface, Incest, and the Earliest Extant Version\\", p. 101. Paul Meyvaert, for example, has noted that no early Anglo-Saxon copy of the Libellus survives that is earlier than Bede's Historia ecclesiastica (c. 731), and Bede's copy appears to derive not from a Canterbury file copy but rather from a Continental canon law collection.Meyvaert, \\"Bede‚Äôs Text\\". This would be strange had the letter arrived in Canterbury in the first place. A document as important to the fledgling mission and to the history of the Canterbury church as the Libellus is likely to have been protected and preserved quite carefully by Canterbury scribes; yet this seems not to have been the case. Meyvaert therefore suggested that the Libellus may have been waylaid on its journey north from Rome in 601, and only later arrived in England, long after Augustine's death.Meyvaert, \\"Le Libellus responsionum √† Augustin de Cantorb√©ry\\", pp. 547 and 550. This hypothesis is supported by the surviving manuscript and textual evidence, which strongly suggests that the Libellus circulated widely on the Continent for perhaps nearly a century before finally arriving in England (see below). Still, the exact time, place, and vector by which the Libellus arrived in England and fell into the hands of Bede (and thence his Historia Ecclesiastica) is still far from certain, and scholars continue to explore these questions.For a recent assessment of these questions see Elliot, \\"Boniface, Incest, and the Earliest Extant Version\\", pp. 101‚Äì04. Title Gregory does not appear to have provided the Libellus with a title. This is not unusual since the work is a letter and Gregory was not in the habit of titling his many letters. \\"Libellus responsionum\\" is the name given the letter by Bede in his Historia Ecclesiastica,Bede, Historia Ecclesiastica, Book 2, chapter 1 (ed. Plummer, vol. I, p. 76). and most modern commentators translate Bede's nomenclature as \\"Little book of answers\\" or \\"Little book of responses\\". \\"Libellus\\" can also be translated as \\"letter\\";See C.T. Lewis and C. Short, A Latin Dictionary (Oxford, 1879), s.v., sense II.B.6. thus \\"Letter of answers\\" is another possible translation. Contents The Libellus consists of a series of responses (responsiones) by Gregory to \\"certain jurisprudential, administrative, jurisdictional, liturgical and ritual questions Augustine was confronted with as leader of the fledgling English church\\".Elliot, \\"Boniface, Incest, and the Earliest Extant Version\\", p. 65. The numbering and order of these responses differ across the various versions of the Libellus (see below). But in the most widely known version (that reproduced in Bede's Historia Ecclesiastica) there are nine responses, each of which begins by re-stating or paraphrasing Augustine's original questions.Bede, History of the English Church, pp. 71‚Äì83. Gregory's first response addresses questions about the relationship of a bishop to his clergy and vice versa, how gifts from the laity to the church should be divided amongst the clergy, and what the tasks of a bishop were.Bede, History of the English Church, p. 72. The second response addresses why the various northern European churches of which Augustine was aware had differing customs and liturgies, and what Augustine should do when he encounters such differences. The third response was in answer to questions about the proper punishment of church robbers.Bede, History of the English Church, p. 73. The fourth and fifth response deal with who might marry whom, including whether it was allowed for two brothers to marry two sisters, or for a man to marry his step- sister or step-mother. The sixth response addresses whether or not it was acceptable for a bishop to be consecrated without other bishops present, if the distances involved prevented other bishops from attending the ceremony.Bede, History of the English Church, pp. 74‚Äì5. The seventh response deals with relations between the church in England and the church in Gaul.Bede, History of the English Church, p. 76. The eighth response concerns what a pregnant, newly delivered, or menstruating woman might do or not do, including whether or not she is allowed to enjoy sex with her husband and how long after child-birth she has to wait to re-enter a church.Bede, History of the English Church, pp. 76‚Äì81. The last response answers questions about whether or not men might have communion after experiencing a sexual dream, and whether or not priests might celebrate mass after experiencing such dreams.Bede, History of the English Church, pp. 81‚Äì3. An additional chapter, not included by Bede in his Historia is known as the \\"Obsecratio\\": it contains a response by Gregory to Augustine's request for relics of the local British martyr Sixtus. Gregory responds that he is sending relics of Pope Sixtus II to replace the local saint's remains, as Gregory has doubts about the actual saintly status of the British martyr. Although the authenticity of the \\"Obsecratio\\" has occasionally been questioned, most modern historians accept that it is genuine.N. Brooks, The Early History of the Church of Canterbury: Christ Church from 597 to 1066 (London, 1984), p. 20. Later use In the early seventh century an augmented version of the Dionysian conciliar and decretal collections was assembled in Bobbio, in northern Italy.Elliot, \\"Boniface, Incest, and the Earliest Extant Version\\", pp. 97‚Äì9. To this canon law collection ‚Äî known today as the Collectio canonum Dionysiana BobiensisThis collection exists today in a single manuscript datable to the late ninth century: Milan, Biblioteca Ambrosiana, S. 33 sup. ‚Äîthere was appended at some time a long series of additional papal documents and letters, including the Libellus responsionum and Libellus synodicus. Some scholars date the addition of this series of documents to as early as the seventh century.P. Landau, \\"Kanonessammlungen in der Lombardei im fr√ºhen und hohen Mittelalter\\", in Atti dell‚Äô 11¬∞ congresso internazionale di studi sull‚Äôalto medioevo, Milano, 26‚Äì30 ottobre 1987, 2 vols. (Spoleto 1989), vol. I, pp. 425‚Äì57, at p. 428. Klaus Zechiel-Eckes has even suggested the first half of the seventh century as the date for when the addition was made, that is only shortly after the Bobiensis‚Äôs initial compilation and at most only fifty years after Gregory‚Äôs death.K. Zechiel-Eckes, ed., Die Concordia canonum des Cresconius, Studien und Edition, 2 vols., Freiburger Beitr√§ge zur mittelalterlichen Geschichte 5 (Frankfurt am Main 1992), vol. I, p. 81. If Zechiel-Eckes's dating is correct, it would make the Collectio Bobiensis the earliest surviving witness by far to the Libellus. How and when the Libellus eventually reached England is not clear. It is not known if the original letter ever reached Augustine, its intended recipient. Bede assumed that it had, though he is rather vague on specifics at this point.Bede, Historia Ecclesiastica, Book 2, chapter 1 (ed. Plummer, vol. I, p. 48): Nec mora, congrua quaesitui responsa recepit (\\"He soon received proper answers to his questions\\"). On the strength of Bede's word alone many later historians have claimed that the Libellus reached Augustine in a timely fashion;See, e.g., Stenton, Anglo-Saxon England, p. 109; P. H. Blair, The World of Bede (Cambridge, 1990), p. 64. however, as mentioned above, recent scholarship has brought this assumption into serious question. In any event, some version of the letter seems to have been available in England by the late seventh century, for it was then that it was quoted by Theodore of Tarsus, Archbishop of Canterbury, in a series of judgments known today as the Paenitentiale Theodori.R. Flechner, \\"The making of the Canons of Theodore\\", in Peritia 17‚Äì18 (2003‚Äì2004), pp. 121‚Äì43, at pp. 136‚Äì38. It is possible that Theodore found a copy of the Libellus already at Canterbury; however, given that no one in England previous to Theodore's archiepiscopacy seems to have known of the Libellus, it is equally plausible that the Libellus was one of the texts that Theodore brought with him from Italy when he arrived in Canterbury in 669. It is known that Theodore brought numerous books with him from Italy, and that at least one of these books was a canon law collection very much like the one prepared at Bobbio some decades earlier (i.e. the Bobiensis).M. Brett, \\"Theodore and the Latin Canon Law\\", in Archbishop Theodore: Commemorative Studies on His Life and Influence, Cambridge Studies in Anglo-Saxon England 11 (Cambridge, 1995), pp. 120‚Äì40, shows that Theodore used a collection of the type known as the \\"enlarged Dionysiana\\", which is just the type of collection that the Bobiensis is. Elliot has speculated that Theodore introduced a Bobiensis-type collection to Canterbury in the second half of the seventh century, and thereby finally delivered the Libellus (as part of the Bobbiensis) to its originally intended destination.Elliot, \\"Boniface, Incest, and the Earliest Extant Version\\", pp. 101‚Äì03. This hypothesis is supported by the fact that it was only shortly after Theodore's tenure at Canterbury that Anglo-Saxons begin to demonstrate knowledge of the Libellus.Elliot, \\"Boniface, Incest, and the Earliest Extant Version\\", pp. 103‚Äì04. Bede inserted the entire text of the Libellus into book I of his Historia Ecclesiastica (completed ca. 731), where it makes up the bulk of chapter 27.Wallace-Hadrill, Bede's Ecclesiastical History, pp. 37‚Äì38. Bede also appears to have relied upon the Libellus while writing his prose Vita Sancti Cuthberti in about the year 720.Blair, World of Bede, p. 70. Where Bede acquired his copy of the Libellus is not known, but it seems that by the early eighth century it was beginning to be read widely throughout northern England.For the suggestion that Archbishop Ecgberht of York may have known the Libellus, see Elliot, \\"Boniface, Incest, and the Earliest Extant Version\\", pp. 103 n. 120. In the later Middle Ages, the text of the Libellus was used to support the claims of the monks of the Canterbury Cathedral chapter that the chapter had always included monks, back to the founding of the cathedral by Augustine. But the Libellus does not explicitly say that the cathedral chapter should be composed of monks, only that the monks that were members of the chapter should live in common and have some other aspects of monastic life.Brooks, Early History of the Church of Canterbury, p. 90. Controversy over authenticity Twentieth-century scholarship's focus on the doubt expressed by Boniface regarding the authenticity of the Libellus has led to the widely held belief that a general atmosphere of suspicion surrounded the Libellus in the Middle Ages. In fact, Boniface appears to have been the only medieval personality to have ever expressed doubt about the authorship of this letter.Elliot, \\"Boniface, Incest, and the Earliest Extant Version\\", pp. 62‚Äì73. As missionary to the Germanic peoples of Europe and legate of the papal see, Boniface spent much of his later life in Continental Europe, where he encountered many canonical traditions that were unfamiliar to the Anglo-Saxons and that appeared to Boniface out of step with his knowledge of church tradition. The Libellus represented one such tradition. Boniface in fact had very practical reasons for questioning the Libellus. He had witnessed its recommendations being exploited by certain members of the Frankish nobility who claimed that the Libellus permitted them to enter into unions with their aunts, unions Boniface considered to be incestuous.Elliot, \\"Boniface, Incest, and the Earliest Extant Version\\", pp. 73‚Äì89. As is discussed below, these nobles, like Boniface and others in the eighth century, had misunderstood the language of the Libellus‚Ä≤ incest chapter, which they believed permitted two people of any relation to marry, as long as they were not in sibling or parent-child relationships. Eager to get to the bottom of this controversy, in 735 Boniface wrote to Nothhelm, the Archbishop of Canterbury, requesting Nothhelm send him Canterbury's own copy of the Libellus; presumably Boniface hoped that Canterbury (being the one-time residence of Augustine) possessed an authentic copy of the Libellus, one that perhaps preserved more ancient readings than the copies then circulating in France and Bavaria, and would therefore serve as a corrective to the Continental copies and the incestuous nobles who relied upon them. Boniface also requested Nothhelm's opinion on the document's authenticity, for his own inquiries at the papal archives had failed to turn up an official \\"registered\\" copy of the letter there. His failed attempt to locate a \\"registered\\" papal copy of the Libellus presumably suggested to Boniface the possibility that the document was spurious and had in fact not been authored by Pope Gregory I.Elliot, \\"Boniface, Incest, and the Earliest Extant Version\\", pp. 62‚Äì6. Boniface had specific concerns about the wording of the Libellus. At least three versions of the Libellus were circulating on the Continent during Boniface's lifetime, all of these within collections of canonical and penitential documents. Boniface is known to have encountered (perhaps even helped produce) at least one canon law collection ‚Äî the Collectio canonum vetus Gallica ‚Äî that included the \\"Q/A\\" version of the Libellus, and it is also possible that he knew of the Collectio Bobiensis, with its appended \\"Capitula\\" version of the Libellus.Elliot, \\"Boniface, Incest, and the Earliest Extant Version\\", p. 104. A third version of the Libellus known as the \\"Letter\\" version may also have been known to Boniface.Elliot, \\"Boniface, Incest, and the Earliest Extant Version\\", p. 105‚Äì09. There are slight differences in wording and chapter order between the three versions, but for the most part they are the same, with one important exception: the \\"Q/A\\" and \\"Capitula\\" versions contain a passage that discusses how closely a man and a woman can be related before they are prohibited from being married; the \\"Letter\\" version omits this passage. According to Karl Ubl and Michael D. Elliot, the passage in the \\"Q/A\\" and \\"Capitula\\" versions is authentic, and its absence from the \\"Letter\\" version represents a later modification of the text probably made in the mid-seventh century.Ubl, Inzestverbot, pp. 219‚Äì51; Elliot, \\"Boniface, Incest, and the Earliest Extant Version\\", pp. 90‚Äì6. The passage in the \\"Q/A\\" and \\"Capitula\\" versions has Gregory saying that those related within the second degree of kinship (including siblings, parents and their children, first cousins, and nephews/nieces and their aunts/uncles) are prohibited from marrying each other, but that church tradition sets no prohibition against marrying a more distant relation. However, Gregory used a method of reckoning degrees of kinship (or consanguinity) that was unfamiliar to many living in the mid- eighth century. Ubl has shown that Gregory's method of reckoning degrees of kinship was one that would come to be known as the \\"scriptural\\" or \\"canonical\\" method.Ubl, Inzestverbot, pp. 16‚Äì18. The notion that this method is based on an ancient Teutonic system of comparing lines of descent to joints on the body (and consequently dubbed by historians the \\"Germanic\\" method), is no longer accepted by historians: Ubl, Inzestverbot, pp. 18‚Äì21. Boniface, the papacy, and apparently most of Western Europe ca. 750 followed a different method of reckoning, known as the \\"Roman\\" method, whereby a restriction within the second degree merely precluded siblings from marrying each other and parents from marrying their children, and implicitly allowed all unions beyond these.See Elliot, \\"Boniface, Incest, and the Earliest Extant Version\\", pp. 84‚Äì6, and Ubl, Inzestverbot, pp. 14‚Äì27 and 219‚Äì51. The \\"Roman\\" system counts degrees of relatedness by adding together the number of generations that separate two individuals from their common stock; whereas the \\"canonical\\" reckons degrees of relatedness by counting the number of generations separating only one of the marriage partners from the common stock, specifically the partner who is furthest removed from that stock. Thus, for Gregory, being related \\"within the second degree\\" meant being first cousins (or any relationship closer than this); but for Boniface, being related \\"within the second degree\\" meant being brother and sister. Thus, Boniface (misinterpreting Gregory's \\"canonical\\" method of measuring kinship for a \\"Roman\\" one) took this passage in the Libellus to mean that Gregory permitted first cousins to marry each other and nephews/nieces to marry their aunts/uncles ‚Äî an opinion that Boniface (rightly) believed Gregory would not have held.Ubl, Inzestverbot, pp. 219‚Äì51; Elliot, \\"Boniface, Incest, and the Earliest Extant Version\\", pp. 73‚Äì96. Boniface seems to have been unable to correct his misunderstanding of the meaning of the Libellus on this point. But this was perhaps due as much to the fact that seventh- and eighth-century canonical authorities (especially popes) so frequently conflicted on this subject, as to Boniface's own interpretative error. In a long series of letters written to subsequent bishops of Rome ‚Äî Pope Gregory II, Pope Gregory III, Pope Zachary ‚Äî Boniface periodically brought up the issue of consanguinity and marriage, and each time he received a slightly different answer as to what was permitted and what was prohibited.Elliot, \\"Boniface, Incest, and the Earliest Extant Version\\", pp. 67‚Äì8 and 79‚Äì82. Suspicion about the authenticity of the Libellus seems to have ended with Boniface's death in 754, though misinterpretation of its chapter on consanguinity continued for long after that. Nevertheless, no medieval authority except Boniface is on record as ever having questioned the authenticity of the Libellus and its marriage chapter. In fact, there arose a vigorous tradition of forged documents that defended the authenticity of the Libellus and attempted to explain why it permitted, or (to those who followed the \\"Roman\\" system) seemed to permit, nieces to marry their uncles, or even first cousins to marry.Elliot, \\"Boniface, Incest, and the Earliest Extant Version\\", pp. 67‚Äì70. Boniface's doubts about the Libellus were revived in the twentieth century by several modern historians. In 1941 Suso Brechter made a study of the historical sources for Gregory the Great's Anglo-Saxon mission. In this study Brechter attempted to prove that the Libellus was an eighth-century forgery by Nothhelm. He believed that the Libellus contained too much that pertained specifically to eighth-century (rather than late sixth-century) theological concerns, i.e. the concerns of Nothhelm rather than Augustine. He argued that the forgery was completed in 731 and was foisted on Bede by Nothhelm in that year, making it a late insertion into Bede's Historia.Brechter, Die Quellen zur Angelsachsenmission, pp. 13‚Äì111. Brechter's work did not attract much scholarly interest until 1959, when Margaret Deanesly and Paul Grosjean wrote a joint journal article refuting or modifying most of Brechter's arguments about the Libellus. Deanesly and Grosjean thought that Nothhelm had collected genuine Gregorian letters, added to them material relating to theological questions current at Canterbury, and presented the finished product (or dossier) to Bede as a \\"Gregorian\\" work: what we now know as the Libellus responsionum. They further argued that Nothhelm did this in two stages: a first stage that they named the Capitula version,Not to be confused with Meyvaert's Capitula version. Deanesly‚ÄìGrosjean's Capitula version is in fact equivalent to Meyvaert's Letter version. which they considered was best exemplified by a manuscript now in Copenhagen; and a second version, which was rearranged in the form of questions paired with answers.This is Meyvaert's Q/A version. In their view, this second version was the work sent to Bede by Nothhelm.Meyvaert, \\"Bede's Text\\", pp. 16‚Äì17. The upshot of Deanesly and Grosjean's research was that the Libellus was quasi-authentic: while not a genuine work of Gregory I, it was nevertheless based extensively on authentic Gregorian writings.Deanesly‚ÄìGrosjean, \\"The Canterbury edition\\", pp. 26‚Äì43. Deanesly and Grosjean's thesis was addressed and refuted by the textual research of Paul Meyvaert,Meyvaert wrote a series of articles on the subject from 1959 to 1986. See: P. Meyvaert, \\"Les 'Responsiones' de S. Gr√©goire le Grand √† S. Augustin de Cantorb√©ry\\", in Revue d‚Äôhistorie ecclesiastique 54 (1959), 879‚Äì94; Meyvaert, \\"Diversity within unity\\" (publ. 1963); Meyvaert, \\"Bede‚Äôs Text\\" (publ. 1971); and P. Meyvaert, \\"Le Libellus responsionum √† Augustin de Cantorb√©ry. following whose work most scholars have come to accept the Libellus as a genuine letter of Gregory.Wallace-Hadrill, Bede's Ecclesiastical History, p. 37.Wright, Companion to Bede, p. 31.Blair, World of Bede, p. 64.H. Mayr-Harting, The Coming of Christianity to Anglo-Saxon England (University Park, PA, 1991), p. 62. The only portion of the Libellus that Meyvaert could not accept as genuine was the chapter on marriage, which Meyvaert (like Boniface before him) believed could not have been written by Gregory. Meyvaert therefore pronounced this chapter to be the single interpolation in an otherwise genuine document.Meyvaert, \\"Le Libellus responsionum √† Augustin de Cantorb√©ry\\". All subsequent scholarship up until the year 2008 has followed him on this point.See, e.g., R. Meens, \\"A Background to Augustine‚Äôs Mission to Anglo-Saxon England\\", in Anglo-Saxon England 23 (1994), pp. 5‚Äì17, at p. 7; M. de Jong, \\"An unsolved riddle: early medieval incest legislation\\", in Franks and Alamanni in the Merovingian period: an ethnographic perspective, ed. I. Wood (Rochester, NY, 1998), pp. 107‚Äì40, at p. 111; B. Friesen, \\"Answers and Echoes: the Libellus responsionum and the Hagiography of North-Western European Mission\\", in Early Medieval Europe 14 (2006), pp. 153‚Äì72, at p. 155; and R. Flechner, \\"St Boniface as historian: a continental perspective on the organization of the early Anglo- Saxon church\\", in Anglo-Saxon England 41 (2012), pp. 41-62, at p. 55. In 2008 Ubl not only showed that the marriage chapter was in fact authored by Gregory, but he also explained exactly how it was the Boniface and later historians came to misunderstand its meaning.

The title is a reference to a four-faced clock that displays four different times, all wrong, and to a bar with that name (also named after the clock) that features prominently as a location in the film. Plot Set in New York City spanning several months, Greg has just moved in with his girlfriend Molly. During their first night after unpacking, they go out for drinks and a meal at a local bar, called The Four-Faced Liar. There, they meet Trip, his girlfriend Chloe (Liz Osborn), and his lesbian friend Bridget. Molly and Bridget bond as they discuss Wuthering Heights and relationships. Molly tells Bridget that she has everything in common with her boyfriend, but Greg lacks passion. Bridget tells Molly that she doesn't have a girlfriend because no one can hold her interest for long enough to bother. Bridget is a roommates with Trip, and they always wake at the same time every morning and they both brush their teeth together in front of the bathroom mirror. Trip and Greg bond over beers and smoking joints on the roof of Trip's apartment building. Trip shows concern with Greg over Molly spending more and more time with Bridget, and he reminds Greg that Bridget is a lesbian. Greg tells Trip that he is getting worked up for nothing. Around Halloween, Trip annoys Chloe by skipping a ballet performance to watch sports. Chloe takes Bridget in Trip's place to watch the show. However, Trip wins Chloe back with a candlelit apology, her favorite dessert, and a self-deprecating dance. After coming home from the holidays early, Chloe catches Trip having sex with a random girl and she leaves him. That same night, Greg drunkenly tries to force an uninterested Molly into sex. She leaves him to stay with Bridget until he apologizes, which he does the next day. At a New Year's Eve party at the bar, Molly laments to Bridget that she has never been thrown up against a wall and kissed. In the restroom, Bridget does just that when she follows Molly in, and the pair has breathless sex for the first time. Afterward, Molly and Bridget appear shocked by their own actions; Bridget asks Molly to come home with her, but Molly rejects her. Molly heads out to be with Greg. Later that night, Molly follows Bridget home after putting Greg to bed and starts a secret affair with Bridget. A montage is shown as Molly's bond with Bridget grows during the next several weeks. One morning, Chloe enters Bridget's room to gather some stuff and finds naked Molly in bed with her. Chloe expresses her disapproval and disappointment with Molly and her infidelity. Trip briefly enters the room but quickly left in shock. And after finding out what went on between Molly and Bridget, he reports it to Greg, who takes the news calmly and forgives his girlfriend because \\"she's worth it.\\" Molly then breaks off her romance with Bridget and announces that she is marrying Greg. A few days later at Molly's birthday party at the bar, Trip attempts to woo Chloe back, while Bridget shows up and presents her case to Molly with a simple, \\"I like you.\\" Greg sees Bridget outside the bar and he confronts her by asking how she pleases Molly in bed better than he.

The statement was ambiguous, and led to considerable debate as to the intentions of its language. Calvin Coolidge  Background  Coolidge was at his \\"Summer White House\\" in the Black Hills when he gave his secretary, Everett Sanders, a piece of paper that said, \\"I do not choose to run for president in 1928.\\" Sanders endorsed Coolidge's declaration, and the announcement was scheduled for the 9 a.m. press conference on Tuesday August 2, 1927.Greenberg, p. 137 However, to avoid an overreaction by the stock market on the east coast, the announcement was moved to midday. At 11:30, Coolidge cut out strips of paper with his statement on it, and at the conference, handed each reporter a strip. Without providing any further information, Coolidge remarked, \\"There will be nothing more from this office today.\\"Greenberg, p. 137  Reaction = Public = Upon Coolidge's announcement, the gathered media were stunned. The public, too, were shocked by the announcement. Many felt Coolidge could easily win a second full term, based on \\"Coolidge Prosperity\\", the booming economy, and a surplus of over $300 million.Greenberg, p. 145 = Family and colleagues = As early as 1924, Coolidge had made it clear he would not run again after his 1924 campaign. He relayed this to his father after his son Calvin Jr., died.Gilbert, p. 227 After the election, Theodore Roosevelt, Jr. \\"clearly remembered\\" Coolidge mentioning his desire not to run again, a conversation Coolidge also reportedly had with Frank Stearns at the same time.Gilbert, p. 227 Also, Secret Service Agent Edmund Starling, who served at the White House for thirty years, and protected five presidents, recounted that Coolidge decided \\"long ago\\" not to run again for office.Gilbert, p. 227 While some close to Coolidge knew he wouldn't run for another term, others were stunned by his announcement, including Sanders, his personal secretary.Gilbert, p. 228 Later in the day on August 2, Grace Coolidge found out of her husband's announcement from visiting senator Arthur Capper. She remarked, \\"Isn't that just like the man. He never gave me the slightest intimation of his intention. I had no idea.\\"Gilbert, p. 228  Reasons for the statement  After Coolidge's announcement there was much debate as to what he meant in his choice of words. Some took the language as a definitive statement that he was not willing to be president any longer. Others thought that he was hoping to be drafted by the party as a candidate. = Hope to be drafted = Some close to the president took the view that Coolidge was looking to be drafted by the party for the 1928 election. Vice President Charles G. Dawes believed that he \\"ardently\\" wanted the nomination.Gilbert, p. 229 Commerce secretary Herbert Hoover, himself considering a 1928 election bid, asked Coolidge if his decision was \\"absolutely conclusive\\", and the president made no direct reply. Even one of Coolidge's closest friends, Senator Butler, said of the decision, \\"I do not know what he wants.\\"Gilbert, p. 229 As for being drafted as the party's candidate, Coolidge stated that he \\"was determined not to have that contingency arise.\\"Coolidge, p. 244 = Desire for private life = Political cartoon by Clifford Berryman portraying Coolidge after his statement. Others saw Coolidge's message as a desire to get back to private life. As early as 1924, Coolidge decided he would not run for the presidency a second time. The death of his son, Cal Jr., in 1924, took a heavy toll on the president, which some say led to clinical depression. \\"When he died, the power and the glory of the Presidency went with him\\", Coolidge later wrote in his autobiography. He also noted that another term would put him in the White House longer than any other man had been there, and ten years is more time than any man should spend there.Greenberg, p. 138 Also, Coolidge took some steps to make sure he was not drafted for the nomination. He said, \\"I do not approve the circulation of a petition, such as has been reported in the morning press, requesting me to run for president in 1928. I don't see that anything good could come from it. I hope it will be discontinued.\\" He also announced in December 1927, \\"My statement stands. No one should be led to suppose that I have modified it. My decision will be respected.\\"Gilbert, p. 229 Informed that some Massachusetts Republicans were mounting a campaign to have him win their state's presidential primary, Coolidge informed the Republican state chairman \\"Such an action would be most embarrassing to me‚Ä¶ I request that it not be done.\\"Gilbert, p. 229 While the language was open for debate, some pointed out that it was the language of a Vermont Yankee. \\"The Yankee language is founded on understatement and not overstatement,\\" said publisher Charles Thompson.Gilbert, p. 229 = Honoring two-term tradition = Within the Republican party, there was talk that the \\"no third term tradition\\" could damage Coolidge's, and thus the party's, chances come election day. This led to some party members calling for him not to run for a third term, though most scholars feel their opinion had little effect on Coolidge's reasoning.Gilbert, p. 228 At the time, the Twenty-second Amendment was not a part of the Constitution and thus the \\"two term tradition\\" was not a firm limit but rather a constitutional convention. There had only been one previous instance of a former vice president winning even one election in his own right after succeeding to the Presidency, this being when Theodore Roosevelt was re- elected in 1904 after succeeding the assassinated William McKinley. However, Roosevelt had served nearly all of McKinley's second term, which may have influenced his decision not to run again in 1908, although he did run unsuccessfully in 1912 against his successor, William Howard Taft. By contrast, Coolidge had only served a little more than half of Harding's unexpired term before winning election in his own right. Nevertheless, some believe that Coolidge was honoring the two-term tradition set by President George Washington, even though Coolidge held the opinion that a vice president who succeeded to part of another president's term would not violate the rule by then running twice for election in his own right.Greenberg, p. 138 Nevertheless, and notwithstanding his actual reasons for not running, Coolidge continued the tradition. Ratification of the Twenty-second Amendment limited the number of times that a person can be elected president to two. Moreover, it further reduced that limit to one in the case of those who had previously served more than half of the unexpired presidential term of another President, which incidentally would have applied to Coolidge had the Amendment been in force during his presidency. The Amendment has yet to apply to anyone succeeding to the presidency - a grandfather clause exempted Harry S. Truman once the amendment came into force, while Lyndon B. Johnson served less than half of John F. Kennedy's term when he became president after Kennedy's assassination. Moreoever, both men initially attempted to run for a second full four-year term, only to both abandon their respective runs for after each made a disappointing showing in the New Hampshire primary. Popular culture The phrase entered popular culture of the era. The tune \\"I Do Not Choose to Run\\", credited to Kenny & Dennishttp://www.oocities.org/Cag03/NovIDoNot.html was recorded in March 1928 by Harry Reser's jazz band for Brunswick Records. The humorous lyrics tell the story of a watch which, rather than ticking and telling time, utters Coolidge's famous phrase.http://www.redhotjazz.com/hreserbands.html An episode of The Dick van Dyke Show is titled \\"I Do Not Choose to Run\\". In the episode, Rob chooses not to run for city council. In the Seinfeld episode \\"The Race\\", Jerry tells a story about how he won a high school race, and has been branded as a fast runner because he inadvertently got a head start.

The name derives from Dutch explorer Cornelius Jacobsen May's description of the plentiful birds laying eggs, naming the waters Eyren Haven, which translates to Egg Harbor in English. The bay has a total area of . Its depth ranges from shallow waters in the southern extension, called Peck Bay, to a deep channel. The Great Egg Harbor River and its 17 tributaries empty into the bay. During the Sangamonian interglacial period, the Great Egg Harbor River existed as a delta that covered much of southern Cape May County. Over time, the waterway shifted its course, emptying into the Atlantic Ocean at the Great Egg Harbor Inlet between Ocean City and Longport. In the eastern periphery, the bay measures along the coast, bordered by Ocean City on the east. History During the Sangamonian interglacial period, melting glaciers formed rivers that carried sediment to the coast of the Atlantic Ocean. The formative Great Egg Harbor River existed as a delta at that time, covering much of what is now Cape May County. Over time, the river established its course to its present location. Currently, the Great Egg Harbor River and its 17 tributaries drain into the Great Egg Harbor Bay. The waterway enters the ocean between Ocean City and Longport at the Great Egg Harbor Inlet. The first people in the region were the Leni-Lenape, who fished, clammed, and bathed in the summer months. In 1614, Dutch explorer Cornelius Jacobsen May discovered the bay, surrounded by plentiful birds laying eggs. May named the waterway Eyren Haven, translated to Egg Harbor. In 1693, the court of Cape May County appointed John Somers to operate the ferry service across the Great Egg Harbor Bay to Cape May County. That year, Somers purchased land from Thomas Budd, naming the property Somerset Plantation. John Somers' son, Richard, built Somers Mansion sometime between 1720 and 1726, which remains the oldest house still in existence in the county. The town name was changed to Somers Ferry, and then Somers Plantation, until the name Somers Point became established in 1750. During the 17th and 18th centuries, pirates and other boaters used Great Egg Harbor Bay as refuge. In 1880, one year after Ocean City was established as a Christian resort, regular steamboat service from Somers Point began. In 1897, the eastern boundaries of Peck Bay and Great Egg Harbor Bay served as the boundaries of newly established Ocean City. =Crossings= In 1907, the Atlantic City and Shore Railroad railroad line began operations, running from Atlantic City to Ocean City via Somers Point. The railroad's bridge across the Great Egg Harbor Bay burned in 1946, and was not rebuilt; the line was abandoned in 1948. In 1914, the Ocean City Automobile Bridge Company financed the construction of a toll bridge linking Somers Point and Ocean City. In 1921, the bridge became free when it was bought by the state of New Jersey, and was entirely replaced by the World War Memorial Bridge in 1933. This bridge, designated New Jersey Route 52, was itself replaced by a wider and taller bridge in 2012. In 1928, a bridge in northern Ocean City opened, crossing Great Egg Harbor Inlet to marshlands in Atlantic County. Also in 1928, the Ocean City Automobile Club financed the Beesley's Point Bridge, which connected Somers Point to Beesley's Point, New Jersey via the Great Egg Harbor Bay. This bridge was closed in 2004 due to damage, and was demolished in 2016. In 1955, the Great Egg Harbor Bridge was built, and a parallel bridge carrying northbound traffic of the Garden State Parkway opened in 1973. The 1955 bridge was replaced in 2016, and the northbound bridge was subsequently refurbished, with completion in 2019. Features Map of Great Egg Harbor Bay, surrounding waterways, and nearby towns At the head of the Great Egg Harbor Bay, the Great Egg Harbor River joins the Middle and Tuckahoe Rivers between Upper Township and Egg Harbor Township. The bay is part of New Jersey's backbarrier lagoon system. The bay exists as a drowned, or submerged, river valley. The waterway covers an area of , measuring along the coast, and extending inland. The tidal range varies from a spring tide to a neap tide. Coastal storms can cause extreme tidal variations. The bay has a salinity between 17 and 32 ppt (parts per thousand), classified as polyhaline. The tidal circulation of the bay is counterclockwise, fed by the deep channels. The quality of the water is good, despite nearby urban development and dissolved oxygen. Stormwater drains in nearby Ocean City feed directly into the bay. Adjacent to the bay is of salty marshes, which in the western portion of the bay is part of Lester G. McNamara Wildlife Management Area. The bay is also bounded by sandy beaches and settlements. Water depth in the bay range from less than to greater than in the main water channel, which extends from the Great Egg Harbor Inlet to the mouth of the Tuckahoe and Great Egg Harbor rivers. The channels in the bay carry sand and shell debris to the Great Egg Harbor Inlet. At the inlet, the shifting currents produce a hazardous waterway to boats, due to changes in the channel related to shoaling. To improve navigation and replenish beaches in Ocean City, the United States Army Corps of Engineers has periodically dredged sand from a location offshore the Great Egg Harbor Inlet. Peck's Bay is a shallow extension of Great Egg Harbor Bay, located on the waterway's southern periphery between Ocean City and the Cape May County mainland. Peck's Bay also serves as part of the Intracoastal Waterway, connecting the Great Egg Harbor Bay with Crook Horn Creek. This waterway is along the west side of Ocean City, which reaches the ocean at Corson Inlet, and also continues as the Intercoastal southward through Cape May County. Islands Sediment from the rivers produce shoals and mudflats, which rise out of the bay to form a series of marshy islands. The islands are gradually eroding at a rate of per year, due to rising sea levels. From 1940 to 1991, the islands decreased in size by 5%. Some of the largest islands include Cowpens Island and Shooting Island, both of which are adjacent to Ocean City. Shooting Island, part of Cape May Wetlands Wildlife Management Area, has been eroding since at least 1930. In 2018, Act Engineers Inc. began a $2.75 million project to install of concrete blocks, which would provide shelter for oysters and restore the island's marshes. In the middle of the bay are the Rainbow Islands, which total in area, but which are submerged during high tide. Adjacent to Ocean City is Cowpens Island. Ecosystem The waterway and its channels carrying silt produce a soft bottom, creating a good habitat for shellfish that covers a area. Other invertebrates in the bay include mussels, barnacles, amphipods, mysids, and worms. In shallow waters where sunlight can reach the bottom, algae and seagrasses grow. The bay serves as breeding grounds for hard clams and oysters. There are 32 species of fish in the bay, including six species that use the bay as spawning grounds. The endangered Leatherback sea turtle, and other turtle species, occupy the coastal waters of New Jersey, including in the bay. Dozens of bird species use the water and adjacent marsh lands as breeding grounds. Cowpens Island, located within the bay, is a bird sanctuary and a heron rookery. The region is one of the top 20 migratory bird locations in the country. Industry By the 18th century, Somers Point had several shipyards along the Great Egg Harbor Bay, supporting the shipbuilding industry. Shellfish harvesting is allowed from November 1 to April 30. Jet Ski operations are popular along the bay in the summertime. The barrier islands to the north and south - Ocean City and Longport - are heavily developed, with bulkheads modifying the natural coastline.

She temporarily lost her title after Miss San Antonio pageant officials complained that Ramirez had gained weight. Ramirez was allegedly told to \\"get off the tacos\\". Ramirez sued pageant officials for stripping her of her title and crown. On March 23, 2011, Ramirez won a lawsuit against the pageant officials which saw her getting her crown and title back. Ramirez will now participate in the Miss Texas final for Miss America. The jury deliberated for 12 hours over a two-day period before coming to a unanimous verdict.

The Bondis, Jewish European refugees, fled the Austrian Empire after the failed revolutions of 1848 and settled in St. Louis, Missouri. August Bondi moved to Pottawatomie Creek in Franklin County, Kansas in 1855 with his business partner, Jacob Benjamin and began homesteading. As Free Soilers who hated slavery, their farm was attacked and burned by ‚ÄúBorder Ruffians‚Äù (pro-slavers). A neighboring farmer rushed to their aide with his sons. His name was John Brown. Bondi joined with Brown and fought alongside of him at the Battle of Black Jack in 1856, defeating the pro-slave forces, and helping enable Kansas to be admitted to the Union as a free state on January 29, 1861. Bondi enlisted in the 5th Kansas Cavalry and served until he was seriously wounded three years later. Bondi settled in Salina, Kansas in 1866 becoming Postmaster and later a County Judge.

Set in the last day of the Great Mahabharat war, the five-act tragedy was written in the years following the 1947 partition of India atrocities, as allegory to its destruction of human lives and ethical values. It is a metaphoric meditation on the politics of violence and aggressive selfhood and that war dehumanized individuals and society. Thus both the victor and the vanquished lose eventually.Rubin, p. 195 The anti-war play first created sensation as a radio play at Allahabad All India Radio. This led to its production by Mumbai-based theatre director, Satyadev Dubey (1962), and subsequent famous production by theatre doyen Ebrahim Alkazi against the backdrop of historical monuments in Delhi (like Feroz Shah Kotla and Purana Qila). It became \\"a national theatrical event\\"; his 1963 production was seen by then Prime Minister, Jawaharlal Nehru. It was subsequently staged by numerous directors and in many Indian languages.Rubin, p. 182 As part of the \\"theatre of the roots\\" movement which started in Indian theatre in the 1950s, which tried to look into Indian epics and myths for form, inspiration and content, Andha Yug is today recognised as the \\"play that heralded a new era in Indian theatre\\" and standard repertoire of Hindi theatre.

Overview Andha Yug is based on the ancient Sanskrit epic, Mahabharata written by Ved Vyasa. The play begins on the eighteenth and last day of the Great Mahabharata War, which devastated the kingdom of Kauravas, the feuding cousins of Pandavas, their capital the once-magnificent Hastinapur lay burning, in ruins, the battlefield of Kurukshetra was strewn with corpses, and skies filled with vultures and death laments. Fatalities were on both sides as cousins killed each other. The survivors were left grieving and enraged as they continued to blame each other for the destruction. No one was willing to view it as a consequence of their own moral choices. Ashwatthama, son of guru Dronacharya, in one last-ditch act of revenge against the Pandavas, releases the ultimate weapon of destruction ‚Äî the Brahmastra, which promises to annihilate the world. No one comes forward to condemn it: Ethics and humanity have been the first casualties of the war. Krishna who mediated between the cousins before war, remains the moral centre of the play. Even in his failure he presents options that are ethical and just and reminds us that a higher or sacred way is always accessible to human beings even in the worst of times. The play ends with the death of Krishna.George, p. 220 Play structure Bharati constructed the play using western drama tradition and early Indian drama, found in Sanskrit drama. * Prologue * Act One: The Kaurava Kingdom * Act Two: The Making of a Beast * Act Three: The Half-truth of Ashwatthama * Interlude: Feathers, Wheels and Bandages * Act Four: Gandhari's Curse * Act Five: Victory and a Series of Suicides * Epilogue: Death of the Lord Themes Andha Yug highlights the perils of self-enchantment in an anti-war allegory. It explores human capacity for moral action, reconciliation, and goodness in times of atrocity and reveals what happens when individuals succumb to the cruelty and cynicism of a blind, dispirited age. When a ruler, epitomized by a blind Dhritarashtra (physically and also by his ambition for his son Duryodhana), in an equally blind society fail its own side and that of their loved ones. It elaborates on the consequences, when a society fails to stop a cycle of revenge and instead choose a redemptive path, which is always available even in worst of scenarios. This is shown by Krishna's presence amid the mindlessness of fellow human beings. It was only when they collectively reject the voice of wisdom that denigration of war step upon them, leading to wide-scale bloodshed. The story hints at the perils that await a society that turns away from its wisdom culture and instead succumb to the logic of the moment that can be easily swayed by emotions. Bharati uses the war of Mahabharat to make an anti-war statement and raises questions regarding moral uprightness in the wake of Partition-related atrocities, loss of faith and national identity. Some directors have used it to bring out contemporary issues like the role of diplomacy of the world. History Dharamvir Bharati (1926‚Äì1997), was a renowned Hindi novelist, poet, and playwright. His novels, Gunahon Ka Devta (The God of Sins, 1949) and Suraj Ka Satvan Ghoda (The Seventh Horse of the Sun, 1952), are classics of Hindi literature. The latter was adapted into a film by Shyam Benegal in 1992. Originally written as a radio play, the play was first broadcast by the All India Radio (public radio) and immediately drew attention. Playwright and theatre director Satyadev Dubey heard of the play and met Bharati when the latter had dropped in to see Dubey's Hindi adaptation of Albert Camus's Cross Purposes, as Sapne. Recognizing its potential, Dubey walked around with the script for nearly 10 years trying to get it done. Dubey had been running 'Theatre Unit' (a theatre group started by Ebrahim Alkazi who moved to Delhi in 1962 as director of National School of Drama, Delhi), After staging it himself in 1962, Dubey sent the script to Alkazi. Though many found the play lacking action, Alkazi believed, \\"action is not rushing around. It‚Äôs inward growth.\\" Alkazi's production made history in modern Indian theatre, when he staged first Andha Yug in 1963, first amidst the backdrop of the ruins of Feroz Shah Kotla, Delhi and then Purana Quila's tiered steps in the 70s. It brought in a new paradigm in Indian theatres.Drama with a distinct vision by Girish Karnad, The Hindu, 25 November 2007. The music for this production was given by noted composer Vanraj Bhatia.Vanraj Bhatia profile internationalopus. In the coming years, the play attracted many directors and was staged across the country, including Mohan Maharishi, Ram Gopal Bajaj, and Bhanu Bharti. M.K. Raina staged the play in Berlin and the Festival of India in the USSR in 1987, Ratan Thiyam staged it in an open-air performance in Tonga, Japan, on 5 August 1994, a day before the 49th anniversary of atomic bombing of Hiroshima.Modern Classics Other noted productions have been by directors Arvind Gaur, Girish Tiwari (Girda), and Bijon Mondal (2010), who gave it a contemporary twist, accompanied by fusion band. A notable production in 2010 at Feroze Shah Kotla ruins included a cast of Ashish Vidyarthi (Ashwatthama), Uttara Baokar (Gandhari), Mohan Maharishi (Dhritrashtra), Vasant Josalkar (Vidur), Ravi Jhankal (Vriddha Yachak), Om Puri (Krishna), Govind Namdev (Vyas).

The incident began with a disagreement between city officials and Knox County officials over whether or not the Citizens Railway Company, led by William Gibbs McAdoo, had the authority to build streetcar tracks along Depot Street, sparking a standoff between city police and county sheriff's deputies. During the struggle, both McAdoo and his rival, C.C. Howell, along with the mayor, chief of police, fire chief, and over 200 workers, were arrested by one side or the other. One person was killed and several injured in accompanying mob violence.East Tennessee Historical Society, Lucile Deaderick (ed.), Heart of the Valley: A History of Knoxville, Tennessee (Knoxville, Tenn.: East Tennessee Historical Society, 1976), pp. 216-228, 541. The incident was the culmination of a two- year struggle between McAdoo and Howell for control of Knoxville's streetcar system. McAdoo had gained control of the bulk of the system in the early 1890s, and successfully converted the system to electric power. This conversion proved costly, however, and his company was forced into bankruptcy. A syndicate led by Howell purchased most of the company's assets, but McAdoo maintained control of several routes,John Wooldridge, George Mellen, William Rule (ed.), Standard History of Knoxville, Tennessee (Chicago: Lewis Publishing Company, 1900; reprinted by Kessinger Books, 2010), pp. 303-310. and the two filed suits and countersuits as they attempted to outposition the other. After this incident, McAdoo left Knoxville, and Howell consolidated the city's streetcar lines.A Brief History of Greater Emory Place , pp. 18-19. Retrieved: 25 March 2011. Background McAdoo Knoxville's first streetcar company, the Knoxville Street Railway, was organized in the mid-1870s, and used streetcars pulled by mules or horses. In 1887, William Gibbs McAdoo (1862-1941), then a young attorney, organized the Elmwood Street Railway Company, which used streetcars that were steam-powered instead of horse-drawn. Three years later, McAdoo reorganized the company as the Rapid Transit Company, which became the first in the city to use electric-powered streetcars. By the early 1890s, McAdoo, with the financial backing of a Philadelphia bank, had acquired the Knoxville Street Railway, which had grown to become the city's largest streetcar system, and merged it with Rapid Transit to form the Knoxville Electric Street Railway Company. While McAdoo successfully electrified this system, the cost of doing so was much greater than he had expected, and the company was unable to make its bond payments. It was forced into receivership in 1892 and disposed of in 1895. Howell When Knoxville Electric Street Railway's assets were auctioned off, a group of investors represented by Ohio businessman C.C. Howell (1848-1902) won the largest portion of the company, while McAdoo won the much smaller Rapid Transit portion. McAdoo reorganized Rapid Transit as the Citizens Railway Company, and focused on the untapped market of North Knoxville (then a separate city). Howell, meanwhile, severed the connection between his system and Citizens Railway, effectively cutting the latter off from the downtown area. In September 1895, he attempted to build tracks over routes granted to Citizens Railway, but was stopped by the city after a long court battle. Throughout 1896, McAdoo's company and Howell's company engaged in a series of maneuvers and countermaneuvers in hopes of thwarting one another's progress. When Citizens Railway attempted to build a line on Park Street in July 1896, Howell placed a streetcar in their path, and gave a security guard orders to shoot anyone who tried to move it. In October 1896, several Citizens employees were arrested when they attempted to install tracks on Depot Street to provide a vital link between the company's Broadway line and the Southern Terminal, and McAdoo sued the city. In the early hours of March 1, 1897, McAdoo, having obtained an injunction from the Knox County Chancery Court prohibiting the city from obstructing Citizens Railway's work on Depot Street, hired 200 laborers to begin laying tracks. Lookouts posted by Howell tipped off the Knoxville police, who rushed to the scene and ordered a cessation of the work. McAdoo, confident in the injunction, ordered the workers to ignore the police and continue working. The police then arrested McAdoo and several workers, but being badly outnumbered with the situation intensifying, were unable to halt the work and sent for reinforcements. By 8 o'clock, a mob of around 2,000 people had gathered to watch the events. The crowd sympathized with McAdoo and the workers, and whenever a worker was arrested, someone in the crowd would step in to take his place. Losing control of the situation, the police called in the fire department, which dispersed the workers with high-powered hoses. One of the drenched workers, William Arnold, attacked the fire chief with a pick, and was in turn shot and mortally wounded by a police officer. Fearing a riot, Mayor Samuel G. Heiskell arrived on the scene, and pleaded for the crowd to disperse, but to no avail. With the crowd growing more defiant, McAdoo, who had been released, returned to the scene to a roaring applause, and delivered a rousing speech, blasting city authorities as \\"servants\\" of Howell, and vowing that his company would not be stopped. Sheriff's deputies finally arrived with a copy of the injunction, claimed the city had violated it, and arrested all city authorities at the scene, including Mayor Heiskell, the police chief, the fire chief, and several policemen and firemen. C.C. Howell and several of his subordinates were also arrested. While these events were unfolding, Knoxville's city attorney had managed to secure an injunction ordering Citizens Railway to halt construction. Obeying this new order, sheriff's deputies quietly dispersed the workers. By noon, the crowd had mostly dissipated. Aftermath Follow-up investigations by the city praised the police department's actions, and vindicated the officer who had killed William Arnold. Subsequent litigation favored Howell's company, and left Citizens Railway with little choice but sell out to Howell. Frustrated, McAdoo left Knoxville for good and returned to his law practice in New York. Howell rechartered his company as the Knoxville Traction Company, which by 1898 controlled all of Knoxville's streetcar lines. Howell ran unsuccessfully for the Tennessee state senate in 1901, and died the following year. In the early 1900s, McAdoo helped expand the New York-area railway system, and later served as U.S. Secretary of the Treasury in the Woodrow Wilson administration. In 1905, Howell's company was absorbed into the Knoxville Railway and Light Company, which operated the city's streetcar lines for several decades.

Its water quality is Class II-III and, in places, Class II. Contamination from communal sewage farms, fish ponds, but especially diffuse contamination from agriculture pollutes the mass balance of the Werse and leads to eutrophication along the entire river course, especially in the retention basin areas.Gew√§ssersteckbrief der Werse.

The name Werse is used from the Osttor and above the Kollenbach. From Beckum the Werse flows westwards. Shortly before Ahlen it turns northwest and, near Drensteinfurt, then via Albersloh it flows northwards. Near M√ºnster-Gelmer near the Haskenau it finally discharges into the Ems. The river is regulated by several overflow weirs.  Fauna  The Werse is a popular destination for anglers because of its rich fish stock.

Sport and tourism  Canoes on the Werse in winter The Werse is the home river of the Alberslohe Canoe Club (Albersloher Kanu Club 1989), canoe section of TG M√ºnster, the M√ºnster Canoe Club 1923 (Paddelsport M√ºnster von 1923) and M√ºnster Canoe Club 1922 ( Kanuverein M√ºnster 1922) There are also many boat houses belonging to Studentenverbindungen on the river. Especially in summer the river is heavily used by commercial boat hire organisations.. In April 2007 the Werse Cycleway (Werseradweg) was opened. It starts in Rheda-Wiedenbr√ºck and runs along the Werse and its surrounding countryside for 122 km. The cycleway ends near the confluence with the Ems near M√ºnster-Gelmer.

It was located 17 km east of the town of Belozersk on the left bank of the Sheksna River, close to the place it flows out of Lake Beloye.  History  In the 10th century the city of Beloozero that had been located on the north bank of Lake Beloye, was moved to the source of the Sheksna River. Since 1238 it became the center of the Principality of Beloozero. In 1352 the city was moved 17 km to the west, to its current location. The village of Krokhino was first mentioned in 1426 in the books of the Kirillo-Belozersky Monastery. It was located at the same place at the source of the Sheksna where the town of Beloozero was formerly located. The village was owned by boyar‚Äôs son Gavrila Laptev. In 1434 he died without leaving any heirs, and Krokhino was donated to the Ferapontov Monastery by the prince of Mozhaysk, Ivan Andreyevich. Because of its geographic location, the village became an important trade centre. Most probably, in the 15th century Krokhino already had its own church.–ù. –ê. –ú–∞–∫–∞—Ä–æ–≤, –ò–Ω—Å—Ç–∏—Ç—É—Ç–∞ –∞—Ä—Ö–µ–æ–ª–æ–≥–∏–∏ –†–ê–ù. –≠–∫—Å–ø–µ—Ä—Ç–Ω–æ–µ –∑–∞–∫–ª—é—á–µ–Ω–∏–µ –æ–± –∏—Å—Ç–æ—Ä–∏–∫–æ- –∞—Ä—Ö–∏—Ç–µ–∫—Ç—É—Ä–Ω–æ–π –∏ –∫—É–ª—å—Ç—É—Ä–Ω–æ–π —Ü–µ–Ω–Ω–æ—Å—Ç–∏ —Ü–µ—Ä–∫–≤–∏ –†–æ–∂–¥–µ—Å—Ç–≤–∞ –•—Ä–∏—Å—Ç–æ–≤–∞ –≤ —Å–µ–ª–µ –ö—Ä–æ—Ö–∏–Ω–æ –ë–µ–ª–æ–∑–µ—Ä—Å–∫–æ–≥–æ —Ä–∞–π–æ–Ω–∞ –í–æ–ª–æ–≥–æ–¥—Å–∫–æ–π –æ–±–ª–∞—Å—Ç–∏ After the Mariinskiy waterway was opened in 1810, both Krokhino, which still belonged to the Ferapontov Monastery, and the neighboring village of Velikolesye owned by the Kirillo- Belozersky Monastery, became known under the common name of Krokhinskaya Pristan (which means Krokhino Wharf). On the wharf the goods from the ships in the Sheksna River were moved to the lake ships that further sailed to Lake Beloye. The lake was shallow, and frequent storms made the navigation complicated. Only special boats (belozerka's, ) could navigate on the lake. The boats were constructed to provide for enhanced stability and durability. The ship manufacturers from Krokhino and Belozersk, who were also boat owners, were gaining big revenues on their monopoly. The town dwellers were employed as pilots and skippers, loaded merchandise or made and sold shipping appliances. Due to this stable source of revenue, Krokhino was growing fast. On November 4, 1777, Krokhinskaya Pristan was renamed into Posad (trading quarter). The Krokhino residents were exempt from their peasant duties and got the same rights as city dwellers. On May 23, 1792 the Town Hall was founded and Krokhino became in fact a non-district (non-uyezd) town. Krokhino late 19th ‚Äî early 20th century The Krokhino Posad, 1909. Kargulino (left), Krokhino (right) Dam of the Empress Maria Fedorovna, Krokhino, 1909. The Krokhino Posad was situated on the mail path from Belozersk to Vytegra, in 600 versts to Novgorod, in 413 versts by water to the falling of Sheksna River into Volga River near the Rybinsk Wharf. Posad owned lands on the banks of Sheksna River that spanned for 3 versts from Beloozero. The width of the river in these places was 80 to 120 sazhens. The depth was from 4 to 13 quarters. From April to October ships were sailing on the river. On the Posad territory Troitskaya, Kargulka, Mysluga, Gorbovka, Dmitrovka, Nikol'skaya and Borisohlebskaya tributaries were falling into Sheksna River. Bridges were thrown through Troitskaya, Kargulka, Mysluga and Nikol‚Äôskaya. There were two acting crossings through Sheksna River ‚Äì horse and foot crossings. By the end of the 18th century The Krokhino Posad had four churches. Three of them were made of wood, and one was made of stone and was built in 1788. In 1846 the Belozersky Canal was built as a way to go around the lake. It started 9 versts (9.5 km) below Krokhino. Krokhinskaya Pristan‚Äô (the Krokhino Dock) got closed and Posad quickly lost its meaning for trade as well as its prosperity. Among local residents there is a legend that land surveyors who were planning the new channel, asked Krokhino dwellers for a bribe. And when they were refused, they have put the channel away from the Posad. In 1865 Posad consisted of 3 parts: Krokhino (4 blocks), Velikolesye (2 blocks) and Kargulino (3 blocks). The Posad had 13 stone houses and 179 wood houses. There were also shops, barns, coaching inn, 3 forges, 4 pubs, 2 wind mills and 2 water mills. The main occupations of residents were navigation and trade. One third of residents was involved in fishing. There were also people involved in agriculture and shipbuilding. Before 1791 there was an acting parochial school that had 27 students. But because of the lack of funding it got closed down, and children had to get education only privately. Krokhino and Velikolesye were affiliated to the parish of the Christmas Church. Kargulino was affiliated with Trinity Church that earlier had been part of the monastery. There were 884 residents in Christmas Church parish (406 men and 478 women) and 288 residents in Trinity parish (148 men and 140 women). In 1961 Sheksna Reservoir that became part of Volga‚ÄìBaltic Waterway, was filled. After the construction of the 8th lock near Sheksna the water level in Sheksna River have risen by 5 meters and Krokhino turned out to fall into the flooding zone. –°—Ç–∞—Ä—ã–π —à–ª—é–∑ –±—ã–ª –æ–ø—É—â–µ–Ω –Ω–∞ –¥–Ω–æ.–ï. –ú. –õ—É—á–∫–æ–≤ –ú–æ–∏ –≤–æ—Å–ø–æ–º–∏–Ω–∞–Ω–∏—è –æ –í–æ–ª–≥–æ-–ë–∞–ª—Ç–µ // –ö–∏—Ä–∏–ª–ª–æ–≤ : –ö—Ä–∞–µ–≤–µ–¥—á–µ—Å–∫–∏–π –∞–ª—å–º–∞–Ω–∞—Ö. ‚Äî –í–æ–ª–æ–≥–¥–∞: –†—É—Å—å, 2005. ‚Äî –í. 6.

The church was at the water's edge on the coast of Lake Beloye, at the origin of the Sheksna River. At the beginning of the 1960s, Krokhino, Karlugino and other settlements of Belozersky District got into the inundation zone at the time of construction of deep Volga‚ÄìBaltic Waterway. The level of water in Lake Beloye has risen to guarantee depth for ships, and ancient villages and their whole history have gone underwater. The inhabitants of the inundated areas disassembled their houses and moved away. Only the churches remained on the deserted land: the Nativity Church in Krokhino, more famous for its location, and the Church of Candlemas built at the end of the 18th century in Kovzha (at the mouth of the Kovzha River). It is known that the Nativity Church was built in the Baroque style (a stone three-altar church with Nikolskiy and Peter-and-Paul chapels). At present both churches are half- destroyed. The Nativity Church is more likely to collapse as it stands in water, and the Church of Candlemas in Kovzha is on an island. In the result of drowning the southern wall of the church in Krokhino is more destroyed than the northern wall. The Nativity Church in Krokhino became well-known because of the tourist routes that travel on Sheksna River. In 2009, a project to salvage the church was organized.–î–æ–∫—É–º–µ–Ω—Ç—ã –Ω–∞ –•—Ä–∞–º –†–æ–∂–¥–µ—Å—Ç–≤–∞ –•—Ä–∏—Å—Ç–æ–≤–∞ –≤ –ö—Ä–æ—Ö–∏–Ω–æ  References  External links  * https://web.archive.org/web/20120321193540/http://www.krokhino.ru/en/project.html Rural localities in Vologda Oblast ","title":"Krokhino, Vologda Oblast"},{"id":"31296007","text":"Vinyl Cafe Diaries (2003) is Stuart McLean's fourth volume of stories that first aired on the CBC Radio program The Vinyl Cafe.

The wall is located approximately 1.6 km west of the Village of Smiley, Saskatchewan on Highway 772. Construction started in 1962 when Albert started arranging stones in the form of a wall. As stones were cleaned off the surrounding farmland Albert would add them to the wall. This continued clear until 1991. As the stones were transported to the wall they were placed so that the wall would support itself without the use of cement or mortar. The outer layer stones are specially shaped stones, that have been tapered inward in order to prevent the wall from moving. The interior of the wall is filled with small and odd shaped stones. During construction of the wall spruce trees were added alongside the wall for wind protection. After 29 years of work the wall was complete with a 6-foot base, stretching more than a 3/8 of a mile in length with an average height of 6 feet and 12 feet at places. Along with the stone wall a sod house, built from sod cut out of the surrounding grasses was completed in 1986 with help from others in the Smiley area.

Mostly of no authorship, appeared to be informal or rather of a dubious kind of creativity, but not an unambiguous one. Consists of memorial songs, love songs, nostalgia songs, buddy songs, pro-war and anti-war songs, sometimes with an absolutely polar attitude towards the United States and Vietnamese allies. Brief overview Though, only one Soviet military unit, 260th Anti-Aircraft Defence Regiment, had been deployed entirely, a variety of other military units were deployed in parts, and a huge number of Soviet military specialists, mostly military advisors, were deployed there on individual missions or as members of a joined task force. Over 6000 Soviet troops and an unknown number of Civil service specialists, had been deployed during the Vietnam War. Songs and poetry Along with official music, such as the 1965 hit \\"Kentucky Kid\\" or the 1968 \\"Hands Off Vietnam!\\", or Vietnamese songs, such as \\"Liberate the South\\", which Soviet military men used to sing along with their Vietnamese colleagues, there has been a vast number of songs and amounts of poetry in the Russian language, written by unauthorized poets, militarymen they appear to be.Only authorized creativity was accepted in the former USSR. I.e., song writers and composers were obliged to be members of the Union of Soviet Writers or the Union of Soviet Composers respectively. Otherwise, their activities would be considered as sponging (felony) up to the war propaganda (crime). These are: =Wandering The Swamps Of Vietnam= \\"Love Ballad\\", written by an unknown Soviet military advisor in the late 1960s. Partly appeared in journals and books, issued by the official Soviet print since 1969. In official publications it has been presented as a song of Soviet geologists, but as it was revealed later, Soviet Civil service specialists in Vietnam, including geologists, were quite often deployed along with their wives, while the protagonist of the song yearns for a beloved woman, who is far away from the swamps of Vietnam. Besides that, swampy terrains are more typical for southern parts of the country, geological activities there would most likely might be of no result. Being written by some infantryman, that is, one who participated in ground missions, the song provides evidence that Soviet servicemen were involved not only in Air Defense, Logistics and Military Transportation, as has been thought previously. However, the song contains no hatred towards Americans, nor a single mention of any foreign military power invading Vietnam. =Wartime Friendship= Semi-official unit march of 260th Anti-Aircraft Defence Regiment, written by Soviet AAD Officer Alexander V. Gusev, after Soviet Anti- Aircraft Defense specialists' two-month ground-to-air stand versus United States Air Force, occurred at Th√°i Nguy√™n and its neighborhoods, during April‚ÄìMay 1966. Text of the song consists mostly of survivor experience. The song itself is a remake of 1963 Soviet movie soundtrack On the Unknown Hillock. =The Road of Life= A short war poem written by unknown military transportation officer, could be described as clearly denoted pro-war poetry. Lyrics are mostly about the Ho Chi Minh trail, heavily bombed by Americans. But depiction of Americans in the lyrics has been made in such epithets as \\"Yankees\\", \\"Satan's black spawn\\", \\"The vulture\\", framing the poem as anti- American as well. The poem inspired later works of well known Soviet poets Yevgeniy Dolmatovsky (1967) and Yevgeny Yevtushenko (1972) to write lyrics, labeled with the similar name, but written in more peaceful style and containing no anti-American attitude. =Phantom= A rehash of the 1950s Korean War guitar song. Perhaps, the best known Soviet song, which has never been written down during the Soviet Era. Told from the imaginary point of view of an average American military aviator, the tone of the song is totally unfriendly to Vietnamese allies of the Soviet Union. Being initially created by Soviet military pilots in Korea, it induced controversial speculation about Soviet engagement in Vietnam War aerial dogfights. However, this point has not been confirmed yet, only the number of Soviet aerial casualties has been revealed recently. =In The Name Of John= A lament, supposed to be have been composed by Soviet anti-aircraft defense specialists in the late 1960s or early 1970s. Metre of the song and the song itself is performed in the manner of Comin' in on a Wing and a Prayer, a famous World War II song by Harold Adamson and Jimmy McHugh. As well as Phantom, it is being told from an imaginary point of view of an average United States Air Force bomber crewman, whose aircraft was hit by Anti-aircraft cannons during a bombing mission, and streamingly going down. The presence of Soviet military has not been mentioned in any variation of the song. Vietnamese resistance is mentioned simply as \\"guerrillas, who are shooting down every man\\". However, higher ranks of United States Armed Forces, Government officials and even the President of the United States (in some text variations) being strongly criticized, is what makes this song an anti-government one. =Fierce Fight= A song written by an unknown author, presumably a Yamal Peninsula inhabitant (Russian Far North). The author mentions Ob River, and some other distinguishing features of the Russian North, the places he belongs to. Then he explains his understanding, that there exists another world, without permanent alarm, rockets and bombers, the world of truth, happiness and sunlight. But he is needed to keep to his commitment. He feels the urge to help those, who are oppressed. He knows, that if he will stand and fight, with no retreat, no break, he will eventually bring happiness to those whom he defends. =I Want The Snow To Fall= A nostalgic song about the Russian soul, melting in the tropical Vietnam, desiring to see the snow. The author moons about cornflower-blue skies, frosty air to breathe in deeply, ice-flowers on winter window glass, snow to fall on the chest, birch trees, boundless snowfields, crane flying wedges, summarizing it all with the question: \\"Oh, dear Homeland! How should the northerner do life in Vietnam?\\" =No Sleep For Me In Hanoi= A short three-verse song. The author finds himself standing at night, gazing at stars shining bright far away, Red River flowing, trees swaying by wind. No sleep for him in the Capital of Vietnam. Anxiety and nostalgia over his thoughts. And far away from here, his boundless homeland covered up with snow, shining in the glare of the old Kremlin. =For Many \\"War\\" Is Just A Word= A song of an unknown author, discovered by Stanislav Batayev. The author points out that for many people, \\"war\\" is nothing more than just a word, and word of the times, which passed a long time ago. It is a reference to the Great Patriotic War, Soviet people usually meanwhile are saying \\"The War\\". For those Soviet guys, who have seen burned earth, ruined cities and villages of Vietnam, it seems absolutely clear what is \\"war\\". =Farewell To Vietnam= Another song discovered by Stanislav Batayev. Tour of duty is now ending for the author of the song and his fellows, suitcase is packed, the imaginary war-plan seems to have been accomplished. Good luck to those who will continue their endeavor. Friends and relatives waiting for them up there at home, and they have the honor to report to them, that \\"the vultures\\" were met with fierce rebuff, both in the skies and on the ground. Deployment terms are not the same for all, some arrive and some are leaving. Now, they have experienced what it feels like, to be given a send-off. They swear to prevent themselves from empty promises, but to obey one rule, if they will ever met each other, they will stand up for the third toast and honor those who did not come back, those who partly came back, and those who spent their unforgettable youth down there. =M·ªôt TrƒÉm Gam= Let's m·ªôt trƒÉm gam is an inaccurate Vietnamese translation of the most common Russian toast, \\"Let's drop 100 grammas\\". The song had been written in 2000 by retired Soviet military expert, Sr. Lieut. Alexander Anosov, who himself had been to Vietnam in 1967‚Äì1968. The song is an overview of great events which unfolded in Vietnam over thirty years ago, written by a living eyewitness of those events. The song tells about \\"hit & carry\\" task groups, whose purpose was to hit hostile aircraft and then carry up catapulted pilots, fallen hardware and weaponry, about Soviet surprise bombings by usage of unexploded U. S. bombs and shells, and about daily war-life. The song summarizes that it has been a long time ago, and not all survivors came to join their war- brotherhood anniversary, and the author's closing words are: FootnotesReferencesSources * .

The resolution was the first time the Council had outlined such co-operation. Observations In the preamble of the resolution, the Council recalled initiatives since January 1993 to improve co-ordination between the United Nations and regional organisations. It emphasised that the contribution of regional organisations could complement the work of the United Nations in maintaining international peace and security. The capacity of regional organisations was to be strengthened and the Council acknowledged the resolve of the 2005 World Summit to increase the role of regional organisations. A decision to establish at Peacebuilding Commission was also welcomed. Acts Further expressing its determination to increase co-operation between the United Nations and regional organisations, the Council urged all states to increase the capacity of the organisations in conflict prevention and crisis management, particularly in Africa. It was also important for regional organisations to deploy peacekeeping units quickly, tackle illegal arms trafficking, encourage regional co-operation and hold high-level meetings with the United Nations. The Secretary-General Kofi Annan was requested to submit a report on the opportunities and challenges of co-operation between regional organisations and the United Nations, and to include co-operation with regional organisations in his regular reports to the Council on peacekeeping and peacebuilding missions.

It has served the Muslim community of the town and the surrounding district of Horsham since 2008. The plain stuccoed building in which it is housed was originally a Baptist chapel‚Äîone of several in the town, which has a long history of Nonconformist Christian worship. The former Jireh Independent Chapel was in commercial use until Muslims acquired it after a lengthy search for a permanent space. The organization, 'Muslims in Britain' classify the Madina Mosque as, \\"Deobandi\\". History Horsham developed from the 10th century as a market town at a point in the High Weald of north Sussex where the River Arun could be crossed. Religious worship was focused on the 12th-century parish church of St Mary at first, but Protestant Nonconformism thrived from the 17th century. One of the many denominations for which chapels were founded between then and the 19th century was the Strict Baptist community. During a spate of church-building in the 19th and early 20th centuries, three chapels opened for followers of the cause. A pastor called Mr Raynsford founded the first of these in 1814. His congregation worshipped in a room in a private building at first, but in 1857 a permanent building was erected in nearby Park Terrace East. It was called Jireh Independent Baptist Chapel, although the name Jireh Strict Baptist Chapel was sometimes used as well. The congregation was called \\"Free Baptist\\" by 1882. Horsham's second Strict Baptist Chapel, named Rehoboth, was founded in 1834 by seceders from the congregation; it remains in use by Strict Baptists, but the Jireh Chapel cause failed in the mid-20th century. It was still in use in 1938, but on 9 September 1953 the marriage licence it had been granted in December 1860 was cancelled. The building passed into commercial use and was altered internally and externally, in particular by the addition of a porch. By the start of the 21st century, it was a hairdressing salon. Meanwhile, a small Muslim community had developed in the growing town. In about 1994, they first attempted to get permission to open a place of worship. The congregation used an industrial building and then a private house on the Brighton Road, but planning permission to register these permanently was refused in each case, and there was opposition from local residents. Permission was granted to hold prayer meetings and other activities at the house in 2005, but Horsham District Council rescinded this in 2008, citing complaints about noise and a reluctance to allow a permanent change of use from residential to non- residential. An application was then submitted for conversion of the former Jireh Chapel from a salon into a mosque, and this was approved in May 2008. Architecture The former chapel is a simple Classical-style building with a painted stucco fa√ßade. The ground floor is rusticated, and there are round- arched windows at first-floor level. The exterior was painted after the building's conversion to commercial use, and a Classical-style porch with a pediment and columns was added. Current status The chapel originally had a capacity of 150, but since its conversion it can now accommodate 200. Attendance at Friday prayers is typically around 80. The mosque is registered as a charity with the Charity Commission.

The result was a hung parliament with the FUNCINPEC Party being the largest party with 58 seats. Voter turnout was 89.56%.Widyono (2008), p. 124 The elections were conducted by the United Nations Transitional Authority in Cambodia (UNTAC), which also maintained peacekeeping troops in Cambodia throughout the election and the period after it.UN Security Council Practices and Charter Research Branch (1995), p. 598 They remain the last elections won by a party other than the Cambodian People's Party, which began to dominate Cambodian politics from 1998. Background The State of Cambodia (SOC) and three warring factions of the Cambodian resistance consisting of FUNCINPEC, Khmer Rouge and Khmer People's National Liberation Front (KPNLF) signed the Paris Peace Accords in October 1991. The accords provides for the establishment of the UNTAC, a United Nations-led interim administration that would supervise the demobilization of troops from the SOC and the three warring factions, and also conduct democratic elections in 1993.Widyono (2008), p. 35 The UNTAC was formed at the end of February 1992, and Yasushi Akashi was appointed as head of the UNTAC.Widyono (2008), p. 5 In August 1992, the UNTAC administration promulgated the election law,Widyono (2008), p. 95 and conducted the provisional registration of political parties. Political parties that were registered were allowed to open party offices the following month.Widyono (2008), p. 116 The following year in January 1993, registration of electorate was carried out, and UNTAC identity cards were issued.Widyono (2008), p. 115 The UNTAC conducted a civic education campaign in February 1993,Widyono (2008), p. 117 and two months later the UNTAC allowed political parties to hold public meetings and rallies to campaign for votes.Widyono (2008), p. 118 Pre-election challenges=Demobilisation= When UN peacekeepers were sent in to commence on demobilisation in June 1992, the Khmer Rouge set up road blocks in territories under their control to prevent peacekeepers from entering.Widyono (2008), p. 77 When the incidents were reported to the then-UN secretary-general Boutros Boutros-Ghali, he sent a personal appeal to Khieu Samphan to let peacekeepers conduct demobilisation. The Khmer Rouge leadership responded by demanding that day-to-day administration should be handed over an administrative body headed by Norodom Sihanouk, and also alleged that continued presence of Vietnamese troops in Cambodia did not warrant demobilisation. As the Khmer Rouge insisted on not participating in demobilisation, Sihanouk called on the UNTAC to isolate the Khmer Rouge from participating in any future peace-making initiatives.Widyono (2008), pp. 84‚Äì5 The Cambodian People's Armed Forces (CPAF), Armee Nationale Sihanoukiste (ANS, also informally known as the FUNCINPEC army) and Khmer People's National Liberation Front participated in the mobilisation exercises, although young and untrained recruits were sent to participate while non-servicing weapons were presented to the peacekeeping troops.Widyono (2008), p. 76 When the Khmer Rouge continued to resist demobilisation efforts, UNTAC decided to suspend the entire mobilisation exercise in September 1992, during which about 50,000 soldiers from the CPAF, ANS and KPNLF have disarmed.Widyono (2008), p. 78 =Violent attacks= The Khmer Rouge started to carry out a series of attacks on Vietnamese civilians from April 1992, which they justified by claiming that there were Vietnamese soldiers disguised as civilians.Heder et al. (1995), p. 98 In March 1993, the Khmer Rouge carried out the largest attack on Vietnamese civilians in the floating village of Chong Kneas in Siem Reap Province which claimed the lives of 124 Vietnamese civilians. The Khmer Rouge had provided tacit forewarning prior to the attack,Widyono (2008), p. 96 but neither SOC troops not UNTAC peacekeepers were deployed. When the attack was published in the press, it triggered about 20,000 Vietnamese to flee to Vietnam the following month in April 1993.Widyono (2008), pp. 97‚Äì8 The CPAF also carried out clandestine attacks on the party offices belonging to FUNCINPEC and BLDP starting in November 1992. The attacks were carried out at night, and soldiers would fire grenades or rockets. The number of incidents were reduced in January 1993, but picked up again in March 1993 until the eve of elections in May 1993.Heder et al. (1995), p. 170 The attacks left about 200 political workers killed or injured by May 1993.Heder et al. (1995), p. 196 Results The voting process was carried out between 23 and 28 May 1993.Widyono (2008), p. 119 Most of the voting stations were based in school buildings and Buddhist pagodas to reduce costs. The election was staffed by some 50,000 Cambodians and 900 international volunteers as well as an additional 1,400 United Nation officers which served as polling station observers.Widyono (2008), p. 120 The counting of votes started on 29 May and lasted until 10 June. The results were declared by Akashi, and five days later the UN security council endorsed the election results with Security Council Resolution 840.Widyono (2008), p. 127 Aftermath On 31 May 1993, the CPP to file a complaint with Akashi over claims of irregularities in the elections. When Akashi dismissed CPP's complaints, Hun Sen and Chea Sim suggested to Sihanouk to assume full executive powers as the Head of State of the country. Sihanouk accepted the initiative, and issued a declaration on 3 June that he would assume the position as the Head of State of Cambodia. The ministries would be divided between FUNCINPEC and CPP on a fifty-fifty basis. FUNCINPEC president Ranariddh, as well as several countries including the United States, United Kingdom, Australia and China opposed the initiative. The US charged that Sihanouk's initiative would violate the spirit of the election as well as the terms set in the Paris Peace Accords. The following day, Sihanouk abandoned the initiative to assume full executive powers.Widyono (2008), p. 126 One week later on 10 June, Hun Sen announced that seven eastern provinces, all bordering Vietnam had seceded from Cambodia under the leadership of then- Deputy Prime Minister Norodom Chakrapong and then-Interior Minister Sin Song. Hun Sen avoided supporting the secession attempt publicly, but accused the United Nations of creating electoral fraud to precipitate CPP's defeat in the election. Chakrapong and Sin Song attacked political offices belonging to FUNCINPEC and BLDP in the provinces, and also issued orders for UNTAC officials to leave the provinces under their control. An emergency National Assembly meeting was initiated on 14 June where Sihanouk was re-instated as the Head of State, with Ranariddh and Hun Sen appointed as co-prime ministers with equal levels of executive powers.Widyono (2008), pp. 128‚Äì9 When Hun Sen issued a letter to Akashi to declare his support for continued UNTAC's interim administration, Chakrapong and Sin Song dropped the secessionist threats. For the next three months, Sihanouk presided over an interim administration his resignation on 21 September, and he re-assumed the office of the King of Cambodia two days later on 23 September 1993.Widyono (2008), p. 130 ReferencesBibliography=Books= =Reports= * 1993 in Cambodia Elections in Cambodia Cambodia ","title":"1993 Cambodian general election"},{"id":"31296237","text":"Frontal Assault is the third album by British heavy metal band Angel Witch.

It is a bifunctional molecule, containing both a hydroxy and aldehyde functional groups. The name reuterin is derived from Lactobacillus reuteri, which produces the compound biosynthetically from glycerol as a broad-spectrum antibiotic. L. reuteri itself is named after the microbiologist Gerhard Reuter, who did early work in distinguishing it as a district species. Solution structure In aqueous solution 3-hydroxypropionaldehyde exists in equilibrium with its hydrate (1,1,3-propanetriol), in which the aldehyde group converts to a geminal diol: :HOCH2CH2CHO + H2O ‚Üí HOCH2CH2CH(OH)2 The hydrate is also in equilibrium with its dimer (2-(2-hydroxyethyl)-4-hydroxy-1,3-dioxane), which dominates at high concentrations. These three components - the aldehyde, its dimer, and the hydrate are therefore in a dynamic equilibrium. Besides, 3-hydroxypropionaldehyde suffers an spontaneous dehydration in aqueous solution, and the resulting molecule is called acrolein. In fact, the term reuterin is the name given to the dynamic system formed by 3-hydroxypropionaldehyde, its hydrate, the dimer, and acrolein. This last molecule, acrolein, was recently included in reuterin definition. Structure of the dimer of 3-hydroxypropionaldehyde Synthesis and biosynthesis 3-Hydroxypropionaldehyde is formed by the condensation of acetaldehyde and formaldehyde. This reaction, when conducted in the gas-phase, was the basis for a now obsolete industrial route acrolein: :CH3CHO + CH2O ‚Üí HOCH2CH2CHO :HOCH2CH2CHO ‚Üí CH2=CHCHO + H2O Presently 3-hydroxypropionaldehyde is an intermediate in the production of pentaerythritol. Reuterin is an intermediate in the metabolism of glycerol to 1,3-propanediol catalysed by the coenzyme B12-dependent glycerol dehydratase. Biological activity Reuterin is a potent antimicrobial compound produced by Lactobacillus reuteri. It is an intermediate in the metabolism of glycerol to 1,3-propanediol catalysed by the coenzyme B12-dependent diol dehydrase. Reuterin inhibits the growth of some harmful Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria, along with yeasts, molds, and protozoa. L. reuteri can secrete sufficient amounts of reuterin to inhibit the growth of harmful gut organisms, without killing beneficial gut bacteria, allowing L. reuteri to remove gut invaders while keeping normal gut flora intact. Reuterin is water-soluble, effective in a wide range of pH, resistant to proteolytic and lipolytic enzymes, and has been studied as a food preservative or auxiliary therapeutic agent. Reuterin as an extracted compound has been shown capable of killing Escherichia coli O157:H7 and Listeria monocytogenes, with the addition of lactic acid increasing its efficacy. It has also been demonstrated to kill Escherichia coli O157:H7 when produced by L. reuteri.

It is also known as the Tinguilinta River, after a village along its upper course. Geography Lying between the Kogon River to the north and the Pongo River to the south, the Nunez empties into the Atlantic Ocean at the port town of Kamsar, along the coast of Guinea-Conakry. The river is swollen each year during the rainy season, producing floodplains and inland swamps. These floodplains are inhabited by the Nalu and Baga people. About inland is the city of Bok√©; the largest on the river and the chief commercial center of Guinea. Here the river is 100m wide and 1m deep. Upstream from Bok√©, the shallow river winds through low hills with many series of rapids and small islet clusters to its source, a confluence of several small streams. = Coordinates =History Prior to 1840, this river served as a market for Fulbe slave caravans transporting slaves from the Muslim Imamate of Futa Jallon. In 1793 Captain Samuel Gamble of the Sandown was forced to seek protection from enemy war boats and pirates in the mangrove swaps of the Rio Nunez during the French Revolutionary Wars, where vessels were threatened by French privateers along the West African coast. For unknown reasons, he travels to agricultural villages around the commercial centers of Boke and Kacundy. During his journey Gamble records the earliest known description of irrigated rice cultivation in the Rio Nunez region (though earlier accounts exist such Diego Gomes' 15th century record of mangrove rice farming along the Gambia River, detailing his eyewitness account of the process. Records attest to his purchases of both red rice and polished rice from the Rio Nunez's farmers. In 1849 the river was the site of the Rio Nu√±ez incident, when a Franco-Belgian squadron of warships fired on Bok√©, which resulted in loss of inventory by two British traders. The incident was inconclusive. During the 1870s, this river was a major export point for peanuts, with 5,000 tons per year. In the 1880s, the trade turned to rubber.

Although formed in a small rural community, the society had the integrity to sue agricultural agencies when their guarantees did not conform to their advertised products. Although one of the first organisations of its kind, it continues to flourish when others fell by the wayside and is now arguably the oldest of its kind in the world.West Cumberland Times 22 November 1919 Moreover, the society became a catalyst which empowered three local men to further the cause of agriculture by establishing the Aspatria Agricultural College, the second of its kind in the world. Mr William Norman MRAC, of High Close farm, Aspatria Early beginnings In 1869, a quantity of artificial ‚Äòturnip‚Äô manure priced at ¬£7.50p per ton arrived in the Aspatria district. Of the recipients John Twentyman of Hawkrigg Farm, and William Norman of High Close, bought 5 tons and 2 tons respectively. Norman, a qualified chemist,West Cumberland Times 5 March 1910 doubted the integrity of the declared chemical properties and sought verification from former colleague, Thomas Anderson, of Glasgow University. Anderson confirmed Norman's suspicions, as the manure contained only 13 per cent of soluble phosphates with a value of ¬£2 50p per ton.Carlisle Journal 4 October 1869 In the meantime, Twentyman, acting independently applied the manure to a field of turnips and experienced disappointing results. The two neighbours met through the intermediary of local veterinary surgeon Henry Thompson MRCVS who suggested they form an Agricultural Society at Aspatria, with the primary aim of initiating an annual Agricultural Show. It was during a speech at the inaugural show dinner, in September 1869, that Sir Wilfrid Lawson, 2nd Baronet of Brayton advised local farmers to follow his example and join the Agricultural and Horticultural Association, established by Edward Owen Greening at Manchester two years earlier.Carlisle Journal 28 September 1869 Twentyman took the initiative one stage further and organised a meeting of local landlords and tenant farmers with a view of establishing a small company for buying fertilisers and feed stuff at a guaranteed quality. At a meeting on 24 January 1870, twenty members agreed to draw up a list of rules, adopt a motto ‚Äòeach for all and all for each‚Äô, appoint Henry Thompson as secretary, on an initial salary of ¬£65 per annum, and to purchase 160 subscription shares at ¬£1 each.Carlisle Journal 3 December 1869 On 14 April the society, the first of its kind in Cumberland, registered the company under the Industrial and Provident Societies Act 1893. The rules This society will check the sale of inferior and adulterated articles, by giving the members the control over the agency that purchases for them. The committee having supreme power, and being a representative body annually elected, no abuse of the kind can creep in without the connivance of the members themselves; a thing all but impossible. If any member or customer can supply themselves better without the intervention of the society, or through other agency, we have no right to expect or desire to obtain their custom. In judging this however, it is necessary to bear in mind that purchasing members receive back all surplus profits after payment of working expenses, and interest on capital. They must also remember that the greatest possible care will be taken by obtaining analyses, and exacting guarantees to secure pure articles of the very highest quality. The committee will make this in fact the special feature of the society.West Cumberland Times 22 November 1919 An extensive court case Later that year a vessel arrived in Whitehaven harbour carrying a cargo of high quality Peruvian guano, reported to contain 17 per cent ammonia. The society purchased 50 tons, and dispersed it amongst their membership. Norman took samples from several of the consignments which under analysis proved to contain no more than 13.45 per cent of the desired compound. The directors reacted with direct action and refrained from payment of the value of the difference, a sum of about ¬£59. This action infuriated the seller who issued a writ in the high court. Although the initial ruling went against the society they immediately lodged an appeal.Carlisle Journal 29 November 1870 The case became protracted and journeyed through several courtsCarlisle Journal 28 June 1872 eventually settling at the Committee to the House of Lords. After five years of squabbling the arbiter ruled in favour of Aspatria. Although the case cost the society a sum of ¬£630, the seller‚Äôs legal expenses exceeded ¬£2,400; furthermore the society had fulfilled one of its prime objectives 'value for money rather than profit'. The arbiter had settled the case but it took a further thirty-six years before the British government introduced legislation to guarantee the composition of fertilisers and animal feedstuff.West Cumberland Times Aspatria Agricultural Cooperative Society Offices with Secretary Henry Thompson standing at the entrance A successful business Sales in the opening six months amounted to ¬£4,381, and generated a profit of ¬£701, out of which the committee distributed 5 per cent on capital, working expenses involved in the establishing of the society ¬£192, discount to purchasing members at time of sale ¬£272, leaving ¬£228 paid as dividend to purchasing members only. By 1900 membership had risen to 327 with annual sales totalling ¬£13,467; almost all the profit being distributed to the membership as interest and dividends. On their 50th anniversary in 1920, Henry Thompson retired, after serving as secretary since the inception. In that year, the oldest society of its kind in Europe, reported a turnover of ¬£40,000. In the period since its formation, total sales amounted to ¬£800,000, with interest paid to shareholders of ¬£4,000, and dividends to purchasing members of ¬£8,100.West Cumberland Times 22 November 1919 Although Thompson left a society never seeking to become a market leader, it was steeped in genuine integrity, which continued to practice on the assumption that the reason for its existence was to guarantee the quality of its goods and services. Modern times In 1919, a special general meeting decided not to transfer the business to the Aspatria Cooperative Wholesale Society and natural growth continued.West Cumberland Times 24 May 1919 In 1976 the society dropped the word cooperative from its title and in 1990 underwent a further name change when they became known as Aspatria Farmers Ltd.

Muscle Tractors are a classification of tractors specifically produced from the 1960s to the mid-1980s that feature turbo, duals, and front wheel assist. Muscle tractors were a turning point in American farm mechanization when horsepower was taking over from steel wheels and crank-start tractors. This generation of tractors has been growing in popularity among tractor collectors. The magazine was founded to satiate the heritage farmer‚Äôs appetite. Heritage Iron features all brands, all makes, and all models of muscle tractors from the 1960s to mid 1980s including the equipment that the tractors used. It is published out of Greenville, Illinois, by 3-Point Ink, LLC. History Founded in 2008, Heritage Iron Magazine is published by 3-Point Ink, LLC. Sherry Schaefer is the owner, publisher, and editor of the magazine. Heritage Iron is a bi-monthly publication that features all brands of muscle tractors from the 1960s to 1990. Each issue highlights a featured tractor and presents a detailed account of that tractor, its attributes, its history, and its owner. Other regular features in the magazine are machinery milestones, equipment company history, classified ads, auction results, letters to the editor, an editor‚Äôs page, farm toys, literature and memorabilia. The first issue was mailed in January 2009 and featured an International Harvester 1206 on the front cover. Other tractors that have appeared on the cover include: John Deere 8020, Allis-Chalmers 220, Case Spirit of ‚Äô76, Minneapolis Moline G1000, Oliver 2255, Massey 97, John Deere 5020, International Harvester 1568, and the Steiger Tiger. The Niche Magazine Conference awarded Heritage Iron Best New Launch of 2008. Heritage Iron is currently creating an option for an online digital magazine option for the tech savvy subscribers.  Distinctive Features  right Heritage Iron created and patented its own publication mascot, Brutus. Brutus is a cartoon character depicting a muscle bound tractor with human characteristics. Brutus was patented on December 22, 2009. The Brutus logo appears on the front cover of each magazine and in much of the advertising, public relations, and sponsorship material. Heritage Iron uses vibe stripes throughout its magazine and advertising pieces as a visual reminder of the way the muscle tractors were painted. Vibe stripes are stripes on a tractor that begin as a thin stripe and gradually become thicker. Heritage Iron has its own line of toy muscle tractors manufactured and sold through SpecCast Toys of Dyersville, Iowa. Two highly detailed 1/64 scale toys will be released each year starting in 2011 and will continue for the next five years. All the tractors will be a part of the ‚ÄúHeritage Iron Series\\", and the first toy muscle tractor will be an Oliver 2255.

Heritage Iron is also available in over 700 Tractor Supply stores and select newsstands throughout the United States.  Publisher & Editor  Sherry Schaefer is a Greenville, Illinois (Bond County) native who grew up around tractors and equipment. Her grandfather, Ervin Schaefer, was an Oliver tractor dealer in both Granite City and Hamel, Illinois from 1936 -1965. Her father, Oliver ‚ÄúOllie‚Äù Schaefer, is a used Oliver tractor and equipment dealer in Greenville, Illinois. The Schaefer family also owned and operated a national tractor pulling sled service for more than 25 years beginning in the late 1960s. When she was not tractor- pulling, Schaefer worked as a truck driver hauling grain to elevators along the Mississippi River. The hours she spent on the farm loading grain and tractor pulling gave her vast exposure to tractors of all makes and models to which she gained an affection for. In 1993 Schaefer became the editor of the Hart-Parr Oliver Collectors magazine. Schaefer served in this capacity for 10 ¬Ω years before venturing out on her own. Schaefer began her own bi-monthly Oliver publication in 2004, known as Oliver Heritage Magazine. In 2008 she took a giant step and formed her own publishing company, 3-Point Ink, LLC, in Nokomis, IL. At the same time, she started a new bi-monthly tractor publication, known as Heritage Iron Magazine. Schaefer is in possession of the largest, most comprehensive collection of Oliver literature in the world, in addition to an abundant collection of literature regarding all makes and models of farm equipment. Her personal library has proved to be a tremendous asset to the editorial content of her magazines. Schaefer has authored three books: Farm Tractor Collectibles, (MBI Publishing, in 1998), Oliver Tractors, (MBI Publishing, in 2001), and Classic Oliver Tractors: History, Models, Variations & Specifications 1855-1976, (Voyageur Press, 2009). Additionally, Schaefer has provided her expertise in other tractor-related books including: A Guide to Hart-Parr, Oliver and White Farm Tractors 1901-1996 by Larry Gay, Oliver Farm Tractors by T. Herbert Morrell, Oliver Photographic History by April Halberstadt and Ultimate American Farm Tractor Data Book Nebraska Test Tractors 1920-1960 by Lorry Dunning. In January 2003, Schaefer was picked and approved by the Smithsonian Institution to assist with the restoration of the oldest mass-production gasoline tractor in existence. The tractor had not been in working condition since 1960, and a small team of experts were chosen to bring the tractor back to life for its 100-year anniversary. In August 2003, Schaefer was an expert witness in Washington, D.C. to defend the Chinese Embassy regarding an international trade commission complaint filed by a US tractor manufacturer. She is an executive board member of the Illinois Rural Heritage Museum and a lifetime honorary member of the American Farm Heritage Museum. She has been the guest speaker at numerous community organizations and national tractor club gatherings. In 2011, Schaefer was honored by the I&I; Tractor Club with an award of appreciation for her many contributions. Schaefer regularly travels around the country to visit with former executives, engineers, employees, and farmers who are/were involved with the manufacture or use of farm equipment. She also attends various trade shows, toy shows, and tractor exhibits to share her passion of the farm equipment hobby. She also serves as a publisher and editor of Oliver Heritage Magazine, an all Oliver tractor bi-monthly publication. right ReferencesExternal links * Heritage Iron Website * 3-Point Ink Website * Half Century of Progress * Half Century of Progress - News * www.nebraskatestlab.com * Oliver Heritage Website * www.thisweekinagribusiness.com * www.americanfarmheritagemuseum.com * Heritage Iron/AGWEB Blog Transport magazines published in the United States Magazines established in 2008 Bimonthly magazines published in the United States Magazines published in Illinois ","title":"Heritage Iron Magazine"},{"id":"31296295","text":"The Treaty of Blois (1504), also known as the First Treaty of Blois,Kitchin, George William.

The result was a victory for the Cambodian People's Party (CPP), which won 64 of the 122 seats, resulting in its leader Hun Sen becoming Prime Minister. Opposition parties sought a recount and claimed there had been irregularities, claims supported by many international observers. Voter turnout was 93.7%.Dieter Nohlen, Florian Grotz & Christof Hartmann (2001) Elections in Asia: A data handbook, Volume II, p70 Background Following the disputed 1993 general elections, Norodom Ranariddh of FUNCINPEC and Hun Sen of the CPP had become co-Prime Ministers. In July 1997, Sen forced Ranariddh out of government after a dispute on to handle rebellious members of FUNCINPEC and former Khmer Rouge leaders. Ranariddh was subsequently replaced by Ung Huot. The removal of Ranariddh led to at least 89 extra-judicial killings. General elections were announced for May 1998, but were later postponed until July by the National Assembly as preparations including voter registration were running late.Elections held in 1998 IPU On 30 March 1997 an opposition rally outside the National Assembly was hit by a grenade attack, with at least 16 killed and 100 injured. Electoral system The 122 members of the National Assembly were elected by closed list proportional representation from 21 multi-member constituencies based on the provinces. There were 1,380 individual polling stations. At the end of polling, ballot boxes were taken to Commune Election Commissions set up by the National Election Committee (NEC) and were counted the next day. Statements regarding the count were added up at the Provincial Election Commissions, and the national tally made at the NEC. Parties could make complaints at any of the four levels during the count.Patrick Vander Weyden (1998) \\"Parliamentary elections in Cambodia 1998\\" Electoral Studies, Volume 19, Issue 4, pp615‚Äì621 The results were countersigned and the statement of the count were announced outside the counting centers. Conduct The observation of the election was coordinated by the United Nations with its Joint International Observer Group (JIOG), which consisted of European Union and ASEAN representatives. More than 500 foreign monitors worked alongside a national observer group to keep track of the voting process. Many observers and other international organizations reported that the electoral process was heavily influenced by the CPP and that there had been intimidation, violence, coercion, lack of accountability and transparency. Following the elections, opposition party politicians and activists were reported to be relocating towards provincial cities and Phnom Penh and many were concerned about concealing their location due to fear of persecution. A lack of training, many complicated forms, and packing procedures caused difficulties with the election count, especially in areas with low levels of education, literacy, and electoral experience. The NEC noted that there was a lack of space and planning, to the point where it was difficult to retrieve controls and recounts. Ballot materials were stacked on top of each other, which made it hard for the NEC to deal with the large number of complaints and demands for recounts. In total there were 800 complaints filed, 304 passing preliminary investigation related to voter intimidation, recount demands, and other concerned programs. ResultsAftermath On 30 June, there was controversy surrounding the seat allocation formula. The English-language press of Phnom Penh and opposition parties claimed that the formula had been tampered with after the election results have been collected in order to favor the CPP. Annex V of the Law on the Election of National Assembly described the seat allocation method and all parties were informed and agreed to it in June. However, there appeared to be a difference between the original Khmer version and the English version. The misunderstanding led to large protests from the opposition.

This negotiation was a step in the conflict that led to the Scottish Reformation. Although its immediate effect was the withdrawal of Protestant forces from Edinburgh, subsequent disputes over the content and observance of the treaty fuelled the crisis in Scotland. The Reformation crisis Following religious riots which began at Perth, the Protestant Lords had taken up arms against Mary of Guise and the French troops that supported her rule in Scotland. The Lords occupied Edinburgh in June 1559, taking Holyroodhouse and seizing the coining equipment from the Scottish Mint. News came that Henry II of France had died, which cheered John Knox who supposed this might halt further French intervention. However, a Catholic army approached from Dunbar, and the Captain of Edinburgh Castle, Lord Erskine, declared for the Queen Regent. The French troops moved into Leith, which surrendered without resistance, in part due to the persuasion of Robert Logan of Restalrig. The Lords of the Congregation marshalled themselves at Craigengalt. Under these circumstances, they were compelled to seek terms and withdraw from Edinburgh, rather than fight a battle they could not win. The resultant articles of truce were drafted at Leith Links on 24 July 1559. The next day the Earls of Argyll and Glencairn, Lord James and other Lords of the Congregation met Guise's supporters, the Duke of Ch√¢tellerault and Earl of Huntly at the 'Quarrel Holes' between Edinburgh and Leith, and they promised to withdraw their support for Guise if she broke any point of the articles.Calderwood, David, History of the Kirk of Scotland, vol. 1 Wodrow Society (1842), p. 487. The articles were subscribed by the Lords on 25 July 1559, and included important concessions to their religion. Henri Cleutin, the Earl of Huntly and the Duke of Ch√¢tellerault signed on behalf of Mary of Guise.Knox, John, History of the Reformation, bk. 2; Laing, David, ed., The Works of John Knox, vol. 1 (Edinburgh, 1846), pp. 374-81. William Kirkcaldy of Grange sent news of the agreement to James Croft at Berwick-upon- Tweed.Calendar State Papers Scotland, vol. 1 (London, 1898), pp. 233-234 no. 505. Articles of the appointment A copy of the articles written in French as agreed with Mary of Guise on 23 July 1559 survives. She promised a review of the religious settlement and church property in the Parliament of Scotland on 10 January 1560. In summary: # The Lords will depart from Edinburgh as the Queen Regent pleases. # The Lords will return the coining-irons seized from the mint (to Master Robert Richardson), and render Holyrood Palace to its 'concierge,' (Master James Balfour), leaving Lord Ruthven and John Wishart of Pitarrow as hostages. # The Lords will give all due obedience to Mary, Queen of Scots, Francis II of France and the Queen Regent, and the law, as before, except in the matter of religion. # The Lords will not molest churchmen, or their property and appointments. # The Lords will use no force against churches or monasteries. # Edinburgh shall choose and use its own form of religion, the inhabitants shall follow their conscience till 10 January. # The Queen Regent shall not molest Protestant preachers or their possessions. Each should live in private according to his conscience.Calendar State Papers Scotland, vol. 1 (Edinburgh, 1898), 231-2 no. 500. Aftermath Although the Lords of the Congregation withdrew from Edinburgh to Stirling after the conclusion of the 'Leith Agreement,' it did not lead to six months of relative tranquillity until a parliament in January 1560. Instead, numbers of French troops arrived in support of the Regent. The Lords claimed that this was in contravention of an article of the Leith agreement that proscribed garrisons of soldiers in Edinburgh. However, French copies of the articles lack this specific item.Calderwood, David, History of the Kirk of Scotland, vol. 1 (Wodrow Society, Edinburgh, 1842), pp. 484-489. As early as 28 August 1559, Guise made a public proclamation that she had not violated the truce and rumours that she had breached the appointment were the work of the Congregation.Ritchie, Pamela E., Mary of Guise in Scotland, A Political Career (Tuckwell, East Linton, 2002), pp. 224-230. In respect of the sixth article of the agreement, the Duke, Huntly, and the Provost of Edinburgh, Lord Seton, could not persuade the town to allow the Catholic Mass in St Giles.Knox, John, History of the Reformation, bk. 2; Laing ed., vol. 1, (Edinburgh, 1846), 389-90. The congregation continued to gain support; Ch√¢tellerault changed sides after his son, the Earl of Arran was smuggled home from France by English agents. Sir James Croft had told Scottish agents when the Leith agreement was made that Elizabeth I of England could not deal with a 'confused multitude' and Arran's presence was required to lay a foundation.Calendar State Papers Scotland, vol. 1 (Edinburgh, 1898), p. 231 no. 499, 233 no. 505. With the former Regent as its figurehead the Congregation was able to broker English military support by the Treaty of Berwick. After the death of Mary of Guise, and the conclusion of the Siege of Leith, Scotland became a Protestant country with a Catholic monarch.

Career Vogel was born in Leninskoye, a district of Bishkek, the capital of Kyrgyzstan, and moved to Germany with her parents when she was six months old. In 2007 and 2008 she competed at the Junior European and World Championships and became a six-time junior world champion and two-time junior European champion. In April 2009, Vogel was seriously injured after a collision with a minibus when riding on the roads near her home in Erfurt. She was in an artificial coma for two days. She recovered to compete at the 2010 UCI Track Cycling World Championships, where she finished fifth in the individual sprint and sixth in the team sprint alongside Miriam Welte. She also competed at the 2011 UCI Track Cycling World Championships. 2012 Track World Championships At the 2012 UCI Track Cycling World Championships in Melbourne, Vogel and Welte won the gold medal in the team sprint. They set a world record in qualifying which they broke again in the final. Vogel and Welte went on to win the first ever Olympic gold medal in the women's team sprint later that year in London, benefiting from competitors being relegated in both the semifinal and final. At the 2016 Summer Olympics, she won another gold, in the women's sprint, and a bronze medal in the women's team sprint again with Miriam Welte. On 26 June 2018, in the Cottbus velodrome, Vogel collided at high speed with a Dutch junior cyclist who was practising a standing start. The heavy impact on the concrete floor caused several fractures, severing her spinal cord at the seventh thoracic vertebrae and consequently caused paraplegia. Vogel's teammate Maximilian Levy was the first to come to her aid, and following the accident, he and fellow cyclist Max D√∂rnbach, using the hashtag #staystrongkristina, went on to raise ‚Ç¨119,752 for her recovery. The Dutch cyclist was uninjured, but Vogel was left paralysed. In addition to her track cycling career, Vogel was a part-time police officer before her accident. In 2019, she entered politics, standing for election as a candidate for the Christian Democratic Union of Germany in Erfurt city council elections.

It is included in Petra's inscription as a UNESCO World Heritage Site. Excavation history It was first excavated by Diana Kirkbride in 1957 and later by Brian Byrd. Periods of settlement Three periods of occupation were detected: the Natufian period in the 11th millennium BC, a Pre-Pottery Neolithic B (PPNB) village with masonry construction in the 7th millennium BC and a Nabatean period dating to the 1st or 2nd century BC. =Natufian period= Natufian Beidha is characterized as a seasonal encampment, repeatedly occupied over a long period of time. Evidence from lithics recovered along with the layout and position of hearths and roasting areas suggested the occupants were primarily engaged in hunting related activities. This was supported by the absence of permanent buildings, storage, burials and large stone implements. =Neolithic period= The Neolithic stage at Beidha has been suggested to be one of the earliest villages with habitation dated between 7200 and 6500 BC. In the earliest PPNB phases, the population has been estimated at between 50 and 115 people. These villagers used stone masonry and built a wall around the settlement of round houses with subterranean floors. Its occupants cultivated barley and emmer wheat in an early state of domestication, herded goats, and hunted a variety of wild animals such as ibex and gathered wild plants, fruits and nuts. Burials were found in an area of the settlement thought to be used for ritual purposes. Evidence shows it was destroyed by fire c. 6650 BC and then rebuilt with rectangular, overground buildings and specialized workshops. At the height of habitation, the population has been estimated at anywhere between 125 and 235 people. Around 6500 BC the village was abandoned again, for unknown reasons. Many of the materials recovered came from some distance and included Anatolian obsidian and mother of pearl from the Red Sea. The transition to right-angled buildings shows an important development in human society that may have contributed the development of cities. There is also a structure dating from this period some yards east of the main site which has been interpreted as possibly being a temple for the practice of what may have been a pre-Abrahamic religion. (The layout of the structure is that of a temple, but there are no signs of any 'graven images' ever having been present.) =Nabataean period= There is also plentiful evidence of a renowned Nabataean settlement in the area including construction of a series of walls around agricultural terraces. Site protection and development The Jordanian Department of Antiquities, Petra Development and Tourism Region Authority, USAID/Jordan Tourism Development Project and the Council for British Research in the Levant recently announced in 2010 a project to protect and promote Beidha. This was suggested to take up to 18 months and planned to include an interpretative presentation and new visitor facilities.Luck, Taylor., The Jordan Times - New project to promote Neolithic site of Beidha - 19 August 2010 See also *List of World Heritage Sites in the Arab States ReferencesExternal links * The Megalithic Portal Entry * Beidha - Photo gallery at Nabataea.net Petra Neolithic settlements Natufian sites Archaeological type sites ","title":"Beidha (archaeological site)"},{"id":"31296556","text":"Jeffrey Graham Tolchard (born 17 March 1944) is an English former cricketer and footballer. Tolchard was a right-handed batsman who bowled right-arm medium pace and who occasionally kept wicket. As a footballer, Tolchard played for Torquay United, Exeter City and Loughborough. He was born in Torquay, Devon. Cricket career Tolchard made his debut for Devon in the 1963 Minor Counties Championship against Oxfordshire. He played Minor counties matches for Devon until 1969. His debut in List A cricket came in Devon's first List A match in the 1969 Gillette Cup against Hertfordshire. After playing for the Leicestershire Second XI for a number of seasons, Tolchard made his first- class debut for Leicestershire in the 1970 County Championship against Yorkshire. His List A debut for Leicestershire also came in 1970 against Hampshire in the 1970 John Player League. Tolchard played 77 first-class matches and 40 List A matches until the end of the 1977 season, which was his final season with Leicestershire. His first-class batting records for Leicestershire were those of a somewhat inconsistent batsman; he did not average above 30 in any of his 7 seasons with Leicestershire, with his final season in 1977 yielding his highest season average of 28.62. In his seven seasons with Leicestershire, he scored 1,863 runs at an average of 20.25, with nine half centuries and a high score of 78. In List A cricket, he scored 349 runs at an average of 20.52, with a high score of 46*. Following his departure from Leicestershire, Tolchard rejoined his native county of Devon for the 1978 season. Two seasons later, in 1980, he played for the Minor Counties cricket team in the 1980 Benson & Hedges Cup, playing twelve List A matches for the team up to 1983. He also represented the Minor Counties in a single first- class match in 1981 against the touring Sri Lankans. Tolchard opened the batting in the Minor Counties first-innings, scoring 2 runs before having to retire hurt. He continued to represent Devon in Minor Counties cricket, even playing a single MCCA Knockout Trophy match in 1983 against Buckinghamshire in 1983. His final Minor Counties Championship match had come in the previous season, although his final List A match did come in 1983, in a NatWest Trophy match against his former county. Football career Tolchard played football for Torquay United (1963‚Äì1965), Exeter City (1965‚Äì1966) and Loughborough United. Personal life Tolchard has been described as coming from a sports mad family. His brother, Roger, played Test cricket for England and his youngest brother, Ray, had a List A career with Devon. Tolchard's nephew, Roger Twose, played Test and One Day International cricket for New Zealand, having emigrated there. Richard Twose, also his nephew, played for Devon. Ray's son Sam Tolchard plays lawn bowls for England and represented England in the 2010 Commonwealth Games.

He is best known for the drawings that he contributed to Punch and for his illustrations of scenes from Shakespeare's plays. Much of his work was drawn in a humorous bohemian style. He was well known for the quality of his illustrations, although the critical reception of his work was often mixed. Career \\"John Bull's Idol\\" by Kenny Meadows. Published in 1843 in Punch Meadows' first major project was Heads of the People in 1840. His acquaintance with Douglas Jerrold allowed him to become the illustrator of the project. Other contributors to the book included William Makepeace Thackeray and Leigh Hunt. He also contributed to The Illuminated Magazine, which was edited by Jerrold as well. In addition, he drew several illustrations for the Christmas editions of Illustrated London News. Meadows became a prominent artist due to his work for Punch. He contributed fourteen total drawings to the paper. They were published in 1843 and 1844, appearing in the first through the seventh volumes. He worked very closely with John Leech while they were employed there. At the time that he first began working for Punch he was one of its oldest contributors. William Powell Frith once described him as \\"perhaps the best\\" of Punch's early illustrators. Other critics have stated that the quality the work that he produced varied. His drawings were hailed by some commentators more thoughtful than the typical burlesque treatments the subjects of his drawings often received. Others have faulted his work for a lack of humour and inventiveness. He was often noted, however, for the youthful enthusiasm he had toward drawing. His drawings often included the depiction of a butterfly at the mouth of a cannon, which symbolisied peace. A similar design was used by Sir Edwin Henry Landseer in a painting, and some have attributed this similarity to Meadows' influence on Landseer. Meadows often read Shakespeare and memorised many passages. He published a volume of illustrated scenes from Shakespeare in 1843. Though he and several of his friends considered this work to be his masterpiece, some reviewers criticised his interpretations of several characters. It was particularly well received in Germany, however. He continued working on depictions of scenes from Shakespeare for his entire life. Personal life Meadows was the son of a Naval officer and was born in Cardigan. Although his first name was Joseph, he listed his name as Kenny Meadows in professional use. He lived in Camden Town for much of his life. He was married to the sister of Archibald Henning, a fellow artist who contributed to Punch. Meadow's wife was very frugal, and he allowed her to run the household's finances. One of their daughters married James Hannay, who wrote for Punch in the 1850s. Meadows, who was known to be very outgoing and a night owl, spent much of his time visiting with friends and drinking gin. He was a friend of many prominent writers, including Charles Dickens, Henry Vizetelly and William Godwin.

Early years and education Zimmern was born in Nottingham, the youngest of the three daughters of the lace merchant Hermann Theodore Zimmern, a German immigrant, and his wife Antonia Marie Therese Regina Zimmern. Alice collaborated with her elder sister Helen Zimmern on two volumes of translated excerpts from European novels (1880 and 1884). The scholar and political scientist Alfred Eckhard Zimmern was a cousin of hers. She was educated at a private school and at Bedford College, London, before entering Girton College, Cambridge in 1881 to read Classics. In 1888‚Äì1894, she taught Classics at English girls' schools, including Tunbridge Wells High School (1888‚Äì1891).ODNB entry: Retrieved 25 March 2011. Subscription required. Career While teaching, Zimmern produced a school edition of the Meditations of Marcus Aurelius in 1887, a translation of Hugo Bluemner's The Home Life of the Ancient Greeks (1893), and a translation of Porphyry: The Philosopher to his Wife Marcella (1896). She later wrote children's books on ancient Greece (Greek History for Young Readers, 1895, Old Tales from Greece, 1897) and Rome (Old Tales from Rome, 1906), all of which were reprinted several times. Greek History for Young Readers was still being praised in the Parents' Review six years later.\\"Orpheus. Adapted by Alice Zimmern\\", excerpt from Old Tales from Greece.

This resulted in her book Methods of Education in America (1894), in which she praised the articulacy of American school students and their enthusiasm for classic English literature, but noted that their written work and their textbooks were of a poor standard and the teaching of American history ludicrously patriotic.Methods of Education in the United States available online. Retrieved 25 March 2011. Zimmern ceased to teach in schools in 1894, but continued to tutor private students in Classics. She regularly wrote journal articles on comparative education and the education of women. Her book Women's Suffrage in Many Lands (1909) appeared to coincide with the Fourth Congress of the International Women's Suffrage Alliance. This book and The Renaissance of Girls' Education (1898) made big contributions to the debate on the education and rights of women in Zimmern's time. In the former she noted an \\"intimate... connexion between enfranchisement and the just treatment of women.\\" While most of her arguments are moderate and pragmatic, she acknowledges the militant tactics of British suffragettes as effective in making women's suffrage \\"the question of the day\\".Lissenden Gardens centenary site.

Frank. (eds.) Description This beetle has a light brown elongated oval body between four and eight millimetres long. The head is slightly wider than it is long and there are globular, protruding eyes. The antennae have ten segments, the distal six expanded on one side to form pectinate clubs, though these are less developed in the female. The prothorax is wider than it is long and widest posteriorly. The elytra have nine weakly impressed punctate striae and are broadly rounded at the posterior. The hind wings are as long as they are wide and have oblique, apically dividing, linear sclerites. The male beetle is smaller than the female and is much the same width for most of its length whereas the female is broadest in the posterior third of its length.Brachypsectridae The larva is pale coloured, up to fifteen millimetres long, flattened and broadly ovate. The head is dark and much narrower than the prothorax. The antennae and legs are well developed. There are fairly long lateral lobes lined with elongate feathery lobules on all the thoracic segments and on the first eight abdominal segments. The upper side is armed with heavily sclerotized, scale-like setae. The posterior abdominal segments are much narrower and darker coloured and form a short tail which may be held in an elevated position. The number of instars and the length of the life cycle are not known, but in captivity, some larvae lived for over two years without feeding.Barber, H. S. 1905. Illustrations of an undetermined coleopterous larva. Proc. Entomol. Soc. Wash. 1: 117-121. Some larvae reared by M. K. Thayer moulted twice before pupating. The cocoon was surrounded by a silken net connecting the two sides of the narrow pupation chamber. The beetle emerged after about six weeks.Neck, R. W. 1993. Notes on habitats and rearing of Brachypsectra fulva LeConte (Coleoptera: Brachypsectridae). Coleopt. Bull. 47: 291-292. Biology Though the larvae of this beetle had been known for a long time, they were described by Gordon Floyd Ferris in 1927 as an \\"entomological enigma\\".Ferris, G. F. 1927. Notes on an entomological enigma. Can. Entomol. 59: 279-281. This was because it had not previously been known into what adult form they would develop. Adult beetles are seldom seen but they are attracted by light and the males are on the wing between May and August. The larvae are found under loose bark on trees, in leaf litter and in cracks in rocks. There seems to be no association with any particular plant group but they choose habitats that are rich in insects and other arthropods. The larvae are predators that ambush their prey. They are well camouflaged and remain stationary until approached by prey. Food species include small spiders, pseudoscorpions, cockroaches, termites, and beetle larvae in the families Trogossitidae, Nitidulidae and Tenebrionidae.Fleenor, S. B., and S. W. Taber. 1999. Review of Brachypsectra LeConte with a new record of the Texas beetle (B. fulva LeConte; Coleoptera: Brachypsectridae). Coleopt. Bull. 53: 359-364. In a research study, larvae in captivity were offered spiders in the genus Metepeira. They made no effort to pounce on the spiders, but when one climbed on the back of the larva, it arched its tail and head, trapping the spider between the tail spine and the mandibles. The larva then devoured the spider, at the same time relaxing its tail. In another study, several spiders were released in the presence of a single larva and they were all later found congregated on its back. The researchers thought it possible that the larva released an allomone which attracted the spiders.Crowson, R. A. 1973.

On 16 February 1992, an IRA unit attacked the Royal Ulster Constabulary security base in the village of Coalisland in County Tyrone, and was ambushed shortly afterwards by the Special Air Service (SAS) in the grounds of a church in the village of Clonoe whilst attempting to make its escape, resulting in several IRA fatalities. Background :See also: Loughgall ambush, Ballygawley bombing, Derrygorry Gazelle shootdown and Coagh ambush From 1985 onwards, the IRA in East Tyrone had been at the forefront of a campaign against British state police and army facilities and their personnel. In 1987, an East Tyrone IRA unit was ambushed with eight of its members being killed by the SAS while they were making an attack on a police station in Loughgall, County Armagh. This was the IRA's greatest loss of life in a single incident during The Troubles. Despite these losses, the IRA's campaign continued, with it attacking nearly 100 police and military facilities over the next five years, wrecking thirty three and damaging the remainder to varying degrees.Toolis, Kevin (1995). Rebel Hearts: journeys within the IRA's soul. Picador, p. 53; The SAS ambush had no noticeable long- term effect on the level of IRA activity in East Tyrone.

Operation Banner: The British Army in Northern Ireland 1969 to 2007. Pen & Sword Military, p. 179. Another high-profile attack of the East Tyrone Brigade was carried out on 11 January 1990 near Augher, where a Gazelle helicopter was shot down.Bruce, Ian.

On 3 June 1991, three IRA men, Lawrence McNally, Michael \\"Pete\\" Ryan and Tony Doris, were killed at the town of Coagh, when a stolen car they were driving in on their way to kill an off-duty Ulster Defence Regiment soldier was ambushed by the Special Air Service. Ryan was the same man who, according to Irish journalist and author Ed Moloney, had led an attack on Derryard checkpoint on the orders of IRA Army Council member 'Slab' Murphy two years earlier.Moloney, Ed (2003).

The Secret History of the IRA. W.W. Norton & Co., pp. 313-19; The ambush At 10.30 P.M. during the night of 16 February 1992, a stolen car and lorry carrying multiple IRA attackers drove into the centre of the village of Coalisland and, pulling up at its fortified Royal Ulster Constabulary security base, fired 30 rounds of armour-piercing tracer ammunition into it at close range from a Soviet Union made DSHK heavy machine- gun that they had mounted on the back of the lorry. The heavy machine gun was fired by IRA member Kevin O'Donnell, the rest of the unit being armed with Soviet made AKM assault rifles. The IRA attackers then drove off at speed up Annagher hill, without any apparent pursuit from the security forces. Whilst making their escape they drove past the home of Tony Doris, an IRA man who had been killed by the British Army the previous year, where they stopped to fire into the air, shouting: \\"Up the 'RA, that's for Tony Doris!\\". After this they drove on at speed to the car park of St. Patrick's Roman Catholic Church in the village of Clonoe, two miles away from Coalisland police station, arriving at 10.45 P.M., where getaway cars were waiting. Immediately on arrival, the IRA attackers were in the process of preparing to abandon the attack vehicles and dismounting the DShk to take with them when they were assailed by a British Army detachment that had been lying in wait for them in the car park's perimeter, primarily composed of soldiers from the Special Air Service, which raked them with sustained automatic fire. Patrick Vincent (20 years of age), the driver of the stolen lorry, was shot dead with five bullets whilst still in its cab. Peter Clancy (19) (hit by ten bullets) and Kevin O'Donnell (21) (shot twice) were killed whilst dismounting the DShk on the back of the lorry. Sean O'Farrell (23) was pursued on foot across the church grounds over a distance of 100 yards before being shot dead with five bullets whilst trying to clamber over a fence. Two other IRA men, one of them being Aidan McKeever, who were found sitting in a car in the car park with the intention of acting as getaway drivers, surrendered after being wounded and were taken prisoner.'Ambush, Assassination & Impunity', (Pub. Relatives for Justice, February 2012). The roof of the church was accidentally set on fire after a stray round hit a fuel storage tank. One British soldier was wounded during the confrontation. An IRA statement reported that another active service unit made of at least four volunteers taking part of the operation at Coalisland \\"escaped unharmed\\". Several witnesses to the ambush later claimed that some of the IRA men tried to surrender to the British Army engaging unit during the ambush, but were summarily executed.O'Brien, pp. 232‚Äì35 Mr Justice Treacy of Northern Ireland's High Court awarded McKeever, the IRA getaway driver, ‚Ç§75,000 in damages in 2011. It is unclear whether or not this decision was appealed, or whether the damages were ever paid.Aidan McKeever, IRA getaway driver, awarded ‚Ç§75,000 by Justice Treacy, bbc.co.uk; accessed 19 August 2015. =Internal IRA criticism= A local IRA source pointed out areas of incompetence in the attack by the IRA unit involved that led to its destruction: * The use of a long-range weapon for a short-range shooting. The DShK could be used up to 2,000 metres from the target, and its armour-piercing capabilities at 1,500 metres are still considerable. * The use of tracer rounds was ill-judged as they easily reveal the firing location of the gun if it is not being fired from a well-hidden position. *The escape route was chosen at random, with the machine-gun in full sight and the support vehicle flashing its hazard lights. *The gathering of so many men at the same place after such an attack was another factor in the failure to escape for most of the attacking force. Aftermath During the funeral services for O'Donnell and O'Farrell in Coalisland, the parish priest criticised the security forces for what happened at Clonoe church, which had resulted in the deaths of the four IRA men. The priest, Fr. MacLarnon, then appealed to the IRA and Sinn F√©in to replace \\"the politics of confrontation with the politics of cooperation\\".Father MacLarnon comments at O'Donnell/O'Farrell funerals, books.google.com; accessed 19 August 2015. While Francis Molloy, a local Sinn F√©in councillor, walked out of the church in protest, leading Sinn F√©in politicians Gerry Adams and Martin McGuinness remained in their seats. There were hundreds of Royal Ulster Constabulary police officers outside the church during the funeral, the RUC having changed its policy after the Milltown Cemetery attack. This show of force was criticised by Sinn F√©in. This was the last occasion that IRA members were killed in a series of ambushes by the British Army, spearheaded by the Special Air Service, in Northern Ireland.Taylor, Peter (2001).

(It took over the personnel and mission of the 4th Battalion, 2d Infantry Training Brigade.) On 1 October 2005 it was redesignated as the 2d Battalion, 58th Infantry Regiment. The battalion is tasked to provide trained and ready soldiers for the Army as part of the 198th Infantry Brigade. History The 58th Infantry was constituted on 15 May 1917 in the Regular Army as the 58th Infantry and organized 5 June 1917 at Gettysburg National Park, Pennsylvania, from personnel of the 4th Infantry Regiment. Assigned to the 4th Infantry Division 19 November 1917. Inactivated 21 June 1922 at Fort George Wright, Washington, disbanded 31 July 1922. Reconstituted 8 April 1942 in the Regular Army as the 58th Infantry Regiment. Activated 24 April 1942 at Fort Lewis, Washington. Regiment broken up 26 January 1944 and its elements reorganized and redesigned as follows: * Headquarters disbanded. * 1st Battalion as the 203d Infantry Battalion (inactivated 2 March 1945 at Camp Shelby, Mississippi) * 2d Battalion as the 204th Infantry Battalion (inactivated 8 March 1945 at Camp Shelby, Mississippi) * 3d Battalion as the 205th Infantry Battalion (inactivated 8 March 1945 at Camp Shelby, Mississippi) Headquarters, 58th Infantry reconstituted 10 July 1951 in the Regular Army and consolidated with the 203d Infantry Battalion (inactivated 2 March 1945 at Camp Shelby, Mississippi) and with the 58th Armored Infantry Battalion (constituted 15 May 1917 in the Regular Army as the 1st Battalion, 49th Infantry) and consolidated unit designated as the 58th Armored Infantry Battalion, an element of the 8th Armored Division. Relieved from the 8th Armored Division 23 July 1956. Activated 15 August 1956 in Germany; inactivated 9 August 1957 in Germany. 204th Infantry Battalion inactivated 8 March 1945 at Camp Shelby, Mississippi. Redesignated 30 September 1948 as the 43d Armored Infantry Battalion. Activated 28 January 1949 at Fort Sill, Oklahoma as an element of the 2d Armored Division. Relieved from the 2d Armored Division and inactivated 1 July 1957 in Germany. 205th Infantry Battalion inactivated 6 March 1945 at Camp Shelby, Mississippi Redesignated 18 June 1948 as the 45th Armored Infantry Battalion and assigned to the 5th Armored Division, then serving in a training role. Activated 6 July 1948 at Camp Chaffee, Arkansas. Inactivated 1 February 1950 at Camp Chaffee. Relieved from the 5th Armored Division 15 February 1957. 58th, 43d, and 45th Armored Infantry Battalions consolidated 1 July 1959 to form the 58th Infantry, a parent regiment under the Combat Arms Regimental System. Company C, 58th Infantry was assigned to the 194th Infantry Brigade (later redesignated as the 194th Armored Brigade) on 2 October 1962 and activated on 21 December 1962 at Fort Ord, CA, as a mechanized infantry company. Its existence was brief, however, and the unit was inactivated on 15 May 1964. On 15 May 1965 Company C was activated in Germany at Nellingen, Germany, by HQ USAREUR General Order 127, 11 May 1965, under the provisions of TOE 7-157E (Infantry Long Range Patrol Company). The order assigned the company to the Seventh Army. HQ Seventh Army General Order 87, 3 August 1965, further assigned the company to VII Corps. Although not included in the designation, the TOE required that all personnel be Airborne qualified. The unit was formed from personnel and equipment of the US Army Long Range Reconnaissance Patrol Company (Airborne) which was inactivated on 15 May 1965 by HQ USAREUR General Order 120, 6 May 1965. Captain Raymond H. Miller was the commander. At the time it was activated, Company C (Long Range Patrol), 58th Infantry, had an authorized strength of six officers and 159 enlisted personnel. At the same time C-58th was activated in VII Corps, Company D (LRP), 17th Infantry was activated in V Corps. Company C later relocated to Fort Carson, CO, where it was inactivated on 10 February 1969 as the unit was reflagged as Company B (Ranger), 75th Infantry. Companies D, E, and F, 58th Infantry served in Vietnam. *Company D deployed from Fort Lewis, WA to Vietnam on November 29, 1966 and would remain in Vietnam until 22 June 1972. Co D served as \\"a rifle security company attached to the 93d Military Police Battalion at Phu Thang, being transferred in 1969 to the 18th Military Police Brigade control at Qui Nhon. It was later posted to Phu Tai under the U.S. Army Support Command, Cam Ranh Bay.\\" *Company E served as a Long Range Patrol (LRP) company to the 4th Infantry Division from 20 December 1967 ‚Äì 1 February 1969, when all LRP companies were reflagged as lettered Ranger companies to the 75th Infantry Regiment. Co E 58th (LRP) would become Co K, 75th Infantry (RANGER) in 1969. *Company F served as a LRP company to the 101st Airborne Division (Airmobile) from 10 January 1968 ‚Äì 1 February 1969 when it was reflagged as Co L, 75th Infantry (RANGER). Co F, 58th Infantry (LRP) was based at Camp Eagle near Hue in I Corps, and operated in areas such as the A Shau Valley and the Roung Roung Valley, gathering vital intelligence on the NVA units operating and infiltrating into those areas. By 1974 the 1st Battalion, 58th infantry was a mechanized infantry battalion assigned to the 197th Infantry Brigade (Separate) at Fort Benning, Georgia. The brigade was reorganizing as a separate mechanized infantry brigade with a go to war mission as the XVIII Airborne Corps heavy force package. During the period 1973-77 the battalion supported several important Army modernization initiatives. On return from three months of gunnery and maneuver training in 1976 at McGregor Range in New Mexico (the brigade and battalion had previously deployed from Kelley Hill Barracks at Ft. Benning, Georgia to Eglin Air Force Base, Florida for a several week joint exercise), deployed Companies A and B for four months in support of the MICV (Mechanized Infantry Combat Vehicle) Developmental/Operational Tests 1 and 2. The MICV later became the Bradley Infantry Fighting Vehicle and the Tests also deployed the MILEs systems with their sensors, laser weapons effect systems and other force on force technologies later deployed to Ft. Irwin and the National Training Center. Company A was assigned a tank platoon and additional tank section from 2d Battalion, 69th Armor. The company then trained and validated as a unit capable of replicating a Soviet motorized rifle battalion. Company B formed MICV configured platoons along with its M113A1 equipped platoons to operate as a U.S. ground force against a Soviet ground force. The two companies were deployed almost continuously for four months in the Turrentine Range Area and other locations on Ft. Benning performing one force on force exercise after another to develop data that eventually led to the deployment of the Bradley Fighting vehicle to the Army. At the time Company A was an over-strength company of some 220 men (the then-MTOE authorized 187 men) having also been selected as a unit that would retrain NCOs in over strength MOSs as infantry NCOs. A provisional 4th mechanized infantry platoon was formed. This additional platoon with the three tank sections allowed the company to render a Soviet motorized rifle battalion footprint during the force on force exercises of the tests. All of this work made important contributions to the Army's highly effective heavy force capabilities that deployed in the two following Iraq Wars. The 2d Battalion, 58th Infantry was activated at Fort Hood, Texas on April 1, 1975, and assigned to the 2d Armored Division as part of Brigade 75, a program that stationed a forward brigade in Europe while maintaining three brigades at Fort Hood. The battalion deployed to Hohenfels Training Area in Germany in October 1976 as part of the rotations in place at the time, and redeployed in March 1977, remaining at Fort Hood until inactivation on May 31, 1981. On August 28, 1987, the unit was activated at Fort Benning, Georgia as part of the United States Army Training and Doctrine Command. The coat of arms was originally approved for the 58th Infantry Regiment on 18 Jun 1921. It was amended on 20 Mar 1924 to correct the shield. On 15 Aug 1942 it was redesignated for the 58th Infantry Regiment (Reinforced). The coat of arms was redesignated for the 58th Infantry on 26 November 1958.

Early life Born in Springfield, Ohio, Descombes pitched in the All- American Girls Professional Baseball League during its final two years of continuation. She had no playing participation before entering the league, but she had been involved actively in the game since she was in school. I actually had no pitching participation and had never played organized baseball... I had practiced baseball with our school team all through high school, but of course, they would not let me play in the games. I was also the batgirl for our town team of men and practiced with them and went to all the games. I loved the game and had a strong arm, she recalled in her autobiography. AAGPBL career Descombes joined the league in 1953 with the Grand Rapids Chicks. My coach and friend was 'Beansie' Risinger (pitcher Earlene Risinger), she said. At first, Grand Rapids manager Woody English let her pitch batting practice, but most of the time she had her running in the outfield, practicing until about midseason before getting her first chance to pitch. Expanding her comments about Risinger, Descombes explained that she taught her to relax and believe in herself. In her rookie season, Descombes posted a 0‚Äì1 record with a 7.45 earned run average in seven relief appearances and was a member of the Champion Team, even though she did not pitch during the postseason.All- American Girls Professional Baseball League Record Book ‚Äì W.

Life after baseball In 1957, Descombes earned degrees in sciences and mathematics from Ohio Northern University. Then she signed up to teach dependent children at Ramey Air Force Base near Aguadilla, Puerto Rico, where she stayed for four years and learned to play golf. In 1962 she flew to France to taught girls physical education in Laon, being transferred to Ch√¢teauroux a year later. While in France, she took golf lessons from an English professional golfer who played during Bobby Jones‚Äô era. She later received an opportunity to transfer in 1965 to the Clark Air Force Base in the Philippine Islands and returned to the United States in 1967, after deciding she wanted to become a professional golfer.All-American Girls Professional Baseball League ‚Äì Profile (An interview with Jeanie Descombes Lesko). Retrieved 2019-03-30. Descombes spent 1968 playing golf in Grass Valley, California. After establishing an excellent four handicap she joined the LPGA. She then competed in U.S. Women's Open tournaments at Oregon, California, Florida and Minnesota. Besides her baseball and golf interests, she also officiated basketball, volleyball and softball. In 2003, she started the Washington State Women‚Äôs Baseball Association and coached and served on the board during eight years. In the interim, she became a real estate agent. In 2005 and 2006, Descombes participated in the World Series Disney World Tournament in Orlando, Florida, as an honorary coach for the Australian Women and Girls, U11-15, baseball teams, the Aussie Hearts. In recognition of her contribution, in 2007 the Aussie Hearts sponsored her to go to Australia where she conducted many clinics and showed her AAGPBL PowerPoint presentation to hundreds of Aussie women ball players. By 2008 she was invited to be a guest coach for the Aussie Hearts at the US Women's Baseball Tournament, during the dedication of the opening of the Kenosha, Wisconsin baseball field, former home of the AAGPBL Kenosha Comets. The Aussie Hearts won the Tournament. After that, she joined the Aussies again in 2010 at the Phoenix Tournament in Hong Kong, China, where the Hearts team claimed the gold once again. Currently, Descombes plays on a senior softball team and spend much of her time supporting women in sports, balancing her time between her business venture, a real state school in Bellevue, Washington, as well as her duties for the vision and website committees of the AAGPBL Players Association.

The name is derived from Greek (Œ∫Œ∑œÅœåœÇ) and Latin words meaning \\"wax\\", \\"torch\\" or \\"candle\\". The genus Cereus was one of the first cactus genera to be described; the circumscription varies depending on the authority. The term \\"cereus\\" is also sometimes used for a ceroid cactus, any cactus with a very elongated body, including columnar growth cacti and epiphytic cacti. Description Cereus are shrubby or treelike, often attaining great heights (C. hexagonus, C. lamprospermus, C. trigonodendron up to 15 m). Most stems are angled or distinctly ribbed, ribs 3‚Äì14 cm long, usually well developed and have large areoles, usually bearing spines. Cephalium is not present, Cereus mortensenii develops pseudocephalium. Flowers are large, funnelform, 9‚Äì30 cm long, usually white, sometimes pink, purple, rarely cream, yellow, greenish, and open at night. Fruits are globose to ovoid to oblong, 3‚Äì13 cm long, fleshy, naked, usually red but sometimes yellow, pulp white, pink or red. Seeds large, curved ovoid, glossy black. Taxonomy The name Cereus originates in a book by Tabernaemontanus published in 1625 and refers to the candle-like form of species Cereus hexagonus. It was described by Philip Miller in 1754, and included all known cacti with very elongated bodies. Flower of Cereus neotetragonus Ludwig Pfeiffer in 1838 distinguished Cephalocereus (type Cephalocereus senilis); the name is derived from the Greek Œ∫ŒµœÜ·æ∂ŒªŒÆ (cephalƒì), head, thus headed cereus, referring to the hairy pseudocephalium. Charles Lemaire described Pilocereus in 1839, now renamed as Pilosocereus. The name Pilocereus is derived from the Greek œÄ·øñŒªŒøœÇ (pilos), felted, hairy, thus hairy cereus, similar to the Latin pilosus, from which the name Pilosocereus was derived. Echinocereus (type Echinocereus viridiflorus) was described in 1848 by George Engelmann; the name is derived from the Greek ·ºêœá·øñŒΩŒøœÇ (echinos), hedgehog or sea urchin. Britton & Rose (1919‚Äì1923) and Alwin Berger (1929) continued to divide Cereus into many genera. The 33 or so species that remain in the Cereus group are largely plants that have not been moved out of the genus rather than plants that have been included because they fit the description of Cereus. This inclusion-by- lack-of-exclusion makes for a very messy and unsatisfactory grouping. =Species= Cereus hexagonus at Tenneti Park in Visakhapatnam Anderson 2005 Distribution The range includes Brazil, northern Argentina, Paraguay, Uruguay, Bolivia, rarely Peru, Colombia, Guyana, Suriname and Venezuela. Uses Fruits and stems of Cereus repandus are edible. Its wood has been used in making furniture and for firewood, and sliced stems have been used as a soap substitute. It is also cultivated as a living fence.  Gallery  File:Cereus hexagonus00.jpg Charles Lemaire, Iconographie descriptive des cact√©es, 1841 ‚Äì 7.

He was elected to the Supreme Soviet of the USSR and served as a lieutenant-general of the Soviet Air Force. Biography=Early life and training= Alexander Belyakov was born in 1897 in the village of Bezzubovo, Moscow Governorate (now Orekhovo-Zuyevsky District, Moscow Oblast) and grew up in Ryazan. He studied forestry in 1915-1916 after finishing his gymnasium studies and began serving in the infantry of the Imperial Russian Army in 1916. He fought in the Soviet Russian Red Army's 25th Rifle Division during the Russian Civil War. He graduated from the Moscow Aerophotogrammetry School of the Red Air Fleet in 1921 and subsequently taught there and at the A.E.Zhukovsky Air Force Academy until 1935. He graduated from the Kachinskoye Military Aviation School for Pilots and joined the Communist Party in 1936. =1930s records=Flight to Udd Island Belyakov joined commanding pilot Valery Chkalov and co-pilot Georgy Baydukov to navigate a Tupolev ANT-25 plane on a non-stop flight from Moscow to Udd Island (now Chkalov Island) off the coast of Kamchatka in a 56-hour flight on 20‚Äì22 July 1936. Their flight, covering more than 9,374 kilometers across nearly the entire width of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics, set a record for the longest non-stop flight, preparing the way for a flight across the North Pole.McCannon, John (1998). Red Arctic: Polar Exploration and the Myth of the North in the Soviet Union, 1932-1939. New York: Oxford University Press. p. 70. . The three aviation heroes were awarded the title Hero of the Soviet Union and decorated with the Order of Lenin for the record-breaking flight. Across the North Pole to America Flying the same ANT-25 plane, Chkalov, Baydukov, and Belyakov completed an 8,504-kilometer flight from Moscow to the United States, crossing the North Pole and landing in Vancouver, Washington.

The domestic and international press coverage of the Trans-Polar flight immediately catapulted to worldwide fame and ultimate acclaim for the three aviators, who had already been regarded as Soviet heroes after their successful flight to Udd Island in 1936. The aviators' portraits were featured on a postage stamp issued to commemorate the flight. The three were elected to the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union in 1937. Alexander Belyakov was appointed head of the Ryazan Supreme School of Navigators of the Soviet Air Force in the 1940s and took part in the fighting against Nazi Germany as the 16th Air Army's chief navigator during the Battle of Berlin. Promoted to lieutenant-general during the war, he continued to serve in the Air Force and became a professor at the Moscow Institute of Physics and Technology upon his retirement from the service in 1960.

The name is the Latin-language borrowing of the Greek word meaning \\"bearing two knives\\" (di- dual + machairi knife). The dimachaeri were popular during the 2nd-4th centuries AD, and were probably considered to be \\"insidious\\" by many Romans. Both written and pictorial records on dimachaeri are scant and rather indeterminate.The Power of Spectacle in Ancient Rome: Gladiators and Caesars, ed. by Eckart K√∂hne and Cornelia Ewigleben (Berkeley and Los Angeles, 2000), p. 63. Thus, an inscription from Lyon, France, mentions such a type of gladiator, here spelled dymacherus. Equipment Depictions of dimachaeri and their equipment vary in pictorial sources, so it is difficult to say exactly how, and how uniformly, they were equipped. Some pictorial sources depict dimachaeri wearing extremely minimal armour such as a balteus and leather wrappings or none at all, save a subligaculum (loin cloth). Other show a slightly more heavily armored dimachaerus, variously equipped with scale armor, mail shirts, visored helmets in the fashion of murmillos, greaves and leg wrappings, both barefoot and in sandals. It is a mistake to suppose that dimachaeri were always identically equipped, or even similarly equipped, apart from wielding two blades. It is also entirely possible that the dimachaerus was not a separate class of gladiator at all, but a sub-discipline within a class, or even a cross- discipline practiced by multiple classes. In the late Roman Empire, when references to dimachaeri first appear, many novelties and new gladiator types were being introduced to the arena,'The private life of the Romans' Harold Whetstone Johnston (1905) p 259 and sub-classes had appeared within many gladiator types. Fighting style The dimachaeri were equipped for close- combat fighting. A dimachaerus used a pair of siccae (curved scimitar) or gladius and used a fighting style adapted to both attack and defend with his weapons rather than a shield, as he was not equipped with one.Marcus Junkelmann, 'Familia Gladiatoria: \\"The Heroes of the Amphitheatre\\"' in The Power of Spectacle in Ancient Rome: Gladiators and Caesars, ed. by Eckart K√∂hne and Cornelia Ewigleben (Berkeley and Los Angeles, 2000), p. 63. Little else is known about this class of gladiator, but due to the difficulty of wielding two swords it can be inferred that dimachaeri were ambidextrous or highly skilled and experienced fighters, and were probably relatively exalted as a class of gladiator. Dimachaeri would have been ideally suited to fight heavily armored opponents and they may have fought other dimachaeri, as well. They are known to have been paired against the hoplomachus and are also referred to as fighting against a gladiator class called an oplomachus,4\\\\. P.J.

Description The primary reason for the use of isolated grounds (IG) is to provide a noise-free ground return, separate from the equipment grounding (EG) return. The EG circuit includes all of the metal conduit, outlet boxes, and metal enclosures that contain the wiring and must be grounded to provide a safe return path in case of fault currents. The IG provides an insulated, separate ground path for the ground reference in electronic equipment, such as computers, hospital equipment, and audio equipment. IG does not break ground loops, which can damage equipment like computers, printers, etc.. Interconnected computer equipment often benefits from single-point grounding. IG is only used with special equipment that require it. The IG is typically insulated and separate all the way back to the point of earth grounding rod outside of the building. The IG is NOT connected neutral or any other. Due to the installation of a separate, insulated conductor and the associated special outlets required, IG circuits are more expensive to install than standard power circuits. Its main downside is that an isolated grounding connection has higher impedance than a non-isolated grounding connection, and no redundancy, so safety is reduced. Isolated ground receptacles are allowed in patient care areas, but only when installed outside the immediate patient care vicinity.2017 NEC 517.17 Domestic supplies Until the 1950s, isolated ground domestic mains supplies tended to have no Residual-Current Device (RCD) or Earth Leakage Circuit Breaker (ELCB), and too high a ground impedance to blow a fuse if a live-to-earth fault occurred. This could leave metalwork in the house live. The use of Residual Current Devices (RCDs) or formerly ELCBs with such installs solved this problem. Such installs are called EEBAD (Earthed Equipotential Bonding and Automatic Disconnection). The British term for isolated ground is \\"IT\\", from the French terre isol√©e. Noise An isolated ground, if installed correctly, can reduce some electrical noise. However, complete power conditioning and protection usually requires additional devices such as a surge protector or an uninterruptible power supply. If the receptacle is not installed correctly, it can create a dangerous installation.

He was convicted of first-degree murder in the death of Jeanine Grinsell, aged 16, and attempted murder of Laurie McKenna, aged 17. The two girls were attacked and kidnapped on February 2, 1985 at the Carolands mansion in Hillsborough in San Mateo County, where Raley, then aged 23, was working as a security guard. Crimes Front of Carolands, photographed by Jack Boucher for HABS in 1974 Carolands, a mansion completed in 1914 for Harriet Pullman Carolan, had been vacant since the mid 1970s and was not open to the public. However, Raley, who worked as a security guard there, was known to give unauthorized tours on occasion. Raley was especially receptive to giving tours to high school age girls, and he would provide \\"salacious commentary\\" during the tours; for example, he once requested a young female tourist enter a safe and scream to demonstrate how soundproof the location was, after which he commented that he could kill someone in the basement and no one would hear. On Saturday, February 2, 1985, Raley was interviewed by a journalism student who was writing a story about the mansion, telling her \\"You wouldn't believe the things girls offer me. Food, money, sex ‚Äì anything to get inside.\\" Later on that same Saturday, McKenna and Grinsell came to explore Carolands; they had heard stories from other students that unofficial tours were available. Raley agreed to allow them to enter provided they parked their car where it could not be seen. During the tour, he commented that guards would sometimes receive sexual favors in exchange for allowing entry; at the conclusion of the tour, he hid the women in a basement safe, saying that police dogs had arrived and that he could lose his job for allowing the tour. They begged not to be hidden there, and although he assured them he would not close the door, he did and would not release them until they had undressed to their underwear. During their captivity at the mansion, he sexually assaulted, beat, and stabbed the two women. He later bound Grinsell with rope and rolled McKenna up in a carpet, then hid them in the trunk of his car, a 1973 Plymouth. Raley's shift at the mansion ended at 4 PM, but was not relieved of his duty until his supervisor arrived at 5:15 PM. He drove to and parked in the garage of his house in south San Jose, where he let the two women out of the trunk; McKenna asked to be taken to a hospital and swore not to tell anyone who had injured them, but Raley responded with a silent \\"death stare\\" of hatred. After hearing voices, he pushed them back into the trunk and threatened to kill them if they did not remain quiet. At about 7 PM, he emerged from the garage into the house, which he shared with his sister and father, and refused dinner, then watched TV and played Monopoly with his sister until approximately 11 PM. His father returned to the house after midnight; Raley told him he had cleaned out the garage. Later, Raley moved the car with the women still inside the trunk from the garage to a parking spot across the street. After midnight, he drove to a ravine off Silver Creek Road, approximately southeast of downtown San Jose and beat them again before dumping them into the ravine, which was used as a makeshift garbage dump. The overnight weather included drizzle and temperatures close to freezing. At daybreak, McKenna, bloodied and battered, pulled herself out of the ravine and flagged down a passing pickup truck at approximately 8:30 AM. Three cars passed without stopping before the truck stopped. A jogger who encountered the two women would later testify at a preliminary hearing that both were conscious and able to talk. Both Grinsell and McKenna identified Raley as their assailant. At the time they were found, both women were still alive, but Grinsell died at 11:35 AM from blood loss, shock, and hypothermia at Santa Theresa Hospital, where they had been taken for treatment. She had been stabbed 41 times, had suffered a skull fracture, and had no measurable blood pressure. =Trial= Raley was arrested on the evening of February 3 and charged on February 6 with one count of murder, one count of attempted murder, two counts of assault with intent to commit rape, and two counts of kidnapping; due to the special circumstances, which included the torture of the two women, he was eligible for the death penalty. Jury selection lasted approximately two months, and Raley's trial began in March 1987. During the trial, Raley presented evidence that he was not alone in providing unauthorized tours to young people, including boys, and that Grinsell might have survived had she been immediately treated for hypothermia. He was convicted on the counts of first-degree murder, attempted murder, and kidnapping with special circumstances on April 22, 1987, and a second trial would commence on May 5 to determine if he would receive the death penalty. The penalty phase trial jury deadlocked 7-5 in favor of the death penalty and a mistrial was declared on May 15, 1987. The penalty phase was retried starting on February 29, 1988, and Raley was sentenced to death on May 17. During the penalty phase retrial, the prosecution presented criminal incidents from Raley's juvenile record, which included lewd acts with children that occurred when he was a teenager. Raley's automatic appeal before the Supreme Court of California was largely denied in 1992. En banc, the Supreme Court of California upheld his conviction on almost all of the criminal charges and death sentence; the Court overturned the conviction for attempted oral copulation with Grinsell, ruling that charge was speculative and based on his actions with McKenna. A panel of judges from the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals unanimously upheld his death sentence in 2006; a request for a rehearing was rejected in November 2006. The Supreme Court of the United States rejected Raley's final appeal in 2007. In 2013, Raley's lawyers stated their client was autistic and asked that his sentence be commuted to life imprisonment without the possibility of parole, citing Atkins v. Virginia, a 2002 Supreme Court case that called execution of a mentally retarded criminal cruel and unusual punishment. Raley attempted to fire his lawyers for arguing that he was mentally retarded, and the commutation request was rejected in September 2013. In December 2006, U.S. District Judge Jeremy D. Fogel stayed all executions in California after his review of the lethal injection protocol and tour of the execution chamber in San Quentin determined the existing protocol was \\"deeply disturbing\\" and \\"broken\\", possibly violating the constitutional ban on cruel and unusual punishment. Over the next five years, state officials constructed a new chamber and overhauled the execution procedure; Fogel inspected the chamber again in 2011 to determine if California is ready to resume executions. Raley is one of at least six inmates on death row who had exhausted their appeals by 2011. The updated lethal injection method had not been reviewed when U.S. District Judge Cormac Carney ruled in 2014 that California's capital punishment law was unconstitutional because of the prolonged appeals process, effectively setting aside the death penalty indefinitely for Raley and more than a dozen other inmates on death row. In late 2017, the state Supreme Court upheld Proposition 66, which allowed prison officials to finalize the execution procedures, in turn allowing the federal courts to review the revised protocols; Raley would be one of 18 inmates to receive an execution date.
