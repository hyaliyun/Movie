Hager, Nancy C. Corbin. Designing & Delivering: Scientific, Technical, and Managerial Presentations, 1997, . 163. Concept maps may be used by instructional designers, engineers, technical writers, and others to organize and structure knowledge. A concept map typically represents ideas and information as boxes or circles, which it connects with labeled arrows, often in a downward-branching hierarchical structure. The relationship between concepts can be articulated in linking phrases such as \\"causes\\", \\"requires\\", \\"such as\\" or \\"contributes to\\".Joseph D. Novak & Alberto J. Ca√±as (2006). Theory Underlying Concept Maps and How To Construct and Use Them\\", Institute for Human and Machine Cognition. Accessed 24 Nov 2008. The technique for visualizing these relationships among different concepts is called concept mapping. Concept maps have been used to define the ontology of computer systems, for example with the object-role modeling or Unified Modeling Language formalism.  Overview  A concept map is a way of representing relationships between ideas, images, or words in the same way that a sentence diagram represents the grammar of a sentence, a road map represents the locations of highways and towns, and a circuit diagram represents the workings of an electrical appliance. In a concept map, each word or phrase connects to another, and links back to the original idea, word, or phrase. Concept maps are a way to develop logical thinking and study skills by revealing connections and helping students see how individual ideas form a larger whole. An example of the use of concept maps is provided in the context of learning about types of fuel.CONCEPT MAPPING FUELS . Accessed 24 Nov 2008. Concept maps were developed to enhance meaningful learning in the sciences. A well-made concept map grows within a context frame defined by an explicit \\"focus question\\", while a mind map often has only branches radiating out from a central picture. Some research evidence suggests that the brain stores knowledge as productions (situation-response conditionals) that act on declarative memory content, which is also referred to as chunks or propositions.Anderson, J. R., & Lebiere, C. (1998). The atomic components of thought. Mahwah, NJ: Erlbaum.Anderson, J. R., Byrne, M. D., Douglass, S., Lebiere, C., & Qin, Y. (2004). An Integrated Theory of the Mind. Psychological Review, 111(4), 1036-1050. Because concept maps are constructed to reflect organization of the declarative memory system, they facilitate sense-making and meaningful learning on the part of individuals who make concept maps and those who use them.  Differences from other visualizations  * Topic maps: Concept maps are rather similar to topic maps in that both allow to connect concepts or topics via graphs. Among the various schema and techniques for visualizing ideas, processes, and organizations, concept mapping, as developed by Joseph Novak is unique in its philosophical basis, which \\"makes concepts, and propositions composed of concepts, the central elements in the structure of knowledge and construction of meaning.\\"Novak, J.D. & Gowin, D.B. (1996). Learning How To Learn, Cambridge University Press: New York, p. 7. * Mind maps: Both concept maps and topic maps can be contrasted with mind mapping, which is often restricted to radial hierarchies and tree structures. Another contrast between concept mapping and mind mapping is the speed and spontaneity when a mind map is created. A mind map reflects what you think about a single topic, which can focus group brainstorming. A concept map can be a map, a system view, of a real (abstract) system or set of concepts. Concept maps are more free form, as multiple hubs and clusters can be created, unlike mind maps, which typically emerge from a single center.  History  Concept mapping was developed by Joseph D. Novak and his research team at Cornell University in the 1970s as a means of representing the emerging science knowledge of students. It has subsequently been used as a way to increase meaningful learning in the sciences and other subjects as well as to represent the expert knowledge of individuals and teams in education, government and business. Concept maps have their origin in the learning movement called constructivism. In particular, constructivists hold that learners actively construct knowledge. Novak's work is based on the cognitive theories of David Ausubel, who stressed the importance of prior knowledge in being able to learn (or assimilate) new concepts: \\"The most important single factor influencing learning is what the learner already knows. Ascertain this and teach accordingly.\\"Ausubel, D. (1968) Educational Psychology: A Cognitive View. Holt, Rinehart & Winston, New York. Novak taught students as young as six years old to make concept maps to represent their response to focus questions such as \\"What is water?\\" \\"What causes the seasons?\\" In his book Learning How to Learn, Novak states that a \\"meaningful learning involves the assimilation of new concepts and propositions into existing cognitive structures.\\" Various attempts have been made to conceptualize the process of creating concept maps. Ray McAleese, in a series of articles, has suggested that mapping is a process of off-loading. In this 1998 paper, McAleese draws on the work of SowaSowa, J.F., 1983. Conceptual structures: information processing in mind and machine, Addison-Wesley. and a paper by Sweller & Chandler.Sweller, J. & Chandler, P., 1991. Evidence for Cognitive Load Theory. Cognition and Instruction, 8(4), p.351-362. In essence, McAleese suggests that the process of making knowledge explicit, using nodes and relationships, allows the individual to become aware of what they know and as a result to be able to modify what they know.McAleese, R. (1998) The Knowledge Arena as an Extension to the Concept Map: Reflection in Action, Interactive Learning Environments, 6(3), p.251‚Äì272. Maria Birbili applies that same idea to helping young children learn to think about what they know.Birbili, M. (2006) \\"Mapping Knowledge: Concept Maps in Early Childhood Education\\" , Early Childhood Research & Practice, 8(2), Fall 2006 The concept of the knowledge arena is suggestive of a virtual space where learners may explore what they know and what they do not know. Use Example concept map created using the IHMC CmapTools computer program. Concept maps are used to stimulate the generation of ideas, and are believed to aid creativity. Concept mapping is also sometimes used for brain-storming. Although they are often personalized and idiosyncratic, concept maps can be used to communicate complex ideas. Formalized concept maps are used in software design, where a common usage is Unified Modeling Language diagramming amongst similar conventions and development methodologies. Concept mapping can also be seen as a first step in ontology-building, and can also be used flexibly to represent formal argument -- similar to argument maps. Concept maps are widely used in education and business. Uses include: *Note taking and summarizing gleaning key concepts, their relationships and hierarchy from documents and source materials *New knowledge creation: e.g., transforming tacit knowledge into an organizational resource, mapping team knowledge *Institutional knowledge preservation (retention), e.g., eliciting and mapping expert knowledge of employees prior to retirement *Collaborative knowledge modeling and the transfer of expert knowledge *Facilitating the creation of shared vision and shared understanding within a team or organization *Instructional design: concept maps used as Ausubelian \\"advance organizers\\" that provide an initial conceptual frame for subsequent information and learning. *Training: concept maps used as Ausubelian \\"advanced organizers\\" to represent the training context and its relationship to their jobs, to the organization's strategic objectives, to training goals. *Communicating complex ideas and arguments *Examining the symmetry of complex ideas and arguments and associated terminology *Detailing the entire structure of an idea, train of thought, or line of argument (with the specific goal of exposing faults, errors, or gaps in one's own reasoning) for the scrutiny of others. *Enhancing metacognition (learning to learn, and thinking about knowledge) *Improving language ability *Assessing learner understanding of learning objectives, concepts, and the relationship among those concepts *Lexicon development See also  List of concept- and mind-mapping software References  Further reading   External links  * Example of a concept map from 1957 by Walt Disney.

She made her debut with the New York Philharmonic at age 11 as a surprise guest soloist at the New Year's Eve Gala in 1982. In 1986 her performance at the Tanglewood Music Festival with Leonard Bernstein conducting his own composition made the front-page headlines in The New York Times. Midori became a celebrated child prodigy, and one of the world's preeminent violinists as an adult. Midori has been honored as an educator and for her community engagement endeavors. When she was 21, she established her foundation Midori and Friends to bring music education to young people in underserved communities in New York City and Japan, which has evolved into four distinct organizations with worldwide impact. In 2007, Midori was appointed as a UN Messenger of Peace. In 2018 she joined the violin faculty at the Curtis Institute while remaining on the USC Thornton School Of Music Violin faculty holding the Judge Widney Professor of Music Chair. She was elected to the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 2012. Early life Midori was born Midori Goto in Osaka, Japan on October 25, 1971. She dropped her father's surname from her stage name after her parent's divorce in 1983, initially performing under the name Mi Dori, then deciding on the single word Midori. Her father was a successful engineer and her mother, Setsu Got≈ç, was a professional violinist. Setsu regularly took young Midori to her orchestra rehearsals where the toddler slept in the front row of the auditorium while her mother rehearsed. One day Setsu heard a two-year-old Midori humming a Bach concerto that had been rehearsed two days earlier. Subsequently, Midori often tried to touch her mother's violin, even climbing onto the bench of the family piano to try to reach the violin on top of the piano. On Midori's third birthday, Setsu gave her a 1/16 size violin and began giving her lessons. Career Midori gave her first public performance at the age of six, playing one of the 24 Caprices of Paganini in her native Osaka. In 1982 she and her mother moved to New York City, where Midori started violin studies with Dorothy DeLay at Pre-College Division of Juilliard School and the Aspen Music Festival and School. As her audition piece, Midori performed Bach's thirteen-minute-long Chaconne, generally considered one of the most difficult solo violin pieces. In the same year, she made her concert debut with the New York Philharmonic under Zubin Mehta, a conductor with whom she would later record on the Sony Classical label. In 1986 came her legendary performance of Leonard Bernstein's Serenade at Tanglewood, conducted by Bernstein. During the performance, she broke the E string on her violin, then again on the concertmaster's Stradivarius after she borrowed it. She finished the performance with the associate concertmaster's Guadagnini and received a standing ovation. The next day's The New York Times front page carried the headline, \\"Girl, 14, Conquers Tanglewood with 3 Violins\\". When Midori was 15, she left Juilliard Pre-College in 1987 after four years and became a full-time professional violinist. In October 1989, she celebrated her 18th birthday with her Carnegie Hall orchestral debut, playing Bartok's Violin Concerto No. 2. She made her Carnegie Hall recital debut in 1990 four days before her 19th birthday. Both performances were critically acclaimed. In 1990, she also graduated from the Professional Children's School which she attended for academic subjects. In 1992, she formed Midori and Friends, a non-profit organization that aims to bring music education to children in New York City and in Japan after learning of severe cutbacks to music education in U.S. schools. Her organization Music Sharing began as the Tokyo branch-office of Midori and Friends and was certified as an independent organization in 2002. Music Sharing focuses on education about Western classical music and traditional Japanese music for young people, including instrument instruction for the disabled. Its International Community Engagement Program is a training program for internationally chosen aspiring musicians that promotes cultural exchange and community engagement. In 2000, Midori graduated magna cum laude from the Gallatin School at New York University with a bachelor's degree in Psychology and Gender Studies, completing the degree in five years while also continuing to perform in concerts. She later earned a master's degree in psychology from NYU in 2005. Her master's thesis was about pain research. In 2001, Midori had returned to the stage and took a teaching position at the Manhattan School of Music. In 2001, with the money Midori received from winning the Avery Fisher Prize, she established the Partners in Performance program focusing on classical music organizations in smaller communities. In 2004, Midori launched the Orchestra Residencies program in the U.S. for youth orchestras, which was expanded to include collaborations with orchestras outside the U.S. in 2010. In 2004, Midori was named a professor at University of Southern California's Thornton School of Music where she is holder of the Jascha Heifetz Chair. She became a full-time resident of Los Angeles in 2006 after a period of bicoastal commuting and was promoted to the chair of the Strings Department in 2007. In 2012 she was named distinguished professor at USC, elected to the American Academy of Arts & Sciences, and was awarded an honorary doctorate in music by Yale University. Midori was Humanitas Visiting Professor in Classical Music and Music Education at Oxford University 2013‚Äì2014. Midori will join the violin faculty of Philadelphia's Curtis Institute in the 2018‚Äì2019 academic year while remaining on the University of Southern California Thornton School of Music's violin faculty as a Judge Widney Professor of Music.https://music.usc.edu/midori-goto/ Accolades In addition to being named Artist of the Year by the Japanese government (1988) and the recipient of the 25th Suntory Music Award (1993), Midori has won the Avery Fisher Prize (2001), Musical America‚Äôs Instrumentalist of the Year award (2002), the Deutscher Schallplattenpreis (2002, 2003), the Kennedy Center Gold Medal in the Arts (2010), the Mellon Mentoring Award (2012). In 2007 Midori was named a United Nations Messenger of Peace. In 2012, she received the prestigious Crystal Award by the World Economic Forum in Davos for \\"20-year devotion to community engagement work worldwide\\". Personal life In September 1994, Midori suddenly cancelled her concerts and withdrew from public view. She was hospitalised and given an official diagnosis of anorexia for the first time. In her twenties, Midori struggled with anorexia and depression, resulting in a number of hospital stays. She later wrote about these personal difficulties in her 2004 memoir Einfach Midori (Simply Midori), which has been published in German but not English. (It was updated and reissued in German-speaking countries in 2012.) After recovering, she continued to perform and also studied psychology and gender studies at New York University. For a while, she considered psychology as an alternative career, with a focus on working with children. Midori's half-brother Ryu and her stepfather Makoto Kaneshiro (a former violin assistant of Ryu's father, DeLay) are both violinists. Instrument Midori plays on the 1734 Guarneri \\"ex-Huberman\\" violin. Her bows are made by Dominique Peccatte (two) and Fran√ßois Peccatte (one).

It is the mid-range machine of the first generation of Power Macintosh line, between the Power Macintosh 6100 and the 8100. The 7100 re-used the Macintosh IIvx case with few changes. There were two versions of the 7100; the original version and an version that replaced it in January 1995. The 7100 was succeeded in August 1995 by two new models, the Power Macintosh 7200 and the Power Macintosh 7500, though sales of the 7100 continued into early 1996. Models The 7100AV variants include a 2 MB VRAM card with S-Video in/out. The non-AV 7100s have a video card containing 1 MB VRAM which was expandable to 2MB, and no S-Video in/out capability.

Though the project name was internal, it was revealed to the public in a 1993 issue of MacWeek. Sagan, worried that the public might interpret this as an endorsement which sullied his name, reportedly contacted Apple and threatened to sue unless they could prove the codename did not officially link to his intellectual property and identity. After they reportedly refused, he wrote a letter to the editor that appeared in a 1994 issue of MacWeek, seeking to inform their readers of the situation. Following the letter, a rogue programmer at Apple renamed the project to \\"BHA (for Butt- Head Astronomer). Sagan then sued Apple for libel over the new name, but since the codename was internal he lost his case. Sagan continued pursuing lawsuits. When he sued Apple again, this time for the original use of his name, he lost this suit as well. Sagan and Apple, apparently not wishing to engage in a series of lawsuits over the issue, came to an out-of-court agreement in November 1995, leading to Apple making a statement of apology.

Its headquarters are in Paris. According to Jacques Schram, chairman of the Executive Committee, the membership totalled 881 in 2003.Jacques Schram in the interview SAT plu estas avangarda . in: La Ondo de Esperanto 5, 2003 In 2006 SAT had 724 members.as indicated by General Secretary Kre≈°imir Barkoviƒá in an internal circular of July 18, 2007 SAT uses Esperanto as its working language and aims through the use of Esperanto to enable progressive individuals, organizations and workers of all countries to exchange ideas and meet on the basis of equality across national barriers. Members of SAT are involved in socialist, peace, trade union, anti-nationalist, feminist and environmental activities, among others. History SAT was founded in 1921 by Eug√®ne Lanti (pseudonym of Eug√®ne Adam) and others as an organisation of the workers' Esperanto movement. It was largest and most active between the two World Wars. At its high point in 1929-1930 it had 6524 members in 1674 communities in 42 countries. It suffered heavy attrition soon after, however, when \\"cosmopolitan\\" activities, a category into which Esperanto fell, began to be persecuted in the Soviet Union after the onset of Stalinism, and after the ban on the workers' Esperanto movement in Germany that took effect immediately after the Nazi takeover in 1933. The Soviet Union and Germany had been the countries, in which SAT had the greatest number of members. Ideologically motivated internal schisms, involving at various times anarchists, communists and social democrats, also took a toll. Aims The following declaration of aims became part of the Statute at the foundation of SAT in 1921, and remains valid to this day: \\"a) to utilise the international language Esperanto for the class aims of the worldwide working class; b) to promote mutual relations among members in the best and most worthy way possible, in order to instill in them a strong sense of human solidarity; c) to instruct, educate and enlighten the members in such a way as to make them the most capable and best of the so- called internationalists; d) to serve as an intermediary in relations among organisations using other languages but having aims analogous to those of SAT; e) to be an intermediary and supporter in the creation of an Esperanto literature consisting both of translations and original texts, and which reflects the ideal of our association.\\" In 1928 it was further clarified in the following addendum: \\"SAT, an educational and cultural organisation rather than an overtly political one, tries to induce its members to be understanding and tolerant of the political and philosophical schools or systems that lie at the base of the various workers' parties that are oriented toward class struggle and of trade-union movements; it seeks, by means of comparison of facts and ideas and by means of free discussion, to enable its members to avoid the dogmatisation of the teachings they encounter in their particular milieus. In short, SAT constantly applies a rationally elaborated language on a worldwide scale in order to aid in the creation of intellects that think rationally and are able to compare accurately, understand correctly and assess ideas, theses and tendencies in such a way as to render them capable of electing independently the path they believe most direct or most expedient to the end of liberating their class and guiding the human race towards a level of civilisation and culture that is as advanced as possible.\\" SAT does not exist primarily to promote Esperanto ‚Äì although it has a department that engages in such activity ‚Äì but one that puts Esperanto to use for its own purposes. Esperanto is promoted by separate regional organisations that are linked to SAT by contract. Most of these organisations are not national in scope, but encompass the territory of a particular language. The largest such organisation is SAT-Amikaro, which encompasses all French-speaking territories. Structure SAT has a national structure, i.e. one that deliberately avoids taking national differences into account. Its members join individually, not through the intermediary of a national section. The Universal Esperanto Association was structured in the same way when it was founded at the beginning of the 20th century by Hector Hodler. As for SAT, it was laid out by Eug√®ne Lanti in a series of articles that appeared prior to the foundation of the Association in 1921. The decision-making structure of SAT is, in theory, close to the organisational base, to the extent that all congress decisions should become valid only after a referendum. This statutory provision is intended to foment grass-roots democracy. In practice, many congress decisions are never submitted to a referendum. The association is governed by an eight-member Executive Committee. The editor of Sennaciulo (see \\"Activity\\") and long-standing General Secretary is Kre≈°imir Barkoviƒá. Jacques Schram has been the chairman of the Executive Committee since March, 2003. Activity SAT publishes a monthly magazine, Sennaciulo [\\"Nationless One\\"], an annual cultural review, Sennacieca Revuo, and a variety of books, some of them of an educational nature, such as the Plena Ilustrita Vortaro, the most comprehensive Esperanto dictionary, as well as socially engaged literary works. It has recently begun to publish educational and political matter on the Internet.Website of the publishing cooperative It organises an annual international congress, which deals with both the affairs of the association and matters of general political concern.

In the 21st century, publications in English of Radetzky March and of collections of his journalism from Berlin and Paris created a revival of interest in Roth.Author biography in Radetzky March, Penguin Modern Classics, 1984. Habsburg empire Student identity card photo of Joseph Roth (ca. 1914) Born into a Jewish family, Roth was born and grew up in Brody, a small town near Lemberg (now Lviv) in East Galicia, in the easternmost reaches of what was then the Austro-Hungarian empire. Jewish culture played an important role in the life of the town, which had a large Jewish population. Roth grew up with his mother and her relatives; he never saw his father, who had disappeared before he was born.Hofmann, Michael. \\"About the author\\", The Wandering Jews, Granta Books, p.141. After secondary school, Joseph Roth moved to Lemberg to begin his university studies in 1913, before transferring to the University of Vienna in 1914 to study philosophy and German literature. In 1916, Roth broke off his university studies and volunteered to serve in the Imperial Habsburg army fighting on the Eastern Front, \\"though possibly only as an army journalist or censor.\\" This experience had a major and long-lasting influence on his life. So, too, did the collapse in 1918 of the Habsburg Empire, which marked the beginning of a pronounced sense of \\"homelessness\\" that was to feature regularly in his work. As he wrote: \\"My strongest experience was the War and the destruction of my fatherland, the only one I ever had, the Dual Monarchy of Austria-Hungary.\\"As quoted in: Lazaroms, Ilse Josepha (2014-10-08), \\"Roth, Joseph,\\" 1914-1918-online/International Encyclopedia of the First World War. Issued by Freie Universit√§t Berlin. . The quotation is from a letter to Otto Forst- Battaglia, dated 28 October 1932. Germany In 1918, Roth returned to Vienna and began writing for left-wing newspapers, signing articles published by Vorw√§rts as Der rote Joseph (The red Joseph, a play on his surname, which is homophonous with German rot, \\"red\\", which is also the signalling color of leftwing parties in Europe). In 1920 he moved to Berlin, where he worked as a successful journalist for the Neue Berliner Zeitung and, from 1921, for the Berliner B√∂rsen-Courier. In 1923 he began his association with the liberal Frankfurter Zeitung, traveling widely throughout Europe, and reporting from the South of France, the USSR, Albania, Poland, Italy, and Germany. According to his main English translator, Michael Hofmann, \\"He was one of the most distinguished and best-paid journalists of the period, being paid at the dream rate of one Deutschmark per line.\\"Hofmann, Michael. \\"About the Author\\", The Wandering Jews, Granta Books, p.142. In 1925 he spent a period working in France. He never again resided permanently in Berlin. Marriage and family  Joseph Roth (right) with Friedl (centre) and an unknown person on horseback Roth married Friederike (Friedl) Reichler in 1922. In the late 1920s, his wife became schizophrenic, which threw Roth into a deep crisis, both emotionally and financially. She lived for years in a sanatorium and was later murdered in the Action T4 programme. In 1929 he met Andrea Manga Bell who was to share his destiny for the next six years. Andrea Manga Bell was born in Hamburg and unhappily married to Alexandre Douala Manga Bell, Prince of Douala in Cameroon. Her husband had returned to Cameroon while she and their children stayed in Europe. When Roth met her, she was editor of the Ullstein magazine Gebrauchsgraphik.Robbie Aitken, Eve Rosenhaft: Black Germany: The Making and Unmaking of a Diaspora Community, 1884‚Äì1960. Cambridge 2013, p. 114f. , 9781107435643 Novels In 1923, Roth's first (unfinished) novel, The Spider's Web, was serialized in an Austrian newspaper. He went on to achieve moderate success as a novelist with a series of books exploring life in post- war Europe, but only upon publication of Job and Radetzky March did he achieve acclaim for his fiction rather than his journalism. From 1930, Roth's fiction became less concerned with contemporary society, with which he had become increasingly disillusioned, and began to evoke a melancholic nostalgia for life in imperial Central Europe before 1914. He often portrayed the fate of homeless wanderers looking for a place to live, in particular Jews and former citizens of the old Austria-Hungary, who, with the downfall of the monarchy, had lost their only possible Heimat (\\"true home\\"). In his later works, Roth appeared to wish that the monarchy could be restored. His longing for a more tolerant past may be partly explained as a reaction against the political extremism of the time, which culminated in Germany with National Socialism. The novel Radetzky March (1932) and the story \\"The Bust of the Emperor\\" (1935) are typical of this late phase. In another novel, The Emperor's Tomb (1938), Roth describes the fate of a cousin of the hero of Radetzky March up to Germany's annexation of Austria in 1938. Of his works dealing with Judaism, the novel Job is perhaps the best-known. Paris The grave of Joseph Roth at the Cimeti√®re de Thiais Being a prominent liberal Jewish journalist, Roth left Germany when Adolf Hitler became Reich Chancellor on 30 January 1933. Andrea Manga Bell accompanied him with her children. He spent most of the next six years in Paris, a city he loved. His essays written in France display a delight in the city and its culture. Shortly after Hitler's rise to power, in February 1933, Roth wrote in a prophetic letter to his friend, the Austrian writer Stefan Zweig: The relationship with Andrea Manga Bell failed due to financial problems and Roth's jealousy. From 1936 to 1938, Roth had a romantic relationship with Irmgard Keun. They worked together, traveling to various cities such as Paris, Wilna, Lemberg, Warsaw, Vienna, Salzburg, Brussels and Amsterdam. Without intending to deny his Jewish origins, Roth considered his relationship to Catholicism very important. In the final years of his life, he may even have converted: Michael Hofmann states in the preface to the collection of essays The White Cities (also published as Report from a Parisian Paradise) that Roth \\"was said to have had two funerals, one Jewish, one Catholic.\\" Roth's last years were difficult. He moved from hotel to hotel, drinking heavily, and becoming increasingly anxious about money and the future. Despite suffering from chronic alcoholism, he remained prolific until his premature death in Paris in 1939. His novella The Legend of the Holy Drinker (1939) chronicles the attempts made by an alcoholic vagrant to regain his dignity and honor a debt. Roth's final collapse was precipitated by hearing the news that the playwright Ernst Toller had hanged himself in New York. Roth is interred in the Cimeti√®re de Thiais, south of Paris.

Lanti was an Esperantist, socialist and writer. He was a founder of Sennacieca Asocio Tutmonda, and a longtime editor of the internationalist socialist magazine Sennaciulo. Lanti was a critic of Stalinism and the theoretician of a new doctrine, anationalism, which aimed to eliminate the very concept of the nation as a guiding idea of social organisation.  Biography  Lanti's parents were peasant farmers. In his early life he worked as an agricultural labourer, carpenter, furniture maker and designer. He was self-educated, and studied in the evening. In 1914 he was mobilised in the First World War and served as an ambulance driver. He learnt Esperanto in 1914‚Äì15 at the Western Front, but in 1919 was almost persuaded to abandon Esperanto in favour of Ido. Following the war, he returned to Paris, became acquainted with Lucian Banmer and Ludoviko Glodeau, and he reaffirmed his support for Esperanto with his editorship of Liberiga Stelo. In the 1920s Lanti lived in Paris with Ellen Kate Limouzin, the aunt of George Orwell. Orwell visited the couple and suffered as a non-speaker of Esperanto, and developed a strong dislike for the language. It has been suggested that Orwell included elements of Esperanto in the \\"Newspeak\\" language he created in his anti-totalitarian novel, Nineteen Eighty-Four.  Lanti's political career  In his youth Lanti had been attracted to anarchism, but in 1920 he finally abandoned anarchism and became a founding member of the French Communist Party. In 1921 in Prague he was the initiator and de facto leader of Sennacieca Asocio Tutmonda (SAT), a broad-based Esperanto-speaking organisation (containing Communists, Social Democrats and anarchists) which does not organise along national lines. In 1933 Lanti, wounded by personal attacks and criticisms of his leadership, left his position of president of the Central Committee of SAT, a position he had occupied since the foundation of the organization. He continued, however, to play a role in the organisation chiefly as a writer. In 1935 Lanti founded the independent magazine Herezulo in which he criticised the Soviet regime more forcefully than in Sennaciulo.  Lanti as lexicographer  Lanti was self-taught both in his use of literary French and Esperanto. He worked with Petit Larousse, and sought to create an Esperanto dictionary of the same type. He was centrally involved in the project run by SAT for the writing and design of the Plena Vortaro which later became today's Plena Ilustrita Vortaro. Later years After his retirement in 1937, to meet Esperantists, Lanti left France for good and travelled to Spain, Portugal, North Africa, Japan, Australia, New Zealand and South America. Suffering from an incurable illness, he hanged himself in his flat in Mexico on 17 January 1947.  See also  * Anationalism  External links  * Manifesto of Non-Nationalists (excerpts) by E.

Definition and history The first printed use of the term \\"underground film\\" occurs in a 1957 essay by American film critic Manny Farber, \\"Underground Films.\\" Farber uses it to refer to the work of directors who \\"played an anti-art role in Hollywood.\\" He contrasts \\"such soldier-cowboy-gangster directors as Raoul Walsh, Howard Hawks, William Wellman,\\" and others with the \\"less talented De Sicas and Zinnemanns [who] continue to fascinate the critics.\\"Manny Farber, \\"Underground Films\\" (1957), in Negative Space: Manny Farber on the Movies (New York: Da Capo, 1998), 12‚Äì24; 12. However, as in \\"Underground Press\\", the term developed as a metaphorical reference to a clandestine and subversive culture beneath the legitimate and official media. In the late 1950s, \\"underground film\\" began to be used to describe early independent film makers operating first in San Francisco, California and New York City, New York, and soon in other cities around the world as well, including the London Film-Makers' Co-op in Britain and Ubu Films in Sydney, Australia. The movement was typified by more experimental filmmakers working at the time like Shirley Clarke,Underground Film: A Critical HistoryUnderground Film Journal Stan Brakhage, Harry Everett Smith, Maya Deren, Andy Warhol,The Black Hole Of The Camera: The Films Of Andy WarholUnderground Film Journal Kenneth Anger,\\"Kenneth Anger: Magician of Underground Cinema\\" 23 September 2014 The Third Eye Jonas Mekas, Ken Jacobs, Ron Rice, Jack Smith, George and Mike Kuchar, and Bruce Conner. By the late 1960s, the movement represented by these filmmakers had matured, and some began to distance themselves from the countercultural, psychedelic connotations of the word, preferring terms like avant-garde or experimental to describe their work. Through 1970s and 1980s, however, \\"underground film\\" would still be used to refer to the more countercultural fringe of independent cinema. The term was embraced most emphatically by Nick Zedd and the other filmmakers associated with the New York-based Cinema of Transgression and No Wave Cinema of the late 1970s to early 1990s. Latter-day cinema In the early 1990s, the legacy of the Cinema of Transgression carried over into a new generation, who would equate \\"underground cinema\\" with transgressive art, ultra-low-budget filmmaking created in defiance of both the commercialized versions of independent film offered by newly wealthy distributors like Miramax and New Line, as well as the institutionalized experimental film canonized at major museums. This spirit defined the early years of underground film festivals (like the New York Underground Film Festival, Chicago Underground Film Festival, Boston Underground Film Festival, Sydney Underground Film Festival,Sydney Underground Film Festival Hamilton Underground Film Festival, Toronto's Images Festival, and others), zines like Film Threat, as well as the works of filmmakers like Craig Baldwin, Jon Moritsugu, Carlos Atanes, Sarah Jacobson, and Bruce La Bruce. In London the Underground resurgence emerged as a movement of Underground cinema clubs which included the radical open access group the Exploding Cinema. By the late 1990s and early 2000s, the term had become blurred again, as the work at underground festivals began to blend with more formal experimentation, and the divisions that had been stark ones less than a decade earlier now seemed much less so. If the term is used at all, it connotes a form of very low budget independent filmmaking, with perhaps transgressive content, or a lo-fi analog to post-punk music and cultures. A recent development in underground filmmaking can be observed through the Lower East Side based film production company ASS Studios. Founded in 2011 by writer Reverend Jen and filmmaker Courtney Fathom Sell, the group avoided most modern methods of production, choosing to shoot all of their work on an outdated Hi 8 format and usually with no-budget. Utilizing many New York based performers, their work generally contained camp elements and taboo themes. These films were commonly screened at venues & bars in and around New York City. Underground versus cult The term \\"underground film\\" is occasionally used as a synonym for cult film (as in the case of films like Eating Raoul).10 Odd and Obscure Cult Movies Worth Seeking Out - Taste of Cinema Though there are important distinctions between the two, a significant overlap between these categories is undeniable.

She was active during the final years of the Sangkum Reastr Niyum period and into the Khmer Republic period. She sang in a variety of genres; romantic ballads emerged as her most popular works. Despite a relatively brief career she is credited with singing hundreds of songs. She also ventured into acting, starring in a few films. Details of her life are relatively scarce. She disappeared during the Khmer Rouge regime of the late 1970s but the circumstances of her fate remain a mystery. Norodom Sihanouk granted Sothea the honorary title \\"Queen with the Golden Voice.\\" Biography Early life Ros Sothea was born in circa 1948 to Ros Bun () and Nath Samien () in Battambang Province. Growing up relatively poor on a farm, Ros Sothea was the second youngest of five children; her older sister Ros Saboeut later became known as an activist. She displayed vocal talent as a toddler and grew up listening to early Cambodian pop singers like Mao Sareth and Chhoun Malay. Sothea's talent would remain relatively hidden until friends persuaded her to join a regional singing contest in 1963. After winning the contest she became widely known in her home province and was invited to join a musical troupe that regularly performed at Stung Khiev restaurant in Battambang; she also performed in a family band with her brother Serey. It is believed that Im Song Seurm, a singer from the National Radio service, heard of Sothea's talents and invited her to Phnom Penh in 1967. Music career In Phnom Penh, she adopted the alias Ros Serey Sothea and became a singer for the National Radio service, first performing duets with Im Song Seurm. Her first hit, \\"Stung Khieu (Blue River)\\" appeared in 1967 and she quickly became popular across Cambodia, particularly for her high and clear voice. Eventually she became a regular partner with Sinn Sisamouth, the era's leading singer, resulting in many popular duet recordings. She also collaborated with other prominent singers of the era like Pen Ran, Huoy Meas, and Sos Mat, while maintaining an active solo career as well. Sothea's early recordings were largely traditional Cambodian ballads. She would eventually adopt a more contemporary style incorporating French and American influences, adding western pop/rock instrumentation, as was common in Cambodian music starting in the late 1960s. Eventually Sothea and her contemporaries were strongly influenced by American radio that had been transmitted to U.S. troops in nearby South Vietnam, inspiring experimentation with American/British rock and soul sounds.> Sothea combined her high and clear voice with backing provided by young rock musicians, characterized by prominent electric guitars, drums, and Farfisa organs. This resulted in a sound that is often described as psychedelic or garage rock, and Sothea became the leading female singer in the thriving Cambodian rock scene. Sothea was also one of many singers in that scene to create new versions of popular western rock songs with Khmer lyrics, such as \\"Cry Loving Me\\" (based on \\"Proud Mary\\" by Creedence Clearwater Revival) and \\"Wolly Polly\\" (based on \\"Wooly Bully\\" by Sam the Sham). Romantic ballads would remain her most endearing work amongst the more conservative populace. She was often sought out by film directors to perform songs in their movies. Sothea's collaboration with the Cambodian film industry is invaluable in identifying over 250 films lost during the Khmer Rouge regime. Sothea never sang under any one record label and made a modest living as a musician. She was recognized as a national treasure and was honored by Head of State Norodom Sihanouk with the royal title of Preah Reich Theany Somlang Meas, the \\"Queen with the Golden Voice\\" (sometimes translated as \\"Golden Voice of the Royal Capital\\"). During the Cambodian Civil War in the early 1970s, Sothea became involved in the Khmer Republic military and recorded patriotic songs supporting the Republic's stance against the Khmer Rouge insurgents. Her career would continue until the Khmer Rouge captured Phnom Penh in April 1975. Personal life Little information about Ros Serey Sothea's personal life has survived, though her personality has been described as modest and reserved. She is known to have been involved in a few high-profile relationships. As documented in the film Don't Think I've Forgotten, when she arrived in Phnom Penh she was courted by fellow singer Sos Mat and they eventually married. As Sothea's career moved forward, Sos Mat became jealous of her success and of the men who came to watch her perform, culminating in physical abuse. Sothea fled the marriage within six months and obtained a divorce. Believing that her career would be ruined by the stigma of divorce, Sothea went back to her family in Battambang but was convinced by Sinn Sisamouth to return to Phnom Penh and resume her career. Sothea's popularity rebounded and she met a prominent member of a film-making family while recording film songs. This relationship led to marriage and the birth of a son, but for undocumented reasons the marriage was short-lived. The film Don't Think I've Forgotten also reports that Sothea had a relationship with an officer in the Khmer Republic army and learned to be a paratrooper during the Cambodian Civil War, though her boyfriend is believed to have been killed in combat. This relationship increased her participation with the military; a film of Sothea parachuting out of a plane during a paratrooper exercise is the only known video footage of her to have survived. Fans believe that Sothea's unhappy relationships were a primary influence on her singing style and lyrics, indicated by song titles (in translation) like \\"Don't Be Mad,\\" \\"Brokenhearted Woman,\\" and \\"Wicked Husband.\\" Disappearance and death Ros Serey Sothea disappeared during the Khmer Rouge genocide and her exact fate has never been confirmed, with multiple sources making contradictory claims. For example, her sisters have alleged that Sothea is likely to have died immediately after the Khmer Rouge seized control of Cambodia in April 1975; as a famous entertainer with \\"western\\" influences, qualities widely known to be disdained by the Khmer Rouge, she would have been targeted for imprisonment or execution immediately. Her whereabouts at the time are also uncertain, with some sources claiming that she had traveled to Pailin Province for the 1975 Buddhist New Year, as the lyrics of her final recordings are on that topic, though others are skeptical of this claim because of the dangers of traveling in Cambodia during that period. She may have also been in Phnom Penh at the time and was forced to evacuate like all other residents, and some sources also claim that the outgoing government made efforts to get her out of the country. Further sources claim that Sothea, like most city dwellers, was relocated to the Cambodian countryside for farm work; having grown up on a farm she was able to adjust to the work and hide her identity for a time. According to this story, she was eventually discovered, after which she was forced by Pol Pot to marry one of his officers and perform regularly for the party leadership. This story contends that her marriage to the officer was abusive and the party leadership determined that her presence was too controversial, so she was allegedly led away and executed in 1977. Yet more sources claim that Sothea died from overwork in a Khmer Rouge agricultural camp, or that she survived until the Vietnamese invasion of late 1978/early 1979 but soon died in a hospital from malnutrition. Whatever the cause, Sothea almost certainly died during the Khmer Rouge regime but her remains have never been discovered. Legacy A Ros Serey Sothea record cover from the early 1970s Many of Ros Serey Sothea's master recordings were either destroyed by the Khmer Rouge regime in its efforts to eliminate foreign influences from Cambodian society, or deteriorated rapidly in the tropical environment. However, many vinyl records have survived and have been reissued on cassette or compact disc. Collectors believe that some of the reissued songs were remixed by unknown persons at a later date, usually with the addition of stronger drum beats. Thus, the original master recordings by Sothea and her contemporaries are highly sought by collectors and preservationists. Sothea's older sister Ros Saboeut is widely credited with reuniting Cambodia's surviving musicians and bands in the aftermath of the Khmer Rouge era. Surviving musicians had initially contacted Ros Saboeut to inquire about Sothea's fate; Saboeut used the opportunity to reunite the survivors. According to Youk Chhang, the executive director of the Documentation Center of Cambodia, Ros Saboeut sought to restore Cambodian music as a tribute to her sister, saying \\"I think she was bound by the legacy of her sister to help.\\" Her efforts were widely credited with rebuilding the country's rock genre. Ros Serey Sothea has remained extremely popular posthumously in Cambodia and Cambodian communities scattered throughout the United States, France, Australia, and Canada. Western listeners were introduced to her work starting in the late 1990s with the release of the Cambodian Rocks bootleg album, followed by the soundtrack to the film City of Ghosts. The Los Angeles band Dengue Fever, featuring Cambodian lead singer Chhom Nimol, covers a number of songs by Sothea and her contemporaries in the Cambodian rock scene, as does the band Cambodian Space Project. Sothea was the subject of the 2006 short film The Golden Voice, in which she is played by actress Sophea Pel. Ros Serey Sothea is also profiled extensively in the 2015 documentary film Don't Think I've Forgotten, in which several interview subjects describe her as one of the most important singers in the history of Cambodian popular music.

Biography Skyfire was formed in the town of H√∂√∂r, Sweden in 1995 by Andreas Edlund (guitar), Martin Hanner (bass guitar), Jonas Sj√∂gren (guitar) and Tobias Bj√∂rk (drums). The four were friends since high school and had similar tastes in music. The band recorded two demos: Within Reach and The Final Story. On the second demo, the vocals were performed by Henrik Wenngren. Skyfire got in touch with band members of Thyrfing who helped them find a record label with Dutch label Hammerheart Records. During two weeks in August 2000, Skyfire recorded their debut album Timeless Departure in the Abyss Studio. In September 2002, the band recorded their second album Mind Revolution, again in the Abyss Studio with new drummer Joakim Jonsson. Mind Revolution was released in 2003 and showed the band's style evolving and branching off into different musical genres. The third album Spectral was recorded at Los Angered and Studio Underground and released on May 10, 2004, by Arise Records. The vocalist Henrik Wenngren left the band and was replaced by Joakim Karlsson. On January 7, 2008, Skyfire announced on their official MySpace page that they had signed with a Florida-based label, Pivotal Rockordings, for a three-album deal, and the band entered the recording studio to begin recording their fourth untitled album. Mixing was done by Scar Symmetry's Jonas Kjellgren at Black Lounge Studios. On May 15, 2009, Skyfire announced a digital only EP entitled Fractal for a July 2009 release. The EP is a collection of B-sides recorded between 2004's Spectral and Esoteric. Fractal was released July 6 for digital download. Skyfire's fourth album is titled Esoteric, and it was released on September 14, 2009 in the United Kingdom via Pivotal Rockordings. The album was released on September 18, 2009 in the rest of Europe, and in North America on October 13, 2009, due to a scheduling issue. The cover art was created by P√§r Olofsson, who also made covers for Brain Drill, Psycroptic, Spawn of Possession, Persuader and others. On July 4, 2017, the band launched a PledgeMusic campaign to fund their newest EP \\"Liberation in Death.\\" The campaign was successful, raising the full amount needed in under eight hours.

A coin with BARSCUNES in Iberian script. It has been proposed that the word is related to Vascones. Coins of Arsaos, Navarre, 150-100 BC, showing Roman stylistic influence. British Museum. The Vascones were a pre-Roman tribe who, on the arrival of the Romans in the 1st century, inhabited a territory that spanned between the upper course of the Ebro river and the southern basin of the western Pyrenees, a region that coincides with present-day Navarre, western Aragon and northeastern La Rioja, in the Iberian Peninsula.Classical authors, such as Livy, name cities as Calagurris, Cascantum and Graccurris as Vascon cities. The Vascones are often considered ancestors of the present-day Basques to whom they left their name.

Although these texts have been studied(Schulten 1927), (Bl√°zquez 1966),(Canto 1997),(G√≥mez Fraile 2001). as sources of reference, some authors have pointed out the apparent lack of uniformity and also the existence of contradictions within the texts, in particular with Strabo.(Arce,1999),(G√≥mez Fraile 2001:28). The oldest document(Schulten 1927:226),(Bl√°zquez 1966:2). corresponds to Livy (59 BC - AD 17), who in a brief passage of his work about the 76 BC Sertorian War relates how after crossing the Ebro and the city of Calagurris Nasica, they crossed the flatlands of the Vascones, or Vasconum agrum until reaching the border of their immediate neighbors, the Berones....dimissis eis ipse profectus per Vasconum agrum ducto exercitu in confinio Beronum posuit castra,...

Histoire Romaine XXXIII. Livre XLV et Fragments. Paris, 1990 (1979), page 214-218 Comparing other sections of this same document, it is deduced that this border was located to the west, while the southern neighbors of the Vascones were the Celtiberians, with their city, Contrebia Leucade.(Bl√°zquez 1966:3) Pliny the Elder, on his work Natural History, mentioned a text prior to 50 BC that located the Vascones at the western end of the Pyrenees, neighbors of the Varduli and extended to the mountains of Oiarso and into the coasts of the Bay of Biscay, in an area he called Vasconum saltus.Natural History, 4,110-111: Proxima ora citerioris est eiusdemque Tarraconensis situus a Pyrenaeo per oceanum Vasconum saltus, Oiarso, Vardulorum oppida, Morogi, Menosca, Vesperies, Amanum portus, ubi nunc Flauiobrica colonia 8.

This information is found again in the works of Ptolemy, who lived during the 1st and 2nd Century AD. In his book, Ge≈çgraphik·∏ï Hyph·∏ógƒìsis, chapter 6, he relates the names of 15 cities inside the territory of the Vascones, besides Oiarso:(Schulten 1927: 230-232)(Canto 1997) Iturissa, Pompaelo, Bituris, Andelos, Nemanturissa, Curnonium, Iacca, Graccurris, Calagurris, Cascantum, Ercavica, Tarraga, Muscaria, Seguia and Alavona. The territory of the Vascones during the Roman republic and Roman empire corresponded with present-day Navarre, the northeast extreme of Gipuzkoa, and parts of La Rioja, Zaragoza and Huesca,(Bl√°zquez 1966:11) including the city of Calagurris.(G√≥mez Fraile 2001:58)  3rd and 4th centuries  = Late Basquisation = During this period, after the time of Ptolemy and contemporary to the times of instability caused by the Germanic invasions, the documents about the Vascones and other tribes of the northern Iberian Peninsula are scarce, and as a result there is little information about the Vascones during this time. The Visigothic Kingdom circa 560. The Vascones and Varduli in the north. The chronicler John of Biclaro (c. 540 ‚Äì after 621) mentions the Vascones in a story about the foundation of the city of Victoriacum by the Visigoth king LiuvigildJohn of Biclaro (Chron. Min. II, 216):Leovigildus rex partem Vasconiae occupat et civitatem quae Victoriacum... (Schulten 1927:234) and Gregory of Tours (538‚Äì594) mentions the incursions of Wascones in Aquitaine during the year 587.Gr√©goire de Tours, Histoire des Francs: Les Gascons descendirent de leurs montagnes dans la plaine, d√©vast√®rent les villes, les champs... le duc Austrovald marcha souvent contre eux, mais ne parvint gu√®res √† en tirer vengeance, editor J.-L.-L.

Available on November 16h, 2006 in bnf.fr From these extracts and being the neighboring tribes absent in the historiography, Adolf Schulten (1870‚Äì1960) proposed the theory according to which at some point between the mid-2nd century and late 4th century, took place an enlargement of the territory of the Vascones, first in the west, occupying the lands of the Caristii, Varduli and Autrigones,(Schulten 1927:234) and later in the north in Aquitaine.(Schulten 1927:235) Schulten considers this to be the reason for the adoption of the name Gascony, which derivates from Gascon, which comes from Vascon, and used to denominate a region that includes the present-day Northern Basque Country. Claudio S√°nchez Albornoz, Spanish historian (1893‚Äì1984), on his work \\"Los vascones vasconizan la depresi√≥n vasca\\" (The Vascones \\"basquize\\" the Basque depression) published in 1972 expanded upon this hypothesis, relying on linguistic analysis: when invading the territories of what today is Biscay, Gipuzkoa and √Ålava displaced to Castile part of the Caristii, Varduli and Autrigones, who took refuge in the mountains; the ones who had not been displaced were \\"Basquized\\",Espa√±a un enigma hist√≥rico. Barcelona 1973. 451-452 while perhaps the Caristii, Varduli and Autrigones already spoke languages similar or related to the Basque language. However, research during last decades has called into question the possibility of an expansion northwards (J.J. Larrea). The inroad of the Vascones onto the plains of Aquitaine in 587 seems to be short-lived--they make their way back to the mountains--and archaeological findings in Eauze or Auch do not reveal instability or destruction during the alleged expanding period up to the mid-7th century. Another theory suggests a contemporary identification made by the Goths and the Franks of the Vascones (the most dynamic tribe) with all Basque speaking, Basque-related, or non-Romanized tribes. = 7th century = Starting on the 7th century, the historians already differentiate between Spagnovasconia, located southwestern of the Pyrenees, inside the Iberian Peninsula and Guasconia, northwestern of the Pyrenees, in Aquitaine. Schulten interprets that by this time the Vascones had already retreated from their territories in Roman times and started occupying lands in the north, what in the future would make the Southern Basque Country and northern Navarre.(Schulten 1927:240) Schulten also quotes the chronicle from Einhard, Vita Karoli Magni, dated in 810, where for the first time is used the term navarrese to define the people living in the former territories of the Vascones near the Ebro.(Schulten 1927:238)  History  Roman period Unlike the Aquitanians or Cantabrians, the Vascones seemed to have negotiated their status in the Roman Empire. In the Sertorian War, Pompey established his headquarters in their territory, founding Pompaelo. Romanization was rather intense in the area known as Ager Vasconum (the Ebro valley) but limited in the mountainous Saltus, where evidence of Roman civilization appears only in mining places, harbours, roads, and milestones, e.g. Oiasso. The territory was also important for Romans as a communication knot between northern Hispania and southwestern Gallia, who took good care to station detachments in different spots of the main communication lines. The Vasconian area presents indications of upheaval (burnt villas, an abundance of mints to pay the garrisons) during the 4th and 5th centuries that have been linked by many historians to the Bagaudae rebellions against feudalization, but also to the depredations of migrating Germanic and Asian tribes--Vandals, Alans, Sueves, Visigoths, possibly Heruls--into Hispania. Late Antiquity and Early Middle Ages In AD 407 Vascon troops fought on the orders of Roman commanders Didimus and Verinianus, repelling an attack by Vandals, Alans and Suebi. In 409, the passage of the Germanic peoples and Sarmatians toward Hispania went unhindered. The Roman reaction to this invasion and unrest related to the Bagaudae was to give Gallia Aquitania and Hispania Tarraconensis to the Visigoths in return for their services as allies by treaty (foederati). The Visigoths soon managed to expel the Vandals to Africa. After chronicler Hydatius¬¥s death in 469, no contemporary source exists reporting on the social and political situation in the Vasconias, as put by himself. At the beginning of the fourth century, Calagurris is still cited as a Vascon town. During the fifth and sixth centuries, the gap between town and the rural milieu widened, with the former falling much in decay. Between 581-7, chronicles start to mention the Vascones again, this time hailing from the wilderness, as opposed to the towns, which remained attached to Roman culture or were under Germanic influence. By the seventh to eighth centuries, Vascones were not confined to their ancient boundaries, but covered a much larger territory, from √Ålava in the west to the Loire in the north. The island of Ol√©ron, along with the √éle de R√©, formed the Vacetae Insulae \\"Vacetian Islands\\" according to the Cosmographia, where Vaceti are Vascones by another name. The concept underlying the medieval name points to a much wider reality than Strabo's former tribal definition, this time encompassing all Basque- speaking tribes. The independent Vascones stabilised their first polity under the Merovingian Franks: the Duchy of Vasconia, whose borders to the south remained unclear. This duchy would eventually become Gascony. During the reincorporation of Vasconia into Francia after 769, Charlemagne destroyed the walls of Pamplona after a failed attempt to conquer Zaragoza, the Vascones annihilated his rearguard in the Battle of Roncevaux Pass in 778--referred as \\"wasconicam perfidiam\\" by Frankish chroniclers. Pamplona was later captured by the Cordovan emir 'Abd al-Rahman I (781), but taken over by the Franks in 806, who assigned its government to a pro-Frankish local Belasko (\\"al-Galashki\\"), probably a Basque hailing from present-day Gascony. Some decades later, in 824, a second battle of Roncevaux took place that led to the establishment of the Kingdom of Pamplona, founded with Eneko Arista as head of the new polity, presented by Arab sources as leader of the Vascones (al-Baskunisi). However, the 824 Carolingian expedition itself included two different columns made up of Frankish and Vascones (Gascons). After the 9th century, the Vascones (Wascones, Guascones) come to be more closely identified in the records with the current territory of Gascony, at the time still a Basque-speaking territory but progressively being replaced by the new rising Romance language, Gascon.  Culture   Language and writing  Several authors point out(Gil Zubillaga 2006),(Fat√°s Cabeza 1972), (Kn√∂rr 2004), (Gorrochategui 1999), J. Caro Baroja sourced in (Bl√°zquez 1966:10) that prior to the Roman arrival and alike other peoples that inhabited the near region, the Vascones spoke a language that linguistsKoldo Mitxelena, Koldo Zuazo identify as the precursor of the modern Basque language, sometimes referred to as Proto-Basque language or Aquitanian language. However, as pointed out by Henrike Kn√∂rr (1947-2008) the origin and kinship of the Basque language is still a mystery(Kn√∂rr 2004) and an object of research. There are several theories about its origin; the Basque linguistic Koldo Mitxelena argues that an \\"in- situ\\" origin is the most likely,Nueva S√≠ntesis de la Historia del Pa√≠s Vasco: Desde la Prehistoria hasta el gobierno de Garaikoetxea, Ed. TTartalo, San Sebasti√°n, 2004. . and thus explains the current dialectical classificationKoldo Zuazo and the Basque dialects on Hiru.com while other theories advocate for a proposed kinship between the Basque language and other language families, like the languages of the Caucasus or a relation between Basque and the extinct Iberian language. So far, possible connections between Basque and other languages have remained unproven.Towards a History of the Basque Language. p. 190. Jos√© Ignacio Hualde, Joseba Andoni Lakarra, Robert Lawrence Trask, Koldo Mitxelena, etc. John Benjamins publishing company. Amsterdam/Philadelphia. 1997 Another problem that arises in the study of the language of the Vascones is the lack of direct classic records regarding the language spoken by this people,Joaqu√≠n Gorrochategui, La romanizaci√≥n del Pa√≠s Vasco: Aspectos ling√º√≠sticos., Euskal Herriko Unibertsitatea - Filolog√≠a. Art√≠culo en Guipuzkoakultura.net Ed. digital with the exception of a vague description by Strabo and Pomponius Mela, or the description made by Julius Caesar on the language of the Aquitanians in his work Commentarii de Bello Gallico. The study of epigraphic documents has been of greater interest, as some of them date the introduction of writing among the Vascones in the 2nd century.(Gil Zubillaga 2006) Among them, the oldest are the numismatic evidence coming from both Vasconic mints and others located nearby. A great importance is given to a funerary stele found in the Hermitage of Santa B√°rbara in Lerga,The inscription in the funerary stele of Lerga has been studied since the 19th Century by Achille Luchaire, Koldo Mitxelena and Joaqu√≠n Gorrochategui as a part of different researches about the Aquitanian language, as it includes the Aquitanian anthroponym of Vmmesahar (from ume, young child, and zahar, old); \\"umme sahar\\" =ume zahar = oldest son: Um.me, Sa.har(i) fi(lius), / Nar.hun.ge.si Abi- / sun.ha.ri fi.lio, / ann(orum) XXV. T(itulum) p(osuit) s(umptu) s(uo).. which is considered to be the oldest known written testimony of the Proto-Basque language.Koldo Mitxelena,Los nombres ind√≠genas de la inscripci√≥n hispanoromana de Lerga (Navarra), Pr√≠ncipe de Viana magazine, XXII, 82-83, pp 65-74, (1961) It is also believed that the Iberian language has left some traces on the Basque language, as with the Iberian term ili, adopted in Basque as hiri with the meaning of town or city, and present in the Vasconic name for the city of Pompaelo: \\"Iru√±a\\", as well as in other names of cities and towns.Irun (Gipuzkoa), Iru√±a (Alava)  Religion  The epigraphic and archaeological testimonies have allowed experts to determine some of the religious practices that were present among the Vascones since the Roman arrival and the introduction of writing. According to research done on this topic,Juan Jos√© Sayas Abengoechea, Algunas consideraciones sobre la cristianizaci√≥n de los Vascones, Pr√≠ncipe de Viana magazine, XLVI, 174, pp 35-56, 1985 religious syncretism lasted until the 1st Century; from that moment onwards and until the adoption of Christianity between the 4th and 5th centuries, Roman mythology was predominant.Rold√°n Jimeno, Or√≠genes del Cristianismo en la tierra de los vascones, Ed. Pamiela, Pamplona, 2003. Vasconic theonyms have been found on tombstones and altars, which further proves the syncretism between the pre-Christian Roman systems of beliefs and the Vasconic religions.Epigraphic catalog (in Basque) Two altars have been found in Uju√©, one dedicated to Lacubegi,Lacubegis: Coelii Te- / sphoros / et Festa / et Telesi- / nus, Lacu- / begi.

He was a 15-year veteran of the Los Angeles County District Attorney's office, where he was a co-prosecutor in the O. J. Simpson murder trial, a role in which he gained a great deal of national attention. Early life and education Darden was born in Richmond, California, the fourth of eight siblings. After graduating from John F. Kennedy High School in 1974, Darden enrolled at San Jose State University, where he participated in track and field and joined Alpha Phi Alpha, an African-American fraternity. He received his B.S. in criminal justice administration in 1977. Darden received his Juris Doctor from the University of California, Hastings, in 1980. Career Darden took and passed the California Bar Exam in the summer of 1980. Four months afterward, he was hired at the National Labor Relations Board in Los Angeles. Looking for a career change, he applied for and was hired for a position with the Los Angeles County District Attorney's Office. Darden was initially assigned to the Huntington Park office before moving on to Beverly Hills, and finally moved to the Criminal Courts Building (CCB) in downtown Los Angeles in late 1983. During his tenure as a prosecutor at the CCB, Darden served in the central trials and hard-core gang units before transferring to the Special Investigation Division (SID), which investigates criminal activity by public and law enforcement officials, in February 1988. It was in this position that Darden first met Johnnie Cochran, who represented some victims of alleged police violence. Darden and Cochran became close friends, with Darden seeing Cochran as a mentor figure. Darden initially became involved in the O. J. Simpson murder case after being asked by Deputy District Attorneys Marcia Clark and William Hodgman to lead the prosecution of Al Cowlings, Simpson's friend and the driver of the white Ford Bronco during the infamous car chase. After Darden's work on the Al Cowlings case ended, Clark requested Darden join the Simpson team as case manager since she and Hodgman were bogged down by various motions and filings from the defense. Darden was also tasked by Clark to prepare the prosecution's witnesses for testimony, including preparing testimony for key witness Detective Mark Fuhrman. After Hodgman was incapacited by stress related illness in the courtroom shortly before opening statements, Darden was named co-prosecutor. Darden's friendship with Cochran, who was a prominent figure on Simpson's defense team, became heavily strained due to their clashing positions regarding the inclusion of racism in the case. Simpson was ultimately acquitted. Darden resigned after the O.J. Simpson case and joined the faculty at California State University, Los Angeles, where he taught undergraduate criminal law. That same year, he was appointed Associate Professor of Law at Southwestern University School of Law. Darden taught and specialized in criminal procedure and trial advocacy. Darden is a former legal commentator for CNBC, CNN, Court TV, and NBC, and a frequent guest and commentator on CNN, Court TV, and Fox News Network. He has made guest appearances on Touched by an Angel, Girlfriends, The Tonight Show with Jay Leno, The Howard Stern Show, Muppets Tonight, Roseanne, the movie Liar Liar (uncredited), and the TV movie One Hot Summer Night (in which he plays a disgruntled policeman). He is the former principal attorney in the syndicated legal show Power of Attorney. Darden is also a writer. In addition to In Contempt, which chronicles his experiences with the O.J. Simpson trial, he co- authored (with Dick Lochte) a number of crime novels, including The Trials of Nikki Hill (1999), LA Justice (2000), and The Last Defense (2002). He appeared on the cover of Newsweek in 1996 with an article \\"My Case Against O.J.\\", which addressed his involvement and prosecution of OJ Simpson. Darden left the law school in 1999 and started his own firm, Darden & Associates, Inc., specializing in criminal defense and civil litigation. In December 2007, he was considered for elevation to a judgeship by California Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger. In an interview by Oprah Winfrey that aired February 9, 2006, Darden stated that he still believed Simpson was guilty. He added that he was nearly as disgusted with the perjury of Mark Fuhrman as by the murders of Goldman and Simpson. On September 6, 2012, Darden accused deceased Simpson defense lawyer Johnnie Cochran of manipulating' one of the infamous gloves\\", a claim Alan Dershowitz has called \\"a total fabrication\\", saying, \\"the defense doesn't get access to evidence except under controlled circumstances.\\" Darden represented Eric Ronald Holder, Jr. in his arraignment on April 4, 2019. Darden entered a not guilty plea on behalf of Holder, who is accused of murdering Nipsey Hussle. Darden dropped out of the case May 10, same day as the court date. Darden received multiple death threats for representing Holder. , Darden is representing a man accused of pulling a knife on a television crew at a COVID-19 anti-lockdown protest rally in Huntington Beach and forcing them to delete footage. It was reported in August 2020 that Darden would represent Corey Walker the alleged killer of Pop Smoke. Personal life Darden married TV executive Marcia Carter on August 31, 1997. Together they have three children. Although rumors persisted of a sexual relationship between Marcia Clark and Darden, both have denied such a relationship existed. Both consider their relationship to be extremely close, a result of the intense pressures of the Simpson trial. In 1996, he revealed he was a Republican and said he would disclose his Party choice at the 1996 Republican National Convention. Honors and awards *In 1998, Darden received the Crystal Heart Award from Loved Ones of Homicide Victims, an organization devoted to aiding families that have suffered the loss of loved ones as a result of violence. * In 2000, he was recognized as \\"Humanitarian of the Year\\" by Eli Horne, a California shelter for abused children and women.  In popular culture  * Darden and Marcia Clark were parodied in the Emmy- nominated Netflix sitcom Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt. * In The People v. O. J. Simpson: American Crime Story (2016), Darden was portrayed by Sterling K. Brown, who won an Emmy Award for his performance. * Darden and Marcia Clark were mentioned in the lyrics by T-Mo of the hip-hop group Goodie Mob in the song \\"Soul Food\\", saying \\"F--- Chris Darden, f--- Marsha Clark/Taking us when we're in the spotlight for a joke\\" * In 1997, Darden made an appearance on the Howard Stern Show running the question board for Jeopardy. Also appearing were Geraldo Rivera and Richard Belzer. * Darden was featured heavily via archive footage in Ezra Edelman's documentary O.J.: Made in America, which focused on the life and murder trial of O. J. Simpson. Darden himself was contacted by Edelman to participate in the documentary, but Darden declined.

(Russian title: Ledokol, –õ–µ–¥–æ–∫–æ–ª) is a military history book by the Russian non-fiction author Viktor Suvorov, first published in Russian in 1987 when he was living in the United Kingdom after defecting. Suvorov argued that Stalin planned a conquest of Europe for many years and was preparing to launch a surprise attack of Nazi Germany at the end of summer of 1941 to begin that plan. He says that Operation Barbarossa was a pre-emptive strike by Hitler, which the Nazi leader had argued. Since the 1990s and the dissolution of the Soviet Union, this theory has received some support among historians in some post-Soviet and Central European states, but Western scholars have criticized his conclusions for lack of evidence and documentation. Content Suvorov first wrote about the theory in a short 1985 article.Suvorov , V. [pseud.] (1985) \\"Who was planning to attack whom in June 1941, Hitler or Stalin?\\", in Journal of the Royal United Services Institute for Defense Studies, 130 (2): 50 ‚Äì 55. He expanded on it in his book Icebreaker and in subsequent books, ending with the 2008 monograph, The Chief Culprit: Stalin‚Äôl's Grand Design to Start World War II.Suvorov, V.[pseud.] (2008) The Chief Culprit: Stalin's Grand Design to Start World War II. Annapolis, MD : Naval Institute Press. He says that in 1930s, Stalin was planning a conquest of Europe, had been working toward this objective for many years, and directed his military to plan for it.Alexander Hill. \\"Soviet Planning for War, 1928 ‚Äì June 1941\\", in Zeiler, Thomas W., DuBois, Daniel M., eds. Companion to World War Two, 1. World War, 1939‚Äì1945. , 2013, Blackwell Publishing Ltd. p. 93 Suvorov argues that the Molotov- Ribbentrop Pact was engineered by Stalin to provoke Hitler to start a conflict with Western powers, which would have led to mutual exhaustion of \\"capitalist powers\\". Then, Stalin planned to seize an opportune moment to attack Germany from the east, overrun Europe, and establish Soviet control.. Suvorov considers Operation Barbarossa to have been a pre-emptive strike by Hitler, an act of self-defence in an attempt to prevent imminent Red Army assault.Teddy J. Uldricks, \\"Icebreaker Redux: The Debate on Stalin's Role in World War II Continues\\", in Kritika: Explorations in Russian and Eurasian History, Volume 11, Number 3, Summer 2010 (New Series), pp. 649‚Äì660 (Review). DOI: https://doi.org/10.1353/kri.0.0177 He argued that Soviet ground forces were well-organized and mobilized en masse along the German‚ÄìSoviet frontier for a Soviet invasion of Europe slated for Sunday, July 6, 1941, but they were unprepared to defend their own territory. He claimed that maps and phrasebooks issued to Soviet troops supported that theory. Military topographic maps, unlike other military supplies, are strictly local and cannot be used elsewhere than in the intended operational area. Suvorov claims that Soviet units were issued with maps of Germany and German-occupied territory and phrasebooks including questions about SA offices, which were found only in German territory proper. In contrast, maps of Soviet territory were scarce. Notably, after the German attack, the officer responsible for maps, Lieutenant General MK Kudryavtsev, was not punished by Stalin, who was known for extreme punishments after failures to obey his orders. According to Suvorov, that demonstrates that Kudryavtsev was obeying the orders of Stalin, who simply did not expect a German attack.Suvorov, Viktor. The Chief Culprit: Stalin's Grand Design to Start World War II. Annapolis, MD: Naval Institute Press, 2008. Suvorov offers as another piece of evidence the extensive effort Stalin took to conceal general mobilization by manipulating the laws setting the conscription age. That allowed Stalin to provide the expansive buildup of the Red Army. Since there was no universal military draft in the Soviet Union until 1939, by enacting the universal military draft on 1 September 1939 (the date that World War II had begun) and by changing the minimum age for joining the Red Army from 21 to 18, Stalin triggered a mechanism to achieve a dramatic increase in the military strength of the Red Army. This specific law on mobilization allowed the Red Army to increase its army of 1,871,600 men in 1939 to 5,081,000 in the spring of 1941 under secrecy to avoid alarming the rest of the world.V. Suvorov, The Chief Culprit: Stalin's Grand Design to Start World War 2 Naval Institute Press (2008) Also, 18,000,000 reservists were drafted for a duration of service of 2 years. Thus, according to supporters of that theory, the Red Army had to enter a war by 1 September 1941, or the drafted soldiers would have to be released from service.  Points  Suvorov's main points include the following: * The Soviet Union was intrinsically unstable. It had to expand to survive. According to Suvorov's interpretation of the permanent revolution theory, the communist system had to expand and occupy the entire world to survive. Otherwise, the system would fail in a peaceful and/or military struggle with surrounding \\"capitalist\\" countries. Stalin and other Soviet leaders opposed that and high-ranking officials who supported \\"permanent revolution\\" were purged from the Communist Party of the Soviet Union. Stalin publicly declared that \\"the ultimate victory of socialism... can only be achieved on an international scale\\".Pravda, February 14, 1938, cited from V. Suvorov Last Republic (), ACT, 1997, , pages 75‚Äì76 Under that theory, Soviet leaders therefore started preparations for a large-scale war of aggression. They officially declared an adherence to the theory of \\"Socialism in One Country\\" according to which socialism can win in a single country, without being immediately overthrown by hostile capitalist neighbors. The leading country would then help revolutionary movements in other countries. Either way, the Soviet prewar doctrine was based on the Marxism-Leninism theory that capitalism will be overthrown through communist revolution. * The Soviet Union made extensive preparations for a future war of aggression in the 1920s and the 1930s. Suvorov provides an extensive analysis of Stalin's preparations for war. According to Suvorov, there were supposed to be three Five-Year Plan phases to prepare the Soviet Union for war. The first focused on collectivization, the second on industrialisation, and the third on the militarization of the country. * Stalin escalated tensions in Europe by providing a combination of economic and military support to Weimar Germany and later to Nazi Germany (see Germany‚ÄìSoviet Union relations before 1941). After World War I, the Entente attempted to impose severe restrictions on Weimar Germany to prevent it from rearming and again becoming a significant military threat. During \\"the early 1920s until 1933, the Soviet Union was engaged in secret collaboration with the German military to enable it to circumvent the provisions of the Versailles Treaty\\", which limited Germany's military production. Moscow allowed the Germans to produce and test their weapons on Soviet territory, and some Red Army officers attended general-staff courses in Germany. The basis for that collaboration was the Treaty of Rapallo, signed between the two nations in 1922 and subsequent diplomatic interactions. The collaboration ended when the anticommunist Nazis took power in 1933. However, in 1932 and 1933, \\"Stalin helped Hitler come to power by forbidding German Communists to make common cause with the Social Democrats against the Nazis in parliamentary elections\\". Suvorov claims that Stalin's plan and vision was that Hitler's predictability and his violent reactionary ideas made him a candidate for the role of \\"icebreaker\\" for the communist revolution. By starting wars with European countries, Hitler would validate the Soviet entry into World War II by attacking Nazi Germany and \\"liberating\\" and Sovietizing all of Europe. When he concluded the Molotov‚ÄìRibbentrop Pact in 1939, Stalin \\"clearly counted on the repetition of the 1914‚Äì1918 war of attrition, which would leave the \\"capitalist\\" countries so exhausted that the USSR could sweep into Europe virtually unopposed\\" (see also Stalin's speech on August 19, 1939). * According to Suvorov and others, Stalin always planned to exploit military conflict between the capitalist countries to his advantage. He said as early as 1925, \\"Struggles, conflicts and wars among our enemies are... our great ally... and the greatest supporter of our government and our revolution\\" and \\"If a war does break out, we will not sit with folded arms ‚Äì we will have to take the field, but we will be last to do so. And we shall do so in order to throw the decisive load on the scale\\".Richard Pipes Communism: A History (2001) , pages 74‚Äì75. * World War II was initiated by the Soviet Union and Nazi Germany, which became co-belligerents after signing the Molotov‚ÄìRibbentrop Pact. The essence of the pact was in the secret protocols, which divided Europe into spheres of influence and removed the Polish buffer between Germany and the Soviet Union. Some countries that fell into the Soviet sphere of influence, Estonia and Latvia, were occupied. The difference between the smaller nations, occupied and annexed by the Soviets, and Poland, which was initially attacked by Germany, was that Poland had military assistance guarantees from Great Britain and France. * Stalin planned to attack Nazi Germany from the rear in July 1941, only a few weeks after the date on which the Axis invasion of the Soviet Union took place. According to Suvorov, the Red Army had already redeployed from a defensive to an offensive stance. Suvorov also states that Stalin had made no major defensive preparations. * Hitler's intelligence identified the Soviet preparations to attack Germany. Therefore, the Wehrmacht had drafted a pre-emptive war plan based on Hitler's orders as early as mid-1940, soon after the Soviet annexations of Bessarabia and Northern Bukovina. On June 22, 1941, the Axis began an assault on the Soviet Union. The book is based on an analysis of Soviet military investments, diplomatic maneuvers, Politburo speeches and other circumstantial evidences. Reception Icebreaker and subsequent books by Suvorov had sparkled what is currently known as \\"Suvorov's debates\\".

Europe-Asia Studies, Vol. 45, No. 2 (1993), pp. 303‚Äì341. Stable URL: https://www.jstor.org/stable/152863). It is currently believed that whereas the war against \\"capitalist powers\\" was seen as potentially inevitable by Soviet leadership and the Soviet Union was making some preparations for war, the Soviet pursuit for collective security system in Europe, or \\"Litvinov's line\\", was sincere in late 1930s, and the event that marked active Soviet war preparations was the rapid collapse of the Anglo-French alliance in 1940. \\"Suvorov's debates\\" The Suvorov's thesis has been strongly criticised by many scholars. The book is seen as an \\"anti-Soviet tract\\" in Western countries and is generally discredited.Hugh Ragsdale. The Munich Crisis and the Issue of Red Army Transit across Romania.

On radio (especially talk radio), it is common for an entire programme to be dedicated to a phone-in session. On television, phone-in's are often part of a wider discussion programme: a current example in the UK is the \\"Jeremy Vine\\" TV show. The concept dates to the early radio era: a December 1924 BBC 5NG Nottingham phone-in programme is described in a 1925 Radio Times article: \\"listeners ... enjoyed the novelty of hearing their own voices taking part\\". A prior attempted phone-in to a BBC 2LO London programme \\"led to such a rush on the telephones that the Post Office had to intervene\\". Speech based Talk Radio UK was launched in 1995, with much of its programming featuring phone-ins. It also introduced the notion of the shock jock to the UK, with presenters like Caesar the Geezer and Tommy Boyd constructing heated discussions. Ian Hutchby has researched power relations in phone ins, looking at arguments and confrontations. Using conversation analysis, he describes how the host retains power through devices such as \\"The Second Position\\" ‚Äì the concept of going second in a discussion, giving the host time to formulate a response. Similarly, the last word is always the broadcast word. The public can choose to end the conversation, but they are doing so by withdrawing from the interactional arena (Hutchby, 1996: 94-5; Talbot et al.). In 2007, the BBC suspended all phone-in competitions (but not voting) due to an internal inquiry into corruption in the production of these games in shows such as charity telethons after a nationwide inquiry into the whole process leading to the cancellation of ITV Play. In Ireland Liveline is a popular afternoon phone in show broadcast by RT√â Radio 1 that is hosted by Joe Duffy. The phone in program usually focuses on consumer issues, current affairs and complaints from members of the public regarding various issues. The program and its presenter are frequently lampooned by numerous Irish comedians, one being David McSavage, who play on the popular perception that the program is merely an outlet for the angst of serial complainers and housewives while providing entertainment for those who revel in listening to despair and tales of misery delivered the callers. A quality of the show that is frequently satirized is Duffy's seemingly exasperated expressions of despair upon hearing of the plight of a caller. Technology The caller is connected via a telephone hybrid, which connects the telephone line to the audio console through impedance matching, or more modernly through digital signal processing, which can improve the perceived audio quality of the call. Telephone calls are often organised through a system which also provides broadcast automation, with an administrative assistant answering calls and entering caller information on a personal computer, which also displays on the radio presenter's screen. A profanity delay is often used to keep profanity and other inappropriate material off the air. For contests, the conversation can be recorded and edited \\"on the fly\\", before playback on the air just a few minutes later.

Left to right: Tom Frost, Dorene Frost, Tony Jessen, Dennis Henneck, Terry King, Yvon Chouinard, Merle, and Davey Agnew. Black Diamond Equipment is a manufacturer of equipment for climbing, skiing, and mountain sports, based in Utah, United States. The company also has a global office in Innsbruck, Austria. The company is owned by Clarus Corporation, which also owns Pieps, ClimbOn! Skincare, and Sierra Bullets.  History  Black Diamond Equipment's history dates from the late 1950s, when climber Yvon Chouinard began hand-forging pitons and selling them from the trunk of his car in Yosemite Valley. Chouinard's pitons quickly gained a reputation for quality, and Chouinard Equipment was born soon after in Ventura, California. In early 1989, after several product-liability lawsuits and a continued lack of profitability, Yvon Chouinard placed the company in Chapter 11 bankruptcy. Black Diamond was founded on December 1, 1989, when the assets of Chouinard Equipment Ltd. were purchased by a group of former company employees led by (now former CEO) Peter Metcalf, and a few outside investors. Metcalf moved the company and its 45 employees from Ventura, California to the Salt Lake City, Utah area in September 1991 to be closer to the climbing and skiing opportunities provided by the Wasatch Mountains. In 1996, Black Diamond Equipment Europe was established in Reinach, Switzerland, making Black Diamond products more widely available throughout Europe. In 2006, Black Diamond Equipment Asia was established in Zhuhai, China to serve as both a secondary manufacturing facility, as well as a global distribution hub. In May 2010, Black Diamond Equipment was acquired for $90 million by Clarus Corporation. The resulting corporation was renamed and is now publicly traded on the NASDAQ under the name CLAR. In 2015, Black Diamond announced they would be expanding their Utah manufacturing facility. In 2016, they announced they would be moving their European headquarters from Reinach to Innsbruck in Austria.  Products  Black Diamond Equipment design and manufacture products for climbing, skiing, and mountain sports. Climbing products include carabiners, quickdraws, harnesses, active and passive climbing protection, belay devices, helmets, ice tools and piolets, crampons, ice screws, bouldering pads, and big wall equipment. They also produce skiing and avalanche safety equipment. The company's mountain products include tents and shelters, lighting, trekking poles, and backpacks. Over the years, Black Diamond has acquired and integrated several gear companies into its line, including Bibler tents (1997), Ascension climbing skins (1999), and Franklin climbing products (1998). In 2010, they acquired Gregory Mountain Products a manufacturer of backpacks, but later sold it to luggage maker Samsonite in 2014. Notable Black Diamond products include spring-loaded camming devices called Camalot and Magnetron carabiners, auto-locking carabiners that use magnets in the gate, and a steel insert in the carabiner's nose for added security.

Social Justice and Environmentalism When the Instagram page of Black Diamond posted a black page in solidarity with anti-police violence protesters on June 5, 2020 in which Black Diamond pledged $250,000 to support BIPOC athlete access to the outdoors, the company acknowledged it was aware of \\"widespread concerns\\" about its \\"association\\" with Clarus Corporation chief executive Warren Kanders, who also leads Safariland, the company which manufactured the tear gas widely used against peaceful protesters. Activists have called for a boycott of Black Diamond over these ties, which has been embraced by various climbing-related organizations. Safariland announced the divestiture of its crowd control products divisions, including tear gas, on June 9, 2020. The Clarus Corporation also faced criticism for a lack of diversity from pension fund giant CalPERS, who recommended in June 2020 that Clarus shareholders vote against re-electing executive chairman and largest shareholder Warren Kanders and two other board members. CalPERS owns 52,000 shares out of approximately 29,759,000 outstanding shares, or 0.175%. On June 9, 2020, Warren Kanders and other board members were re-elected to the board of directors. Black Diamond's parent the Clarus Corporation also owns ammunition company Sierra Bullets. In 2018, the company monitored discussions regarding the role of guns in the outdoor industry for boycotts. Former Black Diamond CEO Peter Metcalf had a history of political advocacy for both the outdoor industry and the public lands of Utah, and united with other outdoor companies against policies that threaten public lands and outdoor recreation. Black Diamond says that they recycle as much waste as possible, make substantial use of wind and solar power, and support environmental non-profit bodies.

The band's name comes from Twangste (also spelled as Tuwangste, Tvankste or Twankste), an Old Prussian word meaning \\"Oak Forest\\". Twangste was also the name of a small Old Prussian village roughly located at what is now the city of Kaliningrad (known as K√∂nigsberg until 1946) that was seized in 1255 by the Teutonic Knights. In the site of the settlement, the now-demolished K√∂nigsberg Castle was built. (The House of Soviets now stands on the former site of the castle.) Biography Tvangeste was formed in 1996 in Kaliningrad, Russia, and its line-up at the time consisted of Miron Chirva, Edgar, Nikolay \\"Kok\\" Kazmin and Klaus. However, in the following year, Edgar and Klaus left the band and were replaced by Asmodey and Julia. In 1998 they released two demo singles, Thinking... (that would be later re-recorded and included in their debut album) and Blood Dreams. Asmodey and Julia would leave shortly after, being replaced by Viktoria Kulbachnaya (from Romowe Rikoito) and Vano Mayarov (also known as Vanoe Mayoroff or Mayorov). With this line-up, Tvangeste released their debut full-length in 2000, Damnation of Regiomontum, via now-defunct Norwegian record label Valgarder. In 2001, Miron's then-girlfriend Naturelle joined the band, and in 2003 their second studio album, Firestorm, was released, via also now-defunct Japanese label Worldchaos Production. Polish musician Cezary Mielko worked as a session drummer on it. Also in 2003, Max Naumov joined the band, and Tvangeste became a quintet. In 2005, Miron and Naturelle married and moved to Niagara Falls, in Canada, while the three remaining members decided to stay in Russia. Around the same time Miron also provided vocals for Israeli black metal band Arafel's second studio album, Second Strike: Through the Flame of the Ages. Since 2006 Miron and Naturelle are working on Tvangeste's third studio album. Tentatively titled Satori (Japanese for \\"Illumination\\"), it was scheduled to be released via their own independent record label, Regiomontum Productions. Norwegian musician J√∏rn √òyhus served as a session drummer, and the orchestral instrumentation was provided by the City of Prague Philharmonic Orchestra, according to Miron. Having a long and convoluted production history, it currently has no set release date. The band's song \\"Birth of the Hero\\" was featured in the soundtrack of the 2009 video game Br√ºtal Legend. In February 2013, Miron was interviewed for Attention! Black Metal!, a Hungarian documentary that focuses on symphonic black metal bands. On 7 September 2016 the band announced on their official Facebook page the death of their former bassist/guitarist, Vano Mayarov. Discography Demo tapes * Blood Dreams (1997) * Thinking...

He debuted as a superhero starring in his stories in Action Comics during the Golden Age of Comics first appearing in the first issue. He is depicted as a stage magician who also practices actual magic. The character would make sporadic appearances within the fictional DC Universe, being a supporting character associated to his daughter Zatanna along with a few connections to Batman. Publication history He first appeared starring in his own story \\"Zatara Master Magician\\" by writer and artist Fred Guardineer in the anthology American comic book series Action Comics, starting with the first issue (June 1938). According to writer Al Sulman, \\"the time came when [Fred Guardineer] didn't want to draw [the Zatara series] anymore, so the editor turned it over to my brother [Joe Sulman], and he began to draw the strip; but he had to imitate Fred Guardineer's drawing style, because the character had to look [the same], and it worked out fine.\\" Fictional character biography John Zatara is introduced as a magician in various publications of DC Comics, beginning with 1938's Action Comics # 1, which also contains the first appearance of Superman. Like the very similar Mandrake the Magician, Zatara had a large East Indian as a friend/bodyguard, called Tong, to share his early adventures. As well as being an illusionist, Zatara also had genuine magical powers (decades later ascribed to being a descendant of the Homo magi), which he focused through speaking backwards: he could do anything so long as he could describe it in (\\"backwards speech\\"). This helped distinguish Zatara from the numerous Mandrake the Magician knockoffs that cluttered the comics and pulp magazines of the day, although Merlin the Magician (Quality Comics) also had this attribute, and it was also given to him by Zatara's creator, Fred Guardineer. According to Jess Nevins' Encyclopedia of Golden Age Superheroes, \\"He fights Egyptian wizards, an evil Druid, Zulus, a Mad Lama, Mongol warriors, the Gorilla King, a Saturnian terror, and Moon Men.\\" His love of magic began early when he was given a magic kit by his uncle, himself a professional illusionist. Although he began learning the craft in childhood, his early attempts at performing professionally were unsuccessful until he realized that he needed to work on his showmanship. His lessons in magic were bolstered by visits from the Phantom Stranger, and he had a sexual relationship with Madame Xanadu, but she refused to marry him because she saw his future.Madame Xanadu Disenchanted #9 (2009) To that end, he acquired the old diaries of Leonardo da Vinci, who was a direct ancestor. While reading the diaries, which Da Vinci wrote in backwards spelling as a security precaution, Zatara learned that his family had the command of magic. He discovered this inadvertently when he accidentally gave a command to a mannequin to begin waving an arm wildly. Zatara realized that he could command it to stop by giving the order in backwards spelling. With this new knowledge, Zatara developed a successful show. During the premiere performance, a fire broke out on stage, forcing Zatara to use his command of real magic to put it out. While the audience mistook the incident as part of the act, Zatara realized that this power could be invaluable in helping people and he resolved to use it as such between shows. Zatara became good friends with Thomas Wayne. His excursions with Wayne led to Wayne meeting his wife, Martha. After the two were killed, Zatara left Gotham City, blaming himself for being unable to stop the orphaning of young Bruce. Eventually, in Europe, Zatara would meet and wed Sindella, who gave birth to their daughter, Zatanna. Sindella seemingly died after giving birth to Zatanna, prompting Zatara to become a depressed drunk. Things changed for the better in Zatara's life when a young Bruce Wayne arrived, requesting Zatara to teach him to become an escape artist and illusionist. Bruce's appearance prompted Zatara to address his alcoholism. Zatanna's search Zatanna, Zatara's daughter from a Homo magi mother,The Spectre (vol. 2) #7 was introduced in a multipart crossover in which she attempted to find her father, and he attempted to stop her at every turn, because he knew that a spell had been placed upon them both that would cause them to both die if they saw one another. This adventure includes Zatara confronting an evil warlock on a world where nothing changes or grows older. Zatara steals his adversary's teleportation crystal in a somewhat-successful attempt to stop the man from invading Earth.Green Lantern #42 (Jan. 1966) Zatara ends up trapped in the land of Kharma by a sorceress called Allura, whom he had trapped in the Sword of Paracelsus. Allura turned out to have a good twin, also called Allura, who forced her to remove the spell.Justice League of America #51 Death At the conclusion of Alan Moore's \\"American Gothic\\" storylineChronicled in Swamp Thing (vol. 2) #35-50 (April 1985-July 1986)(which was tied to the events of Crisis on Infinite Earths), John Constantine comes to get Zatanna, Mento and Sargon the Sorcerer to come together to help demonic and divine forces in other hellish dimensions battle the entity known as the 'Great Evil Beast'. The s√©ance is held at Wintersgate Manor, the home of Baron Winters in Georgetown, Washington D.C., which is also a temporal threshold to other planes of reality. Because Constantine had previously taken Zatanna to a \\"tantric studies meeting\\", Zatara will not let Zatanna out of his sight with Constantine present and, by his very presence, is forced to take part in the seance to which he was not invited. The Beast, which is so tall that its thumb alone looms over Hell, takes notice of their group twice. The first glimpse dooms Sargon, whom Zatara convinces to 'die like a sorcerer' and not break the holding of hands. Sargon burns to death nobly. The second glimpse starts to literally heat up Zatanna. Zatara willingly takes the effect onto himself, dying (his smoldering hat lands on the table), but sparing his daughter's life.Swamp Thing (vol. 2) #49-50 (June-July 1986) Afterlife problems Since then he has made sporadic appearances in the afterlife, including resurrecting Mason O'Dare in Starman (vol. 2) #80, and the Seven Soldiers: Zatanna miniseries.Seven Soldiers: Zatanna #1‚Äì4 (2005) In the Reign in Hell miniseries, Zatara is part of a general resistance movement operating in Hell. He is caught up in the various conflicts and is slain a second time in Hell by a rampaging Lobo. As with most of the 'dead', he risks becoming fodder for Hell, a torment where the physicality of the damned is used for general resources, such as building material. By manipulating his blood to form words, he asks Zatanna to consign his soul to the 'Abyss', a realm that Hell cannot touch. Zatanna does so, tormented that she must now destroy her father's essence.Reign in Hell #5 His nephew Zachary now uses the Zatara name as a stage magician, going so far, in the alternate future of the Titans Tomorrow timeline, to model his physical appearance and heroic getup on the vintage clothing and grooming of his late uncle. In Justice League of America (vol. 2) #39‚Äì40, a tie-in to the Blackest Night crossover event, Zatara was reanimated as a member of the Black Lantern Corps, ready to attack his daughter, Zatanna, in the Hall of Justice. Zatanna is successful in banishing the Black Lantern, but was left psychologically crushed from having to again kill her father (after watching him die once before).Justice League of America (vol. 2) #39‚Äì40 Other versions Kingdom Come Another Zatara was featured in a supporting role in the miniseries Kingdom Come and its follow-up, The Kingdom. This Zatara is the son of Zatanna and magician John Constantine, which makes him the grandson of the original. He is described as \\"a youthful Harry Houdini-like successor to the magician super-hero lineage.\\" Rather than speak backwards just for his spells, however, he does it all the time, which annoys his colleagues no end.The Kingdom: Offspring #1 Flashpoint In the alternate timeline of the Flashpoint crossover event, Zatara was transformed into a motorcycle; his daughter, Zatanna is his owner.Flashpoint: Secret Seven #2 (July 2011) In other media Film =DC Extended Universe= Zatara is rumored to appear alongside his daughter and other magic-based DC Characters in a film developed by Guillermo del Toro, set within the DC Extended Universe, titled Dark Universe. The film will be based on the comic book superhero team, the Justice League Dark.EXCLUSIVE: Se√±or Fenix Knows The Futures Of LOCKE & KEY, POWERS, REVIVIAL, JJ Abrams and Guillermo del Toro Television =Live-action= * Zatara is mentioned several times by his daughter in the Smallville episode \\"Hex\\". In that episode, his daughter Zatanna attempts to bring him back to life with a magic spell. In order to do that, she must sacrifice a life which she intends to be her own. =Animation= Zatara in Batman: The Animated Series * The first broadcast depiction of Zatara was in a flashback in the Batman: The Animated Series episode \\"Zatanna,\\" in which he was voiced by Vincent Schiavelli. Zatara had trained Bruce Wayne as an escape artist, but there is no suggestion that he has command of actual real magic as in the comics. Zatara has already died under unspecified circumstances by the time that episode took place. Zatara is also mentioned by Batman as his mentor in ventriloquism in the episode \\"Read My Lips\\". * Giovanni Zatara appears in the Young Justice TV series voiced by Nolan North in an Italian accent. He appears as one of the 16-member roster for the Justice League in that show. He is later forced to don the supreme mystical Helmet of Fate therefore becoming the second Doctor Fate, partially possessed by the spirit Nabu himself. Doctor Fate is later inducted into the Justice League as well. In the episode \\"Private Security\\", Nabu had agreed to release Zatara for one hour on a yearly basis to spend time with Zatanna before he has to return to being Doctor Fate. * Giovanni Zatara appears in the DC Super Hero Girls TV series, voiced by Phil LaMarr. Miscellaneous * In addition, in the Cartoon Monsoon contest, Zatara appeared in the Zatanna entry as the frustrated father of the title character, voiced by Steve Blum. The story was set during Zatanna's teen years and took certain liberties. * Zatara is shown in a crossover comic in The Batman Adventures and Superman Adventures. The two comics show Batman and Superman in respective pursuit of red and blue amulets owned by Zatara that opened ways to another dimension. The comics also show a flashback of a teenage Bruce Wayne and Clark Kent both seeking magic lessons from Zatara, although neither come into contact with each other, but both use the pseudonym \\"John Smith\\".

Known particularly for her western rock and soul influences, flirtatious dancing, and risque lyrics, Pen Ran has been described by the New York Times as a \\"worldly, wise-cracking foil\\" to the more restrained Cambodian pop singers of her era. She disappeared during the Khmer Rouge genocide and her exact fate is unknown. Life and career Very little is known of Pen Ran's personal history. It has been established that she was from Battambang in northwestern Cambodia and attended the same school as the younger Ros Serey Sothea, another popular singer of the same era. Pen Ran had a sister named Pen Ram (sometimes Romanized as Pan Rom) who was also a singer in the later years of the Cambodian psychedelic rock scene.John Pirozzi and LinDa Saphan, liner notes, Don't Think I've Forgotten, soundtrack, 2015.Jeff Cole, liner notes, Cambodia Rock Spectacular!, 2011. In the 1960s, Cambodian Head of State Norodom Sihanouk, a musician himself, encouraged the development of popular music in Cambodia. Initially, pop records from France and Latin America were imported into the country and became popular, inspiring a flourishing pop music scene based in Phnom Penh and led by singers like Sinn Sisamouth. Pen Ran was an early entrant in this music scene, with the hit song \\"Pka Kabas\\" in 1963, but she became a national star when she began recording with Sinn Sisamouth in 1966. Starting in the late 1960s Ran recorded many collaborations with Sisamouth and other notable Cambodian singers of the period, while continuing her solo career. The debut of the popular Ros Serey Sothea in 1967 had little effect on Pen Ran's career and perhaps even broadened her popularity as the second leading lady of Cambodian popular music. Style and legacy Pen Ran was known for her unrestrained personality and western-oriented hairstyles and fashions, rejecting traditional demands on Khmer women and representing new and modern gender roles. Her onstage dancing and flirtatious lyrics were considered scandalous in Cambodia at the time. Translated titles of her songs indicate her risque focus on romance and sexuality (for example, \\"I'm Unsatisfied\\" and \\"I Want to Be Your Lover\\") and a rejection of traditional courtship (for example, \\"It's Too Late Old Man\\"). Near the end of her music career Pen Ran was still an unmarried career woman in her early thirties, which was also unusual for Cambodia at the time. She addressed this topic in the song \\"I'm 31\\" which was an answer to Ros Serey Sothea's hit song \\"I'm 16.\\" Pen Ran was known to be a very versatile singer, having a repertoire consisting of traditional Cambodian music, rock, twist, cha cha cha, agogo, mambo, madizon, jazz, and folk. When discussing her vocal abilities, one researcher has said \\"Pan Ron hits notes that shatter glass.\\" Decades later, Nick Hanover described the unique combination of Cambodian and Western influences in the track \\"Rom Jongvak Twist\\" as \\"a Cambodian spin on American dance crazes that sounds less like Chubby Checker than Lydia Lunch.\\" Throughout her career, she is believed to have performed on hundreds of songs, many of which she wrote herself. Pen Ran disappeared during the Khmer Rouge genocide of the late 1970s and her exact fate is unknown. Her younger sister Pen Ram said that she survived until the Vietnamese invasion of late 1978/early 1979 when the Khmer Rouge launched their final series of mass executions. Given the goal of the Khmer Rouge to remove foreign influences from Cambodian society, Pen Ran's individuality probably ensured her death. In a 2015 BBC documentary on the band Cambodian Space Project, who have covered many of Pen Ran's songs, it was alleged by an interview subject that she was tricked by the Khmer Rouge into performing one of her songs, after which she was led away and executed.Marc Eberle, \\"The Cambodian Space Project: Not Easy Rock'n'Roll\\" (6 June 2015) Starting in the late 1990s, interest in Pan Ron's music was revived by the album Cambodian Rocks and similar CD compilations, while the documentary film Don't Think I've Forgotten described her as one of the most influential artists of her era, as well as one of the most popular artists amongst younger Cambodians.

They are the second-most numerous ethnic group among the Turkic peoples after Turkish people and are predominantly Shia Muslims. They comprise the largest ethnic group in the Republic of Azerbaijan and the second-largest ethnic group in neighboring Iran and Georgia. The world's largest number of ethnic Azerbaijanis live in Iran, followed by the Republic of Azerbaijan. They speak the Azerbaijani language, belonging to the Oghuz branch of the Turkic languages. Following the Russo-Persian Wars of 1813 and 1828, the territories of the Qajar Iran in the Caucasus were ceded to the Russian Empire, and the treaties of Gulistan in 1813 and Turkmenchay in 1828 finalized the borders between Russia and Iran. After more than 80 years of being under the Russian Empire in the Caucasus, the Azerbaijan Democratic Republic was established in 1918 which established the territory of the Republic of Azerbaijan. The name of \\"Azerbaijan\\" which the leading Musavat party adopted, for political reasons, was, prior to the establishment of the Azerbaijan Democratic Republic in 1918, exclusively used to identify the adjacent region of contemporary northwestern Iran. The Azerbaijani language is closely related to Turkish, Qashqai, Gagauz, Turkmen and Crimean Tatar, sharing varying degrees of mutual intelligibility with each of those languages. Certain lexical and grammatical differences formed within the Azerbaijani language as spoken in the Republic of Azerbaijan and Iran, after nearly two centuries of separation between the communities speaking the language; mutual intelligibility, however, has been preserved. Additionally, the Turkish and Azerbaijani languages are mutually intelligible to a high enough degree that their speakers can have simple conversation without prior knowledge of the other. Etymology Azerbaijan is believed to be named after Atropates, a Persian satrap (governor) who ruled in Atropatene (modern Iranian Azerbaijan) circa 321 BC. The name Atropates is the Hellenistic form of Old Persian Aturpat which means 'guardian of fire' itself a compound of ƒÅt≈´r (25px) 'fire' (later garbled into ƒÅdur (ÿ¢ÿ∞ÿ±) in (early) New Persian, and is pronounced ƒÅzar today)MacKenzie, D. (1971). A concise Pahlavi dictionary (p. 5, 8, 18). London: Oxford university press. \\\\+ -pat (20px) suffix for -guardian, -lord, -master (-pat in early Middle Persian, -bod (ÿ®ŸèÿØ) in New Persian). Present-day name Azerbaijan is the Arabicized from of ƒÄzarpƒÅyegƒÅn (Persian: ÿ¢ÿ∞ÿ±Ÿæÿß€å⁄ØÿßŸÜ) meaning 'the guardians of fire' later becoming corrupted to Azerbaijan (Persian: ÿ¢ÿ∞ÿ±ÿ®ÿß€åÿ¨ÿßŸÜ) due to the phonemic shift from /p/ to /b/ and /g/ to /j/ which is a result of the medieval Arabic influences that followed the Arab invasion of Iran, and is due to the lack of the phoneme /p/ and /g/ in the Arabic language. The word AzarpƒÅyegƒÅn itself is ultimately from Old Persian ƒÄturpƒÅtakƒÅn (Persian: ÿ¢ÿ™Ÿàÿ±Ÿæÿßÿ™⁄©ÿßŸÜ) meaning 'the land associated with (satrap) Aturpat' or 'the land of fire guardians' (-an, here garbled into -kƒÅn , is a suffix for association or forming adverbs and plurals; e.g.: Gilan 'land associated with Gil people').Aliyev, Igrar.

Historical Azerbaijan (also known as Iranian Azerbaijan) is believed to be named after him.

Persians, Iranians, or Ajams ‚Äì that is to say that religious identification prevailed over ethnic identification. When the Southern Caucasus became part of the Russian Empire in the nineteenth century, the Russian authorities, who traditionally referred to all Turkic people as Tatars, defined Tatars living in the Transcaucasus region as Caucasian or Aderbeijanskie (–ê–¥–µ—Ä–±–µ–π–¥–∂–∞–Ω—Å–∫–∏–µ) Tatars in order to distinguish them from other Turkic groups. The Russian Brockhaus and Efron Encyclopedic Dictionary, written in the 1890s, also referred to Tatars in Azerbaijan as Aderbeijans (–∞–¥–µ—Ä–±–µ–π–¥–∂–∞–Ω—ã), but noted that the term had not been widely adopted. This ethnonym was also used by Joseph Deniker: In Azerbaijani language publications, the expression \\"Azerbaijani nation\\" referring to those who were known as Tatars of the Caucasus first appeared in the newspaper Kashkul in 1880. History Ancient residents of the area spoke Old Azeri from the Iranian branch of the Indo-European languages. In the 11th century AD with Seljukid conquests, Oghuz Turkic tribes started moving across the Iranian Plateau into the Caucasus and Anatolia. The influx of the Oghuz and other Turkmen tribes was further accentuated by the Mongol invasion. Here, the Oghuz tribes divided into various smaller groups, some of whom ‚Äì mostly Sunni ‚Äì moved to Anatolia (i.e., the later Ottomans) and became settled, while others remained in the Caucasus region and later ‚Äì due to the influence of the Safaviyya ‚Äì eventually converted to the Shia branch of Islam. The latter was to keep the name \\"Turkmen\\" or \\"Turcoman\\" for a long time: from the 13th century onwards they gradually Turkified the Iranian-speaking populations of Azerbaijan (historic Azerbaijan, also known as Iranian Azerbaijan) and Shirvan (Azerbaijan Republic), thus creating a new identity based on Shia and the use of Oghuz Turkic. Today, this Turkic-speaking population is known as Azerbaijani. Ancient period Caucasian-speaking Albanian tribes are believed to be the earliest inhabitants of the region where the modern-day Republic of Azerbaijan is located. Early Iranian settlements included the Scythians (Ishkuza Kingdom) in the ninth century BC. Following the Scythians, the Medes came to dominate the area to the south of the Aras River. Ancient Iranian people of the Medes forged a vast empire between 900 and 700 BC, which the Achaemenids integrated into their own empire around 550 BC. During this period, Zoroastrianism spread in the Caucasus and in Atropatene. Alexander the Great defeated the Achaemenids in 330 BC, but allowed the Median satrap Atropates to remain in power. Following the decline of the Seleucids in Persia in 247 BC, an Armenian Kingdom exercised control over parts of Caucasian Albania. Caucasian Albanians established a kingdom in the first century BC and largely remained independent until the Persian Sassanids made their kingdom a vassal state in 252 AD. Caucasian Albania's ruler, King Urnayr, went to Armenia and then officially adopted Christianity as the state religion in the fourth century AD, and Albania remained a Christian state until the 8th century. Sassanid control ended with their defeat by Muslim Arabs in 642 AD, through the Muslim conquest of Persia. Medieval period Muslim Arabs defeated the Sassanids and Byzantines as they marched into the Caucasus region. The Arabs made Caucasian Albania a vassal state after the Christian resistance, led by Prince Javanshir, surrendered in 667. Between the ninth and tenth centuries, Arab authors began to refer to the region between the Kura and Aras rivers as Arran. During this time, Arabs from Basra and Kufa came to Azerbaijan and seized lands that indigenous peoples had abandoned; the Arabs became a land-owning elite. Conversion to Islam was slow as local resistance persisted for centuries and resentment grew as small groups of Arabs began migrating to cities such as Tabriz and Maraghah. This influx sparked a major rebellion in Iranian Azerbaijan from 816‚Äì837, led by a Persian Zoroastrian commoner named Babak Khorramdin. However, despite pockets of continued resistance, the majority of the inhabitants of Azerbaijan converted to Islam. Later, in the 10th and 11th centuries, parts of Azerbaijan were ruled by the Kurdish dynasty of Shaddadid and Arab Radawids. In the middle of the eleventh century, the Seljuq dynasty overthrew Arab rule and established an empire that encompassed most of Southwest Asia. The Seljuk period marked the influx of Oghuz nomads into the region. The emerging dominance of the Turkic language was chronicled in epic poems or dastans, the oldest being the Book of Dede Korkut, which relate allegorical tales about the early Turks in the Caucasus and Asia Minor. Turkic dominion was interrupted by the Mongols in 1227, but it returned with the Timurids and then Sunni Qara Qoyunl≈´ (Black Sheep Turkmen) and Aq Qoyunl≈´ (White Sheep Turkmen), who dominated Azerbaijan, large parts of Iran, eastern Anatolia, and other minor parts of West Asia, until the Shi'a Safavids took power in 1501.

T. I, 1839 The Safavids, who rose from around Ardabil in Iranian Azerbaijan and lasted until 1722, established the foundations of the modern Iranian state. The Safavids, alongside their Ottoman archrivals, dominated the entire West Asian region and beyond for centuries. At its peak under Shah Abbas the Great, it surpassed its political and ideological archrival the Ottoman empire in military strength. Noted for achievements in state-building, architecture, and the sciences, the Safavid state crumbled due to internal decay (mostly royal intrigues), ethnic minority uprisings and external pressures from the Russians, and the eventually opportunistic Afghans, who would mark the end of the dynasty. The Safavids encouraged and spread Shi'a Islam, as well as the arts and culture, and Shah Abbas the Great created an intellectual atmosphere that according to some scholars was a new \\"golden age\\". He reformed the government and the military and responded to the needs of the common people. After the Safavid state disintegrated, it was followed by the conquest by Nader Shah Afshar, a Shia chieftain from Khorasan who reduced the power of the ghulat Shi'a and empowered a moderate form of Shi'ism, and, exceptionally noted for his military genius, making Iran reach its greatest extent since the Sassanid Empire. The brief reign of Karim Khan came next, followed by the Qajars, who ruled what is the present-day Azerbaijan Republic and Iran from 1779. Russia loomed as a threat to Persian and Turkish holdings in the Caucasus in this period. The Russo-Persian Wars, despite already having had minor military conflicts in the 17th century, officially began in the eighteenth century and ended in the early nineteenth century with the Treaty of Gulistan of 1813 and the Treaty of Turkmenchay in 1828, which ceded the Caucasian portion of Qajar Iran to the Russian Empire. While Azerbaijanis in Iran integrated into Iranian society, Azerbaijanis who used to live in Aran, were incorporated into the Russian Empire.

This was followed by March Days massacresRussia and a Divided Azerbaijan: A Borderland in Transition, by Tadeusz ≈öwiƒôtochowski, Columbia University Press, 1995, p. 66 that took place between 30 March and 2 April 1918 in the city of Baku and adjacent areas of the Baku Governorate of the Russian Empire. When the republic dissolved in May 1918, the leading Musavat party adopted the name \\"Azerbaijan\\" for the newly established Azerbaijan Democratic Republic, which was proclaimed on 27 May 1918, for political reasons, even though the name of \\"Azerbaijan\\" had always been used to refer to the adjacent region of contemporary northwestern Iran. The ADR was the first modern parliamentary republic in the Turkic world and Muslim world. Among the important accomplishments of the Parliament was the extension of suffrage to women, making Azerbaijan the first Muslim nation to grant women equal political rights with men. Another important accomplishment of ADR was the establishment of Baku State University, which was the first modern-type university founded in Muslim East. By March 1920, it was obvious that Soviet Russia would attack the much-needed Baku. Vladimir Lenin said that the invasion was justified as Soviet Russia could not survive without Baku's oil. Independent Azerbaijan lasted only 23 months until the Bolshevik 11th Soviet Red Army invaded it, establishing the Azerbaijan SSR on 28 April 1920. Although the bulk of the newly formed Azerbaijani army was engaged in putting down an Armenian revolt that had just broken out in Karabakh, Azeris did not surrender their brief independence of 1918‚Äì20 quickly or easily. As many as 20,000 Azerbaijani soldiers died resisting what was effectively a Russian reconquest. The brief independence gained by the short-lived Azerbaijan Democratic Republic in 1918‚Äì1920 was followed by over 70 years of Soviet rule. After the restoration of independence in October 1991, the Republic of Azerbaijan became embroiled in a war with neighboring Armenia over the Nagorno-Karabakh region. Modern period in Iran In Iran, Azerbaijanis such as Sattar Khan sought constitutional reform. The Persian Constitutional Revolution of 1906‚Äì11 shook the Qajar dynasty. A parliament (Majlis) was founded on the efforts of the constitutionalists, and pro-democracy newspapers appeared. The last Shah of the Qajar dynasty was soon removed in a military coup led by Reza Khan. In the quest to impose national homogeneity on a country where half of the population were ethnic minorities, Reza Shah banned in quick succession the use of the Azerbaijani language in schools, theatrical performances, religious ceremonies, and books. Sattar Khan (1868‚Äì1914) was a major revolutionary figure in the late Qajar period in Iran. Upon the dethronement of Reza Shah in September 1941, Soviet forces took control of Iranian Azerbaijan and helped to set up the Azerbaijan People's Government, a client state under the leadership of Sayyid Jafar Pishevari backed by Soviet Azerbaijan. The Soviet military presence in Iranian Azerbaijan was mainly aimed at securing the Allied supply route during World War II. Concerned with the continued Soviet presence after World War II, the United States and Britain pressured the Soviets to withdraw by late 1946. Immediately thereafter, the Iranian government regained control of Iranian Azerbaijan. According to Professor Gary R. Hess: Origins of the Azerbaijanis In many references, Azerbaijanis are designated as a Turkic people, due to their Turkic language. Modern-day Azerbaijanis are believed to be primarily the descendants of the Caucasian Albanian and Iranian peoplesRoy, Olivier (2007). The new Central Asia. I.B.

Here they divided into Ottomans, who were Sunni and settled, and Turkmens, who were nomads and in part Shiite (or, rather, Alevi). The latter was to keep the name 'Turkmen' for a long time: from the 13th century onwards they 'Turkified' the Iranian populations of Azerbaijan (who spoke west Iranian languages such as Tat, which is still found in residual forms), thus creating a new identity based on Shiism and the use of Turkish.

Historian Vladimir Minorsky writes that largely Iranian and Caucasian populations became Turkic-speaking: The Azerbaijanis of Iran are believed to be descended from various groups, including Mannaeans, an ancient people who lived in the territory of present-day northwestern Iran to the south of Lake Urmia at around the 10th to 7th centuries BC, and spoke a dialect related to Hurrian (a non-Semitic and non-Indo-European language related to Urartian), and the Medes, an ancient Iranian ethnic group which, under the rule of King Cyaxares, established the Median Empire and came to dominate the region. The Median Empire is believed to have conquered and assimilated the Mannaeans by the 6th century BC. Historical research suggests that the Old Azeri language, belonging to the Northwestern branch of the Iranian languages and believed to have descended from the language of the Medes, gradually gained currency and was widely spoken in the said region for many centuries. Some Azerbaijanis of the Republic of Azerbaijan are believed to be descended from the inhabitants of Caucasian Albania, an ancient country located in the eastern Caucasus region, and various Iranian peoples which settled the region. They claim there is evidence that, despite repeated invasions and migrations, the aboriginal Caucasian population may have gradually been culturally and linguistically assimilated, first by Iranian peoples, such as the Persians, and later by the Oghuz Turks. Considerable information has been learned about the Caucasian Albanians, including their language, history, early conversion to Christianity, and relations with the Armenians and Georgians, under whose strong religious and cultural influence the Caucasian Albanians came in the coming centuries.

Fuz√ªl√Æ is considered one of the greatest Azerbaijani poets.\\"Fuzuli, Mehmed bin S√ºleyman\\" in Encyclop√¶dia Britannica Turkification of the Azerbaijanis derives from the Turkic settlements in the area now known as Azerbaijan, which began and accelerated during the Seljuk period. The migration of Oghuz Turks from present-day Turkmenistan, which is attested by linguistic similarity, remained high through the Mongol period, as many troops under the Ilkhans were Turkic. By the Safavid period, the Turkic nature of Azerbaijan increased with the influence of the Qizilbash, an association of the TurkomanDavid Blow. Shah Abbas: The Ruthless King Who Became an Iranian Legend. p. 165. \\"The primary court language remained Turkish. But it was not the Turkish of Istambul. It was a Turkish dialect, the dialect of the Qizilbash Turkomans...\\" nomadic tribes that was the backbone of the Safavid Empire. Most academics view the linguistic Turkicisation of predominantly non-Turkic-speaking indigenous peoples and assimilation of small populations of Turkic tribes as the most likely origin for the people of Azerbaijan. Some genetic research on the Azerbaijani people supports the view that the Azerbaijanis originate from a native population long resident in the area who adopted a Turkic language through a process of \\"elite dominance\\", i.e. a limited number of Turkic settlers had a substantial cultural impact but left only weak patrilineal genetic traces. Iranian origin The Iranian origins of the Azerbaijanis likely derive from ancient Iranian tribes, such as the Medes in Iranian Azerbaijan, and Scythian invaders who arrived during the eighth century BC. It is believed that the Medes mixed with Mannai. Ancient written accounts, such as one written by Arab historian Al-Masudi, attest to an Iranian presence in the region: Archaeological evidence indicates that the Iranian religion of Zoroastrianism was prominent throughout the Caucasus before Christianity and Islam. It has also been hypothesized that the population of Iranian Azerbaijan was predominantly Persian-speaking before the Oghuz arrived. This claim is supported by the many figures of Persian literature who came from regions now populated by ethnic Azerbaijani and who wrote in Persian prior to and during the Oghuz migration, such as Qatran Tabrizi, Shams Tabrizi, Nizami Ganjavi, and Khaghani. It is also supported by Nozhat al-Majales anthology, Strabo, Al- Istakhri, and Al-Masudi, who all describe the language of the region as Persian. The claim is mentioned by other medieval historians, such as Al- Muqaddasi. Encyclop√¶dia Iranica says \\"The Turkish speakers of Azerbaijan (q.v.) are mainly descended from the earlier Iranian speakers\\". The continued presence of pockets of Iranian speakers; Talysh and Caucasian Tats are present in the Republic of Azerbaijan. Caucasian origin Azerbaijani girl from Shusha in silk national garments. According to Encyclop√¶dia Britannica: There is evidence that, despite repeated invasions and migrations, aboriginal Caucasians may have been culturally assimilated, first by Ancient Iranian peoples and later by the Oghuz. Considerable information has been learned about the Caucasian Albanians including their language, history, early conversion to Christianity. The Udi language, still spoken in Azerbaijan, may be a remnant of the Albanians' language. Genetics Iranian Azerbaijanis have stronger genetic affinity with their immediate geographic neighbors than with populations from Central Asia. Genetic studies demonstrate that northern Azerbaijanis are more closely related to other Caucasian people like Georgians and Armenians than they are to Iranians or Turks. Research conducted by Maziar Ashrafian Bonab, et al. of the Department of Genetics at University of Cambridge showed that Azeris living in Iran are connected to the Persian (Iranian) people of Iran in terms of their FST (fixation index) value, their MRCA (most recent common ancestor), and their mtDNA genetic types, and that Azeris are distant from Anatolian Turks and European Turks . No close genetic relationship was observed between Azeris of Iran and the people of Turkey or Central Asians. According to the current results, present-day Kurds and Azeris of Iran seem to belong to a common genetic pool. Iranian Azerbaijanis are genetically more similar to northern Azerbaijanis and the neighboring Turkic population than they are to geographically distant Turkmen populations. However, it is also significant that the evidence of genetic admixture derived from Central Asians (specifically Haplogroup H12), notably the Turkmen, is higher for Azerbaijanis than that of their Georgian and Armenian neighbors. Iranian-speaking populations from Azerbaijan (the Talysh and Tats) are genetically closer to Azerbaijanis of the Republic than to other Iranian- speaking populations (Persian people and Kurds from Iran, Ossetians, and Tajiks). Some genetic studies support the view that the Azerbaijanis originate from a native population long resident in the area who adopted a Turkic language through a process of \\"elite dominance\\", i.e. a limited number of Turkic immigrants had a substantial cultural impact but left only weak patrilineal genetic traces.http://etd.lib.metu.edu.tr/upload/12607764/index.pdf The mtDNA subclade U7a4 peaks among the modern inhabitants of Azerbaijan (26%) and Azerbaijani inhabitants of northwestern Iran (16‚Äì22%), while occurring in the rest of Iran at frequencies from 2‚Äì16%. MtDNA analysis indicates that Persians, Anatolians and Caucasians are part of a larger West Eurasian group that is secondary to that of the Caucasus. While genetic analysis of mtDNA indicates that Caucasian populations are genetically closer to Europeans than to Near Easterners, Y-chromosome results indicate closer affinity to Near Eastern groups. Iranians have a relatively diverse range of Y-chromosome haplotypes. A population from central Iran (Isfahan) shows closer similarity in terms of haplogroup distributions to Caucasians and Azerbaijanis than to populations from southern or northern Iran. The range of haplogroups across the region may reflect historical genetic admixture, perhaps as a result of invasive male migrations. In a comparative study (2013) on the complete mitochondrial DNA diversity in Iranians has indicated that Iranian Azeris are more related to the people of Georgia, than they are to other Iranians, as well as to Armenians. However the same multidimensional scaling plot shows that Azeris from the Caucasus, despite their supposed common origin with Iranian Azeris, cluster closer with other Iranians (e.g. Persians, etc.) than they do with Iranian Azeris. Other studies support that present-day Iranian main genetic stock comes from the ancient autochthonous people and a genetic input from eastern people would be a minor one. Thus, Iranian Azeris have the closest genetic distance to Iranian Kurds and there is no significant difference between these two populations and other major ethnic groups of Iran. Demographics and society Azerbaijani- speaking regions Azerbaijanis from Alexandropol (Gyumri) The vast majority of Azerbaijanis live in the Republic of Azerbaijan and Iranian Azerbaijan. Between 8 and 18.5 million Azerbaijanis live in Iran, mainly in the northwestern provinces. Approximately 9.1 million Azerbaijanis are found in the Republic of Azerbaijan. A diaspora of over a million is spread throughout the rest of the world. According to Ethnologue, there are over 1 million speakers of the northern Azerbaijani dialect in southern Dagestan, Estonia, Georgia, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Russian proper, Turkmenistan, and Uzbekistan. No Azerbaijanis were recorded in the 2001 census in Armenia, where the Nagorno-Karabakh conflict resulted in population shifts. Other sources, such as national censuses, confirm the presence of Azerbaijanis throughout the other states of the former Soviet Union. In the Republic of Azerbaijan Azerbaijanis are by far the largest ethnic group in The Republic of Azerbaijan (over 90%), holding the second-largest community of ethnic Azerbaijanis after neighboring Iran. The literacy rate is very high, and is estimated at 99.5%. Azerbaijan began the twentieth century with institutions based upon those of Russia and the Soviet Union, with an official policy of atheism and strict state control over most aspects of society. Since independence, there is a secular system. Azerbaijan has benefited from the oil industry, but high levels of corruption have prevented greater prosperity for the population. Despite these problems, there is a financial rebirth in Azerbaijan as positive economic predictions and an active political opposition appear determined to improve the lives of average Azerbaijanis. In Iran Ashiks performance in Tabriz Supreme leader of Iran (Seyyed Ali Khamenei) is the highest-ranking official in Iran, and is Iranian Azeri on his father's side While population estimates in Azerbaijan are considered reliable due to regular censuses, the figures for Iran remain questionable. Since the early twentieth century, successive Iranian governments have avoided publishing statistics on ethnic groups. Unofficial population estimates of Azerbaijanis in Iran are around the 16% area put forth by the CIA and Library of Congress. An independent poll in 2009 placed the figure at around 20‚Äì22%. Nevertheless, regardless of the highest or lowest estimates or publications, Azerbaijanis in Iran comprise by far the second-largest ethnic group in the nation as well as by far the largest minority ethnic group. Furthermore, once again regardless of any estimate or publication, the number of Azerbaijanis in Iran by far outnumber the amount of Azerbaijanis in the neighboring Republic of Azerbaijan, and comprise the largest number of ethnic Azerbaijanis in the world. Azerbaijanis in Iran are mainly found in the northwest provinces: West Azerbaijan, East Azerbaijan, Ardabil, Zanjan, parts of Hamadan, Qazvin, and Markazi.

They are the largest ethnic groups after Persians in Tehran and the Tehran Province. Many Azerbaijanis have emigrated and resettled in large numbers in Khorasan, living beside linguistically related Khorasani Turks, especially in Mashhad. Generally, Azerbaijanis in Iran were regarded as \\"a well integrated linguistic minority\\" by academics prior to Iran's Islamic Revolution. Despite friction, Azerbaijanis in Iran came to be well represented at all levels of \\"political, military, and intellectual hierarchies, as well as the religious hierarchy\\". Resentment came with Pahlavi policies that suppressed the use of the Azerbaijani language in local government, schools, and the press. However, with the advent of the Iranian Revolution in 1979, emphasis shifted away from nationalism as the new government highlighted religion as the main unifying factor. Islamic theocratic institutions dominate nearly all aspects of society. The Azerbaijani language and its literature are banned in Iranian schools. There are signs of civil unrest due to the policies of the Iranian government in Iranian Azerbaijan and increased interaction with fellow Azerbaijanis in Azerbaijan and satellite broadcasts from Turkey and other Turkic countries have revived Azerbaijani nationalism. In May 2006, Iranian Azerbaijan witnessed riots over publication of a cartoon depicting a cockroach speaking Azerbaijani that many Azerbaijanis found offensive. The cartoon was drawn by Mana Neyestani, an Azeri, who was fired along with his editor as a result of the controversy. One of the major incidents that happened recently was Azeris protests in Iran (2015) started in November 2015, after children's television programme Fitileha aired on 6 November on state TV that ridiculed and mocked the accent and language of Azeris and included offensive jokes. As a result, hundreds of ethnic Azeris have protested a program on state TV that contained what they consider an ethnic slur. Demonstrations were held in Tabriz, Urmia, Ardabil, and Zanjan, as well as Tehran and Karaj. Police in Iran have clashed with protesting people, fired tear gas to disperse crowds, and many demonstrators were arrested. One of the protesters, Ali Akbar Murtaza, reportedly \\"died of injuries\\" in Urmia. There were also protests held in front of Iranian embassies in Istanbul and Baku. The head of the country's state broadcaster Islamic Republic of Iran Broadcasting (IRIB) Mohammad Sarafraz has apologized for airing the program, whose broadcast was later discontinued. Azerbaijanis are an intrinsic community of Iran, and their style of living closely resemble those of Persians: There is significant cross-border trade between Azerbaijan and Iran, and Azerbaijanis from Azerbaijan go into Iran to buy goods that are cheaper, but the relationship was tense until recently. However, relations have significantly improved since the Rouhani administration took office. Subgroups There are several Azerbaijani ethnic groups, each of which has particularities in the economy, culture, and everyday life. Some Azerbaijani ethnic groups continued in the last quarter of the 19th century. Major Azerbaijani ethnic groups: * Ayrums[2] * Afshars [3] [4] * Bayat [5] * Qaradaghis [2] [6] * Qizilbash [7] * Karapapak [8] * Padar tribe [2] [9] * Terekeme [10] [11] * Shahsevan [2] [12] [13] [14] * Tribes of Karadagh * Qajars [15] * Qashqai File:Ayrum from village of Gedamish of Ganja Uyezd.jpgAyrum from Azerbaijan.

End of the 19th century, Iran Diaspora Women Azeri female from Baku (1900 postcard) In Azerbaijan, women were granted the right to vote in 1917. Women have attained Western-style equality in major cities such as Baku, although in rural areas more reactionary views remain. Violence against women, including rape, is rarely reported, especially in rural areas, not unlike other parts of the former Soviet Union. In Azerbaijan, the veil was abandoned during the Soviet period. Women are under-represented in elective office but have attained high positions in parliament. An Azerbaijani woman is the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court in Azerbaijan, and two others are Justices of the Constitutional Court. In the 2010 election, women constituted 16% of all MPs (twenty seats in total) in the National Assembly of Azerbaijan. Abortion is available on demand in the Republic of Azerbaijan. The human rights ombudsman since 2002, Elmira S√ºleymanova, is a woman. In Iran, a groundswell of grassroots movements have sought gender equality since the 1980s. Protests in defiance of government bans are dispersed through violence, as on 12 June 2006 when female demonstrators in Haft Tir Square in Tehran were beaten. Past Iranian leaders, such as the reformer ex-president Mohammad Khatami promised women greater rights, but the Guardian Council of Iran opposes changes that they interpret as contrary to Islamic doctrine. In the 2004 legislative elections, nine women were elected to parliament (Majlis), eight of whom were conservatives. The social fate of Azerbaijani women largely mirrors that of other women in Iran.  Culture  In many respects, Azerbaijanis are Eurasian and bi-cultural. The Azerbaijanis of Azerbaijan Republic have absorbed Soviet and Eastern European influences, whereas Iranian Azeris have retained their culture which to a large extent is identical to the culture of other Iranian peoples including Persians and Kurds.\\"History of the East\\" (\\"Transcaucasia in 11th‚Äì15th centuries\\" in Rostislav Borisovich Rybakov (editor), History of the East. 6 volumes. v. 2. \\"East during the Middle Ages: Chapter V., 2002. ‚Äì . Modern Azerbaijani culture includes significant achievements in literature, art, music, and film. Language and literature The Azerbaijanis speak Azerbaijani, a Turkic language descended from the Western Oghuz Turkic language that became established in Azerbaijan in the 11th and 12th century CE. Early Oghuz was mainly an oral language, and the later compiled epics and heroic stories of Dede Korkut probably derive from an oral tradition. The first accepted Oghuz Turkic text goes back to the 15th century. The first written, classical Azerbaijani literature arose after the Mongol invasion. Some of the earliest Azerbaijani writings trace back to the poet Nasimi (died 1417) and then decades later Fuz√ªl√Æ (1483‚Äì1556). Ismail I, Shah of Safavid Iran wrote Azerbaijani poetry under the pen name Khat√¢'i. Modern Azerbaijani literature continued with a traditional emphasis upon humanism, as conveyed in the writings of Samad Vurgun, Shahriar, and many others. Azerbaijanis are generally bilingual, often fluent in either Russian (in Azerbaijan) or Persian (in Iran) in addition to their native Azerbaijani. As of 1996, around 38% of Azerbaijan's roughly 8,000,000 population spoke Russian fluently. An independent telephone survey in Iran in 2009 reported that 20% of respondents could understand Azerbaijani, the most spoken minority language in Iran, and all respondents could understand Persian. Religion The majority of Azerbaijanis are Twelver Shi'a Muslims. Religious minorities include Sunni Muslims (mainly Shafi'i just like other Muslims in the surrounding North Caucasus), Igor Dobayev.

An unknown number of Azerbaijanis in the Republic of Azerbaijan have no religious affiliation. Many describe themselves as Shia Muslims. There is a small number of Naqshbandi Sufis among Muslim Azerbaijanis. Christian Azerbaijanis number around 5,000 people in the Republic of Azerbaijan and consist mostly of recent converts. Some Azerbaijanis from rural regions retain pre-Islamic animist or Zoroastrian- influencedBarbara West. Encyclopedia of the Peoples of Asia and Oceania. Infobase Publishing, 2009, ; p. 72. beliefs, such as the sanctity of certain sites and the veneration of fire, certain trees and rocks. In Azerbaijan, traditions from other religions are often celebrated in addition to Islamic holidays, including Norouz and Christmas. After the fall of the Soviet Union, Azerbaijanis have increasingly returned to their Islamic heritage as recent reports indicate that many Azerbaijani youth are being drawn to Islam. Performing arts Azerbaijani singers Ell & Nikki won the 2011 Eurovision Song Contest. Azerbaijanis express themselves in a variety of artistic ways including dance, music, and film. Azerbaijani folk dances are ancient and similar to that of their neighbors in the Caucasus and Iran. The group dance is a common form found from southeastern Europe to the Caspian Sea. In the group dance the performers come together in a semi-circular or circular formation as, \\"The leader of these dances often executes special figures as well as signaling and changes in the foot patterns, movements, or direction in which the group is moving, often by gesturing with his or her hand, in which a kerchief is held.\\" Solitary dances are performed by both men and women and involve subtle hand motions in addition to sequenced steps. Lezginka, a dance shared by all Caucasus-derived or Caucasus-influenced ethnic groups, is also popular amongst Azerbaijanis. Azerbaijani musical tradition can be traced back to singing bards called Ashiqs, a vocation that survives. Modern Ashiqs play the saz (lute) and sing dastans (historical ballads). Other musical instruments include the tar (another type of lute), balaban (a wind instrument), kamancha (fiddle), and the dhol (drums). Azerbaijani classical music, called mugham, is often an emotional singing performance. Composers Uzeyir Hajibeyov, Gara Garayev and Fikret Amirov created a hybrid style that combines Western classical music with mugham. Other Azerbaijanis, notably Vagif and Aziza Mustafa Zadeh, mixed jazz with mugham. Some Azerbaijani musicians have received international acclaim, including Rashid Behbudov (who could sing in over eight languages), Muslim Magomayev (a pop star from the Soviet era), Googoosh, and more recently Sami Yusuf. After the 1979 revolution in Iran due to the clerical opposition to music in general, Azerbaijani music took a different course. According to Iranian singer Hossein Alizadeh, \\"Historically in Iran, music faced strong opposition from the religious establishment, forcing it to go underground.\\" Azerbaijani film and television are largely broadcast in Azerbaijan with limited outlets in Iran. Some Azerbaijanis have been prolific film-makers, such as Rustam Ibragimbekov, who wrote Burnt by the Sun, winner of the Grand Prize at the Cannes Film Festival and an Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film in 1994. Many Iranians have been prominent in the cinematic tradition of Iran, which has received critical praise since the 1980s. Sports Chess player Shakhriyar Mamedyarov. Ramil Guliyev at the finish of the 200-meter race at the 2009 European Athletics Junior Championships Sports have historically been an important part of Azerbaijani life. Horseback competitions were praised in the Book of Dede Korkut and by poets and writers such as Khaqani. Other ancient sports include wrestling, javelin throwing and fencing. The Soviet legacy has in modern times propelled some Azerbaijanis to become accomplished athletes at the Olympic level. The Azerbaijani government supports the country's athletic legacy and encourages youth participation. Football is popular in both The Republic of Azerbaijan and Iran. . Iranian athletes have particularly excelled in weight lifting, gymnastics, shooting, javelin throwing, karate, boxing, and wrestling. Weight lifters, such as Iran's Hossein Reza Zadeh, world super heavyweight-lifting record holder and two-time Olympic champion in 2000 and 2004, or Hadi Saei is a former Iranian Taekwondo athlete who became the most successful Iranian athlete in Olympic history and Nizami Pashayev, who won the European heavyweight title in 2006, have excelled at the international level. Chess is another popular pastime in the Republic of Azerbaijan. The country has produced many notable players, such as Teimour Radjabov, Vugar Gashimov and Shahriyar Mammadyarov, all three highly ranked internationally.

The innovative and relatively successful tactics used were later copied by the Germans. Born into the aristocracy to a father who was also a general, Brusilov trained as a cavalry officer, but by 1914 he realized that cavalry was obsolete in the new style of warfare because of its vulnerability to machine gun and artillery. Historians portray him as the only First World War Russian general capable of winning major battles. However, his heavy casualties seriously weakened the Russian army, which was unable to replace its losses. Despite his prominent role in the Imperial Russian Army, he ultimately joined with the Bolsheviks in the Russian Civil War and aided in the early organization of the Red Army Early life Brusilov was born in Tiflis (now Tbilisi, Georgia). His father Aleksi Nikolaevich Brusilov was Russian and his mother, Anna Luiza Niestojemska, was Polish. Three generations of Brusilovs had served as officers in the tsar's army, his grandfather fighting in the defense against Napoleon's invasion of 1812. His father rose to the rank of Lieutenant General before dying of tuberculosis in 1856. Brusilov's mother died shortly afterwards, and the young orphan was raised by relatives in Kutaisi. He was educated at home until the age of 14. He joined the Imperial Corps of Pages in Saint Petersburg in 1867. At the end of his first year, a tutor remarked of Brusilov, \\"his nature is brisk and even playful, but he is good, straight-forward and clean-living. Of high ability, but inclined to be lazy.\\" In 1872, on completion of the Corps' programme, he sought admission to the advanced class for top ranking students, but was unsuccessful, and instead was posted as an ensign (Praporshchik) to the 15th (Tver) Dragoon Regiment. Usually, graduates from the Corps of Pages sought admission to one of the Guards regiments, but the Tver Dragoons were at that time stationed near Kutaisi, so the posting suited Brusilov on the basis of being near his family and being less financially draining than service in the Guards. Russo-Turkish War Brusilov joined the Tver Dragoons in August 1872 and was given command of a troop, but it was not long before his aptitude resulted in the appointment as regimental adjutant. He was promoted to lieutenant in 1874. He served with distinction in the Russo-Turkish War, 1877‚Äì78, being mentioned in despatches on three occasions. His unit operated on the Southern Front in the Caucasus, and took part in the assault of the fortress of Ardagan (now Ardahan, Turkey), for which Brusilov was awarded the Order of Saint Stanislav, 3rd Class. Later in the war, he also received the Order of Saint Anne, 3rd Class, and was promoted to the rank of Stabskapit√§n. Towards the end of the war, he led successful attacks on Turkish positions around Kars, and his membership of the Order of Saint Stanislav was elevated to 2nd Class. The Cavalry Officer School In 1881, Brusilov became a student at the Cavalry Officer School in St Petersburg and two years later was appointed as a riding instructor there. He spent the next thirteen years in a succession of posts at the school ‚Äì Adjutant, Senior Teacher of Riding and Breaking Horses, Section Commander, Troop Commander, Squadron Commander and Assistant Chief of the School. On promotion to Major General in 1900, Brusilov was added to the list of Household Troops (officers who might be retained on official business by the Tsar). During this time, Brusilov married (1884), and the union produced a son in 1887. In 1902, as a Lieutenant General, he took command of the school, and under his leadership, the \\"Horse Academy\\" became an acknowledged centre of excellence in preparing staff officers for the cavalry. Brusilov published papers on the use of cavalry and visited France, Austria- Hungary and Germany to study riding tuition and stud management. Brusilov was appointed to command the 2nd Guards Cavalry Division in 1906, but this was not a happy posting for him. The Revolution of 1905 had left St Petersburg in turmoil, and after his wife's death, he sought a posting away from the Guards and the capital. In 1908, he was appointed to command the XIV Corps in the Warsaw Military District, where his tenure was notable for the improvements in combat training he implemented. He also remarried at this time, to Nadejda (\\"Hope\\") Jelihovski. Promoted to General of Cavalry in 1912, he became Deputy Commander-in-Chief of forces in the Warsaw Military District. The failures of the Russo-Japanese War had led to allegations that Generals from immigrant families, who made a significant fraction of the Russian Army's senior ranks, were less patriotic than those who traced their origins to within Russia's borders, and Brusilov would come into conflict with the Governor-General in Warsaw, Georgi Skalon, and other \\"Russian-German\\" generals in that District. Brusilov was soon seeking another post. In 1913, Brusilov was posted to command the XII Corps in the Kiev Military District, remarking on his departure, \\"I do not doubt, that my departure will produce a sensation in the troops of Warsaw region... Well! What's done is done, and I am glad, that I have escaped cesspool of Skalon's court atmosphere.\\" First World War 1914‚Äì1915 Grand Duke George Mikhailovich of Russia in 1915 In July 1914, with the Russian army expanding during mobilisation, Brusilov was promoted to command the 8th Army, part of the Southwest Front operating in Galicia. The 8th Army crushed the Austro-Hungarian forces before it, and rapidly advanced nearly . Reverses elsewhere along the Front, including the great defeat at Tannenberg, forced the 8th Army to retire in conformance with the general Russian withdrawal. For his victories, Brusilov was awarded the Order of Saint George 4th, and then 3rd Class. By a quirk of fate, several future White Army commanders held senior posts in 8th Army at this time‚ÄîBrusilov's Quartermaster general was Anton Denikin, while Alexey Kaledin commanded the 12th Cavalry Division and Lavr Kornilov was in command of 48th Infantry Division. In the early part of 1915, Brusilov again advanced, penetrating the Carpathian passes and entering the Hungarian plain. At this time, Nikolai II visited the 8th Army and Brusilov was promoted to the rank of General-Adjutant (in the Imperial Russian Army this was a \\"four-star\\" General rank). Once again, fortunes on other fronts would determine his actions, and the Austrian-German breakthrough at Gorlice-Tarn√≥w forced Brusilov to conform to the general retirement. By September, the 8th Army had withdrawn to the Tarnopol region. In October 1915, Brusilov wanted to deport 20,000 German civilians from Volhynia. With Stavka Chief of Staff General Mikhail Alekseyev's permission, Brusilov carried out the operation. The Brusilov Offensive thumb On 29 March 1916, Brusilov was given command of Southwest Front and managed to secure a certain degree of freedom of action. Previous Russian offensives demonstrated a tendency to assault smaller and smaller sections of the front with increasing density of artillery and manpower to achieve a breakthrough. The narrow frontage of these attacks made counterattacks straightforward for German forces, and this approach met with repeated failure for the Russians. Brusilov decided to distribute his attack over the entirety of Southwest Front. He hoped to disorganise the enemy over such a large area that some point would fatally give way. He decided not to waste resources by saturation bombardment of worthless areas, but to use interdiction fire against command posts, road networks, and other critically important targets to degrade German command and control over the whole front. The noted German artillery commander, Georg Bruchm√ºller, having served opposite Brusilov's Front at this time, would learn from and adapt these tactics when planning the preparatory bombardment for Operation Michael on the Western Front in 1918. Brusilov was not even concerned with securing a tremendous local advantage in manpower, permitting Divisions under his command to be transferred to other Fronts (so long as they attacked in support of his offensive). Brusilov's new techniques were, by First World War standards, highly successful and over the next 3 months, Southwest Front advanced an average of more than 30 kilometres along a front of more than , taking 400,000 Austro-Hungarian prisoners in the process. However, the planned supporting attack from West Front (the Army group to Brusilov's north) was not delivered, and Germany was able to transfer 17 divisions from France and Belgium to halt the Russian advance. Brusilov was awarded the Sword of Saint George with Diamonds for his greatest victory, one of only 8 Russian commanders to receive this award during the First World War. From 27 June to 3 July 1916, Brusilov carried out, on his own initiative, the deportation of 13,000 German civilians from the Volhynian areas that had been conquered during the offensive. 1917 and Revolution With the onset of revolution in Russia, Brusilov argued for the Tsar's abdication. When approached by Stavka for his opinion on the need for the abdication he replied, \\"... For the moment the only thing that matters is to stabilise our position to allow the continuation of the war with the external enemy... to abdicate in favour of Grand Duke Mikhail and a council of regents... It is necessary to hurry, the faster to extinguish the flames [of revolution], otherwise we face innumerable catastrophic consequences.\\" That same year in May, Brusilov was appointed Commander in Chief of the Russian Army. Throughout this period, Brusilov proved sympathetic to revolutionary aspirations, though his primary concern was that the war needed to be won first. In particular, he asserted that until peace was achieved, the full authority of the central government must be respected and that the army should maintain the full rigour of its disciplinary code. In a telegram to the Minister of War, Alexander Kerensky, he wrote, \\"... only the application of capital punishment will stop the decomposition of army and will save freedom and our homeland\\". This politically unpopular stand, together with the failure of the Kerensky Offensive in July 1917, led to Brusilov's replacement as Commander in Chief by his former deputy, Lavr Kornilov. Brusilov moved to Moscow and remained there at the disposal of the Provisional Government. He gave an excellent praising to T. G.

When fighting broke out in Moscow following the October Revolution, he was severely wounded in the foot by a fragment of a shell that hit his bathroom.  Soviet Russia  Brusilov's modest grave near the 500-year-old katholikon of the Novodevichy Convent (in the background) Conflicting loyalties tore Brusilov in the Revolution and the Civil War that followed. His former soldiers were largely serving in the newly formed Red Army, and he concurred with the need for radical change, but as a conservative, patriot and monarchist his values were more in tune with those of the White faction. On 30 May 1920, during the Polish Eastern offensive of the Polish-Soviet War Brusilov published in Pravda an appeal entitled \\"To All Former Officers, Wherever They Might Be\\", encouraging them to forgive past grievances and to join the Red Army. Brusilov considered it as a patriotic duty of all Russian officers to join hands with the Bolshevik government, which in his opinion was defending Russia against foreign invaders. On 12 September 1920 Kalinin, Lenin, Trotsky, Kamenev and Brusilov signed an appeal \\"To all officers of the army of Baron Wrangel\\", in which they called on white officers to go over to the side of Soviet Russia, accusing Wrangel of acting in the interests of the Polish nobility and the Anglo-French capitalists, who also use the Wrangel army to enslave the Russian people, as like as Czechoslovak corps and \\"black- skinned divisions\\".historyrussia.orgmagister.msk.ru Initially, Brusilov served on a special commission to determine the size and structure of the Red Army. Later, he led cavalry recruit training and became Inspector of Cavalry. He retired in 1924 but continued to carry out commissions for the Revolutionary Military Council. Aged seventy upon his retirement, he lived in his shared apartment with his sickly wife and another couple. He died in Moscow from congestive heart failure, and was given an honourable state funeral, buried in the Novodevichy Convent, by representatives from the 'new Russia' (the Bolsheviks), and the 'old Russia' (the clergy, the middle and upper class). His second wife Nadezhda Brusilova-Zhelikhova (1864‚Äì1938) is buried in the Orthodox section of the Ol≈°any Cemetery in Prague, along with a number of other members of the Russian emigration.  Legacy  His war memoirs were translated into English and published in 1930 as A Soldier's Notebook, 1914‚Äì1918. Following the October Revolution, he served the Bolsheviks and joined the Red Army. Many pro-tsarist historians avoided praising or even mentioning his historical role, because of his role in the Red Army. Assessment According to the assessment of British Field Marshal Bernard Montgomery, Brusilov was one of the seven outstanding fighting commanders of World War I, the others being Falkenhayn (later replaced by Hindenburg), Ludendorff, Mustafa Kemal, Plumer, Monash and Allenby.A Concise History of Warfare by Field-Marshal Viscount Montgomery of Alamein (1968), p. 306.

He is known for his involvement in the American luxury casino and hotel industry. Early in his career he oversaw the construction and operation of several notable Las Vegas and Atlantic City hotels, including the Golden Nugget, the Golden Nugget Atlantic City, The Mirage, Treasure Island, the Bellagio, and Beau Rivage in Mississippi, and he played a pivotal role in the resurgence and expansion of the Las Vegas Strip in the 1990s. In 2000, Wynn sold his company, Mirage Resorts, to MGM Grand Inc., resulting in the formation of MGM Mirage (now MGM Resorts International). Wynn later took his company Wynn Resorts public in an initial public offering and was Wynn Resorts' CEO and Chairman of the Board until February 6, 2018, when he announced his resignation. He is a prominent donor to the Republican Party, and was the finance chair of the Republican National Committee from January 2017 to January 2018, when he resigned amid sexual misconduct allegations. Through Wynn Resorts, he has overseen the construction and development of several luxury resorts, opening Wynn Las Vegas in 2005, Wynn Macau in 2006, Encore Las Vegas in 2008, Encore at Wynn Macau in 2010 and Wynn Palace in Macau in 2016, and Wynn Everett near Boston which opened in June 2019 under the name Encore Boston Harbor. In 2006, Wynn was inducted into the American Gaming Association Hall of Fame. As of September 2015, Wynn's net worth was estimated by Forbes at $2.4 billion, making him the 279th wealthiest American. Steve Wynn collects fine art, including pieces by artists such as Picasso and Claude Monet. On February 6, 2018, Wynn stepped down as CEO of Wynn Resorts amid accusations of sexual misconduct including harassment, assault, and coercion. Wynn has denied the allegations. Early life and education Steve Wynn was born Stephen Alan Weinberg in New Haven, Connecticut on January 27, 1942. His father, Michael, who owned a chain of bingo parlors in the eastern United States, changed the family's last name in 1946 from \\"Weinberg\\" to \\"Wynn\\" when Steve was 4 years old \\"to avoid anti- Jewish discrimination\\". Wynn was raised in Utica, New York, and graduated from The Manlius School, a private boys' school east of Syracuse, New York, in 1959. Steve Wynn received his Bachelor of Arts in English literature from the University of Pennsylvania, where he was a member of the Sigma Alpha Mu fraternity. Shortly before Wynn's graduation in March 1963, his father died during heart surgery, leaving $350,000 in gambling debts. Wynn relinquished a position at Yale Law School to take charge of his family's bingo parlor in Waysons Corner, Maryland. Career Frontier and the Golden Nugget (1967‚Äì1989) In 1967, Wynn and his family moved to Las Vegas where he purchased a small stake in the Frontier Hotel and Casino. That year he met E. Parry Thomas, the president of the Bank of Las Vegas, which was the only bank at the time willing to extend loans to Las Vegas casinos, and Thomas helped finance several of Wynn's early land deals. Starting in 1968, Wynn also spent four years operating a wine and liquor importing company he had purchased. In 1971, Wynn bought a controlling interest in the Golden Nugget Las Vegas, one of the oldest casinos in the city. His company stake increased so that, in 1973, he became the majority shareholder, and the youngest casino owner in Las Vegas. In 1977 he opened the Golden Nugget's first hotel tower, followed by several others. Frank Sinatra was a periodic headliner at the Golden Nugget, and Wynn has since maintained a relationship with the Sinatra family, even naming a restaurant at Encore \\"Sinatra\\". In 1980, Wynn began construction on the Golden Nugget Atlantic City in Atlantic City, New Jersey. It was Atlantic City's first and only \\"locals casino\\" and the city's sixth casino after the city legalized gambling in 1976. Joel Bergman, who designed Wynn's other resorts, designed the Golden Nugget. Though at its opening it was the second smallest casino in the city, by 1983 it was the city's top earning casino. Wynn sold the Atlantic City Golden Nugget in 1987 for $440 million. The Mirage and Treasure Island (1989‚Äì1997) Wynn's first major Las Vegas Strip casino was The Mirage. Wynn's first major casino on the Las Vegas Strip was The Mirage, which opened on November 22, 1989. It was the first time Wynn was involved with the design and construction of a casino, and he financed the $630 million project largely with high-yield bonds issued by Michael Milken. Its construction is also considered noteworthy in that The Mirage was the first casino to use security cameras full-time on all table games.Arnold M. Knightly (February 25, 2007), Blink and you'll miss him, Las Vegas Review- Journal, Page 1E. The hotel became the main venue for the Siegfried & Roy show in 1990, and in 1993 the hotel hosted the Cirque du Soleil show Nouvelle Exp√©rience. Wynn's next project, Treasure Island Hotel and Casino, opened in the Mirage's old parking lot on October 27, 1993, at an overall cost of $450 million. The establishment was the home of the first permanent Cirque du Soleil show in Las Vegas. In 1995, Wynn's company proposed to build the Le Jardin hotel-casino in the marina area if the state of New Jersey built a road that connected to the hotel-casino. The company had also agreed to allow Circus Circus Enterprises and Boyd Gaming to build casinos on the site, but later reneged on the agreement. While the road, called the Atlantic City- Brigantine Connector, was eventually built, Le Jardin was cancelled after the company was acquired in 2000 by MGM Grand Inc., which later built the Borgata, in a joint venture with Boyd Gaming, on the site.When Atlantic City projects had to be big, so were the ideas ... and the failures The Press of Atlantic City May 14, 2010 Mirage Reshuffles Deal in Mega-Resort Plan Ocala Star-Banner January 21, 1998 Bellagio and Beau Rivage debuts (1998‚Äì1999) Wynn's company Mirage Resorts oversaw the construction of the Bellagio, which at the time was the most expensive hotel in the world. Like Wynn's previous resorts, the Bellagio features an extensive water show on the Strip. On October 15, 1998, Wynn opened the even more opulent Bellagio, a $1.6 billion resort considered among the world's most spectacular hotels. The architect was Jon Jerde of The Jerde Partnerships, and construction was handled by Wynn's company Mirage Resorts, Inc. When built, the Bellagio was the most expensive hotel in the world. In front of the hotel are the Fountains of Bellagio‚Äîshooting fountains choreographed to music that \\"dance\\" on the hotel's 8.5 acre man-made lake‚Äîwhich are now considered Las Vegas landmarks. The Bellagio is credited with starting a new spree of luxurious developments in Las Vegas. Among these developments include The Venetian, Mandalay Bay, and Paris Las Vegas. Wynn brought Mirage Resorts' style to Biloxi, Mississippi in 1999, where he oversaw development of the 1,835-room Beau Rivage. Themed to blend Mediterranean beauty with Southern hospitality, the resort was part of a building boom that established Biloxi as a regional tourism center along the Mississippi Gulf Coast. Beau Rivage was originally the name Wynn wanted to give the Bellagio, though he had decided on Bellagio after vacationing in the Italian region of the same name. Beau Rivage opened as the largest hotel- casino to be built outside Nevada. The casino was initially located on a series of floating barges, as local law confined all casinos to mobile marine vessels at the time. The hotel, restaurants, and associated facilities were constructed on land. Wynn Las Vegas and Macau (2000‚Äì2007) Wynn Las Vegas Mirage Resorts was sold to MGM Grand Inc. for $6.6 billion ($21 per share) in June 2000 to form MGM Mirage. Five weeks before the deal was closed (April 27, 2000) Wynn purchased the Desert Inn for $270 million. He sold the Inn later that year. Wynn took Wynn Resorts Limited public in 2002. Wynn became a billionaire in 2004, when his net worth doubled to $1.3 billion.My Way Finance On April 28, 2005 he opened his most expensive resort at the time, the Wynn Las Vegas, on the site of the former Desert Inn. Built at a cost of $2.7 billion, it was the largest privately funded construction project in the nation as of 2005. Wynn successfully bid for one of three gaming concessions opened for tender in Macau.Wiseman, Paul. (January 22, 2007) Macau leads Las Vegas in gambling ‚Äì. Usatoday.com. This property, known as Wynn Macau, opened on September 5, 2006. In 2008, Wynn Macau became the fifth Asian hotel to receive the Mobil Five-Star award. Encore hotels and other projects (2008‚Äì2018) The Encore Hotel in Las Vegas, showing the shops inside the buildings. Encore Las Vegas (pictured) was opened in 2008 on the same property as Wynn Las Vegas, though they are separate hotels. In the summer of 2008, hiring began for Encore Las Vegas, the newest in Wynn's collection of resorts. The tower of Encore is modeled after the Wynn Las Vegas tower, and they share the same \\"property\\" though they are separate hotels. After having started construction in 2006, the overall cost of the project equalled $2.3 billion. Encore opened on December 22, 2008. As of December 31, 2012, Wynn and Encore Las Vegas employed approximately 9,000 full-time employees. Encore at Wynn Macau, an expansion of Wynn Macau similar to the expansion of the Las Vegas property, opened on April 21, 2010. In 2016, Wynn opened the Wynn Palace in the Cotai Strip in the People's Republic of China. It was previously approved by the Macau government in 2012. In September 2014, Wynn was awarded the license to build the Wynn Boston Harbor casino in the eastern Massachusetts city of Everett, near downtown Boston. In 2018, the Wall Street Journal reported that dozens of people recounted a pattern of sexual misconduct by Wynn, including several former employees. On February 6, 2018, Wynn stepped down as CEO of Wynn Resorts, though he denied all allegations.https://www.nytimes.com/2018/05/10/business/steve-wynn-elaine- wynn.html Political activities In the past, Wynn has financially supported both the Democratic and the Republican Party, for example contributing $200,000 to the Republican Governors Association in 2013. In 2011 he spoke in support of Nevada Senator Harry Reid.Schwartz, Ian. (July 18, 2011) Wynn Slams Obama On Business. RealClearPolitics. Though he supported Barack Obama in the 2008 election, in 2011 he expressed disappointment with Obama's policies relating to economic issues. In December 2010, Prince Albert II of Monaco bestowed Monegasque citizenship to Wynn, an unusual act since Wynn did not meet the prerequisites. According to the Las Vegas Sun, Wynn was given the citizenship when he agreed to serve as outside director in Monaco QD International Hotels and Resorts Management, which is a joint venture between the governments of Monaco and Qatar. The organization buys and manages hotels in Europe, the Middle East and North America. Between 2012 and 2018, Wynn contributed more than $2.5 million to the Republican Governors Association and also donated $411,000 to the National Republican Senatorial Committee, $248,000 to the Republican National Committee, and $100,000 to the National Republican Congressional Committee.Alex Isenstadt, RNC finance chair Steve Wynn resigns after sexual harassment allegations, Politico (January 27, 2018).

Art collection Wynn is a collector of fine art, and has bought numerous works by artists such as Paul C√©zanne, Paul Gauguin, Vincent van Gogh, Julian Hatton, √âdouard Manet, Henri Matisse, Pablo Picasso, Andy Warhol, and Johannes Vermeer. Close to the Wizard of Oz by Julian Hatton. Wynn is known for amassing a large collection of fine art, often placing the pieces in his various casinos and hotels. In 2004, Wynn purchased Vermeer's A Young Woman Seated at the Virginals at a Sotheby's auction for $30 million. With the purchase, he became the first art collector to purchase a Vermeer painting in over 80 years. Wynn later sold the painting to the Leiden Collection owned by Thomas Kaplan for the same price. In 2006, Wynn acquired J. M. W. Turner's Giudecca, La Donna Della Salute and San Giorgio for $35.8 million via an anonymous telephone auction. Although Wynn did not officially identify himself as the buyer, his identity was confirmed by two people acquainted with the transaction. Wynn purchased the painting from the St. Francis of Assisi Foundation, a White Plains-based nonprofit organization that supports Capuchin priests on their missionary trips. Steve Wynn's private art collection with specific commentary about his paintings by Claude Monet are highlighted in the 2008 film Monet's PalateLas Vegas Sun Explore passion (March 24, 2008) with Meryl Streep and distributed by American Public Television. Many of the collection's pieces were on display at the Bellagio. The collection was on display at the Nevada Museum of Art in Reno while the Wynn Las Vegas was being constructed and was installed in the resort shortly before it was opened. The Wynn Las Vegas gallery, which had charged an entrance fee, closed shortly after the start of 2006. The artwork from the former gallery was then scattered around the resort. In 2009, he spent $33.2 million on Rembrandt's Man with His Arms Akimbo, the auction record for the artist. Under the direction of Steve Wynn, Wynn Resorts acquired Jeff Koons's Tulips at auction in November 2012 for approximately $33.6 million. In May 2014, Wynn acquired Popeye from the same artist for over $2 million, putting the work on display at Wynn Las Vegas. In February 2020, Wynn bought two Picasso paintings from Donald Marron's collection for $105 million‚ÄîWoman with Beret and Collar and Jacqueline. Le R√™ve Also in the collection is Le R√™ve, the Picasso portrait that was the working name of Wynn's resort project. Wynn purchased the painting from an anonymous collector in a private sale in 2001. In 2006, he reportedly was to sell it to Steven A. Cohen for $139 million, which would at that time have been the highest price paid for any piece of art. However, he put his elbow through the canvas while showing it to a group of guests. This canceled the sale, and after a $90,000 repair, the painting was estimated to be worth $85 million. Wynn sued his insurance company over the $54 million difference with the virtual selling price. The case was settled out of court in April 2007. In 2013, Wynn sold Le R√™ve to Steven A. Cohen for $155 million.

The kidnappers were apprehended when one attempted to buy a Ferrari in Newport Beach, California, with cash. Kevyn was found unharmed several hours later. On April 30, 2011, Wynn married Andrea Danenza Hissom in a ceremony at the Wynn Las Vegas.

Wynn was appointed to the Board of Trustees of the John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts by President George W. Bush on October 30, 2006.Personnel Announcement. Georgewbush-whitehouse.archives.gov (October 30, 2006). In November 2006, Wynn was inducted into the American Gaming Association Hall of Fame. He also received an honorary doctorate degree from the University of Pennsylvania in 2006, which was rescinded following Wynn's sexual misconduct allegations in 2018. He has also received honorary doctoral degrees from the University of Nevada, Las Vegas; Sierra Nevada College; The Culinary Institute of America; and Johnson & Wales University in Providence, Rhode Island. Forbes magazine named him a \\"Captain of Capitalism\\" in 2007. Wynn was named to Institutional Investor's Best CEOs list in the All-America Executive Team Survey from 2008 through 2011.The All-America Executive Team Best CEOs , InstitutionalInvestor.com In March 2011, Barron's named Steve Wynn one of the 30 \\"World's Best CEOs.\\"Barron's Staff, , Barron's, Mar. 26, 2011 In November 2014, Wynn ranked 17th on Harvard Business Review's list of 100 best- performing CEOs in the world. Legal issues In 1991, Dennis Gomes, president of Wynn's Golden Nugget, left his position to join Donald Trump's Trump Taj Mahal in Atlantic City, New Jersey, receiving a $1 million bonus in lieu of equity. Wynn filed suit against Trump and Gomes for breach of contract, as Gomes was contracted to work at the Nugget until 1992. Gomes settled in 1994. Also in 1991, Gomes alleged in a countersuit that Wynn used harsh language against Gomes, but Wynn's representatives denied the allegations. In 1997, Wynn sued Barricade Books for defamation over the catalog description of an unauthorized biography Running Scared by John L. Smith. Wynn was initially awarded $3.2 million, forcing Barricade into bankruptcy. In 2001 the ruling was thrown out by the Supreme Court of Nevada. Retrial was scheduled for 2004. The issue was settled between Wynn and New York publisher Lyle Stuart in a confidential agreement, and the case dismissed. In a legal battle over an attempt by Wynn-controlled Mirage to build a casino in Atlantic City, Donald Trump claimed in a lawsuit that Wynn used a private investigator as a double agent to secretly record conversations with Trump. The investigator, Louis Rodriguez, a former Los Angeles police officer and investigator for the IRS, claimed he had a change of heart because he felt that Trump used his efforts \\"in an immoral and unethical manner to cause financial harm\\" to Wynn and Mirage and thus turned \\"whistleblower.\\" Wynn settled the lawsuit in 2000 and befriended Trump, who attended Wynn's wedding in 2011. Beginning in 2008, Wynn engaged in a dispute with Girls Gone Wild producer Joe Francis. In 2011, a Nevada district attorney prosecuted Francis for writing a bad check to cover a $2 million gambling debt owed to Wynn, but the judge dismissed the case for falling outside the six-month statute of limitations. Wynn collected the debt in a separate civil case. In response to the collection, Francis stated that Wynn threatened to kill him, prompting Wynn to file suit for defamation against Francis. In February 2012, Clark County, Nevada, judge Mark Denton ruled that Francis damaged the reputation of Wynn and awarded Wynn $7.5 million in damages. In September 2012, after Francis repeated the alleged threat on television and Wynn added a second defamation claim, a jury awarded Wynn $40 million in compensatory and punitive damages. The judgment was amended to $19 million, after Wynn failed to prove that Francis could pay the original amount. In January 2012, Wynn's former business partner Kazuo Okada filed suit to gain access to company documents related to Wynn's pledge to donate $135 million to the University of Macau Development Foundation. Wynn later accused Okada's company, Aruze, of violating the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, leading to a Department of Justice probe into Aruze's gifts of hotel rooms and other expenses to Philippine, South Korean, and Japanese gaming officials. In a March 2013 U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) filing, Wynn noted that while the Okada dispute could cut into Wynn's profits, beyond an \\"informal\\" SEC inquiry into the Macau donation, there was no formal investigation underway. In July 2013, the SEC announced that its investigation into the Macau donations was concluded and it would not pursue any enforcement action against Wynn or Wynn Resorts. In 2014, Wynn sued hedge fund manager James Chanos for slander after Chanos, at a Berkeley event, allegedly said Wynn violated the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act. Wynn's lawsuit was dismissed, with U.S. District Judge William Orrick III ruling that Chanos's remark was constitutionally protected speech.Andrew Chung, U.S. judge throws out slander lawsuit filed by casino mogul Wynn, Reuters (December 17, 2014). Wynn was also ordered to pay Chanos' legal fees.Linette Lopez, \\"Steve Wynn just lost his slander appeal against Jim Chanos\\", Business Insider (March 28, 2017). Wynn's subsequent appeal was rejected by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit. Wynn has sought to weaken Nevada's anti-strategic lawsuit against public participation (SLAPP) legislation.John L. Smith, Wynn has much to gain by a weakened anti-SLAPP law, Las Vegas Review-Journal (April 21, 2015). He has publicly clashed with Yelp over the issue.Maxwell Tani, Yelp attacks casino mogul Steve Wynn for supporting legislation that makes it easy to sue people over bad reviews, Business Insider (May 20, 2015). Wynn has dealt with several legal issues related to sexual misconduct allegations that were covered by The Wall Street Journal in 2018. One accusation came from a manicurist whom Wynn later paid a $7.5 million settlement. In February 2018, Nevada regulators fined Wynn's company $20 million for failing to respond to sexual misconduct claims.. In April 2019, the Massachusetts Gaming Commission fined Wynn Resorts $35 million due to the gaming authority's findings that former company executives covered up sexual misconduct allegations against Steve Wynn Angelica Limcaco, a former salon manager at Wynn Las Vegas, filed a federal lawsuit in 2018 against Wynn Resorts and Steve Wynn claiming that she was fired, blacklisted and intimidated into silence after she elevated her concerns in 2006 to then- president of Wynn Las Vegas, Andrew Pascal. The case was appealed to the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals after Judge Miranda Du ruled in favor of Wynn Las Vegas, holding that the claim was not made within the statute of limitations and Angelica Limcaco's attorney, Jordan Matthews, argued that the time limits should not apply because Limcaco feared for her personal safety. Jordan Matthews filed a petition with the Ninth Circuit in March 2020 questioning the Nevada District Court's selection of Elayna Youchah as a magistrate judge. Elayna Youchah served as Wynn Las Vegas' lead counsel in the Limcaco case and Youchah was apparently selected just before Judge Du dismissed Limcaco's case. Matthews argued there was no disclosure about this apparent conflict of interest. In May 2020, Judges William A. Fletcher, Jay S. Bybee and Paul J. Watford, heard oral argument on the Limcaco case in San Francisco, California. Jordan Matthews argued that that the lower court's decision should be reversed. The Massachusetts Gaming Commission Report confirmed that Wynn Las Vegas and Steve Wynn took steps to remove a rape victim immediately after Limcaco reported the rape and Limcaco was then threatened by her superior, Doreen Whennen, to remain silent. In March 2018, lawyer Lisa Bloom announced that she would represent a former dancer in a sexual misconduct suit against Wynn. In response, Wynn filed a defamation lawsuit against Bloom, pointing out that he is legally blind and could not \\"leer\\" at dancers. In April 2018, Wynn filed a defamation lawsuit against his former employee Jorgen Nielsen after he made negative comments about Wynn's alleged sexual misconduct to The Wall Street Journal and ABC news. In October 2019, Neilsen filed a lawsuit against Wynn Resorts, its CEO, Matthew Maddox, its former general counsel, Kim Sinatra, and Wynn Resorts former head of security, James Stern, for allegedly spying on him. In April 2019, James Stern, a former FBI agent and the former executive vice president of corporate security for Wynn Resorts, resigned after testifying before the Massachusetts Gaming Commission to spying on Elaine Wynn and other employees. According to court documents filed by Wynn's lawyers in 2018, Wynn had reached a settlement in 2006 with another former Wynn employee who had accused him of sexual misconduct. The settlement included a non-disclosure agreement. After the Wall Street Journal article came out, the woman announced to Wynn's lawyer that she intended to speak publicly about the settlement, and the lawyer reported her to the FBI for extortion; no charges were filed. In 2020, a Nevada judge ruled that a woman defamed Wynn when she reported in 2018 that he had raped her in the 1970s, noting that her testimony lacked veracity. In July 2020, a federal judge dismissed a lawsuit without prejudice against Wynn Resorts, Ltd., which was filed by nine anonymous employees. The federal judge said the women could not justify why it was necessary to file the lawsuit anonymously. Since Judge James C. Mahan dismissed the case without prejudice, the lawsuit can be refiled.

The guard tone is sent by the answering modem after it has sent the answer tone. It is a single continuous tone with a frequency of either 1800 Hz or 550 Hz, sent at a level of -6dB or -3dB, respectively, below the level of the transmitted data signal power. It is used with V.22 and V.22bis modulation modes to prevent the high-band data signal from interfering with the operation of billing apparatus in certain countries where in-band signalling was commonplace in the 20th century. 1800 Hz is used in the UK and some Commonwealth countries, while 550 Hz is used in some Scandinavian countries. Guard tones are not used in North America. The guard tone is controlled by the AT command of the Hayes command set. North American Bell 103-style modems (300 bit/s) were incompatible with UK in-band signalling (the modem tones would disconnect the call) unless a guard tone is provided.

It provides assistance to deprived, excluded and vulnerable children in 30 countries, including the United States. Mission ChildFund provides services to children, mostly funded by individual contributors in the form of monthly child sponsorships. In addition, ChildFund says it receives grants and donations that support vocational training, literacy training, food distribution, educational programs, early childhood development, health and immunization programs, nutritional programs, water and sanitation development, and emergency relief in both man-made and natural disasters. The organization is known for its TV commercials on major networks in the United States.Evidence that CFI sponsors many TV commercials (and discussion) ‚Äì Link 2 The commercials include photographs and videos of impoverished children in developing countries, and often feature actor Alan Sader. A previous long- running series of advertisements had featured actress Sally Struthers as spokeswoman, who around the same time also did commercials for International Correspondence Schools. It was also known for its Christmas commercials that featured the song \\"Happy Xmas (War Is Over)\\". History ChildFund was founded on October 6, 1938, as China's Children Fund by Presbyterian minister J. Calvitt Clarke to aid Chinese children displaced by the Second Sino- Japanese War. As the mission expanded to other countries, the name was changed on February 6, 1951 to Christian Children's Fund. In June 2002, Christian Children's Fund and 11 other international child sponsorship organizations founded a worldwide network, ChildFund Alliance. The ChildFund Alliance comprises twelve organizations that partner to improve the lives of children and their families in 55 countries. Alliance members meet organizational standards of governance, fundraising and fiscal responsibility. The partnership fosters opportunities for pooled resources and collaborative activities to reach more children in need. The ChildFund Alliance includes the following members: * Barnfonden (Sweden) * ChildFund Australia * ChildFund Ireland * ChildFund Japan * ChildFund New Zealand * ChildFund International (USA, Christian Children's Fund) * Christian Children's Fund of Canada * ChildFund Deutschland * ChildFund Korea (Ï¥àÎ°ùÏö∞ÏÇ∞ Ïñ¥Î¶∞Ïù¥Ïû¨Îã®) * EDUCO (Spain) * Un Enfant Par La Main (France) On July 1, 2009, Christian Children's Fund changed its name to ChildFund International. The name change took into consideration donor confusion and followed reports that CCF was no longer functioning as a Christian organization. Child sponsorship model Individual sponsors contribute funds on a monthly basis. Sponsor funds are combined to benefit entire communities. Each country's office is free to develop its own programs based on the needs of local communities, but common programs include day care programs, medical care, clean water, and nutrition education. ChildFund encourages sponsors to correspond with children through letters and photographs. Sponsored children or their family members also can send letters to sponsors. The organization recently introduced an electronic correspondence program. The letters are translated by representatives of the organization. Sponsors also receive annual progress reports and updated photographs of their sponsored children. Sponsors can travel to meet their sponsored children but must undergo a background check. Efficiency and financials Charity Navigator gives ChildFund a rating of three out of four stars. For 2018, ChildFund allocated its $202,637,391 in public support & revenue as follows: *Program expenses: 79.1% *Administrative expenses: 9.3% *Fundraising expenses: 11.7% Charity Navigator lists ChildFund as having $98,534,640 in assets. ChildFund's president, Anne Lynam Goddard, received $347,531 in compensation in FY 2018. Publications ChildFund releases a number of publications every quarter to six months, including ChildWorld magazine, ChildWire e-newsletter, and an annual report. The newsletter is sent to subscribers every month via e-mail. Issues In 2008, CCF was reported to have turned down a $17,398 donation from GenCon Live Game Auction, which took place in August at Gen Con, a role-playing and board games convention. The donation was made in honor of Gary Gygax, who died in 2008, and who was a frequent donor to CCF. Some individuals within the gaming community expressed disappointment about the decision; prominent author and game designer Rich Burlew, for example, called it \\"insulting,\\" and the response by gamers led both the CCF and Gen Con to issue official statements explaining what had happened. When questioned, the CCF replied that reasons for the rejection included \\"the possible misinterpretation of CCF‚Äôs role in regard to the event. ... The information presented to us gave the appearance that CCF (the organization) was an endorser or supporter of the event instead of a beneficiary.\\"Reply from the Christian Children's Fund over the Gygax Auction, Pulling Weeds out of Potholes (blog), retrieved on November 3, 2008 A later statement issued by a representative of Gen Con explained that Gen Con had contacted CCF before the convention was held in August, and asked permission to use CCF promotional materials, which they believed CCF declined to provide because of Gen Con's association with the role-playing game Dungeons & Dragons; after that, according to the statement, Gen Con chose to support a different charity in 2008 before becoming clear on the charity's actual position.

Urinals are often provided in public toilets for male users in Western countries (less so in Muslim countries). They are usually used in a standing position. Urinals can be with manual flushing, automatic flushing, or without flushing, as is the case for waterless urinals. They can be arranged as single sanitary fixtures (with or without privacy walls) or in a trough design without privacy walls. Urinals designed for females (\\"female urinals\\") also exist but are rare. It is possible for females to use male urinals with a female urination device. The term \\"urinal\\" may also apply to a small building or other structure containing such fixtures. It can also refer to a small container in which urine can be collected for medical analysis, or for use where access to toilet facilities is not possible, such as in small aircraft, during extended stakeouts, or for the bedridden. Description Urinals with privacy barriers in a men's public toilet in Vienna, Austria Urinals for males can be used conveniently and appropriately by someone who has a penis or otherwise has adaptive means with which to urinate from a standing position. There is no age restriction, and urinals are commonly used by men and boys of all ages. Urinals for females also exist but are not common. In busy public toilets, urinals are installed for efficiency. Compared with urination in a general- purpose toilet, usage is faster and more sanitary because at the urinal there are no fecal germs, no additional doors or locks to touch, and no seat to turn up. Consistent use of urinals also keeps the toilet stalls cleaner and more available for males who need to defecate. A urinal takes less space, is simpler, and consumes less water per flush (or even no water at all) than a flush toilet. Large numbers of them are usually installed along a common supply pipe and drain. Urinals may also come in different heights, to accommodate tall and short users. Public urinals usually have a plastic mesh guard, which may optionally contain a deodorizing urinal deodorizer block or \\"urinal cake\\". The mesh is intended to prevent solid objects (such as cigarette butts, feces, chewing gum, or paper) from being flushed and possibly causing a plumbing stoppage. In some restaurants, bars, and clubs, ice may be put in the urinals, serving some of the same purposes as the deodorizing block without dispensing odorous chemicals.  Arrangement  For purposes of space and economic practicality, urinals are not typically placed inside stalls. Unlike in female public toilets, optimal resource efficiency in men's or boys' public toilets therefore requires urinating in full visibility of other males. In recent years, it has become more common in some countries for dividers or partitions to be installed between urinals to eliminate any chance of incidental exposure during the process of urination. Urinals in high- capacity public toilets are usually arranged in one or more rows directly opposite the door, so that users have their backs to people entering or standing outside. Often, one or two of the urinals, typically at one end of a long row, will be mounted lower than the others; they are meant for the disabled and other users who cannot reach the regular urinals. In facilities where people of various heights are present, such as schools, urinals that extend down to floor level may be used to allow anyone of any height to use any urinal. Instead of individual fixtures, trough urinals may be installed. These designs can be used by a number of people simultaneously, but they do not allow for much privacy. They are often installed where there is a high peak demand, such as in schools, music festivals, theatrical events, sports stadiums, discos, dance clubs, and convention halls. Urinals were once installed exclusively in commercial or institutional settings, but are also now available for private homes. They offer the advantages of substantial water savings in residences with many occupants, and reduction of \\"splash back\\", making cleaning easier.

(5075089050).jpgOutdoor urinals at school for boys (left) and girls (right) in Tamil Nadu, India Urinals with flushing Most public urinals incorporate a water flushing system to rinse urine from the bowl of the device, to prevent foul odors. The flush can be triggered by one of several methods: Manual handles This type of flush might be regarded as standard in the United States. Each urinal is equipped with a button or short lever to activate the flush, with users expected to operate it as they leave. Such a directly controlled system is the most efficient, provided that patrons remember to use it. This is far from certain, however, often because of fear of touching the handle, which is located too high to kick.With public sit-down toilets, users often kick the flush lever to avoid the perceived or real possibility of infection from touching it. Urinals with foot-activated flushing systems are sometimes found in high-traffic areas; these systems have a button set into the floor or a pedal on the wall at ankle height. The Americans with Disabilities Act requires that flush valves be mounted no higher than AFF (above the finished floor). Additionally, the urinal is to be mounted no higher than AFF, and to have a rim that is tapered and elongated and protrudes at least from the wall. This enables users in wheelchairs to straddle the lip of the urinal and urinate without having to \\"arc\\" the flow of urine upwards. Some urinals are equipped with water-saving \\"dual-flush\\" handles, which use half as much water when pushed upwards, and operate a standard full flush when pressed downwards. The handles are often color-coded green to alert users to this feature. Timed flush In Germany, the United Kingdom, France, the Republic of Ireland, Hong Kong and some parts of Sweden and Finland, manual flush handles are unusual. Instead, the traditional system is a timed flush that operates automatically at regular intervals. Groups of up to ten or more urinals will be connected to a single overhead cistern, which contains the timing mechanism. A constant drip-feed of water slowly fills the cistern until a tipping point is reached, when the valve opens (or a siphon begins to drain the cistern), and all the urinals in the group are flushed. Electronic controllers performing the same function are also used. This system does not require any action from its users, but it is wasteful of water when toilets are used irregularly. However, in these countries users are so used to the automatic system, that attempts to install manual flushes to save water are generally unsuccessful. Users ignore them not through deliberate laziness or fear of infection, but because activating the flush is not habitual. To help reduce water usage when public toilets are closed, some public toilets with timed flushing use an electric water valve connected to the room's light switch. When the building is in active use during the day and the lights are on, the timed flush operates normally. At night when the building is closed, the lights are turned off and the flushing action stops. Door-regulated flush This is an older method of water-saving automatic flushing, which only operates when the public toilet has been used. A push- button switch is mounted in the door frame, and triggers the flush valve for all urinals every time the door is opened. While it cannot detect the use of individual urinals, it provides reasonable flushing action without wasting excessive amounts of water when the urinals are not being used. This method requires a spring-operated automatic door closer, since the flush mechanism only operates when the door opens. Alternatively, a flushing system connected to the door can count the number of users, and operate when the number of door opening events reaches a certain value. At night, the door never opens, so flushing never occurs. Automatic flush Long-exposure photography shows how light sensors work Electronic automatic flushes solve the problems of previous approaches, and are common in new installations. A passive infrared sensor identifies when the urinal has been used, by detecting when someone has stood in front of it and moved away, and then activates the flush. There usually is also a small override button, to allow optional manual flushing. Automatic flush facilities can be retrofitted to existing systems. The handle- operated valves of a manual system can be replaced with a suitably designed self-contained electronic valve, often battery-powered to avoid the need to add cables. Older timed-flush installations may add a device that regulates the water flow to the cistern according to the overall activity detected in the room. This does not provide true per-fixture automatic flushing, but is simple and cheap to add because only one device is required for the whole system. To prevent false-triggering of the automatic flush, most infrared detectors require that a presence be detected for at least five seconds, such as when a person is standing in front of it. This prevents a whole line of automatic flush units from triggering in succession if someone just walks past them. The automatic flush mechanism also typically waits for the presence to go out of sensor range before flushing. This reduces water usage, compared to a sensor that would trigger a continuous flushing action the whole time that a presence is detected.  Waterless urinals  Since about the 1990s urinals have been available on the market that use no water at all. These are called waterless urinals or flushless urinals. The first waterless urinal was developed at the end of the 19th century by the German-Austrian Wilhelm Beetz using an oil-based syphon with a liquid that he called Urinol. Waterless urinals can save between of water per urinal per year, depending on the amount of water used in the water-flushed urinal for comparison purposes, and the number of uses per day. For example, these numbers assume that the urinal would be used between 40 and 120 times per business day.\\"Going Green Pays Off\\", Buildings magazine, July 2004, www.buildings.com Waterless urinals allow the collection of undiluted pure urine which can be used as a fertilizer.von M√ºnch, E., Winker, M. (2011). Technology review of urine diversion components ‚Äì Overview on urine diversion components such as waterless urinals, urine diversion toilets, urine storage and reuse systems. Gesellschaft f√ºr Internationale Zusammenarbeit (GIZ) GmbH, Chapter 4  Odor control  Models of waterless urinals introduced by the Waterless Company in 1991 and others in 2001 by Falcon Waterfree Technologies and Sloan Valve Company, as well as Duravit, use a trap insert filled with a sealant liquid instead of water. The lighter-than-water sealant floats on top of the urine collected in the U-bend, preventing odors from being released into the air. The cartridge and sealant must be periodically replaced. Waterless urinals may also use an outlet system that traps the odor, preventing the smell often present in toilet blocks. Another method to eliminate odor was introduced by Caroma, which installed a deodorizing block in their waterless urinal that was activated during use. Odor control in waterless urinals is also achieved with simple one-way valves which are manufactured as a flat rubber tube (the tube opens when urine flows through) or with two silicone \\"curtain\\" pieces. The former is used in the waterless urinals by the company Keramagvon M√ºnch, E., Winker, M. (2011).

(2009). Waterless Urinals ‚Äì A Proposal to Save Water and Recover Urine Nutrients in Africa. 34th WEDC International Conference, Addis Ababa, Ethiopia  Applications  Waterless urinals can be installed in high-traffic facilities, and in situations where providing a water supply may be difficult or where water conservation is desired. Waterless urinals have become rather common in Germany since about 2009 and can be found at restaurants, cinemas, highway rest stops, train stations and so forth. It was estimated in 2009 that there are about 6 million urinals in Germany, and about 100,000 of those were of the waterless type in that year.Oeko-Innovationen: Wasserlose Urinale. Kein Wasserverbrauch und mehr Hygiene (in German), 2009 Due to high-level water restrictions during about 2005-2008 the city council of Brisbane, Australia mandated conversion to waterless urinals. Flush urinals are nowadays rarely seen in Brisbane.  Installation and maintenance  The drain pipes from waterless urinals need to be installed correctly in terms of diameter, slope and pipe materials in order to prevent buildup of struvite (\\"urine stone\\") and calcium phosphate precipitates in the pipes, which would cause blockages and could require expensive repairs. Also, the undiluted urine is corrosive to metals (except for stainless steel), which is why plastic pipes are generally preferred for urine drain pipes. Most waterless urinals do not prevent odorous staining on the surface of the urinals, and periodic cleaning of the fixture and its surrounds is still required. When maintained according to manufacturers' recommendations, well-designed waterless urinals do not emit any more odors than flushed urinals do. However, some odor-trapping devices work better than others in the longer term. Regular, thorough maintenance of the respective odor control device is needed for all types of waterless urinals, as per the manufacturer's recommendation.  Situation in the United States  US federal law has mandated no more than one gallon per flush since 1994, and the EPA estimates that the average urinal is flushed 20 times per day, which gives an average water use of per year. Mechanical traps are not allowed by US building codes but are allowed in many other countries. Plumbers' unions initially opposed waterless urinals, citing concerns about health and safety, which have been debunked by scientists who have studied the devices. Facing opposition to their attempts to have the devices allowed in plumbing codes, manufacturers devised a compromise. The Uniform Plumbing Code was modified to allow waterless urinals to be installed, provided that unneeded water lines were nevertheless run to the back of the urinals. This allows conventional water-flushing urinals to be retrofitted later, if waterless models were judged to be unsatisfactory over time. In March 2006, the Associated Press reported that the plumbers' union in Philadelphia had become upset because developer Liberty Property Trust had decided to use waterless urinals in the Comcast Center. Many in the union believed that this would lead to less work for them. The developer cited saving the city of water per year as its deciding factor. In February 2010, the headquarters of the California EPA removed waterless urinals that were installed in 2003 due to \\"hundreds of complaints\\", including odors and splashed urine on the floors.Cal/EPA headquarters flushes waterless urinals. news10.net (22 February 2010).

These urinals are often equipped with partitions for the sake of privacy, and some are fully enclosed structures. They may or may not be equipped with water flushing mechanisms. The first 'pissiors' were installed in Paris in the 1830s, and the idea gradually gained popularity in other European cities. From a peak in the 1930s when there were over 1000 in Paris alone, historic urinals have gradually disappeared, in favour of facilities for both sexes. In the 21st century, public urination by men in some locations was again seen as a nuisance, and modern versions of street urinals have been installed. The Netherlands has a number of strategically placed street urinals in various cities, intended to reduce public urination by drunken men. Amsterdam has the largest collection of historic urinals, with about 30 'Plaskrul' ('pisscurl'), a flushless urinal with a curved privacy screen, in the central city. In recent years urinals that can be retracted into the ground during the day or between special events have been installed, in order to save space when they are not expected to be needed. When closed they look like a large manhole in a sidewalk. Similar retractable models, such as the model by the Dutch company Urilift, are also seen in the UK and other countries. At night when bars are open they rise out of the sidewalk; some time after the bars close, the urinals return to their manhole configuration so that they are unseen by people during the day. In the Philippines, Marikina was the first city to install street urinals in the late 1990s. When Marikina Mayor Bayani Fernando was appointed chair of the Metropolitan Manila Development Authority, he installed street urinals in the rest of Metro Manila as well.

Many therefore do not know how ‚Äì or even that it is possible ‚Äì for a female to aim her urine stream as would be required to use a male urinal. Thus, several different types of urinals have been designed for females that do not require the user to aim her urine stream. A typical female user could thus theoretically approach such a urinal squatting backwards over it without necessarily trying to aim her stream. File:Femaleurinal.jpgUrinals designed for female users File:Unisex Urinals.jpgUnisex urinals which can be used by men or women  Arts and interactive urinals  Kisses! is a controversial urinal designed by the female Dutch designer Meike van Schijndel.

In early March 2004, the National Organization for Women (NOW) took offense to the new urinals that Virgin Atlantic decided to install in the Virgin Atlantic clubhouse at John F Kennedy International Airport in New York City. After receiving many angry phone calls from female customers, Virgin Atlantic Vice President John Riordan called NOW to apologize. Protestors surmised a connection to oral sex or urolagnia, and based their complaints on the urinals being sexist. A McDonald's restaurant in the Netherlands removed them after a customer complained to the head office in the United States. Interactive urinals have been developed in a number of countries, allowing users to entertain themselves during urination. One example is the Toylet, a video game system produced by the Japanese company Sega that allows users to play video games using their urine to control the on-screen action. File:Urinal mouth.jpgControversial Kisses! urinals were designed by a woman File:CaptiveMedia ExhibitBalham.jpgAdvertising displays for a \\"captive audience\\" in London Makeshift urinals During military operations, such as the Korean War, Vietnam War, or Operation Desert Storm, \\"piss tubes\\" were used as makeshift urinals. To make one, soldiers would affix an inverted disposable water bottle on one end of a rigid tube, burying the other end. Removing the base of the bottle made a funnel which would be left at the proper height. Deposited urine simply soaked into the ground; when the area became saturated, the device was relocated.  In vehicles  , the aircraft manufacturer Airbus offered its customers the option of installing urinals in its A380 aircraft. History Until the 1990s, street urinals were a common sight in Paris (France), and in the 1930s more than 1200 were in service. They were famous among foreign tourists.Harvey A. Levenstein, We'll Always Have Paris: American Tourists in France since 1930, Chicago: University of Chgicago, 2004, , p. 31. Parisians referred to them as vespasiennes, the name being derived from that of the Roman Emperor Vespasian, who, according to an anecdote, imposed a tax on urine. Beginning in the 1990s, the vespasiennes (renowned for their smell and lack of hygiene) were gradually replaced by Sanisettes. Today only one vespasienne remains in the city (on Boulevard Arago), and it is still regularly used. They still exist in other French cities and in other countries.

It is responsible for powering the professional video camera, handling signals sent over the camera cable to and from the camera, and can be used to control various camera parameters remotely.  History  Before cameras became self-contained units, broadcast cameras required vast racks of control units just to generate a usable picture. In outside broadcast production, these racks took up an entire section of the OB truck and were operated by a small team of skilled engineers. These vision engineers had two roles. Firstly, they set up the CCUs at the start of a production and ensured that the picture created was of broadcast quality. This process included a lengthy 'lining up' process in which the vision engineer would work with the camera operator, to adjust the settings on both the actual camera and the CCU in tandem. During production, it was the vision engineers job to operate the CCUs and control both the exposure and the colour balance. So skilled and labour-intensive was this role that each CCU required its own dedicated vision engineer.  Benefits  Modern cameras are typically more self-contained than their predecessors and many can operate without a CCU. Even when not required, a CCU can be of benefit for the following reasons: * In a system with a multiple-camera setup, the cameras can be matchedmade to look the same in terms of colour balance and picture intensity without having to ask camera operators to make an adjustment. * The camera operators are freed from the control of iris, black level and colour balance, leaving them free to concentrate on other aspects of camerawork such as blocking and image composition. * All signals that operate between the camera and CCU are carried in one multicore cable, triax or fiber optic cable.  Functions  A bank of RCPs for racking Sony studio cameras. Detail of three Philips RCP panels. A CCU is often used in conjunction with a remote control panel (RCP), a waveform monitor and a vectorscope to rack and match many cameras together remotely. Common adjustable parameters include: * Iris (see aperture) * Color temperature filters * Neutral density filters * Shutter speed * Saturation * Master gain * Master black (pedestal) * Black level trim (for red, green and blue components) * Gain trim (for red, green and blue components) In addition to these, there are usually options internally generating a test card for testing, return feeds or talkback. For more complex productions, preset scene files can be recalled to quickly change the settings of the camera on the fly.  Connectivity  Broadcast cameras typically carry several signals over the camera cable in addition to the camera output itself. Typically, RGB signals are transmitted over the camera cable. The CCU will usually convert these to SDI, YUV or composite for interfacing to other video equipment - typically it will be connected to a vision mixer via a video router. Typical signals can be both digital signal and analog signals: * Video out (Serial digital interface (SDI)) * Video out (composite video) * Video out (component video) * Audio out (microphone on board) * Video in (genlock in the form of color burst) * Return video in (composite)typically for a teleprompter * Return video incarrying the output from the vision mixer * Interruptible feedback Intercom * Tally light trigger See also * Television studio References  External links * How To Video: Camera Control Unit from Mohawk College, Hamilton, Ontario, Canada Film and video technology Television technology ","title":"Camera control unit"},{"id":"698511","text":"Mizrahi Jews () or Mizrahim (), also referred to as Mizrachi (), Edot HaMizrach (; \\"[Jewish] Communities of the [Middle] East\\"; Mizrahi Hebrew: '), or Oriental Jews, are the descendants of the local Jewish communities that had existed in the Middle East and North Africa from biblical times into the modern era. Originally, the term Mizrahi was the Hebrew translationRuvik Rosental, PhD., \\"Western Sepharadim and Eastern Ashkenazim\\" at his website, 9 September 2000. of Eastern European Jews' German name Ostjuden,Aziza Khazzoom, \\"Mizrahim, Mizrachiut, and the Future of Israeli Studies\\", Israel Studies Forum, Vol. 17, No. 2 (Spring 2002), pp. 94-106. as seen in the Mizrahi Movement, Bank Mizrahi and in HaPoel HaMizrahi. In the 1950s the Jews who came from the communities listed above were simply called and known as Jews (Yahud in Arabic) and in order to distinguish them in the Jewish sub-ethnicities, Israeli officials, who themselves were mostly Eastern European Jews, transferred the name to them (even as the surname \\"Mizrachi\\", assigned by immigration clerks, replacing previously held surnames), though most of these immigrants arrived from lands located further westward than Central Europe.\\"The Settling of Western Jews in Jerusalem\\", Official Israeli Ministry of Education paper for high school students about North African Jews who prior were called \\"Western Jews\\" to as &/ \\"Mugrabi Jews\\" as opposed to \\"Mizrahi/Eastern Jews\\".For God's Sake: Why Are There So Many More Israelis with the Surname \\"Mizrahi\\" Than \\"Friedmans\\"?, by Michal Margalit, 17 January 2014, Ynet. Mizrahi is subsequently the surname most often changed by Israelis,The Surname that Israelis Change the Most: \\"Mizrahi\\", Ofer Aderet, Haaretz, 17 February 2017. and many scholars claim that the transferring of the name \\"Mizrahim\\" was a form of OrientalismAlon Gan, \\"Victimhood Book\\", Israel Democracy Institute, 2014. Pp. 137-139. towards the Oriental Jews, similar to the ways in which Westjuden had labeled Ostjuden as \\"second class\\" and excluded them from possible positions of power.Dina Haruvi and Hadas Shabbat-Nadir, \\"Have You Ever Met A Streotypical Mizrahi?\\"\\" (in Hebrew), Ohio State University.Haggai Ram, \\"Iranophobia: The Logic of an Israeli Obsession\\", Stanford University Press. \\"Mizrahim\\" include descendants of Babylonian Jews from modern Iraq and Iraqi Kurdistan, Syrian Jews, Yemenite Jews, Georgian Jews, Mountain Jews from Dagestan and Azerbaijan, Persian Jews from Iran, Bukharan Jews from Uzbekistan and Tajikistan. The term Mizrahim is also sometimes applied to descendants of Maghrebi Jews and Sephardi Jews, who had lived in North Africa (Egypt, Libya, Tunisia, Algeria, and Morocco), the Sephardi communities of Turkey, and the mixed Levantine communities of Lebanon, Old Yishuv, and Syria. These various Jewish communities were first grouped into a single ethnic identity officially in the Jewish Agency's 1944 One Million Plan.: \\"The principal significance of this plan lies in the fact, noted by Yehuda Shenhav, that this was the first time in Zionist history that Jews from Middle Eastern and North African countries were all packaged together in one category as the target of an immigration plan. There were earlier plans to bring specific groups, such as the Yemenites, but the \\"one million plan\\" was, as Shenhav says, \\"the zero point,\\" the moment when the category of mizrahi jews in the current sense of this term, as an ethnic group distinct from European-born jews, was invented.\\" As of 2005, 61% of Israeli Jews were of full or partial Mizrahi ancestry.Jews, Arabs, and Arab Jews: The Politics of Identity and Reproduction in Israel, Ducker, Clare Louise, Institute of Social Studies, The Hague, Netherlands Before the establishment of the state of Israel, Mizrahi Jews did not identify themselves as a separate Jewish subgroup. Instead, Mizrahi Jews generally characterized themselves as Sephardi, as they follow the customs and traditions of Sephardi Judaism (but with some differences among the minhag \\"customs\\" of particular communities). That has resulted in a conflation of terms, particularly in Israel and in religious usage, with \\"Sephardi\\" being used in a broad sense and including Mizrahi Jews, North African Jews as well as Sephardim proper. From the point of view of the official Israeli rabbinate, any rabbis of Mizrahi origin in Israel are under the jurisdiction of the Sephardi Chief Rabbi of Israel. From 1948 to 1980, over 850,000 Mizrahi and Sephardi Jews were expelled, fled or evacuated from Arab and Muslim countries. Terminology \\"Mizrahi\\" is literally translated as \\"Oriental\\", \\"Eastern\\", Mizra·∏•, Hebrew for \\"east\\". In the past the word \\"Mizrahim\\", corresponding to the Arabic word Mashriqiyyun (Arabic \\"ŸÖÿ¥ÿ±ŸäŸÇŸäŸàŸÜ\\" or Easterners), referred to the natives of Iraq and other Asian countries, as distinct from those of North Africa (Maghribiyyun). In medieval and early modern times, the corresponding Hebrew word ma'arav was used for North Africa. In Talmudic and Geonic times, however, this word \\"ma'arav\\" referred to the land of Israel, as contrasted with Babylonia. For this reason, many object to the use of \\"Mizrahi\\" to include Moroccan and other North African Jews. The term Mizrahim or Edot Hamizra·∏•, Oriental communities, grew in Israel under the circumstances of the meeting of waves of Jewish immigrants from Europe, North Africa, the Middle East and Central Asia, followers of Ashkenazi, Sephardi, and Temani (Yemenite) rites. In modern Israeli usage, it refers to all Jews from Central and West Asian countries, many of them Arabic-speaking Muslim-majority countries. The term came to be widely used more by Mizrahi activists in the early 1990s. Since then in Israel it has become an accepted semi-official and media designation. (clicking on archived links leads to document download) Sami Michael goes against the terms \\"Mizrahim\\" and \\"Edot HaMizrach\\", claiming it's a Mapai's fictitious identity to preserve a \\"rival\\" to the \\"Ashkenazim\\" and help them push the \\"Mizrahim\\" below in the social-economic ladder and behind them, so they won't ever be in line with the Israeli elites of European Jewish descent.\\"There Are People who Want to Keep Us in the Bottom\\", Sami Michael's 1999 interveiw with Ruvik Rozental. He's also going against the Mapai manner of labeling all the Oriental Jews as \\"one folk\\" and erasing their unique and individual history as separated communities; he wonders why the real Easterners of his time who were the Eastern European Jewish peasants from the villages weren't labeled as \\"Mizrahi\\" in Israel while fitting it more than the Oriental Jews who were labeled that way. Michael is also against the inclusion of Oriental Jewish communities who do not descend from Sepharadic Jews, as his own Iraqi Jews, as \\"Sepharadim\\" by the Israeli politicians, calling it \\"historically inaccurate\\". He also mentions that his work as an author is always referred to as \\"Ethnic\\" while European Jews' work, even if histoic in theme, isn't for that very racism. Most of the \\"Mizrahi\\" activists actually originated from North African Jewish communities, traditionally called \\"Westerners\\" (Maghrebi), rather than \\"Easterners\\" (Mashreqi). The Jews who made Aliya from North Africa in the 19th Century and prior started their own political and religious organization in 1860 which operated in Jerusalem was called \\"The Western Jewish Diaspora Council\\" (Hebrew: \\"◊ï◊¢◊ì ◊î◊¢◊ì◊î ◊î◊û◊¢◊®◊ë◊ô◊™ ◊ë◊ô◊®◊ï◊©◊ú◊ô◊ù\\"). Many Jews originated from Arab and Muslim countries today reject \\"Mizrahi\\" (or any) umbrella description, and prefer to identify themselves by their particular country of origin, or that of their immediate ancestors, e. g., \\"Moroccan Jew\\", or prefer to use the old term \\"Sephardi\\" in its broader meaning.Yochai Oppenheimer, \\"Mizrahi fiction as a minor literature\\", in Dario Miccoli eds., \\"Contemporary Sephardic and Mizrahi Literature: A Diaspora\\", 2017. pp. 98-100. On 15 October 2020 an interview with Lior Ashkenazi, a famous Israeli actor whose parents made aliyah from turkey, came out where he referred to his view on the term \\"Mizrahi\\": \\"All my life I and the rest of us were identified and identifying as Sephardic Jews; until Miri Regev's comment on Foxtrot in 2017 I never was called 'Mizrahi' nor knew I'm one. We grew up as Sephardic and someone decided one day to change the labels and to refer to us as 'Mizrahim', probably as a political spin. It was a non-issue till the mid 1980s; today it's taken as part of a political discussion I find to be bizzare.\\" Religious rite designations Today, many identify non-Ashkenazi rite Jews as Sephardi ‚Äì in modern Hebrew Sfaradim ‚Äì, mixing ancestral origin and religious rite. This broader definition of \\"Sephardim\\" as including all, or most, Mizrahi Jews is also common in Jewish religious circles. During the past century, the Sephardi rite absorbed the unique rite of the Yemenite Jews, and lately, Beta Israel religious leaders in Israel have also joined Sefardi rite collectivities, especially following rejection of their Jewishness by some Ashkenazi circles. The reason for this classification of all Mizrahim under Sephardi rite is that most Mizrahi communities use much the same religious rituals as Sephardim proper due to historical reasons. The prevalence of the Sephardi rite among Mizrahim is partially a result of Sephardim proper joining some of Mizrahi communities following the 1492 Alhambra Decree, which expelled Jews from Sepharad (Spain and Portugal). Over the last few centuries, the previously distinctive rites of the Mizrahi communities were influenced, superimposed upon or altogether replaced by the rite of the Sephardim, perceived as more prestigious. Even before this assimilation, the original rite of many Jewish Oriental communities was already closer to the Sephardi rite than to the Ashkenazi one. For this reason, \\"Sephardim\\" has come to mean not only \\"Spanish Jews\\" proper but \\"Jews of the Spanish rite\\", just as \\"Ashkenazim\\" is used for \\"Jews of the German rite\\", whether or not their families originate in Germany. Many of the Sephardi Jews exiled from Spain resettled in greater or lesser numbers in the Arab world, such as Syria and Morocco. In Syria, most eventually intermarried with, and assimilated into, the larger established communities of Musta'rabim and Mizrahim. In some North African countries, such as Morocco, Sephardi Jews came in greater numbers, and so largely contributed to the Jewish settlements that the pre-existing Jews were assimilated by the more recently arrived Sephardi Jews. Either way, this assimilation, combined with the use of the Sephardi rite, led to the popular designation and conflation of most non-Ashkenazi Jewish communities from the Middle East and North Africa as \\"Sephardi rite\\", whether or not they were descended from Spanish Jews, which is what the terms \\"Sephardi Jews\\" and \\"Sfaradim\\" properly implied when used in the ethnic as opposed to the religious sense. In some Arabic countries, such as Egypt and Syria, Sephardi Jews arrived via the Ottoman Empire would distinguish themselves from the already established Musta'rabim, while in others, such as Morocco and Algeria, the two communities largely intermarried, with the latter embracing Sephardi customs and thus forming a single community. Language Arabic In the Arab world (such as Morocco, Algeria, Tunisia, Libya, Egypt, Yemen, Jordan, Lebanon, Iraq, and Syria), Mizrahim most often speak Arabic, although Arabic is now mainly used as a second language, especially by the older generation. Most of the many notable philosophical, religious and literary works of the Jews in Spain, North Africa and Asia were written in Arabic using a modified Hebrew alphabet. Aramaic Kurdish Jews in Rawanduz, northern Iraq, 1905. Aramaic is a Semitic language subfamily. Specific varieties of Aramaic are identified as \\"Jewish languages\\" since they are the languages of major Jewish texts such as the Talmud and Zohar, and many ritual recitations such as the Kaddish. Traditionally, Aramaic has been a language of Talmudic debate in yeshivot, as many rabbinic texts are written in a mixture of Hebrew and Aramaic. The current Hebrew alphabet, known as \\"Assyrian lettering\\" or \\"the square script\\", was in fact borrowed from Aramaic. In Kurdistan, the language of the Mizrahim is a variant of Aramaic. As spoken by the Kurdish Jews, Judeo-Aramaic languages are Neo-Aramaic languages descended from Jewish Babylonian Aramaic. They are related to the Christian Aramaic dialects spoken by Assyrian people. Persian and other languages Among other languages associated with Mizrahim are Judeo-Iranian languages such as Judeo-Persian, the Bukhori dialect, Judeo-Tat, and Kurdish languages; Georgian; Marathi; and Judeo- Malayalam. Most Persian Jews speak standard Persian, as do many other Jews from Iran, Afghanistan, and Bukhara (Uzbekistan), Judeo-Tat, a form of Persian, is spoken by the Mountain Jews of Azerbaijan and Russian Dagestan, and in other Caucasian territories in Russia. Migration Some Mizrahim migrated to India, other parts of Central Asia, and China. In some Mizrahi Jewish communities (notably those of Yemen and Iran), polygyny has been practiced. Post-1948 dispersal After the establishment of the State of Israel and subsequent 1948 Arab‚ÄìIsraeli War, most Mizrahim were either expelled by their Arab rulers or chose to leave and emigrated to Israel. According to the 2009 Statistical Abstract of Israel, 50.2% of Israeli Jews are of Mizrahi or Sephardi origin.Statistical Abstract of Israel, 2009, CBS. \\"Table 2.24 ‚Äì Jews, by country of origin and age\\" (PDF). Retrieved 22 March 2010. Anti-Jewish actions by Arab governments in the 1950s and 1960s, in the context of the founding of the State of Israel, led to the departure of large numbers of Mizrahi Jews from the Middle East. The exodus of 25,000 Mizrahi Jews from Egypt after the 1956 Suez Crisis led to the overwhelming majority of Mizrahim leaving Arab countries. They became refugees. Most went to Israel. Many Moroccan and Algerian Jews went to France. Thousands of Lebanese, Syrian and Egyptian Jews emigrated to the United States and to Brazil. Today, as many as 40,000 Mizrahim still remain in communities scattered throughout the non- Arab Muslim world, primarily in Iran, but also Uzbekistan, Azerbaijan, and Turkey.The Jewish Population of the World, The Jewish Virtual Library There are few Maghrebim remaining in the Arab world. About 3,000 remain in Morocco and 1,100 in Tunisia. Other countries with remnants of ancient Jewish communities with official recognition, such as Lebanon, have 100 or fewer Jews. A trickle of emigration continues, mainly to Israel and the United States. Absorption into Israeli society Refuge in Israel was not without its tragedies: \\"In a generation or two, millennia of rooted Oriental civilization, unified even in its diversity\\", had been wiped out, writes Mizrahi scholar Ella Shohat.Ella Shohat: \\"Sephardim in Israel: Zionism from the Standpoint of its Jewish Victims\\", Social Text, No.19/20 (1988), p. 32 The trauma of rupture from their countries of origin was further complicated by the difficulty of the transition upon arrival in Israel; Mizrahi immigrants and refugees were placed in rudimentary and hastily erected tent cities (Ma'abarot) often in development towns on the peripheries of Israel. Settlement in Moshavim (cooperative farming villages) was only partially successful, because Mizrahim had historically filled a niche as craftsmen and merchants and most did not traditionally engage in farmwork. As the majority left their property behind in their home countries as they journeyed to Israel, many suffered a severe decrease in their socio-economic status aggravated by their cultural and political differences with the dominant Ashkenazi community. Furthermore, a policy of austerity was enforced at that time due to economic hardships. Mizrahi immigrants arrived speaking many languages: * many, especially those from North Africa and the fertile crescent, spoke Arabic dialects; * those from Iran spoke Persian; * Mountain Jews from Azerbaijan spoke Judeo-Tat; * Baghdadi Jews from India spoke English; * Bukharan Jews from Uzbekistan and Tajikistan spoke the Bukhori dialect; * the Bene Israel from Maharashtra, India, arrived speaking Marathi. Mizrahim from elsewhere brought Georgian, Judaeo-Georgian and various other languages with them. Hebrew had historically been a language only of prayer for most Jews not living in Israel, including the Mizrahim. Thus, with their arrival in Israel, the Mizrahim retained culture, customs and language distinct from their Ashkenazi counterparts. The collective estimate for Mizrahim (circa 2018) is at 4,000,000. =Disparities and integration= The cultural differences between Mizrahi and Ashkenazi Jews impacted the degree and rate of assimilation into Israeli society, and sometimes the divide between Eastern European and Middle Eastern Jews was quite sharp. Segregation, especially in the area of housing, limited integration possibilities over the years. Intermarriage between Ashkenazim and Mizrahim is increasingly common in Israel and by the late 1990s 28% of all Israeli children had multi-ethnic parents (up from 14% in the 1950s).Barbara S. Okun, Orna Khait-Marelly. 2006. Socioeconomic Status and Demographic Behavior of Adult Multiethnics: Jews in Israel. It has been claimed that intermarriage does not tend to decrease ethnic differences in socio-economic status, however that does not apply to the children of inter-ethnic marriages. Although social integration is constantly improving, disparities persist. A study conducted by the Israeli Central Bureau of Statistics (ICBS), Mizrahi Jews are less likely to pursue academic studies than Ashkenazi Jews. Israeli-born Ashkenazim are up to twice more likely to study in a university than Israeli-born Mizrahim.http://www.cbs.gov.il/publications/educ_demog_05/pdf/t16.pdf Furthermore, the percentage of Mizrahim who seek a university education remains low compared to second-generation immigrant groups of Ashkenazi origin, such as Russians. According to a survey by the Adva Center, the average income of Ashkenazim was 36 percent higher than that of Mizrahim in 2004.Hebrew PDF Notable Mizrahim Business people * David Alliance, Baron Alliance GBE, Iranian-born British businessman and Liberal Democrat politician * Jacob Arabo, Bukharian-American jeweler and founder of Jacob & Company * Alona Barkat, owner of the football team Hapoel Beer Sheva; sister- in-law of former Jerusalem mayor Nir Barkat * J.

Together with his brothers Nicholas, Joseph and Moses, John was instrumental in founding Brown University (then known as the College of Rhode Island) and moving it to their family's former land in Providence. John Brown laid the cornerstone of the university's oldest building in 1770, and he served as its treasurer for 21 years (1775 ‚Äì 1796). Brown was one of the founders of Providence Bank and became its first president in 1791. He was active in the American Revolution, notably as an instigator of the 1772 Gaspee Affair, and he served in both state and national government. At the same time, he was a powerful defender of slave trading, clashing aggressively‚Äîin newspapers, courts and politics‚Äîwith his brother Moses, who had become an abolitionist. John Brown's home in Providence is now a museum and National Historic Landmark. Brown's desk and bookcase reside at the Yale University Art Gallery in New Haven, Connecticut. The desk is attributed to Daniel Spencer, who opened his cabinetmaking studio in Providence, Rhode Island in 1772. Early life John Brown was born in Providence, Rhode Island, on January 27, 1736, to James Brown II (1698‚Äì1739) and Hope Power (1702‚Äì1792). His paternal grandparents were Elder James Brown (1666‚Äì1716), a pastor at the First Baptist Church, and Mary (Harris) Brown. His father, James Brown II, established himself early in the mercantile business, trading in slaves, rum, molasses, and other goods. His parents, who were married in 1723, had six children, including: Mary Brown (1731‚Äì1795), who married Dr. David Vanderlight, James Brown III (1724‚Äì1750), the eldest son who was a sea captain and who died young, Nicholas Brown (1729‚Äì1791), Joseph Brown (1733‚Äì1785), John Brown (1736‚Äì1803) and Moses Brown (1738‚Äì1836). John Brown House photographed in 1918 Family John Brown was a descendant of Chad Brown, a co-founder of Providence and early Baptist minister at the First Baptist Church in America following Roger Williams. His uncle was Obadiah Brown I (1712‚Äì1762), who joined Brown's father, James Brown II (1698‚Äì1739), in the mercantile trade in cocoa, rum, molasses and slaves. Obadiah's initial role was as master of his brother's shipping vessels in the West Indies trade. After the death of Brown's father in 1739, Obadiah retired from the sea himself, but continued the business. He also helped to raise James' young children, later forming a partnership with James' four surviving sons as \\"Obadiah Brown & Co.\\" Obadiah Brown I, who married his first cousin, Mary Harris (1718‚Äì1805), daughter of Toleration and Sarah Harris, had eight children. All four of their sons died in early childhood, and their four daughters, Brown's first cousins, were Phebe Brown (b.1738), who married John Fenner (brother of Governor Arthur Fenner), Sarah Brown (1742‚Äì1800), who married Lt. Gov. Jabez Bowen (1739‚Äì1815), Anna Brown (1744‚Äì1773), who married her first cousin, Moses Brown, and Mary Brown (b.1753), who married Thomas Arnold (1751‚Äì1826). Another uncle was Rhode Island Deputy Governor Elisha Brown and a nephew was Nicholas Brown Jr., the philanthropist and the namesake for Brown University. Career Brown went on to own a successful farming and shipping business with his brothers, Nicholas, Joseph, and Moses Brown. He was active in the slave trade and China trade and invested heavily in privateers during the 1760s through 1780s. Brown was a leader in the Sons of Liberty and was one of the instigators of the burning of the Gaspee in 1772. This was one of the first violent acts of defiance to the authority of the British Crown which eventually led up to the American Revolution. In 1775, during the American Revolution, John Brown sold the United States Navy its first ship, the USS Providence (previously, the Katy). Brown was named as a delegate for Rhode Island to the Continental Congress in 1784-1785 but did not attend. Controversy John Brown was also an active slave trader. On March 22, 1794, Congress passed the Slave Trade Act of 1794, which prohibited the making, loading, outfitting, equipping, or dispatching of any ship to be used in the trade of slaves. Subsequently, on August 5, 1797, John Brown was tried in federal court as the first American to be tried under the 1794 law. Brown was convicted and was forced to forfeit his ship . Brown's involvement in the Triangular Trade in African slaves and financial contribution to the early years of Brown University's development are addressed in the official Response of Brown University to the Report of the Steering Committee on Slavery and Justice. Business interests Brown's business interests were varied. In addition to the slave trade he was involved in shipbuilding and real estate speculation. He was also a partner (along with his brother Moses Brown and Rhode Island Governor Stephen Hopkins) in the Hope Furnace (located in Hope Village on the border of towns of Scituate and Coventry, RI) which made cannons during the American Revolution and through the War of 1812. In 1791 Brown founded of the Providence Bank - the first bank in Rhode Island, and organizer of the Providence South Bridge Company. After various acquisitions over the next 160 years Providence Bank evolved into FleetBoston Financial which, in turn, was absorbed by Bank of America in 2004. Providence Bank is one of the oldest \\"branches\\" in Bank of America's \\"family tree\\" and is, at least arguably, still a \\"living\\" corporate entity. The original Providence Bank building still stands at 50 South Main Street in Providence and is the corporate office of the Brown & Ives Land Company which is another business which can trace its roots to John Brown. American revolution John Brown played a leading role in the Gasp√©e Affair of 1772 that increased hostilities between the thirteen colonies and the British Empire and helped catalyze events leading up to the American Revolutionary War. He was an active Federalist and pushed against Rhode Island's anti-federalist, \\"Country Party\\" in getting Rhode Island to become part of federal union. Providence, the first warship to sail for America's Continental Navy, was built in 1768 by John Brown. It was purchased by the colony of Rhode Island after British men-of-war began attacking Rhode Island's shipping lanes. The General Assembly ordered its committee of safety to fit out two ships to defend the lanes, one of which became the Providence. The ship ‚Äî at one time under the command of John Paul Jones, considered the father of the American Navy ‚Äî went on to participate in 60 battles and to capture 40 British ships before it was dismantled in 1779 to prevent it from falling into the hands of the British. Political activity Brown was elected to the United States House of Representatives in 1798 and served one two-year term from March 4, 1799 to March 4, 1801. The carriage he travelled to Washington in is referred to as \\"John Brown's chariot\\" and is preserved at the John Brown House in Providence. Death and burial John Brown died in Providence, Rhode Island on September 20, 1803, and interred in the Brown family plot in the North Burial Ground in Providence. Personal life He was married to Sarah (Smith) Brown (1738‚Äì1825). Together, they had: * James Brown III (1761‚Äì1834), who never married, was educated at Harvard University where he graduated in 1780.

(2008). Georg Friederici's (1906) \\"Scalping and Similar Warfare Customs in America\\" with a Critical Introduction. ProQuest. p.18. Scalp-taking is considered part of the broader cultural practice of the taking and display of human body parts as trophies, and may have developed as an alternative to the taking of human heads, for scalps were easier to take, transport, and preserve for subsequent display. Scalping independently developed in various cultures in both the Old and New Worlds.  Africa and Europe  In England in 1036, Earl Godwin, father of Harold Godwinson, was reportedly responsible for scalping his enemies. According to the ancient Abingdon manuscript, 'some of them were blinded, some maimed, some scalped. No more horrible deed was done in this country since the Danes came and made peace here'. Georg Frederici noted that ‚ÄúHerodotus provided the only clear and satisfactory portrayal of a scalping people in the old world‚Äù in his description of the Scythians, a nomadic people then located to the north and west of the Black Sea. Herodotus related that Scythian warriors would behead the enemies they defeated in battle and present the heads to their king to claim their share of the plunder. Then, the warrior would skin the head ‚Äúby making a circular cut round the ears and shaking out the skull; he then scrapes the flesh off the skin with the rib of an ox, and when it is clean works it with his fingers until it is supple, and fit to be used as a sort of handkerchief. He hangs these handkerchiefs on the bridle of his horse, and is very proud of them. The best man is the man who has the greatest number.‚Äù Ammianus Marcellinus noted the taking of scalps by the Alani, a people of Asiatic Scythia, in terms quite similar to those used by Herodotus. The Abb√© Emmanuel H. D. Domenech referenced the decalvare of the ancient Germans and the capillos et cutem detrahere of the code of the Visigoths as examples of scalping in early medieval Europe, though some more recent interpretations of these terms relate them to shaving off the hair of the head as a legal punishment rather than scalping. and Abstract. In 1845, mercenary John Duncan observed what he estimated to be 700 scalps taken in warfare and displayed as trophies by a contingent of female soldiers‚ÄîDahomey Amazons‚Äîemployed by the King of Dahomey (present-day Republic of Benin). Duncan noted that these would have been taken and kept over a long period of time and would not have come from a single battle. Although Duncan travelled widely in Dahomey, and described customs such as the taking of heads and the retention of skulls as trophies, nowhere else does he mention scalping.  Americas  A scalp dance Techniques Specific scalping techniques varied somewhat from place to place, depending on the cultural patterns of the scalper regarding the desired shape, size, and intended use of the severed scalp, and on how the victims wore their hair, but the general process of scalping was quite uniform. The scalper firmly grasped the hair of a subdued adversary, made several quick semicircular cuts with a sharp instrument on either side of the area to be taken, and then vigorously yanked at the nearly- severed scalp. The scalp separated from the skull along the plane of the areolar connective tissue, the fourth (and least substantial) of the five layers of the human scalp. Scalping was not in itself fatal, though it was most commonly inflicted on the gravely wounded or the dead. The earliest instruments used in scalping were stone knives crafted of flint, chert, or obsidian, or other materials like reeds or oyster shells that could be worked to carry an edge equal to the task. Collectively, such tools were also used for a variety of everyday tasks like skinning and processing game, but were replaced by metal knives acquired in trade through European contact. The implement, often referred to as a ‚Äúscalping knife‚Äù in popular American and European literature, was not known as such by Native Americans, a knife being for them just a simple and effective multi-purpose utility tool for which scalping was but one of many uses. Intertribal warfare Choctaw American Indians, in warpaint, bearing scalps, Alexandre de Batz, 1732 Author and historian Mark van de Logt wrote, \\"Although military historians tend to reserve the concept of 'total war, in which civilians are targeted, \\"for conflicts between modern industrial nations,\\" the term \\"closely approaches the state of affairs between the Pawnees, the Sioux, and the Cheyennes. Noncombatants were legitimate targets. Indeed, the taking of a scalp of a woman or child was considered honorable because it signified that the scalp taker had dared to enter the very heart of the enemy's territory.\\" Scalping Knife and Sheath, probably Sioux, early 19th century, Brooklyn Museum Many tribes of Native Americans practiced scalping, in some instances up until the end of the 19th century. Of the approximately 500 bodies at the Crow Creek massacre site, 90 percent of the skulls show evidence of scalping. The event took place circa 1325 AD.  Colonial wars  Hannah Duston scalps the sleeping Abenaki family who had kidnapped her and murdered her infant after the Raid on Haverhill (1697). The Connecticut and Massachusetts colonies offered bounties for the heads of killed hostile Indians, and later for just their scalps, during the Pequot War in the 1630s; Connecticut specifically reimbursed Mohegans for slaying the Pequot in 1637. Four years later, the Dutch in New Amsterdam offered bounties for the heads of Raritans. In 1643, the Iroquois attacked a group of Huron pelters and French carpenters near Montreal, killing and scalping three of the French. Bounties for Indian captives or their scalps appeared in the legislation of the American colonies during the Susquehannock War (1675‚Äì77).Grenier. 2005. p.39 New England offered bounties to white settlers and Narragansett people in 1675 during King Philip's War. By 1692, New France also paid their native allies for scalps of their enemies. In 1697, on the northern frontier of Massachusetts colony, settler Hannah Duston killed ten of her Abenaki captors during her nighttime escape, presented their ten scalps to the Massachusetts General Assembly, and was rewarded with bounties for two men, two women, and six children, even though Massachusetts had rescinded the law authorizing scalp bounties six months earlier. There were six colonial wars with New England and the Iroquois Confederacy fighting New France and the Wabanaki Confederacy over a 75-year period, starting with King William's War in 1688. All sides scalped victims, including noncombatants, during this frontier warfare. Bounty policies originally intended only for Native American scalps were extended to enemy colonists. Massachusetts created a scalp bounty during King William's War in July 1689. During Queen Anne's War, by 1703, the Massachusetts Bay Colony was offering $60 for each native scalp. During Father Rale's War (1722‚Äì1725), on August 8, 1722, Massachusetts put a bounty on native families. Ranger John Lovewell is known to have conducted scalp-hunting expeditions, the most famous being the Battle of Pequawket in New Hampshire. In the 1710s and '20s, New France engaged in frontier warfare with the Natchez people and the Meskwaki people, during which both sides would employ the practice. In response to repeated massacres of British families by the French and their native allies during King George's War, Massachusetts governor William Shirley issued a bounty in 1746 to be paid to British-allied Indians for the scalps of French- allied Indian men, women, and children. New York passed a Scalp Act in 1747. During Father Le Loutre's War and the Seven Years' War in Nova Scotia and Acadia, French colonists offered payments to Indians for British scalps.John Grenier. The Far Reaches of Empire: War in Nova Scotia, 1710-1760. Oklahoma University Press. 2008 In 1749, British Governor Edward Cornwallis created an extirpation proclamation, which included a bounty for male scalps or prisoners. Also during the Seven Years' War, Governor of Nova Scotia Charles Lawrence offered a reward for male Mi'kmaq scalps in 1756. (In 2000, some Mi'kmaq argued that this proclamation was still legal in Nova Scotia. Government officials argued that it was no longer legal because the bounty was superseded by later treaties - see the Halifax Treaties). During the French and Indian War, as of June 12, 1755, Massachusetts governor William Shirley was offering a bounty of ¬£40 for a male Indian scalp, and ¬£20 for scalps of females or of children under 12 years old. In 1756, Pennsylvania Lieutenant Governor Robert Morris, in his Declaration of War against the Lenni Lenape (Delaware) people, offered \\"130 Pieces of Eight, for the Scalp of Every Male Indian Enemy, above the Age of Twelve Years,\\" and \\"50 Pieces of Eight for the Scalp of Every Indian Woman, produced as evidence of their being killed.\\"  American Revolution  In the American Revolutionary War, Henry Hamilton, the British Lieutenant Governor and Superintendent of Indian Affairs at Fort Detroit, was known by American Patriots as the \\"hair-buyer general\\" because they believed he encouraged and paid his Native American allies to scalp American settlers. When Hamilton was captured in the war by the colonists, he was treated as a war criminal instead of a prisoner of war because of this. However, American historians have conceded that there was no positive proof that he had ever offered rewards for scalps. It is now assumed that during the American Revolution, no British officer paid for scalps.Kelsey pg. 303 During the Sullivan Expedition, the September 13, 1779 journal entry of Lieutenant William Barton tells of patriots participating in scalping. Americans believed British officers paid their Indian allies to scalp American soldiers, c. 1812.  Mexico  In 1835, the government of the Mexican state of Sonora put a bounty on the Apache which, over time, evolved into a payment by the government of 100 pesos for each scalp of a male 14 or more years old . In 1837, the Mexican state of Chihuahua also offered a bounty on Apache scalps, 100 pesos per warrior, 50 pesos per woman, and 25 pesos per child. Harris Worcester wrote: \\"The new policy attracted a diverse group of men, including Anglos, runaway slaves led by Seminole John Horse, and Indians ‚Äî Kirker used Delawares and Shawnees; others, such as Terrazas, used Tarahumaras; and Seminole Chief Coacoochee led a band of his own people who had fled from Indian Territory.\\" American Civil War Some scalping incidents even occurred during the American Civil War. For example, Confederate guerrillas led by \\"Bloody Bill\\" Anderson were well known for decorating their saddles with the scalps of Union soldiers they had killed. Archie Clement had the reputation of being Anderson's ‚Äúchief scalper‚Äù. Continued Indian Wars In 1851, the U.S. Army displayed Indian scalps in Stanislaus County, California. In Tehama County, California, U.S. military and local volunteers razed villages and scalped hundreds of men, women, and children. Scalping also occurred during the Sand Creek Massacre on November 29, 1864, during the American Indian Wars, when a 700-man force of U.S. Army volunteers destroyed the village of Cheyenne and Arapaho in southeastern Colorado Territory, killing and mutilating an estimated 70‚Äì163 Native Americans. An 1867 New York Times article reported that \\"settlers in a small town in Colorado Territory had recently subscribed $5,000 to a fund ‚Äòfor the purpose of buying Indian scalps (with $25 each to be paid for scalps with the ears on)‚Äô and that the market for Indian scalps ‚Äòis not affected by age or sex‚Äô.\\" The article noted this behavior was \\"sanctioned\\" by the U.S. federal government, and was modeled on patterns the U.S. had begun a century earlier in the \\"American East\\". From one writer's point of view, it was a \\"uniquely American\\" innovation that the use of scalp bounties in the wars against indigenous societies \\"became an indiscriminate killing process that deliberately targeted Indian non- combatants (including women, children, and infants), as well as warriors.\\" Image gallery File:Scalped Morrison.jpgScalped corpse of buffalo hunter Ralph Morrison found after an 1868 encounter with Cheyennes, near Fort Dodge, Kansas File:Frauensch√§del Regensburg-Harting.jpgSkull of a 20- to 30-year-old decapitated woman of the 3rd century CE.

It includes Moroccan, Algerian, Tunisian, Libyan, and Hassaniya Arabic. Speakers of Maghrebi Arabic are primarily Arab-Berbers who call their language Derdja, Derja, Derija or Darija (; meaning \\"common or everyday language\\"). This serves to differentiate the spoken vernacular from Standard Arabic. The Maltese language is believed to be derived from Siculo-Arabic and ultimately from Tunisian Arabic, as it contains some typical Maghrebi Arabic areal characteristics. Varieties * Varieties of Arabic * Pre-Hilalian Arabic dialects * Hilalian dialects * Koin√©s: ** Algerian Arabic ** Moroccan Arabic ** Tunisian Arabic ** Libyan Arabic ** Jebli Arabic ** Jijel Arabic ** Andalusian Arabic (extinct) ** Siculo-Arabic (extinct) *** Maltese language (descended from Sicilian Arabic, but influenced lexically by Tunisian, Libyan, Sicilian, Italian, French, and more recently, English) * Western Bedouin: ** Hassaniya Arabic ** Saharan Arabic Name Darija, Derija or Delja () means \\"everyday/colloquial language\\";Wehr, Hans: Dictionary of Modern Written Arabic (2011); Harrell, Richard S.: Dictionary of Moroccan Arabic (1966) it is also rendered as ', derija or darja. It refers to any of the varieties of colloquial Maghrebi Arabic. Although it is also common in Algeria and Tunisia to refer to the Maghrebi Arabic varieties directly as languages, similarly it is also common in Egypt and Lebanon to refer to the Mashriqi Arabic varieties directly as languages. For instance, Algerian Arabic would be referred as Dzayri (Algerian) and Tunisian Arabic as Tounsi (Tunisian), and Egyptian Arabic would be referred as Masri (Egyptian) and Lebanese Arabic as Lubnani (Lebanese). In contrast, the colloquial dialects of more eastern Arab countries, such as Egypt, Jordan and Sudan, are usually known as ' (), though Egyptians may also refer to their dialects as al-logha-d-darga. Characteristics The varieties of Maghrebi Arabic (Darija) have a significant degree of mutual intelligibility, especially between geographically adjacent ones (such as local dialects spoken in Eastern Morocco and Western Algeria or Eastern Algeria and North Tunisia or South Tunisia and Western Libya), but hardly between Moroccan and Tunisian Darija. Conversely, Moroccan Darija, Tunisian Derja and particularly Algerian Derja cannot be understood by Eastern Arabic speakers (from Egypt, Sudan, Levant, Iraq, and Arabian peninsula) in general as they derive from different substratums and a mixture of many languages (Berber, Latin (African Romance), Old Arabic, Turkish, French, Spanish, Mozarabic, Italian, and Niger-Congo languages). Some linguists like Charles A. Ferguson, William Mar√ßais consider Maghrebi Arabic Darija an independent language. Abdou Elimam, ¬´ Le maghribi, langue trois fois mill√©naire ¬ª, √©d. ANEP, Alger (1997)Abdou Elimam, ¬´ Le maghribi, alias ed- darija, langue consensuelle du Maghreb ¬ª, √©d. Dar El Gharb, Alger (2004) Maghrebi Arabic continues to evolve by integrating new French or English words, notably in technical fields, or by replacing old French and Italian/Spanish ones with Modern Standard Arabic words within some circles; more educated and upper-class people who code-switch between Maghrebi Arabic and Modern Standard Arabic have more French and Italian/Spanish loanwords, especially the latter came from the time of al-Andalus. Maghrebi dialects all use n- as the first-person singular prefix on verbs, distinguishing them from Levantine dialects and Modern Standard Arabic. Relationship with Modern Standard Arabic and Berber languages Modern Standard Arabic ( al-Fus·∏•ƒÅ) is the primary language used in the government, legislation and judiciary of countries in the Maghreb. Maghrebi Arabic is mainly a spoken and vernacular language, although it occasionally appears in entertainment and advertising in urban areas of Algeria, Morocco and Tunisia. In Algeria, where Maghrebi Arabic was taught as a separate subject under French colonization, some textbooks in the language exist but they are no longer officially endorsed by the Algerian authorities. Maghrebi Arabic contains a Berber substratum, which represents the languages originally spoken by the native populations of the Maghreb prior to their adoption of Arabic.Tilmatine Mohand, ¬´ Substrat et convergences : Le berb√®re et l'arabe nord-africain ¬ª, Estudios de dialectologia norteaafricana y andalusi, n¬∞4, 1999, pp. 99-119 The dialect may also possess a Punic substrate. Additionally, Maghrebi Arabic has a Latin substratum, which may have been derived from the African Romance that was used as an urban lingua franca during the Byzantine Empire period. Relationship with other languages Maghrebi Arabic speakers frequently borrow words from French (in Morocco, Algeria and Tunisia), Spanish (in northern Morocco) and Italian (in Libya and Tunisia) and conjugate them according to the rules of their dialects with some exceptions (like passive voice for example). Since it is not always written, there is no standard and it is free to change quickly and to pick up new vocabulary from neighbouring languages. This is somewhat similar to what happened to Middle English after the Norman conquest.

The chairs, curtains and walls are predominantly green. In show business, the green room is the space in a theatre or similar venue that functions as a waiting room and lounge for performers before, during and after a performance or show when they are not engaged on stage. Green rooms typically have seating for the performers, such as upholstered chairs and sofas. The origin of the term is often ascribed to such rooms historically being painted green.The American Heritage Dictionary of the English Language, William Morris editor, 1971Brewer's Dictionary of Phrase & Fable, Millennium Edition, revised by Adrian Room, 1999 Modern green rooms need not necessarily adhere to a specifically green color scheme, though the theatrical tradition of the name remains. Some English theatres contained several green rooms, each ranked according to the status, fame and salary of the actor: one could be fined for using a green room above one's station.The Concise Oxford Companion to the Theatre, edited by Phyllis Hartnoll, Oxford University Press, 1972, pg 220Old theatre days and ways By William John Lawrence via Google Books quoting in turn An Actor's Notebook by George Vandenhoff Possible sources of the term The green room at the Traverse Theatre, Edinburgh The definitive origin of the term is lost to history, which has led to many theories and claims, including: *One of the oldest stories is that London's Blackfriars Theatre (1599) included a room behind the scenes, which happened to be painted green; where the actors waited to go on stage. It was called \\"the green room\\". *A 1662 renovation of London's Cockpit-in-Court theatre included a green baize dressing room, which has been suggested as the origin of the term. *Richard Southern, in his studies of Medieval theatre in the round, states that in this period the acting area was referred to as the green. This central space, often grass-covered, was used by the actors, while the surrounding space and circular banks were occupied by the spectators. From this source then The Green has been a traditional actors' term for the stage. Even in proscenium arch theatres there was a tradition that a green stage cloth should be used for a tragedy. The green room could thus be considered the transition room on the way to the green/stage. Technical staff at some West End theatres (such as the London Coliseum) still refer to the stage as the green. *That such waiting rooms were originally painted green to \\"relieve the eyes from the glare of the stage.\\"Brewer's Dictionary of Phrase & Fable, Millennium Edition, Revised by Adrian Room On the other hand, early stage lighting was by candlelight and later by gaslight, so the \\"glare\\" might well be apocryphal, a modern reference to bright electric stage lighting. *It is sometimes said that the term green room was a response to limelight, though the name is merely a coincidence ‚Äì \\"limelight\\" refers to calcium oxide, not to the fruit or colour. Furthermore, limelight was invented in 1820 and the term \\"green room\\" was used many years prior to that. *It is possible that \\"green room\\" might be a corruption of scene room, the room where scenery was stored which doubled as the actors' waiting and warm-up room. *Many actors experience nervous anxiety before a performance and one of the symptoms of nervousness is nausea. As a person who feels nauseous is often said to look \\"green\\", suggesting that the \\"Green Room\\" is the place where the nervous actors wait. *Long before modern makeup was invented the actors had to apply makeup before a show and allow it to set up or cure before performing. Until the makeup was cured, it was green and people were advised to sit quietly in the green room until such time as the makeup was stable enough for performing. Uncured makeup is gone, but the green room lives on.Glossary of Technical Theatre Terms at theatrecrafts.com *In Shakespearean theatre actors would prepare for their performances in a room filled with plants and shrubs. It was believed that the moisture in the topiary was beneficial to the actors' voices. Thus the green room may refer to the green plants in this stage preparation area. *Comedian and dancer Max Wall attributes the phrase to Cockney rhyming slang, where greengage is stage, therefore greengage room is stage room and like most rhyming slang it gets shortened, hence green' room. Rhyming Slang can be traced only as early as the 1840s, whereas the phrase \\"green room\\" predates this by several centuries, making such an etymology unlikely. *Green is also thought to be a calming and soothing colour. *Green was the cheapest vaiety of paint, and theatre managers used it decorate a space used only by actors. \\"Tiring houses\\" In Shakespeare's day, the actors waited in a \\"tiring house\\" probably because actors were attired (put on or changed costumes) in this space.

During World War II, Flowers designed and built Colossus, the world's first programmable electronic computer, to help solve encrypted German messages. Early life Flowers was born at 160 Abbott Road, Poplar in London's East End on 22 December 1905, the son of a bricklayer. Whilst undertaking an apprenticeship in mechanical engineering at the Royal Arsenal, Woolwich, he took evening classes at the University of London to earn a degree in electrical engineering. In 1926, he joined the telecommunications branch of the General Post Office (GPO), moving to work at the research station at Dollis Hill in north-west London in 1930. In 1935, he married Eileen Margaret Green and the couple later had two children, John and Kenneth. From 1935 onward, he explored the use of electronics for telephone exchanges and by 1939, he was convinced that an all- electronic system was possible. A background in switching electronics would prove crucial for his computer designs. World War II Flowers' first contact with wartime codebreaking came in February 1941 when his director, W. Gordon Radley was asked for help by Alan Turing, who was working at Bletchley Park the government codebreaking establishment, north west of London in Buckinghamshire. Turing wanted Flowers to build a decoder for the relay-based Bombe machine, which Turing had developed to help decrypt German Enigma codes. The decoder project was abandoned but Turing was impressed with Flowers's work, and in February 1943 introduced him to Max Newman who was leading the effort to automate part of the cryptanalysis of the Lorenz cipher. This was a high-level German code generated by a teletypewriter in-line cipher machine, the Lorenz SZ40/42, one of their (secret writer) systems, called \\"Tunny\\" (tuna fish) by the British. It was a much more complex system than Enigma; the decoding procedure involved trying so many possibilities that it was impractical to do by hand. Flowers and Frank Morrell (also at Dollis Hill) designed the Heath Robinson, in an attempt to automate the cryptanalysis of the Lorenz SZ-40/42 cipher machine.Tommy Flowers Flowers proposed a more sophisticated alternative, using an electronic system, which his staff called Colossus, using perhaps 1,800 thermionic valves (vacuum tubes) instead of 150 and having only one paper tape instead of two (which required synchronisation) by generating the wheel patterns electronically. Because the most complicated previous electronic device had used about 150 valves, some were sceptical that the system would be reliable. Flowers countered that the British telephone system used thousands of valves and was reliable because the electronics were operated in a stable environment with the circuitry on all the time. The Bletchley management were not convinced and merely encouraged Flowers to proceed on his own.See interview of Flowers in PBS Nova \\"Decoding Nazi Secrets\\" 2015 He did so at the Post Office Research Labs, using some of his own funds to build it. Flowers had first met (and got on with) Turing in 1939 but was treated with disdain by Gordon Welchman, because of his advocacy of valves rather than relays. Welchman preferred the views of Wynn-Williams and Keene of the British Tabulating Machine Company (BTM) who had designed and constructed the Bombe and wanted Radley and \\"Mr Flowers of Dollis Hill\\" removed from work on Colossus for \\"squandering good valves\\". Despite the success of Colossus, the Heath Robinson approach was still valuable for solving certain problems. The final development of the concept was a machine called Super Robinson that was designed by Tommy Flowers. This one could run four tapes and was used for running depths and \\"cribs\\" or known-plaintext attack runs. On 2 June 1943, Flowers was made a member of the Order of the British Empire. Tony Sale (right) began a reconstruction of a Colossus at Bletchley Park. Here, in 2006, Sale supervises the breaking of an enciphered message with the completed machine. Flowers gained full backing for his project from the director of the Post Office Research Station at Dollis Hill, W. G. Radley. With the highest priority for acquisition of parts, Flowers's team at Dollis Hill built the first machine in eleven months. It was immediately dubbed 'Colossus' by the Bletchley Park staff for its immense proportions. The Mark 1 Colossus operated five times faster and was more flexible than the previous system, named Heath Robinson, which used electro- mechanical switches. The first Mark 1, with 1500 valves, ran at Dollis Hill in November 1943; it was delivered to Bletchley Park in January 1944 where it was assembled and began operation in early February.The Colossus Gallery  The National Museum of Computing The algorithms used by Colossus were developed by W. T. Tutte and his team of mathematicians.Biography of Professor Tutte  Combinatorics and Optimization  University of Waterloo Colossus proved to be efficient and quick against the twelve-rotor Lorenz cipher SZ42 machine. In anticipation of a need for additional computers, Flowers was already working on Colossus Mark 2 which would employ 2,400 valves. The first Mark 2 went into service at Bletchley Park on 1 June 1944 and immediately produced vital information for the imminent D-Day landings planned for Monday 5 June (postponed 24 hours by bad weather). Flowers later described a crucial meeting between Dwight D. Eisenhower and his staff on 5 June, during which a courier entered and handed Eisenhower a note summarising a Colossus decrypt. This confirmed that Adolf Hitler wanted no additional troops moved to Normandy, as he was still convinced that the preparations for the Normandy landings were a feint. Handing back the decrypt, Eisenhower announced to his staff, \\"We go tomorrow\\". Earlier, a report from Field Marshal Erwin Rommel on the western defences was decoded by Colossus and revealed that one of the sites chosen as the drop site for a US parachute division was the base for a German tank division and the site was changed. Years later, Flowers described the design and construction of the computers. Ten Colossi were completed and used during the Second World War in British decoding efforts and an eleventh was ready for commissioning at the end of the war. All but two were dismantled at the end of the war, \\"The remaining two were moved to a British Intelligence department, GCHQ in Cheltenham, Gloucestershire, where they may have played a significant part in the codebreaking operations of the Cold War\\". They were finally decommissioned in 1959 and 1960. A functioning Colossus Mark II was rebuilt by a team of volunteers led by Tony Sale between 1993 and 2008.coltalk_2 It is on display at The National Museum of Computing at Bletchley Park.Colossus computer conservationist Tony Sale dies - BBC News Front view of the Colossus rebuild showing, from right to left (1) The \\"bedstead\\" containing the message tape in its continuous loop and with a second one loaded.

Post-war work and retirement After the war, Flowers received little recognition for his contribution to cryptanalysis. The government granted him ¬£1,000 payment which did not cover Flowers' personal investment in the equipment; he shared much of the money amongst the staff who had helped him build and test Colossus. Flowers applied for a loan from the Bank of England to build another machine like Colossus but was denied the loan because the bank did not believe that such a machine could work. He could not argue that he had already designed and built many of these machines because his work on Colossus was covered by the Official Secrets Act. It was not until the 1970s that Flowers' work in computing was fully acknowledged. His family had known only that he had done some 'secret and important' work. He remained at the Post Office Research Station where he was Head of the Switching Division. He and his group pioneered work on all- electronic telephone exchanges, completing a basic design by about 1950, which led on to the Highgate Wood Telephone Exchange. He was also involved in the development of ERNIE. In 1964, he became head of the advanced development at Standard Telephones and Cables Ltd., where he continued to develop electronic telephone switching including a pulse amplitude modulation exchange, retiring in 1969. In 1976, he published Introduction to Exchange Systems, a book on the engineering principles of telephone exchanges. In 1977, Flowers was made an honorary Doctor of Science by Newcastle University. In 1980, he was the first winner of the Martlesham Medal in recognition of his achievements in computing. In 1993, he received a certificate from Hendon College, having completed a basic course in information processing on a personal computer. Flowers died in 1998 aged 92, leaving a wife and two sons. He is commemorated at the Post Office Research Station site, which became a housing development, with the main building converted into a block of flats and an access road called Flowers Close. He was honoured by London Borough of Tower Hamlets, where he was born. An Information and Communications Technology (ICT) centre for young people, the Tommy Flowers Centre, opened there in November 2010. The centre has closed but the building is now the Tommy Flowers Centre, part of the Tower Hamlets Pupil Referral Unit. In September 2012, his wartime diary was put on display at Bletchley Park. A road in Kesgrave, near the current BT Research Laboratories, is named Tommy Flowers Drive. On 12 December 2013, 70 years after he created Colossus, his legacy was honoured with a memorial commissioned by BT, successor to Post Office Telephones. The life-size bronze bust, designed by James Butler, was unveiled by Trevor Baylis at Adastral Park, BT's research and development centre in Martlesham Heath, near Ipswich, Suffolk. BT also began a computer science scholarship and award in his name. On 29 September 2016, BT opened the Tommy Flowers Institute for ICT training at Adastral Park to support the development of postgraduates transferring into industry. The institute focuses on bringing ICT-sector organisations together with academic researchers to solve some of the challenges facing UK businesses, exploring areas such as cybersecurity, big data, autonomics and converged networks. The launch event was attended by professors from Cambridge, Oxford, East Anglia, Essex, Imperial, UCL, Southampton, Surrey, and Lancaster as well as representatives from the National Physical Laboratory, Huawei, Ericsson, CISCO, ARM and ADVA. In 2018, a room in the newly refurbished Institution of Engineering and Technology in London was named the Flowers Room.

She was executed in the gas chamber at San Quentin Prison on the same day as two convicted accomplices, Jack Santo and Emmett Perkins, all of whom were involved in a robbery that led to the murder of an elderly widow. Nicknamed \\"Bloody Babs\\" by the press, Graham was the third woman in California to be executed by gas. Her story of adult criminal activity is told in the 1958 film I Want to Live!, in which she was portrayed by Susan Hayward, who won the Academy Award for Best Actress. Early life Graham was born Barbara Elaine Ford in Oakland, California to young, unwed mother Hortense Ford, who earned her living through prostitution. On February 23, 1925, Hortense, still unwed, gave birth to a second daughter, Claire Elizabeth. Hortense later married a man by the name of Joseph Wood, whose surname was then given to Barbara and Claire. Hortense had a child with Joseph, a son, Joseph Robert Wood, born on March 27, 1930. By the time this son was born, however, the father is said to have died. Hortense Ford Wood (1906‚Äì1989) was of Portuguese (Azorean) descent on her father's side, the original family name having been Furtado. When Graham was two, her mother, who was still in her late teens, was sent to reform school. Graham was raised by strangers and extended family, and, although intelligent, had a limited education. As a teenager, she was arrested for vagrancy and sentenced to serve time at Ventura State School for Girls, the same reform school where her mother had been. Released from reform school in 1939, Graham tried to make a new start for herself. She married Harry Kielhamer (1913‚Äì1993), a U.S. Coast Guardsman, in 1940, and enrolled in a business college and soon had her first two children. The marriage was not a success, and by 1942, she was divorced. Harry Kielhamer was awarded custody of their two sons. Over the next several years, she was married twice more, but each of these attempts at a more traditional lifestyle failed. After this string of failures, Graham is said to have become a worker in the sex trade, as her mother had before her: reportedly, during World War II, she plied her trade as what was known in some circles as a \\"seagull\\", or a prostitute who \\"flocked\\" in pairs or groups near naval bases. It is supposed that Graham began working near the Oakland Army Base, Oakland Naval Supply Depot, and Alameda Naval Air Station. In 1942, she and other \\"seagulls\\" traveled to Long Beach, California and San Diego. She was arrested on vice charges in these naval cities and in San Pedro, California. At 22, with her good looks, red hair, and sex appeal, she worked for a time in San Francisco for a brothel madam named Sally Stanford. She soon became involved in gambling and illegal drug circles, cultivating a number of friends who were ex-convicts and known career criminals. She served a five-year sentence for perjury as a false alibi witness for two petty criminals, and served her sentence at the California Women's State Prison at Tehachapi, California. After her stint in state prison, Graham moved to Reno, Nevada and then Tonopah, Nevada. She obtained work in a hospital and as a waitress, but soon got on a bus for Los Angeles. There, she got a room on Hollywood Boulevard and returned to prostitution. In 1953, she married Henry Graham, who worked as a bartender at one of her frequent haunts, with whom she had a third child, named Tommy. Murder of Mabel Monohan Henry Graham was addicted to illegal drugs and known as a hardened criminal. Through him, Barbara met his criminal friends Jack Santo and Emmett Perkins. She started an affair with Perkins, who told her about a 64-year-old widow, Mabel Monohan,California Death Index, Name: Mabel Monohan, Birth Date: 01-02-1889, Mother's Maiden: Duree, Sex: Female, Birth Place: Idaho, Death Place: Los Angeles (19), Death Date: 03-11-1953, Age: 64 yrs. who was alleged to keep a large amount of cash and jewelry in her home in Burbank, California. On March 9, 1953, Barbara Graham joined Perkins and Santo as well as John True and Baxter Shorter (two of their associates), in robbing Monohan's home in Burbank. Graham reportedly gained entry by asking to use her phone. Once Monohan opened the door for Graham, Perkins, Santo and True burst in, followed later by Shorter. The gang demanded money and jewels from Monohan, but she refused to give them anything. At this point, according to the statement and testimony of John True, Graham began viciously pistol-whipping Monohan, cracking her skull and then suffocating her to death with a pillow. The robbery attempt was a futile effort; the gang found nothing of value in the house and left empty-handed. They later learned that they had missed about $15,000 in jewels and valuables ($ today) stashed in a purse in the closet near where they had murdered Monohan. Arrest and conviction Baxter Shorter was arrested on another charge and gave the police details of the Monohan murder and attempted robbery. However, his statement was leaked and he was kidnapped and murdered by Perkins and Santo. Subsequently, John True agreed to become a state witness in exchange for immunity from prosecution. In court, True testified against Graham, who continually protested her innocence. The press nicknamed her \\"Bloody Babs\\", reflecting the public disgust for her alleged actions. Having no alibi, Graham doomed her own defense when she accepted another inmate's offer to pay $25,000 to the inmate and \\"a friend\\" who would provide a false alibi. The inmate, however, was working to reduce her own sentence, and the \\"friend\\", who offered to say he was with Graham the night of the murder, was a police officer. Meeting with Graham to plan the alibi story, he insisted that she admit to him that she had indeed been at the scene of the crime. The officer was recording the conversation. This attempt to suborn perjury, plus the recorded admission that she indeed had been at the scene of the widow Monohan's senselessly violent murder, abutted by her previous perjury conviction, completely destroyed Graham's credibility in court. When questioned about her actions at the trial, she said, \\"Oh, have you ever been desperate? Do you know what it means not to know what to do?\\" Graham ultimately was convicted, and the informant immediately was released from jail and had her sentence commuted to time served. Appeals and execution Graham, Santo, and Perkins were all sentenced to death for the robbery and murder. Graham appealed her sentence while at the California Institution for Women in Chino, California. Her appeals failed, and on June 2, 1955 she was transferred to San Quentin State Prison. On June 3, 1955, she was scheduled to be executed at 10:00 am, but that was stayed by California governor Goodwin J. Knight until 10:45 am. At 10:43 am, Knight stayed the execution until 11:30 am; Graham protested, \\"Why do they torture me? I was ready to go at ten o'clock.\\" At 11:28 am she was led from her cell and strapped in the gas chamber; she requested a blindfold so she would not have to look at the observers. Her last words were, \\"Good people are always so sure they're right.\\" Advised that taking a deep breath after the cyanide pellets were dropped would make her death easier, she replied \\"How the hell would you know, you silly rascal?\\"Los Angeles Times; March 28, 1990 COLUMN ONE : Last Steps, Last Words on the Row : California has put 501 men and women to death since the state took charge of executions.

In popular culture Actress Susan Hayward won the Best Actress Academy Award for playing Graham in the movie I Want to Live! (1958), which strongly suggests that Graham was innocent. However, much of the film is fictionalized; in particular, the presentation of the manner in which the police found and arrested Graham. Evidence clearly pointed to her guilt. Reporter Gene Blake, who covered Graham's murder trial for the Los Angeles Daily Mirror, dismissed the movie as \\"a dramatic and eloquent piece of propaganda for the abolition of the death penalty.\\" Los Angeles Herald-Express reporter Bill Walker also exposed the inaccuracies of the film in his article in the April 1959 issue of Cavalier, \\"Exposing Hollywood's 'I Want to Live' Hoax\\", and in a 1961 book titled The Case of Barbara Graham. Graham was portrayed by actress Lindsay Wagner in a 1983 TV movie of I Want to Live! The jazz/pop singer Nellie McKay had a touring production titled I Want To Live! that tells the story through standards, original tunes, and dramatic interludes. Barbara's case was featured on the 2nd episode of Season 4 in Deadly Women. In the dramatization, she is portrayed by Australian reporter, voice actress and film actress Lib Campbell.

The school has specialisms in languages and science. It is also a Leading Edge School, an ICT-Focus School, a Training School, an International School under the International Baccalaureate Organization (IBO) and a participant in the Primary Language Initiative. From September 2004 it offered some International Baccalaureate courses alongside its conventional secondary and sixth form courses, but these are now discontinued. Slough Secondary School (1912‚Äì36) Slough Secondary School was the name of the first major selective secondary school in Slough (originally Buckinghamshire but now Berkshire). It was founded in 1912 just to the west of William Street, in the town centre. By 1936, the School had outgrown its premises and was split into Slough Grammar School for boys (1936‚Äì82) in Lascelles Road and Slough High School for girls (1936‚Äì82) in Twinches Lane, although the girls stayed on in the William Street buildings until 1939 when their new buildings were ready. The original Slough Secondary School buildings in William Street were re-used during the Second World War and afterwards as temporary school accommodation. They were redeveloped in the 1960s as the tower blocks of Slough College, which became the Slough Campus of Thames Valley University. The area is being redeveloped again, under the Heart of Slough project. ;Headmasters # Mr W.

It was formed in 1936 from the split of Slough Secondary School (1912‚Äì36) into Slough Grammar School for boys (1936‚Äì82) and Slough High School for girls. For the first three years of its existence, it occupied the former Slough Secondary School buildings in William Street, but, in 1939, it moved to new buildings in Twinches Lane, Cippenham.

The school was given an overall rating of \\"Outstanding\\", although the Sixth Form was only rated \\"Good\\", with serious concerns raised over the number of students unable to progress from AS level to A2 level studies due to poor grades. Upton Court Grammar is known as a multicultural school that has achieved a remarkably happy coexistence of students from diverse ethnic backgrounds. The school is committed to its international school status, and to the understanding of other cultures as well as other languages. The 2008 OFSTED inspection report describes Slough Grammar as \\"outstanding\\" the 2011 OFSTED interim assessment confirms that the standards are unchanged, The IB courses offered put it into a different category for 6th form league tables. The IB results were strong in 2006 and this has had a slight knock on effect in reducing the overall grade spread at A level. , the IB courses have been discontinued.  Old Paludians  The term \\"Paludian\\" for former students of the school(s) is derived from the Latin word palus (genitive paludis), meaning a marsh or slough. The term was first coined by the Headmaster, W. Francis Smith, in 1915, when the Old Paludians Association was formed, and has been in continuous use ever since. \\"Old Paludians\\" is sometimes informally contracted to \\"Old Pals\\". In 1936, the Association split into the Boys (or Sports) section and the Girls section. By the 1950s, the Boys section reformed to become the Old Paludians Ltd. They moved to Taplow and nowadays play as Taplow United. Meanwhile, the Girls section became the current Old Paludians Association and organises annual reunions for former students - both boys and girls. ;Former students: *Steve Bell ‚Äì cartoonist *Jon Benjamin ‚Äì diplomat *Dr Jeremy Black (1951‚Äì2004) ‚Äì assyriologist *William Bradshaw, Baron Bradshaw *Cdre Laurie Brokenshire, CBE, RN (1952-2017) - puzzle specialist, magician *Susan Cooper - children's author *Lt Cdr.

It is divided into four areas called the P√©rigord Noir (Black), the P√©rigord Blanc (White), the P√©rigord Vert (Green) and the P√©rigord Pourpre (Purple). The geography and natural resources of P√©rigord make it an unspoiled region rich in history and wildlife, and the newly created Parc Naturel R√©gional P√©rigord-Limousin aims to conserve it as such. P√©rigord is noted for its cuisine, especially its duck and goose products, such as confit de canard and foie gras. It is known as a centre for truffles in France. P√©rigourdine wines include Bergerac (red and white) and Monbazillac. Geography P√©rigord surrounds and is named after the pr√©fecture (capital) of the Dordogne, P√©rigueux, and also includes Bergerac in the south and Sarlat in the east. History and prehistory There are Roman ruins in P√©rigueux which have been restored and the whole area is known as the 'cradle of mankind' due to its wealth of prehistoric sites, of which the most famous prehistoric site is the painted cave of Lascaux, whose depictions of aurochs, horses, deer and other animals (but not of humans) date back some 17,000 years. The centre of pre-historic studies is the small town of les Eyzies, home to the newly rebuilt Museum of Pre-History, where 19th century archaeological investigations established the valley of the V√©z√®re as an unusually rich array of pre-historic sites dating back some 40,000 years. One of UNESCO's World Heritage locations, the valley contains 147 prehistoric sites dating from the Palaeolithic era and 25 decorated caves. P√©rigord was one of the main battlegrounds of Hundred Years' War between the French and English in the 14th and 15th centuries. It is also the land of medieval and Renaissance castles like Puymartin, Losse, Hautefort and Beynac situated mainly along the Dordogne and V√©z√®re rivers. Other major castles include Jumilhac-le-Grand, F√©nelon, Biron, Bourdeilles, Castelnaud, Puyguilhem and Rouffiac (Angoisse). In popular culture A visit to the province inspired the English novelist Julia Stuart to write her novel The Matchmaker of P√©rigord.

It runs just under from Lock 1E at the rear of the University of Huddersfield campus, near Aspley Basin in Huddersfield, to the junction with the Ashton Canal at Whitelands Basin in Ashton-under-Lyne. It crosses the Pennines by means of 74 locks and the Standedge Tunnel. Building the Canal Planning The canal was first proposed in 1793 at a meeting in the George Hotel, Huddersfield. Its engineer was Benjamin Outram on the recommendation of William Jessop. His plan was to start from the Huddersfield Broad Canal and follow the River Colne with a climb of to its summit where it would pass through a tunnel at Standedge before descending through Saddleworth and the Tame valley to the Ashton Canal near Ashton-under-Lyne. There were many woollen, worsted and cotton mills along its route which promised ample trade. However, there was the possible problem of the loss of their water supplies and so Outram proposed to build a number of reservoirs. Construction Construction began in 1794 with the marking out of the route. The practice was to set up a line of pegs or stakes about apart so that their tops would indicate the intended water level. It would then be possible to construct the appropriate embankments and cuttings. As engineer, Outram provided an oversight of the work but he was also occupied by other projects. Day-to-day management was carried out by contractors employed and organised by the canal company committee. Progress was slow and erratic. It was also unfortunate that Outram was seriously ill for long periods between 1795 and 1797. The company was also short of money, partly because the costs had been seriously underestimated but also because shareholders were not honouring their pledges. In 1799, severe floods damaged earthworks along the canal and various reservoirs. In particular, overflow of the Tunnelend Reservoir devastated the village of Marsden. Two aqueducts were also destroyed, diverting the company's already-stretched funds. The Stakes Aqueduct was already in use and had to be replaced immediately. Outram had built it of stone and, due to its low height, it had needed to be constructed in four short spans. The narrow openings had impeded the unprecedented overflow and Outram replaced it with a single span cast iron structure, similar to the Holmes Aqueduct on the Derby Canal. Outram's Stakes aqueduct at Stalybridge Outram set out to overcome the problems with the Holmes Aqueduct by making the walls thicker where they joined the baseplates which were also thicker. However a major stress was the compressive force along the top of the wall plates where they bow outwards or inwards. In 1875 cross bracings were added to reinforce it. The Stakes Aqueduct is the oldest surviving aqueduct of its type that is still in use for its original purpose. The Standedge Tunnel Eastern portal Although the canal uses 74 locks to climb and descend the Pennines, there would have had to be many more without the digging of a very long tunnel through the Tame/Colne watershed (the River Colne flowing down to Huddersfield and the River Calder, and the Tame flowing down to Stockport and the River Mersey). The canal tunnel is long making it the longest canal tunnel in the United Kingdom. It is largely brick lined but in some places the tunnel has been left with a natural rock surface. The \\"Black Flood\\" In 1810, the Diggle Moss Reservoir gave way and Marsden was again flooded along with much of the Colne Valley. Houses and factories were wrecked and five people lost their lives. The force of the water was such that a fifteen-ton rock was carried down the valley. Completion Despite multiple problems, the building of the Huddersfield Narrow Canal showed that the technique of quantity surveying had advanced greatly. Thomas Telford's report during the construction of the Standedge Tunnel covered every expenditure to the last bucket; it was followed to the letter and the canal finally opened in 1811. Operation Share of the operator Huddersfield Canal Company, issued 1. March 1805 The canal operated for approximately 140 years. Although it was moderately successful for a while, its width (limited to boats less than wide), the large number of locks and the long Standedge Tunnel made it much less profitable than its main rival the Rochdale Canal which had a similar number of locks but was twice as wide with no long tunnel. Standedge Tunnel proved to be a bottleneck having been constructed without a towpath. Narrowboats had to be 'legged' through, eventually by professionally employed leggers. A company employee would chain the tunnel entrance behind a convoy of boats and walk over Boat Lane, accompanied by boat boys and girls leading the boat horses, to unchain the opposite end of the tunnel before the boat convoy arrived. This journey was made at least twice per day for over twenty years. The construction of a double railway tunnel parallel to Standedge canal tunnel adversely affected canal revenues and the canal was mostly abandoned in 1944 (a short stretch in Huddersfield survived until closure in 1963). Restoration After 27 years of campaigning and restoration by the Huddersfield Canal Society, the canal was fully re-opened to navigation in 2001 when it again became one of three Pennine crossings, the others being the Rochdale and the Leeds and Liverpool (both broad canals). The canal is now entirely used by leisure boaters. During the period of time when the canal was closed, several lengths were culverted and infilled and in some cases built over. Over the course of the restoration project, the vast majority of the obliterated line became available to be opened out again and the canal remains on a substantially identical alignment with some minor alterations. Huddersfield The Huddersfield Narrow Canal connects with the Huddersfield Broad Canal at the eastern end of Lock 1E. Lock 1E is to the west of the A629 Wakefield Road and the canal had been filled in beneath the road. A new bridge was built in 1985 but the width was only sufficient for narrowboats and so the section of broad canal from the bridge to Lock 1E is not accessible to vessels wider than . The bridge thus forms the effective, but unofficial, boundary between the Huddersfield Narrow Canal and the Huddersfield Broad Canal. Due to a legal quirk, the stretch of the canal from Lock 1E to Queen Street South Bridge was not included in the original abandonment of the canal. Whilst locks on the remainder of the canal were capped, cascaded or demolished, locks 1E and 2E remained gated but eventually fell into dereliction. The old gates were only removed when canal restoration work started. Two factories, Bates and Sellers Engineering, had been built immediately upstream of locks 2E and 3E respectively on the line of the canal and blocking it. In each case, the solution was the same: the lock was relocated upstream of the factory and a tunnel constructed below the factory. This avoided disruption to the firms using the sites. The remodelling of the canal can be clearly seen between the former site of Lock 2E and Queen Street South Bridge where a framework of girders sits above the channel to ensure that the deep piling remains secure. Eleven years later, Sellers Engineering relocated to a new site. This enabled Lock 3E to be relocated again, this time to a site near the original Lock 3E.

Restoration caused some local controversy as it involved the felling of a row of mature cherry trees which had been planted along the infilled line although the local authority claimed that the trees were in poor condition and were unlikely to last for many more years in any case. Lock 21E was relocated a short distance upstream, to the other side of Platt Lane, in order to ensure that the Platt Lane crossing could be achieved by a conventional bridge instead of the swing bridge that had existed prior to closure. The stretch from 22E to 23E threads its way through an extremely tight space. Britannia Road Bridge was formerly hump backed but changes in traffic levels since closure rendered such a bridge impractical and instead the pound from 22E to 23E was lowered by . Hartshead Power Station Electricity Pylon straddling the canal at Stalybridge On the western side of the Pennines, the canal runs through the legs of an electricity pylon at Heyrod, near Stalybridge. The pylon had been erected during the period when the canal was closed and the only viable route for restoration was through the legs. No other such cases are known on navigable waterways worldwide although other pylons have been constructed across former waterways that have been filled in with rubble and soil such as the Manchester, Bolton and Bury Canal and Wey and Arun Canal at Rowner Lock. The canal today The canal is part of the South Pennine Ring crossing the Pennines twice - the other crossing is the Rochdale Canal. The canals are linked at the western (Lancashire) end by the Ashton Canal and at the eastern (Yorkshire) end by the Huddersfield Broad Canal and a length of the Calder and Hebble Navigation.

It was operated by the UCLA plasma physics laboratory from 1986 through 2007. A unique capability at that time, it could radiate 70 MW ERP at either 2.85 MHz or 4.53 MHz. These frequencies are close to a multiple of 2 and 3 of the electron gyro-frequency at ionospheric altitudes. Sending a pulse of HF-radio waves upward could accelerate the electrons in the ionosphere. Somewhat like waves on the ocean, the character of the ionosphere could be inferred from the backscatter signal. Other experiments attempted to combine RF and visible excitation where the latter probed metal ions such as sodium. The HIPAS facility also used a LIDAR (LIght Detection And Ranging) instrument. Other projects included: * A plasma torch, used for experiments in hazardous waste disposal * A 2.8-meter liquid-mirror telescope, which uses a spinning bowl of mercury to form the mirror, used for laser experiments. * An array of antennae, which are used for exciting the ionosphere.

She was the host of Australia's Next Top Model, Lovable Intimates, Mount Franklin Lightly Sparkling and Range Rover, and formerly the face of Australian department store Myer. She is the founder and CEO of two successful brands, Cozi by Jennifer Hawkins swimwear and Jbronze tanning line, and manages a portfolio of properties.  Early life  Hawkins was born in Holmesville, New South Wales, to Gail and Robert, and currently resides in Sydney. She attended West Wallsend High School in West Wallsend, New South Wales. She is one of four siblings. Hawkins was a cheerleader for the Newcastle Knights rugby league team, and the Hunter Pirates basketball team and also worked as a model. It was as a model that she was cast as Miss Australia for the Miss Universe competition. Hawkins also worked as a choreographer for a dance team that toured Australia specialising in Hip Hop and Ballet. On October 22, 2019, she announced that she had given birth to a baby girl named Frankie Violet.  Career   Miss Universe  Before participating in Miss Universe 2004, Hawkins sought advice from the previous Miss Australia, Ashlea Talbot, who represented Australia in the 2003 competition, and learned basic Spanish prior to travelling to Ecuador. However, Hawkins did not participate as Miss Australia but as the newly instated pageant Miss Universe Australia's first winner. The Miss Universe pageant was held in Quito, Ecuador, on 1 June 2004. A week prior to the event, Hawkins was ranked sixth favourite to win the crown. During the final competition, she became the first Australian to make the semi-finals since Voni Delfos in 1993. She then proceeded to the top ten after competing in the evening gown competition, where she wore an unusual vintage copper gown that was designed by Bora and cost A$25,000. After the swimsuit competition, Hawkins advanced to the top five, and eventually won the Miss Universe title. The remaining top five were all delegates from the Americas and Caribbean, including Shandi Finnessey of the USA (1st runner-up), Alba Reyes of Puerto Rico (2nd runner-up), Yanina Gonzalez of Paraguay (3rd runner-up) and Danielle Jones of Trinidad and Tobago (4th runner-up). Hawkins was the second winner from Oceania since Lorraine Downes of New Zealand held the title in 1983, and the second Australian since Kerry Anne Wells who was crowned in Dorado, Puerto Rico in 1972 (Coincidentally both women were crowned in Spanish speaking countries). Hawkins was crowned by outgoing titleholder Amelia Vega from the Dominican Republic, after being announced by host Billy Bush as the \\"thunder from down under\\". Hawkins received an elaborate Mikimoto pearl encrusted crown, worth $250,000, as well as an extensive prize package. Hawkins was the first blonde-haired woman to win the title since Angela Visser of the Netherlands in 1989. As Miss Universe, Hawkins represented the Miss Universe Organization.

As part of her year-long reign as Miss Universe, she lived in New York City in a riverside apartment provided by the Miss Universe Organization. At this time, Hawkins stated that her wish was to continue modelling and become a television presenter. Shortly after being crowned Miss Universe in 2004, Hawkins created news during a fashion show at Westfield Miranda, an Australian shopping centre, when she tripped on the hem of her dress, which fell to the floor. Hawkins was left scantily clad in her red g-string in front of a surprised crowd. Hawkins later apologised, laughingly adding she \\"wished she wore better underwear\\". The incident received the dubious distinction of being named \\"The most embarrassing moment ever shown on Australian television\\"on the 20 to 1 episode Most Embarrassing Moments by Australia's Nine Network. The \\"wardrobe malfunction\\" was widely circulated through news outlets and according to Google, caused a sharp increase in internet searches for \\"Jennifer Hawkins\\". Hawkins served as a judge for the Miss Universe 2008 finals in Vietnam.  Television presenting  Hawkins signed a contract with the Seven Network at the 2004 Melbourne Cup Carnival. Her first appearances were as a guest presenter on the network's travel show, The Great Outdoors, where she took viewers on tours throughout the world. When she ended her reign as Miss Universe, she became a regular presenter on the show, which resulted in a 2006 Logie nomination for Most Popular New Female Talent. No new episodes of the programme have been produced since 2009. Hawkins also served as the host and one of the judges for Australia's Make Me a Supermodel, which debuted on the Seven Network in August 2008. The series aired for a single season.

The sermon consists of a series of general exhortations for Muslims to follow the teachings that Muhammad had set forth in the Quran and sunnah. Narrations in hadith literature In a lengthy hadith included in the Sahih Muslim, Sunan Abi Dawood, and Sunan Ibn Majah, Jabir ibn Abd Allah narrated details of Muhammad's pilgrimage and reported the following words of his sermon: Sahih Muslim Book 15, Hadith 159 Sunan al-Tirmidhi Vol. 1, Book 7, Hadith 1163 Sunan ibn Maja Vol. 3, Book 9, Hadith 1851 Report by historian Ibn Ishaq An account of the sermon was collected by the early historian Ibn Ishaq, as quoted in Ibn Hisham's Sirah an-Nabawiyah and at-Tabari's Tarikh, with minor differences.

It is run entirely by volunteers and has no full-time staff.  History and aims  The organisation was founded in 1976 as the Train Travellers Association, and became prominent after the controversial Lonie Report recommended huge freeway expansion and closure of most public passenger transport in the city. The Association advocates a greater role for public transport and less dependence on the private car. Key PTUA policies include: * A publicly accountable authority to provide co-ordinated planning and management of train, tram and bus services, * The favouring of sustainable transport modes over cars, through appropriate urban planning decisions, and taxation and transport project resource allocations, * Opposition to major road expansion such as the building of new freeways, * More frequent public transport services, longer operating hours and better connections between modes, * Expansion of the train, tram, and bus networks, * More staffing at stations and on trains/trams, * Fares that ensure public transport is competitive with car travel. Of particular interest to the Association are potential extensions to Melbourne's metropolitan rail network, particularly lines to Doncaster, Rowville (via Monash University's Clayton Campus) and Melbourne Airport, a reorganisation of the bus network, including more routes being upgraded to SmartBus status, and filling in so-called tram \\"missing links\\", by the construction of modest extensions to the tram network that will ensure that routes terminate at nearby railway stations, bus routes and activity centres.  Achievements  The PTUA successfully campaigned for extended New Year's Day public transport hours in 2004,How Melbourne got all-night NYE public transport YouTube video 03:23 in length and that has been continued by the state government in subsequent years. They also successfully lobbied for the extension of the 109 tram to Box Hill in Melbourne's east.

Such a possibility was pointed out by the physicist Lev Landau and his colleagues.Lev Landau, in The fact that couplings depend on the momentum (or length) scale is the central idea behind the renormalization group. Landau poles appear in theories that are not asymptotically free, such as quantum electrodynamics (QED) or theory‚Äîa scalar field with a quartic interaction‚Äîsuch as may describe the Higgs boson. In these theories, the renormalized coupling constant grows with energy. A Landau pole appears when the coupling becomes infinite at a finite energy scale. In a theory purporting to be complete, this could be considered a mathematical inconsistency. A possible solution is that the renormalized charge could go to zero as the cut-off is removed, meaning that the charge is completely screened by quantum fluctuations (vacuum polarization). This is a case of quantum triviality, which means that quantum corrections completely suppress the interactions in the absence of a cut-off. Since the Landau pole is normally identified through perturbative one-loop or two-loop calculations, it is possible that the pole is merely a sign that the perturbative approximation breaks down at strong coupling. Perturbation theory may also be invalid if non-adiabatic states exist. Lattice gauge theory provides a means to address questions in quantum field theory beyond the realm of perturbation theory, and thus has been used to attempt to resolve this question. Numerical computations performed in this framework seems to confirm Landau's conclusion that QED charge is completely screened for an infinite cutoff. Brief history According to Landau, Abrikosov, and Khalatnikov,L. D. Landau, A. A. Abrikosov, and I. M. Khalatnikov, Dokl. Akad. Nauk SSSR 95, 497, 773, 1177 (1954). the relation of the observable charge to the ‚Äúbare‚Äù charge for renormalizable field theories when is given by : g_\\\\text{obs}=\\\\frac{g_0}{1+\\\\beta_2 g_0 \\\\ln \\\\Lambda/m} \\\\qquad\\\\qquad\\\\qquad (1) where is the mass of the particle and is the momentum cut-off. If and then and the theory looks trivial. In fact, inverting Eq.1, so that (related to the length scale ) reveals an accurate value of , : g_0=\\\\frac{g_\\\\text{obs}}{1-\\\\beta_2 g_\\\\text{obs} \\\\ln \\\\Lambda/m}. \\\\qquad\\\\qquad\\\\qquad (2) As grows, the bare charge increases, to finally diverge at the renormalization point : \\\\Lambda_\\\\text{Landau} = m \\\\exp\\\\left\\\\\\\\{ \\\\frac{1}{\\\\beta_2 g_\\\\text{obs}} \\\\right\\\\\\\\}.\\\\qquad\\\\qquad\\\\qquad (3) This singularity is the Landau pole with a negative residue, . In fact, however, the growth of invalidates Eqs.1,2 in the region , since these were obtained for , so that the nonperturbative existence of the Landau pole becomes questionable. The actual behavior of the charge as a function of the momentum scale is determined by the Gell-Mann‚ÄìLow equation : \\\\frac{dg}{d \\\\ln \\\\mu} =\\\\beta(g)=\\\\beta_2 g^2+\\\\beta_3 g^3+\\\\ldots \\\\qquad\\\\qquad\\\\qquad (4) which gives Eqs.1,2 if it is integrated under conditions for and for , when only the term with is retained in the right hand side. The general behavior of depends on the appearance of the function . According to the classification of Bogoliubov and Shirkov,N. N. Bogoliubov and D. V. Shirkov, Introduction to the Theory of Quantized Fields, 3rd ed. (Nauka, Moscow, 1976; Wiley, New York, 1980). there are three qualitatively different cases: *(a) if has a zero at the finite value , then growth of is saturated, i.e. for ; *(b) if is non-alternating and behaves as with for large , then the growth of continues to infinity; *(c) if with for large , then is divergent at finite value and the real Landau pole arises: the theory is internally inconsistent due to indeterminacy of for . Landau and Pomeranchuk L.D.Landau, I.Ya.Pomeranchuk, Dokl. Akad. Nauk SSSR 102, 489 (1955); I.Ya.Pomeranchuk, Dokl. Akad. Nauk SSSR 103, 1005 (1955). tried to justify the possibility (c) in the case of QED and theory. They have noted that the growth of in Eq.1 drives the observable charge to the constant limit, which does not depend on . The same behavior can be obtained from the functional integrals, omitting the quadratic terms in the action. If neglecting the quadratic terms is valid already for , it is all the more valid for of the order or greater than unity: it gives a reason to consider Eq.1 to be valid for arbitrary . Validity of these considerations at the quantitative level is excluded by the non-quadratic form of the -function. Nevertheless, they can be correct qualitatively. Indeed, the result can be obtained from the functional integrals only for , while its validity for , based on Eq.1, may be related to other reasons; for this result is probably violated but coincidence of two constant values in the order of magnitude can be expected from the matching condition. The Monte Carlo results seems to confirm the qualitative validity of the Landau‚ÄìPomeranchuk arguments, although a different interpretation is also possible. The case (c) in the Bogoliubov and Shirkov classification corresponds to the quantum triviality in full theory (beyond its perturbation context), as can be seen by a reductio ad absurdum. Indeed, if , the theory is internally inconsistent. The only way to avoid it, is for , which is possible only for . It is a widespread belief that both QED and theory are trivial in the continuum limit.  Phenomenological aspects  In a theory intended to represent a physical interaction where the coupling constant is known to be non-zero, Landau poles or triviality may be viewed as a sign of incompleteness in the theory. For example, QED is usually not believed to be a complete theory on its own and contains a Landau pole. Conventionally QED forms part of the more fundamental electroweak theory. The group of electroweak theory also has a Landau pole which is usually considered to be a signal of a need for an ultimate embedding into a Grand Unified Theory. The grand unified scale would provide a natural cutoff well below the Landau scale, preventing the pole from having observable physical consequences. The problem of the Landau pole in QED is of pure academic interest, for the following reason. The role of in Eqs. 1, 2 is played by the fine structure constant and the Landau scale for QED is estimated as 10286 eV, which is far beyond any energy scale relevant to observable physics. For comparison, the maximum energies accessible at the Large Hadron Collider are of order 1013 eV, while the Planck scale, at which quantum gravity becomes important and the relevance of quantum field theory itself may be questioned, is 1028 eV. The Higgs boson in the Standard Model of particle physics is described by theory (see Quartic interaction). If the latter has a Landau pole, then this fact is used in setting a \\"triviality bound\\" on the Higgs mass. The bound depends on the scale at which new physics is assumed to enter and the maximum value of the quartic coupling permitted (its physical value is unknown). For large couplings, non-perturbative methods are required. Lattice calculations have also been useful in this context.For example, , which suggests .  Connections with statistical physics  A deeper understanding of the physical meaning and generalization of the renormalization process leading to Landau poles comes from condensed matter physics. Leo P. Kadanoff's paper in 1966 proposed the \\"block-spin\\" renormalization group.L.P. Kadanoff (1966): \\"Scaling laws for Ising models near T_c\\", Physics (Long Island City, N.Y.) 2, 263. The blocking idea is a way to define the components of the theory at large distances as aggregates of components at shorter distances. This approach was developed by Kenneth Wilson.K.G. Wilson(1975): The renormalization group: critical phenomena and the Kondo problem, Rev. Mod. Phys. 47, 4, 773. He was awarded the Nobel prize for these decisive contributions in 1982. Assume that we have a theory described by a certain function Z of the state variables \\\\\\\\{s_i\\\\\\\\} and a set of coupling constants \\\\\\\\{J_k\\\\\\\\}. This function can be a partition function, an action, or a Hamiltonian. Consider a certain blocking transformation of the state variables \\\\\\\\{s_i\\\\\\\\}\\\\to \\\\\\\\{\\\\tilde s_i\\\\\\\\}, the number of \\\\tilde s_i must be lower than the number of s_i. Now let us try to rewrite the Z function only in terms of the \\\\tilde s_i. If this is achievable by a certain change in the parameters, \\\\\\\\{J_k\\\\\\\\}\\\\to \\\\\\\\{\\\\tilde J_k\\\\\\\\}, then the theory is said to be renormalizable. The most important information in the RG flow are its fixed points. The possible macroscopic states of the system, at a large scale, are given by this set of fixed points. If these fixed points correspond to a free field theory, the theory is said to exhibit quantum triviality, and possesses a Landau pole. Numerous fixed points appear in the study of lattice Higgs theories, but it is not known whether these correspond to free field theories.  Large order perturbative calculations  Solution of the Landau pole problem requires the calculation of the Gell-Mann‚ÄìLow function at arbitrary and, in particular, its asymptotic behavior for . Diagrammatic calculations allow one to obtain only a few expansion coefficients , which do not allow one to investigate the function in the whole. Progress became possible after the development of the Lipatov method for calculating large orders of perturbation theory:L.N.Lipatov, Zh.Eksp.Teor.Fiz. 72, 411 (1977) [Sov.Phys. JETP 45, 216 (1977)]. One may now try to interpolate the known coefficients with their large order behavior, and to then sum the perturbation series. The first attempts of reconstruction of the function by this method bear on the triviality of the theory. Application of more advanced summation methods yielded the exponent in the asymptotic behavior , a value close to unity. The hypothesis for the asymptotic behavior of was recently presented analytically for theory and QED. Together with positiveness of , obtained by summation of the series, it suggests case (b) of the above Bogoliubov and Shirkov classification, and hence the absence of the Landau pole in these theories, assuming perturbation theory is valid (but see above discussion in the introduction ).

In North America, custard pie commonly refers to a plain mixture of milk, eggs, sugar, salt, vanilla extract and sometimes nutmeg combined with a pie crust. It is distinctly different from a cream pie, which contains cooked custard poured into a cooled, precooked crust. In the United Kingdom, the comical or political act of pieing is conventionally done with a \\"custard pie\\". Some common custard pies include pumpkin pie, lemon and buttermilk chess pie, coconut cream pie, and buko pie. True custard is defined as a liquid thickened with eggs. Due to the often large number of whole eggs in custard pie it is a very rich pie. The Ancient Romans were the first to understand the binding properties of eggs. During the Middle Ages, the first custard pies, as we know them, began to appear. Initially, custards were used only as fillings for pies, pastries and tarts. Both Europe and Asia had recipes that contained custards. The word custard is derived from ‚Äòcrustade‚Äô which is a tart with a crust. After the 16th century, custards began to be used in individual dishes rather than as a filling in crusts. Today, custards are used as filling in pies and tarts, and as individual dishes. Ideally a custard pie should be light and delicate, but still have good body. Custards can be made in two ways: baked or stirred upon the stove, but most custard pie recipes call for baking. The eggs in custard mixtures, when cooked, turn from liquid to solid. If cooked over excessive heat, the eggs will curdle, which is extremely undesirable. Curdling can be prevented by using lower temperatures and stirring. As such, making true custard pie is a very delicate process. History Savory pies with meat fillings were far more common than sweet pies in the Cuisine of the Thirteen Colonies. Sweet pies, when they were available, were made with a simple custard base of fresh milk, sugar and eggs. Some of these traditional pies like buttermilk pie, almond custard, Irish potato pie and bean pie (associated with the Nation of Islam) are uncommon in modern times.

Speedball is a dangerous mixture, often more so than the sum of the parts due to drug synergy. The original speedball used cocaine hydrochloride mixed with morphine sulfate, as opposed to heroin. Speedball may also use pharmaceutical opioids, benzodiazepines, or barbiturates along with stimulants. However, since opioids and sedative-hypnotics have different objective and subjective effects, stimulant‚Äìnonopioid mixtures are known by the slang term \\"set up\\". A cocktail of drugs containing an opioid can cause a strong physical dependence and withdrawal symptoms. Physiological response Cocaine acts as a stimulant, whereas heroin/morphine acts as a depressant. Co- administration is meant to provide an intense rush of euphoria with a high that is supposed to combine the effects of both drugs, while hoping to reduce the negative effects, such as anxiety, hypertension, palpitations and other common side effects of stimulants and sedation/drowsiness from the depressant. While this is somewhat effective, as one drug (the CNS stimulant) triggers the sympathetic nervous system and the other (the CNS depressant) triggers the parasympathetic nervous system, the two systems that regulate the fight-or- flight and rest-and-digest responses, respectively, and simultaneous activity of the two pathways is what normally keeps one's body in natural homeostasis, there is an imperfect overlap in the effects of stimulants and depressants. Additionally, by suppressing the typical negative side-effects of the two drugs, the user may falsely believe they have a higher tolerance, or that they are less intoxicated than they actually are. This can cause users to misjudge the intake of one or both of the drugs, sometimes fatally. Because the stimulant effects of cocaine wear off far more quickly than the depressant effects of heroin or morphine, fatal respiratory depression often occurs when the full effects of a heroin or morphine overdosage are felt in isolation. Due to the countering effect of the cocaine, a fatally high opioid dose can be unwittingly administered without immediate incapacitation, thus providing a false sense of tolerance until it is too late.

(1965).Soviet physicist Lev Davidovich Landau (1908‚Äì68), is the effect of damping (exponential decrease as a function of time) of longitudinal space charge waves in plasma or a similar environment.Chen, Francis F. Introduction to Plasma Physics and Controlled Fusion. Second Ed., 1984 Plenum Press, New York. This phenomenon prevents an instability from developing, and creates a region of stability in the parameter space. It was later argued by Donald Lynden-Bell that a similar phenomenon was occurring in galactic dynamics, where the gas of electrons interacting by electrostatic forces is replaced by a \\"gas of stars\\" interacting by gravitational forces.Binney, J., and Tremaine, S. Galactic Dynamics, second ed. Princeton Series in Astrophysics. Princeton University Press, 2008. Landau damping can be manipulated exactly in numerical simulations such as particle-in-cell simulation. It was proved to exist experimentally by Malmberg and Wharton in 1964, almost two decades after its prediction by Landau in 1946.  Wave‚Äìparticle interactions  Landau damping occurs because of the energy exchange between an electromagnetic wave with phase velocity v_\\\\text{ph} and particles in the plasma with velocity approximately equal to v_\\\\text{ph}, which can interact strongly with the wave. Those particles having velocities slightly less than v_\\\\text{ph} will be accelerated by the electric field of the wave to move with the wave phase velocity, while those particles with velocities slightly greater than v_\\\\text{ph} will be decelerated losing energy to the wave: particles tend to synchronize with the wave. This is proved experimentally with a Traveling-wave tube. thumb In an ideal MHD plasma the particle velocities are often taken to be approximately a Maxwellian distribution function. If the slope of the function is negative, the number of particles with velocities slightly less than the wave phase velocity is greater than the number of particles with velocities slightly greater. Hence, there are more particles gaining energy from the wave than losing to the wave, which leads to wave damping. If, however, the slope of the function is positive, the number of particles with velocities slightly less than the wave phase velocity is smaller than the number of particles with velocities slightly greater. Hence, there are more particles losing energy to the wave than gaining from the wave, which leads to a resultant increase in the wave energy.  Physical interpretation  The mathematical theory of Landau damping is somewhat involved‚Äîsee the section below. However, there is a simple physical interpretation [introduced in section 7.5 of with a caveat], which, though not strictly correct, helps to visualize this phenomenon. thumb It is possible to imagine Langmuir waves as waves in the sea, and the particles as surfers trying to catch the wave, all moving in the same direction. If the surfer is moving on the water surface at a velocity slightly less than the waves he will eventually be caught and pushed along the wave (gaining energy), while a surfer moving slightly faster than a wave will be pushing on the wave as he moves uphill (losing energy to the wave). It is worth noting that only the surfers are playing an important role in this energy interactions with the waves; a beachball floating on the water (zero velocity) will go up and down as the wave goes by, not gaining energy at all. Also, a boat that moves very fast (faster than the waves) does not exchange much energy with the wave. A simple mechanical description of particle dynamics provides a quantitative estimate of the synchronization of particles with the wave [Equation (1) of ]. A more rigorous approach shows the strongest synchronization occurs for particles with a velocity in the wave frame proportional to the damping rate and independent of the wave amplitude [section 4.1.3 of ]. Since Landau damping occurs for waves with arbitrarily small amplitudes, this shows the most active particles in this damping are far from being trapped. This is natural, since trapping involves diverging time scales for such waves (specifically T_\\\\text{trap} \\\\sim A^{-1/2} for a wave amplitude A).  Theoretical physics: perturbation theory in a Vlasovian frame  Theoretical treatment starts with the Vlasov equation in the non-relativistic zero- magnetic field limit, the Vlasov‚ÄìPoisson set of equations. Explicit solutions are obtained in the limit of a small E-field. The distribution function f and field E are expanded in a series: f=f_0(v)+f_1(x,v,t)+f_2(x,v,t), E=E_1(x,t)+E_2(x,t) and terms of equal order are collected. To first order the Vlasov‚ÄìPoisson equations read :(\\\\partial_t + v\\\\partial_x)f_1 + {e\\\\over m}E_1 f'_0 = 0, \\\\quad \\\\partial_x E_1 = {e\\\\over \\\\epsilon_0} \\\\int f_1 \\\\mathrm{d}v. Landau calculated the wave caused by an initial disturbance f_1(x,v,0) = g(v)\\\\exp(ikx) and found by aid of Laplace transform and contour integration a damped travelling wave of the form \\\\exp[ik(x-v_\\\\text{ph}t)-\\\\gamma t] with wave number k and damping decrement :\\\\gamma\\\\approx-{\\\\pi\\\\omega_p^3 \\\\over 2k^2N} f'_0(v_\\\\text{ph}), \\\\quad N = \\\\int f_0 \\\\mathrm{d}v. Here \\\\omega_p is the plasma oscillation frequency and N is the electron density. Later Nico van Kampen provedvan Kampen, N. G., \\"On the theory of stationary waves in plasma\\", Physica 21 (1955), 949‚Äì963. See http://theor.jinr.ru/~kuzemsky/kampenbio.html that the same result can be obtained with Fourier transform. He showed that the linearized Vlasov‚ÄìPoisson equations have a continuous spectrum of singular normal modes, now known as van Kampen modes :\\\\frac{\\\\omega_p^2}{kN} f'_0 \\\\frac{\\\\mathcal P}{kv-\\\\omega} + \\\\epsilon \\\\delta\\\\left(v-\\\\frac{\\\\omega}{k}\\\\right) in which \\\\mathcal P signifies principal value, \\\\delta is the delta function (see generalized function) and :\\\\epsilon = 1 + \\\\frac{\\\\omega_p^2}{kN} \\\\int f'_0 \\\\frac{\\\\mathcal P}{\\\\omega-kv} \\\\mathrm{d}v is the plasma permittivity. Decomposing the initial disturbance in these modes he obtained the Fourier spectrum of the resulting wave. Damping is explained by phase-mixing of these Fourier modes with slightly different frequencies near \\\\omega_p. It was not clear how damping could occur in a collisionless plasma: where does the wave energy go? In fluid theory, in which the plasma is modeled as a dispersive dielectric medium,Landau, L. D. and Lifshitz, E. M., Electrodynamics of Continuous Media ¬ß80, Pergamon Press (1984). the energy of Langmuir waves is known: field energy multiplied by the Brillouin factor \\\\partial_\\\\omega(\\\\omega\\\\epsilon). But damping cannot be derived in this model. To calculate energy exchange of the wave with resonant electrons, Vlasov plasma theory has to be expanded to second order and problems about suitable initial conditions and secular terms arise. thumb In Ref.Best, Robert W. B., \\"Energy and momentum density of a Landau-damped wave packet\\", J. Plasma Phys. 63 (2000), 371-391 these problems are studied. Because calculations for an infinite wave are deficient in second order, a wave packet is analysed. Second-order initial conditions are found that suppress secular behavior and excite a wave packet of which the energy agrees with fluid theory. The figure shows the energy density of a wave packet traveling at the group velocity, its energy being carried away by electrons moving at the phase velocity. Total energy, the area under the curves, is conserved.  Mathematical theory: the Cauchy problem for perturbative solutions  The rigorous mathematical theory is based on solving the Cauchy problem for the evolution equation (here the partial differential Vlasov‚ÄìPoisson equation) and proving estimates on the solution. First a rather complete linearized mathematical theory has been developed since Landau.See for instance Backus, G. \\"Linearized plasma oscillations in arbitrary electron distributions\\". J. Math. Phys. 1 (1960), 178‚Äì191, 559. Degond, P. \\"Spectral theory of the linearized Vlasov‚ÄìPoisson equation\\". Trans. Amer. Math. Soc. 294, 2 (1986), 435‚Äì453. Maslov, V. P., and Fedoryuk, M. V. \\"The linear theory of Landau damping.\\" Mat. Sb. (N.S.) 127(169), 4 (1985), 445‚Äì475, 559. Going beyond the linearized equation and dealing with the nonlinearity has been a longstanding problem in the mathematical theory of Landau damping. Previously one mathematical result at the non-linear level was the existence of a class of exponentially damped solutions of the Vlasov‚ÄìPoisson equation in a circle which had been proved in by means of a scattering technique (this result has been recently extended inHwang, H. J. and Velasquez J. J. L. \\"On the Existence of Exponentially Decreasing Solutions of the Nonlinear Landau Damping Problem\\", Indiana Univ. Math. J. 68, 6 (2009), 2623‚Äì2660). However these existence results do not say anything about which initial data could lead to such damped solutions. In a recent paperMouhot, C., and Villani, C. \\"On Landau damping\\", Acta Math. 207, 1 (2011), 29‚Äì201 (quoted for the Fields Medal awarded to C√©dric Villani in 2010) the initial data issue is solved and Landau damping is mathematically established for the first time for the non-linear Vlasov equation. It is proved that solutions starting in some neighborhood (for the analytic or Gevrey topology) of a linearly stable homogeneous stationary solution are (orbitally) stable for all times and are damped globally in time. The damping phenomenon is reinterpreted in terms of transfer of regularity of f as a function of x and v, respectively, rather than exchanges of energy. Large scale variations pass into variations of smaller and smaller scale in velocity space, corresponding to a shift of the Fourier spectrum of f as a function of v. This shift, well known in linear theory, proves to hold in the non-linear case.  Theoretical physics: perturbation theory in an N-body frame  An expression of plasma permittivity analogous to the above one, but corresponding to the Laplace transform used by Landau, can be obtained simply in an N-body frame. One considers a (one-component) plasma where only electrons are present as particles, and ions just provide a uniform neutralizing background. The principle of the calculation is provided by considering the fictitious linearized motion of a single particle in a single Fourier component of its own electric field. The full calculation boils down to a summation of the corresponding result over all N particles and all Fourier components. The Vlasovian expression for the plasma permittivity is finally recovered by substituting an integral over a smooth distribution function for the discrete sum over the particles in the N-body plasma permittivity. Together with Landau damping, this mechanical approach also provides the calculation of Debye shielding, or Electric-field screening, in a plasma.

The current franchise is operated by Keolis Downer. As at May 2014, Yarra Trams operate 487 trams, across 26 tram routes and a free City Circle tourist tram, over 1,763 tram stops. With 250 km (155.3 mi) of double track, Melbourne's tram network is the largest in the world. In 2015/16, 203.8 million journeys were taken on Melbourne's trams, with trams traveling more than 24.8 million kilometres annually.

They are leased from the Commonwealth Bank, rather than VicTrack.Rattlers one day, combino the next The Age 24 November 2002 Heritage W-class trams run solely on the City Circle tourist service. Due to these trams being limited to as a result of a series of modifications due to braking problems, their use is restricted to ensure limited interference with modern trams. In 2003, Yarra Trams trialled a seating layout which became known as \\"Apollo\\". The trial involved removing 30 seats from a B-class tram and replacing the removed seats with \\"bum racks\\" which are found in Citadis trams. This resulted in a higher capacity for standing passengers on crowded services during peak hours. A further ten trams received the seating layout during refurbishment. Ninety E-class are being delivered by Bombardier Transportation, Dandenong. Ticketing Yarra Trams run under the Public Transport Victoria banner, as do other operators of public transport franchises in metropolitan Melbourne, and use the myki ticketing system. Metcard tickets have not been accepted on trams since December 2012, and coin-only Metcard ticket machines and validators have been removed. Seats were installed in place of the ticket machines. The entire tram network has now changed over to the myki smartcard fare collection system, with passengers needing to buy and top up a valid myki before boarding, or risk a fine of up to $238. Myki cards can be purchased from all staffed railway stations and retail outlets displaying a myki logo, including at all 7-Eleven convenience stores. They cannot be purchased or topped up on board a tram. All tram routes operate entirely within zone 1. However, routes 75, 86 and 109 enter the zone 1/2 overlap at the very end of their outer-suburban routes. If a passenger begins and ends their journey completely within the zone 1/2 overlap, they can touch off to receive a slightly lower fare. If any part of the journey is within Zone 1, there is no need for the passenger to touch off as the fare is automatically calculated. Touching off on a zone 1 journey is both redundant and may cause delay or inconvenience to other passengers and the tram networks 'on time' performance. If passengers only travel in the free tram zone, there is no need to touch on their myki. Network expansion New platform stop under construction Since privatisation, the tram network has grown in size as a result of a number of extensions. The accessibility of the network has also been improved, with 360 platform stops built as of January 2014. In March 2000 services were extended to the new Melbourne Docklands precinct. Since then, a line connecting La Trobe and Flinders Streets via Docklands has been constructed as well as a further extension along Docklands Drive to NewQuay, which opened in January 2005. route 109 was extended from Mont Albert to Box Hill in May 2003. The extension to Box Hill has provided a direct link between Box Hill and suburbs such as Balwyn, Kew and Richmond. In July 2005, a extension of route 75 from Burwood East to Vermont South opened. In April 2018, the state government announced a new extension of the tram network from Caulfield. The 18 km (11.1 mi) extension would serve Chadstone, Monash University, Waverley Park and Rowville. The state government allocated $3 million to plan the route, which would be carried out in two stages. Think Tram Full-time tram lane Yarra Trams is a partner in the Think Tram program with VicRoads, aimed at improving tram travel time and reliability. In conjunction with the Victorian government several initiatives are in place to enable trams to better meet punctuality targets. These include 'T-lights' which give trams priority at traffic signals, as well as part-time tram lanes and full-time tram lanes. Part-time tram lanes are used often only during peak hours, with an example of this being on High Street along the route 6. Vehicles must not enter a part-time tram lane at any point during the nominated times except to avoid an obstruction, or perform a right turn; even then, vehicles must not proceed by law into the lane to do so unless they will not delay any approaching tram/s from either direction. The limit for staying in the lane to avoid an obstruction or turn right is 50 metres, at which point a vehicle must exit the lane entirely. Full-time tram lanes often utilise raised curb dividers to physically prevent cars from straying onto tram tracks. Examples of these dividers can be seen on Spencer Street, Swanston Street in Carlton and Fitzroy Street in St Kilda. Vehicles must not enter a full-time tram lane at any time except to avoid an obstruction; even then, vehicles must not proceed by law into the lane to do so unless they will not delay any approaching tram/s from either direction. The limit for staying in the lane to avoid an obstruction is 50 metres, at which point a vehicle must exit the lane entirely. Some lanes only allow this to occur at certain points, or breaks, in the raised dividers. Crossing the raised dividers otherwise can cause severe damage to a vehicle. Beware the Rhino D2 promoting the 'Beware the Rhino' campaign in 2012 In May 2011, Yarra Trams launched their 'Beware The Rhino' safety campaign, aiming to increase awareness of tram traffic. It analogises a stampede of rhinoceroses as being as dangerous as a tram, highlighting the dangers that people put themselves in when they move into the path of a tram. The campaign has won creativity awards, and was refocused in 2013. Legislation and governance  Transport Integration Act The prime transport-related statute in Victoria is the Transport Integration Act 2010, which establishes the Department of Transport as the integration agency for Victoria's transport system. The Act also establishes and sets the charters of the state agencies charged with providing public transport rail services, namely the Public Transport Development Authority. The PTDA is empowered by the Transport Integration Act to contract transport operators to provide rail and bus services and has used those powers to contract Yarra Trams to provide tram services in Melbourne.Transport Integration Act 2010], section 68(2)(b). In addition, the Transport Integration Act establishes VicTrack which owns the public rail network and associated infrastructure. Another important statute is the Rail Management Act 1996 which confers powers on rail operators and provides for an access scheme for the state's rail network. The Transport (Compliance and Miscellaneous Act) 1983 is also a relevant statute relating to public transport and contains a number of offences relating to safety, ticketing and amenity. Rail Safety Act The safety of rail transport operations in Melbourne is regulated by the Rail Safety Act 2006 which applies to all commercial passenger operations. The Act establishes a framework containing safety duties for all rail industry participants and requires operators who manage infrastructure and rolling stock to obtain accreditation prior to commencing operations. Accredited operators are also required to have a safety management system to guide their operations. Sanctions applying to the safety scheme established under the Rail Safety Act are contained in the Transport (Compliance and Miscellaneous) Act 1983. The safety regulator for the rail system in Melbourne including trams is the Director, Transport Safety (trading as Transport Safety Victoria) whose office is established under the Transport Integration Act 2010.

The poem survives only in the Exeter Book, a manuscript of Old English poetry compiled in the late 10th century containing approximately one- sixth of all surviving Old English poetry. Widsith is located between the poems Vainglory and The Fortunes of Men. Since the donation of the Exeter Book in 1076, it has been housed in Exeter Cathedral in southwestern England. The poem is for the most part a survey of the people, kings, and heroes of Europe in the Heroic Age of Northern Europe. Date of original composition There is some controversy as to when Widsith was first composed. Some historians, such as John Niles, argue that the work was invented after King Alfred's rule to present \\"a common glorious past\\", while others such as Kemp Malone have argued that the piece is an authentic transcription of old heroic songs. Among the works appearing in the Exeter Book, there are none quite like Widsith, which may be by far the oldest extant work that gives a historical account of the Battle of the Goths and the Huns, recounted as legends in later Scandinavian works such as the Hervarar saga. Archaeologist Lotte Hedeager argues that Widsith goes back to Migration Age history--at least part of it was composed in the 6th century, and that the author demonstrates familiarity with regions outside of Britain, including Denmark and the Baltic coast. Hedeager is here in agreement with R.H. Hodgkinsee R.H. Hodgkin, A History of the Anglo-Saxons, vol. I, 3rd ed. (Oxford University Pr., 1952), page 29 and Leonard Neidorf, who argues that \\"when situated within the history of Anglo- Saxon culture and identity, Widsith clearly belongs to a time prior to the formation of a collective Anglo-Saxon identity, when distinct continental origins were remembered and maintained by the Germanic migrants in the British Isles [...] Widsith is a very old poem.\\"Leonard Neidorf, \\"The Dating of Widsith and the Study of Germanic Antiquity,\\" Neophilologus (January 2013) Contents Excluding the introduction of the scop Widsith, the closing, and brief comments regarded by some scholars as interpolations, the poem is divided into three 'catalogues', so-called thulas. The first thula runs through a list of the various kings of renown, both contemporary and ancient (\\"Caesar ruled the Greeks\\"), the model being '(name of a king) ruled (name of a tribe)'. The second thula contains the names of the peoples the narrator visited, the model being 'With the (name of a tribe) I was, and with the (name of another tribe).' In the third and final thula, the narrator lists the heroes of myth and legend that he has visited, with the model '(Hero's name) I sought and (hero's name) and (hero's name).' The poem refers to a group of people called the Wicinga cynn, which may be the earliest mention of the word \\"Viking\\" (lines 47, 59, 80). It closes with a brief comment on the importance and fame offered by poets like Widsith, with many pointed reminders of the munificent generosity offered to tale-singers by patrons \\"discerning of songs.\\" The widely travelled poet Widsith (his name simply means \\"far journey\\") claims himself to be of the house of the Myrgings, who had first set out in the retinue of \\"Ealhild, the beloved weaver of peace, from the east out of Angeln to the home of the king of the glorious Goths, Eormanric, the cruel troth-breaker.\\" The Ostrogoth Eormanric was defeated by the Huns in the 5th century. It is moot whether Widsith literally intends himself, or poetically means his lineage, either as a Myrging or as a poet, as when \\"the fictive speaker Deor uses the rhetoric of first-person address to insert himself into the same legendary world that he evokes in the earlier parts of the poem through his allusions to Weland the smith, Theodoric the Goth, Eormanric the Goth, and other legendary figures of the Germanic past.\\" Historically, we know that one speaker could not travel to see all of these nations in one lifetime. In a similar vein, \\"I was with the Lidwicingas, the Leonas and the Langobards,\\" Widsith boasts, with heathens and heroes and with the Hundingas. I was with the Israelites and with the Assyrians, with the Hebrews and the Indians and with the Egyptians... The forests of the VistulaViscla, 7 BC by Marcus Vipsanius Agrippa on Porticus Vipsania in the ancient writing tradition (Widsith, v. 121) are the homeland of the Goths, the material remains of which are generally associated with the Wielbark Culture.\\"Die Wilkinensage: Schl√ºssel zur unbekannten Fr√ºhgeschichte der Niederlande und Belgiens.\\" Thidrekssaga-Forum E.V. 2006. p. 129 The poem that is now similarly titled Deor, also from the Exeter Book, draws on similar material.

In Feynman diagrams, which serve to calculate the rate of collisions in quantum field theory, virtual particles contribute their propagator to the rate of the scattering event described by the respective diagram. These may also be viewed as the inverse of the wave operator appropriate to the particle, and are, therefore, often called (causal) Green's functions (called \\"causal\\" to distinguish it from the elliptic Laplacian Green's function).The mathematics of PDEs and the wave equation, p 32., Michael P.

Non-relativistic propagators In non-relativistic quantum mechanics, the propagator gives the probability amplitude for a particle to travel from one spatial point at one time to another spatial point at a later time. Consider a system with Hamiltonian . The Green's function (fundamental solution) for the Schr√∂dinger equation is a function :G(x,t;x',t') = \\\\frac{1}{i\\\\hbar}\\\\Theta(t-t')K(x,t;x',t') satisfying :\\\\left( i\\\\hbar \\\\frac{\\\\partial}{\\\\partial t} -H_x \\\\right) G(x,t;x',t') = \\\\delta(x-x')\\\\delta(t-t') ~, where denotes the Hamiltonian written in terms of the coordinates, denotes the Dirac delta-function, is the Heaviside step function and is the kernel of the above Schr√∂dinger differential operator in the big parentheses. The term propagator is sometimes used in this context to refer to , and sometimes to . This article will use the term to refer to (cf. Duhamel's principle). This propagator may also be written as the transition amplitude :K(x,t;x',t') = \\\\left \\\\langle x \\\\mid \\\\hat{U}(t,t') \\\\mid x'\\\\right \\\\rangle, where is the unitary time-evolution operator for the system taking states at time to states at time . Note the initial condition enforced by \\\\lim_{t\\\\to t'} K(x,t;x',t') = \\\\delta(x-x') . The quantum mechanical propagator may also be found by using a path integral, :K(x,t;x',t') = \\\\int \\\\exp \\\\left[\\\\frac{i}{\\\\hbar} \\\\int_t^{t'} L(\\\\dot{q},q,t) \\\\, dt\\\\right] D[q(t)] where the boundary conditions of the path integral include . Here denotes the Lagrangian of the system. The paths that are summed over move only forwards in time, and are integrated with the differential D[q(t)] which follows the path in time. In non-relativistic quantum mechanics, the propagator lets one find the wave function of a system, given an initial wave function and a time interval. The new wave function is specified by the equation :\\\\psi(x,t) = \\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^\\\\infty \\\\psi(x',t') K(x,t; x', t') \\\\, dx' ~. If only depends on the difference , this is a convolution of the initial wave function and the propagator. Basic examples: propagator of free particle and harmonic oscillator For a time-translationally invariant system, the propagator only depends on the time difference , so it may be rewritten as :K(x,t;x',t')=K(x,x';t-t'). The propagator of a one-dimensional free particle, with the far-right expression obtained via saddle-point methods, is then =\\\\left(\\\\frac{m}{2\\\\pi i\\\\hbar t}\\\\right)^{\\\\frac{1}{2}}e^{-\\\\frac{m(x-x')^2}{2i\\\\hbar t}}. cellpadding= 6 border border colour = #0073CF bgcolor=#F9FFF7}} Similarly, the propagator of a one-dimensional quantum harmonic oscillator is the Mehler kernel,E.

For the -dimensional case, the propagator can be simply obtained by the product :K(\\\\vec{x},\\\\vec{x}';t)=\\\\prod_{q=1}^N K(x_q,x_q';t)~. Relativistic propagators In relativistic quantum mechanics and quantum field theory the propagators are Lorentz invariant. They give the amplitude for a particle to travel between two spacetime points. Scalar propagator In quantum field theory, the theory of a free (non-interacting) scalar field is a useful and simple example which serves to illustrate the concepts needed for more complicated theories. It describes spin zero particles. There are a number of possible propagators for free scalar field theory. We now describe the most common ones.  Position space  The position space propagators are Green's functions for the Klein‚ÄìGordon equation. This means they are functions which satisfy :(\\\\square_x + m^2)G(x,y)=-\\\\delta(x-y) where: * are two points in Minkowski spacetime. * \\\\square_x = \\\\tfrac{\\\\partial^2}{\\\\partial t^2} - abla^2 is the d'Alembertian operator acting on the coordinates. * is the Dirac delta-function. (As typical in relativistic quantum field theory calculations, we use units where the speed of light, , and Planck's reduced constant, , are set to unity.) We shall restrict attention to 4-dimensional Minkowski spacetime. We can perform a Fourier transform of the equation for the propagator, obtaining :\\\\left(-p^2 + m^2 \\\\right )G(p)=-1. This equation can be inverted in the sense of distributions noting that the equation has the solution, (see Sokhotski-Plemelj theorem) :f(x)= \\\\frac{1}{x\\\\pm i\\\\varepsilon} = \\\\frac{1}{x}\\\\mp i\\\\pi\\\\delta(x), with implying the limit to zero. Below, we discuss the right choice of the sign arising from causality requirements. The solution is {p^2 - m^2\\\\pm i\\\\varepsilon} ~, cellpadding= 6 border border colour = #0073CF bgcolor=#F9FFF7}} where :p(x-y):= p_0(x^0-y^0) - \\\\vec{p} \\\\cdot (\\\\vec{x}-\\\\vec{y}) is the 4-vector inner product. The different choices for how to deform the integration contour in the above expression lead to various forms for the propagator. The choice of contour is usually phrased in terms of the p_0 integral. The integrand then has two poles at :p_0 = \\\\pm \\\\sqrt{\\\\vec{p}^2 + m^2} so different choices of how to avoid these lead to different propagators. = Causal propagators = Retarded propagator Image:CausalRetardedPropagatorPath.svg A contour going clockwise over both poles gives the causal retarded propagator. This is zero if is spacelike or if (i.e. if is to the future of ). This choice of contour is equivalent to calculating the limit, :G_\\\\text{ret}(x,y) = \\\\lim_{\\\\varepsilon \\\\to 0} \\\\frac{1}{(2 \\\\pi)^4} \\\\int d^4p \\\\, \\\\frac{e^{-ip(x-y)}}{(p_0+i\\\\varepsilon)^2 - \\\\vec{p}^2 - m^2} = -\\\\frac{\\\\Theta(x-y)}{2\\\\pi} \\\\delta(\\\\tau_{xy}^2) + \\\\Theta(x-y)\\\\Theta(\\\\tau_{xy}^2)\\\\frac{m J_1(m \\\\tau_{xy})}{4 \\\\pi \\\\tau_{xy}} Here :\\\\Theta (x) := \\\\begin{cases} 1 & x \\\\ge 0 \\\\\\\\\\\\ 0 & x < 0 \\\\end{cases} is the Heaviside step function and :\\\\tau_{xy}:= \\\\sqrt{ (x^0 - y^0)^2 - (\\\\vec{x} - \\\\vec{y})^2} is the proper time from to and J_1 is a Bessel function of the first kind. The expression y \\\\prec x means causally precedes which, for Minkowski spacetime, means :y^0 < x^0 and \\\\tau_{xy}^2 \\\\geq 0 ~. This expression can be related to the vacuum expectation value of the commutator of the free scalar field operator, :G_\\\\text{ret}(x,y) = i \\\\langle 0 \\\\left[ \\\\Phi(x), \\\\Phi(y) \\\\right] 0\\\\rangle \\\\Theta(x^0 - y^0) where :\\\\left[\\\\Phi(x),\\\\Phi(y) \\\\right]:= \\\\Phi(x) \\\\Phi(y) - \\\\Phi(y) \\\\Phi(x) is the commutator. Advanced propagator Image:CausalAdvancedPropagatorPath.svg A contour going anti-clockwise under both poles gives the causal advanced propagator. This is zero if is spacelike or if (i.e. if is to the past of ). This choice of contour is equivalent to calculating the limit : G_\\\\text{adv}(x,y) = \\\\lim_{\\\\varepsilon \\\\to 0} \\\\frac{1}{(2\\\\pi)^4} \\\\int d^4p \\\\, \\\\frac{e^{-ip(x-y)}}{(p_0 - i\\\\varepsilon)^2 - \\\\vec{p}^2 - m^2} = -\\\\frac{\\\\Theta(y-x)}{2\\\\pi}\\\\delta(\\\\tau_{xy}^2) + \\\\Theta(y-x)\\\\Theta(\\\\tau_{xy}^2)\\\\frac{m J_1(m \\\\tau_{xy})}{4 \\\\pi \\\\tau_{xy}} This expression can also be expressed in terms of the vacuum expectation value of the commutator of the free scalar field. In this case, :G_\\\\text{adv}(x,y) = -i \\\\langle 0\\\\left[ \\\\Phi(x), \\\\Phi(y) \\\\right]0\\\\rangle \\\\Theta(y^0 - x^0)~. =Feynman propagator= Image:FeynmanPropagatorPath.svg A contour going under the left pole and over the right pole gives the Feynman propagator. This choice of contour is equivalent to calculating the limitHuang, p. 30 :G_F(x,y) = \\\\lim_{\\\\varepsilon \\\\to 0} \\\\frac{1}{(2 \\\\pi)^4} \\\\int d^4p \\\\, \\\\frac{e^{-ip(x-y)}}{p^2 - m^2 + i\\\\varepsilon} = \\\\begin{cases} -\\\\frac{1}{4 \\\\pi} \\\\delta(s) + \\\\frac{m}{8 \\\\pi \\\\sqrt{s}} H_1^{(1)}(m \\\\sqrt{s}) & s \\\\geq 0 \\\\\\\\\\\\ -\\\\frac{i m}{ 4 \\\\pi^2 \\\\sqrt{-s}} K_1(m \\\\sqrt{-s}) & s < 0.\\\\end{cases} Here :s:= (x^0 - y^0)^2 - (\\\\vec{x} - \\\\vec{y})^2, where and are two points in Minkowski spacetime, and the dot in the exponent is a four-vector inner product. is a Hankel function and is a modified Bessel function. This expression can be derived directly from the field theory as the vacuum expectation value of the time-ordered product of the free scalar field, that is, the product always taken such that the time ordering of the spacetime points is the same, : \\\\begin{align} G_F(x-y) & = -i \\\\lang 0T(\\\\Phi(x) \\\\Phi(y))0 \\\\rang \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\[4pt] & = -i \\\\left \\\\lang 0 \\\\left [\\\\Theta(x^0 - y^0) \\\\Phi(x)\\\\Phi(y) + \\\\Theta(y^0 - x^0) \\\\Phi(y)\\\\Phi(x) \\\\right] 0 \\\\right \\\\rang. \\\\end{align} This expression is Lorentz invariant, as long as the field operators commute with one another when the points and are separated by a spacelike interval. The usual derivation is to insert a complete set of single-particle momentum states between the fields with Lorentz covariant normalization, and then to show that the functions providing the causal time ordering may be obtained by a contour integral along the energy axis, if the integrand is as above (hence the infinitesimal imaginary part), to move the pole off the real line. The propagator may also be derived using the path integral formulation of quantum theory. Momentum space propagator The Fourier transform of the position space propagators can be thought of as propagators in momentum space. These take a much simpler form than the position space propagators. They are often written with an explicit term although this is understood to be a reminder about which integration contour is appropriate (see above). This term is included to incorporate boundary conditions and causality (see below). For a 4-momentum the causal and Feynman propagators in momentum space are: :\\\\tilde{G}_\\\\text{ret}(p) = \\\\frac{1}{(p_0+i\\\\varepsilon)^2 - \\\\vec{p}^2 - m^2} :\\\\tilde{G}_\\\\text{adv}(p) = \\\\frac{1}{(p_0-i\\\\varepsilon)^2 - \\\\vec{p}^2 - m^2} :\\\\tilde{G}_F(p) = \\\\frac{1}{p^2 - m^2 + i\\\\varepsilon}. For purposes of Feynman diagram calculations, it is usually convenient to write these with an additional overall factor of (conventions vary). Faster than light? The Feynman propagator has some properties that seem baffling at first. In particular, unlike the commutator, the propagator is nonzero outside of the light cone, though it falls off rapidly for spacelike intervals. Interpreted as an amplitude for particle motion, this translates to the virtual particle travelling faster than light. It is not immediately obvious how this can be reconciled with causality: can we use faster-than-light virtual particles to send faster-than-light messages? The answer is no: while in classical mechanics the intervals along which particles and causal effects can travel are the same, this is no longer true in quantum field theory, where it is commutators that determine which operators can affect one another. So what does the spacelike part of the propagator represent? In QFT the vacuum is an active participant, and particle numbers and field values are related by an uncertainty principle; field values are uncertain even for particle number zero. There is a nonzero probability amplitude to find a significant fluctuation in the vacuum value of the field if one measures it locally (or, to be more precise, if one measures an operator obtained by averaging the field over a small region). Furthermore, the dynamics of the fields tend to favor spatially correlated fluctuations to some extent. The nonzero time- ordered product for spacelike-separated fields then just measures the amplitude for a nonlocal correlation in these vacuum fluctuations, analogous to an EPR correlation. Indeed, the propagator is often called a two-point correlation function for the free field. Since, by the postulates of quantum field theory, all observable operators commute with each other at spacelike separation, messages can no more be sent through these correlations than they can through any other EPR correlations; the correlations are in random variables. Regarding virtual particles, the propagator at spacelike separation can be thought of as a means of calculating the amplitude for creating a virtual particle-antiparticle pair that eventually disappears into the vacuum, or for detecting a virtual pair emerging from the vacuum. In Feynman's language, such creation and annihilation processes are equivalent to a virtual particle wandering backward and forward through time, which can take it outside of the light cone. However, no signaling back in time is allowed. =Explanation using limits= This can be made clearer by writing the propagator in the following form for a massless photon, : G^\\\\varepsilon_F(x,y) = \\\\frac{\\\\varepsilon}{ (x-y)^2 + i \\\\varepsilon^2 } ~. This is the usual definition but normalised by a factor of \\\\varepsilon. Then the rule is that one only takes the limit \\\\varepsilon \\\\rightarrow 0 at the end of a calculation. One sees that : G^\\\\varepsilon_F(x,y) = \\\\frac{1}{\\\\varepsilon} if (x-y)^2=0 and : \\\\lim_{\\\\varepsilon \\\\rightarrow 0} G^\\\\varepsilon_F(x,y) = 0 if (x-y)^2 eq 0 Hence this means a single photon will always stay on the light cone. It is also shown that the total probability for a photon at any time must be normalised by the reciprocal of the following factor: : \\\\lim_{\\\\varepsilon \\\\rightarrow 0}\\\\int \\\\leftG^\\\\varepsilon_F(0,x) \\\\right^2 \\\\, dx^3 = \\\\lim_{\\\\varepsilon \\\\rightarrow 0}\\\\int \\\\frac{\\\\varepsilon^2}{ (\\\\mathbf{x}^2-t^2)^2 + \\\\varepsilon^4 } \\\\, dx^3 = 2 \\\\pi^2 t ~. We see that the parts outside the light cone usually are zero in the limit and only are important in Feynman diagrams. Propagators in Feynman diagrams The most common use of the propagator is in calculating probability amplitudes for particle interactions using Feynman diagrams. These calculations are usually carried out in momentum space. In general, the amplitude gets a factor of the propagator for every internal line, that is, every line that does not represent an incoming or outgoing particle in the initial or final state. It will also get a factor proportional to, and similar in form to, an interaction term in the theory's Lagrangian for every internal vertex where lines meet. These prescriptions are known as Feynman rules. Internal lines correspond to virtual particles. Since the propagator does not vanish for combinations of energy and momentum disallowed by the classical equations of motion, we say that the virtual particles are allowed to be off shell. In fact, since the propagator is obtained by inverting the wave equation, in general, it will have singularities on the shell. The energy carried by the particle in the propagator can even be negative. This can be interpreted simply as the case in which, instead of a particle going one way, its antiparticle is going the other way, and therefore carrying an opposing flow of positive energy. The propagator encompasses both possibilities. It does mean that one has to be careful about minus signs for the case of fermions, whose propagators are not even functions in the energy and momentum (see below). Virtual particles conserve energy and momentum. However, since they can be off the shell, wherever the diagram contains a closed loop, the energies and momenta of the virtual particles participating in the loop will be partly unconstrained, since a change in a quantity for one particle in the loop can be balanced by an equal and opposite change in another. Therefore, every loop in a Feynman diagram requires an integral over a continuum of possible energies and momenta. In general, these integrals of products of propagators can diverge, a situation that must be handled by the process of renormalization. Other theories = Spin = If the particle possesses spin then its propagator is in general somewhat more complicated, as it will involve the particle's spin or polarization indices. The differential equation satisfied by the propagator for a spin particle is given by :(i ot abla' - m)S_F(x', x) = I_4\\\\delta^4(x'-x), where is the unit matrix in four dimensions, and employing the Feynman slash notation. This is the Dirac equation for a delta function source in spacetime. Using the momentum representation, :S_F(x', x) = \\\\int\\\\frac{d^4p}{(2\\\\pi)^4}\\\\exp{\\\\left[-ip \\\\cdot(x'-x)\\\\right]}\\\\tilde S_F(p), the equation becomes : \\\\begin{align} & (i ot abla' - m)\\\\int\\\\frac{d^4p}{(2\\\\pi)^4}\\\\tilde S_F(p)\\\\exp{\\\\left[-ip \\\\cdot(x'-x)\\\\right]} \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\[6pt] = {} & \\\\int\\\\frac{d^4p}{(2\\\\pi)^4}( ot p - m)\\\\tilde S_F(p)\\\\exp{\\\\left[-ip \\\\cdot(x'-x)\\\\right]} \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\[6pt] = {} & \\\\int\\\\frac{d^4p}{(2\\\\pi)^4}I_4\\\\exp{\\\\left[-ip \\\\cdot(x'-x)\\\\right]} \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\[6pt] = {} & I_4\\\\delta^4(x'-x), \\\\end{align} where on the right-hand side an integral representation of the four-dimensional delta function is used. Thus :( ot p - m I_4)\\\\tilde S_F(p) = I_4. By multiplying from the left with :( ot p + m) (dropping unit matrices from the notation) and using properties of the gamma matrices, : \\\\begin{align} ot p ot p & = \\\\frac{1}{2}( ot p ot p + ot p ot p) \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\[6pt] & = \\\\frac{1}{2}(\\\\gamma_\\\\mu p^\\\\mu \\\\gamma_ u p^ u + \\\\gamma_ u p^ u \\\\gamma_\\\\mu p^\\\\mu) \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\[6pt] & = \\\\frac{1}{2}(\\\\gamma_\\\\mu \\\\gamma_ u + \\\\gamma_ u\\\\gamma_\\\\mu)p^\\\\mu p^ u \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\[6pt] & = g_{\\\\mu u}p^\\\\mu p^ u = p_ u p^ u = p^2, \\\\end{align} the momentum-space propagator used in Feynman diagrams for a Dirac field representing the electron in quantum electrodynamics is found to have form : \\\\tilde{S}_F(p) = \\\\frac{( ot p + m)}{p^2 - m^2 + i \\\\varepsilon} = \\\\frac{(\\\\gamma^\\\\mu p_\\\\mu + m)}{p^2 - m^2 + i \\\\varepsilon}. The downstairs is a prescription for how to handle the poles in the complex -plane. It automatically yields the Feynman contour of integration by shifting the poles appropriately. It is sometimes written :\\\\tilde{S}_F(p) = {1 \\\\over \\\\gamma^\\\\mu p_\\\\mu - m + i\\\\varepsilon} = {1 \\\\over ot p - m + i\\\\varepsilon} for short. It should be remembered that this expression is just shorthand notation for . \\"One over matrix\\" is otherwise nonsensical. In position space one has :S_F(x-y) = \\\\int \\\\frac{d^4 p}{(2\\\\pi)^4} \\\\, e^{-i p \\\\cdot (x-y)} \\\\frac{\\\\gamma^\\\\mu p_\\\\mu + m}{p^2 - m^2 + i \\\\varepsilon} = \\\\left( \\\\frac{\\\\gamma^\\\\mu (x-y)_\\\\mu}{x-y^5} + \\\\frac{m}{x-y^3} \\\\right) J_1(m x-y). This is related to the Feynman propagator by :S_F(x-y) = (i ot \\\\partial + m) G_F(x-y) where ot \\\\partial := \\\\gamma^\\\\mu \\\\partial_\\\\mu. = Spin 1 = The propagator for a gauge boson in a gauge theory depends on the choice of convention to fix the gauge. For the gauge used by Feynman and Stueckelberg, the propagator for a photon is :{-i g^{\\\\mu u} \\\\over p^2 + i\\\\varepsilon }. The propagator for a massive vector field can be derived from the Stueckelberg Lagrangian. The general form with gauge parameter reads : \\\\frac{g_{\\\\mu u} - \\\\frac{k_\\\\mu k_ u}{m^2}}{k^2-m^2+i\\\\varepsilon}+\\\\frac{\\\\frac{k_\\\\mu k_ u}{m^2}}{k^2-\\\\frac{m^2}{\\\\lambda}+i\\\\varepsilon}. With this general form one obtains the propagator in unitary gauge for , the propagator in Feynman or 't Hooft gauge for and in Landau or Lorenz gauge for . There are also other notations where the gauge parameter is the inverse of . The name of the propagator, however, refers to its final form and not necessarily to the value of the gauge parameter. Unitary gauge: :\\\\frac{g_{\\\\mu u} - \\\\frac{k_\\\\mu k_ u}{m^2}}{k^2-m^2+i\\\\varepsilon}. Feynman ('t Hooft) gauge: :\\\\frac{g_{\\\\mu u}}{k^2-m^2+i\\\\varepsilon}. Landau (Lorenz) gauge: :\\\\frac{g_{\\\\mu u} - \\\\frac{k_\\\\mu k_ u}{k^2}}{k^2-m^2+i\\\\varepsilon}. Graviton propagator The graviton propagator for Minkowski space in general relativity is https://dspace.library.uu.nl/bitstream/handle/1874/4837/Quantum_theory_of_gravitation.pdf?sequence=2&isAllowed;=y :G_{\\\\alpha\\\\beta~\\\\mu u} = \\\\frac{\\\\mathcal{P}^2_{\\\\alpha\\\\beta~\\\\mu u}}{k^2} - \\\\frac{\\\\mathcal{P}^0_s{}_{\\\\alpha\\\\beta~\\\\mu u}}{2k^2} = \\\\frac{g_{\\\\alpha\\\\mu}g_{\\\\beta u}+g_{\\\\beta\\\\mu}g_{\\\\alpha u}-\\\\frac{2}{D-2}g_{\\\\mu u}g_{\\\\alpha\\\\beta}}{k^2}, where D is the number of spacetime dimensions, \\\\mathcal{P}^2 is the transverse and traceless spin-2 projection operator and \\\\mathcal{P}^0_s is a spin-0 scalar multiplet. The graviton propagator for (Anti) de Sitter space is :G = \\\\frac{\\\\mathcal{P}^2}{2H^2-\\\\Box} + \\\\frac{\\\\mathcal{P}^0_s}{2(\\\\Box+4H^2)}, where H is the Hubble constant. Note that upon taking the limit H \\\\to 0 and \\\\Box \\\\to -k^2, the AdS propagator reduces to the Minkowski propagator. Related singular functions The scalar propagators are Green's functions for the Klein‚ÄìGordon equation. There are related singular functions which are important in quantum field theory. We follow the notation in Bjorken and Drell.Bjorken and Drell, Appendix C See also Bogolyubov and Shirkov (Appendix A). These functions are most simply defined in terms of the vacuum expectation value of products of field operators. Solutions to the Klein‚ÄìGordon equation =Pauli-Jordan function= The commutator of two scalar field operators defines the Pauli-Jordan function \\\\Delta(x-y) by :\\\\langle 0  \\\\left[ \\\\Phi(x),\\\\Phi(y) \\\\right]  0 \\\\rangle = i \\\\, \\\\Delta(x-y) with :\\\\,\\\\Delta(x-y) = G_\\\\text{adv} (x-y) - G_\\\\text{ret}(x-y) This satisfies :\\\\Delta(x-y) = -\\\\Delta(y-x) and is zero if (x-y)^2 < 0. =Positive and negative frequency parts (cut propagators)= We can define the positive and negative frequency parts of \\\\Delta(x-y), sometimes called cut propagators, in a relativistically invariant way. This allows us to define the positive frequency part: :\\\\Delta_+(x-y) = \\\\langle 0  \\\\Phi(x) \\\\Phi(y) 0 \\\\rangle, and the negative frequency part: :\\\\Delta_-(x-y) = \\\\langle 0  \\\\Phi(y) \\\\Phi(x) 0 \\\\rangle. These satisfy :\\\\,i \\\\Delta = \\\\Delta_+ - \\\\Delta_- and :(\\\\Box_x + m^2) \\\\Delta_{\\\\pm}(x-y) = 0. =Auxiliary function= The anti-commutator of two scalar field operators defines \\\\Delta_1(x-y) function by :\\\\langle 0  \\\\left\\\\\\\\{ \\\\Phi(x),\\\\Phi(y) \\\\right\\\\\\\\}  0 \\\\rangle = \\\\Delta_1(x-y) with :\\\\,\\\\Delta_1(x-y) = \\\\Delta_+ (x-y) + \\\\Delta_-(x-y). This satisfies \\\\,\\\\Delta_1(x-y) = \\\\Delta_1(y-x). Green's functions for the Klein‚ÄìGordon equation The retarded, advanced and Feynman propagators defined above are all Green's functions for the Klein‚ÄìGordon equation. They are related to the singular functions by :G_\\\\text{ret}(x-y) = -\\\\Delta(x-y) \\\\Theta(x_0-y_0) :G_\\\\text{adv}(x-y) = \\\\Delta(x-y) \\\\Theta(y_0-x_0) :2 G_F(x-y) = -i \\\\,\\\\Delta_1(x-y) + \\\\varepsilon(x_0 - y_0) \\\\,\\\\Delta(x-y) where :\\\\,\\\\varepsilon(x_0-y_0) = 2 \\\\Theta(x_0-y_0) - 1.

It was registered under Belgian law as a non-profit organization in 1997, but its roots date from the late 1970s in Germany: There it was found in Bonn by former German chancellor Willy Brandt and Gerd Greune in 1979 to support democratic forces and establish exchange with civil society in the countries of the Warsaw Pact. After the fall of the Iron Curtain, IFIAS created networks and conducted projects to help the former communist countries in their transition to democracy and pluralism, which provisionally culminated with the admission of ten new members to the European Union on May 1, 2004. Besides that, IFIAS was active in the field of humanitarian aid during and following the civil wars in the Balkans. Especially in Germany, IFIAS organized fund-raising and transports of humanitarian aid goods to the conflict region as well as assisting and counseling refugees. In addition to that, IFIAS conducted projects in Chechnya, both for humanitarian aid and democratization (due to the political situation, this work could not be continued).

He rarely worked as a bandleader, and was known for his work as a sideman with drummer Max Roach and his younger brother, the saxophonist Stanley Turrentine.[ Allmusic biography] Biography Born in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, Turrentine played in the bands of Benny Carter, Earl Bostic, Charles Mingus, Billy Eckstine, Dizzy Gillespie, and Count Basie. He later recorded with Sonny Clark, Lou Donaldson, and his brother's bands. His working relationship with Max Roach was spawned in part when he joined the Max Roach Quintet in the late 1950s. Turrentine was also adept on the piano at chord blockings and was a compositional exponent of Thelonious Monk's earlier chordal voicings. His bebop compositions combined a sophisticated and emotional fusion and poignant lyricism reminiscent of Benny Golson and with the passionate, spirited influence of the Brown/Roach Quintet. While his brother had a successful career and recorded a number of albums over his lifetime, Tommy only recorded one album under his name before retiring in the 1960s. In the 1970s he lived on the ground floor of a brownstone with his wife Jane on West 82nd Street in New York City, a street which during that period had a number of jazz luminaries living along its blocks between Broadway and Central Park, including Tommy Flanagan and Pharoah Sanders. Tommy Turrentine was rarely active after the 1970s. In the summer of 1979 Turrentine was one of several star trumpeters (including John Faddis and others) who appeared at the Village Gate for an all-star tribute to Blue Mitchell who died earlier that year. Turrentine also appeared on the 1989 album Blue Delight by keyboardist Sun Ra. He died of cancer at the age of 69.http://communityvoices.post-gazette.com/arts-entertainment- living?tmpl=component&type;=atom&start;=3588 Discography As leader *1960: Tommy Turrentine (Time Records, 1960) - with Stanley Turrentine, trombonist Julian Priester, bassist Bob Boswell, drummer Max Roach, pianist Horace Parlan[ Allmusic review] As sideman With Ahmed Abdul-Malik *The Music of Ahmed Abdul-Malik (New Jazz, 1961) *Sounds of Africa (New Jazz, 1961) With Paul Chambers *1st Bassman (VeeJay 1960) With Sonny Clark *Leapin' and Lopin' (Blue Note, 1961) With Lou Donaldson *The Natural Soul (Blue Note, 1962) *Signifyin' (Argo, 1963) With Booker Ervin *The Book Cooks (Bethlehem, 1960) With Dexter Gordon *Landslide (Blue Note, 1961-62 [1980]) With Rufus Jones *Five on Eight (Cameo) With Philly Joe Jones *Mean What You Say (Sonet, 1977) With Abbey Lincoln *Abbey Is Blue (Riverside, 1959) With Jackie McLean *A Fickle Sonance (Blue Note, 1961) With Horace Parlan *Speakin' My Piece (Blue Note, 1960) *On the Spur of the Moment (Blue Note 1961) With John Patton *Blue John (Blue Note, 1963) With Max Roach * Quiet as It's Kept (Mercury, 1959) *Moon Faced and Starry Eyed (Mercury, 1959) *Long as You're Living (Enja, 1960 [1984]) *Parisian Sketches (Mercury, 1960) With Archie Shepp *Mama Too Tight (Impulse!, 1966) With Sun Ra *Blue Delight (A&M;, 1989) With Stanley Turrentine *Comin' Your Way (Blue Note, 1961) *Jubilee Shout!!!

They disrupt the enterohepatic circulation of bile acids by combining with bile constituents and preventing their reabsorption from the gut. In general, they are classified as hypolipidemic agents, although they may be used for purposes other than lowering cholesterol. They are used in the treatment of chronic diarrhea due to bile acid malabsorption. Mechanism Bile acid sequestrants are polymeric compounds that serve as ion-exchange resins. Bile acid sequestrants exchange anions such as chloride ions for bile acids. By doing so, they bind bile acids and sequester them from the enterohepatic circulation. The liver then produces more bile acids to replace those that have been lost. Because the body uses cholesterol to make bile acids, this reduces the level of LDL cholesterol circulating in the blood. Bile acid sequestrants are large polymeric structures, and they are not significantly absorbed from the gut into the bloodstream. Thus, bile acid sequestrants, along with any bile acids bound to the drug, are excreted via the feces after passage through the gastrointestinal tract.FDA Heart Health Online - Bile Acid Sequestrants Medical uses Hyperlipidemia As bile acids are biosynthesized from cholesterol, disruption of bile acid reabsorption will decrease cholesterol levels, in particular, low-density lipoprotein (commonly known as \\"bad cholesterol\\") in blood. Consequently, these drugs have been used for the treatment of hypercholesterolemia and dyslipidemia. Use of these agents as hypolipidemic agents has decreased markedly since the introduction of the statins, which are more efficacious than bile acid sequestrants at lowering LDL. They are occasionally used as an adjunct to the statins as an alternative to the fibrates (another major group of cholesterol-lowering drugs), which are thought to increase the risk of rhabdomyolysis when used with statins. The bile-acid-binding resins can raise triglycerides modestly (about 5%) and cannot be used if the triglycerides are elevated. Bile acid malabsorption Chronic diarrhea may be caused by excess bile salts entering the colon rather than being absorbed at the end of the small intestine (the ileum). This condition of bile acid malabsorption occurs after surgery to the ileum, in Crohn's disease, with a number of other gastrointestinal causes, or is commonly a primary, idiopathic condition. The SeHCAT test can be used for diagnosis. Bile salt diarrhea can also be a side-effect of gallbladder removal. Bile acid sequestrants are the principal therapy for bile acid- induced diarrhea. Cholestyramine, colestipol and colesevelam have all been used. Doses may not need to be as high as those previously used for hyperlipidemia. Many patients find them hard to tolerate, as although the diarrhea may improve, bloating and abdominal pain can worsen. Use in other conditions In chronic liver diseases such as cirrhosis, bile acids may deposit in the skin, causing pruritus (itching). Hence, bile acid sequestrants may be used for the prevention of pruritus in patients with chronic liver disease. Bile acid sequestrants may also be used to treat hyperthyroidism as an adjunct therapy. By inhibiting the enterohepatic circulation, more L-thyroxine will be lost through defecation, thus lowering body thyroxine levels. Cholestyramine has been used in the treatment of Clostridium difficile infections, in order to absorb toxins A and B. Side effects As bile acid sequestrants are designed to stay in the gut; in general, they do not have systemic side effects. However, they may cause problems in the gastrointestinal tract, such as constipation, diarrhea, bloating, and flatulence. Some patients complain of the bad taste. Because bile acid sequestrants are not well-absorbed from the gut, they are generally regarded as safe in pregnant women. However, by interfering with vitamin absorption, they could cause vitamin deficiencies that may affect the fetus. So, vitamin supplementation may be considered, with appropriate intervals between dosing of the vitamins and bile acid sequestrants. Drug interactions In addition to bile acids, bile acid sequestrants may also bind drugs in the GI tract, preventing their absorption into the bloodstream. For this reason, it is generally advised that bile acid sequestrants be spaced several hours apart from other drugs. They can also bind fat-soluble vitamins, such as vitamin A, vitamin D, vitamin E, and vitamin K. This effect could result in a vitamin deficiency, and so checking blood levels and possible supplementation has been suggested. Examples Three drugs are members of this class; all are synthetic polymeric resins: * Cholestyramine (generic and various propriety names) * Colestipol (Colestid, Colestipid) * Colesevelam (Cholestagel in Europe, Welchol in the USA, Lodalis in Canada) References Hepatology Bile acid sequestrants ca:Resina d'intercanvi i√≤nic ","title":"Bile acid sequestrant"},{"id":"698799","text":"The Football Association Challenge Trophy, commonly known as the FA Trophy, is a men's football knockout cup competition run by and named after the English Football Association and competed for primarily by semi-professional teams. The competition was instigated in 1969 to cater for those non-league clubs that paid their players and were therefore not eligible to enter the FA Amateur Cup. Eligibility rules have changed over time, but from 2008 onwards the competition has been open to clubs playing in Steps 1‚Äì4 of the National League System, equivalent to tiers 5‚Äì8 of the overall English football league system. This covers the National League, the Southern League, Isthmian League, and Northern Premier League. The final of the competition was held at the original Wembley Stadium from the tournament's instigation until the stadium closed in 2000. The final has been played at the new Wembley Stadium since its opening in 2007. The record for the most FA Trophy wins is shared by Woking and two defunct clubs, Scarborough and Telford United, with three victories each. The Trophy is currently held by AFC Fylde who beat Leyton Orient in the 2019 final. History Ebbsfleet United fans at the 2008 final The competition was created by the Football Association in 1969 to afford semi- professional teams an opportunity to compete for the chance to play at Wembley Stadium. Fully amateur clubs took part in the long-standing FA Amateur Cup, but most of the leading non-league clubs made at least some form of payment to their players and were therefore ineligible to enter the Amateur Cup. The first winners of the competition were Macclesfield Town of the Northern Premier League, who defeated Telford United of the Southern League in the final. Northern Premier League clubs dominated the first decade of the competition, with Telford United the only Southern League team to break the northern clubs' hold on the competition. In the early years of its existence the competition struggled to achieve the same level of prestige as the long- established Amateur Cup. In 1974 the FA abolished the distinction between official professional and amateur status and discontinued the Amateur Cup, and the Trophy soon had 300 entrants. This figure was gradually reduced until by 1991 only around 120 clubs took part. In 1978 the FA moved the final of the Trophy to the Saturday immediately following the FA Cup Final, so as to give it a longer build-up and avoid conflict with clubs' league programmes, which had previously reduced the competition's prestige. Martin O'Neill managed Wycombe Wanderers to two Trophy wins. In 1979 the leading Southern and Northern Premier League teams formed the new Alliance Premier League, and teams from this league dominated the Trophy during the 1980s, although in the 1980‚Äì81 season Bishop's Stortford of the comparatively lowly Isthmian League First Division entered at the preliminary round and won twelve matches to reach the final, where they defeated Sutton United. Telford United's win in 1989 made them the second team to win the Trophy three times. Between 1990 and 2000 three more teams claimed multiple wins. Former Northern Ireland international Martin O'Neill, in his third managerial role, led Wycombe Wanderers to two wins, and Geoff Chapple managed Kingstonian to victory twice and Woking three times, all within the space of seven years. After Chapple's period of success, Mark Stimson became the first man to manage the Trophy- winning team in three successive seasons, when he led Grays Athletic to victory in 2005 and 2006 and repeated the feat with his new club Stevenage Borough in 2007. As of 2001 the competition was sponsored by Umbro; in the 2007-08 season it was sponsored by Carlsberg. Format The competition is a knockout tournament with pairings drawn at random. However, the qualifying round draws and the 1st Round proper draw are regionalised to reduce teams' travel costs. For the 2014‚Äì15 season this was extended to the 2nd Round proper draw as well, however this change only lasted one season. If a match (other than the semi-final or final) is drawn, there is a replay, usually at the ground of the team which played away from home for the first game. Drawn replays are now settled with extra time and penalty shootouts, though in the past further replays were possible. Originally the competition included as many qualifying rounds as were required to reduce the number of teams to 32. In 1999 the format was amended to match that of the FA Cup, with six rounds prior to the semi-final stage, albeit without qualifying rounds. Teams from the Football Conference received byes through the early rounds, in a similar manner to the way in which the leading clubs receive byes in the FA Cup. As of 2008‚Äì09 the competition featured four qualifying rounds and four rounds proper before the semi-finals. Teams from Step 4 enter at the preliminary round stage, those from Step 3 at the first qualifying round, those from Step 2 at the third qualifying round, and those from Step 1 at the first round proper. The FA pays prize money to all teams which win at least one match in the Trophy competition. In the 2014-15 season the prize for the 64 preliminary round winners was ¬£2,500, rising round-by-round to ¬£50,000 for the winners of the final. The prize fund is cumulative, so a team that starts in the preliminary round and wins through several rounds would receive ¬£2,500 for the preliminary round, ¬£2,700 for the first qualifying round, ¬£3,250 for the second qualifying round, and so on.The FA Venues Villa Park hosted the Trophy final from 2001 until 2005. The final was traditionally held at the original Wembley Stadium, but was moved to Villa Park during Wembley's redevelopment, and a final was also played at West Ham United's Boleyn Ground. In 2007 the final moved to the new Wembley Stadium, and a record crowd of 53,262 saw Kidderminster Harriers lose to Stevenage Borough.

Scarborough (1973, 1976, 1977), Telford United (1971, 1983, 1989), and Woking (1994, 1995, 1997) share the record for the most victories (three) in the final. In 1985 Wealdstone became the first team to win the \\"Non-League Double\\" of FA Trophy and Football Conference championship (although in the pre-Conference era both Macclesfield Town and Stafford Rangers had done the double of Northern Premier League championship and FA Trophy in 1970 and 1972 respectively). Since then Colchester United in 1992 and Wycombe Wanderers in 1993 have equalled Wealdstone's achievement. Three Welsh clubs have reached FA Trophy finals; Bangor City (1984), Newport County (2012), and Wrexham in 2013 and 2015. Wrexham became the first Welsh winners of the FA Trophy in 2013.\\"Wrexham claim FA Trophy\\", The Daily Telegraph, 25 March 2013 Media coverage From the 2004‚Äì05 season Sky Sports had a deal to show the final of the FA Trophy.

A native of Paris, he was most noted for his female nudes such as Standing Woman. Gaston Lachaise was taught the refinement of European sculpture while living in France. He met a young American woman, Isabel Nagel, and the pair moved to America, where his craft reached maturity and he was influenced and inspired by American ways. Lachaise helped redefine the female nude in a new and powerful manner. His drawings also reflected his new style of the female form. Early life and education Born in Paris, Lachaise was the son of a cabinetmaker. At age 13 he entered a craft school, the √âcole Municipale Bernard Palissy, where he was trained in the decorative arts, and from 1898 to 1904 he studied sculpture at the √âcole des Beaux-Arts under Gabriel-Jules Thomas. He began his artistic career as a designer of Art Nouveau decorative objects for the French jeweler Ren√© Lalique. Move to America Around 1902 or 1903 he met and fell in love with Isabel Dutaud Nagle (1872‚Äì1957), a married American woman of French Canadian descent (she eventually was divorced from her husband and married Lachaise). When she returned to her home near Boston in 1904, Lachaise vowed to follow her. After briefly working for the master jewelry and glass designer Ren√© Lalique in order to pay for his passage, he arrived in America in 1906, never to return to his native land. For the next fifteen years he earned a living as a sculptor's assistant. In Boston he worked for H. H. Kitson, an academic sculptor producing primarily military monuments. In 1912 Lachaise went to New York City helping Kitson in his studio at 7 MacDougal Alley. Soon after, he went to work as an assistant to the sculptor Paul Manship, while also creating his own art. His association with Paul Manship lasted until 1921; the work of both sculptors can be seen at Rockefeller Center. In the early 1920s Lachaise bought a summer home and studio in Georgetown, Maine, Marsden Hartley being a frequent visitor.Seguinland artists exhibition at the Portland Museum of Art, summer 2011  Maine Travel Maven Retrieved 2017-04-25. In America, Lachaise matured into his unique style and portrayal of the female nude. He worked mostly in bronze. Lachaise's nudes were seen as strong yet gentle, husky but curvy, and seem to be referring to fertility as well. \\"The breasts, the abdomen, the thighs, the buttocks‚Äîupon each of these elements the sculptor lavishes a powerful and incisive massiveness, a rounded voluminousness, that answers not to the descriptions of nature but to an ideal prescribed by his own emotions.\\"Kramer 1967, p. 13. Works Floating Figure (1927, bronze), no. 5 from an edition of 7, Purchased 1978 by the National Gallery of Australia Standing Woman at UCLA, 1932 Georgia O'Keeffe (marble), 1927, Metropolitan Museum of Art Lachaise's personal idiom was developed during the first decade of the twentieth century with his encounter with Isabel. But it was not until his arrival in New York, that he realized his principal manifesto: his concept of \\"Woman\\" as a force of nature based on his wife's image. In his own words he described his many sculpted images of the female nude in contrasting terms: vigorous, robust, and massive yet in repose, serene and eternal. In 1918, (eight months after he became an American citizen and married Isabel), Lachaise began his meteoric rise in the New York art world with his first solo show, held at the Bourgeois Galleries, which featured his challenging, heroic-sized Woman (Elevation). Lachaise's most famous work, Standing Woman (modeled 1928‚Äì30, copyrighted 1932, cast ca. 1933, Museum of Modern Art, New York), typifies the image that Lachaise worked and reworked: a voluptuous female nude with sinuous, tapered limbs. Lachaise was also known as a portraitist. He executed busts of famous artists and literary celebrities, such as Georgia O'Keeffe, John Marin, Marianne Moore and Lincoln Kirstein. In 1935 the Museum of Modern Art in New York City held a retrospective exhibition of Lachaise's work, the first at that institution for any American sculptor. Gaston Lachaise was an extremely versatile sculptor, technically expert in several media and accomplished with both ideal and commercial effort. His work was chosen for several major New York architectural commissions ‚Äì including the AT&T; Building and Rockefeller Center. And the more commercial aspect of his sculptural output ‚Äì the production of fountains and decorative bronzes, primarily depicting animals ‚Äì offered him some financial relief. Yet Lachaise's artistic legacy is closely bound to his depictions of \\"Woman.\\" His late works, which are extreme in their manipulation of his ideal of the human anatomy, are erotic and emotional and avant-garde. Called by ARTnews the \\"greatest American sculptor of his time\\", he played a critical role in the birth of American Modernism, pushing the boundaries of nude figuration with his innovative explorations of the human body. His artistic career was cut short by his unexpected death from acute leukemia on October 18, 1935.

In 2015, the Lachaise Foundation entered an agreement with Findlay Galleries, and since then the gallery has been the exclusive representative of the Lachaise Estate.

Their influences range from black metal, progressive metal, industrial music, symphonic metal and gothic metal to European classical music and contemporary music. History Peccatum was formed by singer Ihriel (Heidi Solberg Tveitan), her husband Ihsahn (of the well-known black metal band Emperor), and her brother Lord PZ. The group released three albums and two EPs. Lost in Reverie, released in 2004 after Lord PZ's departure, moved towards a more classical, avant-garde and musically opaque direction.

It is formed from a leafy 1930s suburban development along with ancient woodland, and forms part of the London Borough of Harrow. Locale, geography and history All Saints church High Street Old road signage at the A409/A410 roundabout The word Weald is Old English in origin, meaning woodland. It was recorded as waldis in 1303 and welde in 1382, but the name Harrow Weald is not recorded until 1553. It was then part of the great Forest of Middlesex. Harrow Weald is near Bushey Heath, Stanmore, Wealdstone, Headstone and Hatch End. It is in the HA postcode area. The south of the area is a suburban development with houses, schools, small shops, supermarkets and pubs (notably Bombay Central, formerly the Weald Stone Inn, and before that the Red Lion). The area expanded around the First World War and continued to grow quickly: the population grew from 1,517 in 1901 to 10,923 in 1931. The Harrow Weald campus of Harrow College (previously a grammar school, then a 16+ college) and Harrow Weald Cemetery are at the northern edge of the built up area. All Saints churchyard and its extension adjoin this cemetery and their most famous interment is of Leefe Robinson, a pilot who was awarded the Victoria Cross. Ancient woodland on high ground fills most of the northern part of Harrow Weald on the border of Greater London (and the traditional county of Middlesex) with Hertfordshire. The area is one of the highest in Greater London; the highest point in Middlesex is near the woods at . The eastern part of the woods merges into those of Stanmore and encompasses Bentley Priory. The priory's grounds are now Bentley Priory Nature Reserve, a biological Site of Special Scientific Interest. Along the southern edge of the high ground runs the road Old Redding and a car park here gives views over parts of London. The western part of the woodland forms Harrow Weald Common, which adjoins Harrow Weald SSSI, a geological Site of Special Scientific Interest. Other smaller woods surround the Grim's Dyke Hotel, the former country house of W. S. Gilbert. Gilbert and Sullivan's comic operas are frequently performed here. The house is named after the nearby earthwork Grim's Ditch, a 3-mile long ancient monument that runs from Harrow Weald to Pinner Green. The monument remains largely mysterious but is known to have been named in the Saxon era.Grim's Ditch The ditch hints at a long history of habitation in the area and many artefacts have been found on the common to support this. The Friends Of Harrow Weald is based at Harrow Weald Recreation Ground.[cite weburl=https://www.Harrowweald.co.uktitle=Central Park Of Harrow Weald - Harrow Weald Recreation Groundwebsite=https://www.Harrowweald.co.uk] Demography The 2011 census showed that in the Harrow Weald ward, 53% of the population was white (41% British, 6% Other, 5% Irish). The largest non-white group was Indian at 19%. Of the 4,160 household tenures, 68.4% of them are owned, 15.9% are socially rented and 13.7% are privately rented. The unemployment rate of economically active people was 4.9%. The median age of the population is 39. Transport There are no train stations in the centre of Harrow Weald, but Headstone Lane railway station is to the west, whereas Harrow & Wealdstone station is to the south. Buses London Bus routes 140, 182, 186, 258, 340, 640, H12, H18, H19 and N18 operate through the area. The N140 bus also goes through Harrow Weald, it was introduced on the 17th June 1972.

Early life  Leonard Jerome was born in Pompey in Onondaga County, New York, on November 3, 1817. He was one of nine sons and one daughter born to Aurora (n√©e Murray) Jerome (1785‚Äì1867) and Isaac Jerome (1786‚Äì1866). Isaac was a descendant of Timothy Jerome, a French Huguenot immigrant who arrived in the New York Colony in 1717. Jerome was born on a farm in the Central New York town of Pompey, near Syracuse. His paternal grandmother was Betsy Ball, a relative of George Washington.. His maternal ancestry was Scottish. He originally enrolled in Princeton University, then known as the College of New Jersey (where two of his brothers studied theology and became Presbyterian ministers), as a member of the Class of 1839, before leaving for Union College, where he studied law with his uncle, known as Judge Jerome, and set up a practice in Rochester, New York. He later moved to New York City, where he became a stock speculator and promoter. 26th Street and Madison Avenue, c.1878  Career  Jerome was a flamboyant and successful stock speculator. He made and lost several fortunes, and was known as \\"The King of Wall Street\\". He held interests in several railroad companies and was often a partner in the deals of Cornelius Vanderbilt.Burrows & Wallace. He was a patron of the arts, and joined in the founding of the Academy of Music, one of New York City's earliest opera houses. During the New York Draft Riots, Jerome defended the New York Times office building with a Gatling Gun.Baker, Kevin, \\"Violent City: A Five-day Battle for New York Reveals the Birthing Pains of Our Democracy\\", American Heritage Magazine, February/March 2003, Volume 54, Issue 1. Although he had significant holdings in the Times,Burrows & Wallace, p. 890. he was not the majority shareholder as is sometimes erroneously claimed. The Jerome Mansion, on the corner of Madison Avenue and 26th Street, had a six-hundred-seat theatre, a breakfast room which seated seventy people, a ballroom of white and gold with champagne- and cologne- spouting fountains,Burrows & Wallace, p. 960. and a view of Madison Square Park. It was later sold and housed a series of private clubs. The mansion was demolished in 1967.  Sporting activities  Jerome was an avid sportsman. He enjoyed yachting with his friend, William K. Vanderbilt. They shared a passion for thoroughbred horse racing and helped found the American Jockey Club.Burrows & Wallace, p. 954. In the late 1860s, Jerome was part of several hunting trips in the American West. These trips were guided by Buffalo Bill Cody. In 1866, Jerome bought the estate and mansion of James Bathgate near Old Fordham Village in what was then rural Westchester County, but is now The Bronx. Jerome and financier August Belmont, Sr. built Jerome Park Racetrack on the Bathgate land; the first Belmont Stakes was held there in 1867. Jerome and his brother Lawrence had a wide boulevard made from Macombs Dam to the track, which city authorities attempted to name \\"Murphy Avenue\\" after a local politician. This incensed Jerome's wife so much that she had bronze plaques saying \\"Jerome Avenue\\" made up and bolted into place along the road, forcing the city to accept the name. The racetrack was acquired and demolished by the city in 1894, to make way for Jerome Park Reservoir. The Bathgate mansion served as a summer home for the Jerome family. In the early 1900s, the mansion was razed and replaced by the Kingsbridge Armory. Jerome became a resident of Brooklyn. He, Vanderbilt, and other investors founded the Coney Island Jockey Club which in 1884 built the Sheepshead Bay Race Track. Personal life Jerome's daughters: Jennie (1854‚Äì1921), Clara (1851‚Äì1935) and Leonie (1859‚Äì1943) On April 5, 1849, Jerome married Clarissa Hall (1825‚Äì1895), daughter of the wealthy Amos Hall, in Palmyra, New York. Together, they had four daughters. One daughter, Camille, died at age eight. The other three ‚Äì Jeanette, Clarita, and Leonie ‚Äì became known, in some quarters, as \\"the Good, the Witty and the Beautiful\\". Leonard Jerome's wealth afforded his daughters the opportunity to spend much time in Europe, where they associated with the aristocratic elite of the day. All three daughters married British or Anglo- Irish husbands: * Lady Randolph Churchill (n√©e Jeanette Jerome; known as Jennie), who married Lord Randolph Churchill (1849‚Äì1895), younger son of the Duke of Marlborough, and was mother to Winston Churchill and John Strange Spencer-Churchill. * Clarita Frewen (n√©e Clarita Jerome), known as Clara, who married Moreton Frewen (1853‚Äì1924), fifth son of Thomas Frewen MP, a charming spendthrift who ran up huge debts trying to operate a ranch in Wyoming, and through gambling, sports, and women. They had two sons, Hugh and Oswald, and one daughter, Clare Sheridan. * Leonie, Lady Leslie (n√©e Leonie Jerome), who married Sir John Leslie (1857‚Äì1944), an Irish baronet, whose family estates covered . They had four sons. For many years, she maintained a liaison with Prince Arthur, Duke of Connaught and Strathearn. Jerome was also rumored to be the father of the American opera singer Minnie Hauk.Anne Sebba, American Jennie, Norton, 2008, p. 13. He also had an affair in the 1860s with Fanny Ronalds, then separated from her husband. Ronalds later lived in London, where she remained a friend of Jerome's daughter Jennie. Leonard Jerome died at the age of 73 in Brighton, England, surrounded by his wife and surviving daughters. He was originally buried at Kensal Green Cemetery in England, and later buried in the Green-Wood Cemetery in Brooklyn.  Legacy  Jerome Avenue in the Bronx, Jerome Avenue in Brooklyn, Jerome Park Reservoir, and the Jerome Stakes are all named after him.

Listed at 6' 2\\", 225 lb., Carrara batted and threw right-handed. He established himself as a valuable middle relief man in MLB, as well as a solid starting pitcher in the Italian Baseball League. A failed starter in MLB, Carrera became an effective long reliever. He had a 90‚Äì92 MPH fastball, along with a couple of breaking balls, a deceptive slow curve, and particularly his off-speed pitch; a hard one that was somewhere between a slider and cut fastball. He controlled the running game as well, with a good move to both first base and second, and a quick delivery to the plate. On August 15, 2001, Carrara combined with fellow Venezuelan pitchers Omar Daal, Kelvim Escobar, and Freddy Garc√≠a to win their respective starts: Carrara, of the Dodgers, facing Montreal, 13‚Äì1; Daal, in a Phillies victory over the Brewers, 8‚Äì6; Escobar, of the Blue Jays, over Oakland, 5‚Äì2, and Garc√≠a, of Seattle, against the Red Sox, 6‚Äì2. This marked the first time in major league history that four pitchers coming from Venezuela have recorded a winning game in their respective starts in the same day. On August 26, 2006, Carrara was designated for assignment by the Dodgers. He was called up in September 2006 when rosters expanded and used sparingly after re-joining the big league club.

Similar lights may be found on a railway platform. When urban electric power distribution became ubiquitous in developed countries in the 20th century, lights for urban streets followed, or sometimes led. Detail of a street light from Paris Detail of a street light with Cupid, at the Austrian Parliament Building (Vienna) Many lamps have light-sensitive photocells that activate the lamp automatically when needed, at times when there is little to no ambient light, such as at dusk, dawn, or at the onset of dark weather conditions. This function in older lighting systems could be performed with the aid of a solar dial. Many street light systems are being connected underground instead of wiring from one utility post to another. History Preindustrial era Early lamps were used by Greek and Roman civilizations, where light primarily served the purpose of security, both to protect the wanderer from tripping on the path over something or keeping the potential robbers at bay. At that time oil lamps were used predominantly as they provided a long-lasting and moderate flame. A slave responsible for lighting the oil lamps in front of Roman villas was called a . The use of street lighting was first recorded in the city of Antioch from the 4th century B.C.M. Luckiesh (1920), Artificial Light, The Century Company, pp 153‚Äì4. In South Asia street lamps first appeared in the Bronze age indus valley civilization, each lane had a public use and was provided with street lamps. The streets of Ayodhya and Lanka were also provided with lamp posts. In the Middle Ages, so-called \\"link boys\\" escorted people from one place to another through the murky winding streets of medieval towns. Before incandescent lamps, candle lighting was employed in cities. The earliest lamps required that a lamplighter tour the town at dusk, lighting each of the lamps. According to some sources, illumination was ordered in London in 1417 by Sir Henry Barton, Mayor of London though there is no firm evidence of this.Roskell, J. S. and Clark, L. and Rawcliffe, C. (editors) BARTON, Henry (d.1435), of London. - History of Parliament Online , The History of Parliament: the House of Commons 1386‚Äì1421. . 1993. Public street lighting was first developed in the 1500s, and accelerated following the invention of lanterns with glass windows, which greatly improved the quantity of light. In 1588 the Parisian Parlement decreed that a torch be installed and lit at each intersection, and in 1594 the police changed this to lanterns. Still, in the mid-1600s it was a common practice for travelers to hire a lantern-bearer if they had to move at night through the dark, winding streets. King Louis XIV authorized sweeping reforms in Paris in 1667, which included the installation and maintenance of lights on streets and at intersections, as well as stiff penalties for vandalizing or stealing the fixtures. Paris had more than 2,700 street lights by the end of the 17th century, and twice as many by 1730. Under this system, streets were lit with lanterns suspended apart on a cord over the middle of the street at a height of ; as an English visitor enthused in 1698, 'The streets are lit all winter and even during the full moon!' In London, public street lighting was implemented around the end of the 17th century; a diarist wrote in 1712 that ‚ÄòAll the way, quite through Hyde Park to the Queen‚Äôs Palace at Kensington, lanterns were placed for illuminating the roads on dark nights.‚Äô A much-improved oil lantern, called a , was introduced in 1745 and improved in subsequent years. The light shed from these r√©verb√®res was considerably brighter, enough that some people complained of glare. These lamps were attached to the top of lampposts; by 1817, there were 4694 lamps on the Paris streets. During the French Revolution (1789‚Äì1799), the revolutionaries found that the lampposts were a convenient place to hang aristocrats and other opponents. Gas lamp lighting The first widespread system of street lighting used piped coal gas as fuel. Stephen Hales was the first person who procured a flammable fluid from the actual distillation of coal in 1726 and John Clayton, in 1735, called gas the \\"spirit\\" of coal and discovered its flammability by accident. William Murdoch's house in Redruth, UK, the first domestic house in the world to be lit by gas William Murdoch (sometimes spelled \\"Murdock\\") was the first to use this gas for the practical application of lighting. In the early 1790s, while overseeing the use of his company's steam engines in tin mining in Cornwall, Murdoch began experimenting with various types of gas, finally settling on coal-gas as the most effective. He first lit his own house in Redruth, Cornwall in 1792.Janet Thomson; The Scot Who Lit The World, The Story Of William Murdoch Inventor Of Gas Lighting; 2003; In 1798, he used gas to light the main building of the Soho Foundry and in 1802 lit the outside in a public display of gas lighting, the lights astonishing the local population. Street lights from an 1871 catalog The first public street lighting with gas was demonstrated in Pall Mall, London on 28 January 1807 by Frederick Albert Winsor. In 1812, Parliament granted a charter to the London and Westminster Gas Light and Coke Company, and the first gas company in the world came into being. Less than two years later, on 31 December 1813, the Westminster Bridge was lit by gas. Following this success, gas lighting spread outside London, both within Britain and abroad. The first place outside London in England to have gas lighting, was Preston, Lancashire in 1816, where Joseph Dunn's Preston Gaslight Company introduced a new, brighter gas lighting. Another early adopter was the city of Baltimore, where the gas lights were first demonstrated at Rembrandt Peale's Museum in 1816, and Peale's Gas Light Company of Baltimore provided the first gas streetlights in the United States. In Paris, public street lighting was first installed on a covered shopping street, the Passage des Panoramas, in 1817, private interior gas lighting having been previously demonstrated in a house on the rue Saint-Dominique seventeen years prior. The first gas lamps on the main streets of Paris appeared in January 1829 on the place du Carrousel and the rue de Rivoli, then on the rue de la Paix, place Vend√¥me, and rue de Castiglione. By 1857, the Grands Boulevards were all lit with gas; a Parisian writer enthused in August 1857: \\"That which most enchants the Parisians is the new lighting by gas of the boulevards...From the church of the Madeleine all the way to rue Montmartre, these two rows of lamps, shining with a clarity white and pure, have a marvelous effect.\\" The gaslights installed on the boulevards and city monuments in the 19th century gave the city the nickname \\"The City of Light.\\" Oil-gas appeared in the field as a rival of coal-gas. In 1815, John Taylor patented an apparatus for the decomposition of \\"oil\\" and other animal substances. Public attention was attracted to \\"oil-gas\\" by the display of the patent apparatus at Apothecary's Hall, by Taylor & Martineau. The first modern street lamps to use kerosene were introduced in Lviv in what was then the Austrian Empire in 1853. In Brest, street lighting with kerosene lamps reappeared in 2009 in the shopping street as a tourist attraction. =Farola fernandina= Farola fernandina is a traditional design of gas street light which remains popular in Spain. Essentially it is a neo-classical French style of gas lamp dating from the late 18th century. It may be either a wall-bracket or standard lamp. The standard base is cast metal with an escutcheon bearing two intertwined letters 'F', the Royal cypher of King Ferdinand VII of Spain and commemorates the date of the birth of his daughter, the Infanta Luisa Fernanda, Duchess of Montpensier.

This was a carbon arc lamp employing alternating current, which ensured that both electrodes were consumed at equal rates. In 1876, the common council of the City of Los Angeles ordered four arc lights installed in various places in the fledgling town for street lighting.William H. Workman, The City That Grew (1929) Mirror-Press, Los Angeles, p. On 30 May 1878, the first electric street lights in Paris were installed on the avenue de l'Opera and the Place d'Etoile, around the Arc de Triomphe, to celebrate the opening of the Paris Universal Exposition. In 1881, to coincide with the Paris International Exposition of Electricity, street lights were installed on the major boulevards. The first streets in London lit with the electrical arc lamp were by the Holborn Viaduct and the Thames Embankment in 1878. More than 4,000 were in use by 1881, though by then an improved differential arc lamp had been developed by Friedrich von Hefner-Alteneck of Siemens & Halske. The United States was quick in adopting arc lighting, and by 1890 over 130,000 were in operation in the US, commonly installed in exceptionally tall moonlight towers. Arc lights had two major disadvantages. First, they emit an intense and harsh light which, although useful at industrial sites like dockyards, was discomforting in ordinary city streets. Second, they are maintenance-intensive, as carbon electrodes burn away swiftly. With the development of cheap, reliable and bright incandescent light bulbs at the end of the 19th century, arc lights passed out of use for street lighting, but remained in industrial use longer. Incandescent lighting Map of Tamworth, New South Wales, showing the position of leads and lights along the network of city streets in 1888 The first street to be lit by an incandescent lightbulb was Mosley Street, in Newcastle upon Tyne. The street was lit for one night by Joseph Swan's incandescent lamp on 3 February 1879. Consequently, Newcastle has the first city street in the world to be lit by electric lighting. The first city in the United States to successfully demonstrate electric lighting was Cleveland, Ohio with 12 electric lights around the Public Square road system on 29 April 1879. Wabash, Indiana lit 4 Brush arc lamps with 3,000 candlepower each, suspended over their courthouse on 2 February 1880, making the town square \\"as light as midday\\". Kimberley, Cape Colony (modern South Africa), was the first city in the Southern Hemisphere and in Africa to have electric street lights - with 16 first lit on 2 September 1882. The system was only the second in the world, after that of Philadelphia, to be powered municipally. In Central America, San Jose, Costa Rica lit 25 lamps powered by a hydroelectric plant on 9 August 1884. N√ºrnberg was the first city in Germany to have electric public lighting on 7 June 1882, followed by Berlin on 20 September 1882 (Potsdamer Platz only). Timi»ôoara, in present-day Romania, was the first city in the Austrian-Hungarian Monarchy to have electric public lighting on 12 November 1884; 731 lamps were used. On 9 December 1882, Brisbane, Queensland, Australia was introduced to electricity by having a demonstration of 8 arc lights, erected along Queen Street Mall. The power to supply these arc lights was taken from a 10 hp Crompton DC generator driven by a Robey steam engine in a small foundry in Adelaide Street and occupied by J. W. Sutton and Co. In 1884 Walhalla, Victoria, Victoria, had two lamps installed on the main street by the Long Tunnel (Gold) Mining Company. In 1886, the isolated mining town of Waratah in Tasmania was the first to have an extensive system of electrically powered street lighting installed. In 1888, the New South Wales town of Tamworth installed a large system illuminating a significant portion of the city, with over 13 km of streets lit by 52 incandescent lights and 3 arc lights,. Powered a municipal power company, this system gave Tamworth the title of \\"First City of Light\\" in Australia.  Later developments  Incandescent lamps were primarily used for street lighting until the advent of high-intensity gas-discharge lamps. They were often operated at high-voltage series circuits. Series circuits were popular since their higher voltage produced more light per watt consumed. Furthermore, before the invention of photoelectric controls, a single switch or clock could control all the lights in an entire district. To avoid having the entire system go dark if a single lamp burned out, each street lamp was equipped with a device that ensured that the circuit would remain intact. Early series street lights were equipped with isolation transformers. that would allow current to pass across the transformer whether the bulb worked or not. Later the film cutout was invented. This was a small disk of insulating film that separated two contacts connected to the two wires leading to the lamp. If the lamp failed (an open circuit), the current through the string became zero, causing the voltage of the circuit (thousands of volts) to be imposed across the insulating film, penetrating it (see Ohm's law). In this way, the failed lamp was bypassed and power restored to the rest of the district. The street light circuit contained an automatic current regulator, preventing the current from increasing as lamps burned out, preserving the life of the remaining lamps. When the failed lamp was replaced, a new piece of film was installed, once again separating the contacts in the cutout. This system was recognizable by the large porcelain insulator separating the lamp and reflector from the mounting arm. This was necessary because the two contacts in the lamp's base may have operated at several thousand volts above ground. Modern lights low-pressure sodium lamp in the UK low-pressure sodium lamp running at full brightness An unlit high-pressure sodium lamp Low-energy prismatic street lighting Today, street lighting commonly uses high-intensity discharge lamps. Low-pressure sodium (LPS) lamps became commonplace after World War II for their low power consumption and long life. Late in the 20th century high-pressure sodium (HPS) lamps were preferred, taking further the same virtues. Such lamps provide the greatest amount of photopic illumination for the least consumption of electricity.

Lighting for Subsidiary Roads: Using white light sources to balance energy efficiency and visual amenity. Rugby; ILP New street lighting technologies, such as LED or induction lights, emit a white light that provides high levels of scotopic lumens allowing street lights with lower wattages and lower photopic lumens to replace existing street lights. However, there have been no formal specifications written around Photopic/Scotopic adjustments for different types of light sources, causing many municipalities and street departments to hold back on implementation of these new technologies until the standards are updated. Eastbourne in East Sussex UK is currently undergoing a project to see 6000 of its street lights converted to LED and will be closely followed by Hastings in early 2014.ESCC Highways/Colas Electrical Many UK councils are undergoing mass-replacement schemes to LED, and though street lights are being removed along many long stretches of UK motorways (as they are not needed and cause light pollution), LEDs are preferred in areas where lighting installations are necessary. Milan, Italy, is the first major city to have entirely switched to LED lighting. In North America, the city of Mississauga (Canada) was one of the first and biggest LED conversion projects with over 46,000 lights converted to LED technology between 2012 and 2014. It is also one of the first cities in North America to use Smart City technology to control the lights. DimOnOff, a company based in Quebec City, was chosen as a Smart City partner for this project. Photovoltaic-powered LED luminaires are gaining wider acceptance. Preliminary field tests show that some LED luminaires are energy-efficient and perform well in testing environments. In 2007, the Civil Twilight Collective created a variant of the conventional LED streetlight, namely the Lunar-resonant streetlight. These lights increase or decrease the intensity of the streetlight according to the lunar light. This streetlight design thus reduces energy consumption as well as light pollution.

This new measurement has been well-received because the reliance on V(Œª) alone for characterizing night-time light illuminations requires more electric energy. The cost-savings potential of using a new way to measure mesopic lighting scenarios is tremendous.Rea MS, Radetsky LC, Bullough JD. Toward a Model of Outdoor Lighting Scene Brightness. Lighting Research & Technology 2010; in press. Outdoor Site-Lighting Performance (OSP) is a method for predicting and measuring three different aspects of light pollution: glow, trespass and glare. Using this method, lighting specifiers can quantify the performance of existing and planned lighting designs and applications to minimize excessive or obtrusive light leaving the boundaries of a property.  Advantages  Major advantages of street lighting include prevention of accidents and increase in safety.Rea, M. S., J. D. Bullough, C. R. Fay, J. A. Brons, J. Van Derlofske and E. T. Donnell. 2009. Review of the Safety Benefits and Other Effects of Roadway Lighting [report to the National Cooperative Highway Research Program]. Washington, DC: Transportation Research Board. Studies have shown that darkness results in a large number of crashes and fatalities, especially those involving pedestrians; pedestrian fatalities are 3 to 6.75 times more likely in the dark than in daylight.Sullivan, J.M., and Flannigan, M.J.

Towns, cities, and villages use the unique locations provided by lampposts to hang decorative or commemorative banners. Many communities in the US use lampposts as a tool for fund raising via lamppost banner sponsorship programs first designed by a US based lamppost banner manufacturer.\\"Lamppost Banner Sponsorship Programs\\"  Disadvantages  The major criticisms of street lighting are that it can actually cause accidents if misused, and cause light pollution.  Health and safety  There are two optical phenomena that need to be recognized in street light installations. * The loss of night vision because of the accommodation reflex of drivers' eyes is the greatest danger. As drivers emerge from an unlighted area into a pool of light from a street light their pupils quickly constrict to adjust to the brighter light, but as they leave the pool of light the dilation of their pupils to adjust to the dimmer light is much slower, so they are driving with impaired vision. As a person gets older the eye's recovery speed gets slower, so driving time and distance under impaired vision increases. * Oncoming headlights are more visible against a black background than a grey one. The contrast creates greater awareness of the oncoming vehicle. * Stray voltage is also a concern in many cities. Stray voltage can accidentally electrify lampposts and has the potential to injure or kill anyone who comes into contact with the post. There are also physical dangers to the posts of street lamps other than children climbing them for recreational purposes. Street light stanchions (lampposts) pose a collision risk to motorists and pedestrians, particularly those affected by poor eyesight or under the influence of alcohol. This can be reduced by designing them to break away when hit (known as frangible, collapsible, or passively safe supports), protecting them by guardrails, or marking the lower portions to increase their visibility. High winds or accumulated metal fatigue also occasionally topple street lights.  Light pollution  Sign in Leeds, UK indicating part-night lighting, meant to save energy and reduce light pollution. In urban areas, light pollution can hide the stars and interfere with astronomy and the migration of many bird species. In settings near astronomical telescopes and observatories, low pressure sodium lamps may be used. These lamps are advantageous over other lamps such as mercury and metal halide lamps because low pressure sodium lamps emit lower intensity, monochromatic light. Observatories can filter the sodium wavelength out of their observations and virtually eliminate the interference from nearby urban lighting. Full cutoff streetlights also reduce light pollution by reducing the amount of light that is directed at the sky which also improves the luminous efficiency of the light. In the Netherlands, Philips found that birds can get disoriented by the red wavelengths in street lighting, and in response developed alternative lighting that only emit in the green and blue wavelengths of the visible spectrum. The lamps were installed on Ameland in a small scale test. If successful, the technology could be used on ships and offshore installations to avoid luring birds towards the open sea at night.  Energy consumption  As of 2017, globally 70% of all electricity was generated by burning fossil fuels, a source of air pollution and greenhouse gases, and also globally there are approximately 300 million street lights using that electricity. Cities are exploring more efficient energy use, reducing street light power consumption by dimming lights during off-peak hours and switching to high-efficiency LED lamps. Many councils are using a part-night lighting scheme to turn off lighting at quieter times of night. This is typically midnight to 5:30 AM, as seen by the sign on the right. There have, however, been questions about the impact on crime rates. Typical collector road lighting in New York State costs $6,400/mile/year for high pressure sodium at 8.5 kW/mile or $4,000 for light-emitting diode luminaires at 5.4 kW/mile.Humayun Kabir, John D. Bullough, Leora C. Radetsky. \\"Sustainable Roadway Lighting Seminar Final Report \\" New York State Energy Research and Development Authority, July 2014, p.27 Improvements can be made by optimising directionality and shape, however. Transitioning to wide angle lights enabled the doubling of distance between street lights in Flanders from 45 m to 90 m, cutting annual street lighting electricity expenditures to ‚Ç¨9 million for the 2150 km long network that was retrofitted, corresponding to ca. ‚Ç¨4186/km.  Street light control systems  A number of street light control systems have been developed to control and reduce energy consumption of a town's public lighting system. These range from controlling a circuit of street lights and/or individual lights with specific ballasts and network operating protocols. These may include sending and receiving instructions via separate data networks, at high frequency over the top of the low voltage supply or wireless. Street light controllers are smarter versions of the mechanical or electronic timers previously used for street light ON-OFF operation. They come with energy conservation options like twilight saving, staggering or dimming. Many street light controllers come with an astronomical clock for a particular location or a Global Positioning System (GPS) connection to give the best ON-OFF time and energy saving. Accessories A street lamp with a telecell installed. This communicates with the council's central management system. Some intelligent street light controllers also come with Global System for Mobile Communications (GSM), Radio frequency (RF) or General Packet Radio Service (GPRS) communication, user adjusted according to latitude and longitude (low cost type), for better street light management and maintenance. Many street light controllers also come with traffic sensors to manage the lux level of the lamp according to the traffic and to save energy by decreasing lux when there is no traffic. The United States, Canada, India, and many other countries have started introducing street light controllers to their road lighting for energy conservation, street light management and maintenance purpose. Economics Street light controllers can be expensive in comparison with normal timers, and can cost between $100 and $2,500, but most of them return the investment between 6 months and 2 years. As the equipment's lifetime is 7 to 10 years, it saves energy and cost after the initial investment has been recouped.  Image-based street light control  A number of companies are now manufacturing intelligent street lighting that adjust light output based on usage and occupancy, i.e. automating classification of pedestrian versus cyclist, versus automobile, sensing also velocity of movement and illuminating a certain number of streetlights ahead and fewer behind, depending on velocity of movement. Also the lights adjust depending on road conditions, for example, snow produces more reflectance therefore reduced light is required.  Purpose  There are three distinct main uses of street lights, each requiring different types of lights and placement. Using the wrong types of lights can make the situation worse by compromising visibility or safety.  Beacon lights  Decorative but functional lamps in the Plaza at sunset, Samaipata, Bolivia A modest steady light at the intersection of two roads is an aid to navigation because it helps a driver see the location of a side road as they come closer to it, so that they can adjust their braking and know exactly where to turn if they intend to leave the main road or see vehicles or pedestrians. A beacon light's function is to say \\"here I am\\" and even a dim light provides enough contrast against the dark night to serve the purpose. To prevent the dangers caused by a car driving through a pool of light, a beacon light must never shine onto the main road, and not brightly onto the side road. In residential areas, this is usually the only appropriate lighting, and it has the bonus side effect of providing spill lighting onto any sidewalk there for the benefit of pedestrians. On Interstate highways this purpose is commonly served by placing reflectors at the sides of the road.  Roadway lights  Highway 401 in Ontario, Canada Conventional streetlights are used instead of high-mast lighting near airport runway approaches due to the negative effects caused by the latter. Because of the dangers discussed above, roadway lights are properly used sparingly and only when a particular situation justifies increasing the risk. This usually involves an intersection with several turning movements and much signage, situations where drivers must take in much information quickly that is not in the headlights' beam. In these situations (a freeway junction or exit ramp), the intersection may be lit so that drivers can quickly see all hazards, and a well-designed plan will have gradually increasing lighting for approximately a quarter of a minute before the intersection and gradually decreasing lighting after it. The main stretches of highways remain unlighted to preserve the driver's night vision and increase the visibility of oncoming headlights. If there is a sharp curve where headlights will not illuminate the road, a light on the outside of the curve is often justified. If it is desired to light a roadway (perhaps due to heavy and fast multi-lane traffic), to avoid the dangers of casual placement of street lights, it should not be lit intermittently since this requires repeated eye readjustment, which causes eyestrain and temporary blindness when entering and leaving light pools. In this case, the system is designed to eliminate the need for headlights. This is usually achieved with bright lights placed on high poles at close regular intervals so that there is consistent light along the route. The lighting goes from curb to curb.

Usage on rail transport  Lights similar to street lights are used on railway platforms at train stations in the open air. Their purpose is similar to that of beacon lights: they help a train driver see the location of a station at night as the train comes closer to it, so that the driver can adjust the braking and know exactly where to stop. A train station light must never shine directly onto the tracks, and has the bonus side effect of providing spill lighting onto any platform for the benefit of passengers waiting there.  Maintenance  New York City fire alarm pull box indicator mounted on street light Street lighting systems require ongoing maintenance, which can be classified as either reactive or preventative. Reactive maintenance is a direct response to a lighting failure, such as replacing a discharge lamp after it has failed, or replacing an entire lighting unit after it has been hit by a vehicle. Preventative maintenance is scheduled replacement of lighting components, for example replacing all of the discharge lamps in an area of the city when they have reached 85% of their expected life. In the United Kingdom the Roads Liaison Group has issued a Code of Practice recommending specific reactive and preventative maintenance procedures. Some street lights in New York City have an orange or red light on top of the luminaire (light fixture) or a red light attached to the lamppost. This indicates that near to this lighting pole or in the same intersection, there is a fire alarm pull box. Other street lights have a small red light next to the street light bulb; when the small light flashes, it indicates an issue with the electrical current.

Hank Williams began performing on the Hayride in 1948 after his initial rejection from the Grand Ole Opry. After being fired from the Opry on August 11, 1952, Williams returned to the Hayride briefly before his death on New Years Day 1953. Elvis Presley performed on the radio version of the program in 1954 and made his first television appearance on the television version of Louisiana Hayride on March 3, 1955. Hayride history Beginnings Shreveport Municipal Memorial Auditorium The creators of the show took the name from the 1941 book with that title by Harnett Thomas Kane. First broadcast on April 3, 1948 from the Municipal Auditorium in downtown Shreveport, Horace Logan was the original producer and emcee.Shreveport Louisiana Hayride Company, LLC, Hayride History, retrieved 16 February 2012 The musical cast for the inaugural broadcast included: the Bailes Brothers, Johnnie and Jack, the Tennessee Mountain Boys with Kitty Wells, the Four Deacons, Curley Kinsey and the Tennessee Ridge Runners, Harmie Smith, the Ozark Mountaineers, the Mercy Brothers, and Tex Grimsley and the Texas Showboys. Popularization The show was soon made into a Broadway attraction called Louisiana Hayride. Within a year of its debut, the program was so popular that a regional 25-station network was set up to broadcast portions of the show, and was even heard overseas on Armed Forces Radio. The flagship station of the program was KWKH/1130 in Shreveport. The popularity of Louisiana Hayride spawned various incarnations in other parts of the United States, most notably in Cincinnati on WLW radio and later television; its version was dubbed Midwestern Hayride. A KWKH microphone. Horace Logan continued to produce Louisiana Hayride until 1957. In 1999, Logan published a book about the Hayride that received acclaim from reviewers such as Publishers Weekly and Kirkus Reviews. Beginning with the successful first show on April 3, 1948, Louisiana Hayride ranked second only to Nashville's Grand Ole Opry in terms of importance until ABC began telecasting Ozark Jubilee in 1955. Talent-scouting showcase While the Opry, the Jubilee and the Hayride all showcased established stars, the Hayride was where talented, but virtual unknowns, were also given exposure to a large audience. Over the years, country music greats such as Webb Pierce, Kitty Wells, Jimmie Davis, Will Strahan, Slim Whitman, Floyd Cramer, Sonny James, Hank Snow, Faron Young, Johnny Horton, Jim Reeves, Claude King, Jimmy Martin, George Jones, John and The Three Wise Men, Johnny Cash, Frankie Miller, Tex Ritter, Willie Nelson, Bob Wills, Cowboy Jack Hunt & Little Joe Hunt of the Rhythm Ranch Hands, Nat Stuckey, and Lefty Frizzell, among many others, performed on Louisiana Hayride. The Elvis Presley connection By mid-1954, a special 30-minute portion of Louisiana Hayride was being broadcast every Saturday on the AFN Pacific channel of the United Kingdom Scottish Forces Radio Network. On October 16 of that year, Elvis Presley appeared on the radio program. Presley's performance of his debut release on the Sun Records label, \\"That's All Right\\", brought a tepid response, according to former Hayride emcee Frank Page (1925-2013). Nonetheless, Presley was signed to a one-year contract for future appearances. Presley became so popular that after his final appearance on Hayride in 1956, emcee Horace Logan announced to the crowd a phrase that would become famous: \\"Elvis has left the building.\\" The immediate and enormous demand for more of Presley's new kind of rockabilly music actually resulted in a sharp decline in the popularity of the Louisiana Hayride that until that point had been strictly a country music venue. On March 3, 1955, Presley made his first television appearance on the television version of The Louisiana Hayride, carried by KSLA-TV, the CBS affiliate in Shreveport. Cancellation and revivals Elvis Presley in Louisiana Hayride. Within a few years, rock and roll had come to dominate the music scene, and on August 27, 1960, Louisiana Hayride ended its primary run.Luca, Fabris Giovanni, An Interview with Joey Kent, Owner of the Louisiana Hayride Archives, retrieved 16 February 2012 However, KWKH continued to use the Louisiana Hayride name for packaged music tours throughout the 1960s on a bi-weekly, monthly or quarterly basis, finally ending operations entirely in 1969. In August 1974, Shreveport businessman David Kent mounted a country music show originally called Hayride U.S.A., which was retitled Louisiana Hayride in 1975 after KWKH agreed to let Kent use the name. Located at a new dinner theater facility in Bossier City, this new Louisiana Hayride was syndicated on radio and ran until 1987, discovering such talent as Branson fiddle sensation Shoji Tabuchi and popular country singer Linda Davis. Some strictly local performances have been done in the Shreveport area under the name including a 2003 Louisiana Hayride cast reunion called One More 'Ride that featured 60 acts from the original show including Kitty Wells, the Browns, Betty Amos, Homer Bailes, Billy Walker, Mitchell Torok, and Hank Thompson. Barney Cannon (1955‚Äì2009), a KWKH deejay, became a specialist on the history of country music, KWKH, and the Hayride. In August 2009, the Louisiana Hayride (1948‚Äì1960) was inducted into The Louisiana Music Hall of Fame. In 2009, after several years of litigation over the Louisiana Hayride name and trademark, a federal court ruled that Margaret Lewis Warwick owned the rights to the name.Shreveport Louisiana Hayride Co.

The battle took place on October 7, 1780, south of the present-day town of Kings Mountain, North Carolina in what is now rural Cherokee County, South Carolina, where the Patriot militia defeated the Loyalist militia commanded by British Major Patrick Ferguson of the 71st Foot. The battle has been described as \\"the war‚Äôs largest all-American fight\\". Ferguson had arrived in North Carolina in early September 1780 to recruit troops for the Loyalist militia and protect the flank of Lord Cornwallis' main force. Ferguson issued a challenge to the rebel militias to lay down their arms or suffer the consequences. In response, the Patriot militias led by Benjamin Cleveland, James Johnston, William Campbell, John Sevier, Joseph McDowell and Isaac Shelby rallied for an attack on Ferguson. Don Troiani‚Äôs painting of Benjamin Cleveland, who led the Patriot militias, entitled War Prize. Receiving intelligence on the oncoming attack, Ferguson decided to retreat to the safety of Lord Cornwallis' army. However, the Patriots caught up with the Loyalists at Kings Mountain near the border with South Carolina. Achieving a complete surprise, the Patriot militiamen attacked and surrounded the Loyalists, inflicting heavy casualties. After an hour of battle, Ferguson was fatally shot while trying to break the rebel line, after which his men surrendered. Some Patriots gave no quarter until the rebel officers re-established control over their men; they were said to be seeking revenge for alleged killings by Banastre Tarleton's militiamen at the Battle of Waxhaws, under the slogan \\"Remember Tarleton's Quarter.\\" Although victorious, the Patriots had to retreat quickly from the area for fear of Cornwallis' advance. Later they executed nine Loyalist prisoners after a short trial. The battle was a pivotal moment in the Southern campaign. The surprising victory of the American patriot militia over the Loyalists came after a string of rebel defeats at the hands of Lord Cornwallis, and greatly raised the Patriots' morale. With Ferguson dead and his Loyalist militia destroyed, Cornwallis was forced to abandon his plan to invade North Carolina and retreated into South Carolina. Prelude to battle Major Patrick Ferguson was appointed Inspector of Militia on May 22, 1780. His task was to march to the old Tryon County area, raise and organize Loyalist units from the Tory population of the Carolina Backcountry, and protect the left flank of Lord Cornwallis' main body at Charlotte, North Carolina.Buchanan, 202Dameron, 22  Battle of Musgrove's Mill  On the morning of August 18, 1780, two hundred mounted Patriot partisans under joint command of Colonels Isaac Shelby, James Williams, and Elijah Clarke prepared to raid a Loyalist camp at Musgrove's Mill, which controlled the local grain supply and guarded a ford of the Enoree River. The Battle of Musgrove Mill, August 19, 1780, occurred near a ford of the Enoree River, near the present-day border between Spartanburg, Laurens and Union Counties in South Carolina. The Patriots anticipated surprising a garrison of about an equal number of Loyalists, but a local farmer informed them that the Tories had recently been reinforced by about a hundred Loyalist militia and two hundred provincial regulars on their way to join British Major Patrick Ferguson.John Buchanan, The Road to Guilford Courthouse: The American Revolution in the Carolinas (New York: John Wiley & Sons, 1997), 177. \\"Provincial regulars\\" were Americans who enlisted in British army units, as opposed to British regulars and Tory militia. Edgar, 153. The whole battle took perhaps an hour and within that period, sixty-three Tories were killed, an unknown number wounded, and seventy were taken prisoner.Buchanan and Edgar give the losses as 63 killed, 90 wounded, 70 taken prisoner. Buchanan, 178; Edgar, 115. The figures in the text are those from a wayside at Musgrove Mill State Historic Site. The Patriots lost only about four dead and twelve wounded.Buchanan gives Patriot losses as four killed and seven wounded. Buchanan, 179. Some Whig leaders briefly considered attacking the Tory stronghold at Ninety Six, South Carolina; but they hurriedly dispersed after learning that a large Patriot army had been defeated at Camden three days previous.  Pursuit of Shelby  Shelby's forces covered sixty miles with Ferguson in hot pursuit before making their escape.Edgar, 115, Buchanan, 179: \\"In forty-eight hours they had completed two forced marches, had neither slept nor rested, and had fought and won against a superior force an action renowned for its ferocity.\\" In the wake of General Horatio Gates‚Äô blundering defeat at Camden, the victory at Musgrove Mill heartened the Patriots and served as further evidence that the South Carolina backcountry could not be held by the Tories. Shelby and his Overmountain Men crossed back over the Appalachian Mountains and retreated back into the territory of the Watauga Association at Sycamore Shoals in present day Elizabethton, Tennessee, and by the next month on September 25, 1780, Colonels Shelby, John Sevier, and Charles McDowell and their 600 Overmountain Men had combined forces with Col. William Campbell and his 400 Virginia men at the Sycamore Shoals muster in advance of the October 7, 1780, Battle of Kings Mountain north of present day Blacksburg, South Carolina in North Carolina. On September 2, Ferguson and the militia he had already recruited marched west in pursuit of Shelby toward the Appalachian Mountain hill country on what is now the Tennessee/North Carolina border.Buchanan, 204 By September 10, Ferguson had established a base camp at Gilbert Town, North Carolina and, according to Shelby\\"Kings Mountain and Its Heroes\\", Lyman C. Draper, 1881. . Reprinted Overmountain Press, 1996. Johnson City, Tennessee. issued a challenge to the Patriot leaders to lay down their arms or he would \\"lay waste to their country with fire and sword.\\"Buchanan, 208 North Carolina Patriot militia leaders Isaac Shelby and John Sevier, from the Washington District (now northeast Tennessee), met and agreed to lead their militiamen against him.  Muster at Sycamore Shoals  Patriot leaders also sent word to a Virginia militia leader, William Campbell, asking him to join them at Sycamore Shoals.Buchanan, 210‚Äì211 Campbell called on Benjamin Cleveland to bring his Wilkes County, North Carolina militia to the rendezvous.Buchanan, 212 The detachments of Shelby, Sevier and Campbell were met by 160 North Carolina militiamen led by Charles McDowell and his brother Joseph. Campbell's cousin, Arthur Campbell, brought 200 more Virginians.Buchanan, 213 About 1,100 volunteers from southwest Virginia and today's northeast Tennessee, known as the \\"Overmountain Men\\" because they had settled into the wilderness west of the Appalachian Mountains ridgeline, mustered at the rendezvous on September 25, 1780, at Sycamore Shoals near the modern city of Elizabethton, Tennessee. Their movement had been made possible by easing tensions with the Cherokee, thanks to diplomacy by Benjamin Cleveland's brother-in-law, Indian agent Joseph Martin. The Overmountain Men crossed Roan Mountain the next day, and proceeded in a southerly direction for about thirteen days in anticipation of fighting the British Loyalist forces. By September 30, they had reached Quaker Meadows, the Burke County, North Carolina home of the McDowell brothers, where they united with Benjamin Cleveland and 350 men.Buchanan, 215 Now 1400 strong, the Patriots marched to South Mountain, North Carolina,Buchanan, 217 The five colonels leading the Patriot force (Shelby, Sevier, William Campbell, Joseph McDowell and Cleveland) chose William Campbell as the nominal commander, but they agreed that all five would act in council to command their combined army.Buchanan, 218 Lloyd Branson's 1915 depiction of the Patriot militias joining up Meanwhile, two deserters from the Patriot militia reached Patrick Ferguson and informed him of the large body of militia advancing towards him. Waiting three days for reasons that are still unclear, Ferguson ordered a retreat to Lord Cornwallis and the British main forces in Charlotte, sending a message to Cornwallis requesting reinforcements. The request did not reach Cornwallis until one day after the battle. On October 1, Ferguson reached North Carolina's Broad River, where he issued another pugnacious public letter, calling the local militia to join him lest they be \\"pissed upon by a set of mongrels\\" (the Overmountain Men).Buchanan, 219 On October 4, the Patriot militia reached Ferguson's former camp at Gilbert Town,Buchanan, 220 where thirty Georgia militiamen joined them, anxious for action. On October 6, they reached Cowpens, South Carolina, (site of the future Battle of Cowpens), where they received word that Ferguson was east of them, heading towards Charlotte and Cornwallis. They hurried to catch him.Buchanan, 221 Rebel spies reported Ferguson was making camp on Kings Mountain with some 1200 men.Buchanan, 223 Ferguson, rather than pushing on until he reached Charlotte and safety (just a day's march away), camped at Kings Mountain and sent Cornwallis another letter asking for reinforcements.Buchanan, 225 Kings Mountain is one of many rocky forested hills in the upper Piedmont, near the border between North and South Carolina. It is shaped like a footprint with the highest point at the heel, a narrow instep, and a broad rounded toe. The Loyalists camped on a ridge west of Kings Pinnacle, the highest point on Kings Mountain. Needing to hurry, the Patriot militia put 900 men on horseback and rode for Kings Mountain. They left immediately, marching through the night of the 6th and morning of the 7th, even though the rain never stopped. By sunrise of the 7th, they forded the Broad River, fifteen miles from Kings Mountain.Buchanan, 225-6 By early afternoon they arrived and immediately surrounded the ridge and attacked.Buchanan, 227 Battle Kings Mountain Battle layout The battle opened about 3 p.m.,Dameron, 57 when the 900 Patriots (including John Crockett, father of Davy Crockett), approached the steep base of the western ridge. They formed eight detachments of 100 to 200 men each. Ferguson was unaware that the Patriots had caught up to him and his 1,100 men. He was the only regular British soldier in the command,Allen, p.89 composed entirely of Loyalist Carolina militia, except for the 100 or so red-uniformed Provincials (enlisted colonials) from New York. He had not thought it necessary to fortify his camp.Buchanan, 229 The Patriots caught the Loyalists by surprise. Loyalist officer Alexander Chesney later wrote he didn't know the Patriots were anywhere near them until the shooting started. As the screaming Patriots charged up the hill, Captain Abraham de Peyster turned to Ferguson and said, \\"These things are ominous ‚Äî these are the damned yelling boys!\\" Two parties, led by Colonels John Sevier and William Campbell, assaulted the mountain's \\"heel\\"‚Äîthe smallest in area, but its highest point. The other detachments, led by Colonels Shelby, Williams, Lacey, Cleveland, Hambright, Winston and McDowell, attacked the main Loyalist position, surrounding the \\"ball\\" base beside the \\"heel\\" crest of the mountain. No one in the Patriot army held command once the fighting started. Each detachment fought independently under the previously agreed to plan to surround and destroy the Loyalists.Buchanan, 230 The Patriots crept up the hill and fired from behind rocks and trees. Ferguson rallied his troops and launched a desperate bayonet-charge against Campbell and Sevier. Lacking bayonets, the Patriots ran down the hill and into the woods. Campbell soon rallied his troops, returned to the hill, and resumed firing. Ferguson ordered two more bayonet charges during the battle. This became the pattern of the battle; the Patriots would charge up the hill, then the Tories would charge down the hill with fixed bayonets, driving the Patriots off the slopes and into the woods. Once the charge was spent and the Tories returned to their positions, the Patriots would reform in the woods, return to the base of the hill, and charge up the hill again. During one of the charges, Colonel Williams was killed, and Colonel McDowell was wounded. Firing was difficult for the Loyalists, since the Patriots constantly moved using cover and concealment to their advantage. Furthermore, the downhill angle of the hill contributed to the Loyalists overshooting their marks.Buchanan, 231-2 After an hour of combat, Loyalist casualties were heavy. Ferguson rode back and forth across the hill, blowing a silver whistle he used to signal charges. Shelby, Sevier and Campbell reached the top of the hill behind the Loyalist position and attacked Ferguson's rear. The Loyalists were driven back into their camp, where they began to surrender. Ferguson drew his sword and hacked down any small white flags that he saw popping up, but he appeared to know that the end was near. In an attempt to rally his faltering men, Ferguson shouted out \\"Hurrah, brave boys, the day is ours!\\"Hibbert, 292 He gathered a few officers together and tried to cut through the Patriot ring, but Sevier's men fired a volley and Ferguson was shot and dragged by his horse behind the Patriot line.Buchanan, 232 There he was confronted by an opposing rebel officer, who demanded a surrender from the major. Ferguson shot and killed the man with his pistol in a final act of defiance, but was immediately shot dead by multiple Patriots on the spot. When the Patriots recovered his corpse, they counted seven bullet wounds.Buchanan, 234 Seeing their leader fall, the Loyalists began to surrender. Some Patriots did not want to take prisoners, as they were eager to avenge the Battle of Waxhaws or 'Tarleton's Quarter,' in which Banastre Tarleton's forces killed a sizable number of Abraham Buford's Continental soldiers after the latter tried to surrender. (At Waxhaws, Tarleton's horse was shot, pinning him to the ground and leading his men to believe their commanding officer had been killed under a white flag of surrender.)Fredrickson p.662 Also, other Patriots were seemingly unaware that the Loyalists were trying to surrender. Loyalist Captain de Peyster, in command after Ferguson was killed, sent out an emissary with a white flag, asking for quarter. For several minutes, the Patriots rejected de Peyster's white flag and continued firing, many of them shouting, \\"Give 'em Tarleton's Quarter!\\" and \\"Give them Buford's play!\\" A significant number of the surrendering Loyalists were killed or wounded including the white flag emissary.Wallace, 229 When de Peyster sent out a second white flag, a few of the Patriot officers, including Campbell and Sevier, ran forward and took control by ordering their men to cease fire.Buchanan, 233 They took about 700 Loyalist prisoners. Aftermath Map spot for Blacksburg, South Carolina The Battle of Kings Mountain lasted 65 minutes.Dameron, 75 The Loyalists suffered 290 killed, 163 wounded, and 668 taken prisoner. The Patriot militia suffered 28 killed and 60 wounded. The Patriots had to move out quickly for fear that Cornwallis would advance to meet them.Buchanan, 237 Loyalist prisoners well enough to walk were herded to camps several miles from the battlefield. The dead were buried in shallow graves and wounded were left on the field to die. Ferguson's corpse was later reported to have been desecrated and wrapped in oxhide before burial.Hibbert, 293 Both victors and captives came near to starvation on the march due to a lack of supplies in the hastily organized Patriot army. On October 14, the retreating Patriot force held drumhead courts-martial of Loyalists on various charges (treason, desertion from Patriot militias, incitement of Indian rebellion). Passing through the Sunshine community in what is now Rutherford County, N.C., the retreat halted on the property of the Biggerstaff family. Aaron Biggerstaff, a Loyalist, had fought in the battle and been mortally wounded. His brother Benjamin was a Patriot and was being held as a prisoner-of-war on a British ship docked at Charleston, S.C. Their cousin John Moore was the Loyalist commander at the earlier Battle of Ramsour's Mill (modern Lincolnton, N.C.), in which many of the combatants at Kings Mountain had participated on one side or the other. While stopped on the Biggerstaff land, the rebels convicted 36 Loyalist prisoners. Some were testified against by Patriots who had previously fought alongside them and later changed sides. Nine of the prisoners were hanged before Isaac Shelby brought an end to the proceedings.Buchanan, 238-9 His decision to halt the executions came after an impassioned plea for mercy from one of the Biggerstaff women, although accounts vary as to whether it was Martha Biggerstaff, Aaron's wife, or Mary Van Zant Biggerstaff, Benjamin's wife. Many of the Patriots dispersed over the next few days, while all but 130 of the Loyalist prisoners escaped while being led in single file through woodlands. The column finally made camp at Salem, North Carolina.Buchanan, 240, 340 Kings Mountain was a pivotal moment in the history of the American Revolution. Coming after a series of disasters and humiliations in the Carolinas‚Äîthe fall of Charleston and capture of the American army there, the destruction of another American army at the Battle of Camden, the Waxhaws Massacre‚Äîthe surprising decisive victory at Kings Mountain was a great boost to Patriot morale. The Tories of the Carolina back country were broken as a military force.Buchanan, 241 Additionally, the destruction of Ferguson's command and the looming threat of Patriot militia in the mountains caused Lord Cornwallis to cancel his plans to invade North Carolina; he instead evacuated Charlotte and retreated to South Carolina. He would not return to North Carolina until early 1781, when he was chasing Nathanael Greene after the Americans had dealt British forces another defeat at the Battle of Cowpens.

Many types of cartons are used in packaging. Sometimes a carton is also called a box. Types of cartons Folding cartons Typical blank for folding carton A carton is a type of packaging suitable for food, pharmaceuticals, hardware, and many other types of products. Folding cartons are usually combined into a tube at the manufacturer and shipped flat (knocked down) to the packager. Tray styles have a solid bottom and are often shipped as flat blanks and assembled by the packager. Some also are self-erecting. High-speed equipment is available to set up, load, and close the cartons. Egg carton Egg cartons Egg cartons or trays are designed to protect whole eggs while in transit. Traditionally, these have been made of molded pulp. This uses recycled newsprint which is molded into a shape which protects the eggs. More recently, egg cartons have also been made from expanded polystyrene and PET. Aseptic carton Cartons for liquids can be fabricated from laminates of liquid packaging board, foil, and polyethylene. Most are based on either Tetra Pak or SIG Combibloc systems. One option is to have the printed laminate supplied on a roll. The carton is cut, scored, and formed at the packager. A second option is to have the pre-assembled tubes delivered to the packager for completion and filling. These are suited for aseptic processing and are used for milk, soup, juice, etc. Paperboard-based cartons are lighter compared to a similarly-sized steel can, but are more difficult to recycle. Some open-loop recycling operations pelletize or flatten ground-up cartons for use in building materials; closed-loop recycling is possible by separating the layers before processing, though some recyclers only recycle the cardboard fibers. Gable top Gable top carton of cream Gable top cartons are often used for liquid products such as milk, juice, etc. These use polyethylene-coated paperboard or other liquid packaging board and sometimes a foil laminate. Most are opened by pushing open the gables at the top back and pulling the top (spout) out. Some have fitments to assist in opening and eating the contents. Packaging history The history of the carton goes as far back as 1879 in a Brooklyn, New York, factory operated by Robert Gair. A die-ruled, cut, and scored paperboard into a single impression of a folded carton. By 1896, the National Biscuit Company was the first to use cartons to package crackers. The next development of folded paper used to construct cartons are mentioned by Dr. Winslow of Seattle, Washington, in 1908 who claimed that paper milk containers were commercially sold in San Francisco and Los Angeles as early as 1906. The inventor of this carton was G.W. Maxwell. However, it was in 1915 that John Van Wormer of Toledo, Ohio, was granted the first patent for the first \\"paper bottle,\\" which was the first folded blank box for holding milk. He called it the \\"Pure-Pak.\\" The milk carton was original in the sense that it could be folded, glued, filled with milk, and sealed at a dairy farm. The early 1960s brought many automated systems to help with production of repeatable processes. It was at that time that an engineer from Detroit, Michigan, named Mario Lepore developed a machine to fold and seal a gable top paper carton. An early American packaging industry pioneer was the Kieckhefer Container Company, which was run by John W. Kieckhefer. The company excelled in the use of fibre shipping containers, which especially included the paper milk carton. In 1957, through an exchange of stock, the Kieckhefer Container Co. holdings were merged with the Weyerhauser Timber Company of Tacoma, Washington. Shape Tetrahedral carton of milk Although quite often shaped like a cuboid, it is not uncommon to find cartons lacking right angles and straight edges, as in squrounds used for ice cream. Tetrahedrons and other shapes are available. Cartons with a hexagonal or octagonal cross sections are sometimes used for specialty items. Materials Cartons can be made from many materials: paperboard, duplex, white kraft, recycled and many more various plastics, or a composite. Some are \\"food grade\\" for direct contact with foods. Many cartons are made out of a single piece of paperboard. Depending on the need, this paperboard can be waxed or coated with polyethylene to form a moisture barrier. This may serve to contain a liquid product or keep a powder dry. Artistic design In art history, the carton (pronounced the French way) was a drawing on heavy pasteboard or paperboard, used as life-size design for the manufacture in an atelier of a valuable tapestry, such as a gobelin. During the weaving it hung behind the tapestry in the making, a time-consuming process thus in a creative sense simplified to 'mechanical' painting-by-numbers. As these were extremely valuable, often commanded by the very richest art-buyers, including princes who hung them in their palaces and even took them on their travels as prestigious displays of wealth, often with a visual message, especially the world-famous Flemish ateliers were deemed worthy to have cartons made by some of the greatest graphic artists of the time, including such celebrated painters as Rubens. In the 1980s, milk cartons in the United States often printed photos of missing children with the hope that someone would recognize the photograph and provide information to police. Carton-pierre Carton- pierre was a material used for the making of raised ornaments for wall and ceiling decoration.

After graduating in economics from Government College Lahore, he won a scholarship to Cambridge University obtaining a second degree. Subsequently, he received his PhD from Yale University and conducted postdoctoral research at the Harvard Kennedy School. He returned to Pakistan to serve as the Chief Economist of the Planning Commission throughout the 1960s. In 1970 after the fall of Field Marshal Ayub Khan he moved to the Washington DC to serve at the World Bank Director of Policy Planning until 1982, where he played a major role in reorienting its approach to assisting development in low income countries. He returned to Pakistan in 1982 and in 1985 became the country's Finance Minister, overseeing a period of economic liberalisation. In 1989 he moved back to U.S. where he served as the Special Adviser to the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) Administrator William Henry Draper. At the UNDP, Haq led the establishment of the Human Development Report and the widely respected HDI, which measures development by well-being, rather than by income alone. He returned to Pakistan in 1996 to establish the Human Development Center in Islamabad. Haq is considered to have had a profound effect on global development. Haq's 1995 book Reflections on Human Development is said to have opened new avenues to policy proposals for human development paradigms, such as the 20:20 Global Compact.Mahbub ul Haq (1996) Reflections on Human Development. Oxford University Press. 288 pages. Amartya Sen and Tam Dalyell termed Haq's work to have \\"brought about a major change in the understanding and statistical accounting of the process of development.\\" The Economist called him \\"one of the visionaries of international development.\\" He was widely regarded as \\"the most articulate and persuasive spokesman for the developing world\\".  Early life and Education  Mahbub ul Haq was born in GurdaspurBaru, Sanjaya (1988) Mahbub ul Haq and Human Development: A Tribute, Economic and Political Weekly, Vol. 33, No. 35 (Aug. 29 - Sep. 4), pp. 2275-2279 (5 pages) in pre-independence Punjab province, now in the Republic of India, on 24 February 1934. His teenage years saw religious violence and forced migration associated with the independence of Pakistan and India in August 1947. He and his family narrowly escaped from being killed by the Sikhs in one of the refugee trains heading to Pakistan. The nature of the religious violence left a lasting impression on Mahbub ul Haq. After reaching Lahore, Haq was given government-sponsored housing and decided to continue his education. In 1953 Haq graduated with a degree in economics from Government College Lahore. He earned a scholarship to attend Cambridge University where he earned another BA in the same discipline. At Cambridge, Haq gained his BA alongside Amartya Sen, with whom he formed a close, lifelong friendship. After renewing his scholarship, Haq went to United States for his doctoral studies at Yale University and earned a PhD in Economics. Later, Haq carried out post-doctoral work at Harvard University in 1960-61. Career Upon returning to Pakistan in 1957 at the age of 23, Haq joined the Planning Commission as Assistant Chief while it prepared its first Five-Year Plan. Influenced by the dominant economic thought in American academia, Haq advocated capitalism as the economic base of the national economy and helped guide the government to apply free-market principles to boost the economy. This approach was wholeheartedly embraced by the military government of General Ayub Khan after it came to power in October 1958. By the 1960s as Chief Economist of the Planning Commission Haq was delivering speeches all over the country in support these economic policies. While the international community was applauding Pakistan as a model of development, Haq developed concerns that all was not well with the distribution of the benefits of growth. Rapid economic development made Haq's team doubt the long-term viability of such a pattern of growth, and he increasingly supported heavier taxation of the asset owning classes. In a widely reported speech to the Applied Economics Research Centre at the University of Karachi in April 1968, Haq alleged that \\"22 industrial family groups had come to dominate the economic and financial life-cycle of Pakistan and that they controlled about two-thirds of industrial assets, 80% of banking and 79% of insurance assets in the industrial domain.\\" The list included Dawood family of Dawood Group, Saigols of Saigol Group, Adamjees of Adamjee Group, Colony, Fancy, Valika, Jalil, Bawany, Crescent, Wazir Ali, Gandhara, Ispahani, House of Habib, Khyber, Nishat Group, Beco, Gul Ahmed Group, Arag, Hafiz, Karim, Milwala and Dada.The 22 Families These revelations played a major role in mobilising millions in a massive grassroots protest movement that led to Field Marshal Ayub Khan's overthrow in March 1969. Following Ayub's fall, Haq accepted an invitation from Robert McNamara, president of the World Bank to serve as his Director of Policy Planning. During his tenure (1970-82), Haq influenced the Bank's development philosophy and lending policies, steering more attention towards poverty alleviation programmes and increased allocations for small farm production, nutrition, education, water supply and other social sectors. He wrote a studyMahbub ul Haq (1976) The Poverty Curtain: Choices for the Third World. Columbia University Press. 247 pages. that served as a precursor to the basic needs and human development approaches of the 1980s. While working at the World Bank, Haq was invited by Prime Minister Zulfiqar Ali Bhutto to join the Ministry of Finance, but ultimately refused as he had strong opposing views on Bhutto's program of nationalization. In 1973 Bhutto again asked Mahbub to return to Pakistan and join his administration in devising a strategy that would lift a large number of Pakistanis out of poverty and stagflation, but their major differences persuaded Haq not to return. In 1982 Haq returned at the request of General Zia-ul-Haq's military government, where he assumed directorship of the Planning Commission. In 1983 Haq was appointed Minister of Planning and Development. According to Parvez Hasan 'under Mahbub's direction, the Planning Commission became once again a lively place and began to exert powerful influence on social sector issues, including education and family planning, much neglected in earlier Zia years. In 1985 President Zia oversaw a partial return to democracy with so-called 'non-party' general elections, and Haq was sworn in as Minister Finance, Planning and Economic Affairs in the PML government of Mohammed Khan Junejo. Haq's is credited with significant tax reforms, deregulation of the economy, increased emphasis on human development and several initiatives for poverty alleviation.A Tribute to Dr Haq at Human Development Centre website Despite this major acceleration in social spending Haq was forced to resign in January 1986 due to protests at his reforms. He was reappointed as Finance Minister in the caretaker administration established by Gen. Zia-ul-Haq after he dismissed the Junejo government in May 1988. Haq's term ended when the PPP government of Benazir Bhutto was sworn in following the general elections of November 1988. In 1989, he was appointed as Special Advisor to the UNDP Administrator William Draper in New York City to produce the first Human Development Report.UNDP (1990) Human Development Report 1990: Concept and Measurement of Human Development. Oxford University press. In this capacity, Haq initiated the concept of Human Development and the Human Development Report as its Project Director. He led a team of international scholars including Amartya Sen, Paul Streeten, Inge Kaul, Frances Stewart, and Richard Jolly to prepare annual Human Development Reports. In 1996, Haq founded the Human Development Center in Islamabad, Pakistan ‚Äî a policy research institute committed to organizing professional research, policy studies and seminars in the area of human development, with a special focus on South Asia. In acknowledgement of his contributions, the Human Development Centre, Islamabad was officially renamed following his death as the Mahbub ul Haq Human Development Centre on 13 December 1998, with Mrs. Khadija Haq as president. Death Haq died on 16 July 1998 in New York City at the age of 64, leaving behind his wife Khadija Haq, son Farhan and daughter Toneema. Reactions to his death included: * 'Mahbub ul Haq's untimely death is a loss to the world ...', Kofi Annan, UN Secretary General. * '... probably more than anyone else, (Mahbub) provided the intellectual impetus for the Bank's commitment to poverty reduction in the early 1970s. [...] His unique contributions were trend setters for the world and focused attention on the South Asian social realities, urging all of us to look at the dark corners of our social milieus'. James Wolfensohn, President of the World Bank.  Posthumous Recognition  In honour of Haq, UNDP established the Mahbub ul Haq Award for Outstanding Contribution to Human Development, which is presented to a leading national, regional or world figure who has demonstrated outstanding commitment to furthering human development understanding and progress.

He played for the Los Angeles Dodgers, Montreal Expos, Toronto Blue Jays, Arizona Diamondbacks, Philadelphia Phillies, and Baltimore Orioles. Daal threw a deceptive fastball that rarely exceeded 85 MPH, a good changeup, and a decent curveball. When he had both control and command of his pitches, he could be difficult to hit. Daal was somewhat of a two-career pitcher who began as a reliever for the Dodgers, Expos, and Blue Jays, between 1993 and 1997, then became a starter with the Diamondbacks in 1998. In 2000, Daal led the big leagues in losses with 19. On August 15, 2001, Daal combined with fellow Venezuelan pitchers Giovanni Carrara, Kelvim Escobar, and Freddy Garc√≠a for wins in their respective starts: Daal, in a Phillies victory over the Brewers, 8‚Äì6; Carrara, of the Dodgers, beating Montreal, 13‚Äì1; Escobar, of the Blue Jays, over Oakland, 5‚Äì2, and Garc√≠a, of Seattle, against the Red Sox, 6‚Äì2. This marked the first time in MLB history that four Venezuelan starting pitchers recorded a win on the same day. Prior to the 2003 season, Daal signed a two-year contract with Baltimore; however, after undergoing arthroscopic surgery on his left shoulder in early 2004, he was out for that entire season ‚Äî and would never appear in a major league game, again.

In parliamentary procedure, it is a debatable main motion that could be adopted by a majority vote. Among the forms that it can take are a stern rebuke by a legislature, a spiritual penalty imposed by a church, or a negative judgment pronounced on a theological proposition. It is usually non-binding (requiring no compulsory action from the censured party), unlike a motion of no confidence (which may require the referenced party to resign).  Parliamentary procedure  Explanation and use The motion to censure is a main motion expressing a strong opinion of disapproval that could be debated by the assembly and adopted by a majority vote. According to Robert's Rules of Order (Newly Revised) (RONR), it is an exception to the general rule that \\"a motion must not use language that reflects on a member's conduct or character, or is discourteous, unnecessarily harsh, or not allowed in debate.\\" Demeter's Manual notes, \\"It is a reprimand, aimed at reformation of the person and prevention of further offending acts.\\" While there are many possible grounds for censuring members of an organization, such as embezzlement, absenteeism, drunkenness, and so on, the grounds for censuring a presiding officer are more limited:Demeter, p. 261 More serious disciplinary procedures may involve fine, suspension, or expulsion. In some cases, the assembly may declare the chair vacant and elect a new chairman for the meeting; or a motion can be made to permanently remove an officer (depending on the rules of the assembly). Procedure If the motion is made to censure the presiding officer, then he must relinquish the chair to the vice-president until the motion is disposed. But during this time, the vice-president is still referred to as \\"Mr. Vice President\\" in debate, since a censure is merely a warning and not a proceeding that removes the president from the chair.Demeter, p. 263 An officer being censured is not referred to by name in the motion, but simply as \\"the president\\", \\"the treasurer\\", etc. After a motion to censure is passed, the chair (or the vice-president, if the presiding officer is being censured) addresses the censured member by name. He may say something to the effect of, \\"Brother F, you have been censured by vote of the assembly. A censure indicates the assembly's disapproval of your conduct\\". ([at meetings.] This phrase should not be included as the cause for censure may have occurred outside of meetings.) \\"A censure is a warning. It is the warning voice of suspension or expulsion. Please take due notice thereof and govern yourself accordingly.\\" Or, if the chair is being censured, the vice-president may say, \\"Mr. X, you have been censured by the assembly for the reasons contained in the resolution. I now return to you the presidency.\\"Demeter, p. 264 Politics In politics, a censure is an alternative to more serious measures against misconduct or dereliction of duty. (Demeter) Canada Censure is an action by the House of Commons or the Senate rebuking the actions or conduct of an individual. The power to censure is not directly mentioned in the constitutional texts of Canada but is derived from the powers bestowed upon both Chambers through section 18 of the Constitution Act, 1867. A motion of censure can be introduced by any Member of Parliament or Senator and passed by a simple majority for censure to be deemed to have been delivered. In addition, if the censure is related to the privileges of the Chamber, the individual in question could be summoned to the bar of the House or Senate (or, in the case of a sitting member, to that member's place in the chamber) to be censured, and could also face other sanctions from the house, including imprisonment. Normally, censure is exclusively an on-the-record rebuke ‚Äî it is not equivalent to a motion of no confidence, and a prime minister can continue in office even if censured. Louis Riel faced Parliamentary censure for his role in the Red River Rebellion, and was expelled from Parliament 16 April 1874. Japan In Japan, a censure motion is a motion that can be passed by the House of Councillors, the upper house of the National Diet. No-confidence motions are passed in the House of Representatives, and this generally doesn't happen as this house is controlled by the ruling party. On the other hand, censure motions have been passed by opposition parties several times during the Democratic Party of Japan (DPJ) administrations from 2009. The motions were combined with a demand from the opposition to take a certain action, and a refusal to cooperate with the ruling party on key issues unless some actions were taken. For example, on 20 April 2012 the opposition Liberal Democratic Party (LDP), Your Party and New Renaissance Party submitted censure motions against ministers of Prime Minister Yoshihiko Noda's Democratic Party of Japan-controlled cabinet. They censured Minister of Defense Naoki Tanaka and Minister of Land Takeshi Maeda,The Japan Times Censure motions passed on ministers April 21, 2012 Retrieved on 29 August 2012 and refused to cooperate with the government on passing an increase to Japan's consumption tax from 5% to 10%. Noda had \\"staked his political life\\" on passing the consumption tax increase, so on 4 June 2012, Noda reshuffled his cabinet and replaced Tanaka and Maeda.The Asahi Shimbun Noda gets rid of censured Cabinet ministers June 4, 2012 Retrieved on 29 August 2012 On 28 August 2012, a censure motion was passed by the LDP and the New Komeito Party against Prime Minister Noda himself. The opposition parties were to boycott debate in the chamber, it means that bills passed in the DPJ-controlled House of Representatives cannot be enacted.The Wall Street Journal Japan's Prime Minister Hit With Censure Motion August 29, 2012 Retrieved on 29 August 2012 Australia The Senate, the upper house of the Australian Parliament, has censured two Prime Ministers in recent decades that of Paul Keating and John Howard. The Australian Attorney General George Brandis was censured on 2 March 2015 for his treatment of Human Rights Commission President Gillian Triggs. Senator for Queensland Fraser Anning was censured for remarks he made about the Christchurch mosque shootings. United Kingdom In the UK The Crown cannot be prosecuted for breaches of the law even where it has no exemption, such as from the Health and Safety at Work etc. Act. A Crown Censure is the method by which the Health and Safety Executive records, but for Crown immunity, there would be sufficient evidence to secure a H&S; conviction against the Crown.HSE, Enforcement against Crown bodies, Retrieved 5 November 2015 United States Censure is the public reprimanding of a public official for inappropriate conduct or voting behavior. When the president is censured, it serves only as a condemnation and has no direct effect on the validity of presidency, nor are there any other particular legal consequences. Unlike impeachment, censure has no basis in the Constitution or in the rules of the Senate and House of Representatives. It derives from the formal condemnation of either congressional body of their own members. = Chronology = To date, Andrew Jackson is the only sitting President of the United States to be successfully censured, although his censure was subsequently expunged from official records, and James K. Polk was also censured by the House of Representatives in 1848. Since 2017, several Members of Congress have introduced motions to censure President Donald Trump for various controversies, including as a possible substitute for impeachment during the Trump-Ukraine scandal, but none have been successful. On 2 December 1954, Republican Senator Joseph McCarthy from Wisconsin was censured by the United States Senate for failing to cooperate with the subcommittee that was investigating him, and for insulting the committee that was recommending his censure. On 10 June 1980, Democratic Representative Charles H. Wilson from California was censured by the House of Representatives for \\"financial misconduct\\", as a result of the \\"Koreagate\\" scandal of 1976. \\"Koreagate\\" was an American political scandal involving South Koreans seeking influence with members of Congress. An immediate goal seems to have been reversing President Richard Nixon's decision to withdraw troops from South Korea. It involved the KCIA (now the National Intelligence Service) funneling bribes and favors through Korean businessman Tongsun Park in an attempt to gain favor and influence. Some 115 members of Congress were implicated. On 20 July 1983, Representatives Dan Crane, a Republican from Illinois, and Gerry Studds, a Democrat from Massachusetts, were censured by the House of Representatives for their involvement in the 1983 Congressional page sex scandal.Committee on Standards of Official Conduct On 12 July 1999, the U.S. House of Representatives censured (in a 355-to-0 vote) a scientific publication titled \\"A Meta-analytic Examination of Assumed Properties of Child Sexual Abuse Using College Samples\\", by Bruce Rind, Philip Tromovich, and Robert Bauserman; (see Rind et al. controversy) which was published in the American Psychological Association's \\"Psychological Bulletin (July 1998).\\"Skeptical Inquirer\\" Vol.24, No.1 Jan/Feb 2000 p20,1 Kenneth K. Berry & Jason Berry \\"The Congressional Censure of a Research Paper: Return of the Inquisition?\\" On 31 July 2007, retired Army General Philip Kensinger was censured by the United States Army for misleading investigators of the Pat Tillman death in 2004. On 6 July 2009, South Carolina Governor Mark Sanford was censured by the South Carolina Republican Party executive committee for traveling overseas on taxpayer funds to visit his mistress. On 13 October 2009, the mayor of Sheboygan, Wisconsin, Bob Ryan, was censured due to a YouTube video that showed him making sexually vulgar comments about his sister-in-law taken at a bar on a cell phone. The censure was voted 15-0 by the Sheboygan Common Council. His powers were also quickly reduced by the Common Council, and he was ultimately removed from office two and a half years later in a recall election for continued improprieties in office. In November 2009, members of the Charleston County Republican Party censured Republican Senator Lindsey Graham of South Carolina in response to his voting to bail out banks and other Wall Street firms, and for his sentiments on immigration reform and cap-and-trade climate change legislation. On 2 December 2010, Democratic Rep. Charlie Rangel from the State of New York was censured after an ethics panel found he violated House rules, specifically failing to pay taxes on a villa in the Dominican Republic, improperly soliciting charitable donations, and running a campaign office out of a rent-stabilized apartment meant for residential use. On 4 January 2010, members of the Lexington County Republican Party censured Senator Lindsey Graham of South Carolina for his support of government intervention in the private financial sector and for ‚Äúdebasing‚Äù longstanding Republican beliefs in economic competition. On 22 January 2013, the Arizona Republican Party censured longtime Sen. John McCain for what it called his ‚Äúlong and terrible‚Äù record of voting with liberal Democrats on some issues. Catholic Church Canon law In canon law, a censure is a penalty imposed primarily for the purpose of breaking contumacy and reintegrating the offender in the community.John P. Beal, James A. Coriden, Thomas J. Green (editors), New Commentary on the Code of Canon Law (Paulist Press 2002 ), p. 1534 The ecclesiastical censures are excommunication and interdict, which can be imposed on any member of the Church, and suspension, which only affects clerics. Theological censure In Catholic theology, a theological censure is a doctrinal judgment by which the church stigmatizes certain teachings detrimental to faith or morals.

Operation Tractable was launched to break through the German lines and capture the tactically important towns of Falaise and then the smaller towns of Trun and Chambois and to encircle large German formations. On August 18, 1944, Canadian forces captured Trun, while General Stanis≈Çaw Maczek's Polish 1st Armoured Division headed towards Chambois to encircle 110,000 Germans in the Falaise pocket. Small corridors east of Chambois allowed small numbers of Germans to escape the pocket and head towards the river Seine. At the same time, to the south of Chambois, the American 90th Infantry Division pushed north to close the pocket at Chambois. On the morning of August 19 Saint-Lambert-sur-Dives was taken by Canadian forces, and at midday Polish forces attacked towards Chambois and against German positions on what was known as Hill 262, located north-east of Chambois. Polish forces then attacked the outskirts of Chambois. Chambois had been heavily shelled and was in ruins with German soldiers from various battered units flowing into the area. To the east of Chambois Polish and American forces linked up to finally close the Falaise pocket. The Allies continued to attack retreating elements of the German 5th and 7th armies and the 116th Panzer Division. A German counter-attack organised by General Paul Hausser on August 20 failed to break Polish lines but did allow further German troops to escape the pocket. German troops and vehicles were trapped on the congested narrow roads and were easy prey for Allied artillery and air attacks. Late on August 20, Chambois finally fell to Polish forces and the Falaise pocket was sealed on August 21 with approximately 50,000 Germans trapped inside. Aftermath The battle resulted in the destruction of most of Army Group B west of the Seine, which opened the way to Paris and the Franco-German border for the Allied armies on the Western Front. Remnants of German units retreated east towards the Seine but left much of their heavy armour and artillery behind. General Hausser was wounded in the jaw during the battle but escaped the encirclement.

Tube Alloys was the research and development programme authorised by the United Kingdom, with participation from Canada, to develop nuclear weapons during the Second World War. Starting before the Manhattan Project in the United States, the British efforts were kept classified, and as such had to be referred to by code even within the highest circles of government. The possibility of nuclear weapons was acknowledged early in the war. At the University of Birmingham, Rudolf Peierls and Otto Frisch co-wrote a memorandum explaining that a small mass of pure uranium-235 could be used to produce a chain reaction in a bomb with the power of thousands of tons of TNT. This led to the formation of the MAUD Committee, which called for an all-out effort to develop nuclear weapons. Wallace Akers, who oversaw the project, chose the deliberately misleading code name \\"Tube Alloys\\". His Tube Alloys Directorate was part of the Department of Scientific and Industrial Research. The Tube Alloys programme in Britain and Canada was the first nuclear weapons project. Due to the high costs, and the fact that Britain was fighting a war within bombing range of its enemies, Tube Alloys was ultimately subsumed into the Manhattan Project by the Quebec Agreement with the United States, under which the two nations agreed to share nuclear weapons technology, and to refrain from using it against each other, or against other countries without mutual consent; but the United States did not provide complete details of the results of the Manhattan Project to the United Kingdom. The Soviet Union gained valuable information through its atomic spies, who had infiltrated both the British and American projects. The United States terminated co-operation after the war ended with the Atomic Energy Act of 1946. This prompted the United Kingdom to relaunch its own project, High Explosive Research. Production facilities were established and British scientists continued their work under the auspices of an independent British programme. Finally, in 1952, Britain performed a nuclear test under codename \\"Operation Hurricane\\". In 1958, in the wake of the Sputnik crisis and the British demonstration of a two-stage thermonuclear bomb, the United Kingdom and the United States signed US‚ÄìUK Mutual Defence Agreement, which resulted in a resumption of Britain's nuclear Special Relationship with the United States.  Origins  alt=Four men in suits, each sporting a medal on the left breast  Discovery of fission  The neutron was discovered by James Chadwick at the Cavendish Laboratory at the University of Cambridge in February 1932. In April 1932, his Cavendish colleagues John Cockcroft and Ernest Walton split lithium atoms with accelerated protons. Enrico Fermi and his team in Rome conducted experiments involving the bombardment of elements by slow neutrons, which produced heavier elements and isotopes. Then, in December 1938, Otto Hahn and Fritz Strassmann at Hahn's laboratory in Berlin-Dahlem bombarded uranium with slowed neutrons, and discovered that barium had been produced, and therefore that the uranium atomic nucleus had been split. Hahn wrote to his colleague Lise Meitner, who, with her nephew Otto Robert Frisch, developed a theoretical justification which they published in Nature in 1939. This phenomenon was a new type of nuclear disintegration, and was more powerful than any seen before. Frisch and Meitner calculated that the energy released by each disintegration was approximately 200,000,000 electron volts. By analogy with the division of biological cells, they named the process \\"fission\\".  Paris Group  This was followed up by a group of scientists at the Coll√®ge de France in Paris: Fr√©d√©ric Joliot-Curie, Hans von Halban, Lew Kowarski, and Francis Perrin. In February 1939, the Paris Group showed that when fission occurs in uranium, two or three extra neutrons are given off. This important observation suggested a self-sustaining nuclear chain reaction might be possible. The term \\"atomic bomb\\" was already familiar to the British public through the writings of H. G. Wells, in his 1913 novel The World Set Free. It was immediately apparent to many scientists that, in theory at least, an extremely powerful explosive could be created, although most still considered an atomic bomb was an impossibility. Perrin defined a critical mass of uranium to be the smallest amount that could sustain a chain reaction. The neutrons used to cause fission in uranium are considered slow neutrons, but when neutrons are released during a fission reaction they are released as fast neutrons which have much more speed and energy. Thus, in order to create a sustained chain reaction, there existed a need for a neutron moderator to contain and slow the fast neutrons until they reached a usable energy level. The Coll√®ge de France found that both water and graphite could be used as acceptable moderators. Early in 1940, the Paris Group decided on theoretical grounds that heavy water would be an ideal moderator for how they intended to use it. They asked the French Minister of Armaments to obtain as much heavy water as possible from the only source, the large Norsk Hydro hydroelectric station at Vemork in Norway. The French then discovered Germany had already offered to purchase the entire stock of Norwegian heavy water, indicating that Germany might also be researching an atomic bomb. The French told the Norwegian government of the possible military significance of heavy water. Norway gave the entire stock of to a Deuxi√®me Bureau agent, who secretly brought it to France just before Germany invaded Norway in April 1940. On 19 June 1940, following the German invasion of France, it was shipped to England by the Earl of Suffolk and Major Ardale Golding, aboard the steamer . The heavy water, valued at ¬£22,000, was initially kept at HM Prison Wormwood Scrubs, and was later secretly stored in the library at Windsor Castle. The Paris Group moved to Cambridge, with the exception of Joliot-Curie, who remained in France and became active in the French Resistance.  Frisch‚ÄìPeierls memorandum  In Britain, a number of scientists considered whether an atomic bomb was practical. At the University of Liverpool, Chadwick and the Polish refugee scientist Joseph Rotblat tackled the problem, but their calculations were inconclusive. At Cambridge, Nobel Prize in Physics laureates George Paget Thomson and William Lawrence Bragg wanted the government to take urgent action to acquire uranium ore. The main source of this was the Belgian Congo, and they were worried that it could fall into German hands. Unsure as to how to go about this, they spoke to Sir William Spens, the master of Corpus Christi College, Cambridge. In April 1939, he approached Sir Kenneth Pickthorn, the local Member of Parliament, who took their concerns to the Secretary of the Committee for Imperial Defence, Major General Hastings Ismay. Ismay in turn asked Sir Henry Tizard for an opinion. Like many scientists, Tizard was sceptical of the likelihood of an atomic bomb being developed, reckoning the odds of success at 100,000 to 1. Even at such long odds, the danger was sufficiently great to be taken seriously. Lord Chartfield, Minister for Coordination of Defence, checked with the Treasury and Foreign Office, and found that the Belgian Congo uranium was owned by the Union Mini√®re du Haut Katanga company, whose British vice president, Lord Stonehaven, arranged a meeting with the president of the company, Edgar Sengier. Since Union Mini√®re management were friendly towards Britain, it was not considered worthwhile to acquire the uranium immediately, but Tizard's Committee on the Scientific Survey of Air Defence was directed to continue the research into the feasibility of atomic bombs. Thomson, at Imperial College London, and Mark Oliphant, an Australian physicist at the University of Birmingham, were each tasked with carrying out a series of experiments on uranium. By February 1940, Thomson's team had failed to create a chain reaction in natural uranium, and he had decided it was not worth pursuing. alt=A red brick building At Birmingham, Oliphant's team had reached a different conclusion. Oliphant had delegated the task to two German refugee scientists, Rudolf Peierls and Otto Frisch, who could not work on Oliphant's radar project because they were enemy aliens and therefore lacked the necessary security clearance. Francis Perrin had calculated the critical mass of uranium to be about . He reckoned that if a neutron reflector were placed around it, this might be reduced to . Peierls attempted to simplify the problem by using the fast neutrons produced by fission, thus omitting consideration of moderator. He too calculated the critical mass of a sphere of uranium in a theoretical paper written in 1939 to be \\"of the order of tons\\". Peierls knew the importance of the size of the critical mass that would allow a chain reaction to take place and its practical significance. In the interior of a critical mass sphere, neutrons are spontaneously produced by the fissionable material. A very small portion of these neutrons are colliding with other nuclei, while a larger portion of the neutrons are escaping through the surface of the sphere. Peierls calculated the equilibrium of the system, where the number of neutrons being produced equalled the number escaping. Niels Bohr had theorised that the rare uranium-235 isotope, which makes up only about 0.7% of natural uranium, was primarily responsible for fission with fast neutrons, although this was not yet universally accepted. Frisch and Peierls were thus able to revise their initial estimate of critical mass needed for nuclear fission in uranium to be substantially less than previously assumed. They estimated a metallic sphere of uranium-235 with a radius of could suffice. This amount represented approximately of uranium-235. These results led to the Frisch‚ÄìPeierls memorandum, which was the initial step in the development of the nuclear arms programme in Britain. This marked the beginning of an aggressive approach towards uranium enrichment and the development of an atomic bomb. They now began to investigate processes by which they could successfully separate the uranium isotope. Oliphant took their findings to Tizard in his capacity as the chairman of the Committee for the Scientific Survey of Air Warfare (CSSAW). He in turn passed them to Thomson, to whom the CSSAW had delegated responsibility for uranium research. After discussions between Cockcroft, Oliphant and Thomson, CSSAW created the MAUD Committee to investigate further.  MAUD Committee  The MAUD Committee was founded in June 1940. The committee was originally a part of the Committee for the Scientific Survey of Air Defence, but later gained independence with the Ministry of Aircraft Production. The committee was initially named after its chairman, Thomson, but quickly exchanged this for a more unassuming name, the MAUD Committee. The name MAUD came to be in an unusual way. Shortly after Germany invaded Denmark, Bohr had sent a telegram to Frisch. The telegram ended with a strange line: \\"Tell Cockcroft and Maud Ray Kent\\". At first it was thought to be code regarding radium or other vital atomic-weapons-related information, hidden in an anagram. One suggestion was to replace the y with an i, producing \\"radium taken\\". When Bohr returned to England in 1943, it was discovered that the message was addressed to Bohr's housekeeper Maud Ray and Cockcroft. Maud Ray was from Kent. Thus the committee was named The MAUD Committee, the capitalisation representing a codename and not an acronym. Meetings were normally held in the offices of the Royal Society in London. In addition to Thomson, its original members were Chadwick, Cockcroft, Oliphant and Philip Moon, Patrick Blackett, Charles Ellis and William Haworth. alt=Head and shoulders portrait Four universities provided the locations where the experiments were taking place. The laboratory at the University of Birmingham was responsible for all the theoretical work, such as what size of critical mass was needed for an explosion. It was run by Peierls, with the help of fellow German refugee scientist Klaus Fuchs. The laboratories at the University of Liverpool and the University of Oxford experimented with different types of isotope separation. Chadwick's group at Liverpool dealt with thermal diffusion, which worked based on the principle that different isotopes of uranium diffuse at different speeds because of the equipartition theorem. Franz Simon's group at Oxford investigated the gaseous diffusion of isotopes. This method works on the principle that at differing pressures uranium 235 would diffuse through a barrier faster than uranium 238. Eventually, the most promising method of separation was found to be gaseous diffusion. Egon Bretscher and Norman Feather's group at Cambridge investigated whether another element, now called plutonium, could be used as an explosive compound. Because of the French scientists, Oxford also obtained the world's only supply of heavy water, which helped them theorise how uranium could be used for power. The research from the MAUD committee was compiled in two reports, commonly known as the MAUD reports in July 1941. The first report, \\"Use of Uranium for a Bomb\\", discussed the feasibility of creating a super- bomb from uranium, which they now thought to be possible. The second, \\"Use of Uranium as a Source of Power\\" discussed the idea of using uranium as a source of power, not just a bomb. The MAUD Committee and report helped bring about the British nuclear programme, the Tube Alloys Project. Not only did it help start a nuclear project in Britain, it helped jump-start the American project. Without the help of the MAUD Committee the American programme, the Manhattan Project, would have started months behind. Instead they were able to begin thinking about how to create a bomb, not whether it was possible. Historian Margaret Gowing noted that \\"events that change a time scale by only a few months can nevertheless change history.\\" The MAUD reports were reviewed by the Defence Services Panel of the Scientific Advisory Committee. This was chaired by Lord Hankey, with its other members being Sir Edward Appleton, Sir Henry Dale, Alfred Egerton, Archibald Hill and Edward Mellanby. The panel held seven meetings in September 1941, and submitted its report to the Lord President of the Council, Sir John Anderson. At this point, it was feared that German scientists were attempting to provide their country with an atomic bomb, and thus Britain needed to finish theirs first. The report ultimately stated that if there were even a sliver of a chance that the bomb effort could produce a weapon with such power, then every effort should be made to make sure Britain did not fall behind. It recommended that while a pilot separation plant be built in Britain, the production facility should be built in Canada. The Defence Services Panel submitted its report on 24 September 1941, but by this time the final decision had already been taken. Lord Cherwell had taken the matter to the Prime Minister, Winston Churchill, who became the first national leader to approve a nuclear weapons programme on 30 August 1941. The Chiefs of Staff Committee supported the decision.  Tube Alloys organisation  A directorate of Tube Alloys was established as part of Appleton's Department of Scientific and Industrial Research, and Wallace Akers, the research director of Imperial Chemical Industries (ICI), was chosen as its head. Anderson and Akers came up with the name Tube Alloys. It was deliberately chosen to be meaningless, \\"with a specious air of probability about it\\". An advisory committee known as the Tube Alloys Consultative Council was created to oversee its work, chaired by Anderson, with its other members being Lord Hankey, Lord Cherwell, Sir Edward Appleton and Sir Henry Dale. This handled policy matters. To deal with technical issues, a Technical Committee was created with Akers as chairman, and Chadwick, Simon, Halban, Peierls, and Roland Slade from ICI as its original members, with Michael Perrin as its secretary. It was later joined by Charles Galton Darwin, Cockcroft, Oliphant and Feather.  Isotopic separation  The biggest problem faced by the MAUD Committee was to find a way to separate the 0.7% of uranium-235 from the 99.3% of uranium-238. This is difficult because the two types of uranium are chemically identical. Separation (uranium enrichment) would have to be achieved at a large scale. At Cambridge, Eric Rideal and his team investigated using a gas centrifuge. Frisch chose to perform gaseous thermal diffusion using Clusius tubes because it seemed the simplest method. Frisch's calculations showed there would need to be 100,000 Clusius tubes to extract the desired separation amount. Peierls turned to Franz Simon, who preferred to find a method more suitable for mass production. alt=Head and shoulders portrait When Moon examined the suggestion that gaseous thermal diffusion be the method of choice to the MAUD committee, there was no agreement to move forward with it. The committee consulted with Peierls and Simon over the separation method and concluded that \\"ordinary\\" gaseous diffusion was the best method to pursue. This relies on Graham's Law, the fact that the gases diffuse through porous materials at rates determined by their molecular weight. Francis William Aston applied this method in 1913 when he separated two isotopes of neon by diffusing a sample thousands of times through a pipe clay. Thick materials like pipe clay proved too slow to be efficient on an industry scale. Simon proposed using a metal foil punctured with millions of microscopic holes would allow the separation process to move faster. He estimated that a plant that separated of uranium-235 from natural uranium per day would cost about ¬£5,000,000 to build, and ¬£1,500,000 per year to run, in which time it would consume ¬£2,000,000 of uranium and other raw materials. The MAUD Committee realised an atomic bomb was not just feasible, but inevitable. In 1941, Frisch moved to London to work with Chadwick and his cyclotron. Frisch built a Clusius tube there to study the properties of uranium hexafluoride. Frisch and Chadwick discovered it is one of the gases for which the Clusius method will not work. This was only a minor setback because Simon was already in progress of establishing the alternative method of separation through ordinary gaseous diffusion. The chemical problems of producing gaseous compounds of uranium and pure uranium metal were studied at the University of Birmingham and by ICI. Michael Clapham, who at the time was working on print technology at the Kynoch Works in Aston in Birmingham, carried out early experiments with uranium production processes. Philip Baxter from ICI, where he had experience working with fluorine compounds, made the first small batch of gaseous uranium hexafluoride for Chadwick in 1940. ICI received a formal ¬£5,000 contract in December 1940 to make of this vital material for the future work. The prototype gaseous diffusion equipment itself was manufactured by Metropolitan-Vickers (MetroVick) at Trafford Park, Manchester, at a cost of ¬£150,000 for four units. They were installed at the M. S. Factory located in a valley near Rhydymwyn, in Wales; M. S. stood for the Ministry of Supply. The building used was known as P6 and test equipment was installed. These units were tested by a team of about seventy under the guidance of Peierls and Fuchs. The results of the experiments led to the building of the gaseous diffusion factory at Capenhurst, Cheshire. ICI pilot plants for producing of pure uranium metal and of uranium hexafluoride per day commenced operation in Widnes in mid-1943.  Plutonium  The breakthrough with plutonium was by Bretscher and Norman Feather at the Cavendish Laboratory. They realised that a slow neutron reactor fuelled with uranium would theoretically produce substantial amounts of plutonium-239 as a by- product. This is because uranium-238 absorbs slow neutrons and forms a short- lived new isotope, uranium-239. The new isotope's nucleus rapidly emits an electron through beta decay producing a new element with an atomic mass of 239 and an atomic number of 93. This element's nucleus also emits an electron and becomes a new element with an atomic number 94 and a much greater half-life. Bretscher and Feather showed theoretically feasible grounds that element 94 would be fissilereadily split by both slow and fast neutrons with the added advantage of being chemically different from uranium. This new development was also confirmed in independent work by Edwin M. McMillan and Philip Abelson at Berkeley Radiation Laboratory also in 1940. Nicholas Kemmer of the Cambridge team proposed the names neptunium for the new element 93 and plutonium for 94 by analogy with the outer planets Neptune and Pluto beyond Uranus (uranium being element 92). The Americans fortuitously suggested the same names. The production and identification of the first sample of plutonium in 1941 is generally credited to Glenn Seaborg, using a cyclotron rather than a reactor at the University of California. In 1941, neither team knew of the existence of the other. Chadwick voiced concerns about the need for such pure plutonium to make a feasible bomb. He also suspected the gun method of detonation for a plutonium bomb would lead to premature detonations due to impurities. After Chadwick met Robert Oppenheimer at the Los Alamos Laboratory in 1943, he learned of a proposed bomb design which they were calling an implosion. The sub-critical mass of plutonium was supposed to be surrounded by explosives arranged to detonate simultaneously. This would cause the plutonium core to be compressed and become supercritical. The core would be surrounded by a depleted uranium tamper which would reflect the neutrons back into the reaction, and contribute to the explosion by fissioning itself. This design solved Chadwick's worries about purity because it did not require the level needed for the gun-type fission weapon. The biggest problem with this method was creating the explosive lenses. Chadwick took this information with him and described the method to Oliphant who then took it with him to England.  Montreal Laboratory  alt=Large building shaped like a cube. In front is a smaller, barn-like building. They are flanked by two smokestacks. There is a river in the background. Halban's heavy water team from France continued its slow neutron research at Cambridge University; but the project was given a low priority since it was not considered relevant to bomb making. It suddenly acquired military significance when it was realised that it provided the route to plutonium. The British Government wanted the Cambridge team to be relocated to North America, in proximity to the raw materials it required, and where the American research was being done. But Sir John Anderson wanted the British team to retain its own identity, and was concerned that since the Americans were working on nuclear reactor designs using nuclear graphite instead of heavy water as a neutron moderator, that team might not receive a fair share of resources. The Americans had their own concerns, particularly about security, since only one of the six senior scientists in the group was British. They also had concerns about patent rights; that the French team would attempt to patent nuclear technology based on the pre-war work. As a compromise, Thomson suggested relocating the team to Canada. The Canadian government was approached, and Dean Mackenzie, the president of the National Research Council of Canada, immediately welcomed and supported the proposal. The costs and salaries would be divided between the British and Canadian governments, but the British share would come from a billion dollar war gift from Canada. The first eight staff arrived in Montreal at the end of 1942, and occupied a house belonging to McGill University. Three months later they moved into a area in a new building at the University of Montreal. The laboratory grew quickly to over 300 staff; about half were Canadians recruited by George Laurence. A subgroup of theoreticians was recruited and headed by a Czechoslovak physicist, George Placzek. Placzek proved to be a very capable group leader, and was generally regarded as the only member of the staff with the stature of the highest scientific rank and with close personal contacts with many key physicists involved in the Manhattan project. Friedrich Paneth became head of the chemistry division, and Pierre Auger of the experimental physics division. Von Halban was the director of the laboratory, but he proved to be an unfortunate choice as he was a poor administrator, and did not work well with the National Research Council of Canada. The Americans saw him as a security risk, and objected to the French atomic patents claimed by the Paris Group (in association with ICI).  Niels Bohr's contribution to Tube Alloys  alt=Bohr sitting at his desk Sir John Anderson was eager to invite Niels Bohr to the Tube Alloys project because he was a world-famous scientist who would not only contribute his expertise to the project, but also help the British government gain leverage in dealings with the Manhattan Project. In September 1943, word reached Bohr in Denmark that the Nazis considered his family to be Jewish, and that they were in danger of being arrested. The Danish resistance helped Bohr and his wife escape by sea to Sweden on 29 September 1943. When the news of Bohr's escape reached Britain, Lord Cherwell sent a telegram asking Bohr to come to Britain. Bohr arrived in Scotland on 6 October in a de Havilland Mosquito operated by the British Overseas Airways Corporation (BOAC). At the invitation of the director of the Manhattan Project, Brigadier General Leslie R. Groves, Jr, Bohr visited the Manhattan Project sites in November 1943. Groves offered Bohr substantial pay, but Bohr initially refused the offer because he wanted to make sure the relationship between the United States and Great Britain remained a real co-operative partnership. In December 1943, after a meeting with Albert Einstein, Bohr and his son Aage committed to working on the Manhattan Project. Bohr made a substantial contribution to the atomic bomb development effort. He also attempted to prevent a post-war atomic arms race with the Soviet Union, which he believed to be a serious threat. In 1944, Bohr presented several key points he believed to be essential concerning international nuclear weapon control. He urged that Britain and the United States should inform the Soviet Union about the Manhattan Project in order to decrease the likelihood of its feeling threatened on the premise that the other nations were building a bomb behind its back. His beliefs stemmed from his conviction that the Russians already knew about the Manhattan Project, leading him to believe there was no point in hiding it from them. Bohr's evidence came from an interpretation of a letter he received from a Soviet friend and scientist in Russia, which he showed to the British security services.Kapitza to Bohr, 28 October 1943, CAB 126/39, NA. \\"Correspondence between Kapitza and B.\\" 2 May 1945, CAB 126/39 He reasoned that the longer the United States and Britain hid their nuclear advances, the more threatened the Russians would feel and the more inclined to speed up their effort to produce an atomic bomb of their own. With the help of U.S. Supreme Court justice Felix Frankfurter, Bohr met on 26 August 1944 with the President of the United States, Franklin D. Roosevelt, who was initially sympathetic to his ideas about controlling nuclear weapons. But Churchill was adamantly opposed to informing the Soviet Union of such work. At the Second Quebec Conference in September 1944, Roosevelt sided with Churchill, deciding it would be in the nation's best interest to keep the atomic bomb project a secret. Moreover, they decided Bohr was potentially dangerous and that security measures must be taken in order to prevent him from leaking information to the rest of the world, Russia in particular.  Tube Alloys and the United States   Tizard mission  In August 1940, a British mission, led by Tizard and with members including Cockcroft, was sent to America to create relations and help advance the research towards war technology with the Americans. Several military technologies were shared, including advances in radar, anti-submarine warfare, aeronautical engineering and explosives. The American radar programme in particular was reinvigorated with an added impetus to the development of microwave radar and proximity fuzes. This prompted the Americans to create the MIT Radiation Laboratory, which would later serve as a model for the Los Alamos Laboratory. The mission did not spend much time on nuclear fission, with only two meetings of the subject, mainly about uranium enrichment. In particular, Cockcroft did not report Peierls' and Frisch's findings. Nonetheless, there were important repercussions. A barrier had been broken and a pathway to exchange technical information between the two countries was developed. Moreover, the notion of civilian scientists playing an important role in the development of military technologies was strengthened on both sides of the Atlantic.  Oliphant's visit to the United States  alt=Head and shoulders portrait The MAUD Committee reports urged the co- operation with the United States should be continued in the research of nuclear fission. Charles C. Lauritsen, a Caltech physicist working at the National Defense Research Committee (NDRC), was in London during this time and was invited to sit in on a MAUD meeting. The committee pushed for rapid development of nuclear weapons using gaseous-diffusion as their isotope separation device. Once he returned to the United States, he was able to brief Vannevar Bush, the director of the Office of Scientific Research and Development (OSRD), concerning the details discussed during the meeting. In August 1941, Mark Oliphant, the director of the physics department at the University of Birmingham and an original member of the MAUD Committee, was sent to the US to assist the NDRC on radar. During his visit he met with William D. Coolidge. Coolidge was shocked when Oliphant told him the British had predicted that only ten kilograms of uranium-235 would be sufficient to supply a chain reaction effected by fast moving neutrons. While in America, Oliphant discovered that the chairman of the OSRD S-1 Section, Lyman Briggs, had locked away the MAUD reports transferred from Britain entailing the initial discoveries and had not informed the S-1 Committee members of all its findings. Oliphant took the initiative himself to enlighten the scientific community in the U.S. of the recent groundbreaking discoveries the MAUD Committee had just exposed. Oliphant also travelled to Berkeley to meet with Ernest Lawrence, inventor of the cyclotron. After Oliphant informed Lawrence of his report on uranium, Lawrence met with NDRC chairman James Bryant Conant, George B. Pegram, and Arthur Compton to relay the details which Oliphant had directed to Lawrence. Oliphant was not only able to get in touch with Lawrence, he met with Conant and Bush to inform them of the significant data the MAUD had discovered. Oliphant's ability to inform the Americans led to Oliphant convincing Lawrence, Lawrence convincing Compton, and then Kistiakowsky convincing Conant to move forward with nuclear weapons. These actions from Oliphant resulted in Bush taking this report directly to the president.  Information sharing ceases  The American effort increased rapidly and soon outstripped the British as the American authorities were reluctant to share details with their British counterparts. However, separate research continued in each country with some exchange of information. Several of the key British scientists visited the United States early in 1942 and were given full access to all of the information available. They were astounded at the momentum the American atomic bomb project had then assumed. The British and American exchange of information and efforts continued but the nations did not combine their efforts, leading their programmes separately. Furthermore, in 1941 the British Government rebuffed and vetoed attempts and proposals by Bush and Conant to strengthen cooperation between Great Britain and America. In June 1942, the United States Army Corps of Engineers took over the Manhattan Project from OSRD, and Groves became the project's director. He tightened security, which dried up the flow of information to Britain. American officials were particularly concerned that Akers and other people from ICI involved in the Tube Alloys project were trying to exploit American nuclear scientific knowledge to create a profitable post-war industry. In October 1942, Bush and Conant convinced Roosevelt the United States should independently develop the atomic bomb project, despite an agreement of unrestricted scientific interchange between the US and Britain. This disastrously affected British efforts as they lacked manpower, facilities, equipment and materials. Tube Alloys, therefore, fell behind in the race with the Manhattan Project. On 30 July 1942, Anderson advised Churchill: \\"We must face the fact that... [our] pioneering work... is a dwindling asset and that, unless we capitalise it quickly, we shall be outstripped. We now have a real contribution to make to a 'merger'. Soon we shall have little or none.\\" By the time Great Britain realised it, the position had worsened; Bush decided outside help for the Manhattan Project was no longer needed. The Military Policy Committee (MPC) supported Bush's arguments and restricted access to the classified information which Britain could utilise to develop its atomic weapons programme, even if it slowed down the American efforts. The Americans stopped sharing any information on heavy water production, the method of electromagnetic separation, the physical or chemical properties of plutonium, the details of bomb design, or the facts about fast neutron reactions. This was a major disappointment that hindered the British and the Canadians, who were collaborating on heavy water production and several other aspects of the research programme. By 1943 Britain had stopped sending its scientists to the United States, which slowed down the pace of work there, which had relied on efforts led by British scientists. In March 1943 Conant approached the Military Policy Committee, which decided that Britain's help would benefit some areas of the project. Chadwick, Penney, Peierls, Oliphant and other British scientists were important enough that the bomb design team at the Los Alamos Laboratory needed them, despite the risk of revealing weapon design secrets.  Quebec Agreement  alt=The three leaders sit on chairs on a wooden deck. Their national flags fly in the background. Churchill sought information about building Britain's own gaseous diffusion plant, a heavy water plant and an atomic reactor in Britain, despite its immense cost. A gaseous diffusion plant to produce a kilogram of weapons-grade uranium per day was estimated to cost up to ¬£3million in research and development, and anything up to ¬£50million to build in wartime Britain. A nuclear reactor to produce that much plutonium per day would have to be built in Canada. It would take up to five years to build and cost ¬£5million. The project would also require facilities for producing the required heavy water (between ¬£5million and ¬£10million) and uranium metal (¬£1.5million). The project would need overwhelming priority, as it was estimated to require twenty thousand workersmany of them highly skilledhalf a million tons of steel, and an unprecedented half gigawatt of electricity. Disruption to other wartime projects would be inevitable, and it was unlikely to be ready in time to affect the outcome of the war in Europe. The unanimous response was that first another effort should be made to secure American co-operation. In July 1943, in London, American officials cleared up some major misunderstandings about British motives, and after many months of negotiations the Quebec Agreement was signed by Churchill and Roosevelt on 19 August 1943 during the Quebec Conference. The British handed over their material to the Americans and in return received the copies of the American progress reports to the President. Tube Alloys was subsumed into the Manhattan Project. In a section of the Quebec Agreement formally entitled \\"Articles of Agreement governing collaboration between the authorities of the USA and UK in the matter of Tube Alloys\\", Britain and the USA agreed to share resources \\"to bring the Tube Alloys project to fruition at the earliest moment\\". The leaders further agreed that: * \\"First, we will never use this agency against each other, * \\"Secondly, we will not use it against third parties without each other's consent, and * \\"Thirdly, we will not either of us communicate any information about Tube Alloys to third parties except by mutual consent.\\" It was also agreed that \\"any post-war advantages of an industrial or commercial nature\\" would be decided at the discretion of the President. The Quebec Agreement established the Combined Policy Committee to control the Manhattan Project, consisting of Henry Stimson, Bush and Conant from the United States; Field Marshal Sir John Dill and Colonel J. J. Llewellin were the British members, and C. D. Howe was the Canadian member. Llewellin returned to the United Kingdom at the end of 1943 and was replaced on the committee by Sir Ronald Ian Campbell, who in turn was replaced by the British Ambassador to the United States, Lord Halifax, in early 1945. Dill died in Washington, D.C., in November 1944 and was replaced both as Chief of the British Joint Staff Mission and as a member of the Combined Policy Committee by Field Marshal Sir Henry Maitland Wilson. The subsequent Hyde Park Agreement on 19 September 1944 extended this cooperation to the post-war period.  British contribution to the Manhattan Project  Akers summoned Chadwick, Oliphant, Simon and Peierls to the United States. They arrived the day the Quebec Agreement was signed, ready to assist the Manhattan Project in any way possible. Akers was generally disliked and the Americans refused to move forward with collaboration unless a top British scientist who was \\"accepted and sound of judgement\\" was appointed instead. British officials dug in over Britain's right to make its own appointments to its own government agencies. A compromise was reached, with Chadwick put in charge as Britain's technical advisor for the Combined Policy Committee, and as the head of the British Mission to the Manhattan Project. alt=Groves sits a completely clean desk. Chadwick, seated next to him, looks on. With this dispute settled collaboration could once again take place. Chadwick wanted to involve as many British scientists as possible so long as Groves accepted them. Chadwick's first choice, Joseph Rotblat refused to give up his Polish citizenship. Chadwick then turned to Otto Frisch, who to Chadwick's surprise accepted becoming a British citizen right away and began the screening process so he could travel to America. Chadwick spent the first few weeks of November 1943 acquiring a clear picture of the extensive Manhattan Project. He realised the scale of such sites as Oak Ridge, Tennessee, which was the new headquarters of the project, and could safely conclude that without similar industrial site being found in Germany the chances of the Nazi atomic bomb project being successful was very low. With Chadwick involved the main goal was to show that the Quebec Agreement was a success. It was Britain's duty to co-operate to the fullest and speed along the process. Chadwick used this opportunity to give as many young British scientists experience as possible so they might carry that experience to post-war Britain. He eventually convinced Groves of Rotblat's integrity to the cause, and this led to Rotblat being accepted to the Manhattan Project without renouncing his nationality. Rotblat had been left in charge of the Tube Alloys research, and brought with him the results obtained since Chadwick had left. The Montreal team in Canada depended on the Americans for heavy water from the US heavy water plant in Trail, British Columbia, which was under American contract, and for technical information about plutonium. The Americans said they would supply heavy water to the Montreal group only if it agreed to direct its research along the limited lines suggested by DuPont, its main contractor for reactor construction. Despite doing much good work, by June 1943 the Montreal Laboratory had come to a complete standstill. Morale was low and the Canadian Government proposed cancelling the project. In April 1944, a Combined Policy Committee meeting in Washington agreed Canada would build a heavy water reactor. The Americans agreed to support the project with information and visits, and to supply materials, including vital uranium and heavy water. The Montreal Laboratory would be given access to data from the Metallurgical Laboratory's research reactors at Argonne and the X-10 Graphite Reactor at Oak Ridge, but not from the production reactors at the Hanford Site; nor was it to be given any information about the chemistry of plutonium, or methods for separating it from other elements. This arrangement was formally approved by the Combined Policy Committee meeting on 19 September 1944. John Cockcroft became the director of the Montreal Laboratory. The Chalk River Laboratories opened in 1944, and in 1946 the Montreal Laboratory was closed. The project developed the ZEEP reactor, which went critical in September 1945. William Penney, one of the Tube Alloys scientists, was an expert in shock waves. In June 1944, he went to America to work at the Los Alamos Laboratory as part of the British delegation. He worked on the means to assess the effects of a nuclear explosion, and wrote a paper on what height the bombs should be detonated at for maximum effect in attacks on Germany and Japan. He served as a member of the target committee established by Groves to select Japanese cities for atomic bombing, and on Tinian with Project Alberta as a special consultant. Along with Group Captain Leonard Cheshire, sent as a British representative, he watched the bombing of Nagasaki from the observation plane Big Stink. He also formed part of the Manhattan Project's post-war scientific mission to Hiroshima and Nagasaki that assessed the extent of the damage caused by the bombs. The Smyth Report was issued by the US War Department on 12 August 1945, giving the story of the atomic bomb and including the technical details that could now be made public. It made few references to the British contribution to the bomb, and a White Paper, Statements Relating to the Atomic Bomb, was hurriedly drafted by Michael Perrin. This account was issued just after Attlee had replaced Churchill as Prime Minister, and was the only official statement on the British contribution for fifteen years.  Soviet spies in the Tube Alloys project  The Soviet Union received details of British research from its atomic spies Klaus Fuchs, Engelbert Broda, Melita Norwood and John Cairncross, a member of the notorious Cambridge Five. Alan Nunn May was recruited later in Canada. Lavrenty Beria's report to Stalin of March 1942 included the MAUD reports and other British documents passed by Cairncross. Fuchs began disclosing information to the Soviet Union about the possible production of a British atomic bomb when he joined the Tube Alloys project, although his contribution towards Soviet espionage was more severe during the Manhattan Project. Fuchs was able to contact a London-based KPD leader, J√ºrgen Kuczynski, Kuczynski put him in contact with Simon Davidovitch Kremer, the secretary to the military attach√© at the Soviet Union's embassy, who worked for the GRU (Russian: –ì–ª–∞–≤–Ω–æ–µ –†–∞–∑–≤–µ–¥—ã–≤–∞—Ç–µ–ª—å–Ω–æ–µ –£–ø—Ä–∞–≤–ª–µ–Ω–∏–µ), the Red Army's foreign military intelligence directorate. After three meetings, Fuchs was teamed up with a courier so he would not have to find excuses to travel to London. She was Ruth Kuczynski, the sister of Jurgen Kuczynski. She was also a German communist, a major in Soviet Military Intelligence and an experienced agent who had worked with Richard Sorge's spy ring in the Far East.  Post- war  President alt=Truman shaking hands with Attlee. A large crowd surrounds them. There is a large propeller-driven airplane in the background. With the end of the war the Special Relationship between Britain and the United States \\"became very much less special\\". Roosevelt died on 12 April 1945, and the Hyde Park Agreement was not binding on subsequent administrations. In fact, it was physically lost: when Wilson raised the matter in a Combined Policy Committee meeting in June, the American copy could not be found. The British sent Stimson a photocopy on 18 July 1945. Even then, Groves questioned the document's authenticity until the American copy was located years later in the papers of Vice Admiral Wilson Brown, Jr., Roosevelt's naval aide, apparently misfiled by someone unaware of what Tube Alloys was‚Äîwho thought it had something to do with naval guns. The British government had trusted that America would share nuclear technology, which the British saw as a joint discovery. On 9 November 1945, Mackenzie King and the Prime Minister, Clement Attlee, went to Washington, D.C., to confer with President Harry Truman about future cooperation in nuclear weapons and nuclear power. The three leaders agreed there would be full and effective cooperation on atomic energy, but British hopes for a full resumption of cooperation on nuclear weapons were disappointed. The Americans soon made it clear that this was restricted to basic scientific research. The passage of the Atomic Energy Act of 1946 (McMahon Act) in August 1946 made it clear that the UK would no longer be allowed access to the United States' atomic research. This partly resulted from the arrest for espionage of Alan Nunn May in February 1946. On 8 January 1947, Attlee formed a secret Gen 163 Cabinet committee, consisting of six cabinet ministers, which decided that Britain required the atomic bomb to maintain its position in world politics. In the words of the Foreign Secretary Ernest Bevin, \\"That won't do at all... we've got to have this... I don't mind for myself, but I don't want any other Foreign Secretary of this country to be talked to or at by a Secretary of State in the United States as I have just had in my discussions with Mr Byrnes. We've got to have this thing over here whatever it costs... We've got to have the bloody Union Jack on top of it.\\" Marshal of the Royal Air Force Lord Portal, was appointed to lead the effort, code-named High Explosive Research. The Atomic Energy Research Establishment (AERE) near Harwell, Oxfordshire, was created by Cockcroft in 1946 as the main centre for military and civilian atomic energy research and development. Penney led the bomb design effort as Chief Superintendent Armament Research (CSAR, pronounced \\"Caesar\\"), in charge of the Ministry Of Supply's Armaments Research Department (ARD) at Fort Halstead in Kent and the Royal Arsenal at Woolwich. In April 1950 an abandoned Second World War airfield, RAF Aldermaston in Berkshire, was selected as the permanent home for what became the Atomic Weapons Research Establishment (AWRE). Penney assembled a team to initiate the work, firstly preparing a report describing the features, science and idea behind the American Fat Man implosion-type nuclear weapon. He broke down the development tasks required to replicate it, identifying outstanding questions that required further research on nuclear weapons. On 3 October 1952, under the code-name \\"Operation Hurricane\\", the first British nuclear device was successfully detonated in the Monte Bello Islands off the west coast of Australia. The Sputnik crisis and the development of the British hydrogen bomb led to the Atomic Energy Act being amended in 1958, and to a resumption of the nuclear Special Relationship between America and Britain under the 1958 US‚ÄìUK Mutual Defence Agreement.

Established by the 1864 Constitution, the Order of Kamehameha I is the second order of its kind in Hawaii. Grades Appointing a member of the Order was determined by the number of living members in each particular grade. At any given time there could only be: * 60px Knight Grand Cross with Collar (CGCOK) - limited to heads of state * 60px Knight Grand Cross (KGCOK) - 10 individuals * 60px Knights Commander (KCOK) - 30 individuals * 60px Knights Companion (KOK) - 50 individuals History After Lot KapuƒÅiwa took the throne as King Kamehameha V, he established, by special decree, created by the privy council using Article 35 of the Constitution the Order of Kamehameha I on April 11, 1865, named to honor his grandfather Kamehameha I. Kamehameha I was the founder of the Kingdom of Hawaii and the House of Kamehameha. Both native Hawaiians and foreigners could be appointed to the Order, in each instance for distinguished service to the king and the people of Hawaii. Upon its inception, it became the first order of the Kingdom of Hawaii actually awarded (the Royal Order of the Cross and Crown was established by King Kamehameha III in 1848 but not awarded until much later). Through the decree of Kamehameha V, the Royal Order of Kamehameha was perpetually created. Its purpose to promote and defend the sovereignty of the Kingdom of Hawaii. It is chartered in the Kingdom of Hawaii by the decree of 1865. Although called \\"The Royal Order of Kamehameha I\\" today by the Public, its is known as the \\"Order of Kamehameha I\\" by its members, in private. The Order was awarded 57 times by King Kamehameha V, and 82 times by King KalƒÅkaua. Number of awards in the history of the Order: * Knights Grand Cross - 40 recipients11 Hawaiian subjects, 29 foreigners. * Knight Commander - 56 recipients * Knight Companion - 43 recipients Recipients of the Order who resided in the Hawaiian Islands received a yearly salary depending upon their grade: a Knight Grand Cross was entitled to an annual stipend of $250; a Knight Commander, to $150; and a Knight, to $75. The former Royal House of Keoua maintains a family order also named the Royal Order of Kamehameha I. Grand Council The Grand Council of Order, comprising the members of the Order resident in the Hawaiian islands, convened each year. Members absent from the annual meeting without a written message for a valid reason were penalized $20. Among Royal Hawaiian Orders, only this and the Royal Order of KalƒÅkaua I gathered at regular intervals. Insignia of the Order The jewel or badge of the Order is a Maltese cross in gold or silver with white enamel, surmounted by the Hawaiian crown. Rays of gold or silver are placed between the arms of the cross. A white-enamelled disc imposed upon the cross bears an elaborate golden \\"K\\" at its center; the blue-enamelled band surrounding the disc is inscribed \\"KAMEHAMEHA I\\" in golden letters, together with two golden laurel branches. A comparable disc on the reverse of the badge is inscribed \\"E HOOKANAKA\\" (\\"Order of Fraternity\\", in Hawaiian). * Knight Grand Cross with Collar: Members of this grade wore the badge of the Order dependent from a golden collar, the decorative links of which alternated the monogram \\"K\\" (surrounded by a green-enamelled laurel crown) with the royal crown and a small enamelled badge of the Order. The breast star was identical to that worn by Knights Grands Cross. * Knight Grand Cross: Knights Grand Cross wore the badge of the Order dependent from a broad red sash, which was edged by a narrow white stripe on each side; the sash was worn over the bearer's right shoulder, its bow (from which the badge, sometimes decorated with brilliants, depended) resting on his left hip. The breast star was an octagonal silver star bearing the uncrowned badge of Order in gold and enamels. * Knight Commander: Knights Commander wore the badge of the Order dependent from a red neck ribbon, which was edged in white and bore three white stripes. * Knight: Knights of the Order wore the badge on the left breast, suspended from a ribbon of red and white stripes.

Today The purpose of the Royal Order of Kamehameha I, as it is known today, is to unite men of Hawaiian descent in fraternal and benevolent work, good moral character, and sound bodily health; to cultivate the cardinal principles of friendship, charity and benevolence; to aid widows and orphans; to improve the social and moral conditions of its members; to provide scholarship assistance; to preserve and perpetuate the ancient culture, customs, and traditions of ancient Hawai, uplift the Hawaiian people; infuse the spirit of patriotism, loyalty, helpfulness and kindness among its members; advance the interest of its members in every rightful cause, and to encourage and develop leadership. Today the order has nine Chapters: *Moku O Hawaii (Central Oahu) *Moku O M√£malahoa (Hilo, Hawaii) *Moku O Kaumualii (Kauai) *Moku O Kahekili (Maui) *Moku O Kalaniana‚Äôole (Molokai)(Inactive) *Moku O Kuhio (Windward Oahu) *Moku O Kona (Kona, Hawaii) *Moku O Kapuaiwa (Leeward Oahu) *Moku O Kohala (Kohala, Hawai'i) *Moku O Puna (Puna, Hawai'i) The last remaining original meeting hall of the order, located at 1162 Kalanianaole Avenue in the Keaukaha community of Hilo, Hawaii, was added to the National Register of Historic Places on May 20, 1993. The Royal Order of Kamehameha I continues its work in observance and preservation of some native Hawaiian rituals and customs established by the leaders of the Kingdom of Hawaii. It is often consulted by the U.S. Government, State of Hawaii and the various county governments of Hawaii in native Hawaiian-sensitive rites performed at state functions.

It belongs to the New World warbler family (Parulidae). Description Upperside coloration In summer, male yellow-throated warblers display grey upperparts and wings, with double white wing bars. Their throats are yellow, and the remainder of their underparts are white, and are streaked with black on the flanks. Their heads are strongly patterned in black and white, with a long supercilium; the different subspecies may display yellow and white superciliums. Remiges and rectrices are black. They measure long. Other plumages of these birds ‚Äì females immatures and non-breeding males ‚Äì resemble washed-out versions of the summer males; in particular they have a less crisply defined strong head pattern. They also have less bright yellows, and dark grey feathers instead of black ones in the body plumage. Compared to many other New World warblers, sexual dimorphism is slight however. The males' songs are clear, descending whistles. The calls are high sees or sharp chips. Measurements: * Length: 5.1-5.5 in (13-14 cm) * Weight: 0.3-0.4 oz (9-11 g) * Wingspan: 8.3 in (21 cm) Ecology Wintering on Cuba These birds breed in southeastern North America, and their breeding ranges extend from southern Pennsylvania and northern Missouri, to the Gulf of Mexico. One subspecies, from northwest Florida, is resident all year round. The other populations of this species are migratory, wintering at the Gulf Coast, eastern Central America, and the Caribbean. Vagrant wintering birds are sometimes seen in northernmost South America. The yellow-throated warbler is a woodland species with a preference for coniferous or swamp tree species, in which it preferably nests. They are insectivorous, but will include a considerable amount of berries and nectar in their diet outside the breeding season. Food is typically picked off tree branches directly, but flying insects may be caught in a brief hover. These birds build cup-shaped nests which are built in trees, and are concealed amongst conifer needles or Spanish Moss (Tillandsia usneoides). Their clutches consist of 3‚Äì5 (usually 4) eggs. The yellow-throated warbler is not considered a threatened species by the IUCN.

They would have eleven children: James (1771), William (1774), Elizabeth (1776), John (1780), Ann (1782), Hugh (1784), Hamilton (1786), Thomas (1788), Margaret (1790) and Allen (1793). Elizabeth would marry James Stewart who became a U.S. Congressman. Most of their children would extend the frontier even further, moving to western Virginia and Tennessee. Public career  The farm prospered as the family grew and John become prominent in his community. He joined the Masons and became a captain of the local militia. In 1777 when Wilkes County was organized, the first meeting of the Court of the new county was held in his home, and he was appointed Justice of the Peace. Throughout the remainder of his life he held a number of county offices, such as recorder. He was a captain in the Wilkes County Regiment under Colonel Benjamin Cleveland from 1780 to 1781. In 1780, he marched his militia company south with Colonel Cleveland's force. Meeting other patriot forces at the Catawba River, they finally caught up with the British expeditionary force at King's mountain, on the South Carolina border. They were part of the overwhelming victory in the Battle of King's Mountain on October 7, 1780. The company returned with glory. Brown was later promoted to Colonel. As North Carolina struggled to resolve the debts raised during the revolution, Brown was named as state treasurer for his district in 1782. He served until the districts were consolidated in 1784. That same year he was elected to North Carolina's House of Commons, or the lower branch of the legislature. He was re-elected and served until 1787. In 1788 he was a delegate to the state convention in Hillsborough that ratified the United States Constitution in 1789 after its rejection in 1788. He died in 1812, at home on his farm in Wilkes County about 4 miles west of Wilkesboro.

In 1959, he graduated magna cum laude from Yale University where he was a member of Phi Beta Kappa. Celeste then received a Rhodes Scholarship to attend Exeter College at Oxford University, where he is an Honorary Fellow. www.exeter.ox.ac.uk, Retrieved 1 September 2013 There he met Dagmar Ingrid Braun, whom he married in Austria in 1962. After returning to the United States, Celeste served as staff liaison office in the Peace Corps and as special assistant to Chester Bowles. Celeste was elected to the Ohio House of Representatives from Cuyahoga County in 1970. His Ohio House District included western Cleveland and Lakewood, where his father Frank, had once served as mayor. He was subsequently elected the 55th Lieutenant Governor in 1974 (defeating Republican John W. Brown, serving under the Republican James A. Rhodes‚Äîat the time, Ohio's lieutenant governor was elected separately from the governor, so the victors could be of different parties). In 1978, Celeste ran for governor, but lost to incumbent Rhodes. President Carter appointed Celeste Director of the Peace Corps from 1979 to 1981, where he was responsible for programs in 53 countries. Governor of Ohio In 1982, Celeste defeated Attorney General William J. Brown and former Cincinnati Mayor Jerry Springer in the primary, and then the Republican candidate Clarence J. \\"Bud\\" Brown Jr., to become governor of Ohio. In 1986, Celeste was re-elected, defeating the Republican candidate, former governor James Rhodes who had served four prior terms (1962‚Äì70 and 1974‚Äì82). Thus Celeste served as governor of Ohio from 1983 to 1991. In 1988 he served as the Chairman of the Midwestern Governors Association. As governor, Celeste increased support for human services, mental health & addiction recovery services, funding for education and children services including providing onsite daycare for state employees. Before the Celeste era, Ohio ranked near the bottom among states in funding for these programs. Celeste and the Democratic-controlled legislature increased the state income tax by approximately 40% while also retaining a temporary tax of 50% instituted by the Republican predecessors. Celeste is noted for opening many government positions to African Americans and women‚Äîhe hired more women to cabinet positions than all previous governors combined. Celeste also allowed state employee unions to negotiate wages and benefits, rather than just working conditions. At the end of his last term he commuted several Ohio prisoners death sentences to life terms. Among them was Debra Brown's along with the sentences of most alleged battered women serving sentences at Marysville state prison for murdering their alleged aggressors. He also commuted Donald Lee Maurer to life in prison. Maurer had been convicted of raping and killing his 8 year old Massillon neighbor Dawn Marie Hendershot in the early 1980s. He opposed nuclear power in Ohio over evacuation plans. Under the Celestes, the Governor's art exhibits, chamber music concerts and First Lady's spiritual retreats and theology gatherings as well as Christmas and Hanukkah parties for neighborhood kids became regular seasonal events. The Residence Gardens, especially the rose garden, one of the oldest in the nation, were reconstituted and The Friends of the Residence were formed, with Les Wexner as their first president, to help raise private funds to defray the cost of those improvements.

The website was community-driven, with readers moderating discussions, submitting stories, and participating in their selection. The site Plastic was launched in January 2001 by Automatic Media, a conglomerate that included the pioneering webzines Feed and Suck.com. In keeping with Automatic's model of small, low-cost websites, Plastic launched with a staff of only four, amongst them Suck co-founder Joey Anuff as editor-in-chief. When Automatic Media folded in June of that year, several of the editors stayed on, working for free. On November 2, 2001, the site was sold for $30,000 to Suck co-founder Carl Steadman, who became its sole owner. Steadman took the site offline for two weeks and relaunched it on December 16, 2001, after falling out with Anuff, who no longer contributed to Plastic after the relaunch. Plastic did not feature any advertising, and was supported entirely by user donations. The site used a modified version of Slash, the content management system developed and distributed by Slashdot, and it was almost entirely member-driven. As of November 11, 2008, there were 50,218 accounts, with several thousand being active members. For a while, Plastic offered email accounts. Plastic closed permanently in February 2011, about a month after its ten-year anniversary. Content The site's topics included \\"etcetera\\", \\"filmtv\\", \\"media\\", \\"music\\", \\"politics\\", \\"scitech\\", and \\"work\\". Topics covered on the board were primarily related to current events. Plastic's content was entirely driven by user-submitted stories. A typical Plastic story selected a topic based around a story found on an external link, with the Plastic user providing a larger context for that article with supporting links and some editorial comment. The stories were often written in a way that frames a discussion for the other readers to post comments within. Readers are invited to post their comments in the stories, which can be moderated by other users. New submissions will appear in the Submissions Queue (subQ), which is visible to all users, and can be voted on by users with 50 \\"karma\\" or higher. Each voter can give the sub 0, .5, or 1 points, and high- ranking subs will eventually become full-fledged stories that can be commented upon. In addition to voting on the submissions, users are given a 255 character text field to suggest changes to the story, post helpful links to exterior sites or previous Plastic stories, or suggest alternate headlines for the story itself. One of Plastic's volunteer editors will then properly format the story for running on \\"the front page\\". Karma and moderation Plastic's moderation system was modeled on the one established by Slashdot, and very similar to it. Commenting plastic members were randomly awarded moderation points which could be given out as they saw fit. In any discussion thread, a person with moderation points was able to moderate a post up or down, based on the content, with a descriptive tag, such as 'compelling', 'scholarly', 'astute', 'disingenuous', 'obnoxious', etc. It cost one point to moderate a post up, and two to mod a post down. A given comment could have a score between ‚Äì1 and 5 inclusive at half point intervals, and Plastic users were able to set a personal threshold where no comments with a lesser score were displayed. (For example, a person with a score threshold of 1 would not see comments with a score of ‚Äì1 or 0 but would see all others.) Non-registered users were allowed to post anonymously. Plastic members had the option to block anonymous postings. Additionally, anonymous posts started with a karma score of 0, below the default moderation threshold of 1. Registered Plastic members also had the option to post anonymously, which allowed them to make controversial or offensive comments without fear of losing karma. This practice was generally frowned upon. *0 karma or higher was required to post comments in stories and submit stories to the subQ *5 karma or higher was required to post QuickLinks *50 karma or higher was required to vote in the subQ *The members with the highest karma had access to other tools, including the list of all other users in the \\"Top Karma\\" group and a list of all members currently logged in. The \\"Top Karma\\" page stated that this list was limited to the top 250 members, \\"give or take,\\" but in reality the list contained 566 members as of 12 August 2005. The minimum karma required to be on this list was 120.5. At 120.5, members were able to see the list of all members currently logged in, and at 121, members had access to the \\"Top Karma\\" list. Previously the list showed the karma totals for all members on the list, but at some point this was changed so that karma details are accessible only in \\"bands\\"‚Äîhigher-karma members can see details of all lower scoring members' karma scores, but lower-scoring members were able to see higher rankings only in bands such as +1500, +2500, +5000, etc. As with the story submission queue, some Plastic members complained that many comments were moderated (especially down) based on political motivations, usually to aid liberal posts or downgrade conservative posts. As with most member-moderated sites, many downmods were motivated by personal feuds. The moderation system did not encourage these practices, and the top karma bands typically included several self-described conservative members. QuickLinks A member with at least 5 karma points can also post QuickLinks (a \\"QL\\"), which appear on the sidebar. No designated place exists on the site for discussion of these links, but users frequently respond directly to the poster of the QL through private messages. As with comments, Quicklinks can be modded up or down, although the system is different‚Äîany registered user with a minimum karma score of 1 can vote a Quicklink up or down. If a link receives at least six more up votes than down votes, the submitter will automatically receive 1.5 karma. If a link is modded down with six more down votes than up votes, the submitter will be docked 1.5 karma and the QL will disappear from the site (but still be available in the archive). QuickLinks are appropriate for breaking news, follow-ups to previously discussed items or humorous stories with little discussion potential. Plastic Chat Plastic used to have an online chat server at irc://chat.plastic.com, port 6667. It also was previously available through a modified CGI:IRC client at https://web.archive.org/web/20050406191329/http://chat.plastic.com/. The chat server has been inexplicably down for an extended period of time.

Redford plays the title role, a talented trainer with a remarkable gift for understanding horses, who is hired to help an injured teenager (played by Scarlett Johansson) and her horse back to health following a tragic accident. Plot Teenager Grace MacLean (Scarlett Johansson) and her best friend Judith (Kate Bosworth) go out early one winter's morning to ride their horses, Pilgrim and Gulliver. As they ride up an icy slope, Gulliver slips and hits Pilgrim. Both horses fall, dragging the girls onto a road and being hit by a tractor-trailer truck. Judith and Gulliver are killed, while Grace and Pilgrim are both severely injured. Grace, left with a partially amputated right leg, is bitter and withdrawn after the accident. Meanwhile, Pilgrim is traumatized and uncontrollable to the extent that it is suggested he be put down. Grace's mother, Annie (Kristin Scott Thomas), a strong-minded and workaholic magazine editor, refuses to allow Pilgrim to be put down, sensing that somehow Grace's recovery is linked with Pilgrim's. Desperate for a way to heal both Grace and Pilgrim, Annie tracks down a \\"horse whisperer\\", Tom Booker (Robert Redford), in the remote Montana mountains. Tom agrees to help, but only if Grace also takes part in the process. Grace reluctantly agrees, and she and Annie go to stay at the Booker ranch where Tom lives with his brother and his brother's family. As Pilgrim and Grace slowly overcome their trauma, Annie and Tom begin to develop a mutual attraction. However, they are both reluctant to act on these feelings ‚Äì Annie is married and Tom had his heart broken before, when his wife left him because she belonged to the city, not the ranch. Tom also asks Grace to tell him about what happened with her and Pilgrim in order to find out what Pilgrim is thinking. At first, Grace is reluctant, but eventually gathers up her courage, and tearfully tells him about the accident. The status quo between Annie and Tom is broken when Robert MacLean (Sam Neill), Grace's father and Annie's husband, unexpectedly shows up at the ranch. Annie is increasingly torn by her feelings for Tom and her love for her family. Soon, with Tom's help, Grace finally takes the last step to heal herself and Pilgrim ‚Äì riding Pilgrim again. As the MacLeans get ready to leave the Booker ranch, Robert tells Annie that he knew he was in love with her more than she loved him, and that if he could be a better father, husband or lawyer then it didn't matter, he did it all for the love he had for her. He felt that he didn't need more, he knows she is not sure how she feels about him, and now he wants her to make a choice, and not to come home until she is sure what she wants and that she loves him. Although Annie wishes she could stay with Tom on the ranch, she also knows that she belongs to the city, just like Tom's wife. Annie departs, driving away from the ranch, while Tom watches her go from the top of a hill. Cast Betty Buckley appeared as an ex-girlfriend of Tom Booker but was cut from the film. Background Although he had already directed several films, this was the first time Robert Redford directed a film that he also starred in. The main character, according to writer Nicholas Evans, is modeled after horse whisperers Tom Dorrance, Ray Hunt and, in particular, their younger disciple Buck Brannaman. Brannaman also doubled for Robert Redford in the film and served as the consultant. Redford likewise assisted in the production of the documentary Buck. Evans said, \\"Others have claimed to be the inspiration for Tom Booker in The Horse Whisperer. The one who truly inspired me was Buck Brannaman. His skill, understanding and his gentle, loving heart have parted the clouds for countless troubled creatures. Buck is the Zen master of the horse world.\\" Horse training methods and controversies The schooling administered to the traumatized horse is faithful to a number of basic natural horsemanship techniques, although the portrayal in the film does not follow the specific method of any one practitioner. Nicholas Evans writes: \\"I spent many weeks traveling across the West and met three amazing horsemen: Tom Dorrance, Ray Hunt and Buck Brannaman.\\" The horse training methods shown are not entirely without controversy. While Brannaman was the on-site technical consultant, he did not have creative control. The constraints of film-making required a number of sequences to be edited for length, thus not showing some critical training elements that would normally be used. A few basic safety problems in the film include Redford kneeling in front of a horse known to charge humans in one scene, and wearing a large ring on his finger while training in another, a risky practice in the real world when simultaneously handling a dangerous horse and a rope. A fundamental literary device used that goes against basic horse psychology was that of having Pilgrim, apparently a well-trained horse, suddenly became a vicious rogue following a single traumatic event. A horse may have a strong reaction after an accident if the elements that preceded the trauma are repeated at a future time (for example, it would be reasonable for Pilgrim to have developed a fear of vehicles, of crossing a road, or of climbing a steep slope), but not generally a complete change in personality, manner and outlook in the way that can occur in traumatized humans. Such behavioral changes in a horse would normally be the result of sustained, long-term animal abuse. A practitioner of natural horsemanship, John Lyons, provided an equestrian's critique of the film, noting that while there were many positive messages, there was also the potential for people to get some dangerous messages about horse training from certain sequences. He first noted that the multiple horses that played Pilgrim were all well-trained animals and that the movie did not represent a real-life time frame for training a single real-life animal. He pointed out that the film made the rehabilitation of the horse appear to be a one-session event, when in reality it would take considerable time for such a change to occur. Lyons criticized a number of dangerous practices shown in the movie, and was particularly critical of the scene where Booker hobbles, ropes, and lays the exhausted horse on the ground, then has Grace get on the recumbent horse, which is then allowed to rise, and the horse and girl miraculously are both cured of their fears and once again a horse and rider team. He argued that the actual real-life practical risk of injury to horse and human in such a method is considerable, that a horse pushed to exhaustion is not \\"trained,\\" and pushing a fearful rider in such a fashion is ill-advised. However, Lyons' critique also recognized the limitations of Hollywood film-making, stating, \\"In order to tell a story, things are often done that would be imprudent for horse owners to attempt.\\" ‚Äì John Lyons critiques the horse training methods it depicts. Reception The film received mixed-to-positive reviews upon its release. Janet Maslin in The New York Times says that the film \\"sustains great visual intensity thanks to Robert Richardson's majestic cinematography\\" but its \\"rock-solid values\\" are diluted by \\"a misconceived ending\\", whereas CNN in a rather sarcastic review complains that the storytelling was \\"all done very, very slowly\\" and mentions the film's length. Film critics Gene Siskel and Roger Ebert gave the film \\"two thumbs up\\" on their weekly TV show At the Movies. Leonard Maltin gave the film three and a half stars out of a possible four, and called the film an \\"exquisite rendering of Evans' novel\\". Rotten Tomatoes reports that of 57 reviews, 74% were positive, with the consensus \\"It might be a bit too eager to tug the heartstrings, but The Horse Whisperer is typically graceful, well-crafted Redford‚Äîon both sides of the camera.\\" and Metacritic gives the film an average score of 65/100, based on 19 reviews. The film was also a box office hit and grossed $187 million worldwide ($75m in the US). The song \\"A Soft Place to Fall\\" by Allison Moorer and Gwil Owen was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Original Song. Moorer performs the song in the movie. The film was nominated for Best Motion Picture ‚Äì Drama and Redford for Best Director at the 56th Golden Globe Awards. In popular culture The movie's popularity led to the word \\"whisperer\\" being coined as a slang term for anyone with a strong affinity for a particular animal or being. *In \\"Saving Private Brian\\", the November 5, 2006 episode of Family Guy, Peter Griffin is seen in a cutaway gag whispering a remark about a female passerby to a horse, who then laughs and agrees with Peter. * In the 2015 biographical feature film Steve Jobs, Apple CEO John Sculley (Jeff Daniels) has a talk with Steve Jobs (Michael Fassbender) because Jobs is perceived to be difficult to communicate with, and Sculley is perceived to be a \\"Steve whisperer\\".Barbuto, Dana (October 21, 2015). \\"Review: Aaron Sorkin makes 'Steve Jobs' work\\".

He played in Major League Baseball as a left-handed pitcher. During a thirteen-year baseball career, he pitched for the Texas Rangers, Chicago White Sox, San Francisco Giants, Tampa Bay Devil Rays, and Los Angeles Dodgers. Career Born in Maracaibo, Venezuela, Alvarez represented his hometown in the 1982 Little League World Series, where they finished with a 2-1 record. Alvarez began his professional baseball career when he was signed by the Texas Rangers as an amateur free agent on September 23, 1986. He made his major league debut at the age of nineteen on July 24, 1989. Five days later, he was traded with Scott Fletcher and Sammy Sosa to the Chicago White Sox for Harold Baines and Fred Manrique. Alvarez provided one of the highlights of the 1991 Chicago White Sox season on August 11, pitching a no-hitter against the Baltimore Orioles at Memorial Stadium in only his second Major League start. It was quite a contrast to his only previous appearance, when he faced five batters for the Rangers and gave up two walks, a single and two home runs without retiring a batter, giving him a career ERA, prior to his no-hit gem, of infinity. Alvarez had control problems in the minors, and it carried over to the big leagues. After shouldering a very heavy workload in 1991, he was kept under scrutiny for most of the season. Between the majors, minors and winter league action, Alvarez worked close to 300 innings in '91; a significant number for anyone, but especially for a 21-year-old pitcher. It wasn't until that he managed to break into the rotation permanently. That season, Alvarez won 15 games and finished second in the league in earned run average, but his control problems continued; he led the league with 122 walks. In , Alvarez went 12‚Äì8 and made the American League All-Star team. After a disappointing 8‚Äì11 in , he had 15 wins and 181 strikeouts in . During the season, the White Sox traded √Ålvarez, Danny Darwin, and Roberto Hern√°ndez to the San Francisco Giants for six prospects (Keith Foulke, Bob Howry, Lorenzo Barcel√≥, Mike Caruso, Ken Vining, and Brian Manning) in what became known as the White Flag Trade. A free agent after the season, he signed a five-year contract with Tampa Bay. He was the team's first pitcher, and started Opening Day on March 31, 1998, throwing the Devil Rays' first ever pitch (a ball to Detroit's Brian L. Hunter). Inconsistency and poor conditioning continually kept him from realizing his full potential. In his first season with the Devil Rays, Alvarez missed two months with tendinitis in his shoulder, eventually losing 14 games during the season. The following year he made two trips to the disabled list. Finally, he had arthroscopic shoulder surgery and missed the next two seasons. After finishing his contract with Tampa Bay, √Ålvarez signed with the Dodgers. He began the 2003 season as a starter for Triple-A Las Vegas. After going 5‚Äì1 with a 1.15 ERA, he filled the long relief role for the Dodgers at mid-season. Later he got a chance to start, collecting a 5‚Äì0 record and 1.06 ERA over a stretch of nine games. In 2004, he went 7‚Äì6 in 40 games (15 as a starter). On August 1, 2005, Alvarez announced he would retire after the season. He compiled a career 102‚Äì92 record with 1330 strikeouts and a 3.96 ERA in 1747.2 innings. After a brief stint as the pitching coach of the State College Spikes (from 2007‚Äì2008), √Ålvarez joined the Baltimore Orioles organization when he was named pitching coach of the Gulf Coast League Orioles in 2013. He was dismissed from that job in June 2019. In 2010, √Ålvarez gained induction into the Caribbean Baseball Hall of Fame. Personal life He is the father of Viviana, Vannessa, and Valentina Alvarez, and currently lives in Florida.

He was the founding editor-in-chief of The Marshall Project. Previously, he was a columnist for The New York Times, and served as the paper's executive editor from July 2003 until September 2011. On June 2, 2011, he announced that he would step down from the position to become a full-time writer. Jill Abramson replaced him as executive editor. Keller worked in the Times Moscow bureau from 1986 to 1991, eventually as bureau chief, spanning the final years of the Cold War and the dissolution of the Soviet Union. For his reporting during 1988 he won a Pulitzer Prize. Early life Keller is the son of former chairman and chief executive of the Chevron Corporation, George M. Keller.

That is, in the Soviet Union during the year it established its Congress of People's Deputies, the last year before the revolutions of 1989 in Central and Eastern Europe. 2003 Invasion of Iraq Keller was a leading supporter of the 2003 invasion of Iraq, explaining his backing for military action in his article 'The I-Can't-Believe-I'm-A-Hawk Club'. Two days after the invasion, Keller wrote the column 'Why Colin Powell Should Go' arguing for US Secretary of State's resignation because his strategy of diplomacy at the UN had failed. In contrast, Keller was much more sympathetic to Deputy Defence Secretary Paul Wolfowitz, describing him as the 'Sunshine Warrior'. Judith Miller Keller spoke on July 6, 2005 in defense of Judith Miller and her refusal to give up documents relating to the Valerie Plame case. NSA Terrorist Surveillance Program Keller was reported to have refused to answer questions from The Times public editor, Byron Calame, on the timing of the December 16, 2005 article on the classified National Security Agency (NSA) Terrorist Surveillance Program. Keller's delay of the paper's reporting about NSA overreach until after Bush's close reelection was controversial. The Times's series of articles on this topic won a Pulitzer Prize. The source of the disclosure of this NSA program was investigated by the United States Justice Department. The NSA program itself was reviewed by the Senate Judiciary Committee as to whether it sidesteps the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act, and after The Times articles, the Administration changed its procedures, allowing for more safeguards and more Congressional and judicial oversight. Keller discussed the deliberations behind the Times' decision to publish the story in a July 5, 2006 PBS interview with Jeffrey Brown that included a discussion of the issues involved with former National Security Agency Director Admiral Bobby Ray Inman. Catholic Church sex abuse crisis Keller widely reported on the Catholic sex abuse cases and flatly put the blame on John Paul II himself : \\"The uncomfortable and largely unspoken truth is that the current turmoil in the Roman Catholic Church is not just a sad footnote to the life of a beloved figure. This is a crisis of the pope's making.\\" SWIFT Keller and The Times also published a story on another classified program to monitor terrorist-related financial transactions through the Brussels, Belgium-based Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunication (SWIFT) on June 23, 2006. Many commentators,The Media‚Äôs War Against the War Continues - Andrew C. McCarthy - National Review Online as well as some elected officials such as U.S. Congressman Peter T. King, called for the U.S. Justice Department to prosecute The New York Times and the confidential sources who leaked the existence of this counter-terrorism program despite relevant statutes that forbid revealing classified information that could threaten national security, especially in a time of war. In an attempt to respond to criticism stemming from the disclosure of the classified Terrorist Finance Tracking Program, the NSA program's official name, Keller stated in a published letter that President Bush himself had acknowledged as early as September 2001 that efforts were underway \\"to identify and investigate the financial infrastructure of the international terrorist networks\\" and \\"to follow the money as a trail to the terrorists.\\" In an Op-ed column in The Times, Keller, together with Los Angeles Times editor Dean Baquet wrote that \\"Our job, especially in times like these, is to bring our readers information that will enable them to judge how well their elected leaders are fighting on their behalf and at what price.\\" Keller's critics, including U.S. Treasury Secretary John W. Snow, responded to Keller's letter by pointing out that there is a vast difference between stating general intentions to track terrorist finances and the exact means employed to achieve those goals. But, as Keller wrote, this was the same Secretary Snow who invited a group of reporters to a 6-day trip on a military aircraft \\"to show off the department's efforts to track terrorist financing.\\" Nelson Mandela Keller wrote a 128-page juvenile biography of Nelson Mandela published by Kingfisher Books in 2008, Tree Shaker: the story of Nelson Mandela.\\"Tree shaker: the story of Nelson Mandela\\".

Keller's wife since 1999, Emma Gilbey, wrote a full biography of Winnie Mandela published in 1993, The Lady: The Life and Times of Winnie Mandela (Jonathan Cape). KellerGate In January 2014, two articles by Keller and his wife about cancer blogger Lisa Bonchek Adams generated substantial controversy about the nature of social media, digital journalism and terminal illness. The incident came to be known in social media as KellerGate. On January 8, 2014, Keller's wife Emma had written an article about Lisa Adams in The Guardian about whether people with terminal illness should be so public on social media. She wrote \\"Should there be boundaries in this kind of experience? Is there such a thing as TMI? Are her tweets a grim equivalent of deathbed selfies? Why am I so obsessed?\\" The article was subsequently retracted by the editor, in part due to complaints by Adams and her family that the article \\"completely misrepresented the nature of her illness and her reasons for tweeting, was riddled with inaccuracies, and quoted from a private direct message to Keller through Twitter published without permission.\\" A week later, Bill Keller published his own article about Lisa Adams called \\"Heroic Measures,\\" this time questioning whether Lisa's efforts to prolong her life were worth the effort and cost, and suggesting those who \\"accept their inevitable fate with grace and courage\\" should be worthy of equal praise. The article ignited a backlash in many media channels. Articles appeared in The Nation (\\"Bill Keller Bullies Cancer Patient\\"), and The New Yorker among dozens of others. The Times' public editor, Margaret Sullivan responded to the criticism in a public column. The response included Keller's responses defending the column. Sullivan wrote that it is not her practice to comment on whether she agrees with columnists, but did cite \\"issues here of tone and sensitivity.\\" She also pointed out factual inaccuracies which were subsequently corrected. The Marshall Project The Marshall Project is a nonprofit nonpartisan online journalism organization covering criminal justice in the United States. The project was originally conceived by former hedge fund manager, filmmaker and journalist Neil Barsky, who announced it in his byline in an unrelated New York Times article in November 2013. In February 2014, The New York Times reported that Keller was going to work for the Marshall Project. The Marshall Project formally launched in November 2014 and as of 2017, Keller is still working and leading the editorial efforts there.

At that time in Central Europe, the age of industrialisation was taking place, whose beginnings were found in the 1840s. This period is not precisely dated, but in Austria the March Revolution of 1848 is generally accepted as the beginning of economic changes, in contrast to political reforms. Weimarisierung is another German term describing the years following the first world war. In Germany, as a consequence of the large influx of capital resulting from French war reparations from the Franco-Prussian War of 1870‚Äì1871, and the subsequent unification of Germany, there followed an economic boom, giving rise to the description of these years as the \\"founders' years\\". These years in Central Europe were a time that citizens increasingly influenced cultural development. This was also the epoch of classical liberalism, even if the political demands of the time were only partially met, and then only in the later period. Industrialisation also posed aesthetic challenges, above all in the fields of architecture and craftsmanship, through development of existing forms, rather than innovation as such. In common parlance, the term ' is often mingled with Historicism, which was the predominant architectural style after 1850 until 1914, leading to a blurring of the terms. In historical context, different decades are often also called Gr√ºnderzeit. For this reason, the term Gr√ºnderzeit is used to refer to several periods ‚Äì for example 1850‚Äì1873, 1871‚Äì1890, sometimes 1850‚Äì1914 in reference to the architecture, or just 1871‚Äì1873.  Economy  entrepreneurial boom of late 19th-century Germany; machine and locomotive ironworks of Borsig AG in Berlin's Feuerland, 1847 painting by Karl Eduard Biermann The German term ' refers to the great economic upswing in the mid-19th century, when the founders of businesses (, meaning entrepreneurs) could apparently become rich overnight. Of particular importance for speedy economic development was the rise of a developed railway system. Not only was it a major factor in its own right on the business scene of the time, but it also permitted further development through improved communication and migration. Rural migration to the cities assisted the development of a proletariat, with an attendant increase in social problems. The stock market crash of 1873, combined with economic overheating due to enormous French reparations from the war, put an abrupt end to this upswing, referred to in German as the founders' crisis ('), resulting in a twenty-year period of economic stagnation. This crisis caused the theory of economic liberalism to lose ground, and it was also this time which saw the introduction of business control mechanisms, as well as protective customs tariffs. The Vienna stock market crash led to the Panic of 1873 in the United States, resulting in the Long Depression.  Design and architecture  Nordstadt in Hanover The need for housing rose in consequence of industrialisation. Complete housing developments in the so-called Founding Epoch Architecture style arose in previously green fields, and even today in Central European cities large numbers of buildings from this time can be found together along one single road or even in complete districts. These 4- to 6-story buildings, often constructed by private property developers, often sported richly decorated fa√ßades in the form of Historicism such as Gothic Revival, Renaissance Revival, German Renaissance and Baroque Revival. Not only magnificent palaces for nouveau-riche citizens were built, but also infamous rental housing for the expanding urban lower classes. This phase was also important for the integration of new technologies in architecture and design. A determining factor was the development of the Bessemer process in steel production, which made possible the construction of steel fa√ßades. A classical example of this new form is the steel and glass construction of the Crystal Palace, completed in 1851, which was revolutionary for the time and an inspiration to subsequent decades.  Gr√ºnderzeit in Austria  In Austria, the Gr√ºnderzeit began after 1840 with the industrialisation of Vienna, as well as the regions of Bohemia and Moravia. Liberalism reached its zenith in Austria in 1867 during the Austro-Hungarian monarchy and remained dominant until the mid-1870s. Vienna, the capital and residence of Emperor Franz Joseph, after the failed uprising of 1848, became the fourth largest city in the world with the inclusion of suburbs and an influx of new residents from regions of Austria. In the place where the city wall had once stood, a ring road was built, and ambitious civic buildings‚Äîincluding the Opera House, Town Hall, and Parliament‚Äîwere constructed. In contrast to agricultural workers and urban labourers, an increasingly wealthy upper-middle class built itself monuments and mansions. This occurred on a smaller scale in cities such as Graz, but on the periphery, thereby preserving the old city from destructive redevelopment.  Gr√ºnderzeit in Germany  In the mindset of many Germans, the epoch is intrinsically linked with Kaiser Wilhelm I and Chancellor Bismarck, but it did not end with them (in 1888/1890) but continued well into the reign of Kaiser Wilhelm II. It was a Golden Age for Germany in which the disasters of the Thirty Years' War and the Napoleonic Wars were remedied, and the country competed internationally on a world-class level in the domains of science, technology, industry and commerce. This was the time when particularly the German middle class rapidly increased their standard of living, buying modern furniture, kitchen fittings and household machines. In German-speaking areas, a huge number of publications were produced, comparable, on a per-capita basis, to modern levels. Most were academic papers, and most were scientific and technical publications, often practical instruction manuals on topics such as dike construction. There was no copyright law in most places (with the exception of the UK) at the time. Since popular works were immediately re-published by competitors, publishers needed a constant stream of new material. Fees paid to authors for new works were high, and significantly supplemented the incomes of many academics. Prices of reprints were low, so publications could be bought by poorer people. A widespread public obsession with reading lead to the rapid autodidactic dissemination of new knowledge to a broader audience. After copyright law gradually became established in the 1840s, the low-price mass market vanished, and fewer, more expensive editions were published. Typical Aachen street with early 20th-century houses The social effects of industrialization were the same as in other European nations: increased agricultural efficiency and introduction of new agricultural machines led to a polarized distribution of income in the countryside. The landowners won out to the disadvantage of the agrarian unpropertied workforce. Emigration, most of all to America, and urbanization were a consequence. In the rapidly growing industrial cities, new workers' dwellings were erected, lacking in comfort by today's standards but also criticized as unhealthy by physicians of the time: \\"without light, air and sun\\", quite contrary to the then prevailing ideas on town planning. The dark, cramped flats took a large part of the blame for the marked increase in tuberculosis, which spread also to wealthier neighbourhoods. Nevertheless, the working class also saw improvements of living standards and other conditions, such as social security through laws on workers' health insurance and accident insurance introduced by Bismarck in 1883‚Äì1884, and in the long run also through the foundation of a Social Democracy that would remain the model for the European sister parties until Hitler's Macht√ºbernahme in 1933. Even today, the model of social care developed by Bismarck in 1873 (Reichsversicherungsordnung) remains the contractual basis for health insurance in Germany.

It was founded in 1819 by Presbyterian minister Isaac L. Anderson for the purpose of furthering education and enlightenment into the West. The college is one of the 50 oldest colleges in the United States and the 12th-oldest institution in the South. It is associated with the Presbyterian Church (USA) and enrolls about 1,100 students. Maryville College's nickname is the Fighting Scots. The sports teams compete in NCAA Division III athletics in the USA South Athletic Conference. Academics As a liberal arts school, the college promotes a well-rounded education. The school requires numerous general education courses to achieve this. The courses are taken through the conclusion of the student's education, contributing to the graduating student's becoming knowledgeable in a number of fields. Maryville College is one of the few colleges in the nation that requires graduating students to complete a comprehensive exam in their major and conduct an extensive senior thesis. History Anderson Hall Founding Maryville College was founded as the Southern and Western Theological Seminary in 1819 by Isaac L. Anderson, a Presbyterian minister. Anderson had founded a school, Union Academy, in nearby Knox County, before becoming minister at New Providence Presbyterian Church in Maryville. He expressed to his fellow clergy the need for more ministers in the community, including a request to the Home Missionary Society and an appeal to divinity students at Princeton University in 1819. The new seminary was intended to help fill this need for ministers. It opened with a class of five men, and the new school was adopted by the Synod of Tennessee and formally named the Southern and Western Theological Seminary in October 1819.Contributions to American Educational History, by Herbert Baxter Adams, 1893.

Swift was founded by William Henderson Franklin, the first African American to graduate from Maryville College (1880). His institute educated black students during the era of imposed segregation. After the Brown v. Board of Education decision in 1954, Maryville College immediately re-enrolled African Americans. In 1875, Maryville College conferred the first college degree to a woman in the state of Tennessee. The recipient was Mary T. Wilson, the older sister of Samuel T. Wilson, who later served as president of the college from 1901 until 1930. Campus Thaw Hall, home of the library and the Social Science majors Maryville College is located in the City of Maryville, Blount County, Tennessee. Its current campus was established in 1869 on a that was then on the city's outskirts.

The Guns of August thus provides a narrative of the earliest stages of World War I, from the decisions to go to war, up until the start of the Franco-British offensive that stopped the German advance into France. The result was four years of trench warfare. In the course of her narrative Tuchman includes discussion of the plans, strategies, world events, and international sentiments before and during the war.

Tuchman later returned to the subject of the social attitudes and issues that existed before World War I, which she had touched upon in The Guns of August, in a collection of eight essays published in 1966 under the title The Proud Tower: A Portrait of the World Before the War, 1890‚Äì1914. Summary A funeral In May 1910 the funeral of Edward VII of the United Kingdom drew the presence of nine kings, one being Kaiser Wilhelm II of Germany. Wilhelm, or William, was Edward's nephew. The opening chapter begins and ends with a description of the royal funeral and in between provides a discussion of the continent's political alliances and the diplomacy of royalty, all amidst the national rivalries, imperialism, and social Darwinism in the years leading up to the Great War (1914‚Äì1918). Plans Chapters 2 to 5 are grouped into a section called \\"Plans\\". Addressed is prewar military planning, as done by the major powers in Europe. Included are the German Schlieffen plan, France's offensive Plan XVII, joint British and French arrangements, and Russia's approach to a future European war. Outbreak \\"Outbreak\\" starts with a short introduction, which briefly mentions the event that triggered World War I. On June 28, 1914, in Sarajevo, Gavrilo Princip, a Serbian nationalist, assassinated the heir apparent to the throne of Austria- Hungary, the Archduke Franz Ferdinand and his wife Sophie, Duchess of Hohenberg. European-wide diplomacy and military preparations during July are then referenced. Chapters 6 to 9 commence with August 1914. Discussed and probed are maneuvers by leading politicians, diplomatic affairs, and actions undertaken by various armies, during the opening days of the war, August 1 to August 4. Covered are the Kaiser's hesitation, the struggle by Russia to ensure that its ally, France, would join in the war, France's attempts to win a guarantee from Britain of her involvement, and Germany's ultimatum to Belgium. Battle The bulk of the remainder of the book, chapters 10 to 22, is essentially devoted to the battles and tactical planning on two fronts, the Western (chapters 11 to 14, 17, and 19 to 22) and the Eastern (chapters 15 and 16). However, Austria, and the Balkans, are omitted.Tuchman ignores the war fought between Austria and Russia and between Austria and Serbia, ll except as it touches on the Mediterranean. In her Author's Note, she explains that the \\"inexhaustible problems of the Balkans\\" would necessitate a \\"tiresome length,\\" which fortunately can be omitted without sacrificing the \\"unity\\" of the book. Hostile relations between the Austro-Hungarian Empire and Kingdom of Serbia thus fail to merit further mention. Chapters 10 and 18 are devoted to the war at sea. Intertwined in the narration are the adverse effects of the vanity of the various leaders and insubordination. Also addressed are some perceptions made among those in the rest of the world, including a critical interpretation of events that cemented various political views (such as chapter 17). The short \\"Afterword\\" then reflects on events of August 1914. =Mediterranean= Tuchman starts the \\"Battle\\" section by covering the search by Allied naval forces for the German battlecruiser in the Mediterranean (chapter 10). The Goeben finally took refuge in the Dardanelles, waters of the then neutral Ottoman Empire. Such naval actions set off diplomatic maneuvers, but the event precipitated Turkey's entry into the war on the side of Germany. The development worked to block Russian import/export via its year-round ports on the Black Sea. That, in turn, led to the disastrous Gallipoli Campaign. =Western Front= Chapters 11 to 14 cover the war in western Europe. First discussed are the German invasion northeast of Belgium and the general Western Front, especially the situation in Alsace. Next, Tuchman describes the arrival in France of the British Expeditionary Force (chapter 12). As they crossed the Belgian frontier, the German armies were engaged by the Belgian army in front of Li√®ge, and in the east of France, by five French armies, and in the south of Belgium, by four British divisions (known as the British Expeditionary Force). The French were said to be labouring under the delusion that Gallic √©lan would be crucial in countering German attacks while the British fought hard at the Battle of Mons. In August, each side deployed its armed forces in order to effect its own strategies developed in advance of the war (discussed in \\"Plans\\"). The French High Command had made incomplete allowances for dealing with the large massed attack by the German army, which now came quickly bearing down on them. It was perhaps through the decisions of Charles Lanrezac, the French Fifth Army commander,who acted in a timely fashion before getting permission from Joseph Joffre, that the entire French line was eventually saved from envelopment and general collapse. Although his pleas were ignored, Lanrezac withdrew his forces at Charleroi from an untenable position and probable destruction, and he redeployed them more favorably. He was later relieved of command. The Battle of the Frontiers was brutal. The Belgian army was rushed against the German army, but the Allies were forced to retreat slowly under the German onslaught until the Germans were within 40 miles (64 km) of Paris. The city was saved through the courage and verve of a semiretired territorial general, Joseph Gallieni, who marshalled his limited resources and saved the day. The city was preparing for siege and possible complete destruction, and the government had fled south, when two divisions of reserves suddenly arrived and were rushed to the front by the city's fleet of 600 taxi cabs. Tuchman cynically notes that Joffre later took complete credit for saving Paris and the French army after having the commander who ordered the tactical retreat, Lanrezac, relieved of duty and the old commander and his former superior, Gallieni, pushed back into obscurity. Tuchman is also careful to point out that although many of Joffre's actions were shameful, when he was finally pushed into action, he showed great skill in guiding the hastily improvised counterblow that crashed into the invader's flank. The Germans greatly contributed to their own undoing by outrunning their supply lines, pushing their infantry to the point of physical collapse and deviating from the original invasion plan, which called for the right flank to be protected from counterattack. At that stage of its offensive, the German army lacked the troops used by the siege of the fortress of Antwerp, held by the Belgian army. Both sides were plagued by poor communication and general staffs that were heavily invested with politics and sycophancy. Dire warnings from commanders in the field were ignored when they did not fit preconceived notions of quick victory at low cost. Tuchman introduces all of the key players, both the Allied (French, British, Belgian and Russian) and the German commanders. Their personalities, strengths, and weaknesses are discussed. * Joseph Joffre, French General, Chief of Staff of the Grand Quartier G√©n√©ral * Lord Kitchener, the British Secretary of State for War * Helmuth von Moltke, Chief of the German General Staff * Alexander von Kluck, commander of the German far right wing * Wilhelm II, German Emperor and King of Prussia (aka \\"The Kaiser\\") * Albert I, King of the Belgians * French President Raymond Poincar√©, Britain's First Lord of the Admiralty Winston Churchill, and a young soldier named Charles de Gaulle, who fought for France =Russia and Germany= Only chapters 15 and 16 are devoted to the Eastern Front, and center on the Russian invasion of East Prussia and the German reaction to it, culminating in the Battle of Tannenberg, where the Russian advance was stopped, decisively. In the chapters, Tuchman covers the series of errors, faulty plans, poor communications, and poor logistics, which, among other things, decidedly helped the French in the west. For example, the Germans mistakenly transferred, from the west, two corps to defend against what the book refers to as the 'Russian Steam Roller'. The great misery that developed on the Eastern Front is noted. =Flames of Louvain= Woven into the text about the battles in Belgium are threads of fact that Allied governments would employ in the formation of the West's eventual opinion that Germany had been the aggressor nation against Belgium. Such facts and conclusions would be repeated for the duration of the war and greatly affect the future involvement of the United States. Also here in chapter 17 The Flames of Louvain, Tuchman places a selection of German views from a variety of sources as to the aims and desires of Germany. She cites Thomas Mann as saying the goal was \\"the establishment of the German idea in history, the enthronement of Kultur, the fulfillment of Germany's historical mission\\". She then conveys American reporter Irvin S. Cobb's account of an interview with a 'German scientist': \\"Germany [is] for progress. German Kultur will enlighten the world and after this war there will never be another.\\" Yet further, a 'German businessman' opines that the war will give Europe \\"a new map, and Germany will be at the center of it\\" (aims similar to the Septemberprogramm).See below at \\"Critical analysis\\". Such outspoken menace worked to solidify opposition to Germany, caused George Bernard Shaw to become \\"fed up\\" at Prussian Militarism, and H.G. Wells to condemn the German \\"war god\\" and hope for an end to all armed conflict. Chapter 17's main focus is the German army's atrocities in Belgium, in particular against the historic university city of Louvain. Tuchman frames her remarks by describing the Schrecklichkeit, the German military's \\"theory of terror\\". Accordingly, in a failed attempt to suppress the \\"illegal\\" franc- tireur (civilians shooting at German troops), hundreds of nearby citizens at several Belgium towns had been executed. Her accounts of the ferocity of such German army reprisals against the general population and of the willful burning of Louvain, such as its university library make it obvious why the Western Allies might feel themselves justified to condemn Germany and Germans wholesale. =War at sea= Chapter 18 describes the British fear that since their island nation was dependent on overseas imports, the German navy could manage to disrupt their international trade. Although Britain's navy was superior in ships and experience, perhaps the German navy's \\"best opportunity for a successful battle was in the first two or three weeks of the war.\\" However, the German High Seas Fleet remained in port and was ordered not to challenge the British warships watching the North Sea. Thus, a substantial control over the world's seaways was then exerted by the British Royal Navy. Surrounding the neutral role of the United States, diplomatic politicking quickly intensified. On August 6, Washington formally requested the Europeans to agree to follow the 1908 Declaration of London, which \\"favored the neutrals' right to trade as against the belligerents' right to blockade.\\" Germany agreed. Britain \\"said Yes and meant No\\" and supplemented an Order of Council on August 20 (the 100th anniversary of Britain's burning of Washington). Despite the equitable intent of international law, Britain sought to receive supplies from America while its naval blockade of Germany denied the supplies to Germany. Woodrow Wilson had already advised Americans on August 18 to be \\"neutral in fact as well as in name, impartial in thought as well as in action\\" so that America might become the \\"impartial mediator\\" that could then bring \\"standards of righteousness and humanity\\" to the belligerents in order to negotiate \\"a peace without victory\\" in Europe. Both wartime paper profits from a nearly fourfold increase in trade with Britain and France and \\"German folly\\" eventually would later work to cause American entry into World War I. =Paris defended= The book's last four chapters (19‚Äì22) describe the fighting in France up to the beginning of the First Battle of the Marne. The French and British forces, united at last, fell on Alexander von Kluck's exposed right flank in what would be the first successful offensive by the Allies. In the subsequent attack, the Germans were forced back north, with both sides suffering terrible losses. While Paris had been saved, the war took on a new cast, with both sides settling into a defensive trench system, which cut across France and Belgium from the Channel to Switzerland. That became known as the Western Front, and over the next four years, it would consume a generation of young men. Afterword Tuchman briefly offers reflections on the First Battle of the Marne and on the war in general. The war's opening \\"produced deadlock on the Western Front. Sucking up lives at the rate of 5,000 and sometimes 50,000 a day, absorbing munitions, energy, money, brains, and trained men,\\" it ate up its contestants. \\"The nations were caught in a trap....\\" With time, such a war would become intolerable. \\"Men could not sustain a war of such magnitude and pain without hope‚Äìthe hope that its very enormity would ensure that it could never happen again.\\" Miscalculations leading to war Throughout the aforementioned narrative, Tuchman constantly brings up a theme: the numerous misconceptions, miscalculations, and mistakes that she believed resulted in the tragedy of trench warfare, such as: * Economic miscalculation: Tuchman says both European intellectuals and leaders overestimated the power of free trade. They believed that the interconnectedness of European nations through trade would stop a continent- wide war from breaking out, as the economic consequences would be too great. However, the assumption was incorrect. For example, Tuchman noted that Moltke, when warned of such consequences, refused to even consider them in his plans, arguing he was a \\"soldier,\\" not an \\"economist.\\" * Unfounded belief in quick warfare: except for a very few politicians (who were at the time ridiculed and excluded because of their views, with only Lord Kitchener having the authority to act on his anticipation of a long war), all the leaders of the major combatants believed the war would be concluded in a matter of weeks, certainly by the end of 1914. Tuchman recounted the story of a British statesman who, after he warned others that the war might last two or three years, was branded a \\"pessimist.\\" That false assumption had disastrous effects, especially on logistics (see below). * Over-reliance on morale and the offensive: Tuchman details, in depth, how the leaders of the major powers, before the war, developed a philosophy of warfare based almost entirely on morale, a constant offensive, and retaining the initiative. Joffre, in particular, refused to consider going on the defensive/or even to slow the offensive, even when the realities of the battlefield demonstrated that his approach was not working. * Failure to consider political backlash: many war planners did not take into consideration the political and treaty-based consequences of their offensive actions. As Tuchman argues, the German leaders in particular refused to consider the consequences of moving their armies into Belgium despite that country's neutrality. Despite Moltke's concerns, German generals insisted on moving through Belgium because they needed to maneuver. They failed (or refused) to realize that by invading Belgium, they effectively forced Britain to declare war because of existing treaties and national honor. * Outdated forms of wartime etiquette: although the technology, aims, methods, and plans of World War I were significantly different from earlier wars, military leaders in occupied territories continued to have an expectation of a form of martial etiquette from civilians, regarding co-operation and obedience of instructions, as a reciprocal part of non-combatant status; which increased resentment between the citizens of the opposing nations. To illustrate, Tuchman repeatedly uses quotes from the diaries of German generals who commandeered the homes and supplies of civilians. One recurrent theme in their diary entries was that they simply could not understand why the property owners refused full co-operation, in line with traditional wartime courtesy. In a somewhat comical passage, Tuchman even quotes from a general who criticized the master of a Belgian house for failing to sit with him at dinner and observe proper mealtime etiquette despite the fact that the Germans had violated his country's neutrality, taken over his house, and stolen or destroyed much of his property. Similar problems occurred in the practical application of submarine, and later aerial, warfare. Overall, Tuchman argues that while some of the war's major combatants looked forward to a war, specifically Germany and Austria-Hungary, all of them expected it to be a short one, and none of them desired or anticipated a prolonged war. Likewise, she argues that even successes, such as the First Battle of the Marne, a French victory, were to some extent accidental victories that were won despite, and not because of, military leadership or strategy. Cultural impact The book was an immediate bestseller and was on the bestseller list of The New York Times for 42 consecutive weeks. The Pulitzer Prize nomination committee was unable to award it the prize for outstanding history because Joseph Pulitzer's will specifically stated that the recipient of the Pulitzer Prize for History must be a book on American history. Instead, Tuchman was given the prize for general nonfiction. Military historian Max Hastings has written that \\"my generation of students eagerly devoured\\" Tuchman's book, although it came as a \\"shock\\" to them when they heard an academic historian describe it as \\"hopelessly unscholarly\\". According to the cover notes of an audio version of The Guns of August, \\"[President John F. Kennedy] was so impressed by the book, he gave copies to his cabinet and principal military advisers, and commanded them to read it.\\" In his book One Minute to Midnight about the Cuban Missile Crisis, Michael Dobbs notes the deep impression Guns had on Kennedy. He often quoted from it and wanted \\"every officer in the Army\\" to read it as well. Subsequently, \\"[t]he secretary of the Army sent copies to every U.S. military base in the world. Kennedy drew from The Guns of August to help in dealing with the crisis in Cuba, including the profound and unpredictable implications a rapid escalation of the situation could have. Excerpt online. Robert S. McNamara, United States Secretary of Defense during Kennedy's presidency, recalled that \\"[e]arly in his administration, President Kennedy asked his cabinet officials and members of the National Security Council\\" to read The Guns of August. McNamara related that Kennedy said The Guns of August graphically portrayed how Europe's leaders had bungled into the debacle of World War I, and that Kennedy told later his cabinet officials that \\"We are not going to bungle into war.\\" The British Prime Minister Harold Macmillan, who had served on the Western Front during the First World War, was also profoundly affected by the book. In his diary for Monday, 22 October 1962, he wrote: Graham Allison, a political scientist who covered the Cuban Missile Crisis in Essence of Decision, noted the effect of the Tuchman's book on Kennedy, but also its implications for the proper study of decision-making and warfare. Allison created an entire model of decision-making, which he called the Organizational Process Model, based on such issues as those covered by Tuchman, a model that directly countered game theory and other rationalistic means of explaining events. After Kennedy was assassinated on November 22, 1963, representatives from over 90 countries attended the state funeral on November 25. They included 19 presidents, prime ministers, and members of royal families, including French President Charles de Gaulle, Ethiopian Emperor Haile Selassie, Belgium's King Baudouin, West German Chancellor Ludwig Erhard Britain's Prince Philip, and Greece's Queen Frederika. NBC News producer Reuven Frank recounted in his autobiography that everybody in the control room had read the book and gasped when seeing the many heads of state marching on foot. The funeral saw the largest gathering of presidents, prime ministers, and royalty at a state funeral since that of King Edward VII. In all, 220 foreign dignitaries from 92 countries, five international agencies, and the papacy attended the funeral.  Tuchman in the narrative  While she did not explicitly mention it in The Guns of August, Tuchman was present for one of the pivotal events of the book: the pursuit of the German battle cruiser Goeben and light cruiser Breslau. In her account of the pursuit she wrote, \\"That morning [August 10, 1914] there arrived in Constantinople the small Italian passenger steamer which had witnessed the Gloucester's action against Goeben and Breslau. Among its passengers were the daughter, son-in-law and three grandchildren of the American ambassador Mr. Henry Morgenthau.\\" As she was a grandchild of Henry Morgenthau, she is referring to herself, which is confirmed in her later book Practicing History, in which she tells the story of her father, Maurice Wertheim, traveling from Constantinople to Jerusalem on August 29, 1914 to deliver funds to the Jewish community there. Thus, at age two, Tuchman was present during the pursuit of Goeben and Breslau, which she documented 48 years later. Film adaptation The book was the basis for a 1964 documentary film, also titled The Guns of August.Bart, Peter (February 22, 1965) \\"Reign of Comedy as King in Hollywood Nears End\\" The New York Times The 99-minute film, which premiered in New York City on December 24, 1964, was produced and directed by Nathan Kroll and narrated by Fritz Weaver, with the narration written by Arthur B.

It is a United Negro College Fund member school. A slow period of decline began in the 1970s, and by 2015, the school had an enrollment of just 11 students. In May 2015, the College suspended classes until Fall 2016 term in hopes of reorganizing. On May 17, 2018, the Tennessee Higher Education Commission gave its approval for Knoxville College to once again reopen its doors and offer classes. On 1 July 2018 Knoxville College website announced resumption of enrolling students, for fall 2018 semester. History Establishment Knoxville College is rooted in a mission school established in Knoxville in 1864 by R. J. Creswell of the United Presbyterian Church to educate the city's free blacks and freed slaves.Cynthia Fleming, \\"Knoxville College: A History and Some Recollections of the First Fifty Years,\\" East Tennessee Historical Society Publications, Vol. 58-59 (1986-1987), pp. 89-111. This school initially met in the First Baptist Church building (which at the time was located on Gay Street) before moving to a permanent facility in East Knoxville in 1866. In spite of general apathy from the city's leaders and threats from poor whites, the school's enrollment gradually grew to over 100. In addition to black students, the school also had many white students until 1901, when Tennessee passed a law forcibly segregating all schools. Knoxville College, as it appeared on an 1886 map of Knoxville In the 1870s, the church's Freedmen's Mission, which had established mission schools for freed slaves across the South, decided to refocus its efforts on building a larger, better-equipped school in Knoxville, in part due to stiff competition from other denominations in Nashville. In 1875, the church sold its East Knoxville property and purchased its current property, which at the time consisted of a hill that had been occupied by a Confederate battery during the Civil War.Digby Gordon Seymour, Divided Loyalties: Fort Sanders and the Civil War in East Tennessee (Knoxville, Tenn.: University of Tennessee Press, 1963), p. 108. The school's first building, McKee Hall, named for the Reverend O.S. McKee, was completed in 1876, and the school opened in December of that year. Former governor William G. Brownlow and gubernatorial candidate William F. Yardley spoke at the opening ceremonies.East Tennessee Historical Society, Lucile Deaderick (ed.), Heart of the Valley: A History of Knoxville, Tennessee (Knoxville, Tenn.: East Tennessee Historical Society, 1976), p. 41. The Reverend J. S. McCulloch was named the school's first principal, and Eliza B. Wallace was named the school's principal of female students.East Tennessee Historical Society, Mary Rothrock (ed.), The French Broad-Holston Country: A History of Knox County, Tennessee (Knoxville, Tenn.: East Tennessee Historical Society, 1972), pp. 318-319. The new school was primarily a normal school, which trained teachers, but also operated an academy for the education of local children. In 1877, the school was designated a college by the state, to the surprise of McCulloch, as few of the school's students were ready for a college-level curriculum. In 1890, the state designated the school the recipient of its Morrill Act funds for blacks, with which the school established mechanical and agricultural departments.Lois Clark and Lowell Giffen, \\"Knoxville College,\\" An Encyclopedia of East Tennessee (Oak Ridge, Tenn.: Children's Museum of Oak Ridge, 1981), pp. 274-275. Early 20th century growth Knoxville College in the early 20th century In 1901, Knoxville College finally received a charter from the State of Tennessee. Six years later, the school established the Eliza B. Wallace Hospital, which served a dual purpose of training nurses and tending to the health needs of the local black community. This proved invaluable during the city's Influenza outbreak of 1918. In 1913, John Henry Michael, the head of the school's mechanical department, designed the \\"Negro Building\\" for the National Conservation Exposition, which was held across town at Chilhowee Park. The building, which is no longer standing, was constructed with the help of Knoxville College students. The Negro Building at the National Conservation Exposition, designed and built by Knoxville College faculty and students During World War I, Knoxville College students helped raise money for liberty bonds and the Red Cross. In the aftermath of the Riot of 1919, one of the city's worst racial episodes, the school's administration (comprising black and white members) staunchly defended the city's African American community, and praised its students' restraint. In 1925, Knoxville College students staged a month-long boycott of classes to protest the school's strict behavioral code, culminating in an all-night negotiating session between student leaders and the school's dean, Herbert Telford. Telford agreed to relax some rules, and allowed the creation of a student council. In 1957, Knoxville College became one of the first group of predominantly black institutions admitted to full membership in the Southern Association of Colleges and Schools (SACS). Throughout the summer of 1960, Knoxville College students engaged in a series of sit-ins to protest segregation at lunch counters in downtown Knoxville, eventually convincing most downtown businesses to end the practice. The school's charter was amended in 1962 to allow the admission of white students. Accreditation loss, reorganization attempts, and closure Beginning in the 1970s, Knoxville College began to struggle financially, leading to a gradual decline. In 1997, the Southern Association of Colleges and Schools withdrew Knoxville College's accreditation; enrollment dropped precipitously and the school's financial situation became dire. As enrollment plummeted, the school's debt skyrocketed and it was soon unable to pay its faculty or electric bills. Throughout the rest of the 1990s, as enrollment plummeted, most campus buildings were shuttered and abandoned, with most degree programs being discontinued. In August 2005, the school's Board of Trustees fired the school's president, Barbara Hatton. Following Hatton's removal, the school's alumni association embarked on an aggressive fundraising campaign in 2006 and 2007 to save the college and return it to solvency. In January 2010, the school hired Dr. Horace A. Judson as interim president. Judson implemented a new strategic plan with the following goals: (1) regain accreditation, (2) achieve fiscal stability, (3) develop academic program distinctiveness, (4) develop a department of enrollment management, (5) develop a quality student-centered living and learning environment, and (6) establish new relationships and strengthen former ones among key constituents.Horace Judson, President's Update, Knoxville College Today, 28 March 2010. Retrieved: 7 April 2011. However, Judson soon left and the college continued to struggle. On June 9, 2014, the Environmental Protection Agency seized control of the long-shuttered A.K.

Enrollment had dwindled to just 11 students, and the college was struggling to pay back a $4.5 million loan from 2003 and more than $425,000 to the federal government for the Stewart Science Hall cleanup.

In September 2016, the City of Knoxville demanded that Knoxville College make repairs to fourteen of its buildings within 90 days or face condemnation. City crews subsequently boarded up the buildings. The Knoxville Fire Department responded to between four and five fires at abandoned buildings on campus in 2016, and estimated that since the buildings began falling into disuse after 1997, they had responded to twenty or thirty such fires there. , most of the campus sits abandoned, in an advanced state of disrepair. Most buildings are open to vagrants and vandals. This has caused severe damage to the buildings. The former college center has been set on fire twice. Since early 2018 The College administrative offices are back on campus again, occupying The college Annex which is next to McMillan Chapel. Plans have been made to renovate McMillan chapel and the Alumni Library. This is scheduled to take place in 2019. Campus Knoxville College is situated on a 17-building, campus, located atop a hill overlooking the Mechanicsville neighborhood, just northwest of Knoxville's downtown area. Along with administration and classroom buildings, the campus includes a performing arts center, a gymnasium, a library, a chapel, and a student center.

Academics , Knoxville College offered two degrees: the four-year Bachelor of Liberal Studies, and the two year Associate of Arts. The Bachelor of Liberal Studies includes one of four areas of concentration: Humanities, Business and Computer Sciences, Natural Sciences and Mathematics, or Social and Behavioral Sciences. The curriculum further requires 15 to 18 semester hours of specialization within each concentration, providing for a more in-depth understanding of a particular field. Knoxville College followed a debt-free policy that allowed students to complete the degree program without the accumulation of debt. This was accomplished primarily through its College Work Program, which allowed students to offset much of their tuition costs by working for several hours per week. This program involved a mix of performing various tasks around campus, community involvement, and internship programs. Student life Omega Psi Phi monument Knoxville College's Student Government Association (SGA), which was elected by the student body, acted as a liaison between students and campus administration. The SGA was led by a president, elected for one term.Knoxville College - Campus Organizations . Retrieved: 8 April 2011. Student activities included a dance team, a debate team, a choir, and a trivia team (which competed with other HBCUs in the Honda Bowl Competition). The school's newspaper, The Aurora, was published for over a century. The college also maintained a student ambassador program and wellness program that provided volunteer services for the surrounding community. After 1997, Knoxville College dropped most athletics programs due to declining enrollment, but as part of its reorganization, hopes to re-establish men's and women's basketball teams, as well as a cheerleading squad.

It is the first album recorded at his Nemo Studios in London that he used until 1987. It is a concept album based on duality. The album marks Vangelis' departure from the progressive rock sound on his previous album Earth (1973), with adoption of a more classical synthesized sound, as well his UK chart debut.  Overview  In 1975, Vangelis moved to London where he set up his own Nemo Studios. The album was his first record made at the studio. He recalls that \\"I was trying to put together the studio while recording my first album, Heaven and Hell, at the same time. In fact, the studio was Hell because there was unmixed concrete everywhere, builders all over the place making a lot of noise, and next to all that, there I was, trying to finish my album. There was no limit as to how much time I could spend working on the album, but I felt I just had to do it, and in any case, the only way you can complete the construction of a studio quickly is to start working in it before it's actually finished\\". Vangelis recalls \\"I don't like to prepare for a long, long, long time an album. It's more exciting for me to sit down and to play whatever comes. So this is the way that Heaven and Hell happens. I spent six weeks to make this album but I spent maybe two weeks to put down the first tracks\\". Vangelis played all the instruments except the choir. The album marked Vangelis' first collaboration with singer Jon Anderson, who sings on \\"So Long Ago, So Clear\\", the closing section of Part One. Vangelis recalls how they \\"sat down one day and I start to play the melody and he felt so comfortable that immediately he started to write the words\\".  Release  Heaven and Hell reached #31 in the UK Albums Chart on January 10, 1976. The album gained further recognition when \\"Movement 3\\" became the theme for the American television documentary series, Cosmos: A Personal Voyage by Carl Sagan. In 1981 it was released as a single titled \\"Heaven and Hell (Theme from 'The Cosmos')\\", and reached #48 in the UK Singles Chart on 18 July 1981. In 2011 the album was included along with Albedo 0.39 and Spiral in a 3-CD box set series \\"Original Album Classics\\" by Sony, RCA and Legacy Recordings. In 2013 the album was released as a remastered and reissued digipak edition by Esoteric Recordings. The same label in September 2014 released a remastered gatefold vinyl limited edition.  Composition  It is one of the most important works by Vangelis as it demonstrated for the first time his combination of synthesizer, percussion and a chorus in a rich orchestral style of electronic music. It is one of many thematic albums by Vangelis, contrasting images of Heaven, expressed with a more tranquil sound, and Hell, which sounds more avant-garde.  Reception  Steven McDonald of AllMusic described it as a \\"dark, thundering album\\" which \\"massed Gothic choirs and a musical depiction of all the tortures of the damned, with an impressive amount of string-driven shrieking\\", concluding \\"... it's a brilliant piece of work that should not be absent from any Vangelis collection\\". Henri Stirk from Background Magazine rated the 2013 edition by Esoteric Recordings 3/5 stars.

Its name means wine garden in German. Weingarten is located on Bertha Benz Memorial Route. While remains of a settlement from Roman or earlier times have been found nearby, the village itself developed from a farm belonging to the Wissembourg monastery in Northern Alsace; 985 is considered to be the village's founding year. Until 1803, Weingarten belonged to the Electorate of the Palatinate; in the course of the Napoleonic wars it became part of the Grand Duchy of Baden. The population is about two thirds protestant, one third catholic. The village is connected by Bundesstra√üe (federal road) B 3 and the railroad Frankfurt am Main-Basel. Close by is Bundesautobahn (motorway) A 5 Karlsruhe-Frankfurt am Main. The village has its own elementary and secondary school; further schools are in the neighbouring cities of Karlsruhe, Bruchsal and Stutensee. Business branches in the village are wine and fruit production, gastronomy, and industries (wood, chemicals, metal). For recreation, there are sports fields, an indoor swimming pool, a recreational lake, and the nature reserve Weingartener Moor. Also part of the municipality are the settlements Sallenbusch and Sohl in the Kraichgau hills and Waldbr√ºcke in the plain. The settlement of Sallenbusch was founded in June 1951 and constructed with the aid of U.S. soldiers. The first settlers arrived in July 1952.

Roberts believes that horses use a non-verbal language, which he terms \\"Equus,\\" and that humans can use this language to communicate with horses. In order to promulgate his methods, Roberts has authored a number of books including his original best-seller, The Man Who Listens to Horses, and regularly tours with a live demonstration. He runs an Equestrian Academy in Solvang, California and an \\"online university\\" to promote his ideas. Early life Monty Roberts was born in Salinas, California and is the son of horse trainer Marvin E Roberts, who authored his own self-published book called \\"Horse and Horseman Training\\" in 1957. Roberts claims that his father also beat him as a child, although other family members, including his younger brother Larry, dispute this version of events, with his aunt and cousin, Joyce Renebome and Debra Ristau, specifically refuting the allegation in the book Horse Whispers & Lies. Roberts competed in rodeo and won his first trophy at the age of four.Cal Poly Magazine, Spring 1998 He attended California Polytechnic State University, San Luis Obispo (\\"Cal Poly\\") and riding for their rodeo team, he won 2 National Intercollegiate Rodeo Association (NIRA) National Championships, including National NIRA Champion Bulldogger in 1957, the NIRA Champion Team Roping in 1956. He graduated from Cal Poly in 1959 with a degree in Animal Science. Roberts describes in his books and web site how he was sent to Nevada at the age of 13 in order to round up horses for the Salinas Rodeo Association‚Äôs Wild Horse Race, and there began observing mustangs interact with each other. He writes that he realized that they used a discernible, effective and predictable body language to communicate, set boundaries, show fear and express annoyance, relaxation or affection, and that he came to understand that utilizing this silent language would allow training to commence in a much more effective and humane manner, encouraging true partnership between horses and humans.Roberts, Monty. The Man Who Listens to Horses, p.231. Alfred A Knopf Canada, 1997. . Roberts describes this language as Equus, and refers to this frequently in his books, tours and other materials. Career Books Roberts' first book, The Man Who Listens to Horses was published in 1996 and is autobiographical. It spent 58 weeks on the New York Times Bestsellers list, and was subsequently translated into more than 15 languages, selling more than five million copies worldwide. Roberts has authored a number of further books, including best-selling Shy Boy: The Horse That Came in from the Wild (1999),Roberts, Monty and Christopher Dydyk.

Today, Roberts travels around the world, demonstrating his method of horse training to paying audiences, all well as volunteering time for audiences such as incarcerated youth in juvenile detention facilities. An event that would change the direction of his life was an invitation in 1989 from the offices of Queen Elizabeth II of the United Kingdom and an avid horsewoman. She had heard about Roberts' work and invited him to come to her country and show her staff his \\"Join Up\\" method. After watching his demonstration, Roberts claims that the Queen urged him to write a book about his nonviolent horse-training methods. That book became The Man Who Listens to Horses. Monty Roberts also teaches his techniques to students at his Equestrian Academy in Solvang, California and acts as a consultant at schools with disciplinary issues in the UK and the US,ABC Nightline, The Horse Whisperer, Oct. 19, 2005. and advises executives at Fortune 500 companies.Monty Roberts Inc. corporate events. He also runs the \\"Equus Online University\\" to promote his ideas. Television Three documentaries on Roberts have been released. The first was the 1997 documentary BBC/PBS Monty Roberts: The Real Horse Whisperer. It showed Roberts as he set out to tame a wild mustang without enclosures, and his developing relationship with the horse later known as Shy Boy. Other documentaries include the 1999 film Shy Boy: The Horse That Came in from the Wild and a 2005 documentary2005 Documentary, ABC News. on Roberts' work with wild horses and another about his work with aboriginal youth on Palm Island, Australia. In 2006, a DVD series with 17 episodes, named A Backstage Pass! was completed and broadcast in the UK. The series has also been broadcast in the US on the HRTV cable channel. He has his own show on Horse & Country TV, Backstage Pass with Monty Roberts. Awards In 2002, Roberts received an honorary doctorate in animal psychology from the University of Zurich in Switzerland and in 2005 he gained an honorary doctorate in animal psychology from the University of Parma in Italy. In 2004, the Girl Scouts of the USA commissioned a special Join-Up badge and training program in honor of Roberts‚Äô work, and in 2005, he became the first foreign-born and first American to receive the German Silbernes Pferd (Silver Horse) Award for outstanding contributions to promoting the love of horses. In the Dec. 2008 issue of Your Horse, a major British equestrian magazine, readers named Monty Roberts Personality of the Year 2008. In 1966 he assisted in the founding of Flag Is Up Farms, of which he is now the full owner. From 1973 to 1986, he was a leading consignor to the Hollywood Park Two-Year-Old Thoroughbreds in Training Sale. In 2004, Roberts‚Äô German-bred horse Sabiango won major races throughout the US. In 2002 Roberts again visited Windsor Castle as part of the Queen's Golden Jubilee. Roberts was appointed an Honorary Member of the Royal Victorian Order (MVO) in the 2011 Birthday Honours. In June 2012, the Queen, as Patron of Join‚ÄìUp International, attended the Guards Polo Club and along with Monty Roberts presented awards to international polo trainers from South and Central America in recognition of their work in promoting the non‚Äìviolent training of horses. Controversies Roberts strongly disagrees with his father's training methods, which he describes as \\"almost torturing the animals into submission\\". However, the senior Roberts' book, on page 55, also describes some training methods similar to the \\"Join-up\\" technique, and blogger John Dolan has noted other parallels between the training methods of father and son. Roberts and Bartell/Dolan have a long-running feud. In 2000 WIPO ruled against Bartell, who had registered www.montyroberts.org, saying he had \\"engaged in abusive registration\\" and transferred ownership to Roberts. Prior to this judgement, Roberts alleges that Bartell attempted to blackmail him for $90,000 to transfer the domain name.  Publications  * Roberts, Monty. The Man Who Listens to Horses.

Some prominent works of philosopher Hans Jonas are devoted to ethics of technology. The subject has also been explored, following the work of Mario Bunge, under the term technoethics. Ethics in technology has become an evolving topic over the years as technology has development. This article will walk through what technoethics is, the different types of technoethics within application areas, the history of technoethics, general ethical challenges, current technoethical issues, recent and future developments, and future considerations of technoethics. This article discusses many different topics and types of technology that is currently in use within our society and discusses the ethical implication of each of these technologies. Technoethics Technoethics (TE) is an interdisciplinary research area that draws on theories and methods from multiple knowledge domains (such as communications, social sciences information studies, technology studies, applied ethics, and philosophy) to provide insights on ethical dimensions of technological systems and practices for advancing a technological society. Technoethics views technology and ethics as socially embedded enterprises and focuses on discovering the ethical use of technology, protecting against the misuse of technology, and devising common principles to guide new advances in technological development and application to benefit society. Typically, scholars in technoethics have a tendency to conceptualize technology and ethics as interconnected and embedded in life and society. Technoethics denotes a broad range of ethical issues revolving around technology ‚Äì from specific areas of focus affecting professionals working with technology to broader social, ethical, and legal issues concerning the role of technology in society and everyday life. Technoethical perspectives are constantly in transition as technology advances in areas unseen by creators and as users change the intended uses of new technologies. Humans cannot be separated from these technologies because it is an inherent part of consciousness and meaning in life. The short term and longer term ethical considerations for technologies engage the creator, producer, user, and governments. With technology continuing to advance over time, there are now new Technoethics issues that come into play. For instance, discussions on genetically modified organisms (GMOs) have brought about a huge concern for technology, ethics, and safety. There is also a huge question of whether or not artificial intelligence (AI) should be trusted and relied upon. These are just some examples of how the advancements in technology will affect the ethical values of humans in the future. Definitions Using theories and methods from multiple domains, technoethics provides insights on ethical aspects of technological systems and practices, examines technology-related social policies and interventions, and provides guidelines for how to ethically use new advancements in technology.Luppicini, R. (2010). Technoethics and the evolving knowledge society. Hershey: Idea Group Publishing. Technoethics provides a systems theory and methodology to guide a variety of separate areas of inquiry into human-technological activity and ethics. Moreover, the field unites both technocentric and bio-centric philosophies, providing \\"conceptual grounding to clarify the role of technology to those affected by it and to help guide ethical problem solving and decision making in areas of activity that rely on technology.\\" As a bio- techno-centric field, technoethics \\"has a relational orientation to both technology and human activity\\"; it provides \\"a system of ethical reference that justifies that profound dimension of technology as a central element in the attainment of a 'finalized' perfection of man.' *Ethics address the issues of what is 'right', what is 'just', and what is 'fair'. Ethics describe moral principles influencing conduct; accordingly, the study of ethics focuses on the actions and values of people in society (what people do and how they believe they should act in the world). *Technology is the branch of knowledge that deals with the creation and use of technical means and their interrelation with life, society, and the environment; it may draw upon a variety of fields, including industrial arts, engineering, applied science, and pure science.English encyclopaedia, 2010 Technology \\"is core to human development and a key focus for understanding human life, society and human consciousness.\\" Fundamental Problems Technology is merely a tool like a device or gadget. With this thought process of technology just being a device or gadget, it is not possible for technology to posses a moral or ethical quality. With this thought process the tool maker or end user would be the one who decides the morality or ethicality behind a device or gadget. \\"Ethics of technology\\" refers to two basic subdivisions:- *The ethics involved in the development of new technology‚Äîwhether it is always, never, or contextually right or wrong to invent and implement a technological innovation. *The ethical questions that are exacerbated by the ways in which technology extends or curtails the power of individuals‚Äîhow standard ethical questions are changed by the new powers. In the former case, ethics of such things as computer security and computer viruses asks whether the very act of innovation is an ethically right or wrong act. Similarly, does a scientist have an ethical obligation to produce or fail to produce a nuclear weapon? What are the ethical questions surrounding the production of technologies that waste or conserve energy and resources? What are the ethical questions surrounding the production of new manufacturing processes that might inhibit employment, or might inflict suffering in the third world? In the latter case, the ethics of technology quickly break down into the ethics of various human endeavors as they are altered by new technologies. For example, bioethics is now largely consumed with questions that have been exacerbated by the new life-preserving technologies, new cloning technologies, and new technologies for implantation. In law, the right of privacy is being continually attenuated by the emergence of new forms of surveillance and anonymity. The old ethical questions of privacy and free speech are given new shape and urgency in an Internet age. Such tracing devices as RFID, biometric analysis and identification, genetic screening, all take old ethical questions and amplify their significance. History of Technoethics Though the ethical consequences of new technologies have existed since Socrates' attack on writing in Plato's dialogue, Phaedrus, the formal field of technoethics had only existed for a few decades. The first traces of TE can be seen in Dewey and Peirce's pragmatism. With the advent of the industrial revolution, it was easy to see that technological advances were going to influence human activity. This is why they put emphasis on the responsible use of technology. The term \\"technoethics\\" was coined in 1977 by the philosopher Mario Bunge to describe the responsibilities of technologists and scientists to develop ethics as a branch of technology. Bunge argued that the current state of technological progress was guided by ungrounded practices based on limited empirical evidence and trial-and-error learning. He recognized that \\"the technologist must be held not only technically but also morally responsible for whatever he designs or executes: not only should his artifacts be optimally efficient but, far from being harmful, they should be beneficial, and not only in the short run but also in the long term.\\" He recognized a pressing need in society to create a new field called 'Technoethics' to discover rationally grounded rules for guiding science and technological progress. With the spurt in technological advances came technological inquiry. Societal views of technology were changing; people were becoming more critical of the developments that were occurring and scholars were emphasizing the need to understand and to take a deeper look and study the innovations. Associations were uniting scholars from different disciplines to study the various aspects of technology. The main disciplines being philosophy, social sciences and science and technology studies (STS). Though many technologies were already focused on ethics, each technology discipline was separated from each other, despite the potential for the information to intertwine and reinforce itself. As technologies became increasingly developed in each discipline, their ethical implications paralleled their development, and became increasingly complex. Each branch eventually became united, under the term technoethics, so that all areas of technology could be studied and researched based on existing, real-world examples and a variety of knowledge, rather than just discipline-specific knowledge.  Technology and Ethics  Ethics theories Technoethics involves the ethical aspects of technology within a society that is shaped by technology. This brings up a series of social and ethical questions regarding new technological advancements and new boundary crossing opportunities. Before moving forward and attempting to address any ethical questions and concerns, it is important to review the three major ethical theories to develop a perspective foundation : *Utilitarianism (Bentham) is an ethical theory which attempts to maximize happiness and reduce suffering for the greatest number of people. Utilitarianism focused on results and consequences rather than rules. * Duty ethics (Kant) notes the obligations that one has to society and follows society's universal rules. It focuses on the rightness of actions instead of the consequences, focusing on what an individual should do. * Virtue ethics is another main perspective in normative ethics. It highlights the role and virtues that an individual's character contains to be able to determine or evaluate ethical behaviour in society. By practicing honing honest and generous behavior, Aristotle, the philosopher of this theory believes that people will then make the right choice when faced with an ethical decision. * Relationship ethics states that care and consideration are both derived from human communication. Therefore, ethical communication is the core substance to maintain healthy relationships. Historical framing of technology ‚Äì four main periods # Greek civilization defined technology as techn√©. Techn√© is \\"the set principles, or rational method, involved in the production of an object or the accomplishment of an end; the knowledge such as principles of method; art.\\" This conceptualization of technology used during the early Greek and Roman period to denote the mechanical arts, construction, and other efforts to create, in Cicero's words, a \\"second nature\\" within the natural world.Luppicini, R. (2008). The emerging field of Technoethics. In R. Luppicini and R. Adell (eds.). Handbook of Research on Technoethics. Hershey: Idea Group Publishing # Modern conceptualization of technology as invention materialized in the 17th century in Bacon's futuristic vision of a perfect society governed by engineers and scientists in Saloman's House, to raise the importance of technology in society. # The German term \\"Tecknik\\" was used in the 19th-20th century. Technik is the totality of processes, machines, tools and systems employed in the practical arts and Engineering. Webber popularized it when it was used in broader fields. Mumford said it was underlying a civilization. Known as: before 1750: Eotechnic, in 1750-1890: Paleoethnic and in 1890: Neoethnic. Place it at the center of social life in close connection to social progress and societal change. Mumford says that a machine cannot be divorced from its larger social pattern, for it is the pattern that gives it meaning and purpose. # Rapid advances in technology provoked a negative reaction from scholars who saw technology as a controlling force in society with the potential to destroy how people live (Technological Determinism). Heidegger warned people that technology was dangerous in that it exerted control over people through its mediating effects, thus limiting authenticity of experience in the world that defines life and gives life meaning. It is an intimate part of the human condition, deeply entrenched in all human history, society and mind. Significant technoethical developments in society Many advancements within the past decades have added to the field of technoethics. There are multiple concrete examples that have illustrated the need to consider ethical dilemmas in relation to technological innovations. Beginning in the 1940s influenced by the British eugenic movement, the Nazis conduct \\"racial hygiene\\" experiments causing widespread, global anti-eugenic sentiment. In the 1950s the first satellite Sputnik 1 orbited the earth, the Obninsk Nuclear Power Plant was the first nuclear power plant to be opened, the American nuclear tests take place. The 1960s brought about the first manned moon landing, ARPANET created which leads to the later creation of the Internet, first heart transplantation completed, and the Telstar communications satellite is launched. The 70s, 80s, 90s, 2000s and 2010s also brought multiple developments. Technological consciousness Technological consciousness is the relationship between humans and technology. Technology is seen as an integral component of human consciousness and development. Technology, consciousness and society are intertwined in a relational process of creation that is key to human evolution. Technology is rooted in the human mind, and is made manifest in the world in the form of new understandings and artifacts. The process of technological consciousness frames the inquiry into ethical responsibility concerning technology by grounding technology in human life. The structure of technological consciousness is relational but also situational, organizational, aspectual and integrative. Technological consciousness situates new understandings by creating a context of time and space. As well, technological consciousness organizes disjointed sequences of experience under a sense of unity that allows for a continuity of experience. The aspectual component of technological consciousness recognizes that individuals can only be conscious of aspects of an experience, not the whole thing. For this reason, technology manifests itself in processes that can be shared with others. The integrative characteristics of technological consciousness are assimilation, substitution and conversation. Assimilation allows for unfamiliar experiences to be integrated with familiar ones. Substitution is a metaphorical process allowing for complex experiences to be codified and shared with others ‚Äî for example, language. Conversation is the sense of an observer within an individual's consciousness, providing stability and a standpoint from which to interact with the process. Misunderstandings of consciousness and technology According to Rocci Luppicini, the common misunderstandings about consciousness and technology are listed as follows. The first misunderstanding is that consciousness is only in the head when according to Luppicini, consciousness is not only in the head meaning that \\"[c]onsciousness is responsible for the creation of new conscious relations wherever imagined, be it in the head, on the street or in the past.\\" The second misunderstanding is technology is not a part of consciousness. Technology is a part of consciousness as \\"the conceptualization of technology has gone through drastic changes.\\" The third misunderstanding is that technology controls society and consciousness, by which Luppicini means \\"that technology is rooted in consciousness as an integral part of mental life for everyone. This understanding will most likely alter how both patients and psychologists deal with the trials and tribunes of living with technology.\\" The last misunderstanding is society controls technology and consciousness. \\"‚Ä¶(other) accounts fail to acknowledge the complex relational nature of technology as an operation within mind and society. This realization shifts the focus on technology to its origins within the human mind as explained through the theory of technological consciousness.\\" *Consciousness (C) is only a part of the head: C is responsible for the creation of new conscious relations *Technology (T) is not part of C: Humans cannot be separated from technology *T controls society and C: Technology cannot control the mind *Society controls T and C: Society fails to take in account the consideration of society shaping what technology gets developed?  Types of Technology Ethics  Technology ethics are principles that can be used to govern technology including factors like risk management and individual rights. They are basically used to understand and resolve moral issues that have to do with the development and application of technology of different types. There are many types of technology ethics: * Access rights: access to empowering technology as a right * Accountability: decisions made for who is responsible when considering success or harm in technological advancements * Digital Rights: protecting intellectual property rights and privacy rights * Environment: how to produce technology that could harm the environment * Existential Risk: technologies that represent a threat to the global quality of life pertaining to extinction * Freedom: technology that is used to control a society raising questions related to freedom and independence * Health & Safety: health and safety risks that are increased and imposed by technologies * Human Enhancement: human genetic engineering and human-machine integration * Human Judgement: when can decisions be judged by automation and when do they acquire a reasonable human? * Over-Automation: when does automation decrease quality of life and start affecting society? * Precaution Principle: Who decides that developing this new technology is safe for the world? * Privacy: protection of privacy rights * Security: Is due diligence required to ensure information security? * Self Replicating Technology: should self replicating be the norm? * Technology Transparency: clearly explaining how a technology works and what its intentions are * Terms of Service: ethics related to legal agreements Ethical challenges Ethical challenges arise in many different situations: *Human knowledge processes *Workplace discrimination *Strained work life balance in technologically enhanced work environments: Many people find that simply having the technology to allow you to do work while at home increases stress levels. In a recent study 70% of respondents said that since technology, work has creeped into their personal lives. Since so many people have found this to be an issue, it is very important to find that medium. For instance, by not answering non- urgent work matters over the weekends or on holiday, unless an urgent matter. In order to reach the ethical portion of having technology in the work place, it is vital to keep work and personal life separate, again unless an urgent matter. *digital divide: Inequalities in information access for parts of the population *Unequal opportunities for scientific and technological development * Norris says access to information and knowledge resources within a knowledge society tend to favour the economically privileged who have greater access to technological tools needed to access information and knowledge resources disseminated online and the privatization of knowledge * Inequality in terms of how scientific and technological knowledge is developed around the globe. Developing countries do not have the same opportunities as developed countries to invest in costly large-scale research and expensive research facilities and instrumentation *Organizational responsibility and accountability issues *Intellectual property issues: When is comes to intellectual property in order to ethically own something it must be represented on a tangible device such as putting a design on paper. By copying someone else's design you are taking away someone else's design which is unethical. * Information overload: Information processing theory is working memory that has a limited capacity and too much information can lead to cognitive overload resulting in loss of information from short term memory * Limit an organization's ability to innovate and respond for change * Knowledge society is intertwined with changing technology requiring new skills of its workforce. Cutler says that there is the perception that older workers lack experience with new technology and that retaining programs may be less effective and more expensive for older workers. Cascio says that there is a growth of virtual organizations. Saetre & Sornes say that it is a blurring of the traditional time and space boundaries has also led to many cases in the blurring of work and personal life * Negative impacts of many scientific and technological innovations have on humans and the environment has led to some skepticism and resistance to increasing dependence on technology within the Knowledge Society. Doucet calls for city empowerment to have the courage and foresight to make decisions that are acceptable to its inhabitants rather that succumb to global consumer capitalism and the forces of international corporations on national and local governments * Scientific and technological innovations that have transformed organizational life within a global economy have also supplanted human autonomy and control in work within a technologically oriented workplace *The persuasive potential of technology raises the question of \\"how sensitive ... designers and programmers [should] be to the ethics of the persuasive technology they design.\\"Berdichevsky, D. & Neunschwander, E. (n.d.). Lesson #2: Ethics of Persuasive Technology. Retrieved from http://e-ethics.awardspace.com/e-ethics_id_L2.php Technoethics can be used to determine the level of ethical responsibility that should be associated with outcomes of the use of technology, whether intended or unintended * Rapidly changing organizational life and the history of unethical business practices have given rise to public debates concerning organizational responsibility and trust. The advent of virtual organizations and telework has bolstered ethical problems by providing more opportunities for fraudulent behaviour and the production of misinformation. Concerted efforts are required to uphold ethical values in advancing new knowledge and tools within societal relations which do not exclude people or limit liberties of some people at the expense of others *Artificial Intelligence: Artificial Intelligence seems to be the one of the most talked of challenges when it comes ethics. In order to avoid these ethical challenges some solutions have been established; first and for most it should be developed for the common good and benefit of humanity. Secondly, it should operate on principles of intelligibility and fairness. It should also not be used to diminish the data rights or privacy of individuals, families, or communities. It is also believed that all citizens should have the right to be educated on artificial intelligence in order to be able to understand it. Finally, the autonomous power to hurt, destroy, or deceive humans should never be vested in artificial intelligence. Current issues =Copyright= Digital copyrights are a complicated issue because there are multiple sides to the discussion. There are ethical considerations surrounding the artist, producer, and end user. Not to mention the relationships with other countries and the impact on the use of content housed in their countries. In Canada, national laws such as the Copyright Act and the history behind Bill C-32 are just the beginning of the government's attempt to shape the \\"wild west\\" of Canadian Internet activities. The ethical considerations behind Internet activities such a peer-to-peer file sharing involve every layer of the discussion ‚Äì the consumer, artist, producer, music/movie/software industry, national government, and international relations. Overall, technoethics forces the \\"big picture\\" approach to all discussions on technology in society. Although time consuming, this \\"big picture\\" approach offers some level of reassurance when considering that any law put in place could drastically alter the way we interact with our technology and thus the direction of work and innovation in the country. The use of copyrighted material to create new content is a hotly debated topic. The emergence of the musical \\"mashup\\" genre has compounded the issue of creative licensing. A moral conflict is created between those who believe that copyright protects any unauthorized use of content, and those who maintain that sampling and mash-ups are acceptable musical styles and, though they use portions of copyrighted material, the end result is a new creative piece which is the property of the creator, and not of the original copyright holder. Whether or not the mashup genre should be allowed to use portions of copyrighted material to create new content is one which is currently under debate. =Cybercriminality= For many years , new technologies took an important place in social, cultural, political, and economic life. Thanks to the democratization of informatics access and the network's globalization, the number of exchanges and transaction is in perpetual progress. Many people are exploiting the facilities and anonymity that modern technologies offer in order to commit multiple criminal activities. Cybercrime is one of the fastest growing areas of crime. The problem is that some laws that profess to protect people from those who would do wrong things via digital means also threaten to take away people's freedom. =Privacy vs. security: Full-body airport scanners= Since the introduction of full body X-ray scanners to airports in 2007, many concerns over traveler privacy have arisen. Individuals are asked to step inside a rectangular machine that takes an alternate wavelength image of the person's naked body for the purpose of detecting metal and non-metal objects being carried under the clothes of the traveler. This screening technology comes in two forms, millimeter wave technology (MM-wave technology) or backscatter X-rays (similar to x-rays used by dentists). Full-body scanners were introduced into airports to increase security and improve the quality of screening for objects such as weapons or explosives due to an increase of terrorist attacks involving airplanes occurring in the early 2000s. Ethical concerns of both travelers and academic groups include fear of humiliation due to the disclosure of anatomic or medical details, exposure to a low level of radiation (in the case of backscatter X-ray technology), violation of modesty and personal privacy, clarity of operating procedures, the use of this technology to discriminate against groups, and potential misuse of this technology for reasons other than detecting concealed objects. Also people with religious beliefs that require them to remain physically covered (arms, legs, face etc.) at all times will be unable and morally opposed to stepping inside of this virtually intrusive scanning technology. The Centre for Society, Science and Citizenship have discussed their ethical concerns including the ones mentioned above and suggest recommendations for the use of this technology in their report titled \\"Whole Body Imaging at airport checkpoints: the ethical and policy context\\" (2010). =Privacy and GPS technologies= The discourse around GPS tracking devices and geolocation technologies and this contemporary technology's ethical ramifications on privacy is growing as the technology becomes more prevalent in society. As discussed in the New York Times's Sunday Review on September 22, 2012, the editorial focused on the ethical ramifications that imprisoned a drug offender because of the GPS technology in his cellphone was able to locate the criminal's position. Now that most people carry on the person a cell, the authorities have the ability to constantly know the location of a large majority of citizens. The ethical discussion now can be framed from a legal perspective. As raised in the editorial, there are stark infractions that these geolocation devices on citizens' Fourth Amendment and their protection against unreasonable searches. This reach of this issue is not just limited to the United States but affects more democratic state that uphold similar citizens' rights and freedoms against unreasonable searches. These geolocation technologies are not only affecting how citizens interact with their state but also how employees interact with their workplaces. As discussed in article by the Canadian Broadcasting Company, \\"GPS and privacy\\", that a growing number of employers are installing geolocation technologies in \\"company vehicles, equipment and cellphones\\" (Hein, 2007). Both academia and unions are finding these new powers of employers to be indirect contradiction with civil liberties. This changing relationship between employee and employer because of the integration of GPS technology into popular society is demonstrating a larger ethical discussion on what are appropriate privacy levels. This discussion will only become more prevalent as the technology becomes more popular. =Genetically modified organisms= Genetically modified foods have become quite common in developed countries around the world, boasting greater yields, higher nutritional value, and greater resistance to pests, but there are still many ethical concerns regarding their use. Even commonplace genetically modified crops like corn raise questions of the ecological consequences of unintended cross pollination, potential horizontal gene transfer, and other unforeseen health concerns for humans and animals.Daniel A. Vallero, Environmental Biotechnology: A Biosystems Approach, Academic Press, Amsterdam, NV; ; 2010. Trademarked organisms like the \\"Glofish\\" are a relatively new occurrence. These zebrafish, genetically modified to appear in several fluorescent colours and sold as pets in the United States, could have unforeseen effects on freshwater environments were they ever to breed in the wild. Providing they receive approval from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA), another new type of fish may be arriving soon. The \\"AquAdvantage salmon\\", engineered to reach maturity within roughly 18 months (as opposed to three years in the wild), could help meet growing global demand. There are health and environmental concerns associated with the introduction any new GMO, but more importantly this scenario highlights the potential economic impact a new product may have. The FDA does perform an economic impact analysis to weigh, for example, the consequences these new genetically modified fish may have on the traditional salmon fishing industry against the long term gain of a cheaper, more plentiful source of salmon. These technoethical assessments, which regulatory organizations like the FDA are increasingly faced with worldwide, are vitally important in determining how GMOs‚Äîwith all of their potential beneficial and harmful effects‚Äîwill be handled moving forward. =Pregnancy screening technology= For over 40 years, newborn screening has been a triumph of the 20th century public health system. Through this technology, millions of parents are given the opportunity to screen for and test a number of disorders, sparing the death of their children or complications such as mental retardation. However, this technology is growing at a fast pace, disallowing researchers and practitioners from being able to fully understand how to treat diseases and provide families in need with the resources to cope. A version of pre-natal testing, called tandem mass spectrometry, is a procedure that \\"measures levels and patterns of numerous metabolites in a single drop of blood, which are then used to identify potential diseases. Using this same drop of blood, tandem mass spectrometry enables the detection of at least four times the number of disorders than was possible with previous technologies.\\" This allows for a cost-effective and fast method of pre-natal testing. However, critics of tandem mass spectrometry and technologies like it are concerned about the adverse consequences of expanding newborn screen technology and the lack of appropriate research and infrastructure needed to provide optimum medical services to patients. Further concerns include \\"diagnostic odysseys\\", a situation in which the patient aimlessly continues to search for diagnoses where none exists. Among other consequences, this technology raises the issue of whether individuals other than newborn will benefit from newborn screening practices. A reconceptualization of the purpose of this screening will have far reaching economic, health and legal impact. This discussion is only just beginning and requires informed citizenry to reach legal if not moral consensus on how far we as a society are comfortable with taking this technology. =Citizen journalism= Citizen journalism is a concept describing citizens who wish to act as a professional journalist or media person by \\"collecting, reporting, analyzing, and disseminating news and information\\" According to Jay Rosen, citizen journalists are \\"the people formerly known as the audience,\\" who \\"were on the receiving end of a media system that ran one way, in a broadcasting pattern, with high entry fees and a few firms competing to speak very loudly while the rest of the population listened in isolation from one another‚Äî and who today are not in a situation like that at all. ... The people formerly known as the audience are simply the public made realer, less fictional, more able, less predictable\\". The internet has provided society with a modern and accessible public space. Due to the openness of the internet, there are discernible effects on the traditional profession of journalism. Although the concept of citizen journalism is a seasoned one, \\"the presence of online citizen journalism content in the marketplace may add to the diversity of information that citizens have access to when making decisions related to the betterment of their community or their life\\". The emergence of online citizen journalism is fueled by the growing use of social media websites to share information about current events and issues locally, nationally and internationally. The open and instantaneous nature of the internet affects the criteria of information quality on the web. A journalistic code of ethics is not instilled for those who are practicing citizen journalism. Journalists, whether professional or citizen, have needed to adapt to new priorities of current audiences: accessibility, quantity of information, quick delivery and aesthetic appeal. Thus, technology has affected the ethical code of the profession of journalism with the popular free and instant sharing qualities of the internet. Professional journalists have had to adapt to these new practices to ensure that truthful and quality reporting is being distributed. The concept can be seen as a great advancement in how society communicates freely and openly or can be seen as contributing to the decay of traditional journalistic practices and codes of ethics. Other issues to consider: *Privacy concerns: location services on cell devices which tell all users where a person is should they decide to turn on this feature, social media, online banking, new capabilities of cellular devices, Wi-fi, etc. * New music technology: People see more electronic music today with the new technology able to create it, as well as more advanced recording technology Recent developments Despite the amassing body of scholarly work related to technoethics beginning in the 1970s, only recently has it become institutionalized and recognized as an important interdisciplinary research area and field of study. In 1998, the Epson Foundation founded the Instituto de Tecno√©tica in Spain under the direction of Josep Esquirol. This institute has actively promoted technoethical scholarship through awards, conferences, and publications. This helped encourage scholarly work for a largely European audience. The major driver for the emergence of technoethics can be attributed to the publication of major reference works available in English and circulated globally. The \\"Encyclopedia of Science, Technology, and Ethics\\" included a section on technoethics which helped bring it into mainstream philosophy. This helped to raise further interest leading to the publication of the first reference volume in the English language dedicated to the emerging field of Technoethics. The two volume Handbook of Research on Technoethics explores the complex connections between ethics and the rise of new technologies (e.g., life-preserving technologies, stem cell research, cloning technologies, new forms of surveillance and anonymity, computer networks, Internet advancement, etc.) This recent major collection provides the first comprehensive examination of technoethics and its various branches from over 50 scholars around the globe. The emergence of technoethics can be juxtaposed with a number of other innovative interdisciplinary areas of scholarship which have surfaced in recent years such as technoscience and technocriticism.Luppicini, R., & Adell, R. (eds.) (2008). Handbook of Research on Technoethics. Hershey: Idea Group Publishing. With all the developments we've had in technology it has created a lot advancement for the music industry both positive and negative. A main concern is piracy and illegal downloading; with all that is available through the internet a lot of music (TV shows and movies as well) have become easily accessible to download and upload for free. This does create new challenges for artist, producers, and copyright laws. The advances it has positively made for the industry is a whole new genre of music. Computers are being used to create electronic music, as well as synthesizers (computerized/electronic piano). This type of music is becoming rapidly more common and listened to. These advances have allowed the industry to try new things and make new explorations. Future developments The future of technoethics is a promising, yet evolving field. The studies of e-technology in workplace environments are an evolving trend in technoethics. With the constant evolution of technology, and innovations coming out daily, technoethics is looking to be a rather promising guiding framework for the ethical assessments of new technologies. Some of the questions regarding technoethics and the workplace environment that have yet to be examined and treated are listed below: * Are organizational counter measures not necessary because it invades employee privacy? * Are surveillance cameras and computer monitoring devices invasive methods that can have ethical repercussions? * Should organizations have the right and power to impose consequences? =UNESCO= UNESCO ‚Äì a specialized intergovernmental agency of the United Nations, focusing on promotion of education, culture social and natural sciences and communication and information. In the future, the use of principles as expressed in the UNESCO Universal Declaration on Bioethics and Human Rights (2005) will also be analyzed to broaden the description of bioethical reasoning (Adell & Luppicini, 2009). = User data = In a digital world, much of users' personal lives are stored on devices such as computers and smartphones, and we trust the companies we store our lives on to take care of our data. A topic of discussion regarding the ethics of technology is just exactly how much data these companies really need and what they are doing with it. Another major cause for concern is the security of our personal data and privacy, whether it is leaked intentionally or not. Large companies share their users' data constantly. In 2018, the U.S, government cracked down on Facebook selling user data to other companies after declaring that it had made the data in question inaccessible. One such case was in a scandal regarding Cambridge Analytica, in which Facebook sold user data to the company without consent from the users whose data was being accessed. The data was then used for several political agendas, such as the Brexit vote and the U.S. Presidential Election of 2016. In an interview with CBS' 60 Minutes, Trump campaign manager Brad Parscale described in detail how he used data taken from different social media websites to create ads that were both visually appealing to potential voters and targeted the issues that they felt strongest about. Besides swinging political races, the theft of people's data can result in serious consequences on an individual level. In some cases, hackers can breach websites or businesses that have identifying information about a person, such as their credit card number, cell phone number, and address, and upload it to the dark web for sale, if they decide not to use it for their own deviant purposes. = Drones = In the book Society and Technological Change, 8th Edition, by Rudi Volti, the author comments on unmanned aerial vehicles, also known as UAVs or drones. Once used primarily as military technology, these are becoming increasingly accessible tools to the common person for hobbies like photography. In the author's belief, this can also cause concern for security and privacy, as these tools allow people with malicious intents easier access to spying. Outside of public areas, drones are also able to be used for spying on people in private settings, even in their own homes. In an article by today.com, the author writes about people using drones and taking videos and photographs of people in their most private moments, even in the privacy of their own home. Pet Cloning In 2020 pet cloning is to become something of interest for those who can afford it. For $25k - $50k anyone will be able to clone their house pet but there is no guarantee you will get the exact same pet that you once had. This may seem very appealing to certain animal-lovers, but what about all of those animals that already have no home? There are a few different ethical questions here; the first being how is this fair to the animals that are suffering out in the wilderness with no home? The second being that cloning animals is not only for pets, but for all animals in general. Maybe people are concerned that people are going to clone animals for food purposes. Another question about animal cloning is it is good for the welfare of the animal or will the radiation and other procedural aspects cause the animals life to end earlier? These are just some of many concerns people have with animal cloning. Areas of Technoethical Inquiry Biotech ethics Biotech ethics concerned with ethical dilemmas surrounding the use of biotechnologies in fields including medical research, health care, and industrial applications. Topics such as cloning ethics, e-health ethics, telemedicine ethics, genetics ethics, neuroethics, and sport and nutrition ethics fall into this category; examples of specific issues include the debates surrounding euthanasia and reproductive rights. Technoethics and cognition This area of technoethical inquiry is concerned with technology's relation to the human mind, artificial agents, and society. Topics of study that would fit into this category would be artificial morality and moral agents, technoethical systems and techno-addiction. * An artificial agent describes any type of technology that is created to act as an agent, either of its own power or on behalf of another agent. An artificial agent may try to advance its own goals or those of another agent.Sullins, J. P. (2008). Artificial moral agency in technoethics. In R. Luppicini & R. Adell (Eds.), Handbook of research on technoethics (pp. 205-221). Hershey: Idea Group Publishing. Technoethics and society This field is concerned with the uses of technology to ethically regulate aspects of a society. For example: digital property ethics, social theory, law, science, organizational ethics and global ethics. Technofeminism Technoethics has concerned itself with society as a general group and made no distinctions between the genders, but considers technological effects and influences on each gender individually. This is an important consideration as some technologies are created for use by a specific gender, including birth control, abortion, fertility treatments, and Viagra. Feminists have had a significant influence on the prominence and development of reproductive technologies. Technoethical inquiry must examine these technologies' effects on the intended gender while also considering their influence on the other gender. Another dimension of technofeminism concerns female involvement in technological development: women's participation in the field of technology has broadened society's understanding of how technology affects the female experience in society. Information and communication technoethics Information and communication technoethics is \\"concerned with ethical issues and responsibilities arising when dealing with information and communication technology in the realm of communication.\\" This field is related to internet ethics, rational and ethical decision making models, and information ethics. A major area of interest is the convergence of technologies: as technologies become more interdependent and provide people with multiple ways of accessing the same information, they transform society and create new ethical dilemmas. This is particularly evident in the realms of the internet. In recent years, users have had the unprecedented position of power in creating and disseminating news and other information globally via social networking; the concept of \\"citizen journalism\\" primarily relates to this. With developments in the media, has led to open media ethics as Ward writes, leading to citizen journalism. In cases such as the 2004 Indian Ocean Tsunami or the 2011 Arab Spring movements, citizen journalists were seen to have been significant sources of facts and information in relation to the events. These were re-broadcast by news outlets, and more importantly, re- circulated by and to other internet users. As Jay David Bolter and Richard Grusin state in their book Remediation: Understanding New Media (1999): \\"The liveness of the Web is a refashioned version of the liveness of broadcast television\\" However, it is commonly political events (such as 'Occupy' movements or the Iran Elections of 2009) that tend to raise ethical questions and concerns. In the latter example, there had been efforts made by the Iranian government in censoring and prohibiting the spread of internal happenings to the outside by its citizen journalists. This occurrence questioned the importance of the spread of crucial information regarding the issue, and the source from which it came from (citizen journalists, government authorities, etc.). This goes to prove how the internet \\"enables new forms of human action and expression [but] at the same time it disables [it]\\"Bohme, G. (1997). The structures and prospects of knowledge society. Symposium: \\"Revisiting the theory of finalization in science\\", 36, 447-468 Information and Communication Technoethics also identifies ways to develop ethical frameworks of research structures in order to capture the essence of new technologies. Educational and professional technoethics Technoethical inquiry in the field of education examines how technology impacts the roles and values of education in society. This field considers changes in student values and behavior related to technology, including access to inappropriate material in schools, online plagiarism using material copied directly from the internet, or purchasing papers from online resources and passing them off as the student's own work. Educational technoethics also examines the digital divide that exists between educational institutions in developed and developing countries or between unequally-funded institutions within the same country: for instance, some schools offer students access to online material, while others do not. Professional technoethics focuses on the issue of ethical responsibility for those who work with technology within a professional setting, including engineers, medical professionals, and so on. Efforts have been made to delineate ethical principles in professions such as computer programming (see programming ethics). Environmental and engineering technoethics Environmental technoethics originate from the 1960s and 1970s' interest in environment and nature. The field focuses on the human use of technologies that may impact the environment; areas of concern include transport, mining, and sanitation. Engineering technoethics emerged in the late 19th century. As the Industrial Revolution triggered a demand for expertise in engineering and a need to improve engineering standards, societies began to develop codes of professional ethics and associations to enforce these codes. Ethical inquiry into engineering examines the \\"responsibilities of engineers combining insights from both philosophy and the social sciences.\\" Technoethical assessment and design A technoethical assessment (TEA) is an interdisciplinary, systems-based approach to assessing ethical dilemmas related to technology. TEAs aim to guide actions related to technology in an ethical direction by advancing knowledge of technologies and their effects; successful TEAs thus produce a shared understanding of knowledge, values, priorities, and other ethical aspects associated with technology. TEAs involve five key steps: # Evaluate the intended ends and possible side effects of the technology in order to discern its overall value (interest). # Compare the means and intended ends in terms of technical and non-technical (moral and social) aspects. # Reject those actions where the output (overall value) does not balance the input in terms of efficiency and fairness. # Consider perspectives from all stakeholder groups. # Examine technological relations at a variety of levels (e.g. biological, physical, psychological, social, and environmental). Technoethical design (TED) refers to the process of designing technologies in an ethical manner, involving stakeholders in participatory design efforts, revealing hidden or tacit technological relations, and investigating what technologies make possible and how people will use them. TED involves the following four steps: # Ensure that the components and relations within the technological system are explicitly understood by those in the design context. # Perform a TEA to identify relevant technical knowledge. # Optimize the technological system in order to meet stakeholders' and affected individuals' needs and interests. # Consult with representatives of stakeholder and affected groups in order to establish consensus on key design issues. Both TEA and TED rely on systems theory, a perspective that conceptualizes society in terms of events and occurrences resulting from investigating system operations. Systems theory assumes that complex ideas can be studied as systems with common designs and properties which can be further explained using systems methodology. The field of technoethics regards technologies as self-producing systems that draw upon external resources and maintain themselves through knowledge creation; these systems, of which humans are a part, are constantly in flux as relations between technology, nature, and society change. TEA attempts to elicit the knowledge, goals, inputs, and outputs that comprise technological systems. Similarly, TED enables designers to recognize technology's complexity and power, to include facts and values in their designs, and to contextualize technology in terms of what it makes possible and what makes it possible. Organizational Technoethics Recent advances in technology and their ability to transmit vast amounts of information in a short amount of time has changed the way information is being shared amongst co-workers and managers throughout organizations across the globe. Starting in the 1980s with information and communications technologies (ICTs), organizations have seen an increase in the amount of technology that they rely on to communicate within and outside of the workplace. However, these implementations of technology in the workplace create various ethical concerns and in turn a need for further analysis of technology in organizations. As a result of this growing trend, a subsection of technoethics known as organizational technoethics has emerged to address these issues. Key scholarly contributions Key scholarly contributions linking ethics, technology, and society can be found in a number of seminal works: * The Imperative of Responsibility: In Search of Ethics for the Technological Age (Hans Jonas, 1979). * On Technology, Medicine and Ethics (Hans Jonas, 1985). * The Real World of Technology (Franklin, 1990). * Thinking Ethics in Technology: Hennebach Lectures and Papers, 1995-1996 (Mitcham, 1997). * Technology and the Good Life (Higgs, Light & Strong, 2000). * Readings in the Philosophy of Technology (Kaplin, 2004). * Ethics and technology: Ethical issues in an age of information and communication technology (Tavani, 2004). This resulting scholarly attention to ethical issues arising from technological transformations of work and life has helped given rise to a number of key areas (or branches) of technoethical inquiry under various research programs (i.e., computer ethics, engineering ethics, environmental technoethics, biotech ethics, Nanoethics, educational technoethics, information and communication ethics, media ethics, and Internet ethics).

Brunvand is best known for popularizing the concept of the urban legend, a form of modern folklore or story telling. Urban Legends are \\"too good to be true\\" stories that travel by word of mouth, by print or the internet and are attributed to an FOAF: friend of a friend. \\"Urban Legends,\\" Brunvand says, \\"have a persistent hold on the imagination because they have an element of suspense or humor, they are plausible and they have a moral.\\" Though criticized for the \\"popular\\" rather than \\"academic\\" orientation of his book, The Vanishing Hitchhiker and others, Brunvand felt that it was a \\"natural and worthwhile part of his job as a folklorist to communicate the results of his research to the public.\\" For his lifetime dedication to the field of folklore, which included radio and television appearances, a syndicated newspaper column, and over 100 publications (articles, books, notes and reviews), Brunvand is considered to be \\"the legend scholar with the greatest influence on twentieth-century media.\\"Lindahl, Carl, \\"Some Legendary Takes on Hurricane Katrina\\", American Folklore Society, March 7, 2012  Biography  Brunvand was born on March 23, 1933, in Cadillac, Michigan, to Norwegian immigrants Harold N. Brunvand and Ruth Brunvand. He and his two siblings, Tor and Richard, were brought up in Lansing, Michigan. Brunvand graduated from Lansing Sexton High School, Lansing, Michigan in 1951. From high school, Brunvand attended Michigan State University, East Lansing, Michigan, where, in 1955, he earned a Bachelor of Arts degree in journalism. While at Michigan State, he served as second lieutenant in the signal corps. Brunvand went on to earn a Master of Arts degree in English from the same university in 1957. Academic career While attending Michigan State, Brunvand met Richard Dorson, a folklorist and professor, who became a mentor. Brunvand took an undergraduate American Folklore course Dorson offered in the fall quarter of 1954 and, in subsequent semesters, completed two of Dorson's graduate courses in folklore as a special enrollee. The work Brunvand and other classmates did for Dorson's classes included \\"preparing a large and well organized personal collection of folklore garnered from oral tradition and furnished with informant data and background comments.\\" These papers would later serve as the beginnings of a large archive of folklore housed at Indiana University. On June 10, 1956, Brunvand married Judith Darlene Ast, also a student at Michigan State University. Four days later, the couple left for Oslo, Norway, where Brunvand attended the University of Oslo on a Fulbright scholarship. He spent the year studying folklore. Brunvand's article, Norway's Askeladden the Unpromising Hero, and Junior-Right, published in the January‚ÄìMarch 1959 issue of the Journal of American Folklore was his first professional publication. In 1957, Brunvand returned to the United States as a graduate student at Indiana University, Bloomington, Indiana. He switched majors, from English to folklore, and took a series of classes offered through the university's summer institute. He worked as an archivist in the Indiana University Folklore Archives from September 1958 to June 1960. During this time, he met Archer Taylor, who, as a visiting professor, taught a course on proverbs and riddles. This course, according to Brunvand, \\"changed his life.\\" Proverbs became one of Brunvand's favorite topics to study and discuss. In 1961, Brunvand's A Dictionary of Proverbs and Proverbial Phrases from Books Published by Indiana Authors Before 1890 was published as Number 15 of the Indiana University's Folklore Series. Of the book, Brunvand says two things: \\"I've become better at choosing titles since then,\\" and \\"The price was $3.00, and it was worth every penny of it. Benjamin Radford and Jan Brunvand at the 2014 American Folklore Society conference in Santa Fe, New Mexico In 1961, Brunvand also received a Ph.D. in folklore from Indiana University. His dissertation, The Taming of the Shrew: A Comparative Study of Oral and Literary Versions (Aarne-Thompson type 901), later published by Routledge in 1991, highlighted his interest in the structure, morphology and typology of the folktale. Brunvand taught at the University of Idaho, Moscow, Idaho, from 1961 to 1965. He served as associate editor of the Journal of American Folklore from 1963 to 1967. In 1965, Brunvand taught for a year at Southern Illinois University, Edwardsville, Illinois, focusing on folktales, folklore and literature, before moving with his wife and four children to the University of Utah, Salt Lake City, Utah, where he remained a professor until his retirement in 1996. By 1967, Brunvand was a member of the Rocky Mountain Modern Language Association. He had also served as Book Review Editor for the Journal of American Folklore, which he resigned after receiving a Fulbright Scholarship research grant in 1970 to study folklore in Romania. He also won a Guggenheim Fellowship in the Humanities (Folklore and Popular Culture) that same year. Throughout the next decade, Brunvand focused his research on Romanian folklore, with a particular interest in Romanian house decoration. He returned to Romania in 1973-74 and again in 1981, receiving grants from the International Research & Exchanges Board (IREX) to continue his studies. His research would later be published in a single volume collection titled Casa Frumoasa: The House Beautiful in Rural Romania, published by East European Monographs in 2003. In 1968, The Study of American Folklore: An Introduction was published by W.W. Norton and Company. Brunvand received an Honorable Mention for this book in a 1969 Chicago Folklore Prize competition. The Chicago Folklore Prize is \\"supported by an endowment established by the International Folklore Association and is awarded annually by the University of Chicago for an important contribution to the study of folklore.\\" Brunvand's A Guide for Collectors of Folklore in Utah was published by Utah Publications in the American West in 1971. In the years 1973 to 1976, Brunvand, again, took on the role of associate editor for the Journal of American Folklore. He was named Folklore Fellow by the American Folklore Society in 1974 and was elected president of the organization in 1985. From 1977 to 1980, Brunvand served as editor of the Journal of American Folklore, with the goal of making the journal more readable and useful to its major audience, American folklorists. He widened the scope of the journal by including articles written by those outside folklore, but whose work was \\"relevant to that being done by professional folklorists.\\" He wanted to emphasize folklore and literature, folklore and history, folklife, festival and modern folklore. In 1976, Brunvand's book Folklore: A Study and Research Guide was published by St. Martin's Press. The book, intended for undergraduate folklore students, was a research tool with a bibliographic guide and tips for researching term papers. Brunvand edited two other textbooks: Readings in American Folklore, published by W.W. Norton and Company in 1979, American Folklore: An Encyclopedia, published by Garland in 1996. \\"Mr. Urban Legend\\" While teaching folklore at the University of Utah, Brunvand noticed a disconnect with his students and their views toward folklore. \\"They always seemed to think that folklore belonged to somebody else, usually in the past, that was something quaint and outdated.\\" He began asking his students to think about and discuss stories from their own lives. These stories helped form the basis of a collection which Brunvand later included in several popular books on the topic of urban legends. In 1981, Brunvand's first book devoted to urban legends was published. The Vanishing Hitchhiker: American Urban Legends and Their Meanings helped to popularize the topic for a student audience. Urban legends, Brunvand explains, are \\"kissing cousins of myths, fairy tales and rumors. Legends differ from rumors because the legends are stories, with a plot. And unlike myths and fairy tales, they are supposed to be current and true, events rooted in everyday reality that at least could happen.\\" Urban legends reflect modern- day societal concerns, hopes and fears, but are \\"weird whoppers we tell one another, believing them to be factual.\\" Over the next two decades, Brunvand added to the collection with \\"new\\" urban legends: The Choking Doberman and Other \\"New\\" Urban Legends, The Big Book of Urban Legends (which was formatted as a comic book), The Mexican Pet: More \\"New\\" Urban Legends, Curses! Broiled Again!, The Baby Train: And Other Lusty Urban Legends, Too Good to be True: The Colossal Book of Urban Legends, and The Truth Never Stands in the Way of a Good Story!. He made several appearances on Late Night with David Letterman and, in 1987, began a twice-weekly syndicated newspaper column called Urban Legends. He participated in countless radio talk shows and dozens of press interviews, educating people about this pass-along folk narrative that, typically involves people misunderstanding or making false assumptions about a story they heard. They forget details and fill in the gaps by inventing what they are missing to make sense of the story. Though criticized for the popular orientation of his books, Brunvand was dedicated to publicizing the field of folklore, exploring the roots of the stories, where possible, and, in some cases debunking them. \\"Folklorists fill different educational roles,\\" Brunvand told members of The Missouri Folklore Society in 2003, \\"sometimes in classrooms, but often in a more public forum. I believe that the public and media image of what a folklorist does is in fact part of what we should be doing, whether we were trained specifically for it or not, whether we work in academe or not, and whether we like it or not.\\" Brunvand and his books became so popular, that, when Richard Wolkomir dubbed him \\"Mr. Urban Legend\\" in an article for the Smithsonian, the title was later added to book jackets and other publicity. In an article for Western Folklore, Brunvand mentioned a notice he found on a computer newsgroup dated 1 March 1989, presumably an insider's joke: \\"I think Jan Harold Brunvand, alleged author of The Choking Doberman, is an urban legend. Has anybody ever actually seen this guy?\\" A Harvard Lampoon publication, Mediagate, parodied urban legend books with this fake publisher's notice: \\"Bookman Publishing's Catalog for Fall '87: The Embarrassing Fart and More New Urban Legends by Jan Harold Brunvand. Yet another set of rumors, tall tales, and fourth-hand hearsay compiled by the author of The Vanishing Hitchhiker. Includes more recent urban legends such as the Senile President, the Adulterous Evangelist, and the Smelly Gym Sock in the Big Mac. 233 pages hardbound. $34.95 (Harvard 1988: 229). Post- retirement career Brunvand retired from the University of Utah in 1996, but continued doing some research and writing as professor emeritus of English. Brunvand was a guest on National Public Radio's All Things Considered in September 1999. He spoke Noah Adams about his book Too Good to be True: The Colossal Book of Urban Legends. Jan Harold Brunvand trying on a pair of ski goggles on his 75th birthday His Encyclopedia of Urban Legends, illustrated by Randy Hickman, was published by ABC-CLIO in 2001. He gave the keynote address at the 2003 meeting of the Missouri Folklore Society. He was a speaker at the World Skeptics Congress in Italy in 2004. His is a fellow of the Committee for Skeptical Inquiry, formerly known as the Committee for the Scientific Investigation of Claims of the Paranormal. In 2003 Brunvand was awarded CSICOP's Distinguished Skeptic Award. Brunvand's book Be Afraid, Be Very Afraid: The Book of Scary Urban Legends was published in 2004 by W.W. Norton and Company. Personal In 2003, Brunvand entered the Trout Bum Tournament sponsored by Fly Rod and Reel. He participated in the Solo-Angler category. Known during the tournament as the Vanishing Fly Fisher (a nod to his book, The Vanishing Hitchhiker), Brunvand spent 10 days alone fishing some of his favorite spots in Utah: Mammoth Creek, Gooseberry Creek, Price River, and Antimony River (where he \\"fell twice and bashed his knee, though the injury wasn't anything a cold towel and a cold beer wouldn't fix\\"). \\"Day 10,\\" Jim Reilly wrote in an article describing the competition,\\" was the last we heard from Jan. We assume he made it home, but maybe he...vanished.\\" His favorite hobbies are fly fishing and skiing. He and his wife, Judith, continue to reside in Salt Lake City, Utah. Urban legend books The Vanishing Hitchhiker The Vanishing Hitchhiker: American Urban Legends and Their Meanings is a book intended to introduce the idea of urban legends to the general public. Included in the book are such chilling and humorous stories as \\"The Vanishing Hitchhiker,\\" \\"The Economical Car,\\" \\"The Ghost Airliner,\\" The Girl with the Beehive Hairdo,\\" \\"The Solid Cement Cadillac,\\" and \\"The Killer in the Back Seat.\\" Brunvand's approach, according to reviewer Janet L. Langlois, \\"sensitizes the reader in a highly readable and effective way to both the dynamic narrative process in an urban context and the discipline of folklore and folklife studies.\\" Some of these stories previously appeared in an article Brunvand wrote for the June 1980 issue of Psychology Today. As with Heard About the Solid Cement Cadillac or the Nude in the Camper?, Brunvand categorizes the different legends included in The Vanishing Hitchhiker into classic urban legend types. For each legend type, Brunvand offers samples that show variations on the legends themselves, historical evidence of how the legend may have originated (often with European or East Asian roots), and an explanation of what the legend might mean in an urban or modern context. Although recognized by critics for its usefulness as an introductory volume and reference point for expanding the field of folklore, reviewers cautioned that The Vanishing Hitchhiker lacked the depth necessary for people actively researching urban legends. Janet L. Langlois, for example, wondered what criteria Brunvand used in selecting stories for the book, as well as what made the legends American, urban and modern. Reviewer Gary Alan Fine wrote, \\"The paperback edition makes an excellent supplementary reading for introductory folklore students. It's all good fun, and Brunvand, folklore's Carl Sagan, should thrive and prosper, letting the all-purpose intelligentsia know that folklore is just as much fun as interplanetary travel and not nearly as expensive.\\" To this, Brunvand countered: \\"I really won't think I have arrived until they refer to Carl Sagan as 'The Jan Brunvand of astronomy.'\\" The Choking Doberman Patricia T. O'Connor, writer for The New York Times, described The Choking Doberman and Other \\"New\\" Urban Legends as \\"a collection of 'urban legends,' fictitious narratives that are passed from person to person in the guise of true stories and sometimes persist until they reach the status of folklore.\\" These stories are bizarre but believable and often attributed to a friend of a friend (FOAF). Like in his book, The Vanishing Hitchhiker, Brunvand provided the reader with a survey of urban legends, stories such as \\"The Choking Doberman,\\" \\"The Poison Dress,\\" and \\"The Death of Little Mikey.\\" Each story, with its accompanying variations, are categorized into themes and motifs: victimized women and children, food and beverage contamination, fearful encounters, sexual embarrassment, and humorous retribution. Though Robert D. Bethke called The Choking Doberman \\"the kind of work one immediately wants to share with friends,\\" he also criticized the work for the \\"rhetorical devises\\" Brunvand used \\"apparently to suit the popular market.\\" Critics also pointed out that Brunvand's urban legend books raise a question about race and stereotypes that, to some, are left unaddressed. Bethke wrote \\"We are told that the stories are projective of American popular culture, but precisely what racial segment of the culture participates in the currency of such stories? Specifically, we are dealing with a phenomenon like the ethnic joke, examples of which are told by target groups, or is the urban legend essentially a mainstream occurrence? I don't think the final word has been written yet on the genre, but Jan Brunvand has made admirable strides toward that end.\\" The Mexican Pet: \\"New\\" Urban Legends The Mexican Pet: \\"New\\" Urban Legends is Brunvand's third book in a series of books about urban legends meant to appeal to a general audience. This time, Brunvand includes stories collected from colleagues, students, professional newscasters and appeals through his own publications, lectures and media appearances. He organized the book in thematic categories: animal stories, automobiles, horrors, contaminations, sex and scandal, crime, and products, professionals and personalities. There are new versions of earlier legends, newly obtained pieces and leftovers from his files. Among the stories included in the book are: \\"The Mexican Pet,\\" \\"Cabbage Patch Kids' death certificates,\\" \\"The Green Stamps.\\" Many of the stories have been disseminated through print and broadcast media. Brunvand wrote in a 2003 article, \\"Nowadays it would be naive to ask for mere press releases and print articles when most people turn to websites and on-line databases for information.\\" He recognized that urban legend reference sites, like Snopes.com provide readers with far more timely examples and current information than he could keep up with in his books. American folklore books The Study of American Folklore. An Introduction The Study of American Folklore. An Introduction is a book intended for students of folklore with a particular emphasis on American Folklore as transmitted in the English language. For the purposes of this book, Brunvand defines folklore as \\"those materials in culture that circulate traditionally among members of any group in different versions, whether in oral form or by means of customary example.\\" The book is divided into three main categories: verbal (dialect and speech habits, proverbs, riddles, tales, rhymes, folk-songs, ballads), partly verbal (superstitions, customs, dances, plays), and non-verbal (gestures, music, handcrafts, folk architecture, food). Within the text, Brunvand provided for the reader information on data collecting methods, a general assessment of folklore material, bibliographic essays, and extensive lists of books and articles. To some, like reviewer Elliott Oring, the classification system used by Brunvand made The Study of American Folklore more of an \\"index\\" of American folklore rather than a \\"study\\" of it. Reviewer Kenneth Laine Ketner criticized the book for its failure to make explicit the background theory used to evaluate the works and classification system included in the book, contradictions in detail and narrative, its authoritarian tone, and its charismatic or arbitrary approach to knowledge with serious ethnocentric biases. Peter Tokofsky, in his article Introducing Folklore: A Review Essay, suggested that \\"the longevity and, presumably, continuing strong sales of the Brunvand text seems to confirm that introducing folklore by way of genres remains an effective and, for many, a preferred teaching tool even if it does not reflect the most current theoretical perspectives.\\" American Folklore: An Encyclopedia American Folklore: An Encyclopedia is an illustrated volume that contains within its pages more than 500 articles covering American and Canadian folklore and folklife. Subject areas include holidays, festivals, rituals to crafts, music, dance and occupations. The book provides short bibliographies and cross- references for further research.

The station is on the branch of both the Metropolitan line and Piccadilly line, between and stations. The station is located on Field End Road. It is in Travelcard Zone 5. History View of the eastbound platform The Metropolitan Railway (Harrow and Uxbridge Railway) constructed the line between and and commenced services on 4 July 1904 with, initially, being the only intermediate stop. At first, services were operated by steam trains, but track electrification was completed in the subsequent months and electric trains began operating on 1 January 1905. Progressive development in the north Middlesex area over the next two decades lead to the gradual opening of additional stations along the Uxbridge branch to encourage the growth of new residential areas. Eastcote opened on 26 May 1906 as Eastcote Halt. On 1 March 1910, an extension of the District line from to connect with the Metropolitan Railway at was opened enabling District line trains to serve stations between Rayners Lane and Uxbridge from that date. On 23 October 1933 District line services were replaced by Piccadilly line trains. The station was rebuilt between 1937 and 1939 to a design by Charles Holden which features the large cube-shaped brick and glass ticket hall capped with a flat reinforced concrete roof and geometrical forms typical of the new stations built in this period. The station buildings and platforms are Grade II listed. The station is surrounded by the suburb of Eastcote; the original centre, now known as Old Eastcote is some distance away. The Cavendish Pavilion nearby was a popular destination for outings in the first part of the twentieth century.

He was a Liberal member of the Legislative Assembly of Ontario from 1985 to 1995, and again from 2001 to 2012 who represented ridings north of Toronto in the city of Vaughan. Sorbara served as a cabinet minister in the governments of David Peterson and Dalton McGuinty. He resigned from cabinet October 11, 2005, following a police investigation involving his family's real estate development firm and was reinstated on May 23, 2006 after a judge ruled that there was no cause for including Sorbara's name on a search warrant. Sorbara chaired the party's successful 2007 election campaign but announced on October 26, 2007 that he was leaving the cabinet to spend more time with his family but would continue as a backbench MPP. On August 1, 2012, Sorbara announced that he was retiring from the legislature but would stay on as chair of the Liberal's election campaign. Sorbara has been Chancellor of York University since June 2014, succeeding Roy McMurtry. Family life and legal career Sorbara was born in Toronto, Ontario in 1946. His father, Sam Sorbara, immigrated to Canada from Italy in the 1920s. Sorbara graduated from St. Michael's College School and attended University of Toronto for four years but left without graduating. In 1967 he joined the Company of Young Canadians in Vancouver, where he met his future partner, Kate Barlow. Later, he completed his education at York University and Osgoode Hall Law School, and began to practise law. His daughter Martina Sorbara is a singer-songwriter. On October 11, 2005, the RCMP raided the Sorbara Group offices as part of the Royal Group Technologies investigation. The police warrant stated that there were reasonable grounds to believe Sorbara and other directors of Royal Group defrauded the company and shareholders when they bought land in Brampton, that was owned by a subsidiary of the Sorbara Group. Sorbara initially resisted opposition calls for him to step down, but later resigned as Minister of Finance the same day. In 2017, Sorbara and family donated $5 million to the construction efforts of the Mackenzie Vaughan Hospital. Political career In the 1985 provincial election Sorbara ran as the Liberal in the riding of York North, a suburban riding north of Toronto. He defeated Progressive Conservative incumbent William Hodgson by 4,100 votes. The Liberals under David Peterson were able to form a minority government after this election, and Sorbara was appointed Minister of Colleges and Universities and Minister of Skills Development on June 26, 1985. Sorbara was re-elected in the redistributed riding of York Centre in the 1987 provincial election. On September 29, 1987, he became Minister of Labour with responsibility for Women's Issues. Following a cabinet shuffle in August 1989, he became Minister of Consumer and Commercial Relations. In 1990 the Liberals were upset by the New Democratic Party in the election which followed, though Sorbara won in his riding. 1992 leadership race On November 14, 1991, Sorbara announced that he was joining the race to replace Peterson as leader of the party. He stated, \\"We have to stop this province's slide into a low-wage, no-growth economy,\\" and spoke of infrastructure investment. During the convention which was held in Hamilton, Ontario on February 9, he finished third on the first ballot, and remained in this position until dropping from the race after the fourth ballot. Sorbara subsequently refused to support either Murray Elston or Lyn McLeod (the eventual winner) on the fifth and final ballot. and did not seek re-election in 1995. Sorbara supported Dalton McGuinty's successful bid for the provincial party leadership at the 1996 leadership convention. He did not run in the 1999 provincial election, but was elected Party President over Alvin Curling in November 1999. He later won a 2001 by-election in the redistributed Greater Toronto Area riding of Vaughan‚ÄîKing‚ÄîAurora, defeating Progressive Conservative candidate Joyce Frustaglio by almost 10,000 votes. Sorbara delivered a statement in May 2010, supporting the minority Muslim sect, Ahmadiyya, who were recently attacked in Lahore for practicing their faith. Minister of Finance The Liberals won the 2003 election, and Sorbara was appointed Minister of Finance in the Ontario Cabinet on October 23, 2003. Sorbara became involved in a conflict-of-interest controversy not long after his appointment. In late 2003, the Ontario Securities Commission informed Sorbara's office that Royal Group Technologies would be announcing they were under investigation by the OSC. As a former director of Royal Group, this placed Sorbara in a conflict of interest as he also oversaw the OSC. Sorbara could not consult the Premier concerning the conflict of interest as he was restricted by the province's Securities Act from informing anyone else of the impending announcement by the company. Royal Group did not announce the investigation for almost two months. There were calls for Sorbara to resign after the controversy became public knowledge, but he was cleared of any wrongdoing by the provincial integrity commissioner in August 2004. On May 18, 2004, Sorbara released the McGuinty government's first budget. The centrepiece was a controversial new Health Premium of $300 to $900, staggered according to income. This violated a key Liberal campaign pledge not to raise taxes, and gave the government an early reputation for breaking promises. The Liberals defended the premium by pointing to the previous government's hidden deficit, and McGuinty claimed he needed to break his campaign pledge on taxation to fulfill his promises on other fronts. This broken promise has created a lasting public relations difficulty for the Liberal Party. The Ontario Health Premium also became a major issue in the early days of the 2004 federal election, called a week after the Ontario budget. Most believe that the controversy hampered Liberal Prime Minister Paul Martin's bid for re-election. Also controversial was the elimination of coverage for health services not covered by the Canada Health Act including eye examinations and physical therapy. Other elements of the McGuinty government's first budget were a four- year plan to tackle the deficit left behind by the Conservatives, free immunization for children, investments in education and investments to lower waiting times for cancer care, cardiac care, joint replacement and MRI and CT scans. On May 11, 2005, Sorbara delivered his second budget. The flagship of the budget was the \\"Reaching Higher\\" plan. Investing $6.2 billion over four years, the plan increased accessibility for low-income students with loans and grants while funding more enrollments, expanded medical school spaces, and invested in new faculty, graduate scholarships and research. The budget also projected breaking a vow to balance the future 2007‚Äì08 budget. Sorbara instead aimed at balance in 2008‚Äì09. Sorbara also moved to expand infrastructure spending by encouraging Ontario's large pension plans to invest in the construction of new roads, schools and hospitals. Specific projects in the budget included a 10-year expansion of the TTC and Go Transit, 15,000 new affordable housing units and improved border crossings. NDP leader Howard Hampton described this move as \\"privatization by stealth.\\" After a cabinet shuffle on June 29, 2005, Sorbara was also named as the Chair of the Management Board of Cabinet. Sorbara was re-elected to the Legislature in the 2007 election, and subsequently on October 26, 2007, he announced that he no longer wanted to sit in Cabinet, citing he wanted to devote more time for his constituents and his family.

Today the sink is fed by drainage canals of the Truckee- Carson Irrigation District. The southeastern fringe of the sink, where the canals enter, is a wetland of the Central Basin and Range ecoregion. This is mostly included within the Fallon National Wildlife Refuge and the Stillwater Wildlife Management Area. This area serves as an important stopover for migrating waterfowl. The Sehoo Formation is in the south of the Carson Sink. Carson Sink and Lone Rock working areas The Carson Sink and Lone Rock working areas are the northwest portion of both the Carson Sink and the US Naval Fallon Range Training Complex. The Lone Rock working area includes the Bravo-20 range, which has numerous targets for combat aircraft training. Lone Rock is in the middle of a Bravo-20 live bombing area. It is a solitary pinnacle of rock through the playa and it is held sacred by the Northern Paiute. History The Carson Sink was a deep portion of the Pleistocene water body Lake Lahontan, the lakebed of which is now the Lahontan Basin. The Carson Trail, used during the California Gold Rush across the Lahontan Basin, included a section from through the Forty Mile Desert to the first drinkable water on the Carson River. The Carson Sink station of the Pony Express was built in March 1860. In June 1952 two U.S. Air Force colonels flew a B-25 bomber from Hamilton Field near San Francisco to Colorado Springs, Colorado. While passing over Carson Sink, the two reportedly saw three unknown aircraft fly within 800 yards of their aircraft before speeding out of sight seconds later. Upon landing, the two colonels reported the incident to the Air Defence Command headquarters, who informed them that there were no military or civilian aircraft in the area at the time. The incident was never resolved and is known today as the Carson Sink UFO incident. In 1984, the natural dike between the Carson Sink and the Humboldt Sink was breached by the Nevada Department of Transportation to prevent Interstate 80 and the town of Lovelock from flooding due to unusually heavy snowfall in the preceding three years. The sinks remained connected by water for 3 years, until 1987.

This treatment can be used by people with delayed sleep phase disorder (DSWPD), who generally cannot reset their circadian rhythm by moving their bedtime and rising time earlier. DSWPD is a circadian rhythm sleep disorder, characterised by a mismatch between a person's internal biological clock and societal norms. Chronotherapy uses the human phase response to light or melatonin. The American Academy of Sleep Medicine has recommended chronotherapy for the treatment of circadian rhythm and sleep disorders.  Example  Here is an example of how chronotherapy could work over a week's course of treatment, with the patient going to sleep 1 hour later every day until the desired sleep and wake time is reached. * Day 1: sleep 5:00 pm to 12:00 am * Day 2: sleep 6:00 pm to 1:00 am * Day 3: sleep 7:00pm to 2:00 am * Day 4: sleep 8:00pm to 3:00 am * Day 5: sleep 9:00pm to 4:00 am * Day 6: sleep 10:00pm to 5:00 am * Day 7 and thereafter: sleep 11:00 pm to 7:00 am While this technique can provide respite from sleep deprivation for people who must wake early for school or work, the new sleep and wake times can only be maintained by following a strictly disciplined timetable for sleeping and rising.  Other forms of sleep phase chronotherapy  A modified chronotherapyThorpy et al. in J Adolesc Health Care, 1988;9. is called controlled sleep deprivation with phase advance, SDPA. One stays awake one whole night and day, then goes to bed 90 minutes earlier than usual and maintains the new bedtime for a week. This process is repeated weekly until the desired bedtime is reached. Sometimes, although extremely infrequently, \\"reverse\\" chronotherapy - i.e., gradual movements of bedtime and rising time earlier each day - has been used in treatment of patients with abnormally short circadian rhythms, in an attempt to move their bedtimes to later times of the day. Because circadian rhythms substantially shorter than 24 hours are extremely rare, this type of chronotherapy has remained largely experimental.  Side effects  The safety of chronotherapy is not fully known. While chronotherapy has been successful for some, it is necessary to rigidly maintain the desired sleep/wake cycle thenceforth. Any deviation in schedule tends to allow the body clock to shift later again. Chronotherapy has been known to cause non-24-hour sleep‚Äìwake disorder in at least three recorded cases, as reported in the New England Journal of Medicine in 1992. Animal studies have suggested that such lengthening could \\"slow the intrinsic rhythm of the body clock to such an extent that the normal 24-hour day no longer lies within its range of entrainment.\\"  References   Further reading Czeisler CA, Richardson GS, Coleman RM, Zimmerman JC, Moore-Ede MC, Dement WC, & Weitzman ED.

Sleep disorders Therapy Medical treatments Circadian rhythm ","title":"Chronotherapy (sleep phase)"},{"id":"699110","text":"Light therapy‚Äîor phototherapy, classically referred to as heliotherapy‚Äîconsists either of exposure to daylight or some equivalent form of light as a treatment for seasonal affective disorder (SAD), or exposure of the skin to specific wavelengths of light using polychromatic polarised light to treat a skin condition. It is used as a treatment for wintertime seasonal affective disorder and in circadian rhythm disorders, such as delayed sleep phase disorder. There is tentative evidence to support its use to treat non- seasonal psychiatric disorders, in particular major depression and depression in bipolar disorder. As a treatment for disorders of the skin, the second kind of light therapy is meant to correct psoriasis, acne vulgaris, eczema and neonatal jaundice.  Medical uses   Skin conditions  Light therapy treatments for the skin usually involve exposure to ultraviolet light. The exposures can be to a small area of the skin or over the whole body surface, as in a tanning bed. The most common treatment is with narrowband UVB, which has a wavelength of approximately 311‚Äì313 nanometers. Exposure to photons (light) at these specific wavelengths enables the body to produce vitamin D. Full body phototherapy can be delivered at a doctor's office or at home using a large high power UVB booth. Tanning beds, however, generate mostly UVA light, and only 4% to 10% of tanning bed light is in the UVB spectrum. = Atopic dermatitis = Light therapy is considered one of the best monotherapy treatments for atopic dermatitis (AD) when applied to patients who have not responded to traditional topical treatments. The therapy offers a wide range of options: UVA1 for acute AD, NB-UVB for chronic AD, and balneophototherapy have proven their efficacy. Patients tolerate the therapy safely but, as in any therapy, there are potential adverse effects and care must be taken in its application, particularly to children. = Psoriasis = For psoriasis, UVB phototherapy has been shown to be effective. A feature of psoriasis is localized inflammation mediated by the immune system. Ultraviolet radiation is known to suppress the immune system and reduce inflammatory responses. Light therapy for skin conditions like psoriasis usually use 313 nanometer UVB though it may use UVA (315‚Äì400 nm wavelength) or a broader spectrum UVB (280‚Äì315 nm wavelength). UVA combined with psoralen, a drug taken orally, is known as PUVA treatment. In UVB phototherapy the exposure time is very short, seconds to minutes depending on intensity of lamps and the person's skin pigment and sensitivity. The time is typically controlled with a timer that turns off the lamps after the treatment time ends. = Vitiligo = About 1% of the human population suffers from vitiligo which causes painless distinct light-colored patches of the skin on the face, hands, and legs. Phototherapy is an effective treatment because it forces skin cells to manufacture melanin to protect the body from UV damage. Prescribed treatment is generally 3 times a week in a clinic or daily at home. About 1 month usually results in re- pigmentation in the face and neck, and 2‚Äì4 months in the hands and legs. Narrowband UVB is more suitable to the face and neck and PUVA is more effective at the hands and legs. = Acne vulgaris = evidence for light therapy and lasers in the treatment of acne vulgaris was not sufficient to recommend them. There is moderate evidence for the efficacy of blue and blue- red light therapies in treating mild acne, but most studies are of low quality. While light therapy appears to provide short-term benefit, there is a lack of long-term outcome data or data in those with severe acne. = Cancer = According to the American Cancer Society, there is some evidence that ultraviolet light therapy may be effective in helping treat certain kinds of skin cancer, and ultraviolet blood irradiation therapy is established for this application. However, alternative uses of light for cancer treatment ‚Äì light box therapy and colored light therapy ‚Äì are not supported by evidence. Photodynamic therapy (often with red light) is used to treat certain superficial non-melanoma skin cancers. = Other skin conditions = Some types of phototherapy may be effective in the treatment of polymorphous light eruption, cutaneous T-cell lymphoma and lichen planus. Narrowband UVB between 311‚Äì313 nanometers is the most common treatment. = Wound healing = Low level laser therapy has been studied as a potential treatment for chronic wounds, and higher-power lasers have sometimes been successfully used to close acute wounds as an alternative to stitching. However, and due to inconsistent results and the low quality of extant research, reviews in the scientific literature have not supported its widespread application.  Retinal conditions  There is preliminary evidence that light therapy is an effective treatment for diabetic retinopathy and diabetic macular oedema.  Mood and sleep related  = Seasonal affective disorder = The effectiveness of light therapy for treating SAD may be linked to the fact that light therapy makes up for lost sunlight exposure and resets the body's internal clock. Studies show that light therapy helps reduce the debilitating and depressive behaviors of SAD, such as excessive sleepiness and fatigue, with results lasting for at least 1 month. Light therapy is preferred over antidepressants in the treatment of SAD because it is a relatively safe and easy therapy. It is possible that response to light therapy for SAD could be season dependent. Morning therapy has provided the best results because light in the early morning aids in regulating the circadian rhythm. People affected by SAD have low levels of energy and have difficulty concentrating. They usually have a change in appetite and experience trouble sleeping. A 2007 systematic review by the Swedish agency SBU found insufficient evidence that light therapy was able to alleviate symptoms of depression or seasonal affective disorder. The report recommended that: \\"Approximately 100 participants are required to establish whether the therapy is moderately more effective than placebo\\". Although treatment in light therapy rooms was well established in Sweden, no satisfactory, controlled studies had been published on the subject. This led to the closure of a number of clinics offering light therapy in Sweden. A Cochrane (organisation) review conducted in 2019 states the evidence that light therapy is effective as a treatment for prevention of seasonal affective disorder is limited, though the risk of adverse effects are minimal. Therefore, the decision to use light therapy should be based on a person's preference of treatment. = Non-seasonal depression = Light therapy has also been suggested in the treatment of non-seasonal depression and other psychiatric mood disturbances, including major depressive disorder, bipolar disorder and postpartum depression. A meta-analysis by the Cochrane Collaboration concluded that \\"for patients suffering from non-seasonal depression, light therapy offers modest though promising antidepressive efficacy.\\" A 2008 systematic review concluded that \\"overall, bright light therapy is an excellent candidate for inclusion into the therapeutic inventory available for the treatment of nonseasonal depression today, as adjuvant therapy to antidepressant medication, or eventually as stand-alone treatment for specific subgroups of depressed patients.\\" A 2015 review found that supporting evidence for light therapy was limited due to serious methodological flaws. = Circadian rhythm sleep disorders and jet lag=  Chronic circadian rhythm sleep disorders (CRSD)  In the management of circadian rhythm disorders such as delayed sleep phase disorder (DSPD), the timing of light exposure is critical. Light exposure administered to the eyes before or after the nadir of the core body temperature rhythm can affect the phase response curve. Use upon awakening may also be effective for non-24-hour sleep‚Äìwake disorder. Some users have reported success with lights that turn on shortly before awakening (dawn simulation). Evening use is recommended for people with advanced sleep phase disorder. Some, but not all, totally blind people whose retinae are intact, may benefit from light therapy. Situational CRSD Light therapy has been tested for individuals with shift work sleep disorder and for jet lag.  Sleep disorder in Parkinson's disease  Light therapy has been trialed in treating sleep disorders experienced by patients with Parkinson's disease.  Sleep Disorder in Alzheimer's Disease  Studies have shown that daytime and evening light therapy for nursing home patients with Alzheimer‚Äôs disease, who often struggle with agitation and fragmented wake/rest cycles effectively led to more consolidated sleep and an increase in circadian rhythm stability.  Neonatal jaundice (Postnatal Jaundice)  A newborn infant undergoing white-light phototherapy to treat neonatal jaundice.Light therapy is used to treat cases of neonatal jaundice. Bilirubin, a yellow pigment normally formed in the liver during the breakdown of old red blood cells, cannot always be effectively cleared by a neonate‚Äôs liver causing neonatal jaundice. Accumulation of excess bilirubin can cause central nervous system damage, and so this buildup of bilirubin must be treated. Phototherapy uses the energy from light to isomerize the bilirubin and consequently transform it into compounds that the newborn can excrete via urine and stools. Bilirubin is most successful absorbing light in the blue region of the visible light spectrum, which falls between 460-490 nm. Therefore light therapy technologies that utilize these blue wavelengths are the most successful at isomerizing bilirubin.  Techniques   Photodynamic therapy  Photodynamic therapy is a form of phototherapy using nontoxic light-sensitive compounds that are exposed selectively to light, whereupon they become toxic to targeted malignant and other diseased cells One of the treatments is using blue light with aminolevulinic acid for the treatment of actinic keratosis. This is not a U.S. FDA-approved treatment for acne vulgaris.  Light boxes  The brightness and color temperature of light from a light box are quite similar to daylight. The production of the hormone melatonin, a sleep regulator, is inhibited by light and permitted by darkness as registered by photosensitive ganglion cells in the retina. To some degree, the reverse is true for serotonin, which has been linked to mood disorders. Hence, for the purpose of manipulating melatonin levels or timing, light boxes providing very specific types of artificial illumination to the retina of the eye are effective. Light therapy uses either a light box which emits up to 10,000 lux of light at a specified distance, much brighter than a customary lamp, or a lower intensity of specific wavelengths of light from the blue (460 nm) to the green (525 nm) areas of the visible spectrum. A 1995 study showed that green light therapy at doses of 350 lux produces melatonin suppression and phase shifts equivalent to 10,000 lux white light therapy, but another study published in May 2010 suggests that the blue light often used for SAD treatment should perhaps be replaced by green or white illumination, because of a possible involvement of the cones in melatonin suppression.  Risks and complications   Ultraviolet  Ultraviolet light causes progressive damage to human skin and erythema even from small doses. This is mediated by genetic damage, collagen damage, as well as destruction of vitamin A and vitamin C in the skin and free radical generation. Ultraviolet light is also known to be a factor in formation of cataracts. Ultraviolet radiation exposure is strongly linked to incidence of skin cancer.  Visible light  Optical radiation of any kind with enough intensity can cause damage to the eyes and skin including photoconjunctivitis and photokeratitis. Researchers have questioned whether limiting blue light exposure could reduce the risk of age-related macular degeneration. It is reported that bright light therapy may activate the production of reproductive hormones, such as testosterone, luteinizing hormone, follicle-stimulating hormone, and estradiol. Modern phototherapy lamps used in the treatment of seasonal affective disorder and sleep disorders either filter out or do not emit ultraviolet light and are considered safe and effective for the intended purpose, as long as photosensitizing drugs are not being taken at the same time and in the absence of any existing eye conditions. Light therapy is a mood altering treatment, and just as with drug treatments, there is a possibility of triggering a manic state from a depressive state, causing anxiety and other side effects. While these side effects are usually controllable, it is recommended that patients undertake light therapy under the supervision of an experienced clinician, rather than attempting to self-medicate. Contraindications to light therapy for seasonal affective disorder include conditions that might render the eyes more vulnerable to phototoxicity, tendency toward mania, photosensitive skin conditions, or use of a photosensitizing herb (such as St. John's wort) or medication. Patients with porphyria should avoid most forms of light therapy. Patients on certain drugs such as methotrexate or chloroquine should use caution with light therapy as there is a chance that these drugs could cause porphyria. Side effects of light therapy for sleep phase disorders include jumpiness or jitteriness, headache, eye irritation and nausea. Some non- depressive physical complaints, such as poor vision and skin rash or irritation, may improve with light therapy.  History  Many ancient cultures practiced various forms of heliotherapy, including people of Ancient Greece, Ancient Egypt, and Ancient Rome.F. Ellinger Medical Radiation Biology Springfield 1957 The Inca, Assyrian and early German settlers also worshipped the sun as a health bringing deity. Indian medical literature dating to 1500 BCE describes a treatment combining herbs with natural sunlight to treat non- pigmented skin areas. Buddhist literature from about 200 CE and 10th-century Chinese documents make similar references. The Faroese physician Niels Finsen is believed to be the father of modern phototherapy. He developed the first artificial light source for this purpose. Finsen used short wavelength light to treat lupus vulgaris, a skin infection caused by Mycobacterium tuberculosis. He thought that the beneficial effect was due to ultraviolet light killing the bacteria, but recent studies showed that his lens and filter system did not allow such short wavelengths to pass through, leading instead to the conclusion that light of approximately 400 nanometers generated reactive oxygen that would kill the bacteria. Finsen also used red light to treat smallpox lesions. He received the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine in 1903. Scientific evidence for some of his treatments is lacking, and later eradication of smallpox and development of antibiotics for tuberculosis rendered light therapy obsolete for these diseases. From the late nineteenth century until the early 1930s, light therapy was considered an effective and mainstream medical therapy in the UK for conditions such as varicose ulcer, 'sickly children' and a wide range of other conditions. Controlled trials by the medical scientist Dora Colebrook supported by the Medical Research Council, indicated that light therapy was not effective for such a wide range of conditions.

Marfa, Texas is located at . The Marfa lights, also known as the Marfa ghost lights, have been observed near U.S. Route 67 on Mitchell Flat east of Marfa, Texas, in the United States. They have gained some fame as onlookers have attributed them to paranormal phenomena such as ghosts, UFOs, or will-o'-the-wisp. Scientific research suggests that most, if not all, are atmospheric reflections of automobile headlights and campfires. Overview According to Judith Brueske, \\"The 'Marfa Lights' of west Texas have been called many names over the years, such as ghost lights, weird lights, mystery lights, or Chinati lights. The favorite place from which to view the lights is a widened shoulder on Highway 90 about nine miles east of Marfa. The lights are most often reported as distant spots of brightness, distinguishable from ranch lights and automobile headlights on Highway 67 (between Marfa and Presidio, to the south) primarily by their aberrant movements.\\" Robert and Judy Wagers define \\"Classic Marfa Lights\\" as being seen south-southwest of the Marfa Lights Viewing Center (MLVC). They define the left margin of the viewing area as being aligned along the Big Bend Telephone Company tower as viewed from the MLVC, and the right margin as Chinati Peak as viewed from the MLVC. Referring to the Marfa Lights View Park east of Marfa, James Bunnell states, \\"you might just see mysterious orbs of light suddenly appear above desert foliage. These balls of light may remain stationary as they pulse on and off with intensity varying from dim to almost blinding brilliance. Then again, these ghostly lights may dart across the desert...or perform splits and mergers. Light colors are usually yellow-orange but other hues, including green, blue and red are also seen. Marfa Mystery Lights (MLs) usually fly above desert vegetation but below background mesas.\\" History The first historical record of the Marfa lights was in 1883 when a young cowhand, Robert Reed Ellison, saw a flickering light while he was driving cattle through Paisano Pass and wondered if it was the campfire of Apache Indians. Other settlers told him they often saw the lights, but that when they investigated they found no ashes or other evidence of a campsite. Joe and Anne Humphreys next reported seeing the lights in 1885. Both stories appear in Cecilia Thompson's book History of Marfa and Presidio County, Texas 1535-1946, which was published in 1985. The first published account of the lights appeared in the July 1957 issue of Coronet magazine. In 1976 Elton Miles's Tales of the Big Bend included stories dating to the 19th century and a photograph of the Marfa lights by a local rancher. Bunnell lists 34 Marfa lights sightings from 1945 through 2008. Monitoring stations were put in place starting in 2003. He has identified \\"an average of 9.5 MLs on 5.25 nights per year\\", but believes that the monitoring stations may only be finding half of the Marfa lights in Mitchell Flat. Explanations Atmospheric phenomena Skeptic Brian Dunning notes that the designated \\"View Park\\" for the lights, a roadside park on the south side of U.S. Route 90 about 9 miles (14 km) east of Marfa, is at the site of Marfa Army Airfield, where tens of thousands of personnel were stationed between 1942 and 1947, training American and Allied pilots. This massive field was then used for years as a regional airport, with daily airline service. Since Marfa AAF and its satellite fields are each constantly patrolled by sentries, they consider it unlikely that any unusual phenomena would remain unobserved and unmentioned. According to Dunning, the likeliest explanation is that the lights are a sort of mirage caused by sharp temperature gradients between cold and warm layers of air. Marfa is at an elevation of 4,688 ft (1,429 m) above sea level, and temperature differentials of 40‚Äì50 ¬∞F (22‚Äì28 ¬∞C) between high and low temperatures are quite common. Car lights In May 2004 a group from the Society of Physics Students at the University of Texas at Dallas spent four days investigating and recording lights observed southwest of the view park using traffic volume-monitoring equipment, video cameras, binoculars, and chase cars. Their report made the following conclusions: * U.S. Highway 67 is visible from the Marfa lights viewing location. * The frequency of lights southwest of the view park correlates with the frequency of vehicle traffic on U.S. 67. * The motion of the observed lights was in a straight line, corresponding to U.S. 67. * When the group parked a vehicle on U.S. 67 and flashed its headlights, this was visible at the view park and appeared to be a Marfa light. * A car passing the parked vehicle appeared as one Marfa light passing another at the view park. They came to the conclusion that all the lights observed over a four-night period southwest of the view park could be reliably attributed to automobile headlights traveling along U.S. 67 between Marfa and Presidio, Texas. =Spectroscopic analysis= For 20 nights in May 2008, scientists from Texas State University used spectroscopy equipment to observe lights from the Marfa lights viewing station. They recorded a number of lights that \\"could have been mistaken for lights of unknown origin\\", but in each case the movements of the lights and the data from their equipment could be easily explained as automobile headlights or small fires.Stephan, Karl D. et. al (2009) Spectroscopy applied to observations of terrestrial light sources of uncertain origin American Journal of Physics See also *Aleya (Ghost light), Bengal *Aurora *Brown Mountain Lights *Chir Batti *Fata Morgana (mirage) *Gurdon Light *Hessdalen lights *Min Min light *Paulding Light *The Spooklight *St. Louis Light *Will-o'-the-wisp References Notes Bibliography * Manuel Borraz Aymerich and Vicente-Juan Ballester Olmos, \\"The Marfa Lights: Examining the Photographic Evidence (2003-2007), 2020 * James Bunnell,\\"Strange Lights in West Texas\\" Lacey Publishing Company, 29 Bounty Road West, Benbrook, TX 76132-1003, USA, 2015 * James Bunnell,\\"Hunting Marfa Lights\\" Lacey Publishing Company, 29 Bounty Road West, Benbrook, TX 76132-1003, USA, 2009 Herbert Lindee, \\"Ghosts Lights of Texas,\\" Skeptical Inquirer, Vol. 166, No. 4, Summer 1992, pp. 400‚Äì406 * Elton Miles, \\"Tales of the Big Bend,\\" Texas A&M; University Press, 1976, pp. 149‚Äì167 * Paul Moran, \\"The Mystery of the Texas Ghost Light,\\" Coronet Magazine, July 1957 * Dennis Stacy, \\"The Marfa Lights, A Viewer's Guide,\\" Seale & Stacy, Box 12434, San Antonio, Texas 78212, USA, 1989 David Stipp, \\"Marfa, Texas, Finds a Flickering Fame in Mystery Lights,\\" Wall Street Journal, March 21, 1984, p.

The main stem of the river is long although addition of the East Fork makes the total length , traversing five counties: Alpine County in California and Douglas, Storey, Lyon, and Churchill Counties in Nevada, as well as the Consolidated Municipality of Carson City, Nevada. The river is named for Kit Carson, who guided John C. Fr√©mont's expedition westward up the Carson Valley and across Carson Pass in winter, 1844. History Archaeological finds place the eastern border for the prehistoric Martis people in the Reno/Carson River area, apparently the first humans to enter the area about 12,000 years ago. By the early 1800s, the Northern Paiute lived near the lower Carson River and the present Stillwater National Wildlife Refuge, while the Washoe people inhabited the upper watershed region. The first European settlements in Nevada were the 1851 settlements at Mormon Station (now Genoa) and at the mouth of Gold Canyon (Dayton), both in the Carson River Watershed. In the 1850s and 1860s, the river was used as the route of the Carson Trail, a branch of the California Trail that allowed access to the California gold fields, as well as by the Pony Express. Gold was discovered along the river in the Silver Mountain Mining District in 1860. The 1868 Virginia and Truckee Railroad transported ore to the quartz reduction mines along the river. Virginia City, Nevada, along the lower watershed, was home in 1859 to the world's greatest silver rush, the Comstock Lode. The Carson Valley provided food and forage for the silver miners and their livestock. The Comstock mining boom critically impacted the watershed and its water quality by causing deforested slopes, mine tailings, and steep raw riverbanks above channels cut into the valley floor in many places. These mining operations have also led to high levels of existing mercury concentrations within the watershed. In the early 20th century, the Newlands Reclamation Act was passed to bring irrigation water into the region for agriculture. The Lahontan Dam, completed in 1914, was constructed as part of the Newlands Irrigation Project. The Truckee-Carson Irrigation District was formed in 1918 as part of the project to divert water from the Truckee River to the Carson Valley for agricultural use. In 1989, the East Fork Carson River was designated a \\"Wild and Scenic River\\" by the State of California from Hangman's Bridge just east of Markleeville, California to the CA/NV border, prohibiting any further consideration of impoundment. Watershed The Carson River watershed encompasses and includes two major forks in the Sierra Nevada in its upper watershed region. The East Fork rises on the north slopes of Sonora Peak (itself just north of Sonora Pass at about in southern Alpine County, southeast of Markleeville in the Carson-Iceberg Wilderness. The West Fork rises in the Sierras near Carson Pass and Lost Lakes at elevation and flows northeast into Nevada, joining the East Fork about southeast of Genoa. The Carson River then flows north to the end of the upper watershed at Mexican Dam just southeast of Carson City. In the middle watershed the river runs generally northeast from Carson City across Lyon County, past Dayton. The middle watershed ends in eastern Churchill County at the Lahontan Dam. Here river flows are augmented by water from the Truckee River and stored in the Lake Lahontan reservoir. Downstream from the dam (in the lower watershed) much of the water is used for irrigation in the vicinity of Fallon, with limited flows continuing northeast into the Carson Sink. Clear Creek, which begins at about on Snow Valley Peak (Toiyabe National Forest, Carson Range) west of Carson City, is the only perennial tributary of the Carson River mainstem, and is protected by the Nature Conservancy.  Carson River Mercury Superfund Site  The Carson River basin, from New Empire to Stillwater and the Carson Sink, was designated as National Priority Listed (NPL) due to historic mining activity site under the Comprehensive Environmental Response Compensation and Liability Act (CERCLA or Superfund) in August, 1990. This is Nevada's only NPL site and is being jointly managed by NDEP and the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency 9 (EPA), Region IX, in San Francisco. Millions of pounds of mercury were imported and used in approximately 250 Comstock mills to recover gold and silver. An estimated 14,000,000 pounds of mercury was lost to the environment during that process. Arsenic and Lead, which were common constituents of the mined ore, were concentrated by the milling process and were also released to the environment. Therefore, the Contaminants of Concern (CoC's) at the site are Mercury, Arsenic and Lead. Mercury, Arsenic and Lead are known or suspected carcinogens (cancer causing agents) and/or detrimental to human health in some other way. They do, however, need a route into the human body. Direct contact with soils and subsequent ingestion and/or eating fish and waterfowl taken from the CRMS area, which may have already ingested CoC's, provide the most likely route into the body. Small children have highest risk due to developing bodies and their propensity for ingesting soil while at play. The EPA and other scientists studied residents of contaminated areas and found no direct evidence of increased metals in blood, hair and urine samples. They did find elevated levels in certain fish and waterfowl. Some of the highest levels in the nation. Human health, if impacted, would be impacted slowly, over years of small amounts of exposure and could be hard to detect. A few simple measures can greatly decrease soil ingestion rates, like washing hands and dusting and vacuuming regularly. Take care with the amount of fish and waterfowl that are taken and eaten from the Carson River, Lake Lahontan, Indian Lakes, Big and Little Washoe Lakes and the Stillwater Wildlife Refuge (review NDOW guidance). Remember that smaller fish typically contain less mercury than larger fish and eating small portions over a broader time presents less risk than eating large portions over short time periods. The upland (dry-land) contamination source area of the CRMS. OU-1 is undergoing continued management and monitoring to assure public protection from mine wastes. The most significant health risk in OU-1 is direct contact and ingestion of contaminated soils. OU-2 is defined as the water, sediment and biologic resources of the Carson River, Lahontan Reservoir, Washoe Lakes, Steamboat Creek, associated Irrigation Ditches and Stillwater Wildlife Refuge. EPA Contractor and USGS are continuing studies of OU-2 areas and will be producing a (RI/FS). The most significant health risk posed by mercury in OU-2 is consumption of fish and waterfowl from affected lake & river systems. In the 1990s the EPA compelled several limited area cleanups to be completed by third parties and completed cleanup on a half dozen areas themselves. The cleanups occurred primarily in residential areas of Dayton. The remainder of the site has not undergone cleanup and due to the size and scope of the area impacted; most likely never will. Since complete site cleanup is not economically viable. A Long Term Sampling and Response Plan (LTSRP) was developed to manage site contamination into the future. The LTSRP provides guidance for land development activities (both commercial and residential) to help assure site CoC's do not impact human health and the environment. Typically, soil sampling is required to verify developed area soils do not contain CoC's at levels which may cause harm to human health. Ecology The lower reaches of the Carson River near Fallon In the lower reaches of the Carson River watershed, the Stillwater National Wildlife Refuge hosts large breeding colonies of white-faced ibis (Plegadis chihi) and is frequented by non-breeding American white pelicans (Pelecanus erythrorhynchos). In winter the refuge supports wintering tundra swans (Cygnus columbianus) as well as hosts of ducks and geese. The Carson River watershed also provides habitat for many smaller species of birds such as tree swallows (Tachycineta bicolor) and house wrens (Troglodytes aedon). Recent research of these two bird species has shown significant mercury concentrations in the livers and eggshells of the birds nesting along the river. The upper Carson River watershed provides habitat for the threatened Lahontan cutthroat trout (Oncorhynchus clarki henshawi), as well as large non-native rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) and brown trout (Salmo trutta), providing excellent fly fishing. The Lahontan cutthroat is threatened by hybridization with rainbow trout, but there is a pure Lahontan strain on of the East Fork Carson River from the headwaters to Carson Falls. There is also a native population of the only Paiute cutthroat trout (Oncorhynchus clarki seleniris) in existence in the drainages of Silver King Creek, a tributary of the East Fork Carson River in the Carson Ranger District of the Humboldt-Toiyabe National Forest. North American beaver (Castor canadensis) were re-introduced to the Carson River watershed around 1940 and have thrived since. There are eyewitness accounts of beaver in the upper Carson River through 1892. The Washo people who lived in the eastern Sierra with hunting grounds extending as far west as Calaveras County, have a word for beaver, c'imh√©lhel. Powers reported that the northern Paiute wrapped their hair in strips of beaver fur, made medicine from parts of beaver and that their creation legend included beaver, which they called su-i'-tu-ti- kut'-teh. Given the hydrological connection of the Humboldt River and Sink to the Carson Sink during flood years (as recently as 1998), it is not surprising that beavers were historically extant on eastern Sierra watercourses. Peter Skene Ogden, on a Hudson's Bay Company expedition to the terminus of the Humboldt River, wrote in his diary on May 15, 1829, \\"In no part have I found beaver so abundant. The total number of American trappers in this region at this time exceeds 80. I have only 28 trappers... The trappers now average 125 beaver a man and are greatly pleased with their success.\\" James \\"Grizzly\\" Adams trapped beaver in the Carson River around 1860, \\"In the evening we caught a fine lot of salmon-trout (cutthroat trout), using grasshoppers for bait, and in the night killed half a dozen beavers, which were very tame.\\" Adams' account is consistent with a 1906 newspaper article in the Nevada State Journal that the Mason's Valley of the nearby Walker River in Yerington, Nevada was well known to \\"the early trappers and fur hunters...Kit Carson knew it to the bone...The beavers of course were all trapped long ago, and you never see an elk nowadays...\\"  Recreation  The Carson River is a trophy trout stream. Backcountry hiking is found along the upper river in the Carson- Iceberg Wilderness. Kayakers and river rafters enjoy the lower river's gentle class II rapids, as well as its outstanding scenery and river-side hot springs. The East Carson has extensive Native American cultural values associated with the Washoe tribe. The watershed is also a popular recreation spot for mountain biking, off-roading, hunting, and horse-back riding. Development along the river in Douglas, Carson City, and Lyon counties has limited public access in some areas.

This initial service continued mail delivery and, later, the issuing of postage stamps until 1970. It was then succeeded by the Hellenic Post S.A. (abbreviated ŒïŒõŒ§Œë), which remains Greece's official postal provider. The first Greek stamps (known as \\"Large Hermes heads\\") were issued in 1861; by then, the postal service had expanded to operate 97 branches.Athens Postal & Philatelic Museum. Greek 1 drachma stamp from \\"A M\\" issue, 1902Until 1966, with the exception of a set issued in 1927, all Greek stamps were simply inscribed ŒïŒõŒõŒëŒ£ (Hellas, the country's Greek name). From 1966 to 1982, the inscription was modified to include both the Greek and Latin versions: ŒïŒõŒõŒëŒ£-HELLAS. Beginning in 1982, ŒïŒõŒõŒëŒ£ was replaced with ŒïŒõŒõŒóŒùŒôŒöŒó ŒîŒóŒúŒüŒöŒ°ŒëŒ§ŒôŒë (Hellenic Republic); this inscription is still being used on Greek stamps. It was also used on the 1927 set referred to earlier. In 1875, Greece was among the founding members of the General Postal Union (renamed the Universal Postal Union in 1878).Linn's, p. 142. Greece's territory and population was greatly expanded by the 1912-1913 Balkan Wars; it acquired some additional territory during World War I. This led to the issuing of several sets of occupation stamps, which consisted of both existing stamp issues with overprints and newly printed issues. In addition to these, some of the so-called \\"New Territories\\", notably the islands of Ikaria and Samos, issued their own stamps prior to becoming part of Greece. Beginning with the Olympic issue of 1896, Greece has issued a number of commemorative stamps. Their subjects have included Greek history, art, mythology and wildlife. Classic period (1859‚Äì1902) Ionian Islands (1859‚Äì1864) The first Greek-inscribed stamps were not issued by Greece proper, but by the nearby Ionian Islands. Under British rule from 1815 to 1864, this island group was known as the United States of the Ionian Islands. A set of three stamps was issued on May 15, 1859. Printed by Perkins, Bacon & Co. of London and inscribed ŒôŒüŒùŒôŒöŒüŒù ŒöŒ°ŒëŒ§ŒüŒ£ (Ionian State), they depicted a profile of Queen Victoria. All were imperforate and bore no face value, this being indicated by their colors; orange (¬Ω penny), blue (1 penny) and lake (2 pence). These stamps became invalid after the Ionian Islands were ceded to Greece on June 28, 1864.Rossiter, pp. 123-4. Large Hermes heads (1861‚Äì1888) 20 lepta Large Hermes head The first stamps of Greece were the so-called \\"Large Hermes heads\\", depicting a profile of the Greek messenger god Hermes in a frame strongly resembling that used for contemporary stamps of France. The basic design was by the French engraver Albert D√©sir√© Barre and the first batch was printed in Paris by Ernst Meyer. The first set was issued on October 1, 1861. It consisted of seven denominations (1 lepton, 2, 5, 10, 20, 40 and 80 lepta). In November 1861 the printing plates were transferred to Athens and subsequent printings made there. The plates continued in use into the mid-1880s, resulting in a number of varieties due to plates becoming worn and then cleaned, as well as the printing of the stamps on several kinds of paper. Most types were also printed with control numbers on the back, and all were imperforate. Additional denominations (30 and 60 lepta) were introduced in 1876, to comply with the General Postal Union's international letter rates (30 lepta for basic, 60 for registered letters).Hellas catalogue, vol. 1, p. 3. Postage due stamps (1875‚Äì1902) The first postage due stamps of Greece were issued in 1875. The first batch was printed in Vienna, as were further releases in 1876 and 1890-1893. Green to yellow-green in color, with numerals declaring each stamp's value along with the inscription ŒµŒπŒøœÄœÅŒ±Œ∫œÑŒ≠ŒøŒΩ(-Œ±) (postage due(s)) inside a central circle, these stamps are known as \\"rologakia\\" (little clocks). The first two sets consisted of twelve values; 1 lepton, 2, 5, 10, 20, 40, 60, 70, 80 and 90 lepta, 1 drachma and 2 drachmae. The third contained only the 1 lepton, 2, 5, 40 and 60 lepta.Hellas 1, pp. 491-4. The stamps were issued with a variety of perforations: 9, 9¬Ω, 10, 10¬Ω and compound. A second design, with its inscription contained in a scroll pattern in place of the circle, was issued in 1902. Known as the London issue, it was printed by Perkins, Bacon & Co., with engraving by the Johnstonia Engraving Company. These stamps had perforations of 13¬Ω. In place of the earlier issues' 60, 70, 80 and 90 lepta values, the London issue introduced new denominations of 3, 25, 30 and 50 lepta; it also dropped the 2 drachmae value. With only minor changes, this design has been used on all Greek postage due stamps since. Small Hermes heads (1886‚Äì1900) 40 lepta Small Hermes head In 1883, Greece's postal service reduced its international letter rates to 25 and 50 lepta (for basic and registered letters respectively). This, as well as the need for a new 1 drachma value to cover parcel post services, led to the issue of a new set of stamps.Karamitsos Auction 125, p. 1. This set, the \\"Small Hermes heads\\", first appeared in 1886. The first batch was printed in Malines, Belgium followed by numerous reprints in Athens until 1900. Like their predecessors, they depicted Hermes in profile, but with a smaller head and a rounder helmet. Initially the sheets were imperforate. Perforated versions, initially 13¬Ω and later 11¬Ω, became available in 1891. The denominations were 1 lepton, 2, 5, 10, 20, 25, 40, and 50 lepta and 1 drachma. In September 1900 some of the small Hermes head stamps (blue 25 lepta and violet 40 lepta) were surcharged with different values (20 lepta, 1 drachma and 2 drachmae) due to the delay in printing the new Flying Mercury issue. 1896 Olympic issue 2 lepta stamp from 1896 Olympic issue Greece's first commemorative stamps were issued in 1896 for the 1896 Summer Olympics, the first Olympic games in modern times. The series consisted of twelve values (1 lepton, 2, 5, 10, 20, 25, 40 and 60 lepta, 1 drachma and 2, 5 and 10 drachmae). There were eight different designs, by Professor I. Svoronos, which included famous sports-related images from ancient Greece, such as a chariot race and Myron's Discobolus. The stamps were designed by Swiss artist A. Guilleron, the steel dies were created by the French engraver Louis-Eug√®ne Mouchon and printing took place at the National Printing Office of France. The name E. MOUCHON appears at the bottom side of each stamp. The stamps were delivered in perforated sheets (13¬Ω x 14). They were at first meant to be sold only during the Games, but their circulation period was extended; first to March 1897, then until they were sold out.Hellas 1, p. 59. The 1896 Olympics stamps, of which the 5 and 10 drachmae denominations are relatively rare, remain popular with collectors of topical stamps relating to sports and Olympic games. A M overprints (1900‚Äì1901) In 1900 and 1901, a variety of existing Greek stamps (Large Hermes heads, Small Hermes heads and 1896 Olympics) were surcharged in black or red with new values and also with the letters \\"A M\\", standing for the Greek words ŒëŒæŒØŒ± ŒúŒµœÑŒ±ŒªŒªŒπŒ∫ŒÆ (\\"Axia Metalliki\\" or \\"value in (gold) metal\\"), meaning that the face values were based on the gold standard of the Latin Monetary Union. These stamps were sold at the post offices at a price higher than the face value, due to the depreciation of the drachma. The \\"A M\\" stamps were mainly used for international parcel post and postal money orders, although they are sometimes found on normal letter covers. In 1902 these stamps were withdrawn and replaced with the \\"A M\\" series. Early 20th century (1901‚Äì1911) Flying Mercury and A M issues (1901‚Äì1902) Flying Mercury, 25 lepta (1901) In 1901, a new series of definitive stamps was issued, replacing the small Hermes heads and the overprints of 1900. The new stamps depicted Giovanni da Bologna's statue of Hermes/Mercury (c. 1564). The series included fourteen denominations in three different designs: 1 lepton, 2, 3, 5, 10, 20, 25, 30, 40 and 50 lepta, 1 drachma and 2, 3 and 5 drachmae. The high values of this series are notable for being printed in metallic colors; bronze (2d), silver (3d), and gold (5d). The stamps were printed on two qualities of paper (thick and thin) with watermark \\"ET\\" and crown. The sheets were delivered with perforation 13¬Ω for the low values and 11¬Ω for the high values, although small quantities were delivered with different perforations. In 1902 an additional series of five stamps was issued, depicting the head of the same statue. These stamps were in values of gold currency and inscribed \\"A M\\" for ŒëŒæŒØŒ± ŒúŒµœÑŒ±ŒªŒªŒπŒ∫ŒÆ (\\"Axia Metalliki\\" or \\"value in metal\\"). They replaced the provisional \\"A M\\" overprints of 1900-1901 for international parcel post and money orders. The series was printed by Perkins, Bacon & Co. on thick paper, watermarked with \\"ET\\" and crown and delivered with perforation 13¬Ω. These stamps were also used briefly as revenue stamps in 1913. The 1901‚Äì1902 issues remained in regular use until 1911. 1906 Olympic issue Commemorative issue for the 1906 Intercalated Games. This set of stamps was printed by Perkins, Bacon & Co. and issued on March 25, 1906. It consisted of fourteen denominations (1 lepton, 2, 3, 5, 10, 20, 25, 30, 40 and 50 lepta, 1 drachma and 2, 3 and 5 drachmae). Special commemorative cancellations were used during the Games at Zappeion (ŒñŒëŒ†Œ†ŒïŒôŒüŒù), Stadium (Œ£Œ§ŒëŒîŒôŒüŒù) and Acropolis (ŒëŒöŒ°ŒüŒ†ŒüŒõŒôŒ£) provisional post offices. The 1906 Olympics stamps were never withdrawn and can be found with postmarks dated until 1910. They were also overprinted for use as revenue stamps. 1911 Engraved issue In 1911, a new series of definitive stamps was issued to replace the Flying Mercury set. There were four different designs, by I. Svoronos (who had designed the 1896 Olympic issue) and G. Jakovides, which depicted Hermes and the rainbow goddess Iris. The set consisted of sixteen values (1 lepton, 2, 3, 5, 10, 20, 25, 30, 40 and 50 lepta, 1 drachma and 2, 3, 5, 10 and 25 drachmae). It would become known as the \\"Engraved issue\\". The plates were engraved by Thomas McDonald (UK) and printing was done by the firm Gerasimos Aspiotis Bros. of Corfu.Hellas 1, pp. 87-8. The sheets were delivered on unwatermarked paper with perforation 13¬Ω. The 3, 5 and 10 drachmae stamps from this set were re-issued in 1921 with slightly altered dimensions, measuring 20¬Ω x 25¬Ω mm.; the original issue measured 20¬Ω x 26¬Ω mm.  Territorial expansion (1912‚Äì1923)  General issue ŒïŒõŒõŒóŒùŒôŒöŒó ŒîŒôŒüŒôŒöŒóŒ£ŒôŒ£ (1912‚Äì1913) Greece's borders were greatly expanded by the Balkan Wars of 1912‚Äì1913 as it occupied Macedonia including the city of Thessaloniki, parts of Epirus and Thrace and various Aegean islands, as well as formally annexing Crete. Until these so-called \\"New Territories\\" were formally incorporated into Greece, they were not permitted to use regular Greek stamps. In order to cover postal needs in these areas, Greece's government ordered existing stamps to be overprinted with ŒïŒõŒõŒóŒùŒôŒöŒó ŒîŒôŒüŒôŒöŒóŒ£ŒôŒ£ (Hellenic Administration) until a planned 1912 issue became available. A special overprint, ŒõŒóŒúŒùŒüŒ£, was also ordered for use on the island of Lemnos, which was occupied in October 1912. These overprints, in three different colors (black, red and carmine), were applied to the 1911 \\"Engraved\\" definitives, the 20 lepta Flying Mercury stamp, the 1902 postage due stamps and some of the 1913 \\"Lithographic\\" definitives. This issue went through several printings, initially by Aspiotis Bros. and later by the Aquarone printing house of Thessaloniki. The overprints normally read from the bottom of the stamp to the top; due to misplacement of sheets in the printing press, some were released with the overprint reading from top to bottom.Hellas 1, pp. 94, 98. A variation of this overprint, consisting of the letters \\"Œï.*Œî\\" in red, was employed on the island of Chios in 1913. This was applied locally to a quantity of 25 lepta stamps from the ŒïŒõŒõŒóŒùŒôŒöŒó ŒîŒôŒüŒôŒöŒóŒ£ŒôŒ£ issue which were mistakenly delivered without the overprint. Campaign issue and Souda Bay issue (1913) 2 lepta Campaign stamp A set of sixteen stamps was issued in April 1913, to replace the provisional ŒïŒõŒõŒóŒùŒôŒöŒó ŒîŒôŒüŒôŒöŒóŒ£ŒôŒ£ and ŒõŒóŒúŒùŒüŒ£ overprints in territories under Greek military occupation. Two designs were used, depicting Constantine the Great's vision and the Eagle of Zeus; this set would become known as the \\"Campaign issue\\". It consisted of the following values: 1 lepton, 2, 3, 5, 10, 20, 25, 30, 40 and 50 lepta, 1 drachma and 2, 3, 5, 10 and 25 drachmae. It was printed by Aspiotis Bros. using the lithographic process. The stamps were printed on two types of paper, smooth and rough, with perforation 13¬Ω. These stamps were occasionally also used in Greece proper. Souda Bay commemorative, with March 1914 cancellation In 1916, certain values of the Campaign issue were overprinted with Œô. ŒöŒøŒπŒΩœåœÑŒ∑œÇ ŒëŒ≥. ŒåœÅŒøœÖœÇ (Holy Community of Mount Athos). Intended for local use in the Mount Athos area, these overprinted stamps were never put into circulation; most of them were burned in the 1930s. There were two types of overprint; horizontal (applied to the 1 lepton, 2, 3, and 15 lepta and 2 drachmae values) and vertical (applied to the 20 lepta).Hellas catalogue, volume 2, pp. 2-4. A 25 lepta commemorative stamp was issued on December 1, 1913 for use only by Cretan post offices. This stamp depicts the May 1, 1913 raising of the Greek flag on Souda Island, marking the annexation of Crete to the Kingdom of Greece. It was printed by Bradbury, Wilkinson & Co. of London with perforation 14¬Ω. It remained in circulation for only one year. Lithographic issue (1913‚Äì1923) 5 lepta pair of the 1913 Lithographic definitives The First Balkan War, and the new territory it brought Greece, led to an increase in demand for regular stamps. The increased demand, combined with a wartime money shortage, led the Greek government to seek the least expensive means of producing stamps in large quantities. It was decided to re-print the existing definitives using lithography; the resulting set is known as the \\"Lithographic issue\\". Also printed by Aspiotis Bros., the sheets were delivered on unwatermarked paper with perforation 13¬Ω. The eighteen values in this set were not issued all at once, but ranged in date from 1913 to 1923, as follows: 1 lepton, 2, 3, 5, 10, 20 and 25 lepta (1913); 15 lepta (1918); 30, 40 and 50 lepta (1914); 80 lepta (1923); 1 drachma, 2 drachmae (1919); 3 drachmae (1920); 5, 10 and 25 drachmae (1922).Scott catalogue, p. 314. The 25 and 40 lepta and 1 drachma values from this set were re-issued in 1926, printed in Vienna using new plates. Ikaria, Mytilene and Samos (1912‚Äì1915) The Aegean islands of Ikaria and Samos successfully rebelled against Ottoman rule shortly before the First Balkan War, in July and September 1912 respectively. The former was declared the \\"Free State of Ikaria\\" by a provisional government, which proceeded to issue its own stamps. These were printed by Stangel & Co. in Athens and issued in October 1912. They were inscribed ŒïŒõŒïŒ•ŒòŒïŒ°Œë Œ†ŒüŒõŒôŒ§ŒïŒôŒë ŒôŒöŒëŒ°ŒôŒëŒ£ (Free State of Ikaria) and depicted Penelope, the wife of Odysseus. The values in this set of eight consisted of 2, 5, 10, 25 and 50 lepta, 1 drachma and 2 and 5 drachmae. Ikaria was occupied by Greek forces in November 1912, after which overprinted Greek stamps replaced the local issue.Hellas 2, pp. 147-9. Though the revolutionary government on Samos wished to become part of Greece, this did not happen until late 1914 when a General Administrator was sent from Athens to take charge. In the meantime, the Samian government issued several sets of stamps. The first, issued on November 14, 1912, was a set of three depicting a map of Samos with the inscription Œ†Œ°ŒüŒ£Œ©Œ°ŒôŒùŒüŒù Œ§ŒëŒßŒ•ŒîŒ°ŒüŒúŒïŒôŒüŒù Œ£ŒëŒúŒüŒ• (Provisional Post Office of Samos). All were imperforate and printed locally by hand. The second, depicting a profile of Hermes, was printed by Stangel & Co. and released in two batches. The first batch, issued on November 26, consisted of five values (1 lepton, 5, 10, 25 and 50 lepta) with perforation 11¬Ω; the second, issued on December 22, was overprinted with ŒïŒõŒõŒëŒ£ in boldface type. It included the values from the first batch plus a 1 drachma value. This would be known as the \\"Large ŒïŒõŒõŒëŒ£\\" overprint to distinguish it from a second, thinner overprint applied in February 1914 (the \\"Thin ŒïŒõŒõŒëŒ£\\"). A third set, the \\"castles\\" issue, was released on January 4, 1913. Consisting of five values (1 drachma, 2, 5, 10 and 25 drachmae), it commemorated both an 1824 Greek victory over the Ottoman Empire at Gerontas Bay and the 1912 vote for union with Greece. The stamps were printed at the shop of lithographer O.K. Travlos in Vathy and signed ŒòŒ£, the initials of Samian president Themistoklis Sophoulis. Red ink was used for the signatures on all values except the 25 drachmae, on which black ink was used. An illustrated postal card was issued along with the Hermes set; printed on one side was the 5 lepta value from that set and the Greek coat of arms, the other side depicted Vathy palace and portraits of Sophoulis and Lykourgos Logothetis, the island's leader in the Greek War of Independence. All issues were replaced by the ŒïŒõŒõŒóŒùŒôŒöŒó ŒîŒôŒüŒôŒöŒóŒ£ŒôŒ£ and Campaign stamps when Greece assumed control of Samos. In December 1914 some of the Hermes and \\"castles\\" stamps were re-issued as charity stamps, with the overprint ŒìŒµŒΩŒπŒ∫ŒÆ ŒîŒπŒøŒØŒ∫Œ∑œÉŒπœÇ Œ£Œ¨ŒºŒøœÖ (General Administration of Samos).Hellas 2, pp. 260-1, 268-79. Mytilene was occupied by Greek forces near the end of 1912. Turkish stamps were seized from the main post office and overprinted with ŒïŒªŒªŒ∑ŒΩŒπŒ∫ŒÆ ŒöŒ±œÑŒøœáŒÆ ŒúœÖœÑŒπŒªŒÆŒΩŒ∑œÇ (\\"Greek Occupation of Mytilene\\"). This overprint was applied at the print shop of the newspaper Salpinx (\\"Trumpet\\"). Since there was no Greek currency available on Mytilene at the time, the overprinted stamps retained their value in Turkish paras and piastres.Hellas 2, pp. 251-3. Greek Occupation of Thrace (1913, 1920) 25 lepta Giumulzina occupation stampDuring the Second Balkan War, several cities in Thrace came under Greek occupation. Overprinted stamps were subsequently issued for the Thracian cities of Dedeagatch (July 1913) and Giumulzina (August 1913). In the former, a three-line overprint reading ŒïŒõŒõŒóŒùŒôŒöŒó ŒîŒôŒüŒôŒöŒóŒ£ŒôŒ£ ŒîŒïŒîŒïŒëŒìŒëŒ§Œ£ (Hellenic Administration of Dedeagatch) along with new values was applied to stamps of Bulgaria. This was followed by three sets of locally printed stamps, one in July and two in September 1913. Printed on three different colors of paper (white, yellow and blue), they were inscribed ŒïŒõŒõŒóŒùŒôŒöŒó ŒîŒôŒüŒôŒöŒóŒ£ŒôŒ£ ŒîŒïŒîŒïŒëŒìŒëŒ§Œ£ with values at the bottom. The September issues bore the added inscription Œ†Œ°ŒüŒ£Œ©Œ°ŒôŒùŒüŒù (Provisional).Hellas 2, pp. 40-5. In the latter, the overprint ŒïŒõŒõ. ŒîŒôŒüŒôŒö. ŒìŒöŒôŒüŒ•ŒúŒüŒ•ŒõŒ§ŒñŒôŒùŒëŒ£ (Hellenic Administration of Giumulzina) in blue and red was applied to Turkish stamps along with new values (10 and 25 lepta).Hellas 2, pp. 37-8. Both cities were returned to Bulgaria after the war. In 1920, after World War I, Greece regained control of western Thrace.Rossiter, p. 123. The Greek occupying authorities issued three sets of stamps for use in the region: stamps from the \\"Engraved\\", \\"Lithographic\\" and 1916 \\"ET\\" issues overprinted with ŒîŒπŒøŒØŒ∫Œ∑œÉŒπœÇ ŒîœÖœÑŒπŒ∫ŒÆœÇ ŒòœÅŒ¨Œ∫Œ∑œÇ (Administration of Western Thrace), released in May 1920; Turkish stamps overprinted with Œ•œÄŒ¨œÑŒ∑ ŒëœÅŒºŒøœÉœÑŒµŒØŒ± ŒòœÅŒ¨Œ∫Œ∑œÇ (High Commission of Thrace) and new values, released in July 1920; and Greek stamps from the three sets listed above, overprinted with ŒîŒπŒøŒØŒ∫Œ∑œÉŒπœÇ ŒòœÅŒ¨Œ∫Œ∑œÇ and released the same year. Royal Government ET issue (1916) During World War I, Greece was divided over the question of joining the Entente Powers or staying neutral (the National Schism). In October 1916 a pro-Entente group formed a separate, provisional government in Thessaloniki, led by Eleftherios Venizelos. The Athens government, to prevent them from using stamps already in circulation, ordered those stamps to be overprinted with the letters \\"ET\\" and the Greek crown. This overprint was applied to stamps from the \\"Engraved\\" and \\"Lithographic\\" sets, which were then issued on November 1, 1916.Scott, p. 315. Thessaloniki Provisional Government issue (1917) In response to the \\"ET\\" overprints, Venizelos' Provisional Government ordered the engraving and printing of a new set of stamps from Perkins, Bacon and Co. Their design was based on the Iris stamps from the 1911 issue, with the additional inscription Œ†Œ°ŒüŒ£Œ©Œ°ŒôŒùŒó ŒöŒ•ŒíŒïŒ°ŒùŒóŒ£ŒôŒ£ (Provisional Government). The set was lithographed on porous paper, with a perforation of 14¬Ω. It consisted of eleven values: 1 lepton, 5, 10, 25 and 50 lepta, 1 drachma and 2, 3, 5, 10 and 25 drachmae. A 4 drachmae value was also printed, but was only used as a revenue stamp.  1920s and 1930s   1922 Revolution overprints (1923)  In May 1923, the overprint ŒïŒ†ŒëŒùŒëŒ£Œ§ŒëŒ£ŒôŒ£ 1922 (Revolution of 1922) was applied to existing stamps of Crete and Greece, including the 1913 Campaign and 1917 Provisional Government issues. The overprint was in commemoration of the 1922 Revolution which led to the second abdication of King Constantine I, and was applied at the National Printing House in Athens.  Definitive issues  A new set of definitive stamps was issued on April 1, 1927. Its fourteen values (5, 10, 20, 25, 40, 50, and 80 lepta, 1 drachma and 2, 3, 10, 15 and 25 drachmae) depicted various landscapes and costumes of Greece, such as the Corinth Canal and the White Tower of Thessaloniki; therefore it was known as the \\"Landscapes set\\". A 1 lepton value was printed but never issued. The printing plates were manufactured by the firm Thomas McDonald of London and printing took place at Aspiotis Bros. Several later issues were intended to supplement this set; the 1933 Republic set (50, 75 and 100 drachmae), the 1934 Athens Stadium stamp (8 drachmae) and the 1935 Mystras stamp (4 drachmae). Between 1931 and 1935, the 50 lepta, 1 drachma, and 2, 3, 10, 15 and 25 drachmae values were re-issued. The set was withdrawn from circulation in 1939. A further definitive issue was released in the late 1930s. Known as the \\"Historical issue\\", it was issued in three phases. Its first phase, issued on November 1, 1937, was a set of four stamps which depicted King George II, including values of 1 drachma and 3, 8 and 100 drachmae. The 3 drachmae value represented the domestic postal rate, and the 8 drachmae value the international postal rate.Hellas 1, p. 157. On November 1, 1937 the second phase, devoted to Themes from the evolution of the Greek civilization,Hellas 1, p. 159. was issued. It consisted of thirteen values (5, 10, 20, 40, 50, and 80 lepta and 2, 5, 6, 7, 10, 15 and 25 drachmae) depicting important works of art and episodes in Greek history, such as the Venus de Milo, the Battle of Salamis and St. Paul preaching in Athens. The third phase was issued on October 8, 1938, to commemorate the unveiling of a statue of King Constantine I in Athens; it depicted that statue and consisted of two values (1.5 and 30 drachmae). The \\"Historical issue\\" was withdrawn from circulation in 1941 (the King George and King Constantine issues) and 1943 (the Greek civilization set).  Early airmail stamps (1926‚Äì1939) Greece's first airmail stamps, known as the \\"Patagonia set\\", were released in mid-October 1926.The release date is given as October 21 in the Hellas catalogue, October 20 in the Scott catalogue. They were intended for use on airmail letters from Greece to Italy and Turkey, and produced by the Italian firm Aero Espresso Italiana (AEI). The design, by A. Gavalas, depicted flying boats against various backgrounds. The set was printed in Milan, Italy, reputedly by the firm Bestetti & Tumminelli,Hellas 1, p. 459. and consisted of four values (2, 3, 5 and 10 drachmae). This issue remained in circulation until 1933, when it was replaced by the zeppelin and \\"Aeroespresso\\" issues, also produced by AEI. The zeppelin issue, consisting of three values (30, 100 and 120 drachmae), was issued May 2, 1933 and remained on sale until May 27. It was released in connection with the LZ 127 Graf Zeppelin's May 29 flight to Rome and depicted a zeppelin flying over the Acropolis of Athens. Its successor, the \\"Aeroespresso set\\", was released on October 10, 1933; its designs depicted flight-related themes. It was printed by Bradbury, Wilkinson & Co. of London and consisted of seven values (50 lepta, 1 drachma, 3, 5, 10, 20 and 50 drachmae). This set remained in circulation until 1935. All unsold stamps from these three sets were returned to AEI, who then placed them on the philatelic market.Hellas 1, pp. 459-61. On November 2, 1933 the Greek government, in conjunction with the Hellenic Aerial Communications Company, issued its own set of airmail stamps for general use. The plates were produced by Thomas De La Rue (UK) and the printing was done by Aspioti-ELKA. This set, depicting airplanes over various locations in Greece, consisted of seven values (50 lepta, 1 drachma, 2, 5, 10, 25 and 50 drachmae). After the \\"Aeroepresso\\" set was withdrawn from circulation in 1935, Greece issued a new set of nine airmail stamps. Called the \\"Mythological issue\\", its designs, by M. Biskinis, depicted figures from ancient Greek mythology like Daedalus and Icarus, Helios and Athena. As with the first government issue, the plates were produced by Thomas De La Rue and the printing done by Aspioti ELKA. It was released on November 10, 1935 and consisted of nine values (1 drachma, 2, 5, 7, 10, 25, 30, 50 and 100 drachmae). Due to vast growth in airmail correspondence in the mid-to-late 1930s, several values of this set (1 drachma, 2, 5, 7 and 10 drachmae) were re-issued in 1937 and 1939.  World War II (1940‚Äì1945) Definitive issues In April‚ÄìMay 1941, Greece came under Axis occupation, which lasted until October 1944. During this time, regular Greek stamps continued to be issued. A new definitive set depicting Greek landscapes including the Meteora monasteries and Aspropotamos River, intended to replace the 1937 \\"Historical issue\\", was released in two batches of nine. The first was issued in 1942 and consisted of 2, 5, 10, 15, 25, 50, 75, 100 and 200 drachmae values. Due to vastly increasing inflation later in the occupation period, the second batch, issued in 1944, bore higher values ranging from 500 to 5,000,000 drachmae. This set remained in circulation until November 11, 1944. On that date, to accompany a post-occupation money reform, three stamps from the \\"Historical\\" set (the 50 lepta and 2 and 5 drachmae values) were issued with the overprint ŒîŒ°ŒëŒßŒúŒëŒô ŒùŒïŒëŒô (New Drachmae). The new exchange rate was fixed at 50 billion old drachmae to 1 new drachma. In May 1945, the 6 drachma \\"Historical\\" value was issued with the same overprint. In 1945 a new set of eight definitives, the \\"Glory issue\\", was released. Intended to cover regular mail, airmail and international parcel post as well as replace the ŒîŒ°ŒëŒßŒúŒëŒô ŒùŒïŒëŒô set, it included values of 1 drachma, 3, 5, 10, 20, 50, 100 and 200 drachmae and was perforated 12¬Ω x 13¬Ω. This set was named for its depiction of Nikolaos Gysis' painting The Glory of Psara.Hellas 1, p. 172. During the occupation, Greek airmail was limited to two domestic routes; Athens-Thessaloniki and Athens-Heraklion. Foreign destinations were likewise restricted to Germany, Italy and certain Axis-occupied countries. At first, Greek postage due stamps were converted for airmail use by being overprinted with a small airplane design in red. However, these sold out rather quickly, creating the need for a new issue. A set of six values (2, 5, 10, 20, 25 and 50 drachmae) with designs by O. Perivolarakis depicting various Anemoi, or wind gods, was released on August 15, 1942. This set was re-printed in 1943, with three existing values (10, 25 and 50 drachmae) in different colors from the originals and three new values (100, 200 and 400 drachmae). Inflation rendered these stamps useless for mailing by April 1944; they were withdrawn from circulation in July. In the meantime, the use of regular stamps to cover airmail rates was allowed. Semi-Postal stamps Greece's first semi-postal stamps were produced during the occupation. The first, a set of three, was issued on October 3, 1943. It consisted of the following values and designs; 25 + 25 drachmae (portrait of a child), 100 + 50 drachmae (portrait of a mother and baby) and 200 + 100 drachmae (portrait of the Virgin Mary and infant Christ). Use of these stamps was mandatory on domestic mail through that month;Scott, p. 344. proceeds from their sale went toward the Patriotic Charity and Awareness Institution Fund, for use in children's welfare programs. A second semi-postal set of ten, consisting of 1942 definitives and 1944 airmail issues surcharged with ŒíŒüŒúŒíŒëŒ°ŒîŒôŒ£ŒúŒüŒ£ Œ†ŒïŒôŒ°ŒëŒôŒ©Œ£ 11-1-1944 ŒîŒ°. 100.000 (Bombardment of Piraeus 11-1-1944 dr. 100,000), was issued on June 11, 1944. This set's proceeds were used to aid the families of victims of the Allied bombardment of Piraeus in January 1944. It was withdrawn from circulation on June 30, 1944.Hellas 1, pp. 168-9. On July 20, 1944 a third set, also of ten and again using definitive and airmail stamps, was released. Its overprint read Œ†ŒëŒôŒîŒôŒöŒëŒô ŒïŒûŒüŒßŒëŒô ŒîŒ°Œß. 50.000 + 450.000 (Children's camps dr. 50,000 + 450,000); proceeds went toward the support of children's camps. This set was withdrawn from circulation on November 11, 1944.Hellas 1, pp. 169-70. National Resistance issues Resistance movements formed throughout Greece not long after its occupation. The two largest resistance groups, the National Liberation Front (E.A.M.) and the National Republican Greek League (E.D.E.S.), produced stamps for use in areas under their control - though few of them would actually be used postally. E.A.M.'s single issue, a set of eight consisting of eight values (1000, 2000, 4000, 6000, 8000, 10000, 25000 and 40000 drachmae) inscribed ŒïŒõŒïŒ•ŒòŒïŒ°Œó ŒïŒõŒõŒëŒîŒë (\\"Free Greece\\"), was produced on February 25, 1944. The set was never used, though some were cancelled with an E.A.M. handstamp. E.D.E.S. produced three sets, only one of which saw postal use. The first two, a set of five (values 15, 25, 50, 100 and 200 drachmae) and a single stamp (1000 drachmae) inscribed Free Greece, were produced in 1943 and July 1944 respectively; all were imperforate. Almost all stamps from their second issue were confiscated by the occupying Germans. The third set, which unlike the others was perforated, was produced on July 23. Issued to commemorate two years of E.D.E.S.' existence, it consisted of four values (2000, 4000, 6000 and 8000 drachmae). It was not placed on sale until November 25, 1944. This date marked the second anniversary of the Resistance's destruction of the Gorgopotamos railway bridge. To commemorate that event, the third E.D.E.S. issue was overprinted with ŒìŒüŒ°ŒìŒüŒ†ŒüŒ§ŒëŒúŒüŒ£ 25-11-1942 (Gorgopotamos 25-11-1942) and placed on sale for one day at the Ioannina post office with the condition that they would be attached to a cover. As Greece was gradually liberated from occupation in 1944, local overprints and new values on the 1942 definitives were used for mail in some of the newly freed areas; Lefkada, Lesbos, Agrinio and Preveza. Values on these overprinted issues ranged from 100,000 to 10,000,000 drachmae.Hellas 1, pp. 510-17.  Post-war definitive issues  In 1946-47 a new set of eighteen definitives, the \\"chain surcharges\\", was issued. Stamps from the 1937 \\"Historical issue\\" and 1942 definitives and airmail stamps were surcharged in red or black with the design of a closed chain and new values. Since then, Greece has released over twenty definitive issues with subjects including its culture, landscapes, mythology and royalty. Examples include the Dodecanese union set (twenty-three values released between 1947 and 1951), the Marshall Plan set (six values, 1951), the National products set (seven values, 1953), the ancient art series (1954‚Äì55, 1958‚Äì60), the ancient coins series (1959, 1963), the tourist publicity set (seventeen values, 1961), the King Paul set (ten values, 1964), the labors of Hercules set (eleven values, 1970), the national costumes series (1972‚Äì74), the Homer's epics set (fifteen values, 1983), the capitals of prefectures series (1988, 1990, 1992, 1994), the Greek dances set (2002) and the Greek islands series (2004, 2006). Greece's final set of airmail stamps, a set of seven depicting Greek harbors, was issued in 1958.Scott, p. 342. Commemorative stamps Starting with the 1896 Olympic issue, Greece has issued a number of commemorative stamps. Subjects depicted include political and military leaders, athletic events, ancient and modern Greek culture, archaeological discoveries, and wildlife. The \\"Anniversaries and events\\" set of March 15, 1982 marked the first contemporary use of the ŒïŒõŒõŒóŒùŒôŒöŒó ŒîŒóŒúŒüŒöŒ°ŒëŒ§ŒôŒë-HELLAS inscription. A brief survey of Greek commemoratives: * Europa - Beginning in 1960, Greece has issued yearly commemoratives as part of the Europa stamp program.

Charity stamps Charity stamp, \\"K.Œ†.\\" overprint on revenue stamp (1917) Charity stamps benefiting various foundations were issued between 1914 and 1956. The first, a set of two from 1914 depicted the allegorical figure \\"The Tragedy of War\\". Its values were 2 and 5 lepta; proceeds went to the National Welfare Foundation. Other early issues included a 5 lepta stamp for the Greek Women's Patriotic League, released in 1915 and depicting the League's badge, and several for the Red Cross Fund. Issued in 1915, 1918 and 1924, their designs included the Red Cross symbol along with nurses and wounded soldiers. The 1918 issue was also released with the overprint \\"Œ†.Œô.Œ†.\\" (Patriotic Relief Institution); proceeds went to the Greek Patriotic League. During the National Schism of 1917, the Athens government ordered the surcharge \\"K.Œ†.\\" and new values applied to Flying Mercury, Campaign and revenue stamps. At first, this only applied to those parts of Greece they controlled; for a short time after the Schism ended, use of these surcharged stamps was extended to the whole country. In 1939, a set of three (10 and 50 lepta and 1 drachma) which depicted Queens Olga and Sophia was released. A number of charity stamps were produced to benefit postal workers; initially proceeds went to the Postal Clerks' Tuberculosis Fund, to aid postal workers suffering from that disease. Later, starting in 1946, they were applied to the Postal Clerks' Welfare Fund. The first issue, a set of three (10, 20 and 50 lepta) depicting the goddess Hygeia, was released in 1934. It was re-released in 1935, with the inscription ŒïŒõŒõŒëŒ£ added at the top of each stamp. Use of these stamps was obligatory on all mail during four weeks of the year, including Christmas, Easter and the New Year, and year-round on parcel post packages.Scott, p. 343. The 50 lepta stamp from the 1935 set was re-issued in 1939 with different colors; in 1941, Hygeia stamps were released with a surcharge of 50 lepta. In addition, from 1940 to 1945, surcharges and new values were applied to stamps from the 1927 Landscapes set, the \\"Historical issue\\", the 1939 charity set and 1942 definitives. Other charity stamps included the Thessaloniki International Fair Fund issue, a 20 lepta stamp from 1934 which depicted St. Demetrius; its use was obligatory on domestic mail from Thessaloniki. It was re-issued with a 1 drachma surcharge in 1942. St. Demetrius was also depicted on a 50 drachmae charity stamp released in 1948; proceeds from its sale went toward the restoration of historic sites and churches destroyed during World War II. Later issues included a 1953 set of two (300 and 500 drachmae) to raise funds for reconstruction in the Ionian Islands after an earthquake and a 1956 set of two (50 lepta and 1 drachma) for the Macedonian Studies Society Fund, to help finance archaeological studies in the region.  Postal stationery  5 lepta Flying Mercury postal stationery card with added 5 lepta Flying Mercury stamp. Mailed from Volos to Germany, 1910. The first items of postal stationery to be issued by Greece were postcards in 1876, post paid envelopes and Lettercards were issued in 1894 followed by newspaper wrappers in 1901. Aerogrammes were first issued in 1967. Postcards and aerogrammes continue to be available to this day. The last issue of envelopes was in 1941. Three different values of newspaper wrappers were issued in 1901, in 1911 one new newspaper wrapper was issued and no further newspaper wrappers were issued after this date.Higgins & Gage World Postal Stationery Catalog Imprints on newspaper wrappers - 1, 2 and 5 lepta of the 1901 issue and 1 lepta of the 1911 issue See also * Hellenic Post *Hellenic Philotelic Society *Postage stamps and postal history of Crete *Postage stamps and postal history of Epirus  References and sources  ;Notes ;Sources   * Further reading * Academie Europeenne de Philatelie.

It is formed by the Lahontan Dam, built in 1905 by the Bureau of Reclamation as part of the Newlands Reclamation Act and is located between Fallon, Nevada and Carson City, Nevada. The flows from the Carson River is augmented by the diversions from the Truckee River. The reservoir is maintained by the Truckee-Carson Irrigation District (TCID). The lake is named after ancient Lake Lahontan, which covered much of northwestern Nevada during the last ice age. Lake Lahontan is 17 miles (27 km) long and has 69 miles (111 km) of shoreline. It consists of several lobes connected by narrow straits. When full, it has approximately 10,000 acres (40 km¬≤) of surface area, although it is usually less than half full by late summer. As no water rights have been allocated for recreation, the TCID could completely drain the lake to supply its irrigation customers. Submerged beneath the water were parts of stagecoach routes which existed during the 1800s including Williams Station, the scene of the Battle of Williams Station, a minor skirmish during the Paiute War. A small settlement called \\"Lahontan\\" once stood near the reservoir, which in 1940 the Federal Writers' Project reported had a population of 25. Recreation The lake sits within the Lahontan State Recreation Area. Recreational uses include fishing, pleasure boating and camping. Much of the shoreline is sandy and makes for good camping. As it is contaminated with mercury from the Comstock and other mines, consumption of fish from the lake should be limited as per posted guidelines. Primary game fish include wipers (white bass x striper hybrid), white bass, walleye, channel catfish, white catfish, largemouth bass, spotted bass, and crappie. It is stocked with walleye fry and fingerling wipers nearly every year. The best fishing occurs from April through July and October. Variations The Carson River enters the lake at its southwestern end. The lake is very shallow there, and the shoreline can vary drastically as the lake empties and fills. The Derby Dam diverts part of the Truckee River into the Truckee Canal which enters the lake at the northeastern end,Joseph I. Burns and Michael C. Archer. The Truckee Canal: A transbasin Diversion From The Truckee River Basin To The Carson River Basin immediately adjacent to the Lahontan dam. During the 2017 California floods, the highest inflow in history filled the lake, and a weir was made to handle outflow. Oversized culverts were quickly put under US95 and lined with ripraps to let the water cross the road and protect Fallon from flooding.

Biography Carey was born in Pittsburgh and raised in Butler, Pennsylvania as Josephine Vicari and would later change her name at the suggestion of her television station's general manager. Carey was the host of Pittsburgh's children show, The Children's Corner on WQED from 1953 to 1961. Carey was one of the station's original employees, beginning work there in October 1953 -- six months before WQED actually started broadcasting. She went door-to-door, raising money for the station selling $2 educational program guides. Carey was partnered with Fred Rogers who would act as puppeteer of various puppets who would dance along to 68 songs which he wrote and for which Carey wrote the lyrics. Carey joined ASCAP in 1955 and she and Rogers produced such songs as \\"Goodnight God,\\" \\"It's Morning,\\" and \\"Why Hi, Don't I Know You?\\" -- the theme song for her program. Carey once remarked on their collaboration, \\"He would make me very angry because I'd labor over my lyrics and he would sit at the piano and what took me four hours, he would do in four minutes.\\" Carey wrote the lyrics to \\"Tomorrow,\\" which Rogers sang at the end of each Mister Rogers' Neighborhood episode until 1972.https://sites.google.com/site/pittsburghmusichistory/pittsburgh-music- story/pop/josie-carey The puppet characters included Daniel S. Tiger, the skunk Grandp√©re, King Friday XIII of Calendarland, his wife Lady Elaine, the owl X.Scape and Henrietta the cat. The Children's Corner was syndicated on NBC for 39 weeks and won a Sylvania Award in 1955 for the best locally produced children's program in the country. The Children's Corner debuted puppet characters who would go on to future fame on Mister Rogers' Neighborhood; characters like King Friday XIII (who would dub four children \\"Prince\\" or \\"Princess\\" during the birthday greetings segment of the Children's Corner) and Daniel Striped Tiger, who was named after WQED's first general manager, Dorothy Daniel. The program also featured a wide range of human guests, including Johnny Carson, Shirley Jones, Van Cliburn, and Charles Schulz. After her show was cancelled, Carey went on to host other children's programming, including Josie's Storyland and Funsville, which were aired on KDKA-TV in Pittsburgh; Wheee! in South Carolina in the 1970s; and most recently, Josie's Attic during the 1990s on WQEX in Pittsburgh. In 2000, Carey was interviewed by the Academy of Television Arts & Sciences for its archives in North Hollywood. She continued to perform, act, and direct in Pittsburgh community theater until her death, which resulted from complications from a fall, at the age of 73.

It is based on the principle that consent requires the ability to withhold consent in an election, just as they can by voting \\"No\\" on ballot questions. Entities that include \\"None of the Above\\" on ballots as standard procedure include India (\\"None of the above\\"), Greece (ŒªŒµœÖŒ∫œå, white), the U.S. state of Nevada (None of These Candidates), Ukraine (–ü—Ä–æ—Ç–∏ –≤—Å—ñ—Ö, \\"against all\\"), Belarus, Spain (voto en blanco, \\"white vote\\"), North Korea and Colombia (voto en blanco). Russia had such an option on its ballots (–ü—Ä–æ—Ç–∏–≤ –≤—Å–µ—Ö, \\"against all\\") until it was abolished in 2006. Bangladesh introduced this option (\\"‡¶®‡¶æ ‡¶≠‡ßã‡¶ü\\" , \\"No Vote\\") in 2008. Pakistan introduced this option on ballot papers for the 2013 Pakistan elections, but the Election Commission of Pakistan later rejected it. Beginning with the 2016 presidential election, Bulgaria introduced a 'none of the above' option, which received 5.59% of the vote in the first round and 4.47% in the run-off. When \\"None of the Above\\" is listed on a ballot, there is the possibility of NOTA receiving a majority or plurality of the vote, and so \\"winning\\" the election. In such a case, a variety of formal procedures may be invoked, including having the office remain vacant , having the office filled by appointment, re-opening nominations or holding another election (in a body operating under parliamentary procedure), or it may have no effect, as in India and the US state of Nevada, where the next highest total wins regardless. Soviet Union In the 1990 elections that led to the break-up of the Soviet Union, the Soviet version of \\"none of above\\" led to new elections with new candidates in 200 races of the 1,500-seat Congress of People's Deputies. More than 100 incumbents representing the Communist Party of the Soviet Union were defeated in the run-off, leading to Boris Yeltsin to later say the \\"none of the above\\" option \\"helped convince the people they had real power even in a rigged election, and [it] played a role in building true democracy.\\" Spain Blank ballot Due to the Spanish voting regulations (legislaci√≥n electoral espa√±ola), the blank ballot is recognized as 'none of the above' (voto en blanco) but has very little chance to influence the distribution of seats within a democratic election. It is mostly considered as a statistical indicator of candidatures' disapproval. The blank ballots only increase the amount of valid votes, raising the threshold of votes (3% and 5% depending on the election) which every political party has to overcome to be fully considered. The parties over the threshold get their seats according to the D'Hondt method. Blank seats (Esca√±os en blanco) Since 1999, several political parties have arisen in order to make visible the 'none of the above' option in the parliaments and force empty seats. \\"Blank Seats\\" ran for the Congress and Senate elections of 20 November 2011. Its programme is to leave empty the corresponding assigned seats by not taking full possession of their duties as congressperson, senator, etc. According to law, the seat remains assigned to the elected candidate until the possession act takes place, the elected candidate explicitly refuses or new elections are called. In this way, the political party and its candidates stay free from obligations and are not entitled to receive any money from the public funding scheme for politics. By voting such option at the local elections in May 2011, the citizens of the villages of Gironella (Barcelona) and Foix√† (Girona) were able to reduce the number of politicians in their councils by one and two respectively. Overall, citizenship supported Blank Seats at different municipalities, including Barcelona, with 15,582 votes (averaging 1.71% of valid votes). The Ciudadanos En Blanco (Citizens for Blank Votes) party aims to give blank ballots the meaning of representing empty seats if the votes indicate so as for any other party, disbanding the party when such law would be approved. United States The origins of the ballot option \\"None of the Above\\" in the United States can be traced to when the State of Nevada adopted \\"None of These Candidates\\" as a ballot option in 1976. In 1998 in California, citizen proponents of Proposition 23, titled the \\"None of the Above Act\\", qualified a new State ballot initiative through circulated petitions submitted to the Secretary of State, but the measure was defeated in the March 2000 general election 64% to 36%. Were it to be passed by the voters, it was meant to require this new ballot option for all state and federal elective offices, exempting only local judicial races; in determining official election results, the \\"none of the above\\" voter tally would be discarded in favor of the candidate with the greatest number of votes. No similar options were known to have been permitted, much less approved, on any other state levels, least of all the federal level, as of the middle of August 2016. India Symbol used with NOTA option on ballot papers and electronic voting machines in India The Election Commission of India told the Supreme Court in 2009 that it wished to offer the voter a \\"none of the above\\" option on ballots, which the government had generally opposed. The People's Union for Civil Liberties, a non- governmental organisation, filed a public-interest litigation statement in support of this. On 27 September 2013, the Supreme Court of India ruled that the right to register a \\"none of the above\\" vote in elections should apply, and ordered the Election Commission to provide such a button in the electronic voting machines, noting that it would increase participation. The Election Commission also clarified that even though votes cast as NOTA are counted, they are considered as invalid votes so they will not change the outcome of the election process. They are not taken into account for calculating the total valid votes and will not be considered for determining the forfeiture of deposit. In the 2014 general election, NOTA polled 1.1% of the votes, counting to over 6,000,000. The specific symbol for NOTA, a ballot paper with a black cross across it, was introduced on 18 September 2015. The symbol is designed by National Institute of Design, Ahmedabad. Indonesia A sample ballot for the uncontested 2018 mayoral elections in thumb The Indonesian Law 10 of 2016 regulates local elections, and includes provisions for elections in which there is only one candidate. In such cases, the candidate contests the election against a NOTA option (commonly referred to as kotak kosong/empty box), and is declared the winner if they manage to secure a majority of the valid votes. Otherwise, the election will be postponed to the next occurrence; the government of Indonesia appoints an acting office holder until the new election, in which the losing candidate is eligible to stand again. There were 3 uncontested seats in the 2015 local elections, nine in the 2017 local elections, and at least 13 in the 2018 local elections (including the mayoral elections for Tangerang and Makassar). In the 2018 election for mayor of Makassar, the NOTA option received over 300,000 votes, 35,000 more than the sole candidate, forcing a repeat election in 2020. United Kingdom UK electoral counting procedures require that all votes be counted and announced, including 'rejected' votes. 'Rejected votes' are classified into four categories, protest votes are recorded with others rejected as 'voter's intention uncertain'. NOTA UK NOTA UK is a voluntary organisation set up in 2010 to campaign for a formal None Of The Above (NOTA) option to be added to ballot papers for all future UK elections. It has made numerous written evidence submissions to the parliamentary Political & Constitutional Reform Committee (PCRC) making the case for NOTA 'with teeth' i.e.: formalised consequences for the election result in the event of a NOTA 'win' (as opposed to 'faux' NOTA, whereby the next placed candidate takes office anyway as happens in India and elsewhere). As a result of these representations, the PCRC explicitly recommended in its final report on 'voter engagement', published February 2015, that the next UK government should hold a public consultation before May 2016 solely on inclusion of NOTA on UK ballot papers. This in turn has led to increased support for and awareness of NOTA UK's campaign and its founder, recording artist and music producer Jamie Stanley (aka: Mailman), being asked to give a number of media interviews. No public consultation materialised as the incoming Conservative government scrapped the PCRC, effectively disregarding all of its recommendations. Since 2015, in part thanks to NOTA UK's lobbying, it has been a Green Party of England and Wales policy to get a form of NOTA (RON - Re-Open Nominations) on UK ballot papers. In the run-up to the 2017 UK general election, NOTA UK wrote to the Green party suggesting that they should reword the policy so that, instead of RON, it refers specifically to the more self-explanatory NOTA, and that they should also place the policy centre stage in their next manifesto. Above and Beyond The party's logo The Above and Beyond Party was founded in 2015 and fielded eight candidates in the 2015 general election, none of whom were elected. Their sole stated policy was to introduce a \\"none of the above\\" option on all UK ballot papers. The party's logo is based on the West African Adinkra symbol \\"Aya\\", \\"derived from a fern tree which famously grows in difficult-to-survive places\\", and a symbol of resilience. Critics pointed out that their website and Facebook page at the time indicated that they had policy ideas and a political agenda beyond the single issue of NOTA and appeared to be jumping on the bandwagon of other NOTA campaigns. =Inception and officers= The party registered with the Electoral Commission on 18 March 2015. The Electoral Commission listed the party leader, nominating officer and campaigns officer as Mark Flanagan and the treasurer was Karen Stanley. The party chairman was Michael Ross. The party was de-registered by the Electoral Commission on 3 November 2016. =Electoral history= Above and Beyond fielded four candidates in the 2015 general election. The candidates stood in Clwyd West, Cheadle, Sheffield Central and Leeds North West. In Sheffield Hallam the party endorsed Carlton Reeve, an independent candidate. No Above and Beyond candidate received 5% or more of the votes cast, therefore all lost their deposit. =Finance= The party raised funds partially through \\"AboveBeyond\\" music nights. No Candidate Deserves My Vote! party No Candidate Deserves My Vote! was registered as a political party with the UK Electoral Commission on 23 November 2000. The No Candidate Deserves My Vote party's single objective is to introduce a bill to Parliament to have a \\"none of the above\\" option added to every local and general election ballot paper of the future. They feel this will allow the UK electorate to exercise their democratic right to vote to say that none of the parties currently represents them, which will encourage their democratic responsibility to turn out to vote. If a candidate wins an election it is the intention to stay as a Member of Parliament until the change in the law is enacted. Only then will the candidate step down and the party be disbanded. It is the intention of the party that, if a NOTA gains the majority vote, it should cause an automatic by-election, the idea being that the majority will have given a Vote of No Confidence in the candidates. If the same candidates stand under the same policies, then the electorate simply votes NOTA until the candidates change their policies to something that the electorate can vote for. In 2010, Stephen Phillips of Stevenage ran for the UK general election on behalf of No Candidate Deserves My Vote. Phillips received 327 votes, or 0.7% of the vote, placing 7th out of 9 candidates. NOTA party The NOTA Party, in recent years also known as Notavote, was registered as a political party with the UK Electoral Commission on 2 March 2009. It was the intention of the NOTA party to field candidates in every UK parliamentary constituency. The respective NOTA candidates would not have continued in office had they received the most votes, this was merely a mechanism to simulate the recording of a formal NOTA vote. The party was registered as 'NOTA' and not 'None of the Above' as the latter is a prohibited expression regarding registration as a party name. A subsequent attempt to re-register the NOTA party in 2014 was blocked by the Electoral Commission on the grounds that the acronym 'NOTA' is as good as the phrase 'None of the Above', the logic being that it would confuse voters into thinking it is possible to cast a formal vote for 'None of the Above' when they would in fact just be voting for another party, albeit one standing on a single issue NOTA platform. Zero, None Of the Above None Of The Above Zero was a candidate at the 2010 general election in Filton and Bradley Stoke. Previously known as Eric Mutch, he changed his name by deed poll to stand under that name. As candidates are listed by surname first he appeared on the ballot paper as \\"Zero, None Of The Above\\", in effect giving voters a none of the above option since had he been elected he would have resigned immediately. He came last with 172 votes. Others In the British parliamentary elections of 2010, a former boxer changed his name by deed poll from Terry Marsh to \\"None Of The Above X\\", in order to run as a parliamentary candidate under that name in the constituency of South Basildon and East Thurrock. Claiming that he will not take the seat if he wins, he told BBC Essex: \\"I don't take it for one moment that it would be a vote for me. [..] I'm doing what I think the Electoral Commission should be doing and what should be on every ballot paper in any electoral process.\\" BBC News reported that, while the Registration of Political Parties (Prohibited Words and Expressions) (Amendment) Order 2005 stipulates that no political party can be registered in the UK under the name \\"None of the Above\\", there is no legislation against a person changing their name by deed poll and appearing on the ballot paper as \\"None Of the Above\\".Basildon boxer to fight election as 'None Of The Above', BBC News, (27 April 2010) In the event he polled 0.3% of the vote, the lowest of any candidate standing. * Another individual changed his name by deed poll to \\"None Of The Above\\" in order to stand as a candidate in Chingford and Woodford Green in 2010. With the surname Above, he was listed first on the ballot paper in alphabetical order, with all the other candidates listed below. * The South Wales Anarchists group has run a campaign urging people to \\"Vote Nobody\\" since 2008 and many other anarchist groups worldwide have promoted similar slogans. * The Landless Peasant Party, which advocates the ownership of land by those who live on it and the replacement of income tax by a flat land tax, and whose leader Derek Jackson gained publicity for standing against then- Prime Minister Gordon Brown in his home constituency in the 2010 elections, include a pledge to add a \\"None of the above\\" option to the ballot in all UK elections. Canada No electoral jurisdiction in Canada formally lists \\"none of the above\\" as a ballot option. However, in some provincial elections it is effectively possible to vote for \\"none of the above\\", by attending the polling station and formally \\"declining to vote\\". These declined votes are actually counted and become part of the electoral record. A businessman in Prince George, British Columbia ran in the 1997 federal election in the district of Prince George‚ÄîBulkley Valley under the name Zznoneoff, Thea Bove (Thea Bove Zznoneoff); ballots listing candidates alphabetically by surname, he appeared at the bottom. He came sixth of seven candidates with 0.977 percent of votes cast. A resident of Oshawa, Ontario, formerly known as Sheldon Bergson, has legally changed his name to \\"Above Znoneofthe\\",\\"Voters can pick 'none of the above' thanks to this Whitby-Oshawa byelection candidate\\". CBC News Toronto, 29 January 2016. and has registered under that name as a candidate in several provincial and federal by-elections, most recently the Markham‚ÄîThornhill by-election of 3 March 2017. His name order was chosen so that his name would always appear at the bottom of the ballot as \\"Znoneofthe, Above\\", although this only works federally as provincial election ballots do not list the candidates in surname order.\\"Meet Above Znoneofthe, the fringe candidate who keeps running in Ontario by- elections\\". National Post, 21 November 2016. In Ontario, the None of the Above Party of Ontario is a registered political party, although its stated mandate is for its candidates to serve in the legislature as independent representatives who reflect the views and interests of their constituents, rather than simply as a \\"reject all of the candidates\\" placeholder. Norway The Norwegian election regulation makes it mandatory to present voters with blank ballots in addition to all of the approved parties and election lists. In the parliamentary election of 2013, 12874 votes, which is 0.45% of the total votes given, were blank. None of the Above candidates and parties in other countries * In Serbia, None of the above (–ù–∏—ò–µ–¥–∞–Ω –æ–¥ –ø–æ–Ω—É—í–µ–Ω–∏—Ö –æ–¥–≥–æ–≤–æ—Ä–∞, –ù–û–ü–û) is a parliamentary political party, legally formed in 2010, which was mostly popularized on Facebook and less on other social networking websites. In 2012 Serbian parliamentary election they received 22,905 votes, and thus won one seat in the National Assembly of Serbia. * Geoff Richardson changed his full name to \\"Of The Above None\\" and stood as an independent for the seat of Gilmore at the 2007 Australian federal election. His name appeared as NONE, Of the Above on the ballot. * In 2010 Ukrainian presidential election, a candidate Vasiliy Humeniuk changed his name to Vasily Protyvsih (Vasily Against-all). \\"Against all candidates\\" is the name of the \\"none of the above\\" vote used in Russia and Ukraine.CEC registers two more candidates for Ukraine's president , Interfax-Ukraine (6 November 2009)Three candidates united by disgust with authorities, Kyiv Post (19 November 2009) * In 2000, Michael Moore advocated a write-in candidate Ficus (the plant) for Congress as a unified vote for none of the above in congressional seats where the incumbent was running unopposed. * David Gatchell of Tennessee ran for governor in 2002 and for Senate in 2006 as a protest, officially changing his middle name from Leroy to None of the Above. In 2006, he got 3,738 votes (0.2 percent). * For the 2013 Pakistani general election, the Election Commission of Pakistan unilaterally decided that a 'none of the above' box would be available as a voting option on ballot papers. However, they subsequently decided against it owing to the short amount of time remaining till the elections. The concept was suggested to the Election Commission by Abid Hassan Manto, a constitutional expert and a senior lawyer of the Supreme Court of Pakistan. * Elections in South Ossetia have an \\"against all\\" option. * Elections in Abkhazia have an \\"None of the above\\" option. Procedures that function like \\"none of the above\\" Most ballots do not have a formal \\"none of the above\\" option, but do have procedures that work in a similar way.  Argentina  In Argentina casting an envelope without a ballot in a ballot box counts as a blank vote. Poland In 1989 legislative election in Poland voters were able to vote against the only candidate running, often from the ruling Polish United Workers' Party by crossing out the candidate's name on the ballot. As a result, voters defeated the sitting prime minister and dozens of leading Communists because they failed to get the required majority. Re-open Nominations (RON) Many students' unions in Britain, Ireland, and others use a similar ballot option called 're-open nominations' (RON) in IRV and single transferable vote (STV) elections. These include the National Union of Students in the UK and UCD Student's Union in Ireland. The difference is that RON is a vote against all candidates in FPTP (first-past-the-post) and all subsequent candidates in an IRV or STV election. RON is not strictly a none of the above candidate in transferable vote elections, as when RON is eliminated during the count its votes are transferred to other candidates if those preferences exist. Illegal ballots in Robert's Rules of Order The American Robert's Rules of Order, Newly Revised (RONR) describes various forms of illegal ballots, which are ballots which do not count for any candidate. Blanks are treated as \\"scrap paper\\", and are of no effect, but \\"unintelligible ballots or ballots cast for an unidentifiable candidate or a fictional character are treated as illegal votes. All illegal votes cast by legal voters‚Ä¶ are taken into account in determining the number of votes cast for purposes of computing the majority.\\" RONR always requires a majority for election; thus, casting an illegal ballot or one for a hopeless candidate, whether on the ballot or as a write-in, is equivalent to voting No for all other candidates. \\"The principle is that a choice has no mandate from the voting body unless approval is expressed by more than half of those entitled to vote and registering any evidence of having some opinion.\\"  No award  Voting for the Hugo Awards is by instant runoff voting, in which nominees for a category are ranked. There are normally seven options: six nominees, plus \\"No Award\\". A first preference vote for no award implies that the voter believes that either the category should be abolished, or that none of the nominees are worthy of an award. A second or subsequent preference implies that any higher-ranked nominees are worthy of an award, while those ranked lower are not. Cultural references * In the film Brewster's Millions, the protagonist Brewster (played by Richard Pryor) is required, under certain conditions, to spend 30 million dollars in 30 days. He joins the race for Mayor of New York City and throws most of his money at a protest campaign urging a vote for None of the Above. The two major candidates sue Brewster for his confrontational rhetoric, leading to a massive settlement which of course furthers their competitor's goal. Brewster is forced to end his campaign when he learns that he is leading in the polls as a write-in candidate and has to publicly announce that he if he won the mayoralty he wants to decline it but is surprised his \\"None of the Above\\" campaign became so popular. Neither candidate wins the election, and a new election with different candidates must be held. * In the sixth-season episode of Captain Planet called \\"Dirty Politics\\" three of the Eco-Villains are running for president and kidnap the fourth candidate, who is the most popular. Despite this over seventy percent vote None of the Above resulting in the need for a new election. * L. Neil Smith's novel The Probability Broach has an alternate history in which the United States becomes a libertarian state after a successful Whiskey Rebellion and the overthrowing and execution of George Washington by firing squad for treason in 1794, where None of the Above (which is always an option on the ballot) has received the most votes for President of the North American Confederacy on two occasions. The first time was in 1968, defeating Lucy Kropotkin by only one vote and would serve until 1972 as the NAC's 24th President. The second time was in 2000 and again in 2004 and being elected \\"President for Life\\" in 2008, serving as the 28th President and essentially abolishing the office of the presidency. * Wavy Gravy has run a \\"Nobody for President\\" campaign during several different election years in the United States.

This person usually has the highest level of skill within a specific technical field.  Software  In software development, a technical director is typically responsible for the successful creation and delivery of the company's product to the marketplace by managing technical risks and opportunities; making key software design and implementation decisions with the development teams, scheduling of tasks including tracking dependencies, managing change requests, and guaranteeing quality of deliveries and educating the team on technical best practices. Typical responsibilities: * Defines the technological strategy in conjunction with the development team of each project: pipeline, tools, and key development procedures * Assesses technical risk and mitigation plan * Establishes standards and procedures to track and measure project's progression * Evaluates development teams, identifying strengths, problem areas, and developing plans for improving performance * Evaluates interview candidates for technical positions * Scouts for and evaluates new technology and tools as opportunities for innovation and development excellence * Oversees technical design documentation process for correctness and timeliness * Provides input to the other disciplines on the practicality of initial design goals and impact to the overall project timeline * Evaluates software implementation on design and task thoroughness * Helps to identify high risk areas for the project director * Identifies weak software systems that need code improvement and schedules corrective action, when possible * Creates automated test process for system features, where possible, and contributes to the build system * Aids in all stages of post- production including during finalizing  Film and games  In visual effects (VFX) (Industrial Light and Magic, Sony Pictures Imageworks), feature animation (Pixar, Dreamworks Animation) and game development (Naughty Dog), a technical director's responsibilities vary from studio to studio and as such, the term is not very well defined. Typically, a TD is a combination of an artist and a programmer, responsible for the more technical aspects of film production, such as programming shaders, developing character rigs and animation setups, performing complex simulation tasks and setting up the pipeline (how the data is passed from one stage in the film production to the next). In contrast to a programmer, a TD would normally not work on large programming projects, but rather make heavy use of scripting languages such as Python, MEL, MAXScript, or shell scripting. Another responsibility of a TD is to look after any technical problems the regular artists encounter and to develop custom tools to improve the artists' workflow. In these industries, \\"technical artist\\", \\"technical animator\\" and \\"generalist TD\\" are sometimes used as synonyms. Categorization of technical directors in film and games Frequently, the role of a TD is more precisely defined. Various areas of computer graphics require a high degree of specialized technical/scientific knowledge and therefore merit more precise categorization. As an example, a skilled Character TD has a strong understanding of human/animal anatomy, movement, and mechanics, whereas a skilled Lighting TD might have a detailed understanding of the physical properties of light and surfaces. Those categories include (but are not limited to) the following. * Effects TD * Lighting TD * Modeling TD * Pipeline TD * Layout TD * Creature TD or Character TD * Hair TD * Cloth TD * Matchmove TD  Theatre  It is a technical director's job to make sure the technical equipment in the theater is functional, maintained and safe. The technical director, along with the production manager, is responsible for the overall organization of the technical production process. Duties included are generating necessary working drawings for construction (in conjunction with a draftsperson, if there is one); budget estimations and maintaining of accounts; materials research and purchasing; scheduling and supervising build crews; coordinating load-ins; handling conflicts that arise between different departments; and organizing the strike and clean-up for the production. Often, the Technical Director can serve as the head of the scenic department, supervising the master carpenter, carpenters, charge artists and leading them in the realization of the scenic designer's vision. In venues that host touring productions, the TD may also be responsible for advancing the technical rider, hiring local crew, renting equipment and liaising between the tour manager and the local crew.  Television  The technical director works in a production control room of a television studio and operates the video switcher and associated devices as well as serving as the chief of the television crew. For a remote broadcast outside the studio, the TD will perform the same duties in a mobile production truck. It is the TD's job to ensure all positions are manned and all equipment and facilities are checked out and ready before the recording session or live broadcast begins. They typically will switch video sources, perform live digital effects and transitions, and insert pre-recorded material, graphics and titles as instructed by the Television director. In larger productions, the director does not actually operate the production equipment, allowing him/her to coordinate the production and make rapid decisions without worrying about how to mechanically execute the effect or camera move being called for. The technical director may provide training to more inexperienced members of the technical crew when needed. In consultation with the director, the TD may have more or less input into the creative side of the production, depending on the situation. He/she may provide the director with guidance on crew assignments, camera shots and the most efficient way to accomplish any given effect. The TD is usually responsible for the technical quality of the signal being recorded or broadcast and will use various measuring devices and displays to ensure quality control. Technical directors commonly work on productions that are either broadcast live or recorded on video tape or video servers. Television productions shot on film generally do not use TDs, as the camera cuts and effects are realized in post production after the shooting is completed. The terminology in the UK differs in some respects from the above description: The production control room is called a \\"gallery\\", a mobile production truck is called an \\"OB van\\" or a \\"scanner\\" (a BBC term). In UK television practice, the technical director is the senior technical person in the gallery and supervises the technical team, but does not operate the \\"vision mixer\\". The TD is responsible for ensuring that the gallery is technically fit for purpose, the routing of internal and external sources, as well as liaison with other technical areas such as master control rooms and transmission suites. They may additionally perform vision control duties, matching the exposure and colour balance of the cameras (\\"racking\\").

DRR is, like weighted fair queuing (WFQ), a packet-based implementation of the ideal Generalized Processor Sharing (GPS) policy. It was proposed by M. Shreedhar and G. Varghese in 1995 as an efficient (with O(1) complexity) and fair algorithm.  Details  In DRR, a scheduler handling N flows is configured with one quantum Q_i for each flow. This global idea is that, at each round, the flow i can send at most Q_i bytes, and the remaining, if any, is reported to the next round. In this way, the flow of number will achieve a minimal long term data rate of \\\\frac{Q_i}{(Q_1+Q_2+...+Q_N)}R, where R is the link rate. Algorithm The DRR scans all non empty queues in sequence. When a non empty queue i is selected, its deficit counter is incremented by its quantum value. Then, the value of the deficit counter is a maximal amount of bytes that can be sent at this turn: if the deficit counter is greater than the packet's size at the head of the queue (HoQ), this packet can be sent and the value of the counter is decremented by the packet size. Then, the size of the next packet is compared to the counter value, etc. Once the queue is empty or the value of the counter is insufficient, the scheduler will skip to the next queue. If the queue is empty, the value of the deficit counter is reset to 0. Variables and Constants const integer N // Nb of queues const integer Q[1..N] // Per queue quantum integer DC[1..N] // Per queue deficit counter queue queue[1..N] // The queues Scheduling Loop while true do for i in 1..N do if not queue[i].empty() then DC[i]:= DC[i] + Q[i] while( not queue[i].empty() and DC[i] ‚â• queue[i].head().size() ) do DC[i] := DC[i] ‚àí queue[i].head().size() send( queue[i].head() ) queue[i].dequeue() end while if queue[i].empty() then DC[i] := 0 end if end if end for end while  Performances: fairness, complexity Like other GPS-like scheduling algorithm, the choice of the weights is left to the network administrator. Like WFQ, DRR offers a minimal rate to each flow whatever the size of the packets is. In weighted round robin scheduling, the fraction of bandwidth used depend on the packet's sizes. Compared with WFQ scheduler that has complexity of O(log(n)) (n is the number of active flows/queues), the complexity of DRR is O(1), if the quantum Q_i is larger than the maximum packet size of this flow. Nevertheless, this efficiency has a cost: the latency, i.e. the distance to the ideal GPS, is larger in DRR than in WFQ.  Implementations  An implementation of the deficit round robin algorithm was written by Patrick McHardy for the Linux kernel and published under the GNU General Public License. In Cisco and Juniper routers, modified versions of DRR are implemented: since the latency of DRR can be larger for some class of traffic, these modified versions give higher priority to some queues, whereas the others are served with the standard DRR algorithm.

It featured daily editorial content on a great variety of topics, including politics and pop-culture. It was geared towards a Generation X audience. The website's motto was \\"A fish, a barrel, and a smoking gun\\". Despite not publishing new content since 2001, the site remained online until December 2018. The site Suck.com was initiated during 1995 by writer Joey Anuff and editor Carl Steadman who created daily comically cynical commentary with a self-obsessed and satiric theme. The writing was accentuated by the art of cartoonist Terry Colon. During 1996, they included the writing talent of Heather Havrilesky, who provided the sarcastic comments of her supposed alter ego Polly Esther in their column, titled Filler. The name of the website was chosen as a domain name with possibly offensive connotations though apparently not enough to be disallowed by Network Solutions, which controlled the InterNIC system for the distribution of domain names before ICANN acquired that authority. The name also described the nature of \\"news aggregator\\" sites that \\"sucked\\" stories from the internet and published them in magazine like formats. During 1997, Suck published a compilation of their most popular essays in Suck: Worst-Case Scenarios in Media, Culture, Advertising and the Internet (). Style Other than the distinctive artwork of Terry Colon, the website also had many features common to its articles. The main text of each article was restricted to a table only 200 pixels wide. Most articles would feature links within the flow of the content rather than as in labeled footnotes or references, which was less common then than it would become a few years later. Regular columns *Hit & Run -- A link-driven summary of recent events. *Filler -- A weekly self-deprecating satire of cultural pretension and dating in post-modern times.

It is owned by the Holy See but is not an official publication, a role reserved for the Acta Apostolicae Sedis, which acts as a government gazette.John Hooper, \\"Behind the scenes at the pope's newspaper\\" in The Guardian, 20 July 2009 The views expressed in the Osservatore are those of individual authors unless they appear under the specific titles \\"Nostre Informazioni\\" or \\"Santa Sede\\". Available in nine languages, the paper prints two Latin mottos under the masthead of each edition: Unicuique suum (\\"To each his own\\") and Non praevalebunt (\\"[The gates of Hell] shall not prevail\\").From : Et ego dico tibi quia tu es Petrus et super hanc petram aedificabo ecclesiam meam et portae inferi non praevalebunt adversum eam (Latin Vulgate). The current editor-in- chief is Andrea Monda. On 27 June 2015, Pope Francis, in an apostolic letter, established the Secretariat for Communications, a new part of the Roman Curia, and included L'Osservatore Romano under its management. Editions L'Osservatore Romano is published in nine different languages (listed by date of first publication): * Daily and weekly in Italian (1861/1950) * Weekly in French (1949) * Weekly in English (1968) * Weekly in Spanish (1969) * Weekly in Portuguese (1970) * Weekly in German (1971) * Monthly in Polish (1980) * Weekly in Malayalam (2007) The daily Italian edition of L'Osservatore Romano is published in the afternoon, but with a cover date of the following day, a convention that sometimes results in confusion. The weekly English edition is distributed in more than 129 countries, including both English-speaking countries and locales where English is used as the general means of communication. History Under Pope Leo XIII, the Holy See acquired ownership of L'Osservatore in 1885. 19th century Giornale di Roma (27 November 1852) L'Osservatore Romano: front page of 15 May 1891, publishing the encyclical Rerum Novarum of Pope Leo XIII. Giornale di Roma was the newspaper of the Papal States, with first issue published in Rome on 6 July 1849. It continued until 19 September 1870 and is considered the predecessor of L'Osservatore Romano. The first issue of L'Osservatore Romano was published in Rome on 1 July 1861, a few months after the Kingdom of Italy was proclaimed on 17 March 1861. The original intent of the newspaper was unabashedly polemical and propagandistic in defence of the Papal States, adopting the name of a private pamphlet financed by a French Catholic legitimist group. 18 September 1860 defeat of papal troops at Castelfidardo substantially reduced the temporal power of the Pope, prompting Catholic intellectuals to present themselves in Rome for the service of Pope Pius IX. This agenda supported the notion of a daily publication to champion the opinions of the Holy See. By July 1860, the deputy Minister of the Interior, Marcantonio Pacelli (grandfather of the future Pope Pius XII), had plans to supplement the official bulletin of the Catholic Church Giornale di Roma with a semi-official \\"rhetorical\\" publication. In early 1861, controversialist Nicola Zanchini and journalist Giuseppe Bastia were granted editorial direction of Pacelli's newspaper. Official permission to publish was sought on 22 June 1861, and four days later, on 26 June, Pius IX gave his approval for the regulation of L'Osservatore. The first edition was entitled \\"L'Osservatore Romano ‚Äì a political and moral paper\\" and cost five baiocchi. The \\"political and moral paper\\" epithet was dropped before 1862, adding instead the two Latin mottoes that still appear under the masthead today. The editors of the paper initially met in the Salviucci Press on the Piazza de' Santi Apostoli, where the paper was printed. Only when the editorial staff was established on the Palazzo Petri in Piazza dei Crociferi and the first issue printed there on 31 March, was the wording \\"daily newspaper\\" added to the masthead. After the breach of Porta Pia by Italian troops in September 1870, L'Osservatore Romano solidified its opposition to the Kingdom of Italy, affirming obedience to the Pope and adherence to his directives, stating it would remain faithful \\"to that unchangeable principle of religion and morals which recognises as its sole depository and claimant the Vicar of Jesus Christ on earth\\". Soon after, L'Osservatore began to replace the Giornale di Roma as the news organ of the Pontifical State. Giornale di Roma stopped publication on 19 September 1870 almost a decade after launch of L'Osservatore Romano. During the pontificate of Pope Leo XIII, The Vatican acquired the paper's ownership in 1885. 20th century The Osservatore continued to be published as a newspaper in Vatican City, but in 1904 Acta Sanctae Sedis which had existed since 1865, was declared the formal organ of the Holy See in that all documents printed in it were considered \\"authentic and official\\". Acta Sanctae Sedis ceased publication four years later and on 29 September 1908 Acta Apostolicae Sedis became the official publication of the Holy See. Oxford Dictionary of the Christian Church , article Acta Apostolicae Sedis The English weekly edition was first published on 4 April 1968. On 7 January 1998, that edition became the first to be printed outside of Rome, when for North American subscribers, it began to be printed in Baltimore. The edition was printed by the Cathedral Foundation, publishers of The Catholic Review. 21st century As of 1 July 2011, the English language edition of the L'Osservatore Romano for North American subscribers is once again published in Rome; it had been published by the Cathedral Foundation of Baltimore since 1998. In the 21st century, the paper has taken a more objective and subdued stance than at the time of its foundation, priding itself in \\"presenting the genuine face of the church and the ideals of freedom\\", following the statement by Cardinal Tarcisio Bertone in an October 2006 speech inaugurating a new exhibit dedicated to the founding and history of the newspaper. He further described the publication as \\"an instrument for spreading the teachings of the successor of Peter and for information about church events\\". Official views of the Magisterium It is a common error to assume that the contents of the L'Osservatore Romano represent the views of the Magisterium, or the official position of the Holy See. In general, this is not the case, and the only parts of the Osservatore which represent the views of the Holy See are those that appear under the titles \\"Nostre Informazioni\\" or \\"Santa Sede\\".Matthew Bunson, The Pope Encyclopedia: Crown Publishing, 1995 pp 229. Philippe Levillain, The Papacy, An Encyclopedia Routledge Publishers 2002 pp 1082 At times the Magisterium disputes the contents of the Osservatore, e.g. a 2008 article expressed the desire that the debate on brain death be re‚Äëopened because of new developments in the medical world. An official spokesman said that the article presented a personal opinion of the author and \\"did not reflect a change in the Catholic Church's position\\".

He briefly served as the 58th Governor of Ohio from January 3, 1957 to January 14, 1957 and served as the 51st and 54th Lieutenant Governor of Ohio. Brown also served as mayor of Medina, in the Ohio House, and in the Ohio Senate. Lieutenant governor John W. Brown is Ohio's longest serving lieutenant governor, having served under three different governors from 1953 to 1957 and 1963 to 1975. In 1952, he unseated the incumbent lieutenant governor, Democrat George D. Nye, and took office in 1953. (At the time, the office of lieutenant governor was elected separately from the office of governor). Brown defeated Nye again in 1954 to win a second two-year term. In 1956, instead of seeking another term as lieutenant governor, Brown ran for the gubernatorial nomination against state Attorney General C. William O'Neill. Brown lost badly in the primary, getting only 27.5% of the vote to O'Neill's 72.5%.Congressional Quarterly, Inc., Guide to U.S. Elections, 2d ed., 1985. Governor of Ohio In January 1957, as Brown was about to leave the lieutenant governorship, Frank J. Lausche, the Democratic governor of Ohio, resigned to take a seat in the United States Senate, which he had won in the 1956 general election. Brown, thus, was elevated to the office of governor. Lausche's successor, C. William O'Neill (who had defeated Brown in the gubernatorial primary), had already been elected, at the same time that Lausche won his Senate seat; however, at the time, the U.S. Senate term began on January 3, but the Ohio gubernatorial term did not end until January 14. Into the breach stepped the outgoing lieutenant governor. Brown took his eleven-day-long governorship very seriously. He moved into the governor's mansion, summoned the General Assembly to hear his state of the state address, demanded and received the governor's salary for the eleven days, and deposited five boxes of gubernatorial papers with the Ohio Historical Society. Among papers was a letter, on gubernatorial letter-head, to Columbus mayor M. E. Sensenbrenner, asking him to take care of a parking ticket. There was also a letter to then-President Eisenhower asking for a federal job after his eleven days in the governor's office were complete. Later career In 1958, Brown was elected to the Ohio House of Representatives, where he served from 1959 to 1961. He won election to the lieutenant governorship again in 1962, and served another three terms (by this time, the lieutenant governor's term had been extended to four years), from 1963 to 1975. In 1974, Brown lost his bid for another term to Richard F. Celeste. After serving as lieutenant governor, Brown worked to reactivate, and became the first commandant of, the Ohio Naval Militia. Legacy Brown Arena at the Ohio Expo Center and State Fair in Columbus, Ohio, is named in honor of Brown.

One of its predecessor banks started in 1784, but the merged BankBoston was short-lived, being acquired by Fleet Bank in 1999. In 2005, FleetBoston was purchased by, and merged into, Bank of America of Charlotte, North Carolina. After the sale of its Latin American branches in 2006, BankBoston currently exists solely as a subsidiary private bank owned by Bank of America. History The history of BankBoston represents the combination of dozens of banks throughout the New England region acquired over the course of more than two centuries. Among its notable predecessors were the Massachusetts Bank, the First National Bank of Boston, the Old Colony Trust Company and BayBank. The Massachusetts Bank Bank of Boston traced its roots back to The Massachusetts Bank founded in 1784. The Massachusetts Bank was the first federally chartered joint-stock owned bank in the United States and only the second bank to receive a charter in the United States. The bank's charter was signed by John Hancock and among its early account holders were such notable figures as Paul Revere, Samuel Adams, John Hancock and Henry Knox. The bank's founders were largely made up of merchants who wanted to use a U.S., rather than British bank to send money abroad. It was first headquartered at the old Manufactory House, near Boston Common. The bank was the only bank in the city of Boston until the Union Bank (later the Bank of New England) was founded in 1792. In 1786, the Massachusetts Bank financed the first U.S. trade mission to China, and in 1791, it financed the first voyage of an American ship to Argentina, establishing what would become a long-standing presence in Latin America. Bank of Boston would later become the largest foreign bank in several major Latin American cities. In 1864, The Massachusetts Bank was renamed the Massachusetts National Bank. First National Bank of Boston  First National Bank of Boston logo, c. 1921 Bank of Boston logo, c. 1982 In 1903, The Massachusetts Bank merged with The First National Bank of Boston amidst a wave of consolidation in the banking industry at the start of the 20th century. First National had been founded in 1859 as Safety Fund Bank, changing its name in 1864 when it joined the national bank system. After a year operating as The Massachusetts First National Bank of Boston, the combined firm dropped the usage of \\"Massachusetts\\" in the name. On December 24, 1927, Bank of Boston's headquarters in Buenos Aires, Argentina, were blown up by the Italian anarchist Severino Di Giovanni, in the frame of the international campaign supporting Sacco and Vanzetti. Despite the Wall Street Crash of 1929, the First National Bank of Boston continued to grow in 1929, purchasing the Old Colony Trust Company. However, following the passage of the Glass‚ÄìSteagall Act in 1933, which prohibited commercial banks from engaging in investment banking and securities dealing, First National Bank of Boston was forced to divest its investment banking arm, the First Boston Corporation. In 1970 the Bank of Boston reorganized under a new holding company, First National Boston Corporation, and began a series of acquisitions of regional banks through the 1970s and 1980s. In 1978, the bank challenged a Massachusetts law limiting bank contributions to political issues. The U.S. Supreme Court sided with the bank that their First Amendment rights were being restricted, in First National Bank of Boston v. Bellotti. In 1982, the bank renamed itself Bank of Boston. In 1985 Bank of Boston acquired Connecticut- based Colonial Bancorp and in 1987 acquired BankVermont Corporation. Acquisition of BayBank to form BankBoston By the 1990s, Bank of Boston was looking to make another large acquisition, hoping to make itself too rich to be acquired by a much larger player. However, the bank lost the bidding in 1991 for the failed Bank of New England to Fleet Bank, and its attempted merger with Shawmut Bank collapsed in early 1992. In 1994, Bank of Boston entered into discussions with Fleet about a potential merger but ultimately Fleet chose to merge with Shawmut in 1995. This merger made Fleet the largest bank in Boston and New England. In 1995, Bank of Boston announced a merger with BayBank, another local financial institution. Although still smaller than its failed takeover targets earlier in the decade, BayBank had a strong retail banking operation, with 205 branches and over a thousand ATMs. Baybanks was founded in 1928 when a Massachusetts asset manager with controlling stakes in nine banks reorganized itself as Old Colony Trust. After successfully weathering the Great Depression, Old Colony Trust changed its name to Baystate Corporation. This reflected the widening scope of operations and services the firm provided throughout Massachusetts. In the 1950s and 1960s, Baystate engaged in an aggressive acquisitions strategy and bought more than 40 banks. In 1976 the bank's name was changed from Baystate to BayBanks, Inc. BayBanks derived 80 percent of its revenues from its retail business, with 31% of households in eastern Massachusetts, and 25% across the entire state, having at least one BayBanks account. Following the merger, the combined Bank of Boston did regain the title as the largest bank in the city of Boston from its rival Fleet Bank although Fleet was still the larger bank overall. With the addition of BayBank's $11 billion of assets, the combined bank had total assets of over $62 billion at the end of 1996. The combined bank, rebranded BankBoston in 1996, was a major financial institution both domestically and internationally, due in part to the Latin American holdings of Bank of Boston, where the old name was still used. Nonetheless, it would soon be subsumed by one of the many U.S. bank mergers that proliferated in the 1990s. In August 1998 BankBoston acquired Robertson Stephens & Co. from BankAmerica Corporation for approximately $800 million. The transaction represented the second largest acquisition in company history, after the purchase of BayBank. Merger with Fleet Boston-based Fleet Bank (originally Providence Bank, founded in Rhode Island in 1791) acquired BankBoston in 1999, on the heels of acquiring Shawmut Bank just a few years earlier. Fleet now dominated the New England market, yet saw the value in maintaining the old Bank of Boston brand in Latin America. The combination of Fleet and BankBoston resulted in what was the eighth largest bank in the United States at the time, with assets of over $190 billion. Between the acquisitions by Fleet and BankBoston, the combined bank had consumed eight of the ten largest banks in New England at the start of the 1990s. The merged entity, FleetBoston Financial, adopted BankBoston's former Boston headquarters as its own. The bank had branches throughout New England and the mid-Atlantic states. In 2000, FleetBoston acquired Summit Bancorp of Princeton, New Jersey. The acquisition of Summit, New Jersey's largest remaining bank at the time, vaulted FleetBoston into the #1 market-share position in the state of New Jersey and provided critical mass in the Philadelphia metro area. Acquisition by Bank of America In 2004, FleetBoston in turn was purchased by Bank of America, which was looking to expand its East Coast presence. Bank of America chose to unload Bank of Boston's historic Latin American assets (still branded as BankBoston), in order to focus on becoming one of the largest U.S. domestic banks. In 2006, Bank of America sold all BankBoston's Brazilian assets to Brazilian bank Banco Ita√∫, in exchange for Ita√∫ shares. The BankBoston name and trademarks were not part of the transaction and, as part of the sale agreement, cannot be used by Bank of America. In August 2006, Ita√∫ purchased BankBoston assets in Chile and Uruguay.Brazzil Magazine, 10 August 2006 Operations in these countries continued to use the BankBoston brand until Banco Itau completed its takeover in Chile on February 27, 2007,Business News Americas, 6 March 2007 and in Uruguay on March 23, 2007. In December 2006, Argentina's central bank approved Bank of America's sale of BankBoston Argentina to South Africa's Standard Bank.Boston Business Journal, 22 December 2006 With the finalization of the sale on April 3, 2007,Standard Bank, 3 April 2007 (press release) the BankBoston brand ceased to exist in any branches (in 2012 an 80% stake was sold by Standard Bank to Industrial and Commercial Bank of China). BankBoston currently exists solely as an international private bank, a subsidiary owned by Bank of America.

His books remain in print, and the principles he taught as \\"Science of Mind\\" have inspired and influenced many generations of metaphysical students and teachers. Holmes had previously studied another New Thought teaching, Divine Science, and was an ordained Divine Science Minister.Glenn R. Mosley (2006), New Thought, Ancient Wisdom: The History and Future of the New Thought Movement, Templeton Foundation Press, p. 47. His influence beyond New Thought can be seen in the self-help movement.  Biography  Holmes was born January 21, 1887, in Lincoln, Maine, to a poor family. He was the son of Anna Columbia (Heath) and William Nelson Holmes.Ernest Holmes, \\"About the Author\\", Love and Law, Penguin, 2004. He left school and his family in Maine for Boston at the age of 15. From 1908 to 1910 he worked in a store to pay for his tuition at the Leland Powers School of Expression in Boston. There he was introduced to Mary Baker Eddy's Science and Health, as well as Christian Science.(1971) The Library Journal Book Review. R.R. Bowker Company, p. 132. In 1912 Holmes joined his brother Fenwicke in Venice, California.

Religious Science/Science of Mind  After leading small private meetings throughout the city, in 1916 Ernest Holmes was invited to speak at the Metaphysical Library in Los Angeles. This led him to repeat engagements, and on a nationwide tour. In 1919 he published his first book, The Creative Mind, and after almost a decade of touring Holmes committed to remaining in the L.A. area to complete his major work, The Science of Mind. It was published in 1926.Worstell, R. C. (2007), Secrets to the Law of Attraction, Lulu, p. 140. That year Holmes started speaking each Sunday morning in a theatre in the Ambassador Hotel that seated 625. In November 1927, they moved to the 1,295-seat Ebell Theatre. Subsequently, Holmes lectures continued moving to ever-larger spaces, including Biltmore Hotel, and the Wiltern Theatre. which seats more than 2800.

In 2015, his books Creative Mind and Creative Mind and Success were narrated by Hillary Hawkins and published in audiobook form. Holmes Memorial Chapel at Founder's Church in Los Angeles  Philosophy  Holmes taught New Thought in a Christian context in his church. The primary teaching of New Thought is that physical form is created by a Universal Mind, or God, which manifests -- or literally reflects -- the dominant belief system of all living persons. In his book, the Science of Mind, Holmes described this God-force as follows: Holmes argued that human beings have access to the power of this Universal Mind by directing their thoughts -- in particular, their beliefs about the present or the future. In his book, he described this as follows: In his book, the Science of Mind, Holmes explains how it is possible to direct this power by controlling one's thoughts. A sustained belief in a particular outcome will invariably create that outcome. In other words, good events proceed from a belief in good. Evil events proceed from a belief in evil. In the Science of Mind, Holmes emphasized the importance of only focusing on good: In order to get results, Holmes emphasized that it was necessary to think one specific thought, with complete certainty. If one is continually thinking different thoughts, the Universal Mind will not have a dominant belief that it can manifest, or create, in the physical world. Holmes explained this idea as follows, in his book, Creative Mind:  Statement of Beliefs  In the 1920s, Holmes published the following statement of beliefs:Dr Ernest Holmes, \\"What I Believe\\", Religious Science. Through his research, Holmes created a \\"structure of concepts\\" based on the religions and philosophies of human history, sometimes correlating his findings with the then-emerging \\"new\\" physics. He named the teaching a science because he believed that its principles were scientifically provable in practice. He wrote, \\"I would rather see a student of this Science prove its Principle than to have him repeat all the words of wisdom that have ever been uttered.\\" Holmes ultimately came to believe in a \\"core concept\\" ‚Äì what he saw as a \\"Golden thread of truth\\" that ran through all of the world's religions as well as in science and philosophy.  Recognition  Ernest Holmes received a variety of recognition for his work. In 1945, he was awarded the honorary degree of Doctor of Philosophy by Andhra University in India. The California College of Medicine, and the Foundation Academic University of Spiritual Understanding in Venice, Italy, awarded him a Doctor of Letters. In 1942, he was bestowed with the Cross of the Commander of the Grand Humanitarian Prize of Belgium, and in 1944 he was named an honorary member of the Eugene Field Society.

He served as the 47th mayor of Cleveland and the 55th and 57th Governor of Ohio, and also served as a United States Senator from Ohio for two terms (1957-1969). Youth and baseball career Lausche's family originates from Slovenia. He was born in Cleveland, Ohio, the son of Frances (n√©e Milavec) and Louis Lausche.http://ech.case.edu/cgi/article.pl?id=LFJ Lausche attended St. Vitus Grade School grades one to four, St. Francis Grade School in grade five and Madison Grammar School grades six to eight. He then went to Central Institute Preparatory School. He dropped out of school in 1911, when his older brother died, to help support his family.Odenkirk 2005 : 53 He played baseball locally when not working, and was recruited as a third baseman to the amateur White Motor team, which won a national championship. He was noticed by scouts and reported to the Duluth White Sox in Duluth, Minnesota, of the Class D Northern League in the spring of 1916.Odenkirk 2005 : 55 He started the season batting .422, but developed trouble hitting curve balls, and was released after 31 games. He signed with a semi-pro team in Virginia, Minnesota. He performed poorly for two weeks before returning to Cleveland, and amateur ball.Odenkirk 2005 : 56 During the spring of 1917, Lausche reported to the Class B Lawrence Barristers, Lawrence, Massachusetts, of the Eastern League. He started well, but was released after 27 games. He enlisted in the United States Army that summer, and reported to Camp Gordon, near Atlanta, Georgia. He was noticed playing baseball, and was asked to join the camp baseball team. He was promoted to second lieutenant after eight months, and assigned to officers' training school. His high batting average \\"spared him a trip across the ocean to the front lines.\\"Odenkirk 2005 : 56 The team manager at the camp was Charles Frank, who in peacetime owned and managed the Atlanta Crackers of the Class AA Southern Association. After World War I ended in November, 1918, but before Lausche was discharged in January, 1919, Frank offered Lausche a six- month contract, at $225 per month if he would report at spring training.Odenkirk 2005 : 57 Lausche had also completed high school while in the Army.Odenkirk 2005 : 53 Legal career Lausche entered the Cleveland- Marshall School of Law early on 1919, and decided to continue in law school that spring, rather than report to spring training.Odenkirk 2005 : 57 He graduated from the law school in 1921. He was ranked second in his class at John Marshall School of Law and quickly became known as one of Cleveland's better trial lawyers. Lausche served as Municipal Court judge from 1932 to 1937 and Common Pleas Court judge from 1937 to 1941, before winning election as Mayor of Cleveland in 1941. Mayor and governor He served until 1944, when he first won election as Governor of Ohio, becoming the state's first Catholic governor. Lausche served as governor from 1945 to 1947, when he narrowly lost to Thomas J. Herbert. Lausche defeated Herbert in a 1948 rematch, however, and served four consecutive terms from 1949 to 1957. He was reelected as governor in 1950, defeating state Treasurer Don H. Ebright; in 1952, defeating Cincinnati Mayor Charles Phelps Taft II; and in 1954, defeating state Auditor Jim Rhodes, who later became governor himself. Lausche resigned in early 1957, having won election to the United States Senate in November 1956, unseating incumbent Republican George Bender. Senator In his first term, with the Senate almost evenly split, Lausche gave Senate Democratic leader Lyndon B. Johnson a scare by hinting that he might vote for Republican William F. Knowland for Senate Majority Leader, although he ultimately did not. Throughout his career, Lausche displayed a bipartisan and independent approach to politics, being known by some as a \\"Democrat with a small 'd'\\", but his approach to ethnic Democratic politics paved the way for followers such as Ralph S. Locher, who became Mayor of Cleveland and later an Associate Justice of the Ohio Supreme Court, and Bronis Klementowicz, a leader of Cleveland City Council and law director under Locher. Lausche's independence also earned him, among some, the derisive moniker, \\"Frank the Fence.\\" Lausche was easily re-elected to the Senate in 1962, but was defeated in his bid for renomination in 1968, due to his loss of labor union support. He lost the Democratic primary against John J. Gilligan by a 55% to 45% margin, and in the general election, Lausche refused to support Gilligan, who went on to lose the general election to then-state Attorney General William B. Saxbe. Lausche was a very popular, plain-spoken, big-city politician of the old school. He was credited with building a coalition of ethnic voters in Cleveland known as the \\"cosmopolitan Democrats.\\" There is some evidence that Republican presidential candidate Dwight D.

Mleccha was used by the ancient Indians originally to indicate the uncouth and incomprehensible speech of foreigners and then extended to their unfamiliar behaviour, and also used as a derogatory term in the sense of \\"impure\\" and/or \\"inferior\\" people. The word Mleccha was commonly used for foreign 'barbarians of whatever race or colour'.Basham, A. L. (1954) The wonder that was India, pages 145‚Äì146, Sidgwick and Jackson, London.http://www.dictionary.reference.com/browse/mleccha The Indians referred to all alien cultures and races that were less civilized in ancient times as 'Mleccha'Mudrarakshasha by Kashinath Trimbak Telang introduction p12 or barbarians. Among the tribes termed Mleccha were Sakas, Hunas, Yavanas, Kambojas, Pahlavas, Bahlikas and Rishikas.National geographer, 1977, p 60, Allahabad Geographical Society ‚Äì History. The Amarakosha described the Kiratas, Khasas and Pulindas as the Mleccha-jatis. Indo-Greeks, Scythians, and KushanasLanguage multiplicity and ancient races in India were also mlecchas. Etymology The Sanskrit word mleccha does not have a standard Indo-European etymology and has no counterpart in Iranian languages. However, it has cognates in Middle Indo-Aryan languages: Pali milakkha, and Prakrit mliccha, from the latter of which originate Sindhi milis, Punjabi milech, Kashmiri brichun (weep or lament), Western Pahari melech (dirty). The Sanskrit word occurs as a verb mlecchati for the first time in the latic Vedic text ≈öathapatha‚ÄêBrƒÅhmana dated to around 700 BCE. It is taken to mean \\"to speak indistinctly or barbarously\\". Brahmins are prohibited from speaking in this fashion. As mleccha does not have an Indo-European etymology, scholars infer that it must have been a self-designation of a non-Aryan people within India. Based on the geographic references to the Mleccha de≈õa (Mleccha country) to the west, the term is identified with the Indus people, whose land is known from the Sumerian texts as Melu·∏´·∏´a.; Asko Parpola has proposed a Dravidian derivation for \\"Melu·∏´·∏´a\\", as mel-akam (\\"high country\\", a possible reference to Balochistan high lands). The Vayu, Matsya and Brahmanda Purana state that the seven Himalayan rivers pass through mleccha countries. The Brahmanas place mlecchas outside the varna. Pali, the older Prakrit used by Theravada Buddhism, uses the term milakkha. It also employs milakkhu, a borrowing from a Dramatic Prakrit. The term Mencha, probably a tadbhava, was also used by the medieval Marathi saint Samarth Ramdas. Language Some explanations of the name \\"mleccha\\" suggest that the word was derived from the Indo-Aryan perception of the speech of the indigenous peoples. Namely, \\"mlech\\" was a word that meant \\"to speak indistinctly.\\" As such, some suggest that the Indo-Aryans used an onomatopoeic sound to imitate the harshness of alien tongue and to indicate incomprehension, thus coming up with \\"mleccha\\". Early Indians spoke Sanskrit, which evolved into the various local modern Sanskrit-derived languages. Sanskrit was believed to include all the sounds necessary for communication. Early Indians would therefore dismiss other languages as foreign tongue, \\"mleccha bhasha\\". As the Sanskrit word itself suggests, \\"mlecchas\\" were those whose speech was alien. \\"Correct speech\\" was a crucial component of being able to take part in the appropriate yajnas (religious rituals and sacrifices). Thus, without correct speech, one could not hope to practice correct religion, either. The notion of being Arya suggested a knowledge of Sanskrit in order to effectively perform ritual hymns; thus suggesting the importance of language. Parasher discusses the importance of knowing the correct speech in order to perform sacrifice and ritual in the religion of the brahmanas. Parasher continued that: \\"The best experts of the sacrificial art were undoubtedly the various families of the Brahmins who, placed in a hierarchy within the Indo-Aryan social system, became the upholders of pure and best speech\\". Historians note that early Indo-Aryans believed Sanskrit to be the superior language over all other forms of speech. As such, mleccha or barbarian speech was said to have meant any of the following: \\"1) a language which was not necessarily alien, but the speech of the person or persons was improper because it was either hostile or vulgar; 2) a language, and here most probably Sanskrit, that was mispronounced and, thereby, incomprehensible: 3) finally, any foreign tongue which was naturally incomprehensible because it was unintelligible to those who did not understand a particular language\\". Territory Historians have stated that the notion of foreigners in ancient India ‚Äì those living outside of the Indian subcontinent ‚Äì was often accompanied by the idea that one was a barbarian. Still, it seemed that groups who did not come from outside of these areas, as well as foreigners, were designated by the term mleccha, which carried with it a barbarian connotation. Thus another distinction that was made between the mlecchas and non-mlecchas was area of habitation. Though they were considered a marginal group, the area characterize as the mleccha-desa (the natural border that separated their lands from that of the Aryans) was never permanent. Instead, it was defined by the changing ideas about the ƒÄryƒÅvarta. Parasher noted that \\"the only consistent areas dubbed as mleccha desa were those regions inhabited by 'primitive tribes' who for long periods of time did not come under the sway of the brahmanical, Buddhist or Jaina influence\\". Though the area of the Aryas expanded with time, the notion that was held over all of the land was that of \\"purity.\\" As Vedic literature refers only to the places and territories that were familiar to the Indo-Aryans, these lands eventually became part of the ƒÄryƒÅvarta. Parasher thus indicates that the ƒÄryƒÅvarta was designated as \\"[t]he region where the river Sarasvati disappears is the Patiala district in the Punjab. The Pariyatra mountains belong to the Vindhya range, probably the hills of Malwa. The Kalakavana is identified with a tract somewhere near Prayaga.\\" Still, other interpretations of the ƒÄryƒÅvarta refer to those areas where the black antelope roams, for these areas are fit for the performance of sacrifice. Early Vedic literature focused on defining the area of habitation of the aryas for this land was considered pure; yet there is no actual reference to the mleccha country or behavior. Wherever the territory, though, the implications of naming such lands as the Aryavarta is that any lands excluded from that area were considered impure. Further, there is evidence that Indians of the Vedic period actually had contact with people outside of the subcontinent, namely the Persians. The Persians, who ruled over the Indus river valley during this time (522‚Äì486 BC) were not designated as mleccha, perhaps because they did not interfere with the brahmanical way of life. Later Vedic literature speaks of the western Anava tribes as mlecchas and occupying northern Punjab, Sindh and eastern Rajasthan. The tribes of the north were mlecchas either because they were located on the frontiers such as Gandhara, Kashmira and Kambojas and therefore both their speech and culture had become contaminated and differed from that of ƒÄryƒÅvarta, or else, as in the case of southern India, they were once Aryas but having forsaken the Vedic rituals were regarded to mleccha status. Cultural behavior The word mleccha emerged as a way for the ancient Hindus to classify those who did not subscribe to the \\"traditional value system,\\" though the characteristics of the so-called system were ambiguous. In sum, though, the idea was that the mlecchas were peoples who did not conform to what was culturally acceptable. Early writings refer to these foreign peoples as \\"half-civilized, unconverted people who rise or eat at improper times.\\" They stated that monks and nuns should avoid certain areas of habitation because they were unsafe. Namely, that \\"the ignorant populace might beat, harass, rob them under the impression that they were spies from hostile villages.\\" Further, while some of these non- mlecchas, such as those of the Jaina faith, had established contact with people of the forest tribes, they were automatically designated as mlecchas. This was the typical attitude of people from the plains who took pride in their norms of settled agricultural and urban lifestyles. Historians note that there were also systems in place to determine the validity ‚Äì or \\"purity\\" ‚Äì of certain customs, which would ultimately be judged by the Priest. As such there were intricate rules in place to define purity from impurity, laws of behavior, as well as rituals and customs, in an effort to educate the members of the Brahmanical system. Namely, these advisors took great pains to ensure that peoples of the Brahmanical system did not subscribe to any mleccha customs or rituals. The Sanskrit-ization of names was a common feature among both indigenous and foreign mlecchas who slowly tried to move away from their status of mleccha. Very often, in the case of ruling families, it took one to two generations to make a transition. One of the most direct forms of the expression of the Brahmanical ritual purity was the form and type of food which a Brahmin could eat. He was forbidden to accept cooked food from any unclean person. Thus when the Punjab region became a mleccha area conquered by Muslims, the staple food was given a lower place in the food-ranking. By the twelfth century AD, wheat was described in one lexicon as 'food of the mlecchas', and rice became the 'pure' cereal. Onions and garlic was also regarded as the food of the mlecchas and therefore prohibited to the priestly intellectual class of Brahmins. Mlecchas drank alcohol, ate cow flesh, which was strictly forbidden to a follower of Hindu orthopraxy, and believed in false gods.Ancient Indian Social History: Some Interpretations By Romila Thapar The decline of society and dissolution of values is typically associated with the notion of being overrun by Mlecchas, leading to the collapse of civilization. The Mlecchas would endeavor in making the world in their disgusting image and rewrite history to their own liking. This situation is described in The Mahabharata: \\"And the whole world will be filled with mleccha behavior and notions and ceremonies, and sacrifices will cease and joy will be nowhere and general rejoicing will disappear.[...] And, O Yudhishthira, the whole world will be mlecchified. And men will cease to gratify the gods by offerings of Sraddhas. And no one will listen to the words of others and no one will be regarded as a preceptor by another. And, O ruler of men, intellectual darkness will envelop the whole earth.\\"Book 3, Section CLXXXIX (189). Literature describing the Mleccha In the Mahabharata, some Mleccha warriors are described as having \\"heads completely shaved or half- shaved or covered with matted locks, [as being] impure in habits, and of crooked faces and noses.\\"Mlecchas in early India: a study in attitudes towards outsiders up to AD 600 They are \\"dwellers of hills\\" and \\"denizens of mountain- caves. Mlecchas were born of the cow (belonging to Vasishtha), of fierce eyes, accomplished in smiting looking like messengers of Death, and all conversant with the deceptive powers of the Asuras\\".Mahabharata, Drona Parva, Section 92. Swami Parmeshwaranand states the mleccha tribe was born from the tail of the celestial cow Nandini, kept by Vashishta for sacrificial purposes when there was a fight between Vishvamitra and Vasistha. The Mahabharata gives the following information regarding them: * Mleccha who sprang up from the tail of the celestial cow Nandini sent the army of Viswamitra flying in terror. * Bhagadatta was the king of mlecchas. * Pandavas, like Bhima, Nakula and Sahadeva once defeated them. * Karna during his world campaign conquered many mleccha countries. * The wealth that remained in the Yagasala of Yudhishthira after the distribution as gifts to Brahmins was taken away by the mlecchas. * The mlecchas drove angered elephants on the army of the Pandavas. \\"This shows mlecchas were against Pandavas\\".Encyclopaedic Dictionary of Puranas: (A-C) ; 2.(D-H) ; 3.(I-L) ; 4.(M-R) ; 5 ... By Swami Parmeshwaranand The term is not attested in the Vedas, but occurs for the first time in the late Vedic text the Shatapatha Brahmana. The Baudhayana sutras define a mleccha as someone \\"who eats meat or indulges in self-contradictory statements or is devoid of righteousness and purity of conduct\\". Medieval Hindu literature, such as that of Chaitanya Mahaprabhu, also uses the term to refer to those of larger groups of other religions, especially Muslims.Vedabase . In medieval India, a foreign visitor al-Biruni (died 1048) noted that foreigners were regarded as 'unclean' or 'Mleccha' and Hindus were forbidden any social or matrimonial contact with them.Rizvi, S.A.A.

DAA's head office is located in the original passenger terminal on the grounds of Dublin Airport. History  Aer Rianta  Aer Rianta logo until 2004. Aer Rianta was founded in 1937 as Aer Rianta Teoranta and the name is derived from the Irish language for \\"air ways\\" or \\"air tracks\\"; Teoranta is the Irish word for Limited. Aer Rianta was to serve as a holding company for the national airline and to promote aviation generally. In 1947, Aer Rianta started the duty-free shop concept in the Shannon Airport and are credited with the invention of duty-free shops in airports. Aer Rianta was the principal shareholder of Aer Lingus during the airline's early days, until 1966. Aer Rianta began managing the Dublin Airport in the 1940s. Under the Air Navigation and Transport Act of 1950, Aer Rianta was given legal responsibility for the airport. In 1954, Prof. Patrick Lynch was appointed chairman of Aer Rianta. He retired from the position in 1975. In 1966, the passage of the Air Companies Act enabled the transfer of Aer Lingus shares to the Minister of Finance, and separate boards were appointed to each company. A general manager of Aer Rianta was appointed in 1968. On 1 April 1969, Cork and Shannon Airports became the responsibility of the company. In 1988, Aer Rianta International (ARI) was created to pursue international potential to the company's growth not related to Irish airport management ‚Äì for example, opening Russia's first duty free in Moscow in 1988.

Significant outstanding issues to be resolved include competitiveness and debit restructuring. The company also retains its significant shareholdings in foreign airports such as D√ºsseldorf and Larnaca, through its wholly owned subsidiary ARI, Aer Rianta International. The State Airports Act was heavily criticised by Noel Hanlon, the outgoing chairman of Aer Rianta, and by the company's unions, who believed it a precursor to privatisation. No act to privatise Dublin Airport Authority or any of the airports has been passed however. The Dublin Airport Authority was officially renamed DAA with effect from November 2014. In 2016, DAA paid a ‚Ç¨18.3m dividend to the State, its first since 2009. In August 2017, Dalton Philips was named CEO. In May 2018, Basil Geoghegan was named chairman of the company.

Bullwhips are pastoral tools, traditionally used to control livestock in open country. A bullwhip's length, flexibility, and tapered design allows it to be thrown in such a way that, toward the end of the throw, part of the whip exceeds the speed of sound‚Äîthereby creating a small sonic boom.Mike May. \\"Crackin' Good Mathematics\\" American Scientist. Retrieved 2009-07-25. The bullwhip was rarely, if ever, used to strike cattle, as this could inflict damage to the animal.  History  The origins of the bullwhip are also a matter for debate and, given the perishable nature of leather, are likely to remain so. Difficulties in tracing its development also arise from regional and national variations in nomenclature. There are claims that it was developed in South America where, like \\"cow-whips\\" during the slave trade, it was used as a weapon, or that it arrived there from Spain, but Roman mosaicsVroma.org Retrieved 2009-11-23. and earthenwareVroma.org Retrieved 2009-11-23. dating to around the 2nd and 3rd centuries AD show what appear to be tapered drop-lash whips, rather than the two-piece whips often associated with the Romans and other ancient cultures. Given that the same basic design appears in several primary sources, it seems likely that this is not a stylistic coincidence but a depiction of a design of whip in current use at the time the articles were made.http://bullwhip-info.com/whip_information/bullwhip_history.html During the late 19th and early 20th centuries, as rural economies became increasingly mechanized, demand for all types of whips diminished. By the middle of the 20th century, bullwhip making was a dying craft, with only a few craftsmen left making good quality whips. In the later half of the 20th century, attempts to preserve traditional crafts, along with a resurgence of interest in Western performance arts and the release of films such as Devo's \\"Whip It\\" video and the motion pictures Raiders of the Lost Ark and its sequels in which the hero, Indiana Jones, uses a bullwhip as both a tool and a weapon, led to an increased interest in whip cracking as a hobby and performance art, as well as a competitive sport. Whip cracking competitions focus on the completion of complex multiple cracking routines and precise target work; although other whips are also used in such competitions. Whereas, in times past, the bullwhip was designed for one basic, main purpose, modern whip makers design their whips for different specific purposes and to suit different throwing styles. Regardless of their intended end use, all bullwhips have certain common features.  Anatomy of the bullwhip  A bullwhip consists of a handle section, a thong, a fall, and a cracker. A wrist loop may also be present, although its chief purpose is for hanging one's whip on a hook. Aesthetically, it finishes the handle. The main portion of the bullwhip's length is made up of a braided body or thong. Made of many strips of leather, the number of braids or plaits is an important factor in the construction of the whip. Often the thong is multi-layered, having one or more \\"bellies\\" in the center. Quality whips have at least two bellies, made of braided leather like the surface of the whip, though with fewer plaits. Lower-quality whips may have no bellies at all, and are sometimes stuffed with materials such as newspaper which will break down with use. Unlike in the Australian stock whip, the thong connects in line with the handle (rather than with a joint), or sometimes completely covers the handle. The handle is usually short, being between long. While some whips have an exposed wooden grip, others have an intricately braided leather covered handle. Leather-covered handles usually contain a butt foundation, which is held in the palm of the hand when cracking, and can have a wrist loop, used for hanging the whip at the end of the day, not for putting around the wrist during use. Some handles swivel, making it easier to do certain types of unsophisticated cracks but making it harder to do others, or to use the whip for any type of accurate targeting. The Australians introduced a longer handled bullwhip to the US, where the bullwhips traditionally had shorter handles. The longer handled whip, with a handle of , functions like a cross between a stockwhip and a bullwhip, and is referred to as a \\"Target Whip.\\" Bullwhips are usually measured from the butt of the handle to the end of the plaiting of the thong. The thong typically terminates at a fall hitch‚Äîa series of half hitches that neatly tie the replaceable fall (or tail) to the whip. Whips range in length from to very long bullwhips of with some examples being even longer. A fall is a single piece of leather between in length. It was traditionally made to be replaceable due to the extreme stresses the very end of the whip was subjected to as it was \\"cracked\\". Of course, it is much easier to replace a solid piece of leather than to re-plait the whole of the whip. In lesser quality whips the fall can also be a continuation of one of the strands used in plaiting the overlay or the fall can be an extension of the core of the whip, with the strands from the overlay tied off, and the core continuing on as the fall. But these types of falls do not allow for replacement and thus are not practical. A cracker, which is part of a bullwhip or stockwhip. Tied to the end of the flexible fall, is an even more flexible piece of string or nylon cord or wire called the cracker or the popper. Some sources state that the cracker is the portion of the whip that makes the loud noise known as the sonic boom, but this is misleading. A whip without a cracker will still make a sonic boom, but it will be less audible unless you are standing directly in front of it. The cracker functions to disperse the sound so it can be heard more easily. Cracking a whip causes wear to the cracker, and well used whips frequently require new crackers. Crackers can be made of horsehair, twine, string, nylon, polypropylene, silk, polyester or any number of materials. There are several methods of tying the cracker to the fall, usually using a larks head knot as the basis since it tightens on itself when the whip is cracked, reducing the chance the cracker will slip off the fall and be sent flying into the air. Bullwhips come in many different weights, materials, and designs. Some light whips use shot loading or lead weighting to affect their balance. Though usually made of strips of leather, nylon whips (often using paracord) have become popular‚Äîthey were initially developed for use in the wetlands of Florida specifically, where leather is difficult to maintain hence the name \\"Florida Cow Whip\\" but have recently gained in popularity because they are less expensive than leather. In the old days in America, regular cowhide, rawhide and oxhide leathers were most commonly used for the construction of bullwhips because they were readily available. They tend to be quite thick and sturdy and are good for harsh conditions. Some whip-crackers doing target work prefer a whip made of kangaroo skin and kangaroo hide is preferred by whip makers because it is many times stronger than cow hide and can be cut into fine, strong laces allowing for more intricate braiding patterns that in the past could only be done with rawhide, which is much harder to work with.

It is known for its hot dogs, bologna, bacon, ham, and Lunchables products. History Early years German immigrant Oscar F. Mayer (1859‚Äì1955), born in K√∂singen, Germany, began working at a meat market in Detroit, Michigan, and later in Chicago, Illinois. In 1883, Mayer and his brother Gottfried leased the Kolling Meat Market on the near-northside of Chicago. The Mayer brothers sold bratwurst, liverwurst, and wei√üwurst, which were popular in the predominantly German neighborhoods around their Chicago meat market. As the meat market's popularity grew, it expanded its storefront and participated in sponsoring local events including the 1893 Chicago World's Fair. By 1900, the company had 43 employees and Chicago-wide delivery service. In 1904, Oscar Mayer began branding its meats to capitalize on their popularity, beginning an industry-wide trend. Early company specialties were \\"Old World\\" sausages and Westphalian hams, soon followed by bacon and wieners. In 1906, Oscar Mayer & Co. was among the first to volunteer to join the newly created federal meat inspection program. In 1919, the company made its first major expansion, with the purchase of a processing plant in Madison, Wisconsin. The plant quickly proved to be a profitable, efficient operation, and in 1919 Madison became the corporate headquarters. Kraft ownership For nearly a century, Oscar Mayer remained an independent company owned primarily by descendants of the Mayer brothers who started it. In 1981, Oscar Mayer stockholders elected to sell the company to General Foods. Four years later, Philip Morris acquired General Foods, and in 1989 merged General Foods with the newly acquired Kraft Foods transforming it into Kraft General foods. Shares of Kraft Foods were first offered to the public via an initial public offering in 2001. Altria Group (formerly Philip Morris) spun off remaining shares of Kraft Foods to Altria shareholders in 2007. On November 4, 2015, owner Kraft Heinz announced it would move the Oscar Mayer headquarters and the company's U.S. meats business from Madison to Chicago. The company also announced plans to consolidate its production facilities during the two following years, resulting in the shutdown of seven North American manufacturing facilities: Fullerton, California, San Leandro, California, Federalsburg, Maryland, St. Marys, Ontario, Campbell, New York, Lehigh Valley, Pennsylvania; and Madison. In August 2017, Bloomberg Businessweek reported that the company planned to spend $10 million to reinvent the hot dog for a more health-conscious consumer. According to company research, this new strategy could increase sales of their hot dogs by 6%. Advertisements Wienermobile in Gilford, New Hampshire Oscar Mayer had several advertisements on TV involving young children, including the Oscar Mayer Wiener ad in 1963. The commercial shows a young girl leading a group of children, singing about what they would get if they \\"were an Oscar Mayer wiener\\". It was written by Richard D. Trentlage.Richard D. Trentlage, 87, Who Wrote 'The Oscar Mayer Wiener Song,' Dies The New York Times, September 29, 2016 A 1974 TV commercial featured 4-year-old Andy Lambros holding a fishing rod and sandwich while singing, \\"My bologna has a first name, it's 'O-S-C-A-R'...\\". It became one of the longest- running TV commercials in the country. A very early commercial jingle, possibly limited to radio, went something like this: \\"Acquire / the desire / to buy Oscar Mayer. / Famous for quality since 1883. / Look for the famous yellow band. / All meat sausage, / flavor's grand. / Be a wise and happy buyer, / and buy Oscar Mayer.\\" The actual words of the jingle may be slightly different.. Oscar Mayer is known for its Wienermobile, which has toured the United States for over 70 years. The first Wienermobile was created in 1936. In 2019, Oscar Mayers started sponsoring Ryan Newman in the NASCAR cup series in the number 6 Roush Fenway Racing car.

In general, the term \\"Science of Mind\\" applies to the teachings, while the term \\"Religious Science\\" applies to the organizations. However, adherents often use the terms interchangeably. In his book, The Science of Mind, Ernest Holmes stated \\"Religious Science is a correlation of laws of science, opinions of philosophy, and revelations of religion applied to human needs and the aspirations of man.\\" He also stated that Religious Science/Science of Mind (RS/SOM) is not based on any \\"authority\\" of established beliefs, but rather on \\"what it can accomplish\\" for the people who practice it.Vahle(1993) p7 Today the International Centers for Spiritual Living, the United Centers for Spiritual Living (which combined into the Centers for Spiritual Living in 2011) and Global Religious Science Ministries are the main denominations promoting Religious Science. History Ernest Holmes did not originally intend for RS/SOM to be a \\"church\\", but rather a teaching institution. In that spirit, many member \\"churches\\" have traditionally referred to themselves as \\"centers\\". The mental healing work of Phineas Quimby was a source of inspiration to much of the New Thought movement, including RS/SOM. Ernest Holmes was especially strongly influenced by Emma Curtis Hopkins, a former student of Christian Science, especially her \\"Scientific Christian Mental Practice\\", a direct precursor to Holmes' \\"Spiritual Mind Treatment\\", and by the writings of Judge Thomas Troward and Ralph Waldo Emerson, as he developed his own synthesis, which became known as Religious Science or Science of Mind.Braden p.295, 289‚Äì291Anderson (2003) pp. 26‚Äì28 In 1926 Holmes published The Science of Mind,Holmes. Ernest (1926). The Science of Mind. which references the teachings of Jesus Christ,Holmes, Ernest (1926) SOM Publishing, Science of Mind pages 87, 98 ... etc ... 496. the Bible Holmes, Ernest (1936) SOM Publishing, Science on Mind p.483-504 and Buddha.Holmes, Ernest (1926) SOM Publishing, Science of Mind pgs. 76, 78, 329, 342, 344, 428 Holmes established the Institute for Religious Science and School of Philosophy in Los Angeles. This organization would later become the Church of Religious Science. Holmes had previously studied another New Thought teaching, Divine Science, and he was an ordained Divine Science Minister.Glenn R. Mosley (2006) Templeton Foundation Press, New Thought, Ancient Wisdom p.47 He saw humans as being \\"open at the top\\"‚Äîthat is, open to evolutionary improvement of consciousness in all areas of life.Vahle (1993) p. 146 The concepts of \\"Open at the Top\\" and \\"New Thought\\" have inspired RS/SOM organizations and their teachings to evolve over the years. As stated in the book New Thought: A Practical American Spirituality, \\"New Thought still is evolving; it may yet be the point at which religion, philosophy, and science come together as the most effective combination to move the world to greater peace, plenty, health, and harmony. Many believe it might be the quintessential spirituality for the next millennium.\\" Anderson (2003), Introduction. His teachings attracted famous celebrities of his time including Cecil B. DeMille, Peggy Lee, and Cary Grant.Vahle (1993) pp. 2‚Äì3  Teaching and practice  The RS/SOM teaching generally incorporates idealistic and panentheistic philosophies. RS/SOM teaches that all beings are expressions of and part of Infinite Intelligence, also known as Spirit, Christ Consciousness, or God. It teaches that, because God is all there is in the universe (not just present in Heaven, or in assigned deities, as believed by traditional teachings), its power can be used by all humans to the extent that they recognize and align themselves with Its presence.What We Believe, Ernest Holmes Ernest Holmes said \\"God is not ... a person, but a Universal Presence ... already in our own soul, already operating through our own consciousness.\\" The introduction to The Science of Mind text describes \\"The Thing Itself\\" (God or Infinite Intelligence), \\"The Way It Works\\", \\"What It Does\\" and \\"How to Use It\\".Holmes(1926) pp. 25-60 Although Holmes was criticized for not focusing much on love, he did say that \\"Love rules through Law.\\" (i.e., the Law of Mind or Cause and Effect) and \\"Love points the way and Law makes the way possible.\\" Vahle(1993) pp. 12, 13Holmes(1926) p43 The \\"Law of Cause and Effect\\" simply states that every action has a consequence -- creative, destructive, or neutral. It can be described as Jesus Christ stated \\"You reap what you sow\\" and \\"The bread you cast upon the water, comes back to you\\". The Law of Attraction is one aspect of that Law. It differs from the Hindu definition of karma in that it is not related to reincarnation and that it happens in this life.Definition of \\"karma\\" Personal responsibility is a major tenet of RS/SOM. RS/SOM teaches that people can achieve more fulfilling lives through the practice called Spiritual Mind Treatment (Treatment), or Affirmative Prayer. Spiritual Mind Treatment is a step-by-step process, in which one states the desired outcome as if it has already happened. In that way, it differs from traditional prayer, since it does not ask an entity separate from itself to act. It declares human partnership with Infinite Intelligence to achieve success. Treatment is to be stated as personal (first person), positive, powerful (with feeling), and present (is happening right now). The goal is to gain clarity in thinking that guides action to be consistent with the desired outcome. The Treatment is believed to set off a new chain of causation in Mind that leads one to act according to the good for which one is treating.Holmes(1926) pp. 181-323 Spiritual Mind Treatment, as currently taught in RS/SOM centers, contains five steps: Recognition, Unification, Declaration, Thanksgiving, and Release.Vahle(1993) p150 Some adherents of RS/SOM also use supplemental meditation techniques, including \\"Visioning\\".Visioning, United Church of Religious Science Beliefs Religious Science credo, adapted from Ernest Holmes \\"What I Believe\\":\\"What We Believe\\", United Church of Religious Science  Core concepts  According to The Science of Mind, the ten core concepts of RS/SOM (as taught in the \\"Foundations of Science of Mind\\" class) are:Holmes(1926) pp. 63-105, 108-111, 137-162, 266-293, 357-389 #There is One Cosmic Reality Principle and Presence in the Universe -- commonly called \\"God\\". All creation originates in this One Source. EXPLANATION: God is not one thing, but rather is an Energy Source or Infinite Intelligence present in everything in the Cosmos (i.e. everything seen and unseen in this and all other parallel dimensions of the Universe). #God is threefold (triune) in nature, having three aspects or modes of being within the One: Spirit, Soul and Body. This is God seen as the Universal Macrocosm. EXPLANATION: The term \\"Universal Macrocosm\\" is another term for all dimensions of the Universe. #Spirit is the great Causative Power of the Universe. The Word, or thought, of God eternally initiates the Divine Creative Process. In this process, Law is continuously set in motion to create, from the Unformed Substance, innumerable forms which follow the thought-patterns of Spirit. EXPLANATION: God consciously initiates creation with thought and thereby forms all things from unformed substance by using Its \\"Soul\\" (i.e. the impersonal Law of Cause and Effect -- that is \\"What you sow is what you reap.\\" See further explanation in the second paragraph of this \\"Teachings and Practices\\" Section. Since God is in everything (see #1), humans include God; and humans can use that God-energy to create, on the human level. #In the Infinite Nature of God, all conceivable Good is eternally available, ready to flow into human experience. Through some cosmic Process, this flow of Good is activated and/or increased by human belief, faith, and acceptance. The expression of this essential belief, faith, and acceptance is prayer. EXPLANATION: \\"Prayer\\" is \\"Spiritual Mind Treatment\\" (see third paragraph of this section, above). This is the main Religious Science technique to tap into God (defined in #1 as \\"present in everything\\" -- i.e. Its \\"Infinite Nature\\") to create all the good we desire on the human level, analogous to God creating on the Universe level (see #3). This requires faith in the knowledge that the technique is working right now. #This is a Universe of Wholeness, Allness, Oneness. Spirit is a transcendent, perfect Wholeness that, in Its infinite inclusivity, harmoniously embraces all seeming opposites. EXPLANATION: Since God is present throughout the Universe these are some of the attributes of God. #This is a Universe of infinite abundance, spiritual, mental, and physical. This Bounty of Spirit, this Allness of Good, is limitless and can never be depleted. EXPLANATION: These are some more of the attributes of God. #This is a reciprocal Universe. For every visible form, there is an invisible counterpart. Everything in nature tends to equalize itself, to keep its balance true. EXPLANATION: This is the Law of Cause and Effect (See further explanation in the second paragraph of this \\"Teachings and Practices\\" Section). #The Universe exists in the Eternal Now, each moment complete and perfect within itself. In this Universal Harmony, justice without judgment is always automatic, an infallible Universal Principle. There can be no place for Divine anger, unforgiveness, or punishment. EXPLANATION: God's and human's thoughts, actions, and manifestations can only occur in the present. The Law of Cause and Effect is always working. We make our \\"Heaven and Hell\\" experiences every moment in the present, with the choices we make. To the extent that mankind achieves the Divine attributes, it evolves into God's attributes. #Immortality is a Universal Principle, not a \\"belief' or a bargain made with the Universe for good behavior. God knows only Life, its eternal continuity, evolution, and expansion. EXPLANATION: Religious Scientists know (rather than believe) that life evolves in this as well as all other dimensions, even after our souls make their transition into those dimensions. In this case, the term \\"Universal\\" means \\"no exceptions.\\" #The mystic concept of the Cosmic Christ is not that of a person, but of a Principle, a Universal Presence ... the Universal Image of God present in all creation ... the \\"pattern that connects.\\" EXPLANATION: The term \\"Cosmic Christ\\" here is a metaphor for that God-like consciousness that was and is present in all the Prophets and other enlightened people who have and are using this Principle to assist in the positive evolution of mankind, society, and/or their own personal lives. \\"Christ\\" was not Jesus' last name, but rather a title for an enlightened person, or \\"anointed one\\" that was created and given to him before the 12th century A.D.Christ, Merriam Webster on-line Dictionary Early Hebrew kings were given the title \\"Christ.\\" \\"Light From the Language of Jesus,\\" by Rocco A. Errico, Science of Mind Magazine, September 1990  Organizations  Founder's Church, Los Angeles There are three major organizations for Religious Science: Centers for Spiritual Living, the Affiliated New Thought Network, and the Global Religious Science Ministries.

Early life Robinson was born at Cleasby, North Yorkshire, near Darlington, a son of John Robinson (died 1651). Educated at Brasenose College, Oxford, he became a fellow of Oriel College, and in about 1680 he became chaplain to the British embassy to Stockholm. He remained in Sweden for nearly thirty years. During the absence of the minister, Philip Warwick, Robinson acted as resident and as envoy extraordinary, and he was thus in Sweden during a very interesting and important period, and was performing diplomatic duties at a time when the affairs of northern Europe were attracting an unusual amount of attention. Among his adventures not the least noteworthy was his journey to Narva with Charles XII in 1700. In 1709 Robinson returned to England, and was appointed Dean of Windsor and of Wolverhampton; in 1710 he was elected bishop of Bristol, and among other ecclesiastical positions he held that of Dean of the Chapel Royal. In August 1711 he became Lord Privy Seal, this being, says Lord Stanhope, \\"the last time that a bishop has been called upon to fill a political office.\\" Echoing his Scandinavian connections, the motto on his coat of arms is written in runic characters. In 1712 the bishop represented Great Britain at the important congress of Utrecht, and as first plenipotentiary he signed the treaty of Utrecht in April 1713 that ended the War of the Spanish Succession. Just after his return to England he was chosen Bishop of London in succession to Henry Compton. In 1718 he fostered a plan for the union of the English and Swedish churches, supported by Count Gyllenberg, Swedish Ambassador to London. The plan fell through because of the opposition of most Swedish bishops, although Svedberg of Skara and Gezelius, Bishop of Turku (Finland) were in favour. The reason for the opposition was that the Church of England was too Calvinist for them . He died at Hampstead, having been a great benefactor to Oriel College, and is buried at All Saints Church, Fulham, London. Writings Robinson wrote an Account of Sweden together with an Extract of the History of that Kingdom. By a person of note who resided many years there (London, 1695). This was translated into French (Amsterdam, 1712), and in 1738 was published with Viscount Molesworth's Account of Denmark in 1692. Some of his letters are among the Strafford papers in the British Museum. Other A member of the same family was Sir Frederick Philipse Robinson and Gary Weiss, critic of Patrick M. Byrne. Robinson's older brother, Christopher Robinson, immigrated to the Virginia Colony and became the patriarch of one of Virginia's First Families. He is also related to Christopher Robinson and the Robinson political family of Upper Canada.

In the words of its constitution: :The UISPP is committed to promote prehistoric and protohistoric studies by the organisation of international congresses and of large-scale excavations of international significance; by sponsoring scholarly publications of international scope as well as conferences and other learned meetings; and in general by advancing research by the co-operation and mutual understanding among scholars from all countries.  Origins  The origins of the IUPPS lie in an 1865 meeting of the Societ√† Italiana di Scienze Naturali () that led to the creation of the Congr√®s pal√©oethnologique international (CPI; ). The first meeting of the CPI was held in Neuch√¢tel in 1866. The following year, in Paris, the name was changed to Congr√®s international d'anthropologie et d'arch√©ologie pr√©historiques (CIAAP; International Congress of Prehistoric Anthropology and Archaeology). A permanent council of the CIAAP was founded in 1880, and in 1930 a merger with the Institut International d'Anthropologie led to the creation of the Congr√®s international des Sciences pr√©historiques et protohistoriques (CISPP). In 1954, the permanent council decided to affiliate the CISPP with a member organisation of UNESCO, the International Council for Philosophy and Human Sciences. This required a change of name, and the CISPP became the International Union for Prehistoric and Protohistoric Sciences (IUPPS) in order to gain access to UNESCO funds. UISPP became a member of the Unesco associate International Council of Philosophy and Human Sciences, since September 29th, 1955. As an international association of scholars, its aim is the collaboration of scholars from all countries through initiatives that may contribute for the advancement of prehistoric and protohistoric sciences, based on full academic freedom and refusing any sort of discrimination based on race, philosophical or ideological judgement, ethnic or geographic affiliation, nationality, sex, language or other, since discrimination is, by definition, the negation of the scientific approach. It also rejects any attempts of fictional rewriting of the past or of negationism, and it doesn‚Äôt exclude any bona fide scholar from its scientific activities.  Executive Committee  The executive committee of UISPP serves the purpose of maintaining the traditions of the UISPP and follows the development of the activities within the UISPP. It works in collaboration with the bureau, when asked, to represent the UISPP and to follow up the activities of the scientific commissions. The executive committee follows up the progress of the organization of the world congress, does only intervene in the organization of it when unexpected events appear or when important delays in the program proposed by the organizing institution are noted. It is composed by the Board (President, Secretary-General, Treasurer, Vice-President, Deputy Secretary- General) and the Presidents of all International Scientific Commissions of UISPP.  Scientific Commissions  The general assembly decides of the creation of scientific commissions, after advice of the executive committee. Their objective is to promote and coordinate internationally research in a specific or specialized domain of the prehistoric and protohistoric sciences between each world congress. The commissions are grouped into six larger domains. This list is not limited.  Historiography, methods and theories (history of archaeology, theories and methods in archaeology, various methods used in the archaeology and related to sciences, natural sciences, applied sciences, biological sciences, social sciences, economic sciences, etc.),  Culture, economy and environments (specific periods, diachronic themes, regional peculiarities),  Cultures and economy,  Archaeology of specific environments (deserts, mountains, volcanic areas, coastal areas, islands, etc.),  Art and culture (all forms of artistic expression during prehistory and protohistory, including parietal art and mobile art),  Archaeology and societies (interaction between archaeology and current society, including strategies for heritage management or for scientific research, and questions of the public). The principal activities of a scientific commission are: The setting up of an annual meeting of the commission, to elaborate an activity program for the next year and accept the report of the previous meeting, The dispersion of an electronic newsletter, at least once a year, for the members of the commission, with copy to the secretary general and with a list of all the members of the commission, as well as their corresponding email and postal address, The organization of scientific activities (colloquia, conferences, sessions, thematic schools) during each UISPP world congress and at least once in between; these activities are published.

Whereas the majority of UISPP members rejected the split as a divide of researchers and an opportunist move, writing in 1987, Peter Ucko still described the IUPPS as, :a dinosaur which continues to seek to manipulate the world situation according to its archaic Western European preconceptions about what is relevant and important and what is not. It does so by devices such as the imposition of white rules and regulations which no one bothers to explain and by the manipulation of bureaucratic procedures. UISPP lamented this approach and kept its activity. Since 2005 relations between UISPP and WAC were resumed. Despite initial divides, UISPP remained focused in prehistoric and protohistoric research, while WAC evolved primarily into political committed approaches, the two organisations having therefore different scopes. The XVIII world Congress of UISPP will be held in Paris, June 2018. It will have as a major topic \\"Adaptation and sustainability of prehistoric and protohistoric societies confronted to climate change\\". This major congress will be articulated with the current refoundation of Humanities that is being led by the International Council for the Philosophy and Human Sciences (that includes UISPP) and UNESCO. As for each worldwide UISPP congress, the congress is opened to any other sessions, independently of the above general theme, which could be proposed during the general call for sessions.

It is located approximately 40 kilometers east of Frankfurt am Main, between the Vogelsberg mountains and the Spessart range at the river Kinzig. It is one of the eleven towns (urban municipalities) in the district. Gelnhausen has around 22,000 inhabitants. Geography Location Constituent communities According to the Institut G√©ographique National from 1 January 2007 until July 2013 the geographic centre of the European Union was located on a wheat field outside the town. Gelnhausen is located on the German Fairy Tale Route, a tourist route. History Obermarkt Philip Reis, an early telephone inventor Gelnhausen was founded by Emperor Frederick Barbarossa in 1170, it is therefore nicknamed \\"Barbarossastadt\\". The place was chosen because it was at the intersection of the Via Regia imperial road between Frankfurt and Leipzig and several other major trade routes. Frederick had three villages connected by streets and surrounded by a wall. At the same time, Gelnhausen received town privileges and a Kaiserpfalz was erected on an island of the Kinzig river. The emperor also granted trade privileges like the staple right which forced traveling merchants to offer their goods in the town for three days. Hence Gelnhausen initially was a thriving trade town and head of a league of 16 towns of the Wetterau region. However prosperity came to an end already in 1326 when Emperor Louis IV gave the town in pawn to the counts of Hanau, redeemed shortly afterwards. In 1349 Count G√ºnther von Schwarzburg received Gelnhausen from Emperor Charles IV for renouncing his claims as elected King of the Romans, in condominium with the counts of Hohnstein, who sold their share to Schwarzburg in 1431. Schwarzburg was acquired in 1435 by Elector Palatine Louis III and the Hanau, since raised to a county. Repeated plundering in the Thirty Years' War as depicted by Hans Jakob Christoffel von Grimmelshausen in his novel Simplicius Simplicissimus made it nearly uninhabitable. In 1736, the extinction of the comital line of Hanau meant the condominium share was inherited by the Landgraviate of Hesse-Kassel, who acquired the Palatinate's share ten years later. The varying lords made continued attempts to challenge Gelnhausen's imperial immediacy, it however formally remained a Reichsstadt. During the German Mediatisation of 1803 the city became a part of the Landgraviate of Hesse-Kassel, which was raised to an electorate and, after the Austro-Prussian War of 1866, was annexed by Prussia. At this time Gelnhausen had completely recovered, and with the Gr√ºnderzeit economic boom it became a centre of the German rubber industry. The Holocaust During the Nazi era, Gelnhausen was reported judenfrei on November 1, 1938, by propaganda newspaper Kinzigwacht after its synagogue was closed and remaining local Jews forced to leave the town. From the 1930s Gelnhausen was a garrison town of the German Wehrmacht and, after World War II, of the United States Army. The US Army closed Coleman Kaserne in 2007. In 1996, the town hosted the 36th Hessentag state festival. Arts and culture Attractions Sights include: * Medieval town center with historic buildings like the ' and the ' *The Kaiserpfalz Gelnhausen. The castle was erected at the time of Gelnhausen's foundation southeast of the town on an island in the Kinzig river. The groundwork is stabilized by 12,000 logs, driven into the earth. Today it is the best preserved Kaiserpfalz from this era. *The ', the most recognizable landmark of Gelnhausen. It shows both Romanesque (like the six-storey west tower) and Gothic architecture (the octagonal crossing tower and the east towers) elements. The church was built from local bunter between 1170 and 1250 by Selbold Abbey, replacing a simple chapel from ca. 1100 of which some traces remain. In 1543, Gelnhausen turned Protestant and the church became the Protestant parish church. *The Catholic church of . Its origins lie in the early 13th century; rich citizens of Gelnhausen planned to erect a church within the town, causing a conflict with the Selbold Abbey that owned the clerical patronage for Gelnhausen. This conflict was escalated up to Pope Gregory IX who decided in favour of the abbey. From the 13th to the 15th century the church was used for weddings, baptisms, and funerals. After the Reformation, the building became the property of the town. It subsequently fell into ruin and was sold in 1830 to a local merchant. After the demolition of the second tower, a cigar factory was built in it. In 1920, the Catholic community of Gelnhausen bought the church and partly restored it over an 18-year period. A complete restoration took place in 1982‚Äì3.

His father, Colonel Beverley Robinson, was a Virginian who moved to New York, marrying a wealthy heiress of the Philipse family with Dutch and Bohemian(William Jay, The Life of John Jay: with selection of his correspondence and miscellaneous papers. New York: J. & J Harper, 1833, p. 10). On his Bohemian aristocratic ancestry, see also: Thomas Capek, Ancestry of Frederick Philipse: First Lord and Founder of Philipse Manor at Yonkers, N. Y. New York: The Paebar Co., 1939. ancestry, Susanna Philipse. Frederick was born in the Hudson Highlands on the family estate in the Philipse Patent, today's Putnam County, New York, in September 1763. On the conclusion of peace he went to England. He subsequently took part in the War of 1812 with the United States and commanded a brigade at the unsuccessful Battle of Plattsburgh. In 1813 and 1814 he commanded a brigade under the Duke of Wellington in Spain. He was a provisional Lieutenant-Governor of Upper Canada in 1815. Afterwards he was governor of Tobago, and he became a general in 1841. In time he became the oldest soldier in the British service, and died at Brighton, England, at the age of 88.  Ancestry  He was the fourth son of Colonel Beverley Robinson, son of John Robinson, President of the Council at Virginia, North America. The Robinsons were, in property and family, among the leading men in that province. John Robinson was nephew to Dr. John Robinson, Bishop of London, and went to America as secretary to government. He resided at Williamsburg and married Catherine Beverley, daughter of Robert Beverley, Esq., of Beverley, Yorkshire. Dr. John Robinson, Bishop of London, was distinguished both as a statesman and a divine. He was ambassador to the court of Sweden during the years 1683 to 1708. In the year 1710 he was made Bishop of Bristol, in the following year Lord Privy Seal. In 1712 he was first plenipotentiary at the Treaty of Utrecht, and soon after his return was translated to the See of London. He lies buried in the churchyard at Fulham. Colonel Beverley Robinson arrived in New York from Virginia in 1745 as captain of an independent company, raised before leaving for the purpose of defending the frontier against the Indians, which company was disbanded in 1748. He soon afterward married Susannah Philipse, daughter of Frederick Philipse, second Lord of Philipsburg Manor, with whom he obtained large pieces of property in New York as his wife's share of the Philipse Patent. As all Philipses were Loyal to the Crown during the American Revolution, the Beverlys holdings were seized in 1779 by the Revolutionary government of the Province of New YorkPurple, Edwin R., \\"Contributions to the History of the Ancient Families of New York: Varleth-Varlet-Varleet-Verlet-Verleth,\\" New York Genealogical and Biographical Record, vol. 9 (1878), pp. 120-121 and were never compensated for their loss. Colonel Robinson died at Bath in March 1792 leaving a numerous family.  America  At the earliest commencement of the American war Colonel Beverley Robinson raised the Loyal American Regiment, which performed signal service to the royal cause until the peace in 1783. In this regiment young Frederick Philipse Robinson received an ensigncy in February 1777, and on 1 September 1778 he was appointed to the 17th Foot, which he joined in October following. In March, 1779, he commanded a company, in the absence of his captain, at the Battle of Horseneck, under General William Tryon. In July, 1779, being in garrison at the post of Stony Point on the Hudson River, the place was stormed at midnight by a strong force of the Americans under General Anthony Wayne, and after a sharp and close conflict of more than an hour, during which the young ensign was wounded in the shoulder by a musket ball, he found himself a prisoner of war. Whilst detained as such at Lancaster, Pennsylvania, he was promoted to be Lieutenant in the 60th Foot on 1 September 1779, and transferred to the 38th Foot on 4 November 1781. Upon being released by order of General George Washington, said to have been a childhood friend of his father in Virginia, joined that regiment the end of November at Brooklyn, New York. The year 1783, which gave peace to Europe and America, destroyed the hopes of the American loyalists. They were involved in one general proscription, and obliged to abandon their property, which had been declared forfeited in 1779 for their attachment to the royal cause. The evacuation of New York took place in 1783‚Äîthe 38th formed one of the six regiments which remained until the final embarkation, and arrived at Portsmouth January 1784. In spite of a provision in the Treaty of Paris ending the conflict requiring those whose property was attained by the Colonial government to be compensated for their losses none was ever forthcoming to the Robinsons or other heirs of the Philipse estates.  West Indies  After serving in England and Ireland during the following nine years, Lieut. Robinson embarked with his regiment at Cork on 24 November 1793, forming part of Sir Charles Grey's expedition to the West Indies. He was present at the capture of Martinique, St. Lucia, and Guadeloupe, including the storming of Fleur-de-l'√âp√©e, and the heights of Palmonte. He was promoted to a company, 3 July 1794, and commanded the Grenadiers until after the capture of Guadeloupe, when, his health having suffered severely from the climate, he returned to England on sick certificate. Bedford and London On 1 September 1794, Capt. Robinson was gazetted Major of the 127th Foot, and removed to the 32nd Foot 1 September 1795. Some time afterwards he was appointed Inspecting Field Officer at Bedford, received the rank of Lieut.-Colonel in the Army 1 January 1800, and the command of the London Recruiting District, in February 1809. He was actively employed in organising and drilling the Volunteers in the metropolis. In December 1803, the Bank of England Supplementary Volunteer Corp presented Lieut.-Colonel Robinson with a splendid piece of plate, \\"as a testimony of their respect and esteem, and the high sense they entertain of his great attention in bringing them to their present state of discipline.\\" By 1807, the then Col. Robinson had commanded London Recruiting District, and the Pimlico battalion of the Queen's Loyal Volunteers from about 1803. Robinson was posted to London from Bedford, c 1801. On Friday 8 May 1807, he addressed a meeting at Covent Garden, London where he introduced Col. Eliot to the meeting, as the prospective parliamentary candidate for Westminster in the 1807 United Kingdom general election.  Peninsula  On 25 July 1810, he became Colonel in the army, and having from the commencement of the war in the Peninsula most earnestly desired permission to serve with the force under Wellington, his request was at length granted, and in September 1812, Colonel Robinson joined the army in Spain as a Brigadier-General. On 4 June 1813, he became a Major- General. No opportunity occurred of distinguishing himself until the action at Osona on 18 June 1813, on which occasion his conduct was especially noticed. On 21 June, the memorable battle of Vittoria took place, in which General Robinson commanded the brigade which carried the village of Gamarra-Mayor at the point of the bayonet under a heavy fire of artillery and musketry, repulsing the numerous desperate efforts of the enemy to recover it. Sir Thomas Graham (Lord Lynedoch), in his order thanking the column, states: :\\"The attack of the village of Gamarra by Major-General Robinson's brigade was justly admired by all who witnessed it. Too much praise cannot be given to Major-General Robinson and the troops of his brigade for their persevering defence of a post so gallantly won, against numerous artillery and great masses of infantry, the enemy employed to retake it, in repeated attacks.\\" On 21 July 1813, General Robinson took part in the first assault of St. Sebastian, and on 31 August he commanded the attacking column at the second and successful assault, and was severely wounded. On 7 October following, the Major-General was at the head of the leading column at the passage of the Bidassoa; on 9 November was at the attack of Secoa and the Heights of Cibour; on 10 December, at the battle of the Nive, was again severely wounded. He recovered to take part in the operations at the blockade of Bayonne and the repulse of the sortie on 14 April 1814, when he succeeded to the command of the fifth division.  Canada, War of 1812  In June 1814, the Duke of Wellington selected General Robinson to proceed in command of a brigade to North America, and he accordingly embarked at Bordeaux with battalions of the 27th, 39th, 76th, and 88th regiments, and arrived at Brandypots, 100 miles below Quebec, on 9 August 1814. In September he commanded two brigades intended to attack the works of Plattsburg during the War of 1812, but after having gallantly forced the passage of the Saranac, received orders from Sir George Prevost to retire. In November following, he was appointed Commander- in-Chief and Provisional Governor of the Upper Provinces in Canada, which he held until June, 1816, when he returned to England. Tobago He afterwards became Governor and Commander-in-Chief of Tobago from 1816 to 1828, ‚Äúfulfilling the duties to the entire satisfaction of the home government and the inhabitants of the colony‚Äù although from all appearances, a \\"flat statement in which even his own defense exposes as being an uncharacteristically flawed  Personal  On 2 January 1815, General Robinson was nominated a Knight Commander of the Order of the Bath, and he was advanced to be a Grand Cross in 1838. He attained the rank of Lieut.-General 27 May 1825, and that of General 23 November 1841; and was appointed to the command of the 39th regiment on 15 June 1840. Sir Frederick Philipse Robinson lived to become the oldest soldier in the British service, his first commission being of earlier date than those of the few general officers whose names preceded his in the Army List. For the last seven years he resided at Brighton, Sussex, in the possession of good health and in the exercise of all his mental faculties, enjoying the affectionate attendance of a beloved daughter and niece, and the society of an attached circle of friends, to whom be had endeared himself by his noble and amiable qualities. He died after a very few days illness on the first day of 1852, and on 7 January his honoured remains were consigned to their last resting-place in the churchyard of Hove, near Brighton. Sir Frederick was twice married: Firstly, cir early 1790s, to Grace Boles, daughter of Thomas Boles, Esq., of Charleville, who died in 1806, with issue including: :Maria Susan Robinson (born 18 November 1793, bapt 1 December 1802 St Peter, Bedford) :Frederick Philipse Robinson (born 20 January 1797, bapt 1 December 1802 St Peter Bedford) :Beverley George Robinson (born 31 January 1799, bapt 1 December 1802 St Peter, Bedford) :Jane Robinson (born 28 January 1802, bapt 1 December 1802 St Peter, Bedford) Secondly, in 1811, to Ann Fernyhough, of Stafford, who died at Tobago.

Several conflicting images emerge of Ramsay regarding his conduct amongst the native people of the region while engaged as a trader. One cluster of accounts preserved in the 18th and 19th century oral tradition of Loyalist settlers in the area around Long Point, Ontario, draws mostly on stories told by the wife of local settler Frederick Mabee in the early 19th century and portray Ramsay as a quintessential \\"pioneer hero\\" figure who strikes out at local natives only in preservation of his life and property, against the onslaught of the local Ojibwa people who sought to harm him without cause. Another perspective, derived from native oral accounts in the early 19th century by missionary Peter Jones, present a decidedly different version of Ramsay's activities in Upper Canada. This latter version is also more in keeping with Ramsay's own legal declaration on May 15, 1772, at Fort Niagara, after he surrendered himself to British colonial legal authorities. In this account, Ramsay confessed that in March 1772, on the banks of Kettle Creek north of the present day community of Port Stanley, Ontario, \\"in defense of his life\\", he had killed an Ojibwa man named Wandagan, as well as two women who were also present while other natives were absent from the camp. Ramsay also admitted that he had scalped all three adult individuals involved and also kidnapped two local children who were in the company of the natives, one aged twelve, removing them to the Long Point area. The following month he claimed to have been approached by local Ojibwas in the vicinity of Long Point, and after lying to them regarding the origin of the children, who he claimed were \\"English\\", was taken prisoner, tied up, and placed by the fire. Ramsay stated in his declaration that he then managed to release his bonds, and proceeded to kill four adult natives and a child before making an escape. In all cases Ramsay maintained that he had acted in defense of his life and property and that he had initially been accosted by the Ojibwa on Kettle Creek when he had refused them a share in his cache of trade alcohol. British colonial Superintendent of Indian Affairs at the time, Sir William Johnson, who had read Ramsay's declaration and conferred with local native informants, believed that Ramsay's actions were not in self-defense, but rather constituted homicide and concluded that the murders and scalpings were \\"inexcusable and the circumstances of his being able to do all this, is an evident proof that he was not in the danger he represents and that the Indians were too much in the liquor to execute any bad purpose.\\"Schmalz, Peter S. (1991), The Ojibwa of Southern Ontario, University of Toronto Press. Pg. 89; Ramsay's actions, in particular his scalping of his victims which according to Ojibwa custom constituted an act of war, precipitated a crisis in relations between British colonial authorities and the regional native population. Johnson attributed the killings to the \\"private act of a villain\\", not official British policy, and achieved an at least temporary resolution to the situation, by distributing a shipment of gifts to native leaders in the area. Johnson also ordered the recall of all regional traders to local military posts until further notice and called for a redistribution of British troops in the region in the face of potential open conflict. He further ordered the transfer of the prisoner Ramsay to Montreal for a criminal trial. Johnson stated that he believed that Ramsay deserved \\"capital punishment\\" for his actions, but believed that a fair trial was unobtainable under the circumstances and personally did not \\"think that [Ramsay] will suffer, had he killed a hundred.\\" Johnson's prediction held true and despite Ramsay allegedly bragging about the killings while under guard in Montreal and indicating that he would repeat his actions upon release, received no punishment, at least partly due to the prosecution providing no native witnesses. There is some evidence to suggest that Ramsay, later in life, modified his attitude toward native people and is known to have acted on their behalf in several matters pertaining to issues between them and the colonial government. Almost nothing is known about Ramsay in later life, apart from his possession of a large tract of land in Upper Canada and his ownership of a trading ship in the port of New York. Ramsay disappears from the historical record circa 1810. David Ramsay In local legend A number of regional legends, traceable to stories told by white settlers in the mid to late 19th century in southern Ontario, have arisen surrounding the figure of David Ramsay. In one such tale, Ramsay is presented as a fur-trader who manages to evade natives along the north shore of Lake Erie with a boat loaded with gold, which he purportedly buries in a ridge at Long Point, planning to dig it up when the natives were no longer a problem. According to the tale, Ramsay died before retrieving it, forgot all about his cache, or most likely forgot exactly where it was buried. A deacon named John Troyer learned of the legend, and reputedly using divination, acquired knowledge of its exact location. Troyer purportedly invited an 11- or 12-year- old boy, Simpson McCall, to help him claim the treasure. McCall's parents refused, fearing the Deacon's reputation. In one version of the tale excerpted from the Niagara Falls Evening Review of October 19, 1922, Troyer and the boy, in this variant referred to as his \\"son\\", go in quest of the treasure: \\"They went to Long Point, arriving just enough before dark to locate the spot where the treasure was. Then they waited until exactly midnight, and then started a procession, Deacon Troyer holding the open Bible before him, and his son following with a lighted candle, with spades, picks, etc. They dug down, and presently the pick struck metal. They got the pick under the lid of the box and pried it up. And then, at that moment a black shape rose up and assumed the form of a black dog, growing bigger and bigger, and they dropped the Bible and candle and rushed for the canoe, and never had any curiosity to return to the spot.\\" This failed reclaiming story was purportedly told by Troyer to McCall, and McCall to J. H. Coyne, who made it public in an address at an Ontario Historical Society meeting in Norfolk County. This meeting was reported a few days later in the Niagara Falls Evening Review.

Traditionally, this has meant using only the first four of Euclid's postulates, but since these are not sufficient as a basis of Euclidean geometry, other systems, such as Hilbert's axioms without the parallel axiom, are used. The term was introduced by J√°nos Bolyai in 1832.In \\"Appendix exhibiting the absolute science of space: independent of the truth or falsity of Euclid's Axiom XI (by no means previously decided)\\" It is sometimes referred to as neutral geometry,Greenberg cites W. Prenowitz and M. Jordan (Greenberg, p. xvi) for having used the term neutral geometry to refer to that part of Euclidean geometry that does not depend on Euclid's parallel postulate. He says that the word absolute in absolute geometry misleadingly implies that all other geometries depend on it. as it is neutral with respect to the parallel postulate. Properties It might be imagined that absolute geometry is a rather weak system, but that is not the case. Indeed, in Euclid's Elements, the first 28 Propositions and Proposition 31 avoid using the parallel postulate, and therefore are valid in absolute geometry. One can also prove in absolute geometry the exterior angle theorem (an exterior angle of a triangle is larger than either of the remote angles), as well as the Saccheri‚ÄìLegendre theorem, which states that the sum of the measures of the angles in a triangle has at most 180¬∞.One sees the incompatibility of absolute geometry with elliptic geometry, because in the latter theory all triangles have angle sums greater than 180¬∞. Proposition 31 is the construction of a parallel line to a given line through a point not on the given line. As the proof only requires the use of Proposition 27 (the Alternate Interior Angle Theorem), it is a valid construction in absolute geometry. More precisely, given any line l and any point P not on l, there is at least one line through P which is parallel to l. This can be proved using a familiar construction: given a line l and a point P not on l, drop the perpendicular m from P to l, then erect a perpendicular n to m through P. By the alternate interior angle theorem, l is parallel to n. (The alternate interior angle theorem states that if lines a and b are cut by a transversal t such that there is a pair of congruent alternate interior angles, then a and b are parallel.) The foregoing construction, and the alternate interior angle theorem, do not depend on the parallel postulate and are therefore valid in absolute geometry. In absolute geometry it is also provable that two lines perpendicular to the same line cannot intersect (which makes the two lines parallel by definition of parallel lines), proving that the summit angles of a Saccheri quadrilateral cannot be obtuse, and that spherical geometry is not an absolute geometry. Relation to other geometries The theorems of absolute geometry hold in hyperbolic geometry, which is a non-Euclidean geometry, as well as in Euclidean geometry.Indeed, absolute geometry is in fact the intersection of hyperbolic geometry and Euclidean geometry when these are regarded as sets of propositions. Absolute geometry is inconsistent with elliptic geometry: in that theory, there are no parallel lines at all, but it is a theorem of absolute geometry that parallel lines do exist. However, it is possible to modify the axiom system so that absolute geometry, as defined by the modified system, will include spherical and elliptic geometries, that have no parallel lines. Absolute geometry is an extension of ordered geometry, and thus, all theorems in ordered geometry hold in absolute geometry. The converse is not true. Absolute geometry assumes the first four of Euclid's Axioms (or their equivalents), to be contrasted with affine geometry, which does not assume Euclid's third and fourth axioms. (3: \\"To describe a circle with any centre and distance radius.\\", 4: \\"That all right angles are equal to one another.\\" ) Ordered geometry is a common foundation of both absolute and affine geometry. The geometry of special relativity has been developed starting with nine axioms and eleven propositions of absolute geometry.Edwin B. Wilson & Gilbert N. Lewis (1912) \\"The Space-time Manifold of Relativity. The Non-Euclidean Geometry of Mechanics and Electromagnetics\\" Proceedings of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences 48:387‚Äì507Synthetic Spacetime, a digest of the axioms used, and theorems proved, by Wilson and Lewis. Archived by WebCite The authors Edwin B. Wilson and Gilbert N. Lewis then proceed beyond absolute geometry when they introduce hyperbolic rotation as the transformation relating two frames of reference. Hilbert planes A plane that satisfies Hilbert's Incidence, Betweeness and Congruence axioms is called a Hilbert plane. Hilbert planes are models of absolute geometry. Incompleteness Absolute geometry is an incomplete axiomatic system, in the sense that one can add extra independent axioms without making the axiom system inconsistent. One can extend absolute geometry by adding different axioms about parallel lines and get incompatible but consistent axiom systems, giving rise to Euclidean or hyperbolic geometry. Thus every theorem of absolute geometry is a theorem of hyperbolic geometry and Euclidean geometry. However the converse is not true.

The ship was on a trip from Grand Haven, Michigan, to Chicago, Illinois, and was spotted at 8:00 am on October 16 in heavy seas. Some time later, probably due to a shift in the cargo on deck caused by the waves, it capsized and drifted northwest.

Molesworth came of an old Northamptonshire family. He married Hon. Letitia Coote, daughter of Richard Coote, 1st Baron Coote, and Mary St. George. His father Robert (d. 1656) was a Cromwellian who made a fortune in Dublin, largely by provisioning Cromwell's army; Robert Molesworth the younger supported William of Orange and was made William's ambassador to Denmark. In 1695 he became a prominent member of the Privy Council of Ireland. The same year he stood for Dublin County in the Irish House of Commons, a seat he held until 1703. Subsequently, he represented Swords until 1715. In the following year, he was created Viscount Molesworth, of Swords, in the Peerage of Ireland. Molesworth's An Account of Denmark, as it was in the Year 1692 (published 1694) was somewhat influential in the burgeoning field of political science in the period. He made a case for comparative political analysis, comparing the political situation of a country to the health of an individual; a disease, he reasoned, can only be diagnosed by comparing it to its instantiation in other people (Thompson, 495). Life and career Robert Molesworth was born two days after his fathers' death on 9 September 1656; his mother Judith Bysse later remarried Sir William Tichborne of Beaulieu. He was probably raised by his mothers' family, the Bysses, at Brackenstown, near Swords, County Dublin. His grandfather, John Bysse, was an eminent lawyer who became Chief Baron of the Irish Exchequer under Charles II. In 1675, Robert graduated from Trinity College, Dublin with a B.A.. On 15 August 1676, shortly before his 20th birthday, he was married in Dublin to Letitia Coote, third daughter of Richard Coote (1620‚Äì1683), 1st Baron Coote of Colooney, and Mary St. George, daughter of George St. George, Deputy Admiral of Connaught. Letitia's brother Richard was created Earl of Bellomont and served as Governor of New York, Massachusetts and New Hampshire for William III from 1697 until his sudden death in 1701. Robert and Letitia Molesworth subsequently settled at the Bysse family seat, Brackenstown House, where according to a letter of 1721 Letitia bore seventeen children, nine of whom were still living at the time. On 7 May 1689, young Molesworth, an active supporter of the Williamites, was attainted by King James II's Catholic- dominated Irish Parliament. His estate, valued at ¬£2825 per annum, was duly confiscated. James had succeeded his brother Charles II as king of England, Ireland and Scotland early in 1685. Although initially fearful of alienating English and Irish Protestant opinion, James came under the influence of the Catholic Richard Talbot, 1st Earl of Tyrconnell and determined to make the island of Ireland a Catholic stronghold. Tyrconnell also secured the king's agreement to revise the 1662 Act of Settlement, which had confirmed many of the leading Cromwellian planters in their estates. Over the course of the next two years, war raged across Ireland between the rival armies of James II and the Dutch Protestant, William of Orange, who was invited to take the throne of England by the Parliament in 1688. The decisive victory of the Williamite forces at the battle of the Boyne in 1690, and the battle of Aughrim in 1691, confirmed the new Protestant monarchy and finally secured New English interests in Ireland. The age of the Protestant Ascendancy had begun. Robert Molesworth, an ardent Whig, became a prominent figure in the new Williamite administration. Contemporaries acknowledged his opinions on politics and economy with considerable respect. From July 1689 to December 1692 he served as British Ambassador to the Court of Denmark, during which time he wrote a spirited attack on Danish absolutism in a treatise entitled An Account of Denmark as it was in the Year 1692. From 1695 to 1698 he stood as Whig MP in both the English and Irish Parliaments, representing Camelford and Dublin City respectively. In August 1697, he was appointed to the Irish Privy Council, an effective cabinet charged with the governance of Ireland and the introduction of the \\"Penal Laws\\". From 1703 to 1715 he represented Swords as MP in the Irish Parliament. Between November 1714 and December 1715 he served in the fruitful post of Commissioner of Trade and Plantations. On 16 July 1716, Robert was advanced to the Irish peerage as Baron of Phillipstown and Viscount Molesworth of Swords \\"in reward for his steadfast adherence to the House of Hanover\\". He took his seat as such on 1 July 1719. In his later years he established the \\"Molesworth Circle\\", a group of eminent scientists, philosophers and thinkers who met at Brackenstown and are said to have introduced the spread of \\"politeness\\" in 18th century Ireland. Other members of this Whig-minded intellectual circle included Anthony Ashley Cooper, 3rd Earl of Shaftesbury, Francis Hutcheson, James Arbuckle, John Toland and Jonathan Swift. Molesworth's pamphlet Considerations on the Agriculture and Employment of the Poor of Ireland prompted Swift to address the last of his celebrated Drapier's Letters to Molesworth in 1724. When the so-called South Sea Bubble burst in 1720, the 1st Viscount was perhaps the most vehement of those seeking vengeance against the company directors. He and his grandson, Robert Molesworth, had invested heavily in the company. He advised that, as no law existed for punishing such companies, the government \\"ought upon this occasion follow the example of the ancient Romans, who, having no law against parricide, because their legislators supposed no son could be so unnaturally wicked as to embrue his hands in his father's blood, made a law to punish this heinous crime as soon as it was committed. They adjudged the guilty wretch to be sewn into a sack and thrown alive into the Tiber\\". The Whig statesman declared that he would be quite \\"satisfied to see [the South-Sea Company directors] tied in like manner in sacks, and thrown into the Thames.\\" Family With his wife Letitia, Molesworth had eleven sons and six daughters:Children of the 1st Viscount Molesworth - William Molesworth, MA (Cantab), MLitt (Dub)A Genealogical and Heraldic Dictionary of the Peerage and Baronetage of the British Empire, by Sir Bernard Burke. 1869 Edition, published by Harrison, 59 Pall Mall.

Biography A native of Berkeley, California, McCorkle studied Italian literature at University of California at Berkeley before dropping out to move to Europe. She was inspired to become a singer when she heard Billie Holiday sing \\"I've Got a Right to Sing the Blues\\". She began her career in the early 1970s by singing at pubs in London with bandleader John Chilton. She also worked in London with Keith Ingham and Dick Sudhalter and recorded her first two albums, one a tribute to Harry Warren, the other to Johnny Mercer. After moving back to the U.S. in the 1970s, she sang at the Cookery in Greenwich Village and the Riverboat in Manhattan. Later in her career she sang often at the Algonquin Hotel. No More Blues (1988), her first album for Concord Jazz, was recorded with guitarists Emily Remler and Bucky Pizzarelli and pianist Dave Frishberg. Her writing was published in Cosmopolitan, Newsday, New York, and the O. Henry Award Prize Stories. Stereo Review magazine named How Do You Keep the Music Playing (1986) album of the year, while critic Leonard Feather named it vocal album of the year. Death A breast cancer survivor, McCorkle suffered for many years from depression. She died by suicide at age 55 by leaping off the balcony of her apartment at 41 West 86th Street in Manhattan. She was alone in her home at the time. The police immediately entered her home after identifying her body and found no foul play. Suicide was ruled the cause of death. Haunted Heart, a biography of Susannah McCorkle written by Linda Dahl, was published in September 2006 by University of Michigan Press.

Education and early career He joined the Bar in Guna district in 1960 and enrolled as an advocate in 1962. In April 1977, he was recruited directly from the Bar to the State Higher Judicial Service and was appointed as a District & Sessions Judge. After functioning as a District & Sessions Judge for a year, he resigned in May 1978 and reverted to the Bar for practice mainly in the High Court. He was appointed the Additional Judge of the Madhya Pradesh High Court on 3 May 1988 and made permanent Judge on 4 August 1989. Lahoti was transferred to Delhi High Court on 7 February 1994. He was appointed as a Judge of Supreme Court of India on 9 December 1998. He retired on his 65th birthday giving him a term of 18 months. His predecessor had a term of just 1 month. Achievements Justice Lahoti, a noted jurist, is economic with words and probably the least vocal among recent Chief Justices. He served one of the longest terms as Chief Justice in recent years, retiring from office after 17 months. In November 2004, Chief Justice Lahoti, broke ground with many of his predecessors who had expressed concern about the growing corruption within the judiciary, by proclaiming that the judiciary in India was 'clean'. This was an astounding statement, especially in the light of frequent expos√©s in the media about errant judges across the country. Chief Justice's handling of judicial transfers has also attracted controversy. In February 2005, Chief Justice BK Roy was transferred from the Punjab and Haryana High Court to the Guwahati High Court, on Chief Justice Lahoti's watch. ;Population control Justice Lahoti upheld a Haryana law that did not allow those with more than two children to contest local body elections.

The album marks a new development in Vangelis' music, during which Vangelis moved his creative base from London to Athens in Greece, and it was his first album recorded in Athens after relocation from London. Overview According to the album sleeve notes the album and its title are inspired by Vangelis' method of composing and recording, relying on spontaneity, with the compositional and recording process occurring simultaneously in the studio. This process was largely facilitated by the use of full spectrum of sound in the mixing and mastering process, due to custom MIDI performance systems designed for Vangelis and the Zyklus MIDI Performance System, which was developed by technicians Bill Marshall and Pete Kellock. Release The CD tracks \\"Dial Out\\" and \\"Intergalactic Radio Station\\" were not on the LP. The LP has CD tracks 1-2-3-4-6 on side A, and CD tracks 7-8-10-11-9 on side B. In 2013 the album was released in remastered and reissued digipak edition by Esoteric Recordings. Instrumentation The album is almost completely instrumental, employing mainly synthesizers and drum machines. Operatic vocals on \\"Glorianna\\" are performed by the Greek mezzo-soprano Markella Hatziano (uncredited).

He is best known for his service in the 1780 military campaign of Charles Cornwallis during the American Revolutionary War in the Carolinas, in which he played a great effort in recruiting American Loyalists to serve in his militia against the Patriots. Ultimately, his activities and military actions led to a Patriot militia force mustered to put an end to his force of Loyalists, and he was killed in the Battle of Kings Mountain, at the border between the colonies of North Carolina and South Carolina. Leading a group of Loyalists whom he had recruited, he was the only regular army officer participating on either side of the conflict. The victorious Patriot forces desecrated his body in the aftermath of the battle. Early life Patrick Ferguson was born at Pitfour in Aberdeenshire, Scotland, on 25 May (Old Style)/4 June (New Style) 1744, the second son and fourth child of advocate James Ferguson of Pitfour (who was raised to the judges' bench as a Senator of the College of Justice, so known as Lord Pitfour after 1764) and his wife Anne Murray, a sister of the literary patron Patrick Murray, 5th Lord Elibank. Through his parents, he knew a number of major figures in the Scottish Enlightenment, including philosopher and historian David Hume, on whose recommendation he read Samuel Richardson's novel Clarissa when he was fifteen, and the dramatist John Home. He had numerous first cousins through his mother's family: these included Sir William Pulteney, 5th Baronet, Commodore George Johnstone, and Sir James Murray (later Murray-Pulteney). In 1770 Ferguson purchased the Castara estate in Tobago.Gilchrist (2003): p. 10 After Ferguson's death the estate was inherited by his younger brother George who had managed it since the early 1770s and developed it into a successful enterprise. Exports of rum, sugar and molasses were made back to the UK from it.Buchan (2008): p. 33 Seven Years' War Ferguson began his military career in his teens, encouraged by his maternal uncle James Murray. He served briefly in the Holy Roman Empire with the Scots Greys during the Seven Years' War, until a leg ailment ‚Äì probably tuberculosis in the knee ‚Äì forced him to return home. After recovering, now in peace-time, he served with his regiment on garrison duty. In 1768, he purchased a command of a company in 70th Regiment of Foot, under the Colonelcy of his cousin Alexander Johnstone, and served with them in the West Indies until his lame leg again began to trouble him. After returning home in 1772, he took part in light infantry training, coming to the attention of General Howe. During this time, he developed the Ferguson rifle, a breech-loading flintlock weapon based on Chaumette's earlier system. American War of Independence 1777 In 1777, Ferguson went to the colonies to serve in the American War of Independence; commanding an experimental rifle corps equipped with his new rifle. However, after initial success, he was shot through the right elbow joint at the Battle of Brandywine on 11 September 1777 in Pennsylvania. Shortly before, he had had the chance to shoot a prominent American officer, accompanied by another in distinctive hussar dress, but decided not to do so, as the man had his back to him (Ferguson) and was unaware of his presence. A surgeon told Ferguson in the hospital that some American casualties had said that General Washington had been in the area at the time. Ferguson wrote that, even if the officer were the general, he did not regret his decision. The officer's identity remains uncertain; historians suggest that the aide in hussar dress might indicate the senior officer was Count Casimir Pulaski. For some months after being wounded, Ferguson was at risk for amputation of his arm. During this time, he received news of his father's death. Ferguson eventually recovered, although his right arm was permanently crippled. 1778 Ferguson resumed his military duties in May 1778, under the command of Sir Henry Clinton. In October 1778, Ferguson was assigned to lead a raid in southern New Jersey to suppress privateers who had been seizing British ships. They were based around the Little Egg Harbor River, which empties into the Great Bay. Ferguson attacked their base in what is known as the Battle of Chestnut Neck. About a week later, Ferguson was notified by a Hessian defector, Lieutenant Carl Wilhelm Juliat, who had returned to the British side after a furious argument with the American Lieutenant Colonel Carl Von Bose, that a detachment of Count Pu≈Çaski's troops, under Von Bose's command, was located nearby. Ferguson marched his troops to the site of Bose's infantry outpost, which comprised fifty men and was a short distance from Pulaski's main encampment.Kajencki, AnnMarie Francis. Count Casimir Pulaski: From Poland to America, a Hero's Fight for Liberty. New York: PowerPlus Books, 2005. . p. 77An older book spells the defector's name as Juliet and identifies him as a Frenchman. The author says that about 50 men were killed by the attackers. Sears, Robert. The Shot Heard Round the World: From Lexington to Yorktown: A Pictorial History of the American Revolution. Boston: John Adams Lee Pub., 1889. . p. 284. At first light on 15 October 1778, Ferguson ordered his men to use bayonets to attack the sleeping men of the American force. Pulaski reported that Ferguson's Tories killed, wounded or took prisoner about 30 of his men in what the Americans called the Little Egg Harbor massacre.Kajencki, 2005. p. 78 Ferguson's own account (under the pen- name Egg-Shell) expresses his dismay at Pu≈Çaski's lack of preparations and failure to post look-outs. He said in his official report that little quarter could be given, and his men took only five prisoners.Irving, Washington. Life of Washington. Volume 3. New York : G.P. Putnam, 1860. . pp. 503-504\\\\. Irving gives 50 as the number of men killed by Ferguson and his force. Ferguson reported that he did not destroy the three houses which sheltered the Americans because they were the dwellings of inoffensive Quakers, who were innocent civilians.Draper, Lyman C., Anthony Allaire, Isaac Shelby. King's Mountain and Its Heroes: History of the Battle of King's Mountain. Cincinnati: Peter G. Thompson, Publisher, 1881. . p. 60. Pu≈Çaski eventually led his mounted troops (Pu≈Çaski's Legion) forward, causing Ferguson to retreat to his boats, minus a few men who had been captured. Ferguson reported his losses as two killed, three wounded, and one missing.Draper, 1881, p. 59. Draper gives the lieutenant colonel's name as \\"De Bosen.\\" He states that Pulaski captured \\"a few prisoners.\\" He also identifies \\"Juliet\\" as a Hessian and a \\"double deserter.\\" 1779 Ferguson was commissioned as a Major in the 71st Foot on 25 October 1779. 1780 In 1780, the British Army sent General Lord Cornwallis to invade South Carolina and North Carolina. His mission was to defeat all American forces in the Carolinas and keep the two colonies within the British Empire. A key part of Cornwallis's plan was to recruit soldiers from local Loyalists. To achieve this goal, General Clinton appointed Major Ferguson as Inspector of Militia in South Carolina. Ferguson's mission was to recruit Loyalist militia in the Carolinas and Georgia and to intimidate any colonists who favoured American independence. Major Patrick Ferguson was appointed Inspector of Militia on 22 May 1780. His task was to march to the old Tryon County area, raise and organize Loyalist units from the Tory population of the Carolina Backcountry, and protect the left flank of Lord Cornwallis' main body at Charlotte, North Carolina.Buchanan, 202Dameron, 22 After winning several victories over American forces, Cornwallis occupied Charlotte, North Carolina in the summer of 1780. He divided his army and gave command of one section to Ferguson. Ferguson's wing consisted of Loyalists he had recruited to fight for the British cause. =Battle of Musgrove's Mill= On the evening of 18 August 1780 two hundred mounted Patriot partisans under joint command of Colonels Isaac Shelby, James Williams, and Elijah Clarke prepared to raid a Loyalist camp at Musgrove's Mill, which controlled the local grain supply and guarded a ford of the Enoree River. The Battle of Musgrove Mill, 19 August 1780 occurred near a ford of the Enoree River, near the present-day border between Spartanburg, Laurens and Union Counties in South Carolina.Musgrove Mill State Historic Site website. The Patriots anticipated surprising a garrison of about an equal number of Loyalists, but a local farmer informed them that the Tories had recently been reinforced by about a hundred Loyalist militia and two hundred provincial regulars on their way to join British Major Patrick Ferguson.John Buchanan, The Road to Guilford Courthouse: The American Revolution in the Carolinas (New York: John Wiley & Sons, 1997), 177. \\"Provincial regulars\\" were Americans who enlisted in British army units, as opposed to British regulars and Tory militia. Edgar, 153. The whole battle took perhaps an hour and within that period, sixty-three Tories were killed, an unknown number wounded, and seventy were taken prisoner.Buchanan and Edgar give the losses as 63 killed, 90 wounded, 70 taken prisoner. Buchanan, 178; Edgar, 115. The figures in the text are those from a wayside at Musgrove Mill State Historic Site. The Patriots lost only about four dead and twelve wounded.Buchanan gives Patriot losses as four killed and seven wounded. Buchanan, 179. Some Whig leaders briefly considered attacking the Tory stronghold at Ninety Six, South Carolina; but they hurriedly dispersed after learning that a large Patriot army had been defeated at Camden three days previous. =Pursuit of Shelby= Shelby's forces covered sixty miles with Ferguson in hot pursuit before making good their escape.Edgar, 115, Buchanan, 179: \\"In forty-eight hours they had completed two forced marches, had neither slept nor rested, and had fought and won against a superior force an action renowned for its ferocity.\\" In the wake of General Horatio Gates‚Äô blundering defeat at Camden, the victory at Musgrove Mill heartened the Patriots and served as further evidence that the South Carolina backcountry could not be held by the Tories. Shelby and his Overmountain Men crossed back over the Appalachian Mountains and fled back into the territory of the Watauga Association at Sycamore Shoals in present day Elizabethton, Tennessee, and by the next month on 25 September 1780, Colonels Shelby, John Sevier, and Charles McDowell and their 600 Overmountain Men had combined forces with Col. William Campbell and his 400 Virginia men at the Sycamore Shoals muster in advance of the 7 October 1780 Battle of Kings Mountain near present day Blacksburg, South Carolina. On 2 September, Ferguson and the militia he had already recruited marched west in pursuit of Shelby toward the Appalachian Mountain hill country on what is now the Tennessee/North Carolina border.Buchanan, 204 By 10 September, Ferguson had established a base camp at Gilbert Town, North Carolina and issued a challenge to the Patriot leaders to lay down their arms or he would \\"lay waste to their country with fire and sword.\\"John Buchanan, The Road to Guilford Courthouse: The American Revolution in the Carolinas (New York: John Wiley & Sons, 1997), p. 208. \\"Provincial regulars\\" were Americans who enlisted in British army units, as opposed to British regulars and Tory militia. Edgar, 153. North Carolina Patriot militia leaders Isaac Shelby and John Sevier, from the Washington District (now northeast Tennessee), met and agreed to lead their militiamen against him.Buchanan, 210‚Äì211 =Battle of Kings Mountain= When Major Ferguson reportedly threatened to invade the mountains beyond the legal limit on westward settlement unless the colonists there abandoned the cause of American independence (Ferguson was actually in pursuit of Issac Shelby following the Battle of Musgrove's Mill), the Overmountain Men first mustered at Sycamore Shoals organised a militia to eventually fight Ferguson and his British Loyalists at King's Pinnacle, an isolated ridge on the border between the Carolinas. On 7 October 1780, the two armies clashed during the Battle of Kings Mountain. The battle went badly for the Loyalists positioned high on the mountain ridge, and during the fighting, Ferguson was shot from his horse. With his foot still in the stirrup, he was dragged to the rebel side. According to Rebel accounts, when a Patriot approached the major for his surrender, Ferguson drew his pistol and shot him as a last act of defiance. Other soldiers retaliated, and Ferguson's body was found with eight musket holes in it. Patriot accounts said their militia stripped his body of clothing and urinated on him before burial. They buried him in an oxhide near the site of his fall. One of Ferguson's mistresses, 'Virginia Sal', was also killed in the battle and was buried with the officer. In the 1920s, the U.S. government erected a marker at Ferguson's gravesite, which today is a part of the Kings Mountain National Military Park, administered by the National Park Service. Ferguson's personal correspondence reveals a man of intelligence, humour and charm. He also wrote several articles, satirical in tone, for publication in Rivington's Royal Gazette, under the pseudonyms Egg-Shell, Memento Mori and John Bull. He was survived by his mother, his brothers James and George, and sisters Annie, Elizabeth (Betty) (Mrs Scrymgeour-Wedderburn of Birkhill), and Jean. Popular culture In the novel Horse-Shoe Robinson (1835) by John Pendleton Kennedy, an historical romance set against the background of the Southern campaigns in the American War of Independence, fictional characters interact with Ferguson as he is en route to the climactic scene in which he is killed in the Battle of Kings Mountain. In Louis L'Amour's book The Ferguson Rifle (1973), Ferguson stops by a poor family home on his way to the Battle of King's Mountain and kindly gives his personal copy of the Ferguson rifle to a boy who later carries it West. Ferguson is shown to be a gentleman who displays all the appropriate social graces to a lady (the boy's ill mother) and compassion to a family in need by giving up his personal firearm, asking only that the boy keep it always, and never use it against the king. (p7) In Steve Ressel's novel State of One (2010), Ferguson is the main antagonist featured against James Pariah, a soldier formerly under Ferguson's command during the Battle of the Brandywine in 1777. Ferguson had been resurrected as a golem by the Leeds Witch with hopes of raising a golem army of similar soldiers, all armed with Ferguson rifles, to destroy the ratification of the US Constitution in September 1787. James Pariah cleaves to his old Ferguson rifle, sometimes referring to it as his wife, having modified it with special actions such as a spring-loaded knife in the stock. In Sharyn McCrumb's novel Kings Mountain: A Ballad Novel (2014), Ferguson is the central antagonist. Events leading to and the battle itself are covered from multiple viewpoints on both sides. In the 2014 episode \\"Patriots Rising\\" of the television program The American Revolution, Ferguson is portrayed as having George Washington in his gunsight, but choosing not to shoot. In the outdoor drama Horn in the West, Ferguson is portrayed harassing Daniel Boone's Patriot friends ultimately leading to the Battle of Kings Mountain whereby his final defiant moments are carried out by shooting a Patriot with his pistol.

It stars Hugh Grant, Julianne Moore, Tom Arnold, Joan Cusack, Jeff Goldblum, and Robin Williams. The film is a remake of the French film Neuf mois and served as Grant's first US starring role. It was filmed on location in the San Francisco Bay Area. The original music score was composed by Hans Zimmer. Plot Child psychologist Samuel Faulkner has an ideal romance with ballet teacher Rebecca Taylor. Rebecca is thinking about marriage and children. Samuel is against the idea of marriage as he is happy with how things are between them. This all changes when Rebecca declares she is pregnant, and when questioned by Samuel about her birth control she replies that birth control is only 97% effective. Samuel's fears mount due to his encounters with overbearing couple Marty and Gail Dwyer and their three young unruly daughters, as well as the confusing advice he gets from Sean, his perpetually single artist friend and Gail's brother. Samuel is confused and unsure about what to do. Feeling neglected, Rebecca leaves him and moves in with Marty and Gail. Samuel tries to contact her but she does not respond. When a girl makes a move on Samuel, he declines, saying he's not ready to move on yet. When he sees an ultrasound of his soon-to-be-born son, he decides that it is time to take responsibility before it is too late. He sells his Porsche 911, buys a family SUV, and gets back together with Rebecca. They then get married and have their baby boy together. Cast Reception On Rotten Tomatoes the film has an approval rating of 26% based on 27 reviews, with an average rating of 4.4/10. The site's consensus states: \\"Nine Months finds writer-director Chris Columbus playing to his worst comedic instincts -- and relying far too heavily on the trademark tics of his miscast leading man.\\" On Metacritic the film has a score of 47% based on reviews from 23 critics, indicating \\"mixed or average reviews\\". Audiences surveyed by CinemaScore gave the film a grade A- on scale of A to F. Roger Ebert gave the film two stars, saying, \\"Nine Months is one of those movies where the outcome is abundantly clear to everyone but the hero, who remains in the hapless position of playing dumb because, if he didn't, there wouldn't be a plot.\\" Todd McCarthy of Variety called it \\"An exceedingly safe and conventional Chris Columbus comedy.\\" Box office The movie debuted at #3 at the box office behind Apollo 13 and Under Siege 2: Dark Territory with $12.5 million in its opening weekend. Nine Months went on to gross $138.5 million worldwide. Hugh Grant's opinion Grant has spoken disparagingly of his performance in Nine Months, stating in an interview with the SAG-AFTRA Foundation that: \\"I really ruined it. And it was entirely my fault. I panicked, it was such a big jump up from what I'd been paid before to what they were offering me. And the scale was inhuman to my standards, you know the scale of the production, 20th Century Fox, the whole thing. And I just tried much too hard, and you know I forgot to do basic acting things, like mean it. So I pulled faces and overacted, it was a shocker.\\" On another occasion, he referred to director Chris Columbus as a \\"genius\\" and his \\"brilliant\\" co-stars, but further commented: \\"You know, having been paid ‚Ç§20,000 or whatever it was, to do Four Weddings and a Funeral, if you're suddenly paid millions, you think well I better ramp up my performance by 200 times. But all that means is that you overact grotesquely, which is what I did.

St Mary's Church, Harlow, Essex Henry Compton (1632 ‚Äì 7 July 1713) was the Bishop of London from 1675 to 1713. Early life Compton was born the sixth and youngest son of the 2nd Earl of Northampton. He was educated at The Queen's College, Oxford, but left in 1654 without a degree, and then travelled in Europe. After the restoration of Charles II in 1660 he became a cornet in his brother Charles's troop of the Royal Regiment of Horse, but soon quit the army for the church. After a further period of study at Cambridge and again at Oxford, he graduated as a D.D. in 1669. He held various livings, including rector of Cottenham, and Witney. Episcopal career He was made Bishop of Oxford in 1674, and in the following year was translated to the see of London, and also appointed Dean of the Chapel Royal. He was also appointed a member of the Privy Council, and entrusted with the education of the two princesses, Mary and Anne. He showed a liberality most unusual at the time to Protestant dissenters, whom he wished to reunite with the established church. He held several conferences on the subject with the clergy of his diocese; and in the hope of influencing candid minds by means of the opinions of unbiased foreigners, he obtained letters treating of the question (since printed at the end of Stillingfleet's Unreasonableness of Separation) from Le Moyne, professor of divinity at Leiden, and the famous French Protestant divine, Jean Claude. In 1676 he was instructed by Lord Danby to conduct an ecclesiastical census of the population, which became known as the Compton Census. In contrast to his liberality about Protestant dissent, Compton was strongly opposed to Roman Catholicism. On the accession of James II in February 1685 he consequently lost his seat in the council and his position as Dean of the Chapel Royal; and for his firmness in refusing to suspend John Sharp, rector of St Giles's-in-the-Fields, whose anti-papal preaching had rendered him obnoxious to the king, he was himself suspended by James's Court of High Commission in mid-1686. The suspension was lifted in September 1688, two days before the High Commission was abolished.Macaulay (1878), pp. 362‚Äì363. At the Glorious Revolution Compton embraced the cause of William III and Mary II, being one of the Immortal Seven who invited William to invade England; he performed the ceremony of their coronation; his old position was restored to him; and among other appointments, he was chosen as one of the commissioners for revising the liturgy. During the reign of Anne he remained a member of the privy council, and was one of the commissioners appointed to arrange the terms of the union of England and Scotland; but, to his bitter disappointment, his claims to the primacy were twice passed over. He died at Fulham on 7 July 1713, and was buried at All Saints Church, Fulham. Works Henry Compton circa 1675 Compton was a successful botanist. He also published, besides several theological works, A Translation from the Italian of the Life of Donna Olympia Maladichini, who governed the Church during the time of Pope Innocent X, which was from the year 1644 to 1655 (1667), and A Translation from the French of the Jesuits' Intrigues (1669).

The most famous version of the Great Commission is in Matthew 28:16‚Äì20, where on a mountain in Galilee Jesus calls on his followers to make disciples of and baptize all nations in the name of the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit. The Great Commission is similar to the episodes of the commissioning of the Twelve Apostles found in the other Synoptic Gospels, though with significant differences. Luke also has Jesus dispatching disciples during his ministry, sending them to all the nations and giving them power over demons, including the seventy disciples. The dispersion of the Apostles in the traditional ending of Mark is thought to be a 2nd-century summary based on Matthew and Luke. It has become a tenet in Christian theology emphasizing ministry, missionary work, evangelism, and baptism. The apostles are said to have dispersed from Jerusalem and founded the apostolic sees. Preterists believe that the Great Commission and other Bible prophecies were fulfilled in the 1st century while futurists believe Bible prophecy is yet to be fulfilled at the Second Coming. History It is not known who coined the term Great Commission, which was popularized by Hudson Taylor. New Testament accounts The most familiar version of the Great Commission is depicted in : According to Matthew 10, Jesus commanded his disciples to proclaim the arrival of the kingdom of God and to \\"heal the sick, raise the dead, cleanse lepers, and cast out demons...\\" Mark 6 and Luke 9 also record this instruction. The Great Commission is the commandment to proclaim good news - the kingdom has come and it has come with demonstration of power. Later, Paul prophesied that one of the signs of the last days would be that mention of the power of God would be silenced. He warned Timothy to not associate with those who have a form of godliness but do not speak of the power (). To the Corinthians, he said he did not come with eloquence or wisdom but with \\"demonstration of the power of the Spirit so that faith would rest not on human wisdom but on the power of God.\\" () Other versions of the Great Commission are found in , , , and . In Luke, Jesus tells the disciples to preach repentance and forgiveness, and promises that they will have divine power. In John, Jesus says the disciples will have the Holy Spirit and the authority to forgive sins and to withhold forgiveness.See John 20:21-23 (v21, v22, v23) In Acts, Jesus promises the disciples that the Holy Spirit will inspire them. All these passages are composed as words of Christ spoken after his resurrection. The call to go into the world in Matthew 28 is prefaced a mere four chapters earlier when Jesus states that the Gospel message will be heard by representatives of all nations, at which time the end will come. Interpretations The commission from Jesus has been interpreted by evangelical Christians as meaning that his followers have the duty to go, make disciples, teach, and baptize. Although the command was initially given directly only to Christ's eleven Apostles, evangelical Christian theology has typically interpreted the commission as a directive to all Christians of every time and place, particularly because it seems to be a restatement or moving forward of the last part of God's covenant with Abraham in . Commentators often contrast the Great Commission with the earlier Limited Commission of , in which they were to restrict their mission to their fellow Jews, who Jesus referred to as \\"the lost sheep of the house of Israel\\". () Full Preterists believe that the Great Commission was already fulfilled based on the New Testament passages \\"And they went out and preached everywhere\\" (), \\"the gospel that you have heard, which was proclaimed in all creation under heaven\\" (), and \\"Now to Him who is able to establish you according to my gospel and the preaching of Jesus Christ, according to the revelation of the mystery which has been kept secret for long ages past, but now is manifested, and by the scriptures of the prophets, according to the commandment of the eternal God, has been made known to all the nations\\" ().

The term is commonly used in relation to England and Wales, where comprehensive schools were introduced as state schools on an experimental basis in the 1940s and became more widespread from 1965. With the Blair educational reforms from 2003, they may be part of a local education authority or be a self governing academy or part of a multi-academy trust. About 90% of British secondary school pupils now attend comprehensive schools (as opposed to independent schools or the small number of grammar schools). They correspond broadly to the public school in the United States, Canada and Australia and to the Gesamtschule in Germany. Context Comprehensive schools provide an entitlement curriculum to all children, without selection whether due to financial considerations or attainment. A consequence of that is a wider ranging curriculum, including practical subjects such as design and technology and vocational learning, which were less common or non-existent in grammar schools. Providing post-16 education cost-effectively becomes more challenging for smaller comprehensive schools, because of the number of courses needed to cover a broader curriculum with comparatively fewer students. This is why schools have tended to get larger and also why many local authorities have organised secondary education into 11‚Äì16 schools, with the post-16 provision provided by sixth form colleges and further education colleges. Comprehensive schools do not select their intake on the basis of academic achievement or aptitude, but there are demographic reasons why the attainment profiles of different schools vary considerably. In addition, government initiatives such as the City Technology Colleges and Specialist schools programmes have made the comprehensive ideal less certain. In these schools children could be selected on the basis of curriculum aptitude related to the school's specialism even though the schools do take quotas from each quartile of the attainment range to ensure they were not selective by attainment. A problem with this is whether the quotas should be taken from a normal distribution or from the specific distribution of attainment in the immediate catchment area. In the selective school system, which survives in several parts of the United Kingdom, admission is dependent on selection criteria, most commonly a cognitive test or tests. Although comprehensive schools were introduced to England and Wales in 1965, there are 164 selective grammar schools that are still in operation. (though this is a small number compared to approximately 3500 state secondary schools in England). Most comprehensives are secondary schools for children between the ages of 11 to 16, but in a few areas there are comprehensive middle schools, and in some places the secondary level is divided into two, for students aged 11 to 14 and those aged 14 to 18, roughly corresponding to the US middle school (or junior high school) and high school, respectively. With the advent of key stages in the National Curriculum some local authorities reverted from the Middle School system to 11‚Äì16 and 11‚Äì18 schools so that the transition between schools corresponds to the end of one key stage and the start of another. In principle, comprehensive schools were conceived as \\"neighbourhood\\" schools for all students in a specified catchment area. History England and Wales The first comprehensives were set up after the Second World War. In 1946, for example, Walworth School was one of five 'experimental' comprehensive schools set up by the London County CouncilPeter Medway and Pat Kingwell, \\"A Curriculum in its place: English teaching in one school 1946‚Äì1963\\", History of Education 39, no. 6 (November 2010): 749‚Äì765. Another early comprehensive school was Holyhead County School in Anglesey in 1949.Comps - here to stay?, Phil Tinline, September 2005, BBC, accessed 12 August 2008. Coventry opened two Comprehensive Schools in 1954 by combining Grammar Schools and Secondary Modern Schools. These were Caludon Castle and Woodlands. Another early example was Tividale Comprehensive School in Tipton. The first, purpose-built comprehensive in the North of England was Colne Valley High School near Huddersfield in 1956. The largest expansion of comprehensive schools resulted from a policy decision taken in 1965 by Anthony Crosland, Secretary of State for Education in the 1964‚Äì1970 Labour government. The policy decision was implemented by Circular 10/65, a request to local education authorities to plan for conversion. Students sat the 11+ examination in their last year of primary education and were sent to one of a secondary modern, secondary technical or grammar school depending on their perceived ability. Secondary technical schools were never widely implemented and for 20 years there was a virtual bipartite system which saw fierce competition for the available grammar school places, which varied between 15% and 25% of total secondary places, depending on location. In 1970 Margaret Thatcher, the Secretary of State for Education in the new Conservative government, ended the compulsion on local authorities to convert, however, many local authorities were so far down the path that it would have been prohibitively expensive to attempt to reverse the process, and more comprehensive schools were established under Thatcher than any other education secretary. By 1975 the majority of local authorities in England and Wales had abandoned the 11-Plus examination and moved to a comprehensive system. Over that 10-year period many secondary modern schools and grammar schools were amalgamated to form large neighbourhood comprehensives, whilst a number of new schools were built to accommodate a growing school population. By the mid-1970s the system had been almost fully implemented, with virtually no secondary modern schools remaining. Many grammar schools were either closed or changed to comprehensive status. Some local authorities, including Sandwell and Dudley in the West Midlands, changed all of its state secondary schools to comprehensive schools during the 1970s. In 1976 the future Labour prime minister James Callaghan launched what became known as the 'great debate' on the education system. He went on to list the areas he felt needed closest scrutiny: the case for a core curriculum, the validity and use of informal teaching methods, the role of school inspection and the future of the examination system. Comprehensive school remains the most common type of state secondary school in England, and the only type in Wales. They account for around 90% of pupils, or 64% if one does not count schools with low-level selection. This figure varies by region. Since the 1988 Education Reform Act, parents have a right to choose which school their child should go to or whether to not send them to school at all and to home educate them instead. The concept of \\"school choice\\" introduces the idea of competition between state schools, a fundamental change to the original \\"neighbourhood comprehensive\\" model, and is partly intended as a means by which schools that are perceived to be inferior are forced either to improve or, if hardly anyone wants to go there, to close down. Government policy is currently promoting 'specialisation' whereby parents choose a secondary school appropriate for their child's interests and skills. Most initiatives focus on parental choice and information, implementing a pseudo- market incentive to encourage better schools. This logic has underpinned the controversial league tables of school performance. Scotland Scotland has a very different educational system from England and Wales, though also based on comprehensive education. It has different ages of transfer, different examinations and a different philosophy of choice and provision. All publicly funded primary and secondary schools are comprehensive. The Scottish Government has rejected plans for specialist schools as of 2005. Northern Ireland Education in Northern Ireland differs slightly from systems used elsewhere in the United Kingdom, but it is more similar to that used in England and Wales than it is to Scotland.  Australia  When the first comprehensive schools appeared in the 1950s, the Australian Government started to transition to comprehensive schooling which has been expanding and improving ever since. Prior to the transition into comprehensive schooling systems, primary and secondary state schools regularly measured students' academic merit based on their performance in public examinations. The state of Western Australia was the first to replace many multilateral school systems, proceeding with Queensland, and finally South Australia and Victoria. The Australian education system is organised through three compulsory school types. Students commence their education in Primary school, which runs for seven or eight years, starting at kindergarten through to Year 6 or 7. The next is Secondary school which runs for three or four years, from Year 7 or 8 to Year 10. Finally, Senior Secondary school which runs for two years, completing Years 11 and 12. Each school tier follows a comprehensive curriculum that is categorised into sequences for each Year-level. The Year- level follows specific sequence content and achievement for each subject, which can be interrelated through cross-curricula. In order for students to complete and graduate each tier-level of schooling, they need to complete the subject sequences of content and achievement. Once students have completed Year 12, they may choose to enter into Tertiary education. The two-tier Tertiary education system in Australia includes both higher education (i.e.: University, College, other Institutions) and vocational education and training (VET). Higher education works off of the Australian Qualifications Framework and prepares Australians for an academic route that may take them into the theoretical and philosophical lenses of their career options.

The Constitution of India grants plenary power to the President of India to nominate, and with the advice and consent of the Parliament of India, appoint a chief justice, who serves until they reach the age of sixty five, resign, retire, are impeached and convicted, or die. As head of the supreme court, the chief justice is responsible for the allocation of cases and appointment of constitutional benches which deal with important matters of law. In accordance with Article 145 of the Constitution of India and the Supreme Court Rules of Procedure of 1966, the chief justice allocates all work to the other judges who are bound to refer the matter back to him or her (for re-allocation) in any case where they require it to be looked into by a larger bench of more judges. On the administrative side, the chief justice carries out the following functions: maintenance of the roster; appointment of court officials and general and miscellaneous matters relating to the supervision and functioning of the Supreme Court. However this convention has been broken twice. In 1973, Justice A. N. Ray was appointed superseding 3 senior judges. Also, in 1977 Justice Mirza Hameedullah Beg was appointed as the CJI superseding Justice Hans Raj Khanna. The present CJI is Justice Sharad Arvind Bobde, and is the 47th CJI since 26 January 1950, the year the Constitution came into effect and the supreme court came into being. He succeeded Justice Ranjan Gogoi on 18 November 2019, and will remain in office till 23 April 2021, the day he retires on turning 65 years of age.for 18 months. Appointment Chief justice of India is appointed by the President on the basis of nomination by other judges of supreme court Removal Article 124(4) of Constitution of India lays down the procedure for removal of a judge of Supreme Court which is applicable to chief justices as well. Once appointed, the chief justice remains in the office until the age of 65 years. He can be removed only through a process of removal by Parliament as follows: Acting President The president (Discharge of Functions) Act, 1969 of India provides that the chief justice of India (CJI) shall act as the president of India in the event of the offices of both the president and the vice president being vacant. When President Zakir Hussain died in office, Vice President V. V. Giri, acted as the president. Later, Mr. Giri resigned as the vice president. The CJI, Justice Mohammad Hidayatullah then became the acting president of India. As per the convention, the senior-most judge of the Supreme Court became the acting CJI. When the newly elected president took office a month later, Justice Hidayatullah reverted as the chief justice of India. List of chief justices of India Remuneration The Constitution of India gives the power of deciding remuneration as well as other conditions of service of the chief justice to the Parliament of India. Accordingly, such provisions have been laid down in The Supreme Court Judges (Salaries and Conditions of Service) Act, 1958. This remuneration was revised in 2006‚Äì2008, after the sixth central pay commission's recommendation.  2018 crisis  In 2018, in an unprecedented act, four supreme court justices spoke out against the CJI Dipak Misra. Prior to Misra, no CJI had ever been indicted for fraud. Since then, the post of the CJI and the Supreme Court in general has come under increased scrutiny. Though the CJI's powers and duties have been considered equivalent to the other justices of the Supreme Court, under Misra, the court established the CJI as the \\"Master of Roster\\" and pronounced that the CJI ‚Äúalone has the prerogative to constitute the benches of the court and allocate cases to the benches so constituted‚Äù even if the case involved accusations against the CJI him/herself, thus creating the provision to violate the in causa sua principle of natural justice.

He was defeated for re-election in 2010 by State Representative Steven Palazzo. He currently serves on the Hancock County Port and Harbor Commission. Taylor was a member of the Democratic Party until becoming a Republican in 2014. Early life, education and career Taylor was born in New Orleans and is a 1975 graduate of Tulane University where he majored in political science and history. He completed additional post-graduate work in business and economics at the University of Southern Mississippi from 1978 through 1980. Taylor worked as a sales representative for Stone Container Corporation, working a territory from New Orleans to the Florida panhandle, from 1977 through 1989. From 1971 through 1984, Taylor served in the United States Coast Guard Reserve, where he attained the rank petty officer first class. While in the coast guard, he commanded a search and rescue boat and earned several commendations. Early political career Taylor was elected to the Bay St. Louis City Council in 1981, and then to a vacant seat in the Mississippi State Senate in 1983. As a State Senator, Taylor and fellow Senator Steven Hale filed a lawsuit challenging the Senate powers of Democratic Lieutenant Governor Brad Dye. Taylor and Hale claimed that Dye's control of committee appointments violated the state constitution's separation of powers. The Supreme Court of Mississippi sided with Dye, but the suit against a powerful leader from his own party helped establish Taylor's reputation for political independence. U.S. House of Representatives Tenure Taylor was a member of the Blue Dog Coalition, and his voting record was one of the most conservative among Democrats in the House. He has become a leading Democratic Member of the House Armed Services Committee. He led committee and floor fights to improve the medical benefits of military retirees, and to extend TRICARE health insurance to members of the National Guard and Reserves. Taylor also has focused on U.S. policy in Latin America, sponsoring the successful cap on the number of U.S. troops that can be sent to Colombia without explicit Congressional authorization. Taylor also was a leading critic of the Base Realignment and Closure process, accusing the Department of Defense of smuggling in policy changes that were unrelated to excess capacity or facilities. Taylor served as the Ranking Democrat on the Projection Forces Subcommittee in the 109th Congress, and became chairman of the renamed Subcommittee on Seapower and Expeditionary Forces in the 110th Congress. He and the previous subcommittee chairman Roscoe Bartlett (R-MD), who is now the ranking member of the subcommittee, advocate for more nuclear-powered surface ships in order to reduce the Navy's dependence on imported oil. Taylor is also a member of the Readiness subcommittee of the Armed Services committee in the 110th Congress. Taylor has been a staunch advocate of maintaining the \\"Buy American\\" requirements in Defense contracting, and of maintaining the Jones Act requirements that vessels operating between U.S. ports must be American- flagged, American-made, owned by U.S. citizens, and crewed by U.S. citizens. In February 2007, he was one of two Democrats to oppose H CON RES 63, which expressed opposition to a troop surge in the Iraq War. Taylor was one of the most conservative Democrats in the House. He represented a district that had turned almost solidly Republican at the national level, though as late as 2010 most local offices were split between the two parties. The 4th has not supported the official Democratic presidential candidate since 1956 (when the Democrats nominated Adlai Stevenson). During Taylor's final term, it was the most Republican district in the nation to be represented by a Democrat, with a Cook Partisan Voting Index of R+20. In 2000, 2004, and 2008, it gave the Republican presidential candidate his best total in the state. It was a foregone conclusion that Taylor would be succeeded by a Republican once he retired. He voted for all four articles of impeachment against Bill Clinton in 1998‚Äîthe only Democrat in Congress to do so. He was one of just five Democrats to support at least one article of impeachment.Clinton impeached, faces trial in Senate. Baltimore Sun. 1998-12-20. He refused to endorse Clinton's reelection bid in 1996, but refused to switch parties despite numerous overtures from the Republicans. In the 2004 Democratic primaries, Taylor endorsed Wesley Clark. He voted for John McCain in 2008. The Christian Coalition gave Taylor an overall rating of 76% and he has endorsed the Federal Marriage Amendment. Taylor was a strong critic of the Bush Administration's fiscal policy. He voted against the tax cuts passed in 2001 and 2003, claiming that the cuts contained in those bills would only increase the national debt. He derided the prescription drug plan passed in 2003 as a giveaway to companies that donate to the Republican Party. He is one of the House's most vehement opponents of free trade agreements and was strongly opposed to the Bush administration's proposals for reforming Social Security. He has also voted at times with more liberal members of the House with regards to Cuba. Since coming to the House, he has voted in favor of most campaign finance laws and other laws favored by more progressive elements of the Democratic Party to reform politics. Taylor was a staunch and consistent opponent of most free trade agreements. He voted against NAFTA and GATT. He voted against fast-track authority in 1998 and 2002. He also opposed Permanent Normal Trade Relations (PNTR) with China in 2000. Taylor has a mixed voting record on environmental issues; he has voted repeatedly against the ban on drilling in Alaska National Wildlife Refuge (ANWR), while voting at other times with the mainstream of his party. He has also denounced Vice President Dick Cheney's ties to Halliburton. In 2006, Taylor was the only Democrat to support all four amendments to the bill to renew the Voting Rights Act. However, Taylor did vote in favor of final passage of the unamended bill, as did all House Democrats. In House Armed Services Committee hearings, Taylor was sharply critical of Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld and other administration witnesses, particularly regarding shortages of armor for troops and vehicles in Iraq. He decried the lack of urgency to speed up production and procurement of armored vehicles and of jammers to block the signals of improvised explosive devices (IEDs). According to a 2011 survey by the National Journal, Taylor was the most conservative Democrat in the House. Much of Taylor's district took a direct hit from Hurricane Katrina, which destroyed his home in Bay St. Louis (27 miles west of Biloxi) as well as Lott's home in Pascagoula. He moved to Kiln while he rebuilt his home in Bay St. Louis. When former Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) director Michael D. Brown appeared before the committee, Taylor reacted angrily to Brown's attempts to put primary responsibility for the failed response at the state and local level. Taylor seemed particularly upset that several first responders in Hancock County, his home county, were forced to loot a Wal-Mart to get food and supplies. They also had to wait several days after the storm before they got any help from FEMA workers. He told Brown that FEMA \\"fell on (its) face\\" in its response to Katrina, which he said rated \\"an F-minus in my book.\\" In April 2009, Taylor voted against the Matthew Shepard and James Byrd, Jr. Hate Crimes Prevention Act.

He lost to Harrison County Sheriff Larkin I. Smith by almost 10 points. The Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee offered very little help to Taylor, believing the district to be too heavily Republican. Vice President George H. W. Bush defeated Michael Dukakis by approximately a 70 to 30 margin in the district, and Lott beat Wayne Dowdy by a similar margin in the Senate race. Although about 30,000 Bush and Lott voters split their tickets to vote for Taylor, he could not overcome the Republican tide in the district. 1989 Smith died in a plane crash eight months later. In the special election to fill Smith's seat, Taylor picked up 42 percent of the vote to lead Republican Thomas H. Anderson, Jr. and Democrat Mike Moore in the first round. Some leading Democrats had tried to convince Taylor to stand aside and not seek the position in deference to Moore, who was the state's Attorney General and who was also a Gulf Coast resident, but Taylor doubled Moore's vote total on the first ballot. Two weeks later, Taylor beat Anderson, Lott's Chief of Staff, with 65 percent of the vote. Taylor took office on October 24, 1989. 1990 through 2008 Taylor won a full term in 1990 with 81 percent of the vote against realtor Sheila Smith, the widow of his predecessor in the House. He easily turned back spirited reelection challenges in 1992, 1994 and 1996, taking over 60 percent of the vote each time. However, he was reelected in 1998 with 77 percent of the vote and was reelected five more times after that by an average of 70 percent of the vote. His district was renumbered the 4th after the 2000 redistricting cost Mississippi a congressional seat. 2010 Taylor was defeated by Republican state representative Steven Palazzo on November 2, 2010. His vote against Barack Obama for president in 2008 became a campaign issue when Taylor released campaign ads pointing to his support of McCain as evidence of his bipartisanship. However, Palazzo attacked Taylor for supporting Pelosi as Speaker and claimed Taylor voted with his party's leadership 82 percent of the time. Taylor was endorsed by the National Right to Life Committee. In the following lame duck session of Congress, Taylor dropped his opposition to the Navy's plan to buy both classes of Littoral combat ship, even though this greatly reduced the chances that a shipyard in his former district would then be able to bid for follow on contracts.Murtaugh, Dan. \\"Navy's LCS dual-buy plan clears hurdle.\\" Press-Register, 4 December 2010 2014 Taylor opposed Palazzo in the Republican primary in the June 2014 election. Taylor was seeking to become the first Mississippi U.S. Representative since 1884 to return to the House of Representatives after losing a seat at the ballot box. He believed that his district had become too Republican for him to challenge Palazzo as a Democrat. Indeed, since Taylor left office, no Democrat running in the district has cleared the 40 percent mark, and only one has even cleared 30 percent. Taylor, who was out-raised by Palazzo by almost 6-to-1 and out- spent by over 10-to 1, ran a grassroots campaign, emphasizing his work to secure funding for the district in the wake of Hurricane Katrina and his efforts to support veterans and funding for military bases in the district. He has contrasted this with Palazzo's vote against funding for Hurricane Sandy relief efforts and supporting sequestration which cut the defense budget. Despite actively campaigning to and drawing large numbers of Democrats into the Republican Primary, Taylor lost a close race to Palazzo, 50.5-43% Post- congressional career Taylor was appointed to the Hancock County Port and Harbor Commission by District 3 Supervisor Lisa Cowand in March 2012. Personal life Taylor and his wife Margaret have three children. He holds a black belt in Taekwondo.

His campaign theme was \\"God, Family, Republic\\" and he emphasized the Bible, the traditional family, and the need for constitutionally limited government. His running mate was independent Baptist minister Chuck Baldwin. He gained support from many paleoconservatives, and was also endorsed by the America First Party and Alaskan Independence Party. Peroutka was also endorsed by the League of the South and supported by a group called \\"Southerners for Peroutka\\". Peroutka accepted the endorsement from the League at their 2004 national convention. Radio host Alex Jones stated he would be voting for Peroutka. He appeared on the radio show, The Political Cesspool to promote his campaign, describing it as a \\"Christian/Constitutionalist radio program\\" and \\"a great blessing to our cause\\".

In 2012, the Montgomery Advertiser reported that he was the single-biggest donor to Roy Moore's 2012 campaign for the Alabama Supreme Court, having contributed $50,000 of the total $78,000 received by Moore until December 31, 2011. On December 6, 2012, the Human Rights Campaign called Peroutka an \\"active white supremacist and secessionist sympathizer\\" due to links to the League of the South. Peroutka told The Baltimore Sun that he \\"continues to be a proud member of the League of the South,\\" since it \\"has a belief that the central government is too large, too spend-thrift and too out- of-control,\\" but he called HRC's characterization of him as a white- supremacist sympathizer \\"absurd\\" and \\"not at all true.\\" In 2012, a video of Peroutka showed asking a group to stand for the national anthem, then leading them in Dixie.

However, when the medreses were no longer able to meet the needs of the modern world, a restructuring process began, and as a result, the institutions of higher education called Dar√ºlf√ºn√ªn, the core of Istanbul University, was established. An institution of higher education named the Dar√ºlf√ºn√ªn-u Osman√Æ (ÿØÿßÿ± ÿßŸÑŸÅŸÜŸàŸÜ ÿπÿ´ŸÖÿßŸÜŸä) (Ottoman House of Sciences) was created in 1863, but suppressed in 1871.

In 1874 the Imperial University (Dar√ºlf√ºn√ªn-u Sultan√Æ) (ÿØÿßÿ± ÿßŸÑŸÅŸÜŸàŸÜ ÿ≥ŸÑÿ∑ÿßŸÜŸä) started classes in law in French, but was closed in 1881. The Imperial University, now known as Dar√ºlf√ºn√ªn-u ≈ûah√¢ne (ÿØÿßÿ± ÿßŸÑŸÅŸÜŸàŸÜ ÿ¥ŸáÿßŸÜŸá) was refounded in 1900, with the departments of theology, arts, mathematics, science and philology. In 1924, the faculties of law, medicine, arts and sciences were established in Istanbul University (ƒ∞stanbul Dar√ºlf√ºn√ªnu), as the university was now called. Islamic theology was added in 1925, but in 1933 the university was reorganized without the latter.

Starting from 1874, some classes of Literature, Law and Applied Sciences were given at the building of Galatasaray High School, which continued regularly until 1881. On 1 September 1900, the school was renamed and reorganized as the Dar√ºlf√ºn√ªn-u ≈ûah√¢ne (Imperial House of Multiple Sciences) with courses on Mathematics, Literature and Theology. On 20 April 1912, the school was renamed as the ƒ∞stanbul Dar√ºlf√ºn√ªnu (Istanbul House of Multiple Sciences) while the number of courses were increased and the curricula were modernized with the establishment of the Schools of Medicine, Law, Applied Sciences (Physics, Chemistry, Mathematics), Literature and Theology. On 21 April 1924, the Republic of Turkey recognized the ƒ∞stanbul Dar√ºlf√ºn√ªnu as a state school, and on 7 October 1925, the administrative autonomy of ƒ∞stanbul Dar√ºlf√ºn√ªnu was recognized while the Schools (within the old Medrese system) became modern Faculties. On 1 August 1933, ƒ∞stanbul Dar√ºlf√ºn√ªnu was reorganized as ƒ∞stanbul √úniversitesi (Istanbul University) following the educational reforms of Mustafa Kemal Atat√ºrk. Classes officially began on 1 November 1933. Campus Late Roman and early Byzantine remains at the Istanbul University campus next to Beyazƒ±t Tower. Interior of the main buildingThe university has seventeen faculties on five campuses; the main campus being on Beyazƒ±t Square, which was originally built by Constantine the Great as the Forum Tauri and was later enlarged by Theodosius the Great as the Forum of Theodosius during the Roman period. The main campus building with its landmark gate was previously used as the headquarters of the Harbiye Nezareti (Ministry of War) by the Ottoman government. Located on the grounds is the Beyazƒ±t Tower, an tall fire-watch tower. The grounds were previously the location of the Ottoman era Eski Saray (Old Palace). Some Roman and Byzantine ruins are still visible on the grounds. The university has a teaching staff of 2,000 professors and associates and 4,000 assistants and younger staff. More than 60,000 undergraduate and 8,000 postgraduate students follow the courses offered by Istanbul University every year.

Humana had over 20 million members in the U.S., reported a 2019 revenue of US$ 56.9 billion, and had 46,000 employees. In 2020, the company ranked 52 on the Fortune 500 list, which made it the highest ranked (by revenues) company based in Kentucky. It has been the third largest health insurance in the nation. The U.S. Dept. of Health and Human Services investigated Humana in 2009 for sending flyers to Medicare recipients that the AARP characterized as deceptive. The company's managed care model has also been criticized for ethical lapses and limitations. The health insurer Aetna said on July 3, 2015, that it had agreed to acquire its smaller rival Humana for $37 billion in cash and stock but walked away from the deal after a court ruling that the merger would be anti-competitive. History 1961‚Äì1983: Nursing homes and hospitals Lawyers David A. Jones Sr. and Wendell Cherry founded a nursing home company in 1961. The company, known in 1968 as Extendicare Inc., became the largest nursing home company in the United States. In 1972, Jones and Cherry sold the nursing home chain, to purchase hospitals. In 1974, the partners changed the corporate name to Humana Inc. The name was meant to change public perception from 'warehousing' or indifferently treating people to providing a higher-level of human care and, by extension, more humane care. It grew in the following years, both by business and in 1978 through the takeover of American Medicorp Inc., which doubled the company's size, and growing into the world's largest hospital company in the 1980s. During this period, Humana developed the double corridor model for hospital construction. This design minimized the distance between patients and nurses by placing nursing support services in the interior of the building with patient rooms surrounding the perimeter. 1984‚Äìpresent As the American health care system changed in the 1980s, \\"one of its hospitals in Arizona lost a contract with the largest health-maintenance organization in the area [and] Humana created its own health insurance plan.\\" In 1993, Humana had become the largest hospital operator in the country, owning 77 hospitals. Humana executives spun off hospital operations from health insurance operations to create Galen Health Care. The following year they sold the 73 hospitals of Galen Health Care Inc. to Nashville-based Columbia Hospital Corporation of America for $3.4 billion. In 1998, one year after Jones had stepped aside as CEO, United Healthcare made an unsuccessful attempt to acquire Humana. Humana pulled out of the acquisition after United stock dropped $2.9 billion in value. In 2001, Humana was a cofounder of Availity. In 2005, Humana entered into a business partnership with Virgin Group, offering financial incentives to members for healthy behavior, such as regular exercise. On November 16, 2006, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and Humana Inc. partnered to expand on traditional private-sector approaches to population health management. In 2006, Humana launched an education campaign to market Medicare Advantage (MA) and Prescription Drug Plans (PDP) nationwide to Medicare-eligible consumers, following the passage of the Medicare modernization act. The same year, Humana launched RightSource, a national mail-order retail pharmacy business. In March 2008, Fortune Magazine named Humana one of the Top 5 Most Admired Healthcare Companies in the United States. In 2010, Humana bought Texas-based Concentra Inc., which owns urgent- care and physical therapy centers, for $790 million, effectively returning to healthcare services. In May 2011, Humana announced it would be using mobileStorm to transmit protected health information to patients.mobileStorm Launches First HIPAA-Compliant, Cloud-based mHealth Communication Platform; Announces Humana as a Beta Client. Smart Phone Health Care. May 27, 2011. In March 2015, Humana announced the sale of Concentra to private equity firm Welsh, Carson, Anderson & Stowe and Select Medical Holdings Corporation for about $1 billion, with proceeds to fund a \\"$2 billion share buyback program and other corporate spending.\\" In July 2015, Aetna announced that it would acquire Humana for $37 billion in cash and stock (approximately $230 a share at that time). Aetna and Humana shareholders would own 74% and 26% of the new combined company, however the merger was blocked by a federal judge in January 2017. In February 2017, Aetna Inc. and Humana Inc. quashed a $34 billion merger agreement after judges ruled against the merger for a second time. In July 2018, Humana joined two private equity firms in the acquisition of Kindred Healthcare. The deal provided Humana with a 40% stake in the company's home health, hospice and community care businesses, called \\"Kindred at Home,\\" for approximately $800 million. In August 2018, Humana announced the creation of a digital health and analytics division called Humana Studio H. In December 2019, the company announced it would acquire Enclara Healthcare from Consonance Capital Partners and Enclara management. Corporate affairs Sponsorship LPGA player Nancy Scranton is a spokesperson for Humana. In the past, PGA Tour player David Toms' David Toms Foundation has partnered with the Humana Foundation to provide grants to several children's charities in New Orleans. Humana is the official health benefits provider of the PGA Tour and Champions Tour. The Humana Distaff Handicap is a Grade 1 race for thoroughbred fillies and mares, four-years-old and up. The race is run each spring on Kentucky Derby day at Churchill Downs and set at a distance of 7 furlongs for a purse of $250,000. Humana is the presenting sponsor of the Grand Ole Opry. Since 1979, Humana has been a principal sponsor of the annual Humana Festival of New American Plays in Louisville, Kentucky. Humana Military Healthcare Services In 1993, Humana founded Humana Military Healthcare Services (HMHS) as a wholly owned subsidiary. They were awarded their first TRICARE contract in 1995, and began their military beneficiaries in 1996. From 2004 to 2009, HMHS was the managed care contractor for the Department of Defense Military Health System TRICARE South Region. In 2009, HMHS' Managed Care Support Contract was awarded to United Military and Veterans Services, a subsidiary of UnitedHealth Group. HMHS protested that decision and the Government Accountability Office upheld the protest in late 2009. In 2011, HMHS regained the five-year contract to administer medical benefits to military members and families in the South region, a contract worth $23.5 billion. In 2018, this was moved to the new TRICARE East region during the TRICARE regional realignment. Controversy In 1987, Humana sued NBC over a story line in the television medical drama St. Elsewhere in which the hospital was to be sold to a for-profit medical corporation and renamed \\"Ecumena\\", with subsequent changes to the hospital, both positive and negative, emanating from that change. Humana was successful at forcing NBC into showing a disclaimer at the beginning of the September 30 episode saying that the drama had no connection whatsoever with Humana. On May 30, 1996, Linda Peeno, a physician who was contracted to work for Humana for nine months, testified before Congress as to the downside of managed care. Peeno said she was effectively rewarded by her employer for causing the death of a patient, because it saved the company a half-million dollars. Peeno stated that she felt the \\"managed care\\" model was inherently unethical. In 1999, season one of Michael Moore's TV series The Awful Truth reported on Humana refusing to pay for a diabetic patient with pancreatic failure needing a transplant. The man's policy stated it covered all of his diabetes-related expenses, but another section of the policy stated that it did not cover organ transplants. Moore conducted a fake funeral on the front steps of the Humana building, and three days later Humana changed its policy and authorized the man's treatment.. Michael Moore's 2007 documentary Sicko used the video of Linda Peeno's testimony. On June 28, 2007, Humana declared that Peeno was never a Humana \\"associate\\" (permanent, full-time employee), but rather a \\"part-time contractor.\\" Humana disputed portions of her Congressional testimony by saying that because the patient's healthcare plan did not cover heart transplants, denial of coverage was valid. On September 21, 2009 the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services opened an investigation into Humana mass mailings to elderly Medicare recipients.Medicare Probes Humana's Letter To Patients About Effects Of Health Reform Medical News Today, September 23, 2009 The mail was made to appear to contain official information about Medicare Advantage and prescription drug benefit information, but instead alleged that core Medicare benefits could be cut by the Obama administration's healthcare reform,Dawn Teo Humana Mailer Targets Elderly, Claims Medicare Benefits To Be Cut Huffington Post.

The house was built in 1897 to celebrate Ka ªiulani's return from Europe.  ªƒÄinahau was the royal estate of Princess Victoria Ka ªiulani, heir to the throne of the Kingdom of Hawai ªi.  History   ªƒÄinahau was located at the  ªili (traditional subdivision) of  ªAu ªaukai, the ahupua ªa of Waikiki, on the island of Oahu. At the time, the site was four miles outside of the city of Honolulu. In 1872 the Scottish Archibald Scott Cleghorn purchased 6 acres at  ªAu ªaukai from two Hawaiians named Ma ªaua and Koihala. Cleghorn's wife became Princess Likelike upon her brother's ascension as King KalƒÅkaua in 1874. After the 1875 birth of their daughter Ka ªiulani, her godmother Princess Ruth Ke ªelik≈çlani gifted her 3.9 acres and later an additional 1.3 acres at a later date. These lands were inherited from Princess Ruth's father Kek≈´anƒÅo ªa. Princess Likelike named the estate  ªƒÄinahau (cool place) after the cool winds blowing down from the Manoa Valley and composed a song about her new home. Hawaiian linguist Mary Kawena Pukui claimed that the name means ‚Äúhau tree land‚Äù or ‚Äúland of the hau tree‚Äù, after the hau trees (Hibiscus tiliaceus) growing along the  ªƒÄpuakƒìhau Stream which gave shade to the estate. The confusion is due to the fact that hau means both cool and the hibiscus tree in Hawaiian.  ªƒÄinahau was initially a country estate while family lived in a mansion on Emma Street in downtown Honolulu, where Ka ªiulani was born. Her father sold the Emma Street residence to Scots-Irish industrialist James Campbell in 1878 and relocated the family to the country estate. Cleghorn built a two-story home on the estate. It was furnished with two grand pianos, elaborate brocade chairs, gold and glass cabinets and fixtures. Also, there were various art collections displayed on the walls and rooms. From  ªƒÄinahau, the Cleghorn family would entertain Hawai ªi's prestigious social circles. Cleghorn collected flowers and trees from all over the world, planted in various gardens on the estate. These included date palms, Washington palms, mango and teak trees, Monterey cypress, cinnamon and croton trees, and other types of trees. He also planted fourteen types of hibiscus, Princess Likelike's favorite gardenia flowers and Ka ªiulani's signature flower, the pikake or Jasmine flowers. A large banyan tree in front of the main house became known as the Ka ªiulani's banyan, which was the progenitor of all later banyan trees in Honolulu. A stable was built for several horses, including quarters for Ka ªiulani's prized pony named Fairy.  ªƒÄinahau was made famous in later years for its many peacocks that roamed freely on its grounds. Ka ªiulani would be called the \\"Princess of Peacocks\\" in legend. Ka ªiulani became mistress of  ªƒÄinahau at the age of 12, upon the death of her mother Princess Likelike. As mistress of  ªƒÄinahau, she grew fond of the company of the Scottish poet and author Robert Louis Stevenson, who stayed at  ªƒÄinahau over the course of Ka ªiualani's childhood. The estate was sold in 1917 and subdivided after plans to turn it into a park fell through. The house burned down in 1921 due to what was thought to be a gas leak.

The site was later developed by the owners of the Moana Hotel, located across KalƒÅkaua Avenue, which had been built towards the end of Ka ªiulani's life. Bungalows for the main hotel were constructed on the site. They were demolished in 1953 and the Matson Line constructed the Princess Kaiulani Hotel, which opened on 11 June 1955. The 11-story building was the tallest in Hawaii at the time. In 1959, Matson sold their hotels to Sheraton Hotels. They added a second wing to the successful Princess Kaiulani Hotel in 1960, with 210 additional rooms. The hotel was sold to Kyo-Ya Company Limited in July 1963, though Sheraton continued to operate it. Kyo-Ya added a third wing, the 29-story Ainahau Tower, in 1970. Later in the 1970s, they renamed the hotel the Sheraton Princess Kaiulani Hotel.

They contend that the New Testament includes no authority for churches' support of such institutions. Instead they feel that it is a responsibility and duty of the individual members to assist those in need. Similarly, non-institutional congregations also oppose the use of church facilities for non-church activities (such as fellowship dinners or recreation); as such, they oppose the construction of \\"fellowship halls\\", gymnasiums, and similar structures. The belief is that, although such activities may be beneficial, they are not a proper function of a local congregation. These local churches became separated from \\"mainline\\" (pro- institutional) churches of Christ because of these viewpoints, developing into a distinct segment of congregations by the 1960s. Whether a congregation supports the \\"sponsoring church\\" custom is one way to distinguish between the \\"non-institutional\\" and \\"mainstream\\" congregations. The congregations that advocate financial support or the pooling of resources for the benefit of other entities or organized external evangelical efforts are sometimes called \\"sponsoring churches\\" and identified as \\"mainstream.\\" Membership This fellowship of non-institutional congregations, which intentionally forgoes any para-congregational organizational structure, is estimated at about 120,000 members, accounting for around 9% of the members of Churches of Christ in the United States and for about 15% of congregations. The degree to which members of a congregation associate and interact with members of other Churches of Christ varies greatly by area, from none at all to a considerable degree. Its preachers are trained in a variety of ways. Some study at Florida College, which has no formal ties to any church, and a faculty and student body who are largely associated with the non-institutional churches of Christ. Most of the preachers are mentored by a more experienced preacher or may be self-trained. No formal degree requirements are needed for an individual to be employed as a preacher in the churches of Christ. Identification These congregations generally accept the description \\"non-institutional\\", although they do not officially identify as such on signs, letterhead, or other official documents; some consider pejorative the epithet \\"anti\\" with which they have been called by some in the usually larger mainstream Churches of Christ since the 1950s and 1960s, and likewise the similar term, \\"non-cooperative\\". They identify as part of the original church started by Christ. The 19th century Restoration Movement resulted in an increase in the number of U.S. members. Many outside of these churches sometimes conflate them with other Churches of Christ having similar roots, such as: *groups which serve the Lord's Supper sharing a single cup (commonly referred to as \\"one-cup\\" congregations or \\"one-cuppers\\"), *groups which oppose divided, age-distinct Bible classes, and *groups which oppose paid preachers, but encourage members of the congregation to speak and lead the worship activities (commonly referred to as \\"mutual edification\\" congregations). While the one-cup, non-class, and mutual edification congregations are almost always non-institutional, they became independent from the mainstream well before the main 1950 division among congregations over institutions. Common beliefs Individual churches of Christ are autonomous congregations (without hierarchical central governance, nondenominational), so doctrinal nuances, which others may consider minor and tending toward legalism, vary between congregations. Examples include whether or not to 'corporately' sponsor a youth outing or have auxiliary facilities like a study room or kitchen on church grounds. In general, these churches subscribe to the more conservative positions associated with churches of Christ in matters of authority, organization, and worship. Most congregations in this number can be differentiated from mainstream churches by their strict adherence to the principle of congregational autonomy and by a differentiation of the role of the individual Christian and the congregation. As a result, they oppose the following practices that became widespread in other churches of Christ during the mid-twentieth century, namely: * Support from the church treasury for institutions such as Bible colleges or orphans' homes. Members of non-institutional churches note a distinction between the work assigned to the individual Christian and that assigned to the local congregation collectively (citing passages such as ). While individuals are charged to \\"do good to all men,\\" (), they believe that churches are explicitly assigned a limited number of duties (usually defined as evangelism, edification, and benevolence, the latter generally being limited to only members of a specific congregation, their family members, and/or missionaries supported by the congregation). They oppose a church giving its collective funds to an outside institution or setting up another under its control to do work which they believe the apostles assigned to the individual. For example, while they would refuse to give church funds to an orphans' home or soup kitchen, non-institutional churches would encourage individual members to help such causes. * Churches pooling resources to perform work under the oversight of a single congregation or outside institution. Critics opposed to this practice say such cooperation did not exist in the first century churches and violates the autonomy of the local congregation. They note that the New Testament writings recorded that congregations sometimes sent aid to each other, but they say this practice was always from a single congregation to a single congregation for the benefit of members of the latter. No other arrangement for transfer of funds between churches appears in the New Testament. Thus, members of a non-institutional church would not authorize giving church funds to a missionary society or undertake a \\"sponsoring church\\" arrangement. A non-institutional church may send money to an individual preacher, as there are New Testament examples of this (; ; ). * Church relief for non-Christians (some members define this term as those persons outside the church of Christ), especially as an evangelism tool. Critics of such aid say that every New Testament example of support of needy individuals by churches was of support of fellow Christians. They encourage individual members to seek out and personally help any persons in need, but say the church should provide support only to those it recognizes as faithful and needy Christians, per the New Testament examples. They reject \\"the liberality of your contribution unto them and unto all\\" as an example, claiming that \\"all\\" means \\"all saints\\" rather than \\"all people\\". * A church kitchen or \\"fellowship hall,\\" as well as other forms of church-sponsored social activity. Distinguishing between the work of the church and that of individuals, members of non-institutional churches hold that social activity was an individual practice. They believe there is no example in the New Testament of church funds being used to build a kitchen and eating facility, or to finance social activities. They encourage members to develop social activities with personal funds. In addition, they say the language of forbids the eating of a common meal as a work of the church. History The diversity among autonomous congregations makes it difficult to document their history, either individually or as a group of common interest. Most activity is either the action of an individual congregation (and thus local in scope) or the activity of individuals separate from churches (and thus technically not an act of the churches as institutions). Their activities have been noted through issues that bring about debate and division. Non-institutional churches have faced two major issues in the past century: institutionalism and marriage, divorce, and remarriage. Division over institutionalism The lack of denominational infrastructure leaves a vacuum for inter-congregational discourse among Churches of Christ, one that often has been filled by publications and extra-church institutions such as colleges. These organizations, though overseen and run by members of Churches of Christ, were usually considered the work of individual Christians separate from the churches themselves. Among \\"brotherhood papers\\" in the mid-twentieth century, the Gospel Advocate and Firm Foundation were the oldest and most influential. Among colleges, the largest were Abilene Christian College, Pepperdine, Freed- Hardeman College, David Lipscomb College, and Harding College. Prior to World War II, the practice of local church support for outside institutions (mostly colleges) was uncommon in churches of Christ, but not unheard of. Such arrangements tended to be kept quiet, and the Bible colleges loosely associated with churches of Christ always denied they lobbied churches for money. These denials helped to defuse dissension over the issue, as most objectors were loath to interfere with church autonomy. =First rumblings= In the 1930s, however, some men began actively promoting church funding of Bible colleges. The most prominent of these was G. C. Brewer, who throughout the decade engaged in a running debate with various people on the issue. He had begun advancing his theories in a speech at the 1931 Abilene Christian College Lectures. In 1933, he had written a series of articles in the Gospel Advocate arguing that churches should support educational institutions and charities from their treasuries. He continued this line of argumentation throughout the decade. Finally, Brewer's unscripted remarks in support of church funding for colleges at the 1938 Abilene Christian College lectures provoked great controversy. Several writers, such as Foy E. Wallace, Jr. and W. W. Otey, wrote and spoke in opposition to Brewer; Otey's 1938 article in Firm Foundation included statements from leaders of colleges that they \\"regretted\\" Brewer's statements. Publicly, Brewer's position received little support; privately, however, prominent men such as B. C. Goodpasture, N. B. Hardeman, and Robert M. Alexander agreed with the proposition, though most were noncommital when asked specifically about their position. World War II largely suspended the debate, as the question of pacifism took center stage in \\"brotherhood papers.\\" However, division had not been prevented, only postponed. =The aftermath of World War II= After the conclusion of World War II, several factors worked together to bring the institutional question back to the foreground. First, many of the previous generation of perceived leaders (such as Daniel Sommer, J. D. Tant, Joe Warlick, and F. B. Srygley) had died, leaving others with different beliefs and dispositions to take their place. The most notable of these was Goodpasture, who had ascended to be editor of the Gospel Advocate in 1939; he is generally regarded as the most influential figure among Churches of Christ at this time. Also, the Depression and war had led to lower enrollment at many Bible colleges; this in turn caused many of the colleges to postpone expansion and even maintenance. However, the G.I. Bill brought with it an influx of enrollment at these colleges. Bible colleges thus found themselves in need of immediate funds to renovate and expand to meet a swelling demand. Finally, evangelism in Europe became possible after the war. However, the expense involved was considerable. As a result, some congregations and individuals began experimenting with various methods of congregational cooperation. The most notable of these was the \\"sponsoring church\\" arrangement, where one congregation oversees a project using resources pooled from other congregations. The best-known of these efforts was the Herald of Truth, a nationwide radio program begun by the Highland Church of Christ in Abilene, Texas, in 1952. =Controversy and division erupt= The issue of church support for institutions arose anew quickly after the war. Many of those who had been silent before now saw much to gain by raising the issue. No longer was it a mere hypothetical question, but one where a strict interpretation of congregational independence and separation of the individual and the church would, in their estimation, lead to lost opportunities. The pro-institutional camp learned from the experience of the 1930s and the tepid support for sending money to colleges from the church treasury. They tried a different tactic, tying church support of colleges with church support of other institutions, namely orphans' homes. As N. B. Hardeman wrote in Firm Foundation in 1947, \\"I have always believed that a church has the right to contribute to a school or an orphanage if it so desired... The same principle that permits one must also permit the other. They must stand or fall together.\\" This statement serves as a summary statement of the \\"institutional\\" or \\"mainline\\" position. The addition of the emotional element of \\"starving orphans\\" proved successful at persuading many who had been on the fence to the institutional side during the 1950s. However, it also led to rancor; what had previously been a largely civil debate erupted into name-calling and bitter dissension. Those who objected to churches funding private institutions were often referred to as \\"orphan haters\\", \\"Pharisees,\\" and the like;Hughes, Richard: Reviving the Ancient Faith: The Stories of Churches of Christ in America, page 233 for their part, non- institutionals such as Foy E. Wallace, Jr. returned (and at times initiated) the rhetorical fire. Well-known preachers with ties to the colleges became increasingly assertive in condemning anyone who disagreed. Accusations of coercion and intimidation swirled around the colleges. Those with outside businesses, particularly on the non-institutional side, often found themselves facing boycotts organized by those opposing their position. The leading voices of the institutional movement were men such as G. C. Brewer, N. B. Hardeman, Robert M. Alexander, and B. C. Goodpasture. The non-institutional side of the debate was led by men such as Foy E. Wallace Jr., Roy Cogdill, and Fanning Yater Tant. From the beginning, the non-institutional side found itself outmaneuvered by the institutionals, who held the reins of power at all the large Bible colleges and the most popular of publications. It was not aided by infighting between the various proponents, climaxing in the 1951 split of the Fourth and Groesbeck Church of Christ in Lufkin, Texas, leading to two congregations, one with Cogdill as preacher, the other with Wallace's brother Cled preaching. Foy Wallace, the most polarizing figure in the debate, thereafter ceased arguing for a non-institutional position; indeed, by the mid-1960s, he associated himself exclusively with institutional churches. Late 1954 provided two factors key to the developing split. First, in October, G. H. P. Showalter, the editor of Firm Foundation, died and was replaced by Reuel Lemmons. The paper had in previous years stood opposed to the colleges on many matters and had positioned itself under Showalter as a place for balanced debate. Under Lemmons, however, the paper took an increasingly pro- institutional position. The second, and more important, action was publicized in the Gospel Advocate in December of that year. Goodpasture called for a \\"yellow tag of quarantine\\" to be imposed upon any who espoused the non- institutional position. The historian David Edwin Harrell contrasted B. C. Goodpasture with the \\"fighting style\\" of Foy Wallace: \\"Foy Wallace scorched heretics; Goodpasture warned them they would lose their position within the brotherhood.\\"Harrell, David Edwin: \\"B. C. Goodpasture: Leader of Institutional Thought\\", page 250. They Being Dead Yet Speak: Florida College Annual Lectures 1981, Florida College Bookstore, 1981 Goodpasture's political style led him \\"to cut his losses and to consolidate his assets,\\" in the words of historian Richard Hughes.Hughes, Richard: Reviving the Ancient Faith: The Stories of Churches of Christ in America, page 238 He recommended expelling non- institutional members from existing congregations, firing preachers who took this position and cancelling their meetings at institutional churches, and blackballing congregations that resisted conforming to institutionalism. The institutional movement turned from persuasion to isolation of its opponents. Across the next decade, bitter division erupted in Churches of Christ throughout the nation. Debates were held over the issues, though usually positions had already hardened beyond persuasion. Preachers suspected of taking positions at odds with the leadership were ordered to publicly refute said position as a condition of employment; the Gospel Advocate became a forum for some better-known preachers to recant publicly previous positions opposing institutionalism. Some churches were forced to make token donations to institutions in order to avoid being called \\"anti's.\\" Conflict sometimes ended in fistfights. Members who espoused a minority position in a congregation were expelled. Lawsuits over building ownership followed from some of these divisions. Exiles often banded together to form new congregations; some rural communities today are home to two or more small Churches of Christ as the legacy of this division. By the end of the 1960s, the isolation of non- institutionals from the mainstream churches was concluded. Contact between churches and individuals across the divide essentially ended. Members of both branches practiced the beliefs which they held were the only correct ones. Aftermath of the division Most non-institutional churches had to rebuild in the 1960s and 1970s, as in most instances, they had lost buildings, positions, and jobs as a result of the division. They were united by their beliefs during this period. The most significant discussion of this time reflected the \\"unity in diversity\\" debate taking place in institutional churches; but it was little accepted in the more conservative non- institutional branch. Men such as Carl Ketcherside and Edward Fudge preached this message. Most within non-institutional churches refer to themselves as \\"conservative\\" churches of Christ and the non-institutionals refer to the Bible college-supporting, \\"mainstream\\" or \\"sponsoring church\\" congregations as \\"liberal,\\" which leads to some confusion since the \\"mainline\\" churches use the terms \\"conservative\\" and \\"liberal\\" to refer to two separate strands within their own congregations. Many in the non-institutional congregations are not aware that institutional congregations have their own differences, and consider them all as \\"liberal.\\" Many in the institutional congregations do not know the history or existence of the non-institutional groups. In 2009, non- institutional churches of Christ comprised 113,656 members across 1,898 congregations. The October 2019 editions of both Truth Magazine and the Gospel Advocate include six articles discussing the underlying Biblical questions surrounding institutionalism, three by Kyle Pope, who preaches for the Olsen Park Church of Christ in Amarillo, Texas, and three by Doug Burleson, Associate Professor in Bible at Freed-Hardeman University and Assistant Dean of the College of Biblical Studies. The two men engaged in a public discussion on November 15, 2019, at the Freed-Hardeman University Renaissance Center in Dickson, Tennessee, which was also live-streamed on Facebook. A forthcoming written discussion from Truth Magazine will provide further insights into the perspectives of Burleson and Pope on these issues.

Courts have referred to it as reliable evidence of the Founding Fathers' intentions regarding the Constitution's meaning and what they hoped the Constitution would achieve. Text Drafting The Preamble was placed in the Constitution during the last days of the Constitutional Convention by the Committee on Style, which wrote its final draft, with Gouverneur Morris leading the effort. It was not proposed or discussed on the floor of the convention beforehand. The initial wording of the preamble did not refer to the people of the United States, rather, it referred to people of the various states, which was the norm. In earlier documents, including the 1778 Treaty of Alliance with France, the Articles of Confederation, and the 1783 Treaty of Paris recognizing American independence, the word \\"people\\" was not used, and the phrase the United States was followed immediately by a listing of the states, from north to south. The change was made out of necessity, as the Constitution provided that whenever the popularly elected ratifying conventions of nine states gave their approval, it would go into effect for those nine, irrespective of whether any of the remaining states ratified.Sch√ºtze, Robert. European Constitutional Law, p. 50 (Cambridge University Press 2012). Meaning and application The Preamble serves solely as an introduction, and does not assign powers to the federal government,See Jacobson v. Massachusetts, 197 U.S. 11, 22 (1905) (\\"Although th[e] preamble indicates the general purposes for which the people ordained and established the Constitution, it has never been regarded as the source of any substantive power conferred on the government of the United States, or on any of its departments.\\"); see also United States v. Boyer, 85 F. 425, 430‚Äì31 (W.D. Mo. 1898) (\\"The preamble never can be resorted to, to enlarge the powers confided to the general government, or any of its departments. It cannot confer any power per se. It can never amount, by implication, to an enlargement of any power expressly given. It can never be the legitimate source of any implied power, when otherwise withdrawn from the constitution. Its true office is to expound the nature and extent and application of the powers actually conferred by the constitution, and not substantively to create them.\\" (quoting 1 JOSEPH STORY, COMMENTARIES ON THE CONSTITUTION OF THE UNITED STATES ¬ß 462 (1833)) (internal quotation marks omitted)). nor does it provide specific limitations on government action. Due to the Preamble's limited nature, no court has ever used it as a decisive factor in case adjudication,It is difficult to prove a negative, but courts have at times acknowledged this apparent truism. See, e.g., Boyer, 85 F. at 430 (\\"I venture the opinion that no adjudicated case can be cited which traces to the preamble the power to enact any statute.\\"). except as regards frivolous litigation.In Jacobs v. Pataki, 68 F. App'x 222, 224 (2d Cir. 2003), the plaintiff made the bizarre argument that \\"the 'United States of America' that was granted Article III power in the Constitution is distinct from the 'United States' that currently exercises that power\\"; the court dismissed this contention with 3 words (\\"it is not\\") and cited a comparison of the Preamble's reference to the \\"United States of America\\" with Article III's vesting of the \\"judicial Power of the United States.\\" Judicial relevance The courts have shown interest in any clues they can find in the Preamble regarding the Constitution's meaning.Legal Tender Cases, 79 U.S. (12 Wall.) 457, 531‚Äì32 (1871) (\\"[I]t [cannot] be questioned that, when investigating the nature and extent of the powers, conferred by the Constitution upon Congress, it is indispensable to keep in view the objects for which those powers were granted. This is a universal rule of construction applied alike to statutes, wills, contracts, and constitutions. If the general purpose of the instrument is ascertained, the language of its provisions must be construed with reference to that purpose and so as to subserve it. In no other way can the intent of the framers of the instrument be discovered. And there are more urgent reasons for looking to the ultimate purpose in examining the powers conferred by a constitution than there are in construing a statute, a will, or a contract. We do not expect to find in a constitution minute details. It is necessarily brief and comprehensive. It prescribes outlines, leaving the filling up to be deduced from the outlines.\\"), abrogated on other grounds by Pa. Coal Co. v. Mahon, 260 U.S. 393 (1922), as recognized in Lucas v. S.C. Coastal Council, 505 U.S. 1003 (1992). Courts have developed several techniques for interpreting the meaning of statutes and these are also used to interpret the Constitution.Cf. Badger v. Hoidale, 88 F.2d 208, 211 (8th Cir. 1937) (\\"Rules applicable to the construction of a statute are equally applicable to the construction of a Constitution.\\" (citing Taylor v. Taylor, 10 Minn. 107 (1865))). As a result, the courts have said that interpretive techniques that focus on the exact text of a documentExamples include the \\"plain meaning rule,\\" Pollock v. Farmers' Loan & Trust Co., 158 U.S. 601, 619 (1895) (\\"The words of the Constitution are to be taken in their obvious sense, and to have a reasonable construction.\\"), superseded on other grounds by U.S. CONST. amend. XVI, as recognized in Brushaber v. Union Pac. R.R., 240 U.S. 1 (1916); McPherson v. Blacker, 146 U.S. 1, 27 (1892) (\\"The framers of the Constitution employed words in their natural sense; and where they are plain and clear, resort to collateral aids to interpretation is unnecessary and cannot be indulged in to narrow or enlarge the text . . . .\\"), and noscitur a sociis, Virginia v. Tennessee, 148 U.S. 503, 519 (1893) (\\"It is a familiar rule in the construction of terms to apply to them the meaning naturally attaching to them from their context. Noscitur a sociis is a rule of construction applicable to all written instruments. Where any particular word is obscure or of doubtful meaning, taken by itself, its obscurity or doubt may be removed by reference to associated words. And the meaning of a term may be enlarged or restrained by reference to the object of the whole clause in which it is used.\\"). should be used in interpreting the meaning of the Constitution. Balanced against these techniques are those that focus more attention on broader efforts to discern the meaning of the document from more than just the wording;See, e.g., Hooven & Allison Co. v. Evatt, 324 U.S. 652, 663 (1945) (\\"[I]n determining the meaning and application of [a] constitutional provision, we are concerned with matters of substance, not of form.\\"), overruled on other grounds by Limbach v. Hooven & Allison Co., 466 U.S. 353 (1984); South Carolina v. United States, 199 U.S. 437, 451 (1905) (\\"[I]t is undoubtedly true that that which is implied is as much a part of the Constitution as that which is expressed.\\"), overruled on other grounds by Garcia v. San Antonio Metro. Transit Auth., 469 U.S. 528 (1985); Ex parte Yarbrough, 110 U.S. 651, 658 (1884) (\\"[I]n construing the Constitution of the United States, [courts use] the doctrine universally applied to all instruments of writing, that what is implied is as much a part of the instrument as what is expressed. This principle, in its application to the Constitution of the United States, more than to almost any other writing, is a necessity, by reason of the inherent inability to put into words all derivative powers . . . .\\"); Packet Co. v. Keokuk, 95 U.S. 80, 87 (1877) (\\"A mere adherence to the letter [of the Constitution], without reference to the spirit and purpose, may [sometimes] mislead.\\"). the Preamble is also useful for these efforts to identify the \\"spirit\\" of the Constitution. Additionally, when interpreting a legal document, courts are usually interested in understanding the document as its authors did and their motivations for creating it;Missouri v. Illinois, 180 U.S. 208, 219 (1901) (\\"[W]hen called upon to construe and apply a provision of the Constitution of the United States, [courts] must look not merely to its language but to its historical origin, and to those decisions of this court in which its meaning and the scope of its operation have received deliberate consideration.\\"). as a result, the courts have cited the Preamble for evidence of the history, intent and meaning of the Constitution as it was understood by the Founders.United States v. S.-E. Underwriters Ass'n, 322 U.S. 533, 539 (1944) (\\"Ordinarily courts do not construe words used in the Constitution so as to give them a meaning more narrow than one which they had in the common parlance of the times in which the Constitution was written.\\"), superseded on other grounds by statute, McCarran-Ferguson Act, ch. 20, 59 Stat. 33 (1945) (codified as amended at 15 U.S.C. ¬ß¬ß 1011‚Äì1015 (2006)), as recognized in U.S. Dep't of the Treasury v. Fabe, 508 U.S. 491 (1993); Ex parte Bain, 121 U.S. 1, 12 (1887) (\\"[I]n the construction of the language of the Constitution . . . , we are to place ourselves as nearly as possible in the condition of the men who framed that instrument.\\"), overruled on other grounds by United States v. Miller, 471 U.S. 130 (1985), and United States v. Cotton, 535 U.S. 625 (2002). Although revolutionary in some ways, the Constitution maintained many common law concepts (such as habeas corpus, trial by jury, and sovereign immunity),United States v. Sanges, 144 U.S. 310, 311 (1892) (\\"[T]he Constitution . . . is to be read in the light of the common law, from which our system of jurisprudence is derived.\\" (citations omitted)); Smith v. Alabama, 124 U.S. 465, 478 (1888) (\\"The interpretation of the Constitution of the United States is necessarily influenced by the fact that its provisions are framed in the language of the English common law, and are to be read in the light of its history.\\"). and courts deem that the Founders' perceptions of the legal system that the Constitution created (i.e., the interaction between what it changed and what it kept from the British legal systemUnited States v. Wood, 299 U.S. 123, 142 (1936) (\\"Whether a clause in the Constitution is to be restricted by a rule of the common law as it existed when the Constitution was adopted depends upon the terms or nature of the particular clause.\\" (citing Cont'l Ill. Nat'l Bank & Trust Co. v. Chi., Rock Island & Pac. Ry. Co., 294 U.S. 648 (1935))); Mattox v. United States, 156 U.S. 237, 243 (1895) (\\"We are bound to interpret the Constitution in the light of the law as it existed at the time it was adopted, not as reaching out for new guaranties of the rights of the citizen, but as securing to every individual such as he already possessed as a British subject -- such as his ancestors had inherited and defended since the days of Magna Charta.\\").) are uniquely important because of the authority \\"the People\\" invested them with to create it.Veazie Bank v. Fenno, 75 U.S. (8 Wall.) 533, 542 (1869) (\\"We are obliged . . . to resort to historical evidence, and to seek the meaning of the words [in the Constitution] in the use and in the opinion of those whose relations to the government, and means of knowledge, warranted them in speaking with authority.\\"). Along with evidence of the understandings of the men who debated and drafted the Constitution at the Constitutional Convention, the courts are also interested in the way that government officials have put into practice the Constitution's provisions, particularly early government officials,McPherson v. Blacker, 146 U.S. 1, 27 (1892) (\\"[W]here there is ambiguity or doubt [in the meaning of constitutional language], or where two views may well be entertained, contemporaneous and subsequent practical construction are entitled to the greatest weight.\\"); Murray's Lessee v. Hoboken Land & Improvement Co., 59 U.S. (18 How.) 272, 279‚Äì80 (1856) (\\"[A] legislative construction of the constitution, commencing so early in the government, when the first occasion for [a] manner of proceeding arose, continued throughout its existence, and repeatedly acted on by the judiciary and the executive, is entitled to no inconsiderable weight upon the question whether the proceeding adopted by it was 'due process of law.'\\" (citations omitted)). although the courts reserve to themselves the final authority to determine the Constitution's meaning.Fairbank v. United States, 181 U.S. 283, 311 (1901) (\\"[A] practical construction [of the Constitution] is relied upon only in cases of doubt. . . . Where there was obviously a matter of doubt, we have yielded assent to the construction placed by those having actual charge of the execution of the statute, but where there was no doubt we have steadfastly declined to recognize any force in practical construction. Thus, before any appeal can be made to practical construction, it must appear that the true meaning is doubtful.\\"); see Marbury v. Madison, 5 U.S. (1 Cranch) 137, 177 (1803) (\\"It is emphatically the province and duty of the judicial department to say what the law is.\\"). However, this focus on historical understandings of the Constitution is sometimes in tension with the changed circumstances of modern society from the late 18th century society that drafted the Constitution; courts have ruled that the Constitution must be interpreted in light of these changed circumstances.In re Debs, 158 U.S. 564, 591 (1895) (\\"Constitutional provisions do not change, but their operation extends to new matters as the modes of business and the habits of life of the people vary with each succeeding generation.\\"), overruled on other grounds by Bloom v. Illinois, 391 U.S. 194 (1968); R.R. Co. v. Peniston, 85 U.S. (18 Wall.) 5, 31 (1873) (\\"[T]he Federal Constitution must receive a practical construction. Its limitations and its implied prohibitions must not be extended so far as to destroy the necessary powers of the States, or prevent their efficient exercise.\\"); In re Jackson, 13 F. Cas. 194, 196 (C.C.S.D.N.Y. 1877) (No. 7124) (\\"[I]n construing a grant of power in the constitution, it is to be construed according to the fair and reasonable import of its terms, and its construction is not necessarily to be controlled by a reference to what existed when the constitution was adopted.\\"). All of these considerations of the political theory behind the Constitution have prompted the Supreme Court to articulate a variety of special rules of construction and principles for interpreting it.E.g., Richfield Oil Corp. v. State Bd. of Equalization, 329 U.S. 69, 77, 78 (1946) (\\"[T]o infer qualifications does not comport with the standards for expounding the Constitution. . . . We cannot, therefore, read the prohibition against 'any' tax on exports as containing an implied qualification.\\"); Fairbank, 181 U.S. at 287 (\\"The words expressing the various grants [of power] in the Constitution are words of general import, and they are to be construed as such, and as granting to the full extent the powers named.\\"); Shreveport v. Cole, 129 U.S. 36, 43 (1889) (\\"Constitutions . . . are construed to operate prospectively only, unless, on the face of the instrument or enactment, the contrary intention is manifest beyond reasonable question.\\") For example, the Court's rendering of the purposes behind the Constitution have led it to express a preference for broad interpretations of individual freedoms.Boyd v. United States, 116 U.S. 616, 635 (1886) (\\"[C]onstitutional provisions for the security of person and property should be liberally construed. A close and literal construction deprives them of half their efficacy, and leads to gradual depreciation of the right, as if it consisted more in sound than in substance. It is the duty of courts to be watchful for the constitutional rights of the citizen, and against any stealthy encroachments thereon.\\"), recognized as abrogated on other grounds in Fisher v. United States, 425 U.S. 391 (1976). Examples An example of the way courts utilize the Preamble is Ellis v. City of Grand Rapids.257 F. Supp. 564 (W.D. Mich. 1966). Substantively, the case was about eminent domain. The City of Grand Rapids wanted to use eminent domain to force landowners to sell property in the city identified as \\"blighted\\", and convey the property to owners that would develop it in ostensibly beneficial ways: in this case, to St. Mary's Hospital, a Catholic organization. This area of substantive constitutional law is governed by the Fifth Amendment, which is understood to require that property acquired via eminent domain must be put to a \\"public use\\". In deciding whether the proposed project constituted a \\"public use\\", the court pointed to the Preamble's reference to \\"promot[ing] the general Welfare\\" as evidence that \\"[t]he health of the people was in the minds of our forefathers\\".Id. at 572. \\"[T]he concerted effort for renewal and expansion of hospital and medical care centers, as a part of our nation's system of hospitals, is as a public service and use within the highest meaning of such terms. Surely this is in accord with an objective of the United States Constitution: 'promote the general Welfare.'\\"Id. at 574 (emphasis added). On the other hand, courts will not interpret the Preamble to give the government powers that are not articulated elsewhere in the Constitution. United States v. Kinnebrew Motor Co.. is an example of this. In that case, the defendants were a car manufacturer and dealership indicted for a criminal violation of the National Industrial Recovery Act. The Congress passed the statute in order to cope with the Great Depression, and one of its provisions purported to give to the President authority to fix \\"the prices at which new cars may be sold\\".Id. at 535. The dealership, located in Oklahoma City, had sold an automobile to a customer (also from Oklahoma City) for less than the price for new cars fixed pursuant to the Act. Substantively, the case was about whether the transaction in question constituted \\"interstate commerce\\" that Congress could regulate pursuant to the Commerce Clause.U.S. CONST. art. I, ¬ß 8, cl. 3. (\\"The Congress shall have power . . . [t]o regulate commerce . . . among the several states . . . .\\"). Although the government argued that the scope of the Commerce Clause included this transaction, it also argued that the Preamble's statement that the Constitution was created to \\"promote the general Welfare\\" should be understood to permit Congress to regulate transactions such as the one in this case, particularly in the face of an obvious national emergency like the Great Depression. The court, however, dismissed this argument as erroneousKinnebrew Motor Co., 8 F. Supp. at 539 (\\"Reference has been made in the government's brief to the 'Welfare Clause' of the Constitution as if certain powers could be derived by Congress from said clause. It is not necessary to indulge in an extended argument on this question for the reason that there is no such thing as the 'Welfare Clause' of the Constitution.\\"). and insisted that the only relevant issue was whether the transaction that prompted the indictment actually constituted \\"interstate commerce\\" under the Supreme Court's precedents that interpreted the scope of the Commerce Clause.Id. at 544 (\\"The only question which this court pretends to determine in this case is whether or not the sale of automobiles, in a strictly retail business in the vicinity of Oklahoma City, constitutes interstate commerce, and this court, without hesitation, finds that there is no interstate commerce connected with the transactions described in this indictment, and if there is no interstate commerce, Congress has no authority to regulate these transactions.\\") Interpretation =Aspects of national sovereignty= The Preamble's reference to the \\"United States of America\\" has been interpreted over the years to explain the nature of the governmental entity that the Constitution created (i.e., the federal government). In contemporary international law, the world consists of sovereign states (or \\"sovereign nations\\" in modern equivalent). A state is said to be \\"sovereign,\\" if any of its ruling inhabitants are the supreme authority over it; the concept is distinct from mere land-title or \\"ownership.\\"See Shapleigh v. Mier, 299 U.S. 468, 470, 471 (1937) (when certain land passed from Mexico to the United States because of a shift in the Rio Grande's course, \\"[s]overeignty was thus transferred, but private ownership remained the same\\"; thus, a decree of a Mexican government official determining title to the land, \\"if lawful and effective under the Constitution and laws of Mexico, must be recognized as lawful and effective under the laws of the United States, the sovereignty of Mexico at the time of that decree being exclusive of any other\\") While each state was originally recognized as sovereign unto itself, the Supreme Court held that the \\"United States of America\\" consists of only one sovereign nation with respect to foreign affairs and international relations; the individual states may not conduct foreign relations.Chae Chan Ping v. United States, 130 U.S. 581, 604, 606 (1889) (\\"[T]he United States, in their relation to foreign countries and their subjects or citizens, are one nation, invested with powers which belong to independent nations, the exercise of which can be invoked for the maintenance of its absolute independence and security throughout its entire territory. The powers to declare war, make treaties, suppress insurrection, repel invasion, regulate foreign commerce, secure republican governments to the states, and admit subjects of other nations to citizenship are all sovereign powers, restricted in their exercise only by the Constitution itself and considerations of public policy and justice which control, more or less, the conduct of all civilized nations. . . . For local interests, the several states of the union exist, but for national purposes, embracing our relations with foreign nations, we are but one people, one nation, one power.\\"). Although the Constitution expressly delegates to the federal government only some of the usual powers of sovereign governments (such as the powers to declare war and make treaties), all such powers inherently belong to the federal government as the country's representative in the international community.United States v. Curtiss-Wright Export Corp., 299 U.S. 304, 318 (1936) (\\"[T]he investment of the federal government with the powers of external sovereignty did not depend upon the affirmative grants of the Constitution. The powers to declare and wage war, to conclude peace, to make treaties, to maintain diplomatic relations with other sovereignties, if they had never been mentioned in the Constitution, would have vested in the federal government as necessary concomitants of nationality. . . . As a member of the family of nations, the right and power of the United States in that field are equal to the right and power of the other members of the international family. Otherwise, the United States is not completely sovereign.\\"). Domestically, the federal government's sovereignty means that it may perform acts such as entering into contracts or accepting bonds, which are typical of governmental entities but not expressly provided for in the Constitution or laws.United States v. Bradley, 35 U.S. (10 Pet.) 343, 359 (1836) (\\"[T]he United States being a body politic, as an incident to its general right of sovereignty, has a capacity to enter into contracts and take bonds in cases within the sphere of its constitutional powers and appropriate to the just exercise of those powers, . . . whenever such contracts or bonds are not prohibited by law, although the making of such contracts or taking such bonds may not have been prescribed by any preexisting legislative act.\\"); United States v. Tingey, 30 U.S. (5 Pet.) 115, 128 (1831) (\\"[T]he United States has . . . [the] capacity to enter into contracts [or to take a bond in cases not previously provided for by some law]. It is in our opinion an incident to the general right of sovereignty, and the United States being a body politic, may, within the sphere of the constitutional powers confided to it, and through the instrumentality of the proper department to which those powers are confided, enter into contracts not prohibited by law and appropriate to the just exercise of those powers. . . . To adopt a different principle would be to deny the ordinary rights of sovereignty not merely to the general government, but even to the state governments within the proper sphere of their own powers, unless brought into operation by express legislation.\\") Similarly, the federal government, as an attribute of sovereignty, has the power to enforce those powers that are granted to it (e.g., the power to \\"establish Post Offices and Post Roads\\"U.S. CONST. art. I, ¬ß 8, cl. 7 includes the power to punish those who interfere with the postal system so established).In re Debs, 158 U.S. 564, 578, 582 (1895) (\\"While, under the dual system which prevails with us, the powers of government are distributed between the State and the Nation, and while the latter is properly styled a government of enumerated powers, yet within the limits of such enumeration, it has all the attributes of sovereignty, and, in the exercise of those enumerated powers, acts directly upon the citizen, and not through the intermediate agency of the State. . . . The entire strength of the nation may be used to enforce in any part of the land the full and free exercise of all national powers and the security of all rights entrusted by the Constitution to its care. The strong arm of the national government may be put forth to brush away all obstructions to the freedom of interstate commerce or the transportation of the mails. If the emergency arises, the army of the Nation, and all its militia, are at the service of the Nation to compel obedience to its laws.\\") The Court has recognized the federal government's supreme powerIn re Quarles, 158 U.S. 532, 535 (1895) (\\"The United States are a nation, whose powers of government, legislative, executive and judicial, within the sphere of action confided to it by the Constitution, are supreme and paramount. Every right, created by, arising under or dependent upon the Constitution, may be protected and enforced by such means, and in such manner, as Congress, in the exercise of the correlative duty of protection, or of the legislative powers conferred upon it by the Constitution, may in its discretion deem most eligible and best adapted to attain the object.\\" (citing Logan v. United States, 144 U.S. 263, 293 (1892))); Dobbins v. Comm'rs of Erie Cnty., 41 U.S. (16 Pet.) 435, 447 (1842) (\\"The government of the United States is supreme within its sphere of action.\\"), overruled on other grounds by Graves v. New York ex rel. O'Keefe, 306 U.S. 466 (1939), and superseded on other grounds by statute, Public Salary Tax Act of 1939, ch. 59, 53 Stat. 574 (codified as amended at 4 U.S.C. ¬ß 111 (2006)). over those limited mattersUnited States v. Butler, 297 U.S. 1, 68 (1936) (\\"From the accepted doctrine that the United States is a government of delegated powers, it follows that those not expressly granted, or reasonably to be implied from such as are conferred, are reserved to the states or to the people. To forestall any suggestion to the contrary, the Tenth Amendment was adopted. The same proposition, otherwise stated, is that powers not granted are prohibited. None to regulate agricultural production is given, and therefore legislation by Congress for that purpose is forbidden.\\" (footnote omitted)); Pac. Ins. Co. v. Soule, 74 U.S. (7 Wall.) 433, 444 (1869) (\\"The national government, though supreme within its own sphere, is one of limited jurisdiction and specific functions. It has no faculties but such as the Constitution has given it, either expressly or incidentally by necessary intendment. Whenever any act done under its authority is challenged, the proper sanction must be found in its charter, or the act is ultra vires and void.\\"); Briscoe v. President of the Bank of Ky., 36 U.S. (11 Pet.) 257, 317 (1837) (\\"The federal government is one of delegated powers. All powers not delegated to it, or inhibited to the states, are reserved to the states, or to the people.\\") entrusted to it. Thus, no state may interfere with the federal government's operations as though its sovereignty is superior to the federal government's (discussed more below); for example, states may not interfere with the federal government's near absolute discretion to sell its own real property, even when that real property is located in one or another state.See U.S. CONST. art. IV, ¬ß 3, cl. 2; United States v. Bd. of Com'rs, 145 F.2d 329, 330 (10th Cir. 1944) (\\"Congress is vested with the absolute right to designate the persons to whom real property belonging to the United States shall be transferred, and to prescribe the conditions and mode of the transfer; and a state has no power to interfere with that right or to embarrass the exercise of it. Property owned by the United States is immune from taxation by the state or any of its subdivisions.\\") The federal government exercises its supreme power not as a unitary entity, but instead via the three coordinate branches of the government (legislative, executive, and judicial),Dodge v. Woolsey, 59 U.S. (18 How.) 331, 347 (1885) (\\"The departments of the government are legislative, executive, and judicial. They are co ordinate in degree to the extent of the powers delegated to each of them. Each, in the exercise of its powers, is independent of the other, but all, rightfully done by either, is binding upon the others. The constitution is supreme over all of them, because the people who ratified it have made it so; consequently, anything which may be done unauthorized by it is unlawful.\\") each of which has its own prescribed powers and limitations under the Constitution.See Loan Ass'n v. Topeka, 87 U.S. (20 Wall.) 655, 663 (1875) (\\"The theory of our governments, state and national, is opposed to the deposit of unlimited power anywhere. The executive, the legislative, and the judicial branches of these governments are all of limited and defined powers.\\"); Hepburn v. Griswold, 75 U.S. (8 Wall.) 603, 611 (1870) (\\"[T]he Constitution is the fundamental law of the United States. By it the people have created a government, defined its powers, prescribed their limits, distributed them among the different departments, and directed in general the manner of their exercise. No department of the government has any other powers than those thus delegated to it by the people. All the legislative power granted by the Constitution belongs to Congress, but it has no legislative power which is not thus granted. And the same observation is equally true in its application to the executive and judicial powers granted respectively to the President and the courts. All these powers differ in kind, but not in source or in limitation. They all arise from the Constitution, and are limited by its terms.\\") In addition, the doctrine of separation of powers functions as a limitation on each branch of the federal government's exercise of sovereign power.Humphrey's Ex'r v. United States, 295 U.S. 602, 629‚Äì30 (1935) (\\"The fundamental necessity of maintaining each of the three general departments of government entirely free from the control or coercive influence, direct or indirect, of either of the others has often been stressed, and is hardly open to serious question. So much is implied in the very fact of the separation of the powers of these departments by the Constitution, and in the rule which recognizes their essential coequality.\\"); e.g., Ainsworth v. Barn Ballroom Co., 157 F.2d 97, 100 (4th Cir. 1946) (judiciary has no power to review a military order barring servicemen from patronizing a certain dance hall due to separation of powers concerns because \\"the courts may not invade the executive departments to correct alleged mistakes arising out of abuse of discretion[;] . . . to do so would interfere with the performance of governmental functions and vitally affect the interests of the United States\\") One aspect of the American system of government is that, while the rest of the world now views the United States as one country, domestically American constitutional law recognizes a federation of state governments separate from (and not subdivisions of) the federal government, each of which is sovereign over its own affairs.Tarble's Case, 80 U.S. (13 Wall.) 397, 406 (1872) (\\"There are within the territorial limits of each state two governments, restricted in their spheres of action but independent of each other and supreme within their respective spheres. Each has its separate departments, each has its distinct laws, and each has its own tribunals for their enforcement. Neither government can intrude within the jurisdiction, or authorize any interference therein by its judicial officers with the action of the other.\\") Sometimes, the Supreme Court has even analogized the States to being foreign countries to each other to explain the American system of State sovereignty.Bank of Augusta v. Earle, 38 U.S. (13 Pet.) 519, 590 (1839) (\\"It has . . . been supposed that the rules of comity between foreign nations do not apply to the states of this Union, that they extend to one another no other rights than those which are given by the Constitution of the United States, and that the courts of the general government are not at liberty to presume . . . that a state has adopted the comity of nations towards the other states as a part of its jurisprudence or that it acknowledges any rights but those which are secured by the Constitution of the United States. The Court thinks otherwise. The intimate union of these states as members of the same great political family, the deep and vital interests which bind them so closely together, should lead us, in the absence of proof to the contrary, to presume a greater degree of comity and friendship and kindness towards one another than we should be authorized to presume between foreign nations. . . . They are sovereign states, and the history of the past and the events which are daily occurring furnish the strongest evidence that they have adopted towards each other the laws of comity in their fullest extent.\\"); Bank of U.S. v. Daniel, 37 U.S. (12 Pet.) 32, 54 (1838) (\\"The respective states are sovereign within their own limits, and foreign to each other, regarding them as local governments.\\"); Buckner v. Finley, 27 U.S. (2 Pet.) 586, 590 (1829) (\\" For all national purposes embraced by the federal Constitution, the states and the citizens thereof are one, united under the same sovereign authority and governed by the same laws. In all other respects, the states are necessarily foreign to and independent of each other. Their constitutions and forms of government being, although republican, altogether different, as are their laws and institutions.\\") However, each state's sovereignty is limited by the U.S. Constitution, which is the supreme law of both the United States as a nation and each state;Angel v. Bullington, 330 U.S. 183, 188 (1947) (\\"The power of a state to determine the limits of the jurisdiction of its courts and the character of the controversies which shall be heard in them is, of course, subject to the restrictions imposed by the Federal Constitution.\\" (quoting McKnett v. St. Louis & S.F. Ry. Co., 292 U.S. 230, 233 (1934)) (internal quotation marks omitted)); Ableman v. Booth, 62 U.S. (21 How.) 506, 516 (1856) (\\"[A]lthough the State[s] . . . [are] sovereign within [their] territorial limits to a certain extent, yet that sovereignty is limited and restricted by the Constitution of the United States.\\") in the event of a conflict, a valid federal law controls.United Pub. Workers v. Mitchell, 330 U.S. 75, 95‚Äì96 (1947) (\\"The powers granted by the Constitution to the Federal Government are subtracted from the totality of sovereignty originally in the states and the people. Therefore, when objection is made that the exercise of a federal power infringes upon rights reserved by the Ninth and Tenth Amendments, the inquiry must be directed toward the granted power under which the action of the Union was taken. If granted power is found, necessarily the objection of invasion of those rights, reserved by the Ninth and Tenth Amendments, must fail.\\"); Tarble's Case, 80 U.S. at 406 (\\"The two governments in each state stand in their respective spheres of action in the same independent relation to each other, except in one particular, that they would if their authority embraced distinct territories. That particular consists in the supremacy of the authority of the United States when any conflict arises between the two governments.\\"). As a result, although the federal government is (as discussed above) recognized as sovereign and has supreme power over those matters within its control, the American constitutional system also recognizes the concept of \\"State sovereignty,\\" where certain matters are susceptible to government regulation, but only at the State and not the federal level.Worcester v. Georgia, 31 U.S. (6 Pet.) 515, 570 (1832) (\\"The powers given [to the federal government] are limited; and no powers, which are not expressly given, can be exercised by [it]: but, where given, they are supreme. Within the sphere allotted to them, the co- ordinate branches of the general government revolve, unobstructed by any legitimate exercise of power by the state governments. The powers exclusively given to the federal government are limitations upon the state authorities. But, with the exception of these limitations, the states are supreme; and their sovereignty can be no more invaded by the action of the general government, than the action of the state governments in arrest or obstruct the course of the national power.\\"), recognized as abrogated on other grounds in New Mexico v. Mescalero Apache Tribe, 462 U.S. 324 (1983). For example, although the federal government prosecutes crimes against the United States (such as treason, or interference with the postal system), the general administration of criminal justice is reserved to the States.Screws v. United States, 325 U.S. 91, 109 (1945) (\\"Our national government is one of delegated powers alone. Under our federal system, the administration of criminal justice rests with the States except as Congress, acting within the scope of those delegated powers, has created offenses against the United States.\\"). Notwithstanding sometimes broad statements by the Supreme Court regarding the \\"supreme\\" and \\"exclusive\\" powers the State and Federal governments exercise,E.g., Kohl v. United States, 91 U.S. 367, 372 (1876) (\\"Th[e federal] government is as sovereign within its sphere as the states are within theirs. True, its sphere is limited. Certain subjects only are committed to it; but its power over those subjects is as full and complete as is the power of the states over the subjects to which their sovereignty extends.\\"). Taken very literally, statements like this could be understood to suggest that there is no overlap between the State and Federal governments. the Supreme Court and State courts have also recognized that much of their power is held and exercised concurrently.Ex parte McNiel, 80 U.S. (13 Wall.) 236, 240 (1872) (\\"In the complex system of polity which prevails in this country, the powers of government may be divided into four classes. [1] Those which belong exclusively to the states. [2] Those which belong exclusively to the national government. [3] Those which may be exercised concurrently and independently by both. [4] Those which may be exercised by the states, but only until Congress shall see fit to act upon the subject. The authority of the state then retires and lies in abeyance until the occasion for its exercise shall recur.\\"); People ex rel. Woll v. Graber, 68 N.E.2d 750, 754 (Ill. 1946) (\\"The laws of the United States are laws in the several States, and just as binding on the citizens and courts thereof as the State laws are. The United States is not a foreign sovereignty as regards the several States but is a concurrent, and, within its jurisdiction, a paramount authority.\\"); Kersting v. Hargrove, 48 A.2d 309, 310 (N.J. Cir. Ct. 1946) (\\"The United States government is not a foreign sovereignty as respects the several states but is a concurrent, and within its jurisdiction, a superior sovereignty. Every citizen of New Jersey is subject to two distinct sovereignties; that of New Jersey and that of the United States. The two together form one system and the two jurisdictions are not foreign to each other.\\"). =People of the United States= The phrase \\"People of the United States\\" has long been understood to mean \\"nationals and citizens.\\" (\\"Nationals and citizens of United States at birth\\"); (\\"Nationals but not citizens of the United States at birth\\"); Ricketts v. Att'y Gen., 897 F.3d 491, 493-94 n.3 (3d Cir. 2018) (\\"Citizenship and nationality are not synonymous.\\"); Tuaua v. United States, 788 F.3d 300 (D.C. Cir. 2015); Mohammadi v. Islamic Republic of Iran, 782 F.3d 9, 15 (D.C. Cir. 2015) (\\"The sole such statutory provision that presently confers United States nationality upon non-citizens is 8 U.S.C. ¬ß 1408.\\"); Matter of Navas-Acosta, 23 I&N; Dec. 586 (BIA 2003) (same); see also, generally (\\"Restrictions on loss of nationality\\"); ; (\\"Treatment of nationality claims\\"). See also This approach reasons that, if the political community speaking for itself in the Preamble (\\"We the People\\") includes only U.S. nationals and citizens, by negative implication it specifically excludes aliens and foreign nationals.See, e.g., Dred Scott v. Sandford, 60 U.S. (19 How.) 393, 410‚Äì11 (1857) (\\"The brief preamble sets forth by whom [the Constitution] was formed, for what purposes, and for whose benefit and protection. It declares that [the Constitution] [was] formed by the people of the United States; that is to say, by those who were members of the different political communities in the several States; and its great object is declared to be to secure the blessings of liberty to themselves and their posterity. It speaks in general terms of the people of the United States, and of citizens of the several States, when it is providing for the exercise of the powers granted or the privileges secured to the citizen. It does not define what description of persons are intended to be included under these terms, or who shall be regarded as a citizen and one of the people. It uses them as terms so well understood, that no further description or definition was necessary. But there are two clauses in the Constitution which point directly and specifically to the negro race as a separate class of persons, and show clearly that they were not regarded as a portion of the people or citizens of the Government then formed.\\" (emphasis added)), superseded by constitutional amendment, U.S. CONST. amend. XIV, ¬ß 1, as recognized in Slaughter-House Cases, 83 U.S. (16 Wall.) 36 (1873). But see Dredd Scott 60 U.S. 581‚Äì82 (Curtis, J., dissenting) (arguing that \\"the Constitution has recognized the general principle of public law, that allegiance and citizenship depend on the place of birth\\" and that the \\"necessary conclusion is, that those persons born within the several States, who, by force of their respective Constitutions and laws, are citizens of the State, are thereby citizens of the United States\\"). It has also been construed to mean something like \\"all under the sovereign jurisdiction and authority of the United States.\\"Jacobson v. Massachusetts, 197 U.S. 11, 22 (1905) (using this particular phrasing). The phrase has been construed as affirming that the national government created by the Constitution derives its sovereignty from the people,Cf. Carter v. Carter Coal Co., 298 U.S. 238, 296 (1936) (\\"[T]he Constitution itself is in every real sense a law‚Äîthe lawmakers being the people themselves, in whom under our system all political power and sovereignty primarily resides, and through whom such power and sovereignty primarily speaks. It is by that law, and not otherwise, that the legislative, executive, and judicial agencies which it created exercise such political authority as they have been permitted to possess. The Constitution speaks for itself in terms so plain that to misunderstand their import is not rationally possible. 'We the People of the United States,' it says, 'do ordain and establish this Constitution.' Ordain and establish! These are definite words of enactment, and without more would stamp what follows with the dignity and character of law.\\"); Yick Wo v. Hopkins, 118 U.S. 356, 370 (1886) (\\"Sovereignty itself is, of course, not subject to law, for it is the author and source of law; but in our system, while sovereign powers are delegated to the agencies of government, sovereignty itself remains with the people, by whom and for whom all government exists and acts.\\" (emphasis added)); Marbury v. Madison, 5 U.S. (1 Cranch) 137, 176 (1803) (\\"That the people have an original right to establish, for their future government, such principles as, in their opinion, shall most conduce to their own happiness, is the basis on which the whole American fabric has been erected. . . . The principles . . . so established are deemed fundamental. . . . This original and supreme will organizes the government, and assigns to different departments their respective powers.\\" (emphases added)). (whereas \\"United Colonies\\" had identified external monarchical sovereignty) as well as confirming that the government under the Constitution was intended to govern and protect \\"the people\\" directly, as one society, instead of governing only the states as political units.Cf. League v. De Young, 52 U.S. (11 How.) 184, 203 (1851) (\\"The Constitution of the United States was made by, and for the protection of, the people of the United States.\\"); Barron v. Mayor of Balt., 32 U.S. (7 Pet.) 243, 247 (1833) (\\"The constitution was ordained and established by the people of the United States for themselves, for their own government, and not for the government of the individual states. . . . The people of the United States framed such a government for the United States as they supposed best adapted to their situation and best calculated to promote their interests.\\"), superseded on other grounds by constitutional amendment, U.S. CONST. amend. XIV, as recognized in Chi., Burlington & Quincy R.R. v. Chicago, 166 U.S. 226 (1897). While the Supreme Court did not specifically mention the Preamble in these cases, it seems apparent that it was expounding on the implications of what it understood reference to \\"the People\\" in the Preamble to mean. The Court has also understood this language to mean that the sovereignty of the government under the U.S. Constitution is superior to that of the States.Chisholm v. Georgia, 2 U.S. (2 Dall.) 419, 471 (1793) (opinion of Jay, C.J.) (\\"[I]n establishing [the Constitution], the people exercised their own rights, and their own proper sovereignty, and conscious of the plenitude of it, they declared with becoming dignity, 'We the people of the United States, do ordain and establish this Constitution.' Here we see the people acting as sovereigns of the whole country; and in the language of sovereignty, establishing a Constitution by which it was their will, that the State Governments should be bound, and to which the State Constitutions should be made to conform. Every State Constitution is a compact made by and between the citizens of a State to govern themselves in a certain manner; and the Constitution of the United States is likewise a compact made by the people of the United States to govern themselves as to general objects, in a certain manner.\\" (emphasis added)). abrogated by constitutional amendment, U.S. CONST. amend. XI, as recognized in Hollingsworth v. Virginia, 3 U.S. (3 Dall.) 378 (1798), and abrogated by Hans v. Louisiana, 134 U.S. 1, 12 (1890); see also United States v. Cathcart, 25 F. Cas. 344, 348 (C.C.S.D. Ohio 1864) (No. 14,756) (\\"[The Supreme Court has] den[ied] the assumption that full and unqualified sovereignty still remains in the states or the people of a state, and affirm[ed], on the contrary, that, by express words of the constitution, solemnly ratified by the people of the United States, the national government is supreme within the range of the powers delegated to it; while the states are sovereign only in the sense that they have an indisputable claim to the exercise of all the rights and powers guarantied to them by the constitution of the United States, or which are expressly or by fair implication reserved to them.\\"). Stated in negative terms, the Preamble has been interpreted as meaning that the Constitution was not the act of sovereign and independent states.See White v. Hart, 80 U.S. (13 Wall.) 646, 650 (1872) (\\"The National Constitution was, as its preamble recites, ordained and established by the people of the United States. It created not a confederacy of States, but a government of individuals.\\"); Martin v. Hunter's Lessee, 14 U.S. (1 Wheat.) 304, 324‚Äì25 (1816) (\\"The constitution of the United States was ordained and established, not by the states in their sovereign capacities, but . . . , as the preamble of the constitution declares, by 'the people of the United States.' . . . The constitution was not, therefore, necessarily carved out of existing state sovereignties, nor a surrender of powers already existing in state institutions . . . .\\"); cf. M'Culloch v. Maryland, 17 U.S. (4 Wheat.) 316, 402‚Äì03 (1819) (rejecting a construction of the Constitution that would interpret it \\"not as emanating from the people, but as the act of sovereign and independent states. The powers of the general government . . . are delegated by the states, who alone are truly sovereign; and must be exercised in subordination to the states, who alone possess supreme dominion;\\" instead, \\"the [Constitution] was submitted to the people. They acted upon it . . . by assembling in convention. . . . [It] d[id] not, on . . . account [of the ratifying conventions assembling in each state], cease to be the [action] of the people themselves, or become [an action] of the state governments.\\"). =The popular nature of the Constitution= The Constitution claims to be an act of \\"We the People.\\" However, because it represents a general social contract, there are limits on the ability of individual citizens to pursue legal claims allegedly arising out of the Constitution. For example, if a law were enacted which violated the Constitution, not just anybody could challenge the statute's constitutionality in court; instead, only an individual who was negatively affected by the unconstitutional statute could bring such a challenge.Ala. State Fed'n of Labor v. McAdory, 325 U.S. 450, 463 (1945) (\\"Only those to whom a statute applies and who are adversely affected by it can draw in question its constitutional validity in a declaratory judgment proceeding as in any other.\\"); Premier-Pabst Sales Co. v. Grosscup, 298 U.S. 226, 227 (1936) (\\"One who would strike down a state statute as obnoxious to the Federal Constitution must show that the alleged unconstitutional feature injures him.\\"); Buscaglia v. Fiddler, 157 F.2d 579, 581 (1st Cir. 1946) (\\"It is a settled principle of law that no court will consider the constitutionality of a statute unless the record before it affords an adequate factual basis for determining whether the challenged statute applies to and adversely affects the one who draws it in question.\\"); Liberty Nat'l Bank v. Collins, 58 N.E.2d 610, 614 (Ill. 1944) (\\"The rule is universal that no one can raise a question as to the constitutionality of a statute unless he is injuriously affected by the alleged unconstitutional provisions. It is an established rule in this State that one may not complain of the invalidity of a statutory provision which does not affect him. This court will not determine the constitutionality of the provisions of an act which do not affect the parties to the cause under consideration, or where the party urging the invalidity of such provisions is not in any way aggrieved by their operation.\\" (citation omitted)). For example, a person claiming certain benefits that are created by a statute cannot then challenge, on constitutional grounds, the administrative mechanism that awards them.See, e.g., Ison v. W. Vegetable Distribs., 59 P.2d 649, 655 (Ariz. 1936) (\\"It is the general rule of law that when a party invokes the benefit of a statute, he may not, in one and the same breath, claim a right granted by it and reject the terms upon which the right is granted.\\"); State ex rel. Sorensen v. S. Neb. Power Co., 268 N.W. 284, 285 (Neb. 1936) (\\"[In this case,] defendants . . . invoked the statute, . . . relied upon and t[ook] advantage of it, and are now estopped to assail the statute as unconstitutional.\\"). It is important not to read these too broadly. For example, in In re Auditor Gen., 266 N.W. 464 (Mich. 1936), certain property had been foreclosed upon for delinquent payment of taxes. A statute changed the terms by which foreclosure sales had to be published and announced in the community. The Michigan Supreme Court held that it was not necessary to question the validity of the taxes whose nonpayment led to the foreclosure, to have standing to question the validity of the procedure by which the foreclosure sale was being conducted. These same principles apply to corporate entities,E.g., Am. Power & Light Co. v. SEC, 329 U.S. 90, 107 (1946) (a claim that the Public Utility Holding Company Act of 1935 \\"is void in the absence of an express provision for notice and opportunity for hearing as to security holders regarding proceedings under that section [is groundless]. The short answer is that such a contention can be raised properly only by a security holder who has suffered injury due to lack of notice or opportunity for hearing. No security holder of that type is now before us. The management[] of American . . . admittedly w[as] notified and participated in the hearings . . . and . . . possess[es] no standing to assert the invalidity of that section from the viewpoint of the security holders' constitutional rights to notice and hearing\\"); Virginian Ry. Co. v. Sys. Fed'n No. 40, Ry. Employees Dep't, 300 U.S. 515, 558 (1937) (under the Railway Labor Act, a \\"railroad can complain only of the infringement of its own constitutional immunity, not that of its employees\\" (citations omitted)). and can implicate the doctrine of exhaustion of remedies.E.g., Anniston Mfg. Co. v. Davis, 301 U.S. 337, 353 (1937) (\\"Constitutional questions are not to be decided hypothetically. When particular facts control the decision they must be shown. Petitioner's contention as to impossibility of proof is premature. . . . For the present purpose it is sufficient to hold, and we do hold, that the petitioner may constitutionally be required to present all the pertinent facts in the prescribed administrative proceeding and may there raise, and ultimately may present for judicial review, any legal question which may arise as the facts are developed.\\" (citation omitted)). In this same vein, courts will not answer hypothetical questions about the constitutionality of a statute.United Pub. Workers v. Mitchell, 330 U.S. 75, 89‚Äì90 (1947) (\\"The power of courts, and ultimately of this Court, to pass upon the constitutionality of acts of Congress arises only when the interests of litigants require the use of this judicial authority for their protection against actual interference. A hypothetical threat is not enough.\\"). The judiciary does not have the authority to invalidate unconstitutional laws solely because they are unconstitutional, but may declare a law unconstitutional if its operation would injure a person's interests.Sparks v. Hart Coal Corp., 74 F.2d 697, 699 (6th Cir. 1934) (\\"It has long been settled that courts have no power per se to review and annul acts of Congress on the ground that they are unconstitutional. That question may be considered only when the justification for some direct injury suffered or threatened, presenting a justiciable issue, is made to rest upon such act.\\"); e.g., Manne v. Comm'r, 155 F.2d 304, 307 (8th Cir. 1946) (\\"A taxpayer alleging unconstitutionality of an act must show not only that the act is invalid, but that he has sustained some direct injury as the result of its enforcement.\\") (citing Massachusetts v. Mellon, 262 U.S. 447 (1923)). For example, creditors who lose some measure of what they are owed when a bankrupt's debts are discharged cannot claim injury, because Congress' power to enact bankruptcy laws is also in the Constitution and inherent in it is the ability to declare certain debts valueless.Kuehner v. Irving Trust Co., 299 U.S. 445, 452, 453 (1937) (\\"While, therefore, the Fifth Amendment forbids the destruction of a contract it does not prohibit bankruptcy legislation affecting the creditor's remedy for its enforcement against the debtor's assets, or the measure of the creditor's participation therein, if the statutory provisions are consonant with a fair, reasonable, and equitable distribution of those assets. The law under consideration recognizes the petitioners' claim and permits it to share in the consideration to be distributed in reorganization. . . . It is incorrect to say that Congress took away all remedy under the lease. On the contrary, it gave a new and more certain remedy for a limited amount, in lieu of an old remedy inefficient and uncertain in its result. This is certainly not the taking of the landlord's property without due process.\\"); In re 620 Church St. Bldg. Corp., 299 U.S. 24, 27 (1936) (\\"Here the controlling finding is not only that there was no equity in the property above the first mortgage but that petitioners' claims were appraised by the court as having 'no value.' There was no value to be protected. This finding . . . [renders] the constitutional argument [that petitioners were deprived of property without due process of law] unavailing as petitioners have not shown injury.\\"). Similarly, while a person may not generally challenge as unconstitutional a law that they are not accused of violating,Mauk v. United States, 88 F.2d 557, 559 (9th Cir. 1937) (\\"Since appellant is not indicted under or accused of violating this provision, he has no interest or standing to question its validity. That question is not before us and will not be considered.\\"). once charged, a person may challenge the law's validity, even if the challenge is unrelated to the circumstances of the crime.Morgan v. Virginia, 328 U.S. 373, 376‚Äì77 (1946) (person arrested for violating laws segregating buses was \\"a proper person to challenge the validity of th[e] statute as a burden on commerce\\"; even though she was a mere passenger and not, for example, a bus operator concerned about burdens on interstate commerce, \\"[i]f it is an invalid burden, the conviction under it would fail. The statute affects appellant as well as the transportation company. Constitutional protection against burdens on commerce is for her benefit on a criminal trial for violation of the challenged statute\\"). =Where the Constitution is legally effective= The Preamble has been used to confirm that the Constitution was made for, and is binding only in, the United States of America.Downes v. Bidwell, 182 U.S. 244, 251 (1901) (\\"The Constitution was created by the people of the United States, as a union of states, to be governed solely by representatives of the states.\\"); In re Ross, 140 U.S. 453, 464 (1891) (\\"By the constitution a government is ordained and established 'for the United States of America,' and not for countries outside of their limits. The guaranties it affords against accusation of capital or infamous crimes, except by indictment or presentment by a grand jury, and for an impartial trial by a jury when thus accused, apply only to citizens and others within the United States, or who are brought there for trial for alleged offenses committed elsewhere, and not to residents or temporary sojourners abroad.\\"). For example, in Casement v. Squier,46 F. Supp. 296 (W.D. Wash. 1942), aff'd, 138 F.2d 909 (9th Cir. 1943). a serviceman in China during World War II was convicted of murder in the United States Court for China. After being sent to prison in the State of Washington, he filed a writ of habeas corpus with the local federal court, claiming he had been unconstitutionally put on trial without a jury.Id. at 296 (\\"Upon his arraignment the [trial] court appointed counsel for the petitioner who was without funds and was a member of the armed forces of the United States at Shanghai. The petitioner entered a plea of not guilty and demanded a trial before a jury of Americans, which motion was denied, and he was thereupon tried by the court. The petitioner contends that his constitutional rights were violated by his being denied a jury trial.\\"). The court held that, since his trial was conducted by an American court and was, by American standards, basically fair, he was not entitled to the specific constitutional right of trial by jury while overseas.Id. at 299 (\\"The petitioner does not claim that he was not afforded a fair trial aside from the denial of his demand for a jury. Inasmuch as unquestionably he obtained a trial more to his liking than he would have obtained in Shanghai in other than an American court sitting in Shanghai, and since the Supreme Court of this country has determined that the right of trial by jury does not obtain in an American court sitting in another country pursuant to treaty, it must be held that the allegations of petitioner's petition do not entitle him to release.\\"). The Supreme Court held in 1901 that since the Preamble declares the Constitution to have been created by the \\"People of the United States\\", \\"there may be places within the jurisdiction of the United States that are no part of the Union.\\"Downes, 182 U.S. at 251 (emphases added). Compare, e.g., Dooley v. United States, 182 U.S. 222, 234 (1901) (\\"[A]fter the ratification of the treaty [with Spain] and the cession of the island to the United States[,] Porto Rico then ceased to be a foreign country . . . .\\"), and Municipality of Ponce v. Roman Catholic Apostolic Church, 210 U.S. 296, 310 (1908) (\\"[I]n case of cession to the United States; laws of the ceded country inconsistent with the Constitution and laws of the United States, so far as applicable, would cease to be of obligatory force; but otherwise the municipal laws of the acquired country continue.\\" (quoting Ortega v. Lara, 202 U.S. 339, 342 (1906))), with Downes, 182 U.S. at 287 (\\"[T]he island of Porto Rico is a territory appurtenant and belonging to the United States, but not a part of the United States . . . .\\"). The following examples help demonstrate the meaning of this distinction:The fact that this discussion happens to talk mainly about Puerto Rico should not be understood to imply that the Supreme Court held that Puerto Rico was some sort of sui generis jurisdiction. For example, in Goetze v. United States, , the Supreme Court held that this same reasoning (that a place could be under the jurisdiction of the United States, without being \\"part\\" of the United States) applied to Hawaii before it was admitted into the Union as a State. *Geofroy v. Riggs, : the Supreme Court held that a certain treaty between the United States and France which was applicable in \\"the States of the Union\\" was also applicable in Washington, D.C., even though it is not a state or a part of a state. *De Lima v. Bidwell, : the Supreme Court ruled that a customs collector could not, under a statute providing for taxes on imported goods, collect taxes on goods coming from Puerto Rico after it had been ceded to the United States from Spain, reasoning that although it was not a State, it was under the jurisdiction of U.S. sovereignty, and thus the goods were not being imported from a foreign country. However, in Downes v. Bidwell, , the Court held that the Congress could constitutionally enact a statute taxing goods sent from Puerto Rico to ports in the United States differently from other commerce, in spite of the constitutional requirement that \\"all Duties, Imposts and Excises shall be uniform throughout the United States,\\"U.S. CONST. art. I, ¬ß 8, cl. 1. on the theory that although Puerto Rico could not be treated as a foreign country, it did not count as part of the \\"United States\\" and thus was not guaranteed \\"uniform\\" tax treatment by that clause of the Constitution. This was not the only constitutional clause held not to apply in Puerto Rico: later, a lower court went on to hold that goods brought from Puerto Rico into New York before the enactment of the tax statute held constitutional in Downes, could retroactively have the taxes applied to them notwithstanding the Constitution's ban on ex post facto laws, even if at the time they were brought into the United States no tax could be applied to the goods because Puerto Rico was not a foreign country.De Pass v. Bidwell, 124 F. 615 (C.C.S.D.N.Y. 1903). *Ochoa v. Hernandez y Morales, : the Fifth Amendment's requirement that \\"no person shall . . . be deprived of . . . property, without due process of law\\" was held, by the Supreme Court, to apply in Puerto Rico, even though it was not a State and thus not \\"part\\" of the United States. =To form a more perfect Union= The phrase \\"to form a more perfect Union\\" has been construed as referring to the shift to the Constitution from the Articles of Confederation.See United States v. Cruikshank, 92 U.S. 542, 549‚Äì50 (1876) (\\"The separate governments of the separate States, bound together by the articles of confederation alone, were not sufficient for the promotion of the general welfare of the people in respect to foreign nations, or for their complete protection as citizens of the confederated States. For this reason, the people of the United States . . . ordained and established the government of the United States, and defined its powers by a constitution, which they adopted as its fundamental law . . . .\\" (emphasis added)); Texas v. White, 74 U.S. (7 Wall.) 700, 724‚Äì25 (1869) (\\"[The Union, which had existed since colonial times,] received definite form, and character, and sanction from the Articles of Confederation. By these the Union was solemnly declared to 'be perpetual.' And when these Articles were found to be inadequate to the exigencies of the country, the Constitution was ordained 'to form a more perfect Union.'\\"), overruled on other grounds by Morgan v. United States, 113 U.S. 476 (1885); Martin v. Hunter's Lessee, 14 U.S. (1 Wheat.) 304, 332 (1816) (\\"The constitution was for a new government, organized with new substantive powers, and not a mere supplementary charter to a government already existing.\\"). The contemporaneous meaning of the word \\"perfect\\" was complete, finished, fully informed, confident, or certain. The phrase has been interpreted in various ways throughout history based on the context of the times. For example, shortly after the Civil War and the ratification of the Fourteenth Amendment, the Supreme Court said that the \\"Union\\" was made \\"more perfect\\" by the creation of a federal government with enough power to act directly upon citizens, rather than a government with narrowly limited power that could act on citizens only indirectly through the states, e.g., by imposing taxes.See Lane Cnty. v. Oregon, 74 U.S. (7 Wall.) 71, 76 (1869) (\\"The people, through [the Constitution], established a more perfect union by substituting a national government, acting, with ample power, directly upon the citizens, instead of the Confederate government, which acted with powers, greatly restricted, only upon the States.\\"). Also, the institution was created as a government over the States and people, not an agreement (union) between the States.Legal Tender Cases, 79 U.S. (12 Wall.) 457, 545 (1871) (\\"The Constitution was intended to frame a government as distinguished from a league or compact, a government supreme in some particulars over States and people.\\"); id. at 554‚Äì55 (Bradley, J., concurring) (\\"The Constitution of the United States established a government, and not a league, compact, or partnership. It was constituted by the people. It is called a government.\\"). In the 21st century, following a pivotal, widely reported speech entitled \\"A More Perfect Union\\" by then-candidate Barack Obama in 2008, the phrase has also come to mean the continual process of improvement of the country. The phrase has also been interpreted to support the federal supremacy clause as well as to demonstrate that state nullification of any federal law,See Bush v. Orleans Parish Sch. Bd., 188 F. Supp. 916, 922‚Äì23 (E.D. La. 1960) (\\"Interposition is . . . based on the proposition that the United States is a compact of states, any one of which may interpose its sovereignty against the enforcement within its borders of any decision of the Supreme Court or act of Congress, irrespective of the fact that the constitutionality of the act has been established by decision of the Supreme Court. . . . In essence, the doctrine denies the constitutional obligation of the states to respect those decisions of the Supreme Court with which they do not agree. The doctrine may have had some validity under the Articles of Confederation. On their failure, however, 'in Order to form a more perfect Union,' the people, not the states, of this country ordained and established the Constitution. Thus the keystone of the interposition thesis, that the United States is a compact of states, was disavowed in the Preamble to the Constitution.\\" (emphasis added) (footnote omitted) (citation omitted)), aff'd mem., 365 U.S. 569 (1961). Although the State of Louisiana in Bush invoked a concept it called \\"interposition,\\" it was sufficiently similar to the concept of \\"nullification\\" that the court used the latter, more familiar term in a fashion that clearly indicated it viewed the concepts as functionally interchangeable. See id. at 923 n.7 (\\"[E]ven the 'compact theory' [of the Constitution] does not justify interposition. Thus, Edward Livingston, . . . though an adherent of th[e 'compact] theory['], strongly denied the right of a state to nullify federal law or the decisions of the federal courts.\\" (emphases added)). Compare Martin, 14 U.S. (1 Wheat.) at 332 (\\"The confederation was a compact between states; and its structure and powers were wholly unlike those of the national government.\\"), with id. (\\"The constitution was an act of the people of the United States to supersede the confederation, and not to be ingrafted on it, as a stock through which it was to receive life and nourishment.\\"). dissolution of the Union,White v. Hart, 80 U.S. (13 Wall.) 646, 650 (1871) (\\"[The Constitution] assumed that the government and the Union which it created, and the States which were incorporated into the Union, would be indestructible and perpetual; and as far as human means could accomplish such a work, it intended to make them so.\\") or secession from it,Texas, 74 U.S. (7 Wall.) at 725‚Äì26 (\\"[W]hen the[] Articles [of Confederation] were found to be inadequate to the exigencies of the country, the Constitution was ordained 'to form a more perfect Union.' It is difficult to convey the idea of indissoluble unity more clearly than by these words. What can be indissoluble if a perpetual Union, made more perfect, is not? . . . The Constitution, in all its provisions, looks to an indestructible Union, composed of indestructible States. When, therefore, Texas became one of the United States, she entered into an indissoluble relation. All the obligations of perpetual union, and all the guaranties of republican government in the Union, attached at once to the State. The act which consummated her admission into the Union was something more than a compact; it was the incorporation of a new member into the political body. And it was final. The union between Texas and the other States was as complete, as perpetual, and as indissoluble as the union between the original States.

The second son and successor of hotelier Conrad Hilton, he was the chairman, president and chief executive officer of Hilton Hotels Corporation and chairman emeritus of the Conrad N. Hilton Foundation. Hilton, a notable pilot and outdoorsman, was also a founder of the American Football League as the original owner of the Los Angeles Chargers, and helped forge the merger with the National Football League that created the Super Bowl. Like his father before him, he pledged 97 percent of his wealth to the humanitarian work of the Conrad N. Hilton Foundation.\\"Barron Hilton to Donate 97% of Estate to Hilton Foundation\\". Planned Giving Design Center, LLC. December 26, 2007. Retrieved April 2, 2011. At the time, the gift was projected to increase the foundation's endowment from $2.9 billion to $6.3 billion,Haggerty, James R., \\"Hilton Founder's Son Sought His Own Path,\\" Wall Street Journal, 2019-9-21, p. A6 and will make his estate the organization's most significant donor.  Early life  Hilton was born in Dallas, Texas, to Mary Adelaide (n√©e Barron) and Conrad Nicholson Hilton, founder of Hilton Hotels. Hilton grew up with three siblings, Conrad Nicholson Hilton, Jr., Eric Michael Hilton, and Constance Francesca Hilton. His father was of Norwegian and German descent and from New Mexico while his mother was from Kentucky. He served in the Navy during World War II as a photographer. As a child, Hilton was fascinated by aviation, and learned to fly when he was 17. After his wartime discharge, he attended the University of Southern California Aeronautical School, where he earned his twin-engine rating at age 19.  Early career, Los Angeles Chargers  Before joining his father in the hotel industry, Barron Hilton honed his business skills in a variety of entrepreneurial ventures. He acquired the Los Angeles-area distributorship of Vita-Pakt Citrus Products, co-founded MacDonald Oil Company, and founded Air Finance Corporation, one of the nation's first aircraft leasing businesses. In 1954, Barron was elected vice president of Hilton Hotels, running the company's franchise operations and creating the Carte Blanche credit card as a service to the company's customers. In 1959, Lamar Hunt offered Hilton the Los Angeles franchise in the new American Football League (AFL). Hilton named his team the Chargers, but denied that he did it to create synergy with his new credit card business. A fan had nominated the name in a contest, and Hilton selected it because of the bugle call and \\"Charge!\\" cheer that was often sounded during USC football games at the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum. The Chargers began playing at the Coliseum in 1960, but in spite of winning the Western Division, the club found it difficult to compete for fans with the Rams of the National Football League (NFL) in their own stadium. Hilton moved the team to San Diego in time for the 1961 season and played in tiny Balboa Stadium, which the city had expanded to 30,000 seats. Hilton began working with the local newspapers to engender support for construction of a state-of- the-art stadium. Encouraged by San Diego Union sports editor Jack Murphy, among others, a referendum was passed in 1965, and the Chargers began play in the new San Diego Stadium in 1967. With the availability of a new stadium, the city received a baseball expansion franchise from the National League, and the San Diego Padres began play in 1969. It was named Jack Murphy Stadium after Murphy's death in 1980, and is now known as SDCCU Stadium. Hilton also served as AFL president in 1965, and helped forge the merger between the AFL and the NFL, announced in 1966, which created the Super Bowl. In all, the Chargers won five divisional titles, and one AFL Championship, during Hilton's six years at the helm of the club. In 1966, directors of Hilton Hotels Corporation asked Hilton to succeed his father as president and chief executive officer of the company, provided that he drop his football responsibilities. He sold his majority interest in the team for $10 million‚Äîa record for any professional sports franchise at the time‚Äîafter an initial investment in a franchise fee of just $25,000. With the death of the Bills' Ralph Wilson in 2014, Hilton became the last surviving member of the Foolish Club‚Äîthe nickname the original AFL owners gave each other, as they absorbed the start-up expenses and player salaries necessary to compete with the established NFL. Hilton Hotels Once charged with the responsibility for Hilton Hotels Corporation, Barron Hilton soon showed his father's genius for cost controls and real estate deals. In 1970, he convinced the board to expand into Las Vegas by purchasing the International and the Flamingo from financier Kirk Kerkorian. Hilton Hotels thus became the first company listed on the New York Stock Exchange to venture into the gaming market. Renamed the Las Vegas Hilton and the Flamingo Hilton, the two resorts tapped a new source of income from gambling in a state where it had been legal since 1931. Barron could also see that Las Vegas would become a leading convention destination, capitalizing on the company's strength in that important market segment.Hilton Hotels Corporation, 1970 Annual Report, pp. 12‚Äì16 Hilton personally introduced two innovations that have become standard features of casinos everywhere. Calling on his background in photography, he installed video cameras throughout the casinos to replace the \\"eye in the sky\\" system of observers peering through two-way mirrors in the ceiling. Las Vegas would also become the self-proclaimed \\"Entertainment Capital of the World\\". Of all the headliners to perform at the Hilton or the Flamingo, the most successful and spectacular was Elvis Presley. After a decade in the movies, he began performing in front of live audiences again in 1969 at the opening of the International (a few years later renamed the Las Vegas Hilton). He went on to star at the Las Vegas Hilton two months a year‚Äîperforming two shows a night, seven nights a week‚Äîuntil shortly before his death in 1977. Presley set a world entertainment record at the Las Vegas Hilton for selling out 837 consecutive concerts. The company's expansion into Nevada had an immediate impact on its net income. By 1972, the two resorts contributed 45 percent of the company's income (before interest income, interest expense, write down of investments and sales of properties), nearly matching the income from the other 160 Hilton hotels in the United States.Hilton Hotels Corporation, 1973 Annual Report, p. 2 On the hotel front, in 1975, Hilton sold a 50 percent interest in six of the company's largest hotels to Prudential Insurance Company for $83 million. He took a leaseback to manage the properties, collecting lucrative management fees and a percentage of their gross profits. Perhaps more importantly, the sale proved that these hotels were worth double their book value, demonstrating the underlying value of the company's real estate holdings.Hilton Hotels Corporation, 1976 Annual Report, p. 5 The transaction also enhanced the value of the stock held by every HHC shareholder. Hilton used the proceeds to pay down high interest debt, and repurchase 20 percent of the company's stock‚Äîall at market rate‚Äîwhich was still trading well below the company's book value.Hilton Hotels Corporation, 1975 Annual Report, p. 4 Hilton continued to expand the domestic hotel chain through franchising and the selective acquisition of management contracts and hotels in emerging markets. In 1977, he completed a hotel purchase that his father had initiated 28 years earlier. When Conrad Hilton bought the Waldorf-Astoria in 1949, he actually bought the hotel's operating company and its 30-year lease to run the hotel. The building, and the land under it, were still owned by the realty arm of the Penn Central Railroad. Knowing that the lease would expire in 1979, Hilton deftly negotiated to buy the hotel and real estate from the railroad. The landmark property, whose current value is estimated around $1 billion, was purchased by Hilton for just $35 million.Hilton Hotels Corporation, 1976 Annual Report, p. 3 As competitors aggressively spread across the U.S. in the '80s, Barron held his own by rehabbing his own hotels and increasing revenues in Las Vegas. Through a series of massive additions to the Flamingo Hilton and the Las Vegas Hilton, the company nearly tripled its rooms in Las Vegas by 1990, from 2,277 to 6,703. He also launched Conrad International in the '80s,Hilton Hotels Corporation, 1990 Annual Report, p. 7 and Hilton Garden Inn in the '90s.Hilton Hotels Corporation, 1996 Annual Report, p. 5 In contrast to his gamble on gaming, Hilton earned a well-deserved reputation as a financial conservative. After seeing his father struggle to overcome the effects of the American Great Depression and World War II, he maintained the strongest balance sheet in the industry. Throughout his 30 years as CEO, he carried a low debt-to-capital ratio and a high credit rating, enabling him to gobble up such properties as Bally's Reno (formerly the MGM Grand Hotel and Casino-Reno). The 2,000-room resort was opened in 1978 for $230 million, and purchased by Hilton in 1992 for $88 million. With strong cash flow and plenty of liquid investments on hand, he was able to weather the inevitable recessions and business interruptions that struck the industry from the mid-'60s to the mid-'90s.Hilton Hotels Corporation 1992 Annual Report, pp. 3‚Äì4 Hilton continued as chairman of the board through the next decade as his hand-picked successor, Steve Bollenbach, dramatically expanded the company through a series of mergers and acquisitions. The advent of friendly capital markets in the late '90s enabled him to acquire such popular brands as Embassy Suites, Doubletree, Hampton Inn, Homewood Suites, Bally's and Caesars.Hilton Hotels Corporation, 1999 Annual Report, p. 2 Then, in 2005, he reacquired Hilton International, 38 years after it had been sold to TWA. With the company now strategically complete, Bollenbach spun off the gaming business, which merged with Harrah's in 2005 and was renamed Caesars Entertainment. In the meantime, the hotel business continued to soar. With the best known and most respected name in the industry‚Äîand popular domestic brands ripe for expansion overseas‚ÄîHilton Hotels Corporation proved to be irresistible to The Blackstone Group. In 2007, the private equity firm purchased Hilton Hotels Corporation, consisting of 2,800 hotels with 480,000 rooms in 76 countries and territories. Blackstone paid $47.50 per share, a 32 percent premium over the July 2 closing price. The $26 billion, all-cash transaction included $7.5 billion of debt. Host Hotels & Resorts veteran Chris Nassetta was hired to manage the company, which was renamed Hilton Worldwide, Inc. and is now known as Hilton, Inc. Now celebrating the 100th year since Conrad Hilton purchased his first hotel, the company has expanded to include 17 brands, 5,800 hotels, and 939,000 rooms in 114 countries of the world. With another 373,000 rooms in the development pipeline.  Hilton family fortune  In 1979, Barron Hilton's father, Conrad Hilton, died at age 91. He left 13.5 million shares of Hilton Hotels Corporation stock‚Äî97 percent of his estate‚Äîto the Conrad N. Hilton Foundation, a humanitarian charity which he had established in 1944. In his will, Conrad also gave Barron the right to purchase those shares in order to maintain family control of the company, but the foundation challenged the option in probate court. It took an entire decade to resolve the issue. Hilton's right to exercise his option was upheld in an appeals court ruling in March 1988, giving him voting power over roughly 34 percent of the company's outstanding shares. Conrad's bequest of stock was worth $160 million when he died in 1979. Thanks to his son's successful management of the Hilton Hotels Corporation, those shares were worth $654 million when the settlement was reached late in 1988. In a press statement issued after the favorable ruling, Hilton said it gave him \\"the opportunity to structure an arrangement whereby my father's two objectives, retaining control of the stock in family hands, and benefiting charity through the Conrad N. Hilton Foundation, can both be achieved. I am confident that my father would be pleased with this accord.\\" The settlement was finalized in 1989. Neither Hilton, nor the foundation, had to actually pay for the shares; they split them instead. Hilton received 4 million shares, the Conrad N. Hilton Foundation received 3.5 million shares, and the remaining 6 million shares were placed in the W. Barron Hilton Charitable remainder unitrust, of which Barron was the executor. He received 60 percent of the unitrust income, and the foundation 40 percent, during his lifetime, then the fund would transfer to the foundation. On December 25, 2007, Hilton announced that he would follow in his father's footsteps by leaving about 97 percent of his estate, estimated at that time to be $2.3 billion, to the Conrad N. Hilton Foundation. Included was an immediate pledge of $1.2 billion, the proceeds of the sale of Hilton Hotels Corporation and Harrah's Entertainment Inc., which was placed in a charitable remainder unitrust that would be transferred to the foundation upon Hilton's death at whatever value the trust was worth at that time. The remainder of the funds that constitute Hilton's pledge of 97 percent of his estate will come from his personal assets, which were estimated at $1.1 billion at the time. Conrad N. Hilton Foundation Throughout his career, Conrad Hilton supported a variety of causes, particularly those involving the nuns that had helped educate him in his native New Mexico. He established the Conrad N. Hilton Foundation in 1944, and made a total of $7.6 million of gifts before his death. In his last will and testament, Conrad left general guidance for the use of his endowment. He wrote: \\"There is a natural law, a Divine law, that obliges you and me to relieve the suffering, the distressed and the destitute. Charity is a supreme virtue, and the great channel through which the mercy of God is passed on to mankind. It is the virtue that unites men and inspires their noblest efforts. 'Love one another, for that is the whole law;' so our fellow men deserve to be loved and encouraged‚Äînever abandoned to wander alone in poverty and darkness. The practice of charity will bind us‚Äîwill bind all men in one great brotherhood. As the funds you will expend have come from many places in the world, so let there be no territorial, religious, or color restrictions on your benefactions, but beware of organized, professional charities with high-salaried executives and a heavy ratio of expense. Be ever watchful for the opportunity to shelter little children with the umbrella of your charity; be generous to their schools, their hospitals and their places of worship. For, as they must bear the burdens of our mistakes, so are they in their innocence the repositories of our hopes for the upward progress of humanity. Give aid to their protectors and defenders, the Sisters, who devote their love and life's work for the good of mankind, for they appeal especially to me as being deserving of help from the Foundation.\\" Aviation career Hilton was born the year Charles Lindbergh flew the Spirit of St. Louis across the Atlantic. When he was 7 or 8 years old, he would ride his bike to Love Field in Dallas to watch the exotic planes of the day take off and land. He promised himself that he would one day learn to fly. He took private flying lessons at a field on the north shore of Oahu during his time in the Navy, and got his pilot's license at age 17. In addition to his single-engine and multi- engine ratings, Hilton eventually earned glider, lighter than air (balloons) and helicopter ratings as well. He maintained a small fleet of aircraft at his Flying M Ranch east of the sierras in northern Nevada that includes sailplanes, tow planes, aerobatic aircraft, hot air balloons and classic, restored biplanes. He flew them all until he retired from the cockpit in 2012 at age 84. In the '90s, he boldly backed the first attempts to capture one of the last great milestones in aviation‚Äîflying non-stop around the world in a balloon‚Äîwith the Earthwinds Hilton and Global Hilton campaigns. While falling short of the ultimate goal, Hilton is credited with inspiring the efforts of those who achieved the feat. Bertrand Piccard and Brian Jones were the first to make a trans-global flight in 1999; Steve Fossett became the first to complete the flight solo in 2002. From 1980 to 2009, he also hosted the Barron Hilton Cup, a unique, worldwide glider competition. Pilots who flew the longest triangular flights during each two-year period in six regions of the world earned participation in a weeklong soaring camp at his Flying M Ranch. Co-founder Helmut Reichmann, Germany's three-time world soaring champion, devised a handicap system that enabled pilots flying older gliders to compete with elite pilots in high-performance aircraft of the latest design. Once at the Flying M, they flew recreationally alongside world champions and celebrities invited to attend by Hilton. Beginning in 1996 with its predecessors, the European Aeronautic Defence and Space Co., EADS, had served as a partner in the event. Over the years, a number of notable pilots regularly joined Hilton for weekends at the Flying M. They include entertainers John Denver and Cliff Robertson; astronauts Neil Armstrong, Gene Cernan, Bill Anders, and Ulf Merbold; and test pilots and record-holders Johnny Myers, Clay Lacy, Bruno Gantenbrink, Bob Hoover, Carroll Shelby, Sully Sullenberger, and air, sea and land adventurer, Steve Fossett. On Labor Day, 2007, Fossett took off from the Flying M Ranch and never returned, perishing in a crash in the Sierras. In spite of an intensive search, the wreckage wasn't discovered until the following spring. The National Transportation Safety Board determined the probable cause(s) of this accident to be \\"the pilot's inadvertent encounter with downdrafts that exceeded the climb capability of the airplane. Contributing to the accident were the downdrafts, high density altitude, and mountainous terrain.\\" Examination of the airframe and engine revealed no evidence of any malfunctions or failures that would have prevented normal operation. The Smithsonian National Air & Space Museum honored Hilton in 2010 by christening the Barron Hilton Pioneers of Flight Gallery. The redesigned exhibit recognizes aviators like Lindbergh, Amelia Earhart and the Tuskeegee Airmen. The gallery includes an early childhood education component funded by the Hilton Foundation to help youngsters catch the same enthusiasm for aviation that he discovered as a child when Lindbergh and Earhart were making headlines. In 2012, Barron was inducted into the International Air & Space Hall of Fame at the San Diego Air & Space Museum.Sprekelmeyer, Linda, editor. These We Honor: The International Aerospace Hall of Fame. Donning Co. Publishers, 2006. . For his lifelong support of aviation, Hilton received the prestigious FAI Gold Air Medal from the F√©d√©ration A√©ronautique Internationale in 2009, the same award bestowed upon some of his closest friends and personal heroes, like Yeager, Armstrong, Cernan, Jones, Fossett, and Lindbergh himself. In 2012, Hilton was also inducted into the International Air & Space Hall of Fame in San Diego, and was hailed as the \\"patron saint of sport aviation.\\"  Personal life  In 1947, Barron Hilton married Marilyn June Hawley; they remained married until she died in 2004. They had eight children: William Barron Hilton, Jr.; Hawley Anne Hilton; Stephen Michael Hilton; David Alan Hilton; Sharon Constance Hilton; Richard Howard Hilton; Daniel Kevin Hilton; and Ronald Jeffrey Hilton; William Barron Hilton, Jr. was born in 1948 and Ronald Jeffrey Hilton was born in 1963. Barron Hilton had 15 grandchildren, including Richard Hilton's daughters Paris Hilton and Nicky Hilton Rothschild, and four great-grandchildren. His primary residence in Holmby Hills was the Jay Paley House, originally designed in the 1930s for Jay Paley by architect Paul Williams. It was used as the 'Colby mansion' in exterior scenes for The Colbys television series. He also maintained a permanent suite in New York's Waldorf, and a 475,000-acre ranch called Flying M stretching across Nevada & California state lines. The ranch included an airport and a two-hole putting green. Hilton died of natural causes at his home in Los Angeles on September 19, 2019. Other Hilton was a member of a duck club on Venice Island in the Sacramento ‚Äì San Joaquin River Delta near Stockton in Northern California. Every year he put on a large Fourth of July fireworks display, attracting thousands of boaters to watch it. Hilton and several friends purchased the Flying-M Ranch in Lyon County, Nevada in the mid-1960s, and he bought the others out in 1972.Freeze, Di (2013). \\"In the Cockpit with Barron Hilton\\".

Born in Austin, Texas, he began his Negro League career late in 1922 with the Kansas City Monarchs and, except for brief stints with other teams in 1931 and 1932, stayed with the Monarchs until his retirement in 1948. Long known for his leadership ability, he became the Monarchs' manager in 1941 when Andy Cooper suffered a pre-season stroke and died during the season. He won the Negro American League championship that season, but resigned as manager just before the beginning of the following season, resuming his duties as a reserve infielder. Allen's accomplishments as a player were even more impressive. A master at scoring runs, he bunted, stole bases and almost always provided the spark his team needed to win. Among the fastest baserunners of his generation of Negro Leaguers, his most remarkable season was his 1929 campaign, in which he batted .330 while hitting 24 doubles and stealing 23 bases in a typically abbreviated Negro League season. Like the comparable Judy Johnson, he was a remarkable fielder, arguably the best fielding second baseman of any race from the 1920s through the 1940s, and was at his best in pressure situations. Unlike Johnson, Newt Allen is not in the Hall of Fame, although many experts regard him as having been superior to many white inductees. Allen did make the list of 39 finalists for the 2006 special Negro Leagues and Pre-Negro Leagues Election, but was not one of the 17 finally chosen.

Career Neumann was born in Berlin to a Jewish family. He received his PhD in Philosophy from the University of Erlangen-Nuremberg in 1927 and then continued to study medicine at the University of Berlin, where he acquired his first degree in medicine in 1933. In 1934 Neumann and his wife Julia, who had been Zionists since they were teenagers, moved to Tel Aviv. For many years, he regularly returned to Z√ºrich, Switzerland to give lectures at the C. G. Jung Institute. He also lectured frequently in England, France and the Netherlands, and was a member of the International Association for Analytical Psychology and president of the Israel Association of Analytical Psychologists. He practiced analytical psychology in Tel Aviv from 1934 until his death from kidney cancer in 1960. Contributions Neumann contributed to the field of developmental psychology and the psychology of consciousness and creativity. He had a theoretical and philosophical approach to analysis, contrasting with the more clinical concern in England and the United States. His most valuable contribution to psychology was the empirical concept of \\"centroversion\\", a synthesis of extra- and introversion. However, he is best known for his theory of feminine development, a theory formulated in numerous publications, most notably The Great Mother. His works also elucidate the way mythology throughout history reveals aspects of the development of consciousness that are parallel in both the individual and society as a whole. Works His most enduring contributions to Jungian thought are The Origins and History of Consciousness (1949) and The Great Mother (1955). Another work, Depth Psychology and a New Ethic, reflects on human destructiveness and the way the human mind relates to its own shadow. Neumann further developed his studies in feminine archetypes in his Art and the Creative Unconscious, The Fear of the Feminine, and Amor and Psyche. Neumann also wrote poetry, a novel called The Beginning (Der Anfang), and in 1932 conducted a critical study of Franz Kafka's works at a time when Kafka was still a minor figure in the literary world.

He is a member of the Democratic Party. As a child of immigrants from Taiwan, Wu was the first Taiwanese American to serve in the House of Representatives. Wu announced that he would resign from office following resolution of the 2011 debt ceiling crisis; he submitted his resignation on August 3, 2011. A special election was held on January 31, 2012, to fill the vacancy in advance of the regular 2012 election. Democrat Suzanne Bonamici defeated Republican challenger Rob Cornilles to win this special election. Since his resignation, Wu has remained in the Washington, D.C. area. He has been raising money for local Democratic parties, and organizing student exchange programs between the Chinese and American space programs. According to a 2014 report, he still frequents the House offices, where he visits with friends, sometimes sits in on hearings and even goes onto the House floor. Early life and education Wu was born in Hsinchu, Taiwan. His parents were from Suzhou in Jiangsu province and settled in Taiwan due to the Chinese Civil War. The family moved to the United States in 1961. Wu spent his first two years in the U.S. in Latham, New York, where his family were the only Asian Americans in town. Wu received a bachelor of science degree in biology from Stanford University in 1977 and attended Harvard Medical School for a time, sharing an apartment with future-United States Senator Bill Frist.www.NationalJournal.com Wu did not complete his medical studies. Instead, he attended Yale Law School where he was awarded a Juris Doctor degree in 1982. Law career Wu served as a clerk for a federal judge. In 1984, he joined the Miller Nash law firm. In 1988, he co-founded the law firm of Cohen & Wu. The firm focused on representing clients in Oregon's high-tech development sector, centered on \\"Silicon Forest.\\" U.S. Congressman Elections Wu was first elected to the U.S. House of Representatives in 1998, succeeding Democrat Elizabeth Furse. He narrowly defeated Republican Molly Bordonaro by a little over 7,100 votes. He won re-election in 2000, defeating state senator Charles Starr in the November election with 58% of the vote to 39% for Starr.2000 U.S. House of Representatives Results. U.S. Federal Election Commission. Retrieved April 7, 2008. Redistricting after the 2000 census made the 1st considerably more Democratic, notably by adding a small portion of Multnomah County. Wu won re-election in 2004 over Republican Goli Ameri; in 2006 over Oregon state representative Derrick Kitts and two minor party candidates; and in 2008 with no Republican candidate running, he captured 72% of the vote to win a sixth term over four minor party candidates. He faced his most difficult reelection test in 2010, defeating Republican challenger Rob Cornilles with 54% of the vote. Tenure  Official portrait, 2007 Wu was a member of the New Democrat Coalition (NDC), a group of moderate Democrats in the House. In 2009, he received a 100 percent rating from NARAL Pro-Choice America. He was also a member of the Executive Board for the Congressional Asian Pacific American Caucus and served as Chair from January 2001 to January 2004. Wu funded virus research at the Oregon Health and Science University that may be the first effective treatment and vaccine for AIDS. He authored legislation to promote research and product development by small businesses using a portion of federal research grants. Wu was a staunch supporter of science and research at both the basic and applied levels. In the House, Wu was known for taking a strong stand on human rights and the rule of law, sometimes at the risk of his own seat. He opposed granting Most Favored Nation (MFN) trading status to China (renamed later as \\"Normal Trade Relations\\"), citing human rights violations and predicting that the trade deficit with China would balloon under the legislation. The two largest employers in his Congressional District, Nike and Intel, strongly supported granting MFN status to China. He favored closing the detention center at Guantanamo Bay, citing rule of law concerns. Wu was a strong advocate for NASA and the space program. He served on the House Science Committee, which has jurisdiction over NASA, and on its Space Subcommittee, then chaired by Congresswoman Gabby Giffords. Wu defended NASA's budget and advocated for NASA goals for space exploration that are not subject to political influence. He viewed student interest in space as a way to promote STEM education, and founded a space camp scholarship program for underprivileged children. Wu continued this effort after he left Congress, and also started a program to send American students to China to learn about its space program. Chinese students were also included in order to promote international cooperation in space. Perhaps Wu's most enduring legacy is his successful effort with his Washington State colleague Brian Baird to create the Lewis and Clark National Historic Park located at the mouth of the Columbia River. He expanded the Fort Clatsop National Memorial in 2002 and incorporated it into an expanded park in 2004. Resignation On July 22, 2011, The Oregonian reported that an 18-year-old woman left a voicemail at Wu's campaign office accusing him of an unwanted sexual encounter. The woman is the daughter of a longtime friend and campaign donor. Wu acknowledged the encounter and said it was consensual. House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi called for an ethics investigation into the allegations. Wu initially indicated that he would not resign but would also not seek reelection in 2012. Several days later, however, Wu announced he would resign following resolution of the 2011 US debt ceiling crisis. He resigned on August 3, 2011.

Peter DeFazio. He also attends the annual Congressional Baseball Game, sometimes sits in on hearings and even occasionally ventures onto the House floor, a privilege he is allowed as a former member. Under the terms of his divorce, Wu explained to BuzzFeed, he must live in the Washington area until his daughter and son have finished high school. His income primarily comes from consulting for Chinese companies seeking to do business in the U.S.; he is also sometimes quoted in the Chinese media about issues such as the Senkaku Islands dispute (he supports China's claim to sovereignty over the islands, currently administered by Japan). Wu is also treasurer of the Education and Opportunity Fund, a political action committee that supports county-level Democratic committees. At the time of BuzzFeed's article, he was trying to organize a student exchange program to allow Chinese and American students to tour the other country's space-program facilities, an exception to the prohibition on cooperation that otherwise exists. He said he eventually intended to return to Oregon. Personal life Wu married Michelle Reinmiller in 1996, and they have two children. In December 2009, he filed for separation from his wife, citing irreconcilable differences, and is now divorced. Previously living in Portland, Oregon, Wu lives in the Washington DC area with his son and daughter.

It is commonplace in wooden buildings through the 19th century. If the structural frame of load-bearing timber is left exposed on the exterior of the building it may be referred to as half-timbered, and in many cases the infill between timbers will be used for decorative effect. The country most known for this kind of architecture is Germany. Timber framed houses are spread all over the country except in the southeast. The method comes from working directly from logs and trees rather than pre-cut dimensional lumber. Hewing this with broadaxes, adzes, and draw knives and using hand-powered braces and augers (brace and bit) and other woodworking tools, artisans or framers could gradually assemble a building. Since this building method has been used for thousands of years in many parts of the world, many styles of historic framing have developed. These styles are often categorized by the type of foundation, walls, how and where the beams intersect, the use of curved timbers, and the roof framing details. Box frame A simple timber frame made of straight vertical and horizontal pieces with a common rafter roof without purlins. The term box frame is not well defined and has been used for any kind of framing (with the usual exception of cruck framing). The distinction presented here is that the roof load is carried by the exterior walls. Purlins are also found even in plain timber frames. Cruck frame A \\"true\\" or \\"full\\" cruck half-timbered building in Weobley, Herefordshire, England: The cruck blades are the tall, curved timbers which extend from near the ground to the ridge. A cruck is a pair of crooked or curved timbersOxford English Dictionary which form a bent (U.S.) or crossframe (UK); the individual timbers are each called a blade. More than 4,000 cruck frame buildings have been recorded in the UK. Several types of cruck frames are used; more information follows in English style below and at the main article Cruck. * True cruck or full cruck: blades, straight or curved, extend from ground or foundation to the ridge acting as the principal rafters. A full cruck does not need a tie beam. * Base cruck: tops of the blades are truncated by the first transverse member such as by a tie beam. * Raised cruck: blades land on masonry wall, and extend to the ridge. * Middle cruck: blades land on masonry wall, and are truncated by a collar. * Upper cruck: blades land on a tie beam, very similar to knee rafters. * Jointed cruck: blades are made from pieces joined near eaves in a number of ways. See also: hammerbeam roof * End cruck is not a style, but on the gable end of a building.

These interior posts typically carry more structural load than the posts in the exterior walls. This is the same concept of the aisle in church buildings, sometimes called a hall church, where the center aisle is technically called a nave. However, a nave is often called an aisle, and three-aisled barns are common in the U.S., the Netherlands, and Germany. Aisled buildings are wider than the simpler box-framed or cruck-framed buildings, and typically have purlins supporting the rafters. In northern Germany, this construction is known as variations of a St√§nderhaus. Half- timbering Half-timbered wall with three kinds of infill, wattle and daub, brick, and stone: The plaster coating which originally covered the infill and timbers is mostly gone. This building is in the central German city of Bad Langensalza. Kr√§merbr√ºcke in Erfurt, Germany, with half-timbered buildings dating from c. 1480 Half-timbering refers to a structure with a frame of load- bearing timber, creating spaces between the timbers called panels (in German Gefach or F√§cher), which are then filled-in with some kind of nonstructural material known as infill. The frame is often left exposed on the exterior of the building.Nikolas Davies, Erkki Jokiniemi: 2008. Dictionary of architecture and building construction. Architectural Press. . 726 pages: pp 181 Infill materials The earliest known type of infill, called opus craticum by the Romans, was a wattle and daub type construction.Vitruvious, De Architectura, Book II, Chapter 8, paragraph 20 Opus craticum is now confusingly applied to a Roman stone/mortar infill as well. Similar methods to wattle and daub were also used and known by various names, such as clam staff and daub, cat-and- clay, or torchis (French), to name only three. Wattle and daub was the most common infill in ancient times. The sticks were not always technically wattlework (woven), but also individual sticks installed vertically, horizontally, or at an angle into holes or grooves in the framing. The coating of daub has many recipes, but generally was a mixture of clay and chalk with a binder such as grass or straw and water or urine.Sunshine, Paula. Wattle and daub. Princes Risborough: Shire Publications, 2006. 7-8. Print. When the manufacturing of bricks increased, brick infill replaced the less durable infills and became more common. Stone laid in mortar as an infill was used in areas where stone rubble and mortar were available. Other infills include bousillage, fired brick, unfired brick such as adobe or mudbrick, stones sometimes called pierrotage, planks as in the German st√§nderbohlenbau, timbers as in st√§nderblockbau, or rarely cob without any wooden support.Glick, Thomas F., Steven John Livesey, and Faith Wallis. Medieval science, technology, and medicine: an encyclopedia. New York: Routledge, 2005. 229. Print. The wall surfaces on the interior were often \\"ceiled\\" with wainscoting and plastered for warmth and appearance. Brick infill sometimes called nogging became the standard infill after the manufacturing of bricks made them more available and less expensive. Half-timbered walls may be covered by siding materials including plaster, weatherboarding, tiles, or slate shingles. The infill may be covered by other materials, including weatherboarding or tiles. or left exposed. When left exposed, both the framing and infill were sometimes done in a decorative manner. Germany is famous for its decorative half-timbering and the figures sometimes have names and meanings. The decorative manner of half- timbering is promoted in Germany by the German Timber-Frame Road, several planned routes people can drive to see notable examples of Fachwerk buildings.

History of the term The term half-timbering is not as old as the German name Fachwerk or the French name colombage, but it is the standard English name for this style. One of the first people to publish the term \\"half- timbered\\" was Mary Martha Sherwood (1775‚Äì1851), who employed it in her book, The Lady of the Manor, published in several volumes from 1823 to 1829. She uses the term picturesquely: \\"...passing through a gate in a quickset hedge, we arrived at the porch of an old half-timbered cottage, where an aged man and woman received us.\\"Sherwood, Mary Martha. The lady of the manor being a series of conversations on the subject of confirmation. Intended for the use of the middle and higher ranks of young females, Volume 5. Wellington, Salop. London: Printed by and for F. Houlston and Son. 1827. 168. Print. https://books.google.com/books?id=teYKAAAAYAAJ By 1842, half-timbered had found its way into The Encyclopedia of Architecture by Joseph Gwilt (1784‚Äì1863). This juxtaposition of exposed timbered beams and infilled spaces created the distinctive \\"half-timbered\\", or occasionally termed, \\"Tudor\\" style, or \\"black-and-white\\". Oldest examples The most ancient known half-timbered building is called the House of opus craticum. It was buried by the eruption of Mount Vesuvius in 79 AD in Herculaneum, Italy. Opus craticum was mentioned by Vitruvius in his books on architecture as a timber frame with wattlework infill. However, the same term is used to describe timber frames with an infill of stone rubble laid in mortar the Romans called opus incertum.Wilson, Nigel Guy. Encyclopedia of ancient Greece. London: Routledge, 2006. 82. Print. Alternative meanings A variation of the second meaning of half-timbered: the ground floor is log and the upper floor is framed (half- timbered in the first sense). Kluge House, Montana, U.S. A less common meaning of the term \\"half-timbered\\" is found in the fourth edition of John Henry Parker's Classic Dictionary of Architecture (1873) which distinguishes full- timbered houses from half-timbered, with half-timber houses having a ground floor in stoneJoyn Henry Parker, 1875. Classic Dictionary of Architecture, 4th ed.

Structure Joints in an ancient French roof; the wooden pegs hold the mortise and tenon joinery together. jettied\\") upper storeys of an English half-timbered village terraced house, the jetties plainly visible This is a part of a timber frame, before pegs are inserted. Traditional timber framing is the method of creating framed structures of heavy timber jointed together with various joints, commonly and originally with lap jointing, and then later pegged mortise and tenon joints. Diagonal bracing is used to prevent \\"racking\\", or movement of structural vertical beams or posts.Nortrud G. Schrammel-Sch√§l, Karl Kessler, Paul-Georg Custodis, Kreisverwaltung des Westerwaldkreises in Montabaur. Fachwerk im Westerwald: Landschaftsmuseum Westerwald, Hachenburg, Ausstellung vom 11. September 1987 bis 30 April 1988. Landschaftsmuseum Westerwald: 1987. . 78 pages Originally, German (and other) master carpenters would peg the joints with allowance of about an inch (25 mm), enough room for the wood to move as it 'seasoned', then cut the pegs, and drive the beam home fully into its socket. To cope with variable sizes and shapes of hewn (by adze or axe) and sawn timbers, two main carpentry methods were employed: scribe carpentry and square rule carpentry. Scribing or coping was used throughout Europe, especially from the 12th century to the 19th century, and subsequently imported to North America, where it was common into the early 19th century. In a scribe frame, timber sockets are fashioned or \\"tailor-made\\" to fit their corresponding timbers; thus, each timber piece must be numbered (or \\"scribed\\"). Square-rule carpentry was developed in New England in the 18th century. It used housed joints in main timbers to allow for interchangeable braces and girts. Today, standardized timber sizing means that timber framing can be incorporated into mass- production methods as per the joinery industry, especially where timber is cut by precision computer numerical control machinery. Jetties A jetty is an upper floor which sometimes historically used a structural horizontal beam, supported on cantilevers, called a bressummer or 'jetty bressummer' to bear the weight of the new wall, projecting outward from the preceding floor or storey. In the city of York in the United Kingdom, the famous street known as The Shambles exemplifies this, where jettied houses seem to almost touch above the street. Timbers The completed frame of a modern timber-frame house Ridge-post framing (left) and story framing (right, with jetties) Historically, the timbers would have been hewn square using a felling axe and then surface-finished with a broadaxe. If required, smaller timbers were ripsawn from the hewn baulks using pitsaws or frame saws. Today, timbers are more commonly bandsawn, and the timbers may sometimes be machine-planed on all four sides. The vertical timbers include: * posts (main supports at corners and other major uprights), * wall studs (subsidiary upright limbs in framed walls), for example, close studding. The horizontal timbers include: * sill- beams (also called ground-sills or sole-pieces, at the bottom of a wall into which posts and studs are fitted using tenons), * noggin-pieces (the horizontal timbers forming the tops and bottoms of the frames of infill panels), * wall-plates (at the top of timber-framed walls that support the trusses and joists of the roof). When jettying, horizontal elements can include: * The jetty bressummer (or breastsummer), where the main sill (horizontal piece) on which the projecting wall above rests, stretches across the whole width of the jetty wall. The bressummer is itself cantilevered forward, beyond the wall below it. * The dragon-beam which runs diagonally from one corner to another, and supports the corner posts above and supported by the corner posts below * The jetty beams or joists conform t floor dimensions above, but are at right angles to the jetty-plates that conform to the shorter dimensions of \\"roof\\" of the floor below. Jetty beams are mortised at 45¬∞ into the sides of the dragon beams. They are the main constituents of the cantilever system, and determine how far the jetty projects. * The jetty- plates are designed to carry the jetty beams. The jetty plates themselves are supported by the corner posts of the recessed floor below. The sloping timbers include: * Trusses (the slanting timbers forming the triangular framework at gables and roof) * Braces (slanting beams giving extra support between horizontal or vertical members of the timber frame) * Herringbone bracing (a decorative and supporting style of frame, usually at 45¬∞ to the upright and horizontal directions of the frame) Post construction and frame construction There were two different systems of the position of posts and studs: * In the older manner, called post construction, the vertical elements continue from the groundwork to the roof. This post construction in German is called Geschossbauweise or St√§nderbauweise. It is somewhat similar to balloon framing method common in North America until the middle of the 20th century. * In the advanced manner, called frame construction, each story is constructed like a case, and the whole building is constructed like a pile of such cases. This frame construction in German is called R√§hmbauweise or Stockwerksbauweise. Ridge-post framing is a structurally simple and ancient post and lintel framing where the posts extend all the way to the ridge beams. Germans call this Firsts√§ule or Hochstud.  Modern Timber Connector Method (1930s-1950s)  Typical lapped joint assemblies of split-ring connectors In the 1930s a system of timber framing referred to as the \\"modern timber connector method\\"National Lumber Manufacturer's Association. \\"Airplane hangar Construction\\". Construction Information Series: Lumber and It's Utilization, vol. IV, ch. 8, 1941. was developed. It was characterized by the use of timber members assembled into trusses and other framing systems and fastened using various types of metal timber connectors. This type of timber construction was used for various building types including warehouses, factories, garages, barns, stores/markets, recreational buildings, barracks, bridges, and trestles.TECO Timber Engineering Company. \\"Specify Timber with the TECO System for Industrial and Commercial Structures\\". 1950. The use of these structures was promoted because of their low construction costs, easy adaptability, and performance in fire as compared to unprotected steel truss construction. During World War II, the United States Army Corps of Engineers and the Canadian Military Engineers undertook to construct airplane hangars using this timber construction system in order to conserve steel. Wood hangars were constructed throughout North America and employed various technologies including bowstring, Warren, and Pratt trusses, glued laminated arches, and lamella roof systems. Unique to this building type is the interlocking of the timber members of the roof trusses and supporting columns and their connection points. The timber members are held apart by \\"fillers\\" (blocks of timber). This leaves air spaces between the timber members which improves air circulation and drying around the members which improves resistance to moisture born decay. Shear plate timber connector Timber members in this type of framing system were connected with ferrous timber connectors of various types. Loads between timber members were transmitted using split-rings (larger loads), toothed rings (lighter loads), or spiked grid connectors.Raser, Wm. V. (1941). Modern Timber Connectors for Modern Timber Structures (Unpublished master's thesis). School of Forestry, Oregon State College, Corvallis, OR. Scholars Archive at OSU, https://ir.library.oregonstate.edu/concern/undergraduate_thesis_or_projects/fb494f226?locale=en. Retrieved 18 Nov 2018. Split-ring connectors were metal rings sandwiched between adjacent timber members to connect them together. The rings were fit into circular grooves on in both timber members then the assembly was held together with through-bolts. The through-bolts only held the assembly together but were not load-carrying. Shear plate connectors were used to transfer loads between timber members and metal. Shear plate connectors resembled large washers, deformed on the side facing the timber in order to grip it, and were through-fastened with long bolts or lengths of threaded rod. A leading manufacturer of these types of timber connectors was the Timber Engineering Company, or TECO, of Washington, DC. The proprietary name of their split-ring connectors was the \\"TECO Wedge-Fit.\\" Modern features Porch of a modern timber-framed house A modern Fachwerk made by Huf Haus near West Linton, Scotland In the United States and Canada, timber-frame construction has been revived since the 1970s, and is now experiencing a thriving renaissance of the ancient skills. This is largely due to such practitioners as Steve Chappell, Jack Sobon, and Tedd Benson, who studied old plans and techniques and revived a long-neglected technique. Once a handcrafted skill passed down, timber-frame construction has now been modernized with the help of modern industrial tools such as CNC machines.These machines and mass-production techniques have assisted growth and made for more affordable frames and shorter lead-times for projects. Timber-framed structures differ from conventional wood-framed buildings in several ways. Timber framing uses fewer, larger wooden members, commonly timbers in the range of 15 to 30 cm (6 to 12 in), while common wood framing uses many more timbers with dimensions usually in the 5- to 25-cm (2- to 10-in) range. The methods of fastening the frame members also differ. In conventional framing, the members are joined using nails or other mechanical fasteners, whereas timber framing uses the traditional mortise and tenon or more complex joints that are usually fastened using only wooden pegs. Modern complex structures and timber trusses often incorporate steel joinery such as gusset plates, for both structural and architectural purposes. Recently, it has become common practice to enclose the timber structure entirely in manufactured panels such as structural insulated panels (SIPs). Although the timbers can only be seen from inside the building when so enclosed, construction is less complex and insulation is greater than in traditional timber building. SIPs are \\"an insulating foam core sandwiched between two structural facings, typically oriented strand board\\" according to the Structural Insulated Panel Association. SIPs reduce dependency on bracing and auxiliary members, because the panels span considerable distances and add rigidity to the basic timber frame. An alternate construction method is with concrete flooring with extensive use of glass. This allows a very solid construction combined with open architecture. Some firms have specialized in industrial prefabrication of such residential and light commercial structures such as Huf Haus as low-energy houses or ‚Äì dependent on location ‚Äì zero-energy buildings. Straw-bale construction is another alternative where straw bales are stacked for nonload-bearing infill with various finishes applied to the interior and exterior such as stucco and plaster. This appeals to the traditionalist and the environmentalist as this is using \\"found\\" materials to build. Mudbricks also called adobe are sometimes used to fill in timber-frame structures. They can be made on site and offer exceptional fire resistance. Such buildings must be designed to accommodate the poor thermal insulating properties of mudbrick, however, and usually have deep eaves or a veranda on four sides for weather protection. Engineered structures Timber design or wood design is a subcategory of structural engineering that focuses on the engineering of wood structures. Timber is classified by tree species (e.g., southern pine, douglas fir, etc.) and its strength is graded using numerous coefficients that correspond to the number of knots, the moisture content, the temperature, the grain direction, the number of holes, and other factors. There are design specifications for sawn lumber, glulam members, prefabricated I-joists, composite lumber, and various connection types. In the United States, structural frames are then designed according to the Allowable Stress Design method or the Load Reduced Factor Design method (the latter being preferred). History and traditions Anne Hvides Gaard, Svendborg, Denmark, from 1560 Anne Hathaway's Cottage in Warwickshire, England: Its timber framing is typical of vernacular Tudor architecture The techniques used in timber framing date back to Neolithic times, and have been used in many parts of the world during various periods such as ancient Japan, continental Europe, and Neolithic Denmark, England, France, Germany, Spain, parts of the Roman Empire, and Scotland.J. H. Williams, 1971.Roman Building-Materials in South-East England in Britannia, Vol. 2, (1971), pp. 166‚Äì195. Society for the Promotion of Roman Studies. Accessed via jstor.org/stable/525807 The timber-framing technique has historically been popular in climate zones which favour deciduous hardwood trees, such as oak. Its most northernmost areas are Baltic countries and southern Sweden. Timber framing is rare in Russia, Finland, northern Sweden, and Norway, where tall and straight lumber, such as pine and spruce, is readily available and log houses were favored, instead. Half- timbered construction in the Northern European vernacular building style is characteristic of medieval and early modern Denmark, England, Germany, and parts of France and Switzerland, where timber was in good supply yet stone and associated skills to dress the stonework were in short supply. In half- timbered construction, timbers that were riven (split) in half provided the complete skeletal framing of the building. Europe is full of timber-framed structures dating back hundreds of years, including manors, castles, homes, and inns, whose architecture and techniques of construction have evolved over the centuries. In Asia, timber-framed structures are found, many of them temples that have stood for centuries. Some Roman carpentry preserved in anoxic layers of clay at Romano-British villa sites demonstrate that sophisticated Roman carpentry had all the necessary techniques for this construction. The earliest surviving (French) half-timbered buildings date from the 12th century. Important resources for the study and appreciation of historic building methods are open-air museums. Topping out ceremony The topping out ceremony is a builders' rite, an ancient tradition thought to have originated in Scandinavia by 700 AD.Robert J. Abrams in Why Do Clocks Run Clockwise? And Other Imponderables. In the U.S., a bough or small tree is attached to the peak of the timber frame after the frame is complete as a celebration. Historically, it was common for the master carpenter to give a speech, make a toast, and then break the glass. In Northern Europe, a wreath made for the occasion is more commonly used rather than a bough. In Japan, the \\"ridge raising\\" is a religious ceremony called the jotoshiki. In Germany, it is called the Richtfest. Carpenters' marks Carpenters' marks is a general term for markings left on the timbers of wooden buildings during construction. * Assembly or marriage marks were used to identify the individual timbers. Assembly marks include numbering to identify the pieces of the frame. The numbering can be similar to Roman numerals except the number four is IIII and nine is VIIII. These marks are chiseled, cut with a race knife (a tool to cut lines and circles in wood), or saw cuts. The numbering can also be in Arabic numerals which are often written with a red grease pencil or crayon. German and French carpenters made some unique marks. (Abbundzeichen (German assembly marks)). * Layout marks left over from marking out identify the place where to cut joints and bore peg holes; carpenters also marked the location on a timber where they had levelled it, as part of the building process, and called these \\"level lines\\"; sometimes they made a mark two feet from a critical location, which was then called the \\"two-foot mark\\". These marks are typically scratched on the timber with an awl-like tool until later in the 19th century, when they started using pencils. * Occasionally, carpenters or owners marked a date and/or their initials in the wood, but not like masons left masons marks. * Boards on the building may have \\"tally marks\\" cut into them which were numbers used to keep track of quantities of lumber (timber). * Other markings in old buildings are called \\"ritual marks\\", which were often signs the occupants felt would protect them from harm. Tools German carpenters in 1880: The tools, from left to right, are: a cart loaded with timbers, rough 300x300px Many historic hand tools used by timber framers for thousands of years have similarities, but vary in shape. Electrically powered tools first became available in the 1920s in the U.S. and continue to evolve. See the list of timber framing tools for basic descriptions and images of unusual tools (The list is incomplete at this time). British tradition The timber-framed Staple Inn in Holborn, London Some of the earliest known timber houses in Europe have been found in Great Britain, dating to Neolithic times; Balbridie and Fengate are some of the rare examples of these constructions. Molded plaster ornamentation, pargetting further enriched some English Tudor architecture houses. Half-timbering is characteristic of English vernacular architecture in East Anglia, Warwickshire, Worcestershire, Herefordshire, Shropshire, and Cheshire, where one of the most elaborate surviving English examples of half-timbered construction is Little Moreton Hall. In South Yorkshire, the oldest timber house in Sheffield, the \\"Bishops' House\\" (c. 1500), shows traditional half- timbered construction. In the Weald of Kent and Sussex, the half-timbered structure of the Wealden hall house, consisted of an open hall with bays on either side and often jettied upper floors. Half-timbered construction traveled with British colonists to North America in the early 17th century but was soon abandoned in New England and the mid-Atlantic colonies for clapboard facings (an East Anglia tradition). The original English colonial settlements, such as Plymouth, Massachusetts and Jamestown, Virginia had timber-framed buildings, rather than the log cabins often associated with the American frontier. Living history programs demonstrating the building technique are available at both these locations.

English styles For Timber-framed houses in Wales see: Architecture of Wales Historic timber frame construction in England (and the rest of the United Kingdom) showed regional variationCruck Construction: an introduction and catalogue (CBA Research Report 42), pp. 61-92. which has been divided into the \\"eastern school\\", the \\"western school\\", and the \\"northern school\\", although the characteristic types of framing in these schools can be found in the other regions (except the northern school).Brown, R. J.. Timber- framed buildings of England. London: R. Hale Ltd. 1997.46-48. A characteristic of the eastern school is close studding which is a half- timbering style of many studs spaced about the width of the studs apart (for example six-inch studs spaced six inches apart) until the middle of the 16th century and sometimes wider spacing after that time. Close studding was an elite style found mostly on expensive buildings. A principal style of the western school is the use of square panels of roughly equal size and decorative framing utilizing many shapes such as lozenges, stars, crosses, quatrefoils, cusps, and many other shapes. The northern school sometimes used posts which landed on the foundation rather than on a sill beam, the sill joining to the sides of the posts and called an interrupted sill. Another northern style was to use close studding but in a herring-bone or chevron pattern. Roof structure of the Barley Barn, Cressing Temple, EssexAs houses were modified to cope with changing demands there sometimes were a combination of styles within a single timber frame construction.Vince, J.; The Timbered House; Sorbus, 1994; The major types of historic framing in England are 'cruck frame', box frame, and aisled construction. From the box frame, more complex framed buildings such as the Wealden House and Jettied house developed. The cruck frame design is among the earliest, and was in use by the early 13th century, with its use continuing to the present day, although rarely after the 18th century. Since the 18th century however, many existing cruck structures have been modified, with the original cruck framework becoming hidden. Aisled barns are of two or three aisled types, the oldest surviving aisled barn being the barley barn at Cressing Temple dated to 1205‚Äì35.Bettley, James, and Nikolaus Pevsner. Essex: The Buildings of England. New Haven, Conn.: Yale University Press, 2007. 313. Jettying was introduced in the 13th century and continued to be used through the 16th century. Generally speaking, the size of timbers used in construction, and the quality of the workmanship reflect the wealth and status of their owners. Small cottages often used quite small cross-section timbers which would have been deemed unsuitable by others. Some of these small cottages also have a very 'home-made' - even temporary - appearance. Many such example can be found in the English shires. Equally, some relatively small buildings can be seen to incorporate substantial timbers and excellent craftsmanship, reflecting the relative wealth and status of their original owners. Important resources for the study of historic building methods in the UK are open-air museums. French tradition Coupesarte Manor (Normandy, France) Elaborately half- timbered houses of the 13th through 18th centuries still remain in Bourges, Tours, Troyes, Rouen, Thiers, Dinan, Rennes, and many other cities, except in Provence and Corsica. Timber framing in French is known colloquially as pan de bois and half-timbering as colombage. Alsace is the region with the most timbered houses in France. But most of these were built when Alsace was part of Germany. The German architecture is spread all over Alsace and old signs in the German language can still be found in front of the houses. The Normandy tradition features two techniques: frameworks were built of four evenly spaced regularly hewn timbers set into the ground (poteau en terre) or into a continuous wooden sill (poteau de sole) and mortised at the top into the plate. The openings were filled with many materials including mud and straw, wattle and daub, or horsehair and gypsum.Charles Van Ravenswaay: 2006.

There are many small towns which escaped both war damage and modernisation and consist mainly, or even entirely, of half- timbered houses. Idstein, Hesse, on the German Timber-Frame Road. Bernkastel at the river Moselle, built in 1417. The German Timber-Frame Road (Deutsche Fachwerkstra√üe) is a tourist route that connects towns with remarkable fachwerk. It is more than long, crossing Germany through the states of Lower Saxony, Saxony-Anhalt, Hesse, Thuringia, Bavaria, and Baden- W√ºrttemberg.Heinrich Edel: 1928. Die Fachwerkh√§user der Stadt Braunschweig: ein kunst und kulturhistorisches Bild. Druckerei Appelhaus, 1928 Some of the more prominent towns (among many) include: Quedlinburg, a UNESCO-listed town, which has over 1200 half-timbered houses spanning five centuries; Goslar, another UNESCO-listed town; Hanau-Steinheim (home of the Brothers Grimm); Bad Urach; Eppingen (\\"Romance city\\" with a half-timbered church dating from 1320); Mosbach; Vaihingen an der Enz and nearby UNESCO-listed Maulbronn Abbey; Schorndorf (birthplace of Gottlieb Daimler); Calw; Celle; and Biberach an der Ri√ü with both the largest medieval complex, the Holy Spirit Hospital and one of Southern Germany's oldest buildings, now the Braith-Mali-Museum, dated to 1318. German fachwerk building styles are extremely varied with a huge number of carpentry techniques which are highly regionalized. German planning laws for the preservation of buildings and regional architecture preservation dictate that a half-timbered house must be authentic to regional or even city- specific designs before being accepted.Wilhelm S√ºvern: 1971. Torb√∂gen und Inschriften lippischer Fachwerkh√§user in Volume 7 of Heimatland Lippe. Lippe Heimatbund: 1971. 48 pagesHeinrich Stiewe: 2007. Fachwerkh√§user in Deutschland: Konstruktion, Gestalt und Nutzung vom Mittelalter bis heute. Primus Verlag: 2007. . 160 pages A brief overview of styles follows, as a full inclusion of all styles is impossible. In general the northern states have fachwerk very similar to that of the nearby Netherlands and England while the more southerly states (most notably Bavaria and Switzerland) have more decoration using timber because of greater forest reserves in those areas. During the 19th century, a form of decorative timber-framing called bundwerk became popular in Bavaria, Austria and South Tyrol. The German fachwerkhaus usually has a foundation of stone, or sometimes brick, perhaps up to several feet (a couple of metres) high, which the timber framework is mortised into or, more rarely, supports an irregular wooden sill. The three main forms may be divided geographically: * West Central Germany and Franconia: ** In West Central German and Franconian timber-work houses (particularly in the Central Rhine and Moselle): the windows most commonly lie between the rails of the sills and lintels. * Northern Germany, Central Germany and East German: ** In Saxony and around the Harz foothills, angle braces often form fully extended triangles. ** Lower Saxon houses have a joist for every post. ** Holstein fachwerk houses are famed for their massive 12-inch (30 cm) beams. * Southern Germany including the Black and Bohemian Forests ** In Swabia, W√ºrttemberg, Alsace, and Switzerland, the use of the lap-joint is thought to be the earliest method of connecting the wall plates and tie beams and is particularly identified with Swabia. A later innovation (also pioneered in Swabia) was the use of tenons ‚Äì builders left timbers to season which were held in place by wooden pegs (i.e., tenons). The timbers were initially placed with the tenons left an inch or two out of intended position and later driven home after becoming fully seasoned. The most characteristic feature is the spacing between the posts and the high placement of windows. Panels are enclosed by a sill, posts, and a plate, and are crossed by two rails between which the windows are placed‚Äîlike \\"two eyes peering out\\". In addition there is a myriad of regional scrollwork and fretwork designs of the non-loadbearing large timbers (braces) peculiar to particularly wealthy towns or cities. A unique type of timber-frame house can be found in the region where the borders of Germany, the Czech Republic, and Poland meet - it is called the Upper Lusatian house (Umgebindehaus, translates as round-framed house). This type has a timber frame surrounding a log structure on part of the ground floor.

Poland Timber-frame house in central Pozna≈Ñ, Poland Most Polish half-timbered houses have been built in regions that once belonged to Germany, had a lot of German immigrants or significant German cultural influence. As these regions were at some point parts of Prussia, half-timbered walls are called mur pruski. The Slovincians, an autochthone Old Slavic group in the Prussian province of Pomerania also built half-timbered houses. A distinctive type of house associated with mostly Mennonite immigrant groups from Frisia and the Netherlands, known as the Olƒôdrzy, is called an arcade house (dom podcieniowy). The Umgebindehaus rural housing tradition of south Saxony (Germany) is also found in the neighboring areas of Poland (the Silesian region) and the north of Czech Republic. Another world-class type of wooden building Poland shares with some neighboring countries are its wooden church buildings.

Timber framing is often of the post and lintel style. Castile and Le√≥n, par example La Alberca, and the Basque Country have the most representative examples of the use of timber framing in the Iberian Peninsula. Most traditional Basque buildings with half-timbering elements are detached farm houses (in Basque: baserriak). Their upper floors were built with jettied box frames in close studding. In the oldest farmsteads and, if existing, in the third floor the walls were sometimes covered with vertical weatherboards. Big holes were left in the gable of the main fa√ßade for ventilation. The wooden beams were painted over, mostly in dark red. The vacancies were filled in with wattle and daub or rubble laid in a clay mortar and then plastered over with white chalk or nogged with bricks. Although the entire supporting structure is made of wood, the timbering is only visible on the main fa√ßade, which is generally oriented to the southeast. Although the typical Basque house is now mostly associated with half-timbering, the outer walls and the fire-walls were built in masonry (rubble stone, bricks or, ideally, ashlars) whenever it could be afforded. Timber was a sign of poverty. Oak-wood was cheaper than masonry: that is why, when the money was running out, the upper floor walls were mostly built timbered. Extant baserriak with half-timbered upper-floor fa√ßades were built from the 15th to 19th centuries and are found in all Basque regions with oceanic climate, except in Zuberoa (Soule), but are concentrated in Lapurdi (Labourd). Some medieval Basque tower houses (dorretxeak) feature an overhanged upper floor in half- timbering.:eu:Dorretxe dorretxe weblink to the Basque Wikipedia To a lesser extent timbered houses are also found in villages and towns as row houses, as the photo from the Uztaritz village shows. Currently, it has again become popular to build houses resembling old Basque farmsteads, with more or less respect for the principles of traditional half-timbered building.:fr:N√©obasque N√©obasque weblink to the French Wikipedia Inharria Ibarron.jpgInharri baserri in Ibarron (Lapurdi) Aranguren dorretxea Orozko.jpgAranguren dorretxea (Orozko, Bizkaia) Ustaritz Fa√ßades basques.jpgHalf-timbered houses from Uztarritz (Lapurdi) Casa-con-entramado-guadilla-de-villamar-2018.jpgTimbered house from Guadilla de Villamar (Spain). Popular style. Switzerland An exceptional fachwerk house called Eglihaus in Hombrechtikon, Switzerland Switzerland has many styles of timber framing which overlap with its neighboring countries. Belgium Nowadays, timber framing is primarily found in the provinces of Limburg, Li√®ge, and Luxemburg. In urban areas, the ground floor was formerly built in stone and the upper floors in timber framing. Also, as timber framing was seen as a cheaper way of building, often the visible structures of noble houses were in stone and bricks, and the invisible or lateral walls in timber framing. The open-air museums of Bokrijk and Saint-Hubert (Fourneau Saint-Michel) show many examples of Belgian timber framing. Many post-and-beam houses can be found in cities and villages, but, unlike France, the United Kingdom, and Germany, there are few fully timber framed cityscapes.

Most of the half-timbered houses in Sweden were built during the Danish time and are located in what until 1658 used to be Danish territory in southern Sweden, primarily in the province Sk√•ne and secondarily in Blekinge and Halland. In Swedish half-timber is known as \\"korsvirke\\". * Stave construction is called \\"stavverk\\". Scandinavia is famous for its ancient stave churches. Stave construction is a traditional timber frame with walls of vertical planks, the posts and planks landing in a sill on a foundation. Similar construction with earthfast posts is called \\"stolpteknik\\". and Palisade construction where many vertical wall timbers or planks have their feet buried in the ground called post in ground or earthfast construction is called \\"palissadteknik\\". (see also Palisade church) * Swedish plank-frame construction is called skiftesverk. This is a traditional timber frame with walls of horizontal planks. Norway Norway has at least two significant types of timber framed structures: 1) The stave church and 2) grindverk. The term stave (= post or pole) indicates that a stave church essentially means a framed church, a distinction made in a region where log building is common. All but one surviving stave churches are in Norway, one in Sweden. Replicas of stave churches and other Norwegian building types have been reproduced elsewhere, e.g. at the Scandinavian Heritage Park in North Dakota, United States. Grindverk translates as trestle construction, consisting of a series of transversal frames of two posts and a connecting beam, supporting two parallel wall plates bearing the rafters. Unlike other types of timber framing in Europe, the trestle frame construction uses no mortise and tenon joints. Archaeological excavations have uncovered similar wooden joints from more than 3,000 years ago, suggesting that this type of framing is an ancient unbroken tradition. Grindverk buildings are only found on part of the western coast of Norway, and most of them are boathouses and barns. There is currently no article in English Wikipedia about grindverk framing, but see Norwegian Wikipedia::no:Grindverk Log building was the common construction used for housing humans and livestock in Norway from the middle ages until the 18th century. Timber framing of the type used in large parts of Europe appeared occasionally in late medieval towns, but never became common, except for the capital Christiania. After a fire in 1624 in Oslo, King Christian IV ordered the town to be relocated to a new site. He outlawed log building to prevent future conflagrations and required wealthy burghers to use brickwork and the less affluent to use timber framing in the Danish manner. During the next two centuries, 50 per cent of the houses were timber framed. All of these buildings disappeared as a consequence of this small provincial town of Christiania becoming the capital of independent Norway in 1814. This caused a rapid growth, with the population rising from 10 000 to 250 000 by 1900. Increasing prices caused a massive urban renewal, which resulted in all wooden structures being replaced with office blocks.

It was in North Holland where the import of cheaper timber, combined with the Dutch innovation of windmill-powered sawmills, allowed economically viable widespread use of protective wood covering over framework. In the late 17th century the Dutch introduced vertical cladding also known in Eastern England as clasp board and in western England as weatherboard, then as more wood was available more cheaply, horizontal cladding in the 17th century. Perhaps owing to economic considerations, vertical cladding returned to fashion.Lars Bostr√∂m editor 1st International RILEM Symposium on Timber Engineering: Stockholm, Sweden, September 13‚Äì14, 1999 Volume 8 of RILEM proceedings RILEM Publications, 1999. . 838 pages. 317‚Äì327. Dutch wall framing is virtually always built in bents and the three basic types of roof framing are the rafter roof, purlin roof, and ridge-post roof.Herman Janse, Houten kappen in Nederland 1000-1940. Delftse Universitaire Pers, Delft / Rijksdienst voor de Monumentenzorg, Zeist 1989. translations are mine Romania Half-timbered houses can be found in Romania mostly in areas once inhabited by Transylvanian Saxons, in cities, towns and villages with Germanic influence such as Bistri»õa, Bra»ôov, Media»ô, Sibiu and Sighi»ôoara. However the number of half-timbered houses is very small. In Wallachia there are few examples of this type of architecture, most of those buildings being located in Sinaia, such as the Pele»ô Castle.

File:Sinaia.jpgA half-timbered building in Sinaia. Americas Most \\"haft-timbered\\" houses existing in Missouri, Pennsylvania, and Texas were built by German settlers. Old Salem North Carolina has fine examples of German fachwerk buildings.Noble, Allen George, and M. Margaret Geib. Wood, brick, and stone: the North American settlement landscape. Amherst: University of Massachusetts Press, 1984. 42, 43. Many are still present in Colonia Tovar (Venezuela), Santa Catarina and Rio Grande do Sul (Brazil), where Germans settled. Later, they chose more suitable building materials for local conditions (most likely because of the great problem of tropical termites.) =New France= In the historical region of North America known as New France, colombage pierrot√©, also called ma√ßonnerie entre poteaux,\\"colombage pierrot√©\\" def. 1. Edwards, Jay Dearborn, and Nicolas Verton. A Creole lexicon architecture, landscape, people. Baton Rouge: Louisiana State University Press, 2004. 65. Print. half-timbered construction with the infill between the posts and studs of stone rubble and lime plaster or bousillage and simply called colombage in France. Colombage was used from the earliest settlement until the 18th century but was known as bousillage entre poteaus sur solle in Lower Louisiana. The style had its origins in Normandy, and was brought to Canada by very early Norman settlers. The Men's House at Lower Fort Garry is a good example. The exterior walls of such buildings were often covered over with clapboards to protect the infill from erosion. Naturally, this required frequent maintenance, and the style was abandoned as a building method in the 18th century in Qu√©bec. For the same reasons, half-timbering in New England, which was originally employed by the English settlers, fell out of favour soon after the colonies had become established. Other variations of half-timbering are colombage √† teurques (torchis), straw coated with mud and hung over horizontal staves (or otherwise held in place), colombage an eclisses, and colombage a lattes. Poteaux-en-terre (posts in ground) is a type of timber framing with the many vertical posts or studs buried in the ground called post in ground or \\"earthfast\\" construction. The tops of the posts are joined to a beam and the spaces between are filled in with natural materials called bousillage or pierrotage. Poteaux-sur-sol (posts on a sill) is a general term for any kind of framing on a sill. However, sometimes it specifically refers to \\"vertical log construction\\" like poteaux-en-terre placed on sills with the spaces between the timbers infilled. Piece-sur-piece also known as Post-and- plank style or \\"corner post construction\\" (and many other names) in which wood is used both for the frame and horizontal infill; for this reason it may be incorrect to call it \\"half-timbering\\". It is sometimes a blend of framing and log building with two styles: the horizontal pieces fit into groves in the posts and can slide up and down or the horizontal pieces fit into individual mortises in the posts and are pegged and the gaps between the pieces chinked (filled in with stones or chips of wood covered with mud or moss briefly discussed in Log cabin.) This technique of a timber frame walls filled in with horizontal planks or logs proved better suited to the harsh climates of Qu√©bec and Acadia, which at the same time had abundant wood. It became very popular throughout New France, as far afield as southern Louisiana. The Hudson's Bay Company used this technique for many of its trading posts, and this style of framing becoming known as Hudson Bay style or Hudson Bay corners. Also used by the Red River Colony this style also became known as \\"Red River Framing\\". \\"The support of horizontal timbers by corner posts is an old form of construction in Europe. It was apparently carried across much of the continent from Silesia by the Lausitz urnfield culture in the late Bronze Age.\\"Upton, Dell, Vllach, John Michael, Common places: Readings in American Vernacular Architecture, referencing V. Gordon Childe, The Bronze Age, (NY, Macmillan, 1930, pp. 206-8. Similar building techniques are apparently not found in FranceNoble, Allen George, and M. Margaret Geib. Wood, brick, and stone: the North American settlement landscape. Amherst: University of Massachusetts Press, 1984. 121. but exist in Germany and Switzerland known as Bohlenstanderbau when planks are used or blockstanderbau when beams are used as the infill. In Sweden known as sleppvegg or skiftesverk and in Denmark as bulhus. A particularly interesting example in the U.S. is the Golden Plough Tavern (c. 1741), York, York County, PA, which has the ground level of corner-post construction with the second floor of fachwerk (half timbered) and was built for a German with other Germanic features.\\"Corner-Post Log Construction: Description, Analysis, and Sources\\", A Report to Early American Industries Association by Nancy S. Shedd March 10, 1986. available online at ). Settlers in New France also built horizontal log, brick, and stone buildings. =New Netherland= Characteristics of traditional timber framing in the parts of the U.S. formerly known as New Netherland are H-framing also known as dropped-tie framing in the U.S. and the similar anchor beam framing as found in the New World Dutch barn. =New England= Some time periods/regions within New England contain certain framing elements such as common purlin roofs, five sided ridge beams, plank-frame construction and plank-wall construction. The English barn always contains an \\"English tying joint\\" and the later New England style barn were built using bents. Japanese Wall framing of a Japanese house under construction Japanese timber framing is believed to be descended from Chinese framing (see Ancient Chinese wooden architecture). Asian framing is significantly different from western framing, with its predominant use of post and lintel framing and an almost complete lack of diagonal bracing. Revival styles in later centuries The left When half- timbering regained popularity in Britain after 1860 in the various revival styles, such as the Queen Anne style houses by Richard Norman Shaw and others, it was often used to evoke a \\"Tudor\\" atmosphere (see Tudorbethan), though in Tudor times half-timbering had begun to look rustic and was increasingly limited to village houses (illustration, above left). In 1912, Allen W. Jackson published The Half-Timber House: Its Origin, Design, Modern Plan, and Construction, and rambling half-timbered beach houses appeared on dune-front properties in Rhode Island or under palm-lined drives of Beverly Hills. During the 1920s increasingly minimal gestures towards some half-timbering in commercial speculative house-building saw the fashion diminish. In the revival styles, such as Tudorbethan (Mock Tudor), the half-timbered appearance is superimposed on the brickwork or other material as an outside decorative fa√ßade rather than forming the main frame that supports the structure. The style was used in many of the homes built in Lake Mohawk, New Jersey, as well as all of the clubhouse, shops, and marina. For information about \\"roundwood framing\\" see the book Roundwood Timber Framing:Building Naturally Using Local Resources by Ben Law (East Meon, Hampshire: Permanent Publications; 2010. ) Advantages The use of timber framing in buildings offers various aesthetic and structural benefits, as the timber frame lends itself to open plan designs and allows for complete enclosure in effective insulation for energy efficiency. In modern construction, a timber-frame structure offers many benefits: * It is rapidly erected. A moderately sized timber-frame home can be erected within 2 to 3 days. * It is well suited to prefabrication, modular construction, and mass-production. Timbers can be pre-fit within bents or wall-sections and aligned with a jig in a shop, without the need for a machine or hand-cut production line. This allows faster erection on site and more precise alignments. Valley and hip timbers are not typically pre-fitted. * As an alternative to the traditional infill methods, the frame can be encased with SIPs. This stage of preparing the assembled frame for the installation of windows, mechanical systems, and roofing is known as drying in. * it can be customized with carvings or incorporate heirloom structures such as barns etc.. * it can use recycled or otherwise discarded timbers * it offers some structural benefits as the timber frame, if properly engineered, lends itself to better seismic survivability Consequently, there are many half-timbered houses which still stand despite the foundation having partially caved in over the centuries. * The generally larger spaces between the frames enable greater flexibility in the placement, at construction or afterwards, of windows and doors with less resulting weakening of the structural integrity and the need for heavy lintels. In North America, heavy timber construction is classified Building Code Type IV: a special class reserved for timber framing which recognizes the inherent fire resistance of large timber and its ability to retain structural capacity in fire situations. In many cases this classification can eliminate the need and expense of fire sprinklers in public buildings. Disadvantages Traditional or historic structures In terms of the traditional half-timber or fachwerkhaus there are maybe more disadvantages than advantages today. Such houses are notoriously expensive to maintain let alone renovate and restore, most commonly owing to local regulations that do not allow divergence from the original, modification or incorporation of modern materials. Additionally, in such nations as Germany, where energy efficiency is highly regulated, the renovated building may be required to meet modern energy efficiencies, if it is to be used as a residential or commercial structure (museums and significant historic buildings have no semi-permanent habitade exempt). Many framework houses of significance are treated merely to preserve, rather than render inhabitable ‚Äì most especially as the required heavy insecticidal fumigation is highly poisonous. In some cases, it is more economical to build anew using authentic techniques and correct period materials than restore. One major problem with older structures is the phenomenon known as mechano-sorptive creep or slanting: where wood beams absorb moisture whilst under compression or tension strains and deform, shift position or both. This is a major structural issue as the house may deviate several degrees from perpendicular to its foundations (in the x-axis, y-axis, and even z-axis) and thus be unsafe and unstable or so out of square it is extremely costly to remedy.Charlotte Bengtsson: \\"Mechano- sorptive creep of wood in tension and compression\\": in Lars Bostr√∂m editor 1st International RILEM Symposium on Timber Engineering: Stockholm, Sweden, September 13‚Äì14, 1999 Volume 8 of RILEM proceedings, RILEM Publications, 1999. . 838 pages. 317‚Äì327. A summary of problems with Fachwerkh√§user or half- timbered houses includes the following, though many can be avoided by thoughtful design and application of suitable paints and surface treatments and routine maintenance. Often, though when dealing with a structure of a century or more old, it is too late. * \\"slanting\\"- thermo-mechanical (weather- seasonally induced) and mechano-sorptive (moisture induced) creep of wood in tension and compression. * poor prevention of capillary movement of water within any exposed timber, leading to afore-described creep, or rot * eaves that are too narrow or non-existent (thus allowing total exposure to rain and snow) * too much exterior detailing that does not allow adequate rainwater run-off * timber ends, joints, and corners poorly protected through coatings, shape or position * non-beveled vertical beams (posts and clapboards) allow water absorption and retention through capillary action. * surface point or coatings allowed to deteriorate * traditional gypsum, or wattle and daub containing organic materials (animal hair, straw, manure) which then decompose. * in both poteaux-en-terre and poteaux-sur-sol insect, fungus or bacterial decomposition. * rot including dry rot. * infestation of xylophagous pest organisms such as (very common in Europe) the Ptinidae family particularly the common furniture beetle, termites, cockroaches, powderpost beetles, mice, and rats (quite famously so in many children's stories). * Noise from footsteps in adjacent rooms above, below, and on the same floor in such buildings can be quite audible. This is often resolved with built-up floor systems involving clever sound-isolation and absorption techniques, and at the same time providing passage space for plumbing, wiring, and even heating and cooling equipment. * Other fungi that are non-destructive to the wood, but are harmful to humans such as black mold. These fungi may also thrive on many \\"modern\\" building materials. * Wood burns more readily than some other materials, making timber-frame buildings somewhat more susceptible to fire damage, although this idea is not universally accepted: Since the cross-sectional dimensions of many structural members exceed 15 cm √ó 15 cm (6\\" √ó 6\\"), timber-frame structures benefit from the unique properties of large timbers, which char on the outside forming an insulated layer that protects the rest of the beam from burning. * prior flood or soil subsidence damage See also * American historic carpentry * Boat building * Berg house * Carpentry * Cross-laminated timber * Framing (construction) ** Balloon framing ** Platform framing * German Timber-Frame Road **Woodworking joints * Norman architecture * Open-air museum * Vernacular architecture * Weatherboarding Notes References * Richard Harris, Discovering Timber-framed Buildings (3rd rev. ed.), Shire Publications, 1993, . * Further reading ;English tradition A good introductory book on carpentry and joinery from 1898 in London, England is titled Carpentry & Joinery by Frederick G.

It was also eventually turned into a short story. It focuses on four Chinese American immigrant families in San Francisco who start a club known as The Joy Luck Club, playing the Chinese game of mahjong for money while feasting on a variety of foods. The book is structured somewhat like a mahjong game, with four parts divided into four sections to create sixteen chapters. The three mothers and four daughters (one mother, Suyuan Woo, dies before the novel opens) share stories about their lives in the form of vignettes. Each part is preceded by a parable relating to the game. In 1993, the novel was adapted into a feature film directed by Wayne Wang and starring Ming-Na Wen, Lauren Tom, Tamlyn Tomita, France Nguyen, Rosalind Chao, Kieu Chinh, Tsai Chin, Lisa Lu, and Vivian Wu. The screenplay was written by the author Amy Tan along with Ronald Bass. The novel was also adapted into a play, by Susan Kim, which premiered at Pan Asian Repertory Theatre in New York. Plot First Chinese Baptist Church at 15 Waverly Pl, San Francisco The Joy Luck Club consists of sixteen interlocking stories about the lives of four Chinese immigrant mothers and their four American-born daughters. In 1949, the four mothers meet at the First Chinese Baptist Church in San Francisco and agree to continue to meet to play mah jong. They call their mah jong group the Joy Luck Club. The stories told in this novel revolve around the Joy Luck Club women and their daughters. Structurally, the novel is divided into four major sections, with two sections focusing on the stories of the mothers and two sections on the stories of the daughters. Feathers from a Thousand Li Away The first section, Feathers from a Thousand Li Away, introduces the Joy Luck Club through daughter Jing- Mei Woo, whose late mother Suyuan Woo founded the Joy Luck Club, and focuses on the four mothers. Jing-Mei relates the story of how her mother Suyuan was the wife of an officer in the Kuomintang during World War II and how she was forced to flee from her home in Kweilin and abandon her twin daughters. Suyuan later found out her first husband died, remarried to Canning Woo, and immigrated to the United States where Jing-Mei was born. Suyuan and Canning attempted to find Suyuan's daughters, and Canning assumed that Suyuan had given up hope. Jing-Mei, who has been asked to take her mother's place in the Joy Luck Club, learns from the other mothers that her half-sisters are alive. They ask that Jing-Mei go to China and meet her sisters, and tell them about Suyuan's death. The other three mothers relate the stories of their childhood. An-Mei Hsu's story relates how her mother left her family to become the fourth concubine of Wu Tsing, a rich merchant, while An-Mei was raised by her maternal grandmother. Her mother returns only to cut off a piece of her flesh to cook a soup in hopes of healing An-Mei's grandmother, though An-Mei's grandmother still dies. Lindo Jong explains how in childhood she was forced into a loveless marriage and was pressured by her mother-in-law's desire for Lindo to produce grandchildren. Through her own ingenuity, Lindo fabricates a convincing story to annul her marriage and emigrate to the United States. The final story of the first section follows Ying-Ying St. Clair, who tells the story of how she fell into a lake during the Zhongqiujie festival when she was only four. After being rescued by a group of fishermen, she realizes that she is lost. This experience emotionally traumatizes her, and she is dropped at the shore, and wanders into an outdoor performance featuring the Moon Lady, said to grant wishes. But when Ying-Ying approaches the Moon Lady after the play to wish to be returned to her family, she discovers the Moon Lady is played by a man. Twenty-Six Malignant Gates The second section traces the childhoods of the Joy Luck children. In the first story, Waverly Jong talks about how she started playing chess, first with her brothers and then with old men in the playground near her school. At the age of nine, she becomes a national chess champion. She is embarrassed when her mother, Lindo, introduces her to everyone she meets, showing her off like a trophy and seeming to take the credit for her daughter's brilliance. This leads to an angry confrontation between the two of them. Lena relates the stories her mother told her when she was younger (her great grandfather sentenced a beggar to die in the worst possible manner). Lena's family moves to North Hill from Oakland. Her mother, who seems restless, delivers an anencephalic child who dies at birth. In Lena's eyes, her mother becomes a ‚Äòliving ghost‚Äô. The story of their neighbors and the relationship between the mother and the daughter of the neighboring household is also mentioned. Rose Hsu Jordan wishes to tell her mother that she plans to divorce her husband Ted. She reflects on their relationship. She then goes on to relate an incident in which her family (her parents and six siblings) go to the beach. Her youngest brother, Bing, drowns. She returns along with her mother An Mei to search for Bing, but in vain. The last story is that of Jing Mei Woo and the pressure that her mother puts on her to perform exceedingly well in some field (to be a child prodigy). She begins to learn to play the piano but doesn't perform well in a concert and stops playing. This disappoints her mother because she wanted her to be a great pianist and Jing-Mei shows no interest in being anything else but herself. Around her 30th birthday, Suyuan presents her an old piano which she used to play as a child. Although Jing-Mei admits she had forgotten how to play the piano, Suyuan encourages her to try again. She admits to Jing-Mei that she still has the talent to be a great pianist, but self-doubt holds her back. American Translation The third section follows the Joy Luck children as adult women, all facing various conflicts. In Lena's story, she narrates her troubling marital problems and how she fears being inferior to her husband, Harold. She does not realize he has taken advantage of her both at home and at work, where he is also her boss and earns much more than her. Ying-Ying is very much aware of this and breaks the table leg. Lena finally admits she's not happy in her marriage to Harold and is lost inside. Ying-Ying encourages her to stop being passive and stand up to her husband or nothing will change. Waverly Jong worries about her mother's opinion of her white fianc√©, Rich, and recalls quitting chess after becoming angry at her mother in the marketplace. She believes that her mother will still has absolute power over her and will object to her forthcoming marriage to Rich, after she did the same to her previous husband, Marvin Chen, whom she has a daughter, Shoshana. After a disastrous attempt at a dinner party to tell her mother of their wedding, Waverly confronts her mother the morning afterwards and realizes that her mother has known all along about her relationship with Rich and has accepted him. Rose Hsu Jordan learns that Ted intends to marry someone else after divorcing her. She realizes through her mother's advice that she needs to fight for her rights and refuses to sign the conditions set forth by his divorce papers. She hires a good lawyer and wins possession of the house, forcing Ted to take her more seriously. In Jing-Mei's story, Jing-Mei has an argument with Waverly at a Chinese New Year's dinner the year before the story begins. Realizing that Jing-Mei has been humiliated, Suyuan gives her a special jade pendant called \\"life's importance\\"; Jing-Mei regrets that she never learned the meaning of the pendant's name. She also confronts Suyuan with the belief that she had always been disappointed in Jing-Mei and admitted she could never live up to her high expectations. Jing-Mei believes that because she has never finished college, doesn't have a good career, and remains unmarried, she is seen as a failure in her mother's eyes. Suyuan eventually reveals her true meaning; that while Waverly has style, she lacks the kind and generous heart that Jing-Mei has. She also tells Jing-Mei that she understands the frustrations of never being good enough in her eyes and admits she is proud of Jing-Mei. Queen Mother of the Western Skies The final section of the novel returns to the viewpoints of the mothers as adults dealing with difficult choices. An-Mei reveals what happened after her grandmother died, she angered her relatives by leaving with her mother. They return to the home where her mother lived as the abused fourth concubine of Wu Tsing, whose second concubine manipulates and controls the household and has taken An-Mei's half-brother as her son. An-Mei learns how her mother was forced into accepting her position after Wu Tsing's second wife arranged for An-Mei's mother to be raped and shamed. When she came to her family for help, they cruelly turned their backs on her mother and told her to leave. An-Mei finds her mother has poisoned herself two days before Chinese New Year, knowing that Wu Tsing's superstitious beliefs will ensure An-Mei will grow up in favorable conditions. During the funeral, she takes her younger half- brother and forces Wu Tsing to honor both them and their deceased mother out of fear of him being haunted by their mother's ghost. The angry Second Wife attempts to dispute her claims and tries to discredit her. An-Mei quickly makes an example of her by destroying the fake pearl necklace that she originally gave to her, which exposes her cruelty and manipulation. This causes the Second Wife to realize that she has lost control of the household and brought trouble on herself, so she backs down. Fearing bad karma on the way, Wu Tsing honors both An-Mei and her brother as his children and their mother as his favorite First Wife. Ying-Ying St. Clair reveals how her first husband, a womanizer, abandoned her and how she married an American man she did not love after relinquishing her sense of control in her life. She later took back her sense of control when she finally had a talk to Lena and convinced her to leave Harold. Lindo Jong relates how she arrived in San Francisco and met An-Mei Hsu when they both worked at a fortune-cookie factory, which eventually gave her the means to plant the idea of marriage in her boyfriend's head. The novel's final episode returns to Jing-Mei, and her mother's desire to find her lost twin daughters. Jing-Mei and her father fly to China, where Jing-Mei meets her half-sisters and embraces her Chinese heritage. In doing so, she was finally able to make peace with Suyuan. Characters Mothers =Suyuan Woo= During the Second World War, Suyuan lives in the Republic of China while her husband at the time served as an officer in Chungking (Chongqing). She starts the original Joy Luck Club with her three friends to cope with the War. There is little to eat, but they pretend it is a feast, and talk about their hopes for the future. On the day of the Japanese invasion, Suyuan leaves her house with nothing but a bag of clothes, a bag of food, and her twin baby daughters. During the long journey, Suyuan contracts such severe dysentery that she feels certain she will die. Fearing that a dead mother would doom her babies' chances of rescue, she reluctantly and emotionally leaves her daughters under a barren tree, together with all her belongings, along with a note asking anyone who might find the babies to care for them and contact the father. Suyuan then departs, expecting to die. However, she is rescued by a truck and finds out her husband has died. She later remarries, goes to America, and forms a new Joy Luck Club with three other Chinese female immigrants she met at church. She gives birth to another daughter, but her abandonment of her twin girls haunts her for the rest of her life. After many years, Suyuan learns that the twins were adopted, but dies of a brain aneurysm before she can meet them. It is her American-born daughter Jing-mei who fulfills her long-cherished wish of reuniting with them. As Suyuan dies before the novel begins, her history is told by Jing-mei, based on her knowledge of her mother's stories, anecdotes from her father, and what the other members of the Joy Luck Club tell her. =An-Mei Hsu= An-Mei is raised by her grandparents and other relatives during her early years in Ningbo after her widowed mother shocks the family by becoming a concubine to a middle-aged wealthy man after her first husband's death. This becomes a source of conflict for the young An-Mei, as her aunts and uncles deeply resent her mother for such a dishonorable act. They try to convince An-Mei that it is not fitting for her to live with her disgraced mother, who is now forbidden to enter the family home. An-Mei's mother, however, still wishes to be part of her daughter's life. After An-Mei's grandmother dies, An-mei moves out to live with her mother in the home of her mother's new husband, Wu-Tsing, much to the argument of her relatives who insists she remains at home with them. An-Mei learns that her mother was coerced into being Wu-Tsing's concubine through the manipulations of his Second Wife, the favourite. This woman arranged for An- Mei's mother, still in mourning for her original husband, to be raped by Wu- Tsing. When her mother came to her family for their assistance, they cruelly refused and disowned her. The stigma left An-Mei's mother with no choice but to marry Wu-Tsing and become his new but lowly Fourth Wife. She later lost her baby son to Second Wife, who claimed the boy as her own child to ensure her place in the household. Second Wife also tried to win over An-mei upon her arrival in Wu-Tsing's mansion, giving her a necklace made of \\"pearls\\" that her mother later revealed were actually glass beads by crushing one with her teacup. An-Mei's mother re-knots the necklace to hide the missing bead, but now An-Mei knows the truth about Second Wife's seeming generosity. Wu-Tsing is a highly superstitious man, and Second Wife takes advantage of this weakness by making false suicide attempts and threatening to haunt him as a ghost if he does not let her have her way. According to Chinese tradition, a person's soul comes back after three days to settle scores with the living. Wu-Tsing, therefore, is known to be afraid to face the ghost of an angry or scorned wife. After Second Wife fakes a suicide attempt to prevent An-Mei and her mother from getting their own small house, An-Mei's mother successfully commits suicide herself, eating tangyuan laced with lethal amounts of opium. Also taking advantage of Wu Tsing's beliefs, she times her death so that her soul is due to return on the first day of the Lunar New Year, a day when all debts must be settled lest the debtor suffer great misfortune. An-Mei takes her younger brother's arm and demanded that Wu Tsing honors them and her mother or face great consequences. When Second Wife attempts to dispute this at the funeral rites, An-Mei quickly makes an example of her and show her awareness of all Second Wife's deception by crushing the fake pearl necklace under her feet. This symbolizes her new power over the woman who made her mother's life miserable by abusing her and taking her brother away. Now fearing An-Mei, Second Wife realizes the bad karma she has brought upon herself and backs down having lost control of the house. With this in mind, Wu-Tsing promises to treat his Fourth Wife's children, including An-Mei, as if they were his very own flesh and blood and their mother as his honored First Wife. An-Mei later immigrates to America, marries, and gives birth to seven children (four sons, three daughters). The youngest, a son named Bing, drowns at age four. =Lindo Jong= Lindo is a strong-willed woman, a trait that her daughter Waverly attributes to her having been born in the year of the Horse. When Lindo was only twelve, she was forced to move in with a neighbor's young son, Huang Tyan Yu, through the machinations of the village matchmaker. After some training for household duties through her in-laws, she and Tyan-yu married when she turned sixteen. She soon realized that her husband was a mere boy at heart and had no sexual interest in her. It's loosely implied that he might have been gay. Lindo began to care for her husband as a brother, but her cruel mother-in-law expected Lindo to produce a grandson. She restricted most of Lindo's daily activities, eventually ordering her to remain on bed rest until she could conceive and deliver a child. Determined to escape this unfortunate situation, Lindo carefully observed the other people in the household and eventually formed a clever plan to escape her marriage without dishonoring herself, her family and her in-laws. She managed to convince her in-laws that Huang Tyan Yu was actually fated to marry another girl who was already pregnant with his \\"spiritual child\\", and that her own marriage to him would only bring bad luck to the family. The girl she described as his destined wife was, in fact, a mere servant in the household, indeed pregnant but abandoned by her lover. Seeing this as an opportunity for her to be married and living comfortably, the servant girl cheerfully agreed with Lindo. Freed from her first marriage, Lindo decided to emigrate to America. She married a Chinese American man named Tin Jong and has three children: sons Winston and Vincent, and daughter Waverly. Lindo experiences regret over losing some of her Chinese identity by living so long in America (she is treated like a tourist on a visit to China); however, she expresses concern that Waverly's American upbringing has formed a barrier between them. =Ying-Ying \\"Betty\\" St. Clair= From a young age, Ying-Ying is told by her wealthy and conservative family that Chinese girls should be meek and gentle. This is especially difficult for her, as she feels it out of step with her character as a Tiger. She begins to develop a passive personality and represses her feelings as she grows up in Wuxi. Ying-Ying marries a charismatic man named Lin Xiao not out of love, but because she believed it was her fate. Her husband is revealed to be abusive and openly has extramarital affairs with other women. When Ying-Ying discovers she is pregnant, she has an abortion and decides to live with her relatives in a smaller city in China. After ten years, she moves to Shanghai and works in a clothing store, where she meets an American man named Clifford St. Clair. He falls in love with her, but Ying-Ying cannot express any strong emotion after her first marriage. He courts her for four years, and she agrees to marry him after learning that Lin Xiao had died, which she takes as the proper sign to move on. She allows Clifford to control most aspects of her life; he mistranslates her words and actions, and even changes her name to \\"Betty\\". Ying-Ying gives birth to her daughter, Lena, after moving to San Francisco with St. Clair. When Lena is around ten years old, Ying-Ying becomes pregnant a third time, but the baby boy is anencephalic and soon dies. Ying-Ying is horrified when she realises that Lena, a Tiger like herself, has inherited or emulated her passive behaviors and trapped herself in a loveless marriage with a controlling husband. She finally resolves to call upon the more assertive qualities of her Tiger nature, to appeal to those qualities in Lena. She will tell Lena her story in the hope that she will be able to break free from the same passivity that ruined most of her young life back in China. Daughters =Jing-Mei \\"June\\" Woo= Jing-Mei has never fully understood her mother and seems directionless in life. During Jing's childhood, her mother used to tell her that she could be anything she wants; however, she particularly wanted her daughter to be gifted, a child star who amazes the world, like Ginny Tiu (seen briefly on television) or June's rival Waverly. At the beginning of the novel, June is chosen to replace her mother's seat in the Joy Luck Club after her mother's death. At the end of the novel, June is still trying to deal with her mother's death, and she visits China to see the twin half-sisters (Wang Chwun Yu and Wang Chwun Hwa) whom her mother had been forced to abandon when the Japanese attacked China. Only when she visits China to meet her half-sisters and tell them about their mother, Jing- Mei finally accepts her Chinese heritage and makes her peace with her mother. One critic has suggested that the reason for the communication gap between Jing-Mei and her mother, and between the other daughters and their mothers‚Äîa major theme of the novel‚Äîoccurs because the mothers come from a high context culture and the Americanized daughters from a low context culture. The mothers believe that the daughters will intuitively understand their cryptic utterances, but the daughters don't understand them at all. =Rose Hsu Jordan= Rose is somewhat passive and is a bit of a perfectionist. She had an unsettling childhood experience when her youngest brother, Bing, drowned while she was supposed to be watching him, and his body was never recovered. Rose marries a doctor, Ted Jordan, who loves her but also wants to spite his snooty, racist mother. After a malpractice suit, Ted has a mid-life crisis and decides to leave Rose. Rose confides in her mother and An-mei tells her the story of her own childhood. When Ted comes for the divorce papers, Rose finds her voice and tells him that he can't just throw her out of his life, comparing herself to his garden, once so beloved, now unkempt and full of weeds. An-Mei tells her that Ted has been cheating on her, which Rose thinks is absurd, but she later discovers this to be true. She hires a good lawyer and fights for possession of the house, which she eventually wins. This forces Ted to take Rose more seriously and not continue taking her for granted. It's unknown if they ever reconciled. =Waverly Jong= Chinatown Waverly is an independent-minded and intelligent woman, but is annoyed by her mother's constant criticism. Well into her adult life, she finds herself restrained by her subconscious fear of letting her mother down. During their childhood, June and Waverly become childhood rivals; their mothers constantly compared their daughters' development and accomplishments. Waverly was once a gifted chess champion, but quit after feeling that her mother was using her daughter's talent to show off, taking credit for Waverly's wins. Waverly does not necessarily understand the origin of her mother's comments or what context for which they are intended. Waverly is ‚Äúunable to feel at home in‚Ä¶ [her] relationship with [her] mother.\\"Wood, Michelle Gaffner. \\"Negotiating the Geography of Mother-Daughter Relationships in Amy Tan's The Joy Luck Club.\\" The Midwest Quarterly, no. 1, 2012, p. 82. She has a daughter, Shoshana, from her first marriage with Marvin Chen, and she is engaged to her boyfriend Rich Schields. When Waverly believes that Lindo will object to her engagement to Rich after a failed dinner party, she discovers her mother had already accepted it. =Lena St. Clair= Throughout Lena's childhood, she gradually becomes her mother's voice and interprets her mother's Chinese words for others. Like her father Clifford, she translates Ying-ying's words to sound more pleasant than what Ying-ying actually says. Ying-ying has taught Lena to beware of consequences, to the extent that Lena visualizes disaster in the taking of any risk. Lena's husband, Harold, is also her boss. He takes the credit for Lena's business and design ideas. He demands financial \\"equality\\" in their marriage. Lena is an associate while Harold is a partner, so he has a larger salary than she does. However, he insists that all household expenses be divided equally between them. Harold believes that by making everything equal, they can make their love equal as well. Lena feels frustrated and powerless. She settles for what Harold tells her is right: ‚Äúin Chinese society‚Ä¶the man is the one who creates the rules and the woman‚Ä¶ has no choice [except] obeying these rules.\\"Tanritanir, B√ºlent Cercis, and Gamze G√∂r√ºr√ºm. \\"Struggle for an Identity in Amy Tan's The Joy Luck Club.\\" Journal of International Social Research, vol. 10, no. 48, Feb. 2017, pp. 123‚Äì128. Harold's act of dictatorship over Lena could be the reason for her created self-doubt: \\"in‚Ä¶patriarchy, men possess the highest status... so that women's position is subordinate to them.\\"Afandi, Mujad Didien. \\"The Shift in Gender Roles in Amy Tan's The Joy Luck Club and Khaled Hosseini's The Kite Runner.\\" Lensa, Dan Budaya, vol. 8, no. 1, 2018. pp 1-21. She is like her mother, like a ghost, and her mother wants to help her regain her spirit and stand up for herself. When Ying-Ying breaks a leg from a table belonging to Harold, Lena finally admitted she's unhappy in her marriage including how frustrated she is with him for taking credit for her business and design ideas. Ying-Ying encourages her to leave Harold and not come back until he treats her with more respect. Reception While The Joy Luck Club earned high praise, it also received criticism for perpetuating racist stereotypes about Asian Americans. Literary figures such as Chinese American author Frank Chin said that it depicted Chinese culture as backwards, cruel, and misogynistic. He attributed the popularity of The Joy Luck Club to playing up racist stereotypes welcomed in mainstream America. He also noted that it lacks authenticity for its fabricated Chinese folk tales that depict \\"Confucian culture as seen through the interchangeable Chinese/Japanese/Korean/Vietnamese mix (depending on which is the yellow enemy of the moment) of Hollywood.\\" Harvard Crimson writer, Allen Soong, reflected that \\"while the women ... are fully fleshed-out characters who are a remarkable improvement over the \\"exotic Oriental\\" Cassandra from \\"Wayne's World,\\" the male characters are merely additions to the long list of negative images of Asian men in our culture.\\" Novelist Nancy Willard, in a somewhat positive critique, said that \\"Amy Tan's special accomplishment in this novel is not her ability to show us how mothers and daughters hurt each other, but how they love and ultimately forgive each other.\\" Throughout this novel, it is noted that judgements of loved ones begin to ‚Äú[paralyze the mothers] by past secrets of pain and sacrifice‚Äù which have come from their upbringings.Manjula, M., and Govindaraj, C. ‚ÄúThe Challenges of Cultural Translation and the Problems of Immigrant Identity in Amy Tan‚Äôs The Joy Luck Club.‚Äù Language in India, vol. 18, no. 12, Dec. 2018, pp. 184‚Äì188. In Amy Tan's novel The Joy Luck Club, she illustrates that even when immigrating to the United States, it can be hard to lose the culture of China itself. The past experiences that the mothers in this novel have been through as well as the fragile relationships that they have with their daughters results in a loss of identity for all of them. The act of losing individuality continues through multiple generations because the mothers in Tan's story ‚Äúnever offer concrete anecdotes to teach [their daughters]‚Äù about their feelings and their pasts.Manjula, M., and Govindaraj, C. ‚ÄúThe Challenges of Cultural Translation and the Problems of Immigrant Identity in Amy Tan‚Äôs The Joy Luck Club.‚Äù Language in India, vol. 18, no. 12, Dec. 2018, pp. 184‚Äì188. The daughters spend a large portion of their lives feeling lost and trying to understand their place in society. Their ‚Äúsearch for an essential Chinese identity‚Ä¶ always frustrate[d] their attempts to understand‚Ä¶ their identities.\\"Wood, Michelle Gaffner. ‚ÄúNegotiating the Geography of Mother-Daughter Relationships in Amy Tan‚Äôs The Joy Luck Club.‚Äù The Midwest Quarterly, no. 1, 2012, p. 82.

Petco Park, home of the San Diego Padres is located one block away in downtown San Diego's East Village. The area is listed as a historic district on the National Register of Historic Places as Gaslamp Quarter Historic District. Its main period of development began in 1867, when Alonzo Horton bought the land in hopes of creating a new city center closer to the bay, and chose 5th Avenue as its main street. After a period of urban decay, the neighborhood underwent urban renewal in the 1980s and 1990s. The Gaslamp Quarter extends from Broadway to Harbor Drive, and from 4th to 6th Avenue, covering 16¬Ω blocks. It includes 94 historic buildings, most of which were constructed in the Victorian Era, and are still in use with active tenants including restaurants, shops and nightclubs. \\"Gaslamp District\\" is the more commonly used name of the neighborhood by local San Diegans, while \\"Gaslamp Quarter\\", despite being on the entryway arch and all official city signage and banners, is rarely used by locals. The use of \\"Gaslamp District\\" is so pervasive by locals that it has become a shibboleth to determine who is a local San Diegan and who is a tourist. History Corner in the Quarter When development of the area began in the 1860s, the area currently known as the Gaslamp Quarter was known as New Town, in contrast to Old Town, which was the original Spanish colonial settlement of San Diego. Though Gaslamps were not the main source of lighting in the district, it was chosen as the symbol for the \\"Gaslamp Quarter\\" during the redevelopment and preservation efforts that occurred during the 1980s. In actuality, the main source of lighting was arc lighting. Four new gaslamps have been installed at the intersection of Market Street and 5th Avenue. Timeline *1850: William Heath Davis bought in what would eventually become the Gaslamp Quarter. Despite heavy investment from Davis, little development happened in this period. *1867: Real estate developer Alonzo Horton arrived in San Diego and purchased of land in New Town for $265. Major development began in the Gaslamp Quarter. *1880s to 1900s: Known as the Stingaree, the area was home to many saloons, gambling halls, and bordellos. *1950s-1970s: The decaying Gaslamp Quarter became known as a \\"Sailor's Entertainment\\" district, with a high concentration of pornographic theaters, bookshops and massage parlors. *1970: Public interest in preserving buildings downtown started, especially in Gaslamp Quarter. *1976: The city adopted the Gaslamp Quarter Urban Design and Development Manual, aimed at preserving buildings in the area, and the redevelopment of Gaslamp Quarter as a national historic district. *1982: Gaslamp Quarter became the major focus of the redevelopments in downtown by the city of San Diego.

A structural insulated panel, or structural insulating panel, (SIP), is a form of sandwich panel used in the construction industry. SIP is a sandwich structured composite, consisting of an insulating layer of rigid core sandwiched between two layers of structural board, used as a building material. The board can be sheet metal, plywood, cement, magnesium oxide board (MgO) or oriented strand board (OSB), and the core can either be expanded polystyrene foam (EPS), extruded polystyrene foam (XPS), polyisocyanurate foam, polyurethane foam, or be composite honeycomb (HSC). SIPs share the same structural properties as an I-beam or I-column. The rigid insulation core of the SIP acts as a web, while the sheathing fulfills the function of the flanges. SIPs combine several components of conventional building, such as studs and joists, insulation, vapor barrier and air barrier. They can be used for many different applications, such as exterior wall, roof, floor and foundation systems.  History  Standard OSB with EPS core Structural Insulated Panel Although foam-core panels gained attention in the 1970s, the idea of using stress skinned panels for construction began in the 1930s. Research and testing of the technology was done primarily by Forest Products Laboratory (FPL) in Madison, Wisconsin as part of a U.S. Forest Service attempt to conserve forest resources. In 1937, a small stressed-skin house was constructed and garnered enough attention to bring in First Lady Eleanor Roosevelt to dedicate the house. In a testament to the durability of such panel structures, it has endured the severe Wisconsin climate and was used by University of Wisconsin‚ÄìMadison as a day care center up until 1998 when it was removed to make way for a new Pharmacy School building. With the success of the stress skinned panels, it was suggested stronger skins could take all of the structural load and eliminate the frame altogether. Thus in 1947, structural insulated panel development began when corrugated paperboard cores were tested with various skin materials of plywood, tempered hardboard and treated paperboard. The building was dismantled in 1978 and most of the panels retained their original strength with the exception of paperboard which is unsuited to outdoor exposure. Panels consisting of polystyrene core and paper overlaid with plywood skins were used in a building in 1967 and the panels have performed well to the present day. SIP systems were used by Woods Constructors of Santa Paula, California in their homes and apartments from 1965 until 1984. This work was the basis for John Thomas Woods, Paul Flather Woods, John David Woods, and Frederick Thomas Woods when they used a similar concept to patent the Footing Form for Modular homes (US Patent #4817353) issued on April 4, 1989. Numerous homes in Santa Paula, Fillmore, Palm Springs, and surrounding areas use SIP panels as the primary method of construction. The design was awarded approval from (then) ICBO and SBCCI, now ICC.  Materials  SIPs are most commonly made of OSB panels sandwiched around a foam core made of expanded polystyrene (EPS), extruded polystyrene (XPS) or rigid polyurethane foam. Other materials can be used in replacement of OSB, such as plywood, pressure-treated plywood for below-grade foundation walls, steel,Engineering and Architectural Design Guidelines.pdf aluminum, cement board such as Hardiebacker, and even exotic materials like stainless steel, fiber-reinforced plastic, and magnesium oxide. Some SIPs use fiber- cement or plywood sheets for the panels, and agricultural fiber, such as wheat straw, for the core. The third component in SIPs is the spline or connector piece between SIP panels. Dimensional lumber is commonly used but creates thermal bridging and lowers insulation values. To maintain higher insulation values through the spline, manufacturers use Insulated Lumber, Composite Splines, Mechanical Locks, Overlapping OSB Panels, or other creative methods. Depending on the method selected, other advantages such as full nailing surfaces or increased structural strength may become available.  Methods of manufacturing  SIP's are most often manufactured in a traditional factory. Processing equipment is used to regulate pressures and heat in a uniform and consistent manner. There are two main processing methods which correspond to the materials used for the SIP Panel core. When manufacturing a panel with a polystyrene core both pressure and heat are required to ensure the bonding glue has penetrated and set completely. Although a number of variations exist, in general, the foam core is first covered with an adhesive and the skin is set in place. The three pieces are set into a large clamping device and pressure and heat are applied. The three pieces must stay in the clamping device until the glue has cured. When manufacturing a panel with a polyurethane core pressure and heat are both generated from the expansion of the foam during the foaming process. The skins are set in a large clamping device which functions as a mold. The skins must be held apart from each other to allow the liquid polyurethane materials to flow into the device. Once in the device, the foam begins to rise. The mold/press is generally configured to withstand the heat and the pressures generated from the chemical foaming. The SIP Panel is left in the mold/press to cure slightly and when removed will continue to cure for several days. Until recently, both of these processes required a factory setting. However, recent advancements have presented an alternative with SIP Panel processing equipment that allows SIP Panels to be manufactured on the job-site. This is welcome news for builders in developing countries where the technology may be best suited to reduce greenhouse emissions and improve sustainability in housing but are unavailable.  Benefits and drawbacks  The use of SIPs brings many benefits and some drawbacks compared to a conventional framed building. The cost of SIPs are higher than the materials for a comparable framed building in the United States; however, this may not be true elsewhere. A well-built home using SIPs will have a tighter building envelope and the walls will have higher insulating properties, which leads to fewer draughts and a decrease in operating costs. Also, due to the standardized and all-in-one nature of SIPs, construction time can be less than for a frame home, as well as requiring fewer tradespeople. The panels can be used as floor, wall, and roof, with the use of the panels as floors being of particular benefit when used above an uninsulated space below. As a result, the total life-cycle cost of a SIP- constructed building will, in general, be lower than for a conventional framed one‚Äîby as much as 40%. Whether the total construction cost (materials and labor) is lower than for conventional framing appears to depend on the circumstances, including local labor conditions and the degree to which the building design is optimized for one or the other technology. An OSB skinned system structurally outperforms conventional stick framed construction in some cases; primarily in axial load strength. SIPs maintain similar versatility to stick framed houses when incorporating custom designs. Also, since SIPs work as framing, insulation, and exterior sheathing, and can come precut from the factory for the specific job, the exterior building envelope can be built quite quickly. SIPs panels also tend to be lightweight and compact which aids this offsite construction. The environmental performance of SIPs, moreover, is very good due to their exceptional thermal insulation. They also offer a resistance to damp and cold problems like compression shrinkage and cold bridging that cannot be matched by timber and more traditional building materials. When tested under laboratory conditions, the SIP, included in a wall, foundation, floor, or roof system, is installed in a steady-state (no air infiltration) environment; systems incorporating fiberglass insulation are not installed in steady-state environments as they require ventilation to remove moisture. With the exception of structural metals, such as steel, all structural materials creep over time. In the case of SIPs, the creep potential of OSB faced SIPs with EPS or polyurethane foam cores has been studied and creep design recommendations exist.Taylor, S.B, Manbeck, H.B, Janowiak, J.J, Hiltunum, D.R. \\"Modeling Structural Insulated Panel (SIP) Flexural Creep Deflection.\\" J. Structural Engineering, Vol. 123, No. 12, December, 1997.3NTA IM 14 TIP 01, Engineered Design Guide Using NTA Listing Report Data. NTA, Inc. Nappanee, IN. 3/19/2009, 12 pg. The long-term effects of using unconventional facing and core materials require material specific testing to quantify creep design values.  Dimensions and characteristics  In the United States, SIPs tend to come in sizes from 4 feet (1.22 m) to 24 feet (7.32 m) in width. Elsewhere, typical product dimensions are 300, 600, or 1,200 mm wide and 2.4, 2.7, and 3 m long, with roof SIPs up to 6 m long. Smaller sections ease transportation and handling, but the use of the largest panel possible will create the best insulated building. At 15‚àí20 kg/m2, longer panels can become difficult to handle without the use of a crane to position them, and this is a consideration that must be taken into account due to cost and site limitations. Also of note is that when needed for special circumstances longer spans can often be requested, such as for a long roof span. Typical U.S. height for panels is eight or nine feet (2.44 to 2.75 m). Panels come in widths ranging from 4 to 12 inches thick and a rough cost is $4‚Äì$6/ft2 in the U.S. In 4Q 2010, new methods of forming radius, sine curve, arches and tubular SIPs were commercialized. Due to the custom nature and technical difficulty of forming and curing specialty shapes, pricing is typically three or four times that of standard panels per foot. EPS is the most common of the foams used and has an R-value (thermal resistance) of about 4 ¬∞F¬∑ft2¬∑h/BTU (equivalent to about 0.7 K¬∑m2/W) per 25 mm thickness, which would give the of foam in a panel an R value of 13.8 (caution: extrapolating R-values over thickness may be imprecise due to non-linear thermal properties of most materials). This at face value appears to be comparable to an R-13 batt of fiberglass, but because in a standard stick frame house there is significantly more wall containing low R value wood that acts as a cold bridge, the thermal performance of the R-13.8 SIP wall will be considerably better. The air sealing features of SIP homes resulted in the Environmental Protection Agency's Energy Star program to establish an inspection protocol in lieu of the typically required blower door test to assess the home's air leakage. This serves to speed the process and save the builder/homeowner money.  Standardization and design  prefabricated modular house (Click here for a time-lapse video) The International Building Code references APA, Plywood Design Specification 4‚ÄîDesign & Fabrication of Plywood Sandwich Panels for the design of SIPs.APA. Plywood Design Specification Supplement 4: Design and Fabrication of Plywood Sandwich Panels. Document U814-H. March 1990. This document addressed the basic engineering mechanics of SIP panels but does not provide design properties for the panels provided by any specific manufacturer. In 2007, prescriptive design provisions for OSB faced SIPs were first introduced in the 2006 International Residential Code. These provisions provide guidance on the use of SIPs as walls panels only. Aside from these non-proprietary standards, the SIP industry has relied heavily on proprietary code evaluation reports. In early 2009, SIPA partnered with NTA Inc, a product certification agency, to produce the first industry wide code report which is available to all SIPA members who qualify. Unlike previous code reports, the prescriptive provisions provided in the SIPA code report are derived from an engineering design methodology which permits the design professional to consider loading conditions not addressed in the code report.SIPA code report SIPA code report requirements at SIPA web site  References  External links * SIPA The Structural Insulated Panel Association - Structural Insulated Panel Association. * IADDIC Shelters - New Advancements in Field Operable SIP Panel manufacturing equipment. * Structural Panels Inc. - Canadian Structural Insulated Panel Manufacturer Building engineering Building insulation materials Building materials Composite materials ","title":"Structural insulated panel"},{"id":"699441","text":"AvidyƒÅ is a Sanskrit word whose literal meaning is ignorance, misconceptions, misunderstandings, incorrect knowledge, and it is the opposite of Vidya. It is used extensively in Hindu texts, including the Upanishads, and in other Indian religions such as Buddhism and Jainism, particularly in the context of metaphysical reality. AvidyƒÅ, in all Dharmic systems, represents fundamental ignorance and misperception of the phenomenal world. However, the Indian religions disagree on the details, for example with Hinduism considering a denial and misconceptions of Atman (soul, self) as a form of Avidya, and Buddhism considering the denial and misconceptions of An-atman (non-soul, non- self) as a form of Avidya.  Etymology and meaning  AvidyƒÅ (‡§Ö‡§µ‡§ø‡§¶‡•ç‡§Ø‡§æ) is a Vedic Sanskrit word, and is a compound of \\"a\\" and \\"vidya\\", meaning \\"not vidya\\". The word vidya is derived from the Sanskrit root Vid, which means \\"to know, to perceive, to see, to understand\\". Therefore, avidya means to \\"not know, not perceive, not understand\\". The Vid*-related terms appears extensively in the Rigveda and other Vedas. Avidya is usually rendered as \\"ignorance\\" in English translations of ancient Indian texts, sometimes as \\"spiritual ignorance\\". The word avidyƒÅ is derived from the Proto-Indo-European root *weid-, meaning \\"to see\\" or \\"to know\\". It is a cognate of Latin vidƒìre (which would turn to \\"video\\") and English \\"wit\\". While Avidya found in Indian philosophies is translated as \\"ignorance\\", states Alex Wayman, this is a mistranslation because Avidya means more than ignorance. He suggests the term \\"unwisdom\\" to be a better rendition. The term includes not only ignorance out of darkness, but also obscuration, misconceptions, mistaking illusion to be reality or impermanent to be permanent or suffering to be bliss or non-self to be self (delusions). Incorrect knowledge is another form of Avidya, states Wayman. Avidya represents fundamental ignorance, state Jones and Ryan, a misperception of the phenomenal world. In Hinduism, Avidya includes confusing the mundane reality to be the only reality, and it as a permanent though it is ever changing. Its doctrines assert that there is a spiritual reality consisting of Atman-Brahman, one that is the true, eternal, imperishable reality beyond time.[a] M Hiriyanna (2000), The Essentials of Indian Philosophy, Motilal Banarsidass, , pp. 25, 160-161; [b] Wendy Doniger O'Flaherty (1986), Dreams, Illusion, and Other Realities, University of Chicago Press, , pages 118-119Lynn Foulston and Stuart Abbott (2009), Hindu Goddesses: Beliefs and Practices, Sussex Academic Press, , pages 14-16 Texts Avidya in the earliest Vedic texts is ignorance, and in later Vedic texts evolves to include anything that is a \\"positive hindrance\\" to spiritual or nonspiritual knowledge. In the Upanishads, the concept includes \\"lack of knowledge, inadequate knowledge and false knowledge\\". In Advaita Vedanta The effect of avidya is to suppress the real nature of things and present something else in its place. In effect it is not different from Maya (pronounced MƒÅyƒÅ) or illusion. Avidya relates to the individual Self (ƒÄtman), while Maya is an adjunct of the cosmic Self (Brahman). In both cases it connotes the principle of differentiation of an experienced reality into the subject ('I') and an object, as is implicit in human thinking. Avidya stands for that delusion which breaks up the original unity (refer: nonduality) of what is real and presents it as subject and object and as doer and result of the deed. What keeps humanity captive in Samsara is this avidya. This ignorance,\\"the ignorance veiling our true self and the truth of the world\\", is not lack of erudition; it is ignorance about the nature of 'Being' (Sat). It is a limitation that is natural to human sensory or intellectual apparatus. This is responsible for all the misery of humanity. Advaita Vedanta holds that the eradication of it should be humanity's only goal and that will automatically mean realisation of the Self (ƒÄtman). Adi Shankara says in his Introduction to his commentary on the Brahma Sutras, \\"Owing to an absence of discrimination, there continues a natural human behaviour in the form of 'I am this' or 'This is mine'; this is avidya. It is a superimposition of the attributes of one thing on another. The ascertainment of the nature of the real entity by separating the superimposed thing from it is vidya (knowledge, illumination)\\". In Shankara's philosophy avidya cannot be categorized either as 'absolutely existent' or as 'absolutely non-existent'.

Early life Pickering was born in Laurel, Mississippi. His father is Judge Charles Pickering Sr., a Mississippi lawyer, former municipal judge, retired Federal judge, and prominent Republican politician. He graduated from the University of Mississippi where he was a legacy member of the Eta chapter of Sigma Chi. He went on to receive a master's degree from Baylor University in 1989. Early political career Pickering served as a Southern Baptist missionary to Hungary, after the end of Hungarian government persecution of religious believers. In 1989, President George H. W. Bush appointed Pickering as a Department of Agriculture liaison to the former European Communist countries. From 1992 to 1996, Pickering served on the staff of Senator Trent Lott. Pickering helped shape the Telecommunications Act of 1996, the first major overhaul of US telecoms law since 1934.Stennis Center, Chip Pickering profile , accessed 1 August 2009 After a year at the Senate Commerce Committee, Pickering ran for Congress as a family values conservative. U.S. House of Representatives Committee assignments *Energy and Commerce Committee **Commerce, Trade and Consumer Protection Subcommittee **Energy and Air Quality Subcommittee **Telecommunications & the Internet Subcommittee Elections Pickering returned to Mississippi to run as the Republican candidate for the 3rd District in 1996 following the retirement of 30-year incumbent Democrat Sonny Montgomery. He finished first in a crowded seven-way primary with 24 percent of the vote, and then defeated Bill Crawford in the runoff with 56 percent of the vote. In the general election, he defeated Democratic attorney John Eaves by a wide margin, taking 61 percent of the vote. The 3rd had been trending Republican for some time; it has only supported the official Democratic presidential candidate for president once since 1956. Although Montgomery usually faced \\"sacrificial lamb\\" candidates even in years when Republican presidential candidates carried the district in landslides, it had been considered very likely that he would be succeeded by a Republican once he retired. Questions were raised by political opponents about whether Pickering was a legal resident of Mississippi and lawfully qualified to run for the office. He claimed his farm in Madison County, outside Madison, as his official residence, but his permanent residence was in the Washington area. Pickering was reelected five times. He was unopposed for reelection in 1998 and defeated an underfunded Democrat in 2000. He only faced substantive opposition in 2002. Mississippi lost a district after the 2000 census, and the 3rd absorbed a large slice of the Jackson-based 4th district, held by second-term Democrat Ronnie Shows. However, Pickering retained over 60 percent of his former territory, and defeated Shows with 63 percent of the vote. He was reelected without major- party opposition in 2004 and 2006. Tenure Pickering had a strongly conservative voting record. From 2003 to 2007, he served as vice-chairman of the Energy and Commerce Committee. When Lott announced his resignation as Senator in November 2007, Pickering was rumored to be Mississippi Governor Haley Barbour's choice to replace him, but those rumors were soon discovered to have been placed by the candidate himself. However, in December of that year, Pickering announced that he was not interested in the post. Fellow Republican Congressman Roger Wicker of was appointed to Lott's seat. Pickering retired from the House in January 2009 and is currently a lobbyist for Cellular South. Personal life Pickering and his ex-wife, Leisha, have five sons. In June 2008, Pickering filed for divorce from his wife. Leisha Pickering filed a lawsuit against Chip Pickering's alleged mistress for alienation of affection, \\"claiming their adulterous relationship ruined the Pickerings' marriage and his political career.\\" On December 7, 2009, Pickering was involved in a dispute with the coach of a youth soccer team that coached against his son's team, and was charged with simple assault. He was sued by the coach in December 2010. Pickering is the cousin of former Mississippi state auditor Stacey Pickering.

Released for the Apple II, TRS-80 Color Computer, and DOS, it has been described as the hardest computer game of all time. The player is readying himself for bed when, suddenly, he falls through the floor into an underground city of robots, Robotropolis. The player begins in the sewers of the city with three programmable robots, and must make his way to the top of the city to try to find his way home again. Gameplay The aim of Robot Odyssey is to program and control robots (Sparky, Checkers, and Scanner with a fourth added in later levels) in order to escape Robotropolis, a labyrinthine underground city filled with hundreds of rooms of puzzles that need to be solved to progress any further. The city consists of five levels of increasing difficulty, requiring the design of more and more sophisticated circuits. A tutorial and robot testing laboratory (the Innovation lab) are also provided with the game. Except for their color and initial programming, the three robots are identical inside. They are equipped with four thrusters and bumper sensors, a grabber, a radio antenna (for basic communication with other robots), a battery, and a periscope to use while riding inside a robot. Throughout the game, the player is presented with various challenges which require programming the three robots to accomplish various tasks. This is done by wiring a synchronous digital circuit, consisting of logic gates and flip- flops, inside of the robots. Tasks and puzzles range from navigating a simple maze and retrieving items to complex tasks requiring interaction and communication between two or more robots. Though the player can ride inside the robots, most challenges involve the robots acting autonomously and cannot be completed with the player inside (and perhaps simply rewiring their robot on the fly). The robots can also be wired up to chips, which provide a convenient and reproducible way to program the robots. Various pre-programmed chips are scattered throughout the city and range from complex circuits such as a wall-hugging chip which can be used to navigate through mazes and corridors (one of which is wired to a robot at the beginning) to clocks and counters. The player must find out how these chips work themselves, as the only information about each chip is a short, and sometimes cryptic, description. Additionally, there are predesigned chip files stored on the various disks containing the game that can be loaded into the in-game chips. The available chips stored in this fashion vary depending on the port or version used. The Innovation Lab can be used to test out circuit designs in the robots or create new chips. Chips created in the lab can then be loaded into and used in the main game. Loading a chip in the main game will erase the previous programming stored in the chip. Although the game is recommended for ages 10 and up, it can prove to be quite challenging even for adults. In terms of educational value, the game teaches the basic concepts of electrical engineering and digital logic in general. Similar games The engine for the game was written by Warren Robinett, and variants of it were used in many of The Learning Company's graphical adventure games of the time, including Rocky's Boots, Gertrude's Secrets, Gertrude's Puzzles, and Think Quick!, all of which are similar but easier logic puzzle games. The gameplay and visual design were derived from Robinett's influential Atari 2600 video game, Adventure. Carnage Heart involves programming mechas that then fight without any user input. Cognitoy's MindRover is a relatively recent game which is similar in spirit to Robot Odyssey, but uses different programming concepts in its gameplay. ChipWits by Doug Sharp and Mike Johnston, a game for the Apple II, Macintosh, and Commodore 64 computers is similar in both theme and implementation, although the interface to program your robot differed. Epsitec Games created Colobot and Ceebot in recent years for Windows machines which are in many ways spiritual successors to Robot Odyssey. In these games the player program machines to accomplish puzzle tasks. Instead of using logic flops, switches, etc., these two games instead teach the player the fundamentals of object oriented programming like Java, C++, or C#. One Girl One Laptop productions created a spiritual successor called Gate which uses the same digital logic puzzles as Robot Odyssey.

At the time, it was most frequently used to describe public skepticism about the Lyndon B. Johnson administration's statements and policies on the Vietnam War. It was used in journalism as a euphemism for recognized lies told to the public by politicians. Today, it is used more generally to describe almost any \\"gap\\" between an actual situation and what politicians and government agencies say about it. History The term \\"credibility gap\\" came against a background of the use of the term \\"missile gap\\", which the Oxford English Dictionary lists as first being used by then-Senator John F. Kennedy on 14 August 1958, when he stated: \\"Our Nation could have afforded, and can afford now, the steps necessary to close the missile gap.\\" \\"Doomsday gap\\" and \\"mineshaft gap\\" were the imagined post-apocalyptic continuations of this paranoia in the 1964 Cold War satire Dr. Strangelove. The term \\"credibility gap\\" was widely in use as early as 1963, according to Timetables of History. Prior to its association with the Vietnam War, in December 1962, at the annual meeting of the U.S. Inter-American Council, Senator Kenneth B. Keating (R-N.Y.) praised President John F. Kennedy's prompt action in the Cuban Missile Crisis, but he said there was an urgent need for the United States to plug the \\"credibility gap\\" in U.S. policy on Cuba.(Source: Associated Press article dated December 10, 1962, available online at NewspaperArchive.com.) It was popularized in 1966 by J. William Fulbright, a Democratic Senator from Arkansas, when he could not get a straight answer from President Johnson's Administration regarding the war in Vietnam. \\"Credibility gap\\" was first used in association with the Vietnam War in the New York Herald Tribune in March 1965, to describe then-president Lyndon Johnson's handling of the escalation of American involvement in the war. A number of events--particularly the surprise Tet Offensive, and later the 1971 release of the Pentagon Papers--helped to confirm public suspicion that there was a significant \\"gap\\" between the administration's declarations of controlled military and political resolution, and the reality. These were viewed as examples of Johnson's and later Richard Nixon's duplicity. Throughout the war, Johnson worked with his officials to ensure that his public addresses would only disclose bare details of the war to the American public. During the war the country grew more and more aware of the credibility gap especially after Johnson's speech at Johns Hopkins University in April 1965.Vietnam and America edited by Marvin E. Gettleman, Jane Franklin, Marilyn Young and H. Bruce Franklin An example of public opinion appeared in The New York Times concerning the war. \\"The time has come to call a spade a bloody shovel. This country is in an undeclared and unexplained war in Vietnam. Our masters have a lot of long and fancy names for it, like escalation and retaliation, but it is a war just the same.\\" The advent of the presence of television journalists allowed by the military to report and photograph events of the war within hours or days of their actual occurrence in an uncensored manner drove the discrepancy widely referred to as \\"the credibility gap.\\" Later usage After the Vietnam War, the term \\"credibility gap\\" came to be used by political opponents in cases where an actual, perceived or implied discrepancy existed between a politician's public pronouncements and the actual, perceived or implied reality. For example, in the 1970s the term was applied to Nixon's own handling of the Vietnam War and subsequently to the discrepancy between evidence of Richard Nixon's complicity in the Watergate break-in and his repeated claims of innocence. Since 2017, the term has been used to describe the Trump administration, particularly in relation to the use of what White House Counsel Kellyanne Conway called alternative facts.

It received favorable attention from other periodicals such as L.A. Weekly, Print, Punk Planet and Rolling Stone. Arthur featured photography and artwork from Spike Jonze, Art Spiegelman, Susannah Breslin, Gary Panter and Godspeed You! Black Emperor. Arthur's regular columnists included Byron Coley, Thurston Moore, Daniel Pinchbeck, Paul Cullum, Douglas Rushkoff, and T-Model Ford. Arthur magazine was particularly drawn to noise music, stoner metal, folk and other types of psychedelia. The first issue of Arthur featured an interview with journalist and author Daniel Pinchbeck (author of Breaking Open the Head); artwork by Alan Moore (Watchmen, From Hell, League of Extraordinary Gentlemen); and an interview with Arthur C. Clarke. Previous to creating the publication, Laris Kreslins created the popular music journals Sound Collector and Audio Review. Jay Babcock was a contributor to Mojo magazine and the L.A. Weekly. Some of the magazine's influences included Joan Didion, Thomas Paine, William Blake, Lester Bangs, Hunter S. Thompson, Tom Wolfe, and Greil Marcus. Arthur magazine also released CDs and DVDs under the imprint of their label (formerly called [Bastet]). On Labor Day weekend in 2005, they curated Arthurfest in Barnsdall Park; in February 2006, Arthur Ball in Echo Park; and in October 2006 Arthur Nights at The Palace Theater, in downtown Los Angeles. On February 25, 2007, it was announced on the magazine's web site that it would be ceasing publication indefinitely. The hiatus was due to a breakdown in negotiations between Lime Publishing (Arthurs original publisher) and another unnamed publisher. In April 2007, it was announced that the magazine would return as Arthur Vol. II in the near future. The magazine resumed publication in September 2007. In June 2008, owner Jay Babcock moved Arthur's headquarters from Los Angeles to New York, the seat of North America's publishing industry. On March 6, 2011, Jay Babcock announced that the magazine would cease to exist in any form as of March 15, 2011, though its archive and store would remain active for an unspecified period thereafter. In November 2012, the Arthur website announced the return of the magazine as of December 22, 2012. However, this resurgence proved to be brief, and in March 2014 the magazine once again announced that its online and print versions would go dormant. As of April 20, 2017, Jay Babcock announced the start of Landline bulletin , a continuation of Arthur Magazine email bulletin. As Babcock describes it, \\"What is this stuff?

Collins was active in the 1990s and was later the Member of Parliament (MP) for Westmorland and Lonsdale in north-west England from 1997 until his defeat at the 2005 general election by Tim Farron, later leader of the Liberal Democrats. Education Collins was educated at Chigwell School, the London School of Economics (BSc) and King's College London (MA).‚ÄòCOLLINS, Timothy William George‚Äô, Who's Who 2014, A & C Black, an imprint of Bloomsbury Publishing plc, 2014 Political career Collins had significant political experience before his election to Parliament. He acted as Press Secretary to the then Prime Minister John Major, serving in that role during the successful 1992 Election campaign. He was a member of the 10 Downing Street Policy Unit and was a speechwriter to Margaret Thatcher, John Major, William Hague, David Hunt, Michael Howard, Chris Patten, Norman Fowler and Brian Mawhinney. Collins was appointed a CBE in the Birthday Honours List in 1996, at the age of 32. The award was given 'for political services'. During his time in Parliament, Collins served as a Whip and later as a Senior Vice Chairman of the Conservative Party. In this role in the run up to the 2001 election Collins was a senior aide to the then Conservative leader William Hague. Collins supported the focus on tax cuts and opposition to the Euro that characterised that campaign. After the election the new Conservative leader Iain Duncan Smith appointed him to the Shadow Cabinet as Cabinet Office Minister later moving him to Shadow Transport Secretary. When Michael Howard became leader in 2003 he was appointed Shadow Secretary of State for Education. In this post he developed policies to give anonymity for accused teachers until a court trial, to allow successful schools to expand and to stop the closure of schools for children with Special Educational Needs. At the 2005 general election he lost his seat to Liberal Democrat Tim Farron. The margin was only 267 votes. It has been suggested that this was due to a Liberal Democrat \\"decapitation\\" strategy which was aimed at unseating senior Conservative candidates. In 2006 he was reported to be part of the so- called \\"A-List\\" of priority parliamentary candidates whom the Conservative leadership most wish to see in Parliament after the next General Election, but, in April 2008, the ConservativeHome websitehttp://conservativehome.blogs.com/goldlist/2009/04/where-are-the- original-alisters-now-those-who-are-no-longer-looking-for-a-seat.html#more reported that he left the Conservative candidate list, quoting him as saying \\"I firmly now do not wish to return to the House of Commons\\".

In the December 2009 edition of PA News, a magazine covering the lobbying industry, Shadow Arts Minister Ed Vaizey MP praised the hiring of Collins, saying he had \\"a huge brain\\" and would be \\"a huge asset\\" to the company. In the same issue, Charles Lewington, MD of consultancy Hanover, said it was \\"a smart hire by Tim Bell\\" while the man who beat Collins in 2005, Liberal Democrat MP Tim Farron, said it was \\"very good news for Bell Pottinger\\". In December 2011, The Independent claimed that Collins had been filmed by the Bureau of Investigative Journalism saying that PM David Cameron had raised a copyright issue with Chinese premier Wen Jiabao on behalf of Dyson Limited \\"because we asked him to\\". Television Collins is a fan of the British science-fiction television programme Doctor Who, and has appeared on television several times to discuss the programme. In a 2003 DVD documentary Putting the Shock into Earthshock (included as part of the BBC Worldwide DVD release of the Doctor Who serial Earthshock), he jokingly stated that the Cybermen were more convincing when the Conservatives were in power. He was also reported to have read The Dying Days in one sitting on the night of the 1997 general election so that he could claim to have read the whole New Adventures series while the Conservatives were in government.https://www.bbc.co.uk/doctorwho/classic/ebooks/dyingdays/intro/page1.shtml, Author's Introduction, Dying Days, Lance Parkin Collins has also appeared as a guest on a number of current affairs programmes since leaving Parliament.

Coloring the regions is explained as assigning fields to bulls and cows, where neighboring fields may not contain cattle of the opposite sex, lest they be distracted from their grazing. Deciding the outcome in Snort is PSPACE-complete on general graphs. This is proven by reducing partizan node Kayles, which is PSPACE-complete, to a game of Snort.

Opened in 1926, it was the primary sports venue in Hawaii preceding Aloha Stadium. Famous athletes who competed in Honolulu Stadium include Babe Ruth, Joe DiMaggio, who hit a home run out of the park in 1944, and Jesse Owens. Irving Berlin performed at Honolulu Stadium in 1945. Elvis Presley performed in 1957 while Billy Graham inspired a capacity crowd a year later. It was the home of the University of Hawaii Rainbows football team, the Hawaiians of the World Football League (WFL) and the Hawaii Islanders of the Pacific Coast League (PCL). The stadium was also the venue for the Poi Bowl and Pineapple Bowl, and a number of world championship boxing matches. It also served as a venue for stock car racing and high school football. During its final years, the stadium could hold about 25,000 fans; it was demolished in 1976. In the baseball configuration, Home plate was in the northwest corner; the third base line ran along King, and left field seating was bounded on the east by Isenberg. Field dimensions mentioned in local newspapers varied somewhat, but the consensus appears to be: left field , right field , and center field . The football field ran parallel to the third base line, but away from the infield; the west end zone was near the first base line and the gridiron ran east-southeast, through right field and center field. The sideline seating for football was in right field and along the third base line. By the 1960s, Honolulu Stadium had long since reached the end of its useful life. It was made mostly of wood and was frequently attacked by termites, resulting in it being nicknamed \\"the Termite Palace.\\" It was replaced by Aloha Stadium in September 1975.

It weaves together the past and the present through the blossoming friendship between Evelyn Couch, a middle-aged housewife, and Ninny Threadgoode, an elderly woman who lives in a nursing home. Every week Evelyn visits Ninny, who tells her stories about her youth in Whistle Stop, Alabama where her sister- in-law, Idgie, and her friend, Ruth, ran a caf√©. These stories, along with Ninny's friendship, enable Evelyn to begin a new, satisfying life while allowing the people and stories of Ninny's youth to live on. The book, which was made into a 1991 film, explores themes of family, aging, lesbianism, and the dehumanizing effects of racism on both blacks and whites. Plot Throughout the novel the narrator and time period change, and the reader relies on the chapters' headings to establish the date and the source of the chapter. Some of the narration comes in the form of the fictional newsletter called \\"The Weems Weekly\\"; other narrations come from the Threadgoodes' house in Birmingham, and omniscient narrations reveal still more. The framing story, set in the mid-1980s, depicts Evelyn Couch, who goes weekly with her husband to visit his mother in a nursing home. On one visit, Evelyn befriends Ninny Threadgoode, another resident of the same home, who tells Evelyn stories of her youth in Whistle Stop in the 1920s. Between subsequent visits, Evelyn assumes the protagonists of these stories as role models. According to Ninny, she was an orphan raised by the Threadgoodes, and eventually married one of their sons; but the principal character throughout her story is the youngest daughter, Idgie (Imogene) Threadgoode: an unrepentant tomboy, became reclusive after her brother, Buddy, was killed on the railway. Ruth Jamison comes to live with the family while teaching at the Vacation Bible School. Idgie gradually becomes enamored of her and is saddened when Ruth leaves Whistle Stop to marry Frank Bennett. Frank turns out to be a violent, abusive man who often beats Ruth. She remains faithful to Frank until her mother's death. Subsequently, Ruth sends Idgie a message, and Idgie, along with several others, rescue her. Intimidated by Big George, the family's handyman and caf√© cook, Frank does not resist. With money from her father, Idgie establishes the Whistle Stop Cafe, with Sipsey (George's adoptive mother) and her daughter-in- law Onzell as cooks, and becomes secondary guardian to Ruth's son, Buddy Jr. (known as 'Stump' after losing an arm in an accident). The caf√© quickly became known to hobos all over the U.S. during the Great Depression as a welcome place to find a meal. The most recurrent is 'Smokey Lonesome' Phillips, who secretly loves Ruth. When Ruth dies of cancer, Idgie is heartbroken. After the railroad yard closes, the cafe (and ultimately the town) ceases operation. Several years later, Idgie and Big George are arrested for Frank Bennett's murder; but the case is dismissed when the local minister, repaying Idgie for helping his son, testifies (falsely) that she and Big George were at a three- day revival when Frank Bennett went missing. Bennett's body was never found, but it is later revealed that Sipsey killed him when he attempted to claim his and Ruth's son. His remains were barbecued by George and fed to the detectives investigating Frank's disappearance. Stump recounts the stories of his guardians to his daughter and granddaughter; Big George's sons, Jasper and Artis [sic], have their own careers: Jasper as a Sleeping Car Porter, and Artis as a gambler. Inspired by these stories, Evelyn starts work outside the home, selling Mary Kay Cosmetics and, at Mrs. Threadgoode's urging, is treated for negative symptoms of menopause. She also confronts various long-held fears. Evelyn becomes happier. While on vacation, she receives a letter from Mrs. Hartman, Mrs. Threadgoode's neighbor, that Mrs. Threadgoode has died and left various trinkets for Evelyn. The novel's conclusion reveals that Idgie and her brother Julian, after Whistle Stop became depopulated, operated a roadside food-stand. Themes Although it is not explicitly labeled as a lesbian relationship, every resident both knows about and accepts Idgie and Ruth's relationship, making lesbianism a theme in the novel. In the film adaptation Ruth had been in love with Buddy Threadgoode, Idgie's brother. The novel also uses Evelyn and Mrs. Threadgoode's characters to examine women's aging. Throughout the novel we see Evelyn going through menopause as well as Mrs. Threadgoode's deterioration in old age. As the novel follows Sipsey's family, it analyzes the stark challenges they and other African Americans faced within their lives throughout society, from the 1920s to the late 1980s. The moral justifications of murder and euthanasia are also touched upon. Food is another literary theme in the novel, to the extent that Flagg included the recipes served by the cafe (including of course their signature fried green tomatoes) at the end of the book. Memories and storytelling are discussed heavily in the novel. Development The \\"Whistle Stop Cafe\\" is loosely based on the Irondale Cafe in Irondale, Alabama, a suburb near Flagg's birthplace. The cafe was bought by Flagg's aunt, Bess Fortenberry, in 1932 and run by herself and two friends for four decades.irondale cafe history It is still in operation and, like the fictional cafe, is known for its fried green tomatoes.FRIED GREEN TOMATOES AT THE IRONDALE CAFE.

Harper Lee gave a recommendation for the book, saying, \\"Airplanes and television have removed the Threadgoodes from the Southern scene. Happily for us, Fannie Flagg has preserved a whole community of them in a richly comic, poignant narrative that records the exuberance of their lives, the sadness of their departure. Idgie Threadgoode is a true original: Huckleberry Finn would have tried to marry her!\\" Film Flagg's novel was turned into a film adaptation.
