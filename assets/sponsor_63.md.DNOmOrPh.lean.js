Life =Early life= From a Lancashire family, he was born at Cork, Ireland on 14 June 1769, the son of James Wright. While still very young he went with his father and the family to Minorca, where he learnt music and French, in both of which he excelled. It may be presumed that he also learnt Spanish. =Early career= Early in 1781 he was entered on board the with (Sir) Roger Curtis, and was for the next two years at Gibraltar during the siege. In 1783, when the Brilliant was paid off, Wright was sent to a school at Wandsworth, where he remained for two years. He was then employed for some time in a merchant's office in the city, and ‚Äî apparently in 1788 ‚Äî was sent ‚Äòon an important commission‚Äô to St. Petersburg. He remained in Russia for the next five years, visiting Moscow and other places, and acquiring a thorough knowledge of the Russian language.Laughton (1900), p. 114 =Naval career= He was introduced to Sir Sidney Smith, and at his request joined the in the spring of 1794 with the rating of midshipman, and apparently doing duty as captain's clerk for Smith, Wright seems to have described himself as ‚Äòthe secretary of his friend.‚Äô After nearly two years on the coast of France, he was with Smith on the night of 18‚Äì19 April 1796, when both were taken prisoner. His confidential relations to Smith secured him the particular attentions of the French government; he was sent with Smith to Paris, was confined in the Temple as a close prisoner, was repeatedly examined as to Smith's designs, and finally effected his escape with Smith in May 1798. He then joined the Tigre, apparently as acting lieutenant, for his commission was not confirmed till 29 March 1800. He continued with Smith throughout the commission at Acre and on the coast of Egypt till promoted, on 7 May 1802, to the sloop , which he took to England. =Recapture and death= On the renewal of the war he was appointed to the brig , in which for the next year he was employed on the coast of France. On the morning of 8 May 1804 he had been blown by stress of weather into Quiberon Bay, and was off the mouth of the Vilaine, when the wind died away. Some seventeen gunboats came out of the river, and surrounded the brig, which the calm rendered almost defenceless against such odds; after being pounded for two hours, the brig was compelled to surrender. Wright was sent to Paris and again confined as a close prisoner in the Temple. He was subjected to repeated examinations as to whether he had not put on shore in France some royalist agents: Georges, Pichegru, Rivi√®re, and others were named. Wright refused to answer to the interrogations; and to this refusal he adhered, in spite of many threats of ill-treatment. After being detained for nearly eighteen months it was announced that he had committed suicide on the night of 27 Oct. 1805. It was immediately said in England that if he was dead he had been murdered; and, in fact, so little was it believed by the authorities that his name was not removed from the navy list till the autumn of 1807. =Investigation= After the Restoration Sir Sidney Smith and others made unofficial inquiries in Paris which were claimed to prove that he was murdered. According to the evidence which Smith collected, the body was found on the bed with the sheet drawn up to the chin, the razor‚Äîwith which the throat had been cut to the bone‚Äîclosed, and the hand which grasped it pressing the thigh. There was some blood about the room, but none on the sheet. Great weight was attached to this and other stories but their evidential value is unclear. It has also been noted that his letters were in good and determined spirit, and no cause for any great depression was shown. An alleged factor ‚Äî the news of Mack's surrender at Ulm ‚Äî is said by some to absurd, especially to a naval officer who had also the news of Trafalgar. On the other hand, it is difficult to see what Bonaparte had to gain by murdering Wright. At St. Helena he pooh-poohed the idea, and said that if he had interfered it would have been to order Wright to be tried as a spy and shot, though nothing in the accepted laws of war would condemn an officer as a spy for landing men who might be objectionable to the enemy's government. In the total absence of trustworthy evidence, and the want of motive for either murder or suicide, it may be suggested that Wright died from natural causes ‚Äî an affection of the heart, for instance ‚Äî and that the French government took a mean revenge on the man who had given them a good deal of trouble by alleging suicide.

The legislature also elected the head of state, or president of the republic. =Somali Democratic Republic= In 1969, following the assassination of Somalia's second president, Abdirashid Ali Shermarke, the military staged a coup on October 21 (the day after Shermarke's funeral), and took over office. The Supreme Revolutionary Council (SRC) that assumed power was led by Major General Siad Barre. Barre shortly afterwards became the head of the SRC. The SRC subsequently renamed the country the Somali Democratic Republic,J. D.

A new Constitution was ratified on August 25, 1979 through a popular referendum, under which elections for a People's Assembly were held. However, Barre's Somali Revolutionary Socialist Party politburo continued to rule. The Constitution of 1979 provided for a presidential system under which the president served as both head of state and head of government. As head of government, the president selected the members of the Council of Ministers, which he chaired. The Constitution of 1979 initially called for the president to be elected to a six-year, renewable term of office by a two-thirds majority vote of the legislature. After Barre's overthrow, a provisional government called for a new Constitution to replace the 1979 document that had been the law of the land at the time of his ouster. Federal Republic of Somalia =Constitutional institutions= The Constitution of the Federal Republic of Somalia promotes human rights, the rule of law, general standards of international law, justice, participatory consultative and inclusive government, the separation of powers between the legislature, executive and an independent judiciary, in order to ensure accountability, efficiency and responsiveness to the interests of the people. The Federal Republic of Somalia is a federal state with a semi-presidential system, where much of the executive power lies with the Prime Minister. Presidency The Somali federal president is the head of state. The presidential powers of the head of state are far reaching and are carried out in accordance with the Constitution and the other laws of the Federal Republic of Somalia. These powers include appointing the head of the executive (Prime Minister), serving as Commander- in-Chief of the Armed Forces and declaring a state of emergency and war. Executive branch The executive power of the federal government is vested in the federal cabinet. The Prime Minister is the head of government. They head the federal Cabinet, consisting of ministers appointed on the Prime Minister's suggestion. The Prime Minister is elected for a full term of 4 years and can only be dismissed by parliament electing a successor in a vote of no confidence. Judicial branch Judicial authority of the Federal Republic is vested in the courts. The judiciary is independent of the legislative and executive branches of government whilst fulfilling its judicial functions. It can declare statutes as null and void if they are in violation of the Federal Constitution. The national court structure consists of: *The Constitutional Court *The Federal Government level courts *The Federal Member State level courts Legislative branch The main body of the legislative branch is Somalia's bicameral parliament, the Federal Parliament, which enacts federal legislation except laws related to the annual budget.

Eucera plumigera, female Description As in most members of the tribe Eucerini, the antennae of males are very long. Old World Eucera can be identified through having five or six maxillary palpomeres, with the first flagellomere shorter than the scape and the clypeus protruding in front of the compound eye by at least the width of the eye in side view. These characteristics are found in both sexes. Additionally, the males have convergent carinae on their sixth ventral abdominal segment (sternite). Eucera species nest in the ground.Michener, C. D. (2007) The bees of the world, second edition. Johns Hopkins University Press, Baltimore and London, 953 pp  Morphology  Eucera have a thick layer of fur and are dark in color. They have a protuberant clypeus and are typically around 0.4 to 0.7 inches long. The size of bees in the genus Eucera range from 11‚Äì18 mm. When emerging from nests, an immature Eucera nigrilabris male will be somewhat red in color and a bit sluggish. A mature Eucera nigrilabris male will appear grey in color and more active. = Sexual dimorphism = In Eucera berlandi, males have long antennae containing three times the amount of neurons for olfaction and ten times more pore plates than females. Distribution Eucera is holarctic.Fauna europaea Research shows that the Eucera complex originated in the Nearctic region in the late Oligocene and dispersed twice. The first dispersal having occurred as far as 24.2-16.6 million years ago during the warmer summer season and later again 13.9-12.3 million years ago during the springtime, allowing Eucera to thrive in cooler regions.  Phylogeny  Eucera belongs to the tribe Eucerini and makes up roughly 50% of the tribe. Historically, the genus had 219 species classified in five subgenera, of which 78 species were known from Europe. However, six genera have recently been added to the genus Eucera as new subgenera: Tetralonia, Peponapis, Syntrichalonia, Cemolobus, Xenoglossodes and Xenoglossa.Eucera aragalli side Eucera aragalli face  Behavior  In the Middle East, Eucera are active in the months of February to May. = Flight behavior = Eucera have a spring flight season. = Nesting behavior = Eucera are solitary bees that nest within the ground. They tend to nest in areas that are composed of clay or sand. It is a characteristic of all bees of the genus Eucera to have vertical and elongated cells within nests. There are around two to three cells per nest, which are found branching off of the main tunnel. In Eucera nigrilabris, each tunnel harbors four to six cells. The first few cells are false cells and are not used for reproductive purposes. The cells below the false cells are used to lay eggs. Also, the entirety of the tunnel is lined with wax. For nesting, Eucera nigrilabris prefers soil of lower sodicity and salinity that has low calcium carbonate concentrations. They make lined nests that are about 85 cm into the ground. There has not been any observed occurrences of kleptoparasitism around Eucera nigrilabris nesting sites. Eucera palaestinae use their Dufour's gland to secrete a mixture of hydrocarbons, methyl esters, and unsaturated fatty acids which provide the nest with an odor. This odor helps the bees locate their home when living in a dense aggregation of nests. = Mating behavior = Eucera kullenbergi is known to fall victim to sexual deception by Ophrys leochroma flowers that mimic the sex pheromones of female bees. Eucera palaestinae live in dense nest aggregations with males emerging from their nests in the ground about a week before the females to take a look around the nesting site. Once the females emerge, males of the species will engage in aggressive competition to mate with them. Shortly after mating, the female becomes unreceptive. The initial attraction towards a female is by sight, but there is additional research suggesting that virgin females are distinguished by their specific scent and therefore are sought after more aggressively. It is thought that the cause of this sex attraction is due to small glands located on tergites on the abdomen. In Eucera nigrilabris, the males also emerge a few days earlier than females. Once the female emerges from the nest, males will fight with each other to mate. Mating time in this species occurs for 3‚Äì6 minutes, and once the female has mated, she becomes unresponsive. = Foraging behaviors = Eucera can be generalists or specialists in foraging preference. They are able to pollinate both agricultural and naturally occurring plants. They pollinate plants in the deserts of Israel and the Mediterranean. Eucera, like other efficient foragers, avoid going back to the same food source after it has been previously depleted. Research suggests that Eucera use a combination of reward-based-patch-leaving rule and scent marking strategy to avoid returning to previously visited sites. Eucera resemble bumblebees in this matter but it is believed that they use different strategies (bumblebees use a numerical strategy) suggesting that the difference in strategies may reflect the lower learning capabilities of solitary bees like Eucera when compared to the social bumblebee. Eucera cinerea has specialized thick bristles that curve and are used for foraging for pollen within flowers that have hidden anthers. Eucera from southwest France are known to mainly forage from Fabaceae and Brassicaceae plants. Peponapis and Xenoglossa are known to be specialists for squash plants, such as Cucurbita pepo. Peponapis pruinosa specializes on squash plants, and so the current distribution of this species in North America is due to the expansion of plant cultivation throughout North America. The species moved from Mesoamerica into the more temperate regions of North America.  Sociality  Eucera, similar to the rest of the tribe Eucerini, are solitary by nature. In some highly eusocial bee species, such as honey bees, males are raised and fed in their colonies. Males of Eucera live their lives independently. = Alarm signaling = Eucera do not produce or respond to alarm pheromones as social bees do. Social bees are able to identify and avoid inflorescences that have the smell of dead bees of their species. This is possibly due to injured social bees releasing signals known as alarm signals to warn others of danger. Eucera do not showcase this behavior of avoiding inflorescences marked by dead bees and instead respond similarly to flowers that have predation alarm signals and flowers that do not have such alarm signals.

He is the chairman of El-Ad Group, which owned the New York Plaza Hotel. He also owns the Israeli conglomerate Delek Group. In 2014, he was listed by Forbes as the seventh wealthiest Israeli. His personal wealth is estimated to be $4.2 billion . Childhood Tshuva was born to a Jewish family in Tripoli, Libya, in 1948. Around this time, his paternal grandfather, Rabbi Yosef (Susu) Tshuva, was murdered in the pogroms in Libya. When Yitzhak Tshuva was six months old, his parents, Rachamin and Julia, and their eight children emigrated to Israel as part of the Jewish exodus from Arab and Muslim countries. They settled near the city of Netanya, initially living in a transit camp. Tshuva studied at the \\"Yavne\\" primary school. At the age of 12, Tshuva began working to support his family by taking on construction and farming jobs. He did his mandatory military service in the Israel Defense Forces in the Engineering Corps. After his service, he began working in the construction and engineering department of the Israeli Defense Ministry, where he was responsible for a variety of construction projects, primarily on military bases all over the country. One of these projects included the construction of fortifications along the Bar Lev Line, near the Suez Canal, after Israel captured the Sinai Peninsula from Egypt in the 1967 Six-Day War.  Career  = Beginnings = In the 1970s, Tshuva became a developer of low-income neighborhoods, primarily in his home town of Netanya. He was involved in the construction of hundreds of apartments in the city. In 1978, Tshuva joined local politics by founding the \\"Manof\\" party. At the 1978 municipal elections, Manof won three seats in the Netanya city council. In his capacity as member of the Netanya city council, Yitzhak Tshuva was in charge of construction, development, and neighborhood restoration. In the 1980s, Tshuva initiated a number of large residency and commercial projects across Israel. In 1988, Yitzhak Tshuva and his family immigrated to the United States for a number of years. During this time, he was involved in the construction of many real estate projects in New Jersey and New York City. = El Ad holdings = In 1992, Tshuva founded El Ad Holdings (also known as El Ad Group) which manages the majority of his real estate transactions in North America. In the mid 1990s, El Ad Group purchased thousands of residential and commercial properties in New York and Florida, and in the Canadian cities of Toronto and Montreal. It also purchased thousands of rental properties on the west coast of the United States. In 2004, El Ad Group purchased the Plaza Hotel in New York City for $675mn from the Saudi investor, Al-Waleed bin Talal. El Ad Group sold 182 residential apartments prior to the hotel's renewed opening in 2008. Apartments were sold for record breaking prices in Manhattan at the time. This transaction was said to have garnered about $1bn. In 2013, El Ad Group sold its share of the hotel and surrounding commercial property. = Delek Group = Tshuva's major business breakthrough came in 1998, when he managed to gain control of Delek Israel Fuel Corporation from the Recanati family's Israel Discount Bank Holdings. Tshuva grew Delek Group into an energy company dealing with petrol, natural gas, insurance, biochemistry, armored vehicles and the like. As of 2014, Delek Group's market value was about $4.5bn. = Gas discoveries = Delek discovered offshore natural gas reserves in Israel and Cyprus. In January 2009, 320 billion cubic meters of gas reserves were discovered in the \\"Tamar 1\\" and \\"Dalit\\" gas fields. The drilling, close to Israel's shores, was carried out by Delek Group and an American company, Noble Energy. In 2010, gas reserves of 600 billion cubic meters were discovered in the Leviathan gas field. Later, gas reserves were also discovered in drillings at \\"Dolphin\\", \\"Tanin\\", and \\"Block 12\\" in Cyprus. The discoveries by Delek Group have reduced Israel's dependence on foreign energy sources. These reserves can accommodate Israel's predicted energy requirements for the next few decades while enabling the export of natural gas.  Family  Tshuva and his wife, Haya, live in Netanya. They have five children.

He was imprisoned from 1874 until 1875 during the crisis ensuring from the Religious Question after his bold condemnations and actions against Freemasons who came into direct conflict with him. The bishop was a vocal critic of Masonic influence in ecclesial affairs and attempted to have fraternities expel members who were Masonic; an imperial review found that he was risking a severe breach of the constitution which served as the motivator for his arrest and subsequent imprisonment. The cause for his beatification had its origins from the 1930s though never achieved a formal process until 1953; this too did not last long and the cause remained inactive until 1994 when he became titled as a Servant of God and the cause resumed. Life =Education to episcopal appointment= Ant√¥nio Gon√ßalves de Oliveira was born in Pernambuco in Brazil on 27 November 1844 to Ant√¥nio Gon√ßalves and Antonia Albia de Oliveira. He attended school at Recife and Itamb√° while he later commenced his studies for the priesthood in Olinda before he continued his studies at the Saint-Sulpice institute abroad in Paris. He became a Franciscan friar after entering the order at Versailles on 16 July 1863 while he received the habit and his religious name on 15 August 1863. He was ordained to the priesthood on 2 August 1863 in Toulouse. He returned to his native Brazil in November 1863 where he taught seminarians philosophical studies in S√£o Paulo. In 1871 the imperial government of Pedro II elected to choose him to fill the vacant Olinda episcopal see despite his great reluctance to become a bishop; Pope Pius IX confirmed the appointment a month later. He received his episcopal consecration on 17 March 1872 in the S√£o Paulo Cathedral; he was enthroned in his new see on 24 May. =The Religious Question= Soon his episcopate would be mired in difficulties with the Freemasons. The Masons became agitated with the Rio de Janeiro diocese in 1872 so decided to retaliate though were confident that the Prime Minister - and fellow Mason - Paranhos would allow them to cause noise. The Freemasons in Recife announced that their lodge would celebrate a Mass on 30 June 1872 in the San Pedro church; the bishop was firm and demanded all priests not to participate which meant that no Mass could be celebrated for the Masons. But the lodge retaliated and published a list of all clerics who were their affiliates though did not expect that the bishop would be able to take much action. The government tried to settle the matter and sent an imperial minister - who was a relative - to him to urge him not to meddle too much in the affairs of the lodges since the bishop had no power over them. On 28 December 1872 he issued his first statement asking the priests to inform all Christian fraternities to expel those Masonic members who refused to abjure their affiliation to lodges. He took further action on 19 January 1873 when he issued an interdict against those fraternities who did not listen to his previous statement which also forbade those fraternities not to celebrate the sacraments in their chapels or oratories. Those fraternities appealed to the imperial government the next month with the allegation that the matter was not just a spiritual matter which meant an imperial review could be undertaken. The collective also said no penalties should have been imposed upon them because it was not legitimate. In June 1873 the emperor decided that the fraternities were correct and that the bishop risked breaching the constitution and so ordered the bishop to lift all interdicts which he failed to do. He remained indifferent to this and continued his bold activism against the lodges. But the prosecutor-general brought charges against him to the Supreme Court of Justice who accepted the charges and issued a warrant for the bishop's arrest. The bishop was arrested at his residence on 2 January 1874 the charge of violating the constitution; the police knocked on his door to see him emerge in his full episcopal attire with his miter and staff in hand. But the police became afraid when the crowds were encouraging the bishop and snarling at the police. To counter these crowds the police moved him to Salvador where he was moved without people knowing so the route to Rio de Janeiro was quiet and more discreet. In Rio de Janeiro he was imprisoned in dreadful conditions until his trial could commence. The pope soon learned of this and sent a letter of protest to Pedro II who disregarded it. The trial against him commenced on 18 February 1874. The public reaction to this was shattering for the government to the point where Pedro II ordered his London ambassador to go to Rome to distort to the Roman Curia the facts of what the bishop had done and to persuade Pius IX to force bishops to retract penalties against Masons. This mission to the pope failed while Cardinal Giacomo Antonelli - who was incorrectly informed of the events - sent a private letter on 18 December 1874 to the imprisoned bishop with mild admonishments; the pope knew nothing of this letter. He offered no formal defense when he was subpoenaed and he remained silent during the trial where two barristers aided him. The trial concluded not long after in which he was found guilty and sentenced to hard labor for four years though this was soon commuted to a four-year term of imprisonment. Pius IX learnt of this and sent a heartfelt letter to the bishop on 4 March 1874. The Masonic Prime Minister could no longer ignore the public backlash and so appealed to the emperor to do something; Pedro II received much pressure from all sides and so had no recourse but to grant amnesty on 17 September 1875. But the bishop knew that false impressions against him had been made in Rome from those agents of the government. To that end he left Brazil on 5 October 1875 to present his case to the pope. Upon meeting the pope the latter welcomed him with open arms and said: \\"O my dear Olinda!\\" He attempted to get the pope to accept his resignation though the pope refused. He returned in triumph to his diocese on 6 October 1876 and made a pastoral visit across his diocese on horseback. =Death and burial= He began to suffer an illness that could not be cured for it was far too advanced so travelled to France for treatment. But he died at a Franciscan convent in Paris in mid-1878; his remains were moved back to Brazil in 1882 and were interred in Recife. Beatification cause The cause for the late bishop's beatification opened in the Olinda-Recife archdiocese in an informative process that began on 25 July 1953 and was concluded sometime thereafter. The cause remained inactive for several decades and did not seem to move until 1994 when the competent forum for the beatification cause was transferred from Paris (where he died) to his old diocese. He became titled as a Servant of God on 3 November 1994 under Pope John Paul II after the Congregation for the Causes of Saints issued the official \\"nihil obstat\\". The diocesan process for collecting documents took place from 18 May 2001 until 4 July 2001 while the C.C.S. validated the process in Rome on 21 February 2003. The C.C.S. received the Positio dossier in 2015 for investigation.

The event commemorated the 79th anniversary of CMLL, the oldest professional wrestling promotion in the world. The Anniversary show is normally CMLL's biggest show of the year, their Super Bowl event. The CMLL Anniversary Show series is the longest-running annual professional wrestling show, starting in 1934. The 79th Anniversary show was also billed as Juicio Final, or \\"Final Justice\\"/\\"Doomsday\\", a title that CMLL has used at times either as a tag line for the tag line for an Anniversary show or as the name of a separate super show produced by CMLL marketed as CMLL Juicio Final. The show replaced CMLL's regular Friday night Super Viernes (\\"Super Friday\\") shows and was taped for later broadcast. This was the thirteenth time that CMLL used the name \\"Jucio Final\\" to promote one of their major shows and the first time it was used for an anniversary show. The main event of the show was a Lucha de Apuestas, or \\"bet match\\", where both El Terrible and Rush put their hair on the line, with the loser being shaved completely bald after the match. The show also featured an additional Lucha de Apuestas match on the undercard, this time with Puma King and Rey Cometa both putting their wrestling mask on the line, with the loser being forced to unmask afterward and reveal his birth name per lucha libre traditions. The show featured an additional four matches, all contested under Best two-out-of three-falls six-man tag team rules, the most prevalent match format in CMLL and most Mexican wrestling shows. Production =Background= Arena M√©xico, CMLL's main venue and location of the Anniversary Show The Mexican Lucha libre (professional wrestling) company Consejo Mundial de Lucha Libre (CMLL) started out under the name Empresa Mexicana de Lucha Libre (\\"Mexican Wrestling Company\\"; EMLL), founded by Salvador Lutteroth in 1933. Lutteroth, inspired by professional wrestling shows he had attended in Texas, decided to become a wrestling promoter and held his first show on September 21, 1933, marking what would be the beginning of organized professional wrestling in Mexico. Lutteroth would later become known as \\"the father of Lucha Libre\\" . A year later EMLL held the EMLL 1st Anniversary Show, starting the annual tradition of the Consejo Mundial de Lucha Libre Anniversary Shows that have been held each year ever since, most commonly in September. Over the years the anniversary show would become the biggest show of the year for CMLL, akin to the Super Bowl for the National Football League (NFL) or WWE's WrestleMania event. The first anniversary show was held in Arena Modelo, which Lutteroth had bought after starting EMLL. In 1942‚Äì43 Lutteroth financed the construction of Arena Coliseo, which opened in April 1943. The EMLL 10th Anniversary Show was the first of the anniversary shows to be held in Arena Coliseo. In 1956 Lutteroth had Arena M√©xico built in the location of the original Arena Modelo, making Arena M√©xico the main venue of EMLL from that point on. Starting with the EMLL 23rd Anniversary Show, all anniversary shows except for the EMLL 46th Anniversary Show have been held in the arena that would become known as \\"The Cathedral of Lucha Libre\\". On occasion EMLL held more than one show labelled as their \\"Anniversary\\" show, such as two 33rd Anniversary Shows in 1966. Over time the anniversary show series became the oldest, longest-running annual professional wrestling show. In comparison, WWE's WrestleMania is only the fourth oldest still promoted show (CMLL's Arena Coliseo Anniversary Show and Arena M√©xico anniversary shows being second and third). EMLL was supposed to hold the EMLL 52nd Anniversary Show on September 20, 1985 but Mexico City was hit by a magnitude 8.0 earthquake. EMLL canceled the event both because of the general devastation but also over fears that Arena M√©xico might not be structurally sound after the earthquake. When Jim Crockett Promotions was bought by Ted Turner in 1988 EMLL became the oldest still active promotion in the world. In 1991 EMLL was rebranded as \\"Consejo Mundial de Lucha Libre\\" and thus held the CMLL 59th Anniversary Show, the first under the new name, on September 18, 1992. Traditionally CMLL holds their major events on Friday Nights, replacing their regularly scheduled Super Viernes show. =Storylines= The event featured six professional wrestling matches with different wrestlers involved in pre- existing scripted feuds, plots and storylines. Wrestlers were portrayed as either heels (referred to as rudos in Mexico, those that portray the \\"bad guys\\") or faces (t√©cnicos in Mexico, the \\"good guy\\" characters) as they followed a series of tension-building events, which culminated in a wrestling match or series of matches. The main event of the 79th Anniversary Show was the highlight of a long running feud between the young tecnico Rush and the rudo' El Terrible that had been slowly building for almost a year leading up to the show. The first significant match between the two took place on November 13, 2011, as Rush successfully defended the CMLL World Light Heavyweight Championship against El Terrible. The following month on December 25, Rush and El Terrible were the two final survivors in a torneo cibernetico match used to determine who would fight for the vacant CMLL World Heavyweight Championship the following week. On January 1, 2012, El Terrible defeated Rush two falls to one to win the CMLL World Heavyweight Championship. In February, Rush was teamed with El Terrible in the 2012 Torneo Nacional de Parejas Increibles (\\"National Incredible Pairs Tournament\\"), a tag team tournament where all teams were made up of rivals. Rush and El Terrible eventually made it to the finals of the tournament on March 2, 2012 at Homenaje a Dos Leyendas, where they were defeated by the team of Atlantis and Mr. Niebla. Two days later, Rush successfully defended the CMLL World Light Heavyweight Championship against El Terrible. Over the summer of 2012 the feud between the two escalated until a Lucha de Apuestas, or bet match, between the two was agreed to. In the weeks before the 79th Anniversary Show held their annual 2012 Universal Championship tournament. Since both Rush and El Terrible held CMLL championships they entered the tournament and ended up facing off in the semi-finals of the tournament. El Terrible won the match over Rush, after which El Terrible and his stablemate Rey Bucanero attacked Rush. On September 9, only five days before the anniversary show, Rush defeated Rey Bucanero in a steel cage match to retain the CMLL World Light Heavyweight Championship. Aftermath While the Lucha de Apuestas match to some extent ended the feud between the two Rush and El Terrible would cross path following El Terrible's loss. On January 15, 2013, Rush gave up the CMLL World Light Heavyweight Championship to get another shot at El Terrible's CMLL World Heavyweight Championship. Ultimately he failed to win the championship from El Terrible, after being hit with a kick to the groin. In March, Rush and El Terrible teamed up for the 2013 Torneo Nacional de Parejas Increibles like they had for the 2012 tournament, but the team lost in the first round to Drag√≥n Rojo Jr. and Niebla Roja. Two weeks later they were on opposite sides of a six-man tag team match at the 2013 Homenaje a Dos Leyendas show, where Rush, Rayo de Jalisco Jr. and Shocker defeated El Terrible, Mr. Niebla and Universo 2000 by disqualification. Reception Gerardo Cu√©llar, a reporter for the Mexican \\"Deportivoros\\" Sports News website, wrote an article entitled \\"The 79th Anniversary, nothing new in CMLL\\", where he noted that while the main event match itself was a \\"good fight\\" it also displayed little imagination from the bookers of CMLL as they had the established rudo veteran wrestler lose to the young tecnico Rush, \\"sacrificing\\" El Terrible. He also noted that the rudo Puma King winning the mask of Rey Cometa earlier in the night signaled that the tecnico Rush would win the main event. Apolo Vald√©s who writes for MedioTiempo, a MSN published Mexican sports news site, described the main event as a match with \\"strong moves\\" and \\"Impressive punishment\\", noting that both Rush and El Terrible worked a very physical, hard hitting match, noting that the crowd was behind the supposed rudo El Terrible and booed the tecnico Rush. Mexican news website El Record stated that the main event was \\"an exciting fight\\".

His son, Steve, helps him in running the caravan, as well as dating one of the local girls in the town, Ruth. Randolph Carter is a local banker who covets the commerce created by the wagon train. Carter hires gunmen to attack the caravan, who in a raid, kill Macy, and take possession of the wagons and their supplies. Steve, who was not with the caravan at the time of the attack, takes over running the caravan. Due to the losses inflicted by the gunmen, Steve is forced to go to the local bank for a loan, in order to keep the operation running. However, Carter is the banker and refuses to provide him with the necessary funds. Two of Steve's friends, Rough and Ready, go to the bank in an attempt to convince Carter to change his mind. When the opportunity arises, the two friends help themselves to the needed funds from the bank's safe. Steve takes the money, not knowing how it was obtained. When Carter accuses Steve of stealing the money, he is forced to flee. When he and his two friends take refuge in a cabin in the mountains, they uncover the true gunmen who have been plaguing the caravan, who are plotting to attack the next caravan, as well as disclosing where they have hidden the wagons they have stolen previously. As Rough and Ready head out to recover the stolen wagons, Steve heads into the town to expose Carter. However, Carter has already convinced the town leaders that Steve is not to be trusted, and that he should be given the contract to run the caravan. Steve, hiding from the townspeople, now that Carter has turned them against him, manages to convince Ruth of his innocence. He escapes from the town and joins Rough and Ready, who are bringing the stolen caravan and the much needed supplies into town. The caravan is once again attacked by Carter's henchmen, but this time they are ready, and defeat the gunmen. The caravan arrives in town, at which point Steve exposes Carter as the mastermind behind the attacks. Steve remains in control of the caravan, and wins the hand of Ruth.

He started practice in 1909; his major works included St Martin's War Memorial Hospital (opened 1922) and the Masonic Temple, Brisbane (1928) Powell served as president of the Queensland Institute of Architects (1927‚Äì1931), as president of the Australian Institute of Architects (1928‚Äì1929), and as president of the Royal Australian Institute of Architects (1932‚Äì1933). Early years: 1886-1910 =Family life and education= Lang√© Leopold Powell was born in Rockhampton, Australia, on 2 July 1886 to the Methodist minister William Powell and his second wife, Mary Ellen n√©e Zillman. He was the second of three children from William Powell‚Äôs second marriage and his seventh surviving child. Powell was named after Zillman‚Äôs grandparents, Clare Lange and Leopold Zillman, who in 1938 were among the first free settlers in the wider Brisbane district.'Powell, Lange Leopold (1886‚Äì1938)', Hogan, Janet; Australian Dictionary of Biography, National Centre of Biography, Australian National University, http://adb.anu.edu.au/biography/powell-lange- leopold-8088/text14115, accessed 2 October 2012.PDT Architects 70 Years: Design in Detail, PDT Architects, Spring Hill, 2010 Powell‚Äôs family moved from Rockhampton to Brisbane in 1888, where he later was educated at Central Boy‚Äôs School, Brisbane. During 1900 he was articled to G.H.M. Addison of the firm Addison & Corrie Architects, and during the next five years he would attend lectures at Brisbane Technical College. Shortly after he had finished his articles, he worked as a draughtsman for C.W. Chambers (1905‚Äì06) and briefly with the Public Works Department (1907).'Lange L. Powell, Architect', Kerr, Margaret F.; Faculty of Architecture, University of Queensland, February 1957 =Marriage and study in England= Throughout this time, Powell and Maude Moore of Murtoa, Victoria, began a relationship. During 1904, Moore temporarily moved to Brisbane for six months to live with her sister and her brother-in-law, who was a Methodist minister. The two met at a Methodist conference, which Powell‚Äôs father was organising that year. They became engaged in 1907, shortly before Powell left for England. With the aid of Addison‚Äôs recommendation addressed to his good friend John Belcher, Powell began work for the well-established English firm Belcher & Co. He was very talented at pen and ink sketches and water-coloured renderings, and exhibited his work at the Royal Academy of Arts in London and the Louvre in Paris. In 1909, he became an architectural member of the Union des Beaux Arts et des Lettres of France. These works were later displayed at the Queensland Art Society on his return. Later years: 1910-1938 =Career and style= Powell's self-designed home in Hamilton, Brisbane. Upon his return, Powell married Maude Moore in her hometown of Murtoa, Victoria. The couple only kept correspondence via letters during his three-year absence. Despite marrying in Victoria, the couple returned to live in Queensland where Powell began practicing with Claude Chambers, forming the firm Chambers and Powell in 1911. He was mostly responsible for designing and supervising as Chambers left for Sydney in 1915 to practice architecture. Powell eventually established his own practice in 1920 which also earned him the reputation as an accomplished designer. Powell‚Äôs career was arguably considered to be at its best between 1920 and 1930 as the majority of his works were designed between those times. During the 1920s, there was a higher demand for architects and builders to collaborate with one another. Powell championed this idea, believing good supervision was required for the building to be true to plans. Builders that worked with Powell had high regard for him as he was easy to work with and would produce a certificate of payment in such short time. Powell was known to have a forceful personality. He strove for a purity of style, and was rather outspoken in his criticism of other architects‚Äô design as to whether it was true to classical or gothic style. Powell would never take other‚Äôs opinion into account if he felt that a thing was correct. He was known for not strictly following any particular \\"style\\", but instead he created his own hybrid of sorts, based on Renaissance detailing in a more simplified form. One common criticism Powell received was that he was not always faithful to architecture, and he had an intention to commercialise it. He also believed that women would make great architects, and between 1934 and 1935 Powell‚Äôs daughter (Joan Powell) worked for him and was under his apprenticeship. Powell branded himself as ‚Äúdesigner of public buildings‚Äù rather than as a domestic architect. He was the architect for Woolworths, Coles, the National Bank of Australasia, the Commercial Bank of Australia, the A.U.S.N Co., and was also the supervisor of any work for T. & G. Insurance. He submitted drawings for three competitions and was successful twice. He was chosen to represent Queensland in a national competition to design a National Bank of Australasia in Brisbane. While Powell wasn't successful, the winning firm A. & K. Henderson appointed him as the construction supervisor. His winning designs for St. Martin‚Äôs Hospital (1920), and the Masonic Temple (1923) were a great success, with both considered among his best work. =St Martin‚Äôs Hospital= St Martin's Hospital in Ann Street, BrisbaneIn 1920, Lange Powell won the competition for the St Martin's War Memorial Hospital. Powell was known to be skillful with pen, ink work and watercolour render, therefore he submitted a very beautiful perspective rendering of the hospital which was described by the Right Reverened St Clair Donaldson, Archbishop of Brisbane, as \\"a gem in architecture\\".'Lange L. Powell, Architect', Kerr, Margaret F.; pgs: 33-35, Faculty of Architecture, University of Queensland, February 1957 The proposed site was on Wickham Terrace where Anzac House now stands, but it was rejected because it was considered too far out of town. Powell designed it with a close; however it was proven to be irrelevant in some ways as it cuts off air ventilation to the patient‚Äôs room. The hospital is constructed using mainly bricks and stone on solid rock foundations. Thomas Keenan and Son were assigned as the contractors of the project. The base consists of Brisbane tuff, the ground floor to first floor‚Äôs sill is made of sandstone and above this in brickwork with two stone string courses. The roof is high pitched and covered in shingle tiles and the windows are six paned pivot hung sashes. St. Martin‚Äôs consist of two storeys with the central portions in three. It is evident that Powell was fond of ornamental rainwater heads. On the cathedral elevation there are two rainwater heads with arms extending five feet on either side, giving the appearance of a cross. The entrance is rather insignificant and opens into the vestibule which is paneled in dark oak timber. There are private rooms on the cathedral side and small wards on the other, which open onto a wide balcony. The nurses‚Äô quarters are in a two- storey wing of Eton House, which is just adjacent to the hospital. A children‚Äôs wing was added in 1940 by John Darnell and the design is to blend with the main hospital. Although it could be said St. Martin's is not the most practical design for a hospital, it was mentioned that Powell made the plan to suit the elevation. Despite this, it is undeniable that the building has a graceful charm and creates a feeling of tranquility in the person approaching it. =Masonic Temple= The Masonic Temple in Ann Street, Brisbane.Lange Powell was one of the sixteen architects elected to submit designs for the proposed Masonic Temple in Brisbane and in 1924, the plans were analyzed and before December 1927 plans for the Temple had been prepared by the Grand Architect, Lange L. Powell. He was then a member of the firm Atkinson, Powell and Conrad.'Lange L. Powell, Architect', Kerr, Margaret F.; pgs: 29-33, Faculty of Architecture, University of Queensland, February 1957 Tenders were called on 12 March 1928 but the plans were drastically modified. The construction of the Masonic Temple commenced in May 1928. The total cost of the project summed up to ¬£130,000 which included ¬£7,000 for the land and ¬£10,000 for furniture. Although the cost of the project was considered somewhat high, it was constructed to be able to take three more floors when this became necessary. The six Corinthian columns are each five feet in diameter at the base. It is constructed of reinforced concrete, brick, stone and marble. The pipe organ was supplied by Messrs. B.B. Whitehouse and company. The furniture throughout is Silky Oak, maple and Cedar from Queensland. The entrance floor is in marble mosaic and this leads to a circular shrine surrounded by Doric columns and the floor pattern is star shaped with an urn of remembrance mounted on a black marble base in the centre of the floor. The offices, library and museum open off the circular vestibule. Two marble staircases lead to the upper floors. The handrail is timber supported on an attractive wrought iron balustrade and the corridors have parquetry floors. There are four lodge rooms on the first floor with corresponding supper rooms above. The Grand Hall is on the third floor and is reputed to be the finest of its kind in Australia. The organ chamber claims twenty eight feet of this floor space and in front of it is a gallery seating twenty two choir members. The hall seats one thousand two hundred people. The walls have been rendered and given a sand float to give the appearance of sandstone. The interior wall decoration is simple, but there is a beautifully curved coffered ceiling lightly decorated in blue and gold. Externally, the building is faced in sandstone and is classical in design. The base is in grey granite. The position of the entrance door is rather unfortunate as it cuts into the columns rather than coming between them. Architectural work During his three-year study in England, Powell became an Associate of the Royal Institute of British Architects. On his return to Queensland, he took an immediate interest in the Queensland Institute of Architects and was selected as Honorary Secretary of the Institute for five years from 1910. He later became a councillor, Vice-President (1923‚Äì1927), and finally President (1927‚Äì1931). While Powell was President, the Architects‚Äô Act of 1928 was passed which required aspiring architecture graduates to be registered before being able to practice. Powell did much of the preliminary work on the Bill and was substantially responsible for it becoming law.'Lange L. Powell, Architect', Kerr, Margaret F.; 'Powell's Work for the Architectural Profession' pgs: 56-59, Faculty of Architecture, University of Queensland, February 1957 Whilst each state had its own architectural institute, a unifying Federal Council was formed, hoping to allow further collaboration between states. Each state institute elected two members for the Federal Council of the Australian Institute of Architects and Powell was a representative for Queensland for many years. Powell worked hard during this time for the entrance examination level to study architecture be raised to Junior Standard. Powell was also president of the Federal Council for two years, from 1928 to 1929. Powell also was integral in the formation of the Royal Australian Institute of Architects in 1930. With Sir Charles Rosenthal he drafted the initial constitution of the institute, and was the president for two years from 1932 to 1933. Whilst he was president Powell emphasised the importance of the institute, stating to members at a meeting, \\"I do particularly want to say that the expression of opinions I always welcomed, must always be welcomed, because it is only through going through these thorny paths that we get the ultimate end\\". Due to his efforts in the formation of the R.A.I.A, Powell was made a Fellow of the Royal Institute of British Architects. Metropolitan Water Supply & Sewerage Board v R. Jackson Limited One of R. Jackson's warehouses designed by Powell. During the early 1920s, the Metropolitan Water Supply and Sewerage board was implementing the Brisbane Sewerage Scheme, which included the maintenance and replacement of sewerage systems in Brisbane CBD. A trunk sewer was scheduled to be laid in Eagle Street, but during excavation several surrounding buildings, including Powell‚Äôs client R. Jackson‚Äôs warehouse, subsided and cracked. The property owners, claimed for compensation from the Sewerage board, and Powell was requested by Jackson to use his prior knowledge of the site and his extensive knowledge of building practices to act as their structural adviser. In 1924, Powell presented his case to the Supreme Court, prompting one judge to speak very highly of Powell's unbiased handling of the case. The following information is taken from Powell‚Äôs declaration during the Metropolitan Water Supply & Sewerage Board v R. Jackson Limited case, published in \\"The Queensland State Reports 1924, Decisions of the Supreme Court, Queensland\\".'Lange L. Powell, Architect', Kerr, Margaret F.; 'The Jackson Case' pgs: 50-55, Faculty of Architecture, University of Queensland, February 1957 The site Powell inspected was an irregular sized block constrained by the city‚Äôs grid system and the Brisbane River. The site contains several buildings: R. Jackson‚Äôs, the New Zealand Loan and Mercantile Agency Company's, the Australian Estates, the Brisbane Stock Exchange and the United Insurance buildings. The owners claimed that during the scheduled tunneling, excavation and blasting operations in Elizabeth, Eagle and Creek Streets and adjacent lanes, the Board‚Äôs negligence had damaged their buildings. These operations, Powell declared, had interfered with and weakened the foundations on which the buildings had been erected and had altered the level of support given by the subsoil. Consequently, this resulted in the further settling of buildings, and numerous cracks and breaks in the wall and structural elements. Jackson and Powell also claimed that the damage would continue unless the Board paid to repair the buildings and prevent any further sinking. They also applied for compensation, claiming that both the land and buildings had greatly depreciated in value. The Board rebutted, stating that the owners knew the soil was insufficient for buildings of that size and that they had neglected to provide and construct adequate foundations. They also said the owners‚Äô buildings were poorly constructed with inferior materials, and that the cracking of walls and structural elements was due to the lack of maintenance required. Whilst the initial hearing at the Magistrates Court was in favour of the Metropolitan Water & Sewerage Board, Jackson appealed to the Supreme Court where Judge Lukin overturned the decision. Powell‚Äôs report in combination with independent expert analysis proved pivotal in the Supreme Court case, with Lukin stating ‚ÄòMr. Powell has shown a considerable amount of ability, research and industry in supplying the Court with authorities in support of the opinions he has expressed.\\" Compensation awarded for the New Zealand Loan was ¬£600, for Jackson ¬£250, and for the Australian Estates ¬£160.  Death and legacy  Towards the end of 1938, Powell fell ill with influenza which inevitably developed into pneumonia. He was taken to the hospital of his own design (St. Martin‚Äôs) where he died a few days later on 29 October 1938 at the age of 52. The day after Powell‚Äôs death, The Courier Mail paid tribute to him by publishing an article about him. In the article, they mentioned how regretful they were to inform that Brisbane had lost one of its most prominent architects and popular citizens. The Courier Mail also paid tribute to his life and extensive career. In 1940, Dr. Graham Brown, who was Powell‚Äôs greatest friend, donated the triptych for the Lady Chapel in St. John‚Äôs Cathedral, which Powell had been engaged in designing at the time of his death. The triptych was unveiled at the morning service by the then governor. Chronological list of work: 1910‚Äì1925 =Domestic work= 1913 * Mrs S.

(, ) is an oil painting from 1892 by the French Post- Impressionist artist Paul Gauguin. On loan to the Kunstmuseum in Basel, Switzerland for nearly a half-century, it was sold privately by the family of Rudolf Staechelin to Sheikha Al-Mayassa bint Hamad Al-Thani, in February 2015 for close to US$210 million (¬£155 million), one of the highest prices ever paid for a work of art. The painting was on exhibition at the Fondation Beyeler, Riehen, until 28 June 2015. History Gauguin travelled to Tahiti for the first time in 1891. His hope was to find \\"an edenic paradise where he could create pure, 'primitive' art\\", rather than the primitivist faux works being turned out by painters in France. Upon arrival, he found that Tahiti was not as he imagined it: it had been colonised in the 18th century, and at least two-thirds of the indigenous people of the island had been killed by diseases brought by Europeans. \\"Primitive\\" culture had been wiped out. Despite this, he painted many pictures of native women: nude, dressed in traditional Tahitian clothes, and dressed in Western-style dresses, as is the rear figure in When Will You Marry?. Full-scale working study, charcoal and pastel, Art Institute of Chicago The front and middle ground are built up in areas of green, yellow and blue. A traditionally dressed young woman has settled on the threshold between the front and middle ground. Richard Field suggests the white tiare flower behind her left ear indicates she is seeking a husband.Field pp. 132-41Stuckey pp. 263-64Maurer Behind her a second figure in a high-necked Western-style dress sits erectly. Field thought her gesture derives from Buddhist art. Naomi E. Maurer subsequently identified it as a mudra denoting threatening or warning. The front woman stretches herself, her facial features stylized and simplified. Field thought her pose had a Japanese precedent, Charles F. Stuckey suggests Delacroix's Women of Algiers. The rear female figure is flush with the yellow-blue area. Her face is painted with individual features and represents the centre of the image. The pink colour of her dress is clearly distinct from the other colours. At the bottom right is the inscription \\"NAFEA Faa ipoipo\\" (When will you marry). Gauguin commonly inscribed his paintings in Tahitian at this time: he was fascinated by the language, though never advanced beyond its rudiments. Art historian Nancy Mowll Mathews wrote that Gauguin \\"portrayed the [Tahitian] natives as living only to sing and to make love. That's how he got the money from his friends and raised the public's interest in his adventure. But, of course, he knew the truth, which was that Tahiti was an unremarkable island with an international, westernised community\\". These paintings of Tahitians, including When Will You Marry?, were met with relative indifference when Gauguin returned to France, his 1893 Durand-Ruel exhibition only a limited success generating some favourable reviews but little by way of sales. Gauguin placed this painting on consignment at the exhibition at a price of 1,500 francs, the highest price he assigned and shared by only one other painting, but had no takers. Staechelin eventually purchased it at the Maison Moos gallery in Geneva in 1917.

It is one of the oldest air force bases in Pakistan, originally functioning as a maintenance depot for the Royal Indian Air Force during the days of the British Raj. After independence, it remained a small base used primarily for aircraft maintenance. History In 1950, a transport squadron consisting of Dakotas and Bristol Freighters moved into the base from Peshawar before eventually relocating to Chaklala in 1960. From 1949 to 1959, an air force central medical board was also present at the base, responsible for medical certification of PAF aircrews. Throughout the early 1950s, a University Air Squadron and the Shaheen Air Training Corps established their activities in Lahore for aviation education purposes and pilot recruitment programmes. The base also served as a regional control centre for aviation. In 1960, as part of efforts to make Lahore an air defence base, a number of observer units were shifted to the base. In 1961, for the first time, a Pakistan International Airlines (PIA) Super Constellation aircraft made its landing at the airport. The PAF loaned its northern hangar to the PIA to be converted into a civilian terminal building. The runway of the base was extended and improved to facilitate larger aircraft. In 1978, with the arrival of radar technologies in the country, the Lahore base served as a center for training officers on using equipment. An air defence modernization school, now renamed Air Defence System School (ADSS) was established at the PAF Base Lahore in 1978, with a primary aim of imparting aviation training to PAF technicians, operators, engineers and controllers, which includes training courses on \\"high power radars, communication, uninterrupted power supply systems, power generators\\" and other equipment. The school was later shifted to Walton Airport in 1987 and then to PAF Base Mushaf, where it presently continues to function. Present use There is an operations wing present at the base today which provides an all-year air defence cover. The Lahore air base is frequently used for receiving foreign air force dignitaries. Each year, Air Force Day celebrations are conducted at the base. The festivities attract a large number of spectators and retired PAF personnel. The Fazaia Inter College of the Pakistan Air Force is situated next to the base.

Sent to Coventry Motor Mills, Daimler's office block Sandy Lane, Coventry (with a power station) all that was left standing after 1941 air raids built in the 1860s for Coventry Cotton Spinning & Weaving Co Diminutive company promoter and deputy chairman, Harry Lawson, self-described \\"Pioneer of fin-de-si√®cle Locomotion\\" had already acquired Daimler using British Motor Syndicate Limited which he then owned with his partners E. T. Hooley and Martin Rucker. Hooley had acquired a disused four-storey cotton mill as a speculation and, though F. R. Simms had carefully selected Cheltenham, Lawson added Hooley's Coventry cotton mill to the portfolio, renamed the building Motor Mills, and installed Daimler there on one floor. It was intended that Daimler would produce engines and chassis in the Motor Mills and British Motor Syndicate would use them to form a range of cars and commercial vehicles. Although they meant to build cars based on the German Daimler designs Cannstatt was so reluctant to actually provide the agreed plans instead a couple of Paris-built Panhard Levassors were imported and used as patterns. Though they were Daimler powered they were more modern than the obsolescent Cannstatt vehicles and the Coventry-built engines also had design improvements. Though a director, Gottlieb Daimler had no financial interest in Lawson's companies and he attended no board meetings. Failure Automotive technology was rapidly changing and the expensive patents were rapidly outdated. This became obvious as 1897 progressed. Investments became worthless and share prices collapsed.Railway And Other Companies. The Times, Friday, 24 December 1897; pg. 11; Issue 35395. The GHCC shareholders met on 22 December 1897.

He also advised the directors would gladly tender their resignations should the shareholders desire them.Railway And Other Companies. The Times, Friday, 24 December 1897; pg. 11; Issue 35395. A committee of shareholders who had enquired into the business presented their report together with a scheme of reconstruction under which a new company, Motor Manufacturing Company Limited, would be incorporated. This new company would have the present building, plant and stock and a universal free licence to manufacture under the British Motor Syndicate patents. The British Motor Syndicate would take over all the liabilities of GHCC.

Written by Oscar Brodney, the film is about a young woman who takes a job at the White House as a switchboard operator and soon receives help with her love life from Supreme Court justices and the President of the United States. For the Love of Mary was the last film by Deanna Durbin, who withdrew from the entertainment business the following year to live a private life in France. Durbin's third husband Charles David said she \\"hated\\" making her last three films and that she would watch all her old movies except those three.ON THE TRAIL OF DEANNA DURBIN Paskov, David. Los Angeles Times 25 Apr 1982: m3. Plot Mary Peppertree (Deanna Durbin) starts a new job as a telephone switchboard operator at the White House, where her father Timothy has been working as a guard for many years. A former Supreme Court telephone operator, Mary takes her first call from David Paxton (Don Taylor), an ichthyologist who insists on speaking to the President about a political issue involving a small Pacific island. After hanging up on him twice, Mary spends the rest of her day fielding calls from various Supreme Court justices who attempt to reconcile her with her former fianc√©, Phillip Manning (Jeffrey Lynn), a Justice Department attorney. Later that night, Mary meets Justice Peabody (Harry Davenport) at a restaurant to discuss her breakup with Phillip, who is also there. After resisting their efforts to reunite her with Phillip, Mary tells Phillip that she broke their engagement not because she saw him with another woman, but because she was not jealous about it. Their conversation about her hard day at the White House fending off calls from the \\"fish peddler\\" is overheard by David, also in the restaurant, who then assures Mary that he will speak to the President, despite her interference. He then storms out. The next morning at the White House gate, David apologizes for his actions the night before, and attempts to bribe Mary with flowers and candy, only to have them thrown back into his face. Later, at the switchboard, Mary receives a call from the President. When Mary hiccups into the phone, the President sends his executive secretary, Harvey Elwood (Ray Collins), to check on her condition and offers her a paper bag to breathe into. Phillip calls, expecting to drive her to Justice Peabody's party that night, but she declines, not wanting to resume their relationship. Later, as she is leaving work, Mary must drive David off the White House grounds to prevent his arrest. Mary asks David to escort her to the party, offering to introduce him to the President's secretary in exchange for the favor. Meanwhile, the President, having overheard Mary telling Phillip that she would rather stay home than attend the party with him, sends Lt. Tom Farrington (Edmond O'Brien), a naval aide at the White House, to escort Mary. At the party, they cause a stir and not a little jealousy in Phillip. After a pleasant evening of singing around the piano, Tom escorts Mary home, where she notices they're being watched by her father from an upstairs window. After she kisses Tom goodnight and he leaves, she is confronted by David, who's been waiting on the porch all night. David kisses a startled Mary, who starts to hiccup again. The next day, when the President learns that Mary was upset about not keeping her date with David, he calls the fish expert himself to express his regrets, but then decides David's 'obsession' with fish means he is a nut. Later over lunch, after David explains his situation in full, Mary tells David she will arrange a meeting for him with Phillip, who can help him with his political issue. That afternoon at the Peppertree home, Tom arrives with presidential orders to take Mary to a White House movie screening. When Phillip learns that Mary is with Tom, he questions David about his relationship with Mary. The frustrated marine biologist announces he is leaving town and that everyone in Washington seems to have a \\"Mary Peppertree fixation.\\" Meanwhile, Tom's friend, newspaper publisher Samuel Litchfield (Frank Conroy), complains to Elwood about Tom's involvement with Mary, a mere switchboard operator. When Mary and Tom arrive together at the restaurant, the owner, Gustav Heindel (Hugo Haas), tells Elwood he saw Mary kissing David. Elwood decides to handle the matter with the Navy personally. Phillip offers to put the Justice Department on the case and promises to clear up the matter in two days. That night, at Elwood's request, David takes Mary out on a date in Tom's place. Afterwards, back home in front of her house, upon kissing David, Mary breaks out in hiccups again, a sign that she is in love. Then both Phillip and Tom show up, and Phillip says these circumstances are being contrived by others, claiming Tom is a 'patsy' for him, and David is a 'patsy' for Tom. David, further confused and jealous, leaves the three of them in frustration. The next morning, Mary receives calls from Gustav and the Supreme Court justices congratulating her on her engagement to Phillip, and a call from the President congratulating her on her engagement to Tom! When Elwood learns that David is not technically a citizen of the United States, he has the young man arrested for illegally entering the country. Elwood soon discovers, however, that the Pacific island on which David was born and holds the deed to, is now home to a $300 million strategic U.S. Naval base. If David is declared an alien, the Navy could be forced to move. Later that day, everyone arrives at Gustav's restaurant to try to resolve the issue. After meeting with the President's advisors, David fashions a Senate resolution for the American annexation of his island if Phillip and Tom are given appointments far from Washington, and he and Gustav are made United States citizens. The government readily agrees, and when Mary calls the President with the good news, David interrupts her conversation with a kiss, causing both of them to hiccup.

Reception In his 1948 review for The New York Times, Bosley Crowther called the film \\"a sly piece of propaganda against the administrators of our government in Washington.\\" Crowther explained: According to Crowther, the filmmakers, whom he called \\"propagandists\\", manipulate the viewer into drawing negative conclusions about Washington and its leaders. The film also fails on an entertainment level, with \\"painful attempts at humor\\" and \\"flat jokes\\" about the \\"woefully lax and quixotic operations of White House officialdom.\\" In his review for Allmovie, Craig Butler called it \\"a moderately entertaining mini-musical simply because of the charming presence of Deanna Durbin.\\" Butler saw the film as an unsuccessful attempt at creating a romantic screwball comedy of the classic type, lacking the necessary keen eye on detail, organization, character, and wit. According to Butler, the screenplay lacks all of these. The main \\"gimmick\\", of the President of the United States getting personally involved in straightening out the love life of a switchboard operator, is \\"obnoxiously cute and simply too unbelievable.\\" Butler does applaud de Cordova's direction and the acting‚ÄîHarry Davenport is especially good as a Supreme Court justice‚Äîbut it is not enough to salvage a poor script and unbelievable story.

While the protest started peacefully, violent confrontations between police and protesters began when protesters reached the United States Consulate General. In resulting clashes, six police officers and 19 protesters were injured. The violence was condemned by Australian political leaders, including Prime Minister Julia Gillard. Police arrested nine protesters in connection with the violence. The protest, through Pitt Street pedestrian mall and Martin Place, temporarily shut down parts of the city, instilling fear in members of the public (interviewed by live television crews), and was later brought under control by police. Protest A protester carries a sign reading \\"behead all those who insult the prophet\\". The protest started at about midday when approximately 100 people gathered at the Sydney Town Hall before marching along George Street to Martin Place where the US Consulate is located. Conflict between the protesters and the police started when the former tried to enter the US Consulate. The police used capsicum spray to push the protesters back from the consulate. According to one protester this aggravated the crowd, as many had brought their children. Signs carried at the protest The crowd then moved to Hyde Park, where around 300 people had gathered. Further clashes erupted as police used capsicum spray on protesters who at times threw bottles at police. Protesters chanted \\"Down, down USA\\" and carried Sunni Islamist flags and signs saying, \\"Behead all those who insult the prophet\\", \\"Our dead are in paradise, your dead are in hell\\", \\"Shariah will dominate the world\\", and \\"Obama Obama, we love Osama\\" and threw bottles and objects retrieved from construction sites at police officers. The police responded by spraying capsicum spray into the crowd.(requires registration or log-in) Six police officers were injured of which two were hospitalized. Police form a line in Hyde Park. As the crowd started to leave Hyde Park near St James, Public Order and Riot Squad officers equipped with batons and riot shields had already been stationed at the park exit. Protestors continued to throw stones, sticks and bottles at the police. Riot and mounted police pursued protesters down William Street towards Kings Cross. The already splintered crowd then broke up further, running through the back streets of Darlinghurst with police chasing after them.

Considered one of the greatest journalists of the 19th century and a pioneer of modern journalism,Italo de Feo, Venti secoli di giornalismo, Canesi, 1962, p.290 he is mostly remembered for his war correspondence. He wrote for many Italian papers and contributed to the press in France, Great Britain and Belgium. He was also a prolific novelist, mainly focused on religious themes. Biography =Youth= Born at Moliterno, Basilicata, at the time part of the Kingdom of Naples, his birth name was Ferdinando Petruccelli and he added \\"della Gattina\\" (name of a farm of his own) to his surname in order to avoid the Bourbon police who persecuted him for political reason. His father Luigi was a physician and member of the Carbonari while his mother Maria Antonia Piccininni was a noblewoman from Marsicovetere. Grown up in religious circles and because of the abuses received as a child, he developed a strong anticlericalism which will be reflected in his works. During his young age, he devoted himself to the study of Latin and Greek. Later, he attended the University of Naples, graduating in medicine but he chose the path of journalism. =Early career and exile= In 1838, he began his career for the Neapolitan newspaper Omnibus and, in 1840, he traveled to France, Great Britain and Germany as a correspondent for Salvator Rosa and Raccoglitore fiorentino. Because of his liberal ideas, he was arrested for his membership in Young Italy and was sent under guard to his native town. Returned to Naples in 1848, Petruccelli was elected deputy of the Neapolitan parliament and founded Mondo vecchio e mondo nuovo, a newspaper who accused the Bourbon dynasty of misgovernment in both internal and foreign policy and, for the frequent attacks on the crown, it was suppressed by the magistracy. After the suspension of the constitution promulgated by the king Ferdinand II few months before, he took part in the riots of the same year. The revolt failed and he was forced to escape to France, while the government sentenced him to death and confiscated his properties. During his French residence, he broadened his political and cultural horizons, thanks to contacts with renowned thinkers. He attended courses at the Sorbonne and the Coll√®ge de France, studied French and English literature and pursued a brilliant career as a journalist, becoming known and appreciated in Europe. Nicknamed, nicely, Pierre Oiseau de la Petite ChatteEmilio Giordano, Ferdinando Petruccelli della Gattina, Edisud, 1987, p.79 (French translation of his surname), he entered the world of French journalism thanks to Jules Simon and Daniele Manin, who appreciated the intervention of Mondo vecchio e mondo nuovo in favour of the Republic of San Marco. =War correspondent= Petruccelli became correspondent of French and Belgian journals such as La Presse, Journal des d√©bats, Revue de Paris, Le Courrier fran√ßais and Ind√©pendance Belge. In 1851, he fought with the French republicans against the coup d'√©tat of Louis-Napol√©on Bonaparte (later known as Napoleon III) but, after the failure of the rebellion, he was expelled from France. He settled in England, where he met Giuseppe Mazzini, Louis Blanc, Lajos Kossuth and other refugees. He worked for The Daily News of Charles Dickens and other newspapers like The Daily Telegraph and Cornhill Magazine. In 1859, he was correspondent of the Second Italian War of Independence and, in 1860, of the Expedition of the Thousand, following Giuseppe Garibaldi from Calabria until his entry in Naples. With the birth of the Kingdom of Italy, he was a member of the Italian parliament, sitting on the benches of the left for several years, and contributed to Italian newspapers and magazines such as L'Unione, L'Opinione, Fanfulla della Domenica, Cronaca bizantina and Nuova antologia. In 1866, Petruccelli was correspondent for the Journal des D√©bats during the Third Italian War of Independence and, in 1868, he married an English writer, Maude Paley-Baronet, whom he met in London in 1867. In 1870 he followed the Franco- Prussian War, recounting the events from the Parisian barricades and, after the fall of the Paris Commune, he was expelled from France by order of Adolphe Thiers (against which he turned bitter words) for having defended the Communards. =Death= He lived the rest of his life plagued by a paralysis that prevented him from writing but, with the help of his wife, he was able to continue his activity. Petruccelli died in Paris in 1890 and his corpse was cremated. The Neapolitan municipality proposed to carry his ashes to the cemetery of Poggioreale but his wife refused and they were buried in London, respecting the will of Petruccelli. Legacy During his time, Ferdinando Petruccelli della Gattina wasn't much appreciated in Italy, rather he was rejected by many (especially the clerical hierarchies because of his marked anticlericalism), with the exception of authors such as Salvatore Di Giacomo and Luigi Capuana. He was acclaimed in foreign countries, especially in France, where his work received positive reviews from Alphonse Peyrat, Ernest Renan and Jules Claretie, who said about his war correspondence of Custoza : \\"Nothing could be more fantastic and cruelly true than this tableau of agony. Reportage has never given a superior artwork\\",Jules Claretie, La vie √† Paris, Biblioth√®que Charpentier, 1896, p.367 while Justin McCarthy regarded him as \\"a brilliant, audacious, eccentric Italian journalist\\".Justin McCarthy, Modern Leaders, Sheldon & Co., 1872, p.22 In the 20th century, Petruccelli was praised by Luigi Russo and Indro Montanelli, who considered him the \\"most brilliant italian journalist of the 19th century\\" and his reports \\"would enchant for their freshness and modernity\\".

Death Warden had an altercation with a neighbouring landowner, Norman Bond. When Warden and Bond met in the street, an argument ensued in which Warden became extremely abusive and threatened to shoot Bond's dogs.

History =Overview= Passing under the line immediately to the northwest, a curved deviation in the road replaced the previous level crossing for the goods line at this location. Opened as Ayr Road in 1866, the station was renamed Dalserf in 1903. Being an exhausting walk along the road from the village, many locals considered the new name a joke. Progressively doubled, the main line to Coalburn via Tillietudlem was again singled in 1940. Temporarily closed from January 1941 to May 1945,Stansfield, p. 15 the station closed permanently in 1951.Butt, p. 76 The line closed to freight southwards in 1960, and northwards in 1964. The railways of South Lanarkshire in 1905 =Infrastructure= The station comprised side platforms linked by a footbridge. The main building and goods yard were on the southwest side. On the northeast side was a platform shelter and the Cornsilloch Colliery siding. The signal box was immediately southeast beside Stonehouse Junction (renamed Dalserf Junction). Farther southeast were sidings at for Ashgillhead Colliery, and at for Auldton Colliery. Immediately northwest was Milburn Chemical Works/Colliery (formerly Skellyton). Only the station house remains, now a private dwelling. A stone abutment from the railway bridge, southeast from the station, still stands. =Services= Passenger trains proceeded as far north as Ferniegair from December 1866, and via Motherwell to Glasgow from April 1868. Horse-drawn buses connected Ferniegair to prior to the October 1876 opening to passenger traffic of the new rail link offering onward travel to Glasgow . In 1887, weekday trains were: 6 via Netherburn to Brocketsbrae (called Lesmahagow at the time), and 5 via Stonehouse to Blackwood. Each southeast-bound train to Ayr Road, comprising up to 8 carriages, was then split for the separate routes. In 1905, when Central opened, Larkhall became Larkhall East, and Stonehouse trains no longer travelled via Dalserf. In 1910, weekday trains were 4, terminating at either Netherburn, Brocketsbrae, or Coalburn. The 1935 closure of Stonehouse‚ÄìDalserf to passenger and freight traffic suggests that some passenger services used the route after 1905. In 1947, weekday trains were 6, terminating at either Tillietudlem or Brocketsbrae. In 1948, weekday trains were 3, terminating at either Brocketsbrae or Coalburn. =Accidents= 1867: When the driver of a coal train, slowly passing the station, slipped on stepping to the ground, the engine wheels cut him in two. 1874: While shunting on the Cornsilloch Colliery siding about from the station, the passenger train from Stonehouse ran over two sleeping trespassers. One died from a crushed skull. The other suffered a mangled hand and serious injury to the opposite arm. 1877: A passing engine severed a pointsman's leg and he died a week later. 1878: While loading ballast stone, a jib crane fell on a worker, who later died of his injuries. 1886: A pack of hare-hunting hounds narrowly escaped total destruction near Ayr Road when an engine driver stopped his train before the pack was cut to pieces. 1889: Nearby, a passing train fatally struck a man walking along the line. 1890: Several runaway wagons smashed together in the vicinity, and the wreckage blocked the main line for several hours. The following month, while coupling a van, the buffers fatally caught a brakeman. 1891: During shunting from the Milburn Chemical Works, a worker slipped between the wagons and died of internal injuries an hour later. 1898: Appearing to have been knocked down by a passing train, the death of a signalman appeared suspicious. 1900: A porter was killed while uncoupling wagons. 1903: A light engine fatally struck a brakeman at the Millburn Colliery. 1908: While standing on a wagon, a brakeman lost two toes caught between the buffers.

Description Crematogaster scutellaris can reach a length of about 8 mm in the queen, while the workers rarely exceed 5 mm. These ants have reddish head and black thorax and abdomen. The shape of the abdomen is characteristic, as it gradually narrows toward the apex. They raise menacingly their pointed abdomen when they are feeling attacked, emitting a small drop of pheromones from the rear end. The smell of the pheromone causes a general mobilization in the nest and any intruder is soon surrounded by a mass of aggressive ants. Biology and ecology Crematogaster scutellaris establish independent monogynous colonies, but with the possibility of oligogyny (multiple queens are accepted by the workers in the colony, but the queens are aggressive among them). Winged males and queens can be found at the end of summer, but sometimes even until the end of October, if it is not very cold. They usually build their colonies mainly in stumps and fallen logs or dead branches. The nest are made with a mixture of chewed wood and humus. Between March and October workers collect and carry mainly sugary liquid substances and solid materials (remains of arthropods, small insects, etc. ). Close-up on Crematogaster scutellaris Spawning usually takes place during the summer. This species is very prolific. The larvae hatch primarily in September and overwinter in the second stage, from November to February at about 10 ¬∞C. The following spring the third instar larvae develop, pupating in the summer. By mid to late summer the worker appear, while sexed individuals appear in late August. These ants are natural predators of Thaumetopoea pityocampa, a moth that is a devastating pest of Mediterranean pines (especially Pinus halepensis). Distribution This species has a typically Mediterranean distribution. It is present in Europe, in the Near East and in North Africa. References * Olivier, 1792 : Encyclop√©die m√©thodique.

The animated television series Winx Club features characters designed by former comic artist Iginio Straffi. The show's narrative takes place in a magical dimension in which a group of fairy warriors defends their universe from villains. The group, called the Winx Club, attends and later graduates from the Alfea College for Fairies. They are frequently supported by their romantic partners, known as the Specialists, who study at the neighboring Red Fountain School. The Specialists do not have magical abilities; they train to fight using laser weapons. The titular club is led by Bloom, a student from Earth who believed she was an average human until discovering her flame-based fairy powers. The original group includes Stella, the fairy of the Sun; Flora, the fairy of nature; Musa, the fairy of music; and Tecna, the fairy of technology. They share an apartment on the campus of Alfea. The fairy of waves, Aisha, is introduced in the second season and becomes the group's sixth member. A seventh member, Roxy, is introduced in the fourth season and occasionally joins the other Winx Club fairies. Each season of Winx Club introduces new villains who fight the main characters. A trio of witches called the Trix are the Winx Club's most frequent adversaries. The characters of Winx Club have become popular with audiences. Critical response to the characters has been mostly positive, with praise for their positive relationships and presentation of gender roles. The characters have appeared in a variety of media, including the spin-off series World of Winx, a comic book serial, and platform video games. In 2012, new episodes of the series incorporated CGI-animated sequences that rendered the characters in 3D. A live-action series based on Winx Club, Fate: The Winx Saga, will debut in 2020 and feature many of the original characters. In the original series (seasons 1‚Äì4), the characters' mouths were animated to match the Italian voice actors, who recorded their lines in Rome. The revived series, beginning with the hour-long specials, was produced in English first. The specials and seasons 5‚Äì6 were animated to match the Hollywood-based cast, who recorded their lines at the Atlas Oceanic studio. Season 7 was also matched to Nickelodeon and Rainbow's English scripts, but due to budget cuts, Viacom relocated the voice cast from Hollywood to New York City. Only actors from the two original casts are listed below. Creation and conception Iginio Straffi developed the Winx Club characters for the pilot episode \\"Magic Bloom,\\" which was finished in 2001. The characters' outfits were modeled on those of traditional European fairies, while their appearances were loosely based on popular celebrities of 2001. In a 2011 interview with IO Donna, Straffi stated Britney Spears served as the basis for Bloom, Cameron Diaz for Stella, Jennifer Lopez for Flora, Pink for Tecna, and Lucy Liu for Musa. Straffi wanted the fairies to represent \\"the women of today\\" and to look more modern than classic examples like la Fata Turchina. After holding test screenings of the pilot, Straffi was unhappy with the audience's unenthusiastic reaction to the characters' outdated clothing style. He hired Italian fashion designers, including some from Dolce & Gabbana and Prada, to give the characters a more modern appearance. Flora underwent several changes because Straffi felt test audiences disliked her design. She was originally drawn with glasses and a lighter skin tone; for the full series, her glasses were removed and she was given darker skin to look \\"more Latin\\". The Winx fairies' male counterparts, the Specialists, were created in response to a request from RAI that the series should feature male leads. According to Iginio Straffi, each of the Winx fairies' personalities were made as different as possible so \\"teenagers from all over the world can identify themselves with the character they think they are most like\\". After the premiere of the first season worldwide, the production team heard that American viewers noticed the absence of black characters in the show. In response, Straffi designed a sixth fairy named Aisha, who has darker skin than the others. She was loosely based on Beyonc√© and was introduced in the first episode of the second season. The fourth season introduces a seventh member, Roxy, who occasionally joins the other fairies. Winx Club *' is the Fairy of the Dragon Flame.

Formed in 1939 and assigned to the 6th Division, the regiment was deployed to the United Kingdom to defend against a possible invasion in 1940 before being sent to North Africa, where it briefly saw action prior to being sent to Greece and Crete in 1941. In 1942, the regiment returned to Australia, after which it did not see action again until late in the war when it was committed to the Aitape‚ÄìWewak campaign in 1944‚Äì45. Following the end of the war, the regiment returned to Australia and was disbanded in January 1946. History Formed on 1 November 1939 at Wayville, South Australia, the regiment had an establishment of 32 officers and 595 other ranks, which were drawn from all six Australian states and the Northern Territory.. Its first commanding officer was Lieutenant Colonel Athol Hobbs. The majority of the officers and non-commissioned officers were appointed from the Militia. South Australian recruits represented the largest intake and were organised into a complete subunit, the 5th Battery, while recruits from the other states were allocated to the 6th Battery.. The regiment began basic training at Woodside Camp during November, before moving to Ingleburn, New South Wales, the following month where more involved training was undertaken. Basic equipment and vehicles were received at this time, but no artillery pieces were issued.. In May 1940, the regiment embarked on HMT Queen Mary bound for the Middle East. En route, the convoy was diverted to the United Kingdom following the German invasion of France. Arriving there in June, the regiment joined other elements of the Second Australian Imperial Force in the United Kingdom. Established at Tidworth Camp in Wiltshire,. and then later at Colchester, the regiment was employed on garrison duties to defend against a potential German invasion following the Fall of France. During this time, it was partially broken up to provide personnel to fill out the newly forming 2/31st, 2/32nd and 2/33rd Infantry Battalions. In August, the regiment received a new commanding officer when Lieutenant Colonel Horace Strutt took over. Shortly after this, the regiment was equipped with 25-pounder artillery pieces and Morris gun tractors. It was the first Australian artillery regiment to receive the 25-pounders. With the threat of invasion over, the regiment was moved to North Africa in November 1940 aboard the Empress of Canada. Arriving in late December, the regiment was assigned to the 6th Division, the regiment saw action against the Italians at Tobruk where they supported the 19th Infantry Brigade.. Benghazi fell next and after that was taken, the regiment deployed one battery forward in support of the 17th Infantry Brigade at Marsa Brega.. A short time later, though, the regiment was withdrawn back to Ikingi Maryut to re-organise.. In early April 1941, the regiment was sent to Greece, where it supported Australian and New Zealand infantry who were fighting to stop the German invasion there. After arriving on 6 April, the regiment moved forward towards the Yugoslav border where it attempted to defend Vevi in the Florina Valley three days later, where they had the distinction of being the first Australian artillery unit to engage German forces during the war. After mauling an SS force on the Itia‚ÄìVevi road,. as the Australian and New Zealand forces were pushed back to Servia on 11 April, amidst driving snow the regiment fought a desperate rearguard effort around the Klidi Pass, firing over open sights at advancing German infantry. Falling back by battery through thick mud, the regiment came under attack from German fighter-bombers before they eventually affected their withdrawal.. A disastrous series of withdrawals followed in which the regiment lost all of its equipment. A week later, further withdrawals took them towards Elasson, where the regiment was briefly attached in support of the 6th New Zealand Brigade.. On 18 April, the fighting was so intense that the regiment's guns fire over 6,000 rounds in a twenty-four-hour period as it attempted to thwart the advance of a German armoured column near Mount Olympus.. Later the regiment supported the 4th New Zealand Brigade around Erithrai. Finally, on 27 April the regiment was evacuated from Greece on board HMS Ajax and withdrawn back to Crete.. Organised as part of the ad hoc Cremor Force,. the regiment was initially assigned as a makeshift infantry unit to carry out garrison duties, in early May the regiment was re-equipped with captured Italian and French pieces including 75 mm and 100 mm guns, the regiment was assigned a coastal defence role and moved to Georgiopolis, on the south-east coast of Suda Bay, where the men set to work digging-in in the hills overlooking the beach.. When the fighting broke out following the arrival of German parachute troops on 20 May, the regiment was transported to Maleme airfield.. Another battery was detached to Retimo and in these places the regiment fought with its guns in support of the 19th Infantry Brigade, while around Meg Khorafia some of the regiment's personnel were thrown into the line as infantry.. Around Galatas, as the Germans pressed hard against the Australian and New Zealand defences, the regiment found itself holding the line as the infantry fell back, and as the guns fired over open sights, the gunners defended themselves with small arms.. Later during the month, as the Allies were forced back towards Sphakia, to prevent the Germans from capturing it, the regiment had to destroy most of its equipment. Two of the captured 75 mm guns were saved, though, and were manpacked by men from 'B' Troop over mountainous terrain to act in a rearguard role between Sphakia and Suda, while the Royal Navy attempted to evacuate the stranded troops.. The regiment continued to fight until it was withdrawn by sea on 31 May, leaving behind 129 men who were captured by the Germans.. Amongst these were the men from 'B' Troop, who had formed the rearguard protecting the evacuation beach. After the departure of the last transport ship, they attempted to evade capture but were eventually rounded up by German patrols.. The regiment's total losses for Greece and Crete were 27 killed and 47 wounded. In addition to the men captured on Crete, one other had been captured in Greece. Those that were captured were first sent to Salonica before being sent to a number of prisoner of wars camp in Germany, Italy and Austria... While prisoners, numerous escape attempts were made by men from the 2/3rd, although ultimately only four men successfully avoided recapture following their escape.. One of the regiment's Short 25-pounders near Danmap, New Guinea, January 1945 While being reformed and re- equipped in Palestine, the regiment received a new commanding officer in October 1941 with the arrival of Lieutenant Colonel Lewis Dyke, a regular officer.. A third battery ‚Äì the 53rd ‚Äì was raised within the regiment at this time and the regiment adopted a new structure which saw each battery consist of two four-gun troops.. This resulted in the regiment's authorised strength reaching 736 personnel of all ranks.. The regiment remained in the Middle East until February 1942 when the 6th Division was recalled back to Australia in response to the growing threat posed by Japan's entry into the war. Arriving in Adelaide in March, the regiment was stationed at Aldgate until May when it was transferred to Townsville, Queensland, by rail. There, the regiment was reallocated to the 5th Division and assigned a coastal defence role in Cairns, operating antiquated 18-pounder guns. In November, Lieutenant Colonel Gordon Bleby took over as commanding officer. In June 1943, the regiment returned to the 6th Division and was moved to the Atherton Tablelands, where it was re- organised for jungle warfare. This resulted in the regiment's establishment dropping to 688 personnel. It was also re-equipped with a quantity of short 25-pounders as well as some of the standard pieces. Throughout late 1943 and into 1944, the regiment was based around Wondecla, in Queensland. Due to a perception in the Army that there was little need for artillery in jungle warfare, the regiment did not see action again until December 1944 when it joined the 6th Division's campaign in Aitape‚ÄìWewak,. once again assigned to the 19th Brigade.. In January 1945, the regiment received four 4.2-inch mortars to assist in the provision of close support to long-range infantry patrols; two 155 mm guns were also added to the regiment's equipment scale.. Throughout January and February, the regiment supported the advance from Aitape to the Danmap River.. As the campaign progressed, in March they were switched to operations between Maprik and Wewak.. Late in the campaign, Bleby left the regiment on promotion to 1st Division Headquarters and was replaced by Lieutenant Colonel Cecil Chapman.. The regiment saw action right up until the end of the war, and had the distinction of firing the last fire mission in the New Guinea campaign, when on 15 August, it fired 1,000 rounds on \\"six regimental targets\\" eight hours after Japan's surrender to deal with a Japanese artillery unit that was continuing to hold out.. Following the conclusion of hostilities, the regiment returned to Australia and was eventually disbanded at Puckapunyal, Victoria, on 18 January 1946.. The regiment's casualties amounted to 46 men killed in action or died of wounds or accident, 49 wounded and 130 captured out of a total of 1,887 men who served in its ranks.. The following decorations were awarded to 2/3rd members: one Distinguished Service Order, three Orders of the British Empire, four Military Crosses, two Distinguished Conduct Medals, one Military Medal and 43 Mentions in Despatches..

Trail description The Pequot Trail extends from its northern terminus on Route 165 in an area known as Hellgate in Preston, and follows a power line south through wetland areas, rocky ridges, and forest roads to Route 2, where it crosses and follows Lincoln Park Road to Lincoln Park. From there it enters a park path to Rose Hill Road, crossing into Ledyard and back onto private land to the top of Rose Hill. There it is on the southern edge of the state-owned Rose Hill Wildlife Management Area until it exits onto Thomas Road eastward to and across Mathewson Mill Road to Fanning Road. Just before the private Mashantucket Pequot Burial Ground it turns south through a wooded area to the southern terminus on Coachman Pike. The Pequot Trail is primarily used for hiking, backpacking, picnicking, hunting, and, in the winter, snowshoeing. Portions of the trail are suitable for cross-country skiing, letterboxing, geocaching, and bird watching. =Trail route= Varied terrain, views, hemlocks, rhododendron, and geologic features add interest along the trail. Plans are underway to lengthen the trail and return the southern terminus to its original location with the Narragansett Trail on Lantern Hill in North Stonington via the Mashantucket Tribal Nation property near their highly regarded museum and research center. Several small streams cut across the trail, eventually flowing into the Thames River. The trail crosses a state wildlife management area, a town park, utility company property, and private properties. History and folklore The Blue-Blazed Pequot Trail was created by the Connecticut Forest and Park Association. Portions of the original trail, particularly the sections between the present southern terminus and Lantern Hill, were used by native Americans for centuries. Some of what happened during the early colonial period and before are explained in displays at the Mashantucket Pequot Museum and may eventually be described in interpretive signage on the trail when sections through the area are opened. Remnants of the original trail still exist as part of a trail system within the MPTN property around Lantern Hill. The route of the original trail blazed in the 1930s can be seen in the Connecticut Forest and Park Association's 1940 Connecticut Walk Book map of major trails. =Origin and name= The trail is named for The Mashantucket Pequot Tribe. =Historic sites= In addition to the Mashantucket Pequot sites, the highest point on the trail, about one mile from the northern end of the trail, is on land once belonging to the Mohegan sachem Uncas. Just north of that location the trail enters a narrow rocky constriction in a woods road. This is the place for which the area received the name Hellgate. There is Hellgate Farm on Miller Road in Preston at the end of this woods road. The other end of the woods road is on Brickyard Road, named for another historic feature of the town.Trumbull, http://www.accessgenealogy.com/native/tribes/delaware/wappingerhist.htm \\"Pequot\\" was also the name of the area of Connecticut around and east of the Thames River and is the original name of the Thames River. For more information on the Mashantucket Pequot Tribe of native-Americans (\\"American Indians\\") see the Wikipedia entries on the Pequot, Mashantucket, or Foxwoods. =Folklore= The circumstances surrounding the origin of the name Hellgate, the history of Uncas' connection to the land, the relations between the Mohegans and the Pequots, the brickyard, the original occupants of homes now only showing as foundations or cellar holes, the use and reasons for some odd stone walls at the bottom of a ravine and the occasional \\"frog war\\" that happens in the wetland meadow area are all things that can give the casual hiker something to think about on his or her leisurely hike. Hiking the trail The trail is blazed with blue rectangles. Trail descriptions are available from a number of commercial and non-commercial sources, and a complete guidebook is published by the Connecticut Forest and Park Association. It is regularly maintained, and is considered easy hiking, with very few sections of rugged or moderately difficult hiking. All of the trail is closed to motor vehicles. There are no camping facilities along the trail, and camping is prohibited in the areas along the trail. Weather along the route is typical of Connecticut. Conditions on exposed ridge tops and summits may be harsher during cold or stormy weather.NOAA Lightning is a hazard on exposed summits and ledges during thunderstorms. Snow is common in the winter and may necessitate the use of snowshoes. Ice can form on exposed ledges and summits, making hiking dangerous without special equipment. Extensive flooding in ponds, puddles and streams may occur in the late winter or early spring, overflowing into the trail and causing very muddy conditions. In this case fairly high waterproof boots are recommended. Some parts of the trail follow forest roads which often contain ruts from ATVs and four-wheel drive vehicles. Biting insects can be bothersome during warm weather. Parasitic deer ticks (which are known to carry Lyme disease) are a potential hazard. Almost all of the trail is adjacent to, or is on lands where hunting and the use of firearms are permitted. Wearing bright orange clothing during the hunting season (Fall through December) is recommended. Conservation and maintenance of the trail corridor A Connecticut Forest & Park (CFPA) Trail Manager maintains the trail, and CFPA can be contacted at (860) 346-2372. Comments on trail conditions are appreciated, and can be sent by email to , left in the trail register at the halfway point of the trail, or reported by phone at the above number.

He was born in a Shepherd family Akkol Karnataka and took Samadhi at Adamapur Maharashtra. His teachings concentrated on a moral code of love, forgiveness, helping others, charity, contentment, inner peace and devotion to the God and guru. 'Muley Maharaj', Vithoba and Rakhumai were his Gurus. His famous teachings were \\"Knowledge is life and ignorance is death\\".  Early life  Balumama was born in 1892, in a village called Akkol(‡≤Ö‡≤ï‡≥ç‡≤ï‡≥ã‡≤≥) in Chikkodi taluk of Belgaum district in Karnataka. His father's name was Mayappa and mother's name was Sundara. He spent his childhood with his parents but was always lost in meditation. He later went on to live with his sister and was married to her daughter against his will. The marriage did not last long. He was given about 15 sheep by his in-laws which he started to tend.  Miracles  While shepherding his sheep, he was known to have performed several miracles and helped poor and downtrodden people. He used to travel long distances with his sheep in parts of Maharashtra and Karnataka. He was fluent in both Kannada and Marathi. Whatever he said came true without fail. He had followers amongst the rural poor, who began worshipping him as a saint. The sheep which Balumama had were considered sacred. If the herd of Balumama's sheep stayed or passed through a farm or a field, the owner was bound to have prosperity.  Temple  Balumama attained samadhi at the age of 74 in 1967 in a village called Admapur in Kolhapur district of Maharashtra. A temple was built in his memory in Adamapur which lies between Nipani in Karnataka and Radhanagari in Maharashtra. The Temple is looked after by the \\"Shri Balumama Sansthana\\". The small flock have now grown to 40,000 sheep, which are looked after by his devotees.  Belief  The current flock of sheep which are the progeny of original sheep of Balumama are still considered sacred.

Her magnum opus on Jewish cuisine, the Complete International Jewish Cookbook was published in 1976, and has been revised three times since, most recently in 2011. Her obituary in The Guardian described her singular accomplishment as the melding of \\"contemporary cooking with Jewish dietary laws, regulations that not only prohibit the use of pig meat and shellfish, but also the mixing of dairy products with meat\\". Evelyn Rose was also \\"highly aware of the changes in culinary trends, particularly the move away from the fatty foods so typical of traditional Jewish cooking ... her modern, health- conscious recipes exemplified the changes that had taken place over her long career.\\" Career Rose was evacuated to the United States, and her school in Seattle provided a home-economics course; it was this experience that started her on the way to a career in cooking and food writing. On her return to Britain, she declined the offer of a university place to study psychology, and attended the Manchester College of Housecraft, where she specialised in demonstration techniques. Her television work started in the 1950s, when she wrote to the BBC suggesting a course in Jewish cookery and she later became the resident cook for Granada Television in the 1970s. Rose was the first woman commissioner at the Meat and Livestock Commission, and was made an MBE in 1989. She was also an honorary life fellow of the Institute of Home Economics, and a former chair of the National Guild of Food Writers. Rose wrote a weekly food column for the Jewish Chronicle from 1963, and never missed a single issue, and wrote a food column for the wine magazine, Decanter. Personal life Born in Manchester, Rose lived in the city all her life except for the four years she spent in the United States as an evacuee. Evelyn Rose was survived by her husband Myer, whom she married in 1948. Myer and Evelyn had three children; sons David and Alan, and a daughter, Judi. During her time in the United States Rose worked as a secretary at the MGM studios in California. She was invited to audition for the lead role in National Velvet, which was won by Elizabeth Taylor. Judi assisted her mother with the writing of her column and books in her later years, and produced the third revised edition of The Complete International Jewish Cookbook in 2011 following two years work. Judi and her mother also wrote The First-Time Cookbook in 1982 for children leaving home, and Mother and Daughter Jewish Cooking in 2000.

The hospital started operations on 20 May 1959 and merged with Changi Hospital to form the current Changi General Hospital located in Simei. The premises of the hospital had been demolished since then. History To meet the growing demand for medical services, the Singapore government had decided to build a new hospital for the chronic sick at Thomson Road, named \\"Thomson Road Hospital\\". Established on 20 May 1959, physicians practicing in Singapore and overseas received their postgraduate clinical training in the hospital. Nursing training was also formalised when the School of Nursing for Pupil Assistant Nurse was officially opened within Thomson Road Hospital in September 1965. In the 1960s, the patient load gradually increased and new facilities, such as a surgical block and an X-ray department, were added. The hospital also started offering neurosurgery in 1965 and obstetrics and gynaecology in 1969. It was renamed \\"Thomson General Hospital\\" in September 1965. During the 1970s, the hospital introduced new clinical specialties, which included neonatology and orthopaedic surgery. The Department of Anaesthesia was also formally established in 1971. The hospital was then renamed the \\"Toa Payoh Hospital\\" named after the town of the hospital was serving. In the 1980s, the current facilities of the hospital were unable to cope with increasing numbers of patients from the surrounding estates, including Toa Payoh, Ang Mo Kio, Yishun, Serangoon and Bishan. The management of the hospital then decided to move to a bigger site to increase its bed capacity. =Restructuring and closure= The hospital was restructured on 1 April 1990 and had also created new programmes to improve the services and care. More medical services were provided with the introduction of the ENT department in 1994 and the Eye department in 1996. Within a year, it had become the second busiest in Singapore. However, though the efforts to improve the services and care, the hospital's patient load increased to maximum capacity in mid-1990s. The hospital faced a shortage of beds and was then finally relocated to Simei as it was merged with Changi Hospital to form Changi General Hospital and was defunct on 15 February 1997.

His father, Christian II, had ruled jointly with his uncle, Otto I. After Christian II died in 1233, Otto I acted as guardian for the underage John I. When John I came of age, he ruled jointly with Otto I. After Otto I died in 1251, John I ruled alone. In 1244, Otto I and John I together founded the Cistercian Rosenthal monastery in Menslage. In 1251, the monastery moved to a fort in the B√∂rsteler Forest, which John I already owned. In 1258 and 1259, he fought in the Bremen Prince-Archbishopric Feud on the side of his cousin Hildebold of Wunstorf against R√ºstringen, √ñstringen and Stedingen. When the feud had ended, he kept the territories he had conquered. After a dispute with the City of Bremen, he had to cede the castle in Berne. As a replacement, John I and his uncle built a castle in Delmenhorst, which provoked a strong reaction from Stedingen. Like his predecessors, he had many disputes with his relatives, the Counts of Oldenburg-Wildeshausen. Ultimately, their county was divided between the bishops of M√ºnster and Bremen. This resulted in Oldenburg and Delmenhorst being almost completely surrounded by these territories, and led to centuries of disputes between the Counts of Oldenburg and the two Prince-Bishops. John I was a direct patrilineal ancestor of many Kings of Denmark and Tsars of Russia.

It is sometimes referred to as a Medical Museum‚Äîthe only one in Cyprus. A sign on the facade says: \\"Larnaka Cultural Walk - Kyriazis Medical Museum - A unique in its kind museum in Cyprus which presents the medical, healing and health history of the island.\\" It is located on Karaolis and Dimitriou Street. It is open on Wednesdays and Saturdays from 9 AM to 12.30. Entrance is free. The Museum organises cultural events, lectures for the public and activities with medical interest. It also functions as a 'health hangout' for healthcare professionals and the general public alike.  History  It was opened by Cyprus Health Minister Stavros Malas in October 2011.Philelephtheros newspaper, 15 October 2011 Its founder is Marios Kyriazis,Prima Scala magazine, p. 44 June 2012 a descendant of four generations of doctors and pharmacists in Larnaca. It is housed in a traditional restored and listed town mansion, donated by Kyriazis.Iatrikos Kosmos, Journal of the Cyprus medical Association February 2012, p. 12 Kyriazis has donated items including items and books inherited from his grandfather Neoclis Kyriazis (1878‚Äì1956) and from his great grandfather Antonios Tsepis (1843‚Äì1905) both of whom practiced in Larnaca. The collections of the museum begun in 1990 but due to lack of suitable space the items remained stored, although occasionally, these were exhibited within other medical or historical exhibitions. The entrance hall  Exhibits  Documents with old Cypriot poems and curses with medical content, and a number of virtually forgotten sayings and poems with medical slant of Byzantian, Frankish, Venetian or Ottoman origins are exhibited on walls. The sayings and poems were shaped by a history of lack of medical facilities, inadequate treatments and absence of health prevention. = The Hall = The walls of the main entrance hall (Iliakos) are lined with framed pictures displaying the history of medicine from antiquity, through the Middle Ages and early 1800s. Examples include depictions of operations without anaesthetic, treatment of cholera or the plague, and treatments in monasteries. = Room 1 = This is the first room encountered on the left of the main entrance. There are Pharmacist‚Äôs cupboards displaying original bottles, tablets, injections, and doctor‚Äôs prescriptions. Items include a bullet extractor and a spring-loaded device for physiotherapy of muscles in the hand (where each finger's movement‚Äîof a hand that is closing‚Äîis counteracted by the force of separate springs, as the springs are stretched). Among other exhibits are a phallic item believed to have been used in the treatment of female hysteria in ancient times, and a rare find: oil from the Larnaka salt lake which was used in skin wounds and insect bites. In this room there is also a display of many old traditional Cypriot poems or sayings with medical content. = Room 2 = An X-ray machine, an electronic EKG measuring instrument, an ob/gynaecological bench and a surgical table are among exhibits in room two. The display information on the gynaecological bench states that it was used by nearly half of the original population of Larnaka. There is also a pharmacist‚Äôs display unit with several medical items from the 1850s including cupping material, leeches, a tonsil extractor, a Victorian magneto-electric device and cautery items. Surgical equipment. = Room 3 = Although there are several medical and pharmaceutical items exhibited, this room is served mainly as a study/research facility. A medical library with books in Greek, Cypriot, French and English is available to students or academic researchers. A pharmaceutical display unit contains items for making hand-made pills. = Room 4 = Original surgical amputation instruments and a trough with wood shavings (to absorb blood) with a mock amputated hand are among exhibits in room four. There is a replica of the Hippocratic Ladder, a wooden ladder used to treat dislocations of the hip or of the neck. The injured leg was pulled by a ceramic pot full of stones or water. A medical partition donated by the old Larnaca Hospital serves as a poster display unit with medical cartoons or information about traditional Cypriot therapies. Other items include a doctor's examination couch and equipment for treating tuberculosis. Books are in all the four rooms. On request, permission to manipulate exhibits can be informally granted. = Garden = The garden is a traditional urban residential area where meetings or public events are being held. There is a collection of some Cypriot healing herbs such as mint, basil, lavender, sage, melissa and marjoram. The garden is accessible to the public, as this is used also as a health hub, where herbal and other health drinks are served. A covered area has a further display facility where outdoors exhibitions have taken place.  Architecture  The museum has a neoclassic-type fa√ßade with blue window shutters, high ceilings, wooden floors in the rooms, and the obligatory decorated ceramic pattern in the ‚Äòiliakos‚Äô floor complete the picture.Luke Chrysanthou, Sunjet magazine, Cyprus Airways June 2012 The house used to be a private residence, but the street where the museum is located had an unusually high number of doctors, nurses or pharmacists living there. Approximately 50% of all local residents had a medical connection.  Philosophy of its management  The aim is to safeguard the medical cultural heritage of Cyprus for future generations of medical scientists and to identify facts of sociological, scientific, medical or literary interest. The museum aims to reach any member of the public, of any age, and to facilitate exchange of information, learning and discussion on current health practices based on the past.  Notable Events  The Medical Museum has organised the following cultural events: April 2012: ‚ÄòStrange Traditional Cypriot Treatments‚Äô, under the auspices of the Mayor of Larnaca, also broadcast on Cyprus Broadcasting Corporation channel 1 September 2013: ‚ÄòWorld Tourism Day‚Äô events and practical demonstrations May 2013: ‚Äò2000 years from the death of Apollonios of Kition‚Äô under the auspices of the Cyprus Health Minister. This event included Ancient Greek wrestling (Pankration), medical theatre and presentations. 12 September 2013: Exhibition of medical cartoons, under the auspices of the Mayor of Larnaca. 26 September 2013: ‚ÄòMedical Saints of Cyprus‚Äô under the auspices of the Bishop of Kition. Presentations from Kalogera Primary School students and other lectures. 22 May 2014: An evening of Cypriot medicine, in association with the Larnaca Doctors Association, and the Larnaca Municipality.  Ongoing research projects  Three main research projects are currently being undertaken: 1\\\\. A compilation of a Cypriot medical dictionary. The aim is to collect and publish all Cypriot words with a medical meaning. Several interested parties are now collaborating in order to prepare a complete collection of all Cypriot medical terms including anatomy, pharmacology and nursing. 2\\\\. A study of ‚Äòstrange‚Äô traditional healing practices. This includes anything unusual or weird used in the past in order to heal or ameliorate illness. Examples include baked lizards and gunpowder used in baldness, donkey manure in infections, and live mice in a variety of health recipes. 3\\\\. The collection, display and subsequent publication of medieval, Byzantian or early Cypriot literature with medical content. This includes poems and ballads, wishes and curses, folk stories, and couplets.

James Keith is recorded as being master of a lodge in Saint Petersburg in 1732-34.Andrew MacKillop, Steve Murdoch.

Several years later his cousin John Keith, 3rd Earl of Kintore was appointed provincial grand master of Russia by the Grand Lodge of England. Catherine II's factotum Ivan Yelagin succeeded in reorganizing Russian Freemasonry into a far-reaching nationwide system that united some 14 lodges and about 400 government officials. He secured English authorization of the first Russian Grand Lodge and became its provincial grand master.Lelliƒ≠ Petrovich Zamoƒ≠skiƒ≠. Behind the fa√ßade of the Masonic Temple. Progress Publishers, 1989. Page 90. He favoured an archaic ritual of blood initiation which involved a symbolic commingling of blood. Yelagin's chief rival was George von Reichel from Braunschweig who championed a different system introduced by Johann Wilhelm Kellner von Zinnendorf, the grand master of the Grand Landlodge of the Freemasons of Germany. At least seven lodges founded in 1772-76 acknowledged Reichel's authority. The Yelagin-Reichel feud was ended in 1776 by the unification of all the Russian lodges under the auspices of the Minerva zu den drei Palmen Lodge in Berlin. The following year Gustav III of Sweden went to St. Petersburg to initiate Grand Duke Paul into Masonry.Magnus Olausson. Catherine the Great and Gustav III. Boktryck AB, 1999. Page 170. Semyon Gamaleya (1743-1822), a Ukrainian-born Freemason, was the first to translate into Russian the major works of Jakob B√∂hme. In 1781, Nikolay Novikov and Ivan Schwarz, two professors of the Moscow University, set up the Learned Society of Friends in that city. They were dissatisfied with the Swedish Rite that was practised in St. Petersburg. Duke Ferdinand of Brunswick-Wolfenb√ºttel as the grand master of the lodges in Germany invited Schwarz to take part in the Wilhelmsbad Masonic Congress (1782) where Russia was recognized as the 8th autonomous province of the Rite of Strict Observance.Raffaella Faggionato. A Rosicrucian Utopia in Eighteenth-Century Russia: The Masonic Circle of N.I. Novikov. Springer, 2005. Page 251. A schism developed between the lodges of Moscow and St. Petersburg as the former drifted toward a form of Rosicrucianism.Boris Telepnef. Outline of the History of Russian Freemasonry. Kessinger Publishing, 2003. Page 21. Catherine the Great suspected the Masons of turning her son Paul against herself, of being a tool in the hands of her enemy King of Prussia, and viewed their attitude toward women as backwards. In 1785, she clamped down upon Novikov's printing house and had some 461 titles confiscated. When she saw her new palace in Tsaritsyno adorned with ornamentation suggestive of the cryptic symbols of Freemasonry, Catherine had it pulled down. Novikov was later jailed, and other leading Freemasons had to flee Russia. Anti-Masonic measures were revoked as soon as Paul ascended the Russian throne in 1796. Increasingly haunted by the spectre of the French Revolution, Paul came to distrust Freemasonry and Martinism.Henri Troyat. Alexander of Russia: Napoleon's Conqueror. Grove Press, 2003. Page 36. Within three years of his reign all secret societies were suppressed, and the lodges closed of their own accord. Two years later Paul was assassinated. The lodges flourished under his successor Alexander I, although it remains unknown whether Alexander himself was an initiate. The most influential figure of this period was Alexander Labzin. Alexander Vitberg's design for Cathedral of Christ the Saviour was suggestive of a Masonic temple.Konstantin Akinsha, Grigorij Kozlov, Sylvia Hochfield. The Holy Place: Architecture, Ideology, and History in Russia. Yale University Press, 2007. Page 30. The Grand Lodge Astraea was formed in 1815. It united nineteen smaller lodges and counted 1404 members. Its rival was the Swedish Provincial Lodge of Russia, with seven smaller feuding lodges under its umbrella and 230 members. Leo Tolstoy describes some of the rituals in his novel War and Peace and mentions Fyodor Klyucharyov, a noted Masonic poet. According to Filipp Vigel, Freemasonry did little but to provide a fashionable pastime for bored nobles.http://www.krasplace.ru/vigel13 As Emperor Alexander grew increasingly conservative, the Masonic-style political clubs were outlawed in 1822. This interdict was extended by Nicholas I in the wake of the Decembrist Uprising, since the Decembrists had sprung from the Masonic lodges.Lauren G. Leighton. The Esoteric Tradition in Russian Romantic Literature: Decembrism and Freemasonry. Penn State University, 1994. Freemasonry was legalized and enjoyed a brief revival after the First Russian Revolution. The Grand Orient of Russian People seceded from the Grand Orient de France, with Nikolai Vissarionovich Nekrasov and Alexander Fyodorovich Kerensky as its main leaders. The Bolsheviks had all the lodges closed in the wake of the October Revolution in 1917. =Grand Lodge of Russia= In 1992 and 1993, on the territory of Russia, the Grande Loge Nationale Fran√ßaise, created the lodge: \\"Harmony\\" (Moscow), \\"Lotus\\" (Moscow), \\"New Astrea\\" (St. Petersburg), \\"Gamayun\\" (Voronezh).–°–µ—Ä–≥–µ–π –ö–∞—Ä–ø–∞—á–µ–≤. –ú–∞—Å–æ–Ω—ã. –°–ª–æ–≤–∞—Ä—å. –í–µ–ª–∏–∫–æ–µ –∏—Å–∫—É—Å—Å—Ç–≤–æ –∫–∞–º–µ–Ω—â–∏–∫–æ–≤. ‚Äî –ú.: ¬´–ê–°–¢: –û–ª–∏–º–ø¬ª, 2008. ‚Äî —Å. 82. ‚Äî Georgiy Dergachev - First Grand Master of GLoR (1995-2002) * Lodge \\"Harmony\\" was established on January 14, 1992 in Paris.

The reason for the exit was: the disagreement of the brothers with the domestic policy pursued by the then leadership of Grand Lodge of Russia. From the three-volume book on the history of Russian Freemasonry in the 20th century by the historian of Freemasonry Andrey Serkov it follows that the following lodges have left: Harmony No. 1, Lotus No. 2, Astrea No. 3, Jupiter No. 7, Quatuor Coronati No. 8 and the Orion No. 15.http://www.recognitioncommission.org/2005/03/28/february-2005-report/ On April 16, 2001, a constituent assembly was held, after which it was announced the creation of the ‚ÄúRussian Grand Regular Lodge‚Äù (RGRL). In 2007, after the GLR assembly, a group of Masons, members of the Harmony, Lotus, Phoenix, left GLR. After the release of the members of the GLR, they held a meeting with the members of the Russian Grand Regular Lodge, during which it was decided to unite and choose their name - the Grand Lodge of Russia. A clarification was added to the new name, led by the Grand Master A. S..http://www.recognitioncommission.org/2008/06/02/2008-report/ In June 2008, some members of the association decided to establish relations with the Grand Lodge of France. On October 11, 2008, at its solemn assembly, under the patronage of the Grand Lodge of France, the United Grand Lodge of Russia (UGLR) was established. The United Grand Lodge of Russia was granted a patent of the Grand Lodge of France for the right to carry out work on the Ancient and Accepted Scottish Rite. The United Grand Lodge of Russia was included in the establishment of 11 lodges.http://www.recognitioncommission.org/2009/05/14/2009-commission- report/http://portal-credo.ru/site/print.php?act=news&id;=65885 On the 2nd of July 2019, the UGLR counted near of 200 freemasons united over 11 Lodges.

In spring of 2013 Encke was banned from racing after failing a drug test. He returned to racing in 2014 and was placed in three races including the Irish St. Leger. He sustained a fatal injury in training in October 2014. Background Encke, named after Encke's Comet, was a bay horse with a narrow white stripe bred in Kentucky by the Darley Stud. He was sired by Kingmambo, whose other progeny include the British Classic winners Russian Rhythm, King's Best, Henrythenavigator Virginia Waters and Rule of Law as well as major winners in Japan (El Condor Pasa), France (Divine Proportions) and the United States (Lemon Drop Kid). Encke was the second foal of his dam, Shawanda, a top class racemare who won the Irish Oaks and the Prix Vermeille for her owner the Aga Khan in 2005. At the end of her racing career she was bought by Sheikh Mohammed to become a broodmare for his Darley Stud. Her first foal was Encke's full brother Genius Beast, who won the Sandown Classic Trial in 2011. Encke raced in the colours of the Maktoum family's Godolphin Racing organisation and was trained by Mahmood Al Zarooni. Racing career =2011: two-year-old season= Encke began his racing career at the 2011 St Leger meeting at Doncaster where he finished second by half a length to Perennial in a one-mile maiden race. On 1 October Encke started 8/13 favourite for a similar race at Newmarket. Ridden by Richard Hughes, he took the lead a furlong from the finish and pulled clear to win easily by four and a half lengths. The colt's owners then paid a supplementary entry fee to run Encke in the Racing Post Trophy, but he was forced to miss the race through injury. =2012: three-year-old season= On his three-year-old debut, Encke carried 126 pounds in a handicap race over ten furlongs at Sandown Park in July. Ridden for the first time by Mickael Barzalona he took the lead two furlongs from the finish and held on to win by half a length and a neck from Ginger Jack and Tropical Beat. Later in the month, Encke was moved up in class for the Group Three Gordon Stakes at Goodwood Racecourse. The race developed into a protracted struggle between Encke and Noble Mission, who raced together throughout the final furlong before the latter won by a nose. A month later, Encke ran in the Great Voltigeur Stakes at York and finished third to Thought Worthy. According to Zarooni there were excuses for both defeats: he said that Encke had been unsuited by the course at Goodwood and the slow pace at York. At Doncaster on 15 September Encke started a 25/1 outsider in a nine-runner field for the St Leger. The Irish colt Camelot started the 2/5 favourite to become the first British Triple Crown winner since Nijinsky after winning the 2000 Guineas and Epsom Derby. Barzalona restrained Encke in the early stages before moving up to dispute the lead in the straight. As Camelot's rider Joseph O'Brien was trying to obtain space for a clear run, Barzalona sent the Encke into a clear lead approaching the final furlong and he held the challenge of Camelot to win by three quarters of a length. After the race Zarooni, who was winning his second classic following the victory of Blue Bunting in the 2011 1000 Guineas admitted that he had not wanted to run the colt in the race, but had been persuaded to do so by Sheikh Mohammed. =2013: four-year-old season= In May 2013 Encke was one of twenty-two of Al- Zarooni's horses to test positive for anabolic steroids in an out of competition test conducted by the British Horseracing Authority. The horse was banned from racing for six months. The colt had previously passed drug tests before and after the St Leger and a BHA spokesman said that \\"we can be certain he was not under the benefits of substances\\" at the time of his classic victory. Charlie Appleby took over the training of most of the Zarooni-trained horses, including Encke. =2014: five-year-old season= Encke eventually returned to the racecourse on 1 August 2014, when he started the 6/1 third favourite for the Group Three Glorious Stakes at Goodwood. Ridden by William Buick, he took the lead in the straight but was overtaken and beaten one and a quarter lengths into second place by the favourite Pether's Moon. In September he was sent to Ireland for the Irish St. Leger and finished third behind Brown Panther and Leading Light. On 4 October, Encke was again matched against Pether's Moon in the Cumberland Lodge Stakes at Ascot Racecourse. He led for most of the way but was overtaken in the straight and beaten into third place behind Pether's Moon and the Irish-trained Parish Hall. On the morning of 14 October, Encke was engaged in a routine training gallop when he sustained a serious injury to a hind leg. Complications ensued and the horse was euthanised on the same day. Appleby said that \\"Encke was a talented racehorse and will be sorely missed as he was one of the yard's favourites\\".

He attempted to set up a Roger Corman type \\"nurses\\" film which he would produce and direct budgeted at $250,000 and then a crime drama set against the background of the massage parlour business called Sexy Little Me budgeted at $150,000, but was unable to find the money. However he could raise $50,000 and allocated directing duties to Richard Franklin, with whom Ginnane had worked with on the overseas marketing for The True Story of Eskimo Nell. Franklin and Ginnane wanted to make something commercial so their options were a bikie, horror or sex film. They decided to make a sex film with Franklin pushing to make it more of a comedy. Ross Dimsey wrote a script, originally called Fantale, which was a send up of Swedish sex education films such as Language of Love. Franklin: > With this thin veneer of medical 'therapy', or whatever, these films were > being shown in these little underground cinemas and so on around the place. > They were all essentially softcore, and we decided to make a kind of send-up > of one, really. Not because we wanted to do a send-up, but because we didn't > think we wanted to do a genuine one. We just wanted to make a fun film about > sex! Ginnane and Franklin had trouble finding actors who would appear in the film in Australia so only the linking scenes with the professor were shot in that country, with the sex scenes filmed in Los Angeles by Franklin and his cinematographer Vince Monton, using American porn stars. An old classmate of Franklin's from USC, Doug Knapp, was working in the area of porn and put them in touch with casting agent Bill Margold. The US shoot took ten days, the Australian shoot took one day. Franklin says that John Bluthal, who played the professor, ad-libbed some of his dialogue, and that the porn actors were paid around $200 a day, except for John Holmes who was paid around $400 a day. Franklin: > That was an era where hardcore was NOT being produced in L.A. In fact, as I > recall, we had the police call in on more than one occasion while we were > shooting, just to make sure we weren't doing hardcore. But I was told, and I > guess it would be evident if you studied the films of the era, but virtually > all of the actors did hardcore work, but they did that in San Francisco or > in Europe. But it was just a short period when hardcore porn was not‚Ä¶ There > was no problem shooting what they call T and A, tits and arse, but you > weren't allowed to have people fucking on the set. Despite the presence of American actors, Franklin says it was always his intention that the film be made primarily for the Australian market. Reception Although the movie was entirely soft core, around 45 seconds were cut out by the Australian censor prior to release. It was originally banned completely in the UK by the BBFC and is still only available with heavy cuts. The film was extremely popular at the box office and ran for eight months and by 1979 had taken approximately $650,000 in Australia, despite being banned in Queensland. It led to a sequel Fantasm Comes Again (1977). Franklin says its success enabled him to get financing for Patrick. > Even though I had done it under a pseudonym, it was perceived that I could > make films that would make money... I usually don't list it in my > filmography, not because I'm ashamed to have done it - I don't know whether > Coppola lists HIS in his filmography! - but because it was such a low budget > thing, and done in as I recall ten or eleven days, so it was really just > like a series of student films strung together, if that makes sense.

In these largely fictionalized stories, he was shot to death with countless arrows by the vengeful Song commander Pan Renmei while seeking reinforcement for his trapped father in battles against the Liao Dynasty army. \\"Qilang\\" which means \\"7th son\\" is a nickname rather than an official given name. His official name is usually given as Yang Yansi (Ê•äÂª∂Âó£).Other versions such as Yang Yanci (Ê•äÂª∂ÊÖà) also exist. See In fiction Born in a military family, Yang Qilang practiced martial arts from an early age after his parents Yang Ye and She Saihua, as well as his 6 elder brothers. The novel Records of the Two Songs, South and North (1593) portrayed him as young, impulsive and reckless, and mentioned a time in battle where he without notifying anyone decided to lead 3000 men for a night raid of the enemy's camp. He was ambushed and returned with only half the men, and was ordered to be executed by his father. He eventually received a severe beating of 40 blows which left him bloodied., ch. 59 =Killing Pan Bao in competition= One day a martial arts competition was held in the Tianqi Temple (Â§©ÈΩäÂªü) in the Song Dynasty capital Kaifeng, featuring Pan Bao (ÊΩòË±π) from the powerful Pan family. With no sense of sportsmanship, Pan had made the rules \\"to the death\\", confident that nobody dared to kill him considering his background: his sister had married Emperor Taizong, while his father Pan Renmei was a high-ranking minister and military commander. Yang Qilang who had sneaked out of the house was angered by Pan's arrogance and joined the competition, defeating and eventually killing Pan when the latter continued to dare him and insult his family. Realizing what he had done, Yang Qilang voluntarily submitted to the local police. A grief- stricken Pan Renmei pleaded to Emperor Taizong to have the entire Yang family executed, for \\"murdering the emperor's relative should be treated as treason\\". However, realizing the competition rules set by Pan Bao, Emperor Taizong merely sentenced Yang Qilang to 3 years in prison., act 7 Later, when Yang Qilang was pardoned by the emperor in face of an imminent war with the Liao Dynasty and reinstated to the military to \\"expiate crimes by good deeds\\", Pan Renmei decided to carry out \\"justice\\" himself., act 8 =Death by hundreds of arrows= Facing an invading Liao Dynasty army, commander-in-chief Pan Renmei still focused on revenge against the Yangs, and sent Yang Ye and his 7 sons to a trap without aid or food. During the battle of Golden Beach, only Yang Qilang, his 6th brother Yang Yanzhao, their father and a few soldiers were left, as the enemy forces closed in. Yang Liulang asked his younger brother to fight a way out to the headquarters for aid. When a badly injured and tired Yang Qilang finally arrived, Pan Renmei had him arrested, tied up on a pole, and ordered his soldiers to shoot arrows at him. For whatever reason, the first round of arrows all missed, so Pan Renmei picked up a bow and did the job himself. With dozens of arrows piercing his chest, Yang Qilang kept cursing at Pan Renmei until his death. Pan Renmei had the corpse thrown into the Yellow River which was later discovered by Yang Yanzhao's remaining men downstream., ch. 8, ch. 69, act 34 =Portrayal in films and TV series= * Wang Weinian in Generals of the Yang Family (1983) (as Yang Yanci) * Yang Shoulin in Generals of the Yang Family (1984) * Yao Chih-hung in Jagged Generals of the Yang Family (1984) * Tony Leung in The Yang's Saga (1985) * Chang Hung-lun in A Courageous Clan: Mu Kuei-ying (1989) * Cao Qinghua & Sun Hong in Generals of the Yang Family (1991) * Yan Kun in Warriors of the Yang Clan (2004) * Eddie Peng in The Young Warriors (2006) * Fu Xinbo in Saving General Yang (2013) Historical basis According to History of Song, Yang Ye's 7th eldest son Yang Yanbin (Ê•äÂª∂ÂΩ¨), along with a couple brothers, was made a palace guard (ÊÆøÁõ¥) after his father's death in 986. Since he was the only son whose appointment was delayed, historians believe he was less than 15 years old that year. Nothing is known about him otherwise. The name Yang Yansi probably came from general Yang Si (Ê•äÂó£), a military general who fought the Liao Dynasty alongside Yang Ye's most distinguished son Yang Yanzhao for much of Emperor Zhenzong of Song's reign. Despite sharing the surname, he came from a different hometown than Yang Yanzhao, but some commoners probably thought they were brothers, explaining the mix-up. Yang Qilang's tomb was built in 1755 in today's Dai County, Shanxi along with the Yang family ancestral hall, and the name on the headstone is Yang Yanxing (Ê•äÂª∂Ëàà).

The largest outcrop of the complex is on the Rhinns of Islay, from where the complex gets its name. It has also been recognised in three other inliers extending to the southwest as far as Inishtrahull, off the north coast of Donegal. Distribution The Rhinns complex has been recognised in a series of four outcrops that form inliers within younger cover sequences of the Dalradian Supergroup and the Colonsay Group. The most easterly of these exposures is on the islands of Colonsay, where the complex consists of strongly retrogressed orthogneisses, although the correlation of this outcrop with the Rhinns complex has been questioned on the basis of new radiometric dating and Hf isotope analyses. On the Rhinns of Islay, gneisses of the Rhinns complex lie unconformably beneath the Colonsay Group, which is correlated with the Dalradian Supergroup. The gneisses on Islay consist of two main types, a dominant medium to coarse-grained syenitic gneiss, which is cut by large intrusions of gabbro (now deformed). Between Islay and Inishtrahull, a third submarine outcrop has been recognised from dredged seabed samples and geophysical data. The final outcrop is on the island of Inishtrahull, which has similar lithologies to that on the Rhinns of Islay. Formation The Rhinns complex consists of a set of Palaeoproterozoic igneous rocks that were intruded about 1.78 Ga (billions of years ago). They had been metamorphosed by 1.71 Ga. The overall chemistry of the rocks is consistent with magmatism associated with an Andean type subduction complex.

Quirk involved himself in local politics at the time and identified himself with the Free Trade Party, not uncommon for members of the Sydney business community at the time. When Henry Parkes won the NSW Legislative Assembly seat of St Leonards in 1885, Quirk worked in his office. Political career Holding prominent positions as secretary of the Manly Fire Brigade and president of Manly District Ambulance Brigade, Quirk eventually stood for office as became an Alderman on Manly Municipal Council in 1896 and rose to become Mayor from 1901 to 1906. He would remain a Manly Alderman until his retirement in 1928. Quirk then stood for state office in 1901 when the local member for Warringah, Dugald Thomson, resigned so that he could stand for the seat of North Sydney in the new Federal Parliament. Elected as an Independent, Quirk was aligned with the government of the day led by Sir John See and Thomas Waddell. He served on a parliamentary committee that resulted in an act that allowed the extension of a railway to the Portland Cement Works. He held his seat in parliament until it was abolished as a part of the reduction in size of the Legislative Assembly following federation, and contested the new seat of Middle Harbour (which absorbed the majority of Warringah) at the 1904 election. Quirk stood as an Independent Progressive but nevertheless lost the election to Dr. Richard Arthur 58-40%. Quirk then stood for election to the first council of the newly proclaimed Warringah Shire Council on 3 December 1906. Subsequently elected as an Alderman, he rose to be Shire President on three consecutive occasions in 1910, 1913‚Äì1914 and 1918‚Äì1919. He served on the Council until 1922. Joining the Labor Party, Quirk attempted to re-enter state politics as the ALP candidate for Middle Harbour in the 1913 state election, but was again unsuccessful against Dr Arthur. The Sydney Morning Herald in particular noted with interest his change of party allegiance since leaving parliament: \\"Mr. Quirk's debut as a pledged [Labor] caucus candidate is, of course, something new for the electors to meditate upon. Whilst he was always considered a supporter of the Labour party, this is the first occasion on which he has accepted the conditions attached to the signing of the Labour caucus pledge.\\" In 1918, Quirk was one of seven Manly aldermen who were charged and found guilty for accepting free ferry passes from the Port Jackson and Manly Steamship Company. The magistrate convicted the seven aldermen of contravening the Local Government Act and disqualified them to act as aldermen. As the council only had a total of nine aldermen, there was a period when the council did not have quorum and therefore did not function. These convictions were overturned on appeal. Eventually retiring from public life in 1928, Quirk died in November 1938 and was buried in Manly cemetery. Quirk Road in Manly Vale in the former Manly Council area and Quirk Street in Dee Why in the former Warringah Council area are named after him.

Erickson (born 1969) is an American ecological economist, professor of sustainability science and Policy at the Rubenstein School of Environment and Natural Resources of the University of Vermont in Burlington, Vermont, USA, and fellow of the Gund Institute for Environment.  Career  Before joining the University of Vermont in 2002 he was assistant professor in the Department of Economics at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute in Troy, New York, USA. He completed his Ph.D. in Natural Resource Economics at Cornell University in 1997. His research contributes to ecological economic theory and applied work on human health, sustainable development, land and biodiversity conservation, watershed planning, forest management, climate change economics, and renewable energy. This work has been published in 4 books, over 60 peer-reviewed journal articles and book chapters, and over 100 conference papers, research reports, and press articles. He is also Adjunct Professor at the University of Iceland, was a Fulbright Scholar at the Sokoine University of Agriculture in Tanzania, and has been a visiting professor at the Pontificia Universidad Cat√≥lica Madre y Maestra in the Dominican Republic and the University of Agriculture in Nitra, Slovakia. He is past president of the U.S. Society for Ecological Economics and the Adirondack Research Consortium; past editor of the Adirondack Journal of Environmental Studies; has served on boards of the International Society for Ecological Economics and Conservation and Research Foundation; was a member of the Technical Advisory Committee of the Lake Champlain Basin Program and the Vermont Governor's Council on Energy and the Environment. Erickson is also a social entrepreneur, starting and incorporating a number of non-governmental organizations and working intently at the science to policy interface. He co-founded Bright Blue EcoMedia with documentary film producer Victor Guadagno and author Amy Siedl, the non-profit media company that produced the two-time New England Emmy-award-winning Bloom film series. Bloom is a four-part PBS series on the causes and solutions to water pollution and eutrophication in America's rivers and lakes, narrated by Academy award-winning actor Chris Cooper, and including interviews with environmental scholars Bill McKibben, Maude Barlow and John Todd. His latest film collaboration was writing and directing Waking the Sleeping Giant with Jacob Smith, an award-winning, feature-length documentary on the 2016 presidential campaign of Senator Bernie Sanders. He also co-founded the HIV/AIDS prevention education program Futbol para la Vida with Yanlico Munesi Dusdal in the Dominican Republic (DR), modeled after the international Grassroot Soccer program and now with programs for at-risk youth throughout the DR and Haiti managed by the Dominican DREAM Project. In Vermont policy development, his collaboration on the first state-level Genuine Progress Indicator led to a 2012 law to initiate the use of GPI in state policy and budget analysis, and his crowd-sourced media project with Bright Blue led to the Vermont legislature's declaration of March 21, 2012 as Vermont Energy Independence Day.

With a bronze statue and stone pedestal dedicated, the Watson Monument was located first at the square in Mount Royal Avenue and West Lanvale Street (across from the future site of the Maryland Institute College of Art's new Main Building of three years later [1906]). Col. Watson's statue was moved later in the early 1930s in anticipation for possible extension of North Howard Street several blocks further north to Mount Royal Terrace at the West North Avenue entrance driveway to Druid Hill Park, unfortunately now adjacent to an entrance ramp for the Jones Falls Expressway, (Interstate 83), built in the early 1960s. * 1904 ‚Äì Great Fire erupts early Sunday, February 7 to Monday, February 8, burning most of the downtown business district from South Howard Street in the west to Jones Falls in the east, continuing north to Fayette Street and Battle Monument Square in the north and to the waterfront piers along East Pratt Street facing \\"The Basin\\" (Inner Harbor) in the south. Third worst conflagration to hit an American city in history after the Great Chicago Fire of 1871 and the 1906 1906 San Francisco earthquake and fire, followed by other weather disasters of Galveston Hurricane of 1900 and Hurricane Katrina at New Orleans in 2005. Additional help sent in from Baltimore County and nearby towns along with by railroad from nearby cities of Washington, Philadelphia and at the last New York City. Recent \\"fire-proof\\" modern skyscrapers built in the last decade had interiors \\"burn like a torch\\", but most were able to be rebuilt on steel frameworks and masonry exteriors. Streets widened and some reconfigured along with new underground utilities with added electrical conduits eliminating overhead lines on poles under authority of a newly appointed \\"Burnt District Commission\\". Generally only half of the number of previous downtown structures rebuilt with newer buildings taller and larger, along with new modern steel municipal piers, (numbers 1 to 6), constructed along Pratt Street waterfront. Maryland National Guard soldiers stationed downtown for next several weeks. Because of week-end, records/books for years afterwards recorded no lives lost although recent research in a local newspaper that had been overlooked, uncovered that an unidentified black man's body was found in the Jones Falls a week later. XXX buildings destroyed with XX millions of dollars lost and only XX covered by insurance. Reconstruction continues for next several years. * 1906 ‚Äì Maryland Institute, after having its longtime landmark 1851 building built over the old Centre Market (\\"Marsh Market\\") burned in the Great 1904 Fire, relocates most of its academic activities to a new \\"Main Building\\" in the northwest of the mid-town Mount Vernon-Belvedere-Mount Royal neighborhood at Mount Royal Avenue and West Lanvale Street, south of landmark Corpus Christi Roman Catholic Church on property donated by parishioner Michael Jenkins (of family of banking/railroad magnate Thomas Courtney Jenkins). Lt. Col. William F. Watson statue ‚Äì Mexican War Memorial dedicated earlier in 1903 is located in the square across the street (moved later in the early 1930s, several blocks north to Mount Royal Terrace at West North Avenue entrance to Druid Hill Park). City of Baltimore later donates two floors above the northern structure of the three new parallel market buildings constructed on the east side facing Jones Falls at the old Market Place (Harrison Street) site for continuing its mechanical, drawing and technical courses, supervised by the new Centre Market Commission, headed by Gen. Felix Agnus, publisher of the longtime largest daily newspaper Baltimore American. New Centre Market buildings of 1906 with wholesale fish, produce and dry goods distributed below on ground levels and classrooms / offices, halls and academic areas on upper floors. Two of the three buildings (northern and southern) later razed in early 1980s for expressway extension for southern terminus of Jones Falls Expressway, (Interstate 83) and construction of underground (\\"Metro\\") subway system. Classes and studios of the Maryland Institute College of Art (MICA) consolidated further northwest to an extensive multi-building campus adjoining original 1906 \\"Main Building\\" along Mount Royal Avenue during the 1980s to 2010s. Fish Market (central market building in the middle) on Market Place is later renovated with \\"Port Discovery\\" children's museum and adjacent parking garage. ** Homewood Field laid out and constructed for athletic contests at northern end of new north city campus for The Johns Hopkins University (JHU) at southwest corner of University Parkway and North Charles Street. JHU is moving from its older downtown campus since opening in 1876 along North Howard Street, between West Centre, Little Ross and West Monument Streets, in southwest area of Mount Vernon-Belvedere mid-town neighborhood. First academic buildings constructed were Gilman Hall and Shriver Hall, occupied in 1914‚Äì1915, with distinctive Georgian‚ÄìFederal style architecture of red brick and white colonial wood trim with cupolas and steeples on a park-like campus on donated former William Wyman estate of Wyman Villa and adjacent Homewood House. Situated between North Charles Street and newly laid out and renamed University Parkway (former Merryman's Lane), northwest of 1870s era north city neighborhood of Peabody Heights (later renamed Charles Village in 1967) and near Stony Run stream and east of new Wyman Park. Besides staging future \\"Blue Jays\\" collegiate athletic contests here, some public and private high school games are played here such as between City College and Polytechnic Institute for their long-time football rivalry since 1889, which began a few years earlier at Clifton Park, also sports contests Calvert Hall College versus Loyola High School by the 1920s, and others in the local public-private schools athletic league Maryland Scholastic Association since 1919. * 1907 ‚Äì ** City Department of Legislative Reference established, with offices and reference library/files in Baltimore City Hall. ** Reconstruction continues of \\"Centre Market\\" area on Market Place (former old Harrison Street and colonial site of \\"Harrison's Marsh\\") in east downtown after devastation from Great Fire with three adjacent (east-west axis) wholesale market buildings for produce, fish, dry-goods and some retail with space for Maryland Institute's College of Art and Design on upper two floors of northern building under leadership of new Centre Market Commission, headed by chairman, Gen. Felix Agnus, owner/publisher of the Baltimore American evening daily newspaper with marble horse-drinking fountain in middle of square donated by animal-lover, Gen. A. E. Booth. Razing of several buildings and further re-development later in the mid-1980s by \\"Six Flags Over America\\" as entertainment/restaurant/taverns complex named \\"The Brokerage\\" at northern end of plaza, and then again in the mid-1990s by the David Cordish Company renamed as \\"Power Plant Live!\\" (for old streetcar electrical generating plant of 1900‚Äì1903 one block south on Pratt Street). ** Cornerstone laid for new Central Building of Young Men's Christian Association (YMCA) at northeast corner of East Franklin and Cathedral Streets in Mount Vernon- Belvedere neighborhood and \\"Cathedral Hill\\" (founded in Baltimore in 1852 and previously located in triangular Victorian styled structure at northwest corner of West Saratoga and North Charles Street, built 1872‚Äì1873). New YMCA at former site of George Hoffman's Greek Revival mansion built in the 1820s (one of first constructed on the estate of Col. John Eager Howard, \\"Belvidere\\" or \\"Howard's Woods\\", with later development by his sons and heirs. The mansion itself survives until the 1870s at the present intersection of North Calvert and East Chase Streets) and later used from 1857 to 1894 for the Southern- sympathizing Maryland Club for male elites (which was threatened by Union Army-occupying Gen. Benjamin F. Butler to shoot any visible Rebel flags off the roof from the newly fortified Fort Federal Hill in May 1861). Across street to the west was the Franklin Street Presbyterian Church and north of old Baltimore Cathedral designed by Benjamin Henry Latrobe. Also cross-corner from future expansion site in 1931‚Äì1933 of central/main branch of the Enoch Pratt Free Library on Cathedral Street from first Central Library building of 1882‚Äì1886, further south on corner with West Mulberry Street. Opening in 1909, new Central YMCA functions with many social and athletic activities for nearly 70 years with its indoor pool, gymnasium, athletic rooms, dormitories, kitchen/cafeterias, and classrooms. Later a separate \\"Colored YMCA\\" opens in northwestern inner city area of Upton on Druid Hill Avenue. One block west on Franklin Street at Park Avenue was also central headquarters of companion agency Young Women's Christian Association, (YWCA). Later in 1984, YMCA of Central Maryland reorganized facilities and closed the Central Headquarters which were later converted into the Mount Vernon Hotel and Caf√©. ** New building completed for the all-girls, academic-business oriented Eastern High School at the southeast corner of Broadway and East North Avenue in the northeast corner of the city. Unfortunately, one of the last major high schools built right up to the street and sidewalk with no adjoining campus for other activities. Later Eastern moves to another new building in 1938 at 33rd Street boulevard and Loch Raven Boulevard in the former Venable Park (which stirs up political controversy by citizens and nearby residents). Saving municipal budget monies during the Great Depression, new E.H.S. matched the architecture and construction diagrams of the sister school Western High at Gwynns Falls Parkway off Reisterstown Road/Park Heights Avenue from 1927 in northwest Baltimore. ** New headquarters building of Classical/Beaux Arts architecture built on the southwest corner of South Charles and East Baltimore Streets, an intersection which becomes known for the next half-century as \\"Sun Square\\", and the central geographic point of the city, for the rebuilt offices and printing plant completed this year after the Great Baltimore Fire of February 1904, devastated the previous \\"Sun Iron Building\\" of 1851 (at East Baltimore and South Streets) for the twice-daily newspaper The Sun and The Evening Sun (also known colloquially as The Sunpapers). Sun's building lasts until the mid-1960s and replaced in the \\"Charles Center\\" downtown redevelopment project of 1958‚Äì1970 by the also later landmark Morris A. Mechanic Theatre of poured-concrete Brutalist Modernist style adjoining new Hopkins Plaza in middle of block. ** Across the street on the southeast corner of East Baltimore and South Charles is the new Greco‚ÄìRoman styled \\"Temple of Thrift\\" of white marble with massive columns, steps and porticoes is built for the old Savings Bank of Baltimore (SSB), founded 1818, with a different structure and mission compared to the city's other large financial institutions. The SSB is oriented towards small customers of savers and depositers. The Bank lasts until the 1990s bank merger and out-of-town take- over mania, building a newer skyscraper two blocks further east at North Calvert and East Baltimore Streets' iconic northwest corner, renames itself, dropping the term \\"Savings\\" and is shortly taken over by \\"SunTrust\\". Its old landmark offices become central to a charity organization. * 1908 ‚Äì Washington, Baltimore and Annapolis Electric Railway (\\"inter-urban\\" electric rail cars) begins operating on a triangular route through Anne Arundel County from the state capital to \\"The Monumental City\\" and then to Washington, D.C.. Line opens February 7, 1908 from its Baltimore station on Liberty Street (between West Lexington and West Fayette Streets) to Washington's 15th and 'H' Streets, N.E. and then to Annapolis. In 1921, City terminal is relocated to southwest corner of South Howard and West Lombard Streets (later site of today's Holiday Inn hotel). Sold at auction in 1935, later owners form Baltimore and Annapolis Railroad Company operating commuter diesel buses up to the early 1970s from the state capital to Brooklyn in South Baltimore. * 1909 ‚Äì **Art Gallery building constructed by financier and philanthropist Henry Walters (1848‚Äì1931), built and opened at northwest corner of North Charles and East Centre Streets, facing the south square of Washington Place, to house and exhibit his personal extensive collection of art amassed by him over decades along with previous acquisitions of his father, William Thompson Walters (1820‚Äì1894). Structure built across the back alley from their brownstone mansion facing north towards West Mount Vernon Place in the Mount Vernon- Belvedere neighborhood, and facing the Washington Monument to the north and east. Occasionally for the next two decades, the gallery since its original 1909 construction is opened for viewing by the Baltimore public. After Walters' 1931 death, the Gallery with its collection of paintings, statuary, tapestries, jewels, and thousands of items, one of America's greatest collections, is willed to the City of Baltimore and a museum established, along with the neighboring family mansion and an endowment. An additional modernistic annex is constructed to the west along West Centre Street to Park Avenue at rear in 1974, and later addition of the former Thomas-Jencks- Gladding Mansion to the north, facing the Monument at its southwest corner, to house Asian art in 1982, with the new name of \\"Hackerman House\\", named for donor Willard Hackerman. ** The Telegraf is founded as a newspaper for the Czech community of Baltimore. * 1910 ‚Äì Population: 558,485. * 1911 ‚Äì Pennsylvania Station (Baltimore) (first known as \\"Union Station\\" until 1928) constructed of elaborate imposing Beaux Arts/Classical style architecture with beautiful marble interior atrium surmounted by a stained glass skylight and rookwood green wall tiles built for the use of several passenger rail lines including the Pennsylvania Railroad, the Western Maryland Railway and later the B. & O. (besides their nearby Mount Royal Station, a few blocks southwest). Replaced earlier Victorian styled Union Station from 1873, second terminal rebuilt 1881, on same site also used by the several railroads after the construction then of the connecting underground Baltimore and Potomac Railroad tunnels under, through and around northern, northwestern and northeastern Baltimore City (known as the \\"Belt Line\\"), so as not to have steam, smoke-blowing locomotives pulling through downtown streets (later shortly replaced by electric then diesel locomotives) or the system since the 1830s of horse-drawn railcars between stations. Connected with the B. & O.'s Howard Street Tunnel of 1890‚Äì1895, going north and south under downtown. Sited between North Charles Street and Calvert Street, north of Mount Royal Avenue and the community of Mount Vernon-Belvedere-Mount Royal, along curving bend of north bank of the Jones Falls. Later used also by other regional and national passenger rail lines until major bankruptcies with reorganization of national railroads in 1970 with Amtrak passenger system. Cleaned, refurbished and restored in the early 1980s. Neighborhood north of the station along North Avenue, which had been generally known as \\"Mid-Town\\", given neighborhood name of \\"Penn-North-Charles\\", and later renamed in the 2010s as \\"Station North\\" with creation of supporting \\"community benefits district\\" zone organization. ** Two office building tower skyscrapers with distinctive clocks are simultaneously constructed and finished this year on the east and west sides of Downtown Baltimore. The Tower Building for the Maryland Casualty Company on East Baltimore Street and Guilford Avenue in the east and the Bromo Seltzer Tower for the Emerson Drug Company on the west side at the northeast corner of West Lombard and South Paca Streets. Emerson's building is surmounted by a huge electric bulb lighted revolving blue steel replica of the headache remedy bottle revolving on top, at the inspiration of magnate Capt. Isaac Edward Emerson which when lighted up was visible for miles down the Chesapeake Bay. The famous \\"Blue Bottle\\" endures until 1936 when it unfortunately was cut up and removed because of structural instability in the building. * 1912 ‚Äì ** Arch Social Club and Urban League branch established. ** 1912 Democratic National Convention meets in Baltimore for first national political party convention since 1860 at new Fifth Regiment Armory on North Howard Street (along future renamed \\"29th Division Street\\" for famous \\"Blue-Gray Division\\" of Maryland/Virginia soldiers, that attacked Omaha Beach on D-Day, June 6, 1944). Democrats nominates Woodrow Wilson (1856‚Äì1924), incumbent Governor of New Jersey, (and also former President of Princeton University and graduate of Baltimore's Johns Hopkins University) for President, running against incumbent Republican 27th President William Howard Taft (1857‚Äì1930), and former Republican 26th President Theodore Roosevelt (1858‚Äì1919), running on a third- party ticket of the newly organized Progressive Party platform. Wilson is joined by his Vice Presidential nominee Thomas R. Marshall (1854‚Äì1925), of Indiana and was elected as 28th President, (serving 1913‚Äì1921), over Taft and Roosevelt. ** Construction begins on additional buildings of (\\"Aldersaal\\" [parish house/social hall], bell tower, parsonage, and enclosed gardens) at Old Zion Lutheran Church, downtown across from City Hall along East Lexington Street west from North Gay Street (facing later 1920s War Memorial Building and City Hall Plaza to commemorate all war dead). ** City's public math- science and technical school, Baltimore Polytechnic Institute relocates from old building on east side of Courtland Street near East Saratoga Street (future redeveloped St. Paul Place/Street and \\"Preston Gardens\\" constructed in 1920s ‚Äì older building later used by new Baltimore City Department of Public Welfare and razed by 1963 for westward expansion for Mercy Hospital from Calvert Street) to the former campus and mansion from 1866 of the Maryland School for the Blind at East North Avenue and North Calvert Street. \\"Old Poly\\" has two additional wings are added to the east and west in the Beaux Arts/Classical style of architecture. Additional central wing replaces old M.S.B. mansion by 1931 with additional auditorium/gymnasium wing further east. Blind School relocates 1911‚Äì1913 to park-like campus in Overlea section of northeast Baltimore County. Polytechnic resides here for five and a half decades before joining all-girls Western High School in joint campus in north Baltimore at West Cold Spring Lane and Falls Road in 1967. Renamed later as Calvert Educational Center, structure hold variety of educational uses until major gutting, renovation and remodeling as central headquarters for the Baltimore City Public Schools in the 1980s, as \\"Alice G. Pinderhughes Administrative Building\\" for former superintendent, replacing previous 1930s-era offices at 25th Street, between Charles and St. Paul Streets. * 1913 ‚Äì ** New routing and construction of the Francis Scott Key Highway (known as \\"Key Highway\\" for short) from Light Street at \\"The Basin\\" (today's Inner Harbor) to the east along north and east sides of Federal Hill and continued along northern shore of Whetstone Point peninsula on south bank of Northwest Branch of Patapsco River to Baltimore Harbor. The highway with narrow median strip constructed of concrete surface with occasional older cobblestone sections with railroad tracks imbedded for pier access, continues southeast towards Locust Point port terminals and adjacent residential community and passes under overhead bridge for Fort Avenue, curves back to the west and extends west to South Hanover Street, completely surrounding the old South Baltimore rowhouse residential communities. Serving as a by-pass for industrial and port facilities truck traffic in the future automotive age along with directing anticipated historical tourism traffic towards historic Fort McHenry at end of peninsula, recently leased to the City from the U.S. War Department of the now decommissioned antique and obsolete military reservation, which establishes a city park in the following year, as part of the National Star Spangled Banner Centennial Celebration. ** Major public works construction project of building new \\"Fallsway\\" highway over former stream of Jones Falls which is directed beneath in two concrete conduit tunnels from Mount Royal Avenue and Pennsylvania Station to the north flowing south to Fayette Street where once again flows between two stone canal walls further south to Patapsco River Northwest Branch. * 1914 ‚Äì ** Baltimore Museum of Art founded and opens at old mansion of Mary Elizabeth Garrett (1854‚Äì1915), only daughter of B. & O. Railroad Civil War-era president, John Work Garrett (1820‚Äì1884), (later replaced by apartment house, which later becomes Peabody Court Hotel ‚Äì operated by Wyndom hotel chain) at southwest corner of Cathedral and West Monument Streets, facing West Mount Vernon Place (where her parents' brownstone mansion, the Garrett-Jacobs Mansion also faces) and the Washington Monument further east. B.M.A. later moves to Art Museum Drive off North Charles Street, near Wyman Park, south of the new Homewood campus of The Johns Hopkins University in simplified Greek‚ÄìRoman Revival/Classical-style structure by famous American architect John Russell Pope (1874‚Äì1937). ** Hippodrome Theatre built on Eutaw Street between West Fayette and Redwood Streets and shows early silent movies and burlesque live shows, later after 1927 with \\"talkies\\" sound movies. Closed, run-down and abandoned after the 1970s with several other major downtown movie palaces. Restored, renovated and re-opened in the 2010s as new performing arts center replacing earlier Morris A. Mechanic Theatre (at southwest corner of South Charles Street and West Baltimore Street, part of Charles Center downtown re-development project of the 1950s and 60s), with live theatre and Broadway theatre shows. Theatre renovation combined with two neighboring bank buildings completing larger new theatre complex on entire block. ** Baltimore Orioles recruit schoolboy prodigy George Herman Ruth (\\"Babe\\") from St. Mary's Industrial School on Wilkens and Caton Avenues in southwest (now site since 1966 of Cardinal Gibbons High School) and trains him to hit and pitch for the International League Birds. Later owner/manager Jack Dunn, Sr. (1872‚Äì1928), under financial pressure from the competition of the new \\"third league\\" with the Federal League, with its Baltimore Terrapins, playing across the street in their new steel-beamed modern stadium of Terrapin Park on the northwest corner of Greenmount Avenue and 29th Street in the northeast city neighborhood of Waverly just across from the old wooden American League Park/Oriole Park of 1901 on the southwest corner. Dunn is forced to sell his best product ‚Äì \\"Dunn's Babe\\" to the Boston Red Sox at their new Fenway Park in the American League. Five years later, after using him mostly as a pitcher, they in turn trade him to the newly renamed team of the New York Yankees (since 1913, formerly the \\"New York Highlanders\\") which had (before 1903) been the old Baltimore Orioles charter franchise when the American League began in 1901. The Yankees at that time had not established a very successful record until the arrival of young \\"Babe Ruth\\" from Baltimore. ** \\"Star Spangled Banner Centennial Celebration\\" observed in Baltimore for the 100th Anniversary of the War of 1812 (1812‚Äì1815), campaign with the Battle of Baltimore and Battle of North Point during September 12‚Äì14, 1914. Parades, decorated buildings, dedications of new commemorative monuments and statues, along with publication of commemorative book. Fort McHenry on Whetstone Point, adjacent to the nearby rowhouse neighborhood of Locust Point turned over to be leased by the City of Baltimore's newly organized Department of Recreation and Parks for use as a public park by the U.S. War Department. Later taken back by the Federal Government in three years with the advent of U.S. entry into World War I in April 1917, for immediate and emergency use as United States Army General Hospital Number Two when a large complex of temporary wooden structures/barracks, concrete/brick medical and surgical facilities and additional army post buildings are erected surrounding the historic \\"star fort\\" and used until war ends in 1919, then later returned to the City again as a park when post-war medical operations conclude and hospital buildings and driveways are razed by 1923. Later becomes national monument in 1925, with dedication of \\"Orpheus\\" musical and poetic Greek god monument by 28th President Warren G. Harding, with additional status as national shrine in 1939, administered by new National Park Service established 1916 in the U.S. Department of the Interior. * 1915 ‚Äì Municipal anthem, \\"Baltimore, Our Baltimore\\", written by poet Folger McKinsey, columnist for \\"The Sun\\", known as the \\"Bentztown Bard\\" from Frederick, Maryland, with music by Mrs. Emma Hemberger, (wife of Theodor)a foremost musical composer in the city, having won first place in a contest during the year 1915, with entries to be presented by December 1, sponsored by Mayor James H. Preston with a prize of $250 in gold, one for the best original poem and another for the best musical setting. Judges for the contest were Harold Randolph ‚Äì Director of the Peabody Institute-Conservatory of Music, Henrietta Baker Low ‚Äì former Supervisor of Music for the Baltimore City Public Schools, and John Itzel ‚Äì composer and orchestra conductor. During a concert of various musical pieces, both instrumental and vocal presented, the winning song of four verses was later announced and performed for the first time with a small group of orchestral pieces, a concert choir \\"The United Singers\\" assisted by 300 local high school girls at the Lyric Opera House on Mount Royal Avenue, at Cathedral Street, before an audience of notables, \\"Washington's Birthday\\", February 22, 1916. Required for a long time afterwards to be taught in all city schools and to be at least familiar to conductors and leaders of any city musical groups, orchestras or bands and sung at any ceremony, dedication, parades or official program, on city, state and national holidays events, including regular concerts by the Municipal Park Band with its summertime extravaganzas and other events sponsored by the City Department of Recreation and Parks (which included a Bureau of Music ‚Äì unusual for most major U.S. cities). It however, suffered later periods of neglect. By the 1960s, longtime city comptroller and gadfly Hyman A. Pressman and former Mayor and Governor of Maryland, William Donald Schaefer, called for it frequently, leading to a renaissance of familiarity in later decades. Occasionally it joined the singing of the state's controversial but interesting anthem, \\"Maryland, My Maryland\\", by James Ryder Randall, from a tumultuous Civil War era in 1861. ** Maryland State Normal School, founded 1866, first located briefly at Red Man's Hall on North Paca Street, then former William Howard Greek Revival mansion, (later by 1863 becomes Union/Athenaeum Club) at northeast corner of North Charles and East Franklin Streets. Teachers' school then relocated by the 1870s to West Baltimore at Lafayette Square, at Layfayette and Carollton Avenues in large structure built for it. Moves to new extensive park-like campus in county seat of suburban Baltimore County, south of Towson on west side of York Road (Maryland Route 45). General Assembly of Maryland passes a $600,000 bond issue in April 1912, making the teachers' school the largest building initiative up to that time in the state. Administration Building first constructed (later renamed Stephens Hall), along with Newell Hall student dormitory, and two subsequent halls in red brick English Tudor / Jacobethan style architecture and nearby power plant. Neighboring mansion \\"Glen Esk\\" used for president's residence. New campus opens after two-year construction in September 1915. Additional similarly styled structures facing east towards York Road built with Richardson Hall and a few others, for a temporarily unified appearance. Additional teachers colleges opened later in other sections of Maryland. In later years, \\"normal,\\" school is renamed several times, as Maryland State Teachers College at Towson in 1935, then Towson State College by 1963, later elevated to Towson State University and finally Towson University. Second largest college/university in the state by the 2010s. * 1916 ** Baltimore Symphony Orchestra formed. Performs first at Lyric Opera House and Theatre on Mount Royal Avenue at Cathedral Street with its auditorium of great acoustics, built on Mount Royal Avenue at Cathedral Street in 1894. ** Baltimore Black Sox baseball team formed and plays in the Negro Leagues, in addition to the local white minor league baseball team, Baltimore Orioles of the International League. Others later are the Baltimore Elite Giants TO 1950, playing at old Westport Stadium in southwest section of city. * 1917 ** Fort Holabird (initially named Camp Holabird) established along southeast city waterfront for World War I effort, joined by Camp Meade further south near Annapolis Junction in Anne Arundel County. Famous military \\"general purpose\\" vehicle (nicknamed later as the \\"jeep\\"), tested on dirt tracks during 1941‚Äì1942 at Holabird. Meade later becomes center of post-war electronic intelligence gathering in the National Security Agency, headquartered here. ** Lithuanian Hall opens in East Baltimore. ** Holliday Street Theatre first built in 1794 of lumber, then reconstructed 1812 in Greek Revival architecture of stone and brick; re-built 1873‚Äì1874 after fire, then torn down with entire block between Holliday, East Fayette, North Gay and East Lexington Streets across from Baltimore City Hall (of 1867‚Äì1875) to begin preparations for construction of City Hall Plaza and War Memorial Plaza and later War Memorial Building in the mid-1920s at the east end along North Gay Street. ** Hanover Street Bridge designed and supervised construction by noted city/state bridge engineer John E. Greiner (later led construction and bridge firm) completed in January with passage of special electric streetcar \\"Maryland\\" from United Railways after three-year project across the Middle Branch/Ferry Branch of the Patapsco River and Baltimore Harbor. Connecting old South Baltimore/Whetstone Point peninsula from Ferry Bar/Point across to northern Anne Arundel County at Brooklyn with causeway for extended South Hanover Street (and later parallel Potee Street) on an earthen berm around the western shore of the branch and also across Western Branch flowing east from Elkridge/Ellicott City of the upper Patapsco. New concrete-arched bridge replaced old Light Street Bridge, long wooden trestle built 1856, (also known as \\"Long Bridge\\" or \\"Brooklyn Bridge\\") to Brooklyn and further to industrial area of Curtis Bay across the river. Bridge connects further south to Baltimore-Annapolis Road (later Gov. Ritchie Highway after 1936). Modern connection highlights benefits of future city annexation of southern suburban areas in Anne Arundel two years later. ** Early organization during World War I-era of musical opera lovers formed and named Baltimore Opera Society by conductor David S. Melamet with Barron Berthald of New York as stage manager. An outgrowth of his Melamet Opera Class. Continued on through the 1920s putting on productions at the Lyric Opera House (1894) on Mount Royal Avenue with casts composed of Baltimoreans with an occasional New York guest from the \\"Met\\". After his death, the local company was continued by Eugene Martinet (founder of Martinet School of Opera in 1927) who reorganized, directed and conducted. Later succeeded by several other companies and then in 1950 with the Baltimore Civic Opera Company, organized and inspired by local famous opera singer Rosa Ponselle who later retired in northern Baltimore County. * 1918 ** 1918 influenza epidemic. (includes timeline) ** Last casualty of World War I on the Western Front in northwestern France is a Baltimorean, Private Henry Gunther of the 313th Regiment, \\"Baltimore's Own\\" at Ville-devant-Chaumont, area of Lorraine on \\"Armistice\\" at the \\"eleventh hour, of eleventh day and eleventh month\\". His unit had only been in combat for two months and had just been told of the end of the war just fifteen minutes earlier because of a foul-up with the couriers. Pvt. Gunther was shot by burst of machine gun fire from Germans' 31st Prussian Army, when he ran at their lines, one minute before the 11 am. Cease-Fire, November 11, 1918. Was a former supply sergeant who had recently been demoted for violating mail censorship rules by writing in a letter home that conditions on the line were intolerable and suggested he not enlist. Was depressed and seemed to try to want to redeem himself. Gunther was from recent German immigrants in East Baltimore's Highlandtown, not wanting to attack former countrymen of his, a former bank teller and clerk at the National Bank of Baltimore with a fianc√© and had been drafted in September 1917, not volunteering immediately when war was declared in April 1917. Later U.S. Army restored his sergeant's rank and awarded him the \\"Distinguished Service Cross\\" and a unit citation. Later a local Post #1858 of the Veterans of Foreign Wars was named for him, the last American killed in \\"the war to end all wars\\". * 1919 ** William F. Broening (1870‚Äì1953), a Republican, elected mayor and serves to 1923. Unusual interlude of city political power for the Republican Party in the predominantly Democratic-voting city. After his mayoralty, Broening Highway, is named for him where later a large General Motors auto/truck assembly plant is constructed facing the highway in southeast Baltimore and a small waterfront Broening Park named for him and established southeast of the now landmark concrete-arched Hanover Street Bridge of 1914‚Äì1917 (later renamed Vietnam Veterans Memorial Bridge in the 1990s) across the Middle and Ferry Branches of the main Patapsco River and Baltimore Harbor. Parallel causeways carrying South Hanover and Potee Streets (and Maryland Route 2) lead south to Brooklyn and Curtis Bay industrial and residential communities. Baltimore and Maryland Yacht Clubs and several sculling/rowing teams build their clubhouses here along southwestern shores and hold river races. Later parkland expanded along Western (or Ferry Branch) leading from upper Patapsco with narrowing width with filling-in nearby marshes for Cherry Hill/Reedbird Park, south of the Cherry Hill neighborhood into larger shoreline \\"Middle Branch Park\\" beginning in the 1980s. ** Druid Hill Avenue YMCA opens. ** Organization of the Maryland Scholastic Association for high school student athletic competition between Baltimore City public high schools and metropolitan area private and religious (generally Roman Catholic) secondary schools with 13 charter member schools, which initially met in the old \\"Barn\\" structure at The Johns Hopkins University's new \\"Homewood\\" campus (on North Charles Street, between later Art Museum Drive and University Parkway, east of Wyman Park Dell). In attendance at the league's formation are: Baltimore City College, Baltimore Polytechnic Institute, (both municipal high schools), Boys' Latin School of Maryland, Calvert Hall College, (high school), Donaldson School (since extinct), Friends School of Baltimore, The Gilman School of Maryland, Loyola High School, Marston School (since extinct), McDonogh School, Mount St. Joseph College (high school), Park School of Baltimore, and the Severn School in Anne Arundel County. Called together by inspiration of Dr. Phillip H. Edwards, athletic coach and later noted principal of Baltimore City College (B.C.C.), who had earlier organized a student athletic council for scheduling and officiating, along with Russell Murphy, later of Johns Hopkins University's (JHU) Athletic Department-football program with the \\"Blue Jays\\". Dr. J.M.T. Finney elected first President of the new M.S.A. and followed by Prof. Murphy of JHU in 1921. Other long-time leaders are Adelay G. Hausmann of Gilman, Otto K. Schmied of BCC, and Herb Armstrong (BCC), Charles Gamper of Edmondson High School, and later William (\\"Sugar\\") Cain of Dunbar (after MSA racially integrates). MSA is one of the first statewide high school athletic associations to voluntarily racially integrate in March 1956, adding Paul Laurence Dunbar Community High School (established as a new junior high school in the 1920s), Carver Vocational-Technical High School, and later Frederick Douglass High School (founded 1883 as the \\"Colored High School and Training School\\"). By the 1970s, MSA (which its winning teams in central Maryland generally meant a \\"state championship\\") membership had considerably expanded to include additional outlying city public and suburban private schools. In 1993, Dr. Walter Amprey, new superintendent of Baltimore City Public Schools (who had graduated and begun his teaching career in the City but later moved to the surrounding county to become a principal, then administrator and asst. superintendent), forced the City's high schools to withdraw from the league and join the newer Maryland Public Secondary Schools Athletic Association (MPSSA) which included the rest of the 23 counties of the state and had grown since its establishment in the 1950s with the growth of suburban and rural public secondary schools and the new additional co-ed and girls athletic programs. The shrunken MSA, once vaunted for its unique public-private competitions for almost 75 years, rare in the nation, was forced to re-organize as the \\"twin private leagues\\" of the Maryland Interscholastic Athletic Association for boys and the Interscholastic Athletic Association of Maryland for girls sports. ** Public Library Association formed in Annapolis, later develops into county-wide system for Anne Arundel County. City of Annapolis allows space in historic Reynolds Tavern on Church Circle by 1936. Additional library association forms in northern county in Glen Burnie by 1923 and opens in front room of Masonic Temple. * 1920 ‚Äì Citizens National Bank skyscraper tower erected at southwest corner of Light Street (additional postal address at 7 East Redwood [previously long-time name of German Street before World War I] Streets), succeeding Bromo-Seltzer Tower and Maryland Casualty Company's Tower Building (both with large landmark clocks on the east and west sides of downtown business district) as the city's tallest building until 1929 and construction of Baltimore Trust's \\"Art Deco\\"style tower one block north. Later becomes headquarters of prominent First National Bank of Maryland (one of the largest financial institutions in the state), until flurry of bank mergers and out-of- town take-overs in the 2000s. Old Citizens National has the most beautiful, elaborate banking room/lobby in the city. Now occupied by the Municipal Employees Credit Union of Baltimore City (MECU). ** First of annual football game played November 12 of traditional rivalry between Roman Catholic high schools ‚Äì Calvert Hall College (Christian Brothers) and Loyola High School (Jesuits (Society of Jesus)) in the public-private high school sports league Maryland Scholastic Association founded the previous year.

The new renovated stadium, constructed with a large prominent front brick fa√ßade with huge aluminum \\"Art Deco\\" styled lettering with words of dedication to the soldiers of the recent World War II inscribed facing 33rd Street (unlike old Municipal's open end with a Greco-Roman columnade on the contrasting southside facing 33rd Street). Later construction of an upper deck with small mezzanine level in-between begins in a rush-job project during later winter of 1953 and spring 1954, when the transfer and movement of the former St. Louis Browns team of major league baseball to the Chesapeake Bay region is later finally approved by the owners in the American League during a meeting in the Commodore Hotel in New York City, during September 1953, with business leader Clarence Miles who led a local investment group including with Zanvyl Krieger of Gunther Brewing Company, Jerold Hoffberger of National Brewing Company, Joseph Iglehart (investment financier), James Keelty (real estate broker), and the City Soliciter Thomas Biddison, and the firm support of Mayor Thomas J. D'Alesandro, Jr., (1903‚Äì1987), [served 1947‚Äì1959], after an earlier disappointing \\"no\\" vote during the American League spring meeting in Miami because of owners distaste for controversial maverick Browns' recent owner Bill Veeck still holding an ownership stake in Baltimore. When the Baltimore ownership group agrees later to buy out Veeck's majority stock, the A.L. owners approve the purchase and move of the half-century old St. Louis A.L. franchise. The relocated team is immediately renamed the Baltimore Orioles in honor of the local favorite ball team name in the City since the 1880s. It is only the second Major League Baseball franchise to be moved in a half-century and the first to change its mascot name in a new city. ** New pro football team and franchise awarded to the city in the major National Football League, which had been founded earlier in 1920 as the American Professional Football Association (and renamed N.F.L. in 1922). Returns the name of the Baltimore Colts (continuing the name of the previous Colts team in the newly founded competing All-America Football Conference (AAFC) [1946‚Äì1949], which had a Colts team from the Conference's second season (replacing the old Miami Seahawks), 1947 to 1949 when the Conference merged with the old NFL and three AAFC teams entered the newly merged NFL, including the San Francisco 49ers, Cleveland Browns and the Colts. New Colts play in the League briefly for one year of 1950 before financial reasons and ownership collapses. Pro football team Colts of the AAFC with later famous quarterback Y. A. Tittle, (who later plays for New York Giants) plays at old big-bowled Municipal Stadium on 33rd Street as reconstruction project begins 1949‚Äì1950 to rebuild old facility of Municipal Stadium (aka Baltimore Stadium or Venable Stadium from 1922) adding an upper deck into later renamed Memorial Stadium (completed March, then summer 1954). ** Baltimore Civic Opera Company which had earlier put on productions during the 1930s despite the financial decline and massive widespread unemployment during the \\"Great Depression\\" at the luxurious Maryland and Auditorium Theatres (now closed Mayfair Theatre for movies, both bracketing corner alongside the Congress Hotel [formerly Kernan's] at West Franklin and North Howard Streets) along with the nearby 1894 Lyric Opera House facing Mount Royal Avenue, was reorganized after temporarily closing following earlier 1947 death of director Eugene Martinet, (Peabody Institute grad and founder of Martinet Opera School in 1927) who had carried on the Company from its earlier 1917 establishment during World War I-era. That company continued into the 1920s under conductor David S. Melamet, (known for leading German \\"Sangerfest\\" cultural musical festivals), founded the Baltimore Opera Society. This new version of the Baltimore Civic Opera Company (B.C.O.C.) continuing with some similar leaders and members, reorganized in 1931 with first production of The Mikado performed in October 1932 under Eugene Martinet. Third version of B.C.O.C. re-organized November 1948, (with some small productions apparently put on before 1950), incorporated 1950, with support of Mary M. Martinet, former conductor's widow continuing as director, son Leigh Martinet as music director, and Grant U. Stiner ‚Äì business manager, with now the lasting powerful influence of former famous 1930s Metropolitan Opera Company of New York's opera singer Rosa Ponselle. She had retired to an exclusive wealthy estate \\"Villa Pace\\" in the Greenspring Valley of northern rural Baltimore County, later serving as artistic director of the Company for several decades. A city of musicales, dramatic live plays and productions since the first theatre constructed here in the 1780s with later 19th Century productions in around the downtown business district of various opera and musicale plays organized under famous local civic leader and famous theater owner John T. Ford, Sr. (of infamous Ford's Theater in Washington, D.C. where 16th President Abraham Lincoln was shot in April 1865), and was later owner/manager/producer of several playhouses in Baltimore, including the landmark 1871 Ford's Grand Opera House long-running on West Fayette Street ‚Äì between Howard and Eutaw Streets, endured to 1964. Also in the late 1800s and early 1900s, was owner of several local theaters, builder and impresserio, James L. Kernan, builder of the apex of hospitality and hostelery with an art gallery and live theater entertainment by construction of his landmark Kernan's Hotel, in 1903 (later renamed Congress Hotel after Kernan's death in 1912), along with adjacent/connected Maryland Theatre and around the corner, the elaborate fa√ßaded Auditorium Theatre (now closed/decrepit Mayfair Theatre for motion pictures facing Howard Street) on northwest corner of North Howard and West Franklin Streets, his \\"triple million dollar enterprises\\". Martinet and Ponselle along with other well-connected backers reorganized a third Baltimore Civic Opera (\\"Civic\\" name dropped from title in 1970) begins 1950 season with Giuseppi Verdi's Aida production at the auditorium at the old Maryland Casualty Company's \\"Rotunda\\" office building on West 40th Street and Keswick Road, (between Roland Park and Hampden neighborhoods in the northern residential section of town), the next year moves briefly to the largest city public high school auditorium at the old Baltimore Polytechnic Institute on East North Avenue and North Calvert Streets, then returns 1952 to largest seating capacity at the old Lyric. Many productions of expense and large casts of over a hundred members in the previous half-century at the landmark Lyric Opera House (built 1894) on Mount Royal Avenue. Here the Opera Company observed its 50th Silver Anniversary in 2000, but unfortunately, was later hit by unusually devastating financial troubles during the \\"Great Recession\\" of 2008 and the B.O.C. is closed in bankruptcy, joining earlier the Maryland Ballet or Baltimore Ballet as part of the city's cultural history. ** New larger international airport laid out and constructed by the City of Baltimore in northern Anne Arundel County at site of small village of \\"Friendship\\", (southwest of Glen Burnie, south of Linthicum) giving the air terminal its new name: \\"Friendship International Airport\\", (later renamed in the early 1970s as \\"Baltimore-Washington International Airport\\" (BWI) when taken over by the larger resources of the State of Maryland's new Department of Transportation). Dedicated June 24, by city and state officials joined by 33rd President Harry S. Truman, who flies in on one of the first presidential transport planes \\"Independence\\" with the Governor of Maryland, William Preston Lane, Jr. and Baltimore Mayor Thomas D'Alesandro, Jr., both on their first flights.

New modern Friendship Airport has large tan brick terminal building with iconic popular observation platform on the roof of one of the wings/concourses used by many curious Maryland citizens \\"watching the planes\\" becomes a popular destination for Sunday afternoon car drives. Ties city into international links of world air travel and commerce for next half-century and sees tremendous growth in only two decades by the 1970s with compete re-building and expansion of facilities, joining regional airports of Washington National Airport along the Potomac River shore and Dulles International Airport in western D.C. suburbs of Loudoun County, Virginia for use of the national capital. ** New headquarters banking building constructed for Baltimore Federal Savings and Loan Association, largest S. & L. in the region in a distinctive Georgian architecture-styled building at southwest corner of East Fayette Street and St. Paul Street, a block north of junction with Light Street.

Polytechnic is a \\"magnet\\", specialized mathematics, science, engineering and technology public high school, and the case is made not to try and duplicate a similar institution just for Negro students. Predates by two years later, the U.S. Supreme Court landmark decision in \\"Brown vs. Board of Education of Topeka, Kansas\\" and other cases, by May 1954. City School Board accepts decision in Baltimore with minor limited controversy as city schools integrate the following September 1954. ** Negotiations concluded in October between group of Baltimore businessmen led by attorney Clarence Miles (later elected in 1960s as U.S. Representative (congressman) from Baltimore County) and Mayor Thomas D'Alesandro with maverick baseball team owner Bill Veeck to bring the American League baseball franchise of the old St. Louis Browns to Baltimore for the following 1954‚Äì1955 season, marking the city's return to Major League Baseball after fifty-one years. * 1953 ‚Äì ** B&O; Transportation Museum, under the sponsorship of the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad Company opens at the former Mount Clare Station and Shops, along West Pratt Street with the old 1884 Roundhouse and workshops in the Poppleton/Union Square/Mount Clare section of southwest Baltimore.

Entire city in delirium with Opening Day parade in April through downtown with new/old team members and ceremonies with Vice President Richard M. Nixon throwing out the first ball in first game versus Chicago White Sox. ** Cylburn Wildflower Preserve and Garden Center formed to preserve and advance the gardens around the former \\"Cylburn\\" mansion of stone Victorian- style architecture and home of industrialist and Quaker stalwart Elisha Tyson on Greenspring Avenue, north of Druid Hill Park, later renamed \\"Cylburn Arboretum\\". ** Final and full Desegregation of the Baltimore City Public School System, put into practice with Fall opening of public schools by moderate and progressive members of the city's Board of School Commissioners in September, after previous May 1954's U.S. Supreme Court unanimous decision.

Edwards ‚Äì athletic coach and later noted Principal of the Baltimore City College in the 1930s and 1940s along with some other coaches and principals) for central Maryland area private/parochial/independent secondary schools and the high schools of Baltimore City (only a few high schools then existed in other suburban counties such as Baltimore, Harford, Carroll, Howard and Frederick Counties and the distance/expense with streetcars, inter-urban electric commuter trains or highway buses then used for weekly competitions was prohibitive). The MSA was one of the first public- private high school athletic leagues in the country and its championships long constituted a \\"state championship\\". The later Maryland Public Secondary Schools Athletic Association (MPSSA) was not established until the latter 1950s as a burst of high schools opened in surrounding Baltimore County with beginning athletic programs for boys only, and spread to a statewide system which competed with the older senior league until the early 1990s, when a new Baltimore City superintendent of schools, Walter Amprey, who graduated and began his teaching career in the city, spent most of his supervising/administrative career in the suburban Baltimore County system, forced the withdrawal of the city schools (especially including athletic, all- male powerhouses City, Poly, and the co-ed neighborhood schools: Douglass, Dunbar (previously \\"colored schools\\"), and co-ed neighborhood schools ‚Äì Forest Park, Patterson, Southern, Edmondson, Northern, Northwestern, Southwestern, Lake Clifton, Walbrook, plus co-ed vocational-technical institutions at Merganthaler and Carver and all-girls secondary schools Western High School and Eastern High School) became part of the now larger \\"state league\\" with its wider membership and reach now into all 23 counties of Maryland with play-offs scheduled annually at the statewide University of Maryland at College Park or University of Maryland Baltimore County larger athletic facilities. The M.S.A. re-organized itself as split into two private school leagues with one for boys and another for girls sports. Although losing its exemplary private-public athletic partnership and competition, (rare in secondary schools competition in the United States), Baltimore is also one of the first school systems in the nation to peacefully integrate its high school athletic programs and led to a great advance in racial harmony in the City in the next two decades unlike some Southern and border states which endured hostility and protests into the 1980s. * 1957 ‚Äì ** Rapidly growing outer suburbs in Harford County in the northeast Baltimore metro area establishes a junior college (later called community college), with the opening in September of the Harford Junior College with 116 students on the campus of the Bel Air High School in the county seat of Bel Air.

New suburban campus of several modern office buildings is constructed in the Woodlawn area (formerly known as Powhatan) of western Baltimore County, just off the route of the under- construction \\"Baltimore Beltway\\" (Interstate 695). Central access route through the area is designated Security Boulevard. Social Security becomes one of the major employers of the county and metro region. Old Candler Building had been the regional headquarters of the Coca-Cola Bottling Company of Atlanta, Georgia, of which Asa Griggs Candler, (1851‚Äì1929), whom the building was named for, was the prime mover, founder and industrialist. Candler Building still exists and renovated by the 2010s. ** In November, the shortstop for the Baltimore Orioles Major League Baseball home team Ron Hansen, age 22 is elected by a voting landslide as \\"Rookie of the Year\\" in the American League with batting 22 home runs and 82 RBIs.

A review of this work by Virginia Leonard notes \\"Asunci√≥n Lavrin is ... a pioneer in Latin American women's history. ... The publication of this book marks a watershed for Latin American studies: It is difficult to conceive that there will be any more books on politics and political parties in the Southern Cone that ignore women and feminist issues.\\" Lavrin has also edited several books, including the 2006 volume co-edited with Rosalva Loreto, Di√°logos espirituales: Letras Femeninas Hispanoamericanas, Siglos XVI-XIX, and Latin American Women: Historical Perspectives (Greenwood Press, 1978).

The bird is ill and asks its grieving mother to pray in the temples on its behalf. The mother replies that since it was a robber of the sacrifices there, religious observance would now be of no use. The fable appears in the collection of William Caxton and in many others, generally with a reflection on the uselessness of death-bed repentance. In the 1546 edition of the Emblemata by Andrea Alciato the story is modified. There the bird vomits and is told by its parent that it is losing nothing of its own, since all it has eaten was stolen.Fable 129 The fable is used to illustrate the Latin proverb male parta, male dilabuntur (ill-gotten, ill- spent). A sceptical variation on the theme directed against religious observance later appeared in Gotthold Ephraim Lessing's collection of prose fables (1759). 'The fox, observing that the raven plundered the altars of the gods, and that he supported himself from their sacrifices, said to himself: I should like to know whether the raven partakes of their sacrifices because he is a prophetical bird; or whether he is deemed a prophetical bird because he is so insolent as to partake of the sacrifices?'Fables and epigrams from the German of Lessing, London 1825, p.43 References External links Book illustrations from the 16th-19th centuries Sick Kite, The Emblem books Fictional birds ","title":"The Sick Kite"},{"id":"37024342","text":"Atle Nymo (born 9 June 1977) is a Norwegian jazz musician (tenor saxophone and bass clarinet), and the younger brother of Jazz saxophonist Frode Nymo.

On her father's side, her grandparents were Ordo√±o III and Queen Urraca Fern√°ndez, daughter of count Fern√°n Gonz√°lez of Castile. Her grandparents on her mother's side were most probably Count Ramiro Men√©ndez and his wife Adosinda Guti√©rrez, both members of the highest Galaico-Portuguese nobility. thumb When her father King Bermudo repudiated his first wife and married Elvira Garc√≠a, with whom he had King Alfonso V of Le√≥n and the infantas Teresa and Sancha Berm√∫dez, Cristina left the court in the city of Le√≥n with her mother and settled in Asturias.  Marriage and issue Shortly after 1000 and before 1016, Cristina married Ordo√±o Ram√≠rez, son of Ramiro III of Le√≥n and most likely Sancha G√≥mez. From this marriage, probably encouraged and planned by Queen Velasquita and the widowed Queen Teresa Ans√∫rez, both living in the Monastery of San Pelayo in Oviedo, descends the lineage of the Ordo√±ez, the most important in Asturias during the 11th-century. Rodrigo Jim√©nez de Rada in his chronicle on King Bermudo II mentions \\"...with Velasquita he had Infanta Cristina; this Cristina with Ordo√±o 'the Blind', son of King Ramiro, was the mother of Alfonso, Ordo√±o, countess Pelaya and Aldonza\\", information which coincides with the names of her children as found in the charters of several monasteries in Asturias, including the Monastery of the Holy Savior in Cornellana, the Monastery of San Juan Bautista de Corias and the Cathedral of Oviedo.

She was probably buried at the monastery which she founded and where she had become a nun. Years later, Count Suero Verm√∫dez, son of Bermudo Ov√©quiz and grandson of her daughter Aldonza Ord√≥√±ez, bought all the shares held by family members, donated the monastery to the Abbey of Cluny, but later reversed the donation and gave it to the Cathedral of Oviedo.

He was best known for his work on the flora of the Swiss Alps, cryptogams, and the Polygalaceae or Milkwort plant family, as well as his years in the publishing industry. Early life Alfred William Bennett was son of Quakers William Bennett (1804‚Äì1873),William Bennett's date of death, age at death and residence were recorded in the Annual monitor 1874, p. 5. Alfred, his father and paternal grandfather (also William Bennett) have entries in the Biographical Dictionary of British Quakers in Commerce and Industry a successful tea dealer, amateur botanist, and sometime emu breeder, and Elizabeth (Trusted) Bennett (1798‚Äì1891), an author of religious books for the Society of Friends. William Bennett also corresponded with biologist Charles Darwin, though he did not accept the latter's theories concerning evolutionary biology.Cleevely (2004a), p. 181. Alfred Bennett, a lifelong believer in evolution unlike his father, would later establish his own correspondence with the noted theorist. William Bennett took great interest in the education of his children, whom he schooled at home. The elder Bennett was influenced in his ideas of education by the writings of the Swiss philosopher and educational reformer Johann Heinrich Pestalozzi, and in the winter of 1841‚Äì1842, he took his family to Switzerland so that his children could study at the Pestalozzian School at Appenzell.Baker (1902), p. 157. It was during this trip that Alfred Bennett learned the German language, a skill that would help him in his future writings on Alpine plant life. William Bennett also created an environment conducive to the study of the natural sciences for his children. Between 1851 and 1854, he took Alfred and his brother Edward Trusted Bennett (1831‚Äì1908) on several walking tours of Wales and the western regions of England, where the boys studied British flora and took extensive notes on their observations. Their father also introduced them to noted entomologists and family friends Edward Newman, Henry Doubleday, and Edward Doubleday.Baker (1902), pp. 157‚Äì158. Education and Publishing Bennett attended University College London, where he received a BA with honours in chemistry and Botany in 1853, an MA in Biology in 1855, and a BSc in Biology in 1868.Cleevely (2004b). In 1858 he married Katharine Richardson (1835‚Äì1892) and turned to publishing as a career,\\"Katharine Bennett\\" (1893), p. 22.\\"Alfred William Bennett\\" (1902), p. 26. taking over the business at 5, Bishopsgate Without, formerly run by Charles Gilpin and later by William & Frederick G.

A 16-page catalogue of newly published books is printed at the back of Working womenof the last half century available online. While he only spent the next 10 years as a publisher, he worked off and on in various aspects of the industry for the rest of his life.Stafleu (1993), p. 70 He was the editor and publisher of The Friend, an independent weekly publication for members of the Society of Friends. He was one of the first publishers to use photographic illustrations; and the first sub-editor of the journal Nature.S.A.S. (1902), p. 321. Additionally, he went on to be the editor of the Journal of the Royal Microscopical Society, the main publication of the Royal Microscopical Society, an institution in which he was a fellow and also served three terms as vice-president. Botanical career Between 1871 and 1873 Bennett wrote a series of papers on fertilisation in plants that brought him to the attention of Charles Darwin, who encouraged his efforts. In particular, Bennett clarified many of the processes in flower fertilisation and established core terminology for its description, as well as illuminating how flower structure could facilitate cross-fertilization. Bennett also began to write on Polygalaceae during this time, and he contributed synopses of species within that family for the 1874 publication Flora Brasiliensis and J.D. Hooker's 1872 volume Flora of British India. During a walking tour of Switzerland in 1875, Bennett's interest in the natural world of the Swiss Alps was also rekindled after finding 200 species of flowering plants he had not seen before in the field. This led to his translation of J. Seboth's Alpenpflanzen nach der Natur gemalt as Alpine Plants (1879‚Äì84) and work on Austrian scientist K.W. von Dalla Torre's Tourists' Guide to the Flora of the Austrian Alps (1882, 1886), as well as Bennett's own definitive work The Flora of the Alps (1897). He also worked extensively on cryptogams, especially freshwater algae, during the last two decades as a botanist. In 1889, he published A Handbook of Cryptogamic Botany with his coauthor George Robert Milne Murray. His obituary in the Journal of the Royal Microscopical Society calls it his \\"most valuable original work.\\"Baker (1902), p. 157. Bennett also spent many years as lecturer in Botany at St Thomas' Hospital and Bedford College.Bedford College was a women's higher education college, which won the right to award degrees in 1878. Higher education of women After his retirement from publishing, in 1868, he and his wife opened their house in Park Village East, Regent's Park, for a limited number of ladies coming up to London to study. From this time forward he took a keen interest in the education of women.His views on the higher education of women were expressed in an article in Friends' quarterly examiner ; Vol.3; no.11 (Seventh Mo. 1869), p. 371-392 Upon him personally fell a large share of the effort.Obituary in Annual monitor for 1903. On 15 May 1878, University of London Convocation, received an address signed by 1,960 women, asking that the university \\"throw open all its degrees to women. A.W.Bennett was one of the speakers, named in the Times report of the ensuing debate.The Times, Thursday, May 16, 1878; pg. 11; Issue 29256; col A \\"University Intelligence: University of London‚Äù report of Convocation After nearly ten years, the campaign was successful in authorising the awarding of degrees to women by the University of London. Evolution Bennett accepted that evolution occurred but was a critic of natural selection.Cantor, Geoffrey. (2005). Quakers, Jews, and Science: Religious Responses to Modernity and the Sciences in Britain, 1650-1900. Oxford University Press. pp. 280-282. In 1870, he wrote a critical paper in the Nature journal entitled The Theory of Natural selection from a Mathematical Point of View. He argued that small random variations could not accumulate in any single direction as the incipient steps of a modification of an organ would be useless to the individual.Elleg√•rd, Alvar. (1990). Darwin and the General Reader: The Reception of Darwin's Theory of Evolution in the British Periodical Press, 1859-1872. University of Chicago Press. p. 87. His arguments were rejected by Alfred Russel Wallace.Bowler, Peter J. (1976). Alfred Russel Wallace's Concepts of Variation. Journal of the History of Medicine 31: 17‚Äì29. In 1871, Bennett endorsed St. George Jackson Mivart criticisms of natural selection and wrote a supportive review of his book On the Genesis of Species. Bennett wrote a review of Charles Darwin's On the Origin of Species in 1872. He praised parts of the book but raised objections to natural selection. He held that it was incompetent to account for the initial stages of mimicry. Darwin wrote to Bennett \\"I thank you sincerely for your generous review of the last. Edit. of the Origin, more especially as we different so greatly & I quite agree with you that the only way to arrive at the truth is to discuss & freely express all different of opinion.\\" Despite their differences, Bennett wrote a supportive review of Darwin's book Insectivorous Plants and they exchanged friendly letters. He also wrote a paper that disputed the arguments of Fritz M√ºller that a protective mimicry in Lepidoptera could be explained by natural selection.Bennett, Alfred W. (1877). Is Protective Mimicry Due to Natural Selection?. The American Naturalist 11 (1): 3‚Äì7. Death Bennett died suddenly from a heart attack in Oxford Circus while riding home to Regent's Park atop an omnibus. A lifelong Quaker, he is buried in a Quaker burial- ground in Isleworth next to his wife Katharine. The couple was childless.\\"Alfred William Bennett\\" (1902), p. 27.

In workers and females the thorax is reddish or brownish-red, while the head and the abdomen are brown. Males are completely brown. The longevity of the queen reaches up to 30 years, but for workers it is limited to 3 years. The species is omnivore. Colonies are monogynous (one queen per colony). They are not aggressive but they do not mind attacking a potential predator or another colony to expand their hunting and harvesting territory. Distribution This species is present in the Western Palearctic (Europe, the Caucasus, and Asia Minor). Colony founding The nuptial flight happens between June and August. Although normal independent colony foundation is usual, it can also be achieved through Pleometrosis, a process in which several queens work together to get the colony started, but eventually the future workers will kill or drive away all queens but the dominant one.

History In 1892, Vance Lumber Company purchased the Humboldt Bay frontage from Samoa Land and Improvement Company for construction of a large sawmill. Eureka and Klamath River Railroad was chartered in 1893 to connect the Samoa, CA sawmill and associated worker housing facilities to the city of Arcata and timberlands near the Mad River. The Samoa sawmill was the largest in Humboldt County when purchased by Andrew B. Hammond in 1900. A sash and door factory was added to the mill complex by 1909, and the company was reorganized as the Hammond Lumber Company in 1912. Hammond Lumber Company built an emergency shipyard during World War I, and seven wooden steam-ships were built at Samoa between 1917 and 1919.[14] The 1921-22 Belcher Atlas of Humboldt County breaks down private and commercial land ownership throughout the county, showing that by 1922, the region of Samoa was parceled into an extractive resource industry. The largest tracts of land belonged to Hammond Lumber Company, while other enterprises included the Little River Redwood Company, the San Francisco Land Company, Big Lagoon Lumber Company, and Dolbeer & Carson Lumber Company, the latter owning the northerly marsh inlets stretching between the modern-day Arcata Bottoms and Mad River. Hammond Lumber Company railroads brought logs and lumber to Samoa from company outposts on the Little River and Big Lagoon until the railway trestles were destroyed by wildfire in 1945. The Hammond- Little River Redwood Company, Ltd. was formed in a 1931 merger with Hammond Lumber Company. This resulted in the former Little River Redwood Company transferring control of former company towns to Hammond Lumber, such as with Crannell. The Humboldt Northern Railway connection to Samoa was dismantled in 1948. Hammond became a subsidiary of Georgia-Pacific Corporation in 1956. After Georgia-Pacific was ordered to break up to a ruling with the Federal Trade Commission, it became incorporated as Louisiana Pacific in 1973. L-P was headed by Harry Merlo and would be based out of Portland, OR for the next 33 years, moving to Nashville in 2004.

Biography  Constantin Kluge was born on January 29, 1912 in Riga, then a large industrial port city in the Russian Empire. Kluge was born into a family of means and some status. His paternal grandfather had spent years in France studying the cultivation of vines and wine making. Returning to Russia he developed a successful winery. Kluge's father, also Constantin, was a member of the Russian Army General Staff and a White Army sympathizer. Kluge's mother, Liouba Ignatieva, was an academic who also came from a military family. When his parents met, young Liouba was serving as tutor to the children of Russian Grand Duke Michel, the younger brother of Czar Nicholas II.\\"Les Morts Ont Donn√© Signes de Vie;\\" Jean Prieur; Fernand Lanore, Paris; 1984; p. 53. The family moved often, following Constantin Sr.'s deployments with the counter rebellion armies. Each move seemed to take the family further and further east as the revolution spread and the White Sympathizers controlled a decreasing part of the country. Kluge settled in Paris in 1950 and soon thereafter found representation in a French gallery on Rue Saint-Honore. In 1964 he became a citizen of France. Kluge was married three times and had one child, Michel. His first wife and child's mother was Tania de Liphart. Kluge's second wife was Mary Starr (n√©e Malcolm), the former wife of AIG Founder Neil Starr.\\"Fallen Giant: The Amazing Story of Hank Greenberg and the History of AIG;\\"Ronald Shelp and Al Ehrbar; John Wiley & Sons, Hoboken New Jersey; 2009; p.72. Kluge died on 9 January 2003 in France.Paid Notice: Deaths KLUGE, CONSTANTIN, New York Times, 16 January 2003  Early Life  In the winter of 1919-1920, the family traveled via train to Harbin, Manchuria. Living in Manchuria, Kluge first discovered an interest in art while learning Chinese. Kluge enjoyed beauty of drawing the characters of Mandarin and proper technique for holding the brush. Eventually, with the situation in Manchuria changing, the family moved to Beijing. At school in Beijing, Kluge was first introduced to formal art study, studying under the direction of the Russian artist Podgursky Chernomyrdin. Although he demonstrated real talent as an artist, he would pursue architecture in France. In Paris, Kluge earned admission into the √âcole des Beaux Arts to study architecture and in 1937 he earned his diploma. His intention to had been to return to Beijing. However he was stymied by his to desire to paint the river banks, bridges, and streets of Paris he had come to love. He chose to spend six months painting Paris after graduating, after which he returned east to Shanghai, not Beijing.  Artistic Career  In Shanghai, the turn world events helped force Kluge to paint. As an aspiring architect, he took a job in the office that processed building permits for the Shanghai French Concession. However with the outbreak of the war, building nearly ceased as raw materials were being confiscated by the Japanese for their military. Kluge filled his time with painting. In 1946, with Mao Tse-tung was sweeping southward and foreigners were flooding out of Shanghai, Kluge moved to Hong Kong, continuing to work as an architect. However, Kluge still found himself hypnotized by painting. After showing some of his completed works to his friends, they convinced him to exhibit his works publicly. Thus, Kluge began to exhibit his paintings of Paris around China, to much success. Realizing that his hobby of painting, which he had never considered as a possibility as a career, could actually support him and his family, Kluge made the decision to pursue a career in art full time. in 1950, Kluge moved back to Paris, leaving China for good and resolving to become a professional painter. His background in architecture heavily informed his works, the Parisian buildings he paints being depicted with striking architectural and structural accuracy. In Paris just as in China, his street scenes were met with delight. In his very first salon, the Paris Salon in 1951, his paintings won awards and garnered a fair amount of attention. In the 1960s, Kluge's work caught the eye of American art dealer Wally Findlay, of Wally Findlay Galleries. Findlay began to represent Kluge, bringing his Parisian paintings to America and showing them in his galleries in New York, Chicago, and Los Angeles. Kluge continued to achieve great success in his artistic career, receiving several awards and honors, and showing his works across Europe and America.  Christianity  As a young man in China, Kluge became focused on his Christianity, and befriended several Jesuit missionaries including Pierre Teilhard de Chardin and Pierre Leroy. Their correspondence and notes on their friendship are housed in the Georgetown University Library's special collections.

The village lies above the eastern bank of the River Bovey from which it takes its name. In 2001 the population of the parish was 274, compared to 418 in 1901 and 519 in 1801. The parish church The parish church is built of granite and is dedicated to St. John the Baptist. It dates from the 14th century, and was restored early in the 20th century by Sir Charles Nicholson. It is one of the several churches around Dartmoor that has a representation of the tinners rabbits on one of its roof bosses. On the village green is an ancient stone cross which was thrown down during the Civil War and spent some time afterwards as a bridge over a local stream. In 1829 it was retrieved and installed into a socket-stone which had remained in situ on the village green, though it is not considered likely that it is the original cross that was mounted here as it appears to be older than the base. Sanders, a fine 16th-century longhouse at Lettaford The parish encompasses part of the eastern side of Dartmoor, an area rich in Bronze Age remains such as Grimspound, right on its boundary. The medieval Bennett's Cross, on the road between Moretonhampstead and Two Bridges is one of the markers of the parish boundary, and the Birch Tor and Vitifer tin mining area is nearby. In the north of the parish, the small settlements of Beeson and Shapley were mentioned in the Domesday Book. There are several preserved Dartmoor longhouses in the parish, notably at Lettaford and Westcombe. Also within the parish is Bovey Castle, designed by Detmar Blow and built in 1905‚Äì7 for Viscount Hambledon, son of W. H. Smith, the newsagent.

Bishop Israel wrote about the customs of the Huns and their deities: * Kuara - god of thunder. * Aspandiat - old Hun hero, which was deified. * Fire, Water, an unnamed goddess of roads.  Cruxification of St. Bartholomeus  According to a legend, Bartholomeus came to a place which is on the shore of Caspian Sea which is likely to be Baku, cured the daughter of the local king, Polymius, of her madness, and was subsequently granted by the king the right to preach freely in his territory. The Apostolic Acts of Abdias tell that locals worshipped a goddess by the name of Astaroth. In a competition with the local priesthood, Bartholomew assembled a large crowd in front of an image of the goddess and challenged the deity to show itself. Instead, the statue shattered and an angel appeared. The angel revealed the exorcised demon-deity to the crowd. The goddess, totally black, \\"sharp faced\\", and breathing fire and brimstone, was bound in chains by the angel and sent away. The king, amazed at what he had just seen, was immediately baptised along with many of his subjects. The king's brother, Astyages, heard of the baptisms and declared war on the Christian community. Bartolomew was beaten with clubs, skinned alive and then finally beheaded in front of Maiden Tower.  Persecution of pagans  = Christian persecution of pagans = According to Movses Kaghanvatsi, Vachagan III the Pious of Albania persecuted pagan priests, tortured and forcibly converted them to Christianism. He established a Church School in a city called Rustak and raised children of pagan couples as Christian. = Islamic treatment of pagans = Not much information exists about pagans living during Islamization process of Azerbaijan, because they were converted or executed before arrival of Islam.

Its grounds have now been transformed into a mixed-use development surrounding a pedestrian zone and is now known as √òsterf√¶lled Torv. Many of the old buildings have been retained while others have been demolished to make way for new residential buildings. The old main entrance to the barracks is located on the corner of √òsterbrogade and Gunner Nu Hansens Plads. History The gate of √òsterf√¶lled Barracks seen on a poster √òsterf√¶lled Barracks were designed by Eugen J√∏rgensen and built between 1897 and 1898 for the Guard Hussars, the light cavalry regiment of the Royal Danish Army. The facility was named after the site, the Eastern Commons (√òster F√¶lled), which had come under urban development after the decommissioning of Copenhagen's fortifications. St. James' Church, the first church to be built in √òsterbro, had been completed next to √òsterbrogade a little closer to the city in 1878 but other than that the area was still sparsely developed. The name of the facility was changed to √òsterbrogade Barracks after the cavalry moved to N√¶stved in 1940. √òsterf√¶lled Barracks photographed by Frederik Riise in 1898 After the end of the Second World War, the Air Force Regiment and 10th Artillery Department, until then based at Artillerivej Barracks, took over the premises in November 1945. Later the Danish Defence Academy was based at the site. A local plan for redevelopment of the grounds was drafted in 1992 and the area was subsequently acquired by the pension fund P√¶dagogernes Pensionskasse (PBU) in 1993. Some of the old buildings were demolished to make way for new residential buildings. Others were converted into retail and commercial space. Architecture The symmetrical complex was laid out around a central axis extending diagonally into the main entrance on the corner of √òsterbrogade and present day Gunner Nu Hansens Plads. The gate is topped by King Frederick VII's monogram and flanked by two guardhouses with hipped roofs.

These free or subsidized meals have the potential to increase household food security, which can improve children's health and expand their educational opportunities. A study of a free school meal program in the United States found that providing free meals to elementary and middle school children in areas characterized by high food insecurity led to increased school discipline among the students. The biggest school meal program in the United States is the National School Lunch Program (NSLP), which was signed into law by President Harry S. Truman in 1946. Its purpose is to prevent malnutrition and provide a foundation for good nutritional health. The text of the National School Lunch Act, which established the program, called it a \\"measure of national security, to safeguard the health and well-being of the nation's children and to encourage domestic consumption of nutritious agricultural commodities\\".http://www.fns.usda.gov/sites/default/files/NSLA.pdf The NSLP currently operates in more than 100,000 public schools, nonprofit private schools, and residential care institutions. It provides more than 5 billion low-cost or free lunches per year to eligible students, with the goal of ensuring nutritious meals for children who might not otherwise have access to a proper diet. In 2012, it served more than 31 million children per day.  Food insecurity in children  Food insecurity includes both inadequate quantity and inadequate quality of food. Children need not just enough calories, but also enough nutrients for proper growth and development, and improper or stunted growth can have a variety of medical and developmental implications. Food insecurity and malnutrition can affect children's educational outcomes, family life, and overall health. It has been linked to worse development outcomes for children, such as impaired social and reading skills. = Prevalence = Food insecurity has risen in recent years. Between 2007 and 2008, the rate in the U.S. increased from 11.1 percent to 14.6 percent, the largest annual increase since researchers began tracking the rate in the mid-1990s. Among households with children, food insecurity increased from 15.8 percent to 21 percent during that period. Four million American children \\"experience prolonged periodic food insufficiency and hunger each year\\", which amounts to 8 percent of children under the age of 12. An additional 21 percent are at risk. = Implications = Food insecurity affects the health and well-being of children in several ways. It is a major threat to \\"growth, health, cognitive, and behavioral potential\\", and most behavioral, emotional, and academic problems are more prevalent among hungry children than non-hungry children. Food insecurity is linked to lower math scores, trouble getting along with peers, poor health, and more frequent illness. A study by researchers at the Boston University School of Medicine found that children aged 6‚Äì11 who came from food-insecure homes had lower arithmetic scores, were more likely to have repeated a grade or seen a therapist, and had more difficulty getting along with peers than similar children in food-secure homes. Hungry children are much more likely to have clinical levels of psychosocial dysfunction, and they show more anxious, irritable, aggressive, and oppositional behaviors than peers whose families are low-income but food-secure. In addition to academic and behavioral problems, children with inadequate diets are more prone to illnesses. Researchers have found that malnutrition leads to an array of health problems that can become chronic. Underfed children may have \\"extreme weight loss, stunted growth, weakened resistance to infection\\", and even early death. Such ailments reduce the amount of time students can spend learning at school. These cognitive, behavioral, and physical problems are exacerbated in children who, in addition to being undernourished, are from impoverished backgrounds. Scientists now believe that \\"malnutrition alters intellectual development by interfering with overall health as well as the child's energy level, rate of motor development and rate of growth.\\" Moreover, \\"low economic status can exacerbate all [of] these factors, placing impoverished children at particular risk for cognitive impairment later in life\\". Education and food both have an effect on the \\"central capabilities\\" described by Martha Nussbaum, an American philosopher. These capabilities, which Nussbaum saw as integral to raising people above the poverty threshold, are: life, bodily health, bodily integrity, sense, imagination and thought, emotions, practical reason, affiliation, other species, play, and control over one's environment (both political and material).Nussbaum, Martha Craven. 2011. Creating Capabilities: The Human Development Approach. Cambridge, MA: Belknap of Harvard UP. Nutrition affects bodily health and bodily integrity, and education has broader connections to sense, imagination and thought, practical reason, and control over one's environment. Without these capabilities, according to Nussbaum, people fall into poverty traps and lack the proper opportunities to rise out of them. Government efforts such as meal programs can prevent people from falling into poverty, as well as lift them out of it. History of school meal programs = Pre-World War II = A School Lunch Program recipient in 1936. Before the official establishment of the large-scale, government-funded food programs that are prevalent today in the United States, small, non- governmental programs existed. As early as the late 19th century, cities such as Boston and Philadelphia operated independent school lunch programs, with the assistance of volunteers or charities. Until the 1930s, most school lunch programs were volunteer efforts led by teachers and mothers' clubs.Levine, Susan. School Lunch Politics: The Surprising History of America's Favorite Welfare Program. Princeton: Princeton UP, 2008. These programs drew on the expertise of professional home economics. For the people who began these programs, school lunchrooms were the perfect setting in which to feed poor children and, more importantly, to teach immigrant and middle-class children the principles of nutrition and healthy eating. Thus, the original intent of school meal programs was not primarily to increase the food security of impoverished children and alleviate educational problems, but rather to instill cultural norms. During the Great Depression, the numbers of hungry children seeking food overwhelmed lunchrooms. Thus, local programs began to look to state governments, and then the national government, for resources. The national government began providing funding for school lunches on a small scale as early as 1932. This funding originated from New Deal agencies such as the Federal Emergency Relief Administration, the Reconstruction Finance Corporation, and the Civil Works Administration. The federal government monitored supplies from commercial farmers and purchased surplus commodities (Levine 6). Schools served as an outlet for federal commodity donations. In 1935, the programs expanded through the Works Progress Administration and the National Youth Administration, both of which provided labor for school cafeterias. During World War II, the War Food Administration (1943‚Äì45) helped create school lunch programs. Eventually, the New Deal policies began to dissolve, and farm surpluses decreased. However, there was still a desire to keep school lunch programs in place, so federal cash assistance began to be appropriated on a year-to-year basis, and the National School Lunch Program was developed. =1946‚Äì2000= The United States Congress passed the National School Lunch Act in 1946 after an investigation found that the poor health of men rejected for the World War II draft was associated with poor nutrition in their childhood. By the end of its first year, the National School Lunch Program had helped 7.1 million children.\\"The School Breakfast Program.\\" N.p., n.d. Web. 24 Oct. 2012. However, from the start, the program linked children's nutrition to the priorities of agricultural and food interests, and to the agenda of the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA). In these early years, the program provided substantial welfare to commercial farmers as an outlet for surplus commodities, but provided few free meals to poor children and fed a relatively small number of schoolchildren. In the 1960s, a group of mainstream national women's organizations began focusing on the shortcomings of the NSLP. The evidence they presented became crucial to Congressional debates on race and poverty. In 1962, Congress amended the NSLP, changing it from a distributor of state-regulated grant aid to a permanently funded meal reimbursement program. In 1969, President Richard Nixon pushed Congress to provide funding for school lunches beyond the reimbursement program, declaring, \\"The time has come to end hunger in America.\\" In between, in 1966, Congress passed the Child Nutrition Act, which stated that educational progress was an objective of school meal programs. The bill, signed by President Lyndon B. Johnson, created the federally subsidized School Breakfast Program (SBP), which supplemented the existing lunch program by providing low-cost or free breakfasts to students at public and nonprofit private schools. It also created the Summer Food Service Program and established National School Lunch Week. By the end of the 1970s, many advocates saw privatization as the only way to keep school lunch programs going. Fast food from private companies began to be served in cafeterias, rather than more nutritious meals. In 1994, a number of changes were made to the NSLP, primarily to standardize the nutritional quality of school meals. Dietary guidelines were proposed to take effect in 1996, and the USDA launched the Healthy School Meals Initiative to improve nutritional education for school-age children. By the end of the 20th century, the NSLP was the nation's second-largest domestic food program, after the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (more commonly known as food stamps). = 21st century = In 2004, as the childhood obesity crisis came into national focus, the USDA urged school districts to establish wellness policies and initiatives tailored to local needs. The USDA regulations were intended to strengthen nutritional education nationwide while giving schools the autonomy to decide what types of foods could be sold in their cafeterias and vending machines. In 2007, the USDA hired the Institute of Medicine (IOM; now the National Academy of Medicine) to develop recommendations for \\"bringing school food up-to-date with current science\\". Dr. Virginia Stallings, a pediatric gastroenterologist at the Children's Hospital of Philadelphia who led the IOM team, concluded, \\"Since the school meal programs were last updated, we've gained the greater understanding of children's nutritional needs and the dietary factors that contribute to obesity, heart disease, and other chronic health problems.\\" In 2010, the Healthy, Hunger-Free Kids Act made the most sweeping changes in the history of the NSLP, putting vending-machine snacks and √† la carte menu items under federal regulation for the first time. Championed by First Lady Michelle Obama and directed by the USDA, the law established guidelines requiring more fruits, vegetables, and whole grains in school meals. The guidelines, which took effect in the 2012‚Äì13 school year, also limited sodium, fat, and caloric intake based on students' ages. Historically, the NSLP and other food programs have been used to improve the health of children who are food-insecure or at risk of malnutrition. More recently, however, the NSLP has made a significant shift to fight childhood obesity as well as malnutrition. Unhealthy eating patterns in overweight children‚Äîlike those in underweight children‚Äîare often tied not only to individual choices, but also to social and economic circumstances such as family income and access to fresh foods. School meal programs provide an avenue by which these socioeconomic circumstances can be targeted to improve children's diets. Most students benefit from the NSLP, even if they do not receive free lunches, because the program also subsidizes full-price meals in the majority of U.S. schools. Organizational structure = National School Lunch Program = The Food and Nutrition Service (FNS), an agency of the USDA, administers the NSLP at the federal level. Within each individual state, the program is administered by a state agency, in most cases the Department of Education. (If state law prevents the state from administering the program, the appropriate FNS regional office may administer it instead.) The state official in charge of the NSLP works with individual school districts to make sure each lunchroom worker receives the necessary information and supplies. Additionally, he or she receives directions from the United States Secretary of Agriculture. School districts that choose to participate in the NSLP follow specific guidelines and receive federal subsidies for each meal they serve. The NSLP has relationships with several other federal agencies and programs. For example, the Fresh Fruit and Vegetable Program, an initiative of the United States Department of Defense (DoD), allows schools to use USDA entitlement dollars to buy fresh produce. The NSLP also works closely with the Temporary Assistance for Needy Families program and the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP). Aside from its impact on public organizations, the NSLP also affects corporate vendors and local businesses. The program is designed to help local farmers by purchasing fresh fruits and vegetables, which make their way to schoolchildren. Additionally, many companies are reformulating their foods to meet federal guidelines so that they can sell their products to the government. =School Breakfast Program= The SBP began as a pilot program in 1966 and became permanent in 1975. It was developed specifically to help impoverished children; the \\"original legislation stipulated that first consideration for program implementation was to be given to schools located in poor areas or in areas where children had to travel a great distance to school\\",\\"Program History.\\" School Breakfast Program. N.p., 21 Feb. 2012. Web. 24 Oct. 2012. . and in 1971, \\"Congress directed that priority consideration for the program would include schools in which there was a special need to improve the nutrition and dietary practices of children of working mothers and children from low-income families\\". The SBP works in essentially the same way as the NSLP: Participating schools receive cash subsidies from the USDA for every meal they serve. They must meet federal nutrition requirements and offer free or reduced-price breakfasts to children who are eligible. The USDA provides technical training and assistance to help school workers prepare and serve healthy meals, as well as nutrition education to help children understand the links between diet and health. In 1970, before it was made permanent, the SBP served 500,000 children. In fiscal year 2011, more than 12.1 million children participated each day, 10.1 million of whom received free or reduced-price breakfasts.  Costs and funding  Both the National School Lunch Program and the School Breakfast Program give cash reimbursements for food served at participating schools. In the 2012‚Äì13 school year, the NSLP provided the following reimbursements for \\"non-severe-need\\" schools: $2.86 for free lunches, $2.46 for reduced-price lunches, $0.27 for paid lunches, $0.78 for free snacks, $0.39 for reduced-price snacks, and $0.07 for paid snacks.\\"The National School Lunch Program.\\" N.p., n.d. Web. 24 Oct. 2012. . (Students eligible for reduced-price meals paid no more than 40 cents per meal.) A school may qualify for higher, \\"severe need\\" reimbursements if 40 percent or more of its lunches were served free or at reduced price in the second preceding year. The SBP provided the following reimbursements in 2012‚Äì13: $1.55 for free breakfasts, $1.25 for reduced-price breakfasts, and $0.27 for paid breakfasts. For fiscal year 2011, the cost of the SBP was $3 billion, compared with $10.8 million in 1970. The cost of the NSLP was $11.1 billion in 2011, compared with $70 million in 1947. Budget trends suggest that meal production costs over the last five years have been increasing faster than revenues. A report by the USDA's Economic Research Service in July 2008 suggested: \\"Cost pressures may be a barrier to improving school menus in some cases. The nationally representative School Lunch and Breakfast Cost Study II found that while the mean reported cost of producing lunch during 2005‚Äì06 was below the reimbursement rate, about one in four school districts reported costs above the reimbursement rate.\\" It continued, \\"Further, the mean full cost of producing a lunch was higher than the reimbursement rate.\\" The study also found that reported costs rose, but full costs fell, from 1992‚Äì2005, reflecting an increase in the number of school food authorities being charged by school districts for indirect costs in response to the districts' own budget pressures (School Nutrition Association, 2006). Other sources of financial pressure include increases in health care costs for employees (GAO, 2003; Woodward-Lopez et al., 2005) and, more recently, rising food costs (FRAC, 2008). In 2012, researchers compared the previous year's data with limited current-year data to see whether previously identified problems persisted. They found that in fiscal year 2011, the NSLP served 5.18 billion lunches at a cost of $11.1 billion, an increase of 181 percent from fiscal year 2000. In terms of cost efficiency, one can compare the costs of NSLP- compliant lunches and lunches served in schools that do not participate in the program. Constance Newman's \\"The Food Costs of Healthier School\\" (2012) compared those costs during the 2005‚Äì06 school year. Newman found that healthy meals were more expensive than meals that did not meet the new nutritional standards. She also found that the \\"mean reported cost for a reimbursement lunch was $2.36, while the reimbursement rate was $2.51\\", or 106 percent of the cost. However, revenues for non-reimbursable meals (for example, adult lunches) covered only 71 percent of the cost of those meals. To address this, the Healthy, Hunger-Free Kids Act of 2010 required gradual increases in reimbursements until 100 percent of costs were covered. In addition, the USDA increased School Food Authority (SFA) reimbursement rates by 6 cents per meal for the 2012‚Äì13 school year. Not all of the cost increases Newman found were due to food prices; nearly half were associated with overhead, such as equipment, labor, and training. Additionally, her research, which relied on data from 2005 and 2006, is now outdated, and Newman acknowledged that \\"another important caveat is that the foods served in schools have changed since 2005\\". Recently, there has been a push to privatize school meal programs because of their rising costs. Private food service companies have much greater purchasing power than school districts and are able to save money by providing fewer benefits and lower salaries to their employees. Participation and eligibility Participation in the NSLP is voluntary. School districts and independent schools that choose to take part receive cash subsidies and donated commodities from the USDA for each meal they serve. In return, they must serve lunches that meet federal nutritional requirements, and they must offer free or reduced-price meals to eligible children. Schools can also be reimbursed for snacks served to children in after-school educational or enrichment programs. In the late 1990s, NSLP officials determined in a \\"Study of Direct Certification in the National School Lunch Program\\" that the program's paper application process was inefficient and potentially excluded eligible school districts (Jackson, Gleason, Hall and Strauss, 2000). As a result, the program switched to a direct certification process, in which schools can use documentation from local or state welfare agencies to demonstrate their eligibility. Despite a lack of cooperation between the NSLP and some welfare agencies, the Food and Nutrition Service (FNS) found that direct certification significantly increased the number of participants. In 2008, Philip Gleason, a senior researcher for Mathematica Policy Research, wrote a paper affirming that direct certification expanded access to the NSLP. However, some researchers have identified an opposite problem: the acceptance into the program of students who are not eligible for it. A three-year study by the FNS (Gleason, 2008) found that 77.5 percent of NSLP applicants were correctly certified. However, 15 percent were certified as eligible when they did not actually qualify, and 7.5 percent were denied benefits despite being eligible. While the amount of erroneous payments during the 2005‚Äì06 school year was relatively small as a percentage of the program's total cost, they totaled more than $759 million (Ponza, 2007). Subsequent research by Molly Dahl found that the problem continued, with an estimated overpayment of $1.5 billion in 2011. David Bass wrote in 2009 that the problem was not simply an innocent one, but involved a calculated effort by school districts to commit fraud. He argued that, because \\"state governments dole out benefits according to free and reduced-price lunch percentages ... local school districts have a clear incentive to register as many students in the NSLP as possible\\". While the NSLP has a built-in verification process, only about 3 percent of applications can be reviewed to verify the reported income. Bass found that some school districts that wanted to verify higher percentages of applications were threatened with legal action from the federal government. He also identified one district that found that 70 percent of the applications it reviewed were incorrect.  Nutritional guidelines  School lunches must meet the applicable recommendations of the Dietary Guidelines for Americans, which state that no more than 30 percent of an individual's calories should come from fat, and no more than 10 percent from saturated fat. School lunches must also provide one-third of the recommended daily allowances of calories, protein, vitamin A, vitamin C, iron, and calcium. However, decisions about what specific foods to serve and how to prepare them are made by local school officials. The 2007 School Nutrition Dietary Assessment Study III, based on research by the USDA during the 2004‚Äì05 school year, found that students in more than 90 percent of schools surveyed had the opportunity to select lunches that met dietary standards for fat and saturated fat. School meal programs are increasingly using more whole grains, fruits and vegetables, lean protein, and low-fat dairy. Efforts such as the Local School Wellness Policies required by the 2004 Child Nutrition and WIC Reauthorization Act have gotten parents, students, and school communities involved in efforts to promote healthy eating and increased physical activity on school campuses. In 2009, the National Academy of Medicine released School Meals: Building Blocks for Healthy Children, which reviewed and recommended updates to the NSLP and SBP nutrition standards and meal requirements. It also set standards for menu planning that focus on food groups, calories, saturated fat, and sodium, and that incorporate the Dietary Guidelines for Americans and the Dietary Reference Intake recommendations.National Academy of Sciences. 2009. School Meals: Building Blocks for Healthy Children. Washington, DC: The National Academies Press. =Unhealthy meals and malnutrition= Unhealthy school lunches contribute to malnutrition in both the short term and the long term. In many cases, unhealthy adult eating patterns can be traced back to unhealthy school lunches, because children learn eating habits from social settings such as school. A 2010 study of 1,003 middle-school students in Michigan found that those who ate school lunches were significantly more likely to be obese than those who did not.Health status and behavior among middle-school children in a midwest community: What are the underpinnings of childhood obesity? Eagle et al. (Dec. 2010) Promoting healthy eating in schools may reduce adolescent obesity by as much as 25 percent. One such effort is the Berkeley Food System, which uses vegetable gardens to promote education on healthy eating. Janet Brown, who started the project, explained that students were more likely to eat healthy foods such as fruits and vegetables when they were better introduced to them.Gardner, Gary, and Brian Halweil. 2000. Escaping Hunger, Escaping Excess. World Watch 13(4):24. In 2008, the Economic Research Service of the USDA issued a report titled \\"The National School Lunch Program: Backgrounds, Trends, and Issues\\", which reaffirmed that one of the main goals of the NSLP, as identified by Congress, is to \\"promote the health and well- being of the Nation‚Äôs children\\". According to the report, new challenges to this goal have emerged with increased scrutiny of high-fat commodities donated by the USDA, such as meat, cheese, and milk. The authors argue that providing high-fat USDA food subsidies contributes to childhood obesity. While NSLP participants have higher intakes of calcium and fiber‚Äînutrients often underconsumed by children‚Äîthey also have higher fat intakes. However, study results comparing weight gain among NSLP participants and nonparticipants are inconclusive. A 2011 article in the Journal of Econometrics, \\"The impact of the National School Lunch Program on child health: A nonparametric bounds analysis\\", affirmed the nutritional advantages of the Healthy, Hunger-Free Kids Act but found that \\"children in households reporting the receipt of free or reduced-price school meals through the National School Lunch Program are more likely to have negative health outcomes than observationally similar nonparticipants\\". The authors asserted that specific groups were not receiving the expected nutritional benefits from the NSLP, and put forth two possible explanations: First, children receiving free or reduced-price meals are likely to differ from their peers in ways that are not reflected in the data. Second, the households of the children most affected by reduced-price lunches may be misreporting participation in the program.  Competitive foods  The USDA report in 2008 identified the emergence of \\"competitive foods\\" as an obstacle to the NSLP's nutritional goals. Competitive foods‚Äîwhich may include items purchased off campus, √† la carte items purchased on campus, products from vending machines, food purchased for school fundraising, food available at school parties, and treats given to students by teachers‚Äîare not included in the NSLP reimbursement plan and so are not required to meet USDA standards. Generally speaking, competitive foods are lower in key nutrients and higher in fat than NSLP-reimbursable meals. The availability of such foods in schools often undermines the nutritional goals of the NSLP. The study recommended that nutritional standards be applied to all food served or sold in schools. In addition, it noted that the Government Accountability Office (GAO) recommended in 2005 that the USDA's authority to regulate \\"foods of minimal nutritional value\\" be extended to a wider class of foods. =Obesity= Research has shown that 36 percent of participants in reduced-price lunch programs are food- insecure and 19 percent are obese. Studies comparing NSLP participants and nonparticipants have been inconclusive on whether weight gain rates differ between the two groups. The 2008 Economic Research Service study found \\"similar calorie intakes for participants and nonparticipants but higher fat and sodium intakes for participants\\". The most obvious challenge to efforts to address such problems is that even if more nutritious foods are provided, there is no guarantee that students will eat them. Additionally, the NSLP does not take into account the physiological differences among participants: Some children are smaller than others, some are more athletic, and some have metabolisms that require more calories than the NSLP allows. Three ideas have been proposed to address obesity in schools: * Expose students only to fruits and vegetables as snacks. A 2009 Journal of Nutrition study, \\"Restricting Snacks in U.S. Elementary Schools Is Associated with Higher Frequency of Fruit and Vegetable Consumption\\", found that \\"children in schools with restricted snack availability had significantly higher frequency of fruit and vegetable consumption than children in schools without restricted snack availability\\", and suggested that a restrictive snack policy should be part of a multifaceted approach to improve children's diets. * Educate all students about nutrition. A 2007 American Journal of Clinical Nutrition article, \\"APPLE project: 2-y findings of a community-based obesity prevention program in primary school-age children\\", stated, \\"A relatively simple approach, providing activity coordinators and basic nutrition education in schools, significantly reduces the rate of excessive weight gain in children.\\" * Encourage healthier meal selection without restricting choices. Researchers at Cornell University have suggested techniques based on behavioral economics, such as placing white milk in front of chocolate milk in coolers, moving and highlighting fruit displays, and using appealing names for vegetables to improve palatability. School Nutrition and Childhood Obesity The federal government became involved with school meals in the 1940s, responding to concerns that many children were not getting enough to eat. According to military officials at the time, a large number of young men in the United States were not fit for active duty because of undernourishment. In 1946, President Harry Truman (D, 1945‚Äì53) signed the National School Lunch Act into law, providing free school lunches for low- income students. In 1966, the Child Nutrition Act shifted control of the school lunch program from a number of government agencies to one, the USDA.Junk Food in Schools: Should schools restrict the sale of junk food?\\" (2007, March 23). Retrieved from http://0-icof.infobaselearning.com.libcat.sanjac.edu/recordurl.aspx?ID=2379. In the decades since then, childhood weight gain has become a major concern of health experts, as the percentage of children who are overweight has been increasing. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), for instance, the percentage of overweight children between the ages of six and 11 in 2003-04 was more than double that of the late 1970s. As the number of overweight and obese students increased, the focus of school nutrition shifted from its original concern‚Äîmaking sure that students had enough to eat‚Äîto its more recent preoccupation with preventing weight gain. In 1994, President Bill Clinton (1993-2001) signed the Child Nutrition Reauthorization Bill, which required schools to set limits on the fat content of school lunches. According to a 2001 USDA report, lunches became significantly healthier in the years after the law passed. However, the report also found that, besides lunches, less-healthy competitive foods were available in many schools, and that those options sometimes provided an incentive for students to skip school lunch altogether. Competitive foods have presented an obstacle to the USDA's regulation of food in schools. In 1983, a federal court overturned a USDA regulation that had prohibited the sale of junk food in schools from the beginning of the school day until the end of the last meal period. The court ruled that the USDA could ban junk food in cafeterias only during mealtimes. The USDA does place some restrictions on competitive foods, requiring them to contain at least 5 percent of the recommended daily allowance of a number of specific nutrients, including protein and certain vitamins. But those restrictions have drawn criticism for not limiting foods with ingredients that can be unhealthy, such as sugar, fat, and salt, or those exceeding a certain number of calories. As a result, schools cannot sell chewing gum or breath mints, for instance, because they do not contain the required nutrients, but can sell candy bars and french fries, because they do‚Äîeven though they also contain large amounts of sugar and fat, respectively. Outcomes =Educational attainment= Studies have shown a positive correlation between school meal programs and increased food security. Among low-income children, the marginal food insecurity rate of those with access to the School Breakfast Program is lower than that of those children without access to the program. This increase in food security has not been shown to have significant long-term health benefits, but it does have a positive impact on education. Subsidized lunches appear to encourage children to attend school, and to free up food at home for other family members to consume. Public-policy researchers at Georgetown University found in 2010 that \\"increasing NSLP exposure by ten percentage points results in an average increase in education of .365 years\\" for girls, and \\"increases average education by nearly a year\\" for boys. The researchers found that participation in grades seven through twelve \\"has a stronger effect on educational attainment than participating in the earlier grades does, whereas there is some evidence suggesting that participation in earlier grades is more important for the health outcomes\\". =Student reactions= An article in The Wilson Quarterly in 2011 described the impact of the NSLP in the Maplewood‚ÄìRichmond Heights School District in the St. Louis suburbs, where participation in the program is increasing. Linda Henke, the superintendent of the school district, said: \\"I was struck by the positive vibe around the revamped program. A teacher said he'd lost seven pounds by eating in the high school cafeteria every school day for the previous three months. A senior girl who had embraced the changes from the beginning observed that even she was surprised when football players started eating salads. The elementary school's cook of 14 years told me her job is now harder, but it‚Äôs rewarding.\\" The article continued: \\"It takes a tough-minded school leader to assert that nutrient-rich food is the right choice for kids‚Äîand that it's an appropriate use of government dollars. Kids will complain initially but will come around. And a number of collateral benefits follow when students eat well. Anecdotal reports from schools with healthful and flavorful food indicate that teachers have started eating with students, attendance rates are higher, and fewer students fall asleep in class or commit vandalism and violence at school.\\" Another article examined the program's effects within the Los Angeles Unified School District. The district's food service director, David Binkle, said: \\"From what I see and what I hear now that students are getting used to [the new menus] and they have tasted it, they like it. Any time you make a change, and the major change like this, that's an evolution that we have to go through. There's going to be people now saying the meal is too healthy for the kids and it's stuff they don't know. The reality of this is the rest of the country is about to see what we've gone through [when they adopt the new meal pattern regulations]. We did this on purpose so that we could really get out ahead of this and start to work through it and adjust. I think the rest of the country is going to see a lot of the same impact [that we've seen this year].\\" Binkle added, \\"What I keep hearing from the principals is that as we keep tweaking and teaching and encouraging the kids, more and more kids are participating.\\" Research overwhelmingly shows an upward trend in NSLP participation. However, the Wilson Quarterly article described a challenge: \\"Since 2004, the USDA has administered the HealthierUS School Challenge, awarding distinction but no money, to schools that voluntarily improve the healthfulness of their meals. By last fall, only a paltry 841 of the 101,000 schools in the NSLP (less than one percent) had received awards. That leaves a lot of schools that are still promoting Tater Tot Day and reheating frozen pizzas.\\" The HealthierUS School Challenge (HUSSC) is a voluntary certification initiative recognizing schools that have created healthier environments by promoting nutrition and physical activity. Schools that apply may be awarded HUSSC certification and monetary incentives. As of March 11, 2014, there were 6,706 schools certified, which is 6 percent of the schools participating in the NSLP.

The 14-story building had 240 guest rooms and 216,000 square feet of space.\\"Claridge Hotel in Times Square is Acquired by Douglas Leigh\\". The New York Times, May 21, 1964. p. 57. It operated for 61 years until the building was demolished in 1972. History Typical floor plan of the hotel The Hotel Rector was established by George Rector as a complement to his popular restaurant, which had been founded by his father and was frequented by New York's rich and famous, including Diamond Jim Brady and Cornelius Vanderbilt III. The timing of his new venture was unfortunate, because as the hotel was being developed, a popular Broadway play was released, called The Girl from Rector's. The play was considered indecent by many critics and gave the Rector's name an unsavory reputation. Rector held the play responsible when he declared his new hotel bankrupt in May 1913. The new owners wanted a new name to escape the stigma, so the Hotel Rector became the Hotel Claridge in 1913. The new name evoked the exclusive Claridge's of London. Although they were no longer using the old name, the new management refused to allow use of the Rector's brand for another restaurant. Rector successfully sued to regain use of his own name. The celebrated smoking Camel cigarette billboard in Times Square was designed by Douglas Leigh and mounted on the Hotel Claridge. (Photo, 1948) The American Society of Composers, Authors and Publishers (ASCAP) was founded at the Hotel Claridge on February 13, 1914. In 1923, the hotel was purchased by real estate investor Benjamin Winter, Sr. for $3 million. In May 1964 it was bought by Douglas Leigh Inc. for an unspecified sum. Leigh indicated he would turn the hotel into a commercial building, with stores, a restaurant and exhibit space on the lower floors and showrooms, offices and meeting rooms on the upper floors. One of the most enduring images of Times Square is the ‚ÄúCamel Man‚Äù, who blew cigarette smoke rings around the clock from 1941 to 1966 from a billboard mounted on the Hotel Claridge.McKendry, Joe (2012), One Times Square: A Century of Change at the Crossroads of the World, Boston: David R.

National General Corporation based their eastern operations in the building and also incorporated a movie theater into the building, the first new movie theater in Times Square for more than 30 years, which opened December 12, 1972 with the premiere of The Poseidon Adventure. The theater added an additional screen in 1982 and closed in 1998. The first and second floors are currently occupied by ABC's Times Square Studios, home to the \\"Good Morning America\\" television program.

The party was formed in 1896 but due to repression by the German police and local Prussian authorities, it did not adopt an official program until 1898. The party was formed in response to, and was focused on opposing the policy of forced Germanization pursued by the Prussian authorities with regards to the Polish-speaking population of the region. Founding The party was established in November 1896 by the publicist Karol Bahrke from Warsaw and the poet Micha≈Ç Kajka in E≈Çk (Lyck). Its founding had been initiated by the \\"Central Committee for Silesia, Kaszubia and Masuria\\" () in Warsaw led by Antoni Osuchowski and Juliusz Bursche; the committee supported the foundation of the party financially and institutionally. Other notable founder members included the agrarian peasant activists Bogumi≈Ç Labusz and Gustaw Leyding. The first meeting of the founders at the house of Bahrke, on November 8, 1896, was dispersed by German police. However, before this occurred the delegates had managed to form a 30-member electoral committee. The program of the party was not approved until January 25, 1898. Program The party was centrist in nature and drew most of its support from Masurian Polish speaking peasants. The main points of its program concentrated on the protection of the Polish language in Masuria, opposition to Germanization, as well as ensuring freedom of religion (the party included both Catholics and Protestants). The program also focused on agrarian issues, including land reform, increased spending on rural infrastructure and progressive taxation. In Ortelsburg (Szczytno), the town considered the party's heartland, the Masurian People's Party had 30 members in 1907. Andreas Kossert estimated there were a few hundred members in all of Masuria at most. Political and cultural activity The official organ of the party was the newspaper Gazeta Ludowa, whose chief editor was Bahrke. The newspaper was subsidized by Polish banks from Greater Poland and most of the 2,500 copies (1897) were distributed free of charge. Gazeta Ludowa stopped being published in 1902. Another newspaper, Mazur, was published from 1906 on in Ortelsburg (Szczytno) where Marcin Biedermann, a Polish banker from Poznan, acquired a printer. The number of copies, again distributed free of charge, rose from 500 in 1908 to 2,000 before the start of World War I. Election results In the 1898 German federal election, Bahrke received 229 out of 17,832 votes in the district of Oletzko-Lyck-Johannisburg (Olecko-E≈Çk-Pisz). Eugen Zenon Lewandowski, the candidate in the Ortelsburg-Sensburg (Szczytno-Mragowo) district received 5,874 votes, around a third of the total. He had also been supported by the German Free-minded People's Party with about 4,000 votes. In the 1903 German federal election, Lewandowski received about 4,000 votes, Bogumi≈Ç Labusz, who replaced Bahrke as a candidate received only 130. The number of votes dropped further to 1,451 in the 1907 German federal elections, when the candidates of the German Conservative Party were elected with 93.1% (Oletzko-Lyck-Johannisburg) and 73.1% (Ortelsburg-Sensburg) of the vote, and slightly increased to 2,698 in 1912.Andreas Kossert: \\"Wilhelminische Ostmarkenpolitik als infrastrukturelle Durchdringung?

North Korea and Russia have used the rank in that fashion throughout their histories. The rank is also closely associated with Germany, where Generaloberst has formerly been a higher rank above full General but below Generalfeldmarschall. Austria Gorget patch Colonel general (Generaloberst) was the second-highest rank in the Austro-Hungarian Army, introduced following the German model in 1915. The rank was not used after World War I in the Austrian Army of the Republic.  People's Republic of China  The People's Liberation Army had a rank of Da Jiang () from 1955 to 1965. Da Jiang corresponded to the Soviet rank of colonel general. The rank system of the People's Liberation Army was abolished in 1965 and restored in 1988. The 1988 system introduced a rank of Yi Ji Shang Jiang (). No one had held such rank and it was abolished in 1994.

Currently, one person is currently living. He is Sonomyn Luvsangombo. Also he was a Minister of Social Security of the Mongolian People's Republic.  Czechoslovakia  30px The rank of colonel general (gener√°lplukovn√≠k) was created in the Czechoslovak army in 1950; it was dropped after the 1993 dissolution of the state. Egypt right The Egyptian Army uses a rank that translates as \\"colonel general\\". It is equal to the rank of 4-star or \\"full\\" general. Colonel general is, however, junior to the rank of field marshal and is an honorary distinction usually held only by defense ministers. France In the French Army, under the Ancien r√©gime, the officer in nominal command of all the regiments of a particular branch of service (i. e. infantry, cavalry, dragoons, Swiss troops, etc.) was known as the colonel general. This was not a rank, but an office of the Crown. Georgia The Republic of Georgia adopted Soviet designations after its independence in 1991 so that the rank of colonel-general (·Éí·Éî·Éú·Éî·É†·Éê·Éö-·Éû·Éù·Éö·Éô·Éù·Éï·Éú·Éò·Éô·Éò general-polkovniki) exists, yet it is only used as highest possible rank in the Ministry of Internal Affairs. Germany The equivalent German four-star ranks (OF-9) of the Wehrmacht of Nazi Germany were Generaloberst and Generaladmiral. Generaloberst was also used as the title of the three-star rank (OF-8) of the National People's Army of East Germany until German reunification in 1990. However, the Bundeswehr (first in West Germany and since 1990 in a unified Germany) does not use the rank. ;Rank insignia Generaloberst KHeer OF9 GenOberst (Bayern) 1918.gifGerman Imperial Army (OF-9) until 1918 WMacht A OF9-Generaloberst 1945.gifWehrmacht, Heer (OF-9) until 1945 Wehrmach Lw Generaloberst2 1945.jpg...

In Hungary, the rank of colonel general (vez√©rezredes) was introduced to the Imperial and Royal Army (the common ground force of the Dual Monarchy) in 1915. The rank replaced the ranks of gyalogs√°gi t√°bornok (general of infantry), lovass√°gi t√°bornok (general of cavalry), and t√°borszernagy (general of artillery) in the early 1940s. The rank title vez√©rezredes is still in use for the highest ranking (four-star) general officers of the Hungarian Defence Forces () and foreign four-star general officers' rank titles are usually translated as vez√©rezredes in Hungarian, including Commonwealth air forces' Air Chief Marshals. Iraq The equivalent rank for Colonel general in Iraq is called \\"Ferik Awwal\\", in Arabic \\"ŸÅÿ±ŸäŸÇ ÿ£ŸàŸÑ\\", which is considered the highest rank in Iraqi Army nowadays. North Korea NKPA Colonel General rank insignia The North Korean rank of sangjang translates as \\"colonel general\\". Sangjang is senior to that of jungjang (usually translated as \\"lieutenant general\\") and junior to that of daejang (usually translated as \\"general\\"). This rank is typically held by the commanding officer of units along the Korean DMZ and the North Korean security zone at Panmunjom. It is also the rank held by the KPA Pyongyang Defense Command's commanding general. Russia The rank of colonel general () did not exist in Imperial Russia and was first established in the Red Army on 7 May 1940, as a replacement for the previously existing (, \\"army commander of the second rank\\"). During World War II, about 199 officers were promoted to colonel general. Before 1943, Soviet colonel generals wore four stars on their collar patches (). Since 1943, they have worn three stars on their shoulder straps, so Charles Pettibone compares the rank to the US lieutenant general. The rank still exists in the contemporary Russian Army and Air Force. Unlike the German (which it most probably calqued), the Soviet and Russian colonel general rank is neither an exceptional nor a rare one, as it is a normal step in the \\"ladder\\" between a two-star lieutenant general and a four-star army general. Other than that, the Soviet and Russian rank systems sometimes cause confusion in regard to equivalence of ranks, because the normal Western title for brigadier or brigadier general ceased to exist for the Russian Army in 1798. The combrig rank that corresponded to one-star general only existed in the Soviet Union during 1935‚Äì1940. Positions typically reserved for these ranks, such as brigade commanders, have always been occupied by colonels () or, very rarely, major generals (see History of Russian military ranks). The rank has usually been given to district, front and army commanders, and also to deputy ministers of defense, deputy heads of the general staff and so on. In some post-Soviet Commonwealth of Independent States armies (for example in Belarus), there are no generals of the army or marshals, and so colonel general is the highest rank, usually held by the minister of the defense. The corresponding naval rank is admiral, which is also denoted by three stars. Sweden Colonel general (general√∂verste) has also been a senior military rank in Sweden, used principally before the 19th century. Syria The Syrian Arab Army uses the rank of colonel general ( \\"Imad-awwalÿπŸÖÿßÿØ ÿ£ŸàŸÑ) only for the senior-most rank of the army beneath that of field marshal. Usually, only defence ministers have held this rank - only six officers have held this rank till now - Hafez al-Assad, Mustafa Tlass, Hikmat al-Shihabi, Ali Habib Mahmud, Dawoud Rajiha and Fahd Jassem al-Freij. United Kingdom The title of colonel general was used before and during the English Civil War in both Royalist and Parliamentarian armies. In these cases, it often appears to have meant a senior colonel as opposed to a senior general.  United States  In the United States, as commander of an army, the equivalent rank was general (four-star general, grade O-10). Vietnam People's Army of Vietnam Colonel General rank insignia In Vietnam, the rank of colonel general is known as Th∆∞·ª£ng T∆∞·ªõng (literally \\"upper general\\"). It is a three-star rank (OF-9a) in the Ground Force and Air Force. Th∆∞·ª£ng T∆∞·ªõng is senior to Trung T∆∞·ªõng (usually translated as \\"lieutenant general\\") and junior to ƒê·∫°i T∆∞·ªõng (usually translated as \\"general\\").

First broadcast on 24 January 1978 on BBC 1, it was originally screened as part of the Play for Today series. Set against the backdrop of Silver Jubilee of Elizabeth II, the play depicts a single mother's struggles as welfare cuts affect the poor and disabled. The derogatory term 'spongers' is used by British tabloid press to describe people who are dependent on welfare support, however the play presents the case of a family who really need the help of welfare support. The title sequence shows the title of the play, 'The Spongers', superimposed over a picture of Queen Elizabeth II and Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh, denoting them as 'the real spongers' as Royal finances are paid by British taxpayers. For example, the Queen's official expenditure increased by ¬£200,000 from ¬£32.1m in 2010-11 to ¬£32.3m in 2011-12. Plot Pauline (Christine Hargreaves), a recently separated single mother-of-four, receives a visit from a bailiff regarding her rent arrears. She is given 15 days to address the issue, yet the bailiff values Pauline's furniture and possessions. This upsets Pauline's daughter, Paula, who has Down's syndrome, and she is comforted by her Auntie Gertie. Meanwhile nearby, Councillor Conway (Bernard Atha) watches preparations for Jubilee celebrations. Community action worker Sullivan (Bernard Hill) drives Pauline and Paula past the preparations for the Jubilee on the way to a dedicated home for special needs children. Paula expresses excitement about the Jubilee celebrations. As Pauline settles back into her care home, a meeting of the Labour-controlled council is being run. Conway is confronted over public expenditure cuts. The following day, Pauline tries to sort out her arrears problems at the DHSS, but is refused exceptional needs payments because of her previous grants, electricity arrears, and because she spent her rent allowance on food. The staff at the DHSS suggest she should have used a food coupon, however Pauline says she would have felt embarrassed to use the coupon in the shops as she feared others might think she doesn't spend money on the children when in fact she does - it's just that there is little money to spare. Later, Pauline's small donation to a Jubilee collection angers her cousin Jackie (Angela Catherall) because of the system's unfair treatment of Pauline. At the local council meeting, it is revealed that the local government is facing demands for expenditure cuts. In a meeting, councillors review and compare the annual cost of people in residential care (¬£1,100-¬£3,800) with community care (¬£27-¬£105). The priorities of the local government are revealed when Conway vetoes a reduction in elderly bus passes, as the elderly are more likely to lobby against the decision. Despite the evidence showing that cost for the mentally handicapped in residential care is substantial, Conway approves the cuts to this service, denying that the mentally handicapped will suffer. As Paula and other children happily re-enact the Queen's Coronation at her care home, the council agree to cut these services. Paula is then transferred to an old people's home. As she is the only child there, she has no other children to play with. Instead, she mainly sits silently with elderly people, and her mental state deteriorates. On a visit to the old people's home, Pauline and her father (Peter Kerrigan) complain. Pauline's father doubts that Pauline's social worker, Mrs Johnson (Elaine Lindsay) is committed to help. Inspired, Mrs Johnson then raises Paula's case with her boss, but he blames her inexperience and accuses her of becoming too emotionally involved. He instead suggests that she should help Pauline accept her situation, rather than fight it. Taking heed of her boss's suggestion, she is absent at independent hearing for Pauline's appeal against the exceptional needs refusal. Instead, Pauline's father tries to help Pauline's case. He states that Pauline was married for 16 years, and that her husband had left one year ago, and that prior to marriage Pauline worked as a machinist in a textiles factory. He points out that it is only recently that Pauline has needed help, and as a survivor of 1930's poverty, he did not believe Britain would return to similar circumstances after 1945. The tribunal advises Pauline to accept rent deductions. Upholding the decision, the chair believes husbands leave families just to get their debts covered by supplementary benefit, and wants to discourage them. Meanwhile, Paula becomes upset at the home. Pauline, helped by Sullivan, decides to see the Director of Social Services at her local council about Paula's case. The director is unavailable, and Pauline and Sullivan see a representative who defends moving Paula because she is nearer to her hometown. Pauline stresses that Paula needs special care and facilities. Her only alternative is to withdraw Paula and take her home. The representative cannot discuss policy decisions, and Sullivan thinks such officials are themselves bottom of the pile. He tells Pauline to stop blaming herself as the system makes the poor feel inadequate or wicked. Paula's doctor says he was not consulted and fears the home will make Paula regress into disturbance and epileptic fits. Pauline becomes depressed. The bailiff takes her furniture, complaining that she has not removed personal effects. Gertie and Jackie take Pauline to a club, where Gertie sings and performs comedy. Sullivan and Pauline's father discuss how the system turns worker against worker, and how the stigma of welfare leads to ¬£600 million being unclaimed. Pauline's dad sees himself as a parasite. Conway visits the club and Sullivan approaches him. Conway investigates Pauline's case but nothing changes. He tells Sullivan that pushing it would harm his relationship with officers. Conway denies that decisions were motivated by Government-dictated financial restraint. Sullivan aggressively denies Conway's claim that Paula's transfer was in the child's interest: he thinks councils target the mentally handicapped for cuts because they cannot fight back. Mocking Sullivan's utopianism, Conway claims that the only way to be a socialist is to face realistic facts. Pauline takes Paula home, getting the stronger tablets that Paula has needed while there. The social worker gives discouraging news about Paula's future accommodation. Street parties mark the Jubilee, with Paula involved in a tug-of-war. At night, Pauline puts tablets in drinks she serves to herself and the children, including the baby. Next day, their dead bodies are removed. Some neighbours think Pauline should have fought like everyone else. Sullivan looks on, shocked.

The play was also Roland Joff√©‚Äôs first single directing credit for television; before this he was an experienced theatre director. However, Joff√© had been blacklisted: the play's producer, Tony Garnett, was informed that MI5 files listed Joff√© as a \\"security risk\\" due to his left wing views. Only after Garnett threatened he would \\"go public\\", was the veto on Joff√©'s appointment withdrawn./ Garnett ensured that Joff√©, as a new director, would be surrounded by a very experienced crew, stating in a 2012 interview that he \\"gave him a very good, very experienced director of photography, and a very good, very experienced editor. Whenever you work with a new director, you must surround them with very experienced people. I was very pleased with Roland, I threw him in the deep end and he swam.\\"As stated in an interview conducted by Jacob Mason on 18 January 2012. Tony Garnett‚Äôs efforts to achieve authenticity were also rooted further into other aspects of production, such as casting: \\"I spent months and months on casting. You‚Äôve got to get that absolutely right. If you want to be lazy nowadays, you get your actors off Spotlight. What I did, and I would recommend this to anyone, is to go out there and find your actors. I must have spent... two, two or three months on casting.\\" The decision to cast Northern actors to play Northern roles was deliberate: \\"it had veracity but also had its logical implications.\\" Garnett drew on his past experience as an actor before he became a story editor on The Wednesday Play: \\"how can you get a Southern Tory actor to play a Northerner who spends his life down the pits? Or a Southern actress to play a shop girl?\\" Once cast, it was strongly suggested that actors research their roles. \\"With actors like Bernard [Atha, who plays Councillor Conway], casting him as the councillor when he is, in fact, a real councillor in Leeds, seemed very logical to me. His job as councillor comes as second nature to him, so he wasn‚Äôt particularly bogged down with his character‚Äôs actions.\\" Therefore, Atha was able to give a very natural, realistic performance. Christine Hargreaves, who plays Pauline, spent some time living with her on-screen children to develop a bond that \\"would appear second-nature\\" on screen. \\"Christine was brilliant; a lovely, very honest woman. She was great with the kids. She would go out into the community where we filmed, making herself known to the locals, and integrate as much as possible.\\" Improvisation played an important part in casting, and in the final takes of scenes in the play. Garnett would encourage actors to improvise more and more during each take of the scene. He felt that actors would often hide behind their scripts, and their deliverance would often be too constructed: ‚ÄòI wanted to expose the actors instead. I wanted them to feel in the moment of the scene and to give realistic beats and responses.' Such improvisation was often disapproved of by Jim Allen; \\"Jim felt very insecure about improvisation. I would often have to take him on long walks on location to calm him down, as actors weren‚Äôt saying his lines word-for-word. He didn‚Äôt understand the filming process very much, so he found it very difficult.\\" This viewpoint was also expressed by Jim Allen in a letter he wrote to Jimmy McGovern; McGovern had written to Allen, requesting he appear on a proposed Channel 4 documentary about working class writers. The programme was never made. Nevertheless, Allen replied with a brief outline of how he works as a writer: \\"Just for the record, it isn‚Äôt true that I only write down ideas then allow actors to ad lib. It‚Äôs the director who ‚Äì with my consent ‚Äì lets actors improvise. Some like Roland Joff√© with The Spongers and United Kingdom perhaps go a bit to [sic] far, but Ken Loach, with whom I‚Äôve made six films, first allows the actor to speak the lines ‚Äì and then ad lib. But every line, every cough and every spit is written down first ‚Äì I‚Äôm not making a song and dance about this, Jimmy, but it‚Äôs as well to get it right.\\"The Working Class Movement Library Archives: Jim Allen; JA11/1, File of correspondence 1978-1996; JA11/1, Letters. Critical reception The play received several awards, including the prestigious Prix Italia. There were mostly positive reviews from the press for its distanced naturalism and avoidance of didacticism which 'for some reviewers, made it the masterpiece of that period's socially-concerned drama documentaries.' British nostalgia website, TV Cream, describes the play as 'one of the most powerful dramas the BBC, or anyone, have shown, and as such presents the strongest possible case for the \\"naturalism\\" that many Play for Today writers were determined to get away from. The ensemble playing is brilliantly done, with interruptions and improvised stutters giving a documentary feel that, while grossly overused (even misused) these days, is wholly convincing here.' TV Writer Jimmy McGovern describes the play as 'the best television programme ever made', and cites Jim Allen as his biggest influence. Actor Christopher Eccleston also cites the play as 'one of the greatest dramas I've ever seen.' Unmade follow up Jim Allen planned a two-part follow up to The Spongers, titled The Commune, which was to be set in the same location - Middleton, Greater Manchester, on the impoverished Langley Estate. The drama was to provide a more hopeful outlook for the community than Pauline's story, and would feature residents taking control of running the estate from the local authorities. However, due to Kenith Trodd's production company, Pennies from Heaven Productions and London Weekend Television's spiralling budgets of a trilogy of Dennis Potter plays, this project was shelved.' However, Jim Allen and Kenith Trodd did make a similar story to The Commune, titled United Kingdom, which was also directed by Roland Joff√© and was shown in the Play for Today strand on BBC1. Andy Willis, of BFI Screenonline, describes United Kingdom as 'one of the last hurrahs of the strain of committed political drama that had thrived, particularly at the BBC, during the 1960s and 1970s. Ambitious in both scope and length and fiercely anti-government - though its early drafts were written before the 1979 Conservative election victory - it represented the kind of drama that BBC managers would find difficult to defend in the face of constrained budgets and political pressure.'

Weltmer claimed his method could cure disease through suggestions and hypnosis, a practice he referred to as \\"magnetic healing\\". Early life Weltmer was a native of Wooster, Ohio. At the age of seven, his parents moved to Morgan County, Missouri, where he attended the public schools. He studied borrowed medical books in hopes of becoming a physician, and studied as an apprentice with a doctor. Later he devoted himself to the study of the Bible, seeking its wisdom on spiritual healing.  Career  Weltmer was ordained and licensed to preach as a Baptist minister at 19 years old. He served as a preacher in several places. In 1885 he founded a private educational institution at Aikinsville, Missouri, an unincorporated community in Morgan County. He presided over and directed the Akinsville Normal School from 1885 to 1889, to train teachers for elementary schools. The school disbanded in 1889. In Sedalia, Missouri, he established and organized a public library and was librarian from 1893 until 1895. For two years he also served as a professor in Robbins Business College in that city. Personal life S. A. Weltmer home, 1903 On October 8, 1879, Weltmer married Mary Genoa (Adair) Stone. They had five children together: Ernest, Silas W., Stella, Tracy, and Beulah. Weltmer was involved in Nevada in several of the fraternal and civic associations that developed in the late 19th century: he was a Knights Templar (Freemasonry) and Thirty-second Degree Mason, an Elk, an Odd Fellow, a Knight of Pythias, and an initiate in the fourth degree of Atlantian Mystics, although he was not yet bound by oath. Weltmer died in Nevada, Vernon County, Missouri on December 6, 1930 and was buried there.  Weltmer Institute  Sidney A. Weltmer in the 1920s Weltmer took a partner, Joseph H. Kelly from Sedalia, teaching him the principles of what he called his \\"science\\". Together they founded the firm of Weltmer & Kelly in Nevada, Missouri on February 19, 1897, and began to give sessions. As the number of attendees increased, they bought a building to suit them, providing rooms for patients and also space for their classes in the thought transference and \\"magnetic healing\\" that Weltmer promoted. They opened this facility, known as the American School of Magnetic Healing, on July 1, 1898. Weltmer served as president and Kelly as secretary and treasurer. Within a few years so many patients were attracted from a wide area that the railroad added trains to its schedules to support this business. Weltmer asserted that a combination of clairvoyance and hypnotic suggestion could cure diseases such as asthma, tobacco addiction and insanity. A ten-day course cost $100. In addition to holding lectures in an auditorium that could seat several hundred people, he published numerous tracts about his system and attracted an increasing number of patients, up to hundreds per day. He and Kelly trained more assistants and numerous stenographers were hired for the mail order business of classes by mail. By 1903 the Institute had claimed to reach 75,000 patients, curing most. Members of the medical community widely condemned Weltmer, charging him with being a fraudster. Dr. Prenton W. Pope wrote \\"The Expose of Weltmerism: Magnetic Healing De-magnetized,\\" a 1900 review in The Sanitarian, published by the Medico-Legal Society of New York. He described Weltmerism as an \\"anti- Christian method\\" devoted to \\"chicanery and money-getting.\\" Dr. E. L. Priest from the Missouri Medical Association denounced the Weltmer Institute. Pastor Dr. Charles M. Bishop, from the Centenary Methodist Church, published his negative reviews in the Christian Advocate, published in St. Louis, Missouri. In 1900, the US Postmaster General declared Weltmer's \\"healing by mail\\" scheme a fraud and stopped mail delivery to the institute. Weltmer filed suit to challenge this action, and the case eventually reached the U.S. Supreme Court. It ruled on November 17, 1902 that Weltmer had the right as a citizen to receive mail at his business, regardless of whether people agreed with it. According to a 2004 newspaper article about the building and institute, Weltmer's Institute generated so much mail that the government built a new post office to accommodate the volume going into and out of the town. Weltmer traveled to Washington, DC during the course of this case, to track its progress at the Court and to attend to his clients among members of the US Senate and their wives. Also in the early 20th century, Weltmer filed a libel case against Rev. M. Bishop for calling Weltmer and his assistants \\"miserable charlatans\\" in print; it eventually reached the Supreme Court of Missouri. That court ruled in favor of Bishop and refused a motion to rehear the case. It based its ruling on the facts of one of Weltmer's clients, a woman who claimed to have been cured of breast cancer by letters from Weltmer. She said he instructed her that each of them was to focus on healing thoughts at a time and dates which he established by letter. In fact, during this period of claimed treatment, Weltmer was vacationing in Colorado, and his purported letters were prepared and sent by clerks of the institute. Weltmer's Institute contributed to Nevada becoming the center of a wellness industry. His system was often compared to Christian Science, a type of spiritual healing which medical practitioners also criticized. Psychotherapists, clairvoyants and persons promising various miracle cures of contemporary illnesses, such as tuberculosis, which then had no cure, also came to work in Nevada. At one time the Institute was staffed with \\"17 healers, several assistant healers, a physician, and more than 110 stenographers and female typists to handle the correspondence.\\" After Weltmer's death in 1930, his eldest son Ernest tried to keep the Institute going. He was unsuccessful and closed it in 1933 during the Great Depression. The building was sold and used as a funeral home into 2004. Some residents felt it should have been designated as a historic property, considering Weltmer's influence on the town. Despite some local objections, the city council was preparing to allow the property to be redeveloped and a video store to be built on the site.

The book follows protagonist Teoh Yun Ling, who was a prisoner of the Japanese during the World War II, and later became a judge overseeing war crimes cases. Seeking after the war to create a garden in memory of her sister, who was imprisoned with her but did not survive, she ends up serving as an apprentice to a Japanese gardener in Cameron Highlands for several months. As the story begins, years later, she is trying to make sense of her life and experiences. The novel takes place during three different time periods: the late 1980s, when the main character returns to the Japanese garden, Yugiri, of her apprenticeship and begins to write her memoir; the early 1950s, when the main events of the novel took place; and World War II, which provides the backdrop for the story. Critical reception for the book was generally favourable. It was shortlisted for the Booker Prize, and awarded the Man Asian Literary Prize and the Walter Scott Prize for Historical Fiction. It was adapted into a feature film that was released in 2019.  Synopsis  Newly retired Supreme Court Judge Teoh Yun Ling returns to the Cameron Highlands of Malaya, where she had spent a few months as an apprentice to the Japanese gardener she had hoped would design a memorial garden for her sister, Teoh Yun Hong. Oncoming aphasia is forcing Yun Ling to deal with unsettled business from her past while she is still able to remember. The gardener, Nakamura Aritomo, had been the Japanese Emperor's gardener, but relocated to Malaya after a falling-out and spent years designing and building his own garden there, named Yugiri. He disappeared without a trace in the highland mountains some years prior to Yun Ling's return. Reliving her memories of Aritomo and her time there, Yun Ling begins writing her memoir, and meets with Japanese professor, Yoshikawa Tatsuji, who is writing a book about the life and works of Aritomo. During the Japanese occupation of Malaya, Yun Ling and her older sister Yun Hong were imprisoned in a Japanese civilian internment camp where Yun Hong was forced to become a \\"comfort woman\\" for Japanese soldiers. Yun Hong perishes in the chaos and violence of the end of the occupation, and after the war, Yun Ling wants to fulfill a promise she made to her sister: to build a Japanese garden at their home in Kuala Lumpur. She travels to the highlands to visit old family friend Magnus Pretorius, an expatriate South African tea farmer whose tea farm bordered Aritomo's garden, and to seek an audience with Aritomo. Aritomo refuses to design the garden Yun Ling wants to build, but unexpectedly proposes to take her on as an apprentice, so that she can later design and build her sister's memorial garden herself. Despite her bitter attitude toward the Japanese, Yun Ling agrees to the apprenticeship. Eventually, she and Aritomo become lovers. During Yun Ling's conversations with Tatsuji, during her return to Yugiri years later, it comes out that Aritomo was involved in a covert Japanese program during the war to hide looted treasures from occupied territories. The rumours of this so-called \\"Golden Lily\\" program were widespread, and Magnus is killed trying to save his family from the Communist guerillas who came looking for the treasure. Aritomo never talked about the treasure to Yun Ling, but gradually it becomes clear that he might have left a clue to its location. Before he disappears into the jungle, he creates a complex horimono tattoo on her back. It now appears this tattoo might contain a map to the location of the treasure. Yun Ling decides that, before she dies, she must ensure that no one will be able to get their hands on either her body or the map. In the meantime, she sets out to restore Aritomo's now neglected and overgrown garden.  Main characters  * Teoh Yun Ling ‚Äî The main character, and first-person narrator of the novel. Yun Ling was the only survivor from her internment camp, and still suffers survivor guilt for not being able to save her sister. * Nakamura Aritomo ‚Äî At one time the gardener of Emperor Hirohito, Aritomo is fired due a dispute over a garden design with a Japanese notable. After resettling in Malaya to work on his own garden, he continues to work with the Japanese government to save locals from internment. He also collaborates with the Communist guerillas to protect the garden and its neighbours from attack. In addition to being a skilled gardener and artist, Aritomo also practises other Zen arts, such as archery and the tea ceremony. * Magnus Pretorius ‚Äî An expatriate from Transvaal, Magnus settled in the Cameron Highlands of Malaya to grow tea, and married a local woman. He fought in the Second Boer War, where he lost an eye. * Yoshikawa Tatsuji ‚Äî A Japanese historian who has attracted negative attention in his homeland for trying to throw light on his country's war crimes. During the war he was a Kamikaze pilot who was supposed to go on a suicide mission, but was saved by his lover and commanding officer. * Frederik Pretorius ‚Äî Magnus's nephew and heir. He has a short affair with Yun Ling before she becomes Aritomo's lover. * Yun Hong ‚Äî Yun Ling's older sister, who was forced to become a comfort girl to the Japanese soldiers at the internment camp. During a childhood visit to Japan, she became enamoured of Japanese gardens, and used memories of the gardens to help herself and her sister survive the mental traumas of the camp. * Emily ‚Äî Malaysian-Chinese woman who falls in love with Magnus and marries him. * Ah Cheong ‚Äî Aritomo's servant.  Themes  Taking place over three different periods of time, the novel deals with a number of historical issues. The Japanese occupation of Malaya is the backdrop of both later time periods. The central narrative of Yun Ling and Aritomo's relationship plays out against the backdrop of the post-war Malayan Emergency. Finally, as Yun Ling narrates the story in her present, we are in the age of independent Malaysia. The various characters represent different attitudes towards colonialism. Yun Ling ‚Äì a Straits Chinese ‚Äì downplays the importance of nationality: \\"Old countries are dying...and new ones being born. It doesn't matter where one's ancestors came from.\\"(Ch. 5) Magnus, meanwhile, sustains memories from South Africa under British rule, and flies a Transvaal flag from the top of his house. His sister died in a concentration camp, where he suspects she was murdered by the British.(Ch. 4) Tatsuji carries post-colonial guilt for the actions of his nation during the war, and tries to apologise to Yun Ling for the atrocities she has endured at his country's hands, but she replies that \\"[y]our apology is meaningless.\\"(Ch. 13) A central theme in the novel is the role of memory in human existence, and the relationship between memory and forgetting. The book opens with a quote from historian Richard Holmes, wherein he notes that while the ancient Greeks had a goddess for memory, Mnemosyne, there was none for forgetting. \\"Yet there should be, as they are twin sisters...\\"(Ch. 1) One reviewer observed: \\"Yun Ling's independent spirit and her anger seep like ink- stains into the narrative, but its distilled essence is a quieter appraisal of the dichotomy of memory, its treacherous failures, its cruel conveniences, its fadeout and deliverance.\\" Memory is also strongly tied to guilt, particularly survivor guilt; Yun Ling wonders \\"[w]hy did she survive and her sister perish?\\".  Critical reception  Critical reviews of The Garden of Evening Mists were mostly favourable. The Independent's Boyd Tonkin wrote that \\"Tan writes with breath-catching poise and grace.\\" He appreciated the combination of \\"action-packed, end-of-empire storytelling\\" and Tan's effort to \\"capture stillness on paper.\\" Meanwhile, Dominique Browning, writing for The Daily Telegraph, described Aritomo as \\"a fascinating character\\", and found the book \\"a strong, quiet novel.\\" Manasi Subramaniam of the Asian Review of Books found the ending \\"incredibly satisfying,\\" and commented on the writing's \\"lush beauty and artistry of a Japanese garden.\\" The Guardian's Kapka Kassabova noted that \\"[i]t is impossible to resist the opening sentence\\" of the novel: \\"On a mountain above the clouds once lived a man who had been the gardener of the Emperor of Japan.\\" On 25 July 2012, the book was longlisted for the Booker Prize, and on 11 September it was shortlisted. On 14 March 2013, it won the Man Asian Literary Prize. On 14 June 2013, it won the Walter Scott Prize for Historical Fiction.

There was no series production. Design and development In the 1950s Simmering- Graz-Pauker A.G. (SGP) was a large manufacturing concern but the M-222 Flamingo was their first aircraft. It was a conventional twin engine monoplane, smaller than many but seating four in two rows. The wings of the Flamingo had a laminar flow airfoil and were made entirely of wood. The first prototype was powered by 150 hp (112 kW) Lycoming O-320 flat-four engines but later aircraft had 200 hp (150 kW) Lycoming IO-360 flat-fours. These were conventionally mounted ahead of the leading edge in long cowlings with their propeller shafts, driving two-blade airscrews, centred above the wing upper surface. There were fuel tanks in the thin wings, with more fuel in wing tip tanks. Unusually, the Flamingo was fitted with both flaps and airbrakes. The flaps were of the camber changing type, to increase lift at low speed; they were split into three sections on each wing and slid rearwards and downwards on concealed rails. The airbrakes were wing mounted spoilers for losing speed. Like the wings the empennage was all-wood; the cantilever tailplane was set low on the fuselage. The Flamingo's fuselage had a welded steel tube structure, skinned forward with light alloy and aft with laminated plastic. Its two rows of seats were enclosed under a three part canopy which merged at the rear into the raised fuselage. There was a wide door on either side for cabin access and a separate baggage space behind the seats. It had a retractable tricycle undercarriage with the mainwheels, fitted with brakes, behind the engines. The nosewheel was steerable. The undercarriage, like the flaps and airbrakes, were hydraulically powered. The first prototype flew for the first time on 15 May 1959 but was lost in a fatal crash during single engine tests on 2 August 1959. Development work continued on a second aircraft which first flew in 1960 and a third followed in 1962. The fourth aircraft, now renamed the Simmering-Graz-Pauker SGP.222 was intended as a production prototype and demonstrator and appeared at the 1964 Hamburg show, though it turned out to be the last of the line. It incorporated several changes in response to the lengthy development trials. The wing leading edges had breaker strips added and there were new fillets in this edge at the root and on the outboard side of the engine cowlings. The ailerons were mass balanced and fitted with ground adjustable trim tabs, and the upper hinge gaps sealed with fabric. The most obvious external changes were to the empennage where the horizontal tail now had positive dihedral and the previously rounded vertical tail had been enlarged and given severe straight taper, assisted by a ventral fin to improve low speed handling. Both elevators and the rudder had trim tabs. One independent report of this fourth aircraft's handling found it well behaved, stable but responsive with a docile stall and brisk climb. It received its Austrian and FAA Type Certificates early in 1964. After US certification the designation SGP.222VS (VS being German for US) was briefly used but this was later changed to SGP.222A. At the end of 1964 the programme was terminated and the three surviving examples scrapped.

Whilst serving as Prime Minister of Ethiopia, Meles Zenawi concurrently served as the Leader of the Tigray People's Liberation Front (TPLF) and Ethiopian People's Revolutionary Democratic Front (EPRDF). First term (1995-2000) =Economic restructuring= Following the Ethiopian Civil War, 1983-1985 famine, and the Marxist policies of the prior governments (Derg and the People's Democratic Republic of Ethiopia) the Ethiopian economy was in shambles. Privatisation of government companies, end of communal farms, land law reforms, and foreign investment laws were all implemented. =Ethnic federalism= The Meles government created an ethnic-based federalism, which came under attack by some Ethiopians. Meles' TPLF party believed that there was no choice‚Äîthis was the only solution to the centuries-old oppression by centralist governments, and to domination of culture, language, politics and economy by one ethnic group, namely the Amhara. On the other hand, some parties like the OLF (Oromo Liberation Front), which was a partner in drafting the constitution, see Amhara and Tigrayan domination of the country. The aim of the government policy was to empower all ethnicities and develop their cultures and languages. Also it was widely seen as a solution to the demand of governance preferred by the ethnic-based liberation fronts and parties participating in the July Convention of Nationalities in 1991. In response to critics who say ethnic federalism can bring divisions, Meles said that this policy served many interests, including equitable distribution of wealth and empowerment of ethnicities. He said the \\"ethnic basis of Ethiopia's democracy stemmed from the government's fight against poverty and the need for an equitable distribution of the nation's wealth: peasants must be enabled to make their own decisions in terms of their own culture. Power must be devolved to them in ways that they understand, and they understand ethnicity.... Other approaches to development had been hegemonic and exploitative and had led to internecine strife and civil war.\\" Meles claimed that there are two basic views about ethnic federalism: \\"if you think it is a threat, it will be; if you think it a benefit, then it will be.\\" Making this statement, he concluded that \\"ethnicity will become less an issue as the economy grows and Ethiopia's process of assimilation does its job.\\" Meles Zenawi's government introduced a diverse but controversial policy of decentralization of the language system in Ethiopia. Most Ethiopians are taught using their mother tongue in primary schools and they are encouraged to develop their own languages. Some critics have said that this policy harms the unity and national identity of the country, while others have supported and praised the policy. Currently, many regional states have their own official state language. For instance, Afaan Oromo is the official language of the Oromia regional state but Amharic is still the official working language in the State of Southern Nations, Nationalities and Peoples. =Freedom of religion= Although Muslims and Orthodox Christians lived together in Ethiopia for many centuries, complete religious freedom was formalized only in 1991. Many of the pre-existing issues ‚Äì dominance of the state religion to 1974, seizure of the church properties by the Mengistu regime, 1974‚Äì91, state-sponsored persecution of non-Orthodox Christians, second-class citizenship accorded to Ethiopian Muslims, landownership problems and similar issues for non-Orthodox believers ‚Äì have subsided for the most part. There are currently between 12 and 15 million Protestant Christians, as well as other new non-Orthodox Christians. Clashes have been very rare with the domination of the Orthodox. Most analysts say that since such equality and full religious freedom didn't exist before, the infrequent clashes might occur until the culture of tolerance grows between all old and new religions and denominations. =Multi-party system= Meles became the first Ethiopian leader to develop a multi-party system, including an opposition party, in the Ethiopian parliament. = Private Press = While previously most of the media were politically oriented, following the government crackdowns on media after 2005 election the number of political media is going down while entertainment and business media are on the rise. On the other hand, for what is believed to be the first time in Ethiopia's history, the government granted private commercial FM radio licenses, to two domestic pro-government operators. As of 2009, there are over 56 radio stations in the country that are owned and operated by regional governments, community organisations, and private companies. The government has issued licenses for seven regional states' television transmissions agencies, but there are still no private broadcasters in the country. =Equity and growth= Throughout its operation, the government and the Prime Minister have advocated \\"pro-poor\\" domestic policies. According to World Bank's East African leadership, the Ethiopian government ranks number one in Africa on spending as a share of GDP going to pro-poor sectors.Ethiopian government's rank in Africa on spending policies The administration has also created self-governing regional development organizations like Amhara Development Association, Tigray Development Association, Oromia Development Association and many others. Even though Meles' administration inherited one of the worst economies in the world, the country's economy grew steadily after he took office. During the last seven years, Ethiopia's GDP has shown a rate of growth of about 9 percent a year. The country was also in the top category for ‚Äúpolicies of social inclusion and equity,‚Äù in the domain of ‚Äúeconomic management,‚Äù and Ethiopia did exceptionally well in the domain of ‚Äústructural policies‚Äù and ‚Äúpublic sector management and institutions.\\" Gross primary enrollment rates, a standard indicator of investment in the poor, went up to 93 percent in 2004 from 72 percent in 1990, contributing to a rise in literacy rates from 50 percent in 1997 to 65 percent in 2002. Still some opposition parties in the Ethiopian parliament doubted the economic growth. During the House's 31st regular session where the parliament reserved its monthly \\"Opposition Day,\\" some opposition MPs condemned the ruling party, pointing to double-digit inflation as a sign of the government's economic failures. The African Development Bank and the Paris-based OECD Development Center stated that Ethiopia has become one of the fastest growing countries in Africa. =Foreign policies= Despite working together against the Derg regime, Meles and Afewerki's positive relationship turned sour after Meles succumbed to U.S. pressure to hold an election within a year, but Afewerki abandoned his original promise to create a transitional government in the early 1990s. The Eritrean-Ethiopian War began in May 1998. After the Ethiopian breach of the western front and subsequent capture of parts of western Eritrea, Ethiopian President Negaso Gidada gave a victory speech and a peace treaty was signed a few weeks later. According to the peace treaty Ethiopia then pulled out. Though Ethiopian troops controlled Badme, after an international court ruled that Badme belonged to Eritrea, Ethiopia continued to maintain a presence of Ethiopian soldiers in the town.  Second term (2000-2005)  Meles with President of Russia Vladimir Putin on 3 December 2001In the 2000 general elections, Meles was reelected Prime Minister, and his ruling EPRDF party shared parliament seats with the opposition party United Ethiopian Democratic Forces (UEDF). According to observers organized by Ethiopian Human Rights Council, local U.N. staff, diplomatic missions, political parties, and domestic non-governmental organizations, both the general and the regional elections that year were generally free and fair in most areas; however, serious election irregularities occurred in the Southern Nations, Nationalities and Peoples' Region (SNNPR), particularly in the Hadiya Zone.\\"Ethiopia: Country Reports on Human Rights Practices\\", Bureau of Democracy, Human Rights, and Labor, US State Department . Retrieved 9 July 2009. = School expansion = Since the 1990s Ethiopia has experienced more increase of schools and colleges despite still not covering all regions. Millions of Ethiopian birr (ETB) continue to be spent on building educational institutions and many new schools have been constructed since Meles Zenawi took office. However, the government's focus on the agricultural sector has slowed the growth of jobs in the urban areas of Ethiopia, which is reflected in the anger of the urban population and its students as well as the landslide victory of opposition parties in these areas during the recent national election. Statistics showed that in 1991 only 27 percent of Ethiopian children attended school, but in 2004 gross enrollment rate was up to 77 percent and it reached 85 percent in November 2006. , there were 13,500 elementary schools and 550 secondary schools. A majority of them are newly constructed and the secondary schools are connected by satellite in a new programme called School- Net.Educational improvements More colleges and Universities have been constructed and/or expanded during the last few years than in whole history of Ethiopia. These colleges and Universities include Adama University (Oromia), an expansion of Nazreth technical college, Jimma University (started earlier), Mekelle University newly built under Meles, Debub University, an expansion of Awassa college, Bahir Dar (Amhara state) University, an expansion of a polytechnic college and teacher's college, and others. Also most of the older colleges have added various new departments, including faculties of law, business, etc. Other new growing colleges include Jijiga (Somali state) University, institutions in Debre Markos, Semera (Afar), Aksum, Tepi, Nekemte (Oromia), Kombolcha (Amhara State), Dire Dawa and in Debre Birhan. Wollega University in the Oromia state is the most recently finished university in Ethiopia with various modern facilities, with 20 new fields of studyWollega University expanding and the new Wolaita Soddo University started taking in students in February 2007.New university and facilities Woliata Soddo U Including the new Axum University, 12 new universities are starting operation in 200712 new universities in 2007 Other fairly new universities like Dilla University in the Gedeo Zone SNNP region launched new facilities, expanded laboratories for research, and initiated new post-graduate studies.new University research project In the last decade, more than 30 new private colleges & universities have been created, including Unity College. The University Capacity Building Program (UCBP) is a leading project in this sector. = Land and agriculture = Ethiopian agriculture is predominantly rain-fed subsistence agriculture, troubled by recurrent droughts. After Meles came to power in 1991, there were three major droughts in 1999/2000, 2002/2003 and 2009/2010. The most significant reform regarding land use after Meles took power was the dissolution of the collective farms and redistribution of land at local levels. The demand for land ownership, expressed in the slogan \\"Land to the tiller,\\" was central in toppling the feudal monarchy. The demand, however, was not fully answered. The new constitution, in Article 40, section 3, states that, \\"The right to own rural and urban land as well as natural resources belongs only to the state and the people\\". The farmers have land use rights, but uncertain transfer rights. Starting in 2008, this land policy was set back after the government announced that it would begin leasing large areas of \\"empty\\" farm lands to foreign investors. Derided internationally as \\"land grabs,\\" these operations threaten some smallholders with the loss of their plots. Reporting on this issue, the New York Times, quoting an expert, wrote, \\"One thing that is very clear, that seems to have escaped the attention of most investors, is that this is not simply empty land\\" The government defends its land policy, given the common occurrences of natural disasters such as drought or bad weather. The government says that had farmers been allowed to own land, they might have been forced to sell it during drought. To prevent this, the EPRDF government believes land ownership should not be privatized. Accordingly, the government states that it should focus on its agriculture sector while it is developing its industrial sector simultaneously, so that it can balance everything once the other sectors are developed and increase productivity. Government transformation of the construction sector, for example, led to a rare construction boom from the early 2000s until cement and other shortages caused it to slow down. The government believes privatization should be employed in the future but not presently. Knowing that constitutional change is required to privatize lands, the government assumed that it would hold a long-term super majority in parliament, to enable it to make the transition. Since this approach to land ownership is unconventional, especially to Western nations, opposition political parties have used this to their advantage during elections, arguing that land ownership has to be privatized. Yet the government seems unfaltering and states that flexibility is needed to address the lack of industrial development in the country despite accusations from the opposition.  Third term (2005-2010)  = Election violence = Meles encountered his first real challenge in the 2005 elections. His party was declared winner and kept his prime minister seat for another term, although the major opposition groups (the Coalition for Unity and Democracy (CUD), UEDF, and the Oromo Federalist Democratic Movement) gained a number of seats in the national parliament. More than 30 other political parties participated in the election.Election results with detailed map of Ethiopia These elections were the most contested and the most controversial in Ethiopia's short democratic history, with some opposition parties arguing that the election was stolen by the ruling party. Allegations of fraud were especially strong in the rural areas, as the opposition parties won in most urban areas, whereas the EPRDF won mostly in rural districts. The aftermath of the election led to riots and demonstrations against the results, particularly in the capital, which had to be stopped by peace officers. Some opposition parties blamed the government for the violence, even though they were tried and convicted in the court of the countries law. At the end of the demonstration, along with seven police officers 193 citizens were killed and 763 civilians wounded. Tens of thousands of Ethiopians were also jailed. Many protesters and around 75 police officers were injured.Inquiry on post-election violence This led to many rounds of accusations between the government and the protesters where the Information Minister Berhan Hailu said the government was \\"sorry and sad\\", but blamed the violence on the CUD. In an interview, the United States AID director repeated that the Carter Center understood that the ruling party (EPRDF) won the election and most of his peers confirmed that as well. The USAID director also criticized some EU observers, accusing them of bias and favoring the opposition. He said some European observers practiced outside of their jobs and went \\"overboard in encouraging the opposition and making them think that somehow they had won the election.\\" He concluded that the American government never believed the opposition won the election. = Agriculture = To bring order and transparency to the agricultural sector, the country started its first market exchange program and company, called Ethiopia Commodity Exchange.Ethiopian Commodity Exchange (ECEX) In April 2008, the country finalized the exchange, according to Meles Zenawi, to \\"revolutionalize the country's backward and inefficient marketing system.\\" Other than the dominant coffee industry, the government has made the floriculture industry another sector where Ethiopia can have comparative advantage. Various Kenyan investors have already moved to Ethiopia and the industry seems to be growing rapidly. Flower growers from other countries were also said to be relocating to Ethiopia.flower growers relocate to Ethiopia Ethiopia recently became Africa‚Äôs second largest flower exporter after Kenya, with its export earnings growing by 500 per cent over the past year.Ethiopia's export earnings growing by 500 per cent According to the Oromia Investment Commission, foreign investors are taking advantage of the new favorable investment opportunity in the sugar sector, where recently $7.5 billion has been invested.$7.5 billion invested on sugar Ethiopia also depends on livestock exports as well. Issues relating to wildlife conservation have been tackled aggressively under Meles Zenawi. The World Wildlife Fund praised the Ethiopian government's progress, saying, \\"Ethiopia has set a fine example for other countries to emulate.\\" Another issue promoted by Meles Zenawi has been economic development in \\"green fashion.\\" Discussing during an annual meeting under the Clinton Global Initiative in September 2007, Meles debated with Tony Blair and other world leaders about global warming and trade.Africa climate change woes aired at Clinton summit According to Reuters,Meles stated the need for a cap and trade mechanism and for different strategies towards Africa, since it did not contribute as much towards global warming. = Economic growth = A recent issue has been the shortage of cement to sustain the construction boom in the country. However, foreign and native investment, including the recent investment in a US$5 billion cement factory in Misraq Gojjam Zone of the Amhara Region, are an attempt to stabilize the situation.$5 billion birr cement factory Still the brief severe shortage that occurred in 2005 was blamed on Meles Zenawi's policies that were alleged to ignore urban development. Other recent development in the country included a first car factory in Ethiopia that assembles cars to sell for local- and export-markets, as well as cars that use liquefied petroleum gas, bus manufacturing in Mek'ele and taxi manufacturing in Modjo city, Oromia state. The dramatic development of most sectors in Ethiopia‚Äìincluding textiles, leather, garments, agriculture, beverages, construction, and others‚Äìhas caused Ethiopia to be labeled the \\"East African land of opportunity\\" by the World Investment News. Some economists state that Ethiopia's economic growth has come at the expense of inflation. The World Bank, in Ethiopia's country profile in 2010, mentioned the underlying inflation threat that started in 2008 might continue. Despite the inflation and differences in the rate of economic growth in reports among several international organizations, they continued to praise the economic growth. The African Development Bank claimed that Ethiopia \\"is registering a remarkable economic growth in recent years.\\" On top of that various social concerns exist and the Ethiopian section of VOA news on its Amharic language program has reported about problems facing farmers and growers who often get less profit due to the market exploitation of middlemen. =Climate change= Meles played an important role in developing the African Union's position on climate change since 2009 and was a 'friend of the Chair' at the 15th Conference of the Parties (COP15) to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC). On 31 August 2009, Meles was appointed Chair of the African Heads of State and Government on Climate Change (CAHOSCC). The group had been established following the 4 February 2009 decision at the 12th AU Assembly of Heads of States to build a common Africa position on climate change in preparations for COP15. Prior to Meles' appointment, but in light of the AU's decision and the Algiers Declaration on the African Common Platform to Copenhagen, on 19 May 2009 the Africa Group made a submission to the UNFCCC that included demands for US$67 billion per year in finance for adaptation funding and US$200 billion per year for mitigation and set targets in terms of reductions of emissions by developed countries not by reference to temperature. On 3 September 2009 Meles made a speech to the Africa Partnership Forum where he said:‚Äù > We will never accept any global deal that does not limit global warming to > the minimum unavoidable level, no matter what levels of compensation and > assistance are promised to us‚Ä¶ While we will reason with everyone to achieve > our objective, we will not rubber stamp an agreement by the powers that be > as the best we could get for the moment. We will use our numbers to > delegitimize any agreement that is not consistent with our minimal position. > If needs be we are prepared to walk out of any negotiations that threaten to > be another rape of our continent. At the 33rd G8 summit in Heiligendamm in 2007 (Meles at elevated row fourth from left)On 12 December 2009 at COP15, the Africa Group made a further submission to the UNFCCC that called for 45% emission reductions by developed countries by 2020, finance for adaptation of $150 billion immediately as special drawing rights from the IMF, $400 billion in fast-track financing, and 5% of developed countries' GNP in longer-term financing. On 15 December 2009 Meles Zenawi issued a joint press release with the President of France, Nicolas Sarkozy, which declared that the African Union position at Copenhagen was a 2 ¬∞C temperature target, 10 billion euros in 'fast-track financing,' and 100 billion euros in 'long-term financing.'Page non trouv√©e ‚Äì Pr√©sidence de la R√©publique . Elysee.fr. This new position from Meles was observed to be the same as the European Union's position and received widespread condemnation by other African leaders, including Namibian Prime Minister Nahas Angula, Lesotho‚Äôs Bruno Sekoli, Ugandan chief negotiator and Minister of Water and Environment Maria Mutagamba and Sudan‚Äôs Ambassador and Chair of G77, Lumumba Di-Aping. African civil society groups condemned the position as a betrayal of Africa. Archbishop Desmond Tutu said the two degree target \\"condemns Africa to incineration and no modern development\\". = Women's rights = The Ethiopian leadership has made significant advances to protect women's rights in recent years. It has its first Minister of Women's Affairs and has overhauled legislation on rape, female genital mutilation, and other offences. = Foreign policy =  Water  Meles moved to have Ethiopia gain a larger share of the Nile River water. Part of this entailed using Ethiopia's hydropower prospects as leverage in exporting power to Egypt, amongst others. He had also aided the Sudan People's Liberation Army/Movement prior to South Sudan's independence as the rebels fought the government in Khartoum.  Somalia  In 2006, the Islamic Courts Union (ICU) assumed control of much of the southern part of Somalia and promptly imposed Shari'a law. The Transitional Federal Government sought to re-establish its authority, and, with the assistance of Ethiopian troops, African Union peacekeepers and air support by the United States, managed to drive out the rival ICU. On 8 January 2007, as the Battle of Ras Kamboni raged, TFG President and founder Abdullahi Yusuf Ahmed, a former colonel in the Somali Army, entered Mogadishu for the first time since being elected to office. The Somali government then relocated to Villa Somalia in the capital from its interim location in Baidoa. This marked the first time since the fall of the Siad Barre regime in 1991 that the federal government controlled most of the country. Following this defeat, the Islamic Courts Union splintered into several different factions. Some of the more radical elements, including Al-Shabaab, regrouped to continue their insurgency against the TFG and oppose the Ethiopian military's presence in Somalia. Throughout 2007 and 2008, Al-Shabaab scored military victories, seizing control of key towns and ports in both central and southern Somalia. At the end of 2008, the group had captured Baidoa but not Mogadishu. By January 2009, Al-Shabaab and other militias had managed to force the Ethiopian troops to retreat, leaving behind an under-equipped African Union peacekeeping force to assist the TFG's troops. Between 31 May and 9 June 2008, representatives of Somalia's TFG and the Alliance for the Re-liberation of Somalia (ARS) group of Islamist rebels participated in peace talks in Djibouti brokered by the former United Nations Special Envoy to Somalia, Ahmedou Ould- Abdallah. The conference ended with a signed agreement calling for the withdrawal of Ethiopian troops in exchange for the cessation of armed confrontation. Parliament was subsequently expanded to 550 seats to accommodate ARS members, which then elected Sheikh Sharif Sheikh Ahmed, the former ARS chairman, to office. In October 2011, a coordinated multinational operation began against Al-Shabaab in southern Somalia, with the Ethiopian military eventually joining the mission the following month. According to Ramtane Lamamra, the AU Commissioner for Peace and Security, the additional Ethiopian and AU troop reinforcements are expected to help the Somali authorities gradually expand their territorial control.  Fourth term (2010-2012)  =Women's rights= The TPLF has associated itself with gender equality since the days of armed conflict, when, in the northern states, Tigrayan and some Amhara women soldiers fought together with men against the Derg dictatorship. Meles Zenawi's administration, along with First Lady Azeb Mesfin, have strongly advocated for more equal rights and opportunities for women in Ethiopia. Despite the country having a rich history of respected queens and empresses, Meles inherited a national situation in which Ethiopian women did not have equality or basic rights. Since his administration began, there has been a steady growth of women's organizations, women activists and employment opportunities and a forum where women discuss backward cultural issues on national television. In their long fight against destructive traditional practices, HIV transmission, early marriage, lack of legal rights for women, unfair public policies, job opportunity and other issues, various organizations continue to work with the government including the Ethiopian Women‚Äôs Lawyers Association (EWLA), Network of Ethiopian Women's Associations, the Ethiopia Media Women‚Äôs Association (MWA), the Young Women's Christian Association (YWCA), Women in Self Employment (WISE), the Ethiopian Medical Women's Association (EMWA), the Women‚Äôs Association of Tigray (WAT), the Kembatti Mentti Gezzima-tope (KMG), the Ethiopian Nurse Midwives Association (ENA) and others. =Water= One of the most important resources of the country, water (the Nile), has also been a focus of Meles's administration. Due to the potential conflict that can occur between Egypt and Ethiopia, Meles's EPRDF-led government has chosen to initiate and support programs that would benefit all sides in the use of the Nile. So far many small scale dams have been constructed in Ethiopia but large dams have been rare because of limited financial capabilities. The country is planning to export electricity to Sudan and Djibouti by 2010, and has currently began the newest project in western Ethiopia to construct Africa's biggest hydroelectric dam, located on the Ethiopia-Sudan border.

The character has been played by Christoph Mory, after being introduced by Tom Vieh√∂fer. Casting In late 2010 the producers of Verbotene Liebe decided to introduce another member of the Lahnstein family. In order to do that part of the history of the family was rewritten. Sebastian von Lahnstein was originally named as Ludwig's eldest son and caretaker of the family while Ludwig had to spend years in prison for a crime he didn't commit. With the announcement of the casting of Tom Vieh√∂fer as Hagen von Lahnstein, he was named the eldest son who left the family and didn't have any connections to his family in almost two decades. The writers used this fact to explain why Hagen wasn't mentioned prior to his arrival. Vieh√∂fer filmed his first scenes in October 2010 and was first seen on-screen on 14 January 2011. Hagen was introduced to the show with a major love triangle with two sisters. Vieh√∂fer didn't match the producers vision for the role and was recast after only a few months. Christoph Mory took over the role who previously worked with the production company UFA on the telenovela Bianca ‚Äì Wege zum Gl√ºck. Vieh√∂fer last appeared on 18 May 2011. Mory took over the role on-screen on 23 May 2011. Christoph Mory played the role for two years. After this his contract wasn't renewed and Mory left the show with his on-screen father Krystian Martinek (Ludwig) on 23 April 2013. Hagen and Ludwig went missing on a boat trip and soon would both be declared dead. Mory returned a year later together with Martinek to give viewers closure to what happened to both characters. Christoph Mory returned on 5 May 2014. New flashbacks were shown which saw Ludwig dying in his son's arms after promising that he would take over as his heir if he ever would get back home. Mory stayed for another four months and will leave the show again with his on-screen wife Diane Willems (Dana) on 10 September 2014. Storylines =Background= Hagen von Lahnstein is the eldest child of Ludwig von Lahnstein. He has four younger siblings, Sebastian von Lahnstein, Helena von Lahnstein and Tristan von Lahnstein and Rebecca von Lahnstein. After the death of his mother, with his father supposedly dead as well, he refused to take care of his siblings, leaving the family and letting Sebastian do all the work. =Storylines= After over a decade since a terrible falling out with his siblings, Hagen returns to his family in January 2011 to help his father Ludwig battle leukemia by donating his bone marrow. His siblings aren't too happy to see him. His brother Sebastian confronts Hagen with the fact that he walked out on the family and left him alone to take care of his younger siblings. After a while Sebastian and Hagen try get past everything that happened. Hagen returns to K√∂nigsbrunn Castle and starts to become the caretaker of the family-owned stud farm. Hagen marries his girlfriend Marlene Wolf but soon develops feelings for her younger sister Dana. Hagen and Dana try to fight their feelings for each other but soon start having an affair. When the truth is revealed, Marlene and Hagen get a divorce. Hagen and Dana become a couple and after making peace with Marlene, the two get married. After the wedding, the couple decides to try to have a baby. Then Dana is confronted with not being able to take a baby to the full term. They look for other options and decide to go for surrogacy which is forbidden by German law. As their plan doesn't work out the couple starts having problems. One night, a drunk Hagen ends up sleeping with Jessica Stiehl which further damages his relationship with Dana. But Hagen and Dana can work through their differences and as Jessica discovers that she's pregnant the three of them decide to raise the baby together. Jessica gives birth to a baby boy which she names Maximilian. In mid-2013, Hagen and Ludwig go missing during a storm in the Caribbean while on a boat trip and are presumed dead. Hagen reappears a year later. Ludwig and Hagen spend months on a desert island before Ludwig dies in his son's arms. Before he dies, Ludwig makes Hagen promise that if he ever gets home he'd take over as the head of the family for him. Hagen returns after a year and tries to win back Dana who just started a new relationship with Ricardo Mendes. Hagen wins Dana back but his obsession with taking over as Ludwig's heir becomes a serious problem for their marriage. When Max turns sick and needs to move to the North Sea to live a healthy life, Hagen isn't sure if he's ready to give up on his father's dying wish. After Max' condition worsens, Hagen decides to step down as head of the family and move away with Dana and Jessica. When the family is unable to vote a new head, Hagen decides to solve the conflict. He uses his father's blood from a knife that he brought back from the island to forge another will of Ludwig's. In this will it says that Hagen could define his successor if he's unable to do it himself. Hagen wants his stepmother Elisabeth to take over. After Elisabeth sees how much the conflict over the position as head of the family is hurting the family she agrees. Sebastian and Hagen's cousin Ansgar are shocked and want to check if the will is real. When it's proven that the will is written in Ludwig's blood the family accepts it as Ludwig's last wish. Hagen reconciles with Sebastian who has been estranged to him since his return before leaving his life on K√∂nigsbrunn Castle behind and moving away with Dana, Jessica and Max.

He had previously worked at L'Astrance and L'Arp√®ge in France, before moving onto F√§viken in 2008, which is currently ranked the 57th best restaurant in the world and won two Michelin stars in 2016. Career Although a family story is told of Nilsson cooking his first meal at the age of three, his first culinary memory is of chopping cucumbers at his grandmother's farm. He had originally wanted to become a marine biologist, but instead attended a culinary school in √Öre, Sweden. He moved to Paris and began to work at the Michelin starred restaurant L'Arp√®ge under Alain Passard. He worked there for a couple of weeks before being fired as he was finding it hard to understand the other chefs as his French wasn't as good as he initially thought it was. He joined the team at Pascal Barbot's L'Astrance and worked there for the next three years. Afterwards he took a break from cooking, and decided to become a wine writer. He had become disillusioned with cooking after he returned to his homeland as he found it hard to source ingredients in Sweden that were as good as those in France, and he also felt that the dishes he was putting together were simply copies of those from Barbot. After he attended oenology school, he was recruited in 2008 to put together a wine cellar as a sommelier by the new owner of the F√§viken estate, some north of Stockholm, Sweden. He was originally under contract for three months, which was extended to a year when he began working at the restaurant. After failing to find a chef to work there, he returned to the kitchen himself and became head chef. After initially ordering ingredients from around the world, the restaurant became known for using local produce. Nilsson grows and hunts much of the ingredients locally. Because of the local climate over the winter, efforts are made to preserve ingredients, Nilsson said \\"We say goodbye to fresh ingredients on the first of October, and then we don't see them again until April.\\" Due to the techniques and sourcing of ingredients that Nilsson uses, comparisons have been made to Ren√© Redzepi of Noma. In 2010, Bruce Palling of The Wall Street Journal, included Nilsson in his list of the top ten young chefs in Europe. In 2014, season 3 of PBS's The Mind of a Chef series featured chef Nilsson in episodes 9 through 16. Each episode showed a different aspect of the chef's interest in Nordic cuisine and traditions and his process in creating dishes for F√§viken. Episode 16, titled \\"F√§viken,\\" gave viewers a behind the scene look during a dinner service at the restaurant. In 2015, Nilsson was one of six chefs featured on the first season of Netflix's original documentary program, Chef's Table. In May 2019, Nilsson announced that he plans to stop working as of December 14, 2019 and focus on his family and his hobbies. The F√§viken estate in J√§mtland, Sweden Personal life Nilsson who lives in nearby M√∂rsil likes to go hunting, particularly for black grouse. As of 2009, he owns a gun dog named Krut.

With an apparent visual magnitude of 4.80, it is visible to the naked eye on a clear dark night. Based on parallax measurements taken during the Hipparcos mission, it is approximately 110 light-years from the Sun. Zeta Eridani is the primary or 'A' component of a multiple star system designated WDS J03158-0849 (the secondary or 'B' component is 14 Eridani). Zeta Eridani's two components are therefore designated WDS J03158-0849 Aa and Ab. Aa is formally named Zibal , the traditional name for the system. Nomenclature Œ∂ Eridani (Latinised to Zeta Eridani) is the binary star's Bayer designation. WDS J03158-0849 A is its designation in the Washington Double Star Catalog. The designations of the two components as WDS J03158-0849 Aa and Ab derive from the convention used by the Washington Multiplicity Catalog (WMC) for multiple star systems, and adopted by the International Astronomical Union (IAU). Zeta Eridani bore the traditional name of Zibal. This is an old misreading of the Arabic ÿ±ÿ¶ŸÑ ri ºal \\"ostrich chicks\\" (with the carrier letter for the glottal stop taken for a 'b', and ÿ± 'r' taken for ÿ≤ 'z'), originally applied to a number of stars near Beid and Keid. In 2016, the International Astronomical Union organized a Working Group on Star Names (WGSN) to catalogue and standardize proper names for stars. The WGSN decided to attribute proper names to individual stars rather than entire multiple systems. It approved the name Zibal for the component WDS J03158-0849 Aa on 12 September 2016 and it is now so included in the List of IAU-approved Star Names.  Properties  Zeta Eridani is a single-lined spectroscopic binary system with an orbital period of 17.9 days and an eccentricity of 0.14. The primary is a mild Am star with a stellar classification of kA4hA9mA9V. This notation indicates this is a main-sequence star with the Ca-II K absorption line strength (k) of an A4 star, and the hydrogen lines (h) and metallic lines (m) of an A9 star. It has about 185% of the Sun's mass and 10.3 times the Sun's radius. This is a relatively young star with an estimated age of 800 million years, and it appears to have a moderately high rotation rate with a projected rotational velocity of 82 km/s. The system displays a statistically significant infrared excess at a wavelength of 70 Œºm. This suggests the presence of an orbiting debris disk. The temperature of the dust is 70 K, indicating an orbital distance of 31 AU. It has an estimated mass of about 0.26% of the Earth.

Educational Dialogues: Understanding and Promoting Productive Interaction. Abingdon, Oxon: Routledge, 2010. Mercer's key interest is in the quality of talk and its impact on educational outcomes, including talk in the home for example, arguing that \\"'social interaction and collaborative activity' in class can provide 'valuable opportunities' for learning\\" and that classroom talk should be oriented around co-operation rather than competitiveness, to encourage exploratory talk rather than disputational where the former focuses on explaining ideas, listening to others, and the building of mutual understanding and the latter on a lack of constructive argument which is characterised by disagreement with little explanation.Mercer, Neil, and Karen Littleton.

The film stars David Duchovny, Vera Farmiga, Graham Phillips, Keri Russell, Justin Kirk, and Ty Burrell. The film premiered at the Sundance Film Festival on January 24, 2012, and was given a limited release in the United States on August 10, 2012, by Image Entertainment. Plot Fifteen-year-old Ellis Whitman (Graham Phillips) is leaving his home in Tucson, Arizona, for his freshman year at Gates Academy, an East Coast prep school. He leaves behind Wendy (Vera Farmiga), his flaky, New Age mother and Goat Man (David Duchovny), a weed-smoking goat trekker and botanist. Goat Man is the only real father Ellis has ever known, since his biological father, Frank (Ty Burrell), left when he was a baby. Upon arriving Gates Academy, Ellis befriends his roommate Barney Cannel (Nicholas Lobue), a cross-country runner, and Rosenberg, who usually does not get anything higher than a C in his classes, but is smart enough to sneak in marijuana. Ellis also takes an interest in Minnie (Dakota Johnson), a local girl who works in the school library; his friends often refer to her as a prostitute, according to rumors. Meanwhile, Goat Man and Wendy have been incommunicado, which Barney points out often. On a phone call, Ellis discovers that his mother has a new boyfriend named Bennet (Justin Kirk), who is rude and disrespectful. One day, Ellis receives a letter in the mail from his long-estranged father from Washington, DC, requesting for Ellis to spend Thanksgiving dinner with him. Ellis decides to fly to Washington with Barney, who is also having Thanksgiving with his mother there. Ellis finally meets his father and his father's pregnant and kind-hearted wife, Judy (Keri Russell). One night, Ellis gets a call from Barney telling him that he is in possession of marijuana. Ellis sneaks out for the night, but Frank finds out that he left. On the way back from his flight from DC, Barney and Ellis get drunk and fight with each other in their dorm room, resulting in a dent in the wall which costs Wendy $700 and Ellis to end up in the school hospital. Afterwards, Ellis begins to get closer to Minnie. Over Christmas break, Ellis returns to Tucson, but feels betrayed by Goat Man when he discovers that he slept with their young but malicious neighbor, Aubrey (Adelaide Kane). His relationship with adults he grew up with is now challenged.

Shortly after, on February 7, 2012, the film was acquired by Image Entertainment for domestic distribution in the United States. The film was released in a limited release in the United States on August 10, 2012. Reception The film received generally negative reviews from film critics. Goats holds a 19% approval rating on review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, based on 27 reviews, with an average rating of 4.69/10. The website's critics consensus reads: \\"Goats reaches for profundity but mostly offers inane bleating, with David Duchovny's beard proving the most distinguishing feature of this bland dramedy.\\" On Metacritic, the film has a 38 out of 100 rating, based on 13 critic reviews, indicating \\"generally unfavorable reviews\\". Robert Abele from The Los Angeles Times wrote, \\"A coming-of-age story featuring Vera Farmiga as a narcissistic New Age mom, David Duchovny as her pot-smoking Jesus-bearded goat herder/poolman and Ty Burrell as the divorced dad with the new wife, would appear to have all sorts of behavioral flavors to chew on. Alas, Goats ‚Äì to borrow from the traits of its titular ruminants ‚Äì nibbles on a lot of stuff it never gets around to digesting.\\" Sara Stewart of The New York Post wrote, \\"There's a particularly irritating type of rich-boy coming-of-age movie in which any emotional growth is reflected in only the slightest tweak on the handsome protagonist's stony visage. If I were Holden Caulfield, I might call it lousy. It's the type of strummy-guitar-scored indie that's flypaper for quirky actors like Farmiga and Duchovny, who are given too much time to indulge their characters' back stories and to show off, respectively, their primal scream and goat imitation.\\" Lisa Schwarzbaum of Entertainment Weekly wrote, \\"Mark Jude Poirier adapted the screenplay from his own lively 2001 coming-of-age novel. As directed by Christopher Neil, Goats reports the same events but loses the flavor of the journey.\\" The New York Times Stephen Holden wrote, \\"If the aimless characters in Goats didn't feel so uncomfortably lifelike, it would be tempting to heap scorn on this wispy screen adaptation of Mark Jude Poirier's 2001 novel, directed by Christopher Neil from a screenplay by Mr. Poirier. Ms. Farmiga gives a bravely unsympathetic performance as the hysterical, self-pitying Wendy, who is filled with rage at her ex-husband, Frank.

In a career that lasted from July 1876 to May 1877 he ran eleven times and won five races. In 1876, Chamant won one of his first six races, but showed improved form at Newmarket in autumn when he won both the Middle Park Stakes and the Dewhurst Stakes. In 1877, Chamant won the 2000 Guineas and started second favourite for The Derby despite being found to be lame before the race. He finished unplaced behind Silvio, aggravating a back injury which ended his racing career. He later became a successful stallion in Germany. Background Chamant was a bay horse bred at the Haras Dangu stud of his owner Comte Frederic de Lagrange. Lagrange had extensive racing and breeding interests on both sides of the English Channel in partnership with his compatriot Claude Joachim Lef√®vre. Chamant was sired by Mortemer, a French-bred horse who won the Ascot Gold Cup for Lefevre in 1871. Chamant's dam, Araucaria, was a daughter of Pocahontas, the foundation mare of Thoroughbred family 3-n. Araucaria was an important broodmare in her own right: apart from Chamant she produced the St Leger winner Rayon d'Or and the 1000 Guineas winner Camelia. Like his sire Mortemer, Chamant was named after a village in Picardy. Lagrange sent the colt to his private trainer Thomas Jennings at his Phantom House stable at Newmarket, Suffolk. Racing career =1876: two-year-old season= Chamant arrived at Jennings' yard from France in June 1876, and it was some time before the trainer could bring him to peak condition. Despite not yet being fully fit, he began his racing career shortly afterwards, when he finished unplaced behind Warren Hastings in the July Stakes. He then finished second in the Lavant Stakes at Goodwwod before being sent to compete at Lewes Racecourse where he ran twice. After finishing unplaced behind the filly Placida in the Astley Stakes he recorded his first win in the ¬£465 Priory Stakes. At Doncaster in September, Chamant finished unplaced behind the filly Lady Golightly in the Champagne Stakes and third in another race at the same meeting. At Newmarket in October, Lagrange's colt started a 20/1 outsider for the year's most valuable two-year-old race, the six furlong Middle Park Plate, for which Lady Golightly was made 2/1 favourite. In a closely contested finish, Chamant won by a head from Pelegrino, just ahead of Plunger and Lady Golightly. According to press reports, he was \\"brilliantly ridden\\" by Jem Goater, but many observers considered the result to be a \\"fluke\\". Later that month Chamant, ridden again by Goater, started 9/4 for the seven furlong Dewhurst Stakes. Despite carrying a five pound weight penalty for winning the Middle Park Plate, he won impressively from Plunger to establish himself as the best two- year-old seen in Britain that season. Chamant's earnings of ¬£5,930 made him the third most successful horse of 1876 in Britain, behind the three-year-old classic winners Petrarch and Kisber. The success of Chamant, and other horses owned by Lagrange, led Lord Falmouth (the owner of Lady Golightly) to call for foreign horses to be banned from competing in British races. Falmouth unsuccessfully took his proposal to a general meeting of the Jockey Club in 1877. =1877: three-year-old season= Chamant reportedly thrived over the winter and by early 1877, the French colt was favourite for both the 2000 Guineas and the Derby, at odds of 3/1 and 6/1 respectively. On his first appearance of the season, Chamant was allowed to walk over at a race at Newmarket in April when the other entries were withdrawn by their owners. Following a large gamble on a previously unraced colt named Morier, Chamant started 9/4 second favourite in a field of eleven runners for the 2000 Guineas over the Rowley Mile course on 2 May. Ridden by Goater, Chamant tracked the leaders before taking the lead at half way. He was never seriously challenged and won with \\"consummate ease\\" from the American-bred Brown Prince with Lord Falmouth's Silvio in third. A telegram reporting the result to Australia became so garbled that it was interpreted as referring to the ongoing Russo- Turkish War and newspapers described an action in which 2,000 men were led to victory by \\"Chamat Croun\\" and \\"Prince Silvio\\". Four weeks later, Chamant faced sixteen opponents in the Derby at Epsom, and started second favourite behind Rob Roy. He had been favourite for the race for months, but his appearance in the paddock before the race caused serious concern, as he was seen to be lame in his hock. Lagrange was advised to withdraw the colt but decided to allow him to run. The odds against the French horse fluctuated wildly in the half- hour before the race, drifting from 6/4 to 20/1 before settling at 4/1. Chamant was not among the early leaders but improved to fourth place at half way. In the straight he briefly looked likely to challenge the leaders, but weakened in the final furlong and finished tenth behind Silvio. A back injury sustained in the 2000 Guineas had deteriorated throughout the season and by autumn the horse was also beginning to develop respiratory trouble which may have been a form of Roarer Syndrome. Despite his problems, Chamant was still strongly fancied for the St Leger, but he never raced again and was retired to stud at the end of the season. In December 1877, Chamant was put up for auction at Tattersalls but was not sold as he failed to reach his reserve price of ¬£6,000. Stud career Chamant began his stud career at the Haras Dangu, but after a single covering season he was sold for ¬£4,000 and exported to stand as a stallion at the German Imperial Stud at Graditz. He remained at Graditz until 1892 when he was moved to another Imperial Stud at Beberbeck where he lived for six years before dying of heart disease in 1898. Chamant sired three winners of the Deutsches Derby (Potrimpos, Peter and Habenichts) five winners of the Mehl-Mulhens-Rennen (German 2000 Guineas) and was the leading sire in Germany on six occasions. Apart from his success with Thoroughbreds, Chamant was also influential in the development of the Trakehner breed.

His work centered on psychiatry, and the influence of culture on personality. Caudill was especially interested in diagnosis and treatment of mental issues in Japan. Caudill was the first to identify the field of medical anthropology, and was active in organizing it during its formative years.Caudill 1953 Education and Appointments Caudill pursued his graduate studies in sociocultural anthropology at the University of Chicago. He received his Ph.D. in 1950 for a dissertation entitled Japanese- American Acculturation and Personality.University of Chicago Department of Anthropology: PhD Recipients After completing his graduate work, Caudill accepted an instructorship position at Yale University, and remained there from 1950-1952. Caudill then went on to accept a faculty position with the Department of Social Relations at Harvard University from 1952-1960. While at Harvard, Caudill also took an appointment as Research Associate with the Department of Psychology, within Harvard Medical School. After leaving Harvard in 1960, Caudill became Chief of the Personality and Environment Section of the Laboratory of Socioenvironmental Studies at the United States National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH).William Abel Caudill Papers 1950s-early 1960s Caudill remained at NIMH, where he was also a member of the Association Nominations Committee, until his death in 1972, in Washington D.C.Announcements 1974 Early Academic career During the early stages of his career, Caudill's research interests focused on culture and personality and psychological studies. Later on, when Caudill became more involved with medical anthropology, his interests shifted towards mental illness, and the experiences of patients in psychiatric hospitals. Caudill's earliest research, funded by the University of Chicago, was conducted in July and August 1946 and consisted of psychological study of the Chippewa Indians of Lac du Flambeau. Caudill investigated whether personality change could be visible under conditions of acculturation. Caudill participated in this study as a member of a field party led by Dr. Irving Hallowell.Caudill 1949: 409 From 1947 to 1949, Caudill conducted research on Japanese Americans in Chicago, who had recently been released from internment during World War II. Caudill, and the team he worked with, were interested in the social and psychological adjustment process that these Japanese Americans underwent after release from internment camps.William Abel Caudill Papers 1950s-early 1960s Contributions to Medical Anthropology After receiving his PhD from Chicago, Caudill's interests turned from psychological anthropology to medical anthropology. Caudill was able to conduct his first major fieldwork in medical anthropology after he was invited by Yale Medical School to study the social hierarchies within the Yale Psychiatric Institute. As a condition of the fieldwork, Caudill undertook participant observation by living as a \\"patient\\" in the Psychiatric Ward for two months, with his identity as a researcher known only to the superintendent of the hospital.Caudill 1959: 714 Caudill reported his conclusions from this fieldwork in \\"Social Structure and Interaction Processes on a Psychiatric Ward,\\" published in the American Journal of Orthopsychiatry in 1952. He identified a need for future anthropological study of hospitals.Caudill 1952: 43 After this study, Caudill published an article in Science that drew attention to the emerging field of medical anthropology. In \\"Anthropology in Medicine,\\" Caudill brought light to recent interdisciplinary scholarship, which he identified as critical in the study of medical anthropology. He wrote: > Social anthropologists and other social scientists have been doing unusual > things of late: participating with physicians in conferences in social > medicine, teaching in medical schools, working with public health services > in Peru, studying the social structure of hospitals, interviewing patients > about to undergo plastic surgery, and doing psychotherapy with Plains > Indians. These activities are indicative of a tentative liaison between > social science and medicine; but as yet there has been little real > intercommunication. Caudill noted that increased communication between specialists in medicine and the social sciences would help develop this field: a field which he cited as integral to the understanding and management of society's ills.Anthropology in Medicine 1952: 3 In the same year, Caudill undertook a more intensive study of the Yale Psychiatric Institute. This time, he approached the study from the position of anthropologist instead of patient.Caudill 1959: 714 For this follow-up study, Caudill conducted intensive interviews with hospital staff, recorded daily staff meetings, studied doctors' and nurses' notes, and interacted with patients. Caudill identified several challenges inherent in the structure of the Psychiatric Institute, and offered strategies to remedy these problems. Among the challenges identified were differential feelings among different levels of staff and patients about hospital life, breakdowns in communication between staff members, and periodic hospital-wide \\"mood sweeps\\". Caudill argued that increased awareness of hospital structure could help make job delegation a smoother process. Caudill also contended that the increasing specialization of medical positions was a cause of communication problems among members of a patient's care team. To address this problem, Caudill recommended that the positions of psychotherapist and ward administrator be combined.Caudill 1959: 715 Caudill's 1952 to 1953 study at the Yale Psychiatric Institute was published in 1958, in his book, \\"The Psychiatric Hospital as a Small Society\\".Caudill 1958 A resulting journal article and book from this research are considered to be some of the earliest contributions to the field of medical anthropology.Health and Illness 2010 Beginning in 1954, Caudill turned his interests to Japan, and made a series of trips in order to carry out research.William Abel Caudill Papers 1950s-early 1960s 2012 For \\"Some Covert Effects of Communication Difficulties in a Psychiatric Hospital,\\" published in 1954, Caudill spent six months conducting fieldwork at fifteen different Japanese hospitals. Here, Caudill's work focused again on social hierarchies within hospitals and their effects on patients.Caudill 1954: 156 During this period, Caudill also took interest in and observed the relationship between American soldiers and the Japanese communities within which they were situated within.William Abel Caudill Papers 1950s-early 1960s 2012 In 1958-59, Caudill's studies focused on three psychiatric hospitals with varied theoretical orientations and methods of treatment. He also carried out studies of Japanese psychoanalysis and Morita therapy.William Abel Caudill Papers 1950s-early 1960s 2012 In 1961, Caudill published \\"Around the Clock Patient Care in Japanese Psychiatric Hospitals: The Role of the Tsukisoi.\\" Caudill 1961 In this article, Caudill explores the role of tsukisoi, sub-professional nurses who are assigned on a one-on-one basis to patients in private Japanese psychiatric hospitals, in hospital power structures and patient well-being. A year later, Caudill published \\"Japanese Value Orientations and Culture Change.\\"Caudill 1962 Both research projects had been funded by the Foundation's Fund in Research in Psychiatry while Caudill was still a faculty member at Harvard University.Caudill 1961: 204 In 1964, Caudill continued his study of psychiatric hospitals but with a comparative research approach. In \\"Symptomatology in Japanese and American Schizophrenics,\\" Caudill compared symptom patterns of hospitalized schizophrenics in both Japanese and American psychiatric hospitals based on research at Matsuzawa Hospital in Tokyo and Spring Grove State Hospital in Cantonsville, Maryland.Caudill 1964: 172 Caudill also performed elegant comparative studies of mother-infant care in Japanese, Japanese-American (first and second generation) and American pairs. He demonstrated, for instance, that Japanese mothers would put down their infants to sleep after the infant was asleep; in contrast, American middle class mothers would put their awake infants in their cribs to sleep. This is consistent with amae and co-sleeping in Japanese culture. (Caudill and Weinstein) 1969 After Caudill's death in 1972, several of his articles were published posthumously. These include \\"The Influence of Social Structure and Culture on Human Behavior in Modern Japan,\\" which was extracted from Caudill's presentation at a symposium on \\"Culture, Change, and Psychological Adjustment\\" at the Eighth International Congress of Anthropological and Ethnological Science in Tokyo, in September 1968.Caudill 1973: 343 Selected bibliography 1949 \\"Psychological Characteristics of Acculturated WIsconsin Ojibwa Children,\\" American Anthropologist, 51:3, 409-427 1951 \\"Pitfalls in the Organization of Interdisciplinary Research,\\" Human Organization, 10:4, 12-15 1952 \\"Social Structure and Interaction Processes on a Psychiatric Ward,\\" American Journal of Orthopsychiatry, 22, 314-334 1952b \\"Anthropology in Medicine,\\" Science, 115, 3a 1953 \\"Cultural Perspectives on Stress,\\" in Walter Reed Army Medical Center Symposium on Stress, Washington, D.C., 194-208. 1954 \\"Some Covert Effects of Communication Difficulties in a Psychiatric Hospital,\\" Psychiatry, 17:1, 27-49. 1956 \\"Achievement, Culture and Personality: The Case of the Japanese Americans,\\" American Anthropologist, 58:6, 1102-1126 1956b \\"Perspectives on Administration in Psychiatric Hospitals,\\" Administrative Science Quarterly, 1:2, 155-170 1958 \\"Effects of Social and Cultural Systems in Reactions to Stress,\\" Social Science Research Pamphlet, 14. 1959 \\"Observations on the Cultural Context of Japanese Psychiatry,\\" in Culture and Mental Health: Cross-Cultural Studies,\\" Opler, Marvin Kaufmann, ed.

Android phones also have the ability to send and receive RCS via the messages app (if supported by the carrier). ; Auto Correction and Dictionary: Android Operating System has an interesting feature called Auto Correction. When any word is misspelled, then Android recommends the meaningful and correct words matching the words that are available in Dictionary. Users can add, edit and remove words from Dictionary as per their wish. ;Web browser: The web browser available in Android is based on the open-source Blink (previously WebKit) layout engine, coupled with Chromium's V8 JavaScript engine. Then the WebKit- using Android Browser scored 100/100 on the Acid3 test on Android 4.0 ICS; the Blink-based browser currently has better standards support. The old web browser is variably known as 'Android Browser', 'AOSP browser', 'stock browser', 'native browser', and 'default browser' (from the time it was always the default). Starting with Android 4.4 KitKat, Google has begun licensing Google Chrome (a proprietary software) separately from Android, but usually bundled with (what most device vendors did). Since Android 5.0 Lollipop, the WebView browser that apps can use to display web content without leaving the app has been separated from the rest of the Android firmware in order to facilitate separate security updates by Google. ; Voice-based features: Google search through voice has been available since initial release. Voice actions for calling, texting, navigation, etc. are supported on Android 2.2 onwards. As of Android 4.1, Google has expanded Voice Actions with ability to talk back and read answers from Google's Knowledge Graph when queried with specific commands. The ability to control hardware has not yet been implemented. ; Multi-touch: Android has native support for multi-touch which was initially made available in handsets such as the HTC Hero. The feature was originally disabled at the kernel level (possibly to avoid infringing Apple's patents on touch-screen technology at the time). Google has since released an update for the Nexus One and the Motorola Droid which enables multi-touch natively. ; Multitasking: Multitasking of applications, with unique handling of memory allocation, is available. ; Screen capture: Android supports capturing a screenshot by pressing the power and home-screen buttons at the same time. Prior to Android 4.0, the only methods of capturing a screenshot were through manufacturer and third-party customizations (apps), or otherwise by using a PC connection (DDMS developer's tool). These alternative methods are still available with the latest Android. ; TV recording:Android TV supports capturing :and replaying it. ; Video calling: Android does not support native video calling, but some handsets have a customized version of the operating system that supports it, either via the UMTS network (like the Samsung Galaxy S) or over IP. Video calling through Google Talk is available in Android 2.3.4 (Gingerbread) and later. Gingerbread allows Nexus S to place Internet calls with a SIP account. This allows for enhanced VoIP dialing to other SIP accounts and even phone numbers. Skype 2.1 offers video calling in Android 2.3, including front camera support.

It is now the site of Auckland Airport. Mangere Aerodrome's claim to fame was as the arrival point for New Zealand aviator, and aeroclub member, Jean Batten's solo flight from the United Kingdom in 1936. The RNZAF requisitioned the aerodrome from 1939 until 1944, renaming it RNZAF Station Mangere. In 1961, the Auckland Aero Club moved to Ardmore aerodrome and Mangere Aerodrome closed. The new Auckland Airport opened in 1965. Early years Established in 1928, after purchasing farmland on the northeastern edge of the vast Manukau Harbour near the (then) small town of Mangere, the aero club allowed aircraft owners a place to enjoy their 'hobby' without offending the residents of Auckland.History of New Zealand Aviation, 1976 In 1933 a concrete circle was created to guide landings. In 1936 passenger air travel was inaugurated by Union Airways from Mangere as part of the fledgling main trunk air route linking Auckland with Wellington and Christchurch. Union Airways built a large hangar to house its Lockheed Electra and de Havilland Express airliners, also building a comfortable passenger terminal building of the era. The 1936 plan was for 3 runways, the longest being . The Public Works Department laid a scoria runway for the service in 1937. Mangere Aerodrome's claim to fame was when it was the arrival point for New Zealand aviator, and aeroclub member, Jean Batten's solo flight from the United Kingdom in 1936.Reaching for the Skies, An end to IsolationTelevision New Zealand,1989 World War II When war was declared in 1939, the RNZAF requisitioned the aerodrome, renaming it RNZAF Station Mangere. The grass runway was extended to handle large aircraft up to Boeing B-17 Flying Fortress size. The Air Force used the aerodrome for Flight Instructor training until 1940. The No1 Anti-Aircraft Operating Flight was also based there amongst other wartime operational units. Squadrons from surrounding Manukau Harbour bases such as Ardmore and Seagrove were regular visitors along with aircraft from United States Armed Forces.RNZAF Stations Auckland regionWings over Cambridge Severely restricted civilian air services by Union Airways continued to operate throughout the conflict. The RNZAF returned the aerodrome to the Auckland Aero Club in 1944 after Allied forces had gained the upper hand in the Pacific Theater of War. Later years The aerodrome carried on with flying post war with flight training and general aeroclub activities. Passenger services from Mangere ended in 1947 when the newly nationalised airline, NAC was forced to move to the joint Air Force and Civilian airport at Whenuapai. At the time international flying operations were located at Mechanics Bay for flying boats and Whenuapai Air Force base for land based aircraft using a civilian terminal. It was logical that internal air services operated from there. In 1948 Mangere Aerodrome was short listed along with others as a possible future site of an overseas international landbased airport. In 1956, the aerodrome was chosen as the site of Auckland International Airport, due to its isolation from major built up urban areas with the prospect of jet transport on the horizon. In December‚ÄìJanuary 1960/61, with preliminary construction underway, the Auckland Aero Club moved to Ardmore aerodrome and Mangere Aerodrome closed.

The Polish colony in Venezuela is well dispersed throughout the country, but most of the Poles and their descendants live in big cities like Caracas, Maracaibo and Valencia. Polish immigration to Venezuela In the 1630s, there were ideas being proposed between Duke Jacob Kettler and the King of the Polish‚ÄìLithuanian Commonwealth, John II Casimir Vasa for Polish colonization of Venezuela. Polish ships had explored settlements within the Caribbean and tried on four occasions to establish a colony on the nearby island of Tobago, however the attempt of a colony failed and all plans to establish a colony in Venezuela faltered.Polonia y Venezuela: Historia y actualidad (in Spanish) In 1787, Polish King Stanis≈Çaw August Poniatowski hosted future Venezuelan military leader and revolutionary, Francisco de Miranda for a few days in Kani√≥w (in present day Ukraine) while Miranda was traveling Europe. During the Venezuelan War of Independence, several Polish officers served and fought for Venezuelan independence against Spanish troops. One Polish officer, Izydor Borowski fought for Venezuelan independence and was promoted to general by Sim√≥n Bol√≠var. Soon after Venezuela obtained independence, small numbers of Poles immigrated to Venezuela, many of them scientists, clergy, architects and engineers. Polish immigration to Venezuela occurred in three stages, the first during World War II, when Polish citizens of Jewish origin were fleeing the Holocaust. The second happened immediately after the war (years 1946-48), when the Poles of Jewish origin who survived the war joined their relatives already established in Venezuela. In addition, many Polish soldiers who had fought in Britain, Germany and Italy or were prisoners in Nazi camps migrated to Venezuela. Others migrated also after the war from Europe (not from Jewish origins) escaping the Soviets and ended being successful architects, engineers, businessmen and extraordinary human beings. Many escape to Germany at the end of the war and waited for two or three years to get documents and travel permits to move to Latin America, many came to Venezuela during the period of 1948 - 1952. The next wave of Polish immigration to Venezuela took place between 1957-1958 when a few hundred Polish citizens primarily of Jewish origin arrived. There were others who escaped from Poland during a communist crackdown (1947-1956). Current status As for their profession and employment, the largest group among Poles in Venezuela is constituted by representatives of small family business. There are a considerable number of musicians, academics and doctors. Teodoro Petkoff Malec is a Venezuelan politician, ex-guerrilla, journalist and economist. One of the most prominent politicians on the left in Venezuela, Petkoff began as a communist but gravitated towards liberalism in the 1990s. The governor of Miranda state, Henrique Capriles Radonski, film director Jonathan Jakubowicz, and the writer Luis Zelkowicz are of Polish origin. In the sports world, Jimy Szymanski is a representative of Venezuela in tennis. Ilan Chester is a singer and composer. Mariano Kossowski founded Promar TV in Barquisimeto, Lara State . Nina Novak prima ballerina is a dance national prize of 1996, Harry Abend, is a national prize winning sculptor, and Maria Magdalena and Andrzej Antczak are recognized archaeologists.

Two Polish Venezuelans have achieved considerable success in the Miss Venezuela. In 1996, Miss Venezuela for Miss World pageant was Ana Cepinska who then get the third place in the Miss World 1996 pageant in India. In 2003 one of the 10 finalists of Miss Venezuela was Francys Sudnicka, who later represented Poland in the Miss Universe 2006 (did not place) and Miss Earth 2006 (semi-finalist) pageants.

He is best known for being a member of the glam metal band Britny Fox, and as a member of Doro Pesch's band since 1993. In the past Dee played in the bands Mariah and Waysted, as well as collaborated with artists such as Blaze Bayley and guitarist Jack Frost. Career John DiTeodoro jr. was born and raised in Conshohocken, Pennsylvania, a suburb of Philadelphia, where he attended Spring Mill Elementary and Plymouth-Whitemarsh Senior High, graduating at Central Montco Technical High School in Commercial Art. He is a self-taught musician, who started playing drums at the age of 12. The first influences on his drumming style came from Peter Criss (KISS) and Ian Paice (Deep Purple). His first experiences with local bands put him in contact with other young musicians of the neighborhood, like Billy Degley, later known as Billy Childs, and other future members of Britny Fox. Johnny Dee began his career as drummer for the heavy metal band World War III in his home town Philadelphia around 1985, recording their self-titled debut in the same year. A short time later, he joined the British hard rock band Waysted, with which he recorded the album Save Your Prayers in 1986. When Waysted disbanded, he returned to Philadelphia in 1987 to replace in the glam metal band Britny Fox the temporary drummer Adam West, who in turn had replaced the late Tony Destra. The band's first two albums, Britny Fox (1988) and Boys in Heat (1989), climbed the charts and achieved considerable success. Singer and guitarist Dean Davidson left the band in 1990 to form Blackeyed Susan and Britny Fox continued with his replacement Tommy Paris, but did not get the good results of previous years. The first album with Paris, Bite Down Hard (1991), did not find a receptive market and sold poorly. In 1991, Dee recorded with the Minneapolis glam metal band Mariah their second album Somewhere Between Heaven and Earth, which was published in a cassette-only limited edition. The band line-up comprised D.O.A. and Waysted keyboardist Jimmy DiLella and Tim Compton, former guitarist of Lynn Allen. DiLella had been a session musician for Britny Fox, but had never played with the group before their premature disbandment in 1993. However, he was instrumental in the hiring of his friend Johnny Dee to replace drummer Chris Branco in the Doro Pesch's touring band, where he was the keyboard player. In 2005, Retrospect Records released the two albums of Mariah, the second with Johnny Dee on drums. In 2007, the same label released another album of the band titled III, featuring again Dee. The fast commercial decline of glam metal acts in favor of grunge and alternative rock, caused the dissolution of many bands like Britny Fox, leaving their members unemployed. Dee was lucky to have found jobs as musician in Europe with Doro, who was a still a successful and charting artist in Germany, and in the US East Coast with LeCompt, a cover band formed by former Tangier vocalist Mike LeCompt which included also Billy Childs on bass. He recorded with Doro the live album Doro Live (1993) and several studio albums, remaining to this day the official drummer of the band. He also served as tour manager for Doro's US tours. In the 90s, when not engaged in European tours with Doro or with LeCompt, Dee worked with a third band that he had founded with Tommy Paris in Philadelphia, called Uncle Edna. They released a self-titled EP in 1996. In 2000, Britny Fox reformed and went on tour with Dee on drums, releasing the live album Long Way to Live! (2001) and their fourth studio album Springhead Motorshark in 2003. During the summer of 2002, Dee played on tour also with Blaze Bayley (ex-singer of Iron Maiden and Wolfsbane), in support to the American thrash metal band Overkill on a European tour. In 2003, Dee, along with bassist Billy Childs, worked on the solo project of guitarist Jack Frost (Savatage, Metalium), releasing the album Raise Your Fist to Metal. Dee was involved in a project to re-record classic UFO songs in 2006, along with former UFO and Waysted guitarist Paul Chapman and the former lead singer of MSG Robin McAuley. In 2008, Britny Fox officially announced a new line-up, without Johnny Dee on drums. A new reunion was announced again in 2010 by former singer Dean Davidson, without the previous agreement of the other band members.

Her class were fitted with 2 sets of triple- expansion steam engines, and in Spankers case these were built by G E Bayliss & Co. She was fitted at build with locomotive boilers, but these were replaced with water-tube Du Temple boilers some time between 1895 and 1898. The bottom of these boilers, unlike normal Du Temple boilers, were cylindrical with end doors, instead of with bolted covers. Twin screws propelled her at up to with forced draught.

On 8 March 1908 Spanker was on passage from Portsmouth to Sheerness where she was to join up with ships of the Nore Division of the Home Fleet for Naval exercises when her engines failed off Bembridge on the Isle of Wight. While under tow back to Portsmouth, she ran aground off Southsea Castle, and was not freed until the next day.

Born and raised in Ciudad Obreg√≥n, Castro Luque ran for office in his municipality and was elected as a state legislature for Sonora in the Congress of Mexico on 1 July 2012. Before running for office, he had served as the marketing manager of the Yaquis de Obreg√≥n baseball team in his hometown and was working at his privately owned publicity agency. On 14 September 2012, two days before entering office, he was gunned down outside his home by gunmen. He was later pronounced dead at a local hospital. Northern Mexico has been the scene of violent confrontations between Mexico's drug gangs. The recent wave of violence in Ciudad Obreg√≥n is attributed to the Sinaloa Cartel and the Beltr√°n-Leyva Cartel, which fight for the control of retail drug sales and the smuggling routes leading to the United States. Personal life Eduardo Enrique Castro Luque was born on 12 December 1963 in the Mexican northern city of Ciudad Obreg√≥n, Sonora. He was married to Rossana Coboj and had one boy named Eduardo. He held a bachelor's degree in Business administration from the Sonora Institute of Technology. The 48-year-old politician had never held a political office before he was elected on 1 July 2012. Prior to running for office, Castro Luque owned a publicity agency and was the marketing manager of the Yaquis de Obreg√≥n baseball team in his hometown. Assassination Initial reports stated that on 14 September 2012 at around 20:55 local time, Castro Luque was returning home at Chapultepec neighborhood in the city of Ciudad Obreg√≥n, Sonora. Unaware of the assailant, the deputy-elect got out of his car and made a few steps towards the house entrance when an unknown gunman shot at him nine times, hitting vital organs. Nonetheless, according to the investigation of the Office of the General Prosecutor in Sonora (PJGE), the gunman faked a malfunction in his motorcycle when Castro Luque was coming back from a meeting held in Hermosillo prior to his installation as a state deputy. The assassin then asked Castro Luque for tool support and then shot him at close range. Once they had materialized the attack, the killer fled the scene in a motorcycle. Castro Luque was taken to a local hospital by his wife and young son while still being alive, but was declared dead an hour later. He was scheduled to take office as a Sonora's state Legislature in just two days. The Municipal Police of Cajeme, Sonora reported that Castro Luque's front house door had been forced open and that some people had stolen his laptop a day before the assassination. At the scene, the Mexican police found six .45 millimeter bullet casings, as well as six warheads from the same caliber, that will help the Office of the General Prosecutor in Sonora (PGJE) as evidence for the investigation. =Funeral= At 3:00 p.m. during a religious ceremony in the Cathedral of Ciudad Obreg√≥n, friends, supporters, politicians, and several citizens of the municipality gathered to pay homage to Castro Luque. The Bishop Felipe Padilla celebrated mass with over 900 attendees. =Background= Since the start of Mexico's drug war, northern Mexico has been the scene of numerous battles between several drug trafficking organizations fighting for the control of the local drug markets and the smuggling routes leading to the United States. The municipality of Cajeme, Sonora ‚Äì where Castro Luque was killed ‚Äì is reportedly under dispute between two drug groups: the Sinaloa Cartel and the Beltr√°n-Leyva Cartel. In August 2012, √âdgar Morales P√©rez, the mayor-elect of a town in San Luis Potos√≠, was ambushed and killed by gunmen before taking office. Just like Castro Luque, Morales P√©rez was a member of the Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI). =Investigation and arrests= The Attorney General of Sonora established a special investigation group to carry out the inquiry of Castro Luque's assassination. On 24 September 2012, the PGJE indicated that Manuel Ernesto Fern√°ndez F√©lix, the substitute deputy of Ciudad Obreg√≥n, ordered the assassination of Castro Luque so he could go into office. In Mexico, political candidates have to appoint a person to take over their duties if they die or are unable to serve. Sonora authorities accused Fern√°ndez F√©lix of paying a hitman more than $3000 to carry out the attack and of paying around $750 to the person who helped him find the assassin. Fern√°ndez F√©lix is currently a fugitive, while the other five implicated in the assassination are arrested. The Interpol, along with authorities in Mexico and the United States, are currently looking for the substitute deputy in over 190 countries. Several water-rights activists, however, question the theory of the Mexican prosecutors that the assassination was carried out by Castro Luque's substitute. The activists of the Citizen Movement for Water stated that Castro Luque had launched a massive political campaign against a water project in Ciudad Obreg√≥n, and criticized the state government for constructing an aqueduct despite the judicial orders to suspend it. They allege that since the state of Sonora is ruled by the National Action Party (PAN), the investigation is too biased to be executed properly. Politicians in the Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI) also expressed their doubts on the theory of the state prosecutors of the PAN administration.

Early career Wright is first mentioned as lieutenant aboard Baltimore in 1665. In 1666, he was on board , flagship of George Monck, 1st Duke of Albemarle. With this ship he took part in two naval engagements of the Second Anglo‚ÄìDutch War: the Four Days' Battle and the St. James's Day Battle. Captain and commodore Wright is said to have been almost continuously employed during the next twenty years of peace and war, but the details of his services cannot be accurately traced. Those given by Charnock are not entirely trustworthy and some of them appear very doubtful. He is said to have taken up the post of captain from 1672. On the accession of James II of England in 1685, Wright was appointed to command the yacht Mary. In March 1687 was moved into , which carried Christopher Monck, 2nd Duke of Albemarle, to Jamaica. Albemarle died within a year of his taking up the governorship and Wright returned to England with the corpse. He arrived at the end of May 1689. Tour of the West Indies =Crossing= The following October (1689), Wright was appointed to the 60-gun ship as commodore and commander-in-chief of an expedition to the West Indies. He was ordered to fly the union flag at the main.Admiralty Minute, 6 Feb 1689‚Äì90 His instructions were 'to act according to the directions of General Codrington in all things relating to the land service,' and 'in enterprises at sea to act as should be advised by the governor and councils of war, when he had opportunity of consulting them.' He was, 'when it was necessary, to spare as many seamen as he could with regard to the safety of the ships,' and he was not 'to send any ship from the squadron until the governor and council were informed of it and satisfied that the service did not require their immediate attendance.'cf. Secretary's Letters, iii. 21, December 1689 The squadron set sail from Plymouth on 8 March 1690. It consisted of eight smaller two-decked ships, a few larger frigates, and fire ships. After a stormy passage the squadron reached Barbados on 11 May, with the ships' companies very sickly. =Support of Codrington= It was not until the end of the month that Wright could go on to Antigua and join Codrington, who combined the two functions of governor of the Leeward Islands and commander-in-chief of the land forces. It was resolved to attack St. Christopher by sea and land, and St. Christopher was reduced with very little loss. English forces also took possession of St. Eustatius. In August the squadron went to Barbados for the hurricane months. In October, Wright rejoined Codrington at St. Christopher, and it was resolved to attack Guadeloupe. However, while preparations were being made, Wright received orders from home to return to England. He accordingly went to Barbados, which he reached on 30 December. The want of stores and provisions delayed him there, and before he was ready to sail counter-orders reached him, directing him to remain and cooperate with Codrington. Wright's squadron was not in fighting trim. He had sent two ships to Jamaica; two others had sailed for England in charge of convoy; and the remaining vessels with him were deteriorating, leaking badly, and with their lower masts sprung. To strengthen his squadron as much as possible, he hired several merchant ships into the service. However, it was the middle of February 1691 before he could put to sea. =Quarrel with Codrington= When Wright's naval forces at last joined Codrington at St. Christopher's, a serious quarrel between the two threatened to put a stop to all further operations. The details of the quarrel were never made public, but it may be assumed that it sprang out of the ill-defined relations between the two men, and the probable confusion in the minds of both regarding the governor and the general. General Codrington was, in fact, only a colonel in the army and it is probable that Wright saw the distinction as marked in his instructions more clearly than Codrington did. Whatever the cause, the quarrel seems to have been very bitter on both sides. =Failure at Guadeloupe= However, after some delays, the attack on Guadeloupe was attempted. Troops landed on the island on 21 April 1691 but little progress had been made by 14 May. On report of a French squadron in the neighbourhood, Wright went to sea, came in sight of it, and chased it. As his ships were foul and some of them jury-rigged, the enemy easily outsailed him. Finding his pursuit useless, Wright recalled his ships and returned to Guadeloupe, when it was resolved to give up the attack. Wright avowedly gave up the attack in consequence of great sickness among his ships' companies and troops. On the other hand, it is possible that Wright, and perhaps even Codrington, realised that the appearance of the French squadron threatened England's absolute command of the sea, which was a primary condition of success.Colomb, pp. 255‚Äì6. The squadron returned to Barbados, where Wright himself was struck down by the sickness. On the urgent advice of the medical men, he turned the command over to the senior captain, Robert Arthur, and took passage to England. In the West Indies, feelings ran extremely high. Most of the officials and military men, taking the side of Codrington, attributed the failure at Guadeloupe to Wright's disaffection or cowardice. The merchants, whose trade had been severely scourged by the enemy's privateers, were kept together by the governor's orders to support the attacks on the French islands; they attributed their losses to Wright's carelessness, if not treachery, and clamoured for his punishment. =Court-martial= Numerous accusations followed Wright to England, and he was formally charged 'with mismanagement, disaffection to the service, breach of instructions, and other misdemeanors.' Charnock says that there was neither trial nor investigation, but this is erroneous. On 20 May 1693 the joint admirals presided at a court- martial. Upon 'duly examining the witnesses upon oath,' after 'mature deliberation upon the whole matter,' and 'in consideration that Mr. Hutcheson, late secretary to the governor, was the chief prosecutor, and in regard of the many differences that did appear to have happened betwixt the governor and Captain Wright,' the presiding officers gave opinion that 'the prosecution was not grounded on any zeal or regard to their majesties' service, but the result of particular resentments,' that it was 'in a great measure a malicious prosecution,‚Äô and they resolved that Wright was 'not guilty of the charge laid against him.' The influence of the accusers was, however, so strong that the sentence of the court was virtually set aside, and Wright had no further employment for nine years. Later career After the accession of Queen Anne, Wright was appointed on 14 May 1702 as Commissioner of the Navy, Kinsale , Ireland. He subsequently was moved to the Navy Board as extra commissioner on 8 May 1713. Death Wright died in London on 27 November 1713.

Ground was broken on the park in September 2008. Opened in November 2009, the park cost approximately $3.4 million to build. Formerly, the site was a parking lot. Following September 11, 2001, the lot was used as a staging area for search and rescue operations. In the following weeks members of the public placed flowers, cards and letters at the site, as it was one of the closest points to the former World Trade Center which was accessible. The park features a 114-foot fountain designed by local artist Elyn Zimmerman which refers to the canal which formerly ran along the path of Canal Street. In 2007 the design concept was recognized for Excellence in Design by the New York City Public Design Commission. The original name, CaVaLa, referred to the streets surrounding the park (\\"Canal-Varick-Laight\\"), and was described by one nearby resident as \\"kitschy\\". A few months after it opened, a movement was started to rename the park after Tribeca restaurateur and community activist Albert Capsouto who had recently died.

The number of fatalities was a consequence of the building retaining barred windows, a feature remaining from its previous use as a whisky bond. Around 100 firemen from Glasgow Fire Service attended this incident, which reinforced Glasgow's reputation for tragic fires in the 30 years after the Second World War. Many of these fires resulted from poor building standards, with many premises being modified from their original purpose. Glasgow city centre did not suffer from wartime bombing to the extent of other British cities, and consequently, many industrial premises were still of nineteenth- century origin, and were located in cramped and narrow streets. Stern furniture upholstery factory The factory premises was located in James Watt Street, a street between Argyle Street and the Broomielaw on the north side of the River Clyde. The building consisted of a ground, first, and second floors, with basement. Julius and Samuel Stern ran the upholstery business, B Stern Ltd., on the upper floors. A glass company, G. Bryce, occupied the basement and part of the ground floor. The building had previously been used as a whisky bond (a warehouse used for storage before excise duty has been paid) and, in common with many of Glasgow's industrial premises, had seen numerous changes of use. The previous use of the building involved high security measures including barred windows, meaning that, in the event of a fire, escape could be compromised. In the following enquiry, it was discovered that the doors to the fire escape were locked from the inside. The fire The alarm was raised at around 10:30, with the first crews arriving within five minutes. A serious fire was seen to be in progress and a \\"Make Pumps 10\\" message was sent to control almost immediately (additional appliances required, which in addition to those already there would total 10). As part of this request for reinforcements, a \\"Persons Reported\\" message was sent, indicating persons were requiring urgent assistance and rescue. 70 firemen attended to fight the fire, with water poured onto the building from turntable ladders. It was found that efforts at rescue were futile due to the intense heat and the difficulties in entering the building. Escape from the building had been prevented due to fire on the stairs, caused by polyurethane foam, and the escape doors from the first and second floors to the fire escape were found to have been locked from the inside. Eventually, no persons were seen at the windows, and any hopes of rescue for those inside ended when the roof of the building collapsed. Many attempts were made to enter the building where the employees were believed to be but intense heat drove back the firemen. The Glasgow Fire Service personnel eventually gained access to the building, by cutting through the steel doors using oxy-propane cutting gear. The fire was brought under control around 3pm by which time 20 bodies had been found. A further 2 were found later, totaling 22. 5 women and 17 men. Only 4 people of those known to be in the building escaped. The dead found inside the factory were judged to have died due to the inhalation of smoke, the burning of polyurethane foam resulting in poisonous fumes.

G. Wells that argues for the knowability of the future. It was originally delivered to the Royal Institution on January 24, 1902. Before appearing in book form, it was published by Richard Gregory in Nature on February 6, 1902,Norman and Jeanne Mackenzie, H.G. Wells: A Biography (Simon & Schuster, 1973), p. 161. and was also published as part of the Annual Report of the Smithsonian Institution.Michael Sherborne, H.G. Wells: Another Kind of Life (Peter Owen, 2010), p. 154. Available online. Synopsis Wells begins by distinguishing between \\"two divergent types of mind,\\" one that judges and attaches importance principally to what has happened in the past and one that judges and attaches importance principally to what will happen in the future. To the former he attributes the adjectives \\"legal or submissive,\\" \\"passive,\\" and \\"oriental,\\" and to the latter the adjectives \\"legislative, creative, organizing, or masterful,\\" and \\"active,\\" calling it \\"a more modern and much less abundant type of mind.\\"H.G. Wells, The Discovery of the Future (New York: B.W. Huebsch, 1913), pp. 6-7. Observing that these two minds reach \\"divergent and incompatible consequences\\" in the spheres of morality and public affairs, Wells analyzes the reasons for which the past-oriented mind predominates and asserts that this is principally due to the evidently greater knowability of the personal past as compared to the future. But he argues that the inference from this attitude that the future is essentially unknowable does not square with \\"modern science, that is to say the relentless systematic criticism of phenomena.\\"H.G. Wells, The Discovery of the Future (New York: B.W. Huebsch, 1913), pp. 27-28. Not only has science made us knowledgeable about a distant, impersonal past, it also regards the ability successfully to predict to be a criterion of validity. Though the unpredictability of human behavior complicates the problem, the fact that \\"as individuals increase in number they begin to average out\\" means that \\"an inductive knowledge of a great number of things in the future is becoming a human possibility.\\"H.G. Wells, The Discovery of the Future (New York: B.W. Huebsch, 1913), pp. 39; 33. Confessing himself to be among \\"those who believe entirely in the forces behind the individual\\" rather than in individuals themselves as determining causes, Wells argues that there is \\"no reason why we should not aspire to, and discover and use, safe and servicable, generalizations upon countless issues in the human destiny.\\"H.G. Wells, The Discovery of the Future (New York: B.W. Huebsch, 1913), p. 40. But personal prophecy and fortune-telling will never be possible; \\"the knowledge of the future we may hope to gain will be general and not individual.\\"H.G. Wells, The Discovery of the Future (New York: B.W. Huebsch, 1913), p. 46. Wells devotes the last part of his text to speculations about \\"the question what is to come after man,\\" considering it \\"the most persistently fascinating and the most insoluble question in the whole world.\\"H.G. Wells, The Discovery of the Future (New York: B.W. Huebsch, 1913), p. 50. He concludes with a statement of personal faith \\"in the coherency and purpose in the world and in the greatness of human destiny.\\"H.G. Wells, The Discovery of the Future (New York: B.W. Huebsch, 1913), p. 56. Background Wells's lecture followed on the heels of the great success of his recent book, Anticipations (1901), based on a series of articles commissioned in 1900 by W.L. Courtney for the Fortnightly Review, but the original invitation to lecture to the Royal Institution had come in 1899.Norman and Jeanne Mackenzie, H.G. Wells: A Biography (Simon & Schuster, 1973), pp. 161-62. The full title of the volume was Anticipations of the Reaction of Mechanical and Scientific Progress Upon Human Life and Thought. According to Graham Wallas, Wells's delivery of his lecture was too rapid, but it was well received and contributed to the rapid integration of the 35-year-old Wells into the literary and intellectual elite of London in 1902.Michael Sherborne, H.G.

It is one of the oldest museums in the city, situated within the Golden Triangle of Art. Following the example of the Victoria and Albert Museum in London, it illustrates the evolution of industrial or \\"minor arts\\", including furniture, ceramics, glass, and textiles. The collections emphasize the 16th and 17th centuries in particular; its collection contains approximately 70,000 pieces. Its 62 exhibition rooms are within a palace near the Jardines del Retiro de Madrid. The museum received 71,472 visitors in 2017. History The National Museum of Decorative Arts was established by Royal Decree in 1912, under the name of National Museum of Industrial Arts. It followed a precedent during the reign of Amadeo I of Spain, when an Industrial Museum was established. In its first stage, the institution was geared towards research rather than tourism. It was a place of learning for artisans, manufacturers and designers, similar to the Victoria and Albert Museum in London and the Mus√©e des Arts D√©coratifs in Paris. Its emphasis has been the 16th and 17th centuries. The museum has collaborated with other nations, such as when, in 1933, it invited Mexico to present an artistic exhibition. Architecture The museum was initially located in a building on Sacramento Street in El Madrid de los Austrias where it occupied six rooms. In 1932, it moved to its current site on Montalb√°n Street, between the Paseo del Prado and Retiro Park, in a 19th-century mansion, built by the Duchess of Santo√±a in the 1880s. In 1909 the building became a teacher-training school. The building was purchased by the State in 1941, which allowed some initial renovation. The building and collections were declared a Bien de Inter√©s Cultural building in 1962. The museum has 62 rooms spread over five floors. Collections The National Museum of Decorative Arts is one of the largest and most richly appointed in Madrid. It houses collections of great interest, both ethnographic and of artistic craftsmanship of ceramics, furniture, jewelry, textiles, and Oriental arts. Of the 40,000 objects collected, about 15,000 pieces are loaned out to other museums, including the Real F√°brica de Cristales de La Granja. The museum focuses on Spanish decorative arts, but includes examples from other countries, mostly ceramics and luxury items imported from an early date. Several of the rooms recreate scenes from the past, using original furnishings and other pieces; there are examples of 18th-century kitchens. The furniture collection is well represented from the 14th century, a period in which the furniture was very poor and those piece which remain are rarities. The gothic to baroque collection is the best there is in a Spanish public museum, and the collections of National Heritage are mostly of the 18th century and later. Pieces include writing desks, seats, and furniture in various types. The Oriental Arts collection emphasizes the porcelains of the Ming (1368-1644) and Qing (1644-1912) dynasties. Some pieces were created in China on behalf of Spanish families and feature their arms. The Oriental collection also includes Chinese imperial robes, musical instruments, scroll paintings, and bronzes. The ceramics section houses approximately 4,000 pieces made of clay, pottery and porcelain. The oldest is an 11th-century jar from Toledo. There are examples of the works from some of Spain's main producers: Manises, Talavera de la Reina, El Puente del Arzobispo, and Cer√°mica de Teruel. The Spanish porcelain section includes pieces from the Porcelana de Alcora, Real F√°brica del Buen Retiro, and Royal Factory of La Moncloa. There are also pieces from almost all other notable European manufactures, such as S√®vres, Limoges, and Capodimonte, as well as marked and signed socarrat tiles. The glass collection is vast, ranging from 4th-century BC Greece, to the Roman Empire and the Visigoths. Ceramic fragments from Seville date to the 11th-12th century, and Persian ceramics from the 14th-16th century. There are unique pieces of Ren√© Lalique and Real F√°brica de Cristales de La Granja from the period of 1727 through 1823. Textiles includes clothing (civil and religious) and household furnishings. including silk from 15th century Granada. There are pieces form the 2nd century through the present. Cloth types include damask, velvet, embroidery (including Moroccan and Arabic), lace, and these are fashioned into fans, purses, and dance cards. Carpets from Cuenca and Alcaraz of the 15th through to the 17th centuries are very rare and are examples of some of the best publicly owned pieces. The museum also has a metalware collection with a range of items from Saharan bracelets and Moroccan fibulas to Turkish inkpots (18th-19th century) and Korean cases.

Completed in 1724 by U Kala, a historian at the Toungoo court, it was the first chronicle to synthesize all the ancient, regional, foreign and biographic histories related to Burmese history. Prior to the chronicle, the only known Burmese histories were biographies and comparatively brief local chronicles. The chronicle has formed the basis for all subsequent histories of the country, including the earliest English language histories of Burma written in the late 19th century.Myint-U 2001: 80Lieberman 1986: 236 The chronicle starts with the beginning of the current world cycle according to Buddhist tradition and the Buddhist version of ancient Indian history, and proceeds \\"with ever increasing detail to narrate the political story of the Irrawaddy basin from quasi- legendary dynasties to events witnessed by the author himself in 1711.\\" Since it was written in the late Toungoo period, the chronicle provides its most specific information on dates and descriptions of various events Toungoo kings partook.Hla Pe 1985: 38 The chronicle's portrayal of the 16th century Toungoo Burma, which was also witnessed by many Europeans, has been found by scholars to be largely factual.Lieberman 1986: 236‚Äì255 However, its narrative of the earlier periods is less detailed, showing that the author did not have the full versions of earlier chronicles. Moreover, he did not check any inscriptions, which would have yielded more specific dates and double-checked the events.Hla Pe 1985: 46‚Äì47 Nonetheless, the pre-1712 portions of later national Burmese chronicles ‚Äî including Yazawin Thit, Maha Yazawin Kyaw, and Hmannan Yazawin ‚Äî are essentially verbatim reproductions of this chronicle, though the later chronicles did correct many of Maha Yazawin's Pagan Dynasty and pre-Pagan dates based on epigraphic evidence.Thaw Kaung 2010: 44‚Äì49 Background Before this chronicle, hitherto Burmese histories were biographic chronicles and comparatively brief local chronicles. The compilation of the chronicle began c. 1712‚Äì1720, early in the reign of King Taninganway. The task was undertaken by U Kala, a wealthy descendant of court and regional administrative officers from both sides of his family. (His father was a \\"rich man\\" who descended from regional administrative officers (myosas) of the crown, and his mother was of mixed Shan and Burman noble descent.) He had the education, connections and wealth to devote his time to chronicle writing. With his pedigree, he apparently had access to court documents that went back to the reign of Bayinnaung (r. 1550‚Äì1581).Aung-Thwin 2005: 136 Perhaps because of his wealth, Kala was able to devote his time being a \\"full-time chronicler\\". Composition Kala prefaced his chronicle with an apology for its writing, noting that Buddhist scriptures considered the writing of history to be inimical to religious development. He justified his work by explaining that the study of past events would help to demonstrate the impermanence of all things, including political authority, and that meditation on this theme would actually promote religious insight. When Kala completed the chronicle in 1724, he had compiled the chronicle in three versions by length: Maha Yazawin Gyi [The Great Chronicle in Twenty-One Volumes], Yazawin Lat [The Shorter Chronicle in Ten Volumes], Yazawin Gyok [The Brief Chronicle in One Volume].Maha Yazawin Vol. 1 2006: 30‚Äì31; in Preface by Kyaw Nyein, Director of the Universities History Research The chronicle is said to have referenced court documents from the 16th century, and in all, over 70 regional and foreign texts. The notable list includes the \\"Thaton Chronicle,\\" the \\"Mon Chronicle,\\" the \\"Ayutthaya Chronicle,\\" and the \\"Chiang Mai Chronicle\\" as well as the Mahavamsa for the early religious history.Aung-Thwin 2005: 137‚Äì138 Though he used a variety of local chronicles, Kala did not include the history of Tagaung Kingdom, which would be claimed as the beginning of the Burmese monarchy a century later by Hmannan Yazawin.(Maha Yazawin Vol. 1 2006: 36): In Preface by Maung Thaw The work is divided into three parts, the first two detailing the origin of the universe and Buddhist kings of ancient India. The third part relates the founding of Threhkittara and Pagan and proceeds to provide accounts of the Pinya, Sagaing, Ava and Toungoo dynasties, and takes the history down to his own time to 1711. A \\"salient characteristic\\" of the chronicle is \\"its composite character: the chronicle is a pastiche of legends, local histories, biographies, and detailed court records.\\" Accuracy Since it was written in the late Toungoo period, Maha Yazawin provides its most specific information on dates and descriptions of various events Toungoo kings partook. It traces the life of each king chronologically, wherever possible, from his birth to the grave or his dethronement.Hla Pe 1985: 38 However, its narrative of the earlier periods is far more sketchy, offering only the year, not the specific date, in most cases. It shows that Kala did not have the full versions of earlier chronicles, and that he did not check any inscriptions, which would have yielded more specific dates and double-checked the events.Hla Pe 1985: 46‚Äì47 Indeed, the later chronicles corrected many of Maha Yazawin's Pagan Dynasty and pre-Pagan dates based on epigraphic evidence. Moreover, the chronicle also introduces for the first time that the Thaton Kingdom of Lower Burma was conquered by King Anawrahta of Pagan in 1057, and Anawrahta's religious reformation with the help of Shin Arahan, the primate of Pagan. (Maha Yazawin does not say that Shin Arahan was from Thaton. That he was born in Thaton was inserted in Yazawin Thit, written in 1798.Aung-Thwin 2005: 142) Later British colonial period scholars further asserted that Pagan received religious reforms and civilization from Thaton. Recently, the historian Michael Aung- Thwin has argued that the Thaton conquest story cannot be found in any prior extant texts or inscriptions.See (Aung-Thwin 2005); the entire book is devoted to the topic. However, the chronicle's portrayal of the 16th century Toungoo Burma, which was also witnessed by many Europeans, has been found by scholars to be largely factual. Significance The chronicle has formed the basis for all subsequent histories of the country, including the earliest English language histories of Burma written in the late 19th century. The historian Victor Lieberman writes that \\"rarely has a national historiographic tradition depended so heavily on a single author as the Burmese tradition has on U Kala.\\" The chronicle's existence was especially made important because many of the original sources on which he relied were destroyed by a fire at Ava (Inwa) some twenty years later. In addition to this loss, U Kala's prose style was seen as a model in the eyes of all subsequent historians. The general tone of the chronicle is described as \\"not bombastic\\", \\"relatively subdued\\", and \\"matter-of-fact\\". The pre-1712 portions of later national Burmese chronicles ‚Äî including Yazawin Thit (1798), Maha Yazawin Kyaw (1831), and the famous Hmannan Yazawin (the Glass Palace Chronicle) ‚Äî are more or less verbatim reproductions of Maha Yazawin, \\"with some interpolations of quasi-legendary material and with limited digressions on points of scholarly dispute\\". Publications As of 2006, the chronicle had been published only in Burmese, and not translated in full into English or any other language.

It has a single fleshy leaf and a thin wiry flowering spike bearing two white flowers with red bars on the labellum. In New Zealand this orchid is sometimes known as Caladenia lyallii. Description Caladenia alpina is a terrestrial, perennial, deciduous, herb with an underground tuber and a single, sparsely hairy, lance-shaped leaf, long and wide. The leaf is thick and fleshy and green to dark reddish-green. One to three flowers, usually two, are borne on a spike up to high and are about in diameter. The dorsal sepal is a broad egg shape wide and curves forward to form a hood over the column. The petals and lateral sepals are broad, long and are white and glabrous on the front and pinkish red to maroon with glandular hairs on the back. The labellum is about long when flattened, white with dark red to purple spots and lines with a wavy margin, a few short teeth and a pointed tip. There are four well-spaced rows of calli on the surface of the labellum. The calli are club-shaped, yellow or whitish becoming darker and shorter towards the tip of the labellum. The column is about long with broad wings and has red spots or streaks.Caladenia alpina - labelled image Taxonomy and naming Caladenia alpina was first formally described by Richard Sanders Rogers in 1927 and the description was published in Transactions and Proceedings of the Royal Society of South Australia. Rogers described the species from specimens collected on Mount Bogong and Mount Hotham in Victoria and from Mount Kosciuszko in New South Wales. The specific epithet (alpina) is a Latin word meaning \\"of high mountains\\". In New Zealand the species is known as Caladenia lyallii although \\"some orchidologists\\" suggest that both C. lyallii and C. alpina occur in that country. The epithet (lyallii) honours the Scottish botanist David Lyall, who was a friend of Joseph Hooker. Caladenia alpina is regarded as a synonym of Caladenia lyallii by the Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew. Caladenia lyallii was first formally described by Joseph Dalton Hooker in Flora Novae-Zelandiae. Distribution and habitat Alpine caladenia usually grows in subalpine zones above in forest, Snow Gum woodland and herbfields or near ponds and bogs. In New South Wales it occurs on the Southern Tablelands south of the Brindabella Range and in Victoria on the Great Dividing Range and Grampians. In New Zealand, Caladenia lyallii occurs on both the North and South Islands as well as on Stewart Island.

Patrick was a printer and typesetter by trade. She became active in politics, when she joined the Glasgow Anarchist Group by 1914. She was also a partner of Guy Aldred‚Äôs for some thirty years until his death. Patrick with other anarchists had an ambivalent attitude towards the formation of the Communist Party of Great Britain (CPGB), and along with Aldred, she helped form the Anti-Parliamentary Communist Federation (APCF) a breakaway group. The key points of contention were the proposed use, by the new group, of parliament and its relationship to the Labour Party. This is seen as a left-wing break from the communist movement and Comintern's view is best encapsulated in Lenin's \\"Left-Wing\\" Communism: An Infantile Disorder with its comments chiefly directed at Sylvia Pankhurst. Patrick and others were simply carrying on a popular tradition which had been developed through the politics of the Socialist League and the struggles of syndicalism in Britain prior to the inception of the CPGB. With the setting up of the APCF, the authorities began to investigate the group, and Aldred, Patrick, Douglas McLeish and Andrew Fleming were eventually arrested and charged with sedition within the first year of its inception. Patrick along with others was eventually found guilty and given a sentence of three months. The charges relate to anti- parliamentary activity, the promotion of the Sinn F√©in electoral tactic and undermining of parliament. In 1924 Aldred and Patrick helped set up a journal called The Commune. In 1934, along with Aldred, Patrick set up the United Socialist Movement (USM), an anarcho-communist organisation which helped publish a journal called The Word. Both Ethel MacDonald and Patrick went to Spain at the outbreak of the Spanish Civil War as respective representatives of their groups. MacDonald appears to have been representing the USM and Patrick the APCF, since she was also a member of that. In Spain, Patrick ended up in Madrid editing the English-language version of Frente Libertario. By 1937 she had moved to Barcelona, helping with the Confederaci√≥n Nacional del Trabajo's (CNT) radio bulletin. Her and Ethel's firsthand encounter with the Barcelona May Days was reported by Aldred, but she returned to Glasgow by 1937. After returning before the course of the war, Patrick along with others would establish The Strickland Press.

Accessed 18 April 2015 Critics of the term have described its users as making \\"an attack on Welsh speakers.\\" Author Patrick McGuinness has described the term as \\"generating a culture of envy\\" and \\"tribalism and divisiveness\\" in Welsh society. Opposing Conservative politicians at the time responded to his comments by stating the term is merely \\"challenging a cosy consensus within the arts world in Wales.\\" Political use Among English speaking political commentators, the theory is often employed to suggest the existence of a Welsh-speaking elite whose interests are opposed to those of the majority of the Welsh people. Academic Richard Wyn Jones has argued that fear of such a supposed Welsh-speaking elite was characteristic of anti-devolutionists in the 1979 Welsh devolution referendum: The term is sometimes used in political discourse in Wales. As First Minister of Wales, the Labour politician Rhodri Morgan stated that Wales would have 'Cynulliad y werin, nid Cynulliad y crachach' ('an Assembly of the people, not an Assembly of the crachach'). In 2010, Welsh Labour education minister Leighton Andrews criticized the Higher Education sector in Wales for not contributing to Welsh prosperity levels: 'For too many in Wales, higher education remains a distant, and irrelevant activity, clouded in mystery [...] It appears that higher education governance in post-devolution Wales has become the last resting place of the crachach.' Use in the media The theory does not regularly arise in the English- language media in Wales. However since the development of the National Assembly for Wales in the late 1990s and the legislature's policy of increasing the number of Welsh speakers, it has been used in debate often by critics of the language and of devolution more broadly. Journalist Carolyn Hitt referred to the theory in an article written in the early 2000s, which she would later downplay as \\"tongue-in-cheek\\". When then Welsh Secretary, William Hague MP, in 1997 became engaged to marry a member of his staff Ffion Jenkins (the daughter of the one-time head of the Welsh Arts Council, Emyr Jenkins), Roger Dobson of the Independent wrote that Hague was marrying into the crachach. He quoted Rhodri Morgan as saying of Ffion Jenkins: References Welsh society Welsh words and phrases Corruption in Wales Nepotism Conspiracy theories in the United Kingdom ","title":"Crachach"},{"id":"37027163","text":"Gilbert Askey (March 9, 1925 ‚Äì April 9, 2014) was an American jazz trumpeter, composer, producer and musical director who was born in Austin, Texas, and emigrated to Australia in 1988. Personal life Askey was born in Austin, Texas, on March 9, 1925, but left at the age of 17. He completed two years of university on a medical scholarship. In 1980, he married an Australian woman whom he had first met in 1973 and the couple moved to Melbourne, Australia in 1988. Career Askey was considered to be \\"one of the architects of the legendary Motown sound\\". Berry Gordy often called Askey \\"The glue that kept everything together\\". Askey studied music at the Boston Conservatory of Music and the Harnett School of Music in New York. He performed with jazz musicians including Dizzy Gillespie, Miles Davis, Duke Ellington and Count Basie, and even did a duet with Billie Holiday. He worked as a musical director for many acts such as Diana Ross, both with and without The Supremes, the Four Tops, The Temptations, Stevie Wonder, The Jackson 5, Gladys Knight, Keni Burke and Linda Clifford. Askey played as a jazz trumpeter for almost 25 years before arriving at Motown Records to work as a musical director, producer, songwriter and musical arranger for such artists as Billy Eckstine, Gladys Knight, The Temptations, The Supremes, Martha Reeves and The Vandellas, Marvin Gaye and Stevie Wonder, The Jackson 5 and The Funk Brothers. Askey was also part of Motown's Artists Development crew that included Maxine Powell, Maurice King, Cholly Atkins and Harvey Fuqua. When Diana Ross became a solo performer, she hired Askey to be her Musical Director. He worked with her for 10 years and wrote the score for her first motion picture Lady Sings the Blues that earned him an Academy Awards nomination in 1972. In the mid and late 1970s, Askey worked with Curtis Mayfield, writing and arranging for his Curtom Record Company on recordings by Linda Clifford, The Jones Girls and Mayfield himself. When things got out hand during a show in Antwerp, Belgium, that starred the Four Tops, Askey leaped on the stage and played trumpet amazingly until the audience calmed down. Askey was the arranger and conductor for The Supremes during their successful runs at the Copa nightclub in New York. He pretty much put the whole show together. After moving to Australia in 1988, Askey returned to performing in 1993, and continued to perform right up to his death from lymphoma in Melbourne on April 9, 2014.\\"Austin native Gil Askey worked with Motown legends in long musical career\\" by Peter Blackstock, austin360, April 9, 2014 https://www.latimes.com/obituaries/la-me- passings-20140416,0,7654975.story In Melbourne, Askey taught and mentored young aspiring musicians.

In 1993, the year of Zappa's death, Steve Vai covered \\"Sofa\\" for Zappa's tribute album Zappa's Universe. The cover won a Grammy Award for Best Rock Instrumental Performance in 1994. This was Vai's first of three Grammies.  Appearances  Originally, \\"Sofa\\" was only performed in concert and was part of a longer composition around the Flo and Eddie era of Zappa's music, when Mark Volman pretended to be a sofa. In 1975, Sofa made its first album appearance on Frank Zappa's album One Size Fits All as an instrumental version and a vocal version (\\"Sofa No. 1\\" and \\"Sofa No. 2\\"). There is a huge sofa in the center of the album cover for \\"One Size Fits All\\", and the album's initials, \\"OSFA\\", can be re- arranged to spell \\"SOFA\\". In the same year, \\"Sofa No. 2\\" was released as a single in Germany and referred to as \\"Du bist mein Sofa\\". The same track as \\"Sofa No. 1\\", now only titled \\"Sofa\\", appeared on the 1976 live album Zappa in New York. On the album You Can't Do That on Stage Anymore, Vol. 1, \\"Sofa #1\\" contains the vocals and \\"Sofa #2\\" is the instrumental. On both One Size Fits All and You Can't Do That on Stage Anymore, Vol. 1, \\"Sofa No./#1\\" is track 3, while \\"Sofa No./#2\\" ends each album. It was also referred to as \\"Divan\\" on the album Playground Psychotics. \\"Sofa\\" is one of the most referenced Zappa songs throughout his discography. Lyrics and meaning The vocal version of \\"Sofa\\" contains lyrics in both German and English. According to critics, because it contains German it stood out the most on the album. The English lyrics sing about being various parts of nature (the heavens, the water, the clouds), while the lyrics in German explain how they are \\"the sofa's chrome dinette\\" and \\"all days and all nights\\". \\"Sofa\\" was a result of Zappa's fascination with the German people as he toured in Europe.

Born in Pleyber-Christ, France, Le Jeune entered an Oblate seminary in Nancy, France, in 1873 and took his vows on 12 December 1875. He volunteered for missionary service and in 1879 was sent to New Westminster, British Columbia, Canada. Under the supervision of Bishop Paul Durieu, Le Jeune studied Chinook Jargon, a pidgin of Chinookan, Nootkan, French, and English. He moved on to Fraser Canyon, where he learned more native languages, and then to St. Mary's mission in the Lower Fraser Valley. Over the next years Le Jeune traveled throughout the Kamloops region proselytizing to the native communities. In 1891 he became rector of St. Joseph's Church on the Kamloops Reserve and in 1893 he became the superior of St. Louis's Mission, a post he held until 1929. By his own account, Le Jeune spoke more than twenty native languages. In 1890 he adapted Duployan shorthand to Chinook Jargon. The system was widely adopted among the native community and in 1891 Le Jeune launched a newspaper written in English and Chinook Jargon called the Kamloops Wawa. Le Jeune wrote a number of pamphlets about native languages such as Practical Chinook vocabulary (1886), Prayers in the Okanagan language (1893), Polyglott manual of prayers (1896, contributor), and Chinook rudiments (1924). Le Jeune died in 1930 at New Westminster and is buried at Mission. Lac Le Jeune, near Logan Lake, bears his name.

Criticism The awards have drawn criticism from several quarters, especially as regards the ages of the nominees. In December 2011, Chude Jideonwo released a statement, stating: ‚ÄúWe certainly have had more than a few complaints about the ages of one or two nominees. We sincerely appreciate those reactions and the fact that people feel so strongly about this awards process confirms to us that people believe in what we are doing... Over the years we have had to withdraw the nominations of a few nominees who have been unable to prove their actual ages; indeed, The Future Awards is one of the very few processes that actually demands proof of nominees‚Äô claims.‚Äù They announce a two-week complaint period, within which members of the public can email complaints about any nominee to the Central Working Committee about the age, substance of achievement, or any other claims by the nominees. In 2009, an email exchange between a dancer and a former winner of the award, Qudus Onikeke and Chude, leaked on the Sahara Reporters blog, as the former sought to clarify comments he had made -about the Young Person of the Year Award given to D'banj - in the year after his win, against the backdrop of the musician's controversial video for Suddenly.

Personal life Kae Tempest performing at Way Out West 2015 in Gothenburg, Sweden Tempest grew up in Brockley, South East London, one of five children. Tempest worked in a record shop from age 14 to 18. They went to Thomas Tallis School, leaving at 16 to study at the BRIT School for Performing Arts and Technology in Croydon, going on to graduate in English Literature from Goldsmiths, University of London. Tempest first performed when they were 16, at open mic nights at Deal Real, a small hip-hop store in Carnaby Street in London's West End. They went on to support acts such as John Cooper Clarke, Billy Bragg and Benjamin Zephaniah. They toured internationally with their band Sound of Rum until they disbanded in 2012 before being commissioned to write their first play, Wasted. In August 2020, Tempest announced that they identify as non- binary, and has changed their pronouns to they and them. At the same time, they also changed their name from Kate to Kae. Kae Tempest performs hip hop, namely their signature piece Let Them Eat Chaos, at the 2017 Treefort Music Fest in Boise, Idaho Career In 2013, Tempest released their first poetry book Everything Speaks in its Own Way, a limited edition run on their own imprint, Zingaro.

In October 2014, their first poetry collection for Picador, Hold Your Own, was published. The collection was a commercial and critical success and its release coincided with Tempest being named a Next Generation Poet.

Politics In November 2019, along with other public figures, Tempest signed a letter supporting Labour Party leader Jeremy Corbyn describing him as \\"a beacon of hope in the struggle against emergent far-right nationalism, xenophobia and racism in much of the democratic world\\" and endorsed him in the 2019 UK general election. In December 2019, along with 42 other leading cultural figures, they signed a letter endorsing the Labour Party under Corbyn's leadership in the 2019 general election. The letter stated that \\"Labour's election manifesto under Jeremy Corbyn's leadership offers a transformative plan that prioritises the needs of people and the planet over private profit and the vested interests of a few.\\" Reception The Economist said of Tempest's commission from the Royal Shakespeare Company: \\"A stunning piece by Kate Tempest, a London-born performance poet, comes bursting off the screen. Rarely has the relevance of Shakespeare to our language, to the very fabric of our feelings, been expressed with quite such youthful passion. (It should be mandatory viewing for all teenagers.)\\" The Huffington Post describes them as \\"Britain's leading young poet, playwright and rapper...one of the most widely respected performers in the country ‚Äì the complete package of lyrics and delivery. [They are] also one of the most exciting young writers working in Britain today\\" (2012). The Guardian commented of Brand New Ancients, \\"Suddenly it feels as if we are not in a theatre but a church... gathered around a hearth, hearing the age-old stories that help us make sense of our lives. We're given the sense that what we are watching is something sacred.\\" In 2013, the newspaper noted: > She is one of the brightest talents around. Her spoken-word performances > have the metre and craft of traditional poetry, the kinetic agitation of > hip-hop and the intimacy of a whispered heart-to-heart... Tempest deals > bravely with poverty, class and consumerism.

In 2013, they won the Ted Hughes Award for their work Brand New Ancients, the first person under the age of 40 to win the award, and was selected as one of the 2014 Next Generation Poets by the Poetry Society. Tempest has received wide critical acclaim for their written and live work. A performance of Brand New Ancients prompted the New York Times to say ‚ÄúAs gorgeous streams of words flow out, [they conjure] a story so vivid it‚Äôs as if you had a state-of-the- art Blu-ray player stuffed into your brain, projecting image after image that sears itself into your consciousness‚Äù while a review by Michiko Kakutani of their poetry collections in the same paper explored their written style: ‚ÄúWhile [their] intense performances on stage add a fierce urgency to the words, these text versions of [their] work stand powerfully on their own on the page...using [their] pictorial imagination to sear specific images into the reader‚Äôs mind‚Äù. They have been published in nine languages. Everybody Down was nominated for the 2015 Mercury Music Prize and Let Them Eat Chaos have been nominated for the 2017 Mercury Music Prize.

Inferior Church History In the ancient Roman era, the city baths and gymnasium of Neapolis were located in this area. In 1318, Sancia of Majorca, the queen consort of Robert, King of Naples, ceded some land to the lay Congregation of the Santissima Annunziata to establish an institution for care of foundlings. The original church was located at the site of the current hospital, since fragments of 14th-century frescoes of the school of Roberto d'Odirisio were found there. The Angevin church however was razed by 1513, when a larger church was started. the architect Ferdinando Manlio, was likely involved. The bell tower was commissioned by the Baron Troiano di Somma. Little survives of this church and its decoration; in 1757 a fire destroyed nearly all the church except for the sacristy, the chapel of the Treasury and the Carafa chapel. The next reconstruction followed a design by Luigi Vanvitelli, and was completed by his son Carlo. The church as we see it today was consecrated in 1774 and the concave facade added in 1782. Ferdinando Fuga helped rebuild the adjacent complex. The gray and white interior is a sober statement of \\"anti-Baroque\\", with a theme of coupled Corinthian columns under an unbroken entablature; paired ribs carry the columns upwards in skeletal semi-circular arches that articulate the coffered barrel vaulting. There are works by Giuseppe Sanmartino. Nave The Orphanage and its wheel (ruota) The church has always been associated, in one form or another, with an orphanage. The complex of buildings attached to the church are now part of a maternity and pediatric hospital. As an orphanage, it was equipped with a famous wheeled system on the wall, where abandoned infants, were placed into a revolving basket container from the street, and the basket could then be turned such that infant wound up within the church where nuns would then receive, baptize, and register the new addition to the orphanage. (The \\"basket room\\" has been restored and visitors may see how the operation was handled.) The existence of the wheel is documented by 1601. The system was abolished in the 1870s. The church functioned as an orphanage until the 1950s at which time state social services took over the task. Chapels The first chapel on the left houses a Piet√† attributed to Fabrizio Santafede. The second chapel on the left is dedicated to the Annunciation; the altarpiece was painted by Giacinto Diano. The third chapel on the left has an altarpiece depicting the Adoration by the Shepherds (1775) by the Genoese Francesco Narici. Of renown, and cult reverence, is the 14th century wooden sculpture of the Madonna de Repentiti. It is popularly known as ‚ÄúMamma Chiatta‚Äù. The first chapel on the right has an altarpiece of the Crucifixion (1774) by Fedele Fischetti. The chapel has the tomb of Francesco Mariconda (died 1626), noble and riding instructor of Phillip the fourth. Giuliano Finelli completed the sculpture. The second chapel on right has a canvas of the Virgin and Saints Januarius, Nicola, and others attributed to Giuseppe D'Amato.

It was intended as a rival to the Armalite AR-7. A .22 Magnum version identified by a tubular extension to the receiver was also made. An article on Guns.com has suggested that the Model 65 is actually a clone of the AR-7.The AR7 Air Force Survival Gun: For land, for air, for sea. Retrieved June 28, 2015. This claim is supported by allegations on some firearms forums that with a little work, many of the internal parts are interchangeable between the two. Overview The JGL Preetz Automat Model 65 was manufactured in West Germany. The receiver is made of zamac, a zinc-aluminum alloy. Like the AR-7, the barrel is retained by a hand tightened nut and is removable. Unlike the AR-7, it has a flat sided receiver and it was not intended to disassemble to pack into its own buttstock. It was offered in different barrel lengths with various handguards, stocks and pistol grips. It was offered in a conventional sporting rifle version and in variations that replicated the appearance of military arms such as the C96 Broomhandle Mauser, M1 Carbine and M1A1 Thompson submachine gun. Based on completed auction listings showing serial numbers, total production was in excess of 39,000 Model 65s of all types. There was a brief interruption in production in 1970 because of a West German law (later repealed) forbidding the production of civilian firearms that resembled military guns following the usage by the left-wing militant group Red Army Faction. Use Outside West Germany =Australia= The Model 65 has been banned for sale or ownership in Australia for two reasons. First, because it can be configured to resemble a Thompson submachine gun, which is banned under Australian law.Australia Firearms Regulations, 1974 edition, Section 24B(2)(c). Second, because it has been said its action can be modified to fire in full automatic mode. =Canada= Some Model 65s were imported to Canada as light sporting rifles in the late 1960s. =Northern Ireland= It has been alleged that during The Troubles, the Irish Republican Army modified these carbines so they would fire full-auto. =Philippines= The Philippines Constabulary is said to have purchased a quantity of Model 65s for use by its officers in the late 1960s.

It performed a similar role of other flamethrowers of the time, namely clearing enemy trenches and buildings in highly fortified areas. From 1942 to April 1945, 64,284 examples were produced. After 1945, flamethrowers gradually saw less usage, and the Bundeswehr does not use any. Similar to many other designs of the time, the FmW 41 used a hydrogen torch to ignite a tar and petrol mixture which was fired from a hand-held torch attached to a tank. The petrol and propellant were carried in separate tanks carried on the back which held 11.8 litres (2.6 imp gal; 3.1 US gal) of tar and petrol mixture called Flamm√∂l 19. The FmW 41 proved to be more reliable and easier to operate than its predecessor, it had an increased range of 32 metres (105 ft).https://web.archive.org/web/20090120044743/http://waffenhq.de/infanterie/flammenwerfer41.html and was lighter weighing in at 28.7 kilograms (63 lb). Problems surfaced against Soviet troops during the winter of 1941 as its lighting mechanism was unable to cope with the cold weather conditions. Later versions of the weapon replaced the hydrogen torch with a cartridge based system which proved more effective. Flamethrower troops are often targeted by enemy troops as they take a heavy psychological toll on enemy morale in addition to being effective weapons against well entrenched enemy troops. As such, these weapons were often dressed to look like standard infantry rifles in an attempt to disguise operators.http://www.militaryfactory.com/smallarms/detail.asp?smallarms_id=718  See also  *List of flamethrowers  References  World War II infantry weapons of Germany Flamethrowers ","title":"Flammenwerfer 41"},{"id":"37027308","text":"Werner Willi Max Eiselen (1899-1977) was a South African anthropologist and linguist.

It was shortlisted for the Jewish Quarterly-Wingate Prize (2013).Jewish Quarterly-Wingate Prize 2013  Plot  In the summer of 1994 the poet Joe Jacobs (Polish √©migr√© Jozef Nowogrodzki) is on vacation in a summer home in the south of France with his wife Isabel, his daughter Nina, and their friends, the couple Mitchell and Laura. The tranquillity is ruined when Joe's fan Kitty Finch turns up. Her fascination with, and sexual attraction to Joe are obvious, but Isabel invites her to stay anyway. Isabel is a foreign correspondent whose work has repeatedly taken her away from her family, and who has grown to tolerate Joe's constant infidelities. Meanwhile, Kitty's mental problems become more and more obvious, yet Nina is the only one who dares to address the issue. Towards the end it seems clear that Kitty is poised to kill herself. In the end, however, it is actually Joe who kills himself. As it turns out, Kitty's mental issues were just a reflection of his much more deep-founded depression. The story ends with a current-day confessional from the now adult Nina to her late father.  Critical reception  Critical reception of Swimming Home was generally positive.

Due to certain muscle spasms in the eye, the pupil can resemble a tadpole, which consists of a circular body, no arms or legs, and a tail. When the pupil takes on the shape of a tadpole, the condition is called tadpole pupil. Tadpole pupil, also known as episodic segmental iris mydriasis, is an ocular condition where the muscles of the iris begin to spasm causing the elongation, or lengthening, of parts of the iris. These spasms can affect any segment, or portion, of the iris and involve the iris dilator muscle. Contractions of the iris dilator muscle, a smooth muscle of the eye running radially in the iris, can cause irregular distortion of the pupil, thus making the pupil look tadpole shaped and giving this condition its name. Episodic segmental iris mydriasis was first described and termed ‚Äútadpole pupil‚Äù in 1912 by HS Thompson Symptoms The primary symptom is pupillary distortion (changing of the size or shape of the pupil). Distortion can occur in any segment of the iris. One part of the iris is pulled to a peak, and then returns to normal after the episode. Other symptoms may include blurred vision, abnormal periocular sensations (unusual feelings around the eyes), migraines, and feelings of a chilled face. Some patients who demonstrate tadpole pupil symptoms also experienced Horner‚Äôs syndrome or Adie‚Äôs tonic pupil Tadpole pupil symptoms occur in episodes. Episodes are generally brief and less than 5 minutes, however, some episodes have been reported to last anywhere from 3 to 15 minutes. The episodes can occur multiple times a day for days, weeks, or months. Studies show that a majority of those experiencing tadpole pupil are younger women from an age range of 24 to 48 years old, with no apparent health problems. Although women generally have the tadpole pupil, men are not unaffected by this disease and some have been reported to experience the symptoms. Diagnosis Tadpole pupil is diagnosed and characterized by the abnormality of the pupil shape. The pupil can disorient itself in different ways before it returns to its original shape. For example, the pupil may stretch out to a 7 o'clock position, i.e. the pupil points in the same direction the hour hand on a clock would at 7 o'clock. There are no specific tests or screenings that are performed to diagnose the tadpole pupil because of the briefness and randomness of the episodes. Some tests, however, are recommended by optometrists as part of an eye exam checkup. These tests include pharmacological testing (testing for an effective drug against a specific disease or condition), a complete ocular examination (a test that examines the entire eye), and video pupillography (recording and analysis of spontaneous pupil behavior in darkness). A test for Horner Syndrome is highly recommended to all the patients who have a history of tadpole pupil episodes because studies have linked the two conditions. Treatments Since the condition appears to slowly subside or diminish on its own, there are no specific treatments for this condition available. Some precautions include regular visits to an ophthalmologist or optometrist and general testing of the pupil and internal eye through fundamental examinations (listed below). The examinations can determine if any of the muscles of the eye or retina, which is linked to the pupil, have any problems that could relate to the tadpole pupil condition. Common eye examinations for the pupil and internal eye Corneal and Retinal Topography: computerized tests that maps the surface of the retina, or the curvature of the cornea. Fluorescein Angiogram: evaluation of blood circulation in the retina. Dilated Pupillary Exam: special drops expand the pupil, which then allows doctors to examine the retina. Slit-Lamp Exam: By shining a small beam of light in the eye, eye doctors can diagnose cataracts, glaucoma, retinal detachment, macular degeneration, injuries to the cornea, and dry eye disease. Ultrasound: Provides a picture of the eye‚Äôs internal structure, and can evaluate ocular tumors, or the retina if its suffering from cataracts or hemorrhages.

Set in Tokyo in 2046 when devices known as Neuro-Linkers have enabled fully integrated augmented reality, the main character Haruyuki Arita is offered a virtual reality massive multiplayer online (VRMMO) fighting game called Brain Burst by Kuroyukihime, the student council vice-president at his school. Together with Kuroyukihime and his other friends, Haruyuki fights as a Burst Linker to ultimately attain level 10, the highest attainable level, and meet the creator of Brain Burst to learn its true purpose. Nega Nebulus (Black Legion) The main characters are members of Nega Nebulus, also known as the Black Legion. =Haruyuki Arita= is the main protagonist of Accel World. Also known as Haru by his close friends, he is a short and overweight boy with low self- confidence until he meets Kuroyukihime. Although he is generally smart and careful when it comes to everyday life, Haru tends to get reckless while protecting Kuroyukihime. He views her as a mentor, friend, and lover simultaneously, which has given him the utmost respect and loyalty toward her and her army. His non-accelerated avatar is a small pig that was originally forced on him by one of the delinquents, only keeping it because Kuroyukihime finds it \\"cute.\\" While in Akibahara, Blood Leopard gives him a different avatar to fit in, taking the form of a small pink lizard. Haru's Brain Burst avatar, , has a tall, thin, fragile metallic frame that is completely devoid of weapons, forcing Haru to fight barehanded. His avatar was created by his desires to be thinner and fly away into the sky in order to escape his miserable life. The avatar possesses a mouth underneath its visor, allowing Silver Crow to eat while in the game world. Silver Crow is the first and only avatar with the ability to fly, sprouting wings on its back when its special ability is activated. Lacking in both physical strength and defensive capability, Silver Crow is dependent on Haru's squash-honed speed and reflexes in order to survive fights. Silver Crow's default finishing move is a basic headbutt, typically ineffective in most circumstances. Haru eventually learns how to utilize the Incarnate System (IS) to focus his willpower, gaining the ability to form energy blades from the bracers on Silver Crow's forearms, a technique he names \\"Laser Sword\\", and later refines into more powerful versions called \\"Laser Lance\\" and \\"Laser Javelin\\". He also gains eventually another Incarnate Skill called \\"Light Speed\\" that sharply increases the speed of his flight for a short time. For a period of time, Silver Crow has the Disaster Armor Enhanced Armament and becomes the 6th Chrome Disaster. In this form, he can predict the attacks of his opponents and use all the abilities of previous Chrome Disasters. In one battle, he can partially summon the uncorrupted form of The Destiny, which is one of the Seven Arcs used to form the Chrome Disaster Armament that was created by Chrome Falcon. =Kuroyukihime= is the leader of the Nega Nebulus legion. Her real name is unknown (although Sky Raker calls her \\"Sacchan\\"). Her pseudonym is Japanese word play with Snow White . Beautiful and popular, she is also the Student Council Vice-President at Umesato Junior High School. She has been a Burst Linker since she was eight years old. Kuroyukihime was formerly the Black King, although she was driven into hiding after beheading the first Red King, Red Rider, while trying to defeat the other kings to reach level 10. She values Haru as more than a subordinate and is often the voice of reason to him when he is willing to go to extremes to protect her. Prior to her hospitalization, she confesses to Haru that she fell in love with him. Her non-accelerated avatar is her real-world self dressed in black and sporting red and black butterfly wings. She is estranged from her family since she injured her sister, who is also the White King, out of anger after learning that she was tricked by her. Her Brain Burst avatar is , also known as \\"World End,\\" a slender robot with a feminine form which features limbs ending in sharp blades. These weapons instantly cut anything they touch due to the Absolute Cutting Property the avatar possesses, which has the side effect of permanently removing whatever is cut from an opponent's avatar. However, the blades have a frail lateral portion that breaks after receiving too much damage. To compensate for this weakness, Kuroyukihime developed a technique she calls \\"Soft Act\\". Black Lotus has three special abilities: Death by Barraging; Death by Embracing, which was used on Red Rider; and Death by Piercing, a one-hit-kill direct attack. She also has three incarnate system skills: \\"Vorpal Strike\\", \\"Star Burst Stream\\" and \\"The Eclipse\\", that she learned from her former subordinate Graphite Edge. Lotus also displays an ability called Overdrive: Mode Green, which causes the purple parts of its body to turn green and increase its speed and attack power for a limited time. Lacking feet, Black Lotus hovers slightly off the ground via air jets on the legs, with which it is able to achieve incredible speeds. =Takumu Mayuzumi= is Haru's childhood friend and Chiyuri's boyfriend at the start of the series, nicknamed \\"Taku.\\" Being smart and athletic, he attends a prestigious school. His non-accelerated avatar is the tin man. Initially, he abuses the enhanced reflexes he obtains while accelerated to have an advantage in the kendo tournaments he attends in real life. After Kuroyukihime is hospitalized, Takumu attempts to assassinate her until he is stopped by Haru, who convinces him to join forces. After confessing to Chiyu about what he's done, it seems they've broken up. Despite that he is waiting to see if Chiyu would get back together with him.Accel World episode 05 He is a mentor figure to Haru due to his advanced knowledge of the Accelerated World. After teaming up with the Nega Nebulus, he transfers to Umesato Junior High School and begins wearing glasses despite the Neuro-Linker's ability to correct vision problems, wanting to see the world through his own eyes. Takumu was bullied throughout elementary school, possessing a scar on his neck from the beatings he would receive from the kendo team. His Brain Burst avatar, , features a large frame reminiscent of a knight. Its primary weapon is a large pile driver Enhanced Armament mounted on the right forearm, which is able to extend its spike to incredible distances. Upon learning the Incarnate System, Taku obtains the ability to transform it into a huge sword, which he calls \\"Cyan Blade\\". Cyan Pile also has access to Splash Stinger, a series of needle guns hidden under the chest armor. Cyan Pile's special ability is \\"Lightning Cyan Spike,\\" which charges the pile driver weapon with electrical energy before firing. =Chiyuri Kurashima= is Haru and Takumu's childhood friend. At the start of the series she is dating Takumu, but after Haru and Takumu confess about the Cyan Pile incident they seem to have broken up. It is implied that she cares for Haru as more than a friend. Her non-accelerated avatar is a catgirl. After Takumu and Haru come clean with her and tell her about the Accelerated World, she demands the program for herself, wanting to show her friends how to enjoy the game and not take it too seriously. Fearing the game is tearing them apart, her main goal as a Burst Linker is to rekindle the close friendship she, Taku, and Haru once shared as children. Kuroyukihime wonders if she is mentally strong enough to use Brain Burst, but the group eventually gives in and gives her the program. To her friends' surprise, the program installs successfully. Her Brain Burst avatar, , appears as a witch girl with an Enhanced Armament resembling a large bell containing a clock face replacing the left forearm. Her avatar was created from her desire to return to the life she had when she, Haru, and Takumu had a very close friendship. Lime Bell's special ability is known as \\"Citron Call,\\" a healing ability which can fully recover any Duel Avatar it targets. However, in the final battle with Dusk Taker, Chiyuri reveals the true ability of Citron Call: to reverse time on the target so that the damage never existed. This also applies to the target's special abilities as well, demonstrated by Lime Bell reversing time on Dusk Taker so that he never took Silver Crow's wings. Lime Bell is the third avatar with a healing ability, the first being one of the current kings and the second having retired after uninstalling Brain Burst because healers are coveted and fought over in Accel World. In Vol 15, she used IS on her own due to her overwhelming feelings of love for her friends. Her situation is similar to how Chrome Falcon used Negative IS due to intense anger and despair. =Akira Himi= Also known as , is a Burst Linker associated to the element of the water who works as a \\"bodyguard\\" tag match partner for players level 2 and under. Initially, her gender is unknown. After Haru accidentally trips over her bag, he as well as the customers in the dining area of their meeting place distinguish her as female. Her avatar on the non-accelerated network is a bespectacled weasel with a necktie. Her duel avatar is Aqua Current, a mass of water with a feminine form, possessing properties of pure water such as being an excellent insulator against electrical attacks. Aqua Current is endowed with great skill and experience, proving the rumors about her helping players with dangerously low Burst Point levels. Aqua Current has been a Burst Linker for a long time, but refuses to level up in order to continue her work. Originally one of Nega Nebulus' \\"Elements\\", Aqua Current fell prey of a monster in the Unlimited Field who reduced her level to 1. Her whereabouts after the battle alongside Silver Crow are unknown, as is her real world identity after selectively erasing herself from Haru's memory with her Incarnate System ability. In volume 12, she saves Silver Crow from Argon Array and begins a duel with her. =Fuuko Kurasaki= is a retired Burst Linker known as , associated with the element of wind. She is also the vice-commander of Nega Nebulus. Sky Raker is Ash Roller's \\"guardian\\" (the one who gave him Brain Burst) and the only person in Accel World he shows respect towards. Before Silver Crow existed she was known as \\"the person closest to the sky\\" in the Accelerated World, gaining the nicknames \\"Astro\\", \\"ICBM\\" and \\"Icarus\\". She became obsessed with the desire to fly and as a result was abandoned by her friends and \\"parent.\\" Eventually, she gets the help of her only remaining friend and master Black Lotus to reach level 8. Having spent several level up bonus points trying to obtain the ability to fly, she eventually asks Black Lotus to cut off her avatar's legs to reduce her avatar's weight and increase her will. She is introduced to Silver Crow by Ash Roller in the Unlimited Neutral Field to help him control his willpower and use the Incarnate System to fly without his wings. After meeting her in the real world, Haru realizes she has mechanical prosthetic legs. Sky Raker later rejoins Nega Nebulus before the Hermes‚Äô Cord Vertical Race and regains her legs near the end of the race. Her Brain Burst avatar appears as a silver-blue robot modeled after her real world self, lacking legs below the knee and confined to a wheelchair she powers through the Incarnate System. She keeps the wheelchair even after she regains her legs. Sky Raker is one of the only Brain Burst avatars that wears clothes, in her case a wide-brimmed summer hat and dress. Sky Raker owns an Enhanced Armament known as Gale Thruster, a rocket pack that, while not granting true flight, temporarily allows for incredibly long jumps and midair dashes. She lends the Gale Thruster to Haru to help him regain Silver Crow's wings. Later on, Silver Crow shows her that the Gale Thruster is for flying in space as wings become useless without air. =Utai Shinomiya= A level 7 Burst Linker associated with the element of fire, is a fourth grader attending Matsunoki Elementary. Her avatar, , has a Japanese priestess-like figure and has the ability to purify objects with parasitic attributes, she also possesses a powerful wide range Incarnate System ability, however it takes a long time to activate due to its complexity. Other legions and organizations =Prominence (Red Legion)= * is a Year-Five student with a fiery temper and intelligence that belies her age, \\"Niko,\\" as she prefers to be called, is the second Red King after Red Rider's defeat. She is introduced when she breaks into Haru's house and tries to disguise herself as , Haru's second cousin. This plan fails when Haru looks through his grandfather's online photo albums and finds that Niko looks nothing like Tomoko. Niko was abandoned by her parents and attends a school for abandoned children. Niko displays tsundere qualities, one moment being very sweet and affectionate and the next angry and confrontational. :Her Brain Burst avatar is , a small red robot with the appearance of a young girl, armed with a laser pistol typically stored on the hip. She is the current Red King and her nickname is \\"The Immobile Fortress\\" thanks to her special ability, which summons her Enhanced Armament, a massive stationary artillery unit with which Scarlet Rain connects. Though unable to move and slow to turn, the artillery unit is outfitted with scores of weapons, giving it enough firepower to effortlessly take out legions of opponents from all directions. Scarlet Rain possesses two Incarnate System abilities: the Over Ray, a flamethrower attack, and the ability to teleport short distances. * real name , the vice-commander of Prominence. She works as a waitress at a cake shop that also serves as a secret base for Prominence. She is usually seen wearing a maid outfit that she wears for work and rides a motorcycle. Leopard, as she prefers to be called, is cold, blunt, and distant, though she has a sarcastic sense of humor. Her Brain Burst avatar is level 6 and has the Shape Change ability which allows her to transform her avatar back and forth into a four-legged configuration, along \\"Vital Bite\\" that drains the life gauge of the enemy to replenish hers and \\"Mental Bite\\" which does so with the special gauge. Her non-accelerated avatar is an anthropomorphic red-furred leopard woman wearing a leather bodysuit. She develops a rivalry with Sky Raker for unknown reasons. She tends to speak in punctuated gaming terms, such as \\"K\\", \\"GJ\\" (Good job), and \\"NP\\" (No Problem). *, also known as the fifth Chrome Disaster, is a very close friend of Yuniko, becoming her \\"parent\\" after learning how much she loves video games. After being out-leveled by Yuniko and learning that he was moving out of town, he accepted the Disaster Armor Enhanced Armament from the Yellow King. He was defeated by Yuniko with the aid of Nega Nebulus using the Judgement Blow. His defeat passes the Disaster Armor to Silver Crow, causing him to eventually become the next Chrome Disaster. *, was the original Red King, but was executed by Black Lotus before the events of the series. Red Rider had the ability to craft powerful weapons to use in combat, and it is implied that he had a romantic relationship with the Purple King, Purple Thorn. Rider was an advocate of continuing the peace treaty between the Kings, a mindset which led to Black Lotus beheading him with the \\"Death by Embracing\\" technique, which subsequently took all of his Burst Points and forcefully uninstalled the program, leading to Black Lotus' exile and setting into motion the events of the series. =Crypt Cosmic Circus (Yellow Legion)= *, also known \\"Radioactive Disturber\\", serves as the Yellow King in the legion. After the fourth Chrome Disaster was defeated, he took the Disaster Armor and gave it to Cherry Rook expecting that he would be able to break the nonviolence treaty between the kings by giving him the \\"legal\\" right to eliminate one member from the Red legion, ultimately going after Scarlet Rain. His Brain Burst avatar appears as a court jester with long arms wielding a scepter as a weapon. His Brain Burst avatar's special ability is Futile Fortune Wheel, most likely an illusion attack. He uses illusions and trickery as the basis for his fighting style. * is one of the Burst Linkers who participates in the ambush against Scarlet Rain in the Unlimited Neutral Field. =Great Wall (Green Legion)= * serves as the Green King in the legion. He specializes in absolute defense, which allows him to deal double the damage he receives from attackers earned him the title \\"Invincible\\". It is said he gained most of his Burst Points by hunting \\"enemies\\" in the Unlimited Neutral Field by himself. He exchanges Burst Points into item cards and distribute them to \\"enemies\\" for other players to hunt and pick up. He has only lost duels due to time out. He has witnessed the destruction of four generations of Chrome Disaster. His large shield is one of the Seven Arcs, 'gamma' The Strife. He is also one of the Originators and one of the few players who knows the existence of other accelerated worlds. * is Silver Crow's first opponent and Sky Raker's \\"child,\\" often referring to her as \\"master.\\" Ash Roller is rude, vulgar, and highly aggressive except when in Sky Raker's presence, where he adopts a highly respectful demeanor. His motorcycle, an Enhanced Armament, is his primary weapon, means of transportation, and source of strength. Without the bike, Ash Roller is effectively powerless. Ash's real identity is , who has a crush on Haruyuki since his defeat in the duels and even confesses to him. * is a level 8 Burst Linker associated with the element of earth and a former member of Nega Nebulus. His true name is still a mystery. He is a swordsman with the Enhanced Armament Twin Swords and his skills in close combat are equal or even superior to Black Lotus, to whom he taught her Incarnate attacks, despite his defenses are weak, true to his namesake. After Kuroyukihime's disappearance, he accepted to work under Green Grandee's in exchange for shelter to the remaining survivors of Nega Nebulus under him. =Leoniz (Blue Legion)= *, also known as \\"Vanquisher\\", \\"Holy Sword\\" and \\"Legend Slayer\\", serves as the Blue King in the legion. His large sword is one of the Seven Arcs, 'alpha' The Impulse. Although he is Cyan Pile's original Legion Master, for some reason he decides to not apply the Judgement Blow on him when he joins Nega Nebulus. He is Red Rider's best friend and also one of the Originators. * and are twin female Burst Linkers who are close aide of the Blue King, both level 7. Their duel avatars have a warrior appearance. They are loyal to the Blue King and they both have a crush on him. In the past, Sky Raker once hanged them from the top of the Tokyo Government Office which humiliated them. , while =Auroral Oval (Purple Legion)= *, also known as Empress Voltage, serves as the Purple King. She was Red Rider's lover. Her staff is one of the Seven Arcs, 'beta' The Tempest. * is a close aide of the Purple King. =Oscillatory Universe (White Legion)= *, also known as \\"Transient Eternity\\", serves as the White King in the legion and is the main antagonist of Accel World. She is Kuroyukihime's older sister by one year in the real world and her \\"parent\\" in the Accelerated World. Her Brain Burst avatar possesses a recovery ability, one of only three in the history of Brain Burst with such a power. She also has the power to become fully invisible. She also possesses one of the Seven Arcs and is also one of the Originators. As the series progress, she is revealed to be the leader of the Acceleration Research Society. She is also the one who manipulated Black Lotus to behead Red Rider, which put a strain in their relationship. * is the representative for White Cosmos during the meetings involving the Kings of each legion. =Acceleration Research Society= The Acceleration Research Society is a secret organization involved in using hacking and other underhanded tactics to obtain any advantage they can in the Brain Burst game. Its members include: * :A first year student at Umesato Junior High School, a Burst Linker (though he detests the term) and member of the Kendo Club who abuses the Physical Burst command to cheat. Seiji believes he is above other people and is disgusted by those he deems \\"lower\\" than himself to the point that he will clean his hands with a handkerchief if he touches someone. Seiji blackmails Haruyuki and Chiyuri and takes Silver Crow's wings in an attempt to force the two into becoming his \\"pets.\\" He is eventually double-crossed by Chiyuri, who temporarily joins forces with him just to level up enough to perfect her abilities and return Silver Crow's wings. He lost the resulting sudden death fight and has Brain Burst forcefully uninstalled, taking his memories of having the program with it, thus proving Kuroyukihime's theory that Burst Linkers who have the program uninstalled also lose any memories of ever having the program Much to Haruyuki and the others' surprise, Seiji becomes a kind person after he loses his memories from the game, forgetting not only all the harm he caused, but all the suffering inflicted on him by his brother, who used to abuse him and force him to play Brain Burst in order to steal his Burst points to himself, before Seiji defeated him for good by his own. :Seiji's Brain Burst avatar, , appears as a featureless black humanoid with a large red orb in place of a face. His avatar was created from his desire to take everything back that his older brother stole from him. Though lacking in significant combat ability on its own, Dusk Taker has an ability known as \\"Demonic Commandeer,\\" the power to steal any finishing move, reinforced exterior, or ability from other Burst Linkers. This ability has no time limit, meaning Dusk Taker can possess up to three stolen abilities for as long as he desires. So long as Dusk Taker possesses an ability, the Burst Linker he took it from will be unable to use it. Using this ability, he has managed to incorporate body parts and weapons from other Burst Linkers into his own avatar, including a large scissor weapon on the right arm and a set of red tentacles replacing his left arm. Dusk Taker is also able to utilize the Incarnate System to create claws made of bright purple energy. * is a level 6 Burst Linker that lays traps to fend off melee type avatars while picking them off with long-range attacks and makes use of the Incarnate System to rust and corrode his targets. Like Dusk Taker, his name does not appear on the challenge list by using the now banned Brain Implant Chip. * is a Burst Linker who dives into Okinawa while being in Tokyo using a backdoor program. Sulfur Pot has the ability to tame enemies with his Enhanced Armament Mystical Reins, which he loses when he is defeated. The item winds up in the hands of Black Lotus, a gift from the Okinawan Burst Linkers. Like Dusk Taker, his name does not appear on the challenge list. * is a level 1 Burst Linker with triple personality. He defeats Silver Crow in their first battle. He cooperated with the group to help with his personalities. During the second battle, he lost due to Silver Crow finding out his weakness. During the third battle, he overcame his mistakes, but Silver Crow's new move let him have the upper hand. When Argon Array interfered and trashed Ash Roller in the process, he defended Silver Crow; only to be knocked away by her. In vol 13, he was asked by Haru to meet with him in the real world. However, when he showed up, he ran off the last second. :His abilities change based on which of his personalities is active. When his second or the third personality activates, one of his shoulder armor pads opens and acts as the head. His first personality has the ability to become the strongest material and cannot be harmed by melee attacks but also makes him vulnerable to throws. His second personality has the ability to bite the opponent and temporarily copy the abilities of the opponent in the process. His third personality is Wolf Down, a copy of Dusk Taker and has the same \\"Demonic Commandeer\\" ability. * is a level 8 Burst Linker, one of the Originators, and the vice-commander of the Acceleration Research Society. He has the ability to hide in the shadows. Additionally, due to his Brain Implant Chip, Black Vise is able to decelerate, even while in the accelerated world. Essentially this enables him to dive into Brain Burst while still experiencing events in real-time as opposed to the slowed down time Burst Linkers normally experience due to their accelerated senses. His avatar's body, made up of a series of black panels in a roughly humanoid shape, is able to separate panels to use as shields and offensive weapons. The color black is already used by Black Lotus so Black Vise is likely not the official name of the avatar, due to no two Avatars sharing the same color (hence why the second Red King is Scarlet rather than Red). * is a level 8 Burst Linker, also known as \\"Quad Eyes Analyst\\". She has an ability to see the status of other avatars. She fires laser as her main attack and uses flash light to temporarily block the eyesight of other players. =Other players= * is a level 7 Burst Linker and former member of the Purple Legion. Crimson Kingbolt moved to Okinawa three years before the start of the series after his parents divorced. A freshman in high school, he is Lagoon Dolphin's \\"parent\\" and is \\"master\\" to both Lagoon Dolphin and Coral Merrow.

Following dissolution the friary was demolished and the site levelled, subdivided, and developed over the following centuries. The locality has retained the name Greyfriars particularly in the streets named \\"Grey Friars\\", and the older \\"Friar Lane\\". The friary is best known as the burial place of King Richard III who was hastily buried in the friary church following his death at the Battle of Bosworth. An archaeological dig in 2012/13 successfully identified the site of the Greyfriars church and the location of Richard's burial. The grave site was incorporated into the 'Dynasty, Death and Discovery' museum which opened in 2014. In December 2017 Historic England scheduled the site. Franciscan Friary A funeral procession led by friars of Greyfriars. This 18th-century engraving may be specific to Leicester, raising the possibility that the church in the background is the 13th-century Greyfriars Church.Nichols, John, History and Antiquities of the County of Leicester, 1795‚Äì1815, Vol I part II, plate XVII, fig. 11 (facing p.272), footnoted by Nichols to Rev Francis Peck MSS Vol V ( Harl. MSS 4938) p.11. Mendicant friars of the Order of Friars Minor, also known as Franciscans, and as the \\"grey friars\\" due to the colour of their religious habit, first arrived in Britain in 1224, two years before St Francis died. Nine friars came over from France to Canterbury, and rapidly attracted new members to the order. By the spring of 1225 they also had houses in London and Oxford (initially just borrowed rooms befitting an order vowed to poverty and simplicity). Expansion to Cambridge, Northampton and Norwich followed, continuing the pattern of modest premises in the midst of populous towns. Friars arrived at Leicester as part of this first wave of expansion, some time before 1230, and by 1237 Leicester was sufficiently established to be one of seven English friaries that had lectors, with responsibility for teaching new recruits to the order. By 1240 there were 29 English Franciscan houses, and by 1255 there were 1,242 friars in 49 houses. The process by which the Leicester friars acquired their large plot of ground within the town is unclear, but is thought to be a mid-13th century foundation. Simon de Montfort, 6th Earl of Leicester, has traditionally been credited with playing a part in this, having become Earl in 1231. Stow suggested Gilbert and Ellen Luenor were the actual founders, whilst antiquarian Francis Peck has suggested that John Pickering was either the founder or a very early benefactor of the friary. The excavations of 2013 opened a stone coffin, buried in front of the high altar of the church. Preliminary analysis suggests the occupant was a woman, and almost certainly a major benefactor, although her identity is as yet unknown. It is not clear if the friary was dedicated to a particular saint. De Montfort University's Digital Building Heritage Project points out it was \\"most commonly referred to simply as Greyfriars Church, Leicester\\". but suggests a possibility it may have been dedicated to St. Mary Magdalene; Victoria County History, however, suggests it may have been dedicated to St. Francis of Assisi, the founder of the Franciscan order. The friary was established on a site within Leicester's town walls. The friary's precinct had gates onto both Peacock Lane (formerly known as St Francis Lane) to the north, and Friar Lane to the south. However, the specific site of the church was only confirmed by the archaeological dig of 2012, which also gave some clues to the layout of the associated monastic buildings. The church occupied an area in the north- east of the plot, with the cloisters and other friary buildings extending to the south. The choir of the friary church was a buttressed building, wide. This was completed around 1255. Among the donations to the friary was the gift of oak trees by King Henry III (1216‚Äì1272): \\"to make stalls and wainscote their chapel\\". The nave, extending west at the same width as the choir, was completed around 1300. Around 1336, William of Nottingham was buried in its cemetery. Permission was given to expand the friar's dwelling place in 1349. Leicester achieved a degree of notoriety when, in 1402, several friars were involved in a conspiracy to support the deposed King Richard II over the current King Henry IV. One of the friars admitted that he and ten other friars, as well as a master of divinity (a secular priest), had conspired in favour of the deposed Richard. Two of the accused friars escaped but the remaining eight and the master of divinity were arrested and sent to London for trial. Although two juries failed to convict, at their third trial they were convicted and then executed. The two friars that had at first escaped were captured and executed around the same time in Lichfield, Staffordshire. A provincial chapter of the English Franciscans was held at Leicester the same year, in which it was explicitly forbidden for any member of the Order to speak against the King. In April 1414 Henry V convened Parliament in Leicester (the so-called Fire and Faggot Parliament, a reference to the Suppression of Heresy Act 1414 which it passed). The Lords assembled in the 'Large Hall' of the Greyfriars Friary, while the Commons met in \\"La Fermerie\\", (the Greyfriars Infirmary). This was separate from the Greyfriars site, outside the town wall on Millstone Lane. After the dissolution it was used as a barn, and ended up as the 18th century meeting hall of Leicester Methodists. The main business of the sessions was the suppression of Lollardy, the punishment for which was to be confiscation of property, or even burning at the stake, giving rise to the name. =Dissolution= The friary was dissolved in 1538 as part of King Henry VIII's Dissolution of the Monasteries. At the time of dissolution the friary was extremely poor with a tiny annual income of only ¬£1. 2s. and owning only the land on which the friary sat. The friary was at that point home to the warden, William Gyllys, and \\"six others\\" (presumably friars). =Burial of Richard III= Archaeological dig open day at Greyfriars, Leicester, 8 September 2012. An exposed stone at the bottom of the picture is interpreted as a stone seat from the Chapter House. At the far end of the trench are foundations thought to be the eastern end of the Friary Church. In 1485, following his death in battle against Henry Tudor at Bosworth Field, Richard III's body was thrown across a horse and brought to Leicester where it was put on display for several days, after which it was buried in the Greyfriars Church. Ten years later, Henry VII paid ¬£50 and ¬£10-1s for a tomb 'of many- coloured marble' to be built. This appears to be a fair price for a high- status alabaster tomb. For comparison, also in 1495, ¬£66 was paid for the tomb of Cecily Neville, Richard's mother. An epitaph to Richard, which may be contemporary but appears never to have been attached to the tomb, is known from a handwritten version by Thomas Hawley, who died in 1557. The tomb is presumed to have been demolished along with the Church following its dissolution after 1536. An account arose that when the tomb was destroyed, Richard's bones were thrown into the River Soar by the nearby Bow Bridge. In 1920, C.J Billson regarded this as a mere legend and highly improbable, a view endorsed by David Baldwin in 1986. By the end of the 20th century, aided by a plaque near the Bow Bridge, the notion was sufficiently entrenched as to be reported as fact in authoritative history books.e.g. However, the Archaeology service of the University of Leicester, along with the Richard III Society and Leicester City Council, initiated an archaeological study resulting in three trenches being dug across the parking area behind the buildings on Greyfriars. These excavations revealed walls of the cloisters and the Church, enabling a possible layout for the monastic buildings to be drawn. Also found was the complete skeleton of a male showing severe scoliosis and major head wounds. On 4 February 2013 the University of Leicester confirmed that the skeleton was that of Richard III, based on numerous tests. The mtDNA was compared with two known descendants of Richard III's older sister, Anne of York, and on 4 February 2013 it was confirmed that the mtDNA matched, that the radiocarbon agreed, and that the characteristics of the bones and the nature of the head wounds were all entirely consistent with this being the remains of Richard III. Post-dissolution development Remnant of brick perimeter wall of the Grey Friars Priory, on Peacock Lane, Leicester, photographed in or before 1920. The wall has been demolished without trace. After the dissolution, the Church and monastic buildings were acquired by two property speculators from Lincolnshire: John Bellowe and John Broxholme. They demolished the buildings in 1538, selling off the stones and building materials. Some of the stones and timber were used to repair St Martin's Church (now the Cathedral). The 2012 excavation trenches revealed the original wall trenches, which were filled with mortar from the removal of the original stones. Some tracery and other carved stones were found, but most had been efficiently recycled elsewhere. The church foundations, floor levels, and demolition layer were found under some of garden soil, itself capped by a further of mill waste used to create a base for the car parking area of recent years. =Herrick's mansion= Sir Robert Catlyn, Chief Justice to Elizabeth I, acquired the site from Bellowe and Broxholme, and it was later bought by Robert Herrick (Heyrick), three- times mayor of Leicester. Herrick built a mansion fronting onto Friar Lane, with extensive gardens over the east end of the Friary grounds. These gardens were visited in 1611 by Christopher Wren Sr. (1589‚Äì1658), who recorded being shown a handsome stone pillar with an inscription, \\"Here lies the body of Richard III, some time King of England\\". The Herrick family, who also owned the country estate of Beaumanor, near Loughborough, sold the mansion in 1711 to Thomas Noble, who, like Herrick 130 years before him, represented Leicester in Parliament. Georgian and Victorian development Thomas Noble's son, also Thomas, put a road across the Greyfriars site in 1740. It spanned from near St Martin's Church (now Leicester Cathedral) to Friar Lane. It became known as \\"New Street\\" and provided road frontages for smaller building development plots. The mansion and gardens were sold in 1743 to Roger Ruding of Westcotes. Georgian buildings were built along New Street and Friar Lane, many of which date to the mid and late 18th Century and remain standing. In 1752 the mansion house and grounds were sold to Richard Garle, who sold it in 1776 to Thomas Pares, a Leicester banker. Pares enlarged the mansion and built a banking house at the extreme east end of the site, on the corner of St Martin's and Hotel Street. In 1900, Pares Bank was rebuilt to a design by J. B. Everard and S. Perkins Pick. Through mergers, it became a branch of the National Westminster Bank. When Pares died in 1824, all but the banking house was sold to Beaumont Burnaby. The mansion house was by now known as \\"The Grey Friars\\", and was subdivided so that by 1863, one part was occupied by Burnaby's widow, and the other by a Mrs Parsons. School building In 1863, Mrs Parsons was persuaded to sell a plot of land to the trustees of Alderman Newton's Boys School, enabling a move from their school in Holy Bones. The character of the area was described at that point as \\"very open and salubrious and in the neighbourhood of several large gardens.\\" The school was built in 1864, and extended in both 1887 and 1897, fronting on to St Martins. In 1920, Alderman Newton's moved to the former Wyggeston School buildings at the other end of Peacock Lane (now the St Martin's cathedral centre). The old school buildings became the Girls School and then the preparatory school. When the Alderman Newton's School moved to Glenfield Road in the 1970s, the buildings became Leicester Grammar School, and the St Martins buildings were used by the sixth formers. When Leicester Grammar School itself moved to Great Glen, they were renamed 'St Martin's Place', and used as offices. In the 2012 archaeological dig, trench 3 was located in the former playground of Alderman Newton's School. In late 2012 it was acquired by Leicester City Council, who announced in February 2013 that it was to become a Richard III museum. The former Alderman Newton's Boys School. The furthest section is the original school, with extensions along the left side. Trench 3 of the 2012 dig can be seen in the former playground. =Corporation and County Council= The two parts of the mansion and the remainder of its gardens were bought by the Leicester Corporation in 1866. They originally intended it to be the site of a new Town Hall but, in 1872, they decided instead to use a site at what is now Town Hall Square. At the mansion site, they demolished the house, cleared the ground, and created a new road linking St Martins and Friar Lane, called \\"Grey Friars\\". This rapidly acquired several fine commercial Victorian buildings. In 1873, at the corner of St Martin's facing Pares Bank, the Leicester Savings Bank was built. In 1878 the Conway Buildings, 7 Grey Friars, were built to be the offices of W W Clarkson & Co. brick and tile merchants, and designed by Stockdale Harrison in late 19th Century Gothic style. In 1880, Barradale's architects office, 5 Grey Friars was built. Designed by Isaac Barradale for his own use, it is an early example of Domestic Revival style. Ernest Gimson was articled to Barradale, and worked in these offices between 1881 and 1885. One of the few 20th-century buildings on the site was built in 1936, over the place where the Herrick Mansion had stood, on what was by then the corner of Grey Friars and Friar Lane. It served as the county offices for Leicestershire County Council until the completion of County Hall in 1965. It has since become one of several buildings in the area for the administration of social services. No 1, Grey Friars, County Offices for Leicestershire County Council from 1936 to 1965, on the site of the Herrick mansion The buildings fronting onto Grey Friars, Friar Lane, New Street, and St Martins surround an area that for over a century has been car parks, back yards, and a school yard, and were gardens for 300 years before that. The identification of the exact site of the church and monastic buildings through the archaeological dig of 2012 has shown that much of the Greyfriars Church foundations, including the grave of Richard III, are within that area and lay undisturbed for the whole of that time. Archaeological excavations 2013 site excavations. Richard III's burial site is on the right. The stone coffin came from the grave on the far left. As well as discovering the remains of Richard III, the Archaeological dig of August 2012 tentatively identified various elements of the medieval friary. This included the north and south walls of the Friary Church chancel, a cloister area, a chapter house with stone benches, and some tentative clues as to the building materials, stone choir pews, floor tiles and a window moulding. Three further graves, including a stone coffin, were also identified, but left undisturbed. In July 2013 the University of Leicester Archaeological Service headed up a month-long dig, with a wider remit to investigate further the archaeology of the Greyfriars. The aim was to provide as much information as possible for the visitor centre. The modern wall dividing the social services car park and school playground was demolished, allowing a wide area excavation, contrasting with the narrow trenches of 2012. In-situ floor tiles were found, along with other pottery, and small finds. A mystery buttressed building to the south of the Chancel was also found, which may pre-date the Church. The three grave sites, all within the Chancel, were also investigated, including a massive stone coffin in front of the high altar, which was found to have an intact lead coffin inside. Initial investigations suggest the occupant was a woman, and therefore probably a wealthy benefactor. Richard III Visitor Centre Entrance to Leicester's Richard III museum - Dynasty, Death and Discovery The museum roof in the foreground follows the walls of the Greyfriars Church, covering Richard III's grave site at the far end. The nave of the Church continued west across New Street and some distance into the next car park. With the confirmation in February 2013 that Richard III's burial place had been found, Leicester City Council announced plans to convert the former Alderman Newton's school buildings into a Richard III Visitor Centre called 'Richard III: Dynasty, Death and Discovery', with a covered area over the original grave site, and an upstairs viewing platform to show reconstructions of the Greyfriars site and other elements of medieval Leicester. A temporary exhibition in the Leicester Guildhall showed a range of the site artefacts until the permanent museum opened in July 2014. Reburial In July 2013 Leicester Cathedral announced plans for the re-burial in the nearby Cathedral in May 2014, although a request to the High Court for a judicial review was made by people wishing the reburial to be in York. In August 2013 a judge granted permission for a judicial review but a ruling in May 2014 decreed that there are \\"no public law grounds for the Court interfering with the decisions in question\\". In the light of this judgement, plans were announced for a re-interment in Leicester Cathedral in the spring of 2015, and which accordingly took place on 26 March in the presence of the Countess of Wessex, the Duke and Duchess of Gloucester, and the Archbishop of Canterbury.

Only two complete and functional prototypes were produced, armed with a modified 75mm field gun and 7.5mm machine gun. The design project was known as ARL 40, related to the char G1B medium tank. Designed in 1935, two prototypes were completed by 1940. However, due to the later occupation of France, mass production to meet orders was canceled and the prototypes evacuated to Morocco, ceasing any further development in the project.  Development  Development of the project was started in mid 1935, arising to France's proposal of a new self-propelled, infantry support assault gun. Having no existing tanks of this type in service, two manufacturers submitted designs built upon existing medium tanks: SOMUA, with the Somua SAu 40 based on the chassis of the SOMUA S35 medium cavalry tank, and ARL, with the ARL 40, developed using parts from the Char B1 heavy tank. The ARL V 39 was the only vehicle fully developed to meet the specification of the ARL 40 project, the first vehicle constructed of a soft steel was completed in June 1938, with military testing taking place 23‚Äì25 March 1939. Passing trials successfully, the project was approved for mass production with an initial order of 72 units, of which 24 were to be unarmed command vehicles. On 27 September, the unit distribution was changed to groups of 12 vehicles, divided into two groups consisting of two three-vehicle batteries, with additional command vehicles granted to each group. In October 1939, France's Prime Minister, √âdouard Daladier, placed the revised order, the first five to be ready for service by October 1940, then to be proceeded by a production rate of 10 per month. However, at the beginning of the Battle of France in May 1940, no vehicle was combat ready, two working prototypes were shipped to Morocco to be hidden in a tunnel. The vehicles are confirmed to have reached Africa, but their fate beyond that is unknown. The future occupation of France then saw a cease in any further development in the ARL 40 project. SOMUA's SAu 40 project also passed trials and was simultaneously granted a 36 unit order, 12 of which were to be unarmed command vehicles, which initially were to be allocated to battalions alongside the ARL V 39. However, problems arose with the SAu 40 when adopting the 75mm high-power APX gun used by the ARL V 39, leading to the order of 36 to be canceled on 1 May 1940. Instead the initial role was to be left to the ARL V 39, giving the SAu 40 the new role of tank destroyer using the 47mm mle 1937 artillery gun. Seventy-two SAu 40's were ordered in this configuration, but never reached production.  Armament  The ARL V 39 mounted the 75mm high-velocity APX gun. It was a modification of the 75mm 1929 casemate fortress gun. Muzzle velocity reached 400 m/s for high explosive rounds and 570 m/s for armor- piercing rounds. Penetration tests found that the armor-piercing shell had 50 mm of penetration at . Instrumentation included two sight and stereoscopic rangefinders, allowing for shots at up to distance. Traverse angles were 7¬∞ left and right and -10¬∞ to 30¬∞ vertically. When transporting the gun barrel could be drawn into the body to reduce the total length. The gun had a semi- automatic breech mechanism, automatic charging, and a data recorder.

It is a result of a redevelopment of the site in the 1990s which preserved many of the old buildings, now used for retail and commercial space as well as cultural facilities, combining them with new apartment buildings. History √òsterf√¶lled Barracks photographed by Frederik Riise in 1898 Plans for the redevelopment of the former √òsterf√¶lled Barracks emerged in the early 1990s after all military activities had left the area. Arkitektgruppen (now Arkitema) designed the project. A local plan for the area was adopted by the politicians in 1992 and the area was subsequently acquired by BUPL's pension fund PBU in 1993. Some of the old buildings were demolished to make way for new residential buildings. Others were converted into retail and commercial space. PBU sold the residential share of the project to Schaumann Investment for DKK 1,5 billions in 2006, a transaction which later contributed to the bankruptcy of Roskilde Bank in the light of the financial crisis and the decreasing prices on the housing market. In January 2012, the apartments were acquired by the Swedish property company Balder for the price of DKK 1.1 billion. Architecture and layout The old gate to the barracks Old and new building The development is centred on a pedestrianized zone consisting of a large plaza located just inside the old main entrance to the barracks, on the corner of √òsterbrogade and Gunner Nu Hansens Plads, and a central axis which extends diagonally into the area. The old buildings along the margin of the area and those surrounding the central space have been preserved. Many of the century-old trees in the area, mainly English yew and lime, were also preserved in connection with the redevelopment. The new apartment buildings are located to the rear of the old buildings. They are five storeys high and arranged in four large, open blocks with a total of 525 apartments. They respect the symmetry and architecture of the original development. The style is Postmodern. They are built in red brick like the old buildings but in combination with concrete columns and balconies and window sections in steel and aluminium. In total, old and new buildings cover an area of 60,000 sqm. The artist Finn Sk√∏dt has created artworks for the public spaces. The theatre Republique is also based in the area.

It's those very Paul McCartney/Wings-type chords ‚Äì Broadway-type chords. What I'm most proud of from a songwriting standpoint is how it goes from D major to A minor. It goes from a very 'majorly' feel into something sorrowful, almost a Spanish feel.

Early Life  Born in Port MacDonnell, South Australia, where his father was a fisherman, Feast moved to nearby Mount Gambier, South Australia as an 8-year- old. Despite not coming from a sporting family, at 13 Feast started playing football for East Gambier Football Club in the Western Border Football League. As a latecomer to junior football Feast wasn't the most gifted junior but developed into a promising ruckman. He had a trial at Norwood Football Club but returned home shortly after. Feast went to play football in Darwin in the 1994 off season as a 19-year-old and when he returned home Feast had an offer from Sturt's general manager Ross Tuohy, which he gladly accepted as an opportunity to leave his job at a timber mill.  Football Career  Feast began when the Double Blues were at a low ebb ‚Äì they had suffered six consecutive wooden spoons, and his debut season of 1995 was an unprecedented horror with Sturt losing all 22 games by no fewer than 24 points. Feast, however, won Sturt‚Äôs best and fairest award as a rookie, and continued this form as the Double Blues made a remarkable revival over the following three seasons to win sixteen matches in 1998, winning another best and fairest in 1998. Sydney drafted Feast, a ruckman, from the Double Blues with pick 71 in the National Draft. He made his league debut in round five of the 1999 AFL season, coming into the side for Greg Stafford. In his time at Sydney he was never able to become a regular fixture in the team, playing five games in 1999, four in 2000 and five in 2001. Feast played VFL football for Port Melbourne as they were the Swan's reserve side and received the second most votes in the 2001 J. J. Liston Trophy. After being discarded by Sydney for the 2002 season, Feast returned to Sturt and played in the Double Blues‚Äô only premiership since 1976. He continued to play for Sturt until his retirement in 2008, by when he had played 205 games in the double-blue strip.

The agreement defined the yard as exactly and the pound as exactly . History In October 1834, the United Kingdom Houses of Parliament were destroyed in a fire. Among the items lost were the objects that defined the imperial standards of length and mass. New prototypes were subsequently created to replace the items lost in the fire, among them a new \\"yardstick\\" ruler in 1855, and with it a new formal definition of the yard. Two copies of the ruler were subsequently presented to the United States, which in turn adopted the measure for the United States national standard yard. In 1866, the U.S. Congress passed a law that allowed, but did not require, the use of the metric system in trade and commerce. Included in the law was a table of conversion factors between the customary (i.e. British-derived) and metric units, among them a definition of the meter in terms of the yard, and the kilogram in terms of the pound. In 1893, the Mendenhall Order changed the fundamental standards of length and mass of the United States from the customary standards based on those of England to metric standards.National Bureau of Standards, Refinement of values for the yard and pound There were two factors that influenced the order: for one, the imperial standard yard of 1855 had been found to be unstable and shortening by measurable amounts. Secondly, the United States was a co-signee of the Treaty of the Metre of 1875 and had received two meter prototypes on which to base a new fundamental standard. In the United Kingdom, a similar situation developed with the Weights and Measures Act of 1897 legalizing the metric system, and Order in Council 411 (1898) defining the meter and kilogram in terms of the yard and pound. As a practical matter the British definitions were reversed, resulting in a de facto definition of the imperial yard as 36/39.370113 meter. In the 1890s, Albert Michelson began conducting experiments in interferometry that led in 1903 to demonstrating the feasibility of using light waves as units of linear measurement. In 1908, two teams of researchers, one led by Michelson, defined the length of the international prototype meter in terms of light waves. In 1927, the International Bureau of Weights and Measures provisionally adopted the 1908 light-wave definition of the meter as a supplemental standard. In 1930, the British Standards Institution adopted an inch of exactly 25.4 mm based on the 1927 light-wave definition of the meter. The American Standards Association followed suit in 1933. By 1935, industry in 16 countries had adopted the \\"industrial inch\\" as it came to be known. In 1946, the British Commonwealth Scientific Conference recommended that members of the British Commonwealth adopt the inch as exactly 25.4 mm, and the 36-inch yard as exactly 0.9144 meters.Report of the British Commonwealth Scientific Conference. Official Conference, London, 1946. Cmd. 6970. H.M.

To secure identical values for the yard and pound in precise measurements, representatives of six English-speaking nations Australia, Canada, New Zealand, South Africa, United States and United Kingdom agreed to adopt a common 'international yard and international pound'. According to that agreement, the international yard equals 0.9144 meters and the international pound equals 0.45359237 kilograms. The international yard was about two millionths of a meter longer than the imperial yard, while the international pound was about six ten-millionths of a kilogram lighter than the imperial pound. The metric-based international yard and international pound were adopted by the United States National Bureau of Standards effective 1 July 1959.

Roberts was born in 1853 at Llewfllyd, in the village of Dyserth, which was then considered in Flintshire but later placed in Denbighshire, in north Wales. Educated at Ruthin grammar school and St David's College, Lampeter (then affiliated with Oxford University), Roberts graduated in 1878. He was ordained a deacon by the Right Rev. George Augustus Selwyn in Lichfield Cathedral, and briefly served as a curate at Dawley Magna in Shropshire. However, Roberts yearned to become a missionary, possibly because of Selwyn's work in New Zealand. By year's end, Roberts had sailed to Nassau, Bahamas, where he was ordained a priest and made chaplain of St. Matthew Cathedral. Roberts concentrated his ministry among \\"coloured people\\" and lepers. However, those were already Christian, and the priest wanted greater challenges, particularly among American Indians. Two years later, Roberts sailed to New York and applied for the mission he always wanted, among American Indians. He met Bishop John Spalding of Wyoming and Colorado, and asked for missionary work in the diocese's most difficult field. He was told that was at the Shoshone and Bannock Indian Agency in Wyoming Territory (in what later became the Wind River Indian Reservation.Shortly before, the U.S. government delegated work with various Indian tribes to various churches--but cite needed. However, Bishop Spalding wanted the young priest to first gain experience, and so sent him first to tend to the spiritual needs of coal miners in Greeley, Colorado, and then to the mixed community in Pueblo. There, Roberts established Trinity mission in South Pueblo. When a smallpox epidemic caused the community to be quarantined, Roberts worked at the hospital. With that experience, Roberts secured his dream job in 1883, ministering to the Shoshone and Arapahoe tribes and other people within 150 miles of Fort Washakie. Roberts was also a government employee, serving as the first principal of the reservation's school. Roberts became known for his interest in, and support for, traditional customs. Roberts also translated the Bible into the local languages. The boarding school for girls that Chief Washakie and Roberts established in 1888 was placed on the National Register of Historic Places, though it has not operated as a school since 1949. Roberts also established several churches in his territory, many of which still function. John Roberts is honored with a feast day on the liturgical calendar of the Episcopal Church (USA) on 25 February. Wyoming's flag was presented to be flown in the National Cathedral in his honor.

In X Games, players attempt to earn the highest score within a one-minute time limit. One of the playable levels is inspired by the halfpipe used in X Games Six. The game also has an arcade mode, where players roam levels and complete various goals, and collecting spinning X Games logos, which unlocks other playable levels. In the Game Boy Advance version, players increase their attributes via the X-Rage meter, where players fill up the meter by performing tricks, which later will cause a coin to appear on the halfpipe. After the player grabs the coin, they're flown higher into the air, and players are to perform a 10-trick combo. If the player successfully accomplishes this, gems will fall down onto the halfpipe, which players can collect. If players grab enough gems of a particular color, the skater the player is playing as will have his attributes raised in a specific section. Reception In Japan, Famitsu gave the PlayStation 2 version a score of 33 out of 40.

IGN praised the ESPN integration, while criticizing the aforementioned inconsistent graphics throughout the levels in arcade mode; IGN ultimately gave the PS2 version 4.9 out of 10. GameSpot gave the same version 4.4, also criticizing the graphics, along with the controls. Jim Preston reviewed the PlayStation 2 version of the game for Next Generation, rating it two stars out of five, and stated that \\"It's plain vanilla without the sprinkles. Wait for Hawk 3.\\" IGN gave the GBA edition a 5.5, also praising the presentation, and unlike the PS2 version, gave a higher score for the graphics, but IGN would also criticize the overall gameplay and potential lasting appeal. GameSpot gave the same version 6.7 out of 10, saying, \\"It is really too bad that the park competition is so incomplete and lackluster, as it virtually ensures that few people will ever purchase the game and experience the sheer joy of the more magically delicious vert competition.\\" References External links * PlayStation 2 games Game Boy Advance games ESPN video games Skateboarding video games 2001 video games Konami games Video games developed in Japan X Games Extreme sports video games ","title":"ESPN X Games Skateboarding"},{"id":"37027869","text":"Cyril Suk and Pavel V√≠zner were the defending champions, but did not play together this year.

Passing the exam results in certification for health information management. History At the time known as the American Medical Record Association (AMRA), AHIMA began offering the Registered Record Administrator (RRA) certification in the 1970s. In 2000 AHIMA renamed the certification from RRA to Registered Health Information Administrator (RHIA). Roles The RHIA certification focuses on preparing members for careers in health information and medical records management, including management of the processes and systems that capture and report on health care-related data so that it can be used to evaluate care performance. They design and manage health information systems to ensure they meet medical, legal, and ethical standards. Seeing that each patient's medical record is complete, kept confidential, and safeguarded from individuals not involved with the medical care of the patient are primary responsibilities. A RHIA certification is a preferred qualification for positions including Health Information Management Director, Clinical Documentation Improvement Professional (CDIP), and Registered Health Information Administrator. In 2009 a RHIA-certified professional in New York City would earn from $45,000 to $75,000 with a bachelor's degree, and up to $100,000 with a master's degree. =RHIA vs. RHIT= AHIMA also offers a Registered Health Information Technician (RHIT) certification for coding professionals with two-year associate degrees and with less emphasis on management responsibilities. In 2005 researchers found that the differences in these certifications, in addition to other accreditations offered by AHIMA and the need for ongoing training, contributed to inconsistent medical record coding. Certification To be eligible for RHIA certification, an individual must complete a bachelor's degree in a health information management program accredited by the Commission on Accreditation for Health Informatics and Information Management Education (CAHIIM) or graduate from a foreign association that has a reciprocity agreement with AHIMA. Students focus on a core content area: technology, management development, clinical data management, performance improvement, external forces, clinical foundations, or privacy and security. In response to industry demand for health information administrators, some programs began offering accelerated, CAHIIM-accredited postbaccalaureate certificates in health information administration in 2000 to allow experienced enrollees, such as former nurses or business analysts with Master of Business Administration (MBA), to more quickly take the RHIA exam. A temporary Proviso has been implemented by the CCHIIM that any Registered Health Information Technicians (RHIT) who meet the following eligibility requirements will be eligible to sit for the RHIA examination during the timeframe of July 1, 2017 through 2021: * Have at least a baccalaureate degree from a regionally accredited institution or nationally recognized accreditor; and * Have received their RHIT credential on or before August 31, 2018; and * Have complied with the Standards for Maintenance of the RHIT credential. =Ongoing education= Maintaining a RHIA certification requires 30 hours of continuing education units (CEUs) every two years. Of the 30 hours, 80% (or 24 hours) must be in one of the core content areas.

Widespread early news coverage said that the protests were a spontaneous response to an online preview of Innocence of Muslims, a movie considered offensive to Muslims. Later consideration of the Libya attack's complexity, of statements made by some Libyan officials, and of the potentially symbolic date (the anniversary of the September 11 attacks) fueled speculation of preplanned efforts. U.S. missions in Cairo, Egypt, and Benghazi, Libya, were attacked during the first day of the protest. Egypt Egyptian Prime Minister Hisham Kandil condemned violence, saying: \\"What happened at the U.S. embassy in Cairo is regrettable and [is] rejected by all Egyptian people and cannot be justified, especially if we consider that the people that produced this low film have no relation to the U.S. government. We ask the American government to take a firm position towards this film's producers within the framework of international charters that criminalise acts that stir strife on the basis of race, color or religion.\\" Egyptian President Mohamed Morsi issued a statement 24 hours after the event, saying: \\"The presidency deplores the most vicious attempt to insult the person of Muhammad and condemns people who produced this extremist film\\" and asked President Obama to \\"act against the film\\". It added that the President had instructed Egyptian Embassy in the U.S. to \\"take possible legal action to respond to those persons who seek to sabotage the relations and dialogue between peoples and nations.\\" The site Onislam, which is affiliated with Al Azhar, issued a fatwa condemning the violence.Attacking U.S. embassies for Prophet Film: Illegal? - Relations during Peace - counsels - OnIslam.net Al Azhar itself issued a fatwa condemning the violence.\\"Al-Azhar Scholars Condemn Offensive Prophet Film\\", OnIslam.net The initial reactions of President Morsi and the Muslim Brotherhood were received coldly in the US. Both American media, policy experts and President Obama contrasted the allegedly insufficient and \\"mild\\" Egyptian reaction with the Libyan reaction, which they praised. Martin S. Indyk, a former U.S. ambassador to Egypt, criticized the \\"precious little\\" that Egyptian police did \\"the fourth time an embassy was assaulted in Cairo,\\" while others criticized that the Morsi's 24-hour wait before his allegedly \\"mild\\" initial rebuke of the embassy attack, which allegedly seemed to focus more on condemnation of film. In an interview, Obama remarked that though Egypt was not hostile, it was not \\"necessarily an ally,\\" though the administration later backed off from this statement. In a late-night phone call, Obama warned Morsi that relations could be jeopardized if Egypt failed to protect diplomats. Two days after, a particular Arabic release by the Brotherhood saying \\"Egyptians rise up to support Muhammad in front of the American Embassy. Sept. 11,\\" was attacked by the U.S. embassy in a statement. Responding to this criticism, both Morsi and the Brotherhood took a much harder line against the embassy attacks, promising charges against those who scaled the embassy's walls, offering condolences for Stevens' death, and appearing on Egyptian television, telling Egyptians of their \\"religious duty to protect our guests and those who come to us from outside our nation ... I know that the people attacking the embassies do not represent any of us.\\" Meanwhile, one Muslim Brotherhood spokesman defended its rhetoric, saying they balanced anger at the film with urging restraint, while its strategist, Khairat el-Shater wrote a letter to the NY Times, explaining that \\"Despite our resentment of the continued appearance of productions like the anti-Muslim film that led to the current violence, we do not hold the American government or its citizens responsible for acts of the few that abuse the laws protecting freedom of expression.\\" Libya Libyan Prime Minister Mustafa Abushagur's office condemned the attack and extended condolences, saying: \\"While strongly condemning any attempt to abuse the person of Muhammad, or an insult to our holy places and prejudice against the faith, we reject and strongly condemn the use of force to terrorise innocent people and the killing of innocent people.\\" It also reaffirmed \\"the depth of relationship between the peoples of Libya and the U.S., which grew closer with the positions taken by the U.S. government in support of the revolution of February 17.\\" Mohamed Yousef el- Magariaf, the President of the General National Congress of Libya, said: \\"We apologise to the United States, the people and to the whole world for what happened. We confirm that no-one will escape from punishment and questioning.\\" He also said \\"we expect the world to cooperate with us to confront to what is meant out of this kind of act of cowardice.\\" Libyans held demonstrations in Benghazi (Additional such photographs.) and Tripoli on September 12, condemning the violence and holding signs such as, \\"Chris Stevens was a friend to all Libyans\\", and apologizing to Americans for the actions in their name and in the name of Muslims. The New York Times noted that young Libyans had also flooded Twitter with pro-American messages after the attacks. It has been noted that Libyans are typically more positively inclined towards the US than their neighbors. A 2012 Gallup poll noted that \\"A majority of Libyans (54%) surveyed in March and April 2012 approve of the leadership of the U.S. -- among the highest approval Gallup has ever recorded in the ... region, outside of Israel.\\" Another poll in Eastern Libya, taken in 2011, reported that the population was at the same time both deeply religious conservative Muslims and very pro-American, with 90% of respondents reporting favorable views of the US. Ali Aujali, the ambassador to the U.S., praised Stevens as a \\"dear friend\\" and a \\"real hero\\" at a reception in Washington alongside Hillary Clinton. He also urged the U.S. to continue supporting Libya this \\"very difficult time\\" and that the young Libyan government needed help so that it could \\"maintain ... security and stability in our country.\\" The Libyan response to the crisis was praised and appreciated in the U.S., with U.S. President Barack Obama emphasising how the Libyans \\"helped our diplomats to safety\\" the following day. A New York Times editorial criticised Egypt's government for not doing \\"what Libyan leaders did.\\" The Islamic institution of Dar al-Ifta' al-Libiyya, headed by Libya's Grand Mufti Al-Sadiq al-Ghiryani, issued a statemtement strongly condemning the attacks on the US diplomats and Libyan forces, citing a hadith by the Islamic prophet Muhammad, \\"Whoever killed a Mu'ahid (a person who is granted the pledge of protection by the Muslims) shall not smell the fragrance of Paradise though its fragrance can be smelt at a distance of forty years (of traveling)\\". Yemen Yemeni President Abd Rabbuh Mansur Al-Hadi reacted to the attack in Sana'a and extended his apologies to the U.S., according to a statement released by the Yemeni Embassy in Washington, D.C. The statement added that the President instructed officials to \\"conduct an expeditious and thorough investigation into today's events\\" and confirmed that the perpetrators \\"will be prosecuted to the full extent of the law.\\" United States =Government= President Barack Obama, with Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton, delivering a statement at the White House on September 12, 2012 in which he condemned the attack on the U.S. Mission. U.S. President Barack Obama said that he \\"strongly condemned this outrageous attack\\" on U.S. diplomatic facilities. He further ordered that security be increased at all such facilities. Obama stated with respect to the death of four diplomats in Benghazi: \\"Today we mourn four more Americans who represent the very best of the United States of America. We will not waver in our commitment to see that justice is done for this terrible act. And make no mistake, justice will be done.\\" A Marine FAST team was sent to Libya to help with security. U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton said: \\"Some have sought to justify this vicious behavior as a response to inflammatory material posted on the internet. The United States deplores any intentional effort to denigrate the religious beliefs of others. But let me be clear: There is never any justification for violent acts of this kind.\\" She also said: \\"America's commitment to religious tolerance goes back to the very beginning of our nation. But let me be clear, there is no justification for this -- none. Violence like this is no way to honor a religion or faith and as long as there are those who would take innocent life in the name of God, the world will never know a true and lasting peace.\\" Minnesota Democrat Keith Ellison, the first Muslim elected to Congress, condemned both the film and the protests. He stated that the \\"amateurish and stupid\\" film was \\"deeply offensive\\" to \\"anyone who respects the faith of others\\", while at the same time emphasising that \\"the United States government had no role in creating this film. In fact, the government has condemned it and the American people have rejected it; it violates the American value of religious tolerance. Responding with violence is never justified. And those who think they are doing so in the name of Islam are wrong and ill informed.\\" U.S. Congressmen, including Rand Paul, Tom McClintock, and Jeff Landry, asked that aid to Egypt and Libya be halted or cut. U.S. Senators John McCain, Lindsey Graham and Joe Lieberman stated: \\"[W]e cannot give in to the temptation to believe that our support for the democratic aspirations of people in Libya, Egypt, and elsewhere in the broader Middle East is naive or mistaken. We cannot resign ourselves to the false belief that the Arab Spring is doomed to be defined not by the desire for democracy and freedom that has inspired millions of people to peaceful action, but by the dark fanaticism of terrorists.\\" If Americans would do this, it \\"would not only be a victory for the extremists and their associates, but a betrayal of everything for which Chris Stevens and his colleagues stood and gave their lives.\\" The Obama administration opened an investigation into whether the attack in Libya was a planned terrorist attack on the 11th anniversary of the September 11 attacks, because it was \\"too coordinated or professional to be spontaneous\\", rather than a spontaneous mob that was angry over a YouTube video criticising Islam. According to The New York Times and CNN, officials within the Obama administration have said that they believe the attack in Benghazi was deliberate, and reports indicate one or more pro-al Qaeda groups may have been involved in the attack. The United States Navy dispatched two s, and , to the Libyan coast. The destroyers are equipped with Tomahawk cruise missiles. American unmanned aerial vehicles were also sent to fly over Libya to search for the perpetrators of the attack. The Pentagon announced it had sent FAST Marines to Yemen to bolster U.S. embassy security there after the attack. Cairo embassy statement At 6:17 EST in the United States, 11 September - The embassy in Cairo released a statement: > The Embassy of the United States in Cairo condemns the continuing efforts by > misguided individuals to hurt the religious feelings of Muslims ‚Äì as we > condemn efforts to offend believers of all religions. Today, the 11th > anniversary of the September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks on the United > States, Americans are honoring our patriots and those who serve our nation > as the fitting response to the enemies of democracy. Respect for religious > beliefs is a cornerstone of American democracy. We firmly reject the actions > by those who abuse the universal right of free speech to hurt the religious > beliefs of other. At about 12:00 EST, protesters outside the Cairo embassy breach the wall and tear down U.S. flag. At about 16:00, the embassy posted a message on Twitter that read: \\"1) Thank you for your thoughts and prayers. 2) Of course we condemn breaches of our compound, we're the ones actually living through this. 3) Sorry, but neither breaches of our compound or angry messages will dissuade us from defending freedom of speech AND criticizing bigotry\\" ;Domestic political controversy Later in the day, Romney issued a statement saying: \\"It is disgraceful that the Obama Administration's first response was not to condemn attacks on our diplomatic missions, but to sympathize with those who waged the attacks\\". Republican National Committee Chairman Reince Priebus also released a statement that read: \\"Obama sympathizes with attackers in Egypt. Sad and pathetic\\"Washington Post RNC Chair: Obama ‚Äòsympathizes with attackers‚Äô The next day, Romney reiterated the statements: \\"I also believe the administration was wrong to stand by a statement sympathizing with a those who had breached our Embassy in Egypt instead of condemning their actions. The embassy in Cairo put out a statement after their grounds had been breached, protesters were inside the grounds. They reiterated that statement after the breach. I think it's a -- a terrible course for America to stand in apology for our values. ... It's their administration. Their administration spoke. The president takes responsibility not just for the words that come from his mouth but also from the words of his ambassadors, from his administration, from his embassies, from his State Department. They clearly sent mixed messages to the world. The statement that came from the administration -- and the embassy is the administration -- the statement that came from the administration was a statement which is akin to apology. And I think was a severe miscalculation.\\" Paul Ryan echoed Romney's criticism, saying: \\"The administration sent mixed signals to those who attacked our embassy in Egypt and mixed signals to the world.\\" When directly asked about Romney's statements, Obama told 60 Minutes that Romney \\"seems to have a tendency to shoot first and aim later.\\" Obama said that Romney \\"didn't have his facts right\\". The editorial board of the Denver Post noted that Romney's critique of the embassy's statement was \\"out [of] line,\\" but also stated: \\"This country cannot allow extremists anywhere to dictate what Americans speak, write, draw or film ... Sorry, provocative speech is not an abuse of free speech. It is precisely the speech the First Amendment exists to protect.\\"Editorial Board, Editorial: Deadly enemies of free speech, Denver Post, 12 September 2012. =Muslim community= The Council on American Islamic Relations (CAIR) condemned the attack. Imam Mohamed Magid, the president of the Islamic Society of North America, an umbrella organisation of regional Muslims, condemned the violence at a news conference standing alongside a Baptist minister, a rabbi, and Ali Aujali, the Libyan ambassador to the U.S. He said: \\"Those who did this act of violence fall into the trap of the people who want them to act that way.\\" Salam al- Marayati, president of the Los Angeles-based Muslim Public Affairs Council, said in a published statement that \\"America is our home and is home to Islam, like so many other religions. Anyone who attempts to promote the misconception that Muslims are not integrated into America is fomenting more fear and destructive behavior.\\" =Domestic commentary= Isobel Coleman has observed that one reason for why U.S. government institutions were attacked was \\"a widespread problem across the Arab world: People who have lived their lives largely under dictatorship simply cannot understand how a film can be made without government sanction.\\" Law professor Jack Balkin elaborated upon this point in an interview with The Atlantic: \\"Some Egyptians and Libyans think that any products of the U.S. media that make it to their countries have at least tacit U.S. government approval.

During World War II, Pannwitz worked as a cryptanalyst in the Department of Signal Intelligence Agency of the German Foreign Office () colloquially known as Pers Z S.  Education and thesis  Erika Pannwitz attended the Pannwitz Outdoor SchoolHer father was the physician Dr. Karl Pannwitz. The Pannwitz Outdoor School was founded by Dr. Gotthold Pannwitz, see Gr√ºndung der Schule im Jahr 1911 . in Hohenlychen until 10th grade, and graduated from Augusta State School in Berlin in 1922. She studied mathematics in Berlin, and also for a semester in Freiburg (1925) and G√∂ttingen (1928). After passing her teaching exam in 1927 (in mathematics, physics, and chemistry), Pannwitz was promoted in 1931 to Dr Phil at Friedrich Wilhelms University with doctoral advisors Heinz Hopf and Erhard Schmidt. Her thesis titled: Eine elementargeometrische Eigenschaft von Verschlingungen und Knoten (An elementary geometric property of entanglements and knots), which appeared two years later in the prestigious journal Mathematische Annalen, was honored opus eximium being considered an outstanding thesis. Both doctoral advisors wrote extraordinary statements about the thesis. Hopf in particular wrote eight pages of comments and left a summary quoted below: :The author has thus completely solved a difficult concrete problem that has been posed by completely independent investigations; It has achieved this goal by an expedient choice of new concepts, by understanding and profound insight into the difficult material presented to it, by the mastery of older methods and their new uses, and thus proving their scientific maturity in this first essay. :Since, in my judgment, both the objective scientific value of this work and the subjective performance it achieves exceed the level of good dissertations, I ask the faculty to accept the dissertation submitted by Miss Pannwitz as \\"eximium\\". Schmidt also wrote an extraordinary statement on the thesis: :I agree with the vote of Mr. Hopf. The topology is one of the most promising yet at the same time most difficult areas of mathematics, because the methodological-technical apparatus is still so in the beginning, that every valuable result can be achieved only with a high mass of strong ingenuity. The present work has enriched the topology with a series of extraordinarily beautiful sentences In her thesis, she established that every piecewise linear knot in general position (other than the unknot) has a quadrisecant, i.e., four collinear points. The topic was suggested to her by Otto Toeplitz.See footnote on page 629.Later the following studies appeared concerning quadrisecants: H. Morton and D. Mond: Closed curves with no quadrisecants.

Green: A natural framing of knots. In: Geometry & Topology. v. 2, 1998, pp. 31‚Äì64 (additivity of the knottedness invariant) and Elizabeth Denne: Alternating quadrisecants of knots (2005) . Later career In September 1930, Pannwitz became an editor of Jahrbuch √ºber die Fortschritte der Mathematik. From 1940 to 1945, she worked in the cryptography service (with Helmut Grunsky) as part of the war effort. After Germany's defeat in World War II, she briefly held an assistant position at Marburg University. In 1946, she returned to Berlin to work as an editor for Zentralblatt f√ºr Mathematik. Travel to work was awkward, especially after the construction of the Berlin Wall in 1961, because she lived in West Berlin and had to pass through checkpoints to reach the Zentralblatt offices in East Berlin. East Germany at that time had mandatory retirement at age 60, which she reached in 1964. From 1964 to 1969 she worked at the Zentralblatt office in West Berlin.See also Bernd Wegner: Mathematik-Information im Wechsel der Zeiten und politischen Systeme. Although Pannwitz had written what was considered an outstanding thesis, throughout her career, she never held a regular academic position. The reasons for this are unknown, but there could have been some element of discrimination, perhaps due to her gender or politics or both.

It was loosely remade in 1994. The film was released by American International Pictures as a double feature with Shake, Rattle and Rock. Plot Audrey Barton is the teen daughter of rich, irresponsible parents. When school classmate Tommy brings her home from a date, they spy on Ruth Barton, her mother, passionately kissing a neighbor. Audrey's girlfriends have troubled home lives, too. Mary Rubach has a strict father who doesn't approve of her boyfriend Bob being 20. Angie Forrest's mother is off honeymooning with a third husband. Angie is glad when her brother Tony pays a visit, bringing along his girl, Dixie Jackson. Tommy tattles at school about what he saw Audrey's mother do. Taunted by another girl at school, Audrey gets into a fight and is expelled, putting her graduation at risk. Ruth shows no concern whatsoever with her daughter's dilemma, telling her that finding a man is more important than getting an education anyway. George Barton displays little interest in his daughter's situation, either. Bob joins the Army and urges Mary to elope, but her dad beats him up. Angie's brother leaves for Los Angeles, leaving her depressed. When a birthday party for Audrey is spoiled by the grown-ups, spiking the punch with gin, Audrey's had enough. She takes her gift from her parents, a new convertible, picks up Mary and Angie and the three girls head for L.A., running away from home. Knowing the police will be looking for them, the girls ditch Audrey's car and steal one. They look up Tony and Dixie, who find the girls jobs in a seedy dance hall. A remorseful Ruth hires a private detective to find her daughter. The cops come looking, too, investigating the stolen car, which Angie speeds off in, right over a cliff, resulting in her death. Mary's dad relents, letting her join Bob at his army base. Audrey returns home, her mother promising that things there will be better.

It includes acoustic versions of several of his earlier songs, as well as new material. Production Chrisye and Erwin Gutawa, a conductor who had coordinated Chrisye's first solo concert in 1994, began working on what was to become AkustiChrisye in 1995. Realising that Western artists such as Frank Sinatra had found success in rearranging their older songs, the two decided to do the same with Chrisye's older work. They chose the songs \\"Kala Sang Surya Tenggelam\\" (\\"When the Sun Set\\"), \\"Anak Jalanan\\" (\\"Street Child\\"), and \\"Smaradhana\\" (\\"Passion\\") from the 1978 album Sabda Alam, as well as \\"Gita Cinta ‚Äì Puspa Indah\\" (\\"Love Song ‚Äì Beautiful Flower\\"), a remix of two songs from the 1980 album Puspa Indah. The album also saw several new songs, written by other artists. The album focused on using acoustic music, which Chrisye described as simple but still requiring serious work. At the time the genre had seen a resurgence in Indonesia, with the state broadcaster TVRI carrying several shows which featured acoustic music. The audio was recorded at Studio 301 in Sydney, Australia, with a full orchestra providing backing in a period of three hours. Gutawa had chosen to record in Australia as better equipment was available there, and, although expensive, Aciu Widjaja of Musica Studios agreed immediately. Release and reception The album was released as a cassette by Musica Studios in 1996 to popular success. \\"Damai Bersamamu\\" was the album's only single, while both it and \\"Kala Sang Surya Tenggelam\\" received music videos. Chrisye would later emphasise acoustic music on his 1997 album Kala Cinta Menggoda (When Love Tempts), and continue his collaboration with Gutawa until 2002's Dekade (Decade). AkustiChrisye has been reissued twice, once as a CD in 2004 and once as part of the Chrisye Masterpiece Trilogy Limited Edition in 2007.

(previously known as Pilsen-Little Village Community Mental Health Center, Inc.) is a non-profit organization that has historically serviced the predominantly Latino communities of Pilsen and Little Village in the city of Chicago. An outgrowth of a federally funded program which began in 1967, Pilsen Wellness Center was founded by Albert Vazquez in 1975. Since that time, the agency has grown into an organization with a diverse funding base, offering a comprehensive array of social services through several programs. Mission statement The mission of the Pilsen- Little Village Community Mental Health Center, Inc. is to provide holistic health services to the Chicago, metropolitan community through the effective management of all organizational and community resources.

State audits In 1999 an audit conducted by the Office of the Auditor General for the state of Illinois uncovered over $200,000 worth of expenditures, which were inappropriately charged to State programs at taxpayer expense and sometimes without documentation. According to the report the CEO took out a $15,000 interest-free loan from the center, which is prohibited by state law. The money was repaid 18 months later after which the CEO awarded to himself a $17,500 salary bonus the following week. 97 employees were also paid over $20,000 in bonuses that were initially classified as office expenses and not report on their W-2s. The findings led to the resignation of Albert Vazquez, the CEO and founder of the agency. In 2008, according to a Fox News investigation, Illinois state lawmakers ordered the Office of the Auditor General to conduct a special audit of Pilsen Wellness Center. During the audit the State found that almost a third of the agency‚Äôs employees did not have paperwork on file to prove they were qualified for their jobs. Additionally, the auditors also discovered that a relative of the current CEO, Francisco Cisneros, received a large raise just six days after being hired. Fox News investigation In 2010 a Fox News investigation alleged that the CEO and executive director of the Pilsen Wellness Center hired numerous family members to work at the agency. According to internal agency documents and interviews obtained by Fox News, the director‚Äôs wife, mother, son, three brothers, four sisters and two nieces all had jobs at the agency. The investigation also revealed that two adult children of Illinois State Senator Martin Sandoval were employed by the agency. Sandoval was one of several lawmakers who \\"steered state funding\\" to the center, the news report said. References External links *Pilsen Wellness Center, Inc.

It commemorated the septcentenary of the devotion to Our Lady of Europe. The image on the stamp was a photograph of the statue of the Virgin and Child found in the Shrine of Our Lady of Europe at Europa Point in Gibraltar. The stamp was the first joint issue between Gibraltar and the Vatican. While joint issues between the Vatican and other authorities were uncommon for most of the 20th century, there was a substantial increase in such joint issues in the early 21st century. Gibraltar's history of joint issues with authorities other than the Vatican is remarkable for one that was unsuccessful. A joint issue with Israel was cancelled at the last minute in 2011 when the British Government found the planned image of the David Citadel in Jerusalem to be too controversial. History Shrine of Our Lady of Europe at Europa Point In 2009, the Vatican and the British Overseas Territory of Gibraltar released a joint issue of stamps to commemorate the 700th anniversary of Gibraltar's devotion to Our Lady of Europe. The stamps, which featured an image of the hand-carved statue of the Virgin and Child in the shrine at Europa Point, were the design of photographer Stephen Perera. It represented the first time that Gibraltar participated in a stamp joint issue with the Vatican. The sheetlet for the Gibraltar stamp had a background image of St. Peter's Basilica and Square, while the sheet for the Vatican stamp featured the Rock of Gibraltar. The Gibraltar Philatelic Bureau also released a limited edition folder, containing both the Vatican and Gibraltar stamps. The set consisted of two sheetlets, each with four stamps, measuring 30 x 40 mm. The limited edition folder also included information on Our Lady of Europe, as well as images of the statue and shrine. Pope John Paul II sanctioned Our Lady of Europe as the official Patroness of Gibraltar in 1979. The process of releasing the joint issue thirty years later involved Bishop Charles Caruana and Father Charles Azzopardi consulting with the Gibraltar Philatelic Bureau to determine how best to celebrate the septcentenary. Meetings were also scheduled at various stamp exhibitions and, finally, the Vatican Philatelic Bureau. The photographer Perera had the distinction of being the first Gibraltarian to design a stamp that was released by another country. The joint issue and its design were approved by various parties, including Queen Elizabeth II, the Government of Gibraltar, Pope Benedict XVI, and Bishop Caruana, the Bishop of Gibraltar. In Gibraltar, the official release of the stamp occurred on 10 February 2009 at the Shrine of Our Lady of Europe at Europa Point, the southernmost portion of the country. Other joint issues Rugerius Boscovich (1711-1787) The Vatican City State issued its first stamps in 1929, the same year that it was established under the Lateran Treaties. It released its first joint issue in 1969. Joint issues of stamps by the Vatican and other countries were uncommon for most of the twentieth century. In 2000, the Vatican and Poland released a joint issue designed by Czeslaw Slania which commemorated the eightieth birthday of John Paul II. However, the early twenty-first century saw a substantial increase in joint issues. In 2003, a set released by the Vatican and Poland celebrated the twenty-fifth anniversary of John Paul II's pontificate. The following year, a joint issue of the same countries commemorated the pope's return visits to Poland. In 2005, five of the eleven stamp sets released by the Vatican were joint issues. There have also been joint issues with Germany since Benedict XVI became Pope. In 2011, the Vatican and Croatia released a joint issue which commemorated the tercentenary of the birth of Rugerius Boscovich (1711 - 1787). Gibraltar issued its first postage stamps in 1886. It has released joint issues with authorities other than the Vatican, including Malta and San Marino in 2010. However, the January 2012 issue of the Hebrew philatelic journal Shovel disclosed that a joint release of a stamp for Gibraltar and Israel was cancelled when the British Government raised last-minute objections to the depiction of the David Citadel in Jerusalem. When Britain insisted that the image be replaced with one of Tel Aviv, after the stamps were already printed and set to be released in June 2011, the Israel Philatelic Service withdrew from the project. The design had been approved by authorities in Gibraltar, and had featured the David Citadel and the Rock of Gibraltar, with the sentence: \\"Our friendship unites the west with the east of the Mediterranean.\\" The reason given for the insistence on the part of Britain that the image be altered was that Jerusalem was \\"politically controversial.\\" When Britain requested a Tel Aviv image not only on the stamps issued by Gibraltar, but also the ones issued by Israel, the project was cancelled. Gibraltar reimbursed Israel for the expenses related to printing of the stamps, and acknowledged that British approval should have been sought earlier in the process.
