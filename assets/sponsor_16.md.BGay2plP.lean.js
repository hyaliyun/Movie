As its name implies, it is the middle area of the Lower Peninsula. Lower Michigan is said to resemble a mitten, and Mid Michigan corresponds roughly to the thumb and palm, stretching from Michigan's eastern shoreline along Lake Huron into the fertile rolling plains of the Michigan Basin. The region contains cities of moderate size, including Flint, Saginaw, and the state capital of Lansing. Definitions For the most part, Central Michigan and Mid Michigan are synonymous with each other, representing generally the same geographic area of Michigan. However, some definitions of Central Michigan and Mid Michigan can vary significantly, depending on one's point of reference. * The Greater Lansing area, sometimes called the Capitol Region, includes the area surrounding the state capitol of Lansing and nearby East Lansing. * The Greater Tri-Cities area, also called the Great Lakes Bay Region, is the area surrounding the Saginaw Bay including the cities of Saginaw, Bay City, Midland and can be expanded to include Mt. Pleasant as well. * The Flint area is included in Mid Michigan, and can also be considered a part of Metro Detroit. * The Thumb is a peninsula that surrounded by Lake Huron in the east-central area of the state. This area is sometimes dubbed the Blue Water Area. Other definitions Central or Mid Michigan can also include areas that are referred to as Southern Michigan. This is loosely defined and can refer to a region in the south-central portion of the state characterized by the Irish Hills. The region includes the Adrian, Jackson, and Hillsdale areas which are also considered a part of Southeast Michigan. Portions of Central or Mid Michigan can overlap with portions of Western Michigan. For example, areas of Montcalm County could fall into both regions, with the west side of the county such as Greenville aligning with West Michigan, and eastern portions identifying more with Central Michigan. Also, some areas may overlap with what is known as Northern Michigan. These areas, such as Clare, Gladwin, and Arenac County are along the border of the two regions and can be considered parts of both, depending on your frame of reference. Portions of Metro Detroit can overlap with Central Michigan, especially the counties of Genesee, Lapeer, Livingston and St. Clair are statistically included in Metro Detroit however geographically lie in Mid Michigan. Geography The Grand River in Lansing. Bay City, looking East from Veterans Memorial Park Downtown Flint looking northwest, taken from the former Genesee Towers. Blue Water Bridges, an important international crossing. See also: Protected areas of Michigan and Geography of Michigan. The region includes many rivers including the Grand River, Red Cedar River, Saginaw River, Tittabawassee River, Shiawassee River and Flint River. A drainage divide occurs in Central Michigan, causing the Grand River to flow west into Lake Michigan and the Saginaw River to empty into the Saginaw Bay. The terrain has rolling hills and plains with fertile soil. Agriculture dominates in the rural areas, where corn, soybeans, sugar beets, and hay are grown. The region has mostly small towns with a few cities of notable size. Most of the area is part of the Roman Catholic Diocese of Lansing or Roman Catholic Diocese of Saginaw.Archdiocese of Lansing home page and history , dioceseoflansing.org Principal cities See also: Michigan Municipalities by Population Central Michigan has several cities of regional and geographic importance: * Lansing, is the capital of Michigan and centrally located in the Lower Peninsula. It is the fifth largest city in the state. The Lansing-East Lansing metropolitan area is the third largest metro area in Michigan. * Flint is the sixth largest city in the state and an important center for Michigan's automotive industry. * The Tri-Cities area includes Midland, Bay City, and Saginaw.

The territorial effects of the Treaty of Saginaw. The Mid-Michigan area was predominately Ojibwe territory prior to colonization. One of the first European settlements in the region was the French Fort St. Joseph in present-day Port Huron in 1686. The area that became Michigan opened up to European settlement following the French and Indian war. Later in the 1800s Lewis Cass would negotiate the Treaty of Saginaw, in which Ojibwe land was handed over to form much of present-day Mid-Michigan. The opening of the Erie Canal brought vast numbers of settlers to the region, as population started growing northward from Ohio. The first settlers to the area cleared the land for the lumber industry. Forests of the Thumb and Saginaw Valley provided much of the lumber to feed the growing United States. The convenient access to transportation provided by the Saginaw River and its numerous tributaries fueled a massive expansion in population and economic activity. As the trees were being cut down in the region, logs were floated down the rivers to sawmills located in Saginaw, destined to be loaded onto ships and later railroad cars. Flint was also a lumber boom town, with the city turning lumber into carriages and wagons, which would later give way to the automobile industry. Michigan became a state in 1837, with the State Capitol in Detroit until the winter of 1847 when the state constitution required that the capital be moved from Detroit to a more central and safer location in the interior of the state. Many were concerned about Detroit's proximity to British-controlled Canada, which had captured Detroit in the War of 1812. The United States had recaptured the city in 1813, but these events led to the dire need to have the center of government relocated away from hostile British territory. There was also concern with Detroit's strong influence over Michigan politics, being the largest city in the state as well as the capital city.\\"Lansing and Its Yesterdays\\", published by the State Journal Company, Published January 1, 1930 Unable to publicly reach a consensus because of constant political wrangling, the Michigan House of Representatives privately chose the Township of Lansing out of frustration. When announced, many present openly laughed that such an insignificant settlement was now the capital city of Michigan. Two months later, Governor William L. Greenly signed into law the act of the legislature officially making Lansing Township the state capital. Persons of European ancestry have formed the overwhelming majority of the population since the late 19th century. Farmers, mostly of English and Scots-Irish immigrants, many of whom arrived from Canada. Other settlers of the same ancestry migrated from eastern states such as New York, and Pennsylvania, as well as from New England. After the land had been lumbered off, farming dominated the rural landscape of Central Michigan. Corn, soy beans, navy beans, and sugar beets are now commercially grown in these areas today. Later 19th- and 20th-century residents included Polish and German immigrants who migrated from Europe through the Detroit area. Many of the customs, much of the regional lifestyle, and even the local accent, strongly reflect these origins. Saginaw County, in particular Frankenmuth, is such an example of Bavarian Culture in Mid- Michigan. On the eastern edge of the region, a large Canadian influence can be found in St. Clair County where Canadian culture and language has become integrated cities along the Canada‚ÄìUS border. Huron County in the Thumb has a heritage of Polish ancestry, while Clare is known for its Irish roots. Ransom Eli Olds, the founder and namesake of Oldsmobile. The state's economy underwent a transformation at the turn of the 20th century. Many individuals, including Ransom E. Olds, John and Horace Dodge, Henry Leland, David Dunbar Buick, Henry Joy, Charles King, and Henry Ford, provided the concentration of engineering know-how and technological enthusiasm to start the birth of the automotive industry. In Lansing, Olds Motor Vehicle Company was founded in August 1897. The company went through many changes, including a buyout, between its founding to 1905 when founder Ransom E. Olds started his new REO Motor Car Company, which would last in Lansing for another 70 years. In Flint, William C. Durant's Buick became the largest manufacturer of automobiles by 1908. In 1908, Durant founded General Motors, filing incorporation papers in New Jersey, with headquarters in Flint. GM moved its headquarters to Detroit in the mid-1920s.General Motors  Corporate Information ‚Äì History  GM Durant lost control of GM twice during his lifetime. On the first occasion, he befriended Louis Chevrolet and founded Chevrolet, which was a runaway success. He used the capital from this success to buy back share control. Flint would later be the site of the GM and United Auto Workers Flint sit-down strike. Herbert Henry Dow, the founder of Dow Chemical. In 1897, Canadian-born chemist Herbert Henry Dow, who invented a new method of extracting the bromine that was trapped underground in brine at Midland, Michigan formed Dow Chemical. Dow originally sold only bleach and potassium bromide, and has since expanded to be the third largest chemical producer in the world. Beginning in the late 1960s, urban areas including Flint, Saginaw, and Lansing experienced a large amount of deindustrialization and subsequent depopulation and urban decay. As auto jobs left these regions, rates of crime, unemployment and poverty increased. Initially, this took the form of \\"white flight\\" that afflicted many urban industrialized American towns and cities. This decline was exacerbated by the 1973 oil crisis and the U.S. auto industry's subsequent loss of market share to imports. The result meant white families moved to the suburbs, with leaving large hispanic and African-American populations in the urban centers. In Lansing, recent gentrification, the placement of refugees, and international students attending Michigan State have made the Greater Lansing a very culturally diverse area. Michigan remains a leading auto-producing state in the U.S., with the industry primarily located throughout the Midwestern United States, Ontario, Canada, and the Southern United States. Michigan typically ranks third or fourth in overall Research & development (R&D;) expenditures in the U.S. Mid-Michigan is home to one of the state's leading research institutions, Michigan State University which makes up the University Research Corridor. Michigan's public universities attract more than $1.5 B in research and development grants each year. Founded in 1855 in East Lansing as the nation's first land-grant institution, Michigan State University has been a pioneer in research and the cultural center of Mid- Michigan. The university has made significant contributions in agriculture and pioneered the studies of packaging, hospitality business, plant biology, supply chain management, music therapy, and communication sciences. Michigan State frequently ranks among the top 30 public universities in the United States and the top 100 research universities in the world. Economy Straw bales in an area field. Central Michigan's economy is primarily agricultural, and some automobile manufacturing. Agriculture Major crops grown in this region include corn, sugar beets, and soy beans. The Michigan Sugar Company, which is a cooperative owned by 1,250 farmers, operates factories in Bay City, Caro, Croswell, and Sebewaing. Livestock and dairy farms also make up the agricultural landscape of Central Michigan. Koegel Meat Company is headquartered in Flint and is a major producer of sausages and processed meats.

While the theory of market microstructure applies to the exchange of real or financial assets, more evidence is available on the microstructure of financial markets due to the availability of transactions data from them. The major thrust of market microstructure research examines the ways in which the working processes of a market affect determinants of transaction costs, prices, quotes, volume, and trading behavior. In the twenty-first century, innovations have allowed an expansion into the study of the impact of market microstructure on the incidence of market abuse, such as insider trading, market manipulation and broker-client conflict. Definition Maureen O‚ÄôHara defines market microstructure as ‚Äú[...] the study of the process and outcomes of exchanging assets under explicit trading rules. While much of economics abstracts from the mechanics of trading, microstructure literature analyzes how specific trading mechanisms affect the price formation process.‚ÄùO'Hara, Maureen, Market Microstructure Theory, Blackwell, Oxford, 1995, , p.1. The National Bureau of Economic Research has a market microstructure research group that, it says, ‚Äúis devoted to theoretical, empirical, and experimental research on the economics of securities markets, including the role of information in the price discovery process, the definition, measurement, control, and determinants of liquidity and transactions costs, and their implications for the efficiency, welfare, and regulation of alternative trading mechanisms and market structures.‚ÄùNBER Working Group Descriptions Issues Microstructure deals with issues of market structure and design, price formation and price discovery, transaction and timing cost, volatility, information and disclosure, and market maker and investor behavior. Market structure and design This factor focuses on the relationship between price determination and trading rules. In some markets, for instance, assets are traded primarily through dealers who keep an inventory (e.g., new cars), while other markets are facilitated primarily by brokers who act as intermediaries (e.g. housing). One of the important questions in microstructure research is how market structure affects trading costs and whether one structure is more efficient than another. Market microstructure relate the behavior of market participants, whether investors, dealers, investor admins to authority, hence microstructure is a critical factor that affects the investment decision as well as investment exit. Price formation and discovery This factor focuses on the process by which the price for an asset is determined. For example, in some markets prices are formed through an auction process (e.g. eBay), in other markets prices are negotiated (e.g., new cars) or simply posted (e.g. local supermarket) and buyers can choose to buy or not. Transaction cost and timing cost This factor focuses on transaction cost and timing cost and the impact of transaction cost on investment returns and execution methods. Transaction costs include order processing costs, adverse selection costs, inventory holding costs, and monopoly power. Their impact on liquidation of large portfolios has been investigated by Neil Chriss and Robert AlmgrenR.Almgren and N.Chriss, \\"Optimal execution of portfolio transactions\\" J. Risk, 3 (Winter 2000/2001) pp.5‚Äì39 and their impact on hedging portfolios has been studied by Tianhui Li and Robert Almgren.  Volatility  This factor focuses on the tendency for prices to fluctuate. Prices may change in response to new information that affects the value of the instrument (i.e. fundamental volatility), or in response to the trading activity of impatient traders and its effect of liquidity (i.e. transitory volatility). Information and disclosure This factor focuses on the market information, and more particularly, the availability of market information among market participants, and transparency, and the impact of the information on the behavior of the market participants. Market information can include price, breadth, spread, reference data, trading volumes, liquidity or risk factors, and counterparty asset tracking, etc. References Further reading * Foucault, Pagano, Roell, Market Liquidity: Theory, Evidence, and Policy, Oxford University Press, 2013, * Jalil, Abdul and Feridun, Mete (2010) Explaining exchange rate movements: An application of the market microstructure approach on the Pakistani foreign exchange market.

It has an average body length of 170‚Äì198 mm, a snout to anus length of 80‚Äì93 mm, a tail measurement of 90‚Äì105 mm, a hind foot of 17.5 mm, ear length of 18 mm and a weight of 20‚Äì25 grams. The thin tail is also gray, but lighter on the bottom. The tail is longer than the body. Kangaroo Island dunnarts are dimorphic, with males larger than females. The Kangaroo Island dunnart is listed as Critically Endangered by International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN). The population was believed to be less than 500 before the 2019‚Äì2020 Australian bushfires. Following the fires, it is believed that only about 50 individuals exist. Distribution and habitat This dasyurid is found only on the western half of Kangaroo Island in South Australia, the island's only endemic mammal. The species inhabits mallee heath on laterite soils. It is believed that the Kangaroo Island dunnart originally lived over the whole island. Today, there are six sites in which Kangaroo Island dunnarts have been found. All are either in the Flinders Chase National Park or the Ravine des Casoars Wilderness Protection Area, both on the western part of the island. Recent attempts to locate Kangaroo Island dunnarts on the eastern portion of the island have failed. Diet The Kangaroo Island dunnart is nocturnal. Their diet consist of invertebrates. Studies of their feces showed that the major component of their diet is ants and spiders. Scorpions, beetles, and grasshoppers are also eaten. Social organization and breeding Little is known of the Kangaroo Island dunnarts' behaviour. However, they are believed to be polyestrous, breeding twice a year. Based on trapping of juveniles, it is believed they breed in mid-September to October and again in November to December. Their gestation period is approximately 12 days. Little is known about parental care. It is thought that males only live for one mating season, whereas females may live to breed for two seasons. Conservation The Kangaroo Island dunnart is listed as critically endangered on the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species. The Australian government first developed a recovery plan in 2011. (3-paragraph summary; archive) As recently as the early 2000s, the wildlife research community was uncertain as to whether the species population in the wild was actually so low, or whether they were just particularly well concealed. Before the 2019‚Äì2020 bushfires, it was believed that there were fewer than 500 individuals. The Kangaroo Island dunnart is believed to have had a range of the entire island at one time. Today, it has only been found on six sites on the western portion of Kangaroo Island. The population decrease has been attributed to several causes. Habitat loss is believed to be a primary cause. Although no clear habitat preference has been identified, Kangaroo Island dunnarts seem to be dependent on some low vegetation. The eastern portion of Kangaroo Island has been largely converted from the natural habitat for agricultural and grazing purposes. About 50% of Kangaroo Island's natural habitat has been cleared and Kangaroo Island dunnarts have not been found in the cleared regions. Also, tree dieback caused by Phytophthora cinnamomi, a water mould, has also affected Kangaroo Island dunnart populations. Feral cats may also be a factor in the decreased population. Kangaroo Island dunnart populations are considered particularly vulnerable due to their small range, since a single event can negatively affect a large proportion of the population. Forest fire is a major concern and the major fires in 2019‚Äì2020 destroyed much of their remaining habitat. In May 2019, months prior to the start of the 2019‚Äì2020 bushfires, a workshop on the status of the dunnart was held on Kangaroo Island that included government representatives as well as scientists and landowners. The minutes from that meeting provided considerable information on the Kangaroo Island dunnart's status prior to the bushfires. NOTE: The (original) link auto-downloads file to local device. The population was devastated by the bushfires, which likely wiped out a majority of an individuals; however, dunnarts have still been sighted in burnt and unburnt areas following the fires, raising hopes for recovery.

Biography Hal Kemp was born in Marion, Alabama. He formed his first band in high school, and by the age of 19 led a University of North Carolina band, the Carolina Club Orchestra. They sailed to England, where they made their first recordings in London, and on their return journey made the acquaintance of the Prince of Wales, who performed with them. As a result, the band was mentioned in US press reports, and on their return received several offers of contracts. In 1927, Kemp formed his own orchestra, which at various times featured Skinnay Ennis, Bunny Berigan, and John Scott Trotter, and the band became a popular jazz orchestra in the late 1920s. Biography by Bruce Eder, Allmusic.com. Retrieved 3 March 2020 Hal Kemp: Biography, Parabrisas.com. Retrieved 3 March 2020 In the 1930s, with the economic and social challenges of the Great Depression, Kemp's band became better known for more soothing \\"sweet\\" dance music. From 1932 to 1934, they performed at the Blackhawk Restaurant in Chicago, and appeared regularly on radio broadcasts. They became well-known nationally, and secured a contract with Brunswick Records. Most of the vocals on their recordings were by Skinnay Ennis, whose vocal style and the arrangements by Trotter, which featured staccato triplets by the trumpeters and clarinets played through megaphones, gave Kemp's records a distinctive sound. Kemp and his orchestra had a number of hit records, including \\"Shuffle Off to Buffalo\\" (1933), \\"In the Middle of a Kiss\\" (1935), \\"There's a Small Hotel\\" (1936), \\"When I'm With You\\" (1936), \\"This Year's Kisses\\" (1937), and \\"Where or When\\" (1937). From 1937, Kemp recorded for Victor Records. His other recordings included \\"Got A Date With An Angel\\", \\"Heart Of Stone\\", \\"Lamplight\\", \\"The Music Goes 'Round And Around\\", \\"You're The Top\\", \\"Bolero\\", \\"Gloomy Sunday\\", \\"Lullaby Of Broadway\\", and many others. In 1936, John Scott Trotter left, being succeeded as arranger by Hal Mooney and Lou Busch. Ennis left in 1938, and Bob Allen became the band's featured singer. With the rising popularity of swing bands such as those of Benny Goodman and Tommy Dorsey, the popularity of Kemp's orchestra declined and there were many changes in band membership, though they continued to make film appearances. Hal Kemp died in Madera, California in 1940, aged 36, following a road accident while driving from Los Angeles to a performance in San Francisco in foggy conditions. His car was hit by an oncoming truck, and he died in hospital from pneumonia two days later. The orchestra remained operational for some time after Kemp's death, led by singer Art Jarrett, but disbanded in the early 1940s.

Search brought together numerous conflicting groups to find ways to peacefully resolve issues using independent media programming, track II diplomacy, and traditional peace building tactics. John Marks, Search's founder and former president, received an award in 2006 from the Skoll Foundation for social entrepreneurship. In 2008, Search for Common Ground was awarded the Benjamin Franklin Award for Public Diplomacy by the United States Department of State. Shamil Idriss became President and CEO in September 2014. Prior to taking on his role with Search, Shamil was the CEO for Soliya, and served as Executive Director of the Alliance of Civilizations Media Fund which merged with Soliya in 2009. In 2005, he was appointed by then-UN Secretary-General Kofi Annan as Deputy Director of the UN Alliance of Civilizations. He served on the Steering Committee of the World Economic Forum's Council of 100 Leaders and is a member of the World Economic Forum's Young Global Leaders and of the ASMA Society's Muslim Leaders of Tomorrow. History Search was founded in 1982 by John Marks, a former United States Department of State diplomat. He knew that conflict turns into violence when people focus on their differences rather than on their commonalities, and wanted a new way of connecting people across these differences. When Search was founded, it focused on facilitating cooperation between the United States and the Soviet Union. The first project Search worked on was facilitating a U.S.‚ÄëSoviet task force on Lebanon. This task force developed a concept of a multilateral, regional approach to peace in the Middle East. Their idea was to bring together different ethnicities to create peace. This plan was later adopted, through Search's help with negotiations, to end the Israeli-Jordanian war.The New Humanitarians, ed. Chris E Stout, p. 193 Since its founding, the organization has expanded its work to 30 countries in Africa, Asia, the Middle East, and parts of Eastern Europe. Search's first office in the Middle East was established in 1991. The organization started working in Europe in 1994, in Africa in 1995, and in Asia in 2002.

Common Ground Productions An internal arm of Search is Common Ground Productions, or CG Productions. This arm is responsible for the media production of Search, including radio, television, and internet programming. Programming includes Radio =Radio for Peacebuilding Africa= Radio for Peacebuilding Africa was a program founded in 2003 that trained journalists in peacebuilding, conflict resolution, and acting on commonalities. =Studio Ijambo= Common Ground Productions helped create Burundi's independent radio studio, Studio Ijambo, in 1995, after fears that the Rwandan genocide of 1994 would spread to neighboring countries. A 2000 poll of listeners found that 82% of people in Burundi thought that Studio Ijambo \\"helped reconciliation a lot\\". The studio employs an ethically mixed staff of Hutus and Tutsis, who present an ethnically united front to an otherwise divided country. Studio Ijambo has been credited with playing a key role in decentralizing the media in Burundi and building local capacity for news coverage. =Radio soap operas= Next to the BBC, Search is the largest producer of radio soap operas in the world, and in countries like Sierra Leone‚Äîwhich recently emerged from a civil war‚Äîits programming is listened to by over 90% of the population that has access to a radio. The radio was the most important form of mass communication after the civil war in Sierra Leone because there were three functioning radio stations in the country.Rutgers University, Radio Waves Spread Peace in Africa =The Talking Drum Studios= The radio studios in Sierra Leone and Liberia not only promote peace, but also HIV/AIDS prevention. TDS-Liberia has released several public service announcements, created billboards and handed out T‚Äëshirts and condoms at events. They also provide children and youth with platforms for expression, through programs such as Sisi Lorpu and Golden Kids News. Television Programming for CG Productions include: =Africa: The Search For Common Ground= It was produced in the late 1990s as a 13‚Äëpart series on the conflicts and struggles facing the African continent. It specifically highlights issues in 16 countries. The series, co‚Äëproduced by Ubuntu TV and Film Productions/Media Peace Centre and the South African Broadcast Corporation (SABC), was broadcast by TV and radio in English, French and Portuguese. The series has been broadcast in 22 countries in 40 local dialects, as well as the three languages it was produced in. =\\"The President\\" (Jerusalem)= In Jerusalem, Search for Common Ground and Ma'an Network produced a new reality television program called The President, designed to promote democratic values and political engagement among Palestinian youth. Aired in 2013, the first season of The President challenged young Palestinians to win votes and become the new, mock Palestinian \\"Youth President.\\" Twenty-four contestants were filmed reacting to everything from a staged assassination attempt to an impromptu press conference. They debated a range of political and social issues regarding a future Palestinian state living side by side with Israel. Eight finalists became CEO for a day at major companies including Coca-Cola and Jibrini Dairy. The show's challenges expanded internationally when the four finalists became Palestinian Ambassadors to Russia, Turkey, Jordan, and Egypt. With a live audience in primetime, the show ended with the first ever televised Palestinian political debate between the two finalists moderated by a seasoned journalist. After, viewers picked up their mobiles and elected their new mock president via SMS. Approximately 170,000 SMS messages were calculated to \\"elect\\" the winner. Search's evaluations indicate that approximately 1 million Palestinian households watched the first season. Season 2 generated an even larger following. =Nashe Maalo (Macedonia)= In Macedonia, a joint effort between the producers of Sesame StreetImpact is the Mantra: The 'Common Ground' Approach to Media, Track Two, vol. 7 No. 4, December 1998. Track Two is a publication of the Centre for Conflict Resolution (South Africa) and CG Productions produced a children's show called Nashe Maalo (translation: Our Neighborhood). The show aired in the early 2000s, and it promoted mutual tolerance and respect between the different ethnic and religious groups in Macedonia. =\\"Pahunch\\" (Nepal)= Pahunch is a reality show by Search for Common Ground Nepal, aired from September to December 2016. The goal of the show is to increase mutual trust between the Nepali police and local communities. The reality show features eight contestants from all walks of life who, with the mentorship of Nepali police officers, solve fictional cases of homicide, burglary, domestic violence, human trafficking, and more, raising awareness of the daily challenges faced by law enforcement. Season 2 of Pahunch is currently in production. =\\"Madam President\\" (Middle East Region)= Madam President is a 13-episode drama, which started airing across the Middle East and North Africa in November 2015. It is now available on Fcebook and Amazon Video. It tells the story of Noura Sa'ad, a politician from the fictional country of Jabalein, played by Lebanese star Carmen Lebbos. The drama showcases examples of female leadership and encourages political participation by women and youth. =\\"Madam Prime Minister\\" (Nepal)= Madam Prime Minister (Singha Durbar, \\"The Lion's Palace\\", in Nepali) is a 13-episode drama show which debuted in November, 2015. The show tells the story of Aasha Singh, the fictional first female Prime Minister of Nepal, played by Nepali star Gauri Malla. Over the course of 13 episodes, Madam Prime Minister showcased examples of female leadership, positive gender roles, and democratic values. The show was funded by USAID and created by Search For Common Ground‚ÄìNepal, along with production partner Mila Productions. =The Team TV series= An ongoing project of CG Productions is The Team (L'Equipe). Using the popularity of football (called soccer in America), the show uses sports as a metaphor to unification while addressing local, deep-rooted conflict. The show follows specific characters on a football team who must learn to work together to overcome their differences and win the game. The show is specifically tailored to the country in which it airs. Each country has different issues it faces, and the scripts represent these differences. The cast, writers and production crews are, whenever possible, all indigenous to the country. In the DRC, The Team deals specifically with women's rights. Mobile cinema In many countries in Africa, Search has introduced mobile cinema. These programs bring CG Production works into rural villages and expose more people to topics and discussion. In the DRC, Search has introduced mobile cinema dealing specifically with women's rights. Women in the DRC have been the victims of a brutal sexual assault war that has increased in intensity over the last few years. According to UN estimates, close to \\"3,500 females were raped by soldiers, militiamen, and civilians during the first six months\\" of 2009, compared to 4,800 rapes for the whole of 2008. Search used Mobile Cinema in places like Kenya as a tool to broadcast The Team to a large audience who would otherwise not be exposed to it. Philanthropic influence Members of the organization have worked for years to transform philanthropic decision-making processes by facilitating dialog between grant-makers and grantees. The process led to a youth program that bridges communities of wealth and social entrepreneurship. It also inspired a series of meetings at the United Nations on the idea of young philanthropy, and the Nexus Global Youth Summit. Partners in Humanity The Partners in Humanity (PiH) program aims to allay feelings of fear and suspicion based on perceived and real injustices, stereotypes, and inequalities. The mission of Partners in Humanity is to change the way individuals think and feel about the issues, stereotypes and tensions that face Muslim-Western relations, which in turn will facilitate action. The program started in 2003 at a meeting of over 60 international NGOs, media professionals, governmental agencies and international organizations. The meeting was held in Jordan, and was hosted by Search and His Royal Highness Prince Hassan bin Talal. In addition to working with Search offices in the United States, Rabat, Jakarta, and Jerusalem, Partners in Humanity works with international organizations, including the World Economic Forum Council of 100, The Lebanese Center for Policy Studies, Soliya‚ÄîThe Connect Program, and The Institute for Interfaith Dialogue in Yogyakarta, Indonesia. PiH news This program is supported by the Norwegian Foreign Ministry, The UK's Foreign and Commonwealth Office, The National Endowment for Democracy, His Royal Highness Prince Al-Waleed bin Talal, Kingdom Holdings, the United States Institute of Peace, Rockefeller Brothers Fund, The Compton Foundation and individual donors. Children and youth programs Search's children and youth programs work directly with children in 26 programs in 14 countries aiming to transform children's roles in conflict into alternatives to violence. The United Nations recognizes that over 2 million children have been killed during war, 6 million children have been permanently disabled and over 250,000 child soldiers are still serving as soldiers, despite plans to release child soldiers in countries such as Burundi, the Central African Republic, C√¥te d'Ivoire, and the Democratic Republic of the Congo. The programs of Search Youth and Children include radio programming in all countries, news and journalism programs, mentoring programs between young girls and older women, Youth Parliaments, training youth as leaders in nonviolent projects, offering bilingual kindergartens to foster communication, training children and youth in nonviolent conflict resolution, and engaging youth in governmental creation. The Talking Drum Studios (radio) in Sierra Leone and Liberia provide children and youth with platforms for expression, through programs such as Sisi Lorpu and Golden Kids News.

The population (including Pilton and Stoke Doyle) of the civil parish at the 2011 Census was 244. It is on the River Nene, approximately 4 miles from Thrapston and 10 miles from Corby. The Nene Way long-distance footpath passes through the village. History There is evidence of prehistoric occupation by way of earthworks. The original doomsday village was located north east of the church, the area surrounding the church is now a Site of Special Scientific Interest. There is extensive evidence of Roman occupation and encampment within the village with finds of coins and pottery recorded. The ancients sites are not protected. The manor and lands have changed ownership many times over the centuries, the position of the current village is near to its position in the Saxon period. Manor The manor of Wadenhoe was held by a half a knight's fee or through the Honour of Winchester, whilst other holdings were direct from the King. At the time of the Norman Conquest of 1066 Wadenhoe became part of Rockingham Forest. The village was named 'Wadenho' in the Doomsday book in 1086 and was within an area named the Hundred of Navisford, one of eight Hundreds held by the Abbey of Peterborough granted by Richard I consisting of Titchmarsh, Catworth, Clopton, Achurch, Thrapston Pilton and Stoke Doyle, the Tenant in Chief was Bishop Geoffrey of Coutances and the Lord at that time Aubrey De Vere, the population was recorded as 31 households. The manor remained property and in full possession of the de Vere family until 1229. By 1236 the manor was subinfeudated to John de Lacy, 2nd Earl of Lincoln. He was succeeded in 1241 by his son Edmund, who obtained livery of his father's lands by 1249 and in 1254 granted the manor to Henry de Lacy, 3rd Earl of Lincoln, for life. On Roger's death in 1264, it reverted to the Lacy's and was held in dower by Edmund's widow Alice. The son and heir of Alice Lacy was Henry, 3rd Earl of Lincoln after his death in 1311, by 1312, the manor passed to his daughter and heir Alice de Lacy, 3rd Countess of Lincoln, then wife of Thomas, 2nd Earl of Lancaster. After Lancaster's execution in 1321, Alice Lacy married Sir Ebulo Lestrange and they obtained a grant of the manors for life from Edward II, with remainder to Hugh le Despencer, the younger. A 1249 grant of free warren obtained by Edmund de Lacy was claimed in 1330 by Baron Strange and Alice Lacy, they obtained a grant from Edward III of the manor for themselves and their heirs. On the death of both Ebulo and Alice, the manor should have passed to Ebulo's nephew Roger Lestrange of Knokyn, on whom it had been settled in 1336, but in 1337 he had granted the reversion to Nicholas de Cantilupe for life, he died in 1356. After 1356 the manor again passed the heir of the Lestrange estates. His descendants held it till the death of John Lestrange in 1477 the manor next passed to a daughter and heiress Joan, the wife of George Stanley, the manor was then sold. By 1532 the manor was property of William Blount, 4th Baron Mountjoy. His son and successor Charles Blount, 5th Baron Mountjoy, sold it to Henry VIII in 1543, and in 1550 Edward IV granted it to Princess Elizabeth, who later became Queen Elizabeth I. In 1551, however, an exchange was made with Sir Walter Mildmay and in 1617 the manor passed by exchange to the Earls of Westmoreland. By 1668, Charles, Earl of Westmoreland, sold it to John Stanyan, who sold it sixteen years later to Brooke Bridges on his death in 1702 the manor then passed to his great-nephew John Bridges, the historian, who in turn sold the manor in 1714 to Sir Edward Ward, Chief Baron of the Exchequer. The descendant Edward Hunt of Oundle, a merchant, had a son Thomas, who inherited to the manor of Wadenhoe, he left no surviving issue. The manor passed to his brother Rowland, who married Frances Welch, and from him to his son Thomas Welch Hunt. Thomas Welch Hunt left Wadenhoe to his aunt, Mary Hunt (d. unm. 1835), with remainder to his cousin, Mary Caroline Hunt (d. unm. 1847), daughter of Rev. Edward Hunt, younger son of Thomas Hunt of Boreatton, and with ultimate remainder to Rev. George Hunt (d. 1853), son of Rowland, son of the last-named Thomas. George Hunt was succeeded by his son the Right Hon. George Ward Hunt, Chancellor of the Exchequer and First Lord of the Admiralty. His son George Eden Hunt succeeded him in 1877 and died in 1892 leaving a son George Ward Hunt, captain in the Northamptonshire regiment, who was killed in action in 1915. His son George Edgar Ward Hunt, born 1911 became owner. A water-mill and free fishery are mentioned in 1356 and two mills are referred to in 1656 and again in 1818.

Retrieved 25 November 2009 Religion Church of St. Michael and All Angels Wadenhoe Church from the car park - geograph.org.uk - 1218708 The church of St. Michael and All Angels is within the Oundle Deanery, in the Peterborough diocese. The church consists of chancel 27 ft. by 16 ft. with a modern vestry on the south side, clearstoried nave 36 ft. 6 in. by 19 ft., north and south aisles each 12 ft. 6 in. wide, north porch, and west tower with saddleback roof 15 ft. by 14 ft. 6 in., all these measurements being internal. The tower is all that is left of a late 12th-century church (c. 1195‚Äì1200), the chancel and nave of which were rebuilt some time in the next century. The nave arcades are of this period, that on the north being the earlier, but the aisles appear to have been rebuilt and widened in the 14th century. In 1901 there was an extensive restoration of the fabric when the floors of the nave and aisles were lowered to their original level and the tower was underpinned to a solid foundation. The roofs are all modern, those of the nave and aisles being leaded and the chancel roof tiled. The parapets throughout are plain. The ground falls rapidly from west to east and the chancel stands high above the level of the churchyard: on the north side there are two steps down to the porch and five from the porch to the floor of the church. The chancel has an east window of two lights with a circle in the head, originally c. 1250, and there are single lancets in the north and south walls. The vestry is of brick and is five steps below the chancel level. The 13th-century arch to the nave is of two chamfered orders, the inner one resting on moulded corbels supported by grotesque heads. The windows of the north aisle are all of 14th century date, that at the east end being of three trefoiled lights with modern reticulated tracery, the others of two lights with quatrefoil in the head. On each side of the east window is a moulded corbel for a statue. In the south aisle the east window is of three tall trefoiled lights, with slight piercings, c. 1280, and near it, in the usual position, is a pointed piscina with fluted bowl and inner trefoil arch on plain corbels. The other windows are later and of two cinquefoiled lights. Both doorways have continuous moulded head and jambs, and there is a pseudo- Gothic plaster ribbed ceiling to the porch. At the west end of the south aisle is a stone wallbench. The clearstory windows are square-headed and of two trefoiled lights. There are 17th-century tombs and headstones in the churchyard, and on one of the buttresses on the south side are three scratch dials. The registers before 1812 are as follows: (i) all entries 1559‚Äì1648, and births 1654‚Äì81; (ii) baptisms 1695‚Äì1812, marriages 1695‚Äì1754, burials 1683‚Äì1812; (iii) marriages 1754‚Äì1812. The second volume contains entries of penances between 1719 and 1763. The Church was used as the backdrop for the opening scenes of the 1999 version of A Christmas Carol starring Patrick Stewart. Wadenhoe Church Interior The church contains a 13th-century font being a circular bowl moulded round the lower edge and ornamented at the top with lunettes of foliage, below each joint of which are rosettes, dogtooth and masks in relief set vertically on the face of the cylinder. The font has been reset on an octagonal stone step. The early 18th century oak pulpit was re-arranged at the restoration. The seating is modern, but in the aisles are some carved and traceried bench ends, perhaps of 16th century date. There is a brass plate in the floor of the nave to John Andrewe (d. 1629), and in the chancel a mural monument to Brooke Bridges (d. 1702). There are six bells in the tower, the first cast by Tobie Norris, of Stamford, in 1603; the second a medi√¶val bell inscribed 'Ave Maria gratia plena Dominus tecum'; the tenor dated 1607. The tenor alone is rung, the others being cracked. The plate consists of a silver cup and cover paten of 1755, a flagon of 1776, and a silver dish with the mark of Jacques Cottin, of Paris, c. 1726, inscribed 'To the Pious Memory of ye Revd. Mr. Nat. Bridges who was 33 years Rectr. of this Church 1747.'

It is a tributary of East Fork Hood River and also contributes water for The Dalles and Hood River water systems. It is approximately 8 miles (14 km) long and drains the most southeastern portion of the Hood River watershed. It arises at High Prairie Spring at 6200 ft (1890 m) elevation at the foot of Lookout Mountain () and flows northward. It joins with Dog River Springs at 5080 ft (1545 m) and continues surprisingly straight northward considering the mountainous terrain. It meets The Dalles city waterworks gauging station and its diversionary aqueduct intake at 4260 ft (1300 m) then turns NW to Cooks Meadow then turns directly westward. There are several half mile long zigzags north and west before turning straight northward again through steep mountainous forest. It meets the East Fork Hood River at Highway 35 where it also meets Puppy Creek at elevation 2120 (), which is less than a mile upstream from Cat Creek. The Dog River appears unsuitable for whitewater sports due to its low volume and restricted access for drinking water purposes. The river's name comes from an early name for the Hood River, which was called the Dog River after a party of starving travelers resorting to eating dog meat.

Their typical size is long. Their color may vary from greyish green to brownish or almost black, with dark spots on the back. The belly is sometimes vividly coloured in yellow or orange, with black spots, very similar to dice, hence the name.  Biology  Living mainly near rivers, streams and lakes, it frequently feeds on fish. Sometimes, it feeds also on amphibians such as frogs, toads, and tadpoles. Classified as nonvenomous, N. tessellata produces a potent antihemorrhagin in its serum and has been said to produce a neurotoxin through a gland in its mouth. As a defence, it spreads a very bad-smelling secretion from its cloaca. Another defence mechanism is thanatosis, playing dead. During the mating season (March‚ÄìMay), they congregate in large groups. Egg-laying is usually in July, and one clutch consists of 10‚Äì30 eggs. The young snakes hatch in early September.

As a follow up to DX-Ball by Michael P. Welch, the sequel is foremost remarked by the introduction of its 16-bit high-colour engine, presenting textured bricks and background graphics in vivid colours. The game also features two new Power-Ups, an easy to play \\"Kid-Mode\\", and a hotseat multiplayer mode, alongside an original soundtrack by SideWinder. DX-Ball 2 also introduces the feature of board-set selection, allowing the player to select between different sets of boards to play. The free demo thereby comes packed with a total of 24 boards divided into 6 board-sets of 4 boards search. Additional board packs can then be installed for more boards, whereas Board Pack 1 will expand the demo board-sets to 25 boards each, for a total of 150 boards. While a total of five board packs were released for the game, DX-Ball 2 was eventually succeeded by Rival Ball in 2001. A 20th Anniversary edition was announced on August 23rd, 2018 and was released on November 21st, 2018, which features a new high resolution boardset, new power ups, online leaderboard and boardset editor. Gameplay As a common Breakout-style game, the object is to clear the screen of all bricks, in order to advance to the next board. The player controls a paddle at the bottom of the screen by using the mouse, keeping one or more balls in play by bouncing them into a field of bricks to clear them. Some bricks will take multiple hits before they clear, while other bricks will appear to be unbreakable, invisible or combustible. As bricks are being cleared, random Power-Ups will occasionally released upon impact (see Power-Ups). The player may choose to catch these with the paddle, or avoid them, depending on the specific Power-Up and its effect. For instance, some Power-Ups may speed up game progress by enhancing the paddle with guns or splitting the ball into multiple balls, while other Power-Ups may increase the difficulty by speeding up the ball or shrinking the paddle. If the player misses the last or only ball in play, a paddle will be lost. The game will end once all spare paddles have been lost, or after the selected board-set has been completed. Unlike other Breakout clones, the ball on DX-Ball 2 can travel freely at any angle and trajectory instead of being fixed at certain angles. The ball's trajectory will also differ depending on how the player controls it with the paddle. The speed of the ball gradually increases over time as the game continues, and will produce sparks and unique sound on the paddle when it has reached its maximum speed. Sharper angles can be achieved by bouncing the ball up with the paddle's edges while moving, which results in a much precision trajectory. The difficulty level of the game can be switched between Normal and Kid-Mode. This is done by pressing F4 on the title screen, which allows the player to toggle between the two modes. Kid-Mode makes the game easier to play by excluding certain Power-Ups; reducing the ball speed (fixed in half of the highest speed); and letting the player start each board with 1 set of extended paddle and a permanent big ball. The excluded Power-Ups include Kill Paddle, Super Shrink and Shrink Ball. Hence the ball will always remain big, while the paddle may still be shrunk down by the regular Shrink Paddle power-up. Notably, Kid-Mode has its own high score table, which is separate from the high score table in Normal difficulty. Rehab Mode is a more recent addition to the game, being introduced with version 1.3.2. While this feature is considered an advanced option, it is only accessible from the game's advanced configurations file. This file is located in DX-Ball 2's main directory as , and can safely be opened and edited in Notepad or any text editor. When Rehab Mode is enabled, the player will have infinite playing chances, and also be able to change the speed of the ball by pressing the number keys on the keyboard, going from 1 (slowest) to 0 (the highest speed in Kid-Mode). Consequently, the Fast Ball, Slow Ball and Eight Ball Power-ups will not affect the ball speed in Rehab Mode. The player will not be able to submit a high score when Rehab Mode is enabled. The hotseat multiplayer mode can be activated from the game's title screen by pressing F3, allowing up to four players. Unlike 1 player mode, multiplayer mode do not allowed cheat codes to prevent spamming free power-ups, instead it replaced any key to release ball and shoot brick shots. After selecting which board-set to play, Player 1 will occupy the game until a paddle has been lost or the board-set has been completed. Whichever comes first, Player 2 takes turn subsequently, and so on, until the cycle starts over. If one player loses all their paddles, the game is left to the remaining players. At the end of the game, only the players who made it through the board-set will be allowed to submit their score on the high score screen. Categorised by colour, the game features twenty Power-Ups in groups of ten blue, five red, and five grey. Basically, the blue Power-Ups are considered good, while red increase the difficulty, and grey may vary depending on the situation. Aside from the main objective is clear one's way through the selected board-set, the player is also rewarded points during gameplay, that may award a position on the leaderboard for the specific board-set. By default, 10 points are earned for each brick cleared. However, this number can increase from a variety of factors, including the ball speed, and the size of both the ball and the paddle. Ultimately, if the player is able to control a small ball in at the highest speed, with the smallest paddle size, each brick cleared will earn a total of 40 points. However, if the FireBall is obtained, each brick cleared will only earn 8 points, regardless of any other conditions. This is also true for explosive bricks in general, including adjacent pieces that are destroyed and for all bricks shot with Shooting Paddle. Multi-hit bricks will only earn 2 points per hit, before the final hit, with exception of invisible bricks, which only reward points as they are cleared. Points are also earned by collecting any of the available power-ups, which is worth 50 points each. The player is unable to save their high score if Rehab Mode or Cheat Code (1 player only) is activated. Development Programmed by Seumas McNally, DX- Ball 2 was first released on December 16, 1998. The game was an updated version of the classic DX-Ball by Michael P. Welch, on which Seumas had contributed with graphic and level design. It retained the basic gameplay of the original game, while also recycling the sound effects, and the graphics for the paddle and Power-Ups. However, with the advantage of running in high colour mode, DX-Ball 2 presented a significant upgrade from its predecessor in the visual aspect, delivering colorful board designs with textured bricks and background graphics; enhanced explosion animation with sparks; ray traced balls; and screens of fiery plasma effects. Also unique to DX-Ball 2 was the ability to select between multiple board-sets to play, enhancing the gameplay experience with varying themes and graphical styles. Among other new features, the game also introduced two new Power-Ups: Mega Ball and Eight Ball; an easy- to-play Kid-Mode; and a euro-techno soundtrack by SideWinder, accompanying the addition of an integrated module player. The graphics of the game has been described as being equal to that of Nintendo 64 and PlayStation. Version 1.2 Five months after the game's initial release, the first update for DX- Ball 2 was released on May 12, 1999, upgrading it to version 1.2. The new version introduced several new features, including in-game music; hotseat multiplayer mode; improved fire effects; sparks upon impact with invisible bricks; updated graphics for the High Scores screen; textured fireball; half- bright background mode; easier-to-avoid Kill Paddle Power-Ups; shorter wait before unbreakable bricks are neutralised when the ball is stuck; listing of which board was reached on high score tables; a configuration file for advanced options; and overall increased performance. Prior to the release of version 1.2, there were also plans of releasing a board editor for the game, allowing players to create and play their own board-sets. An unofficial board editor had already been in the works since the initial release of DX-Ball 2, and with permission from Longbow Digital Arts, it was eventually made available during the second half of 1999. However, with this in mind, DX-Ball 2 version 1.2 had also been programmed to restrict custom board-sets, allowing only the first four boards to be played. While this was done to secure the game's commercial value, the company had simultaneously been working on an update to version 1.3, that was planned to lift the custom board-set restriction for owners of Board Pack 1. However, with the passing of Seumas McNally on March 21, 2000, the future for DX-Ball 2 took a slightly different turn. Version 1.25 With no public announcement being made, DX-Ball 2 version 1.25 was quietly released in July 2000. As Longbow Digital Arts was at loss by the passing of its founder, president and lead programmer, the company decided to discontinue support for the board editor and prioritise the sales of board packs. DX-Ball 2 version 1.25 would thus dismiss custom board-sets by changing the game's board-set file format, while Longbow Digital Arts removed any downloads of the level or ImageSet editor by RastaFarI and unofficial levels or imagesets from the game's forums. Version 1.25 also fixed a bug with latency on newer versions of Windows, and introduced minor cosmetic changes, removing the most prominent references to Michael P. Welch, and adding memorial notes in commemoration of Seumas. Version 1.3.0.2 Released sometime between 1.25 and 1.32 this version had a few features from the next version but lacked many others including its flagship Vista compatibility. The main menu states it is version 1.3 (as do all of the succeeding versions) and it has the endgame splash screen, but the install program is the same as the one for 1.25 (not being a NSIS installer and even stating it's installing 1.25) with the exception that it installs 1.3.0.2 and not 1.25. Version 1.32 DX-Ball 2 version 1.32 was released in May 2007 and had an announcement alongside other LDA games which also got Vista-compatibility updates. The \\"flagship\\" feature that was mostly talked about in the announcement was its compatibility with Windows Vista, done by fixing some of the problems that occurred on the OS and adding itself to the \\"Games\\" system folders, one of Vista's new features. Alongside that, it also installed MCEWrapper.exe for support on Windows XP Media Center Edition, integrated the previously-separate Music Pack, replaced the white ball icon of the game with a Boing Ball, introduced Rehab Mode and changed the installer from Clickteam Install Creator to NSIS. Version 1.33 Not too long after the release of DX-Ball 2 version 1.32 it was discovered that the update caused compatibility issues with Win9x operating systems such as Windows 98 or Windows ME, for which DX-Ball 2 was originally programmed for. Longbow Digital Arts released the 1.33 patch in December 2007 which alongside the game installs ShFolder.exe and if the installer is run on Windows 9x automatically runs it, installing ShFolder.dll and removing the .exe file which fixed the problems. If the game isn't installed on a Windows 9x system, but rather on a Windows NT OS such as Windows XP or Windows 7, ShFolder.exe will be installed but not run. The user can open the file, installing ShFolder.dll, but that won't have any impact on the game or the fact will it work or not. Version 1.34 All of Longbow's casual games, including DX-Ball 2 received new versions on January 18th, 2017. As with the other updates, this version added better fullscreen support, increased stability and smoothness for Windows 8 and Windows 10. 20th Anniversary Edition A 20th Anniversary Edition of the game was announced on August 23rd, 2018 with the release set for Fall of 2018 on Steam. New features include a new boardset, a level editor and online leaderboards. Playmachine.net Following the opening of a website called Playmachine.net, a special version of DX-Ball 2 was made exclusively for the service, announced on August 27, 1999. Playmachine.net offered a classic video arcade experience online, utilising ActiveX to download and run games via Internet Explorer or Netscape. Players would then have the option to exchange purchased tokens in order to play, or try the game for free in a 60 seconds trial. The arcade version of DX-Ball 2 thereby featured an exclusive board-set of 100 boards, and the service would automatically upload and host high scores online, with listings for top 30 of the week and top 30 of all time. Board Packs First board from the board-set \\"Stingers, Legs and Backs\\", illustrating a coiled serpent in a colourful design by Wendy McNally\\".When DX- Ball 2 was initially released, it came as a free demo with 24 boards divided into six board-sets of 4 boards each. Its complementary was then known as the DX-Ball 2 Board Pack, or Board Pack 1, which expands the demo board-sets into their entirety of 25 boards each, for a total of 150 boards. More boards were eventually also made available, as the additions of Board Pack 2 and Classic Pack were released on June 13, 1999. Board Pack 2 featured 150 new boards by lead board designer Wendy McNally, presented in four board-sets of 25 boards, and one board-set of 50 boards. As in line with the style presented in Board Pack 1, Wendy's designs feature unique themes for each board-set, presenting artistic illustrations of various ideas and concepts. Furthermore, the board pack also featured new backgrounds to go with the new board-sets. The Classic Pack featured another 150 boards, designed by Michael and Sarah Welch, including the 50 original boards from DX-Ball, and two new board-sets of 50 boards each. As a homage to the original game, the graphics for the Classic Pack were designed to retain the classic style, sporting a softer look to the bricks and a faintly textured black background. Following the passing of Seumas, Board Pack 3 was released on May 19, 2000. Conforming to the style of the previous board pack, Board Pack 3 contained 150 new boards by Wendy McNally, spanning four board-sets of 25 boards, and one board-set of 50 boards. The game's final board pack, Memorial Pack was presented on July 19, 2000. In commemoration of Seumas, the board pack contained a dedicated memorial set of 100 boards (formerly exclusive to Playmachine.net); two board- sets of 25 boards; and a bonus alphabet board-set of 26 boards, adding to a total of 176 boards. As a special feature exclusive to the board pack, three of the board-sets featured a special set of bricks, that combines the three distinct brick styles seen in the game, while also introducing a couple of new ones. The board pack also featured new backgrounds for one of the board-sets. Although Board Pack 1 is considered the full version of DX-Ball 2, the board packs can be installed and played in any desired order, independent of each other. For instance, Board Pack 3 can safely be installed without any previous installation of Board Pack 1, in which case the initial demo board-sets will remain intact. Music The music in DX-Ball 2 was written by Eric Gieseke, also known as SideWinder. The complete soundtrack contains 15 songs in a melodic euro-techno style, with various branches and influences ranging from hardcore, techno, breakbeat, jazz, house, and rock. Initially, the game came bundled with only 4 tracks, encompassing three title screen songs and a high score theme. However, with the release of DX-Ball 2 version 1.2, support was added for in-game music. While this allowed for the three title screen songs to be played back in-game, a separate Music Pack was simultaneously made available for download, adding 11 new songs to the game. Notably, though, the Music Pack was discontinued as of version 1.3.2, as the 11 in-game songs are now included with the basic installation. The in-game songs are played in a random order per game, and the player can easily skip between tracks or turn the music off by pressing F5: the first press unloading the music, and the next press loading a new song. DX-Ball 2 also permits the in-game music to be customised by adding or removing files from the subdirectory. However, the game will only support tracker modules of the , and formats. The modules may use up to 24 channels, but the game will initially only allow up to 8 channels. In order to increase this value, it must be changed from the game's advanced configurations file (see Kid-Mode and Rehab Mode). Incidentally, as a related option under the advanced configurations, the playback rate of all sound is set to 22 kHz by default, and may be increased to 44.1 kHz for improved sound quality. Boxed version For a limited time, starting November 2000, DX-Ball 2 was made available as a boxed CD version in the U.S., being published by Tri Synergy and retailed through Babbage's, Software ETC and Game Stop. The choice of publishing a boxed version of the game was foremost in response to a public request for a gift option, while it also served as an experiment for Longbow Digital Arts to evaluate its ability to self-publish into regular retail channels. The boxed CD featured the main game, Board Pack 1, the Music Pack, and the alphabet board-set from Memorial Pack as an added bonus, summing up to a total of 176 boards. Reception DX- Ball 2 was met with an overall positive reception from both editors and players. Games Domain reviewer Zack Schiel praised it for addictive gameplay, and noted it as the \\"best-looking Breakout game ever made\\". However, he also noted that the \\"overall graphics [were] not up to today's retail standards\\". Among other reviews, Shareware Viking gave the game \\"Warrior Status\\" with a score of 84/100, while ZDNet rated it 5/5 stars. Among consumer reviews, the game scored high at Epinions.com, with 4.5/5 stars out of twelve reviews, based on seven reviews of 5 stars and five reviews of 4 stars. Public favour was also remarked at Software Informer, where editor Daniel √Ångel Romero gave it 3/5 stars, while the game maintains a user rating of almost 4.5/5 stars, based on 28 votes as of June 2012. Successor As a spiritual sequel to DX- Ball 2, Longbow Games released Rival Ball in 2001. While the new title recycled the engine of DX-Ball 2, it also introduced many new features, including a buttoned layout with cursor-based navigation; two new Power-Ups (replacing two older ones); new graphics for the Power-Ups; new square shaped bricks; 4 difficulty modes; new sound effects and music; and 1-on-1 split screen network play. In addition, it also featured the ability to set timers, randomise board order and repeat board sets, also including support for DX- Ball 2 boards.

The 23 July 1962 International Agreement on the Neutrality of Laos would cause it to be shut down in September 1962. It would be succeeded by the Requirements Office. Background With the end of World War II, Laos was no longer under the French Union but became entirely sovereign and governed by the Royal Lao Government. The agreements reached at the Geneva Conference (1954) prohibited Laos from having foreign military bases and participating in any foreign military alliance, but allowed a small French military training mission which supported the Royal Lao Army. In the wake of the Geneva Conference, France announced it would cease funding the Lao government on 1 January 1955. The French training mission began to wind down. As part of its goal of containment, the U.S. sought to ensure that the Royal Lao Army was capable of meeting the threat posed by the Pathet Lao, who were backed by communist North Vietnam. In turn, on 3 December 1955, the RLG requested that the United States step into the void. Ten days later, the Programs Evaluation Office was established. Staffed by 12 retired American military or reserve personnel, the PEO skirted the conditions of the Geneva agreement by its civilian staffing.Conboy, Morrison, p. 17. Retired Brigadier General Rothwell H. Brown, who reported to the Commander in Chief Pacific Command, headed the office. The PEO kept a low profile as it began working to improve an army of 23,000 undereducated and poorly trained peasants.Anthony, Sexton, p. 14. By 1957, PEO was slated for a staff of 60, although turnover kept onboard staff to about 30 men. Progress in upgrading the RLA was at a standstill; the French military mission had dwindled with their involvement in their Algerian War. Such French trainers as were assigned were reluctant to cooperate with Americans, and regarded the Lao as inferior recruits for soldiering. Operational history Beginning A coalition government emerged in Vientiane in 1957, which included royalists as well as the Pathet Lao. When the United States wanted to influence the 1958 Lao elections, it staged Operation Booster Shot. This civic action program was supported by a PEO supervised air lift by the Central Intelligence Agency's proprietary civilian airline, CAT, as well as by the U.S. Air Force.Anthony, Sexton, pp. 12, 15, 16. The Pathet Lao formed a coalition with a minor party when they garnered 14 of 21 seats in the National Assembly.Conboy, Morrison, p. 18. The PEO's election advice to the Royal Lao Government politicians--to run a single slate of candidates to avoid splitting the votes--went unheeded. Indeed, in one instance, the supporters of one defeated RLG candidate told him he had never asked them to vote for him.Ahern, p. 6. By May 1958, the U.S. Department of Defense was proposing a training mission by civilian technicians to the Royal Lao Army to retrain four of its branches--logistics, communications, ordnance, and combat engineers. Later that year, a small group of military advisers arrived to teach construction of airfields, bridges, and highways. In October 1958, 39 training slots for Lao officers and non-commissioned officers were reserved for 1959 courses at Fort Benning, Georgia. In conjunction with the Central Intelligence Agency, PEO trained some regular Lao soldiers into Scout Ranger Teams; these would later evolve into two paratroop battalions. However, the most important event was the arrival of former General John A. Heintges as head of PEO in September 1958.Conboy, Morrison, p. 20.Conboy, Morrison, p. 24. Up-grade and end Heintges assessed the PEO program with an eye to improvement. As he noted in his report, both the American and Lao ends of the PEO program had major problems. To date, the PEO had served as a simple conduit for military materials supplied to the Royal Lao Army. It made no followup beyond delivery. The RLA, on the other hand, reflected some severe faults of the French army. Most deleterious was the stratification between the officers, NCOs, and enlisted ranks. The officer corps was arrogant and distant in its relationship with NCOs and enlisted men; it seldom led in the field. Responsibility for leadership thus devolved on under-educated and under- trained sergeants. Military equipment was scarce and outdated. Heintges moved to address the problems he saw. He brought in a new larger PEO staff of 65 in December; most were veterans of the Third Infantry Division during World War II, as was Heintges. He also advocated for military training teams of Green Berets. The 107 Green Berets of Project Hotfoot arrived on 24 July 1959. Led by Arthur D. \\"Bull\\" Simons, the dozen eight-man teams were shared out three per training base at Luang Prabang, Pakse, Savannakhet, and Vientiane. Even as the Operation Hotfoot teams began weapons training and the French military mission taught tactics, the RLA was losing a series of skirmishes in Xam Neua near the Vietnamese border. The training was held in abeyance while the Green Berets surveyed the situation. They deemed the higher command of the RLA inexperienced, especially in command of any unit above company level, or in staff positions. Having surveyed the situation, the Green Berets began training in September 1959. That same month, under the codename Project Erawan, the Royal Thai Army began training 1,400 Lao recruits in guerrilla and counter-guerrilla warfare.Conboy, Morrison, pp. 20 - 25. The structure of the Royal Lao Army was a conventional one, with the Royal Lao Air Force and the River Flotilla were both subordinate to it. In conjunction with the regular units, the RLA also had a home guard organization of 100-man companies, the Auto Defense Corps. It was authorized a strength of 16,000 militiamen. PEO reached out to other countries, in an attempt to arrange additional training cadre. Overtures to Malaysia and South Vietnam were unsuccessful. However, in September 1959, the Royal Thai Government agreed to retrain paratroopers at Camp Erawan in Lopburi. PEO also was successful in hiring technicians in the Philippines. Filipino technicians from Eastern Construction Company (abbreviated as ECCOIL) arrived under contract to instruct the nascent Royal Lao Air Force, as well as the sailors of the Mekong River Flotilla. Displaced French trainers were to devolve to the RLA's regional training centers.Conboy, Morrison, p. 24. In November, PEO began contact with the Committee for the Defence of the National Interests, a political faction of younger Lao military officers.Ahern, p. 9. On 25 December 1959, General Phoumi Nosavan seized Vientiane. By the New Year, he had dissolved the National Assembly and firmly installed himself as head of the Lao government. By this time, the PEO had increased to an onboard strength of 175, a mixed crew of civilians and temporarily assigned U.S. military. A second Hotfoot contingent rotated in for duty. However, now that the PEO began to make progress on the military task of upgrading the RLA, internal political disagreements began to hamper them, as elections were slated for 24 April 1960. Once again, the PEO carried out a civic action program meant to influence voters to support anticommunist candidates for office. This was successful to the extent that the Pathet Lao lost an election widely perceived as fraudulent. On 23 May, they fled into the wilderness of Houaphanh Province to once again foment an insurrection.Conboy, Morrison, pp. 24-26. Then on August 9, 1960, Phoumi‚Äôs government was removed in a lightning coup d'√©tat by a group termed the Neutralists led by Captain Kong Le, a paratroop officer of the Royal Lao Army. PEO headquarters in Vientiane became inactive following Kong Le's takeover of the city, but the PEO branch office in Savannakh√©t continued to supply and pay General Phoumi Nosavan's troops. Eventually, on 14 December 1960, Phoumi re-captured Vientiane.Conboy, Morrison, pp. 24-26, 40-42. The Central Intelligence Agency infiltrated Laos with Thai commandos at that time. After the momentous meeting between CIA agent James William Lair and Vang Pao, the PEO was tasked with funding of the first 2,000 irregulars under Operation Momentum.Conboy, Morrison, p. 61. The justification for not tasking PEO for the Momentum mission was PEO's rigid adherence to long-term planning.Ahern, p. 28. In April 1961, the PEO was upgraded to a Military Assistance Advisory Group (MAAG), and its members were allowed to wear uniforms within Laos. On 29 April 1961, Project Erawan morphed into Project Ekarad; despite the code name change, Lao troops still trained in Lopburi, Thailand.Conboy, Morrison, p. 67. By June 1962, the MAAG had grown to a staff of 866, with a further 465 Filipinos from ECCOIL also employed. The MAAG was withdrawn to Thailand by October 1962 under the terms of the Geneva Agreement, becoming Deputy Chief, Joint United States Military Assistance Advisory Group Thailand.Anthony, Sexton, pp. 72-73. The Programs Evaluation Office would eventually be replaced by the Requirements Office of the U.S. Embassy.Castle, pp. 52-53. During its existence, the Programs Evaluation Office controlled logistics to as many as 30,000 Royalist regular soldiers. It was denied control of the Project Momentum effort to train Hmong as irregular military. Despite PEO, \\"...the Laotian army continued to distinguish itself primarily by its lassitude and incompetence.\\" Essentially, the Hmong were becoming the Lao government's combatants, leading to unsuccessful PEO attempts to gain control over the guerrillas.Ahern, pp. 52, 55-57.

East Peckham bridge over the River Medway. The A228 road is an important transport artery in Kent, England. It begins at the Isle of Grain and runs in a south-westerly direction to connect eventually with the A21 trunk road at Pembury. It serves existing communities and new and proposed housing developments and commercial enterprises. The most influential force on the recent upgrading of the road has been the development of Kings Hill near West Malling. Route The A228 commences on a railway level crossing at Lower Stoke on the Isle of Grain, where it continues as the B2001. It begins as Grain Road, becoming Malmaynes Hall Road after it passes through Stoke running west. Passing High Halstow and turning south, it follows Sharnal Street which then becomes the Ratcliffe Highway, which bypasses Hoo St Werburgh and skirts the Deangate Ridge Golf Club. After reaching Chattenden it turns into Four Elms Hill before switching onto the new Wainscott Eastern Bypass. Entering Frindsbury, where the A289 Medway Towns northern bypass starts, it follows Frindsbury Hill and then Frindsbury Road before reaching Strood. The southern part of this Hoo Peninsula section was widened in 2005 as part of the Thames Gateway development programme. It is intended to dual the northern section to Grain at a later date (provisionally 2016). https://www.sabre- roads.org.uk/wiki/index.php?title=A228http://www.mapmyrun.com/gb/royal- tunbridge-wells-eng/a228-miadstone-road-amp-back-route-839511 In Strood the southbound and northbound routes split due to Strood's one-way system. The southbound route goes along North Street and then Knight Road before joining the Cuxton Road whilst the northbound route follows Gun Lane from Cuxton Road to Frindsbury Road. In Strood it also crosses the A2. Continuing south, the road passes over the M2 and High Speed 1 on Sundridge Hill where those two routes reach land again after crossing their respective Medway bridges. Proceeding down Sundridge Hill, the road descends from the Downs and enters the Medway Gap at Cuxton, where it then becomes the Rochester Road and later Formby Road as it makes its way to Halling. At Halling, the A228 departs from the old route that took it through the village and proceeds along the Halling Bypass which then links up with the Snodland Bypass near Holborough. As the Snodland Bypass ends the road rejoins its historic route (albeit on very recent much enlarged roads) for a short stretch on Malling Road which becomes Castle Way as it approaches Leybourne. At this point, where the route crosses the M20, the route again diverts onto a new bypass, this time the Leybourne Bypass, opened November 2006,http://www.southeast- ra.gov.uk/documents/factsheet/38.pdf which then passes under the A20 (a road that it used to junction) and then joins the West Malling Bypass. Passing Manor Park Country Park to the west and the roundabout at the northern entrance to Kings Hill, the road becomes Ashton Way before meeting the Malling Road at the southern tip of West Malling and proceeding through Mereworth. South of Mereworth, the route is shared by that of the A26 for a short period before the routes diverge upon meeting Seven Mile Lane onto which the A228 turns south while the A26 proceeds southwest to Tonbridge. As it passes East Peckham and the hamlet of Hale Street, the road becomes Hale Street before crossing the River Medway and joining Bainbridges Road, passing Beltring and The Hop Farm Country Park. Here the road splits with the B2160 branching off south towards Paddock Wood and the A228 turning southwest along the Whetsted Road towards Whetsted, where it becomes the Maidstone Road for its final stretch before reaching Pembury. This last section is under consideration for another bypass for Colts Hill as this section of road is a relatively small single carriageway which is a notorious accident blackspot and a key link between Maidstone Hospital and the newly redeveloped Pembury Hospital. The classification A228 was not applied originally to the route south of Mereworth. Following improvements in the 1990s (including a bypass around East Peckham), the B2016 between Mereworth and Hale Street and the B2015 between Hale Street and Pembury were reclassified as A228. As it passes through Pembury, the Maidstone Road becomes the Pembury Road towards Tunbridge Wells, and the A228 shares the route of the A264 for its last few yards as it crosses the A21 before finally terminating on a roundabout at the end of the slip roads for the northern bound carriageway of the A21.

It is owned and managed by the National Trust. Earthworks Within the wider SSSI mentioned above, the earthworks of Figsbury Ring are sub-circular and enclose 6.4 hectares of grassland on a chalk ridge to the north east of Salisbury, in the parish of Firsdown, Wiltshire at NGR SU188338. It is yet to be fully investigated. Small portions of the site were excavated in 1924 by Ben and Maud Cunnington as it was their belief that the site was the remains of an Iron Age Hill fort. Superficially this description of an earthwork with exterior ditch would seem appropriate, however the presence of an enigmatic inner ditch has led many archaeologists to doubt this interpretation. This ditch is separated from the outer rampart by a berm of up to 30 metres in width and, to many, it seems likely that the site actually began as a late neolithic Henge. A small geophysical survey was carried out by Anthony Clark and John Gator in 1981 to determine whether or not an earth bank was ever associated with the inner ditch. The results of this survey were inconclusive. In 1982 the finds from the Cunningtons' excavations were then reappraised by Margaret Guido and Isobel Smith. Several artefacts, notably Grooved Ware and Beaker pottery, established that there had been occupation at the site much earlier than the period proposed by the Cunningtons. A further reappraisal of the artefacts was carried out in 2003/04 by Philip Dunn, a student at Bournemouth University. This confirmed Guido and Smith's findings and went on to identify a number of flint artefacts that were diagnostic of Neolithic occupation at the site. Following on from this study a large scale geophysical survey was conducted which covered 46% of the interior using a Fluxgate Gradiometer. The results of this survey were, again, inconclusive although no evidence was detected for the existence of an inner bank. Traces of possible structures were detected and it was proposed that the site may have particularly early origins. When Figsbury was considered within the context of the wider landscape and a range of other nearby monuments it appeared possible that the site may have begun as a Causewayed enclosure. This may then have been modified into a Henge monument in the later Neolithic or Early Bronze Age. There is certainly sufficient evidence to state with some degree of confidence that the site was occupied (albeit temporarily or intermittently) towards the middle of the third millennium BC. Further modification of the site appears to have taken place during the late Bronze Age or early Iron Age. In popular culture Figsbury Ring features prominently in E. M. Forster's 1907 novel, The Longest Journey, renamed the Cadbury Rings (the surrounding area is called Cadford). The narrator of the novel speculates as to whether the structure was British, Roman, Saxon, or Danish, and suggests it is a tomb concealing ancient dead soldiers and buried gold. In the novel, the area between the rings is planted with mangel-wurzels and there is a tree growing in the centre of the inner ring.

The centre faces Cornmarket Street, and has other entrances onto Queen Street and Shoe Lane. The fascia onto Cornmarket Street is that of the Woolworths store which had, in a decision later criticised, replaced the Georgian Clarendon Hotel; it was discovered during demolition that medieval construction had been present within the hotel. The shopping centre was expanded in 2012‚Äì14. Major tenants include TK Maxx, H&M; and Gap Outlet.  Location  The centre is in central Oxford, located to the west of Cornmarket Street and to the north of Queen Street. It is accessible from both of these streets and is L-shaped. There is also an entrance on Shoe Lane, off New Inn Hall Street. On the opposite side of Cornmarket is the more historic Golden Cross shopping arcade, located in the medieval courtyard of one of the coaching inns of Oxford, leading to the Covered Market. At the western end of Queen Street is the Westgate Shopping Centre, which was extensively redeveloped and extended in 2017.  History   Site history  An advert for the Clarendon Hotel from 1885 On this site was the Clarendon Hotel on Cornmarket Street, which grew from two former coaching inns, the King's Head and the Star. The hotel was a Georgian building, though beneath it was a vaulted wine cellar, which was the oldest in Oxford. The hotel closed in 1939; Woolworths purchased it in that year; it was used as an American Servicemen's Club, and then as offices, before being demolished in 1954. The demolition was later criticised. The area was the site of an early archaeological study in the 1950s. Architectural excavations, by W. A. Pantin and E. M. Jope, took place during and after the demolition. During these, it was discovered that the wine cellar dated back to the twelfth century, and the \\"complete framework of a sixteenth century timber-framed house\\" was behind the fascia, among other architectural discoveries. Pantin made the argument that, had this been known before demolition, the building could have been saved: The dig also revealed wares dating back to Saxon Britain, including eleventh-century pottery and a thirteenth-century aquamanile. The new Woolworths branch was designed by Sir William Holford, who sought to build a \\"Woolworths worthy of Oxford\\" after previous designs were rejected; Holford's design was also rejected by Oxford City Council, but the decision was overturned by Harold Macmillan, who was the Minister of Housing and Local Government at the time. The store was ceremonially opened on 18 October 1957 by the Mayor and Mayoress of Oxford; the former complimented the building. The branch was five times larger than its predecessor‚Äîindeed, when it opened, it was the biggest in Europe‚Äîand contained a deluxe cafeteria, offices, a roof garden and a multi-storey car park. While the store was open, the ceremony of \\"beating the bounds\\" of the parish of St Michael at the North Gate required the participants to pass through the store. The store closed in 1983.  Development as a shopping centre  The Clarendon Centre was built on the site in 1983‚Äì84, designed by Gordon Benoy and Partners, and built by property company Arrowcroft. The centre was financed by the pension fund of the National Westminster Bank. It initially had of retail space, with Littlewoods as a anchor store. There were more than 20 other shops, with shops signed up prior to construction including Dolcis, Etam, Chelsea Girl and Dixons. The centre was developed in two phases, with the first being the section connecting Cornmarket Street to Shoe Lane. The frontage of the old building on Cornmarket Street was retained, including the ornate \\"W\\" mark above a door. For the frontage onto Queen Street, the former Halfords shop was demolished; Halfords would later open within the centre, in a unit facing Shoe Lane. In January 1984, one person was killed and another seriously injured when a collapse occurred at the Queen Street demolition site for the centre. The centre was completed in 1984, being already fully let in October of that year, before it was completed. Writing in the \\"Oxford Diary\\" column in The Times in January 1984, A. N. Wilson labelled the newly built centre as \\"the most grotesquely horrible building I have ever seen\\"; in 1985, a reporter for The Observer described the centre's \\"phoney unfunctional pipes\\" and Bavarian marble floors. The Shoe Lane entrance prior to the 2012‚Äì14 extension In 1998, as the first step of a renovation of the centre, the Littlewoods store gave up of space adjacent to Cornmarket Street, to create space for a new store; this was later filled by Gap, after the landlord, Gartmore Group, wanting to make the centre more fashion-focused, rejected a larger bid from the electronics retailer Comet. Following the ¬£5m renovation (which also involved new lighting and doors, and redecoration), the centre (now described as having of retail space) was sold to an investment partnership in July 2000, for ¬£80m. H Samuel and French Connection were other new stores following the renovation. The centre's layout was slightly modified in 2001, when the former Etam and Halfords units were merged to accommodate a relocated and enlarged Dixons store. Then, on Saturday 7 August 2004, Littlewoods, the original anchor tenant, closed, notice of the closure having been given on the preceding Tuesday; contemporary reports suggested the closure was due to financial underperformance and another retailer's interest in the unit. The unit was subsequently taken by Zara, on a fifteen-year lease.  2010s changes  The Shoe Lane entrance after the 2012‚Äì14 extension In 2012, a plan was put forward to extend the centre floorspace by 10%: replacing the section near Shoe Lane with a three-storey extension, to house H&M.; Prior to construction of the extension, archaeologists carried out an excavation beneath the site to discover remains of occupation from the 17th century and earlier. The new H&M; store opened in 2014. Following the reopening of Westgate Oxford in October 2017, the branch of Zara within the centre moved to the Westgate, vacating its unit in the Clarendon. The site was taken over by TK Maxx, who opened their store on 30 May 2019, to queues of shoppers. The conversion of the store retained the stone in a stockroom marking the boundary of the parish of St Michael at the North Gate, which is supposedly the oldest of the boundary stones; the ceremony to mark the boundary still passes through the centre.  Stores  The centre has twenty-three stores and food outlets as of November 2019, including those opening soon. These include TK Maxx, H&M; and Gap Outlet. In total the centre has of space.

He was a Sterling Professor of History at Yale University, and founder and director of Yale's Gilder Lehrman Center for the Study of Slavery, Resistance, and Abolition. Davis authored or edited 17 books. His books emphasize religious and ideological links among material conditions, political interests, and new political values. Ideology, in his view, is not a deliberate distortion of reality or a fa√ßade for material interests; rather, it is the conceptual lens through which groups of people perceive the world around them. He was also a frequent contributor to The New York Review of Books.George M. Fredrickson, \\"The Uses of Antislavery\\", New York Review of Books, 16 October 1975 Davis received the 1967 Pulitzer Prize for General Nonfiction, and the National Humanities Medal, presented by President Barack Obama in 2014 for \\"reshaping our understanding of history.\\" He also received the 2015 National Book Critics Circle Award for General Nonfiction, the 2015 Anisfield-Wolf Book Award for lifetime achievement in contributions to public understanding of racism and appreciation of cultural diversity, and the 2015 Biennial Coif Book Award, a top honor from the Association of American Law Schools for the leading law-related book published in 2013 and 2014. After serving on the Cornell University faculty for 14 years, Davis taught at Yale from 1970 to 2001. He held one-year appointments as the Harold Vyvyan Harmsworth Visiting Professor of American History at Oxford University (1969-1970), at the Center for Advanced Study in the Behavioral Sciences at Stanford University, and as the first French-American Foundation Chair in American Civilization at the √âcole des Hautes √âtudes en Sciences Sociales in Paris. Early life Born in Denver in 1927, the son of Clyde Brion Davis, a journalist, novelist, and screenwriter, and Martha Elizabeth (Wirt) Davis, an artist and writer, Davis lived a peripatetic childhood in California, Colorado, New York, Colorado, and Washington State. He attended five high schools in four years but was popular among his peers.Richard Wightman Fox, \\"David Brion Davis: A Biographical Appreciation,\\" Moral Problems in American Life, ed. Karen Halttunen and Lewis Perry (Ithaca: Cornell University Press, 1998) During World War II, Davis was drafted into the United States Army in June 1945. On the troop ship to France in fall 1945, he witnessed the segregation and mistreatment of black soldiers.americanantiquarian.org He was assigned to the occupation of Germany in 1945‚Äì46. Since he knew some German, Davis was assigned to police civilians.David Brion Davis, ‚ÄúWorld War II and Memory,‚Äù Journal of American History, 77, Sept. 1990; Davis, \\"The Americanized Mannheim,\\" American Places: Encounters with History, ed. William Leuchtenburg (New York: Oxford University Press, 2002), pp. 79-92. Davis, whose parents \\"both rebelled against their Christian upbringing\\", did not identify with any religion until he married Toni Hahn Davis, who is Jewish. In 1987, Davis began his conversion to Judaism and had a Bar Mitzvah in 2008. Work In an essay in the 1968 American Historical Review entitled ‚ÄúSome Recent Directions in American Cultural History,‚Äù Davis urged historians to devote more attention to the cultural dimension to enhance understanding of social controversies, political decision-making, and literary expression. At a time when social history was ascendant, and cultural history was associated with the study of the arts, taste, and popular culture, and intellectual history with the study of abstract ideas largely divorced from specific social contexts, he called for a history that focused on beliefs, values, fears, aspirations, and emotions.‚ÄúSome Recent Directions in American Cultural History,‚Äù American Historical Review, Feb. 1968, 696-707. Antebellum American Culture (1979), his panoramic look at the cultural discourse surrounding ethnicity, gender, family, race, science, and wealth and power in the pre-Civil War United States, advanced the argument that American culture needs to be understood in terms of an ongoing ‚Äúmoral civil war.‚Äù Diverse groups of Americans debated ‚Äúwhat was happening, who was doing what to whom, what to fear and what to fight for.‚Äù He suggests that a relatively small group of Northeastern writers, preachers, and reformers in the 19th century United States ultimately succeeded in defining a set of middle-class norms regarding education, taste, sex roles, sensibility, and moral respectability.David Brion Davis, Antebellum American Culture: An Interpretive Anthology (State College: Pennsylvania State University Press), xxii Study of slavery University of Maryland historian Ira Berlin wrote that ‚Äúno scholar has played a larger role in expanding contemporary understanding of how slavery shaped the history of the United States, the Americas, and the world than David Brion Davis.‚ÄùQuoted in Goodman (2006) In a series of landmark books, articles, and lectures, Davis moved beyond a view of slavery that focuses on the institution in individual nations to look at the ‚Äúbig picture,‚Äù the multinational view of the origins, development, and abolition of New World slavery.Davis, David Brion. \\"The Central Fact of American History ,\\"American Heritage, Feb/March 2005. The most important of his books is his trilogy on the history of slavery in the Western world, which revealed the centrality of slavery in American and Atlantic history. The trilogy consisted of the Pulitzer Prize-winning The Problem of Slavery in Western Culture (1966), The Problem of Slavery in the Age of Revolution, 1770-1823 (1975), and The Problem of Slavery in the Age of Emancipation, (2014). He was committed to a conception of culture as process‚Äî-a process involving conflict, resistance, invention, accommodation, appropriation, and, above all, power, including the power of ideas. Culture, in his view, involves a cacophony of voices but also social relations that involve hierarchy, exploitation, and resistance.Davis, Antebellum American Culture, xxii-xxiii. Students Davis taught more than a generation of students, and advised many doctoral students, including such future prize- winning historians as Edward Ayers, Karen Halttunen, T. J. Jackson Lears, Steven Mintz, Lewis Perry, Joan Shelley Rubin, Jonathan Sarna, Barbara Savage, Amy Dru Stanley, Christine Stansell, John Stauffer, and Sean Wilentz. Davis's students have honored him with two festschrifts, Moral Problems in American Life (1998), edited by Karen Halttunen and Lewis Perry, and The Problem of Evil: Slavery, Freedom, and the Ambiguities of Reform (2007), edited by Steven Mintz and John Stauffer.

Midgett (1851‚Äì1926) was a United States Life-Saving Service surfman in North Carolina who single-handedly rescued ten men from the sinking barkentine Priscilla and was thereafter awarded the Gold Lifesaving Medal from the Secretary of the Treasury on October 18, 1899. Account of the rescue Rasmus Midgett sits on the wreckage of the Priscilla, which was situated about halfway between Salvo and Avon Erasmus S. Midgett is listed in some records as Edward S. Midgett.http://digginforkin.tripod.com/SHRds/d179.html#P6269 He was named for St.Elmo/ Erasmus, the patron saint of sailors. Rasmus went to grammar school at Southern Woods, now Waves, NC where he proved good at arithmetic and handwriting. Rasmus Midgett, one of a long line of North Carolina surfmen known as the Mighty Midgetts,Stowe, Belle and Helen Midgett. Truly One of the Mighty Midgetts in Sea Chest, p36-38, Cape Hatteras School Buxton, NC, 1997 was on patrol for the Gull Shoals Lifesaving Station on August 18, 1899. He left the station at Salvo for the southward patrol at 3:00 am on his horse, Gilbert.Couch, 8/1999 Approximately three-fourths of a mile from the station, he saw items newly washed ashore, which indicated a shipwreck. After traveling two more miles and finding much more debris, he heard what sounded like sails frapping and then faint voices. He flashed his lantern over the ocean and saw something out over the high flood tide. A ship had keeled over approximately 25 feet from shore and the mast had fallen across the ship. It was still dark, and Midgett could not see far. However, he managed to make out the remains of a shipwrecked vessel that had run aground, with men clutching to remaining wood approximately 100 yards from him. It was approximately 4:30 am.Duffus, Kevin P. Shipwrecks of the Outer Banks, p. 25, 2007 The Priscilla, a 643-ton barkentine, was out of Baltimore, Maryland on August 12, 1899, passing the Virginia Capes at 6:00 am on August 14, and bound for Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. She was captained by Benjamin Springsteen, who was joined by his wife and 12-year-old son, Elmer, and crewed by 12 including another son, William Nate. At 3:00 am on the stormy, windy, and rainy evening of August 18, Surfman Erasmus Midgett left Gull Shoals Life Saving Station on beach patrol.Couch, Daniel C. In 100 Years the Great Hurricane of 1899 has not been Forgotten in Island Breeze, p. 35, August 1999. At about the same time the Priscilla bottomed out as the result of 100 mph winds from an intense hurricane called San Ciriaco. (This was in an era before hurricanes were given names). The seas broke over Priscilla with such force that Captain Springsteen‚Äôs wife and son and two crewmen were washed away. An hour later the hull broke in two and the crew congregated on the aft part. The aft section was continually swept by the sea and finally settled near the shore. She grounded three miles south of Gull Shoals Station and 2.5 miles north of Little Kinnakeet Station. Today, the Priscilla wreck is located just north of Avon, NC at GPS coordinates . Midgett had to make a difficult decision: to spend three hours bringing assistance from the station, or to attempt a rescue without any aid. Furthermore, if Midgett was incapacitated while attempting an individual rescue, another patrol would not find the men for hours. By then, it would probably be too late. Midgett decided to try rescuing the men immediately. The surf was violent, breaching the narrow stretch of sand between the ocean and Pamlico Sound. Midgett waited until a wave had receded, then ran as close as he dared, yelling instructions to the shipwrecked men. He told them that when he called, one man should jump off the floating debris and head towards shore, with Midgett assisting him. As soon as Midgett had a chance, he again ran forward, calling for a man to jump. He then helped the man reach the shore, pulling him through the waves. Midgett repeated this six more times, but then faced another problem. There were three men remaining in the water, but they were too exhausted to swim towards shore. Midgett fearlessly entered the sea, and one by one, carried each remaining man to the beach. The seven men who were still able to walk began heading towards the station at Midgett's direction, while he himself cared for the remaining three, including the Captain of the Priscilla, Benjamin E. Springsteen, who survived the ship wreck but would die a year later. After Midgett was certain that the three men would be safe and giving his own coat to Captain Springsteen, he rode his horse back to the station to summon the aid of his comrades. Keeper Pugh was on the beach when Midgett came into sight. Upon hearing Midgett‚Äôs amazing story, Pugh ordered two of the surfmen to harness horses to their carts and proceed to bring up the disabled men. The other surfmen he directed to set up a stove in the sitting room and prepare for the castaways.U.S. Coast Guard in US Lifesaving Association Website, 3/31/09 For this rescue Lt. C.E. Johnston recommended, based on the transcript of the station log, the wreck report of the Keeper, and the report of the Assistant who investigated the loss of life, that Rasmus Midgett be awarded the Gold Lifesaving Medal. Midgett was subsequently awarded a Gold Lifesaving Medal by the Secretary of the Treasury. With the award the Secretary transmitted a highly commendatory letter reciting the story of the brave man‚Äôs heroism. The inscription read on one side: To Rasmus Midgett for rescuing singlehanded ten men from the Priscilla, August 18, 1899. and on the other: In Testimony of Heroic Deeds in the Saving of Life from the Perils of the Sea. Midgett was awarded the Gold Lifesaving Medal on October 18, 1899.Document No. 2215, Office of Life Saving Service, Department of the Treasury and U.S. Coast Guard in US Lifesaving Association Website, 3/31/09 Personal life Midgett was born Erasmus S. Midgett in 1851 on Hatteras Island. At that time, Hatteras Island was part of Hyde County (it is now part of Dare County.) He stayed on Hatteras Island for most of his life. He was father to Arthur Midgett by Matilda Midgett. Rasmus Midget lived in Waves, NC; 5 miles south of Chicamacomico Station and is buried in Waves, on the west side of NC 12 (GPS coordinates 35¬∞34'20.1‚ÄùN 75¬∞28'13.3‚ÄùW).

The remains of the city are located in Yi County, Baoding, Hebei Province. At 30 km¬≤, Xiadu is the largest excavated city from the Warring States period. Xiadu was surrounded by a moat and rammed earth wall; the base of the city walls measured 40 m at its widest. A portion of the old city wall, measuring up to 6.8 m high, still remains today. The ruins were first excavated in 1929 by an archaeological expedition from Peking University. The city was built in the Taihang Mountains, flanked by the Beiyi River to its north and by the Zhongyi River to its south. The difficult topography made it easy to defend from attack. The city was square, with a wall and canal running north‚Äìsouth through its center, dividing the city into eastern and western halves. Large workshops for casting iron, casting bronze, minting coins, making weapons, making pottery and making bone objects were all found in the eastern city. The palace and royal cemeteries were also located in the eastern city. Two cemeteries were discovered; 13 and 10 tombs were found in each. All the tombs were covered by a pyramidal tumulus.

Byrnes, the United States Secretary of State, in Stuttgart on September 6, 1946. Also known as the \\"Speech of hope\\" it set the tone of future US policy, as it repudiated the economic policies of the Morgenthau Plan and, with its message of a change to a policy of economic reconstruction, gave the Germans hope for the future.  Context and speech  The Western powers' worst fear by now was that the poverty and hunger envisioned by the Morgenthau Plan would drive the Germans to Communism. American Occupation General Lucius Clay stated, \\"There is no choice between being a communist on 1,500 calories a day and a believer in democracy on a thousand\\". The speech was also seen as a first firm stand against the Soviet Union as it stated the intention of the United States to maintain a military presence in Europe indefinitely. But the heart of the message was as Byrnes stated a month later \\"The nub of our program was to win the German people ... it was a battle between us and Russia over minds. ... \\" On the question of territorial integrity of Germany it was stated that \\"the United States will not support any encroachment on territory which is indisputably German or any division of Germany which is not genuinely desired by the people concerned. So far as the United States is aware the people of the Ruhr area and the Rhineland desire to remain united with the rest of Germany. And the United States is not going to oppose their desire.\\" A stated exception to US support for self-determination was the support given in the speech to the French claim to the Saarland. Byrnes, who accepted Western Neisse as the provisional Polish border,No exit: America and the German problem, 1943‚Äì1954, page 94, James McAllister,Cornell University Press 2002 also addressed the Polish and Soviet claims to all German territory east of the Oder-Neisse line, an area comprising roughly 25% of pre-war (1937) Germany. In his speech, he left the final extent of the area east of the Oder Neisse that would become permanently Polish to be decided in the future, stating, \\"The Soviets and the Poles suffered greatly at the hands of Hitler's invading armies. As a result of the agreement at Yalta, Poland ceded to the Soviet Union territory east of the Curzon Line. Because of this, Poland asked for revision of her northern and western frontiers. The United States will support revision of these frontiers in Poland's favor. However, the extent of the area to be ceded to Poland must be determined when the final settlement is agreed upon.\\"Stuttgart Speech\\" (Peter H. Merkl, German Unification, 2004 Penn State Press, p. 338\\") Byrnes in fact did not state that such a change would take place. The purpose of the speech and associated US diplomatic activities was as propaganda aimed at Germany by the Western Powers, who could then blame Polish-German border and German expulsions on Moscow alone. The territory had been handed over to Polish and Soviet administration at the Potsdam conference, the border was to be determined at the peace conference (which did not take place until 1990, and ratified what had been in place since 1945), but with the area experiencing the flight and expulsion of Germans in 1944‚Äì50 it in the de facto became Polish and Soviet territory.  Polish response  The Polish government responded to the speech with loud rhetoric, with claims that the US was supporting remnants of the Hitler regime and officially claimed that the border set at Potsdam was final.\\" (Debra J. Allen, The Oder- Neisse line: the United States, Poland, and Germany in the Cold War, 2003 Greenwood Publishing Group, pp. 50‚Äì52\\") In a speech, W≈Çadys≈Çaw Gomu≈Çka condemned Byrne's speech and its implication of a border revision in favor of Germany as reactionary. It made Gomulka see it as further need for a strong Polish-Soviet Union alliance. Many years later, Polish leader Wojciech Jaruzelski would reflect on the implications of the speech: > It was a shocking statement. It made us think that our western border was > being questioned by the Germans and by other Western countries. It was one > of the most important things that strengthened our ties with the Soviet > Union.\\" (Scott Lucas, Freedom's war: the US crusade against the Soviet > Union, 1945‚Äì56, 2004 Manchester University Press ND, p. 23\\") Olszewski asked the US ambassador to Poland for an explanation, claiming that the speech would have a negative impact on the Poles from beyond Curzon Line that were moving into western territories. Ambassador Arthur Bliss Lane reassured Byrne's speech should not be interpreted as US's desire to avoid its obligations made at Potsdam. He underlined that Poland was given provisional control over the area, and if the Polish settlers believed that their presence was permanent, it was due to work of Polish government and press itself. Lane later continued to reassure Poles of US friendship and was disturbed by distortion of Byrnes speech. Eventually, he learned, after discussing the issue with members of Department of State, that the speech was intended to \\"smoke out Molotov's attitude on the eve of elections in Germany\\". From November 1946, onward the US military government in Germany prepared a number of new alternative border plans. U.S. Secretary of State George Marshall insisted during the 1947 Council of Foreign Ministers meetings in Moscow and London that a border revision be done that would return agricultural areas Pomerania and Silesia to Germany while leaving Poland large part of eastern Pomernia and Upper Silesia, as well as Gda≈Ñsk and East Prussia.\\" (Pertti Ahonen, After the expulsion: West Germany and Eastern Europe, 1945‚Äì1990, 2003 Oxford University Press, pp. 26‚Äì27\\") With backing from the UK and from France, he also advocated the establishment of a four-power commission that would be given the task of deciding the extent of the new border revisions in favor of Germany. The American change of tactic was motivated by two things: winning over German loyalties and embarrassing the Soviet Union; in private, American policy makers like Marshall admitted that chances of changing the border were \\"very slender\\". The speech had a negative impact on US relations with Poland but made the Germans more positive to the US, and the Soviet Union was forced to commit itself to the Oder-Neisse line. As a consequence of this commitment, the Soviet Union had to give up any hope of gaining influence over West Germany.

Experiences and reports Mme L. reports that ‚Äú1, 2, 3 are children without fixed personalities; they play together. 4 is a good peaceful woman, absorbed by down-to-earth occupations and who takes pleasure in them. 5 is a young man, ordinary and common in his tastes and appearance, but extravagant and self-centered. 6 is a young man of 16 or 17, very well brought up, polite, gentle, agreeable in appearance, and with upstanding tastes; average intelligence; orphan. 7 is a bad sort, although brought up well; spiritual, extravagant, gay, likeable; capable of very good actions on occasion; very generous. 8 is a very dignified lady, who acts appropriately, and who is linked with 7 and has much influence on him. She is the wife of 9. 9 is the husband of 8. He is self-centred, maniacal, selfish, thinks only about himself, is grumpy, endlessly reproaching his wife for one thing or another; telling her, for example, that he would have been better to have married a 9, since between them they would have made 18 ‚Äì as opposed to only 17 with her‚Ä¶ 10, and the other remaining numerals, have no personifications‚Äù. Calkins (1893) describes a case for whom ‚ÄúT‚Äôs are generally crabbed, ungenerous creatures. U is a soulless sort of thing. 4 is honest, but‚Ä¶ 3 I cannot trust‚Ä¶ 9 is dark, a gentleman, tall and graceful, but politic under his suavity‚Äù . For synesthete MT ‚ÄúI [is] a bit of a worrier at times, although easy-going; J [is] male; appearing jocular, but with strength of character; K [is] female; quiet, responsible‚Ä¶‚Äù . More recently AP has reported that February is ‚Äúan introverted female‚Äù, while F is a ‚Äú[male] dodgy geezer‚Äù. Similarly, May is reported to be ‚Äúsoft-spoken‚Äù and ‚Äúgirly‚Äù while M is an ‚Äúold lady [who] natter[s] a lot‚Äù, and while August is ‚Äúa boy among girls‚Äù, A is a female ‚Äúmother type‚Äù (; ). Experimental studies Personifications tend to co-occur with grapheme-color synesthesia and share many of the characteristics that are definitional of synesthesia, such as being consistent over considerable time intervals and generating concurrents automatically . To demonstrate that personifications are automatically evoked, Simner and Holenstein used a modified Stroop paradigm, in which a mismatch between the evoked personality and the gender leads to slower reaction times. To test this, synesthete AP was asked to report whether common names, like Brian or Betsy were male or female names. Because ‚Äòb‚Äô is a male letter for AP, she was faster to identify Brian as being a male name, and slower to identify Betsy as being a female name. These results demonstrate that personifications are automatically evoked, as are other forms of synesthesia. In a slightly different task, in which letters that evoke either male or female personifications are arranged into a stick figure of either a boy or a girl, reactions times are slower when the letters do not match the figure than when they do, again demonstrating the automaticity of this form of synesthesia . Neural basis One study in 2016 led by Prof. Julia Simner showed subtle differences in the white matter structure in the brains of people with OLP, compared with control subjects. These harmless differences were in five clusters, in the pre-postcentral gyrus/ dorsal corticospinal tract, left superior corona radiata, and the genu, body and left side of the corpus callosum. A number of these regions play a role in social responsiveness (Simner et al., 2016) Among the Pythagoreans The Pythagoreans, an ancient Greek cult of natural philosophers notable for their interest in numerology, personified the natural numbers by assigning gender to them; the odd numbers were male and the even female . However, given the prevalence of synesthesia (1 in 23, see the main synesthesia entry), and that this is consistent among the Pythagoreans, this is unlikely to be synesthesia, but rather a form of learned association. In fiction In A Tree Grows in Brooklyn, Francie gives numbers personalities while learning basic math operations. She gives X and Y personalities as well. In \\"A Primer of the Daily Round,\\" poet Howard Nemerov assigns actions to personified letters of the alphabet. On television On the first episode of season thirty-one of Jeopardy!, Jeopardy!

Description Based on a method proposed in 1869 by Louis Ducos du Hauron in Les Couleurs en Photographie ‚Äì Solution du Probleme, the Joly colour process used a glass photographic plate with fine vertical red, green and blue lines less than 0.1 mm wide printed on them. The plate acted as a series of very fine filters, in a similar way to the later Paget process. To take a photograph, the filter screen was placed in the camera in front of an orthochromatic photographic plate, so that the light passed through the filter before striking the emulsion. After exposure, the plate was processed and contact-printed on another plate to make a positive black-and-white transparency. This was then placed in register with a viewing screen of the same type as used for exposure, to produce a limited-colour transparency that could be viewed by transmitted light. The Joly process was introduced commercially in 1895 and remained on the market for a few years. However, it was expensive and the commercially available emulsions of the time were not sensitive to the full range of the spectrum, so the final colour image could not achieve the look of \\"natural colour\\". A large collection of colour slides by John Joly, mainly of botanical subjects, are held by the National Library of Ireland.

Antedios came to power in 25 CE, succeeding the Icenian ruler Can. Evidence indicates that Antedios remained neutral during the Roman invasion of Britain in 43 CE, and was later made a client of Rome. Antedios issued coins bearing his own name - Anted - but later retracted the issuance, probably under pressure from other Icenian nobles. He then issued coins bearing the inscription \\"ECEN\\" referring to the name of the tribe. It is most probable that Antedios died before the end of the Icenian War of 47 CE, because after the war, power was passed to the pro-Roman leader Prasutagus, and Antedios was never heard of again.

Smith of Zurich, Switzerland and available by early 1907.Czapek, C.W., \\"Experiments with the Bleach-Out Printing Process\\", British Journal of Photography, Colour Photography Supplement, April 5, 1907, pp. 28-29. Improved versions appeared in later years. It used the direct bleach- out method of color reproduction first proposed by Louis Ducos du Hauron and Charles Cros in the late 1860s and based on the fact that a substance can only be affected by exposure to light if it absorbs some of that light.The Grotthuss-Draper law. Unstable coloring matter is therefore bleached by light of its complementary color, which it strongly absorbs, but little affected by light of its own color, which it mostly transmits or reflects. The Uto paper came coated with a mixture of cyan, magenta and yellow dyes which appeared nearly black. It was sensitized with a catalyst that greatly increased the susceptibility of the dyes to fading. Where the coating was exposed to red light, that light was absorbed by the cyan dye and therefore bleached it, leaving the magenta and yellow dyes, which together appeared red; yellow light was absorbed by both the cyan and magenta dyes, bleaching them to leave only the yellow; green light bleached only the magenta, leaving cyan and yellow, which appeared green; blue light bleached only the yellow dye, leaving the cyan and magenta dyes, which in combination absorbed all colors of light except blue. Less strongly colored light bleached all three dyes to differing degrees, and white light bleached all three equally, leaving only a grayish dye mixture or the bare white paper. After exposure, the catalyst was rinsed out of the coating. In practice, an hours-long exposure to direct sunlight was required to completely bleach the dyes, making Utocolor paper useless in a camera. It was suitable only for reproducing transparent colored originals, such as stained or \\"art\\" glass, paintings on glass, and early photographic color images on glass such as Autochromes. Although rinsing out the catalyst stabilized the prints and made them much less sensitive to light, it did not actually \\"fix\\" them by removing all sensitivity, so they were unfit for prolonged open display and were best kept in the protective darkness of a closed album when not being examined.

He ascended to the office when Governor Augustus O. Stanley was elected to the U.S. Senate. Black graduated from Tusculum College in 1872 and taught school while studying law. He was admitted to the bar in 1874 and opened his legal practice in Barbourville, Kentucky. Eventually, his son, Pitzer Dixon, and his son-in-law, Hiram H. Owens, became partners in his practice, called Black, Black and Owens. Deeply interested in education, he served as superintendent of the Knox County public schools for two years, and was instrumental in the founding of Union College in Barbourville. He served as president of the college from 1910 to 1912. Black was chosen as the Democratic nominee for lieutenant governor in 1915, despite having only meager previous political experience. He was elected on a ticket with Augustus O. Stanley and was elevated to governor when Stanley resigned to take a seat in the U.S. Senate. Much of his seven months as governor were spent on his re- election campaign. He was unable to satisfactorily answer charges of corruption made against the Stanley administration by his opponent, Edwin P. Morrow. Morrow won the election by more than 40,000 votes. Black returned to his legal practice in Barbourville and served as president of a bank founded by his older brother. He was campaign manager for Alben Barkley's senatorial campaign when he died of pneumonia on August 5, 1938. Early life and family James Dixon Black was born on September 24, 1849 nine miles from Barbourville on Richland Creek in Knox County, Kentucky.Hay, p. 149. He was the youngest of twelve children born to John Craig and Clarissa \\"Cassie\\" (Jones) Black.Kerr, p. 3 Black's older brother, Isaac Jones Black (August 5, 1828 - October 22, 1866), was captain of the 49th Kentucky Mounted Infantry in the Union Army during the Civil War.Johnson, p. 1552 Black was educated in the rural and subscription schools in and around Barbourville. In 1872, he graduated from Tusculum College near Greeneville, Tennessee with a Bachelor of Arts degree. After college, Black returned to Knox County where he taught in the public schools for two years.Harrison in The Kentucky Encyclopedia, p. 83 Concurrently, he studied law, and was admitted to the bar in August 1874. He opened his legal practice in Barbourville.\\"Kentucky Governor James Dixon Black\\" Black married Mary Jeanette \\"Nettie\\" Pitzer on December 2, 1875 in Barbourville.Johnson, p. 1553 The couple had three children: Pitzer Dixon, Gertrude Dawn, and Georgia Clarice. All were members of the Methodist Episcopal Church. All three children graduated from what is now Centre College in Danville, Kentucky. Pitzer then went on to study law at the University of Virginia.Kerr, p. 4 After being admitted to the bar, he became a partner in his father's law firm. Georgia Black married Hiram Hercules Owens, who also became a partner in the Barbourville firm of Black, Black, and Owens. Educational career Black was elected to represent Knox and Whitley counties in the Kentucky House of Representatives in 1876. A Democrat representing a district with a majority of Republican voters, he served a single, one-year term. In 1879, Black and other citizens of Barbourville purchased stock to fund the start up of a new college in Barbourville. Black insisted that the college be named Union College, because he hoped the college would unify the community. He continued to be involved in the development of the college, serving as its attorney and as a fund-raiser. Deeply interested in education, he also served as superintendent of the Knox County public schools in 1884 and 1885, but returned to his law practice thereafter. A long- time Freemason, Black served as master of his local lodge on seven different occasions, was twice high priest of the Barbourville Chapter of the Royal Arch Masons, and was chosen Grand Master of Kentucky in 1888. In 1893, he was chosen by Kentucky governor John Y. Brown as a commissioner to the Chicago World's Columbian Exposition, representing Kentucky's forestry and mineral departments.Johnson, pp. 1552‚Äì1553 On September 10, 1910, Black was named the eighth president of Union College.http://www.unionky.edu/departments/president/past-presidents The following year, his alma mater awarded him an honorary Doctor of Laws degree. He served as president of Union College until 1912. Political career Black returned to politics in 1912 when he became Kentucky's first assistant attorney general. In 1915, he was chosen as the Democratic nominee for lieutenant governor. Black was pro-temperance, and was chosen to balance the ticket with Augustus O. Stanley, who opposed prohibition. While Black defeated his opponent, Lewis L. Walker, by more than 8,000 votes, Stanley bested Republican Edwin P. Morrow by only 421 votes, the closest gubernatorial election in the state's history.Powell, p. 84Harrison in A New History of Kentucky, pp. 285‚Äì286 alt=A black-and-white photo of a bald man in his fifties Though Stanley and Black won the election, they never became political allies.Klotter, p. 232 At the time of their election and service, the Kentucky Constitution prescribed that the lieutenant governor would act as governor any time the governor left the state. Consequently, Stanley refused to travel out of state on vacation because he feared he would not approve of anyone Black would appoint to any unfilled governmental offices while he was gone. Black ascended to the governorship on May 19, 1919 when Governor Stanley resigned to assume a seat in the U.S. Senate. His pro-temperance stand cost him many of Stanley's supporters, while his association with Stanley, a prohibition opponent, caused his support to wane among prohibitionists.Hay, p. 150 There was no legislative session of the General Assembly during Black's term, so potential conflicts with the legislature were avoided. Black immediately faced accusations of poor appointments by Stanley. The School Textbook Commission was singled out for particular criticism. The Kentucky Court of Appeals had ruled that the Commission acted illegally in selecting textbooks submitted in dummy form. Black called on the commissioners to resign, but when they refused, he claimed he had no power to remove them except for fraud or corruption. The Louisville Courier-Journal pointed out that Black could replace any Stanley appointees that had not yet been confirmed by the Senate, but Black refused to do so. Some believed that Black had agreed to retain Stanley's appointees in exchange for Stanley's support of Black's re-election campaign. The settlement of state inheritance taxes on two estates also plagued Black. In the first case, Governor Stanley had made a compromise settlement of back taxes with L. V. Harkness before his death. The compromise was criticized, and although Black asked the attorney general to investigate, the case was not decided during Black's tenure as governor. In the second case, Stanley had appointed three special attorneys to collect inheritance taxes from the estate of Mrs. Robert Worth Bingham. Black wanted the attorneys to resign and save the state their large fees, but refused to remove them outright. This action was made more damning because one of the attorneys was a member of Black's campaign staff. In 1919, Black was chosen as the Democratic gubernatorial nominee over John D. Carroll, chief justice of the Kentucky Court of Appeals, by more than 20,000 votes. The Republicans again nominated Edwin P. Morrow, who implored voters to \\"Right the Wrong of 1915\\".Klotter, p. 233 Since Black had very little record as governor in his own right, Morrow campaigned against him by attacking Stanley's administration as corrupt. Morrow cited as evidence the tax cases of Mr. Harkness and Mrs. Bingham and Black's inaction against the State Textbook Commission. Black tried to remain positive in his race, and focused on national issues rather than defending Stanley's administration. He touted his support of President Woodrow Wilson and declared his support for the United States' admission into the League of Nations. His support of Wilson hurt him with German American voters, and Wilson's handling of recent coal strikes hurt Black with the traditionally Democratic labor vote. Days before the election, Morrow exposed a contract approved by the state Board of Control to purchase cloth from a man named A. S. J. Armstrong at twice its normal price. Black responded to the allegation by temporarily suspending his campaign and ordering an investigation. The investigation revealed that Armstrong was a plumber who was bidding on behalf of his brother-in-law, a former prison official in the Stanley administration. Despite this revelation, Black refused to remove members of the Board of Control. This issue finally sank Black's candidacy; Morrow won the election by more than 40,000 votes.Hay, p. 151. In his final days in office, Black considered many requests for executive clemency. On December 1, 1919, he issued a pardon for Henry Youtsey, a recent parolee who had served eighteen years for conspiracy in the assassination of Governor William Goebel. In 1918, while still serving as lieutenant governor, Black had assumed the presidency of the John A. Black National Bank of Barbourville, named for and founded by his older brother. He became chief prohibition inspector for Kentucky in 1920. Later, he served as director of the Barbourville Cemetery Company. While working as Ninth Congressional District campaign manager for Senator Alben Barkley in 1938, Black developed pneumonia and died on August 5, 1938. He is entombed in a mausoleum at Barbourville Cemetery.

One night an old man (or in some versions, an angel in disguise) came down to the city, in search of food and drink. He went from door to door, and at each house he was turned away. Finally, he came to the hovel of a poor couple just outside the town; the couple took him in and treated him with great kindness. When the stranger was about to leave, he turned to face the town and uttered the curse: \\"Semerwater rise, and Semerwater sink, And swallow the town all save this house, Where they gave me food and drink.\\" An alternative version as told by locals; \\"Semerwater rise, Semerwater sink, drown all the people In the village except for this house which gave me meat\\". And as soon as this was said, the waters of the lake rose up and flooded the village, drowning the proud inhabitants and leaving only the hovel of the poor couple on the hillside unscathed.The Legend of Semerwater The legend was the subject of a poem, The Ballad of Semerwater, by Sir William Watson.The Ballad of Semerwater Popular culture Semerwater was featured in the British television series All Creatures Great and Small, in the episode \\"Female of the Species\\".\\"Semer Water, N Yorks, UK ‚Äì All Creatures Great & Small, The Female Of The Species (1988)\\" - Waymarking.com  References  External links *Lake Semerwater website Lakes of North Yorkshire Sites of Special Scientific Interest in North Yorkshire RSemerwater ","title":"Semerwater"},{"id":"6484100","text":"North Carolina Highway 22 (NC 22) is a North Carolina state highway that runs in the central-north part of the state. It runs between Southern Pines and Climax. The route is signed north-south, and is in length. Route description The route's northern terminus is in the community of Climax at NC 62 in Guilford County. Shortly after beginning, the route crosses into Randolph County. Running southward as a two-lane road, NC 22 goes through the town of Franklinville and enters Ramseur, where it meets US 64/NC 49. Continuing south out of Ramseur, NC 22 joins NC 42 in the small community of Coleridge. The dual numbered road then continues southeasterly through the community of Bennett in Chatham County where it meets a terminus of NC 902. Shortly after, NC 22 splits from NC 42 and runs south into Moore County. After crossing the Deep River, NC 22 meets NC 24/NC 27. From that intersection, the three routes become cosigned for a five-mile (8 km) stretch into Carthage. NC 22 splits from NC 24 and NC 27 in Carthage after looping around the Moore County courthouse. Exiting Carthage as McNeill Street, NC 22 joins US 15/501 for a one-mile (1.6 km) stretch before running independently to its southern terminus at NC 2 in Southern Pines. The route ends just shy of NC 2's interchange with U.S. 1. History Original NC 22 *The original NC 22 appeared in 1922, running from NC 20 in Whiteville northward toward Fayetteville where it ended at NC 40. *1925: NC 22 is realigned coming out of Fayetteville, now going straight southward through Lumberton and then to the South Carolina state border, where it becomes SC 23. *1927: US 217's new routing makes the entire NC 22 route also part of that highway. *1932: US 301 replaces US 217 on NC 22. *2004: A seven-mile (11 km) segment of NC 22 north of Climax is truncated as a result of the construction of the I-85 Greensboro Bypass. NC 22's former northern terminus at US 421 was eliminated. This truncated segment of NC 22 went through the town Pleasant Garden.NCRoads Annex - NC 19-23 Current route *1934: With US 301's entire route being NC 22, the number could be better assigned elsewhere. With the arrival of US 64, NC 22 was reassigned to NC 64. It was then a much shorter highway, running from NC 27 in Carthage to US 421 in Greensboro, North Carolina. *1952: NC 22's southern end is aligned to its current ending in Southern Pines. *2004: NC 22 is shortened just west of 421 to NC 62 in Climax. Apparently, I-85's relocation to the new southern Greensboro bypass cut off NC 22 from US 421.State Ends - NC 22 Major intersections References 022 Interstate 85 Transportation in Moore County, North Carolina Transportation in Chatham County, North Carolina Transportation in Randolph County, North Carolina Transportation in Guilford County, North Carolina ","title":"North Carolina Highway 22"},{"id":"6484116","text":"David Alves (1866‚Äì1924) was a Portuguese politician of Partido Regenerador during the constitutional monarchy.

Life & work Valenciennes worked in Rome from 1778 to 1782, where he made a number of landscape studies directly from nature, sometimes painting the same set of trees or house at different times of day. He theorized on this idea in his 1800 treatise Reflections and Advice to a Student on Painting, Particularly on Landscape, developing a concept of a \\"landscape portrait\\" in which the artist paints a landscape directly while looking upon it, taking care to capture its particular details. Painting outside allowed Valenciennes to capture the fleeting changes of a landscape due to light and weather. He was a proponent of artists working outside and painting the same view at multiple times of day. Although he spoke of this as a type of painting mainly of interest to \\"amateurs\\", as distinguished from the higher art of the academies, he found it of great interest, and of his own works the surviving landscape portraits have been the most noted by later commentators. He in particular urged artists to capture the distinctive details of a scene's architecture, dress, agriculture, and so on, in order to give the landscape a sense of belonging to a specific place; in this he probably influenced other French artists active in Italy who took an anthropological approach to painting rural areas and customs, such as Hubert Robert, Pierre-Athanase Chauvin and Achille-Etna Michallon. Among his students were Jean-Victor Bertin, Achille Etna Michallon, Louis √âtienne Watelet, Louis- Fran√ßois Lejeune and the first French panorama painter Pierre Pr√©vost. Born in the city of Toulouse, he died in Paris and is buried there in the P√®re Lachaise Cemetery.

He received a BFA from the University of Washington School of Drama. Anderson made his film debut in Sweet Revenge in 1976. He is best known for the role of photographer Dennis Price, whose nickname was The Animal, in the television series Lou Grant from 1977 to 1982. The slovenly character was controversial among photographic professionals. Early in the series' run, the Professional Photographers Association of America demanded that the Animal character be eliminated. However, the National Press Photographers Association found that the series and Anderson's character had sparked interest in many young people in entering the profession. The Associated Press wire carried a photograph he took of a major fire near a Lou Grant filming location in Los Angeles. The photo appeared in hundreds of newspapers. The C. E. Rynd Photographic Fine Arts gallery in Seattle hosted an exhibit of his photography in 1988. In 1984, Anderson married actress Kathy Connell. Since 1995, they have served as producers of the annual Screen Actors Guild Awards. Anderson was an officer of SAG from 1980 to 2002.

Instead the term poliziottesco, a fusion of the words poliziotto (\\"policeman\\") and the same -esco desinence, has prevailed (over the more syntactically-correct Poliziesco all'Italiana) to indicate 1970s-era Italian-produced \\"tough cop\\" and crime movies. The prevalence of Poliziottesco over Poliziesco all'Italiana closely follows the success of the term Spaghetti Western over Western all'Italiana, being shorter and more vivid - though in both instances the term that has come to be used more frequently by English- speaking fans of the genre (poliziotteschi, Spaghetti Westerns) was originally used pejoratively by critics, to denigrate the films themselves and their makers. History Although the subgenre has its roots in Italian heist films of the late 1960s, such as Bandits in Milan (Banditi a Milano, 1968) by Carlo Lizzani, it was also strongly influenced by such rough-edged American police thrillers of the late 1960s and early 1970s as Bullitt, Dirty Harry, The French Connection, Magnum Force, and Serpico; the 1970s wave of American vigilante films, including 1974's Death Wish; the increase of cynicism and violence in French crime films; the resurgence of mob films in the wake of The Godfather; French and American noir and neo-noir films; and the rise of exploitation films in the late 1960s and 1970s. More generally, the genre was also heavily influenced by real-life crime and unrest in 1970s Italy during the period known as the anni di piombo (political violence, kidnappings, assassinations, bank robberies, political militant terrorism, impending oil crisis, political corruption, organized crime-related violence, and recession).Violent Italy: A Poliziotteschi PrimerBirth.Movies.Death. Just as American police films, American crime thrillers, and American vigilante films of the time focused on the crime waves and urban decline in the United States of the 1960s and 1970s, poliziotteschi were set in the context of, or directly addressed, the sociopolitical tumult and violence of Italy's anni di piombo, or the \\"Years of Lead\\", a period of widespread social unrest, political upheaval, labor unrest, rising crime, political violence, and political terrorism from the 1960s to 1980s. During this period, paramilitary and militant political terrorist groups, both on the far left (e.g. the Red Brigades) and far right (e.g. the neo-fascist Nuclei Armati Rivoluzionari) engaged in kidnappings, assassinations, and bombings (such as the Piazza Fontana bombing and 1980 Bologna train station bombing). At the same time, there was a period of especially violent conflict and disorder within the Sicilian Mafia, kicked off with the \\"First Mafia War\\" of the 1960s and culminating in the \\"Second Mafia War\\" of the early 1980s. Italian organized crime groups such as the Sicilian Mafia, the Camorra, and especially the Roman Banda della Magliana were actively involved in both criminal and political activities during this time, carrying out bombings and kidnappings, making deals with corrupt politicians, and forming strong ties to extreme far right groups and neo-fascist terrorist organizations. Accordingly, poliziotteschi films such as Execution Squad (1972) often featured political extremists and paramilitary or terrorist groups alongside or in addition to the more commonly featured apolitical mafiosi and gangster criminal elements found in Italian crime films. Due in part to the genre's often ostensibly negative portrayal of political activists and militants, especially leftist militants, and its seeming endorsement of vigilantism and \\"tough-on-crime\\" or \\"law and order\\" stances, some poliziotteschi films (such as 1976's The Big Racket) were criticized by then-contemporaneous critics and accused of exploiting conservative fears of rising crime and political upheaval while containing reactionary, pro-violence, or even quasi-Fascist ideological elements in their overarching message. These critiques were similar to those leveled at the 1970s American \\"vigilante films\\" of the same period, such as 1974's Death Wish, films by which the poliziotteschi genre were considerably influenced. In retrospect, despite contemporaneous claims in the 1970s of overly conservative or reactionary themes within the genre, film historians such as Louis Bayman and Peter Bondarella contend that, in fact, poliziotteschi films generally presented a more multi-faceted, complex outlook on the political turmoil and crime waves of the time, as well as violence in general, with Bayman and author Roberto Curti in particular arguing that the genre generally used political conflicts and violence for largely apolitical tension-building and cathartic or emotional purposes rather than to promote any particular political agendas. Curti notes that the genre's protagonists often simultaneously displayed both right-wing and left-wing views, and protagonists were often working class while villains were often wealthy right-wing conservatives. The film Caliber 9 (1972), for instance, features protagonists of both right-wing and leftist ideologies and offers differing views on the causes of crime and the true antagonists of law-abiding Italian society, while Execution Squad reveals the actual antagonists of the film to be right-wing reactionary, \\"tough-on-crime\\" ex-police officers and vigilantes rather than the initially suspected leftist militants. Rather than explicitly supporting violence or vigilantism, the genre just as often displayed a morally ambiguous or aloof position on these themes, or even presented vigilantism and violence as a no-win situation. Though poliziotteschi films have been viewed by some critics as condemning a \\"liberal\\" or \\"weak\\" judiciary system as ineffectual in its treatment of criminals, the genre also suggests a more general distrust of authority, whether left-wing or right-wing, by portraying right-wing law enforcement, politicians and businessmen as hopelessly corrupt and manipulative. According to Bondarella, the \\"classic\\" poliziotteschi film reveals \\"almost universal suspicion of the very social institutions charged with protecting Italian society from criminal violence.\\" With directors such as Fernando Di Leo and Umberto Lenzi and actors such as Maurizio Merli and Tomas Milian, poliziotteschi films became popular in the mid-1970s after the decline of Spaghetti Westerns and Eurospy genres. The subgenre lost its mainstream popularity in the late 1970s as Italian erotic comedy and horror films started topping the Italian box office. Although based around crime and detective work, poliziotteschi should not be confused with the other popular Italian crime genre of the 1970s, the giallo, which (incorrectly) refers to violent murder-mystery crime films. Directors and stars often moved between both forms, and some films could be considered under either banner, such as Massimo Dallamano's What Have They Done to Your Daughters? (1974). The poliziottesco subgenre gradually declined in popularity during the late 1970s. Screenwriter Dardano Sacchetti, who was unhappy with what he deemed the genre's \\"fascistic\\" undertones, credits himself for \\"destroying it from the inside\\", by making it evolve into self-parody. By the end of the decade, the most successful films associated with the genre were crime-comedy pictures, which gradually evolved towards pure comedy.Christian Uva, Michele Picchi, Destra e sinistra nel cinema italiano. film e immaginario politico dagli anni '60 al nuovo millennio, Edizioni interculturali, 2006, p. 90 Directors include * Mario Bianchi * Alfonso Brescia * Enzo G.

The etymology may be linked with British *lemanio \\"elm-tree\\", but there are other possibilities. An archaeological survey undertaken on Kelsall Villa (a Roman site near to Leeming Bar) describes it as deriving from the river with Leming meaning bright stream. In April 2008, the nearby base's remaining Tornado F3 squadron (25 Sqn) was disbanded. The base has been redeveloped as a communications station with the formation of No. 90 Signals Unit, the first elements of which began arriving in 2006. Two flying squadrons remain at the base, No. 100 Squadron RAF and the Northumbria University Air Squadron.

The plant generates approximately of biogas per year which is fed directly into the Northern Gas Network pipeline and is enough to power almost 4,800 homes. The fertiliser is then sold off to local farms. Local firms such as R & R foods (based at Leeming Bar) and Wensleydale Creamery in Hawes both supply waste product for use in the biogas plant. Wensleydale Creamery, famous for producing Wensleydale Cheese, signed a contract in 2019 for the biogas plant to take on the whey by-product from their cheesemaking. This will add an additional of green gas to the plants' output every year, which is enough to power 800 homes.

The small town of the same name is the administrative seat of this municipality in the region (Comarca) of Llevant.  Population  In 2008 the municipality of Art√† had a population of 7,113 recorded residents within an area of . This equates to 50.9 inhabitants per km2. In 2006 the percentage of foreigners was 13.2% (890), of which Germans made up 3.9% (262). In 1991 there were still 136 illiterates in the municipality. 1,292 inhabitants had no education, 1,675 only a primary school certificate and 1,210 had secondary school leaving certificates. The official languages are Catalan and Spanish (Castilian). The Catalan dialect spoken on the island is known as Mallorqu√≠.  Geography  The town of Art√†  Location  Art√† lies in the northeast of the island of Majorca, around 60 km from the island's capital of Palma. The Mass√≠s d‚ÄôArt√†, the highest and most compact massif in the eastern mountain chain of the Serres de Llevant, occupies more than half the area of the municipality. The municipality is located on the western part of peninsula of Art√† and is bordered in the west by the Bay of Alc√∫dia (Badia d‚ÄôAlc√∫dia), and in the north by the Mediterranean sea where its coast lies opposite the neighbouring island of Menorca. The coast of Art√† stretches for 25 kilometres and, so far, has escaped being developed.Art√† at www.mca-hotels.com. Retrieved on 21 Jun 2010. Particularly noteworthy are the beach and sand dune formations of sa Canova d‚ÄôArt√†, the flat coastal strip near the settlement of Col√≤nia de Sant Pere, the high rocky coves of the Cap de Ferrutx and a large number of smaller bays that extend from s‚ÄôArenalet des Verger to Cala Torta.  Neighbouring communities  To the east and southeast the municipality of Art√† is bordered by the communities of Capdepera and Son Servera. Until the 19th century both belonged, together with the district of Art√†, to the so-called Peninsula of Art√†. Hence why the caves on the east coast of Majorca in the municipality of Capdepera are called the Caves of Art√† (Coves d' Art√†). To the southwest are the municipalities of Sant Lloren√ß des Cardassar and Petra. The Torrent de na Borges, with its hamlet of Son Serra de Marina, forms the western border of Art√† with the municipality of Santa Margalida.  Subdivisions  The following villages are part of the municipality of Art√†: * Art√† (5803 / 6406) * Col√≤nia de Sant Pere (483 / 483) * Urbanitzaci√≥ Betlem (51 / 51) * Urbanitzaci√≥ Montferrutx (114 / 114) * Urbanitzaci√≥ Sant Pere (34 / 34) * Urbanitzaci√≥ s‚ÄôEstanyol (25 / 25) The figures in brackets give the population as at 1 January 2008. The first figure is the number of inhabitants in the main settlement, the second includes those living in 'scattered' dwellings outside the village itself. (Source: INE)  Natural regions  Hills above Urbanitzaci√≥ Betlem Eight moderate to high hills belong to the municipality of Art√†, the Puig Morei (also Puig d‚Äôen Morell or Talaia Freda) at 561 metres being the highest and the Puig d'en Mir being the lowest at 256 metres. The municipality is characterized by extensive areas of uninhabited terrain, especially in the regions in the mountains of the Serres de Llevant. Today, this natural region has become very barren as a result of numerous forest fires in recent years. Fan palms in the region of Art√† The area of the Caps de Ferrutx, with its rocky coves provides the osprey and peregrine falcon, for example, an ideal refuge. The northern coastal region is also home to feral goats. In the valleys of the Massis d‚ÄôArt√†, also called the Serra Artana, there are small groves of holly oak, enclosed by dry stone walls, where almond, fig and carob trees are cultivated. Orchards of olive trees predominate in the hills, growing on steep slopes retained by dry stone walls. Large beds of reed are found amongst the natural vegetation along with fan palms (Chamaerops humilis) typical of the region, low clumps of luxuriant shrubs, wild olive trees and isolated pine woods. The fan palm is still a primary raw material for the basket makers on Majorca.  Climate  Rainfall is recorded in Art√† all year round. The driest month is July with an average of 8.8 l/m2. October records the highest rainfall with an average of 101.3 l/m2. 1945 was the wettest year with 224.3 l/m2.  History  Talaiot of Sa Canova Art√† was first mentioned in 1232 under the name Yart√¢n in the Llibre de repartiment de mallorca (Jaume I). Later it was also written down as Jartan or Jertan. The origin of the name is derived from \\"Gertan\\", the Arab word for garden. This extraordinary landscape has been inhabited since the colonization of Majorca, as witnessed by the archaeological finds in this area:Ses Pa√Øsses and Sa Canova. They date from the time 1300‚Äì100 BC. The coins, seals and vessels of the Talaiotic culture may be seen in the Art√† Regional Museum at Pla√ßa d'Espanya. Little is known about the Art√† region from the Roman or pre- Islamic period. It is believed, however, that the old fortress on the town's hill dates to before the Islamic-Arab possession of the island. In the Arabian era from the 10th to the 13th century and even during the early days of Catalan rule, the fortress was known as the Almudaina, which means something like \\"castle\\" or \\"fortress\\". Parish church and pilgrimage church Today the one-meter thick fortress wall with its nine towers, including the main tower of Sant Miquel, surrounds the pilgrimage church of Santuari de Sant Salvador with its outbuildings. The church houses a multicoloured, carved, wooden, Romanesque statue of the Virgin Mary, which, according to the tradition of the White canons was brought to the island by James I during the conquest of Majorca. A Calvary staircase of 180 steps links the parish church (Esgl√®sia Parroquial) of Transfiguraci√≥ del Senyor at the foot of the town's hill with the 1832 baroque church of Sant Salvador on the 182-metre high Calvary Hill or Puig de Sant Salvador. The 1573 late Gothic style church of La Transfiguraci√≥ replaced the ancient parish church consecrated in 1248 on the site of an earlier mosque. The town of Art√† The old station building During the Arab or Moorish era the peninsula of Yartan was one of thirteen districts of Majorca. After the Catalan conquest of the island the present town of Art√† emerged in the 13th century after the arrival of the Norbertines, or White Monks, who founded the Priory of Santa Maria del Bellpuig. The estate of Bellpuig is three miles southwest of Art√†. From there, the present town area, the farms of Almudaina, were divided into lots and reallocated. The town was still called Almudaina in the 15th century, whilst the name Art√† referred to the entire district. From the 16th to the 18th century the population of the city rose sharply and, in addition to agriculture, it developed a textile industry. An outbreak of bubonic plague in 1820 caused a setback resulting in 1200 deaths. In the 19th century the districts of Capdepera and Son Servera were separated from Art√†. The greater part of the territory of Art√† at that time was in the hands of big landowners. Among the small farmers the craft of basket making from palm leaves developed as an invaluable source of secondary income. In 1880, the land at Devesa de Ferrutx on the Bay of Alc√∫dia was divided up and the coastal village of Colonia de Sant Pere was founded as an agricultural settlement. This quiet tourist resort has the second highest population in the municipality after the town of Arta. The few villages in the municipality of Art√† became well linked by roads in the 20th century, not least with a view to developing tourism, which is now the most important industry on the island. Nevertheless, large parts of the area are still virtually unspoilt due to its sparse settlement, which led to the designation of the nature reserve Parc Natural de la Pen√≠nsula de Llevant in the north of the borough of Art√†. The railway line from Palma via Manacor and Son Servera to Art√† was opened in 1921 but no longer operates. However, there is a plan to re-open a service from Manacor, which should start during the next legislative session.  Culture and places of interest  Fountain square in Art√† Most striking is the enclosed nature of the settlement, with its steep narrow roads that begin at the foot of the hill, and are dominated by the medieval fortress walls of the pilgrimage church of Sant Salvador at the top of the town. The terrace offers a panoramic view of the coast and the hills, the almond orchards, olive groves and the Torre de Canyamel, as well as the fortified Gothic parish church (Transfiguraci√≥ del Senyor) immediately below the hill. From the side of the valley it looks particularly impressive with its high supporting towers. Inside, the wooden Majorcan pulpit and the altar with the Transfiguration of Christ are especially worth seeing. Town Hall and Regional Museum The Regional Museum of Art√† at the Pla√ßa d'Espanya was founded in 1927 by a group of scholars from the town. Artefacts in the museum come from private collections. It is divided into an ethnological, natural history and archaeological departments. The ethnological division displays the various tools used by the palm weavers working in the Llevant today. Also on display are tools of the Majorcan textile trades. The archaeological collection contains a variety of artefacts made of ceramic, bronze, iron and bone, mainly from Majorca's prehistory. Art√† has much to offer the visitor. Of particular interest is the coastal area of the municipality. Right on its border with Santa Margalida, in the hamlet of Son Serra de Marina, is the beach of s'Arenal de sa Canova with its extensive dunes. A coastal path runs along the beach up to the village of s'Estanyol near Colonia de Sant Pere. Further east, between s'Estanyol and es Cal√≥ are steep cliffs and ravines alternate with small sandy beaches. The north of the municipality is dominated by the Mass√≠s d‚ÄôArt√†, with the hills Puig Morei (561m), Puig de sa Tudossa (444m) and Talaia Moreia (432m). The hills fall steeply towards the north, but more gently north-eastward toward the coast. In the northeast of the area several sandy bays have formed at the mouths of so-called torrents. On the coastal hills can still be found towers built between the 16th and 18th century. Nestling amidst the hills, is the Ermita de Betlem, a hermitage inhabited by a monks. Parts of the north coast are covered with pine forests.

The remains of braided and woven plant fibres have been found in archaeological digs here. The main raw material in the western Mediterranean area is the native fan palm with its robust but flexible leaves. This one- metre-high species of palm occurs naturally on Majorca, especially between Manacor and Art√†, and today is grown in large fields around the town of Art√†. The leaves of the fan palm are collected in the months of June and July and first dried in the sun. When they have become a yellowish-white colour, they are separated into finer strands and sorted qualitatively. Next, the higher- quality palm strands are soaked in a mixture of water and chlorine, then sulphurised, which bleaches them further and makes them flexible enough to work. The now soft leaves, called palmito, are then woven into the basic shape of the basket using fixed stems or leaves at right angles to one another. By re-drying the leaves, they contract slightly, giving the mesh extra stability and density. Using coloured leaves or special techniques elaborate patterns are created, sometimes woven into the basic mesh or sometimes into a second or even third layer.

In 1300 James II of Aragon ordered the construction of a fortified village which would control the uninhabited land below and the maritime routes with Majorca. For centuries the village survived behind its walls protected from pirate attacks. As the danger of such attacks disappeared residents of the walled town started to relocate themselves at the bottom of the 162m hill which led to the development of modern-day Capdepera. The better known town of nearby Cala Ratjada actually developed as the fishing and trading port of Capdepera and to this day operates a ferry service with neighbouring Menorca. many German expatriates reside in Capdepera.

She graduated from Chicago State University. She is a member of Trinity United Church of Christ. Political career In 1995, after the resignation of Mel Reynolds from the Congress of the United States, Davis was a candidate in the Democratic primary for the by-election. Although Davis received endorsements from previous seat holder Gus Savage and Nation of Islam leader Louis Farrakhan, Jesse Jackson was the eventual winner of the primary. In 2003, Davis sponsored legislation which was signed into law and forced insurance companies that do business in Illinois to publish all records they have on historical insuring of slaves as property through the state's Department of Insurance. This made available a wealth of genealogical information to the descendants of slaves. Illinois became the second state to implement such a law, after California. Davis and Illinois Senator Barack Obama co-sponsored a pair of successful bills in 2003. The first, House Bill 223, mandated that all police interrogations on homicide investigations be recorded. The bill was motivated by the release of thirteen suspects convicted of murder and sentenced to death who'd later been exonerated by DNA evidence. Previously interrogations could only be recorded with the suspect's permission. The second bill co-sponsored by the pair, Senate Bill 30, required police in Illinois to record the race of all people subjected to traffic stops, to provide information for efforts to eliminate racial profiling by police. In 2004, Davis sponsored a bill to limit low-income household electricity or natural gas bills to no more than six percent of the household income. In 2005, Davis led the effort to secure funding for the Student Financial Assistance Outreach Center at Chicago State University when it was threatened with closure. Negotiations with Illinois Governor Rod Blagojevich over his proposed budget for 2006 led to an agreement to fund the center in exchange for Democratic support on the budget. The center received $300,000. In 2006, Davis was re-elected to the Illinois House of Representatives' 27th district after she ran unopposed for re-election. In the 2007-2008 term, Davis served as chair of the Appropriations-General Services Committee, the vice- chair of the Elementary & Secondary Education Committee, the sub-co-chair of the Rapid Growth Districts & Special Education Issues Subcommittee and the sub-chair of the School Code Waivers, Elementary and Secondary Subcommittee.

Comments on atheism The Chicago Tribune reported on April 3, 2008 that Davis interrupted and criticized atheist activist Robert I. Sherman during his testimony before the House State Government Administration Committee in Springfield: > \\"I don't know what you have against God, but some of us don't have much > against him. We look forward to him and his blessings ... I'm trying to > understand the philosophy that you want to spread in the state of Illinois > ...

Toledo Public Schools (TPS), serves 23,324 students (2018-2019 school year) and is the fourth largest district in the state. Since 2013, TPS has experienced growth in student enrollment from 21,353 students to 23,324 for the 2018-2019 school year. The district has seen the graduation rate improve 7.5 percent since 2014. The 4-year graduation rate for students who entered the 9th grade in 2014 and graduated by 2017 was 71.4 percent. The 5-year graduation rate for students who entered the 9th grade in fall of 2013 and graduated by the summer of 2017 was 78.5 percent.

The building was finished in 1857 and the first class graduated from Central High School in 1858. In 1872, Jesup W. Scott selected a body of trustees to establish a ‚ÄúUniversity of Arts and Trades‚Äù for the city of Toledo. A donation of $15,000 by trustee William H. Raymond in 1873, followed by a donation of $50,000 by Scott‚Äôs family following his death on January 22, 1874 helped set up a school of design in the original high school by January 1875. The Manual Training School Unable to carry out the wishes of donors, the trustees tendered the property to the city of Toledo in January 1884. The Scott Manual Training School was opened and had the distinction of being one of the first such schools to offer courses in Domestic Science. The building was destroyed by a fire in March 1885, but was rebuilt as a much larger structure in 1886 with sixty-one rooms and an auditorium that was larger than the original building. Until 1913, this was the city‚Äôs only high school building except for a few years where the first two years of high school were offered at East Side Central. Students were eventually transferred over to Jesup W. Scott High School in 1913 and Morrison R. Waite High School (named for Justice Morrison Waite) in 1914 when these schools were opened. In January 1912 the Elementary Industrial School was established within the Central building with an emphasis on mechanical drawing and woodwork. When the remaining high school students left for Waite, the industrial school sought a new name. The new school was named Woodward Junior High School for Calvin M. Woodward, an advocate of manual training. When the school added four-year classes, it became Woodward Technical High School. With four high schools established by 1923 (Scott in the west end, Waite in the east side, Woodward Tech near the north, and Central Catholic near downtown), a suitable high school was necessary for the south end. Edward Drummond Libbey High School was built and named for the Libbey Glass founder and Toledo Art Museum creator who gave money for the school‚Äôs property on Western Avenue. In 1927, Vocational High School was established in the Woodward Tech building as well.http://www.classmates.com/yearbooks/Macomber-Vocational-High- School/54317?page=14 1936-37 Vocational HS yearbook Woodward Tech would move into a new building on Streicher Street in 1928 and become Calvin M. Woodward High School. Vocational High School remained in the old building until 1938 when it moved into a new location on Monroe Street and became Irving E. Macomber Vocational High School.http://www.classmates.com/yearbooks/Macomber- Vocational-High-School/75027?page=8 1937-38 Vocational HS yearbook In 1931, Thomas A. DeVilbiss High School was also built in the quickly-expanding west end and named for a local industrialist.http://www.classmates.com/yearbooks/DeVilbiss-High- School/52992?page=10 1932-33 DeVilbiss HS yearbook Harriet Whitney Vocational High School was also established in 1939 as a girls‚Äô trade school, and it would eventually become joint-operational with Macomber in 1959. In April of 1937, Woodward High School displayed a Tesla Coil formerly owned by Nikola Tesla to the public, which they had acquired for educational purposes. As Toledo continued to grow, so did its school district. Two more high schools were opened in 1962: E.L. Bowsher High School was named for a former TPS superintendent to ease crowding at Libbey, and Roy C. Start High School was named for a former Toledo mayor in order to ease crowding at DeVilbiss. When Toledo fully annexed Adams Township in 1964, TPS also acquired Robert S. Rogers High School into its system in 1966. In January 1968, the Ohio General Assembly allowed TPS to annex Spencer-Sharples School District despite it not being geographically connected to the rest of the district. In 1970, the Jefferson Center was set up in the old downtown post office as an alternative high school for students with behavioral issues. Shortly after its great rise, enrollment numbers began to drop across the district as Toledo‚Äôs population started to fall. Spencer-Sharples High School was closed in 1980. Macomber and the Jefferson Center were threatened with closure in 1989, but it wasn‚Äôt until a levy failed during the 1990-91 school year when DeVilbiss and Macomber high schools were closed. Many of Macomber‚Äôs trade classes were sent to other high schools while the Toledo Technology Academy was opened in DeVilbiss. The Jefferson Center was shut down in 2000, and Libbey was also closed in 2010. TPS was able to rebuild, renovate, and reorganize many of its school buildings in the early years of the 21st century with help from the State of Ohio. Many neighborhood grade schools were lost, but the school communities were given state-of-the-art facilities.

The nearest town is S√≥ller, which can be reached by foot via a series of Footpaths and pathways and the hamlet of Binibassi. Surrounding mountains include the Alfabia Mountains and the Els Cornadors. Catalan is the most popular local language‚Äîhowever, all residents speak Castilian Spanish as well. Fornalutx covers an area of 19.5 km¬≤ and as of 2008 had 469 inhabitants. The village The centre of Fornalutx is the Pla√ßa d'Espanya, surrounded by caf√©s and a general store. Overlooking the square (on a higher level reached by steps) is the church, which has a large clock on its fa√ßade. Just down the street is the Panaderia de Fornalutx (the local bakery), and on the road leading out of the town several restaurants. The old tower at the east side of the village is also used as the ajuntament (town hall), and just a few houses away from it is the public washing house. The latter has an open loggia at its front with a long bath of water (channelled here in open stone culverts alongside the roads coming down from the hills) and a rail above it where locals leave their clothes to be washed or to wash themselves. A street in Fornalutx The architecture of the village is of stone and red roof tiles, with most buildings' windows also having green painted wooden shutters. The stone fa√ßades on the majority of these houses have been exposed in recent years by removing the original render to give the buildings a more rustic appearance than was originally the case. Built on different levels, many of the higher streets are pedestrianised and cobbled, with grassy paths leading off into the orchards and farms to the north. The village centre is Pla√ßa d'Espanya The dominant large plants in the area are orange trees, lemon trees and cacti. Thousands of house sparrows flit around the area and sheep graze in the surrounding orchards. Higher up, there are stunning olive groves with some trees more than a thousand years old. Fornalutx has received prizes and recognition for tourism and conservation. In 1983 it was awarded the Mallorcan Tourism Board Silver Plaque for the defence and maintenance of the village. The same year the General Secretary for Tourism gave it the Second National Price for Towns embellished and maintained in Spain. In 1985 it received the Premi Alzina from the Grup Balear d'Ornitologia i Defensa de la Naturalesa. The village is well supplied with public parking, there being three generous municipal car parks. Large vehicles are discouraged from passing through the centre by a weight limit and the need to negotiate a narrow bottleneck near the square. To help with this a turning place for lorries and coaches has been provided to the north. There are a number of restaurants, bars, banks and shops. A half hour a day free wireless internet access is provided by the town council in the main square.

It occurred in the tumultuous aftermath of the Jacobite Rising of 1745. The murder inspired events in Robert Louis Stevenson's 1886 novel Kidnapped. Overview Allan Stewart (left) and the fictional David Balfour (right), from Robert Louis Stevenson's Kidnapped. On 14 May 1752, Colin Roy Campbell of Glenure, 44, the government-appointed factor to the forfeited lands of the Clan Stewart of Appin in north Argyllshire, Scotland, was shot in the back by a sniper in the wood of Lettermore near Duror. The search for the killer targeted the local clan, the Jacobite Stewarts of Appin, who had recently suffered evictions on Campbell's orders. The chief suspect, Allan Stewart (or Alan Breck Stewart) having fled, James Stewart (also known as Seumas a' Ghlinne [James of the Glen] and brother of Ardshiel), the tanist of the Stewarts, was arrested for the crime and tried for the murder. Although the trial clearly showed that James was not directly involved in the assassination (he had a solid alibi), he was found guilty \\"in airts and pairts\\" (as an accessory; an aider and abetter) by a jury consisting of people from the locality where the crime occurred. The presiding judge was pro- Hanoverian Archibald Campbell, 3rd Duke of Argyll, chief of Clan Campbell; 11 Campbell clansmen were on the 15-man jury. James Stewart was hanged on 8 November 1752 on a specially commissioned gibbet above the narrows at Ballachulish, now near the south entrance to the Ballachulish Bridge. He died protesting his innocence and sang the 35th Psalm in Scottish Gaelic before mounting the scaffold. To this day in the Highlands, it remains known as \\"The Psalm of James of the Glens.\\" Satire Ironically, Colin Roy Campbell of Glenure had actually been very well liked, even by many veteran Jacobites. Shortly before his murder, Jacobite poet and propagandist Alasdair MacMhaighstir Alasdair poked fun at Colin's loyalties in his Anti-Whig polemic An Airce. In the poem, which begins by skewering the conventions of Aisling poetry, the poet describes meeting the ghost of a beheaded Jacobite who prophesies that his Campbell clansmen will soon be punished for committing high treason against their lawful king by a repeat of the Ten Plagues of Egypt followed by a second Great Flood on their lands. The bard is instructed to emulate Noah by building an Ark for Campbells loyal to the Stuart cause. Some, however, are first to be purged of their \\"treason\\" by receiving a good, proper soaking. :Ge toil leam Cailean Glinn Iubhair :B' fhe√†rr leam gu 'm b' iubhar 's nach b' fhe√†rna; :Bho 'n a threig e n√†dur a mhuinntreach, : 'S gann a dh' fhaodar cuim thoirt d√†-san. :Cuir boiseid de ionmhas Righ Deorsa, :De smior an √≤ir mu theis-meadhon; : 'S √¨obair e 'Neptun ge searbh e, :Mur grad-ainmich e 'n righ dlighneach. :\\"Though Colin of Glenure I much esteem, :Would that he was not alder but true yew; :Since he forsook the allegiance of his sires, :To be reprieved is not his due. :\\"A girdle of the treasure of King George :Of finest gold around his middle fling, :And to the sea-king offer him, though hard, :Unless at once he name the rightful King\\". Recent scholarship In 2001, Anda Penman, an 89-year-old descendant of the Clan Chiefs of the Stewarts of Appin, revealed what she alleged to be a long-held family secret. She said the murder was planned by four young Stewart tacksmen without the sanction of James of the Glens. There was a shooting contest among them and the assassination was committed by the best marksman among the four, Donald Stewart of Ballachulish. According to other stories, Donald desperately wanted to turn himself in rather than allow James to hang and had to be physically held down to prevent this. Several years after James's execution, when the body was finally delivered to the Stewart Clan for burial, Donald Stewart of Ballachulish was responsible for washing the bones before the funeral. Lee Holcombe, PhD, has written the most thorough examination of the Appin Murder published to date. She concluded, based on substantial evidence, that James of the Glens was indeed guilty of ordering the murder of Colin Campbell. She also reported the information that Donald Stewart, rather than Allan Breck Stewart, was probably the actual shooter. In Walking With Murder: On The Kidnapped Trail (2005), Ian Nimmo has addressed the mystery of who shot Colin Campbell, applying modern police methods to the documents in the case, including two post-mortem reports. According to Nimmo, Alan Stewart did not pull the trigger, and the secret of who did has been handed down through the Stewart family for 250 years. Nimmo does not choose to reveal it, stating that \\"it is not mine to give away\\". In 2008 Glasgow lawyer John Macaulay asked the Scottish Criminal Cases Review Commission to reconsider the case on the grounds his study of the trial transcripts shows there was \\"not a shred of evidence\\" against Stewart. This was rejected.Commission rules against 18th century murder review, The Journal of the Law Society of Scotland 9 December 2008 Notes References  * (backup site (page 5)) Further reading See also *William Grant, Lord Prestongrange the chief prosecutor. *Keppoch murders External links Lyrics to \\"The Red Fox\\" (Big Country song about the murder) (Archived 25 October 2009) 1752 in Scotland History of the Scottish Highlands Lochaber Murder in Scotland Political scandals in Scotland Unsolved murders in Scotland ","title":"Appin Murder"},{"id":"6484410","text":"Foreign U-Boats was the title for a special section created by Nazi Germany's Kriegsmarine that adopted 13 captured enemy submarines and a single Turkish vessel into the U-Boat corps.

Jim Cheese, the owner of a troupe of performing dogs, and his coster sweetheart, Liza Shoddam, have walked from London to attend the local fair. They are at first mistaken by Boodel's party for two more guests for the fancy dress party. Jim and Liza are in debt to the landlord of the inn, who threatens to turn them out or have them arrested. The real heir to the Hole property is Dick Wargrave, a friend of Boodel's. He has eloped from Paris with a schoolgirl, Elphin Haye, who is an American heiress masquerading as a penniless orphan. They arrive at the inn, preceded by four people who are in pursuit of them. A. Bunker Bliss is after Dick for eloping with his niece, and, being a good republican, Bliss is not impressed by Dick's earldom. Mrs. Shimmering Black is after Dick because the Earl of Hole has jilted her daughter (in fact it is Boodel who has done so). Mr. Talk and Mr. Downham are both lawyers; the first is English and the second American. They are both in search of the missing heir and after the reward for finding him. Dick is unaware that these two are bearing him good news, and when he learns from the landlord that some strangers have been asking about him, he concludes that there is trouble brewing. Guests at the Hall Dick persuades Jim Cheese to exchange identities with him, taking his name and even his girlfriend, and entrusting Elphin to Jim's care. The American lawyer finds Jim and tells him that he is an earl, and advances him money on the strength of his title. Elphir runs across a friend, Daisy Fallowfield, at the inn, and the whole party go off to the ball, where Elphir has to introduce Jim to her aunt, Miss Virginia Bliss, as her fianc√©. ;Act II All the characters turn up at the ball at Hole Hall. Boodel brings Dick and passes him off as another guest. Liza slips in after Jim, who is announced as the Earl of Hole. The four pursuers gatecrash the party. Jim has a rough time with Bunker Bliss and Mrs. Black when they find him ‚Äì the former is intent on shooting him, and the latter, a circus strongwoman, is a terrifying prospect ‚Äì but when he tells them the truth about who is who, everyone is satisfied. Mrs Black's wrath subsides when she realises that the man who jilted her daughter is not, in fact, an earl, Bunker Bliss is appeased, and all ends happily.

The residents are divided over three settlement areas, the principal one being Santa Margalida, 10 km inland from the coast. The other areas are primarily Tourist resorts, Can Picafort and Son Serra de Marina on the coast at the bay of Alc√∫dia. The non- national population stands at 23.6% (2,413).  Geography  Geographical location  The municipality of Santa Margalida lies about 45 Kilometres from the islands capital Palma. It is part of the region (Comarca) Pl√† de Mallorca or Es Pl√†, the great central plain of the island. The municipality is one of the flattest on Majorca at very little more than 100 metres above sea level. The area is drained by a few streams which flow towards the sea in the north east. In the north west, Santa Margalida is bordered by a fresh water swamp. Along the north eastern coast there are obelisks at regular intervals of 1,250m. These, along with corresponding twin towers 200 metres inland, were used in the 19th century as navigational points of reference for seafarers.  Neighbouring municipalities  In the north west Santa Margalida is bordered by Muro and Llub√≠. Both of which, belong to Es Pl√†, along with Maria de la Salut, Ariany and Petra to the south. In the east the Torrent de na Borges- the longest stream in Mallorca- forms the border to Art√† in the Llevant region.  Community arrangement  The municipality of Santa Margalida has three towns. The population figures follow date from 1 January 2005 and don't include the population outside these settlements, hence the sum of the figures does not add up to the total population of the municipality (Source: INE). * Can Picafort (5,685 Inhabitants) * Santa Margalida (3,195 Inhabitants) * Son Serra de Marina (535 Inhabitants) = Santa Margalida = There is a long tradition of agriculture and handicrafts in the region. The historically proven founding of a municipality took place soon after the Reconquista. Old inscriptions and tombstones bear witness though of the place being inhabited already in Roman times, then called Hero. Later, during the Arab reign, the great estate of Abenmaaxbar was located here. The location itself and St. Margalida are the topics of many myths and tales which eventually the municipalities namesake. Testament to the wealth is the large parish church of Santa Margalida, this was built in 1232 and renovated in the 17th or 18th century. From the church there is a good view over the countryside. The inside the church is well fitted out. = Can Picafort = Can Picafort (or Ca'n Picafort) is a tourist resort on the Bay of Alc√∫dia. Between the Port d'Alcudia in the north of the bay and Can Picafort, there is a five kilometre long sandy beach lined with hotels. The protected Albufera swamp borders about 2 kilometers of the bay and prevents the two tourist resorts from joining. The 8 square kilometre wilderness is a good alternative to the tourist resorts and can be explored by renting bikes. Can Picafort is well set up for tourism and the beach's promenade offers many Bars and Restaurants. One can shop by day and stroll the pedestrian area in the evening. Can Picafort isn't just popular during peak season. Off-peak is however considerably quieter and many of the businesses close. Already in the 1990s the population here exceeded that of the main town Santa Margalida and the town has become an important residence. Major items of infrastructure can also be found here. From the neighbourhood of Son Baul√≥ one can reach the necropoles of Son Real, and situated on a nearby island, S'Illa d'en Porros. Both are the remains of the Talaiot culture from the early history of Majorca. From there a shore hiking path leads to Son Serra de Marina. Water Sports  The Bay of Alcudia offers some of the best sailing conditions in the Mediterranean. With the exception of just a handful of days along the season, the wind caused by the sun heating the earth's surface in the interior of the Island is a stable ten to fifteen knots onshore push that delivers small waves and just the right amount of freshness. This wind starts around 10 am and goes strong until right after 5 pm. When storms from the North hit the bay, the most experienced sailors can fight the elements in the relative safety of the Bay, but waves can reach up to twelve feet high. Motor sport  In Can Picafort there is one of the largest cart racing tracks in Majorca. After a restructuring in 2004 the track features a length of 1325m in total. It is divided into two courses, with 725m acting as a professional race course and 825m for cart rentals. Every year an international 24 hour race takes places alongside several national races. = Son Serra de Marina = This tourist resort 6 kilometers south of Can Picafort extends for about 1,400 meters along the Bay of Alc√∫dia. It is built exclusively of two-storied houses, most of which have been constructed as secondary residences for locals. Streetlife there is accordingly quiet. Only during the holiday seasons will the owners come here from Palma or the mainland. In contrast to Can Picafort mass tourism has not yet reached this place. Son Serra de Marina features a small marina on its western beach. In the east the town is limited by the Torrent de na Borges. The beach there is a resort for wind and kite surfers. The town has three moderately frequented beaches. The local one west of the Torrent de na Borges, approximately 450 meters long and 130 meters wide, is mostly visited by local residents. East of the town lies the 1,800 meter-long beach of Sa Canova, which belongs to the Art√† municipality and almost extends to Colonia de Sant Pere's neighbourhood of S'Estanyol. To the west, slightly offside the settlement is the beach of Son Real. A hiking trail along the coast leads to Can Picafort.

The village is surrounded by high mountains covered in pine and evergreen oak woodland and olive, almond and carob tree groves as well as tidily cultivated fields. The views of the mountains are stunning with the Puig de Galatz√≥ being the highlight. Around the village stand large expensive majestic country houses. Traditionally these grand estates were the nucleus of village life. Until the middle of the twentieth century, agriculture and cattle raising were the two main occupations within the area but now many inhabitants commute for 20 minutes into Palma. The valley of Puigpunyent was one of the first inhabited areas on the island. This is clearly visible through the amount of talaiots that can be found in the area. Examples can be seen in Son Serralta, Son Burguet and Son Puig, plus the necropolis of Casat Nou. These early inhabitants also left proof of their productive cattle breeding and agriculture. The Romans too inhabited the area and the little that is left of their presence can be found at Es Collet and in the consolidation of the olive, cereal and wine production. During the Moorish period the village belonged to juz¬¥d¬¥Al-Ahw√¢z. They left behind their knowledge of the use of irrigation. The six water mills, the numerous water canals, fountains, channels for the torrents, ponds and reservoirs are good examples of their work and development of the horticulture. Found at the Es Ratxo. After reclaiming the island, and having divided the land as explained in the Llibre del Repartiment (1232), the Catalans arrived under the leadership of the Bishop of Barcelona, Berenguer de Palou, who was given the village of Puigpunyent. For this reason, and until only a few years ago, all the possessions in the village had a hut for the diezmo (a tax that every inhabitant had to pay the Church and represented 10% of their production). The church of Puigpunyent was one of the first to be built in Mallorca, and was authorised by Pope Innocence III, in 1237. During this period the cultivation of olive trees and vineyards increased. The name of Puigpunyent appears for the first time in a document written in Latin in 1248 as Podio Pugenti. It comes from Puig Punyent or pointed peak, after the shape of the Galatz√≥ Mountain. Today, Puigpunyent, with an extension of 42.3 Km2, a population of 3.710 inhabitants and a population density of 89.1 hab/km2, is a small municipality located in the west side of the Tramuntana mountain range. In a wide and green valley surrounded by high mountains the most notable of which are Na F√°tima, Na Bau√ßana, Els Puntals, Es Piconar and, of course, the Puig de Galatz√≥, with its 1025 metres. These mountains separate us from Calvi√† on the Migjorn side, from Banyalbufar and Estellencs on the west and from Esporles to the north. Palma is only a ten-minute drive by car and is connected to Puigpunyent through the only existing gap in the valley that follows the course of the river Sa Riera. Most of the population that makes up the municipality of Puigpunyent and its surrounding area is in the village of Galilea which is found at an elevation of 550 metres above sea level and is only four kilometres from Puigpunyent. Galilea is a magical place of great beauty that was once predominantly an agricultural centre and is now mainly residential. With a population of around 200 inhabitants, it has medieval origins and fabulous views over the migjorn side and the sea. Today, the municipality can be characterised as a dormitory municipality as most of the population work either in Palma or the coast side, reducing the economical activity to the basic necessities of the inhabitants.  Archaeology  A 3,200-year-old well-preserved Bronze Age sword was discovered by archaeologists under the leadership of Jaume Deya and Pablo Galera on the Mallorca Island in the Puigpunyent from the stone megaliths site called Talaiot. Specialists assumed that the weapon was made when the Talaiotic culture was in critical comedown. The sword will be on display at the nearby Majorca Museum.

The song was written by John Phillips, and featured Cass Elliot as the primary vocalist. It was released as a single in November 1966 (backed with a cover of Martha and the Vandellas's \\"Dancing in the Street\\"). Given the disappointing chart placement of the prior single, Look Through My Window, hopes were high that Words of Love would return the group to the upper reaches of the charts: on the week of January 21, 1967, the single fulfilled this hope, as it reached No. 5 in the United States. Overseas, it peaked at No. 47 in the United Kingdom. The mono single, while approximately the same running time as the stereo version, contains a horn section overdub not heard in the stereo mix, extra backing vocals, and a more prominent piano; Elliot's vocals fade out a bit sooner near the end. The B-Side, \\"Dancing in the Street\\", is a cover of the Martha and the Vandellas smash from 1964. The Mamas & the Papas used the song in their live performances, and this flip side garnered enough airplay on its own accord to reach #73 on the Billboard Pop Chart. Later uses In 1971, Mama Cass featured \\"Words of Love\\" as the B-side of one of her UK single releases, \\"One Way Ticket.\\" This inclusion provided \\"Words of Love\\" with additional exposure in Britain, given its relatively tepid chart showing five years earlier.

As a child, her desire had been to become a Carmelite nun, though this desire never materialized; she instead focused herself on serving the poor wherever and whenever she could. Her order was founded with the intention of serving the poor and supporting the Sodalities of the Immaculate Conception that were started by Father Chaminade and supported by Venerable Marie-Th√©r√®se Charlotte de Lamourous as missionaries of Mary thus combining certain aspects of the Carmelite charism with this impulse to balance the aspirations of the two co-founders. Her cause for beatification opened in the mid-1960s. On June 5, 1986, Pope John Paul II confirmed her heroic virtue and titled her as Venerable; Pope Francis approved her beatification in May 2017 (confirming a miracle attributed to her) and she was beatified in Agen on June 10, 2018, the anniversary of her birth. Life Childhood and refuge Ad√®le de Batz de Trenquell√©on was born on June 10, 1789 in the Ch√¢teau de Trenquell√©on in Feugarolles to the Baron Charles de Trenquell√©on (1754 ‚Äì June 18, 1815) and Marie-Ursule de Peyronnencq de Saint- Chamarand (1763‚Äì1846). Her baptism was celebrated just hours after her birth in the local parish church. On her maternal side she was related to Saint Louis IX and Robert of Clermont. In 1791, during the initial stages of the French Revolution, her lieutenant father led his armed forces as part of the Prince of Cond√©'s attempt to rescue King Louis XVI. After the attack failed, her father fled to England for refuge in November 1791. On January 26, 1792 her brother Charles Polycarp was born. On September 27, 1797, her mother was granted permission to go into exile in Spain along with her children. The following spring the Baroness and her children (along with other refugees from France) were expelled from Spain at the request of the French government and took refuge instead in neighboring Portugal. It was there that the Baron was able to rejoin his wife and children not long after this in July 1798. In 1789, France allowed expelled refugees to return to Spain, and on September 8, 1800, the Feast of the Nativity of Mary, Adele and her family settled in San Sebasti√°n. It was there that she made her First Communion on January 6, 1801 in the church of Santa Mar√≠a. On November 14, 1801, her family received permission to return to their family chateau in France. On June 12, 1799, her sister D√©sir√©e was born. On February 6, 1803 she received her Confirmation from the Bishop of Agen. It was in San Sebastian that Adele came to know the Carmelite nuns, who inspired her to consider answering a call to religious life. Not long after their return to France, in January, 1802, Adele told her parents of her desire to become a Carmelinte nun. However, due to her young age, her mother persuaded her to wait before entering the convent. In the meantime, Adele asked her older brother's tutor, Monsieur Ducourneau, to write a Rule of Life for her in order to prepare her for life in an enclosed religious order. On August 5, 1803, she and some friends formed a spiritual union called the \\"Little Society,\\" which had as its goal to create a network of women who would support each other in their faith. As this association grew, Adele began writing to all its members from her home in the Chateau de Tranquelleon. This association grew rapidly and by 1808, its members numbered some 60 people, mostly young women from the countryside, as well as a few priests. At this time, Adele began visiting the sick and inviting poor children from the country to her home to teach them about the fundamentals of the Christian faith. Collaborating with Chaminade In 1808 her mother visited a friend who worked at a hospital in Figeac. While telling this friend in the hospital waiting room about her daughter's group another man (Hyacinthe Lafon) in the waiting area overheard their conversation and told the Baroness that the association's goals and purposes sounded similar to another group he belonged to in Bordeaux that Blessed William Joseph Chaminade founded. Lafon suggested that her daughter and Chaminade begin corresponding. The Baroness bought the group to her daughter's attention and she and Chaminade begin corresponding at once. He soon sent some information about his group to her and circa 1809 the association had re-shaped itself in accordance with the organization and spirit of Chaminade's movement. In 1809 the government authorities ceased Chaminade's good work though her quick thinking and social position saw her association being able to continue its goals. On 20 November 1808 she chose to reject an offer of marriage that had been made to her which later turned into a choice to renounce marriage forever. Despite suffering from a severe illness in 1810 she resumed her work of care for the sick and the education of the poor as well as her correspondence with the members of the association. But soon she began to dream about founding a religious order composed of some of the women of the association that would be engaged in the care of the poor. Chaminade saw a parallel to developments in his own foundations and invited her to join him. However she would have to wait to fulfill her dream for she had to nurse her father through a critical illness and not to mention because of the persisting government restrictions on religious organizations nationwide. The fall of Napoleon Bonaparte in 1814 saw the birth of a new freedom from the restrictions imposed on religious organizations during his rule. De Trenquell√©on saw the chance had come to realize her dream and sought the required permissions ‚Äì both civil and ecclesiastical ‚Äì to establish the women of her new order as such and based in her castle. De Trenquell√©on sought Chaminade's guidance and support in this and what he proposed to her was that the order she envisioned take on the character of a mission movement. Soon after she and her companions made a private vow to remain chaste and began to wear a silver ring as an indication of this fact. The canonical establishment of the new congregation was put off due to Chaminade's desire for the group to develop its sense of its mission and path. But Napoleon's return to power in March 1815 suspended all moves and soon after Chaminade was arrested and transferred to central France where he was forbidden to have contact with the various religious groups that he was leading. But that fall Napoleon been removed from power and Chaminade was freed. The death of the Baron and the change in civil law left her free to embark on her desired path while Chaminade saw the time as being opportune and authorized her to rent part of an ancient convent in the local capital of Agen. This was done in 1816 at which point she renounced her inheritance in favor of her brother on that 17 April. Her final farewell to her mother and siblings was on 24 May 1816. Foundress In 1816 the members of her group and Chaminade's group's female members formed a religious congregation known as the Marianist Sisters that sought to combine an impulse for mission work with the contemplative nature of the Carmelites which she had once aspired to join. The local bishop had suspended permission for the women to take religious vows over the issue of the enclosure which was required with this step; the women were allowed to wear a religious habit during the Octave of Christmas alone and at no other stage until such permission could be granted on a formal level. On 25 July 1817 the local bishop permitted the women to take their vows ‚Äì albeit in private ‚Äì in the confessional so as to keep it a secret. Chaminade accepted their vows on an individual level in this manner. In 1824 the French government authorized the existence of this religious congregations. The religious also corresponded on a frequent basis with her close friend Saint √âmilie de Rodat since 21 June 1819. On 7 October 1820 she admitted her cousin Elizabeth de Casteras to the novitiate. Illness and death In 1825 she had become so ill that Chaminade had to plead with her to restrict her service. Nevertheless, she continued her correspondence with the sisters though more so with the local superiors and the novices. In 1826 she suffered stomach problems and her health worsened. On 29 January 1827 her situation was said to have worsened even more. On 27 October 1827 she composed her last will. The nun spent her final months working for the legal recognition of the congregation. De Trenquell√©on died in Agen in 1828 and was buried at the convent; her final words were: \\"Hosanna to the Son of David!\\" Beatification The beatification process opened in an informative process that spanned from 5 February 1965 until its closure on 21 March 1966 and this process was conducted in the Diocese of Agen; her spiritual writings and letters received theological approval on 10 July 1970 before the Positio dossier was submitted to the Congregation for the Causes of Saints in Rome in 1974. The historical commission first assessed and approved the dossier on 5 November 1975 prior to the approval of the C.C.S. members and their consultants on 5 May 1977. The formal introduction to the cause came under Pope Paul VI on 12 November 1976 in which her conferred title of Servant of God was legitimized. The C.C.S. approved this cause on 11 June 1977. But new rules to the sainthood process in 1983 saw the cause experience a slight setback that warranted additional investigations. Theologians approved the cause on 28 January 1986 while the C.C.S. re-examined the cause on 22 April 1986. De Trenquell√©on was named as Venerable on 5 June 1986 after Pope John Paul II confirmed that the late religious had lived a model life of heroic virtue. Her beatification depended upon a miraculous healing that medicine and science could not explain. One such case was discovered in the Italian diocese of Novara and a diocesan tribunal investigated this case from November 2013 until 12 June 2014. The documents from that process were sent to Rome in sealed boxes and the C.C.S. validated this investigation not long after on 5 December 2014. Medical experts examined and approved this miracle on 12 May 2016 as well as theologians on 19 January 2017 and the C.C.S. on 2 May 2017. Pope Francis ‚Äì on 4 May 2017 ‚Äì signed a decree that confirmed the healing was a miracle and thus approved her beatification. The beatification took place on 10 June 2018 in Agen. The current postulator for this cause is Fr. Antonio Gasc√≥n Aranda.

The type species, D. forbesi, from England, Bohemia, and Sweden, was discovered and described by the French paleontologist, Joachim Barrande in 1850. Description The glabella was inflated, and globular- shaped, and covered in small wart-like bumps. If it was filled with fat, or oil, the glabellum would have helped to have made the creature positively buoyant. On the other hand, trilobites with large glabellae are often suspected of being predatory, as the volume of glabella would be filled with digestive organs, or used to store captured/swallowed prey. The free cheeks of the cephalon formed a pair of long, curved spines, and the segments of the pleural lobes were separated and elongated to form rib-like struts. These modifications, along with the \\"V\\" shaped pygidium give these trilobites a cartoon \\"fish-skeleton\\" appearance. The defensive value of these highly elongate spines is also apparent, as they would have stuck in the throats of vertebrate predators, such as the Silurian acanthodian Nostolepis. Each species differed from each other in the sizes of their glabella, as well as the size and curves of the pygidium and free cheek spines. Cheirurids had the ability to enroll to protect their softer ventral area, and the spines would have thrust upward and outward. In all adult specimens of the genus, the body has up to nine segments, not including the cephalon or pygidium (which is formed from at least two fused and reduced segments). Ecology Because some of the other highly derived cheirurid trilobites, such as the Devonian Crotalocephalus and Cybelloides of the Ordovician, have been interpreted as being swimmers or plankters, the species of Deiphon have been popularly thought of as being planktonic, as well. Mostly, it is due to the idea that its globular glabellum was filled with fat or oil, thus, serving as a balloon to keep it in the water column, and its elongated pleural lobes serving to keep it from sinking. If it were a nektonic or planktonic trilobite, the spherical glabellum, coupled with its rib cage-like pleural lobes and spine- like cephalon cheeks would have presented serious impediments to its hydrodynamic ability, and would have been either a drifter, or a very leisurely swimmer, feeding on phytoplankton, or slow-moving zooplankton. On the other hand, because of Deiphon's questionable hydrodynamics, and relatively tiny eyes (as opposed to the tremendous eyes normally found on other swimming or planktonic trilobites), some think of it as being a benthic predator that scurried on top of the substrate in search of prey, only swimming when necessary (such as evading larger predators). It may have even used its enormous glabellum to store subdued prey for later digestion. References *Burns, Jasper. Trilobites: Common Trilobites of North America (A NatureGuide book).

A tramway links the inland town of S√≥ller to Port de S√≥ller, running along the beach-side road. Overview Port de S√≥ller marina The resort consists of shops, restaurants and bars but is quiet and away from the major tourist areas such as Magaluf on the south of the island. There are a few large holiday hotels such as Hotel Eden, Hotel Esplendido and Aimia Hotel, located on the road that runs around the bay. Two lighthouses sit on the headlands on either side of the bay, La Badia de S√≥ller. Development on the east headland has been prevented by the area being used as a training ground by the Spanish Army. The beach sand was replaced for the summer of 2009 because, whilst clean, it had become rather muddy and inhospitable. The bay and the estuary of the river which comes to an end here attract little egrets, Muscovy ducks, huge flocks of herring gulls, greylag geese and mallard ducks. The diversity of breeds in the duck and geese population suggests that most of the original birds had escaped from captivity.

Because the presence of cysts is neither an early nor a typical diagnostic feature of the disease, and because at least 4 different gene mutations may give rise to the condition, the name autosomal dominant tubulointerstitial kidney disease (ADTKD) has been proposed, to be appended with the underlying genetic variant for a particular individual. Importantly, if cysts are found in the medullary collecting ducts they can result in a shrunken kidney, unlike that of polycystic kidney disease. There are two known forms of medullary cystic kidney disease, mucin-1 kidney disease 1 (MKD1) and mucin-2 kidney disease/uromodulin kidney disease (MKD2). A third form of the disease occurs due to mutations in the gene encoding renin (ADTKD-REN), and has formerly been known as familial juvenile hyperuricemic nephropathy type 2. Signs and symptoms In terms of the signs/symptoms of medullary cystic kidney disease, the disease is not easy to diagnose and is uncommon. In this condition, loss of kidney function occurs slowly over time, however the following signs/symptoms could be observed in an affected individual: Some individuals with this disease develop gout, which is a condition in which patients develop severe pain and swelling in the big toe or another joint such as the knee. If untreated, it becomes chronic and affects the joints most of the time, instead of intermittently. Cause Proximal convoluted tubule Normal individuals have two copies of the MUC1 and UMOD genes. The genes produce the protein mucin-1 and uromodulin, respectively. These proteins are expressed only in certain cells in the kidney ‚Äì the thick ascending limb of Henle and distal convoluted tubule ‚Äì both parts of the kidney tubule. The protein coats the surface of the tubule and protects the tubule. In MKD, individuals have one normal and one abnormal MUC1 gene. In uromodulin kidney disease (UKD), individuals have one normal and one abnormal UMOD gene. The abnormal (mutated) gene produces a misfolded protein product that deposits within cells of the renal tubules (in a part of the cell called the endoplasmic reticulum). The abnormal protein builds up in the cell and causes it slowly to die, leading to an ultimate loss of the kidney's function manifesting as a disease state. MKD1/Mucin-1 kidney disease 1\\\\.

Peritubular capillaries, 10. Arcuate vein, 11. Arcuate artery, 12. Afferent arteriole, 13. Juxtaglomerular apparatus. Mucin-1 kidney disease (MKD) is due to a mutation within the MUC1 gene, which is located on chromosome 1. The mucin-1 protein is involved in the creation of a mucus-like substance that coats the surface of different small tubules in the body, it is expressed on distal tubular cells in the kidney. Mucin-1 kidney disease (MKD) is caused by a mutation in the MUC1 gene. This mutation alters the genetic sequence in the MUC1 gene, resulting in a new, mutated protein, furthermore, The disease is extremely rare and its prevalence is unknown. This disease is autosomal dominant, meaning that it is characterized by a 50% chance of inheritance and slowly progressive chronic kidney disease that leads to the need for dialysis or a kidney transplant. People with a mutation in this gene can have a variable rate of loss of kidney function, with some individuals going on dialysis in their thirties while others may not go on dialysis until later in life.update 2013 Earlier on the condition was called medullary cystic kidney disease type 1. It was named this because some people with the disease had cysts (small holes) in the middle (medulla) of their kidneys. It has since then been found that these cysts are uncommon and are not found in the majority of the patients with MUC1 mutations. For this reason, this name has been abandoned, scientists (part of the Kidney Dialysis Initiatives and Global Outcomes group) specializing in this disease came together formally and created an official name for this and similar conditions. This condition was designated as Autosomal Dominant Tubulointerstitial Kidney Disease (ADTKD). In autosomal dominant inheritance only one parent need be affected to pass down the disorder. Tubulointerstitial is used because the problems that occur in this disease result as a consequence of atrophy, of tubules, of the loop of Henle and fibrosis of the medullary interstitium. MKD2/Uromodulin kidney disease Chromosome 16 Medullary cystic kidney disease type 2 is due to mutations in a gene named UMOD on chromosome 16 that encodes a protein called uromodulin This disease is also autosomal dominant, meaning that it is characterized by a 50% chance of inheritance and slowly progressive chronic kidney disease that leads to the need for dialysis or a kidney transplant. People with this disease suffer from gout relatively early in life. Mutations in this gene can lead to a variable rate of loss of kidney function. In MKD2 inheritance, just as MKD1, autosomal dominant indicates that 50% of children of an affected person will inherit the disease. \\"Tubulointerstitial\\" is used because the problems that occur in this disease happen in the compartment of the kidney known as the tubulointerstitium, a shorter name of the disease is used by most individuals - uromodulin kidney disease (UKD).update 2013 Diagnosis Kidney biopsy/micrograph The diagnosis of medullary cystic kidney disease can be done via a physical exam. Further tests/exams are as follows: * A routine blood test called the serum creatinine can be done. Creatinine is a breakdown product from the muscle, as kidney function declines, the amount of blood creatinine goes up. Thus, most affected individuals have no symptoms of MCKD, but find that they have the condition due to an elevation in the blood creatinine level. * Affected individuals also have an elevation in the blood uric acid level. In MCKD, the kidney has difficulty getting rid of uric acid. One can find out that the uric acid level in the blood is high when a blood test is done. Gout is caused by high uric acid levels, and thus patients often have gout. * A kidney ultrasound in this condition usually shows normal or small sized kidneys (occasionally cysts are present). However, since cysts are present in many normal individuals, these cysts are not helpful in making a diagnosis, therefore a kidney biopsy can be done to determine if the individual has this disease. Kidney biopsy is a procedure where a needle is inserted into the kidney and removes a small piece of kidney tissue. This tissue is then examined under a microscope. * Definitive testing and diagnosis of MCKD can be made by analyzing the UMOD gene for mutations, this can be done by a blood test. Treatment In terms of treatment/management for medullary cystic kidney disease, at present there are no specific therapies for this disease, and there are no specific diets known to slow progression of the disease. However, management for the symptoms can be dealt with as follows: erythropoietin is used to treat anemia, and growth hormone is used when growth becomes an issue. Additionally, a kidney transplant may be needed at some point. Finally, foods that contain potassium and phosphate must be reduced. Research Scientists from the Broad Institute, Cambridge, Massachusetts identified the genetic cause of UKD as mutations in the MUC1 gene.

The company provides integrated data and software.Screening for Winners by Rex Moore, The Motley Fool, December 8, 2003. For fiscal year 2019, FactSet's total ASV and professional services revenues were $1.48 billion. FactSet provides client support & learning, implementation services, business advisory, data delivery, index services, portfolio data management, and transition services. FactSet's competitors include Bloomberg L.P., Thomson Reuters, and S&P; Global. History 1977‚Äì1980 FactSet was founded by Howard Wille and Chuck Snyder in 1978. Their partnership began in 1977 when the two were working on Wall Street at Faulkner, Dawkins & Sullivan. As computers became more prominent at the end of the 1970s, Wille and Snyder thought that the industry was changing. When Shearson purchased Faulkner, Dawkins and Sullivan and the company started to expand, Wille and Snyder decided to set out on their own and test their idea for a company that could deliver computer-based financial information. At the time, companies had to purchase raw data directly from a vendor such as Compustat, then hire programmers to make the data user-friendly. Wille and Snyder's vision would offer usable data directly to the client. Originally, all data was delivered to clients on paper, often by bike messenger. The first and namesake product was a program called \\"Company FactSet,\\" which produced a four-page company analysis report using the Value Line database. Today, FactSet users connect to FactSet's private network via WAN, Internet, and wireless devices. 1981‚Äì1989 In the early 1980s, FactSet employees numbered fewer than 10. In 1981, Snyder found a way to download data from the FactSet computer into Visicalc, meaning that clients could retrieve data from a database directly into a spreadsheet. For the first time, several steps in the process were eliminated, making the data download process dramatically quicker. In 1984, FactSet added limited screening capabilities, which were expanded in 1988 with the introduction of Universal Screening, which allowed users to stipulate their own screening criteria. Another development during the 1980s was the 1989 release of the company's Private Database Service. Users could now store proprietary data and integrate it with their own information to perform custom analysis. Current Chairman Philip A. Hadley joined the company as a consultant in 1985. 1990‚Äì2000 FactSet for Windows was released in 1990. That same year, company headquarters moved from New York City to Greenwich, CT. A London office opened in 1993, the first in Europe. The first Asia-Pacific office opened in Tokyo in 1995. By the end of 1995 FactSet had fewer than 400 customers, but they included 84 of the United States' top investment managers. The company also changed its name in June 1995, becoming FactSet Research Systems Inc. in preparation for becoming a public company. The company began trading on the New York Stock Exchange in 1996 under the symbol FDS. In 1997 the company released Portfolio Management Workstation, which was followed a year later by the Economic Analysis and Company Explorer applications. The product became easier to use in 1998 with the release of the DIRECTIONS interface and the addition of Online Assistant, a web-based help and reference tool. FactSet introduced 24-hour live telephone support in 1999. Wille retired as CEO and chairman in May 2000, Snyder stepped in as CEO on an interim basis, serving until September of that year, when Hadley was named the new CEO and chairman. 2000‚Äì2009 New products in the early 2000s included a portfolio returns product, SPAR (Style, Performance and Risk), that allowed portfolio managers to analyze the risks and performance of their own funds as well as compare them with peer funds; the Data Central application, which allowed subscribers to create and save their own time-series databases; and Marquee, which combined real-time news and stock quotes with security-level analysis. In 2004, the company's sell-side platform, IBCentral, was released. Also in 2004, the company relocated headquarters and consolidated its three Connecticut offices to Norwalk, CT. Sales topped the $200 million mark for the first time in 2002 and $500 million in 2008. In 2008, FactSet acquired a copy of the Thomson Reuters WorldScope database, which it develops and markets as FactSet Fundamentals. 2009‚Äì2015 In 2009, FactSet combined its DIRECTIONS, Marquee, and IBCentral platforms into one product, called FactSet. The platform combined the features of the previous platforms with new shared online workspaces and faster analytics. Also in 2009, FactSet integrated Data Explorers short selling data on the Factset Research Systems analytics platform. In January 2010, FactSet and FirstRain announced a partnership that would allow FactSet clients to access FirstRain's web research engine that finds, filters, and analyzes unstructured business data available online. In June 2008, FactSet completed the acquisition of the Thomson Fundamentals database. In June 2010, FactSet acquired Market Metrics, a market research firm situated in the United States that is solely focused on surveys conducted on advisor and insurance products. Highlights of 2011 include the addition of a package for colleges and universities in January, the integration of Proquote trading functionality in April, and the addition of Trucost environmental research data in August.

He was also a keyboardist with the Band during the 1990s. Early life and career Richard Bell was the son of the Canadian composer and musician Dr. Leslie Bell. Richard started playing the piano at the age of four and studied music at Canada's Royal Conservatory of Music.AP via the Arizona Republic, \\"Former Joplin bandmate dies of cancer\\" June 19, 2007 After a short stint in The Mid- Knights, Bell's career first gained significance when he joined Ronnie Hawkins as a member of the group And Many Others, following the departure of Hawkins's previous band (who would gain fame as the Band). Hawkins fired the entire band in early 1970, and they renamed themselves Crowbar, subsequently recording Official Music (as King Biscuit Boy with Crowbar) (1970, Daffodil; 1996, Stony Plain). Bell left Crowbar shortly after this to join Janis Joplin's Full Tilt Boogie Band, making good on an offer made the previous year by her manager.Rockingham, Graham, \\"Richard Bell, an original Hamilton rocker, dead at 61\\" Hamilton Spectator, 18 June 2007 Janis Joplin In the late 1960s, while touring with Hawkins at the Fillmore East, Bell was approached by Michael Friedman, an associate of Joplin's manager, Albert Grossman, and invited to join her new ensemble. His playing can be heard on her posthumously released album Pearl and many bootleg recordings from her 1970 tour, including performances from the Festival Express \\"train tour\\" of Canada. Bell was interviewed many years later for the 2003 documentary film of the same name. Session work Following Joplin's death, Bell moved to Woodstock, New York, where he worked as a session musician. Among those he worked with during this time were Paul Butterfield, Karen Dalton and John Sebastian. Other acts Bell worked with include Blackie and the Rodeo Kings, Bruce Cockburn, Judy Collins, the Fridge Magnets, Cowboy Junkies, Bob Dylan, Michael Kaeshammer, Bonnie Raitt and Joe Walsh. The Band Bell moved to Atlanta, Georgia, in 1979 and played with various bands, including Pyro, with Jim Weider and Rick Pierce. He did session work also. He married Mary Deacon in 1979. He played with the Convertibles, with bandmates Scott Boyer and Tommy Talton (Cowboy), Topper Price, Brian Wheeler (Locust Fork) and Rick Kurtz (Delbert McClinton), among others, before returning to Canada and the Band. In 1991, Bell joined the reconstituted lineup of the Band as a keyboardist, replacing Stan Szelest (himself a replacement for original pianist, Richard Manuel, who committed suicide in 1986). Bell remained with the Band through their final three albums (Jericho, High on the Hog, and Jubilation). He was credited as a co-writer of \\"The Caves of Jericho\\", from the album Jericho. The death of Rick Danko in 1999 essentially ended the association known as the Band. Later years In later years, Bell performed as keyboard player with Canadian roots-rock performers such as Colin Linden, Blackie and the Rodeo Kings, Paul Reddick and Kathleen Edwards. At the time of his death, the Toronto-based musician had been performing regularly as a keyboardist, songwriter and occasional vocalist with the Porkbelly Futures and Danny Brooks & the Rockin' Revelators. (He produced two of Brooks's albums.) Bell was also a member of the country-rock group Burrito Deluxe, performing and contributing songs to their CD Disciples of the Truth.Nashville Music Guide Bell died after a long battle with multiple myeloma on June 15, 2007, in Toronto's Sunnybrook Health Sciences Centre, at the age of 61.

The Southern Oregon AVA was established in 2004 and was created to include the land of two smaller AVAs: the Rogue Valley AVA and the Umpqua Valley AVA. Southern Oregon AVA was established to allow the two principal winegrowing regions in the southern part of the state to market themselves jointly. This creation of a \\"super-AVA\\" is a departure from the trend in the Willamette Valley AVA or northern Oregon of establishing smaller AVAs specific to a particular locale's climate or soil conditions.  Description  The Southern Oregon AVA is the union of the Umpqua Valley AVA and the Rogue Valley AVA, and all land suitable for grape cultivation within the Southern Oregon AVA is also located in one of these smaller regions. A small strip of connecting territory is included in the Southern Oregon AVA to make it a contiguous region, however, this strip passes through mountainous regions not suitable for viticulture. The AVA lies entirely within the southwest corner of the state, south of Eugene and west of the Cascades, and consists of the river valleys of the Rogue and Umpqua River rivers and their tributaries.  Umpqua Valley AVA  Umpqua River with tributaries The Umpqua Valley AVA contains the drainage basin of the Umpqua River, excluding mountainous regions. It has a warmer climate than the Willamette Valley, but cooler than the Rogue Valley to the south. Grapes grown here include Pinot Noir, with smaller amounts of Pinot Gris, Cabernet Sauvignon, Chardonnay, and Riesling, as well as several French-American hybrids.  Red Hill Douglas County, Oregon AVA  The Red Hill Douglas County, Oregon AVA is entirely contained within the Umpqua Valley AVA. This AVA includes , and is located near Yoncalla. Originally petitioned as the \\"Red Hill AVA\\", the proposed appellation brought protest from Willamette Valley vintners, where a region known as Red Hill is also located; the name of \\"Red Hill Douglas County\\" was instead chosen to avoid consumer confusion.  Elkton, Oregon AVA  The Elkton AVA is entirely contained within the Umpqua Valley AVA. This AVA includes and is located near Elkton.  Rogue Valley AVA  Rogue River and tributaries. The unlabeled stream to the east of the Illinois River is the Applegate River; Bear Creek is not shown on this map but flows through the valley in which Medford is located. The Rogue Valley AVA includes the drainage basin of the Rogue River and several tributaries, including the Illinois River, the Applegate River, and Bear Creek. Most wineries in the region are found in the valleys formed by one of these three tributaries, rather than along the Rogue River itself. The region is wide by long (though much of the land within the AVA is not suitable for grape cultivation); there are fewer than 20 wineries with only planted. Each river valley has a unique terroir, and grows different varieties of grapes. Overall, however, this region is the warmest and driest of Oregon's winegrowing regions.  Illinois Valley  The westernmost tributary is the Illinois River, which rises in southern Josephine County, in the Red Buttes Wilderness. The river flows generally northwest along the west side of the Klamath Mountains, past Cave Junction and Kerby then through the Siskiyou National Forest. It joins the Rogue River from the south on the Curry‚ÄìJosephine county line, approximately 15 mi (24 km) from the Pacific Ocean. The region is marked by its high elevation and is significantly influenced by marine climates. The region is well suited for growing Burgundy varietals, similar to those grown in the Willamette Valley.  Applegate Valley AVA  The Applegate Valley AVA, established in 2000, is the only sub-AVA in the Rogue Valley AVA. The Applegate River flows through the town of Applegate and near the city of Jacksonville, the location of Oregon's first winery (which has been restored and reopened as Valley View Winery). This region contains vineyards at altitudes ranging from to above sea level, and is warmer and drier than the Illinois Valley to the west, but less so than the Bear Creek Valley to the east. Grapes that thrive here include Merlot, Cabernet Sauvignon, Syrah, Chardonnay and Zinfandel, with Cabernet and Merlot being the dominant varietals.  Bear Creek Valley  Bear Creek is the most populated of the Rogue River tributaries, as it flows through the cities of Medford and Ashland. Here, the valley floor is above sea level, and the climate is warm and dry. The climate of the Bear Creek Valley is similar to that of Bordeaux, and it is well suited for cultivating varietals such as Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot, Chardonnay, Cabernet Franc, Pinot gris, Sauvignon blanc, Malbec and Syrah.

The film stars John Karlen, Stephen Shellen, Mark Keyloun, Jennifer Cooke and Lisa Wilcox in a short role. It was also released under the titles T & A Academy 2 and Cheerballs (West Germany). Plot The plot centers on competition between high-school cheerleading squads - and one squad, in particular, the Moline Ducks, is poor. The competition takes place at a camp run by middle-aged Bucky Berkshire aka Dr. Spirit (John Karlen), who this year decides to place a bet with his best instructor Tom Hamilton (Stephen Shellen) that he cannot make the woeful Ducks into a team that can beat the top-rated Falcons. If Berkshire loses, he pays up $10,000, and if Hamilton loses, he has to work another five years at the camp. Bucky Berkshire actually cannot stand Hamilton's antics, or his sexual but successful way of motivating the cheerleaders. However, a visiting group of wealthy Japanese businessmen will not finance Bucky's latest business plan without Hamilton on board to teach the cheerleaders. Thus, there is an ulterior motive behind Bucky's wager. As the teams get ready for their rounds of competition, several dance sequences, various teen pranks, and the usual sexual situations common in teen comedies weave their way through the storyline.

The station is licensed to Fort Lauderdale, Florida and owned by iHeartMedia. Y100 broadcasts at an effective radiated power of 100,000 watts from its 1,007 foot transmitter, which is located on the Miami-Dade side of the Miami-Dade/Broward County line near U.S. 441 and County Line Road. On a typical day its signal can generally be received north to Fort Pierce, southwest past Key Largo, and west deep into the Everglades. Its signal has even been known at times to go as far east as the Bahamas and as far south as Cuba. Its studios are located in Miramar. Y100 is the longest-running Top 40 station in both the United States and North America with the same call letters and nickname. History WMFP/WMJR The 100.7 FM frequency was signed-on in early 1960 as a religious station with the call letters WMFP. It was owned by Percy Crawford from 1960 to 1962. From 1962 to 1973, it was known as a beautiful music station with the call letters of WMJR. In late 1966, the station's studios (located in the Kenann building, a round building on the corner of US1 and Oakland Park Blvd. in Fort Lauderdale), tower, and signal coverage were greatly upgraded from 56,000 watts to 100,000 watts by engineer and entrepreneur Ron Crider, who sold the station in 1973 to former Hawaii congressman Cecil Heftel for $1,500,000, a record price for a radio station at the time. Y100 Y100 has been broadcasting continuously with various forms of contemporary hit music since it signed on August 3, 1973 at 6 a.m. with new call letters WLQY (the station was originally to be known as \\"Lucky 100\\". The station was renamed Y100 during a staff meeting with consultant Buzz Bennett at the suggestion of the first airstaff). The first song played on Y100 was \\"Diamond Girl\\" by Seals and Crofts. The original line-up included Roby Yonge and John Emm in mornings, Larry McKay in middays, future Power 96 jock Donnie \\"Cox On The Radio\\" Cox in afternoons, with Davey O'Donnell in nights, and Eric Rhoads on the overnights. Weekends included Bill Christie and Kevin Malloy. Bill Tanner was later hired as the midday personality and assistant Program Director, and later promoted to program director and moved to the morning show. Several months after signing on, the call letters were changed from WLQY to WHYI following complaints from crosstown competitor at what was 96.3 WMYQ. They felt the call letters were too similar and would create confusion. Y100 ushered in the era of the big money contests and aggressive promotional strategy that made the station one of the fastest- growing FM stations in the country during the 1970s. In 1975, Y100 was the first station in South Florida to broadcast live during the world-famous street party known as Calle Ocho. As Program Director, Bill Tanner hired the personalities who became so familiar to South Florida listeners including sports reporter John \\"Footy\\" Kross, newsman Jim Reihle, traffic reporter and the first \\"Captain Y\\" Glen Logan (he was replaced by Mark Lipof as the second \\"Captain Y\\" from 1976 to 1993), midday host the late Cramer Haas (originally hired for overnights), Joanne \\"Jo The Rock N Roll Madame\\" Meader became the first female DJ on Y100, who went to Z100 in New York as Jo Maeder, Jay Marks, Rick Eliott for afternoons, Robert W. Walker (later became PD) and Don Cox from crosstown WMYQ, Batt Johnson, Tom Birch, Dave Dunaway, Howard Perl, Quincy McCoy, with Earl \\"The Pearl\\" Lewis (from 13-Q Pittsburgh) and overnight guy Marcus \\"Mark In The Dark\\" Shands. Mark was also served as music director during part of his time at Y100 and was substitute newsman on Tanner's show. John Hartman was music director during the early 1970s until Colleen \\"The Vinyl Queen\\" Cassidy became the first female music and research director in 1978, moving in from WMAQ in Chicago, which had been run by eventual iHeartMedia CEO Bob Pittman. Cassidy started Y100's first call-out research department. She later became a music consultant for Miami's WPOW as well for so many other stations. The station mascot was the lovable Y100 Dolphin who was WHYI's first and only undersea mascot from 1973 to 2009. Marketing reports back then once showed that the dolphin logo was one of the most recognized logos in South Florida. Tanner's morning show was considered to be the high point of Y100's programming history, along with Tanner's role as Program Director. In 1976, Heftel sold Y100 to Metroplex Communications (Norm and Bob). In 1994 that company sold its group of stations to Clear Channel Communications (Now iHeartMedia). In January 2004, when sister classic rock station WBGG-FM moved its branding from Big 106 to Big 105-9, WHYI-FM rebranded as Y100.7, only to revert to the old branding by mid-2006. This was to avoid confusion with former Philadelphia alternative rock station WPLY), owned by Radio One. WPLY signed off the air in 2005. By 2007, the Y100.com URL formerly used by WPLY was acquired by WHYI-FM. Y100: morning show history =Sonny Fox & Ron Hersey= In 1982 Bill Tanner and Jim Reihle left Y100 for WASH-FM/Washington, DC. To replace them, Sonny Fox and Ron Hersey were recruited for mornings from crosstown WSHE-FM. Using a blend of parody songs, phoney commercials, and impersonations of local and national celebrities and politicians Fox, Hersey, Mark \\"Captain Y\\" Lipof, John \\"Footy\\" Cross and Mr. Mike Raffone led the morning show to its highest ratings ever. In 1987, Hersey moved on to mornings at WNVZ-FM/Norfolk, WAPW-FM/Atlanta and KKFR-FM/Phoenix where he worked with Danny Bonaduce. Fox left the following year and moved to mornings at KHYI-FM/Dallas (Y95) with Bill Murphy and Bill Tanner's former Y100 programming secretary, Joannie Siani. =Bobby & Footy= John Kross was a presence on the locally produced morning show for a record 32 years running from 1974 to 2006, thus holding the record of longest Top 40 CHR DJ in North America (even if he was actually a radio sports reporter for most of the time). Footy also hosted the \\"Y100 Wing Ding\\", a charity event to help fight drug abuse. Mark \\"Captain Y\\" Lipof left the show in 1993 after 17 years on-air, having produced the show and handling the duties of On-Air News Director and Traffic Reporter. He owns Lipof Advertising in Plantation, Florida. Famous morning show character \\"Mike Van Driver\\" aka Michael Woods traveled all over the market adding to the fun on the show. Morning Show Producer/On-air Personality \\"Video Steve\\" Czarnecki departed in 1998, six years after he started with the Morning Show later to pursue a career as a local television producer. Bobby also left Footy and South Florida in 1998 to head back home to Texas. =Footy & The Chix @ Six= In 1998, the morning show was renamed \\"Footy & The Chix @ Six\\", and Footy co-hosted the show with several female personalities, including Jade Alexander, Tina Malave, and Elaine Turner. Some commented that this line-up was the least successful, often referred to as \\"Footy with some Chix who don't like him\\". =Kenny & Footy= On Monday June 18, 2001, a new era in the morning show began as Footy was paired-up with popular afternoon drive time deejay Kenny Walker for \\"The Y100 Early Morning Show\\". A few months later, in January 2002, the show was renamed \\"Kenny & Footy in the Morning\\". In May 2002, Froggy left The MJ Morning Show to join the show. On Tuesday January 31, 2006 after 10 years with the station, Kenny Walker was released from Y100, at the expiration of his contract which was not renewed.WTVJ NBC-6 article - http://www.nbc6.net/news/6632533/detail.html In February, March, and April 2006 Footy and Froggy co-hosted the show with two popular afternoon and evening DJs - first Adam Bomb and then Michael Yo. On Monday \\"May Day\\" of 2006 Footy announced his retirement from Y100. It was actually his last in-studio show. He then took the show on the road for the next four days to Miami Lakes (Tuesday), Ft. Lauderdale (Wednesday), Coral Gables (Thursday), and Weston (Friday). The final weeks' worth of shows included special guests and former co-workers calling in or visiting Footy in person, classic highlights and comedy bits, and Y100 jingles from the past. His retirement was official as of the end of his Friday May 5, 2006 broadcast. A year later Footy came back out of retirement and landed a home back on the airwaves of South Florida on Fox News Radio affiliate 610 AM WIOD. =Current morning show= Currently, Y100 is the Miami affiliate for Elvis Duran and the Morning Show which airs on the station weekdays from 5am-10am Evolution 93.5 Miami On Tuesday, March 12, 2013, Evolution 93.5 Miami was launched on 93.5 FM, broadcasting Electronic dance music 24/7 from iHeartRadio's Evolution network, and started broadcasting on WHYI's HD2 subchannel as of late 2013.

He was elected in 1863 and guided the state through the latter part of the Civil War and the beginning of Reconstruction. At the outbreak of the war, Bramlette put his promising political career on hold and enlisted in the Union Army, raising and commanding the 3rd Kentucky Infantry. In 1862, President Abraham Lincoln appointed him district attorney for Kentucky. A year later, he was the Union Democrats' nominee for governor. Election interference by the Union Army gave him a landslide victory over his opponent, Charles A. Wickliffe. Within a year, however, federal policies such as recruiting Kentucky Negroes for the Union Army and suspending the writ of habeas corpus for Kentucky citizens caused Bramlette to abandon his support of the Lincoln administration and declare that he would \\"bloodily baptize the state into the Confederacy\\". After the war, Bramlette issued a general pardon for most ex-Confederates in the state. He opposed ratification of the Fourteenth and Fifteenth Amendments and the establishment of the Freedmen's Bureau in Kentucky. Among his accomplishments not related to the war and its aftermath were the reduction of the state's debt and the establishment of the Kentucky Agricultural and Mechanical College (now the University of Kentucky). Following his term as governor, Bramlette returned to his legal practice in Louisville. He died January 12, 1875 and was buried in Cave Hill Cemetery. Early life Thomas E. Bramlette was born on January 3, 1817, at Elliott's Cross Roads in Cumberland (now Clinton) County, Kentucky.Allen, p. 106 He was the son of Colonel Ambrose S. and Sarah (Elliott) Bramlette.Harrison, p. 112 His father served two terms in the Kentucky Senate and several terms in the Kentucky House of Representatives. Bramlette studied law, was admitted to the bar in 1837 at the age of 20, and began practicing in Louisville, Kentucky.NGA Bio In September of that year, Bramlette married Sallie Travis, the first of his two wives.Powell, p. 56 The couple had two children, Thomas and Corinne.Webb, p. 93 Bramlette's political career began in 1841, when he was elected to represent Clinton County in the General Assembly. In 1848, Governor John J. Crittenden appointed Bramlette Commonwealth's Attorney. He resigned the position in 1850 to continue his legal practice, relocating to Columbia, Kentucky in 1852. He was the Whig nominee for his district's seat in the House of Representatives in 1853, but was defeated by Democrat James Chrisman. In 1856, he was elected as a judge in Kentucky's 6th Judicial District, serving with distinction for five years. Military service Bramlette resigned his judgeship and accepted a commission as a colonel in the Union Army on August 7, 1861.Trowbridge, \\"Kentucky's Military Governors\\" In violation of Kentucky's agreement to remain neutral in the Civil War, he raised and commanded the 3rd Kentucky Infantry. On September 19, the 3rd Kentucky marched on Lexington to forestall a peace conference scheduled there on September 21 and to arrest the state's junior Senator, John C. Breckinridge.Rawley, p. 39 A delay allowed Breckinridge to escape before the arrest was made, and he enlisted in the Confederate Army shortly thereafter. Bramlette resigned his military commission on July 13, 1862 at Decherd, Tennessee. He returned to Louisville to accept President Abraham Lincoln's offer to become United States District Attorney for Kentucky.Encyclopedia of Kentucky During his tenure in this position, he vigorously enforced Kentucky's wartime laws against Confederates and Confederate sympathizers. Governor of Kentucky Union Democrats chose Joshua Fry Bell as their candidate for governor of Kentucky in 1863, but Bell was skeptical of Kentucky's future with the Union and withdrew his name from consideration. The party's central committee chose Bramlette to replace Bell, and Bramlette declined a commission as a brigadier general in the Union Army to make the race. During the election, Union forces intimidated and jailed supporters of Bramlette's opponent, former governor Charles A. Wickliffe. As a result, Bramlette carried the election by a margin of nearly 4-to-1.\\"Kentucky's Governors: 18511879\\" During his term, he turned down an offered seat in the U.S. House of Representatives as well as a nomination to become the Democratic candidate for Vice-President in 1864. Civil War In December 1863, Bramlette addressed the General Assembly, declaring that the state had fulfilled its quota of soldiers for the Union army.Webb, p. 94 January 4 of the following year, he proclaimed that rebel sympathizers would be held responsible for all guerrilla raids in the state, and specified stiff fines and imprisonment for anyone found to be aiding the guerrillas. Although Bramlette assumed the governorship as a staunch supporter of the Union cause, within a year he issued a proclamation that he would \\"bloodily baptize the state into the Confederacy\\". The reasons for Bramlette's reversal were many. He took issue with General Stephen Burbridge's decision to enlist Negroes from Kentucky for military service, asking that this measure only be taken if Kentucky failed to meet her quota. The situation worsened when on July 5, 1864, President Lincoln suspended the writ of habeas corpus for citizens of the Commonwealth.Harrison, p. 113 Burbridge continually menaced Kentucky's citizens, interfering with the presidential election of 1864, and banishing Lieutenant Governor Richard T. Jacob from the state. When the General Assembly re-convened in January 1865, Bramlette continued to voice his opposition to the Union's tactics. Nevertheless, he urged passage of the Thirteenth Amendment, maintaining that the institution of slavery was \\"irrevocably doomed\\".Webb, p. 95 Reconstruction era Despite his disagreements with the Lincoln administration, Bramlette proclaimed a day of fasting and prayer upon receiving news of Lincoln's assassination. The General Assembly petitioned new president Andrew Johnson to call an end to martial law in the state. The tension between the state and federal governments remained, however. Bramlette announced that every \\"white male citizen\\" twenty-one years of age who had resided in the Commonwealth for at least two years would be eligible to vote. Spurred on by the Democratic governor's actions, Kentucky gave control of both houses of the General Assembly and five of its nine congressional seats to Democrats. President Johnson received the message, ending martial law and restoring habeas corpus in Kentucky. When the General Assembly convened in December 1865, Bramlette sought to restore harmony in the state by issuing pardons to most ex-Confederates. He and the majority of the General Assembly opposed passage of the Fourteenth and Fifteenth amendments, and Bramlette protested the establishment of the Freedmen's Bureau in the Commonwealth. Bramlette was very proud of those of his accomplishments not related to the Civil War, including the reduction of the state's debt and the establishment of the Agricultural and Mechanical College (later, the University of Kentucky). He supported the construction of turnpikes financed by government bonds, the development of natural resources, and encouraged immigration to obtain adequate labor to support reconstruction efforts. Later life and death Following his term as governor, Bramlette conducted a failed campaign to become a U.S. Senator. He married Mary E. Graham Adams in 1874, two years after the death of his first wife. He returned to his law practice in Louisville, and became a patron of many charitable organizations. Bramlette died in Louisville on January 12, 1875 following a brief illness.Webb, p. 96 He is buried at Cave Hill Cemetery in Louisville.

The federal government approved this appellation in 1991. It is entirely contained within the larger Southern Oregon AVA and includes the drainage basin of the Rogue River and several tributaries, including the Illinois River, the Applegate River, and Bear Creek. Most wineries in the region are found in the valleys formed by one of these three tributaries, rather than along the Rogue River itself. The region is wide by long (most of the land within the AVA capable of producing high quality wine is not currently used for grape cultivation); there are fewer than 20 wineries with only planted. Each river valley has a unique terroir, and grows different varieties of grapes. Overall, however, this region is the warmest and driest of Oregon's wine-growing regions.  Applegate Valley AVA  The Applegate Valley AVA, established in 2000, is the only sub-AVA in the Rogue Valley AVA. The Applegate River flows through the town of Applegate and near the city of Jacksonville, which was the location of Oregon's first winery (the winery has been restored and re-opened as Valley View Winery). This region contains vineyards at altitudes ranging from to above sea level, and is warmer and drier than the Illinois Valley to the west, but less so than the Bear Creek Valley to the east. Grapes that thrive here include Merlot, Cabernet Sauvignon, Syrah, Chardonnay and Zinfandel, with Cabernet and Merlot being the dominant varietals.  Bear Creek Valley  Bear Creek is the most populated of the Rogue River tributaries, as it flows through the cities of Medford and Ashland. Here, the valley floor is above sea level, and the climate is warm and dry. The climate of the Bear Creek Valley is similar to that of Bordeaux, and it is well suited for cultivating varietals such as Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot, Chardonnay, Cabernet Franc, Pinot gris, Sauvignon blanc, Malbec and Syrah.  Illinois Valley  The westernmost tributary of the Rogue River is the Illinois River, which rises in southern Josephine County, in the Red Buttes Wilderness. The river flows generally northwest along the west side of the Klamath Mountains, past Cave Junction, Kerby and through the Siskiyou National Forest. It joins the Rogue River from the south on the Curry- Josephine county line, approximately from the Pacific Ocean. The region is marked by high elevation, and is significantly influenced by marine climates. The region is well-suited for growing Burgundy varietals, similar to those grown in the Willamette Valley AVA.

Early life Bartholemew Mosse was born in Dysart, 2 km east of Portlaoise (then called Maryborough), the fifth son of seven children born to William Mosse, a Protestant clergyman, and Martha Boyle. Bartholomew apprenticed with Dr. John Stone as a barber-surgeon from 1729-1733, when he passed examination by the surgeon-general. He married Mary Elizabeth Mallory in 1734, and they had a son, Michael, who was born in 1737. While historical records are unclear, it appears that both mother and infant died shortly thereafter. In 1738, he was appointed surgeon in charge of the draft of troops to Menorca, following which he spent time traveling through Europe. It is believed that it was during this time that he decided to focus on midwifery, to which end he observed maternity care in Paris, among other cities. In 1742, he married his cousin, Jane Wittingham, with whom he had two children: Charles and Jane, born in 1745 and 1746 respectively. The Dublin Lying-In Hospital Rotunda Hospital main entrance, Parnell Street, Dublin By 1743, he had determined to raise money for a purpose-built maternity hospital, which he achieved through subscriptions, as well as the patronage of many of Dublin's prominent citizens. With this money, he purchased an old theatre in George's Lane, which he converted into the Lying-In Hospital, opening in 1745. Demand soon outstripped the capacity of the hospital, and Mosse staged theatrical productions to raise money for expansion. He also purchased land on the outskirts of the city, where he constructed a pleasure garden, concert hall and coffee house, known as the New Gardens. Profit from this venture was used to construct the Rotunda Hospital, designed by Richard Cassels, which opened on 8 December 1757. Mosse spent a considerable amount of his personal fortune on this venture, falling into debt, and eventually being imprisoned for indebtedness, although he escaped through a window and went into hiding in Wales. He was also accused of misappropriation of funds, although no formal charges were ever brought, and Mosse was never convicted of any crime. He died of unknown causes on 16 February 1759 and is interred in Donnybrook Cemetery. His successor at the Hospital was Fielding Ould.

Professor Night works with Supreme both in a semi-regular partnership (a la World's Finest Comics) and as fellow founding members of the Allied Supermen of America, and its successor, the Allies (counterparts to the Justice Society of America and Justice League). He first appeared in Supreme vol. 3 #43. Fictional character biography Professor Night's secret identity is Taylor Kendall, and he lives in Kendall Manor, just outside Star City, with his Sikh butler, Pratrap, and his adopted daughter and biological niece, Linda Kendall, a.k.a. Twilight, the Girl Marvel, who partners him in crimefighting. Beneath Kendall Manor are the Halls of Night, Professor Night's secret base, where he keeps his advanced computer system, trophies of past cases, and his car, the Night- Wagon. The Halls of Night are also linked to the mythical underworld. The Professor and Twilight are afflicted with Porphyria's Complaint, which reportedly makes them less effective during the day but more alert and athletic at night, although they have nevertheless functioned well in daytime scenarios. Professor Night's villains include Jack-A-Dandy, Lounge Lizard, Evening Primrose, Fake-Face and the Walrus and the Carpenter. Most of his enemies are criminally insane, and locked in the Miskatonic Mental Institution (a play on Arkham Asylum, and H. P. Lovecraft's Miskatonic University in the city of Arkham).

Catfish raised in inland tanks or channels are considered safe for the environment, since their waste and disease should be contained and not spread to the wild. Asia In Asia, many catfish species are important as food. Several walking catfish (Claridae) and shark catfish (Pangasiidae) species are heavily cultured in Africa and Asia. Exports of one particular shark catfish species from Vietnam, Pangasius bocourti, has met with pressures from the U.S. catfish industry. In 2003, The United States Congress passed a law preventing the imported fish from being labeled as catfish.https://www.latimes.com/business/la-fi- catfish28nov28,0,6595048.story?coll=la-home-business L.A.

United States Ictalurids are cultivated in North America (especially in the Deep South, with Mississippi being the largest domestic catfish producer). Channel catfish (Ictalurus punctatus) supports a $450 million/yr aquaculture industry. The US farm-raised catfish industry began in the early 1960s in Kansas, Oklahoma and Arkansas. Channel catfish quickly became the major catfish grown, as it was hardy and easily spawned in earthen ponds. By the late 60s, the industry moved into the Mississippi Delta as farmers struggled with sagging profits in cotton, rice and soybeans, especially on those farm areas where soils had a very high clay content. The Mississippi Delta became the industry home for the catfish industry, as they had the soils, climate and shallow aquifers to provide water for the earthen ponds that grow 360-380 million pounds (160,000 to 170,000 tons) of catfish annually. Catfish are fed a grain-based diet that includes soybean meal. Fish are fed daily through the summer at rates of 1-6% of body weight with the pelleted floating feed. Catfish need about two pounds of feed to produce one pound of live weight. Mississippi is home to of catfish ponds, the largest of any state. Other states important in growing catfish include Alabama, Arkansas and Louisiana. Aquarium There is a large and growing ornamental fish trade, with hundreds of species of catfish, such as Corydoras and armored suckermouth catfish (often called plecos), being a popular component of many aquaria. Other catfish commonly found in the aquarium trade are banjo catfish, talking catfish, and long-whiskered catfish.

It was serviced to US contemporary hit radio stations on September 17, 2006, as the album's second single, and was released for purchase in November. Written by Aguilera, Linda Perry, and Mark Ronson, and produced by Perry, the song describes how the protagonist deals with the loss of a loved one and was inspired by the death of Perry's father. \\"Hurt\\" received mixed to positive reviews from music critics, who praised her vocals but were ambivalent towards its production. The song peaked at number 19 on the Billboard Hot 100 and was certified gold by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA). According to Nielsen SoundScan, the single has sold over 1.1 million copies in the United States. It was a top-ten hit in Europe and Oceania, entering the top ten of record charts in countries including Austria, Belgium, France, and Germany. A music video for the song was directed by Floria Sigismondi who had previously worked with Aguilera on the video for \\"Fighter\\". The video was also co-directed by Aguilera. It depicts Aguilera as a 1940s circus star who suffers from her father's death. It won two MVPA Awards for Best Video and Best Direction of a Female Artist in 2007, and was nominated for a Juno Award for Video of the Year. Aguilera has performed the song live on a number of occasions, including at the 2006 MTV Video Music Awards and on Saturday Night Live. The track was included on the setlist of Aguilera's Back to Basics Tour in 2006 and 2007.  Background and release  Aguilera's fifth studio album, Back to Basics, which consists of two discs, was released in August 2006. The second disc, described by Aguilera herself as \\"a '20s, '30s vibe,\\" was solely produced by her longtime collaborater‚Äìproducer Linda Perry. During the recording session, Aguilera wanted to record a song about the pain of losing a loved one and asked Perry for help. Perry developed the idea while thinking about her father, who had died less than a year ago. She revealed, \\"And she [Aguilera] came to me, and had these two chords that her and this guy wrote, and she was like 'I really like these chords, can you turn this into a song? I want the song to be about losing someone'. And inside of me, I'm going 'You little fucking bitch, you totally know I lost my dad, and now you're gonna milk my emotions.'\\" \\"Hurt\\" was released as the second single from Back to Basics following the album's lead single \\"Ain't No Other Man\\", which was released in June 2006. The song was serviced to US contemporary hit radio stations on September 17, 2006. It was subsequently released physically in Australia, Germany, and the United Kingdom in November. An extended play consisting of remixes of the song was made available digitally onto iTunes Stores on November 21, 2006. In France, the single was released physically on January 8, 2007. \\"Hurt\\" was not initially planned to be released as the follow-up to \\"Ain't No Other Man\\"; instead, \\"Candyman\\" was taken into consideration by Aguilera. Nevertheless, RCA Records decided to release \\"Hurt\\" as the album's second single afterwards because the label thought that it would be a commercial success similar to Aguilera's previous ballad \\"Beautiful\\" (2002). Composition \\"Hurt\\" is a pop ballad that lasts for four minutes and three seconds. According to the music sheet published at Musicnotes.com by Alfred Publishing, \\"Hurt\\" is set in the key of E minor and has a moderate tempo of 72 beats per minute. Aguilera's vocals on the song span from G#3 to E5. Its instrumentation comes from bass, cello, contrabass, drums, guitar, piano, viola and violin. It starts with a piano opening backed by strings and, as noted by Bill Lamb of About.com, \\"as the words work their way to a climax accented by percussion then gently fade away again leaving the listener in stunned silence from the beauty of the moment.\\" Lyrically, \\"Hurt\\" is an evocation of pain and guilt that accompanies the loss of a loved one. Joan Anderman from The Boston Globe commented that \\"Hurt\\" resembles her previous song \\"Beautiful\\" (2002), while Lindsay Levan of News & Record considered it an \\"intensely personal tune.\\" Chuck Taylor of Billboard deemed the song's lyrics as \\"moving past a relationship in ruins.\\" Critical reception Aguilera performing \\"Hurt\\" against a circus-inspired theme on her Back to Basics Tour in 2006 Chuck Taylor from Billboard praised the song's production and Aguilera's vocals, noting that the song gives, \\"testament to Aguilera's stupefying gifts as an emotive, mature powerhouse singer.\\" Jody Rosen of Entertainment Weekly said that the song's \\"self-help bromides Aguilera delivers with melodrama that would make Barbra Streisand shudder.\\" Writing for Newsday, Glenn Gamboa opined that Back to Basics would not be complete without \\"big\\" ballads like \\"Hurt\\", which was described as a \\"wrenching\\" song. Describing the song as \\"the centerpiece\\" of Back to Basics's second disc, About.com reviewer Bill Lamb gave the song a five out of five stars rating, commenting that the song \\"does not always fit easily into the typical pop radio, but it is a song that is very likely to generate significant listener requests.\\". Naomi West writing for The Daily Telegraph named \\"Hurt\\" a \\"supersized\\" ballad, while Dan Gennoe from Yahoo! Music called it \\"over the top\\" (OTT). In a review for musicOMH, John Murphy named the song a \\"touching ode\\", but was not impressed with the \\"sugary-sweet\\" string arrangement that \\"overwhelms\\" the song. Judy Faber from CBS News shared that the second disc of the album did not bring back the 1920s and 1930s sound, particularly with the \\"overwrought weeper\\" \\"Hurt\\". Rolling Stone magazine's Jenny Eliscu called \\"Hurt\\" an \\"incongruous schmaltzfest,\\" while Thomas Inskeep from Stylus Magazine named \\"Hurt\\" an \\"overblown\\" ballad. The song was deemed by AXS as Aguilera's best song. Chart performance In the United States, \\"Hurt\\" debuted at number 100 on the Billboard Hot 100 on the chart issue dated October 14, 2006. During the week of December 16, the single reached its peak at number 19 after spending ten weeks on the chart. The single peaked at number one the Hot Dance Club Songs, number six on the Adult Contemporary, and number ten on the Mainstream Top 40. It was certified gold by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) for shipments of over 500,000 units in the country. As of August 2014, \\"Hurt\\" has sold over 1,187,000 million digital copies in the US. In Canada, \\"Hurt\\" peaked at number 28 on the Canadian Singles Chart and was certified gold by the Music Canada for exceeding shipments of 40,000 copies there. In the United Kingdom, \\"Hurt\\" peaked at number 11 on the UK Singles Chart for two consecutive weeks and spent 15 weeks on the chart. The song debuted at number four on the √ñ3 Austria Top 40 chart, ultimately peaking at number two and spent a total of 27 weeks on the chart. \\"Hurt\\" peaked at number three in France, number two in Germany, and number one in Switzerland. It was certified Silver by the Syndicat National de l'√âdition Phonographique (SNEP), Gold in Germany, and in Switzerland. Music video Background The music video for \\"Hurt\\" was shot over five days in September 2006. It was co-directed by Aguilera alongside Floria Sigismondi, who had previously directed the music video for \\"Fighter\\" (2003). The video's concept was described as circus-inspired. During the first day of filming, the big top tent where the video was shot was \\"blown away\\" because of strong wind, which resulted in a delay in shooting and a change of location. The video premiered on October 17, 2006 on MTV's Total Request Live. In an interview with The Gazette, Aguilera revealed, > I definitely had a story for it ‚Äì a specific story ‚Äì that's why I felt that > it was important for her and I to co-direct this particular video and song > and she completely got it. She got my vision for it. She [Sigismondi] got > where I was trying to go and what she brings to the table is so incredible > and she's so creative and outstanding. And I always have a great time > working with her. There was no ego involved, you know, me - that was the > first video that I'd ever stepped up to the plate to literally co-direct. > I'd always been very opinionated and very you know, I always voice my ideas > and whatnot in my videos, but this was the first one I actually took credit > for in co-directing. And she was just so great and generous in teaching me > some of the ropes and learning about the different camera angles and you > know, all the facets and details that go into making a video. So, she was > really great and we had such fun with that. [...] And she's amazing. I can't > you know, she came to the set dressed in different outfits that related to > the circus everyday, so she's such an imaginative, creative spirit that I > just have such fun working with energy like that. Synopsis and reception Aguilera portraying a 1940s circus star in the music video for the song The video begins in black and white with the ending instrumental of \\"Enter the Circus\\"/\\"Welcome\\", over which a carnival barker (voiced by Linda Perry) introduces an audience to a circus. The transition to color begins when Aguilera appears in an old-fashioned dressing room, receiving flowers and then an important telegram saying, \\"In respect to inform you of the death of your father on the day of 02/09/1947.\\" A flashback then shows a young Aguilera, played by Laci Kay, with her father, played by Timothy V. Murphy, raptured by the sight of the tightrope walker, played by Elizabeth Glassco. With her father's encouragement, Aguilera begins to train herself to do the same. When the video switches to the real Aguilera, she is seen descending from the top of a circus tent on a rope, onto the back of an elephant, in pointe shoes and a structured jeweled outfit, with her father watching in the audience. She later attempts to greet him but is pulled away by fans and photographers. After being informed of the death of her father from the telegram and realizing that she was too wrapped up in her stardom to deal with what matters, she races through the circus in a belated attempt to find her father. Overwhelmed, Aguilera collapses on the ground and sees a silhouette of a man standing in front of the circus tent. Hoping the shadow figure to be her father, Aguilera holds out her hand with the elephant necklace on it to him. She breaks down crying when she realizes the silhouette has disappeared and that her father is gone. The video ends with a shot of Aguilera sitting on a circus box, singing and crying, before fading out to Aguilera's grief-stricken form on the ground outside the circus tent. The camera then zooms out and Aguilera is seen on the ground. Michael Slezak from Entertainment Weekly commented that \\"the video actually makes me like the song more than I did when I heard it on its own.\\" The video won two prizes at the 2007 MVPA Awards for Best Video and Best Direction of a Female Artist. It was also nominated for Video of the Year at the Juno Awards of 2007. Live performances and covers Aguilera performing \\"Hurt\\" on her Back to Basics Tour in 2006 Aguilera first performed the song at the MTV Video Music Awards on August 31, 2006; James Montgomery from MTV News named it one of the \\"high- gloss\\" moments of the event. Aguilera also promoted the song during the holiday season later that year, performing on the TV special Christmas at Rockefeller Center, aired by NBC on November 29, 2006. She performed the song on German entertainment show Wetten, dass..?, and on Saturday Night Live in 2006. \\"Hurt\\" was included on the setlist of Aguilera's Back to Basics Tour in 2006 and 2007. For the performance of the song, she dressed in a plume outfit designed by Roberto Cavalli and sang while a giant crescent moon descended from the ceiling. The performance recorded during Aguilera's show in Adelaide, Australia in 2007 was included on the Back to Basics: Live and Down Under DVD release. French singer Caroline Costa performed the song when she was 11 years old on French talent show La France a un incroyable talent. In December 2007, girl group Hope covered the song on the fourth season of The X Factor (UK). On the sixth season of the same show, Jamie Archer gave a rendition of the song. Russian metal cover project Even Blurry Videos released their version of the song on YouTube in August 2019.

The piece was first produced at the Imperial Theatre in London on 30 October 1880, starring Arthur Williams as Sir Mincing Lane and Frederick Rivers as Billee. It played at the Standard Theatre in New York later that year, starring J. H. Ryley and Alice Burville. Billee Taylor was a strong success on both sides of the Atlantic and enjoyed many revivals both in Britain and in the United States. Early revivals included The Gaiety Theatre, London (1885, with Marion Hood as Phoebe and Arthur Roberts as Barnacle) and Toole's Theatre (1886).Adams, p. 159 The satiric, cynical risqu√© story is based on the nautical poem and song of the same title by Richard Brinsley Sheridan, who is best known for \\"A School for Scandal.\\" Strangely, a version of this adult- themed story was created for children and published in 1881.

Kindly old Sir Mincing Lane has arranged the feast and has invited his friend, Captain Flapper of the Royal Navy. His daughter, Arabella, has fallen in love with Billee and offers her hand and fortune, but he refuses the tempting offer. Just as Billee and Phoebe are about to wed, Captain Flapper sees Phoebe and falls in love with her at first sight, vowing to marry her himself. A tutor, Christopher Crab is also in love with Phoebe. A sailor, Ben Barnacle, has gone to sea to forget about Eliza, whom he loves but who does not love him. To stop the marriage, Captain Flapper orders Ben to abduct Billee and impress him as a seaman, which he does. Phoebe and her classmates at the charity school all decide to disguise themselves as men and join the Navy. ;Act II Two years later, at Portsmouth, Billee has rapidly risen through the ranks and is now a lieutenant. Also back in port, still disguised as sailors, are Phoebe and the girls. Arabella has been persistent, and Billee is gradually warming to her attentions. Phoebe learns of this from Captain Flapper. She rushes off to see Billee and comes upon him agreeing to marry Arabella for her dowry. Phoebe confronts Billee who rejects her. Sir Mincing Lane who is gathering a company of volunteers, tries to enlist some of the sailors. Phoebe decides to join but is claimed by Barnacle as a messmate, and the soldiers and sailors quarrel. In desperation, and at the urging of Crab, she pulls out a pistol and fires at the unfaithful Billee. The gun misfires, hitting Crab, and Billee calls for assistance from the crowd attracted by the noise. Phoebe is sentenced to be shot but declares that she is a woman in love with Billee, who has betrayed her. But, dressed as a man, she convinces no one. So she bares her breasts. Just then Captain Flapper, still smitten, happens by, rescues Phoebe, and has Billee arrested as a coward and a traitor. All ends happily.

Located in the center area of Sarajevo and has great connections with public transport. It enrolls approximately 200 boys and girls annually. Although most of the students are from Sarajevo, the school also attracts students from the region as well as children of international diplomats. The school's approximate number of students is 900. The school offers international and national study programmes. History The school was founded in 1905 as an all-male school, but was made coeducational in 1957. As it was common in Yugoslavia, the school was officially named Gimnazija Ognjen Prica, after the national hero and teacher, but today adopts its current name standing for the chronological order of being opened, Druga being the second Sarajevo gymnasium. Education Druga is a certified IB World School, offering MYP and Diploma programmes, making it the first and so far only high school in Bosnia and Herzegovina offering a four-year education based on the international standards. Besides IB, the school follows the standard B&H; gymnasium Matura programme, with the first two years of core curriculum, and multiples fields of focused study for the final two years. Druga offers courses in natural sciences, linguistics, social sciences and math. Additionally, the school offers a four-year course focusing on mathematics, physics and computer science. The students are usually divided into six homerooms per year, each housing about 30 students, randomly (except the MYP) at the start of their tuition, and then sorted later on, based on their chosen field of study; each homeroom has the same class timetable throughout the year (once again, except the IB Diploma programme, to which all the students as well as outsiders have to pass the entrance exam, and have a choice of subjects). This method is commonly used by the B&H; Matura programme, but deviates from EU and USA methods.

It is often used as tool for teaching students how to search the Internet and how to use the resources and information available on the Internet. It is an online activity in the form of a scavenger hunt that focuses on gathering information from web sites to answer questions or to support a concept on a particular theme or content area. The intent is to hunt for facts or information to add details for the answer to the question. The questions themselves may vary from the simple fact or statement to the more complex, depending upon the age and skill level of the student. By completing CyberHunts, students learn how to navigate a web site, scan a page for detailed information, and then apply the facts or ideas to the question. A CyberHunt is an excellent way to teach beginning internet researching skills. An Internet scavenger hunt is a fact-finding exercise where students answer a list of questions or solve problems as they practice information seeking skills. A hunt can serve as a powerful tool to introduce the study of a new subject or to supplement the exploration of various sides of an issue. Although hunts frequently move from web site to web site, some direct a student's exploration of a single, content rich site. The single site strategy is employed to introduce users to the elements of a highly sophisticated site like the Library of Congress site, the government site Congress.gov or the Smithsonian site. This permits the teacher to highlight the key areas of a web site. History The first Internet Scavenger Hunt was developed in 1992 by Rick Gates.Lih, Andrew, \\"The Wikipedia Revolution\\", p34, (c)2009, Hyperion. He was a professor at the University of California at the time. He created the hunt to encourage adults to explore the resources on the Internet.Kozma, Tom, \\"The Internet Hunt\\", Info Tech News Issues, Wayne State University. Feb 1997. Gates distributed the questions to various Usenet newsgroups, LISTSERV discussion lists, and Gopher and FTP sites. He offered a prize for successful completion. As time went by he developed themed and then highly challenging hunts like researching a single email address. Levels of sophistication Beginner hunts are highly directive taking the user via a link, to the specific web page. A moderately challenging activity takes the user to a web site that has the answer to a posed question and requires them to choose an appropriate link, use the site map, or site search engine to locate facts that support their answer. The most sophisticated activity may post several open ended questions that require the student to make many choices including search tool and method, web sites and finally the correct supporting information. Hunts offer several advantages to using the Internet with younger web users. Since the developer chooses the web pages and links directly to them, this minimizes the risk of students being exposed to inappropriate material. With the student's web interaction highly scripted, misdirection by ads or video can be controlled. Instructors can target the rigor of the activity to challenge students by varying the level of abstraction of questions as defined by Taxonomy of Educational Objectives. Relevance of instructional material may be addressed by using Internet based news resources to infuse current events into the lesson. A well-developed scavenger hunt that is based on a novel enriches literature studies. It harnesses online resources to extend exploration of the setting and the plot. Highlighting historical references and lending insight through author study are also possible. Having students create an Internet fact hunt about a subject is one method for developing higher order thinking skills while reflecting knowledge and developing technology skills. Benefits The use of online resources for instruction and research takes advantage of widely available access to the hunt and the site(s) to which it is linked. This diminishes the need for extensive investments in print resources that quickly become outdated or irrelevant. A single book can be used by only one student at a time. A single web page can be accessed by millions. Typos and misinformation in print materials are there until the next printing. Typos or erroneous information on web pages are easily remedied in a matter of minutes. Many educational hunts are posted on the Internet permitting users worldwide to use the activity. Hunts can also be crafted in some word processing software and run from the individual computer desktop. Some developers are providing hunt activities in pdf (portable document format). This provides for a more consistent product appearance when printed. Links embedded in pdf documents are active on computers that have access to the net. Hunts are different from a webquest since the emphasis is on facts and finding information while webquest is inquiry-oriented activity that demands that students go beyond fact-finding. Examples There are thousands of hunts on the web that are content focused and grade level specific. When creating the CyberHunt, the teacher selects web sites that support their specific curriculum focus. The instructor has control over which sites have the best information to answer the questions. The students use only those sites in the activity. The intent is to focus on the material and not have students spend time using search engines or directories to accumulate numerous websites that must then be accessed, assessed and evaluated. Instead, students use their time to navigate to teacher-selected sites for the information. The CyberHunt lesson is streamlined to a simple fact-finding activity. For this reason, the typical activity takes one or more class periods to finish. There are no firm CyberHunt rules about the number of sites, the type of questions, or the amount of activity time to be allotted. CyberHunts have been created in all shapes and forms and for all grade levels. They cover most subjects and have no set time limit. The teacher has control over the sites, the type of questions, and the final product. In 2020, students have started using internet scavenger hunts to share interesting videos, sites, and activities with their colleagues. References Du Plessis, A. & Webb, P. (2011).

History The idea for the album originated from Pesci's character Vincent LaGuardia Gambini, from his 1992 movie My Cousin Vinny. In the movie, Pesci starred as Vinny, an inexperienced lawyer who comes to the rescue of his wrongly accused cousin Billy Gambini, played by Ralph Macchio. Before becoming a professional actor, Pesci was a lounge singer. When he announced his retirement from acting in 1999, he pursued a further career in singing. Pesci remained retired until his return to acting in Robert De Niro's 2006 film The Good Shepherd, where he played Joseph Palmi. The album was released on October 13, 1998 on Columbia Records. It is stamped with a parental advisory sticker for explicit content. A music video was produced for the song \\"Wise Guy,\\" featuring Pesci reciting his lyrics in various mob-themed settings. \\"Wise Guy\\" recreates elements from the Blondie song \\"Rapture\\" and features a chorus lyrically similar to that of Fred Rogers' \\"Won't You Be My Neighbor?\\".

The assets of Praxsys were acquired by Sun in the fall of 1992. The name \\"Wabi\\" was chosen for two reasons: its meaning in Japanese of balance or harmony, which conjured the notion of a more peaceful coexistence between Windows and Unix software; and, the more obvious implication of it standing for Windows Application Binary Interface, although before its release Sun declared that the name was not an acronym. Wabi 2.2B was licensed by Caldera to allow its users to run Windows applications under Linux,Wabi: Caldera's Solution for Windows Applications together with the also licensed Merge. Wabi development was discontinued in December 1997. Features Wabi requires a Windows 3.x installation in order to work, meaning that it also requires a Windows license, unlike similar software that endeavors to implement the entire Windows API, such as Wine or select versions of OS/2. The basic premise of the product is to provide an emulation of the lowest layers of the Windows environment in the form of the user.dll, kernel.dll and gdi.dll libraries. As all other Windows dlls depend on these three modules, cloning this functionality allows Windows applications and their associated support dlls to execute correctly on a foreign host system. This approach, as opposed to a full replacement, was thought by the engineering team to be the only rational methodology for success given both the size of Microsoft's ever-expanding efforts and the difficulties of the emulation being precise enough to run commercial grades of software. Wabi was released for both x86 and SPARC systems. In order to run an x86 Windows environment on SPARC systems, a code translation layer was also provided, which dynamically converts x86 instructions on first use into SPARC instructions. Standardization attempt In conjunction with its development of the Wabi software, Sun initiated an effort to create an ISO standard, non-proprietary definition of the Windows API. The Public Windows Initiative (PWI) was intended to define a publicly available standard that would help Sun and other companies that wished to clone the Microsoft Windows programming interface (such as Willows TWIN,Linux Journal: \\"The Desktop War\\" another LGPL'd implementation of the APIWillows TWIN libraries are LGPL), but despite Sun's contention that there was no intellectual property breach, this effort was lobbied against at ISO by Microsoft, being rejected in 1996.Sun Uses ECMA as Path to ISO Java Standardization (Computergram International) See also *Sun386i *SunPCi *Macintosh Application Environment *Wine - Windows compatibility layer References External links * Wabi 2.2 User's Guide * Review of Caldera's Wabi 2.2 for Linux * Wabi for Linux User's Guide * 1998 comparison of Caldera's Wabi 2.2B, Wine and Willows Twin Libraries * \\"Wabi: Caldera's Solution for Windows Applications\\" (Linux Journal, 1997) Compatibility layers Sun Microsystems software ","title":"Wabi (software)"},{"id":"6485266","text":"John Robert 'Bertie' Peacock MBE (29 September 1928 ‚Äì 22 July 2004) was a Northern Ireland international footballer and manager who played for Celtic.

During his time at the club he won one league title, two Scottish Cups and two Scottish League Cups. In 1962, he played in the Eastern Canada Professional Soccer League with Hamilton Steelers, where he served as a player-coach. Peacock won 31 caps for Northern Ireland. He featured alongside Harry Gregg, Danny Blanchflower and Billy Bingham in the team that reached the last eight in the 1958 World Cup, the country's furthest progress to date. Managerial career Peacock became Northern Ireland manager a year after his retirement as a footballer in 1961, giving George Best his first start. In the 1960s he returned to Coleraine, winning the Irish League title in 1974. Peacock briefly came out of retirement when he came on as a substitute against Shamrock Rovers in the Texaco Cup in September 1971. It was his last game for Coleraine as they lost 3‚Äì0 at The Showgrounds (Coleraine). He was also assistant manager to Billy Bingham during Northern Ireland's 1982 World Cup campaign, where they famously knocked out hosts Spain in Valencia.Culture of Northern Ireland Later life and legacy Alongside Jim Weir and Victor Leonard, Peacock was one of the founders of the Milk Cup. Held in his native Coleraine, the youth football competition started with sixteen teams in 1982 and rose to become one of the most respected tournaments in the world. In 1986 he was awarded the MBE for his services to football. He died in 2004, aged 76. In June 2006 a statue of Peacock was commissioned. The memorial stands in Coleraine and was unveiled by Pat Jennings in July 2007, at the opening of the 25th Milk Cup.Statue tribute to NI soccer legend, BBC News, 30 July 2007 Also in 2006, a youth football club was formed in his honour: Bertie Peacocks Youths. This club has a range of teams from under-7 to under-16. In only two years, the teams have been very successful - the under-11s in particular, winning the Down and Connor League, the Down and Connor Knock-Out Cup and becoming Northern Ireland Boys Champions all in the 2008 season.

Johnston is the younger brother of singer- songwriter Michelle Shocked and has supported her in concert tours as well.The New York TimesThe New York Times Career Johnston began performing with Uncle Tupelo in the fall of 1992 during the \\"Arkansas Traveler Review tour\\" during which Uncle Tupelo was the opening act for a bill including The Band, Taj Mahal, and headliner, Michelle Shocked. Although the tour fell apart after just a few shows, Johnston continued to play with Uncle Tupelo occasionally at first, and then as a regular part of the band appearing on the group's final studio album, Anodyne. Following the departure of Jay Farrar in May, 1994, the remaining members of Uncle Tupelo, including Johnston, Ken Coomer, and John Stirratt, formed the band Wilco under the leadership of Jeff Tweedy. Johnston left Wilco shortly after their second album, Being There in 1996 to form his own short-lived band, the Pony Stars and tour with his sister, Michelle Shocked. (Some descriptions of events suggest Johnston was fired by his Wilco band-mates ). Johnston was then briefly a member of the Louisville, Kentucky- based band, Freakwater, and gave instrumental support to singer-songwriter Steve Forbert before settling into his present role in 1999 with the Austin- based band, The Gourds. Johnston was offered a position in The Gourds and immediately accepted it after sitting in with the band at their South by Southwest showcase. After years of performing mainly as a sideman for great songwriters (Farrar, Tweedy, Shocked, and Irwin), Johnston at last felt himself to be a contributing member of the band. \\"This is more mine than anything I've ever been involved with,\\" Johnston stated, \\"I have a voice in this band. With Tupelo, it was like, 'Wow, I'm in Uncle Tupelo,' you know? But I didn't have much input. Here, I finally found a group of guys who listen to me, we communicate on a level I haven't before.\\" By the time of his second recording with the band, Bolsa de Agua, Johnston had found his voice contributing the tracks, \\"Jesus Christ (with Signs Following)\\" and \\"O Rings\\". Johnston has continued to remain active with The Gourds, whose most recent release is 2011's Old Mad Joy. On October 7, 2014 Johnston released a solo album, \\"Dismantling Paradise\\".

The route crossed Indian Territory from Colbert's Ferry to Fort Smith, Arkansas which was the Center for the Overland Mail's' 7th Division. Fort Smith was also the junction point of the south bound coaches with the Memphis mail and its passengers. From Fort Smith the 7th Division route crossed the Poteau River into Indian Territory into the Choctaw Nation at Skullyville and left the Chickasaw Nation at Colbert's Ferry into Texas. There were 12 stage stations in Indian Territory, located from 13 to apart. The total length of the route across the territory was approximately . The Butterfield route met with the Texas Road near Geary's Station and followed it southward to the Red River. Although it lasted only from 1857 to 1861, the Butterfield route made famous one of the most important roads in the settlement and development of early Oklahoma and was used until shortly before statehood in 1907. The route followed an old Indian trail out of the military's Fort Smith and was used by the Chickasaws during their settlement west in 1837. Following the Civil War, the Choctaw Council, to improve their economic interests, built bridges and turnpikes and maintained stage stands along their portion of the route.

The circuit is based on the perimeter track of a former World War II airfield, and was opened for racing in 1950.  History  The Castle Combe airfield opened in May 1941 on land of the Castle Combe estate, owned by the Gorst family, operating as RAF Castle Combe for seven years before being decommissioned in 1948. It was a fighter-base for Polish airmen.Britain's Top Circuits, race circuit guide, 1966 hard copy (free supplement with Motor Cycle), Accessed 2015-04-30 Castle Combe Circuit opened in 1950, and the first meeting was staged on 8 July by the Bristol Motorcycle & Light Car Club. Over the next few years, the circuit attracted star names such as Stirling Moss, Mike Hawthorn, Roy Salvadori and John Surtees. British Formula Three cars in 2003 The circuit's first motorcycle event was in 1952, organised by the Wessex Centre. Castle Combe has staged many different motorsport disciplines over the years. In 1997, Nigel Greensall established a new lap record. His Tyrrell 022 lapped the circuit at . However, this was the last year that the circuit would remain unaltered. A tragic accident involving the death of a spectator forced the owners into installing two new chicanes in order to slow the cars down. The new layout was slightly longer at , and was completed over the winter of 1998-1999. Formula Three returned to Castle Combe in 2001. However, it would not stay long. In 2005, the circuit was issued with a noise nuisance order, which meant that the circuit had to reduce its noise level. The British Formula Three Championship and the British GT Championship were both louder than permitted, and so were prevented from returning.  Present  Races include a home-circuit championship with classes for Saloon cars, Sports & GTs, and Formula Ford. Racing clubs from around the UK include the track in the events for their championships, including the 750 Motor Club, and BRSCC.750 Motor Club, race calendar 2015, Retrieved 11 October 2015British Racing and Sports Car Club events 2015 Retrieved 12 October 2015 Once a year motorcycle racing takes place over two days during the summer. The weekend includes a sidecar championship and an historic race, as well as the more modern supersport races. As well as holding trackdays for both cars and motorcycles, Castle Combe Circuit holds a large number of car shows. These shows follow a general motorsport theme and exhibit show stands, market stalls, stunt demonstrations, classic displays and on certain days the circuit is able to hold track sessions. The shows have proven to be a big success, offering the motoring community a place to display their vehicles and use them on a racetrack in a safe and controlled environment, with each year building on the last and gaining larger and larger crowds. Throughout the year, Castle Combe Circuit is the current venue for Spring Action Day, Classic, retro & kit car action day, Forge Motorsport action day and Japfest. Since 2001 Rallyday, an annual demonstration event for rally cars, has also been held. Motoring shows Top Gear and Fifth Gear have used this circuit to race or test cars on. One such race was British motorcycle racer Leon Haslam on a Ducati 1098 vs Fifth Gear presenter Tiff Needell driving a Lamborghini Gallardo Superleggera, the bike coming out on top. Top Gear used the circuit for their '70s Supercar challenge. In this episode The Stig lapped a Vauxhall Astra. Jeremy Clarkson said \\"It's a fierce track this, one of the fastest in Britain, a real car breaker.\\" One aspect of the circuit which has remained unchanged throughout the years is the large population of rabbits who live in the extensive tyre barriers around the circuit.

During his five- month absence from the capital, she was governor of the Viceroyalty. She thus became the first female governor of the Viceroyalty of Peru. Biography Ana was born into the House of Borja (Italian: Borgia). She was a distant relative of Francisco de Borja y Arag√≥n, poet and viceroy of Peru from 1615 to 1621, and, like him, descended from Saint Francis Borgia. She was the daughter of Francisco Diego Pascual de Borja y Arag√≥n y Centelles, 8th duque de Gand√≠a, and of Artemisa Mar√≠a Ana Teresa Gertrudis, princesa de Doria de Melfi. Her elder sister Magdalena was the wife of Philippe Fran√ßois, 1st Duke of Arenberg. Her second marriage, on July 20, 1664, was to her cousin, Pedro Antonio Fern√°ndez de Castro Andrade y Portugal, 8th conde de Villalba, 10th conde de Lemos, 7th marqu√©s de Sarria. By this marriage she became the condesa (countess) de Lemos. Her husband was named viceroy of Peru on June 12, 1667, under the authority of Mariana of Austria, regent for her son Charles II of Spain. The Count and Countess of Lemos arrived in Peru at the port of Callao on November 9, 1667. They were received by the Spanish of the colony with much pomp. The viceroy took possession of his office on November 21, 1667. On June 7, 1668, Viceroy Pedro Antonio Fern√°ndez de Castro sailed from Callao for Islay, Arequipa and Puno, leaving his wife in charge of the government of Peru, as gobernadora (female governor). This was an official appointment. The royal decree by which the count held the position of viceroy provided that in his absence from the capital, the government would be entrusted to his wife. She was not a figurehead; she exercised real authority and ran the business of the colony during her husband's absence, making decisions and issuing decrees. Her authority was recognized by the Audiencia of Lima. She met with them and other officials on July 5, 1668. News of the July 11, 1668, attack on Portobelo, Panama, by the English pirate Henry Morgan arrived in Lima on the following August 31. In response, Countess Lemos sent supplies and military equipment in aid of the defenders and readied the colonial navy to guard against pirates off the Peruvian coast. Pirates did attack the port of Callao during her period in office. The viceroy returned and resumed his office on November 12, 1668. The countess had been governor of Peru for five months and five days. She had two children before leaving Spain, and three children in Lima. By virtue of the different locations of birth, the first two were Peninsulares and the later three were Criollos. Her fourth child, Rosa Francisca, was born September 18, 1669, and named for Blessed Rose of Lima. The countess had much influence in the Court of Spain, and because of that, with the papacy. She continued the work of her uncle, Viceroy Francisco de Borja y Arag√≥n, to achieve the beatification and canonization of St. Rose. Beatification was conferred on February 12, 1668. The official celebration was held on April 15 of that year, in the Basilica of San Pedro, and the official communication arrived in Lima on January 18, 1669. The count and countess sent a sculpture of St. Rose to the Vatican. Melchiorre Caf√† was the sculptor. On the occasion of her beatification, her wooden coffin was replaced by one of silver, at the expense of the countess. At the request of Spanish regent Mariana of Austria, on August 11, 1670, Rose was named patron of the Spanish possessions in the Americas and the Philippines. She and Francis Borgia were canonized on April 12, 1671, by Pope Clement X. Rose was the first native-born American to become a Catholic saint. Viceroy Count Lemos died December 6, 1672. The countess and her children left Peru on June 11, 1675. She died in 1706. Books and Documents *Mugaburu, Josephe and Francisco, Journal of Lima (1640‚Äì1694). Printing C. Vasquez, 1935.

He is a professor of philosophy and the dean of the Honors College at Wayne State University in Detroit, Michigan and the author of several books, with a focus on the morality of homosexuality. Corvino is sometimes referred to as \\"The Gay Moralist\\", a sobriquet he assumed while writing a column of the same name. Early life and education John Frank Corvino was born in 1969 to John R. Corvino and Annette R. Corvino. He was raised Catholic and is of Italian descent. In 1987, he graduated from Chaminade High School, an all-boys Catholic school in Mineola, New York. Corvino attended St. John's University in New York City, graduating with a Bachelor of Arts in philosophy in 1990.Curriculum Vitae for John Corvino He earned his Doctor of Philosophy in philosophy at the University of Texas at Austin in 1998. His dissertation was Hume's Moral Realism, and his advisor was A. P. Martinich. Career Corvino is Professor and Chair of Philosophy at Wayne State University in Detroit, Michigan.Profile at Wayne State University He began teaching there in 1998 and received tenure in 2007. His foci are ethics, applied ethics, and early modern philosophy. Other areas in which he has concentrated include the philosophy of religion, social philosophy, and political philosophy. He has taught classes focusing on Hume as well as British empiricism. For nine years, Corvino wrote a column titled \\"The Gay Moralist\\". The column appeared bi-weekly in Between the Lines from 2002 to 2007 and then weekly on 365gay.com from 2007 to 2011. Although Corvino stopped writing the column in 2011, he is still sometimes referred to by the appellation today. Corvino--who is openly gay--has written, debated, and lectured extensively on gay rights and frequently debates with opponents of same-sex marriage, including Maggie Gallagher, the former head of the National Organization for Marriage, and Glenn Stanton of Focus on the Family. Corvino argues that spirited dialogue and debate with opponents of homosexuality and same-sex marriage is essential to convince the wider American public of both the merits of same-sex marriage and the moral acceptability of homosexuality. Corvino has argued that gay rights activists should avoid referring to opponents of gay rights as \\"bigots\\", calling it a \\"conversation-stopper\\". Corvino has written three books: Debating Same-Sex Marriage with Maggie Gallagher (2012), What's Wrong with Homosexuality? (2013), and Debating Religious Liberty and Discrimination with Ryan T. Anderson and Sherif Girgis (2017). In part with the assistance of Chase Whiteside, Corvino has produced three popular YouTube video series, in which he responds to frequently asked questions on topics covered in each of his books. Corvino has also written on business ethics\\"Reframing 'Morality Pays': Toward a Better Answer to 'Why be Moral?' in Business\\", Journal of Business Ethics vol. 67 (August 2006), pp. 1‚Äì14.\\"Loyalty in Business?\\", Journal of Business Ethics vol. 41 (November/December 2002), pp. 179‚Äì85. and has contributed to many academic journals and periodicals, including The Gay & Lesbian Review Worldwide, Southwest Philosophy Review, Business Ethics Quarterly, Philosophical Quarterly, and Ethics. Works and reception Corvino has focused his works on the moral and legal standing of homosexuality, often partnering with ideological opponents to present both sides of a debate fairly and accurately. He has received widespread praise for his civil, articulate approach to controversial issues and his respectful dialogue with opponents. Several prominent opponents of same-sex marriage have expressed respect for Corvino, albeit still disagreeing with him, and LGBT rights activists have commended him for engaging the other side with patience and geniality. Debating Same-Sex Marriage Debating Same-Sex Marriage Corvino co-authored Debating Same-Sex Marriage (2012) with Maggie Gallagher, co-founder of the National Organization for Marriage (NOM). The book received praise from both proponents and opponents of same-sex marriage. In the San Francisco Book Review, Elizabeth Raymond wrote, \\"Debating Same-Sex Marriages format is quite interesting - and massively effective . . . It's like witnessing a live debate between these two lively characters . . . I highly recommend this to all - if only for a manual on how to respectfully debate a member of the opposing viewpoint. Well done!\\" Among other positive reviews were those from LGBT rights activist Dan Savage, Republican senator Rick Santorum, Matt Reynolds of Christianity Today, and Ryan T. Anderson of National Review. In The Times Literary Supplement, libertarian Nigel Ashford commented that \\"the tone of the book--of reason and logic, respect for opponents and willingness to engage in intellectual combat--is set by Corvino himself in his examination of the case against homosexuality, and by the inclusion of a rebuttal of his own arguments.\\"Ashford, Nigel. Review of Same Sex: Debating the Ethics, Science, and Culture of Homosexuality, The Times Literary Supplement, 4 September 1998. p. 13. What's Wrong with Homosexuality? What's Wrong with Homosexuality? What's Wrong with Homosexuality? (2013) received several positive reviews, including from Episcopal bishop Gene Robinson and feminist philosopher Martha Nussbaum. The book received a negative review from Nathaniel Frank in The Washington Post. Conservative intellectual Robert P. George wrote, \\"John Corvino is a philosophically sophisticated, lucid writer who makes a serious effort here to engage those (like me) with whom he disagrees. He argues aggressively, to be sure, but does not resort to calling his critics names or impugning their motives. Moreover, he is commendably willing to come to grips with challenges to the presuppositions and implications of the position he holds. He is, in short, a worthy intellectual opponent in the debate over the ethics and meaning of sex and marriage.\\" Debating Religious Liberty and Discrimination Debating Religious Liberty and Discrimination Corvino co-authored Debating Religious Liberty and Discrimination (2017) with Ryan T. Anderson and Sherif Girgis. The book received praise for being a constructive, back-and-forth discussion on religious freedom and anti-discrimination law. Among its positive reviews were those from Russell D. Moore of the Southern Baptist Convention, Albert Mohler of The Gospel Coalition, and Andrea Picciotti-Bayer in National Review. In Commonweal, Robert K. Vischer wrote, \\"Debating Religious Liberty and Discrimination is a direct challenge to our cultural moment, opting for careful analysis over clickbait, mutual understanding over demonization, and clearly demarcated disagreement over sweeping dismissal. The authors take the time to lay out their best arguments, then respond to the best arguments of their opponents. Whether or not the book ultimately causes readers to change their views is not the measure of its success. The authors provide a desperately needed model for engagement: they argue with, not at their opponent; they argue together.\\" Bibliography (partial) ;Books * Same Sex: Debating the Ethics, Science, and Culture of Homosexuality (as editor and contributor), Lanham, Maryland: Rowman & Littlefield, 1997. * Debating Same- Sex Marriage (with Maggie Gallagher), New York: Oxford University Press, 2012. * What's Wrong With Homosexuality?, New York: Oxford University Press, 2013. * Debating Religious Liberty and Discrimination (with Ryan T.

They are commonly provided in hotel rooms worldwide, though may also be purchased for home use; they are generally associated with use by businessmen who require a formal appearance to their suit. Trouser pressing process Most trousers creases occur on the bottom two-thirds of trouser legs, particularly around the back of the knee. Trouser presses are typically the tool for removing these creases without damaging the trousers. On a typical trouser press, the side levers are raised; and the trousers placed between the pressing plate and the cushioned heating pad. The press is slowly closed, the trousers gently pulled so that they align properly and the press dial turned on for heat. The press heats to around regardless of model type. It can take roughly 15 to 45 minutes to press the trousers depending on the model type and the thermostatically-controlled heating pad will warm up and gently press out creases and wrinkles without scorching the trousers. Corby Trouser Press The Corby company's premises in Andover (2008) The Corby Trouser Press brand is the genericized trademark for the product. John Corby Limited was established by John Corby in Windsor, Berkshire, in 1930 as a manufacturer of valet stands. These were later improved with the addition of a pressing area and the first Corby trouser press was launched. These subsequently became electrically heated during the 1960s. In 1977 John Corby Limited became part of what is now Jourdan plc and was relocated to Andover, Hampshire in 1986. In 2005, the company moved manufacture to the premises of a sister company Suncrest Surrounds Limited in Peterlee, Co Durham. All sales, marketing and service operations continue to operate from Andover in Hampshire. The business was bought in May 2009 by Yorkshire businessman and entrepreneur Richard Kaye's Fired Up Corporation Ltd based in Huddersfield. The brand was later re-launched, reverting to its founding name of \\"Corby of Windsor\\". In popular culture During the 1960s the trouser press was an aspirational product for the British middle classes, and this led to a thread of satire and cultural references. The Bonzo Dog Band recorded the song, \\"Trouser Press\\", for their 1968 album The Doughnut in Granny's Greenhouse, satirising 1960s consumerism, and making numerous references to the trouser press as emblematic of middle class life. Author and journalist Ira Robbins founded an influential alternative music magazine titled Trouser Press after the Bonzo song, and his book The Trouser Press Record Guide: The Ultimate Guide to Alternative Stone is a reference work on alternative and outlandish music first published in 1983 and the fourth edition was published in 1991 ().Review, Entertainment Weekly The ubiquitous presence of the trouser press in British commercial hotels has made them a recurring theme, along with \\"tea and coffee making facilities\\", in British comedian Bill Bailey's monologues. The Tea, Coffee and Trouser Press Census tour diary along is included as an extra feature on his Part Troll DVD. Bailey's Tinselworm show has a spoof infomercial in the style of Kraftwerk, Hosenb√ºgler (German for trouser press), which sees Bailey and Kevin Eldon riding around the stage on Segways with trouser presses mounted on them. It has also been featured in the British comedy I'm Alan Partridge during the episode \\"Basic Alan\\" in which Alan dismantles a Corby Trouser Press in his bored desperation.

The first edition took place in 1980.  Description  The meeting is organized, since 2008, by the Foundation Meeting for Friendship amongst Peoples http://www.meetingrimini.org/statuto/. Apart from seven people who work full-time for its planning, the festival is entirely staged, managed and dismantled by about 4000 volunteers (mostly university students) coming from all over Italy and ten other countries of the world. The meeting has had about 800,000 attendees per year in the last editions. Several prominent people from science, culture, society and politics give lectures at the meeting, including Nobel prize recipients, religious authorities (the Pope participated in 1982), politicians and ministers (the Italian prime minister participated a few times), international authorities (Tony Blair and others), writers, musicians (Riccardo Muti participated).

The sign translated says, \\"We want coal - We want bread.\\" The President's Economic Mission to Germany and Austria was a series of reports commissioned by US President Harry S. Truman and written by former US President Herbert Hoover. Based on Hoover's previous experience with Germany at the end of World War I, in January 1947 President Harry S. Truman selected Hoover to do a tour of Europe, focusing on Germany and Austria in order to ascertain the food situation of the occupied nations. Hoover toured what was to become West Germany in Reich Marshall Hermann G√∂ring's old train coach and produced several reports sharply critical of US occupation policy. The economy of Germany had \\"...sunk to the lowest level in a hundred years\\". Hoover proposed a changed economic occupation policy in his reports, if nothing else but for the sake of sparing the American taxpayers the burden of supporting Central Europe indefinitely. Report No. 3 It has been suggested that Herbert Hoover's March 1947 economic report titled \\"The necessary steps for promotion of German exports, so as to relieve American tax payers of the burdens of relief and for economic recovery of Europe\\" helped end the execution of the Morgenthau plan, particularly through the paragraph which stated: \\"There is the illusion that the New Germany left after the annexations can be reduced to a 'pastoral state'. It can not be done unless we exterminate or move 25,000,000 people out of it.\\" General Lucius Clay was of the opinion that the German economy was vital for European recovery, and had tried to use loopholes in the occupation directive JCS 1067 to pursue a less harsh deindustrialization policy in the US occupation zone than others in the US desired. Hoover's conclusions were similar to those of the Council on Foreign Relations and those of General Clay when Hoover stated: \\"The whole economy of Europe is interlinked with German economy through the exchange of raw materials and manufactured goods. The productivity of Europe cannot be restored without the restoration of Germany as a contributor to that productivity.\\" The findings of Hoover's report that Germany should be made the engine of European recovery were endorsed by General Clay and the US War Department, but were resisted by the State Department which drafted a paper that fiercely attacked the report. The State Department position was that priority should be given to the economic and security requirements of Germany's neighbors. President Truman's assistant John R. Steelman expressed fear about reviving the \\"German colossus\\". Edwin W. Pauley, who had been industrial and commercial adviser to the Potsdam Conference and until 1947 President Truman's representative to the Allied Reparations Commission, expressed his strong dislike for the report. Pauley stated that to follow Hoover's recommendations would entail a \\"major reversal\\" of US policy and warned about future German domination of Europe. Nevertheless, despite the fierce debate it had generated Hoover's report had made it very obvious to the US leadership that a new policy was needed; \\"\\"almost any action would be an improvement\\" on current policy.\\"  Other Hoover reports  Report No. 1: German Agriculture and Food Requirements Roughly 18 months earlier a similar report by another Hoover, Professor Calvin Hoover, had faced similar opposition. In mid October 1945 the US Military Government in Germany submitted a 15 page report to the Allied Control Council. The report contained a lenient interpretation of the Potsdam conference policy and advocated partial economic reconstruction. Edwin W. Pauley labeled the proposal partly lessening the capacity restrictions on German steel production \\"ridiculous\\". General Dwight D. Eisenhower pointed out that it was an unofficial report and proceeded to criticize the critics of it for having \\"accepted it as policy\\". Eisenhower stated his position to the press as \\"...I say let Germany find out what it means to start a war.\\" The US public at the time held the (partly erroneous) belief that the decision at Potsdam had been to completely pastoralize Germany, with the exception for the occasional factory. The US public was relieved by the sharp critique and debunking of Professor Herbert Hoover's suggestion that the Potsdam policy be more leniently interpreted and German economy partly reconstructed.

The series involved a team of heroes that could transform into sharks and other marine animals and resembled the series ThunderCats and SilverHawks, also developed by Rankin/Bass. The series lasted one season with 26 episodes and was part of The Comic Strip show, which consisted of four animated shorts: TigerSharks, Street Frogs, The Mini-Monsters, and Karate Kat. The animation was provided by Pacific Animation Corporation. Warner Bros. Animation currently owns the series, as they own the 1974-89 Rankin/Bass library, which was incorporated into the merger of Lorimar-Telepictures and Warner Bros. However, no DVD or streaming release of the series has been available worldwide as of mid 2020. Production and development Rankin/Bass followed up their successful ThunderCats and SilverHawks series with this series about a team of powered up man/marine form hybrids called the \\"TigerSharks\\". This third series also featured many of the same voice actors who had worked on ThunderCats and SilverHawks including Larry Kenney, Peter Newman, Earl Hammond, Doug Preis and Bob McFadden. Story The members of the TigerShark team were humans who had to use a device called the Fish Tank in order to transform between human and powered-up marine forms. The TigerSharks' base was a spaceship that could also function underwater. The ship was called the SARK and contained the Fish Tank, along with other research facilities. The action took place on the fictional world of Water-O (pronounced Wah-tare-oh), which was almost completely covered by water. The planet was inhabited by a race of fish-men called the Waterians. The TigerSharks arrived there on a research mission and ended up serving as the protectors of the planet against the evil T-Ray, who had arrived there beforehand. Characters TigerSharks Protectors of Water-O, the team members are: * Mako (voiced by Peter Newman) - A gifted scuba diver, he is considered the field leader of the TigerSharks. Mako is not only a good mediator, but also an excellent fighter. He transforms into a human/mako shark hybrid, which grants him incredible speed underwater. Mako also uses his forearm fins and head fin to slice through metal. * Walro (voiced by Earl Hammond) - The scientific and mechanical genius who created the Fish Tank. He acts as the advisor of the team and is very respected by his comrades. Walro turns into a human/walrus hybrid. * Rodolfo \\"Dolph\\" (voiced by Larry Kenney) - Second-in-command and also an experienced scuba diver. Dolph has a knack for jokes and fooling around, but he knows when to joke and when to work. Dolph turns into a human/dolphin hybrid, which makes him very maneuverable underwater. * Octavia (voiced by Camille Bonora) - Captain of the SARK, communications technician and main strategist. Octavia turns into a human/octopus hybrid (with tentacles instead of hair). * Lorca - the team‚Äôs mechanic and often helps Walro to repair or build new machines. He‚Äôs also the team‚Äôs strongest member. Lorca turns into a human/orca hybrid . * Bronc - A teenager who works as an assistant in the SARK, he is very adventurous and sometimes reckless. He turns into a human/seahorse hybrid; hence his name, which is derived from \\"Bronco\\". * Angel - Bronc's sister. She, along with her brother, is the younger member of the team, She works as an assistant in the SARK and is more serious and responsible than her brother. She turns into a human/angelfish hybrid, hence her name. * Gupp - the TigerSharks' pet Basset Hound. While his name might imply that he turns into a guppy, his features, including flipper-shaped legs and pin teeth, more closely resemble a seal or sea lion. Villains The show featured two major antagonists, both with teams of followers. They are: * T-Ray - T-Ray is a human/manta ray hybrid-type creature. He and his Mantanas arrived on Water-O because their home planet had dried up. In seeking to conquer Water-O, he freed Captain Bizzarly and his crew from their iced prison on Seaberia. He is bent on conquering the Waterians and destroying the TigerSharks. He and his assistants cannot survive outside the water without using water breathing apparatus. ** Mantanas - The fish-like minions of T-Ray *** Wall-Eye (voiced by Peter Newman) A human/frog hybrid who seems to be T-Ray's right hand man. *** Shad - A human/grouper hybrid with a bad temper. *** Dredge - A fishman who has a pet purple eel on his back. *** Carper - A merman with a frog-like face. Identical Twin Brother of Weakfish. Both him and his brother whine and complain about everything. He has green skin. *** Weakfish - A merman with a frog-like face. Identical Twin Brother of Carper. Both him and his brother whine and complain about everything. He has purple skin. * Captain Bizzarly - A pirate with aquaphobia who controlled all crime-related activities on the vast oceans of Water-O until the Waterians froze him and his crew in ice many years ago. T-Ray freed Bizzarly and his crew expecting them to join forces. However, Bizzarly promptly betrayed T-Ray. Bizzarly now constantly tries to get rid of the TigerSharks and regain control of the oceans of Water-O. ** Dragonstein - Captain Bizzarly's pet sea dragon. ** Long John Silverfish - A human-like being who has a rat-like mouth. ** Spike Marlin - A human pirate with a wrinkle face who carries a spear-like staff. ** Soulmate - The only female member of Captain Bizzarly's pirate crew. She has a appearance of a female samurai. ** Lump - A blob creature who resembles slime. ** Grunt - A overweight humanoid who makes grunting sounds like a ape. In other media The TigerSharks made a cameo in an episode of the 2011 ThunderCats remake called \\"Legacy.\\" They are among the animals that were forced to work under Mumm-Ra. The TigerSharks, along with other characters from its companion cartoons within The Comic Strip, along with characters from sibling series ThunderCats and SilverHawks, were all represented in a live stage show for children that toured the USA in 1987. https://www.doubledumbassonyou.com/tag/rankinbass/ References External links * 1987 American television series debuts 1987 American television series endings 1980s American animated television series First-run syndicated television programs in the United States Television series by Lorimar Television Television series by Warner Bros.

Research in this field is driven by the need to functionalize fullerenes and tune their properties. For example, fullerene is notoriously insoluble and adding a suitable group can enhance solubility. By adding a polymerizable group, a fullerene polymer can be obtained. Functionalized fullerenes are divided into two classes: exohedral fullerenes with substituents outside the cage and endohedral fullerenes with trapped molecules inside the cage. This article covers the chemistry of these so-called \\"buckyballs,\\" while the chemistry of carbon nanotubes is covered in carbon nanotube chemistry. Chemical properties of fullerenes  Fullerene or C60 is soccer-ball-shaped or Ih with 12 pentagons and 20 hexagons. According to Euler's theorem these 12 pentagons are required for closure of the carbon network consisting of n hexagons and C60 is the first stable fullerene because it is the smallest possible to obey this rule. In this structure none of the pentagons make contact with each other. Both C60 and its relative C70 obey this so-called isolated pentagon rule (IPR). The next homologue C84 has 24 IPR isomers of which several are isolated and another 51,568 non-IPR isomers. Non- IPR fullerenes have thus far only been isolated as endohedral fullerenes such as Tb3N@C84 with two fused pentagons at the apex of an egg-shaped cage. or as fullerenes with exohedral stabilization such as C50Cl10 and reportedly C60H8. Fullerenes with less than 60 carbons do not obey isolated pentagon rule (IPR). Because of the molecule's spherical shape the carbon atoms are highly pyramidalized, which has far-reaching consequences for reactivity. It is estimated that strain energy constitutes 80% of the heat of formation. The conjugated carbon atoms respond to deviation from planarity by orbital rehybridization of the sp¬≤ orbitals and œÄ orbitals to a sp2.27 orbital with a gain in p-character. The p lobes extend further outside the surface than they do into the interior of the sphere and this is one of the reasons a fullerene is electronegative. The other reason is that the empty low-lying œÄ* orbitals also have a high s character. The double bonds in fullerene are not all the same. Two groups can be identified: 30 so-called [6,6] double bonds connect two hexagons and 60 [5,6] bonds connect a hexagon and a pentagon. Of the two the [6,6] bonds are shorter with more double-bond character and therefore a hexagon is often represented as a cyclohexatriene and a pentagon as a pentalene or [5]radialene. In other words, although the carbon atoms in fullerene are all conjugated the superstructure is not a super aromatic compound. The X-ray diffraction bond length values are 139.1 pm for the [6,6] bond and 145.5 pm for the [5,6] bond. C60 fullerene has 60 œÄ electrons but a closed shell configuration requires 72 electrons. The fullerene is able to acquire the missing electrons by reaction with potassium to form first the salt and then the In this compound the bond length alternation observed in the parent molecule has vanished. Fullerene reactions Fullerenes tend to react as electrophiles. An additional driving force is relief of strain when double bonds become saturated. Key in this type of reaction is the level of functionalization i.e. monoaddition or multiple additions and in case of multiple additions their topological relationships (new substituents huddled together or evenly spaced). In conformity with IUPAC rules, the terms methanofullerene are used to indicate the ring-closed (cyclopropane) fullerene derivatives, and fulleroid to ring-open (methanoannulene) structures. Nucleophilic additions Fullerenes react as electrophiles with a host of nucleophiles in nucleophilic additions. The intermediary formed carbanion is captured by another electrophile. Examples of nucleophiles are Grignard reagents and organolithium reagents. For example, the reaction of C60 with methylmagnesium chloride stops quantitatively at the penta-adduct with the methyl groups centered around a cyclopentadienyl anion which is subsequently protonated. Another nucleophilic reaction is the Bingel reaction. Fullerene reacts with chlorobenzene and aluminium chloride in a Friedel-Crafts alkylation type reaction. In this hydroarylation the reaction product is the 1,2-addition adduct (Ar-CC-H). Pericyclic reactions The [6,6] bonds of fullerenes react as dienes or dienophiles in cycloadditions for instance Diels-Alder reactions. 4-membered rings can be obtained by [2+2]cycloadditions for instance with benzyne. An example of a 1,3-dipolar cycloaddition to a 5-membered ring is the Prato reaction. Hydrogenations Fullerenes are easily hydrogenated by several methods. Examples of hydrofullerenes are C60H18 and C60H36. However, completely hydrogenated C60H60 is only hypothetical because of large strain. Highly hydrogenated fullerenes are not stable, as prolonged hydrogenation of fullerenes by direct reaction with hydrogen gas at high temperature conditions results in cage fragmentation. At the final reaction stage this causes collapse of cage structure with formation of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons. Oxidations Although more difficult than reduction, oxidation of fullerene is possible for instance with oxygen and osmium tetraoxide. Hydroxylations Fullerenes can be hydroxylated to fullerenols or fullerols. Water solubility depends on the total number of hydroxyl groups that can be attached. One method is fullerene reaction in diluted sulfuric acid and potassium nitrate to C60(OH)15. Another method is reaction in diluted sodium hydroxide catalysed by TBAH adding 24 to 26 hydroxyl groups. Hydroxylation has also been reported using solvent-free NaOH / hydrogen peroxide. C60(OH)8 was prepared using a multistep procedure starting from a mixed peroxide fullerene. The maximum number of hydroxyl groups that can be attached (hydrogen peroxide method) stands at 36‚Äì40. Electrophilic additions Fullerenes react in electrophilic additions as well. The reaction with bromine can add up to 24 bromine atoms to the sphere. The record holder for fluorine addition is C60F48. According to in silico predictions the as yet elusive C60F60 may have some of the fluorine atoms in endo positions (pointing inwards) and may resemble a tube more than it does a sphere. Eliminations Protocols have been investigated for removing substituents via eliminations after they have served their purpose. Examples are the retro-Bingel reaction and the retro-Prato reaction. Carbene additions Fullerenes react with carbenes to methanofullerenes. The reaction of fullerene with dichlorocarbene (created by sodium trichloroacetate pyrolysis) was first reported in 1993. A single addition takes place along a [6,6] bond. Radical additions Fullerenes can be considered radical scavengers. With a simple hydrocarbon radical such as the t-butyl radical obtained by thermolysis or photolysis from a suitable precursor the tBuC60 radical is formed that can be studied. The unpaired electron does not delocalize over the entire sphere but takes up positions in the vicinity of the tBu substituent. Fullerenes as ligands Fullerene is a ligand in organometallic chemistry. The [6,6] double bond is electron-deficient and usually forms metallic bonds with Œ∑ = 2 hapticity. Bonding modes such as Œ∑ = 5 or Œ∑ = 6 can be induced by modification of the coordination sphere. *C60 fullerene reacts with tungsten hexacarbonyl W(CO)6 to the (Œ∑¬≤-C60)W(CO)5 complex in a hexane solution in direct sunlight. Variants Open-cage fullerenes A part of fullerene research is devoted to so-called open-cage fullerenes whereby one or more bonds are removed chemically exposing an orifice. In this way it is possible to insert into it small molecules such as hydrogen, helium or lithium. The first such open-cage fullerene was reported in 1995. In endohedral hydrogen fullerenes the opening, hydrogen insertion and closing back up has already been demonstrated. Heterofullerenes In heterofullerenes at least one carbon atom is replaced by another element. Based on spectroscopy, substitutions have been reported with boron (borafullerenes), nitrogen (azafullerenes), oxygen, arsenic, germanium, phosphorus, silicon, iron, copper, nickel, rhodium and iridium. Reports on isolated heterofullerenes are limited to those based on nitrogen and oxygen. Fullerene dimers The C60 fullerene dimerizes in a formal [2+2] cycloaddition to a C120 bucky dumbbell in the solid state by mechanochemistry (high-speed vibration milling) with potassium cyanide as a catalyst. The trimer has also been reported using 4-aminopyridine as catalyst (4% yield) and observed with scanning tunneling microscopy as a monolayer.  Synthesis   Multistep fullerene synthesis  Although the procedure for the synthesis of the C60 fullerene is well established (generation of a large current between two nearby graphite electrodes in an inert atmosphere) a 2002 study described an organic synthesis of the compound starting from simple organic compounds.The numbers in image correspond to the way the new carbon carbon bonds are formed. :Multistep fullerene synthesis In the final step a large polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon consisting of 13 hexagons and three pentagons was submitted to flash vacuum pyrolysis at 1100 ¬∞C and 0.01 Torr. The three carbon chlorine bonds served as free radical incubators and the ball was stitched up in a no-doubt complex series of radical reactions. The chemical yield was low: 0.1 to 1%. A small percentage of fullerenes is formed in any process which involves burning of hydrocarbons, e.g. in candle burning. The yield through a combustion method is often above 1%. The method proposed above does not provide any advantage for synthesis of fullerenes compared to the usual combustion method, and therefore, the organic synthesis of fullerenes remains a challenge for chemistry. A similar exercise aimed at construction of a C78 cage in 2008 (but leaving out the precursor's halogens) did not result in a sufficient yield but at least the introduction of Stone Wales defects could be ruled out. C60 synthesis through a fluorinated fullerene precursor was reported in 2013 Purification Fullerene purification is the process of obtaining a fullerene compound free of contamination. In fullerene production mixtures of C60, C70 and higher homologues are always formed. Fullerene purification is key to fullerene science and determines fullerene prices and the success of practical applications of fullerenes. The first available purification method for C60 fullerene was by HPLC from which small amounts could be generated at large expense. A practical laboratory-scale method for purification of soot enriched in C60 and C70 starts with extraction in toluene followed by filtration with a paper filter. The solvent is evaporated and the residue (the toluene-soluble soot fraction) redissolved in toluene and subjected to column chromatography. C60 elutes first with a purple color and C70 is next displaying a reddish- brown color. In nanotube processing the established purification method for removing amorphous carbon and metals is by competitive oxidation (often a sulfuric acid / nitric acid mixture). It is assumed that this oxidation creates oxygen containing groups (hydroxyl, carbonyl, carboxyl) on the nanotube surface which electrostatically stabilize them in water and which can later be utilized in chemical functionalization. One report reveals that the oxygen containing groups in actuality combine with carbon contaminations absorbed to the nanotube wall that can be removed by a simple base wash. Cleaned nanotubes are reported to have reduced D/G ratio indicative of less functionalization, and the absence of oxygen is also apparent from IR spectroscopy and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy.  Experimental purification strategies  A recent kilogram-scale fullerene purification strategy was demonstrated by Nagata et al. In this method C60 was separated from a mixture of C60, C70 and higher fullerene compounds by first adding the amidine compound DBU to a solution of the mixture in 1,2,3-trimethylbenzene. DBU as it turns out only reacts to C70 fullerenes and higher which reaction products separate out and can be removed by filtration. C60 fullerenes do not have any affinity for DBU and are subsequently isolated. Other diamine compounds like DABCO do not share this selectivity. C60 but not C70 forms a 1:2 inclusion compound with cyclodextrin (CD). A separation method for both fullerenes based on this principle is made possible by anchoring cyclodextrin to colloidal gold particles through a sulfur-sulfur bridge. The Au/CD compound is very stable and soluble in water and selectively extracts C60 from the insoluble mixture after refluxing for several days. The C70 fullerene component is then removed by simple filtration. C60 is driven out from the Au/CD compound by adding adamantol which has a higher affinity for the cyclodextrin cavity. Au/CD is completely recycled when adamantol in turn is driven out by adding ethanol and ethanol removed by evaporation; 50 mg of Au/CD captures 5 mg of C60 fullerene.

At the time of the X6 being launched onto the Australian market it was quite an advanced design in comparison to the other competitors from Ford, Holden and Chrysler, whose rear-wheel drive, conventionally sprung underpinnings dominated the market at the time. Design These cars were offered as an Australian replacement to the Austin 1800. Their boxy styling, developed for the car to be a proper six- seater, was all-new, but a few features, including the doors, were retained. These doors however utilised recessed door handles, to satisfy Australian Design Rules safety concerns. The body had an exceptionally stiff torsional rigidity, a trait it inherited from the 1800s. The standard powerplant for the X6 range was a transverse mounted 2.2L OHC straight-six engine, based on the 1500/1750 Austin Maxi unit. At the time of the X6's introduction, it would have been the only car in production with a transverse straight-six-cylinder engine in the world. The Tasman's single carburettor configuration produced and the Kimberley with its extra carburettor. Both were sold with either a four-speed manual or three-speed automatic transmission. Due to the application in this car, its engine would also be used in ADO17 Austin 2200/Morris 2200/Wolseley Six, and later in the ADO71 Princess. In Australia, this engine, enlarged to 2.6-litres also appeared in the Morris Marina and Leyland P76. The differences generally between the Austin Kimberley and Tasman were in their trim. The Kimberley was an upmarket model, with a plush interior and four rectangular headlights, while the Tasman had basic vinyl trim, and a simplified grille with two round headlights. Mark II versions of both the Tasman and the Kimberley were introduced in 1971. The X6 was discontinued in 1972 with a total of 12,194 examples sold in Australia. The X6 Tasman and Kimberley models were given a model designation code of YDO13 with the Mark II models coded YDO19.BMC-Leyland Australia Heritage Group, Building Cars in Australia - Morris, Austin, BMC and Leyland 1950-1975, pages 216 & 217 In the early 1970s, British Leyland had an idea of a medium-sized Vanden Plas model, based on the Australian X6 models. Had the car entered production (there was a running prototype made), it would have had a formalised Wolseley 1800/2200 front end, the rest of the car's bodyshell being X6 based. The car is now in private ownership, one of very few prototypes to leave a factory. A second proposal was a coup√© utility variant (codenamed YDO14), to replace the Australian developed Austin 1800 Utility. Although this model never reached production, Barry Anderson (ex-Leyland Australia engineer) states that two were built, one served as a \\"work hack\\" for Leyland Australia while the other was crash tested for ADR (Australian Design Rules) compliance. The surviving black work hack was offered for private sale in Melbourne in 1990, at which time it was no longer roadworthy or registered. File:Austin Tasman (15100758751).jpgAustin Tasman File:1972 Australian Austin Kimberly Mk II.jpg1972 Austin Kimberly Mk II File:Morris Tasman (X6) (13972020777).jpgMorris Tasman (New Zealand) File:1971 Morris Kimberley X6 (29891062650).jpg1971 Morris Kimberley (New Zealand) Marketing In the marketplace, the cars were intended as competitors to the more established larger Holden Kingswood, Ford Falcon and Chrysler Valiant models. However, the complexities of front-wheel-drive were an issue against the car, and compounded with the lack of body variations and models, the X6 was never a serious threat to the dominance of the rear-wheel-drive and multiple-body Holdens, Fords and Chryslers. Leyland Tasman was the standard model with single round headlamps in the grill. The Leyland KIMBERLEY was the deluxe model with twin rectangular headlamps in the grill. Due to this, Leyland Australia developed a much larger rear-wheel-drive car to replace the X6, and compete directly with the Holden, Ford and Chrysler models (in both straight-6 and V8 forms), the Leyland P76, which was introduced to Australia and New Zealand in 1973. The Leyland P76 had quality issues while the company was having issues also. When introduced, a notable selling point of the X6 was the Tasman's two bench seats, which could seat six (the plusher Kimberley had separate front seats and sat five). One advertisement for the New Zealand specification Morris Tasman X6 proclaimed that the bench seats could hold the driver and seven schoolboy rugby players. Whilst this may seem an exaggerated claim by its makers, the 1800/Kimberley platform did provide excellent passenger room for a vehicle of such a compact outer dimensions, a legacy of Sir Alec Issigonis who strived for increased cabin space on a small footprint as witness the Mini, 1100, 1800 and Maxi. Vehicles A white Morris Tasman X6 is preserved at the Wanaka Transport Museum, in New Zealand. Fittingly, while the cars themselves are moved constantly around the museum, it is always shown parked alongside an Austin 1800. Two Austin Tasman utility vehicles were built, one served as a 'work hack' for Leyland Australia while the other was crash tested. In the late 1980s, in New Zealand, a Morris Kimberley had a unique stretch-limousine conversion, and was spray-painted pink.

Due to the significant gradations of climate and geography found in the gorge, this AVA exhibits a wide range of terroir in a relatively small region; it is marketed as a \\"world of wine in 40 miles\\". Description  The Columbia Gorge AVA consists of four counties; Hood River and Wasco counties in Oregon, and Skamania and Klickitat counties in Washington. The region stretches from Hood River, Oregon and Underwood, Washington in the west, to Rowena, Oregon and Lyle, Washington in the east. It includes the river valleys of the Hood River and Deschutes River in Oregon, and the Klickitat River and White Salmon River in Washington. As this region lies to the east of the summits of nearby Mount Hood and Mount Adams, it is in rain shadow of these Cascade volcanoes. The region is significantly drier than the Portland metropolitan area to the west. Annual precipitation ranges from at the western end of the range, to only in the eastern part. Elevation in the region varies considerably, increasing as one travels from the Columbia River into the plateaus on either side, and the strong Columbia Gorge winds also play a factor in the region's climate. This allows a wide variety of grapes to be grown in the Columbia Gorge. The region has nearly 40 vineyards, growing a wide variety of grapes, including Syrah, Pinot noir, Chardonnay, Gew√ºrztraminer, Zinfandel, Cabernet Sauvignon, Pinot gris, Riesling, and Sangiovese.

Introduction Relevant alternatives theory was primarily developed by Fred Dretske. It states that \\"knowing a true proposition one believes at a time requires being able to rule out relevant alternatives to that proposition at that time.\\"Stanley (2005), p. 17. One way that Dretske attempts to motivate RAT is with examples, such as the following: > You take your son to the zoo, see several zebras, and, when questioned by > your son, tell him they are zebras. Do you know they are zebras? Well, most > of us would have little hesitation saying that we did know this. We know > what zebras look like, and, besides, this is the city zoo and the animals > are in a pen clearly marked \\"Zebras.\\" Yet, something's being a zebra implies > that it is not a mule and, in particular, not a mule cleverly disguised by > the zoo authorities to look like a zebra. Do you know that these animals are > not mules cleverly disguised by the zoo authorities to look like > zebras?Dretske (1970), p. 1015-16. The relevant alternatives theorist claims that one does know that they are zebras, provided that any relevant alternatives (e.g. that they are lions, that they are mules, etc.) can be ruled out and any other alternatives (e.g. the possibility of the zoo authorities cleverly disguising mules to look like zebras) are not relevant in the context in which knowledge is being attributed. The important question, however, is: What makes an alternative relevant? Relation to contextualism Jason Stanley has argued that Dretske's relevant alternative theory was the starting point for the development of contextualism in epistemology, specifically with the subsequent work done by Alvin Goldman and Gail Stine.

Histria is derived from the Latin word \\"Hister\\", meaning \\"Danube\\", the river the city was located near, and \\"-ia\\", a suffix added to a word to signify that it was a location or place, as in Gallia or Iberia. Altogether Histria means \\"On the Danube\\", \\"Located near (or by) - The Danube\\". It was the first urban settlement on Romanian territory when founded by Milesian settlers in the 7th century BC. It was under Roman rule from the 1st to 3rd centuries AD. Invasions during the 7th century AD rendered it indefensible, and the city was abandoned. In antiquity, it also bore the names Istropolis, Istriopolis, and Histriopolis (·º∏œÉœÑœÅœåœÄŒøŒªŒπœÇ, ·º∏œÉœÑœÅŒØŒ± œÄœåŒªŒπœÇ). Histriopolis was a fort in the Roman province of Moesia. As Tabula Peutingeriana shows it is situated between Tomis and Ad Stoma; 11 miles from Tomis and 9 miles from Ad Stoma. History Established by Milesian settlers in order to facilitate trade with the native Getae, it is considered the oldest urban settlement on Romanian territory. Scymnus of Chios (ca 110 BC), dated its founding to 630 BC, while Eusebius of Caesarea set it during the time of the 33rd Olympic Games (657 ‚Äì 656 BC). The earliest documented currency on Romanian territory was an 8-gram silver drachma, issued by the city around 480 BC. Archaeological evidence seems to confirm that all trade with the interior followed the foundation of Histria. Traders reached the interior via Histria and the Danube valley, demonstrated by finds of Attic black-figure pottery, coins, ornamental objects, an Ionian lebes and many fragments of amphoras. Amphoras have been found in great quantity at Histria, some imported but some local. Local pottery was produced following establishment of the colony and certainly before the mid-6th century. During the archaic and classical periods, when Histria flourished, it was situated near fertile arable land. It served as a port of trade soon after its establishment, with fishing and agriculture as additional sources of income. By 100 AD, however, fishing had become the main source of Istrian revenue. Around 30 AD, Histria came under Roman domination. During the Roman period from the 1st to 3rd centuries AD, temples were built for the Roman gods, besides a public bath and houses for the wealthy. Altogether, it was in continuous existence for some 14 centuries, starting with the Greek period up to the Roman-Byzantine period. The Halmyris bay where was the city founded was closed by sand deposits and access to the Black Sea gradually was cut. Trade continued until the 6th century AD. The invasion of the Avars and the Slavs in the 7th century AD almost entirely destroyed the fortress, and the Istrians dispersed; the name and the city disappeared. Geographic setting Ancient Histria was situated on a peninsula, about east of the modern Romanian commune of Istria, on the Dobruja coast. The ancient seashore has since been transformed into the western shore of Sinoe Lake, as the Danube's silt deposits formed a shoal which closed off the ancient coastline. The current Sinoe Lake was at the time the open northern bay, while another bay on the southern shore served as the port. The acropolis with sanctuaries was established on the highest point of the coastal plain. The settlement itself, erected in the 6th century, was 1/2 mile (800 meters) to the west of the acropolis. The settlement had stone paved streets and was protected by strong wall. Water was collected along 12.5 mile (20 km) long aqueducts. Archaeology The ruins of the settlement were first identified in 1868 by French archaeologist Ernest Desjardins. Archaeological excavations were started by Vasile P√¢rvan in 1914, and continued after his death in 1927 by teams of archaeologists led successively by Scarlat and Marcelle Lambrino (1928‚Äì1943), Emil Condurachi (1949‚Äì1971), Dionisie Pippidi (1971-1989), Petre Alexandrescu (1990-1999), Alexandru Suceveanu (1990-2009), Alexandru Avram and Mircea Angelescu (starting 2010). The Histria Museum, founded in 1982, exhibits some of these finds. The excavation project and site also features prominently in the film The Ister.The Ister - Official Site. Archeological research in Histria managed to identify and classify several layers on site. The layer stratification can be divided primarily between the Archaic and Classical periods: Archaic Greek layers The ancient Greek city covered around 60 hectares. There are very few written references to the archaic city and archeological research provides the main historical resource. The main deity was Apollo Ietros (The Healer). Zeus (Gr. Polieus) was the protector deity of the city and Aphrodita was also confirmed by archeological research. Historians believe all six Milesian tribes (Greek: phylai) were represented in the colony, yet only four tribes are attested to: the Aigikoreis, Argadeis, Boreis and Geleontes. The only clue concerning the government of the city was given by Aristotle in Politica. Thanks to his comment, it is clear that the first government of Histria was an oligarchy. From an economic point of view, the town was developed around port-related activities. Archaic Greek layer I (650‚Äì600 BC) The Apollo sculpture's inscription. After the stage of emporium, a polis was founded soon after 650 BC. Temples and dwellings of this time were discovered. By the beginning of the VIth century Histria was already a prosperous colony. Archaic Greek layer II (600‚Äì550 BC) During this period a new city wall was built around the city, probably in connection with the frequent raids of the scythians. The Acropolis started to be defended by a wall, discovered by Sc. Lambrino. Another city wall was running around the western Plateau, defending also the port. Archaic Greek layer III (550‚Äì500 BC) The Archaic age of Histria is finishing with a massive destruction on the occasion, most probably, of an expedition of the Persian general Mardonios (Mardonios (old Persian Marduniya, Persian Mrdunya, Greek ŒúŒ±œÅŒ¥œåŒΩŒπŒøœÇ (Mard√≥nios), Latin Mardonius; ‚Ä† 479 B. C. during the battle of Plateaea). Another theory says the destruction of the city has taken place, probably in 512 BC, when Darius I undertook a war against the Scythians.Herodotus, Book IV. It is still unclear if this fact is connected to the Persian expedition led by Darius, to the Scythians followers of the Persian army during the retreat or to the expedition of Mardonios. Classical Greek layers During the classical period, there was continuity in the cults of Apollo Ietros; Zeus (Gr. Polieus) and Aphrodita. During the classical period many written sources describe the political organisation of the area. The Odrysian kingdom was involved in fighting with the Scythians ruled by Ariapeithes and Histria was situated between the two kingdoms. Due to that, most probably, Histria town was forced to join the Delian League. In the 5th century BC, these colonies were under the influence of the Delian League, passing in this period from oligarchy to democracy.Aristotle, Politics, (V,6 ). From an economic point of view it was during this era that the first Histrian coins were minted: a didrachma, oboli and bronze coins. Classical Greek layer I (500‚Äì425 BC) The town was flourishing in the period of Athens's Peloponnesian Wars when the Athenian fleet came to the Greek colonies placed on the shores of the Pontos Euxeinos (Black Sea) to collect the contributions for the Delian Treasure (Thucydides). A new wall was built to protect a wider area then before, around the Histrian Acropolis, probably in connection with the democratic \\"revolution\\" mentioned by Aristotle in The Politics (cap. 5), referring to the change of the Histrian constitution, evolving from oligarchy to democracy. The city wall, protecting the settlement and the port, was repaired. Classical Greek layer II (425‚Äì350 BC) The town was dismantled for a second time in the 4th century BC, during the war between the Scythian king Ateas and Macedonian king Philip II.Justin, Epitome of Pompeius Trogus, 9.2 who destroyed the city walls protecting the Acropolis and the one protecting the whole town. Hellenistic layers Remains of the grand deity temple. During the Hellenistic period, there was continuity in the cult of Apollo Ietros, Zeus (Gr. Polieus) and Aphrodita. A new temple for a grand deity was built. There is also evidence of the cult of Athena, Poseidon, Helikonios, Taurios, Demetra, Hermes Agoraios, Heracles, Asclepios, Dioscurii and others. A new wall also appears, protecting a 10 ha area. During the Hellenistic period Histria had become an important supplier of grain for Greece.Demosthenes, Contra Leptinem, 466, 31: the grain supply from the Black Sea is larger than from all other ports. However, the economic power of Histria was represented by trade.Polybios, 4,38,4: With respect to goods for living, the Pontic region supplies cattle and slaves, in large numbers and of a proven quality. With respect to luxury goods, they supply us with honey, wax and salted fish. In exchange they receive from our regions the commodities of oil and all kinds of wines. With grain we trade, when in need they supply us, at other times we supply them. In the Hellenistic period, the gymnasium and the theater were erected. Hellenistic layer I (350‚Äì300 BC) The town was once again destroyed around 339 BC. During the period 313‚Äì309 BC, a rebellion of Pontic towns took place.Diodorus Siculus, Miletus however awarded Histrians equal political rights, or so-called isopoliteia. Hellenistic layer II (300‚Äì175 BC) Around 260 BC, Byzantium was involved in a dispute with Histria and Callatis (modern Mangalia) over Tomis emporion (ŒïŒºœÄœåœÅŒπŒøŒΩ, market) (i.e. modern Constan≈£a).Memnon, History of Heracleia, 13 Another destruction of the city, somewhere around 175 BC, was most probably wreaked by Bastarni passing through after being called upon by Macedonian king Philip V or Perseus to reinforce the army. Hellenistic layer III (175‚Äì100 BC) Mithridates installed a military garrison in Histria, which probably caused the third destruction of the city in the Hellenistic period. During the rule of Mithridates staters are minted in Histria. Hellenistic layer IV (100‚Äì20 BC) Burebista arrived in Dobruja. > (Gaius Antonius Hybrida)...while governor of Macedonia, had inflicted many > injuries upon the subject territory as well as upon that which was in > alliance with Rome, and had suffered many disasters in return. 2 For after > ravaging the possessions of the Dardanians and their neighbours, he did not > dare to await their attack, but pretending to retire with his cavalry for > some other purpose, took to flight; in this way the enemy surrounded his > infantry and forcibly drove them out of the country, even taking away their > plunder from them. 3 When he tried the same tactics on the allies in Moesia, > he was defeated near the city of the Istrians by the Bastarnian Scythians > who came to their aid; and thereupon he ran away...Dio Cassius XXXVIII 10.2 The Hellenistic period was ended by Marcus Antonius who was in charge of the eastern Roman government, and was defeated by Octavian at Actium. Roman layers A Roman sundial Early Roman layer IA (30‚Äì100 AD) Continuous with the Hellenistic period. A new thermae (Thermae I) was built. This period is considered by historians, thanks to two inscribed artifacts, as the second founding of the city. Early Roman layer IB (100‚Äì170 AD) In around 170 AD, a part of the town was destroyed. Early Roman layer IC (170‚Äì250 AD) The town suffered serious destruction from which it never recovered. The main theory is that it was destroyed by an invasion of Goths and Carpi. Another theory presumes that the town was destroyed in an earthquake.

The school is situated on the banks of the River Boyne, and entry to the school is via Convent Road (walking or driving), or the Boyne Road (walking only). Loreto Secondary School, St. Michael's opened in 1833. Grounds The Loreto Sisters St. Michael's Convent adjoins the main and oldest part of the school, with a day-care centre for the elderly situated at the side. The staff numbers approximately 52 which includes two career guidance counsellors, two home school links/pastoral guides, teachers of academic subjects, specialist teachers, and ancillary staff. Mission statement The school's mission statement reads: \\"Within a positive environment based on Christian values, and with a strong social justice focus, St. Michael‚Äôs students are encouraged to avail of all opportunities to develop to their true creative, academic, personal and spiritual potential.\\" Curriculum In the early 1980s a decision made by the sisters to focus on justice as a central part of the education of young people led the Navan school to look at the place of social justice in the school curriculum. As a result of this, a special post was created to promote social justice in the school. Initially this involved one teacher but now has developed into a committee involving teachers and students. \\"Social justice week\\" is held in March every year. During this week guest speakers are invited into school to highlight issues of poverty and inequality, racism and refugees, human rights and care of the environment. Adi Roche, Founder and Executive Director of Chernobyl Children's Project, gave the opening address at this year's Social Justice Week, from 6 March-10 March. Extra curriculum They provide a variety of sports at both competitive and non-competitive levels.

Howard (born 1942) is an American politician. She is a former Democratic member of the Illinois House of Representatives, representing the 34th District from 1995 to 2012. In 2008, Howard was named as one of Utne Reader magazine's ‚Äú50 Visionaries Who Are Changing the World.‚Äù She is also a convicted felon. Originally elected from the 32nd district, her district became the 34th in 2002, following redistricting. She resigned from office in July 2012. Federal conviction Federal authorities caught Howard as part of a sweeping FBI probe into Illinois grant money that began in 2010. She had helped found Let's Talk, Let's Test Foundation, a nonprofit organization that sought to educate the black community about HIV/AIDS and provide testing services. The foundation received $1.7 million in state grant money in 2007. Its executive director, Lloyd Kelly, who also worked as one of Howard's aides, was indicted after spending some of that money on a home, football tickets and alcohol, and to pay for interns at Howard's legislative office. She had also started a scholarship fund aimed at helping minority students learn digital technology. She hosted an annual golf outing to raise money for it. Prosecutors said she raised about $76,700 between 2003 and 2007 but gave out only $12,500. She spent about $28,000 on personal and political expenses, which she was eventually ordered to pay back as part of her plea deal. It was unclear where the rest of the money went. A contribution mailed to her for one of the golf outings led to the mail fraud charge. Howard was an Illinois House member at the time of the crime. Confronted with the evidence, Howard waived indictment and pleaded guilty to mail fraud on July 24, 2013. She was sentenced to a term of three months in prison.

View from Lummi Island. Lummi Island lies at the southwest corner of Whatcom County, Washington, United States, between the mainland part of the county and offshore San Juan County. The Lummi Indian Reservation is situated on a peninsula east of the island, but does not include Lummi Island. The island has a land area of and had a population of 822 as of the 2000 census. The population nearly doubles in summer when property owners from both Canada and the U.S. arrive for summer fun and relaxation. The island is accessible by a 20-car ferry, the Whatcom Chief, run by Whatcom County Public Works. It is a 6-minute passage from Gooseberry Point on the mainland to the island. Facilities on the island include one general store, two restaurants, several bed and breakfast houses, a small library, post office, fire station, one church, a Salvation Army camp, and a vintage 1919 elementary school. The Beach Store Cafe is a popular local hangout with a small bar, and serves seafood and traditional caf√© fare. The Willows Inn serves more expensive fare, featuring seasonal treats from island farms and fishers. The historic Lummi Island Congregational Church has a quiet, wooded cemetery. Lummi Island is best known for its unique reefnet salmon fishery, eclectic population of artists, picturesque seascapes, and rural setting. Its narrow, scenic and winding roads are popular with bicyclers. A trail to Lummi Mountain takes hikers through the Baker Preserve to stunning high views of the San Juan and Gulf islands. The trail is maintained by the Lummi Island Heritage Trust. Public education for island residents is provided by the Ferndale School District. It operates one elementary school (K-5) on the island, Beach Elementary School. Middle and high school students attend schools on the mainland. History The island was originally called Sa nam a o (\\"High Mountain\\")Island Vacation Rentals: Lummi Island History and Skallaham by the native Lummi people. In 1792 Spanish explorers dubbed it Isla de Pacheco, and British colonists later called it McLoughlin Island. In 1853, the U.S. National Geodetic Survey charted the island as Lummi, naming it after the local tribe. Later British and Americans adopted this term.Friends of Island Library: A Very Brief History of Lummi Island and the Islanders , 1998 Some theories suggest the name was derived from a Lummi-language word. The island's post office was established by the United States government in 1882. At that time the town and post office were named \\"Beach\\", but today island mail is addressed to \\"Lummi Island, Washington\\", though the Beach School and Beach Store Cafe retain the older name. By 1919, the Nooksack Fish Packing Company also had a cannery on the Island at Sunrise Cove. Lummi Island Quarry A rock quarry on the island was operated intermittently, but major operations started in 1964. By 1990 the pit was 3 acres and mining rights were sold to James and Kyle Bride of Everett, Washington. The operation became Ace Rock, LLC in 1997, with the Brides, Dick Christopherson (Bremerton, Washington), and David Grainger (British Columbia, Canada). The underlying land was sold in 1999 to the Brides and Christopherson. In 2005, Valley View Sand and Gravel, Inc. (owned by the three families) assumed ownership of the land. The Lummi Island Quarry itself operated until 2013 by Aggregates West, Inc. of Everson, owned by Grainger. Aggregates West went into Chapter 11 bankruptcy, having defaulted in 2012 on $3.5 million in Frontier Bank (inherited by Union Bank) loans originated in 2005. Aggregates West offloaded barges of excavated rock at Bellingham, Anacortes, Everett, and Seattle). Only 10% of the output was used on the island by 2007. A land trust, Lummi Island Heritage Trust, became involved to purchase the land for reclamation and conservation purposes. The trust successfully purchased the 105 acres in 2015 for $1.08 million. By 2019 the land trust named the area the Aiston Preserve, after the Aiston family that homesteaded the land in the 1940s. Events The island hosts a weekly farmers' market in the spring and summer, a chili festival in mid-July, and a Christmas party for island children. Lummi Island is home to numerous artists who conduct studio tours on Memorial Day weekend, Labor Day weekend, and the second weekend in November.

Though never imported into the US, the rest of the world, including Canada, received some of these models. The DT200LC began production in 1983bc. It also was very similar to the DT125LC. This model continued production until 1988.Then, in 1989 a totally new model was introduced, DT200R, as well as a similar DT125R. In Canada, the DT125LC/R was never imported. In Canada, the new model sold until 1996. It continued on in South America, the Middle East, Europe, Australia, and Africa. It spawned the DT125, in two versions, as well as a WR200. Today it has been redesigned as a DT230R, as well as the DT200R for South America, which is a hybrid of the LC and R models. Competition for the DT200R came from Suzuki's TS200RM, imported into Canada from 1991 until 1993. Honda never imported its superior CRM250 into North America. The DT200 or WR200 used a liquid cooled, oil injected, (autolube) case reed inducted, Y.P.V.S. power valved (electronically operated power valve system while motocross bikes are equipped with mechanically operated power valve system),flat slide carburetion, resin reeds, single cylinder, 2 stroke engine. As a dual-purpose bike, it was designed for on and off-road use, Yamaha has another 2 models, the DT200WR with oil pump code 3xp, which was only sold in the Japanese home market, and WR200R with premix, code 4bf. The WR200R was sold in Canada, U.S.A., and many other countries around the world. The WR200R was sold as an off-road only model and had many similarities with the DT200WR. Some of the differences between the \\"R\\" and \\"WR\\" models were the oil pump, carburetor, TM30SS vs.TM28SS, larger reed cage with 6 petals vs. 4 petals, longest final gear for the 3xp, plastic tank vs.steel gas tank, little shorter seat height on DT200WR model, with the same design in full body generally the 3xp was the model for every day use, plus 10 kg of weight.

This machine is a stealth motorcycle event sound tests it registers between 74 and 82 dbA. Meeting noise level requirements has never been an issue. The DT200R shares similar engine cases with the ATV BLASTER - But the Blaster is not crank case induction like the DT200R. Both DT200R & Blaster crank shafts are compatible, the DT200R piston doesn't have port's like the Blaster, but the Blaster piston can be used with the DT200R. In the Blaster version & some of the DT200WR versions the oil pump is not installed, blanking plug is fitted over the oil pump drive. The Yamaha WR200 shown above has the same crank & Stroke as the DT200R & ATV Blaster. The WR200 crank cases are similar to the DT200R but with a bigger reed cage port and slightly revised induction port shapes in the crank cases. The WR200 has a larger cylinder bore size of 66.8mm diameter giving a displacement of 199 cm with a standard compression of 6.3:1 in standard form. The standard cylinder is nickel plated and has slightly larger porting plus two boost ports either side of the exhaust port. This in turn makes the WR200 power valve different in shape to allow three exhaust ports to be controlled. The WR200 has a direct cable clutch drive pinion in the clutch cover, where as the DT200R & Blaster use a conventional push rod through the clutch center.

This led to a new street layout with streets and buildings named in honour of Britain's railway heritage.

The Heaton Woods Trust is a registered charity that was established in 1977. The Heaton Woods Trust is responsible for the care and protection of the woods for the benefit of present and future generations. The charity's ownership is nearly 50 acres which, broadly speaking, extends from Park Drive/Redburn through to the Cat Steps at the bottom of Quarry Street. The Trust also works closely with The Friends of Northcliffe and the Dixon family whose woodland ownership surrounds Six Days Only. The Heaton Woods Trust is funded by charitable donations from the community, paid annual memberships (currently totalling over 160 members from the local community) and fundraising activities such as its annual Open Day and Arboricultural Day. In addition The Heaton Woods Trust receives grants from various sources.  The Heaton Woods Trust Aims  Its main purpose is to preserve, replant and maintain The Heaton Woods Trust (nearly 50 acres) in order for current and future generations to enjoy.  Brief Biography of The Heaton Woods Trust Trustees and Committee Members  The Heaton Woods Trust has four trustees and is run by a committee of local unpaid volunteers such as retirees (e.g. teachers and Councillors), a (current) JP magistrate, pensioners, church volunteers and university graduates all aged between 27 ‚Äì 85. They have committee members including those with disabilities (physical and mental), different religions and nationalities e.g. British, Italian, Asian etc. Each month the committee holds a meeting to discuss the Trust's finances, work that needs to be conducted, current issues in regards to the woodland and what improvements could be made to ultimately benefit the community the charity serves.  History of The Heaton Woods Trust  Its first purchase was a piece of farmland that they came to call ‚ÄúRenold Woods‚Äù in 1982 (5.5 acres) where over 4000 trees were planted Approximately 20 local residents at the time paid ¬£500.00 each to acquire this land in order to avoid it being used as a housing development. They did this with the sole aim of preserving a piece of countryside and woodland within a small corner of Bradford. Within the past 15 years the Heaton Woods Trust received the necessary funding for Sean's Pond. Over the years The Heaton Woods Trust acquired two further pieces of farmland increasing the woodland to its current size which are now named ‚ÄúRosse Woods‚Äù after their president, the Earl of Rosse and ‚ÄúLower Wood.‚Äù  Past Issues In The Heaton Woods Trust  Alongside asking its visitors to follow the Countryside Code, one of the charity's rules that it emphatically enforces is having all dogs on a lead at all times whilst visiting The Heaton Woods Trust woodland. Back in 2006 the charity had major issues with dogs considered to be dangerous being off their leads and roaming freely around the woodland. This subsequently led to both other dogs and people being viciously attacked. As a result, local campaigners created a petition calling on the Bradford Council to create more safeguards and enforce legislation on protecting the public (including visitors to The Heaton Woods Trust woodland) from dangerous dogs. Following on from the creation of this petition by local campaigners, sadly the dog attacks continued with them becoming more commonplace in The Heaton Woods Trust woodland. Due to these developments, local walkers and visitors became scared and avoided visiting the woodland. In addition, the local newspaper Telegraph and Argus got involved and started their own campaign called \\"The T&A; Curb The Danger Dogs Campaign.\\" In 2010 the dog attacks subsided significantly as legislation was being enforced at Bradford Crown Court against both the dangerous dogs involved in the attacks on the woodland and also their owners. This resulted in the reintroduction of the local residents visiting The Heaton Woods Trust woodland again as a significant decrease in dog attacks were being reported. To this day, The Heaton Woods Trust still has a problem with a small portion of dog walkers not using leads in the woodland although at present no dog attacks have been reported in recent years. Current Issues In The Heaton Woods Trust The Heaton Woods Trust in recent years have suffered from criminals attempting to steal its machinery and assorted tools that are used by volunteers to maintain and improve the woodland for its visitors and the local community. Vandalism is an ongoing problem in The Heaton Woods Trust with various waterways being blocked, litter not being disposed of properly, trees being damaged and benches (some of them being memorial benches) having graffiti on them. A boundary dispute that has lasted for well over a decade so far is still ongoing between The Heaton Woods Trust conservationists and a property developer over a piece of land. Both sides claim they have sufficient evidence to prove their \\"rightful ownership\\" over this disputed area.  Track Record and Endorsements  In 1991 The Heaton Woods Trust was named Regional Winners in Yorkshire and Humberside in the Tidy Britain Spring Clean Award. For its Millennium contribution, with the assistance of monies from the Forestry Authority and Bradford Environmental Action Trust via Landfill Tax, they planted 2000 trees in Rosse Woods. Over the years The Heaton Woods Trust acquired may grants and awards. Recently they have been awarded a Community Chest Grant from Bradford Council's Department of Environment and Sport. Although most notably The Royal Forestry Society came to The Heaton Woods Trust in 2009 and 2014. In both instances the competition judges from the Forestry Commission visited and inspected many woodlands. From both visits the charity won The Best Kept Woodland in Northern England 2009 and most recently the Best of England Woodlands: Community Woodland Award Winner 2014.

The NJSACB had begun to allow Mixed Martial Arts (MMA) promoters to conduct events in the state upon review of the promoter's rules and regulations in September 2000.

The NJSACB's unified rules would become the de facto set of rules for professional MMA in North America as more and more U.S. states used them to sanction the sport.

Proposals and terms In February 1608 Dutch negotiators submitted to their Spanish counterparts three different proposals regarding overseas trade in the East Indies. The first proposal suggested that peace in Europe be established with free trade permitted in overseas territories that were not controlled by the Spanish Empire. The second proposal suggested that peace in Europe be established along with a truce permitting free overseas trade for a period of years. The third proposal suggested that overseas trade be based on a \\"one's own risk\\" policy. Ultimately, the Spanish chose the second of the three proposals. Based on the terms of the accord, the Netherlands was granted the right to trade within overseas territories controlled by the Spanish Empire under the condition that it acquire an express license from the King of Spain. Moreover, the Dutch were allowed to engage in unhindered trade outside of Spanish colonial possessions and with the permission of the natives. According to a protocol written by English and French envoys, the Dutch managed during the negotiations to reserve the right to help any natives that concluded treaty relations with them and that such actions would not constitute a violation of the overall armistice.Grewe, p. 159. \\"In February 1608 the Dutch negotiators submitted to their Spanish counterparts three alternative proposals relating to the question of the Indies: 1) Peace in Europe and free trade with those overseas territories that were not in Spanish possession at that time; 2) Peace in Europe and a truce in the overseas regions for a period of years in which the overseas trade was to be free; or 3) Overseas trade at one's own risk according to the English-French model. The Spanish accepted as a basis of discussion the second proposal only. They did so only after a temporary interruption of negotiations, when the Armistice Treaty of Antwerp was concluded on 9 April 1609. It granted the Netherlands the right to trade with Spanish possessions only under the condition of an express license from the king. However, outside the Spanish possessions the Dutch were to be allowed, with the permission of the natives, to engage in unhindered trade. A protocol written by the English and French envoys stated that the Dutch, in the negotiations, had reserved the right to provide assistance to those natives with whom they had already concluded treaty relations, and that this would not violate the armistice.\\" Hugo Grotius On a sidenote, the formation of the accord was influenced by the writings of Hugo Grotius in Mare Liberum (\\"The Free Seas\\"), which was published in 1609 at the insistence of the Dutch East India Company; the pamphlet was published anonymously in Leiden roughly one month prior to the conclusion of the treaty.Armitage, pp. 52-53. \\"The publication of Hugo Grotius's Mare Liberum in 1609 coincided with James's policy of restricting Dutch fishing in British waters, thus putting a specifically Scoto-British argument for mare clausum at the centre of a global argument over rights of dominium. The work, a fragment of the larger treatise De Jure Prede, was published at the insistence of the Dutch East India Company in the context of the negotiations towards what would become the Twelve Years Truce between Spain and the United Provinces. Grotius justified Dutch rights of trade and navigation in the East Indies against the claims of the Portuguese by arguing from natural law principles that anything publicum - such as the air, the sea, and the shore of that sea - was the common property of all, and hence could be the private property of none. The polemical purpose of this was clear: to deny that any state could make the sea an accessory to its realm, and to enforce freedom of navigation throughout the ocean, as a Dutch counterblast to Portuguese claims of dominium over the seas on grounds of first discovery, papal donation, rights of conquest or title of occupation. Though the East Indian context was uppermost in Grotius's argument and provided the spur for its publication, this did not prevent James's subjects from imagining that his claims to freedom of the seas were made at the expense of their own demands for new restrictions on Dutch fishing rights: 'K[ing] James coming in the Dutch put out Mare Liberum, made as if aimed at mortifying the Spaniards' usurpation in the W. and E. Indyes, but aimed indeed at England', noted one commentator in 1673. Indeed, the Treaty of Antwerp (1609) secured Dutch rights of navigation in the East Indies only a month after Grotius's pamphlet was published anonymously in Leiden.\\" Johan van Oldenbarnevelt Johan van Oldenbarnevelt and the urban oligarchies of Holland developed another peace treaty in order to prevent any renewed hostilities with Spain once the Treaty of Antwerp expired in 1621. However, Stadtholder Maurice of Nassau, Oldenbarnevelt's chief rival in the government of the United Provinces, led a faction of nobles that supported renewing hostilities with Spain and managed to have Oldenbarnevelt arrested in 1618.Fix, p. 67. \\"Oldenbarnevelt and the urban oligarchies of Holland formed a peace treaty opposing renewed hostilities with Spain when the so-called Twelve Year Truce expired in 1621, but Nassau, Oldenbarnevelt's chief rival for power within the government of the United Provinces, led a noble faction favoring a resumption of the war as well as a greater centralization of the Dutch government than the oligarchs were willing to permit. ...

The current building was built between 1893 and 1897 in the Art Nouveau style. It was designed by √ñd√∂n Lechner and Gyula P√°rtos.  History of the building  The former City Hall of Kecskem√©t was a Neoclassical building. By the mid-19th century, it was in very poor condition. The city council wanted to meet an old demand when it announced a design competition for a new building in 1890. Of the five entries received, the jury awarded the first prize to √ñd√∂n Lechner and Gyula P√°rtos for their design, which were nominated with not terrible height or depth. In 1869 Lechner associated with P√°rtos and opened a construction office together. Of these, Lechner was the artist and P√°rtos was the entrepreneur. The building was constructed between 1893 and 1897 in the Art Nouveau style. In 1911, after an earthquake, it was restored under Lechner's control. Between 1897 and 1996, the building hosted the City Library.  Description of the building  Entrance blood oath on the fresco of Bertalan Sz√©kely located inside the city hall. The statements of the art historian are not consistent in style. Some say Lechner was based on the early French Renaissance, others say English Renaissance architecture, and there are also opinions that its most influential cities were those of Upper Hungary and Zipser Germans. So it was practiced Renaissance architecture of Levoƒça. In any case, Lechner say that its aim was to create a Hungarian style. \\"There was no Hungarian form language, but it will be. Because it has to be. This conviction leads me to a running in life, whose sole purpose is to pave the way for the formation of the Hungarian formal language\\", he wrote in the M≈±v√©szet Journal in 1906. Thus, although the basic structure is based on an early Renaissance style, the decoration of the fa√ßade, however, is accentuated by the wall coverings ceramics, rooted in Hungarian soil and using the motifs of Hungarian folk art. (Lechner was progressive on this issue because the ceramics are rather durable, riched in color and washable than the gypsum castings. The building has four lesenes (narrow and flat vertical wall strip for partitioning the wall), its avant-corps in the main facade is highlighted, roughly rectangle. The statue of the founder of the House, the prince √Årp√°d was placed in the middle of its central rizal. The Kecskem√©t people, who were initially averse to the new town hall, called √Årp√°d the √Årp√°dka armor-plated warrior. Portraits in relief of Nikola IV Zrinski, Emeric Th√∂k√∂ly, Matthias Corvinus, John Hunyadi, Stephen I of Hungary, Franz Joseph I of Austria are placed in the building. Outside and inside the building, are located the coats of arms of Kecskem√©t and Hungary.  Murals and frescoes  One of the corridors in the interior The building of the City Hall houses the fresco made between 1895 and 1897 by Bertalan Sz√©kely. This was the last secular work of the artist. There were two main aspects that played a part in choosing the theme: join to Kecskem√©t and be worthy of celebrating the 1,000 years of existence of the country. After several suggestions, two frescoes were finally realized: one depicting the blood oath, the most important event of the Pusztaszer assembly. Seven chieftains of the Magyars is like a frieze, the picture has a fabulous feel. Another characteristic is the emphasis on drawing, the lack of plasticity. The second image is the Depicts the coronation of Franz Joseph I of Austria. Beside the figure of the king we can see the prince Gyula Andr√°ssy and J√°nos Simor. The mural is a like portraits, emphasizing almost every character. The plans of the two sequences of events, which were far away from each other, were not realized, and instead, the other two wall surfaces, divided by windows and doors, were depicted in the form of the great figures of our history. On the wall divided by the door to the left: a mural depicts Istv√°n Sz√©chenyi, Lajos Kossuth, Ferenc De√°k; in the door wall to the right: a mural depicts Louis I of Hungary, John Hunyadi, Matthias Corvinus; on the wall to the left of the window: depicts Francis II R√°k√≥czi, Gabriel Bethlen, Nikola IV Zrinski; on the wall to the right of the window: a mural depicts Coloman, King of Hungary, Ladislaus I of Hungary, Stephen I of Hungary. On the 20th anniversary of Mikl√≥s Horthy, the General Assembly decided to make another mural. First it was entrusted to the Sz√©kelys Ferenc M√°rton (1884-1940). However, with the unexpected death of M√°rton, the mural was commissioned to Lajos P√°ndy. The painting had to be placed on the wall to the right of the entrance opposite the Presidential Stand. The painting was completed in 1944, depicting Horthy's entry into Kecskem√©t, adapted to Bertalan Sz√©kely painting style. After 1945 the painting was not tolerated in the Great Hall, it was only covered with paper at first, and 1959 was whitewashed. At that time, the \\"Blood Oath\\" was threatened with its destruction, but this was covered with canvas in time and survived. The whitewashed mural of Mikl√≥s Horthy in Kecskem√©t was restored in 2014, can be viewed in the ballroom.

Ambassadorship pursuit In 2018, when Wagle sought an appointment to a diplomatic post she listed Wichita native and Las Vegas billionaire Phil Ruffin, a casino partner of President Donald Trump, as a reference just days after she voted for a bill beneficial to Ruffin‚Äôs business interests in Kansas. Wagle sought an ambassadorship to Ireland, Belize, or Belgium, or other State Department positions. She made her aspirations known in a May 7, 2018 email to a campaign operative shortly after the legislative session ended. Wagle wrote, \\"I'm thinking it's an excellent time,\\" to leave Kansas politics while requesting that the operative forward her cover letter and resume which included Ruffin as a reference, to an administration official. The request followed ten days after Wagle voted to establish an avenue for racetrack casinos to operate in Kansas, a change sought by Ruffin, the owner of both Wichita's Greyhound Park and The Woodlands racetrack in Kansas City, Kansas. Wagle had opposed prior efforts to hold a new County vote to permit slot machines at the Wichita Greyhound Park which Sedgwick County voters had turned down in 2007. Ruffin had threatened to close down the park after the initiative was defeated. Wagle had said, \\"Those of us who oppose gaming don‚Äôt have millions of dollars to fend off Mr. Ruffin every time he wants to push a ballot initiative.\\" Her campaign spokesman wrote that Wagle‚Äôs change in voting for the 2018 gaming bill came \\"after meeting with Mr. Ruffin and other leaders in the Wichita business community and after learning about the uneven tax treatment that had been leveled on the industry. Tax fairness and tax equity is a top concern for Senator Wagle.\\" When interviewed, Ruffin said Wagle would make a good U.S. senator, dismissing the contention that her position change regarding expanded gaming led to his support. Wagle's pitch for such an ambassadorial post came weeks after Wichita Republican congressman Mike Pompeo received U.S. Senate approval as United States Secretary of State in April 2018. Wagle's campaign spokesman said Pompeo did not have a role in promoting her candidacy to the White House: \\"While she does not recall speaking to Secretary Pompeo about her interest in serving in the Administration, she did reach out to the President's team and some of their mutual friends, including Phil Ruffin, in this process.\\"  U.S. Senate campaign (2020)  In January 2019, Wagle formed an exploratory committee to assess entering the 2020 race for the Republican nomination for U.S. Senate, to fill the seat of the retiring Pat Roberts.

Government accountability In 2018, Wagle cosponsored legislation with Kansas Senate Minority Leader Anthony Hensley that worked to bring more transparency to state contracts. The bill required lobbyist registration for anyone attempting to influence officials in state agencies or the executive branch over a state contract. Prior to the enactment of this legislation, lobbying efforts were only required to be disclosed if such efforts were directed toward the legislative branch. Wagle stated the need for this legislation arose due to a lack of transparency within the administration of Republican former Governor Sam Brownback.

It is bounded by River Avon and Harbour feeder canal making it an almost island area, unlike the other two areas surrounded by water, it was historically part of Gloucestershire and is part of North Bristol. The site is home of Avonmeads Retail Park, a large retail and leisure park with Showcase Cinemas and a Hollywood Bowl ten-pin bowling centre among its tenants. It was extensively redeveloped in the 15 years to 2007. A bypass runs over the River Avon creating a major transport link from the A4 road in south east Bristol, to junction 3 of the M32 motorway near the city centre. In past years St Philip's marsh was a housing development for the workers of Bristol's market area (now known as Old Market). One of St Philip's' more influential residents during the early 1900s was George Townsend, a major property developer of the South Bristol area. His family home situated in the St Anne's area of Bristol is still standing today and a reminder of Bristol's history. Today there is very little housing in the area making it almost deserted at night, and other than the retail area it does contain one shop, pub, takeaway and Sparke Evans Park. Geology The solid geology of St Philip's Marsh comprises Triassic Redcliffe Sandstone in the east, and Triassic mudstone and halite-stone of the Mercia Mudstone Group to the west. The solid geology is overlain by Quaternary Tidal Flat Deposits of silt and clay,, Geology of Britain Viewer. which are in turn covered by deep deposits of made ground. Sparke Evans Park Sparke Evans Park is situated on the riverside not far from the retail park. The land was donated by P.F. Sparke Evans and Jonathan Evans, local tannery owners, in 1902. It is a survivor from a time when the Marsh was a residential area. Since the area has become almost totally industrial it now gets little use, what use it does get is by workers on breaks and from the residents of Arno's Vale and Totterdown as there is a bridge linking the two areas. A shelter dating from 1925 is still extant on the far west of the park featuring wrought-iron pillars, with ornate and decorative brackets. Railways St Philip's Marsh is located close to Bristol Temple Meads railway station, on the Great Western Main Line. St Philip's Marsh depot is a train maintenance depot located within the district. Originally developed by the Great Western Railway as a twin-turntable facility for freight locomotives, it was closed to steam in June 1964 and redeveloped as a diesel depot. Owned by Network Rail under depot code PM, it is leased to train operator Great Western Railway, and has been used since their introduction for the maintenance of InterCity 125 trains operating between London Paddington, Bristol and South Wales. Both Class 43 power cars and Mark 3 coaching stock are serviced here. Following the merger of First Great Western (FGW) and Wessex Trains operations into one new franchise in 2006, St Philip's Marsh took over the maintenance of FGW's fleet of diesel multiple units, previously maintained at Cardiff Canton TMD by Arriva Trains Wales. The move allowed the removal of the need for the majority of trains operating area, mostly in the West Country, requiring to travel through the congested Severn Tunnel.

Her character was written to be in her late forties to early fifties, easy on the eyes, amicably maladjusted, and a compulsive liar so good at what she does, most people will not know she is not what she seems. Damon Lindelof was quoted in Variety as saying the character \\"is going to bring a flavor to the show that doesn't exist right now. She's not as intense as some of the other characters. She's that person you want in the trenches with you who can take lemons and make lemonade.\\" Libby is seen by some as a beautiful blonde \\"Tailie\\" and Hurley's true love. She is often described as mysterious, especially since much of her backstory is yet to be revealed. IGN'has described her as a \\"loose end\\" in the storyline due to the contradictions between what she tells other characters and the flashbacks viewers see about her, such as her profession as a clinical psychologist and her stay at a mental institution. On the show, she is often seen as helpful to other people, such as Donald, Jin, Claire, Bernard, and Desmond. One example of her exhibiting this virtue is when she assists Hurley in resolving his mental problems. Characters have often described her as a \\"shrink\\" or as a \\"mega cute blonde chick\\" due to her profession and appearance. Sawyer, meanwhile, has used the nickname \\"Moonbeam\\" on her due to her upbeat hippie- like personality. Development Cynthia Watros did not think that she was going to be cast as Libby.

During her audition, Watros did not think she would be cast. When she learned she had been, she was excited since she was a fan of the show and moved with her twin daughters from Los Angeles to Hawaii where Lost is filmed. Libby was not originally going to be killed off, but since Ana Lucia Cortez was considered an unpopular character, the producers thought her death would not generate enough sympathy from fans. They decided Libby, who was well liked, should also be killed for emotional impact. Additionally the producers and writers ran out of ideas for a compelling storyline for the character. According to Carlton Cuse and Damon Lindelof, the writers did try to develop her story through her romance with Hurley but they ran out of possible avenues for the character. The writers also thought her story was not as dramatic when juxtaposed with the other characters. A few weeks before Libby was written out of the show, Watros and Michelle Rodriguez were arrested for driving under the influence in Kailua, Hawaii, in two separate incidents.

The producers said Watros was busy with other commitments, and they could not reveal Libby's story without her. It is revealed in a deleted scene Libby had been married three times prior to the plane crash and she specializes in marriage counseling. Theories about unknown aspects of her life exist, including assumptions she was once a DHARMA Initiative employee, an Other, a person planted by Desmond's flashback characters Mrs. Hawking and Brother Campbell. Her surname was not given during the show's run, but was later revealed as Smith during Comic-Con 2009 in an in memoriam clip show of Lost's major death scenes. The producers brought the character back to the show in the second half of the final season. About the return of Libby, Cuse stated, \\"Finally, all of your questions [about Libby] will be answered\\", however, Lindelof jokingly responded, \\"No, they will not\\".

Japanese scroll painting, circa 1870 Bear worship (also known as the bear cult or arctolatry) is the religious practice of the worshipping of bears found in many North Eurasian ethnic religions such as the Sami, Nivkh, Ainu, pre-Christian Basques, and Finns.Wilfred Bonser (2012) \\"The Mythology of the Kalevala, with Notes on Bear-Worship Among the Finns.\\", p. 344 There are also a number of deities from Celtic Gaul and Britain associated with the bear, and the Dacians, Thracians, and Getians were noted to worship bears and annually celebrate the bear dance festival. The bear is featured on many totems throughout northern cultures that carve them. Paleolithic cult The bear-goddess feeds a bear (1918) The existence of an ancient bear cult among Neandertals in Western Eurasia in the Middle Paleolithic has been a topic of discussion spurred by archaeological findings. The Neanderthals would have worshiped the cave bear (Ursus spelaeus) and ancient bear bones have been discovered in several different caves and are believed by some archaeologists to be evidence of a bear cult during the Paleolithic. It was not the mere presence of these bones that intrigued archaeologists, but their peculiar arrangement. Upon excavation, archaeologists on site determined that the bones were found arranged in such a way that it was not naturally possible. Emil B√§chler, a main supporter of the argument for the presence of an ancient bear cult, found bear remains in Switzerland and at Mornova Cave in Slovenia. Along with B√§chler‚Äôs discovery, bear skulls were found by Andr√© Leroi-Gourhan arranged in a perfect circle in Sa√¥ne-et-Loire. The discovery of designs such as those found by Andr√© Leroi- Gourhan suggests that these bear remains were placed in their arrangement intentionally; an act which has been attributed to Neandertals and is assumed to have been a part of some sort of ceremony. While some of these findings have been interpreted to indicate the presence of an ancient bear cult, certain analyses and discussions have led to contradicting results. According to Ina Wunn, based on the information archaeologists have about primitive man and bear cults, if Neandertals did, in fact, worship bears, there should be evidence of it in their settlements and camps. Most bear remains have been found in caves, however, and not within early human settlements. This information has implied the non-existence of an ancient bear cult and has instigated the development of new theories. Many archaeologists, including Ina Wunn, have come to believe that since most bear species reside and hide their young in caves during the winter months for hibernation, it is possible that their remains were found in the caves because caves were their natural habitat. Bears lived inside these caves and perished for various reasons, whether it was illness or starvation. Wunn argues that the placement of these remains, whether it appears to be an identified pattern or not, is due to natural causes such as wind, sediment, or water. Therefore, in Wunn‚Äôs opinion, the assortment of bear remains in caves did not result from human activities and there is no evidence for a bear cult during the Middle Paleolithic era. Certain archaeologists, such as Emil B√§chler, continue to use their excavations to support that an ancient bear cult did exist. People from Russia Eastern Slavic culture Bears were the most worshipped animals of Ancient Slavs. During pagan times, it was associated with the god Volos, the patron of domestic animals. Slavic folklore describes the bear as a totem personifying a male: father, husband, or a fianc√©. Legends about turnskin bears appeared, it was believed that humans could be turned into bears for misbehavior. Volos or also called Veles in the background of the Millennium of Russia Monument Altaic peoples In 1925-1927 made field observations of bear worship among the Altai, Tubalar (Tuba-Kiji), Telengit, and Shortsi of the Kuznetskaja Taiga as well as among the Sagai tribes in the regions of Minussinsk, near the Kuznetskaja Taiga (1927).Dyrenkova Finns In Finnish pagan culture, the bear was considered a taboo animal and the word for \\"bear\\" (oksi) was a taboo word. Euphemisms such as mesik√§mmen \\"honey-hand\\" were used instead. The modern Finnish word karhu (from karhea, rough, referring to its rough fur) is also such an euphemism. Calling a bear by its true name was believed to summon the bear. Bear hunting and killing a bear was followed by a party called peijaiset with ceremony intended to show that the bear would be a \\"honored guest\\" instead of a slaughtered animal, and that its death was \\"accidental\\", in order to not to anger the bear's spirit. The skull of the bear was hung into a tree, which was venerated as a totem. Pyrenees There are annual bear festivals that take place in various towns and communes in the Pyrenees region. In Prats-de-Mollo, the (\\"festival of the bear\\") held on Candlemas (February 2) is a ritual in which men dressed up as bears brandishing sticks terrorize people in the streets. Formerly, the festival centered on the \\"bears\\" mock-attacking the women and trying to blacken their breasts (with soot), which seemed scandalous to outside first-time observers. But according to the testimony of someone who remembered the olden days before that, the festival that at Prats-de-Mollo involved elaborate staging, much like the version in Arles. The Arles-sur-Tech version () involves a female character named Rosetta (Roseta) who gets abducted by the \\"bear\\". Rosetta was traditionally played by a man or a boy dressed up as a girl. The \\"bear\\" would bring the Rosetta to a hut raised on the center square of town (where the victim would be fed sausages, cake, and white wine). The event finished with the \\"bear\\" being shaved and \\"killed\\". A well-known bear festival also occurs at Haute-Vallespir (). Bears in Korean mythology According to legend, Ungnyeo (literally \\"bear woman\\") was a bear who turned into a woman, and gave birth to Dangun, the founder of the first Korean kingdom, Gojoseon. Bears were revered as motherly figure and a symbol of patience. Nivkh people Nivkh bear festival A bear festival by Nivkh around 1903 The bear festival is a religious festival celebrated by the indigenous Nivkh in Russia's far east. A Nivkh Shaman (ch'am) would preside over the Bear Festival, celebrated in the winter between January and February depending on the clan. Bears were captured and raised in a corral for several years by local women, treating the bear like a child. The bear is considered a sacred earthly manifestation of Nivkh ancestors and the gods in bear form. During the Festival the bear is dressed in a specially made ceremonial costume and offered a banquet to take back to the realm of gods to show benevolence upon the clans. After the banquet the bear is killed and eaten in an elaborate religious ceremony. The festival was arranged by relatives to honor the death of a kinsman. The bear's spirit returns to the gods of the mountain 'happy' and rewards the Nivkh with bountiful forests. Generally, the Bear Festival was an inter-clan ceremony where a clan of wife-takers restored ties with a clan of wife-givers upon the broken link of the kinsman's death. The Bear Festival was suppressed in the Soviet period; since then the festival has had a modest revival, albeit as a cultural rather than a religious ceremony. Ainu bear worship The Ainu Iomante ceremony around 1930 The Ainu people, who live on select islands in the Japanese archipelago, call the bear ‚Äúkamuy‚Äù in their language, which translates to mean \\"god\\". While many other animals are considered to be gods in the Ainu culture, the bear is the head of the gods. For the Ainu, when the gods visit the world of man, they don fur and claws and take on the physical appearance of an animal. Usually, however, when the term ‚Äúkamuy‚Äù is used, it essentially means a bear. The Ainu people willingly and thankfully ate the bear as they believed that the disguise (the flesh and fur) of any god was a gift to the home that the god chose to visit.O. Harrassowitz (2007) \\"Journal of Asian History, Volume 41\\", p. 134-135 While on Earth - the world of man - the Ainu believed that the gods appeared in the form of animals. The gods had the capability of taking human form, but they only took this form in their home, the country of the gods, which is outside the world of man. To return a god back to his country, the people would sacrifice and eat the animal sending the god‚Äôs spirit away with civility. This ritual is called Omante and usually involves a deer or adult bear. Omante occurred when the people sacrificed an adult bear, but when they caught a bear cub they performed a different ritual which is called Iomante, in the Ainu language, or Kumamatsuri in Japanese. Kumamatsuri translates to ‚Äú bear festival‚Äù and Iomante means ‚Äúsending off‚Äù. The event of Kumamatsuri began with the capture of a young bear cub. As if he was a child given by the gods, the cub was fed human food from a carved wooden platter and was treated better than Ainu children for they thought of him as a god. If the cub was too young and lacked the teeth to properly chew food, a nursing mother will let him suckle from her own breast. When the cub reaches 2‚Äì3 years of age, the cub is taken to the altar and then sacrificed. Usually, Kumamatsuri occurs in midwinter when the bear meat is the best from the added fat. The villagers will shoot it with both normal and ceremonial arrows, make offerings, dance, and pour wine on top of the cub corpse. The words of sending off for the bear god are then recited. This festivity lasts for three days and three nights to properly return the bear god to his home.

The district consists of fields, forestry and open land providing space for sport/ activity centres (Redbridge Sport Centre), some houses, farmland and watersport/fishing lakes (Fairlop Waters). It also has a tube station. The western part of the district forms the eastern edge of Barkingside High Street shopping district, and simultaneously borders Claybury Park, which used to be home to Claybury Hospital. Its location is west of Barkingside and Fullwell Cross, north of Aldborough Hatch, south of Hainault and (distantly) west from Marks Gate and Collier Row. It is 3 miles from Ilford town centre. History and origins of the name The Fairlop Oak The district took its name from an old oak tree, the Fairlop Oak, that stood in Hainault Forest when much of the area was covered in trees. The oak is said to have had a trunk sixty-six feet in circumference, from which seventeen branches issued, most of them measuring not less than twelve feet in girth. In the eighteenth century, a pump and block maker from Wapping, Daniel Day, would take his employees on an annual fair in the forest, using the oak as their rendezvous. The fair took place on the first Friday of July. They dined on beans and bacon, and this may be the origin of the English words bean-feast and beano.Beauties of England and Wales, Volume 10, Issue 3, Part 1, By Britton, pub. T. Maiden, 1815 The Fairlop Fair By the middle of the eighteenth century, the annual excursion to Fairlop had become one of London's most popular entertainments, and as many as a hundred thousand people being drawn through Ilford to the fair in the forest. As a result, the area became known as \\"Fair\\" (after the fair) followed by \\"lop\\" referring to the tree flourishing after part of it was used to make Daniel Day's coffin after he died in 1767. A Society of Archers - The Hainault Foresters - under the patronage of the Earl Tylney of Wanstead House met under the Fairlop Oak. A legend has it that Queen Anne visited Fairlop during the fair. One of the songs sung at the fair was called \\"Come, come, my boys\\", in which one verse states: In June 1805, the oak tree caught fire, and by 1820 it was finally blown down. Its site is marked roughly at the boat house by the lake at Fairlop Waters. In nearby Fullwell Cross is a pub called the New Fairlop Oak. In 1851, the local people complained so bitterly about the depredations caused by the local deer that the trees which had surrounded the great oak were all felled and the adjoining parts of the forest were converted into farmland. In 1903 a station at Fairlop was opened on a new loop line that formed part of the Great Eastern Railway. In 1948 the line was taken over by the London Underground as part of the eastward extension of the Central line and the station became Fairlop Underground station. Demography According to the 2011 census in Fairlop ward, the population was 65% white (57% British, 7% Other, 1% Irish). 9% is Indian and 6% Other Asian.http://www.ukcensusdata.com/fairlop-e05000503 Transport Fairlop station was served by the Great Eastern Railway from its opening in 1903 until 1923, by the London and North Eastern Railway from 1923 until 1947 and has been by the London Underground's Central line since 1948.

He is the son of novelist Gilbert Sorrentino and Victoria Ortiz. His first published novel, Sound on Sound (1995), draws upon innovations pioneered in the work of his father, but also contains echoes of many other modernist and postmodernist writers. The book is structured according to the format of a multitrack recording session, with corresponding section titles (\\"Secondary Percussion\\", \\"Vocals\\", \\"Playback\\", and so forth). His second novel, Trance (2005), an epic fictional treatment of the Patty Hearst saga, used many of the same experimental techniques as Sound on Sound, but, according to Sorrentino, incorporated them more carefully and subtly into the text. The book was widely praised for its lush descriptions, riveting characterizations and dialogue, imaginative departures, and attention to period detail. Trance ended up on several reviewers' \\"best\\" lists, was named a finalist for the 2005 National Book Award for Fiction, and was longlisted for the 2007 International Dublin Literary Award. In 2009, Trance was named one of the \\"61 Essential Postmodern Reads\\" by the Los Angeles Times. In 2006 New York magazine revealed that Sorrentino and Jonathan Lethem were the writers behind the pseudonymous Ivan Felt and Harris Conklin, authors of Believeniks!: 2005: The Year We Wrote a Book About the Mets, a \\"hyperliterary account of the Mets‚Äô 2005 season\\" that was intended as \\"a playful poke at book-world scams.\\" Sorrentino's next book, American Tempura, a collaboration with artist Derek Boshier, was published by Nothing Moments Press in the fall of 2007. A novella, American Tempura is a satire about commercial moviemaking in Los Angeles. Death Wish, a monograph on the 1974 film of the same name, was published in the fall of 2010 by Soft Skull Press as one of the inaugural entries in its Deep Focus series of film books. In April 2014 it was announced that Sorrentino would publish his next novel, The Fugitives, with Simon & Schuster.http://blogs.bookforum.com/paper/2014/04/21/the-new-n1-website/ The novel, published in February 2016, deals with the existential crisis of a blocked writer who becomes entangled with a Native American imposter involved in a casino theft and the reporter sent to investigate the crime. The novel is related by several unreliable narrators and is concerned with questions of identity, racial passing, and the nature of storytelling. Writing in The New York Times, Dwight Garner criticized its blending of genres as \\"something close to a disaster,\\"https://www.nytimes.com/2016/02/03/books/review-in-the- fugitives-looking-for-his-muse-in-all-the-wrong-places.html?_r=0 but Viet Thanh Nguyen, in The New York Times Book Review, called it an \\"elegantly constructed novel\\" and cautioned that \\"Sorrentino's novel might be a little deceptive because it disguises its complexity,\\"https://www.nytimes.com/2016/02/21/books/review/the-fugitives-by- christopher-sorrentino.html while Jim Ruland in the Los Angeles Times described The Fugitives as \\"stunning\\" and \\"an entirely new kind of novel.\\"https://www.latimes.com/books/la-ca-jc-christopher- sorrentino-20160207-story.html Sorrentino's work has appeared in such publications as The New York Times, Esquire, Harper's, The Paris Review, Playboy, Granta, McSweeney's, Tin House, Open City, Bookforum, Conjunctions, and many others. Sorrentino has taught at Eugene Lang College The New School for Liberal Arts and at Columbia University School of the Arts, and is a member of the faculty at the Unterberg Poetry Center of the 92nd Street Y.

The project was mined from 2006 to 2008, and produced of diamonds from of kimberlite mined from the open pit operation. Over $200 million was invested in the development of the Jericho operations including the construction of a per day diamond recovery plant, maintenance facility, fuel farm, and offices and accommodation for 225 personnel. On July 19, 2010 Shear Diamonds (n√©e Shear Minerals Ltd) (), a diamond exploration company focused on the Nunavut region, announced its purchase of the Jericho Diamond Mine.Press release announcing sale In late 2010, Shear announced that it would take about a year to devise a plan to reopen the mine. Shear began processing the existing recovery reject pile in early 2012, selling the recovered stones to Belgian diamond firm Tach√©, which provided a revolving line of credit. However, operations were suspended in September, as Shear, citing \\"limited funds and significant operations\\", has sought to minimize expenditures. Tach√© has given notice of default on certain covenants of their investment agreement, but is working with Shear to find funding or a purchaser. Operations The mine was developed, opened and operated by Tahera Diamond Corporation. The company was provided with CAN $35 million loan by Tiffany & Co. to assist in construction of the site, as part of a marketing alliance. The mine produced diamonds from 2006 to February 2008, and was Tahera's only mining operation. The company reported financial losses in 2007 due to operational difficulties, the high value of the Canadian dollar, high oil prices, and the short operating season of the Tibbitt to Contwoyto ice road in 2006. Tahera filed for protection from creditors in January 2008, and the mine stopped recovering diamonds once existing ore stockpiles ran out, one month later. There is no registered airport at the site so all heavy equipment had to be brought in by the Tibbitt to Contwoyto winter road. Due to the remoteness of the site the mine was part of the impetus for a proposal to build a port near the community of Bathurst Inlet with a road to both Diavik Diamond Mine and Ekati Diamond Mine.

It was built in 1908-09, and is located at 450 Madison Avenue SE. It is considered a fine example of Wright's Prairie School era, and \\"Michigan's Prairie masterpiece\\".William A. Storrer, The Architecture of Frank Lloyd Wright, p.146, University of Chicago Press; 2002 History The Meyer May House was commissioned in 1908 by Meyer S. May, president of May's clothing store in Grand Rapids, and his wife Sophie. The house's appearance stands in contrast to the Victorian houses typical of the period and the Heritage Hill neighborhood. Meyer May House is stylistically typical of Wright's Prairie houses, a two-story, T-plan constructed of pale brick, with hip roofs and long broad eaves, art glass windows and skylights.Caroline Knight, Frank Lloyd Wright, p. 88, Parragon; 2004. The first floor windows are tucked under the eaves and raised from ground level, providing both privacy and providing light to the staircase and second floor gallery. Wright carefully sited the house to allow maximum southern exposure for the living room windows and skylights and to create a spacious yard for the perennial gardens. Leaded and colored glass accented doors and casement windows open out to terraces and gardens with garden walls and planters incorporated into the design. Inside, wood grills hide the radiators, iridescent strips of gold art glass were placed in the horizontal grout lines of both brick fireplaces. A pastel mural of hollyhocks created by George Niedecken is featured on a dividing wall between the living room and dining room. The mural had been painted over, but has since been restored. Niedecken also supervised and coordinated the home's interior, which was completed in 1910. In 1922, two bedrooms were added upstairs, as were servants' quarters on the ground floor. May died in 1936 and the house remained empty for six years, not selling until 1942. Sold again in 1945, carports and additional entrances were added, and the bedroom additions were rented out. The Meyer May House was placed on the Michigan State Register of Historic Sites in 1986 and is also part of the Heritage Hill Historic District. The Heritage Hill district was listed in 1971 on both the National Register of Historic Places. Restoration Madison Ave facade Steelcase, an international office furniture company founded and headquartered in Grand Rapids, purchased the house in 1985. Before restoration began, extensive research into the home's original 1909 state was conducted through personal interviews, historic photos, original drawings and documents, and publications about Wright. During this restoration, the 1922 addition was removed, all the plaster ceilings were replaced, the roof was rebuilt, the Niedecken mural was restored, more than 100 windows and skylights were repaired, and an enclosed veranda was opened up. The landscaping was also restored to its original 1909 design. Restoration began in 1986 and the house opened for visitor tours in 1987. The house is one of the most completely restored of Wright's Prairie residences. Rooms in the restored house are furnished with a mixture of original pieces, reproductions of original pieces, and similar Arts and Crafts style items from the period. Carpets were also woven according to Wright's designs and colors. Public tours Meyer May House opened to the public in 1987. Tours are offered Tuesdays & Thursdays from 10 to 1 and on Sundays from 1 to 4. Admission is free. Wright's other Grand Rapids work David M. Amberg House The David M. Amberg House was completed in 1910. This house is not a complete Wright design, as he was preoccupied and traveling in Europe at the time. In 1909, Wright turned the project over to Marion Mahony and Herman von Holst for completion. References * Storrer, William Allin. The Frank Lloyd Wright Companion.

The series also received funding from BBC America. Steven Moffat wrote all six episodes, with Douglas Mackinnon and Matt Lipsey each directing three episodes. The series is described by its creators as a sequel to the 1886 novella Strange Case of Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde, rather than an adaptation of it, with the Robert Louis Stevenson tale serving as a backstory within the series. It stars James Nesbitt as Tom Jackman, a modern- day descendant of Dr. Jekyll, who has recently begun transforming into a version of Mr. Hyde (also played by Nesbitt). Jackman is aided by psychiatric nurse Katherine Reimer, played by Michelle Ryan. Gina Bellman also appears as Claire, Tom's wife. Filming took place at various locations around southern England in late 2006. The series was first transmitted on BBC One in June and July 2007, receiving mainly positive reviews. Plot Doctor Tom Jackman (James Nesbitt), a married father of two, has abandoned his family without explanation to live in a heavily fortified basement flat. He hires psychiatric nurse Katherine Reimer (Michelle Ryan) to help him with his unusual case. After explaining a set of elaborate security procedures to Reimer, he straps himself into a secured metal chair and undergoes a psychological transformation. Reimer observes that Jackman's alter ego exhibits rage, heightened senses, greatly superior strength and speed, and a more playful and flirtatious manner. She assures this persona she will keep his secrets just as she keeps Jackman's, but asks for guarantees he will not harm her. After being informed of the novella Strange Case of Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde, Jackman's alter ego takes Hyde's name for his own and the two agree to form an uneasy truce. While they share a body, neither remembers what the other did while dominant. They use a micro cassette recorder to leave messages for each other. Jackman began transforming into the violent, lecherous Hyde recently. Fearing for his family's safety, he chose to isolate himself from them, but he cannot bring himself to cut off all contact, and visits his wife Claire (Gina Bellman). During one such visit, Hyde assumes control and learns about Jackman's family. Miranda Callendar (Meera Syal), a detective employed by Claire, learns about Hyde and informs Jackman that Jekyll and Hyde was not fiction, but a fictionalized version of actual events. Callendar shows Jackman a picture of the real Doctor Jekyll who lived in Edinburgh, Scotland in the 19th century. Jackman is startled to see that Jekyll looks exactly like him, and that he died at around Jackman's current age; and Callendar speculates that he is a descendant of the original Doctor Jekyll, except for the fact that Doctor Jekyll had died without children. Jackman is also being stalked by a private security team led by an American named Benjamin (Paterson Joseph). Unbeknownst to him, the team works for his former employers at the biotechnology firm, Klein and Utterson, and is directed by his friend Peter Syme (Denis Lawson). When Benjamin's team puts Jackman's children at risk, Hyde asserts himself, killing a lion. At the hospital he is approached by Sophia, an elderly woman who claims to be his mother, but before he can question her she disappears. Jackman confronts Peter Syme, who attempts to drug him. This provokes Hyde to appear and take Syme and Claire hostage. Claire argues that they need to find a cure for Jackman's condition. Hyde kills Benjamin and Syme insists that Klein and Utterson have had a cure for a long time. Jackman is captured and locked inside a metal coffin. Reimer and Callendar confront Syme, claiming they know the truth about Jackman. Callendar theorizes that Klein and Utterson have access to cloning technology and that Jackman is Jekyll's clone. Syme denies this and orders them taken away to be killed. Syme reveals to Claire that the treatment Jackman is undergoing will stabilize into one persona: If it is Hyde, he will be kept for research in order to synthesize the potion that turned the original Jekyll into Hyde; If it is Jackman, she is free to take him home. When the box is opened, Hyde is dominant. In a flashback triggered by genetic memory, Hyde has a vision of a meeting between Jekyll and Robert Louis Stevenson, the author of Strange Case of Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde. Stevenson agrees to write a fictional version of Jekyll's case but reveals that he knows the truth: there is no potion. Instead, Jekyll was transformed into Hyde by his love for Alice, a maid within his household. Flashbacks into Jackman's own life show his Hyde first manifesting fully during a seaside holiday with Claire, after the pair were accosted by hooligans. Enraged by further threats to Jackman's family, Hyde escapes from Klein and Utterson. Ms. Utterson, a ruthless redheaded American woman at the head of Klein and Utterson, takes Claire and her sons hostage at a private estate, locking the twins in miniature versions of the same coffin used on their father. Tom's alleged mother, Sophia, appears on the premises and helps Claire escape her locked bedroom. She tells Claire how Klein and Utterson had indeed tried to clone Doctor Jekyll but had been unsuccessful. Claire meets several of the failed attempts in the lowest basement of the building. They are disfigured and in a near-vegetative state. Sophia explains that Jackman is a descendant of Doctor Jekyll, (who died a virgin), through Mr Hyde, and by chance a perfect natural genetic duplicate, \\"a perfect throwback, a chance in a million\\". Klein and Utterson had discovered this and had him under surveillance for almost his entire life, from when he was six-months-old. In order to trigger his transformation into Hyde, they created a clone of Alice, the maid whom Jekyll had loved. This clone is Claire herself. Hyde tries to rescue Jackman's family from Klein and Utterson, killing Syme and many other personnel. In the end there is a stand-off, with Jackman and Claire's sons held hostage and suffocating. The Hyde personality is apparently killed when he is shot with multiple bullets and then manages to avoid 'sharing the damage' by taking the wounds onto himself while allowing Jackman to assume his undamaged, healthy form, leaving Doctor Jackman as the only personality. Six months later, Jackman has tracked down Sophia, the woman who claimed to be his mother. When he questions her about his father, she reveals that she is the descendant of Hyde, the one through whom he had inherited the family curse from, and that it's \\"never over\\". As Jackman watches horrified, the powerless, tired, grey-haired Sophia transforms into her own version of the Hyde persona, the feral, red-headed Ms Utterson.

He attempted to get it produced in the United States three times, but all three attempts fell through for various reasons. He returned to England from the west coast of the United States and joined with Hartswood Films when Elaine Cameron was scouting for ideas for a supernatural thriller.\\"Jekyll: The Tale Retold\\", featurette on Jekyll DVD, Contender Home Entertainment Cameron then approached Steven Moffat for a script, and a six-part series was commissioned by the BBC's Jane Tranter and John Yorke in November 2005. BBC America signed on to provide co- production funding in March 2006. The producers regularly met with Moffat for brainstorming sessions. Cameron's assistant took notes from these conversations, after which they would look over the notes and start the process again. The producers invited Moffat to \\"write anything\\", with the intention of cutting the material back later. However, they were reluctant to cut material once they saw it on the page. The first episode starts with Jackman already knowing about his alter ego. Because the plot of Jekyll begins after the story has developed for the characters, Nesbitt says that the show feels like it is a second series. Moffat explicitly describes the series as a sequel, rather than an adaptation, stating the Jekyll of the original story really existed, and Jackman is his \\"modern-day descendant dealing with the same problems\\". As Jekyll and Hyde is such a well-known phrase, Moffat labored over what to call the series, eventually deciding upon Jekyll because that word \\"carries the name Hyde\\". The final episode replaces the title \\"Jekyll\\" with \\"Hyde\\". Producer Elaine Cameron says the one word title gives the series a \\"very modern feel\\". Moffat initially named the character Jekyll rather than Jackman, but found it cumbersome to constantly explain that the book had not been written in this alternate universe. Instead he chose a version where the book exists, but changed the name to Jackman. Otherwise, Cameron felt, the character would appear stupid by not realising what was happening when turning into Hyde. The scene between Tom and Katherine was expanded slightly in the sixth episode to keep their relationship active to facilitate a second series. However, no further episodes were commissioned. In an August 2007 interview, Moffat told Alan Sepinwall of The Star-Ledger that he had a sequel written for the miniseries \\"should the BBC be interested\\". Following Jekyll, Moffat became a co-writer on Sherlock. Casting Michelle Ryan consulted the Royal College of Psychiatry in preparation for her role. James Nesbitt and his agent attended a meeting with Jane Tranter in late 2005 regarding the 2006 series of Murphy's Law. At the conclusion of the meeting, she offered him a script for Jekyll, suggesting that he might like the role. Nesbitt took the script role as a way of putting a distance between his previous work. The casting of Nesbitt as Tom Jackman and Hyde was publicised on 12 December 2005, but filming was not scheduled to begin until September 2006, increasing Nesbitt's anticipation to play the roles. Writer Steven Moffat said that the dual-role required a very skilled actor, and a well-known actor was necessary because it was such an expensive show to produce. The production team decided Nesbitt's two characters would be mainly differentiated over a change in performance rather than by extensive make-up because they wanted Hyde to be able to walk around in public without attracting attention. Michelle Ryan, known for her long-running role as Zoe Slater in the soap opera EastEnders, was revealed by tabloid newspaper The Sun to have been cast as \\"Jekyll's sultry assistant\\" (Katherine Reimer) in August 2006. Ryan believed herself to be too young for the part, though that aspect had already been written into the character. To prepare, she consulted the Royal College of Psychiatry. Ryan dyed her hair red for the role to help differentiate her from Tom Jackman's wife. Denis Lawson was cast as Peter Syme. The actor consulted his post-graduate son for information on Syme's job. Moffat initially doubted Gina Bellman's suitability for the role of Claire Jackman because he associated her too much with Jane Christie, the character she had played in his sitcom Coupling. Moffat did not imagine the character to be as beautiful as Bellman, but her audition was so good that he revised his vision of the character. Bellman originally auditioned for the role of Katherine, but the producers wanted someone younger to play that role. However, Bellman said that she talked herself out of the role by arguing that there should be an age gap between Katherine and Claire to avoid Katherine becoming a threat to the wife. Bellman approached her role as if Claire had become caught up in Tom's mid-life crisis, an angle that impressed the producers. Meera Syal was attracted to her role because Miranda was not a clich√©d private detective and she thought the humour was \\"fresh\\". During the second filming block, Mark Gatiss briefly joined the cast, playing the small but important role of Robert Louis Stevenson in flashback scenes in episode five. Other roles included Paterson Joseph as Benjamin Maddox, and Linda Marlowe as Ms Utterson. Production The European Headquarters for Electronic Arts in Chertsey, Surrey was used as The Klein & Utterson Institute The series was filmed in two blocks of three episodes. The first three were directed by Douglas Mackinnon and the second three episodes by Matt Lipsey. It took an hour of make-up each day to turn Nesbitt into Hyde; a hairpiece lowered his hairline and prosthetics were added to his chin, nose and ear lobes. He also wore black contact lenses to make Hyde \\"soulless\\". After many debates, the producers decided that Hyde's imminent arrival would be indicated by the flash of a black eye. The eye imagery evolved during filming, and did not appear in the script. Filming began in September 2006 with the zoo sequence from the second episode, in which Benjamin's team have set Tom up to force out Hyde by placing his son, Eddie, in the lion's den.\\"Anatomy of a Scene\\", Jekyll DVD, Contender Home Entertainment Writing the sequence at a late stage in the production, Moffat wanted to compare Hyde's natural instinct to kill to that of a lion. This was shot on location at Heythrop Zoo, a private zoo in Chipping Norton run by Jim Clubb, whose firm Amazing Animals specialises in training animals for cinema and television. The Norman Foster- designed building in Chertsey, Surrey, which then housed the European Headquarters of video game designer and publisher Electronic Arts, was used as The Klein & Utterson Institute. A large country estate near Henley-on-Thames and in Bognor Regis was used for some of the scenes whilst on the run and in flashbacks. A disused Boys' school in Gloucestershire, and the Hammer House in Wardour Street, Soho were used in episode six. Filming concluded on 20 December 2006. The schedule was tight for a complex production. The production team had twelve days to shoot each episode, which director Douglas Mackinnon says was the biggest challenge of the project. The required amount of material was shot for most of the episodes. However, an extra twenty minutes of material was filmed for episode six. Director Matt Lipsey recalls that the team struggled to cut the extra material whilst maintaining the integrity of the episode. Lipsey credits Moffat for not \\"being precious\\" over his material during the editing process, and points out that his willingness to cut superfluous material means that he is taken seriously when he argues for something to be retained. The music was composed by Debbie Wiseman. The orchestra featured approximately 18 pieces. Some cues featured the vocals of Hayley Westenra to foreshadow the importance of a female voice. Broadcast and reception James Nesbitt earned a Golden Globe Award nomination for his role.Jekyll was broadcast on BBC One on Saturday nights from 9 p.m. A two-week break occurred between showings of the third and fourth episodes because the Live Earth benefit concert was broadcast during its timeslot on 7 July. The series began airing on BBC America from 4 August, as part of a \\"Supernatural Saturday\\" programming strand. In Australia, Jekyll began broadcasting on ABC1, Sundays at 8.30 p.m. from 2 March 2008 with a double episode back-to-back each week. In Canada, Jekyll began broadcasting on Showcase, beginning at the end of August 2007 and on BBC Canada, Wednesdays at 10:00 p.m. from 26 March 2008. Also in Hong Kong, Wednesday at 11:55 p.m. from 11 February 2009 on TVB Pearl. In the Netherlands, Jekyll was broadcast in the summer of 2009 on Sci-Fi Channel. Certain edits were made to the United Kingdom broadcasts in order to remove language unsuitable for Saturday night BBC One audiences. For example, a line spoken by Hyde in episode one was changed from \\"Who the fuck is Mr Hyde?\\" to \\"Who the hell is Mr Hyde?\\" James Jackson of The Times rated the first episode four out of five stars, calling Nesbitt's performance as Hyde \\"as entertainingly [over the top] as a dozen Doctor Who villains, with a palpable sense of menace to boot\\". The conspiracy plot is praised as a storyline that distinguishes this series from other adaptations. The Daily Telegraph's Stephen Pile criticised the script for \\"veering between Hammer horror and larky humour\\" and for being \\"cheesy\\". He also criticised Hyde's gravity-defying hijinks and mistook Michelle Ryan for a model. In the same newspaper, James Walton called the first episode a combination of \\"a good yarn with several nicely thoughtful touches\\". David Cornelius of DVDTalk was full of compliments for the series, summing up its review with the statement \\"six episodes, 300 minutes, not a single one of them wasted. 'Jekyll' is this year's finest television event\\". The Australian Broadcasting Corporation, commenting on the series being part of their 2008 line-up, said \\"This classic horror tale has been given a modern make-over that will leave you on the edge of your seat and begging for more. James Nesbitt is outstanding as the new Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde\\". Nesbitt was nominated for the Golden Globe Award for Best Performance by an Actor in a Mini-Series or Motion Picture Made for Television for his roles. Paterson Joseph received a mention in the nominations for the 2008 Screen Nation awards.

It includes uncut episodes, including restoration of some swearing cut from the BBC broadcasts. As DVD Verdict says about this uncut version, \\"the language is saucier, the violence a bit more bloody, and the sex more primal.\\" The disc contains audio commentaries on two episodes: producer Elaine Cameron, writer Steven Moffat and first-block director Douglas Mackinnon comment on episode one, while executive producer Beryl Vertue, second-block director Matt Lipsey and actress Gina Bellman comment upon the sixth episode. The set also contains two documentaries: \\"Anatomy of a Scene\\" focuses upon the production of the zoo sequence in episode two, while \\"The Tale Retold\\" covers the evolution of the series. The first Region 1 release occurred in the United States on 18 September 2007, although the Region 1 Canadian release was delayed until 9 October, following the Canadian broadcast of the series on Showcase, which commenced at the end of August 2007. American remake In May 2016, Variety reported that Lionsgate will develop an adaptation of the BBC miniseries with Ellen DeGeneres and Jeff Kleeman producing through their A Very Good Production banner and scribe team Anthony Bagarozzi & Charles Mondry writing. In July 2016, it was announced that Chris Evans would play the leading role in the American remake. In December 2016, it was announced that Ruben Fleischer will direct the film.

He wrote de la Tromba, a fine broken consort piece which has several professional recordings and first became well known due to the Julian Bream Consort. He was known to be in the service of the Countess of Warwick in 1599, and then working for Sir John Scudamore. His publications are: The Psalms of David in Meter (1599) and An Hour's Recreation in musicke, apt for instruments and voyces (1606). His work also appears in Michael East's and Thomas Ravenscroft's psalters, and Thomas Morley's broken consort publication. He referred in the dedication of his Psalmes to the late Ambrose Dudley, 3rd Earl of Warwick as 'my good Lord and Master'. Allison is represented by thirteen compositions in a set of consort books (dated 1588), from the household of Sir Francis Walsingham. Ten four-part settings by him appeared in East's Whole Booke of Psalms (1592), and he contributed a dedicatory poem to Giles Farnaby's Canzonets to Fowre Voyces (1598).Grove Dictionary of Music and Musicians In 1599, he published his own Psalmes of David in Meter, giving his London address as Dukes Place, near Aldgate, and describing himself as a 'gentleman' and a 'practitioner' of music. This print also includes his coat of arms, providing much information about his family. In the same year, seven of his instrumental works appeared without attribution in Morley's First Booke of Consort Lessons (claims that Allison may have been the 'gentleman' who financed the publication remain unsubstantiated and seem improbable). In 1606, he published An Howres Recreation in Musicke, acknowledging Sir John Scudamore (of Holme Lacy, near Hereford) as his patron.

Isoaspartic acid (isoaspartate, isoaspartyl, Œ≤-aspartate) is an aspartic acid residue isomeric to the typical Œ± peptide linkage. It is a Œ≤-amino acid, with the side chain carboxyl moved to the backbone. Such a change is caused by a chemical reaction in which the nitrogen atom on the N+1 following peptide bond (in black at top right of Figure 1) nucleophilically attacks the Œ≥-carbon of the side chain of an asparagine or aspartic acid residue, forming a succinimide intermediate (in red). Hydrolysis of the intermediate results in two products, either aspartic acid (in black at left) or isoaspartic acid, which is a Œ≤-amino acid (in green at bottom right). The reaction also results in the deamidation of the asparagine residue. Racemization may occur leading to the formation of D-aminoacids. Kinetics of isoaspartyl formation Isoaspartyl formation reactions have been conjectured to be one of the factors that limit the useful lifetime of proteins. Isoaspartyl formation proceeds much more quickly if the asparagine is followed by a small, flexible residue (such as Gly) that leaves the peptide group open for attack. These reactions also proceed much more quickly at elevated pH (>10) and temperatures. Repair L-isoaspartyl methyltransferase repairs isoaspartate and D-aspartate residues by sticking a methyl group onto the side chain carboxyl group in the residue, creating an ester. The ester rapidly and spontaneously turns into the succinimide (red), and randomly turns back into normal aspartic acid (black) or isoaspartate again (green) for another attempt.

Solomon Braun left France directed to Chad, at the time dominated by the Muslim warlord Rabih az-Zubayr. With the missions were the envoys of the Muslim rulers Mohammed al-Senoussi and Abd ar Rahman Gwaranga, sultan of Baguirmi, whom captain √âmile Gentil had brought to France a few months earlier. Shortly after Bretonnet's departure, news arrived that Rabih was attacking Baguirmi to punish it for its alliance with France; as a result, Bretonnet was ordered to reach the high course of the Ubangi River, and there unite with the Baguirmians and wait for instructions and reinforcements. Passing first by the Congo River and then by the lands controlled by Mohammed al-Senoussi, Bretonnet reached on June 15 the French post of Kouno and met with the king of Baguirmi Gaourang. He wrote on July 8, 1899, a letter to Emile Gentil, that headed another expedition proceeding shortly behind, in which he wrote that he did not trust the rumours that Rabih in person was marching on Kouno, but all the same asked Gentil to send him Captain Julien with his 130-strong company. Even when Bretonnet was forced to admit that Rabih was pointing to Kouno, he grossly underestimated the strength of Rabih, claiming in one of his last letters that he only had out-of-date muskets. Instead Rabih had, in Gentil's opinion, a thousand repeating rifles, 500 muzzle-loading rifles and at least 1500 other firearms. When Rabih arrived at Kouno on July 16, he could count on 2,700 rifles and 10,000 auxiliaries armed with lances and bows. Against them the Bretonnet mission was no match: it consisted of five Frenchmen (the officers Bretonnet, Braun, Durand-Autier, Martin), 44 Senegalese tirailleurs, two Arabs, 20 armed Bakongos, 3 cannons and 400 Baguirmians led by Abd ar Rahman Gwaranga. Bretonnet chose to evacuate Kouno and position himself at the nearby hills of Togbao, using the slopes to strengthen his defensive position. On the morning of the next day, July 17, Rabih attacked at 8:00; the first attack was repulsed, but Solomon Braun was killed and Bretonnet wounded so badly he was forced to cede command to lieutenant Durand-Autier. While the second attack was also repulsed, it subjected the Baguirmians to heavy pressure, who began to flee their positions; at this point the third and last assault came, which completely annihilated Bretonnet's column. Gwaranga saved himself fleeing, but not before being wounded, with other Baguirmians. Of Bretonnet's mission only three Senegalese survived, who were made prisoners and brought for questioning to Rabih. Bretonnet's three cannons were captured, although they were recovered by the French a year later, during the battle of Kouss√©ri. One of the prisoners, the sergeant Samba Sall, escaped a few days later and reached the village of Gaoura, where on 16 August he met the Gentil Mission, and informed them of the disaster. The victory was to prove hollow for Rabih, for it only strengthened French determination to remove Rabih. Three distinct expeditions marched to southern Chad in 1900, and met at Kouss√©ri to confront Rabih. This was the battle of Kouss√©ri in which Rabih was killed and French possession of Chad guaranteed.

Q-pits are kiln sites which were dug for the production of white coal prior to the Industrial Revolution when white coal was largely superseded by the use of coke. Purpose The white coal produced in Q-pits was largely used in the smelting of lead from about 1550 to 1750, when a process was discovered that used coal. The large sections of white coal had previously been mixed with charcoal to give the right temperature, as charcoal alone was too hot and would have volatilised the lead.Rackham, Oliver (2007). The New Naturalist Series. Woodlands. London: Collins. . p. 205. Some evidence exists to suggest that some had a secondary use in the charking of coal into coke.\\"to chark\\" is defined as: to reduce by strong heat, as to produce charcoal or coke. Location Many Q-pits were located in deciduous woodlands and as such they are an important landscape feature indicating both previous industrial activity and the presence of a woodland at the site or nearby.Muir, Richard (2008). Woods, Hedgerows and Leafy Lanes. Pub. Tempus, Stroud. . pp. 91 - 92. The pits are often found in association with saw pits. Construction The pits were created by removing soil to create a depression about 12-13 feet (4m) in diameter, breached by a 'spout' and thus forming a 'Q' shape. The pits were dug from the end of the Middle Ages up to around 1760, the start of the Industrial Revolution.Muir, Richard (2008). Woods, Hedgerows and Leafy Lanes. Pub. Tempus, Stroud. . p. 92. Potash pits were of a similar shape and size, however, they were used to make potash for use in coursing or degreasing wool and were once found in sheep rearing areas. Geographical location The pits are a common feature in lead mining districts such as the Leadhills in Scotland and East Derbyshire. Due to their small size, they are not likely to be confused with quarries, although bomb craters from World War II can occasionally lead the landscape historian astray. In 2007 an isolated example was identified and excavated in Westbury-sub-Mendip near the lead smelting areas on the Mendip Hills in Somerset.Lane, Barry (2008). \\"A Q-pit on Lodge Hill, Westbury-sub-Mendip, Somerset\\".

He wrote more than twenty pieces for the theatre, as well as numerous shorter works, including his famous poem, Lasca. Life and career Desprez was born in Bristol, England, the eldest of the eleven children of Charles Desprez, a jeweller and silversmith. The family was of French descent. He was educated at Cosham School, Wiltshire and spent three years in his teens in the U.S. State of Texas. In 1883, Desprez married Jessie Louisa Potter Macqueen. They had a son and two daughters. Librettist and assistant to Richard D'Oyly Carte Desprez returned to Britain in 1875. His first piece written for the theatre shortly thereafter was an adaptation of La fille de Madame Angot. When this piece went on the road in 1876, he also wrote a companion piece for it called Happy Hampstead, which was set to music by the theatrical agent and composer Richard D'Oyly Carte. Desprez became a close friend of Carte's and worked with him for many years as Carte's secretary. At the same time Desprez wrote the texts for ten short works for D'Oyly Carte, most of which accompanied the Gilbert and Sullivan operas on the bills at the Opera Comique and later the Savoy Theatre. These pieces had long runs in tandem with, and sometimes beyond, the runs of the principal pieces, and they were usually played on tour throughout Britain as companion pieces, benefit pieces and short-programme items. Working with composers such as Alfred Cellier and Edward Solomon, Desprez became perhaps the most popular librettist of one-act operas in Britain. The Nautch Girl, 1891 Desprez's most frequently played work was his 1879 two-act musical play, Tita in Thibet, which was later played in the British provinces by the Majilton company more than a thousand times. It was written as a vehicle for the music hall star Kate Santley. W. H. Seymour, who would become the stage manager of the D'Oyly Carte Opera Company for 20 years, also played in the piece. The story concerns an unusual marriage custom purportedly to be found \\"in out of the way parts of the world\\" such as Tibet. The customs of the country permit every wife to have four husbands. The reviewer from The Era did not find the piece \\"refined\\" enough for his taste. Desprez's best work as a lyricist was The Nautch Girl, or, The Rajah of Chutneypore, which played at the Savoy Theatre in 1891-92. Poet, essayist, journalist, and editor Desprez' best-known work, however, is a poem, Lasca, about a Mexican girl and her cowboy sweetheart caught in a cattle stampede \\"in Texas down by the Rio Grande.\\" The ballad-like poem, first published in a London magazine in 1882, has often been reprinted, usually with deletions and changes, and recited in many parts of the English- speaking world. Between 1873 and 1882 at least four other of Desprez's poems had been published, two of which are about Texas. In 1884, Desprez began writing for The Era, London's foremost theatre paper, and he became its editor in 1893, a position he held until illness forced him to retire in 1913. Desprez also wrote dozens of essays on travel, art, music, and famous personalities that were published in English periodicals, most of them between 1905 and 1914. Desprez died in London at the age of 63.

His brother was there as well, since after Denonville's betrayal of the Iroquois sachems it became impossible for the priests to continue to work at the missions. Jean Lamberville occasionally travelled to Fort Conti at the mouth of the Niagara River. Jacques was appointed to teach at the Jesuit college in Quebec. In 1689 he was among the Mohawk at Sault-Saint-Louis, and in 1692 he was at Montreal. Like his elder brother, he lived among the Iroquois during a period when the rivalry of the French and English to secure the alliance of that nation endangered the lives of the missionaries. His brother having returned to France due to poor health, in 1701, the sixty year old Lamberville returned to the mission among the Onondaga at their request, only to leave in 1709 through the intrigues of Abraham Schuyler, who instigated drunken Indians to burn the chapel and the priest's residence while Lamberville was away on a trip to Montreal.

The word Mazhabi is derived from the Urdu term mazhab (Mazhab means religion or sect), and can be translated as the faithful. They live mainly in Indian Punjab, Rajasthan and Haryana. The definition of Mazhabi today is somewhat blurred because of the influence of Valmikism. Mazhabis are best known for military service in the Sikh Khalsa Army, British Indian Army and post- independence Indian Army. Origins When Guru Tegh Bahadur, the ninth Sikh guru, was killed by the Mughals in Delhi, three lower caste members recovered his dismembered body from a Muslim crowd and brought it back to his son, Guru Gobind Singh. In recognition of their act, he admitted the untouchables into the Khalsa (the Sikh faith), giving them the name Mazhabi (\\"faithful\\"). Divisions Within the present-day Mazhabi community, one group calls itself the Ranghreta and claims a higher status on the grounds that one of their ancestors was Bhai Jaita Ranghreta, who carried the head of Tegh Bahadur from Delhi to Guru Gobind Singh in Anandpur Sahib. The definition of Mazhabi today is somewhat blurred because of the influence of Valmikism. While Sikhism is in theory an egalitarian faith that takes no notice of caste, gender and other social demarcations, Fenech and Singh note that \\"there is often a level of hypocrisy between what is taught and what is actually put into practice.\\" Mazhabis are discriminated against by Sikhs whose origins lie with higher- ranked castes and many Chuhras have turned to Valmikism but are still referred to as Mazhabi. While young Valmikis, who accept Valmiki as their guru, increasingly object to being labelled as Sikh, their elders are less concerned. At least one of their organisations, the Valmiki-Mazhabi Sikh Morcha, conflates the terms. Mazhabis who converted from Sikhism to Christianity under the influence of Christian missionaries in the later years of the British Raj are sometimes referred to as Christian Mazhabi Sikhs. Some also profess Hinduism but call themselves Mazhabi, as do a small number who follow the tenets of Buddhism. Military service Before the British Raj era The Mazhabis were recruited to the army of Ranjit Singh but as separate companies attached to regular battalions rather than as part of an integrated force. This situation was forced upon him because high-caste Sikhs refused any closer connection. They served as pioneers, operating mainly as a labour corps that worked on construction of roads, bridges and canals. They were not, however, mere labourers because it was expected that their infantry skills would enable them to defend themselves in the event of attack. British Raj The Mazhabis, whom historian Stephen Cohen says \\"had strong caste traditions of violence and aggressiveness and were classed as a criminal caste by the British\\", lost their military employment following the defeat of the Sikhs in the Anglo-Sikh Wars. Some eventually found employment as pioneers in the army of Gulab Singh, the Maharaja of Jammu and Kashmir. In 1857, the British turned to them for help during the Indian Rebellion, apparently to counteract the rebellious sepoys of the Bengal Army. The First Pioneer Sikh Regiment soon found itself helping to break the Siege of Delhi, a second regiment was raised in 1858 and a third followed soon after. This military employment contributed to a gradual improvement in their social status and in 1911 their official classification in Gujranwala and Lyallpur was uplifted to that of \\"agricultural caste\\" by the British authorities. The British military classification system, which rated recruits according to their caste, continued to assert that Mazhabis were best suited as pioneers while, for example, Jat Sikhs should be infantry. They were deployed at the Siege of Lucknow and Capture of Lucknow during the 1857 Indian Rebellion. It was calculated in 1898 that there were 2,452 Mazhabis in the army, along with 28,146 Jat Sikhs and 9,000 other Sikhs. During World War I the single- battalion regiments of the Mazhabi Sikh Pioneers ‚Äì the 23rd, 32nd and 34th Pioneer Regiments ‚Äì were expanded to comprise three battalions each. These units served in Egypt, Europe, Mesopotamia and Palestine and performed well. The 1/34th Sikh Pioneers were awarded the title of \\"Royal\\". The Sikh Pioneer regiments, which were practically the only military employer of the Mazhabis, were disbanded in December 1932. The cause was mainly advances in road- building techniques and the need to economise. Most of their recruits were released from the army, the only means by which they had been able to advance themselves in society. A Mazhabi Sikh platoon did replace Rajputs as the Indian Platoon of the Welch Regiment in 1933. The Sikh Light Infantry march past during the Republic day parade in New Delhi, India The Mazhabi Sikhs, together with the Ramdasia, were recruited to the Sikh Light Infantry regiment (SLI) after its formation in 1941. Despite unwillingness among some policy makers, the British had to abandon their traditional distinction between martial and non-martial races during the Second World War. This was necessitated by the need for more recruits than could be supplied by those communities upon which they usually relied, such as the Jat Sikhs, Dogras and Punjabi Musalmans. In addition, indiscipline among Jat Sikhs caused by their concerns regarding a post-war division of India was another reason to prefer recruitment of new classes. While recruitment from the pre-war martial classes was still pre-eminent, that from newly recognised classes such as the Mazhabis and Ramdasias became significant. Mazhabis were even recruited into units such as the 13th Frontier Force Rifles, which previously would not have contemplated them. After independence of India When India became independent in 1947, the British Indian Army became the Indian Army. This, like its predecessor, relies on the martial race theory for much of its recruitment and thus there is a grossly disproportionate number of Sikhs within its ranks. The Mazhabi Sikhs and Ramdasias continued their service with the SLI in the new army. The SLI has served in almost all of the post-1947 conflicts involving India, including the wars with Pakistan in 1947, 1965 and 1971, the Hyderabad Police Action of 1948 and the Chinese aggression in 1962. It has also served in Sri Lanka, where the 1st, 7th, 13th and 14th Battalions have contributed towards peace-keeping. The Mazhabi Sikh soldiers have a reputation for their loyalty and reliability. During Operation Blue Star in 1984, when the Indian Army entered the Golden Temple, Jat Sikh soldiers broke out in mutiny against their officers in the Sikh Regiment and Punjab regiments A total of 2,000 Sikh personnel took part in the mutinies. In the most sensational case 1,400 mainly Jat Sikhs deserted after killing their commanding officer and armed themselves. A significant number of those were also new recruits who were incited easily into mutiny and some were forced at gun point to take part in the mutinies. Despite that, the Indian Army officers were correct when they expressed confidence to journalists that the Mazhabi Sikhs of the Sikh Light Infantry would not mutiny. In Punjab, Sikh militants had stepped up their attacks on law enforcement as well as civilians, including minority groups. The Punjab had now reached a state of emergency and Director General of Police, Kanwar Pal Singh Gill, responded by raising Mazhabi Sikhs as \\"Special Police Officers\\". This tactic was designed both for community protection and to dull any incentive for Mazhabis to join with the militants, although in fact Mazhabis had often been victims of attacks by those people. Their loyalty was to the government and was never questioned. Mostly unemployed people, they were provided with guns by the state and were literally given a licence to kill. Gill received heavy criticism for the brutality and ruthlessness of his tactics but the Sikh militants were neutralised. A large number of these special police officers were said to have been used during the February 1992 elections. An open season was declared on Sikh terrorists and the police were able to use whatever means deemed necessary to achieve victory. Major Sikh militant leaders were targeted, and many did not survive. Social status Discrimination within the Sikh community Most of them live in separate clusters in villages. As the 19th century drew to a close, untouchables such as the Mazhabis were still denied equal access to the gurdwara (places of worship) by their fellow Sikhs and during the early years of the 20th century members of the Arya Samaj tried to capitalise on this in their attempts to reconvert those groups to Hinduism. In spite of Sikhism's egalitarian tenets, the Singh Sabha movement also viewed them as being inferior, despite initially being established in 1873 in part with the aim of eradicating untouchability. The British Raj system of land allocation in the Punjab also worked against the Mazhabis. As land in the new canal colonies was made available for cultivation, the Raj allocated it to people on the basis of the scale of existing landholdings, which meant that dominant landholding communities such as the Jats received most of the that became available between 1885‚Äì1940 while outcastes were excluded entirely. During the numerous discussions, conferences and proposals that preceded Indian independence, the Mazhabis sought to obtain an autonomous region within partitioned Punjab which they proposed to be called \\"Mazbhistan\\". This was one of many instances reflecting the lack of coherence among adherents of Sikhism at that time. Many Jat Sikhs continue to look down upon the Mazhabis, and they are also considered to be of lower status by the other Dalit communities, being the Ramdasia and Ravidasia. The internal division between Jat Sikh and Mazhabi still broadly follows the economic distinction between farmer and landless labourer. It is land-ownership rather than varna's stress on occupational status that defines discrimination within the Sikh communities of the Punjab, and Ronki Ram notes that the nature of untouchability itself in Punjab differs from the rest of India because it is \\"related more to prejudice than pollution\\". Many Mazhabi are still exploited in low-status jobs, they are often forced to live in less desirable areas of villages, cannot use the gurdwaras frequented by higher-caste Sikhs and must use special cremation grounds. Politics The outcome of the Shiromani Gurdwara Prabandhak Committee (SGPC) elections in December 1954 favoured Punjabi Suba, a Jat Sikh- dominated movement. Akali Dal, a religio-political party founded in 1920 and dominated by Jat Sikhs, won all 111 seats that it contested and Khalsa Dal ‚Äì a new party created with government support ‚Äì managing to win only three of the 132 in which it put forward a candidate. The campaign saw the Arya Samaj and Jan Sangh, who were both opposed to Punjabi Suba and believed in Hindu supremacy, stressing a fear of Sikh domination. They encouraged Hindu Punjabis to lie by claiming Hindi to be their first language even when it was almost always in fact Punjabi. This attempt to cause a division along religious lines had the tacit support of the government and its impact echoed down the years. In 2005, 56 expelled employees of the SGPC abandoned Sikhism and alleged that they were being discriminated against because they were Mazhabis. According to a report published in The Tribune on 16 March 1966, a spokesperson for the Federation of Mazhabi Sikhs stated that \\"the Sikh Scheduled Castes had been reduced to a position of mere serfs by the Sikh landlords who would literally crush the Mazhabi Sikhs if Punjabi Suba was formed.\\" The federation offered support for Arya Samaj and Jan Sangh in opposition to the Punjabi Suba. Although Sikh leaders recognise the contribution of the Mazhabis and Ravidasias to the community and have tried to include them in their organisations, not least because of the size of their population, both groups still feel alienated because of discrimination by higher-caste Sikhs, especially the Jats. It is because of this that they have turned to political parties such as the Bahujan Samaj Party rather than maintaining past associations with Sikh politics through the Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD) and SGPC. Modern-day conversions In 2014, both the SAD and the Indian National Congress (INC) voiced their opposition to Christian Mazhabi people being reconverted to the Sikh faith in a ceremony organised by the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS). Parkash Singh Badal, then Chief Minister of Punjab and an SAD elder, said that such conversions are \\"unfortunate and against the basic tenets of Sikhism as Sikh gurus sacrificed their lives resisting conversion\\", while Amarinder Singh of the INC considered the move by the Hindutva-centric RSS to be \\"forced conversion\\". The RSS said that it was not sponsoring conversion to Hinduism but rather to Sikhism and that the SGPC had been lax in stemming the tide of poor Sikh families switching to Christianity. It was claimed by an RSS colleague, Ram Gopal, that 2,470 people had already been converted in the year prior to the controversy being commented upon and that the SGPC had initially supported the idea. There were also protests by Christians, who claimed that the conversions were an attempt by the RSS to drive a wedge between their religion and Sikhism where previously there had been a harmonious relationship. Reservation The Government of India recognises Mazhabi Sikh as a Scheduled Caste as part of their official affirmative action program. Demographics Between 30,000 and 40,000 Mazhabi Sikhs were reported to be congregated at Govindghar in an attempt to reach India during the Partition of India and Pakistan in 1947. This was one of many examples of the mass migrations that took place across the border in both directions as communities found themselves in the midst of violence driven by religious differences. , there were 2,633,921 Mazhabis in the Indian state of Punjab, of whom 2,562,761 declared themselves to be Sikh, 71,000 as Hindu and 160 as Buddhists. The total Scheduled Caste population of the state was 8,860,179. At that time, there were 158,698 Mazhabis in Rajasthan, comprising 11,582 Hindus, 147,108 Sikhs and 8 Buddhists. 141,681 lived in Haryana (11,485 Hindu, 130,162 Sikh and 34 Buddhists), 460 resided in Himachal Pradesh, 3,166 in Chandigarh, 2,829 in Delhi NCT, 6,038 in Uttarakhand, and 14,192 in Uttar Pradesh.

From 2005 she came to widespread public attention with her performances as Cleopatra in Giulio Cesare at Glyndebourne, England. Early life De Niese was born in Melbourne, Victoria, Australia, after her parents, Chris and Beverly, had migrated from Sri Lanka to Australia as teenagers. She is a Sri Lankan Burgher with some Dutch and Scottish heritage. In 1988, at the age of nine, she became the youngest winner of the Australian TV talent competition, Young Talent Time. In the competition, she was singing a Whitney Houston medley, for which the prize was A$ 5,000 and a Yamaha baby grand piano, which she still owns. In 1990, her family moved to Los Angeles, where she became a regular guest host of the TV programme L.A. Kids for which she won an Emmy Award at the age of 16. Career De Niese made her professional operatic debut at the age of 15 with the Los Angeles Opera. She became the youngest singer ever to participate in the Young Artists Studio at the Metropolitan Opera, where she debuted in 1998 at the age of 19 as Barbarina in a new production of The Marriage of Figaro directed by Jonathan Miller and conducted by James Levine. She studied voice privately with Ruth Falcon, and at the Mannes College of Music in Manhattan. Ridley Scott's 2001 film Hannibal features a scene from Dante's La Vita Nuova; in it, de Niese sings as the character Beatrice the song \\"Vide Cor Meum\\" by Patrick Cassidy.

He was the older brother of Jacques de Lamberville. Jean became a missionary to the Onondagas and had success in converting their chief, Garakontie. He also was well known for his knowledge in the medical treatments of his time. Life Jean de Lamberville was born in Rouen 27 December 1633. He entered the Jesuit novitiate in Paris on 3 March 1656. He sailed for New France in 1667 and was assigned to the missions. In 1672 he was sent to the mission of Saint-Jean-Baptiste at Onondaga to replace Pierre Millet, who had been transferred to the Mission of Francis Xavier at Oneida.McKeough, James A., \\"Silver Anniversary of the Millet Cross\\", Woodstock Letters, Vol. LXXXII, No. 2, May 1, 1952 In 1677, Lamberville was appointed superior of the missions among the Five Nations. He maintained distant but cordial relations with the Dutch and English traders to the south, even on returning a stolen gun and powder box to Jeremiah Van Rensselaer, although he declined to return a runaway slave to Albany.Jaenen, C. J., ‚ÄúLamberville, Jean de‚Äù, Dictionary of Canadian Biography, vol. 2, University of Toronto/Universit√© Laval, 2003 Governor Daniel de R√©my de Courcelle instructed Ren√©-Robert Cavelier, Sieur de La Salle to identify a location for the construction of a fort, which would also serve as a location for trade with the Iroquois. De La Salle, who, like Lamberville, was also from Rouen, consulted the priest. The fort, at the mouth of the Cataraqui River, was built in 1673 under Governor Louis de Buade de Frontenac and was later called Fort Frontenac.Cataraqui Archaeological Research Foundation, Fort Frontenac Retrieved 2017-07-09 In 1686 Governor Denonville asked Lamberville to persuade the Iroquois chiefs to come to Fort Frontenac for a parley. Denonville made a similar request to Pierre Millet, whom he asked to serve as interpreter. The Iroquios sachems had been lulled into meeting under a flag of truce. Denonville had them seized, chained, and shipped off to Marseilles, France, to serve in the galley fleet. This made it impossible for the missionaries to return to the Iroquois.Campeau, Lucien. ‚ÄúMillet, Pierre‚Äù, Dictionary of Canadian Biography, vol. 2, University of Toronto/Universit√© Laval, 2003‚Äì Lamberville received word of this from some English traders at Onondaga, who urged the priest to return with them to the safety of New York, where Governor Dongan, would arrange passage to France. However, Lamberville proceeded to the fort, where he was able to effect the release of several of those captured. While Denonville pursued his campaign against the Seneca, Lamberville remained as chaplain at Frontenac, where he and a good part of the garrison came down with scurvy. He sometimes visited Fort Denonville, which the governor had built on the site of De La Salle's Fort Conti on the eastern bank of the Niagara River at its mouth, on Lake Ontario. By 1687, Lamberville was so ill he had to be removed to Montreal.Corrigan, Michael. \\"Register of the Clergy Laboring in the Archdiocese of New York\\", Historical Records and Studies, Vol. 1, United States Catholic Historical Society, 1899 p. 28 He had spent fourteen years with the Onondaga Iroquois.Lindsay, Lionel. \\"Jacques and Jean de Lamberville.\\" The Catholic Encyclopedia Vol. 8.

Many had formerly lived in Shanghai within the Shanghai International Settlement before its occupation by the Japanese army. J. G. Ballard was interned in the camp as an adolescent. His experiences there inspired the book (and subsequent movie) Empire of the Sun. Description Lunghua Civil Assembly Centre was originally the Jiangsu Shanghai High School. It was located on Minghong Road about three miles (5 km) from Shanghai Longhua Airport. (Pre-WWII documents use the alternate spellings of Lunghua and Lunghwa; the modern anglicized spelling of the town is Longhua.) The school was damaged in the Second Sino-Japanese War and was empty until it was designated as a Civil Assembly Centre. It was then used from 1943 to intern 1,988 people. > \\"The camp was large, containing seven concrete buildings, five large wooden > barracks (originally built as stables by the Japanese), and numerous > outbuildings.

Therefore, in the description below, when a building is described as being built east‚Äìwest it is more accurately described as ENE‚ÄìWSW, and when a building is described as being built north‚Äìsouth, it is more accurately described as SSW‚ÄìNNE. The Assembly Hall was the central building. North of it were the single storey wooden buildings A, B and C. These were built parallel to each other, with each having been built east‚Äìwest and with Building A as the furthest north. South of the Assembly Hall, also built east‚Äìwest, was the three storey Building F, which was the administration block. South of Building F was the entrance and southeast was the three storey Building E built north‚Äìsouth. East of the Assembly Hall was the three storey Building D which was an accommodation block for families, built north‚Äìsouth. West of the Assembly Hall and the wooden buildings were two ruined buildings built north‚Äìsouth and further west of the ruined buildings was the two storey Building G built east‚Äìwest. Northwest of Building G, in the northwest corner of the site, was the single storey Hospital which was built east‚Äìwest. The hospital dealt with malaria sufferers. Women who became pregnant were sent to a hospital in Shanghai then moved on to another camp for women and babies. Between Building G and the Hospital were the five Commandant's Staff Residences arranged around a square with three on the northern edge and two on the western edge. Building G was on the southern edge. North of the wooden buildings were the two single-storey dining rooms (built east‚Äìwest), and north of each of those was a single-storey kitchen. In the northeast corner of the site, north of Building D, were two parallel, single-storey buildings built north‚Äìsouth. These were Building H, which was used to accommodate single people, and Building I (or J, the documents differ as to the name of this building). North of these were the single-storey shower block (built east‚Äìwest) and east of the shower block was another single-storey building built north‚Äìsouth, Building J (or K, the documents differ as to the name of this building).

The Ultimate Soul Music Trivia Book \\"Brown eyed soul\\" contrasts with blue-eyed soul, soul music performed by non- Hispanic white artists. History Soul music emerged from the 1950s simultaneously on the East Coast United States, in the Hispanic communities, and on the West Coast, in the much larger Hispanic communities. Chicago soul and Motown hits were crowd favorites at dances and clubs during the late 1950s and early 1960s. Latino artists began to draw inspiration from the Motown hits, and as a result, Latino soul began sounding very similar to Black soul. Early artists owed little to traditional Latin and rarely performed in Spanish.Gregory, Hugh. Soul Music A-Z Ritchie Valens, one of the original pioneers of \\"brown-eyed soul\\" music, also became one of the first artists to bring traditional Latin music and rock and roll influences to his brand of soul music. Latino groups on the East and West Coast also drew from the funk- influenced Philadelphia soul, or \\"Philly\\" soul. The West Coast Latin rock scene continued to influence other Latino soul musicians as well. Inspired by Ritchie Valens, 1960s and 1970s bands such as Cannibal & the Headhunters (\\"Land of a Thousand Dances\\") and Thee Midniters played R&B; music with a rebellious rock and roll edge. Many of these artists drew from the frat rock and garage rock scenes. However, the large Hispanic population on the West Coast began gradually moving away from energetic R&B; to romantic soul, and the results were \\"some of the sweetest soul music heard during the late '60s and '70s.\\" Notes 1970s in Latin music 1960s in Latin music Soul music Hispanic American music ","title":"Brown-eyed soul"},{"id":"6487161","text":"Roll the Dice may refer to: * Roll the Dice (band), a Swedish analogue electronic music duo * Roll the Dice (album), an album by Damone * \\"Roll the Dice\\" (song), a song by British singer-songwriter Steve Harley * \\"Roll the Dice\\", a song by Dusty Trails from the album Dusty Trails * \\"Roll the Dice\\", a song by rapper Shawty Lo * Roll the Dice, the autobiography of Darius Guppy ","title":"Roll the Dice"},{"id":"6487170","text":"Rosemarie Wenner (born July 1, 1955) is a German Methodist bishop.

Its highest peak, at the north end of the mountain, is above sea level. The mountain has three secondary peaks, White Ledges at ; North Peak at ; and South Peak at . The north end of the mountain, including the summit, is within Mount Sunapee State Park, which encompasses and is home to the popular Mount Sunapee Resort. The mountain extends south to Pillsbury State Park in the towns of Goshen and Washington. The entire mountain ridge is traversed by the Monadnock-Sunapee Greenway, a hiking trail that links the summit of Sunapee with that of Mount Monadnock, to the south in the town of Jaffrey, New Hampshire. Also crossing the summit in an east-west route is a section of the Sunapee-Ragged-Kearsarge Greenway, a trail linking ten towns in west-central New Hampshire as it circles the Lake Sunapee region and crosses the summits of the three mountains for which it is named. The two Greenway trails meet at Lake Solitude and use the same trail to the summit.  Hydrology  The ridgeline of Sunapee Mountain forms the divide between the Merrimack River and Connecticut River watersheds. Lake Solitude, a body of water, lies just southeast of the White Ledges summit, at an elevation of . The lake flows into Andrew Brook, a tributary of the Warner River in the Merrimack River watershed. Farther south along the ridge, the east slopes of the mountain drain via the West Branch of the Warner River into the Warner and Merrimack rivers. The northern and western sides of the mountain drain to the Connecticut River. Johnson Brook flows down the north slopes of the mountain, entering Lake Sunapee, the outlet of which (the Sugar River) flows west to the Connecticut in Claremont. On the western slopes of the mountain, Gunnison Brook, Blood Brook, and Baker Brook flow to the South Branch of the Sugar River. The southwestern end of the mountain drains via Cherry Brook into the headwaters of the Ashuelot River, which reaches the Connecticut River near the Massachusetts border.U.S. Geological Survey 7.5-minute topographic map series: Newport, NH (1984)  Recreation  Hikers viewing Lake Solitude (2510' above sea level) from White Ledges Snow skiing and snowboard riding are popular winter activities at Mount Sunapee Resort & Ski Area. The ski area lies within Mount Sunapee State Park, but in 1998 the state leased the ski area of the park to be operated by Tim and Dianne Mueller, who own Okemo Mountain Resort. New lifts were added in 1998. The state park's extensive trail system is used in all seasons for hiking and in winter for snowshoeing. The park is linked to Pillsbury State Park and southern New Hampshire by the Monadnock-Sunapee Greenway and to the ten-town Lake Sunapee region by the \\"emerald necklace\\" of the Sunapee-Ragged-Kearsarge (SRK) Greenway which connects Mt. Sunapee to Wadleigh State Park in Sutton and to Winslow and Rollins State Parks on Mount Kearsarge in Warner and Wilmot. From the ski area parking, the Summit Trail travels along the western slope to the summit, where it meets the Solitude Trail for a walk to Lake Solitude and White Ledges. The Solitude Trail then links to several trails, notably the popular Andrew Brook Trail and the steeper Newbury Trail, both heading eastward, and to the M-S Greenway as it heads south along Sunapee Mountain toward Pillsbury State Park.

The term is generally translated as \\"encyclopedia\\", although the leishu are quite different from the modern notion of encyclopedia. The leishu are composed of sometimes lengthy citations from other works, and often contain copies of entire works, not just excerpts. The works are classified by a systematic set of categories, which are further divided into subcategories. Leishu may be considered anthologies, but are encyclopedic in the sense that they may comprise the entire realm of knowledge at the time of compilation. Approximately 600 leishu were compiled from the early third century until the eighteenth century, of which 200 have survived. The largest leishu ever compiled was the 1408 Yongle Encyclopedia, containing 370 million Chinese characters, and the largest ever printed was the Gujin Tushu Jicheng, containing 100 million characters and 852,408 pages. History The Yongle Dadian, the largest leishu ever compiled The genre first appeared in the early third century. The earliest known was the Huanglan (\\"Emperor's mirror\\"). Sponsored by the emperor of Cao Wei, it was compiled around 220, but has since been lost. However, the term leishu was not used until the Song dynasty (960‚Äì1279). In later imperial China dynasties, such as the Ming and Qing, emperors sponsored monumental projects to compile all known human knowledge into a single leishu, in which entire works, rather than excerpts, were copied and classified by category. The largest leishu ever compiled, on the order of the Yongle Emperor of Ming, was the Yongle Dadian containing a total of 370 million Chinese characters. The project involved 2,169 scholars, who worked for four years under general editor Yao Guangxiao. It was completed in 1408, but never printed, as the imperial treasury had run out of money. The Qinding Gujin Tushu Jicheng (Imperially approved synthesis of books and illustrations past and present) is by far the largest leishu ever printed, containing 100 million characters and 852,408 pages. It was compiled by a team of scholars led by Chen Menglei, and printed between 1726 and 1728, during the Qing dynasty. The riyong leishu (encyclopedias for daily use), containing practical information for people who were literate but below the Confucian elite, were also compiled in the later imperial era. Today, they provide scholars with valuable information on non-elite culture and attitudes. According to Jean-Pierre Di√©ny, the Jiaqing reign (1796‚Äì1820) of the Qing dynasty saw the end of the publication of leishu. In other countries The world map entitled Shanhai Yudi Quantu, from the Sancai Tuhui, an illustrated leishu Other countries in East Asia also adopted the genre of leishu. In 1712, the Sancai Tuhui, a richly illustrated leishu compiled by Ming scholar Wang Qi (ÁéãÂúª) in the early 17th century, was printed in Japan as Wakan Sansai Zue. The Japanese version was edited by Terajima Ry≈çan (ÂØ∫Â≥∂ËâØÂÆâ), a physician born in Osaka. Importance The leishu have played an important role in the preservation of ancient works, many of which have been lost, only preserved completely or partially as part of a leishu compilation. The 7th-century Yiwen Leiju is especially valuable. It contains excerpts from 1,400 pre-7th century works, 90% of which have been otherwise lost. Even though the Yongle Dadian is itself largely lost, the remnants still contain 385 complete books that have been otherwise lost. The leishu also provide a unique view of the transmission of knowledge and education, and an easy way to locate traditional materials on any given subject. Major compilations Approximately 600 leishu were compiled, from the Cao Wei period (early third century) until the 18th century, of which 200 have survived. Among the most important, in chronological order, are: *Yiwen Leiju (Collection of literature arranged by categories), compiled by Ouyang Xun *Beitang Shuchao (Excerpts from books in the Northern Hall), compiled by Yu Shinan ca. 630 *Chuxue Ji (Writings for elementary instruction), compiled by Xu Jian et al. between 713 and 742 *Taiping Yulan (Taiping Imperial Reader), compiled by Li Fang et al., published 984 *Cefu Yuangui (Outstanding models from the storehouse of literature), compiled by Wang Qinruo et al., completed in 1013 *Yuhai (Ocean of jade), compiled by Wang Yinglin 1330‚Äì40 *Yongle Dadian, completed 1408, the largest leishu ever compiled *Qinding Gujin Tushu Jicheng, 1726‚Äì28, the largest leishu ever printed  Notes   References   Citations   Cited works  Anthologies Chinese classic texts Chinese encyclopedias Reference works ","title":"Leishu"},{"id":"6487335","text":"Larry F.

His name is derived from the Middle High German grob or grop, meaning coarse or vulgar. The Old High German cognate is gerob, gerop. The word \\"grobian\\" has thus passed into the English language as an obscure word for any crude, sloppy, or buffoonish person. History Narrenschiff The satirist Sebastian Brant (1457-1521) conceived Saint Grobian as the patron saint of coarse manners in his famous poem Das Narrenschiff (1494). Das Narrenschiff describes the worship paid to this new saint. Grobian is found later in several works of the period. Friedrich Dedekind (1524-1598) published Grobianus et Grobiana: sive, de morum simplicitate, libri tres in 1558 at Cologne. Here Grobian is a counselor who teaches men on how to avoid bad manners, gluttony, and drunkenness. Dedekind's work appeared in England in 1605 as The Schoole of Slovenrie: Or, Cato turnd wrong side outward, published by one \\"R.F.\\". The \\"Schoole\\" was imagined as a place where one was instructed to use one's greasy fingers to grab at the nicest portions of any dish and snatch food belonging to fellow diners. Holding back the desire to urinate, fart, and vomit is taught to be bad for one's health; thus, one has to indulge freely in all three activities. The work also inspired Thomas Dekker's The Guls Horne-Booke (1609). The German writer Melchior Meyr is the author of a work entitled Gespr√§che mit einem Grobian (1866). Sebastian Brant's allegory was translated into English by Alexander Barclay and Henry Watson as Ship of Fools, both in 1509. See also ship of fools.

She was knighted in 1988 for her services to medicine and public health.Forename Rosalinde, not Rosalind, as per obituaries and London Gazette notice of damehood Her public positions included: Consultant Microbiologist, Queen Charlotte's Hospital (1963‚Äì95); Honorary Consultant (1995‚Äì2004; her death), Professor of Microbiology, London University (1973‚Äì75); Professor Emeritus, 1975‚Äì95), Board Member, Public Health Laboratory Service (PHLS), Chairman, The Medicines Commission (1982‚Äì93), President of the Pathology Section, Royal Society of Medicine (awarded the C. ver Heyden de Lancey prize, 1991). She was a professor and consultant medical microbiologist, researcher, and ethicist, as well as a barrister; she applied her legal training and expertise for the benefit of her medical, and especially her microbiological, practice. Biography Born in England on 30 December 1929 to a Roman Catholic family, the daughter of William and Rose Hurley, her early education was at the Academy of the Assumption in Massachusetts. She remained a lifelong Catholic. She and her brother had been evacuated to the United States during the Second World War to live with a friend of her father. She returned to England in 1948 and studied medicine at Charing Cross Hospital Medical School while at the same time studying law. In four years she qualified in medicine (LRCP, MRCS and MBBS in 1955) and became a Barrister at Law. She never practiced law, but the training made her an effective administrator, and she gave informal legal advice to the Royal College of Pathologists and elsewhere. She took the Diploma in Literature of the University of London in 1956 and won the Gilchrist Prize and the Churton Collins Prize in Literature while a pre-registration house officer at the Wembley and West London hospitals. She was called to the Bar at the Inner Temple in 1958 and was awarded LLB in 1959 while a lecturer and assistant clinical pathologist at Charing Cross Hospital and Medical School. Her medical thesis on perinatal candida infections led her permanent interest in mycology. She later became a member of the Public Health Laboratory Service (PHLS) Board when the Service's infectious diseases surveillance role was becoming more prominent and the Communicable Disease Surveillance Centre was also expanding. By the 1980s the PHLS needed an ethical review of its own research projects as well as advice regarding the ethics of its broader programmes of disease surveillance and vaccine evaluation. Dr Hurley established a committee that reported to the Board but operated independently of it. After she had completed two terms as a Board member, she continued as the Ethics Committee chair until the mid-1990s.Notice of death of Professor Dame Rosalinde Hurley , hpa.org.uk; accessed 26 April 2014.

Edublogs archive and support student and teacher learning by facilitating reflection, questioning by self and others, collaboration and by providing contexts for engaging in higher-order thinking. Edublogs proliferated when blogging architecture became more simplified and teachers perceived the instructional potential of blogs as an online resource. The use of blogs has become popular in education institutions including public schools and colleges.Richardson, Will (2006) Blogs, Wikis, Podcasts. Corwin Press Blogs can be useful tools for sharing information and tips among co-workers, providing information for students, or keeping in contact with parents. Common examples include blogs written by or for teachers, blogs maintained for the purpose of classroom instruction, or blogs written about educational policy. Educators who blog are sometimes called edubloggers. History Weblogs have existed for close to two decades. However, it wasn't until the second half of the 1990s that weblogs began to grow in popularity. In 1998, there were just a handful of sites of the type that are now identified as weblogs (so named by Jorn Barger in December 1997). In 1999, there were 23 known weblogs, and Pitas http://www.pitas.com/, the first free build your own weblog tool, was launched. Also in 1999 weblogs changed from a mix of links, commentary, and thoughts, to short form journal entries. An early recorded use of the term \\"edublog\\" can be traced to a webring called the Edublog WebRing, founded on January 30, 2002. The new use of weblogs are largely interest driven and attract readers who have similar interests. In 2004, there were an estimated 3 million blogs and as of July 2011, there are an estimated 164 million blogs. The Edublog Awards, the international and community based awards programme for the use of blogs and social media to support education, runs annually online across a range of platforms. The Awards were founded by James N. Farmer in 2004. Uses There are several uses of edublogs. Some bloggers use their blogs as a learning journal or a knowledge log to gather relevant information and ideas, and communicate with other people. Some teachers use blogs to keep in contact with students' parents. Some bloggers use blogs to record their own personal life, and express emotions or feelings. Some instructors use blogs as an instructional and assessment tool, and blogs can be used as a task management tool. Blogs are used to teach individuals about writing for an audience as they can be made public, and blogging software makes it easier to create content for the Web without knowing much HTML. Educational blogs have also been used as an engagement and reflective assessment tool for Accounting students and can improve educational outcomes for Accounting students. Teacher blogs There are many teacher-related blogs on the internet where teachers can share information with one another. Teachers familiarize themselves with edublogs before implementing them with their students. Many teachers share materials and ideas to meet the diverse needs of all learners in their classrooms. Teachers can often rely on these sources to communicate with one another regarding any issues in education that they may be having, including classroom management techniques and policies. In this way, the blog often acts as a support system for teachers where they can access ideas, tools, and gain support and recognition from other professionals in their field. Weblogs can provide a forum for reading, writing and collaborating. Edublogs can be used as instructional resources, in which teachers can post tips, explanations or samples to help students learn. The use of blogs in the classroom allows both the teacher and student the ability to edit and add content at any time. The ability for both the teacher and student to edit content allows for study to take place outside the classroom environment, since blogs can usually be accessed using the URL of the blog on any computer. Blogs increase exposure to other students from around the country or world, while improving writing and communication skills. Teachers are using blogs as a way to post important information such as homework, important dates, missed lessons, projects, discussion boards, and other useful classroom information that is accessible by all. As noted, students can access this information from home, or from any computer that is connected to the Internet. Teachers and parents can also use blogs in order to communicate with one another. They can be used to post class announcements for parents or providing schedule reminders. Connecting to a teacher's blog is also a convenient way for parents to find out daily assignments so that they can monitor their children's progress and understand classroom expectations. Student blogging in the K-12 classroom Student blogging describes students in Kindergarten to Grade 12 who are using blogs in some way in a formal classroom context. Blogs are digital platforms that provide students with a medium for sharing knowledge and experiences that go beyond the traditional means of reading and writing in classrooms. Student blogging is a relative newcomer to the digital writing scene, and appears to have gained ground only in the past 7‚Äì8 years. In the past 5 years, however, student blogging has become a relatively common phenomenon in classrooms around the world. This may be attributable to the increase in free blog hosting services that have adjustable privacy settings, and the opening up of school internet filters to a greater range of social media. The use of blogs in education gives students a global perspective. Teachers and students from different states, countries, and continents are able to collaborate on different projects and ideas. A classroom in China can collaborate with classrooms in Germany, Mexico, Australia, etc. with just a few clicks of a button. Learning through blogs allows students to take control of their own learning and steer it to their own needs. Students are able to see that opinions and even strategies vary based on location and culture. Children are all different, but a common thread of learning can unite them. The use of blogs in the classroom engages children in learning and using technological literacy that will help them in adulthood. There has not been a significant amount of research conducted on K-12 students regarding the efficacy of edublogs in enhancing learning. However, anecdotal results discussed by educators have given a glimpse into their utility or promise. There is a general consensus that edublogs create many opportunities for collaborative learning, as well as enhance the ability to locate and reflect upon work.Richardson, W. (2006). Blogs, Wikis, Podcasts and the Powerful Web Tools for Classrooms. Thousand Oaks: Corwin Press. Common pedagogical uses According to extant literature, students use blogging in classrooms for different purposes. Blogs are used to showcase individual student work by enabling them to publish texts, video clips, audio clips, maps, photos and other images, projects and suchlike in a potentially publicly accessible forum. Proponents of student blogging argue that blogging can contribute directly to improved writing abilities and argue that classroom blogging can enable students to engage with audiences beyond their classroom walls by using blogs as personal journals, as diaries, for story writing, and for making editorial responses to news events. Researchers have also documented teachers using student blogging to promote creativity and self-expression. Reasons for use Some researchers claim that student blogs promote learning by providing opportunities for students to take more control of their learning and the content they engage. It is also claimed that student blogging intrinsically motivates students to become better readers and writers. Potential limitations/some criticisms There is very little research on student blogging available. That being said, there is a large amount of published anecdotal evidence regarding criticisms of student blogging or limitations in using blogging in classrooms. For example, commentators claim that student blogs often include uncorrected inaccuracies of information, or can be used to instigate online bullying. Commentators also complain that student blogs are difficult to archive or index.  Professional development blogs for teachers  Although there are many blogs that teachers can use in the classroom with their students, there is also a multitude of blogs that teachers can use for their own professional development. Such blogs include hints on ways to be a better teacher in a certain subject area such as music, mathematics, or ESL, blogs on educational theory, blogs on advice for new teachers, blogs on where to find free technology, and blogs on transforming education, for example. There is much that can be learned from blogs of other teaching professionals and the learning can be done anytime and anywhere.Ferriter, B. (2009). Learning with blogs and wikis.

Background  During the early 1980s, Japan invited the United Kingdom to become a part of the Fifth Generation Project. In response, a committee was created and was chaired by John Alvey, a technology director at British Telecom. The report generated proposed a different course of action to the Japanese initiative and became the basis for the UK's rejection of the Fifth Generation and the creation of its own Alvey Programme.

The park is adjacent to Drake Well Museum, the site of the first successful commercial oil well in the United States, that was drilled under the direction of Colonel Edwin Drake. Oil Creek State Park follows Oil Creek, between Titusville and Oil City, and is on Pennsylvania Route 8. While the creek is the park's main recreational attraction, it also contains the sites of the first oil boomtown and much of Pennsylvania's original oil industry. The park contains a museum, tableaux, and trails to help visitors understand the history of the oil industry there, and an excursion train. Oil Creek State Park was chosen by the Pennsylvania Department of Conservation and Natural Resources (DCNR) and its Bureau of Parks as one of \\"25 Must-See Pennsylvania State Parks\\". History The history of Oil Creek State Park is tied to the rise and fall of the oil industry in northwestern Pennsylvania. What is now a wild second growth forest with several cold water fishery creeks flowing through it, was once the site of the vast oil industry that changed the landscape and water quality of the Oil Creek Valley. Titusville, to the north of Oil Creek State Park, was a slow-growing community, lying along the banks of Oil Creek until the 1850s. Lumber was the principal industry with at least 17 sawmills in the area. Oil was known to exist here, but there was no practical way to extract it. Its main use to that time had been as a medicine for both animals and humans. In the late 1850s Seneca Oil Company (formerly the Pennsylvania Rock Oil Company) sent its manager, Colonel Edwin L. Drake, to start drilling on a piece of leased land just south of Titusville, near what is now Oil Creek State Park. Drake hired a salt well driller, William A. Smith, in the summer of 1859. After many difficulties, they finally drilled a commercially successful well on August 27. It was an event that changed the world, beginning with the surrounding vicinity. Barges like this were filled with oil barrels and floated down Oil Creek. Teamsters were needed immediately to transport the oil to markets. Barges were filled with oil and sent down Oil Creek to Oil City on the Allegheny River. There the oil was transferred to steamships and sent on to Pittsburgh. Transportation methods improved, and in 1862 the Oil Creek and Titusville Railroad was built between Titusville and Corry, where freight was transferred to other, larger, east-west rail lines. In 1865, pipelines were laid directly next to the rail line and the demand for teamsters practically ended. The next year the railroad line was extended south to Petroleum Centre and Oil City. The Union City & Titusville Railroad was built in 1865, which became part of the Philadelphia and Erie Railroad in 1871. That fall President Ulysses S. Grant visited Titusville to view the booming oil industry. An interpretative trail guides visitors past the remnants of the former oil boomtown of Petroleum Center. Other oil-related businesses quickly were built in the area. Eight refineries were built between 1862 and 1868. Drilling tools were needed and several iron works were built. Titusville grew from 250 residents to 10,000 almost overnight and in 1866 it incorporated as a city. The first oil millionaire, a resident of Titusville, was Jonathan Watson who owned the land where Drake's well was drilled. The same land is now part of Oil Creek State Park and the Drake Well Museum. Fire was always a concern around oil and one of the worst fires was on June 11, 1880. What came to be known as \\"Black Friday\\" happened when almost of oil burned after an oil tank was hit by lightning. The fire raged for three days until it finally was brought under control. Although the oil was valued at $2 million, there was no loss of life. Another fire occurred on June 5, 1892, when Oil Creek flooded and a tank of benzine overturned. The benzine ignited and in the ensuing explosions 60 men, women, and children died. Another lightning strike in 1894 resulted in lost in a fire. Oil production peaked the late 1880s and has declined greatly since, although a few operating wells are still located in the park. With oil declining in importance, the Oil Creek area settled into an era of slower growth, with lumber eventually returning as its major industry until the hills and valleys were clear cut. Oil Creek State Park was part of a vast effort to reclaim the forests of Pennsylvania. The young men of the Civilian Conservation Corps established by President Franklin D. Roosevelt during the Great Depression worked to clear the forest and streams of dried brush, and replant the forests. They also built state roads, bridges and state park facilities. Through the efforts of the CCC and the later years of water and forest management, Oil Creek State Park is once again a wild area with a thriving wildlife population, diverse second growth forest, and crystal clean streams. The state does not own most of the mineral rights under the park as they were sold separately in the 19th century. In May 2009 it appealed a plan to drill three natural gas wells in the park, each deep. The Pennsylvania Supreme Court ruled in favor of the drilling company, saying that the DCNR could not impose drilling restrictions without compensation, despite its duty to preserve public parks. Geology Most of the oil produced in northwestern Pennsylvania was formed in sandstone reservoir rocks at the boundary between the Mississippian and Devonian rock layers.Caplinger 1997, p. 6. Over time, the oil migrated toward the surface, became trapped beneath an impervious layer of caprock, and formed a reservoir. The presence of upwards-curving folds in the caprock called anticlines, or sometimes an inversion of an anticline called a syncline, greatly varied the depth of the reservoirs, from around to just beneath the surface.Caplinger 1997, p. 4. The majority of the oil wells in the vicinity of the Oil Creek valley tapped into a sandstone formation known as the Venango Third sand.Pees 1998, p. 15. The Venango Third contained large volumes of oil under high pressure at only below ground level. Other oil-producing formations in the area were \\"the Venango First and Second [sands], the latter often prevailing after the Third sand was lost.\\" Recreation Oil Creek in the park The park offers picnicking, canoeing, fishing, backpacking, cross-country skiing, and bicycling (the last along a paved rail-trail). The Oil Creek and Titusville Railroad, a diesel tourist excursion train, runs through the park from Oil City to Titusville, with stops throughout the park. Oil Creek is popular with canoeists and anglers. The creek is rated as a beginners creek for those interested in learning how to safely use canoes and kayaks. Oil Creek is a cold water fishery with bass and trout living in its waters. All anglers are expected to follow the rules and regulations of the Pennsylvania Fish and Boat Commission. There are about open to hunting at Oil Creek State Park. Hunters are expected to follow the rules and regulations of the Pennsylvania Game Commission. The most common game species are eastern cottontail rabbits, ruffed grouse, eastern gray squirrels, wild turkey and white-tailed deer. The hunting of groundhogs is prohibited.

Mason Science College, now the University of Birmingham He was the second son and youngest child of Edward Frankland, chemist, and Sophia (Sophie), n√©e Frick. He was born at 42 Park Road, Haverstock Hill, Hampstead, on 3 October 1858. Michael Faraday was his godfather. Frankland attended University College School from 1869-1874. The following year he was admitted to the Royal School of Mines, where he was taught by his father, Frederick Guthrie, T H Huxley, Judd and Warington Smyth Although he gained a Brackenbury scholarship to St Bartholomew's Hospital in 1878, and graduated BSc three years later, he was steered away from medicine to chemistry by his father. He studied for a PhD under Wislicenus at the University of W√ºrzburg. Frankland returned to London in 1880, and became a demonstrator of practical chemistry at the Normal School of Science, South Kensington.For an explanation of the name of the constituents The Royal Schools of Chemistry and Mines see footnote 11 in Frankland left London in 1888 to become Professor of Chemistry at Dundee, where his main scientific interests were in stereochemistry and in the preparation of pure cultures of bacilli, which were allowed to grow in solutions of sugars. He then went to Birmingham in 1894 as Professor of what was then Mason College, where he succeeded Professor William A. Tilden. Frankland retired at the end of the First World War, aged 60. A list of his publications, from 1880-1920 is included in the Royal Society memoir. Frankland was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society in June 1891. He was President of the Chemical Society from 1911 to 1913, a position his father had held before him. He was awarded the Royal Society's Davy Medal in 1919. Family In 1882 Frankland married Grace (n√©e Toynbee), the daughter of Joseph Toynbee. She worked with both Percy and his father and was described at the time as having \\"worthily aided and seconded [Percy]\\".Quoted in The couple co-authored papers on bacteria and other microorganisms found in the air and water. They lived at Grove House, Pembridge Square, London. Their only child, Edward Percy, was born in 1884. He married Maud Metcalfe-Gibson in 1915. The couple had two sons and a daughter: the parasitologist Helga Maud Toynbee Frankland, who wrote about her grandfather Percy and other family members.

The abhorrence may be expressed in the form of stereotypes or caricatures. Racial antisemitism may present Jews, as a group, as being a threat in some way to the values or safety of society. Racial antisemitism could be seen as worse than religious antisemitism because for religious antisemites conversion was an option and once converted the 'Jew' was gone. With racial antisemitism a Jew could not get rid of their Jewishness. The premise of racial antisemitism is that Jews are a distinct racial or ethnic group, compared to religious antisemitism, which is prejudice against Jews and Judaism on the basis of their religion.\\"Anti-Semitism\\", Jewish Encyclopedia. According to William Nichols, religious antisemitism may be distinguished from modern antisemitism based on racial or ethnic grounds. \\"The dividing line was the possibility of effective conversion ... a Jew ceased to be a Jew upon baptism.\\" However, with racial antisemitism, \\"Now the assimilated Jew was still a Jew, even after baptism ... . From the Enlightenment onward, it is no longer possible to draw clear lines of distinction between religious and racial forms of hostility towards Jews... Once Jews have been emancipated and secular thinking makes its appearance, without leaving behind the old Christian hostility towards Jews, the new term antisemitism becomes almost unavoidable, even before explicitly racist doctrines appear.\\"Nichols, William: Christian Antisemitism, A History of Hate (1993) p. 314. In the context of the Industrial Revolution, following the emancipation of the Jews and the Haskalah (the Jewish Enlightenment), many Jews rapidly urbanized and experienced a period of greater social mobility. With the decreasing role of religion in public life and the simultaneous tempering of religious antisemitism, a combination of growing nationalism, the rise of eugenics, resentment of the socio-economic success of the Jews, and the influx of Ashkenazi Jews from Eastern Europe to Central Europe, soon led to the newer, and often more virulent, racist antisemitism. Scientific racism, the ideology that genetics played a role in group behavior and characteristics, was highly respected and accepted as fact between 1870 and 1940. It was not only antisemites who believed in race science but highly educated Jews, among others, as well. This acceptance of race science made it possible for antisemites to clothe their hatred of Jews in scientific theory. The logic of racial antisemitism was extended in Nazi Germany, where racial antisemitic ideas were turned into laws, which looked at the \\"blood\\" or ethnicity of people, rather than their current religious affiliations, and their subsequent fate would be determined purely on that basis. When added to its views on the Jewish racial traits which Nazi pseudoscience devised, the logic of racial antisemitism led to the Holocaust as a way to eradicate conjured up \\"Jewish traits\\" from the world. Limpieza de sangre Racial antisemitism has existed alongside religious antisemitism since at least the Middle Ages, and maybe longer. In Spain even before the Edict of Expulsion of 1492, Spanish Jews who converted to Catholicism (conversos in Spanish), and their descendants, were called New Christians. They were frequently accused of lapsing back to their former religious practices (being \\"Crypto-Jews\\"). To isolate conversos, the Spanish nobility developed an ideology called \\"cleanliness of blood\\". The conversos were called \\"New Christians\\" in order to indicate their inferior status within society. That ideology was a form of racism, because in the past, there were no grades of Christianity and converts to Christianity had equal standing with life-long Christians. Cleanliness of blood was an issue of ancestry, not an issue of personal religion. The first statute of purity of blood appeared in Toledo in 1449,Estatutos de Limpieza de Sangre, Pablo A. Chami. where an anti-converso riot lead to conversos being banned from most official positions. Initially these statutes were condemned by both the monarchy and the Church. However, the New Christians were later hounded and persecuted by the Spanish Inquisition after 1478, the Portuguese Inquisition after 1536, the Peruvian Inquisition after 1570 and the Mexican Inquisition after 1571, as well as the Inquisition in Colombia after 1610. Concept of a \\"Semitic race\\" A stylised T and O map, depicting Asia as the home of the descendants of Shem (Sem). Africa is ascribed to Ham and Europe to Japheth In Medieval Europe, all Asian peoples were thought of as being the descendants of Shem. By the 19th century, the term Semitic was confined to the ethnic groups which have historically spoken Semitic languages or had origins in the Fertile Crescent, as the Jews in Europe did. These peoples were often considered to be a distinct race. However, some antisemitic racial theorists of the time argued that the Semitic peoples arose from the blurring of distinctions between previously separate races. This supposed process was referred to as semiticization by the race-theorist Arthur de Gobineau. Gobineau himself did not consider the Semites (descendants of Shem) to be a lesser race. He broke people up into three races: white, black, and yellow. The Semites, like the Aryans (and Hamites) came from Asia and were white. Over time each of the groups had mixed with black blood. The Aryans had stayed pure longer and it was not until more recent times that they had mixed. It was this mixing of races that would lead to man's downfall. This idea of racial \\"confusion\\" was taken up by the Nazi ideologue Alfred Rosenberg. It was used by the Nazis to perpetuate the idea that the Jews were going to destroy Germany. The term semiticization was first used by Gobineau to label the blurring of racial distinctions that, in his view, had occurred in the Middle East. Gobineau had an essentialist model of race based on the three distinct racial groups, though he had no clear account of how this division arose. When these races mixed this caused \\"degeneration\\". Since the point at which these three supposed races met was in the Middle East, Gobineau argued that the process of mixing and diluting races occurred there, and that Semitic peoples embodied this \\"confused\\" racial identity. This concept suited the interests of antisemites, since it provided a theoretical model to rationalise racialised antisemitism. Variations of this theory were espoused in the writings of many antisemites in the late 19th century. The Nazi ideologue Alfred Rosenberg developed a variant of this theory in his writings, arguing that Jewish people were not a \\"real\\" race. According to Rosenberg, their evolution resulted from the mixing of pre-existing races rather than natural selection. The theory of semiticization was typically associated with other longstanding racist fears about the dilution of racial differences through miscegenation, which were manifested in negative images of mulattos and other mixed groups.  Rise  Modern European antisemitism has its origins in 19th century theories‚Äînow mostly considered as pseudo-scientific, but then accepted as credible‚Äîthat said that the Semitic peoples, including the Jews, are entirely different from the Aryan, or Indo-European, populations, and that they would not be able to assimilate. In this view, Jews are not opposed on account of their religion, but on account of their supposed hereditary or genetic racial characteristics: greed, a special aptitude for money-making, aversion to hard work, clannishness and obtrusiveness, lack of social tact, low cunning, and especially lack of patriotism. Later, Nazi propaganda also dwelt on supposed physical differences, such as the shape of the \\"Jewish nose\\". Racial antisemitic legislation A chart use to explain the Nuremberg Laws of 1935, which used a pseudo-scientific racial basis for discrimination against Jews In Nazi Germany, the Nuremberg Race Laws of 1935 prohibited sexual relations and marriage between any Aryan and Jew (such relations under Nazi ideology was a crime punishable under the race laws as Rassenschande or \\"racial pollution\\"), and made it that all Jews, even quarter- and half-Jews, were no longer citizens of their own country (their official title became \\"subject of the state\\"). This meant that they had no basic citizens' rights, e.g., to vote. In 1936, Jews were banned from all professional jobs, effectively preventing them having any influence in politics, higher education and industry. On 15 November 1938, Jewish children were banned from going to normal schools. By April 1939, nearly all Jewish companies had either collapsed under financial pressure and declining profits, or had been persuaded to sell out to the Nazi government. This further reduced their rights as human beings; they were in many ways officially separated from the German populace. Similar laws existed in Bulgaria (The Law for protection of the nation), Hungary, Romania, and Austria.

Premise Lou Antonio played Sgt. Jack Ramsey, an undercover detective with the Los Angeles Police Department, who found himself teamed with a very green partner named J.Z. Kane (Kim Basinger). Together they formed a relationship based on friendship and trust (completely platonic) that led to them capturing many of L.A.'s criminals. Lieutenant Arthur Kipling (Matt Clark) was their boss. \\"Dog and Cat\\" is a slang term used by police officers to denote a male-female partnership. The show is especially remembered for the car that Kim Basinger used in the series: a souped-up Volkswagen Beetle with a Porsche engine.

(1996) Formalizing the Informal? The Transformation of Cairo‚Äôs Refuse Collection System. Journal of Planning Education & Research, vol. 16, p. 118. The contemporary use of the word in Egyptian Arabic is to mean \\"garbage collectors\\". In cultural contexts, the word refers to teenagers and adults who have served as Cairo's informal garbage collectors since approximately the 1940s. The Zabbaleen (singular: ', ) are also known as Zarraba (singular: Zarrab), which means \\"pig-pen operators.\\" The word ' came from the Egyptian Arabic word ' (, ) which means \\"garbage\\". Spread out among seven different settlements scattered in the Greater Cairo Urban Region, the Zabbaleen population is between 50,000 and 70,000.Fahmi, Wael & Sutton, Keith. (2006) Cairo‚Äôs Zabbaleen Garbage Recyclers: Multi-nationals‚Äô Takeover and State Relocation Plans.Habitat International, vol. 30, p. 812. The largest settlement is Mokattam village, nicknamed \\"Garbage City,\\" located at the foot of the Mokattam Mountains, next to Manshiyat Naser.Assad, R., (1998), Upgrading the Mokattam Zabbaleen (Garbage Collectors) Settlement in Cairo: What Have We Learned?, Paper Presented at the Macarthur Consortium on International Peace and Cooperation Symposium on The Challenge of Urban Sustainability. The Zabbaleen community in Mokattam Village has a population of around 20,000 to 30,000, over 90 percent of which are Coptic Christians. For several generations, the Zabbaleen supported themselves by collecting trash door-to-door from the residents of Cairo for nearly no charge. Notably, the Zabbaleen recycle up to 80 percent of the waste that they collect, whereas most Western garbage collecting companies can only recycle 20 to 25 percent of the waste that they collect.Fahmi, Wael & Sutton, Keith. (2006) Cairo‚Äôs Zabbaleen Garbage Recyclers: Multinationals‚Äô Takeover and State Relocation Plans. Habitat International, vol. 30, p. 820.Fahmi, Wael Salah.(2005) The Impact of Privatization of Solid Waste Management on the Zabbaleen Garbage Collectors of Cairo.Environment & Urbanization, vol. 17, no.2, p. 158. The Zabbaleen use donkey-pulled carts and pick-up trucks to transport the garbage that they collect from the residents of Cairo, transport the garbage to their homes in Mokattam Village, sort the garbage there, and then sell the sorted garbage to middlemen or create new materials from their recycled garbage. The living situation for the Zabbaleen is poor, especially since they live amongst the trash that they sort in their village and with the pigs to which they feed their organic waste. Nevertheless, the Zabbaleen have formed a strong and tight-knit community. However, their existence and way of life has come under threat after the Cairo municipal authorities‚Äô decision in 2003 to award annual contracts of $50 million to three multinational garbage disposal companies.Fahmi, Wael & Sutton, Keith. (2006) Cairo‚Äôs Zabbaleen Garbage Recyclers: Multinationals‚Äô Takeover and State Relocation Plans. Habitat International, vol, 30, p. 821. The government authorities do not compensate the Zabbaleen for these changes, and as a result, the takeover of waste collection threatens the socio-economic sustainability of the Zabbaleen community. More recently, the Zabbaleen have faced another challenge when the Egyptian Agricultural Ministry ordered the culling of all pigs in April 2009, in response to national fears over the possible spread of H1N1 influenza.Fahmi, Wael & Sutton, Keith. (2010) Cairo‚Äôs Contested Garbage: Sustainable Solid Waste Management and the Zabbaleen‚Äôs Right to the City.Sustainability, vol. 2, p. 1773. This governmental decision poses a major setback to the Zabbaleen because pigs are an essential component to their recycling and sorting system, in which the pigs eat all of the organic waste. Immediately after the culling of pigs, observers have noticed a visible increase of trash piles and piles of rotting food on the streets of Cairo. There are also worries that the Egyptian government is seeking to remove the Mokattam village entirely and relocate the Zabbaleen further outside of Cairo by a further 25 km, to a 50-feddan plot (1 feddan = ) in Cairo's eastern desert settlement of Katameya.Fahmi, Wael & Sutton, Keith.

(2010) Cairo's Contested Garbage: Sustainable Solid Waste Management and the Zabbaleen‚Äôs Right to the City. Sustainability, vol. 2, pp. 1771 and 1774. Historical background First wave of migration Around the 1910s, a group of Muslim migrants from the Dakhla oasis in the Western desert of Egypt relocated to Cairo in an area known as Bab El Bahr, which is situated between Attaba and Ramses square in downtown Cairo.Fahmi, Wael Salah.(2005) The Impact of Privatization of Solid Waste Management on the Zabbaleen Garbage Collectors of Cairo. Environment & Urbanization, vol. 17, no. 2, p. 156.Fahmi, Wael & Sutton, Keith. (2010) Cairo‚Äôs Contested Garbage: Sustainable Solid Waste Management and the Zabbaleen‚Äôs Right to the City.

Habitat International, vol. 30, p. 811. These people are known as the Wahiya (singular: wahi), which means people of the oasis. The Wahiya assumed the sole responsibility for the collection and disposal of Cairo's household waste under the framework of contracts with building owners in Cairo. In this system, the Wahiya paid the owners of buildings an initial sum and then collected monthly fees from the tenants for their services.Fahmi, Wael & Sutton, Keith. (2006) Cairo‚Äôs Zabbaleen Garbage Recyclers: Multinationals‚Äô Takeover and State Relocation Plans. Habitat International, vol. 30, p. 812. Second wave of migration In the 1930s and 40s, there was a second wave of migration. This new group, mostly landless peasants, is known as the Zabbaleen. The descendants of subsistence farmers, the Zabbaleen originate from the El Badari district in Asyut, a rural region in Upper Egypt, which is the southern part of Egypt. As farming ceased to be a viable way of life, the Zabbaleen faced economic hardships which prompted them to migrate to Cairo in search of work. Henceforth, the Wahiya collaborated with the Zabbaleen, who purchased waste from the Wahiya for use as fodder for pig farming. Initially, the Zabbaleen settled in the Imbaba district of the Giza governorate, but were given a four-day eviction notice from the governor of Giza in 1970. Thereafter, the Zabbaleen settled mainly in an abandoned quarry at the foot of the Mokattam hills, east of Cairo, which is under the jurisdiction of the Cairo Governorate.Aziz, H., (2004), 'Improving the livelihood of child waste pickers: experiences with the ‚ÄòZabbaleen‚Äô in Cairo, Egypt', Waste, p. 9. Although the governor of Cairo granted the Zabbaleen administrative permission to settle in the area, he did not issue a lease or legal tenure. Thus, because of their precarious situation, the Zabbaleen initially lived in makeshift settlements of tin huts, made mostly of barrels that the Zabbaleen found amongst the waste that they collected. This Zabbaleen community later emerged as the informal garbage collectors and recyclers of Cairo. The literal meaning of the word Zabbaleen is garbage-men (singular: Zabbal). The Zabbaleen are also known as Zarraba (singular: Zarrab), which means pig pen operators, because they raise pigs that eat the organic components of the waste that they collect. 1989 agreement between Wahiya and Zabbaleen Prior to the migration of the Zabbaleen, the Wahiya had used the refuse, after drying it, as a source of energy, specifically as fuel for public baths and bean cookeries. However, this use of dried refuse became obsolete in the 1930s when fuel oil became the preferred fuel for public baths and bean cookeries. This coincided with the migration of the Zabbaleen, who used the organic components of the wastes to feed their pigs. Thus, the Wahiya began to sell the organic refuse to the Zabbaleen. Because the Zabbaleen needed to obtain waste food before it rots, they preferred to collect the refuse themselves using their own donkey carts. Therefore, the Zabbaleen can be distinguished from the Wahiya in at least two significant ways. First, the Wahiya retained control over the access and collection rights to the monthly fees paid by the residents, whereas the Zabbaleen usually do not have a share in the monthly fees paid by residents. In fact, the Zabbaleen are often obliged to pay the Wahiya in order to gain access to the waste garbage. However, what the Zabbaleen do acquire are the rights to the refuse itself.Assaad, Ragui. (1996) Formalizing the Informal? The Transformation of Cairo‚Äôs Refuse Collection System. Journal of Planning Education & Research, vol. 16, p. 119. Hence, the relationship between the Wahiya and the Zabbaleen was hierarchically constituted. The Wahiya acted as the middlemen between the Zabbaleen and Cairo's households. Quoting Assaad, \\"The wahiya assume overall responsibility for regular removal of the wastes vis-√†-vis residents and building owners and are responsible for collection of the wastes from individual dwelling units to the street level. The Zabbaleen, on the other hand, are responsible for the haulage and disposal of the wastes.\\" A Donkey at Mokattam Hill in Cairo Second, the Zabbaleen are the group that actually collects the garbage on donkey-pulled carts, separate out recyclables, breed pigs, an important component of their recycling system, and engage in a highly efficient process of recycling, whereas the Wahiya do not. The Zabbaleen also sell the sorted secondary materials such as paper, tin, glass, plastic materials, rags, and aluminum cans to intermediaries.Fahmi, Wael Salah.(2005) The Impact of Privatization of Solid Waste Management on the Zabbaleen Garbage Collectors of Cairo.Environment & Urbanization, vol. 17, no.2, p. 157. Because Cairenes are generally not aware of the distinction between the wahiya and the Zabbaleen (also called zarraba), they continue to refer to both groups as Zabbaleen. It should be noted, however, that these two groups are distinct, serving different functions in the informal economy of collecting Cairo's municipal solid waste (MSW).Assaad, Ragui. (1996) Formalizing the Informal? The Transformation of Cairo‚Äôs Refuse Collection System.Journal of Planning Education & Research, vol. 16, p. 118. In response to government pressures to upgrade and modernize the refuse collection system, the Wahiya and the Zabbaleen made an agreement which resulted in the establishment of the Environmental Protection Company, as a private-for-profit company in 1989. Within the framework of the EPC, the wahiya contracted groups of Zabbaleen to collect and dispose of MSW. The Wahiya continued to collect the user fees from tenants, but also resumed the responsibility to cover hauling costs out of the fees they collected for the first time.Assaad, Ragui. (1996) Formalizing the Informal? The Transformation of Cairo‚Äôs Refuse Collection System. Journal of Planning Education & Research, vol. 16, p. 121. The formation of the EPC was significant in that it established the Wahiya and the Zabbaleen as key participants in the collection of MSW, even though responsibility for MSW had been shared between the municipal sanitation service and the Zabbaleen since many prior decades. The municipal authorities grew increasingly intolerant of the Zabbaleen's donkey carts, which, according to Assaad, were considered an eyesore and a traffic hazard by the government.Assaad, Ragui. (1996) Formalizing the Informal? The Transformation of Cairo‚Äôs Refuse Collection System.Journal of Planning Education & Research, vol. 16, p. 121. This was precisely in the neighborhoods that were being more fully served given Cairo's narrow, winding streets that are not wide-enough for large garbage trucks. Regardless, in the early 1990s, according to Fahmi & Sutton, the garbage collectors had to comply with the municipality's requirements to use motorized trucks, rather than donkey carts, as the authorities introduced a system of mechanization to transport solid waste. Because the Zabbaleen were required to accommodate to these new requirements for a mechanized system without any government support, including technical, financial, or educational support, they resorted to the selling of small plots of land back in their ancestral villages, use of personal savings, or credit loans to acquire the necessary capital to purchase the trucks. According to Fahmi, within the EPC, the Wahiya conducted administration, marketed the company's services, collected the fees from tenants, and supervised service deliveries. On the other end, the Zabbaleen, \\"many of whom might otherwise have been homeless and without employment, collected and transported the waste.\\" In more recent years, as the Zabbaleen became more involved in the work, some received a minimal fee from the Wahiya. Zabbaleen settlements Main settlements There are seven main settlements, in which the Zabbaleen reside in the Greater Cairo Urban Region: Ein El Sira, Moatamdia, El Bargil, Tora, Ezbet el Nakhl, Helwan, and Mokattam. Due to urban expansion, most of these 7 settlements have been moved by municipal authorities to more peripheral locations. The number of Zabbaleen living in these areas total to about 60,000-70,000. Of these settlements, Mokattam, also often known as Garbage City, east of Cairo, is the largest settlement, situated at the foot of Mokattam mountain, with approximately 20,000 inhabitants. The Zabbaleen Settlement of Mokattam was created as a result of a series of evictions from the Imbaba area located in the Giza governorate, notably when the Zabbaleen were given a four-day eviction notice from the governor of Giza in 1970.Greiss, S & et al. Recycling the Rejects of the Rejects; Protection of the Environment and Poverty Alleviation by Job Creation to Youth Proceedings of the international Conference on Sustainable Solid Waste Management, p. 410. Although Mokattam village is relatively close to the center of Cairo, it is very inaccessible because it is situated on a plateau surrounded by the cliffs of the Mokattam hills on one side and by the Manshiet Nasser squatter settlement on the other side. Vehicular access to the Zabbaleen Mokattam is possible only through three entrances, two of which are accessible only by crossing through the crowded, narrow, and steep streets of Manshiet Nasser. Because of the high congestion and road traffic, conflicts between the residents of the Manshiet Nasser settlement and the Zabbaleen, who need to haul their donkey carts loaded with garbage through the streets of Manshiet Nasser have often broken out. Occasionally, these conflicts took on religious overtones, as the inhabitants of the Manshiet Nasser settlement are mostly Muslims, whereas the inhabitants of the Mokattam settlement are mostly Coptic Christians. Mokattam village is situated at the foot of the Mokattam mountains, which has proven to be a precarious geographic location. In 1993, there was a rockslide from Mokattam Mountain, which fell near the bordering area of the Zabbaleen settlement, resulting in the deaths of 40 people.Fahmi, Wael & Sutton, Keith. (2006) Cairo‚Äôs Zabbaleen Garbage Recyclers: Multinationals‚Äô Takeover and State Relocation Plans.Habitat International, vol. 30, p. 815. More recently, in 2008, another rock slide from the Mokattam hills killed more than 100 people in El-Duweiqa, another shantytown in the Mokattam district. These rock slides have brought attention to the precarious location of shantytowns located below the Mokattam mountains as well as to the Zabbaleen.Fahmi, Wael & Sutton, Keith. (2010) Cairo‚Äôs Contested Garbage: Sustainable Solid Waste Management and the Zabbaleen‚Äôs Right to the City.Sustainability, vol. 2, p. 1766. Some attribute these frequent rock slides to various development and construction activities on Mokattam Mountain's upper plateau on which the upper middle class residential district of Mokattam City is located.Fahmi, Wael & Sutton, Keith. (2010) Cairo‚Äôs Contested Garbage: Sustainable Solid Waste Management and the Zabbaleen‚Äôs Right to the City. Sustainability, vol. 2, p. 1766. Living conditions The living conditions in Mokattam Village, and the other Zabbaleen settlements, are poor. According to Assad, in the 1970s, \\"the streets were so stacked with heaps of assorted refuse that some of them could not be located. The air was heavily polluted by the smoke generated from fires that were either lit deliberately to dispose of unwanted waste, or resulted from the spontaneous combustion of organic residues.\\" There have been frequent fires in Mokattam, two of which were particularly severe and devastated the settlement in the 1970s. In its early years, the Mokattam Settlement lacked basic services; there were no health centers, pharmacies, or schools. Basic amenities such as piped water, sewage networks, and electricity were also missing. During the beginning decades of the Mokattam settlement, the community suffered from \\"high mortality and morbidity rates (especially among children), poor environmental conditions, and low income.\\" In 1983, the average household income per month was estimated at LE 70(approximately US$11.50 in January 2005) within the lowest 10th percentile of national urban income levels, with an average large household size of 8 persons. However, the living conditions of the Mokattam settlement improved after the Mokattam settlement received significant funding from the World Bank, in its upgrading program known as the Zabbaleen Environmental Development Program (ZEDP) in 1981 and from other international donors. Health The Zabbaleen community is characterized by both low health and high rates of disease, especially those related to their garbage collecting activities.Greiss, S & et al. Recycling the Rejects of the Rejects; Protection of the Environment and Poverty Alleviation by Job Creation to Youth Proceedings of the international Conference on Sustainable Solid Waste Management, p. 491. According to Assad, \\"reported infant mortality rates, particularly from tetanus, were extremely high. In 1981, infant mortality was estimated at about 240 deaths per thousand births (EQI Report #3, 1981: 36).\\" This infant mortality rate dropped to 117 per thousand in 1991, but the infant mortality rate in the Mokattam community is still substantially higher than the average infant mortality rate of Cairo for the 1990-95 period, which was 45.6 per thousand. Religion Saint Simon, Muquattam, Cairo St. Simon the Tanner's Hall Egypt is a Muslim-majority country. However, over 90 percent of the Zabbaleen community in the Mokattam village are Coptic Christians. Communities where almost everyone is Christian are rare to find in Egypt outside of the Zabbaleen community of Mokattam. According to Engi Wassef, in her commentary in her documentary film Marina of the Zabbaleen, many people in the Zabbaleen village say that even if they could live outside of the village or buy a house elsewhere, they would not because they are happy to live within their own religious community and freely practice their religion. Cave church The local Coptic Church in Mokattam Village was established in 1975.R., (1998), Upgrading the Mokattam Zabbaleen (Garbage Collectors) Settlement in Cairo: What Have We Learned?, Paper Presented at the Macarthur Consortium on International Peace and Cooperation Symposium on The Challenge of Urban Sustainability. After the establishment of the church, the Zabbaleen felt more secure in their location and only then began to use more permanent building materials, such as stone and bricks, for their homes. Given their previous experience of eviction from Giza in 1970, the Zabbaleen had lived in temporary tin huts up till that point. In 1976, a large fire broke out in Manshiyat Nasir, which led to the beginning of the construction of the first church below the Mokattam mountain on a site of 1,000 square meters.Cave Church Chronology, Retrieved: October 23, 2010. More churches have been built into the caves found in Mokattam. Currently, there are seven cave churches hidden among the caves of Mokattam Mountain. The Monastery of St. Simon the Tanner is the largest and it has an amphitheater with a seating capacity of 20,000., from official website of TourEgypt This church is the largest church in the Middle East. It is named after the Coptic Saint, Simon the Tanner, who lived at the end of the 10th century, when Egypt was ruled by the Muslim Fatimid Caliph Al-Muizz Lideenillah. Simon the Tanner is the Coptic Saint who is associated with the legend of the moving of the Mokattam Mountain. Adjacent churches to the Monastery of St. Simon the Tanner include the St. Bola's Church, St. Marks Church, and St. Simon the Tanner's Hall. The cave churches of Mokattam are also a point of interest for many tourists visiting Cairo. Zabbaleen recycling methods Many sources state that the Zabbaleen have created one of the most efficient recycling systems in the world, which recycles up to 80 percent of all the waste that they collect. In contrast, most Western garbage collecting companies can only recycle about 20 to 25 percent of the waste that they collect. According to Fahmi, 2005, \\"it was estimated that, in 1997, the Zabbaleen informally handled one-third of the garbage of Cairo‚Äôs 14 million people, mainly that from poorer districts,\\" meaning that the Zabbaleen collected up to 3,000 tons of garbage every day. The Zabbaleen are able to recycle up to 80 percent of the waste that they collect through their family-run micro-enterprises that generate jobs, including those for production of handmade crafts from rags and paper, and incomes from some 40,000 people. In fact, according to Fahmi, \\"in the mid-1990s, nearly 700 Zabbaleen families owned collection enterprises, 200 owned and operated small- and medium-scale recycling enterprises, and 120 owned trading enterprises, in addition to maintenance workshops and community- based service businesses.\\"Fahmi, Wael Salah.(2005) The Impact of Privatization of Solid Waste Management on the Zabbaleen Garbage Collectors of Cairo. Environment & Urbanization, vol. 17, no. 2, p. 158. What is distinctive about the Zabbaleen from many other urban informal waste collecting-groups that scavenge trash for useful products is that the Zabbaleen invest heavily in their tools and know-how for recycling. These Zabbaleen micro-entrepreneurs have invested \\"an estimated 2.1 million Egyptian pounds (LE) (US $ 1‚ÅÑ4 LE 6.19 -May 2004 rates) in trucks, plastic granulators, paper compactors, cloth grinders, aluminium smelters, and tin processors.\\"Fahmi, Wael & Sutton, Keith. (2006) Cairo‚Äôs Zabbaleen Garbage Recyclers: Multi-nationals‚Äô Takeover and State Relocation Plans. Habitat International, vol. 30, p. 813. By investing in such infrastructure, the Zabbaleen continually upgraded and enhanced their methods of recycling plastic, paper, cardboard, glass, metal, and fabrics. Thus, the city of Cairo and its administration had been able to manage its solid waste at almost no cost to the municipal administration because of such efforts by the Zabbaleen. Hence, the income that the Zabbaleen generate is mainly derived from their recycling and sorting activities, not from the minimal fees (LE 2-4) that they collect from residents. Trash collecting procedure There is a gender division of labor in the process of collecting and sorting the trash in the Zabbaleen system. Usually, it is the Zabbaleen men, sometimes accompanied by children, who go pick up the trash door-to-door from each household.Fahmi, Wael & Sutton, Keith. (2010) Cairo‚Äôs Contested Garbage: Sustainable Solid Waste Management and the Zabbaleen‚Äôs Right to the City. Sustainability, vol. 2, p. 1768. This trash is completely unsorted because there is not a system of recycling at the source in Egypt. It is rare for girls to go to collect the trash and it stops almost entirely after girls reach the age 10. The means of transportation that the Zabbaleen use to transport the trash that they collect are donkey-pulled carts and pickup trucks. After the Zabbaleen pick up the trash, they take the trash back to their village, a trip that may take anywhere from between 10 minutes to an hour. Sorting When the men return to the village with the collected trash, usually their families are waiting for them so that they can begin sorting the trash. The majority of those who sort the trash are women, while certain families specialize in sorting certain materials such as paper, plastic, aluminum, glass, etc. The women and children sort the garbage into 16 different types of trash and sort out the recyclables. The sorting of garbage is a time-consuming task in which women and children may spend up to 10 to 12 hours each day separating the garbage. First, the trash is sorted into the main 16 categories, such as paper, plastic, cardboard, cans, etc. So for example, all different types of paper are placed into one pile while all different types of plastic are placed in another pile. Sorting within categories does not take place until after the trash is sorted first into the major categories. Then sorting within the category takes place. For instance, the major category of paper would be sorted into white paper, yellow paper, thick paper, newspaper, thin paper, etc. Each sub-sorted material is then sold to factories and middle-men for a marginal profit. Use of pigs The initial and very integral step of sorting the trash is the responsibility of Zabbaleen community members who own pigs. The pigs are fed the organic waste. After the organic waste has been eaten by the pigs, the rest of the trash is sorted into different categories such, as PT plastic, paper, cans, etc. Thus, as Engi Wassef, the director of Marina of the Zabbaleen notes, \\"One of the reasons why Coptic Christians are given a kind of monopoly status on the garbage collection and sorting system is because the Muslim religion does not allow for breeding or eating or living near pigs. It's considered a dirty animal.\\" In addition to their use in sorting out organic waste, pigs are an important source of income. After the pigs have grown, the Zabbaleen sell the pig-meat to large tourist facilities. According to Fahmi and Sutton, \\"Hitherto, the Zabbaleen claimed to collect 6,000 tons of MSW a day, of which 60% was food waste and organic garbage which their pigs consume. Every 6 months, the waste collectors sell adult pigs, 5 to 15 pigs to a trader for LE 7 per kilogram (US$ 1.25 per kilogram). The trader then takes pigs to the slaughterhouses, where a kilogram is sold for LE 30‚Äì35 (US$ 5‚Äì6.25). The waste collectors can earn around LE 450 (US$ 80) per pig.\\"Fahmi, Wael & Sutton, Keith. (2010) Cairo‚Äôs Contested Garbage: Sustainable Solid Waste Management and the Zabaleen‚Äôs Right to the City. Sustainability, vol. 2, p. 1774. Creation of goods using recycled materials After the sorting of materials is finished, the Zabbaleen sell the sorted materials, such as paper, tin, rags, plastic materials, cloth, etc.Fahmi, Wael & Sutton, Keith. (2010) Cairo‚Äôs Contested Garbage: Sustainable Solid Waste Management and the Zabbaleen‚Äôs Right to the City.Sustainability, vol. 2, p. 1768. The Zabbaleen sell these sorted materials to factories that then reuse these products, such as paper, in the creation of new material. According to Engi Wassef, the director of the documentary film, Marina of the Zabbaleen, PT plastic, which is the plastic used to make plastic bottles for water and other beverages, is one of the most highly sought out materials. In the case of PT plastic, the Zabbaleen would even export this material to China. However, the simple re- sale of sorted materials is not the only activity that the Zabbaleen do in terms of re-using these materials. They also create new materials from the materials that they have sorted. For example, granulators are used to change regular opaque-colored plastic into small plastic pellets. From these plastic pellets, a variety of plastic product can then be made, including garbage bags and plastic hangers. Handmade crafts are also made from rags and paper. Thus, the Zabbaleen system is a multi-tier system that is not limited to the simple collection of waste but also encompasses the creation of new materials from found recyclables. International recognition The official website of the documentary Garbage Dreams states that, \\"Far ahead of any modern 'Green' initiatives, the Zabbaleen survive by recycling 80 percent of the garbage they collect.\\" By comparison, most Western garbage collecting companies can only recycle about 20 to 25 percent of the waste that they collect. After the takeover of the municipal waste collection, the three private companies, two from Spain and one from Italy, that were awarded with contracts to dispose of Cairo's trash were only required to recycled 20 percent of the trash that they collect.Fahmi, Wael & Sutton, Keith. (2010) Cairo‚Äôs Contested Garbage: Sustainable Solid Waste Management and the Zabaleen‚Äôs Right to the City. Sustainability, vol. 2, p. 1772. The rest of the trash that foreign companies do not recycle are placed into new landfills. The efficiency and environmental-friendliness of the Zabbaleen \\"waste collection and recycling system received major world recognition and approval at the Rio Earth Summit in 1992.\\"Fahmi, Wael & Sutton, Keith. (2006) Cairo‚Äôs Zabaleen Garbage Recyclers: Multi-nationals‚Äô Takeover and State Relocation Plans. Habitat International, vol. 30, p. 810. The Mega-Cities Project sought to encourage the Zabbaleen system of waste collection and recycling as a model to be encouraged in other developing world cities such as Manila and Mumbai. The Zabbaleen waste collection system has received international funding from the World Bank, the Ford Foundation and Oxfam for specific projects to upgrade and improve the recycling of solid waste. Contracting out municipal waste collection Selling of contracts to foreign companies In 2003, the government of Egypt sold annual contracts reaching US$50 million to international companies to collect Cairo's solid waste. The three companies that were awarded with contracts for cleaning Cairo are FCC and Urbaser, Enser (both Spanish companies), and AMA (an Italian) company. The Egyptian Company for Garbage Collection, a domestic company was also awarded with contracts.Fahmi, Wael & Sutton, Keith. (2010) Cairo‚Äôs Contested Garbage: Sustainable Solid Waste Management and the Zabbaleen‚Äôs Right to the City.Sustainability, vol. 2, p. 1770. There was a precedent for this approach to trash collection two years earlier, in 2001, when the government agreed to sign a contract with Onyx, a French company, to manage the waste of Alexandria, the second largest city in Egypt. Through this contract, the Egyptian government agreed to pay $446 million to Onyx for the treatment of one million tons of waste per year for 15 years, a sum that was ten times greater than what the government had previously paid before for its municipal waste management. Impact on Cairo Significantly, the foreign companies, despite the large value of their contracts, are only required to recycle 20 percent of the waste that they collect; the remaining 80 percent are placed into landfills.Fahmi, Wael & Sutton, Keith. (2010) Cairo‚Äôs Contested Garbage: Sustainable Solid Waste Management and the Zabbaleen‚Äôs Right to the City.Sustainability, vol. 2, p. 1772. In contrast, the Zabbaleen recycle up to 80 percent of all the MSW that they collect. The foreign companies collected the trash from garbage bins placed at central collection points on the streets. However, many inhabitants of Cairo preferred the door-to-door garbage pick-up done by the Zabbaleen, especially because the bins were not plentifully located or located in inconvenient places. Thus, residents expressed their discontent with the new system, especially because they were being charged more for what seemed to be a more inconvenient system. Under the new system, residents were required to pay a monthly bill for garbage collection that accompanies their electricity bill. The garbage collection fee was based upon the percentage of each electricity bill so that the garbage collection fee increases proportionately to electricity consumption. Two years after the new system was imposed, Rashed writes in the Al-Ahram Weekly, \\"residents of the governorate have been voicing increasingly vociferous complaints that the companies are working well below full capacity. The streets are not as clean as they were during the first days of the privatisation. Both company workers, and garbage receptacles, appear to be increasingly thin on the ground.\\" Impact on Zabbaleen The subcontracting of MSW collection to foreign companies had an immediate negative impact upon the Zabbaleen community as documented in Mai Iskander's film, Garbage Dreams. Contracting out MSW to foreign companies meant that the Zabbaleen would lose access to garbage, which was the basis of their recycling and sorting activities. In the documentary Garbage Dreams, Laila, a social worker in Mokattam Village, says, \\"The city contracted with foreign waste disposal companies because they perceived the Zabbaleen to be old-fashioned. But they didn't come tell us, \\"You need to modernize your ways.\\" This was all done behind our backs. \\"we're replacing you with the companies.\\" So we can be like the developed countries.\\" In contrast, because officials from the Cairo Cleaning and Beautification Authority (CCBA) regarded the Zabbaleen recycling methods as unhygienic and backwards, they were optimistic about the process and hoped for a positive impact on Cairo's environment. However, because the mechanized equipment of the foreign companies are too large for the streets of Cairo, citizens were required to bring their trash to designated collection centers and bins, which were not always placed in easily accessible locations. Therefore, residents preferred to continue to have their trash picked up from their doors by the Zabbaleen, who were able to come directly to their doors even if their homes were located in narrow alleys. Eventually, the foreign companies realized that they needed the Zabbaleen and thus, subcontracted them. This system failed, however, because the companies underpaid the Zabbaleen. According to Fahmi and Sutton, \\"while company sources mention salaries ranging between LE 300 to LE 450 per month (US $50‚Äì$75), some Zabbaleen claim that the salaries on offer are actually closer to LE 150 per month.\\" One Zabbal with eight children gave a similar figure: whereas he used to make LE 10 a day (US$1.60), foreign contractors offered him LE 5 a day. Pig cull Government order In April 2009, the first cases of the H1N1 influenza were found in Mexico. By the end of that month, it was estimated that up to 169 people died due to the epidemic. All of the deaths, except for one, occurred in Mexico. Egypt responded to this outbreak of H1N1 by ordering the culling of its swine population, an act which had a devastating impact on the livelihood of 70,000 Zabbaleen families.Fahmi, Wael & Sutton, Keith. (2010) Cairo‚Äôs Contested Garbage: Sustainable Solid Waste Management and the Zabaleen‚Äôs Right to the City. Sustainability, vol. 2, p. 1774. This decision was made not by the Health Ministry, but directly by the Parliament. International organizations, including the United Nations criticized the Egyptian government for its decision. Egypt was the only country in the world to take such a drastic decision as to cull an estimated 300,000 pigs. This decision was made despite the general agreement that H1N1 is not transmitted by pigs. Furthermore, there were no cases of swine flu found in Egypt during the time when the pig cull was executed. The actual slaughter of the pigs was ordered by the Egyptian Agricultural Ministry in April 2009. Although government authorities stated that the slaughtering itself was humane, and in accordance with Islamic law, witnesses testify a lot of cruelty and violence in the culling. According to Slackman, \\"Piglets were documented being stabbed and tossed into piles, large pigs beaten with metal rods, their carcasses dumped in the sand.\\" H1N1 influenza was officially declared as a pandemic by the World Health Organization in June 2009. The pandemic was then declared to be officially over by the World Health Organization on August 10, 2010. Explanations for the cull When first ordering the pig cull, the Egyptian government asserted that it was a precaution to forestall national fears of the imminent pandemic. Later, after the pig cull, the government stated that its decision to order the pig cull was directly affected by the global breakout of H5N1 virus, more commonly known as bird flu, several years earlier and a fear that the two strains of viruses could possibly combine to form a more lethal virus. Later, the Egyptian government openly stated that the pig cull was no longer just an act to prevent swine flu; rather, it was part of a plan to clean up the Zabbaleen and allow them to live in sanitary conditions. According to Sabir Abdel Aziz Galal, chief of the infectious disease department in the Ministry of agriculture, \\"We want them to live a better life. humanely treated; it's a very difficult life.\\" In contrast to the explanations officially given by the Egyptian government, many other observers, especially in the Western media, as well as the Zabbaleen themselves perceived a religious bias in the execution of the pig cull. In a New York Times article, Slackman asserted that, \\"The Zabbaleen are Christians. Egypt is a majority Muslim country. The Zabbaleen are convinced that the government wants to use the swine flu scare not to help improve their lives but to get pigs out of Egypt. Islam prohibits eating pork.\\" In another New York Times article, Audi writes, \\"Most of Egypt's pig farmers are Christians, and some accuse the government of using swine flu fears to punish them economically.\\" According to Rev. Samaan Ibrahim, a priest from a Zabbaleen neighborhood, \\"The bottom line is pigs are not welcome in Egypt.\\" In an article by the BBC, Fraser argues along a similar line, saying that the Coptic Christian minority were targeted by the government for a main source of their income, the rearing of pigs. A similar opinion is voiced by Engi Wassef in her documentary, Marina of the Zabbaleen. Fahmi and Sutton echo a similar explanation: \\"The adverse effect of the slaughtering of the pigs on the Zabbaleen's livelihoods might be part of the ongoing gentrification of garbage city for land speculations and the taking over of their recycling economy by entrepreneurial businesses.\\"Fahmi, Wael & Sutton, Keith. (2010) Cairo‚Äôs Contested Garbage: Sustainable Solid Waste Management and the Zabbaleen‚Äôs Right to the City. Sustainability, vol. 2, p. 1775. Effect on the Zabbaleen Increased trash on a street in Mokattam village after pig cull The pig cull negatively affected the Zabbaleen in several ways. First, because the pigs eat the organic waste, they are a vital component in their recycling system, the pig cull literally destroyed the Zabbaleen recycling system. Deprived of their pig herds, the Zabbaleen stopped collecting such organic trash, leaving food piles to rot in the streets, leading to the increase of trash in the streets. According to Engi Wassef, recycling and sorting activities in the Zabbaleen villages all but ceased after the pig cull, because without the pigs, the sorting and recycling activities of the Zabbaleen became economically unfeasible. Less trash was brought into the village, because there was no place to put the trash. Hence, the entire recycling system was broken, placing the Zabbaleen out of work. Another negative effect of the pig cull on the Zabbaleen was the loss of the economic value of the pigs themselves. According to Fahmi and Sutton, pigs are the main source of income for the Zabbaleen. Before the cull, the Zabbaleen had collected 6,000 tons of MSW daily, of which 60 percent was organic waste which was consumed by the pigs. Every six months, the Zabbaleen would take their pigs to traders, earning around 450LE (approximately US$80) per pig. Although the Egyptian government made financial compensations for some of pigs slaughtered; compensations were not given to all of the Zabbaleen who lost pigs to the cull and those who received compensation received far less money compared to what they would have received from selling the pigs to traders. According to one Zabbaleen pig breeder, \\"The government paid me between LE 50 (US$ 10) and LE 250 (US$ 50) for each pig I lost, depending on its size, whilst meat processors would have given me as much as LE 1,000 (US$ 200).\\" The pig cull also resulted in increased cases of malnutrition and anaemia in Zabbaleen children because prior to the cull, pork had been the only affordable source of animal protein for most of the Zabbaleen. Effect on Cairo Many observers noticed an immediate increase in piles of trash on the streets of Cairo after the pig cull. Because in the Zabbaleen system of recycling, it is the pigs who initially eat the organic waste, the pig cull had a negative effect on the cleanliness of Cairo's streets. According to Khalil in an article by Al Masry Al Youm, \\"The elimination of the pigs prompted more trash than usual to immediately start clogging the streets of the capital.\\" In a New York Times article from September 2009, Slackman states that the Egyptian government was warned before its actual execution that the pig cull, if executed, \\"the city would be overwhelmed with trash.\\" Slackman notes that after the pig cull, \\"rotting food piles up on the streets of middle-class neighborhoods like Heliopolis and in the poor streets of communities like Imbaba.\\" In an article by Bloomberg, Williams also observes a garbage crisis piling up on the streets of Cairo after the pig cull. This piling up of organic MSW became hazardous because the organic waste then became a source of infectious diseases and led to an increase of rat infestation.

Life Venetsianov's study by Fyodor Slavyansky Alexey Venetsianov was born into a merchant family of Greek descent in Moscow. He entered the civil service in the early 19th century and moved to St. Petersburg, where he began to study art. He first practiced with pictures of the Hermitage and with portraits of friends. He later became acquainted with Vladimir Borovikovsky and lived in his house as an apprentice. He tried to work as a freelance portraitist, but received few commissions. In 1811 the Board of the Academy of Arts awarded him the title of Academician for his two works - Self-Portrait and Portrait of K. I. Golovachevsky and the Younger Pupils of the Academy. In 1819, devoting himself purely to art, Venetsianov left the service, bought the village of Safonkovo, and settled there. During this time he painted scenes from nature that he observed around him. These works were of prime importance in his career. He painted portraits of peasants, and scenes illustrating rural life. He was the first to depict peasant life in Russian art. His works achieved great success at the exhibition of 1824, where he received critical praise. Venetsianov wished to become a professor in the Academy of Arts, but the academicians did not grant him their approval, mainly because he lacked academic training. During the years prior to 1820 he began to attract young people from poor backgrounds, and even serfs such as Grigory Soroka, to teach them painting. By the middle of the 1820s he had a group of followers, and established his own school of painting. Tsar Nicholas I, who liked to promote ‚Äònational trends‚Äô, expressed his approval for the artist and appointed him a court painter. This title gave him the financial support necessary for running the school, where tuition was practically free. Venetsianov died in an accident in 1847 when his horses dashed off and his carriage fell down a steep slope.

He grew up in a Catholic and patriotic Polish family. In 1928, after completing gymnasium in Nak≈Ço nad NoteciƒÖ, Poland he entered Seminary in Gniezno, where he studied under professors Rev. Kazimierz Rolewski, Rev. Aleksander ≈ªychli≈Ñski, Father Micha≈Ç Kozal (beatified martyr from Dachau). He was ordained in 1933 by Cardinal August Hlond and began work as an assistant in parishes in Inowroc≈Çaw and from 1938 in Gniezno. When the Second World War erupted in 1939, he was arrested by the Gestapo and sent to Piotrk√≥w Trybunalski. On August 15, 1943 he was arrested again and taken to O≈õwiƒôcim (Auschwitz) concentration camp. There he caught the Typhus and fought for weeks with death. In June 1944, the Soviet offensive prompted the Germans to evacuate the camp to cover up their atrocities. Together with a couple of thousand of other Poles and Russians he was moved to Buchenwald, then Dachau. After the evacuation of Dachau, with a group of 380 other surviving prisoners he found himself in Kleinmuhlingen, where he was finally freed (a friend of his, stated in a eulogy that he was found barely clinging to life after being tossed for dead by the escaping Germans onto a pile of corpses) by the American Seventh Army on April 29, 1945. After a period of convalescence he began his pastoral work in the camps for displaced persons in Westphalia, Germany. In 1947 he was appointed chaplain in Allied prison in Werl near Soest. In 1949 Archbishop J√≥zef Gawlina appointed him a chief coordinator for pastoral work in the British zone of occupied Germany. In 1951 the Church authorities requested that he move to the United States. He worked in the St. W≈Çadys≈Çaw (St. Ladislaus) Parish in Hamtramck in the Archdiocese of Detroit. There he also led the Polish Veterans‚Äô Association. In 1957 he was transferred to build a church and to establish new Polish Parish (Our Lady of Victory) in Chatham, in the Archdiocese of London, Ontario, Canada. Four years later, in 1961, he took over the pastoral duties in the Holy Trinity Polish Parish in Windsor, Ontario. He worked there for 22 years until his retirement in 1983. Through his efforts in 1965, first Convent of Polish Ursuline Sisters, Congregatio Sororum Ursulinarum a Sacro Corde Iesu Agonizantis, was established in Windsor. He contributed to numerous initiatives and supported various foundations, stipends at universities, helped religious charities, and helped many persons privately. In 1977, he founded the Polish Canadian Centre Association of Windsor. A year later, he helped found the Polonia Centre of Windsor, a non-profit charitable organization that conducts cultural activities in the Polish community. In 1979, he was instrumental in creating the Polonia Park Housing Project that built 342 townhouses and apartments for low-income families in Windsor. In 1986, he once again influenced the construction of 69 apartments for low-income families at the Villa Polonia Housing Project in Windsor. He was a Prelate Monsignor and in 1985 he received the title of Protonotary Apostolic for Pope John Paul II. In recognition of his achievements, Msgr. Wnuk received numerous citations and awards.

His design of the second Vermont State House brought him fame and success, which eventually led him to become the first Supervising Architect of the U.S. Treasury Department. As federal architect, he was responsible for creating across the United States numerous custom houses, post offices, courthouses and hospitals, many of which are today on the National Register. His traditional architectural forms lent a sense of grandeur and permanence to the new country's institutions and communities. Young pioneered the use of iron in construction. Early life and works Born in Lebanon, New Hampshire, Ammi B. Young was the son of Rebecca Burnham and Samuel Young, a builder-designer of churches, courthouses and academy buildings in the Lebanon area. He showed a talent for mathematics and drawing, and at the age of 14, began work in his father's trade. In 1823, Young married his first wife, Mary Hough of Lebanon. Like many aspiring builder-designers of the day, he learned the classical orders from pattern books by New England architect Asher Benjamin. Indeed, his design for the Federal style First Congregational Church, built in Lebanon in 1828, borrows significantly from Plate K of The American Builder's Companion. Early commissions included dormitories at nearby Dartmouth College, where his brother, Ira Young, was Professor of Natural Philosophy. But the novice architect also learned from working in the Boston office of Alexander Parris, whose characteristic work in granite influenced Young's subsequent governmental commissions. In 1830, Young opened his own office in Burlington, Vermont, a trade center growing fast since the 1823 opening of the Champlain Canal which connected Lake Champlain with the Hudson River and New York City. Here he designed the 1832 St. Paul's Church in the Gothic Revival style. His first monumental work was the Second Vermont State House, a cruciform Greek Revival structure built between 1833 and 1838, which combined a Doric portico modeled on the Temple of Theseus in Athens, with a low saucer dome inspired by the Pantheon in Rome. The building's granite blocks were hauled to Montpelier on the frozen Winooski River from quarries at Barre. But a fire in 1857 destroyed much of the building, except for the portico and some of the walls. With considerable respect for Young's original design, the Vermont State House was rebuilt, although now with wings extended by a bay, and a cupola crowning the roof ‚Äì the plan of Thomas Silloway, trained in Young's office from 1847 until 1851. The result was considered by architect Stanford White the finest example of the Greek Revival style in the country. Entering the 1837 competition to design the Boston Custom House, Young submitted another cruciform scheme combining a Greek Doric portico with a Roman dome. Planned on a large scale at what was then the waterfront, the building reflected the strength and confidence of the young, growing nation. It won, defeating several other entries, including one by Asher Benjamin. Young was appointed supervisor of construction, which took from 1837 until 1847. In 1838, he established a Boston drafting room. The building's 32 columns were each carved from a single piece from Quincy granite. They measured 5 foot 4 inches in diameter, stood 32 feet high, and weighed 42 tons. Purists decried the Roman dome on a Greek form. Far less sympathetic to the building's Greek form, however, would be the soaring Custom House Tower which replaced the dome from 1913 to 1915. Boston's first skyscraper, it was designed by Peabody & Stearns to add both office space and presence to a building obscured by later others. Supervising Architect of the Treasury Young entered the 1850 competition to design enlargements to the U.S. Capitol in Washington. Although considered a leading competitor, he lost to Thomas U. Walter. As a sort of compensation, he was appointed in 1852 as the first Supervising Architect of the U.S. Treasury Department, a position created by Thomas Corwin, Secretary of the Treasury during the Fillmore administration. From a studio in the Treasury, Young produced designs and specifications for federal buildings ordered by the government to facilitate its various functions throughout the nation. Mandated to be fire-proof, the custom houses, post offices, courthouses and hospitals he built featured masonry foundations, walls and vaulting, with cast iron interior structural and decorative elements, including columns, stairways and railings. Heavy iron shutters were mounted on the inside of windows. Floors and treads were marble, and roofs were galvanized metal. Column capitols, fascia and pediments on the exterior, when not stone, were cast iron painted to look like stone‚Äîwhich drew criticism of parsimony by the federal architect. Cast iron components were manufactured to Young's specifications in New York state, then shipped to building sites. At the same time, ongoing modifications to the Treasury Building concerned Young, expected to create working drawings based on plans by Walter. For the South Wing, he invented a column capital which symbolized the department, substituting acanthus leaves of the Corinthian order with eagles and a fist holding a key. Young held the role until he retired on July 24, 1862, dismissed by Salmon P. Chase of the Lincoln administration. Chase's friend from Cincinnati, Isaiah Rogers, succeeded him as Supervising Architect, although the Civil War curtailed the department's activities. Several of Young's buildings would play a part in the rebellion, particularly his custom house in Richmond, Virginia, which served as the Confederate Treasury. When Richmond in April 1865 was evacuated by the Army of Northern Virginia, with orders to burn warehouses and factories, the Richmond Custom House survived the conflagration‚Äîa testament to its fire-proofing. Indeed, from its courtroom Jefferson Davis was indicted for treason in May 1866. Young was awarded honorary degrees (M.A.) from the University of Vermont (1839) and Dartmouth College (1841). He died in Washington, D. C. and is buried in Oak Hill Cemetery.

Cheney, a right-handed pitcher from Morgan, Georgia, played for the St. Louis Cardinals, Pittsburgh Pirates and Washington Senators in a span of eight seasons from 1957‚Äì1966. Cheney is most notable for striking out the highest number of batters in a Major League Baseball game. He did so on September 12, 1962, when as a Senator, struck out 21 Baltimore Orioles in 16 innings en route to a 2-1 victory. Professional career With the St. Louis Cardinals Cheney was signed as an amateur free agent by the St. Louis Cardinals prior to the start of the baseball season. After spending a few years in the minor leagues, he was called up by the Cardinals in , and made his Major League Baseball debut with the team on April 21, 1957. Cheney pitched in four games during the season, starting in three of them. He posted an 0‚Äì1 record with a 15.00 earned run average in 9 innings of work, giving up 6 hits, while walking 15 batters and striking out 10. The following year, , Cheney did not play in baseball, as he was serving in the United States military. Cheney returned to baseball for the season with the Cardinals, primarily serving as a relief pitcher in the 11 games he pitched during the season. Cheney again had issues with his control and accuracy. He walked 11 men in just 11‚Öî innings of work. He was 0-1 for the season, with a 6.92 ERA, along with giving up 17 hits and striking out 8 batters. On December 21, 1959, in the midst of the off-season, Cheney was traded by the St. Louis Cardinals with his teammate, outfielder Gino Cimoli, to the Pittsburgh Pirates in exchange for relief pitcher Ron Kline. With the Pittsburgh Pirates The Pirates hoped to make Cheney the starting pitcher with control and accuracy that they could depend on. Cheney progressed as a pitcher that season, and put up improved stats that season, pitching a 2‚Äì2 record in eleven games (eight as starting pitcher) with a decent 3.98 earned run average. Cheney only gave up 44 hits while walking 33 men and striking out 35 in 52 innings of work. As a pitcher, Cheney improved remarkably in his transition from the Cardinals to the Pirates. The Pittsburgh Pirates team went on to the World Series after posting an impressive 95-59 record in the regular season. The Pirates defeated the New York Yankees four games to three games, winning the franchise's 3rd overall World Series, and first since . The series was decided by a walk-off home run in the 9th inning of Game 7, when Bill Mazeroski took a 1-0 pitch and crushed it over the left field fence giving Pittsburgh the championship. Cheney served as a relief pitcher in the World Series and pitched four innings in three games (Game 2, 3, and 6), giving up four hits and two earned runs while only walking one batter and striking out six. In , Cheney started off with a terrible performance, giving up 4 earned runs and walking 4 batters in less than a third of an inning. With the Washington Senators Cheney was traded to the Washington Senators on June 29, 1961 in exchange for pitcher Tom Sturdivant. He served as both a starting pitcher and relief pitcher for the remainder of the season with the Washington Senators. He did not fare well, and he again showed signs of lack of control with his pitching. He posted a 1‚Äì3 record in 10 games, 7 of which he started. He put in 29‚Öî innings of work and gave up 32 hits and 29 earned runs. He walked 26 batters and struck out 20. His earned run average ballooned to 8.79, giving him an ERA of 10.00 for the season. Nonetheless, Cheney was on the roster for the Washington Senators in . Cheney pitched in 37 games in total, starting 25 of them. He pitched to a 7‚Äì9 record with four complete games and three shutouts and showed drastic improvement in all aspects of his pitching. He pitched stellarly in 173‚Öì innings, giving up only 134 hits while walking 97 and striking out 147. His ERA for the season was a career-best 3.17. Cheney finished second in the American League in both strikeouts per nine innings and hits allowed per nine innings. was perhaps Cheney's best remembered season. On September 12, 1962, Tom Cheney set the Major League Baseball record for strikeouts in a regular- season game. Cheney pitched brilliantly in 16 innings of work, giving up only one run while striking out a record 21 Baltimore Orioles. Cheney had 13 strikeouts through nine innings. Senators manager Mickey Vernon later wanted to make a change, reportedly asking the pitcher: \\"Your arm okay? You sure you don't want me to take you out?\\", to which Cheney replied . . \\"I told him I didn't want to come out\\", Cheney said. \\"Back in those days, you finished what you started.\\" Cheney wound up pitching eight straight hitless innings near the end. With his 228th and final pitch, he slipped a called third strike past pinch-hitter Dick Williams, who went on to become a major league manager.Obituaries The Dead Ball Era. It was not until the bottom of the 16th inning that teammate Bud Zipfel hit the game-winning home run off Orioles pitcher Dick Hall giving the Senators a hard-fought 2-1 victory and Cheney a win and a major league record that still stands today. To this day, Roger Clemens, Kerry Wood, and Max Scherzer have come threateningly close to Cheney's record, but all four have failed, each striking out 20 men in their respective 9-inning regulation games. Teammate Don Lock says of his gifts: Six days after his great performance, on September 18, 1962, Cheney suffered a setback at D.C. Stadium. Cheney gave up two home runs to Mickey Mantle and lost the game 7-1 to Ralph Terry and the New York Yankees (who would go on to win the 1962 World Series).Tom Cheney Baseball Library. Cheney again pitched skillfully in , a season that is probably considered his best season during his 8-year major league career. Cheney only pitched half the season, but finished with career-bests in wins, complete games, shutouts, and ERA. Cheney pitched in a total of 23 games that season, serving as the starting pitcher in 21 of them. He posted an 8‚Äì9 record, a 2.71 ERA along with 7 complete games and 4 shutouts. Tom gave up just 99 hits in 136‚Öì innings of work and dominated batters by walking only 40 and striking out 97. However, in July 1963, Cheney suffered a devastating elbow injury that played a major role in prematurely ending his major league career just after he was starting to appear as one of the premier pitchers in the American League. Cheney played minimally with the Washington Senators in and . He pitched in his last game on May 9, 1966. His daughter Terri Cook says of his career: Career stats and death In his career, Cheney started 71 games and came in for relief in 44 more. He finished with a 19‚Äì29 record, a 3.77 ERA, 13 complete games, 8 of which were shutouts. He picked up 2 saves, once in and again in .

In 1827 Chrucki came to St. Petersburg and in 1830 entered the Imperial Academy of Arts. His first known works are dated 1832. The paintings gradually gathered public and critical acclaim. Chrucki also worked as an interior designer, and became a popular amongst the wealthy home owners. In 1836 he was awarded the Major Silver medal of the Academy for his still-lifes. Chrucki also executed nice genre pictures and portraits. Old Woman Knitting a Sock, brought him the Minor Gold medal of the Academy. In 1839 he was awarded the title of the Academician. After his father‚Äôs death in 1840 Chrucki left St. Petersburg forever and settled in the family estate Zacharnicze (Zakharenichi, Zacharniczy), Polotsk region. This period was one of commissioned religious art, mostly from Lithuania. Besides religious paintings he also worked on portraits, such as I.I.

Strictly speaking, the name Bullet Cluster refers to the smaller subcluster, moving away from the larger one. It is at a comoving radial distance of . Gravitational lensing studies of the Bullet Cluster are claimed to provide the best evidence to date for the existence of dark matter. Observations of other galaxy cluster collisions, such as MACS J0025.4-1222, similarly support the existence of dark matter.  Overview  The major components of the cluster pair‚Äîstars, gas and the putative dark matter‚Äîbehave differently during collision, allowing them to be studied separately. The stars of the galaxies, observable in visible light, were not greatly affected by the collision, and most passed right through, gravitationally slowed but not otherwise altered. The hot gas of the two colliding components, seen in X-rays, represents most of the baryonic, or \\"ordinary\\", matter in the cluster pair. The gases interact electromagnetically, causing the gases of both clusters to slow much more than the stars. The third component, the dark matter, was detected indirectly by the gravitational lensing of background objects. In theories without dark matter, such as Modified Newtonian dynamics (MOND), the lensing would be expected to follow the baryonic matter; i.e. the X-ray gas. However, the lensing is strongest in two separated regions near (possibly coincident with) the visible galaxies. This provides support for the idea that most of the gravitation in the cluster pair is in the form of two regions of dark matter, which bypassed the gas regions during the collision. This accords with predictions of dark matter as only gravitationally interacting, other than weakly interacting. X-ray image (pink) superimposed over a visible light image (galaxies), with matter distribution calculated from gravitational lensing (blue) The Bullet Cluster is one of the hottest- known clusters of galaxies. It provides an observable constraint for cosmological models, which may diverge at temperatures beyond their predicted critical cluster temperature. Observed from Earth, the subcluster passed through the cluster center 150 million years ago, creating a \\"bow-shaped shock wave located near the right side of the cluster\\" formed as \\"70 million kelvin gas in the sub-cluster plowed through 100 million kelvin gas in the main cluster at a speed of about nearly 10 million km/h (6 million miles per hour)\\". The bow shock radiation output is equivalent to the energy of 10 typical quasars.  Significance to dark matter  The Bullet Cluster provides the best current evidence for the nature of dark matter and provides \\"evidence against some of the more popular versions of Modified Newtonian dynamics (MOND)\\" as applied to large galactic clusters. At a statistical significance of 8, it was found that the spatial offset of the center of the total mass from the center of the baryonic mass peaks cannot be explained with an alteration of the gravitational force law alone. According to Greg Madejski: According to Eric Hayashi: A 2010 study has concluded that the velocities of the collision as currently measured are \\"incompatible with the prediction of a LCDM model\\". However, subsequent work has found the collision to be consistent with LCDM simulations, with the previous discrepancy stemming from small simulations and the methodology of identifying pairs. Earlier work claiming the Bullet Cluster was inconsistent with standard cosmology was based on an erroneous estimate of the in-fall velocity based on the speed of the shock in the X-ray-emitting gas. Based on the analysis of the shock driven by the merger, it was recently argued that a lower merger velocity ~3,950 km/s is consistent with the Sunyaev‚ÄìZeldovich effect and X-ray data, provided that the equilibration of the electron and ion downstream temperatures is not instantaneous.  Alternative interpretations  Mordehai Milgrom, the original proposer of Modified Newtonian dynamics, has posted an online rebuttal of claims that the Bullet Cluster proves the existence of dark matter. Another study in 2006 cautions against \\"simple interpretations of the analysis of weak lensing in the bullet cluster\\", leaving it open that even in the non-symmetrical case of the Bullet Cluster, MOND, or rather its relativistic version TeVeS (tensor‚Äìvector‚Äìscalar gravity), could account for the observed gravitational lensing.

For the second season, Abrams Gentile Entertainment and the Canadian studio Keyframe Digital joined as production companies. Each episode follows an imaginative pink-haired girl named Pinky Dinky Doo as she makes up her own stories. The character of Pinky Dinky Doo was created by Jim Jinkins as a bedtime story for his daughter. In 2002, he developed the idea into a two-part web series, produced by his company Cartoon Pizza alongside Sesame Workshop. In 2003, Random House released a series of six children's books featuring the character, and on April 5, 2005, the show's first season made its worldwide premiere on Discovery Kids in Latin America. The show was first broadcast in English on CBC Canada in December 2005.https://kidscreen.com/2005/09/01/canada-20050901/ As of 2016, the series is reran on HBO Kids as part of HBO's deal with Sesame Workshop.

When a problem arises, Pinky says, \\"That gives me an idea.\\" Tyler asks, \\"Pinky, are you going to make up a story?\\" and Pinky responds, \\"Yeserooni positooni!\\", dancing to a cardboard box called the Storytelling Box. Using chalk and her imagination, she tells a story. In the second season, Pinky uses the Story Pad, a notebook in which she draws pictures, whenever the Story Box is not available. During the made-up story, Pinky must \\"Think Big,\\" at which point her head swells and she comes up with an often wacky solution to the problem while singing \\"If I have a problem, don't know which way to go, I think and think and think and think, and suddenly I know.\\" Some episodes feature variations of the \\"Think Big\\" sequence; for example, in Big Blob of Talk, Pinky listens big instead, and in Back to School Is Cool, Pinky's hair swells instead of her entire head due to her having a bad hair day. In Tyler Dinky Doo to the Rescue, Two Wheel Dreams, Go to Bed Tyler!, and Tyler's Big Idea (series finale), Tyler thinks big instead of Pinky. In Shrinky Pinky, Mr. Guinea Pig does the thinking.

Abrams Gentile financed part of the season in exchange for licensing and merchandising rights.https://www.awn.com/news/pinky-dinky-doo-goes-3d Pinky Dinky Doo was an international co-production. Cartoon Pizza, Sesame Workshop, and Abrams Gentile were based in the United States; CBC and Keyframe Digital were based in Canada; and Discovery Kids was based in Latin America. For season two, the budget was about $200,000 Canadian dollars per episode. Jim Jinkins originally created Pinky Dinky Doo in 2000 as a bedtime story for his then four-year-old daughter. In an interview with Animation Magazine, he admitted, \\"It wasn't pre-meditated as a kid's show.\\" In 2002, Jinkins worked with Sesame Workshop to create two web-based pilot episodes starring Pinky, which were released online in 2003. From 2003 to 2004, Random House published a series of six children's books centered around Pinky. Jim Jinkins said of his work with Sesame Workshop: \\"The Workshop was a beautiful partner ... they didn't overhaul it, but saw it as natural literacy project.\\" Broadcast The series made its worldwide premiere on April 7, 2005, on Discovery Kids in Latin America. The show was first broadcast in English on CBC Canada, which premiered the show in December 2005. Other Canadian stations that aired Pinky Dinky Doo include TVOntario and Knowledge Network, as well as TFO in French Canada. In most other territories, Sesame Workshop aimed to premiere the show in the first quarter of 2006. Before the series premiere, Kidscreen announced that broadcast rights for Pinky Dinky Doo had been sold to ABC Television in Australia. It was also announced that Sesame Workshop was \\"focusing on securing German and French [broadcast] partners,\\" which became Super RTL in Germany and France 5. Pinky Dinky Doo was sold to over 35 international broadcasters. The American Forces Network, a channel operated by the U.S. Armed Forces, aired Pinky Dinky Doo from 2006 to 2016.

The Spanish-language U.S. network Univision aired the show as part of its morning programming block for children, Planeta U, from 2008 to 2011. The Nick Jr. channel aired the show from 2009 until 2012. Since January 17, 2016, HBO Kids has aired the series as part of HBO's partnership with Sesame Workshop. In the United Kingdom, the show was broadcast on the BBC's children's network CBeebies. It was originally shown in American English, but it was later redubbed and broadcast with British English voices. In Brazil, TV Cultura aired a Brazilian Portuguese dub. The series also aired on Rai Yoyo in Italian, Baraem in Arabic, and Hop! Channel in Hebrew. Episodes Description The show helps viewers increase their vocabularies with its Great Big Fancy Word, which is featured several times during the episode. It also addresses problem-solving skills as well as the basics of narrative stories‚Äîcharacter, dialogue, plot, details, main idea and sequence of events. After Pinky tells her story and solves the problem of the day, kids are invited to play an interactive game on the Cheese Sandwich toy, where they review details about the story. At the end of each episode, Pinky says, \\"I love to make up stories. I'll bet you can make up a story too.\\" In each episode, there is also a \\"Great Big Fancy Word\\", which varies with each episode, but when somebody is about to say the word, Mr. Guinea Pig will blow a trumpet and then the character says the word (even if Mr. Guinea Pig himself says the word). In In The Dark, Tyler blows the trumpet instead of Mr. Guinea pig. In Come Home Little Guinea Pig, both Pinky and Mr. Guinea Pig blow the trumpet. In Tyler Dinky Doo's Big Boo, Go To Bed Tyler, Pinky Dinky Doo and the Missing Dinosaurs, The Mystery Planet, Tyler and the 4Ms, Loch Mess Lobster, and Tyler's Silly Shirt, Mr. Guinea uses a different instrument when someone is going to say the great big fancy word. This series was created by Jim Jinkins, who originally made up Pinky's adventures as bedtime tales for his children. The executive producers are Jinkins and David Campbell. It is a production of Sesame Workshop, Cartoon Pizza, Keyframe Digital, and Abrams Gentile Entertainment.

Background and productions During the original run of After All, in 1879, Richard D'Oyly Carte, Gilbert and Sullivan broke up the \\"Comedy Opera Company\\" that they had formed in 1877 to present the Gilbert and Sullivan operas. The former directors of that company staged a rival version Pinafore, along with After All, but their versions were not as popular as Carte's.

It would play to empty boxes, half-empty upper circle, to a gradually filling stalls and dress circle, but to an attentive, grateful and appreciative pit and gallery. Often these plays were little gems. They deserved much better treatment than they got, but those who saw them delighted in them. ...

In 1935 the company began producing the electrically powered model trains that it became famous for, under the Trix Express label. Prior to the outbreak of World War II the company produced a small range of AC (14 V) powered three rail loco models (e.g. 20/51, 20/52, 20/53, 20/54) running on bakelite rails. After more than six decades of independence, the TRIX company got increasingly into economic difficulties in the 1990s and was completely taken over in 1997 by the G√∂ppingen competitor M√§rklin, but continued as an independent brand. Since then there has been increasing overlap between the model ranges from TRIX and M√§rklin in size H0; New model developments differ only in the respective power systems (alternating current at M√§rklin, direct current at TRIX International). The causes for the economic crisis of the model railway manufacturers can be seen in a serious change in the market. To date, the companies have not been able to develop any long-term sustainable concepts for this. Trix Twin Railway Trix Twin Railway, scale model Compound (AC), 1950 Under the name TTR (Trix Twin Railway), the TRIX Express model railway was also available in England from the end of 1935. First of all, locomotives made in Germany were repainted in England. Since 1936, the locomotive bogies that were still supplied from Germany were equipped with housings in the English style. A TRIX subsidiary in England had existed since the early 1930s and was initially responsible for sales of the metal construction kit. The English model range was further expanded after the German company founder Stephan Bing was driven out of Germany by the Nazis in 1938. In the beginning most of the models run with alternating current (AC). After second world war the production resumed in 1948 but began to lag behind the technology used by rivals. Trix switched from AC to DC (with its simple reversing function) later than rivals like Tri-ang, particularly the British Trix company. In 1956 Trix switched to DC and in 1967 to two-rail as used by most competitors. The production of plastic models began in the late 1950s; the three-wire system was able to last there until 1967, when the international two-wire system was converted. The company then changed hands several times and at times also operated as Trix Trains and British Trix. The legacy of TTR then went to the British subsidiary of Liliput in the 1970s. Production of British Trix OO gauge trains ceased in 1973.Ramsay's British Model Trains catalogue, 6th edition 2008 page 414. Minitrix Minitrix ICE model N gauge models under the Minitrix brand were made from the late 1960s mostly of European prototypes (German and British primarily). North American prototypes were also manufactured and marketed under the Aurora \\"Postage Stamp\\" brand; later these items were sold under the American Tortoise, Model Power and Con-Cor brands. Trix sometimes utilized North American consultants to aid in the design of this portion of the product line. The \\"Hornby Minitrix' brand was used in the 1980s for a short lived range of British outline models using the earlier product tooling. Ownership Trix's owner in the 1980s and 1990s was Mangold, which went bankrupt in the late 1990s and M√§rklin purchased the assets in January 1997. In part, this purchase was a reflection of M√§rklin's need for added production capacity; Trix had been manufacturing certain items for M√§rklin in previous years. The purchase was also in response to the earlier purchase of the Karl Arnold company by the Italian company Rivarossi; M√§rklin were very keen to take over Trix market share in 2-rail H0 and especially Minitrix, until then M√§rklin had not marketed N gauge models. In 2003, M√§rklin introduced its first N gauge models under the well established Minitrix brand. A number of M√§rklin H0 scale three- rail AC locomotives have also been introduced in two-rail DC versions under the Trix logo and many models are shared between the two brands. Since around 2003 or 2004 Trix has made a two-rail version of the M√§rklin C-track, and the two are mostly identical except for the colour of the trackbed and the height of the rails (with M√§rklin being 2,3 mm high and Trix 2,1 mm). Also, some of M√§rklin's digital components (such as the Mobile Station) are made in Trix versions with different colours and another logo; but otherwise identical and fully compatible with M√§rklin's. For a number of years Trix has made two-rail versions of many M√§rklin models with only minor differences, such as axles (electrically insulated) and for powered models (being of lighting and/or a motor) power pickup. United States Outside Europe, the Minitrix brand is very popular in the United States of America. Other Trix brands Besides the AC Trix Express and Minitrix brands, the Trix company is also well known for its 1:87 scale DC brands, Trix International and Trix H0, dating back at least to the early 1970s and still being produced today. Bavarian prototypes A particular Trix speciality is the reproduction of Bavarian models from Epoch I and their equivalent Epoch II, DRG versions. Examples such as the B VI (BR 34), D XI (BR 984-5), D XII (BR 73), G 3/4 H (BR 54), Gt 2x4/4 (BR 96), P 3/5 H (BR 384), PtL 2/2 (BR 983) and S 3/6 (BR 184) have been produced in the steam locomotive line, along with numerous passenger and goods wagons. Brass models Trix also produced highly detailed brass models of steam locomotives in limited quantities under the \\"Fine Art\\" label, predominantly in the late-1990s.

Born in Neustadt am R√ºbenberge, he was educated at the universities of Marburg (1543) and Wittenberg, where he studied theology. At Wittenberg, his talents were recognized by Philipp Melanchthon. As magister, he became in 1575 a minister and inspector of churches in L√ºneburg. He wrote plays and in later years became involved in mediating theological disputes. He died on February 27, 1598 at L√ºneburg. Dedekind's Grobianus Dedekind was the author of Grobianus et Grobiana: sive, de morum simplicitate, libri tres (Cologne, 1558). This work had first been published in 1549 as Grobianus, but it appeared with additions known as Grobiana in 1554. A poem in Latin elegiac verse, it was first published in two books in 1549, and revised form and enlarged to three books in 1552. Dedekind's work had an immense popularity across Continental Europe. The work describes the fictional Saint Grobian as a counselor who teaches men on how to avoid bad manners, gluttony, and drunkenness. Dedekind's work appeared in England in 1605 as ', published by one \\"R.F.\\". The \\"Schoole\\" was imagined as a place where one was instructed to use one's greasy fingers to grab at the nicest portions of any dish and snatch food belonging to fellow diners. Holding back the desire to urinate, fart, and vomit is taught to be bad for one's health; thus, one has to indulge freely in all three activities. The work also inspired Thomas Dekker's The Guls Horne-Booke (1609). The Portrait of Friedrich Dedekind was found in Hannover (2008) by: Eberhard Doll, hidden for more than 400 years under the front cover of his own personal Bible, at the Gottfried Whilhelm Leibniz Library. This portrait was painted in beautiful water colors and underneath, a hand-written autograph in Latin was dedicated to his elder son Euricius. Signed by Friedrich, Luneburg 1589.

He was a founding member of the Edmund Burke Society, established by Paul Fromm, Don Andrews, and Leigh Smith. He was also part of an attempted takeover by Fromm of the Ontario wing of the national Social Credit Party of Canada. Overfield appears to have run for office under the banner of the Social Credit Party in the riding of Beaches-Woodbine. Though he was expelled from the national party, he remained a member of the Ontario Social Credit Party, which had been taken over by the Edmund Burke Society in the early 1970s. In 1973, after the Edmund Burke Society became the Western Guard Party, Overfield claims to have founded the Canadian Liberty League as an alternative to the Western Guard. Overfield later became a member of Don Andrew's Nationalist Party of Canada. It was through his involvement with Andrews that Overfield became acquainted with Wolfgang Droege whom Overfield employed as a part-time bailiff.  The Reform Party of Canada  Overfield claims to have been out of politics for 15 years when he decided to become active again. When he joined the Reform Party of Canada, he claims to have \\"let the Reform Party executive know about his political past, and they had no problems with it.\\" Overfield stated that Reform Party member Harry Robertson admitted him to the Party and that future Prime Minister of Canada Stephen Harper was well aware of Overfield's past involvement in far right groups. Harper denied such knowledge and stated that he had been \\"building issues into the Reform Party's platform to actively discourage extremists and 'nut cases'\\" at the time of Overfield's membership. One claim for Overfield's involvement in the Reform Party was an attempt to discredit the party for Preston Manning's involvement in placing the Ontario wing of the Social Credit Party under the personal trusteeship of the national leader to counter Paul Fromm's activities. However, it is also on the record that Overfield's confided in Paul Fromm that his plan was \\"to unify all the right wing people into one cohesive organization. He was pushing to infiltrate ten or twelve Riding Associations in Metro Toronto. Even if they did not win the riding associations in an election, they would at least have control. The attraction of Reform for Overfield and like-minded persons, he said was that it was strictly white bread, 100 percent white Canadians, really anti- immigration; there was really no difference between those people and them (Overfield's group).\\" While he was a member of the Reform Party, Overfield claimed to have signed up 22 members, including Heritage Front members Peter Mitrevski, Nicola Polinuk, Droege, Zvominir Lelas and Tony Cinncinato.  Security for the Reform Party  In the early 1990s when the Reform Party was making inroads into Ontario, there were concerns about groups that would try to disrupt Reform meetings. Also, Reform Party leader Preston Manning did not have Royal Canadian Mounted Police security and was instead dependent upon local organizations. On May 27, 1991, Andrew Flint, then the Ontario Regional Coordinator for the Reform Party, was approached by Overfield who offered his bailiff as Reform Party security. Among those who worked as security for the Reform Party were Wolfgang Droege, James Dawson, Peter Mitrevski, other Heritage Front members, and Grant Bristow, who was later discovered to be a Canadian Security Intelligence Service mole. Bristow became Manning's personal bodyguard while Overfield's men were providing security at Reform Party meetings and rallies.  Expulsion from the Reform Party  On February 28, 1992, the Toronto Sun broke the story that the Heritage Front had infiltrated the Reform Party. Droege claimed as many as 150 to 200 Heritage Front members were also members of the Reform Party, including some at the riding executive levels, but only a handful were discovered to be actual Heritage Front members. When Reform Party executives became aware that Heritage Front members had joined the Reform Party, a special committee of the Executive Council began an investigation. The Special Committee revoked the membership in the Reform Party of Droege, Dawson, Polinuk, and Mitrevski.

Career Born in Liverpool, Merseyside, Cox played for South Shore Standard, South Shore F.C., and Blackpool before being signed by Liverpool managers John McKenna and William Barclay in February 1898 for the then-large sum of ¬£150, enabling the Lancashire club to announce a loss of \\"only\\" ¬£441 for the season, as opposed to over ¬£1,000 for the previous campaign.Calley, Roy (1992).

Cox became a regular starter for the Reds on both the left and right flanks, helping them secure their first two championships, in 1901 and 1906. Although the one who predominantly lined up goals for his teammates to take, Cox, himself, had an eye for the mark and scored 81 goals from his 361 starts, an average of one goal every 4.5 games. It was this kind of form that caught the eye of the FA, who selected Cox for the British Home Championship match against Ireland at The Dell, Southampton on 9 March 1901. This match saw England win 3‚Äì0, after which he represented England on two further occasions. Cox left Liverpool in 1909, returning to Blackpool, effectively as player-manager.

A summit book or summit register is a record of visitors to the summit of a mountain. It is usually enclosed in a weatherproof, animalproof metal canister. Some books are maintained in an informal manner by an individual or small group, while others are maintained by a club. Well known and often climbed peaks, such as those on peak bagging lists, are more likely to have summit books. On the other hand, mountains which are very heavily climbed or have popular trails up, such as Mount Whitney or Ben Nevis, may not have registers, or may have a daily log book that is changed out often. The Sierra Club places official registers on many mountains throughout California and the United States. These are typically small notebooks kept inside large metal boxes. When registers are filled up, they are collected and stored in the Bancroft Library in Berkeley, California where they are available to view. Entries in a summit book vary, from a simple note of a person's name and date of the climb, to notes about the scenery or long essays about the events of the climb. Some summit books contain a record of climbs going back for many years. On an infrequently climbed peak, this record may exist in one volume on the peak itself, while on frequently climbed peaks with a well maintained register, this record may be spread over many volumes, all but the current one in the possession of the maintaining person or club.

Almost all of its area is located on the left, western bank of the Birs and is a suburb of Basel. The Neolithic gravesite in the Gmeiniwald is listed as a heritage site of national significance.Swiss inventory of cultural property of national and regional significance (1995), p. 65. The official language of Aesch is (the Swiss variety of Standard) German, but the main spoken language is the local variant of the Alemannic Swiss German dialect. History Aesch is first mentioned in 1252 as Esch. Prehistoric Aesch The area around Aesch was inhabited as far back as the Upper Paleolithic, as the graves at Gmeiniwald show. The Dolmen graves of the A-Schw√∂rstadt type date from about the 3rd millennium BC. Gmeiniwald was discovered in 1907, and excavated in 1907 and again in 1909. A central, rectangular grave chamber of was found under a shallow mound of about in diameter. The grave contained the skeletal remains of 47 individuals, including 14 children, as well as evidence of cremation burials. The grave also contained arrows, spears and flint knives, animal tooth pendants, a mallet made of red sandstone and quartzite, and pottery fragments. In 1977, along the Fluhstrasse, the remains of a middle Bronze Age settlement were discovered. The settlement dates from 1500-1300 BC and includes a fireplace and stone settings, the foundation of a house, and pot shards. In K√§nelacker in 1923, a shop used for casting bronze from about 1300 BC was discovered. The site included copper cake and bronze fragments, including two medium-sized winged axes and various partially decorated plates and sickles. Late Bronze Age artifacts and pottery from 1300-800 BC were found at the old tram depot on the main road and along the road to Lerch. Roman era and middle ages Ruins of Frohberg Castle During the Roman era there were three Roman estates from the 1st-4th Century, and traces of their viticulture have been found near the modern town of Aesch. During the Early Middle Ages, cemeteries were located in Steinacker (7th Century) and in Saalb√ºnten (now part of the church, probably from the 8th-10th Centuries). These finds cast doubt on the traditional idea that Aesch grew out of the 12th Century church farm that belonged to the church of Pfeffingen. Frohberg Castle was first mentioned in 1292, but by 1356 was in decline. Early modern era This area was part of the bishop's bailiwick of Pfeffingen from the 13th Century until 1519, when it was inherited by the Count of Thierstein. It was owned by that family until 1792. During that time, it was administered by the landvogt of Pfeffingen. Between 1583 and 1792, the landvogt's office was held by the Blarer family. In 1566, the bishop built a brick barn and in 1611 the bishop had a new wine-press built. In 1702, Aesch became the bailiwick seat, and the bailiff moved into Blarer Castle, which had been built in 1604-07. After the construction of the Angensteiner bridge, Aesch became a customs station. The Customs House at the \\"Mugge\\" was built in 1715. The inhabitants of this area were part of the parish of Pfeffingen. In 1672 the Blarer family donated a chapel (dedicated to St. Joseph) to the village. In the Late Middle Ages there was a nunnery along the Klus, however there are scant written records or archeological evidence of the building. The residents of Aesch, like the rest of the bailiwick of Pfeffingen, did not hold citizens' rights in the city of Basel. However, in 1529 they converted to the Protestant Reformation along with Basel. Between 1582-88, the village stood in the center of the last successful Counter-Reformation efforts of the Bishop of Basel, Jacob Christoph Blarer of Wartensee. Due to its border location, Aesch suffered repeated looting and pillaging, during the Thirty Years War (1618‚Äì48) and other religious conflicts of this era. Due to the repeated attacks, very few buildings from before the 17th Century survived. The farming village was dominated by vineyards, due to fertile soils, mild climate and sunny slopes. In 1745 there were six coopers (barrel makers) living in the village and the village farmers and rural poor were hired by the village farmers. After the short-lived Rauracian Republic (1792‚Äì93), the village was under French rule from 1793 to 1815. Between 1793-1800 it was part of the D√©partement of Mont- Terrible and then in 1800-1815 it was part of the D√©partement of Haut-Rhin. As part of Haut-Rhin, it became a separate parish in 1803. The parish church of St. Joseph was built in 1819-20 and rebuilt in 1938-39. In 1815, the entire Birseck region, including Aesch, was awarded to the Canton of Basel. During the revolutions of 1830, revolutionary political leaders, including Anton von Blarer, rose to prominence in Aesch. In late 1830, a liberty pole with the slogan \\"Freedom or death\\" was erected in Aesch. Modern Aesch thumb Aesch train station Until the 20th Century Aesch retained its predominantly agricultural character even though some companies moved in. These companies included the Stoecklin rope factory (1865) and the Vogel fabricated metal products factory (1876). The number of acres under cultivation as vineyards dropped sharply during the late 19th Century. In 1846 there were , while in 1906 it had dropped to . The local farmers fought back with phylloxera eradication and a wine cooperative, so that Aesch now has the largest proportion of vineyards in Basel-Country. In 1985 there were of vineyards under cultivation. Despite the accessibility of the Jura Bahn railway from Basel to Del√©mont (built in 1875) and the tram line Basel-Aesch (in 1907), very few industrial and commercial companies moved into Aesch until after World War II. In the post-war years, companies in the metal processing, mechanical engineering and pharmaceutical industry settled in the new industrial zones. The correction of the river Birs in 1970 opened up further industrial land. The number of farms decreased from 88 (1929) to 21 (1980) to 16 (1999). Strong population growth has led to brisk construction activity, including the entirely new settlement of Neu-Aesch which was built in 1987. In 1990, 54% of the jobs were in the services sector, and 74% of workers were commuters. In 1851, Blarer Castle was bought by the municipality and converted into a school house. It was auctioned off and renovated in 1959 into a modern office building. Geography Hills around Aesch Aerial view from 500 m by Walter Mittelholzer (1922) Aesch has an area, , of .

The Irish Play was performed in a Royal Shakespeare Company production at the Royal Shakespeare Company Warehouse Theatre in London, England with Ron Cook, Brenda Fricker, and P.G. Stephens in the cast. Barry Kyle was director. Writing in Variety in 2005, David Rooney found the Manhattan Theatre Club's production of Moonlight and Magnolias to be a \\"flimsy comedy\\", but that \\"despite its superficial exploration of anti-Semitism in 1939 Hollywood, the play is not without its pleasures\\". Reviewing the Tricycle Theatre's production of the play for The Daily Telegraph two years later, Charles Spencer called it a \\"delightful screwball comedy that is also a valentine to the golden days of Hollywood. A prolific screenwriter himself, who knows what it is to be holed up in a hotel room at two in the morning with a script to doctor for the following day's shoot, Hutchinson has come up with a comedy of panache that's certainly worth giving a damn about.\\" In April 2019, BBC Radio 4 broadcast Hutchinson's Ship of Lies, a five-part drama based on some of the legends and myths regarding RMS Titanic.

It was formed in July 1958 and dissolved as part of the formation of the new United Democratic Party in 1973.  Formation  The NIP was founded on July 1, 1958. Herbert Fuller was elected Leader and James Staines deputy. Other officers included: Chairman Jaime Staines, Secretary Phillip Goldson, Deputy Chairman Robert Reneau, Asst. Sec. Jeannette Buller, Treasurer C. L. B. Rogers and National Organizer Lindsay Burns. District branches were in place by April 1959, and the party gained representation in the Belize City Council in December 1958, when Fuller, Staines, Rogers and Claire Gill were elected, though Meighan and Floss Cassasola campaigned as independents and cut loose from the Party for their behaviour. Another spat came when the Benque Viejo branch set itself up as the Western Independent Party under Juan Gongora and sought affiliation with the NIP, which it agreed to. The NIP also participated in constitutional consultations with Sir Hilary Blood in 1959 and 1960.  Troubles  The NIP was seen as the heir of the National and Honduran Independence parties, and with the popularity of the PUP and the failure by the NIP to shake loose from elements that would have them return to their origins, the party began a run of disappointing performances that would become its main legacy. March 1, 1961 general elections saw the NIP shut out of the House. Phillip Goldson was appointed by the Governor and subsequently assumed the post of Party Leader from Fuller, who died in March 1962. In the December 1962 City Council elections, the NIP began a run of complete shutouts that lasted until the UDP's 6-3 triumph in 1974. In the town board elections the NIP were more successful, winning two towns in 1963, five in 1966 (three outright), and sliding back to two towns in 1969 and San Ignacio only in 1972. General elections of 1965 and 1969 (in which the NIP collaborated with the breakaway PDM) saw Phillip Goldson retain both times and Edwin Morey earning a surprise victory in 1965. With the party's loss of face and the frustrations of Belizeans evident, Goldson left to continue his education in the early 1970s and the NIP limped along until the younger, stronger PDM and Liberal Party merged with it to form the UDP in 1973.

Biography 1840-1869: Saint Petersburg Alexei Harlamoff was born into a family of serfs on 18 October 1840 in the village of Dyachevka near Saratov on the River Volga. In 1850 Harlamoff's parents won their freedom. Harlamoff became a guest student at the Imperial Academy of Arts in Saint Petersburg in 1854. Three years later he was awarded a second class silver medal for a drawing. In 1862 Harlamoff was awarded a second class silver medal for a sketch, and he enrolled with the historical painter Alexey Tarasovich Markov. In 1863 he was awarded two first class silver medals, for a drawing and for a sketch. In 1865 he presented his large scale painting Ananias before the Apostles, but did not win the competition for a second class gold medal. The next year however he did win this award, for his painting Baptizing of the Kiever. He completed his studies in 1868, winning a first class gold medal for his Return of the Prodigal Son, and was granted a scholarship from the academy to study in Paris in 1869. 1869-1874: Establishment in Paris In 1870 Tsarina Maria Alexandrovna bought one of Harlamoff's paintings. In April he sent his first letter from Paris to Saint Petersburg. He spent September and October of that year in Normandy and the southern Netherlands with Alexey Bogolyubov, C. Huhn, and A. Lavezzari. He also travelled to Brussels and to London, where he visited an exhibition of Old Masters. In November the Academy of Arts commissioned him to copy Rembrandt‚Äôs Anatomy Lesson of Dr. Tulp, and he stayed in The Hague. From Spring 1871 to Autumn 1872 Harlamoff copied The Anatomy Lesson of Dr. Tulp in a drawing and in oil. During the summer of 1871 he returned to Normandy. In November 1872 the Imperial Academy in Saint Petersburg paid him 1,500 roubles for the copy of Rembrandt. In 1872 Harlamoff met L√©on Bonnat and visited his independent studio. He was also awarded a bronze medal at the Vienna Universal Exhibition. The conference secretary of the Academy of Arts, Peter F. Iseyev, rejected Bogolyubov's request to grant Harlamoff a professorship. In December Bogolyubov reported to the council of the Imperial Academy of Arts on Harlamoff's visible success under the guidance of Bonnat. By 1874 Harlamoff was living at rue Fontaine 42. He took part in the spring exhibition of the Imperial Academy of Arts. His portrait of the engraver Pozhalostin won him the title of art academy member. From April onwards Harlamoff joined the drawing evenings at Bogolyubov's residence in rue de Rome, 95. Around this time Ivan Turgenev mentioned Harlamoff for the first time in a letter, and his paintings are bought by Bogolyubov, the Parisian art dealer Adolphe Goupil and the Muscovite collector Dimitri P. Botkin. Harlamoff began socialising with Turgenev and other Russian artists in Paris. He was frequently invited for dinner with Louis Viardot and Pauline Viardot-Garcia in rue Douai 50, where Turgenev occupied the top floor. In June Harlamoff painted a portrait of Tsar Alexander II in Bad Ems, possibly spending the rest of the summer in Spain. He then travelled to Veules-les-Roses and √âtretat. In October Turgenev wrote that Harlamoff had completed the portrait of Pauline Viardot, for which he was paid 3.000 FFR, leading to an increase of his fees for a portrait up to 10.000 FFR (around 3.000 roubles). 1874 onwards: Success In January 1875 Harlamoff completed a portrait of Elena Tretyakova in an evening dress. He began a portrait of Turgenev, which he finished in December. During this period he also accepted other commissions, and may have spent March in Spain. In May he exhibited at the Salon, where the portraits of Pauline Viardot-Garcia and Louis Viardot drew the attention of the Parisian press. He moved into the studio of the late Isidore Pils at Place Pigalle 11. During this year he was beginning to gain popularity with British art dealers. At New Years and the beginning of 1876 he visited Russia. In 1876 the young soprano singer F√©lia Litvinne arrived from Saint Petersburg and started taking lessons with Pauline Viardot-Garcia. Turgenev purchased one of Harlamoff's paintings from Bogolyubov, entitled Gipsy Girl. Harlamoff joined the Society for Art Exhibitions at the Imperial Academy of Arts, in May he exhibited the portraits of Turgenev and Alphonse Daudet at the Salon. Harlamoff and Turgenev visited the Imperial Academy of Arts in late May/early June 1877. Turgenev commissioned Harlamoff to portrait the bibliophile collector Alexandre F. Onegin (Otto). On 28 November 1877 (10 December) Harlamoff became a founding member of the Association of Russian Artists for the Mutual Support and Benefaction Abroad (President: the Russian minister in Paris Prince Nikolai A. Orlov, chairman: Bogolyubov, Secretary: Turgenev, purser: the banker Horace G√ºnzburg). In 1878 Harlamoff exhibited his paintings at the Salon and at the Universal Exhibition in Paris simultaneously. His portrait of Alexander F. Onegin was awarded a second class medal. In 1879 Peter F. Iseyev asked Harlamoff to collaborate on decorating the Cathedral of Christ the Saviour in Moscow. He was also invited to exhibit at the elitist \\"Cercle de l‚ÄôUnion artistique\\" (\\"Club des Mirlitons\\"). For the first time Harlamoff was a visiting exhibitor at the Itinerant Art Exhibition in Russia. Ivan Kramskoi convinced Harlamoff to switch from the Society for Art Exhibitions at the Imperial Academy of Arts to the Association of the Itinerant Art Exhibitions, which he did in 1880. In 1879 he also travelled again to Spain, and to Biarritz, where he painted the prominent Russian publisher Andrey Krayevsky. Through 1881 and 1882 Harlamoff exhibited three paintings at the All-Russian Exhibition Centre in Moscow. In 1883 Harlamoff was commissioned to portray Paul Demidoff, Prince of San Donato, and his family. He also travelled to Florence that same year. In 1885 he supported Bogolyubov's plan to found a museum in Saratov by donating his painting Italian Girl with a Lizard. He also took part in the 5th Exhibition of the Association of Watercolour Artists in Saint Petersburg. The next year Sergei M. Tretyakov recommended to his brother Pavel that he should purchase Harlamoff's Girl Laughing for the Tretyakov Gallery in Moscow. In 1888, on Bogolyubov's suggestion, Vladimir Stasov exhibited Harlamoff's portrait of Turgenev at an Itinerant Art Exhibition. He was also exhibited at the International Exhibition in Glasgow, where Queen Victoria was reportedly impressed by his paintings. The next year Harlamoff joined the organizing committee of the Universal Exhibition in Paris, where he showed eleven of his paintings that year. Later years In 1891 Harlamoff organized the 50-year jubilee of Bogoliubov's activity. At the 19th Itinerant Art Exhibition in Saint Petersburg Tsarina Maria Fedorovna purchased his painting Portrait of a Young Girl. When Bogolyubov died in 1896 Harlamoff was nominated chairman of the Association of Russian Artists for the Mutual Support and Benefaction with its seat in Paris. In 1900 Harlamoff was appointed Chevalier of the Legion of Honour. He exhibited again at the Universal Exhibition in Paris, and after a break of eight years he participated again in the Itinerant Art Exhibition. In 1902 Harlamoff was awarded the medal of St. Vladimir (4th Class). In 1909 Harlamoff moved to his new studio, Boulevard de Rochechouart, 57bis. Between 1911 and 1914 Harlamoff participated in exhibitions with Galerie Lemercier in Moscow. In 1922 Felia Litvinne showed the works of Harlamoff in her salon in Paris. Harlamoff died on 10 April 1925 in his studio on Boulevard de Rochechouart with Litvinne as his sole heir.

It is part of the international broadcast ministry of The World Family of Radio Maria, which is based in Italy and broadcasts in over thirty countries in thirteen languages worldwide. The station also audiostreams from its website for listeners outside its immediate signal area in addition to its very own smartphone app, the Tune In app and the Alexa device. History A group of New York City-based volunteers known as \\"Friends of Radio Maria\\" which operates an Italian language FM subcarrier (of WKTU) acquired the original funding and construction permit for the new station in 2001 by means of a New York-based fundraiser called a \\"Mariathon.\\" The construction permit however initially sat dormant until it was discovered by a group of Dayton area volunteers in 2005 looking for a Miami Valley frequency to start a local Catholic station. After a tower site was found, WHJM joined the Radio Maria family on June 8, 2006 while volunteers feverishly proceeded with preparations to get on the air before the construction permit was to have expired. Within just a few days prior to the construction permit's deadline date to start broadcasting, WHJM \\"Radio Maria\\" first came on the air on June 15, 2006. Its transmitting antenna and tower was abruptly struck by a spectacular display of lightning only after two hours on the air during its inaugural sign-on. However, the brief airtime before the lightning strike was enough to fulfill the FCC deadline. After necessary repairs were made, WHJM returned to the air August 11, 2006. Its current operating power is 1,000 watts ERP.Query the FCC's FM station database for WHJM-FM WHJM's current signal fades-out north of Lima at Beaverdam where WJTA's FM translator (W204CU) in Findlay fades in, followed by CIMX in Windsor, Ontario which begins to fade-in north towards Bowling Green and Toledo. Its signal also fades out to the south near Tipp City where listeners can switch to 1600 AM (WULM) in Springfield or 103.3 FM (WULM's translator W277AO) in Enon. Friends of Radio Maria also helped acquire the construction permits of new repeater stations WOLM in D'Iberville, Mississippi near Biloxi and WRMW licensed to Peshtigo serving the Door Peninsula region of northeastern Wisconsin. These stations are now licensed to Radio Maria Inc.  Call sign history  The WHJM call letters were previously used at an Urban/R&B;/Hip-Hop formatted station at 107.7 FM in Ledyard/Pawcatuk, Connecticut. The call sign for that station has since switched to WWRX. Before that, the WHJM calls were used on 1180 AM in Knoxville, Tennessee which had used Christian Country, Adult Standards and talk radio formats. That station is now WKCE. KJMJ has been on the air as the US flagship station of Radio Maria since May 2000. Originally, the 580 frequency was home to KALB-AM, sister station to KALB-TV channel 5. Radio Maria was founded at first with humble beginnings as a small parish-operated station in Erba (province of Como,) Italy in 1983 before its subsequent international growth in the 1990s which gave birth to the World Family in 1998.Catholic Telegraph news article on Radio Maria's Ohio sign-on (September 8, 2006) Emanuele Ferrario is Radio Maria's founder and Carlo DiMaggio as its president.  Facilities and programming  Though WHJM, for the most part, is a repeater of KJMJ, there is a studio facility west of Anna in nearby Minster which originates several live programs including \\"Living The Lectionary\\" (now hosted by Julia Monnin after the passing of Father Rick Nieberding in 2019) and Herb Wilker's Hospice program \\"Letting Go.\\" Past local programs originated by audio recording and over telephone lines included \\"At Home With Jesus' with Glenda Canfield,\\"From The Tummy To The Heart\\" and \\"Francesca and Friends\\" presented by Francesca Franchina from The University of Dayton's Marian Library. The studio officially opened on Sunday April 22, 2007 with a prayer and blessing service and open house officiated by Father Rick Nieberding C.P.P.S.(1953-2019) who was pastor of St. Augustine Church and the original presenter of the program \\"Living The Lectionary.\\" WHJM was also the originator of the yearly remote broadcast of the Fatima USA candlelight prayer vigil which takes place in the evening during the month of August at Maria Stein, a concelebration involving parishes from Minster, Marion Township and Saint Henry. Overnight programming was provided by Radio Maria New York and originated by WSNR 620 am licensed in Jersey City, New Jersey. Radio Maria now airs evening and overnight repeats of various daytime programs aired for listeners who work dayshift hours. Prior to the studio opening, a public information session took place on August 29, 2006 at St. Charles Center in Carthagena, Ohio to introduce Radio Maria to local listeners and the northern portion of the Cincinnati archdiocese. The WHJM transmitter is located to the north in nearby Botkins...at the Microwave radio relay tower site (formerly used by AT&T; Long Lines) on West State Street (with the Hogg horn antennas removed prior to WHJM's 2006 sign-on.) The WHJM studio is located in the Hoying Profesional Building at the corner of Main and Fourth Streets..the intersection of Ohio State Routes 119 and 66 in downtown Minster. Radio Maria's AM station for Dayton/Springfield area According to a Springfield News-Sun story dated March 10, 2008, Radio Maria USA purchased WULM (the former WBLY) from Urban Light Ministries in Springfield, Ohio. The application for license transfer and purchase which took place on February 15, 2008 was granted FCC approval on April 16, 2008. The AM station acquisition now brings Radio Maria programming to Springfield, Dayton, Tipp City, Troy, Urbana and other communities in the Miami Valley not reached by WHJM's signal. WULM's signal also has the potential to reach east towards Columbus and west towards Richmond, Indiana along U.S. 40 and I-70. Radio Maria programming on WULM commenced on Saturday, May 31, 2008 at 12 noon local time. The WULM studio (formerly located at WIZE's transmitter site and now-vacated studio on Miracle Mile Road) is now located at the Father Boyle Center (the former parish convent) on Lagonda Avenue next to St. Bernard Parish east of downtown Springfield. Radio Maria now offers its audiostreaming though the iPhone, BlackBerry and Android mobile phone devices in addition to its own World Family Smartphone app and the TuneIn app for listeners outside of WHJM and WULM's signal area in addition to the Amazon Alexa device which can be accessed by the vocal command: \\"Alexa...Open Radio Maria.\\" hence Radio Maria USA now has nationwide coverage outside the signal areas of its terresstrial stations. Mary Pyper, (presenter of \\"Marian Apparitions\\" and past National President) is currently the National Board Treasurer of Radio Maria USA. Jim Linthicum is local voiceover/audio production technician. Cletus Prenger is Minster studio technician. Ernestine Miller (1923‚Äì2013) (formerly with WERM, now WFGF) served as Minster studio and office public relations representative, Greg Oen associate recording and remote broadcast technician, Nick Hoying associate remote broadcast technician and Jim Boeckman (1941-2019) was volunteer in charge of promotion and publicity before his passing.

It merged with the Bureau of Navigation in 1932 to form the Bureau of Navigation and Steamboat Inspection which, in 1936, was reorganized into the Bureau of Marine Inspection and Navigation, which in turn came under the control of the United States Coast Guard in 1942 and was abolished, with its functions transferred to the Coast Guard, in 1946. Act of 1838 The safety inspection of merchant vessels documented under the flag of the United States has been authorized in varying degrees by Congress and required by law since 1838. In the early days, the United States Congress hesitated to pass adequate safety laws for fear of interfering with the growing and economically important steamboat industry. The beginning and development of a federal maritime safety program arose from disasters that caused much death, injury and property loss; experience showed the greatest casualties were caused by boiler explosions and by fire aboard ship. As the steamboat industry grew, so did the general publics awareness of the need for marine safety laws. The publics growing concern over these maritime accidents prompted Congress to begin to act to protect the public, beginning with passing a law on July 7, 1838, to \\"provide better security of the lives of passengers on board of vessels propelled in whole or in part by steam\\" (5 Stat. L., 304). The law required owners or masters of vessels propelled in whole or in part by steam to obtain two certificates from appointed inspectors and provide one certificate to a customs official (surveyor or collector) to obtain a license and to be registered. The inspectors were to be chosen and sworn to their duty by the district court judge. Inspections were required to be repeated every 12 or 6 months as outlined in the law. Captain Edward Tripp, who had introduced steamboating to Baltimore, Maryland, in 1813 with the building of the steamboat Chesapeake, was the first Baltimore hull inspector and was appointed by a federal district judge to perform the safety inspection on the few vessels in Baltimore. Captain Tripp performed these duties between 1838 and 1852. At that time, the law provided a US$5.00 fee for each inspection to be paid by the vessels owner.  Steamboat Act of August 30, 1852  The 1838 law proved inadequate as steamboat disasters increased in volume and severity. The period from 1847 to 1852 was marked by an unusual series of disasters primarily caused by boiler explosions; however, many were also caused by fires and collisions. These disasters resulted in the passage of the Steamboat Act of August 30, 1852 (10 Stat. L., 1852) in which enforcement powers were placed under the United States Department of the Treasury, rather than under the United States Department of Justice as with the Act of 1838. The important features of the Steamboat Act were the requirement for hydrostatic testing of boilers and the requirement for a boiler steam safety valve. The act further required that both pilots and engineers be licensed by the local inspectors. Under the Steamboat Act, the organization and form of a federal maritime inspection service began to emerge. Nine supervisory inspectors, each responsible for a specific geographic region, were appointed. There were also provisions for the appointment of local inspectors by a commission consisting of the local district collector of customs, the supervisory inspector, and the district judge. Time and further insight proved the Steamboat Act inadequate. Probably its most serious shortcoming was the exemption of freightboats, ferries, tugboats, and towboats, which continued to operate under the superficial inspection requirements of the Act of 1838. However, the Steamboat Act was the beginning of legislation that would lead a federal inspection service.  Act of February 28, 1871, and the creation of the Steamboat Inspection Service  Continued disasters and high loss of life again prompted congressional action through the passage of the Act of February 28, 1871. This new law applied to all steam vessels and sought to protect their crews as well as their passengers. It retained the useful functions of the Act of 1838 and the Steamboat Act and added new requirements that provided a comprehensive Marine Safety Code, which forms the basis of the present marine safety code. The Act of 1871 created the Steamboat Inspection Service. Furthermore, it established a Supervisory Inspector General directly responsible to the United States Secretary of the Treasury, extended licensing requirements to all masters and chief mates, provided for the revocation of licenses, authorized periodic inspection, and gave the Board of Supervisory Inspectors the authority to prescribe nautical rules of the road. Transfers and reorganization On February 14, 1903, congressional action transferred the Steamboat Inspection Service to the newly created United States Department of Commerce and Labor. When that department was split in 1913, the service came under the control of the new United States Department of Commerce. On June 30, 1932, Congress passed a law (47 Stat. L., 415) under which the Steamboat Inspection Service lost its independent identity and was merged with the Bureau of Navigation, which had been created in 1884 to oversee the regulation of merchant seamen. The merger formed the new Bureau of Navigation and Steamboat Inspection. The new organization remained within the Department of Commerce.  Act of May 27, 1936 (Public Law 622)  The fire off the coast of New Jersey in 1934, which killed 124 people, paved the way for the Act of May 27, 1936. The law, known as Public Law 622, reorganized the Bureau of Navigation and Steamboat Inspection and renamed it the Bureau of Marine Inspection and Navigation (49 Stat. L., 1380). The Bureau remained under Department of Commerce control. Public Law 622 also required structural fire protection on passenger vessels and required plans for passenger vessels be approved by the Bureau prior to any vessels construction.  Motorboat Act of 1940  The Motorboat Act of 1940 was enacted to cover safety requirements for every vessel propelled by machinery and not more than 65 feet (19.8 meters) in length, with the exception of tugboats and towboats of this length propelled by steam, which were covered under other laws. In addition to covering safety equipment, running lights, and reckless or negligent operations, this law gave the Bureau of Marine Inspection and Navigation the authority to examine the operators of these boats and issue licenses provided they carried passengers for hire.  Executive Order 9083  After the United States entered World War II, President Franklin D. Roosevelt as a wartime measure signed Executive Order 9083 on February 28, 1942. It transferred the Bureau of Marine Inspection and Navigations inspection duties, amoing other things, temporarily to the control of the United States Coast Guard.  Reorganization Plan Number 3  On July 16, 1946, Reorganization Plan Number 3 abolished the Bureau of Marine Inspection and Navigation and transferred all of its functions permanently to the U.S. Coast Guard. This marked the first time in the nations history that all functions of maritime safety came under one agency.  Marine safety under the Coast Guard  The Marine Safety program is still administered by the Coast Guard, an agency originally under the control of the United States Department of the Treasury, later under the control of the United States Department of Transportation, and now under the control of the United States Department of Homeland Security. In an attempt to promote better service to the maritime industry as well as the general public, the marine inspection and Captain of the Port/port safety functions were combined. The marine inspectors of the Coast Guard come from varying backgrounds and careers. Among the officers in the program, some are graduates of the United States Coast Guard Academy, some are graduates of the various maritime academies, and some are prior civilians that attended Officer Candidate School. Many of the officers in this field, including all of the chief warrant officers in the field, are prior-enlisted Coast Guardsmen who have progressed through the enlisted ranks and earned commissions. Due to an increase in small boat accidents, the Small Passenger Vessel Act of May 10, 1956, was passed into law. The requirements of this act became effective on June 1, 1958, and provided that all vessels, regardless of size or propulsion, carrying more than six passengers for hire, be inspected by a Marine Inspector of the Coast Guard, and meet associated safety requirements. These requirements not only cover life saving and fire fighting equipment, but also machinery and electrical installations, hull strength and stability considerations. This law required that operators be licensed by the Coast Guard and minimum manning requirements be met. Additionally, the route or routes on which the vessel may operate and the maximum number of passengers that may be carried are established by the Coast Guard.

A few women were involved in Freemasonry before the 18th century; however the first printed constitutions of the Premier Grand Lodge of England appeared to bar them from the Craft forever. The French Lodges of Adoption which spread through Continental Europe during the second half of the 18th century admitted Masons and their female relatives to a system of degrees parallel, but unrelated to the original rite. In the early 20th century, these were revived as women-only lodges and later they adopted male degrees giving rise to French women's Masonry in the 1950s. 18th-century British lodges and their American offshoots remained male only. In the late 1800s, rites similar to adoption emerged in the United States, allowing masons and their female relatives to participate in ritual together. These bodies, however, were more careful to discriminate between the mixed ritual and the genuine Freemasonry of the men. In the 1890s, mixed lodges following a standard Masonic ritual started to appear in France, and quickly spread to other countries. Women-only jurisdictions appeared soon afterwards. As a general rule, the admission of women is now recognised in Continental (Grand Orient) jurisdictions. In Anglo-American Freemasonry, neither mixed nor all-female lodges are officially recognised, although unofficial relations can be cordial, with premises sometimes shared.  Women as operative masons  The mythical Sabina von Steinbach Women in Medieval and Renaissance Europe were legally assumed to be subject to their fathers, then to their husbands after marriage. The status of women within Medieval trades was largely dependent on the local interpretation of femme sole, the legal term for a single woman. This was usually the widow of a tradesman, who was permitted to continue her husband's business after his death, and often established in the rights and privileges of his trade guild or company. More rarely, single women would achieve success in their father's trade. Exceptions occurred mainly in trades linked to traditional women's occupations, such as haberdashery and needlecraft.Antonia Frazer, The Weaker Vessel, Mandarin paperbacks, 1989, pp. 108‚Äì109 In Norwich, a woman called Gunnilda is listed as a mason in the Calendar for Close Rolls for 1256.Freemason Information gives p366 in the 1902 edition in a review of Karen Kidd, A Short(er) History of Early Women Freemasons, retrieved 19 March 2013 It is reputed that Sabina von Steinbach, the daughter of the architect, worked on Strasbourg Cathedral in the early part of the 14th century, although the first reference to her work comes 300 years later. In England, hints of female participation appear in the Regius Manuscript (ca. 1390‚Äì1425), and in the Guild records at York Minster in 1408. Women were employed in administrative roles in the London Mason's Company, and as such received the benefits of membership. Also, the charge in York Manuscript No 4, dated 1693 and used as a warrant by the later Grand Lodge of All England at York, contains the phrase \\"hee or shee that is to be made mason\\". While a number of masonic historians have categorised this as a \\"misprint\\", Adolphus Frederick Alexander Woodford, who studied and catalogued these documents, considered it genuine.Honourable Fraternity of Ancient Freemasons \\"Women as Operative Masons\\", quoting from Enid L. Scott, Women in Freemasonry, 1988, retrieved 3 March 2013 In the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries, the status of women amongst masons in Britain is likely to be similar to that codified in the minutes of the lodge at St. Mary's Chapel in Edinburgh. A burgess could pay for the Freedom to employ and instruct masons. The widow of a master mason could accept commissions from his old clients, provided that she employed a journeyman of the lodge to supervise the work.David Murray Lyon, History of the lodge of Edinburgh, Blackwood, Edinburgh, 1873, pp. 121‚Äì123 Lodges of Adoption Admission of a young lady into a Lodge of Adoption As the Freemasonry of the Premier Grand Lodge of England spread in France, the French fraternity stayed within the letter of Anderson's proscription of women, but saw no reason to ban them from their banquets or their religious services. During the 1740s, lodges of adoption began to appear. Attached to a regular (men only) lodge, wives and female relatives of the masons would be admitted to a parallel system of degrees, with a similar moral undertone to the authentic rite of the lodge. The earliest had a nautical theme. In 1747, the Chevalier Beauchaine began the Order of Woodcutters (Ordre des Fendeurs), with rites supposedly based on an early version of the Carbonari. In 1774, the lodges of adoption came under the jurisdiction of the Grand Orient de France, and the published regulations show a system of four degrees:ADOPTIVE FREEMASONRY Entry from Mackey's Lexicon of Freemasonry # Apprentie, or Female Apprentice. # Compagnonne, or Journeywoman. # Ma√Ætresse, or Mistress. # Parfaite Ma√ßonne, or Perfect Masoness. Further degrees came and went, with a ten-degree system evolving at the end of the Eighteenth century. The idea spread widely in Europe, but never appeared in England. After a brief eclipse during the Reign of Terror at the start of the French Revolution, lodges of adoption flourished, with the Empress Josephine presiding over one in Strasbourg in 1805. In 1808, the Grand Orient decided that these lodges were unconstitutional, and they became marginalised until re-activated by the same Grand Orient in 1901.

There are several concordant bodies in the United States which admit the wives and female relatives of Freemasons. The Dutch Order of Weavers admits only the wives, while in the American orders the men and women share in the ritual.

Cagliostro claimed that he was re-introducing true Freemasonry, and he attempted to attract candidates wherever he went. Male candidates were already Freemasons, but women were also admitted. The ceremony for the two sexes differed only in minor points - males were admitted by Cagliostro (the Grand Copht) and females by his wife (the Queen of Sheba).

Female Masons in \\"masculine only\\" Masonic bodies  Elizabeth Aldworth in Masonic regalia, from a mezzotint of 1811 There have been a few reported cases of a woman joining a \\"masculine only\\" masonic lodge. These cases are exceptions and are debated by masonic historians.  Elizabeth Aldworth  One account of a woman being admitted to Freemasonry in the 18th century is the case of Elizabeth Aldworth (born St Leger), who is reported to have surreptitiously viewed the proceedings of a Lodge meeting held at Doneraile House, the private house of her father, first Viscount Doneraile, a resident of Doneraile, County Cork, Ireland. Upon discovering the breach of their secrecy, the Lodge resolved to admit and obligate her, and thereafter she proudly appeared in public in Masonic clothing. Speculative attempts to link the lodge of her initiation with a documented lodge of the Grand Lodge of Ireland have proved futile, but there is no reason that her father should not have instituted a lodge in his home, and the authenticity of her initiation is generally accepted.The Hon.

She is said to have been the wife of \\"General de Xaintrailles\\", probably Charles Antoine Dominique Xaintrailles.Masonic Dictionary Entry from Mackey's Encyclopedia of Freemasonry, retrieved 21 March 2013Karen Kidd, Haunted Chambers: the Lives of Early Women Freemasons, Cornerstone, 2009, pp66-70 Countess Helene/Ilona Hadik-Bark√≥czy de Szala Helene/Ilona Hadik-Bark√≥czy Countess Bark√≥czy (1833 - 1887) became fascinated by her grand- uncle's books on Freemasonry, browsing through his library after his death. By this time, she was married to Count Bela Hadik, Emperor Maximilian's aide-de- camp. The Countess' request for initiation into a Masonic lodge was supported by the Johannite Grand Master Ferenc Pulszky, and she was duly initiated in 1875 by a provincial lodge of Grand Orient, Lodge Egyenl≈ës√©g (Equality) in Unghv√°r. (In Hungary in that time there were two masonic Grand Lodges, the Grand Lodge of St. John and the Grand Orient worked independently from each other.) Her initiation was then declared void by decision of Grand Orient and the perpetrators were punished, but the lodge wasn't erased, and only one officer was excluded. The countess defended her request and argued its validity in common law. In her reasoning she brought up her knowledge of freemasonry, her legal status as a son (praefectio) and the absence of any mention of candidates' gender in the constitution of the Grand Orient. The Orient, holding to Prussian law, considered the initiation null and void because the usual bureaucratic formalities were not adhered to.L√°szl√≥ V√°ri, Hadik-Bark√≥czy Ilona √©s a szabadk≈ëm≈±vesek (Helene Hadik-Bark√≥czy and the Freemasons), AETAS - Journal of history and related disciplines (3/2012), p. 49-62., onlineL√°szl√≥ V√°ri, The Curious Case of Helene Hadik-Bark√≥czy with the Freemasons The next year, after debating her status, the Grand Orient demanded the return of her certificate, but she never complied.

She had, according to some, learned the secrets of masonry by hiding in the lodge room in her uncle's house, and was made a mason in order to pledge her to secrecy. She served on the board of trustees of her temple, and took higher degrees, as well as joining the Order of the Eastern Star.Library of Congress Indian chieftain., 30 June 1892, Image 4, retrieved 21 March 2013 The theme of a young woman hiding in a lodge room had become a standard formula for this type of report, which was uncritically echoed and embellished as it spread from newspaper to newspaper. Anderson herself denied that it was possible for a woman to be made a mason, but remained non- committal or downright enigmatic when questioned as to the origin of her extensive knowledge of Freemasonry. Born in Alsace in 1818, she was raised in Paris after her parents died by her uncle, a \\"prominent mason\\". She met and married Captain Andrew Anderson in the 1840s, and settled in New Orleans, accompanying her husband on his coastal voyages in their own vessel, and managing their finances. They moved to Oakland, California, in 1854, where Andrew became a respected businessman and an active mason. He died in 1867, leaving Salome a wealthy widow, who turned her fortune to helping masonic charities. She became the founding treasurer of Oak Leaf Chapter No 8 of the Order of the Eastern Star, and when a Masonic Temple was built, she became the largest stock-holder. In spite of opposition, she was elected to the board of trustees. In 1892, the Trestle Board published a biography of her as a prominent citizen and implied that she had acquired some degree of masonic knowledge from the masons meeting at the house of her uncle. The San Francisco News-Letter and Advertiser then embellished the story by saying that she \\"claimed to be a mason\\", having cajoled the younger members of her uncle's lodge into clandestinely conferring the three Blue Lodge degrees on her. This story was rapidly picked up by the West Coast press, and various versions of the story were passed around. While she strenuously denied that she had come by her knowledge in an improper way, in subsequent interviews she refused to be drawn on the source of her masonic knowledge.

Hailed as the only female mason in the United States, she is said to have obtained the secrets at the age of 16 by hiding in her uncles' lodge room in Princess, Kentucky. Having lost her father at an early age, she spent much of her childhood at her grandfather's house, where she became a favourite of her uncles. They attended a lodge in an unused chapel above Catherine's school-room, which she often helped them clean. As a teenager, Catherine Sweet (Babington being her married name) attended lodge meetings for a year, hiding in the old pulpit, finally being discovered when one of her uncles returned unexpectedly for a rifle he had left in the ante- room. Being questioned by the lodge, it was discovered that she had committed much of the ritual to memory, and was, like Anderson, made a mason to swear her to secrecy, but in this instance not admitted to membership of the lodge. The sole source of the story is her son, and much of the detail remains unconfirmed. There is no account or recollection of such a lodge room in or around Princess.Grand Lodge of North Carolina James Heath Davis, Was Catherine (Sweet) Babington A Mason?, NOCALORE (North Carolina Lodge of Research), Volume 3-Part 3-1933, pp 75-83, retrieved 22 March 2013Karen Kidd, Haunted Chambers: the Lives of Early Women Freemasons, Cornerstone, 2009, pp81-105  Co-Freemasonry: Freemasonry for men and women  Maria Deraismes Annie Besant in Masonic regalia On 14 January 1882, Maria Deraismes was initiated into Freemasonry in Loge Libre Penseurs (Freethinkers Lodge), in Le Pecq, just outside Paris. Deraismes was a well known writer and campaigner for democracy, women's rights, and the separation of church and state. Her lodge, on 9 January, had seceded from la Grande Loge Symbolique Ecossaise in order to initiate her. She then resigned, to enable her lodge to rejoin their previous jurisdiction. She did, however, persist in her efforts to legitimately become a mason, with the assistance of Doctor Georges Martin, a fellow campaigner for women's rights, and a Freemason. After a decade of trying they started to form their own lodge, and between 1 June 1892 and 4 March 1893, assembled 16 women who wished to become masons. They were initiated as Apprentices on 14 March 1893, Companions on 24 March, and Master Masons on 1 April. This done, on 4 April the now mixed lodge of male and female masons proceeded to elect its officers and constitute itself as La Grande Loge Symbolique Ecossaise de France, Le Droit Humain, soon to become l‚ÄôOrdre Ma√ßonnique Mixte International Le Droit Humain. This would flourish as international co-masonry, which Deraismes never lived to see. She died the following February.Droit Humain Maria Deraismes (1828 - 1894), retrieved 5 March 2013.

Male masons were sent into other jurisdictions to acquire the necessary ritual. In 1899, ten masons in the Droit Humain received the 33rd degree, allowing them to form a Supreme Council. Lodges had opened in Paris, Blois, Lyon, Rouen, and Z√ºrich. By 1914, the movement had spread to Britain, the Far East, the United States, Belgium, and the Netherlands.Droit Humain Histoire du Droit Humain, retrieved 8 March 2013 Co-Freemasonry was brought to the English-speaking world by the socialist and theosophist Annie Besant. Passing through the usual three degrees of craft masonry in 1902, she founded the Lodge of Human Duty No. 6 in London that same year. French-speaking lodges started to appear in the United States in 1903, but it was again Besant who opened the first English speaking lodge, in 1908. The French lodges took their lead from the Grand Orient de France in not requiring any religious belief in their members. Besant, with the blessing of Paris, followed the lead of the United Grand Lodge of England in requiring initiates to believe in a supreme being. Craft degrees in English speaking lodges took on a less continental, and more mystical flavour, with Besant importing the Dharma, or Besant Leadbeater ritual to both Britain and the United States.Phoenix Masonry Jeanne Heaslewood, A Brief History of the Founding of Co-Freemasonry, 1999, retrieved 8 March 2013 Modern Co-Freemasonry is divided into self-governing Federations, Jurisdictions, and pioneer lodges, bound to an International Constitution and a Supreme Council, which delegates elect at an international convention every five years.

It currently has 28,000 members spread through 60 countries and five continents.Droit Humain Foreword to main web-site, retrieved 8 March 2013  Exclusive women's lodges  A women's lodge existed in Boston during the last quarter of the eighteenth century. Hannah Mather Crocker, in an apology for Freemasonry written in 1815, claims to have presided over such a lodge, yet her description, \\"founded on the original principles of true ancient masonry, as far as was consistent with the female character\\" leaves the actual constitution open to question. It is also clear that St. Anne's lodge was extinct at the time of her writing about it. H. M.

As Co-Freemasonry spread in England from 1902, some members became alarmed by decisions taken by the governing body in Paris. There was a perceived threat to the ancient form of masonic ritual. Resignations resulted, in 1908, in the formation of a new Grand Lodge, which became the Honourable Fraternity of Antient Masonry, under a clergyman, the Rev. Dr. William Frederick Cobb, as Grand Master. His retirement after four years led to the election of a female Grand Master. Reverting to the original legal meaning of Brotherhood, the members have addressed each other as Brother since 1908. A further split occurred in 1913, when those wishing to include higher degrees, specifically the Royal Arch, left to form the Honourable Fraternity of Ancient Freemasons. Both societies are now exclusively female. The Honourable Fraternity of Antient Masonry restricted initiation to women and stopped admitting male visitors. The last male member left in 1935. The older society, having started working higher degrees, changed its name in 1958, appending the Order of Women Freemasons, as they are known today. Both bodies have lodges throughout the United Kingdom, and the Order of Women Freemasons also has lodges in Australasia, Zimbabwe, and Spain.Honourable Fraternity of Ancient Freemasons Our History, mainly taken from Enid L.

However, the UGLE has stated since 1999 that two English women's jurisdictions (The Order of Women Freemasons and The Honourable Fraternity of Ancient Freemasons) are regular in practice except for their inclusion of women, and has indicated that, while not formally recognized, these bodies may be regarded as part of Freemasonry when describing Freemasonry in general.UGLE FAQ retrieved 8 March 2013Honourable Fraternity of Ancient Freemasons Text of UGLE statement, retrieved 12 August 2012 In North America, neither \\"mainstream\\" Freemasonry nor Prince Hall Freemasonry accept women, but rather have associated separate bodies, some of which are mentioned above, which are \\"Masonic\\" in character, but not Masonic in their content.Prince Hall Grand Lodge of Missouri Prince Hall Masonry and Women, retrieved 24 March 2013 These bodies, together with co-freemasonry, remain anathema to UGLE.

Allschwil is a seamless suburb of Basel and is located between Basel to the east and Alsace in France to the west. The official language of Allschwil is (the Swiss variety of Standard) German, but the main spoken language is the local variant of the Alemannic Swiss German dialect. History The modern municipality of Allschwil is first mentioned in 1118 as Almswilre. Prehistoric Allschwil The region around Allschwil has been occupied since at least the Middle Paleolithic. Archeological finds from the municipality include a few scattered Middle Paleolithic items, cups from the Glockenbecherkultur (c. 2400‚Äì1800 BC), a mid- Bronze Age hoard (presumably a metal depot) and a Hallstatt culture settlement at in den Vogelg√§rten. In 1937, at New-Allschwil, a Gallo-Roman cremation cemetery (from c. AD 25‚Äì60) was discovered. It is one of the oldest in northern Switzerland. It is possible that the Roman road station Arialbinum (mentioned in \\"Antonine Itinerary\\" and \\"Tabula Peutingeriana\\") may correspond to Allschwil. Medieval town Allschwil was part of the Herrschaft of Birseck, which was given in 1004 as an imperial donation to the Bishop of Basel. Through the middle of the 15th century the Herrschaft was often pawned and sold. The town of Allschwil was located along the Alsace-Solothurn via Passwang pass trading route along the border. Its location on the border and trade route allowed Allschwil to grow into an important customs facility. After 1724 it housed the northern salt warehouse of the vogtei of the diocese of Basel. Allschwil was one of the seven so-called free villages (Vagantes extra civitate Basiliensem) and was therefore under the parish of St. John's Chapel at Basel's cathedral for baptism and high church festivals. In the wake of the German Peasants' War Allschwil, together with Reinach, Therwil, Oberwil and Ettingen, joined Basel in 1525 with a Burgrecht agreement. This agreement was dissolved in 1585 in the Baden Agreement. In 1529 the village embraced the Protestant Reformation and converted to the new faith. Nearly a hundred years later, in 1627, the Bishop of Basel succeeded in spreading the Counter- Reformation to Allschwil. After 1567 there was a Jewish settlement in Allschwil. In 1692 there were 24 Jewish families living in the Judeng√§sslein (from ) and they made up about 15% of the population. They had their own cemetery in Zwingen and a funeral right in Hegenheim. Children of Jews and Christians attended the 17th-century school together. Accusations of horse theft and Jewish plans to build a synagogue in Allschwil led to an expulsion decree in 1694 from the Bishop. Many of the Jews fled to Hegenheim. The village Church of St. Peter and Paul was built in the 12th century and was under the patronage of the Basel cathedral. The lower part of the church tower is from the 12th/13th century, but the rest of the church was totally rebuilt in 1698‚Äì99. The parish of Allschwil also included Sch√∂nbuch, H√©singue (now in France) and until 1611, H√©genheim (also in France). Early Modern Allschwil After the short-lived Rauracian Republic (1792‚Äì93), the village was under French rule from 1793 to 1814. Between 1793 and 1800 it was part of the D√©partement of Mont-Terrible and then in 1800-1814 it was part of the D√©partement of Haut-Rhin. Unlike most of the villages in the Birseck region, Allschwil reacted negatively to French rule, and even had a small rebellion in 1794. In 1815 Allschwil became part of the Canton of Basel and when the canton split in 1833, it became part of the new canton of Basel-Country. The split between Basel-City and Basel-Country led to shift in religious power in Allschwil. In 1877, the Roman Catholic Reverend Peter Wildman was voted out by the parishioners and was replaced by Johannes Schmid a Christian Catholic priest. The village church then became Christian Catholic. In 1878 the Swiss Reformed Church founded a parish in Allschwil. By 1970 about 54% of the inhabitants were Swiss Reformed, while 40% were Roman Catholic. Modern Allschwil Half Timbered house in the village center By 1860 the agricultural village of Allschwil was converting into an industrial town. Many of the inhabitants were working in factories in Basel. The farmers were mostly growing grain and vegetables, which they supplied to the nearby market of Basel. Allschwil was especially known for its white cabbage. Between 1897 and 1921, the cabbage was processed in a sauerkraut factory, which was built by the village agricultural collective. By the end of the 19th century hemp, flax and vineyards had all disappeared from the village. In 1955 there were 63 farms, while in 1965 it was down to 29, and in 1980 the number of farms had only slightly increased to 31. Until 1930 the industrial sector grew strongly in Allschwil (mainly brick, along with clothing, metal and machinery industry) and in 1910 about 73% of workers worked in industry. In the 1870s several brick factories opened in Allschwil, including Passavant-Iselin & Co. a company that had the first interlocking tile press in Switzerland. Passavant- Iselin & Co. remained in operation until they closed in 1975. The lack of railway connection (the 1926 proposed rail freight terminal was never realized) prevented a greater industrial development. In addition, with the rise of Rhine shipping, Allschwil lost its importance as customs station. A tram line to Basel opened in 1905. By 1910 about 40% of the working population commuted out of Allschwil for work, by 1990 this had increased to 79%. Today, Allschwil is focused on light industry including industrial metals, paper industry and chemistry. In 1990, 35% of workers were in the industrial sector and 54% were in the services sector. Allschwil experienced a massive population growth between 1850 and 1970 thanks to immigration from Basel. In 1930 it was the most populous municipality outside Basel, and suffered typical infrastructure problems. Since 1970, the growth has stagnated. The center of the town has retained its village-like appearance. This is reinforced by the restoration of the mid-19th-century half timbered houses, which were given an award in 1976 from the Council of Europe, and another in 1980 for their village center planning. A town history museum opened in 1968 and in 1977 the Allschwiler market was established.

The municipality is located in the Arlesheim district, on the edge of the Sundgauer Hill Country along the Upper Rhine valley. Allschwil is a suburb of Basel on the west and has the border with France on two sides. The neighboring municipalities in Switzerland are, besides Basel, Sch√∂nenbuch, Oberwil, and Binningen, and the French communes of Neuwiller, Buschwiller, H√©genheim, and Saint-Louis. The landscape is typical of the Rhine valley, where the Rhine turns from flowing west through hilly country where it forms the border between Switzerland and Germany to the wide plain where it flows north and forms the border between France and Germany.

Its cathedral chapter seat, bishop's residence and cathedral (1681 / 1761) are listed as a heritage site of national significance.Swiss inventory of cultural property of national and regional significance (1995), p. 65. The official language of Arlesheim is (the Swiss variety of Standard) German, while the main spoken language is the local variant of the Alemannic Swiss German dialect. The cathedral has a Baroque organ built by the German builder Johann Andreas Silbermann, based in Alsace, in 1761. The instrument was restored by Metzler in 1959‚Äì1962, and is an example of the fusion of French and German organ building styles. It has been used in several recordings, including Lionel Rogg's recording of the complete organ works of J. S. Bach, for Harmonia Mundi France in 1970. History Arlesheim is first mentioned in 708. In 1239 it was mentioned as Arlisheim. Prehistoric settlements The protected location on the western foot of the Gempen Plateau encouraged early settlement of the area. Paleolithic Magdalenian culture items from around 10,000BC were discovered in the Birseck‚ÄìErmitage and Hollenberg3 caves. Birseck‚ÄìErmitage was discovered in 1910 by Fritz Sartorius-Preiswerk, and Hollenberg3 was discovered in 1950 by Martin Herkert. The caves contained traces of fires, spear points carved from reindeer antler, and pendants made from snail and mussel shells. From the end of the Palaeolithic era, Birseck‚ÄìErmitage cave contains galets colori, red- stripe-like painted limestone pebbles, and flint tools. From the Mesolithic period (6000‚Äì5000BC), flint tools have been discovered at the Abri overhang at Hohlefels, excavated in 1905 by Fritz Sarasin, and in the Birseck‚ÄìHermitage cave. Some funerary objects from the largely unexplored transitional period between the Mesolithic to Neolithic period (around 5200BC) were also discovered. Several Neolithic ax blades were discovered across the municipal area, with a concentration at Dachsenh√∂hle and Kleinen H√∂hle am Hohlefels that were excavated in 1952‚Äì1954 by Martin Herkert, Bernhard Hesse, and Andreas Schwabe. In the Kleinen H√∂hle, skeletal remains of children with grave goods as well as a typological flint spear points were also found. Horgen culture (around 3000BC) ceramic vessels have also been found. From the Bronze Age, only a few, mostly generic items have been discovered. So far, no items from the Iron Age have been found. Medieval settlement The farm complex of Arlesheim was owned by Mont Sainte-Odile Monastery in Alsace starting in the 8thcentury. It was sold in 1239 to the Bishop of Basel L√ºthold von R√∂tteln. In 1245 the Frohburg family withdrew their claims on the land, which left the Bishop with an uncontested title to the land. In 1273 he pledged the village to the Lords of Ramstein in exchange for a loan. The Bishops of Basel did not get the village back until 1435. After that Arlesheim belonged to the Bishop's Herrschaft of Birseck. The inhabitants were initially part of the parish of Pfeffingen. However, by 1341 they possessed a parish church and by 1396 their own pastor. This parish church, the church of St.Odilia, was rebuilt in the late 17thcentury and demolished in 1816. The Reformation to the Early Modern Period While Arlesheim was probably under the influence of Basel through the counts of Birseck, it never entered into a Burgrecht treaty with the city. Despite Arlesheim's loose connection with Basel, it converted to the new Protestant faith in 1528 when Basel converted. About half a century later, in 1582, the Bishop of Basel, Jakob Christoph Blarer von Wartensee, succeeded in spreading the Counter-Reformation in Arlesheim. In the Thirty Years War the surrounding countryside was damaged by looting and pillaging. Arlesheim, however, was off the main roads and was relatively untouched. It had developed as a small, rather out of the way wine-growing village with the Bishop's estates and wine-press. As a result, when the Basel cathedral council and priests moved from Freiburg im Breisgau in 1678, they went to Arlesheim. An administrative center and impressive early baroque residences were built in the town. Under the same artistic concept, and initially led by Franz Demess, the cathedral was built in 1679‚Äì1681. This was followed by the magnificent Domherrenh√§user which was built between 1680‚Äì1687. These new buildings made Arlesheim an attractive place for nobles, high clergy, diplomats, artists, and craftsmen. The court life of the canons also promoted indigenous craftsmen. In 1726 a mint opened in town. Then, in 1763 the seat of the Bailiwick of Birseck moved from Birseck Castle to the Andlauer Hof in Arlesheim. In 1785 Balbina vonAndlau and Canon Heinrich vonLigerz created the Eremitage (Hermitage), the largest English garden in Switzerland, which was known throughout Europe and attracted many travelers. The right to appoint Arlesheim's pastor was held by the Bishop of Basel until 1678, after which it went to the council of Basel's Cathedral. At the beginning of the 17thcentury the parish of Arlesheim was briefly united briefly with the parish of Reinach (in Basel-Country) into a single parish. French Revolution to Modern Arlesheim A tram in Arlesheim After the short-lived Rauracian Republic (1792‚Äì93), the village was under French rule from 1793 to 1814. Between 1793 and 1800 it was part of the D√©partement of Mont-Terrible and then in 1800‚Äì1814 it was part of the D√©partement of Haut-Rhin. Under the revolutionary forces, the Cathedral and the Domherrenh√§user were nationalized. Courageous citizens bought the cathedral and prevented it from being demolished. Later, the parish acquired the building and the cathedral became a parish church. In 1814-1815, it was the seat of the coalition Governor General of the diocese of Basel. In 1815 the Canton of Basel was recreated. Arlesheim was part of the Canton of Basel until it split into two half-cantons in 1832. Arlesheim joined Basel-Country and became the capital of a district. During the invasion of revolutionary France, the cathedral canons fled the city. The flight of the canons led to an economic depression in the village in the years following the French invasion. In 1830 Johann Siegmund Alioth moved from Basel to Arlesheim and set up the first mechanical silk-factory in Switzerland along the Birs. The factory operated for nearly a century and a half, until it closed in 1976. For his Reformed workers, Daniel August Alioth built a Reformed chapel in his garden in 1856. This Reformed church served the needs of just a few Reformed families throughout the entire Birseck. A Reformed parish was established in 1882 in Arlesheim. In 1875 the Jura‚ÄìSimplon Railway opened a line into Arlesheim, which was followed in 1902 by the Birseckbahn Basel-Arlesheim-Dornach tram line. In 1976 it was purchased by Baselland Transport. These two train lines gave further impetus to the industrial and service sectors including the Alioth electric equipment supply company in 1892, the anthroposophist Ita Wegman Clinic in 1921, and the Weleda remedies company. Arlesheim has a mild climate and sunny vineyards, which made it a popular location for vacation villas. In 1880 the first housing estate was built in New-Arlesheim. The many workers who moved into Arlesheim fostered a sectarian shift in what was once a very Catholic village. The construction of the Reformed church in 1911‚Äì1912 encouraged more Reformed workers to follow. In 1990 about 41% of the population was Catholic, while 38% were Reformed. After 1960 Arlesheim developed into a residential community for the agglomeration of Basel. In 1990 over two-thirds of the workers were commuters, and 77% of the jobs were in the services sector. The ensuing infrastructure problems, including overbuilding, led to a town planning ordinance of 1971 and redevelopment of the village square in 1987 and 1991.

Ricciardo Amadino (fl. 1572‚Äì1621) was a Venetian printer, specialising in music. Amadino briefly attempted to publish music on his own in 1579, but was unsuccessful. He joined with Giacomo Vincenti, with whom he published over 80 books between 1583 and 1586. Many of these were reprints of popular madrigal books, but some were first printings. Their partnership ended around 1586, but they continued to work together occasionally. After 1586, Amadino's mark was a woodcut of an organ, and he printed primarily music, with a few theoretical treatises, including the first edition of Ercole Bottrigari's Il desiderio. He printed editions of such important composers as Luca Marenzio and Claudio Monteverdi, and in terms of sheer output was one of the foremost Italian music printers.Bridges His Monteverdi publications include two celebrated first editions, the opera L'Orfeo (1609) and a church music collection in 1610 containing the Vespro della Beata Vergine and a mass.

They are now extinct but have mixed with people of Paraiba do Sul, though last original groups were last found in the lowlands of the Mato Grosso. Due to the disappearance of their society having occurred prior to the 20th century, they were still seen as \\"faithless, primitive half-man half-beasts,\\" in accordance to the Portuguese Empire's general view on indigenous peoples (already manifested in Africa), focused on ethnology rather than history.  Accounts and modern research  According to Brazilian journalist and UENF press secretary Fulvia D'Alessandri, the Puri were nomadic and inhabited the region of S√£o Paulo. By the 17th century, most if not all of the tribe's population traveled along the Para√≠ba do Sul river in order to escape the \\"entradas and bandeiras\\" that would make use of them for gold exploration. Eventually, they settled in the inner bay of Para√≠ba, between the rivers Pomba, Negro and Muria√©.Ci√™ncia UENF: Heran√ßa Ind√≠gena (in Portuguese). In a study called \\"Diversidade √©tnica dos ind√≠genas na bacia do baixo Para√≠ba do Sul. Representa√ß√µes constru√≠das a partir da Etnohist√≥ria e da Arqueologia\\" by historian Dr. Simonne Teixeira (also from UENF), the accounts of travelers and foreign naturalists from the 19th century are cited. When such accounts occurred, the Puri were already socially fragmented, due to the influences of colonization. Italian friars commanded two important settlements in the region, with which many Puri kept work relations: \\"S√£o Jos√© de Leonissa\\" (now S√£o Fid√©lis) and \\"Aldeia da Pedra\\" (now Itaocara). Even so, accounts such as that of Wied-Neuw and Burmeist, which had both been in the region during the 19th century, there were still nomadic Puri groups at the time, that carried only the absolutely necessary to survive in their harsh, dense vegetation environment. Puris nelle loro foreste (\\"Puris in Their Forest\\") by Italian Giulio Ferrario. Both the German naturalist Maximilian von Wied-Neuwied and Burmeist describe the nomadic Puri of the 19th century. Burmeist states that their huts were very light habitations, built of palm tree leaves and \\"resembling bird cages\\", while Wied-Neuw speaks of their simplicity and lack of attachment to structures and land, valuing only few tools. With the deforestation resulting from the extensive coffee plantations of the time, the nomadic peoples of Brazil lost much of their space, and many the remaining Puri were forced to work in the farms, as domestic workers and, especially, as lumberjacks for the clearing of the forest and carrying of wood through the river, forming a cheap workforce for landowners. There are accounts of misery among the Puri for the entire 19th century, as workers were severely underpaid (sometimes even receiving salary in tobacco, aguardiente and \\"colorful textiles\\"), and by the end of the century, they were considered as \\"extinct\\", leading to the belief that they were assimilated into Brazilian society over time, rather than being victim of the genocides proposed to other tribes (such as the Goitac√° people, said to have been decimated for not accepting Portuguese rule).

King (born 20 October 1928) is an American politician, community organizer, writer, and past Adjunct Professor at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT). King has been active in creating community programs and institutions for low-income people in Boston and is the founder and current director of the South End Technology Center. He and his wife, Joyce, married in 1951, are parents of six children. Early years King's mother, Ursula, was born in Guyana, and his father, Watts King, in Barbados. They met and married in Nova Scotia and immigrated to Boston in the early 1920s. King, born in 1928, in Hawaii, neighborhood, was one of eleven children, nine of whom survived past infancy. He graduated from Boston Technical High School in 1946 and from Claflin College in Orangeburg, South Carolina in 1950 with a B.S. degree in mathematics. In 1951, he received his M.A. degree in education from Boston State College and then taught math, first at Boston Trade High School and at his alma mater, Boston Technical High School. In 1953, King left the classroom to work with at risk youth, becoming Director of Boy's Work at Lincoln House, a settlement house in Boston's South End community. He continued his community work focusing on street corner gangs as Youth Director at United South End Settlements (USES). He also worked as a community activist and urban renewal and anti-poverty organizer. He was let go by USES when he promoted and supported neighborhood control versus USES and government control over the urban renewal and federal funds to assist poor people. (See the concept Community-driven development.) King was then rehired after protests from the community over his firing and was given the job as a community organizer. King then founded the Community Assembly for a United South End (C.A.U.S.E.), to give tenants and community residents a voice in their communities.Community Assembly for a United South End Political activism In 1967, King became the director of the New Urban League of Greater Boston.New Urban League of Greater Boston He brought job training for the unemployed and organized the community around public school, employment, and human services delivery issues. In 2003, King created The New Majority ‚Äì an organization and program uniting Boston's communities of color‚Äì Blacks, Hispanics, Asians, and Native Americans ‚Äì uniting them around candidates for elective office.The New Majority Boston Redevelopment Authority protests and Tent City In 1968 Mel King helped organize a sit-in at the Boston Redevelopment Authority (BRA) office on Thursday, April 25, 1968 in protest of a planned parking garage that was going to be built at the corner of Dartmouth and Columbus Streets in the South End, a site where housing had been leveled. The next morning, Mel King organized an occupation of the lot. While facing police retaliation, for the next three days between 100 and 400 people occupied the lot. They built tents and wooden shanties and put up a large sign welcoming the media and visitors to \\"Tent City.\\" Celtics legend Bill Russell, who owned a South End restaurant, provided food for the protestors. The story received extensive coverage in the local media. In honor of the demonstration, when a housing complex at that site was dedicated on April 30, 1988, it was named \\"Tent City.\\" Mel King told reporters that the key to the project was convincing ordinary Bostonians that they had to play a role in the development of their neighborhood. Political campaigns, endorsements, and parties King ran three times for a seat on the Boston School Committee in 1961, 1963, and 1965 ‚Äì being unsuccessful each time. In 1973, he was elected as a State Representative for the 9th Suffolk District and served in the Massachusetts Legislature until 1982. In 1983, when the incumbent Mayor of Boston, Kevin White, withdrew from contention after 16 years in office, Mel King ran for mayor, the first African-American to run in a final election bid for mayor of Boston, and ultimately against Raymond Flynn. Though King secured the African American vote by wide margins and significant support among other ethnic groups, King ultimately lost to Flynn, an Irish-Catholic with roots in South Boston. During the 2000 presidential election King endorsed the presidential campaign of Ralph NaderCitizens‚Äô Committee for Nader/LaDuke 2000 King founded the Rainbow Coalition Party in Massachusetts. In 2002, the Rainbow Coalition Party merged with the Massachusetts Green Party to become the Green-Rainbow Party, the Massachusetts affiliate of the Green Party of the United States. In 2002, King endorsed [Green-Rainbow Party] candidate Jill Stein for governor of Massachusetts, saying \\"Jill Stein is the only candidate who will speak truth to power...She's the only one that makes issues of racism and social justice integral parts of her campaign. King endorsed at-large city-councilor Sam Yoon for Mayor on August 10, 2009. King praised Yoon's vision, his collaborative approach and his focus on improving the educational system in Boston.\\"Mel King endorses Yoon for mayor\\", The Boston Globe, August 10, 2009 King remains active as a member of the Green-Rainbow Party.

This is a list of characters from the Nickelodeon animated television series.  Main characters  Tommy Thomas Malcolm Pickles (voiced by E. G. Daily) is the child of Stuart \\"Stu\\" Pickles and Diane \\"Didi\\" Pickles (nee Kropotkin) and serves as the series' protagonist. Many episodes take place in the Pickles family home and are centered around him and his family. In the series' pilot, \\"Tommy's First Birthday\\", he is a year old and presumably, he remains that age throughout the entirety of the show's run, despite hitting developmental milestones; he is the youngest of the babies until the birth of his brother, Dylan, in The Rugrats Movie (1998). Tommy is white, bald, and toothless (with the exception of \\"Weaning Tommy\\", in which he begins teething) and is most commonly seen wearing a light blue t-shirt and diaper with no shoes, unlike the other babies, who are typically fully dressed. As he is an infant, Tommy is often seen crawling but he is able to walk, albeit somewhat unsteadily and pigeon toed, and uses his diaper as a pocket, keeping his screwdriver in there among other things. Tommy is a brave child, with a strong sense of justice, always eager for an adventure and unafraid to stand up for what is right. His best friends are Chuckie and his dog Spike.  Chuckie  Charles Crandall Norbert Finster, Jr. (voiced by Christine Cavanaugh in 1991‚Äì2002, Nancy Cartwright in 2002‚Äì2008), more commonly referred to as Chuckie, is the child of Charles ‚ÄúChas‚Äù Finster, a bureaucrat, and his late spouse, Melinda Finster, and is Tommy‚Äôs best friend. Unlike Tommy, Chuckie is clumsy and timid; he rarely expresses any desire to go on one of the babies‚Äô adventures, instead listing all the reasons they shouldn‚Äôt go on one, and, whenever Angelica tries to bully them, he unquestionably accepts her treatment and gives into her demands, if she has any. Chuckie is two years old, making him the eldest of the babies, and so, he is the first of them to be toilet trained. He is white with curly red hair, purple-framed glasses, buckteeth, and freckles and wears a red and blue shirt with picture of Saturn on it, lime green and yellow shorts, yellow socks, and red sneakers with untied laces. In Rugrats in Paris: The Movie, Chuckie gains a step-mother, Kira Watanabe, who later adopts him, and a step-sister, Kimi. Phil and Lil Phillip Richard William DeVille and Lillian Marie Jill DeVille (both voiced by Kath Soucie) are the children of Howard DeVille and Elizabeth \\"Betty\\" DeVille. They live next door to Tommy and are fraternal twins, with Lil older than Phil by two minutes. Lil and Phil share many similarities, including a love of dirt, eating bugs, and playing with earthworms, and argue with one another frequently, calling each other by their full name whenever they do so. The two are white with brown hair and wear matching teal outfits with yellow ducks, though Phil's outfit has trousers while Lil's is a dress, and teal sneakers. Looking so much alike, they are often mistaken for one another by adults; the only notable facial difference between the two being that Phil's earlobes are attached while Lil's are not. Angelica Angelica Charlotte Pickles (voiced by Cheryl Chase) is the child of Andrew \\"Drew\\" Pickles and Charlotte Pickles, Stu and Didi's niece, and Tommy's cousin. Angelica serves as the series' antagonist, regularly threatening the babies physically or verbally and lying to them for her own amusement, with her actions sometimes crossing the line into cruelty. In her own home, Angelica reigns supreme as an only child, with her workaholic parents showering her with toys and admiration for simply existing, likely to make up for the fact that they are largely absent from her day-to-day life, and unsurprisingly, she is materialistic, devious, and self-centered. Without any parental guidance or boundaries, Angelica has largely been left to determine for herself what is right and wrong, with her idea of \\"right\\" normally being what she wants. Though she torments the babies, Angelica, on several occasions, stands up for them against others and expresses a genuine desire to be friends with them. Angelica is white with blonde hair, which is styled with purple bows into pigtails, and wears a purple dress with a red long-sleeved shirt, blue tights, red socks, and purple sneakers. Because of her age, Angelica is able to communicate with both babies and adults. Susie Susanna Yvonne Carmichael (voiced by Cree Summer, understudied by E. G. Daily) is the child of Randall \\"Randy\\" Carmichael, a screenwriter, and Dr. Lucille \\"Lucy\\" Carmichael, a physician, and Tommy's neighbor. Her family purchases a home on Tommy's street in \\"Meet The Carmichaels\\" and their mothers become close friends. Susie gets along well with the babies, despite the age difference, and considers them to be her friends; like them, she doesn't often get along with Angelica, though she makes a conscious effort to be nice to her. Like her mother, Susie excels in many aspects of her life and has a kind and warm demeanor, her only real character flaw being her competitiveness. She is black with black afro-textured hair, which is styled into three braids and decorated with red hair ties and clips, and wears a yellow and purple dress with white lace socks and red slippers.  Kimi  Kimiko Watanabe-Finster (voiced by Dionne Quan) is the child of Hiro Watanabe and Kira Watanabe- Finster and Chuckie's step-sister. Her mother marries Chuckie's father Chas in Rugrats in Paris: The Movie and he later adopts her, assuming the role of her father for all intents and purposes. Kimi is bold and fun-loving, meaning she gets along well with the other babies, especially Tommy, and protective of her older brother while, at the same time, encouraging him to stand up for himself. She is Japanese and has black hair, which is styled into three ponytails held together by red hair ties, with bangs and wears a yellow dress with a purple cat face on it, a pink t-shirt, and purple cowgirl boots. Dil Dylan Prescott Pickles (voiced by Tara Strong) is the child of Stuart \\"Stu\\" Pickles, an inventor, and Diane \\"Didi\\" Pickles (nee Kropotkin), a schoolteacher, and Tommy's younger brother. He is a newborn for much of the series, meaning he rarely partakes in adventures alongside the other babies, and is often seen drooling, crying, or babbling. Because of his young age, Dil cannot understand the babies and the babies can't understand him. Spike Spike (voiced by Michael Bell in a dream sequence in the episode \\"In the Dreamtime\\", Bruce Willis in Rugrats Go Wild): The Pickles' family dog. Though he appears in almost every episode of the series, he is not usually featured as a main part of episodes. Tommy claims him to be his best \\"animal\\" friend. The character is considered a main character in the series, appearing in almost three quarters of all of the episodes, though he usually does not come along when the Rugrats venture to new locations. It is mentioned that his breed is the fictional \\"Siberian Tiger Hound.\\" As shown in The Rugrats Movie and Rugrats Go Wild, Spike is very protective of the babies, as he sees them as his own. Adult characters * Stuart Louis \\"Stu\\" Pickles (voiced by Jack Riley as an adult, E. G. Daily as a baby): Tommy and Dil's easy-going father and brother of Drew. Absent-minded toy inventor who only wants to be a good provider for his family. Married to Didi Pickles. Birthday is October 23 according to the All Growed Up special. In each Rugrats film, either Stu's actions or inventions help sets the story in motion, and by story's end he somehow manages to save the day (particularly, in the first and third films). Chas' best friend since childhood, similar to Tommy and Chuckie's friendship. * Diane \\"Didi\\" Kropotkin Kerpackter-Pickles (voiced by Melanie Chartoff): Tommy and Dil's mother.

Lou would often bring up stories of his youth when it came to certain episodes. * Andrew \\"Drew\\" Pickles (voiced by Michael Bell as an adult, Pamela Adlon as a baby): Married to Charlotte, and is also Angelica's father and Stu's older brother. A well-paid investment banker (later accountant), Drew does not always get along with his brother, and the two often bicker over petty problems. His catchphrase (when addressing Angelica) is \\"Princess\\" and is not afraid to put his foot down whenever Angelica gets into trouble where he's usually the one to punish her like taking away her dessert for a week or other disciplinary actions. * Charlotte Pickles (voiced by Tress MacNeille): Angelica's workaholic mother, the CEO of her own company, and married to Drew. She tries to be a good mother, but is usually sidetracked by business interests.

It is a spoof of the Care Bears (though the name is more a play on Disney's Gummi Bears). Susie's father Randy Carmichael was a writer for the show, and in one episode, the babies are taken to a movie theater to see the Dummi Bears movie (they escape from their parents to go see the Reptar movie, and cause havoc in the movie theater). * Blocky and Oxwinkle (Blocky voiced by June Foray): Stu and Drew's favorite cartoon as babies. They are an obvious parody of Rocky and Bullwinkle. ** Yuri and Svetana (Svetana voiced by June Foray): A pair of villains who try to trick and get rid of Blocky and Oxwinkle, and calling them \\"Elk and Weasle\\". They are a parody of Boris and Natasha, and their nicknames for Blocky and Oxwinkle is a parody of \\"Moose and Squirrel\\". In an example of stunt casting, Foray, the original voice of Rocky as well as of Natasha, provided the voice of their Rugrats universe counterparts. * Alan Quebec (voiced by Alex Trebek): He hosted \\"Super Stumpers,\\" the fictitious game show on which Didi Pickles appears in the episode \\"Game Show Didi.\\" * The Mega Hyper Heroes: The superheroes that the babies watch on TV. The babies imitated the characters by calling themselves the \\"Mega Diaper Babies\\". They only appeared in the episode \\"Mega Diaper Babies\\" and appear to be based on the Fantastic Four. When four teenagers join their rings together, they become the Mega Hyper Heroes where they work to save Earth and the universe from various villains who would do something like hog the world's oxygen supply, drain the oceans, or blow up the universe. ** Changeling (voiced by Neil Ross): Johnny is the leader of the Mega Hyper Heroes. When he becomes Changeling, he can turn into any animal. ** Miss Invisible (voiced by Kath Soucie): Diane is a member of the Mega Hyper Heroes. When she becomes Miss Invisible, she gains the power of invisibility. In addition, she also has her own plane that she flies. ** Flaro (voiced by Gregg Berger): Marco is a member of the Mega Hyper Heroes. When he becames Flamo, he can ignite himself on fire with a flick of his wrist. ** Bolt (voiced by Jim Turner): Ricky is a member of the Mega Hyper Heroes. When he becomes the Bolt, he turns into an 8 ft. purple-skinned man who has the combined strength of two strong men. * Metallitron (voiced by Gregg Berger): A giant robotic enemy of the Mega Hyper Heroes. Even though Metallitron has a male voice, the character is identified as a female. Metallitron is liked by Angelica. * The Mole People: Reptar's archenemies. * Goober The Gopher: A friendly, hug-loving character created by Lipschitz Industries as a friendly children's icon resembling Barney The Dinosaur. In one episode, the grownups got rid of the Reptar decor in the babies' room figuring it scared Dil and replaced it with Goober the Gopher. This led the babies to get Reptar and Goober to fight for who should be the better mascot. Real people * Chick Hearn (voiced by himself): Appeared in the episode \\"Touchdown Tommy\\" as the sports anchor of a football game;. * Pat Sajak (voiced by himself): Appeared in the episode \\"Chuckie is Rich\\" as the host of a Publishers Clearing House-like contest, where the grand prize was $10 million and was won by Chas Finster.

Marvel Comics produced a six-issue limited series written by Bert B Hubbard and Dwight D Coye, and illustrated by Robert Walker and Jon Holdredge, where Meteor Man met Spider-Man and Night Thrasher. The fictional superhero was created by director/actor/writer, Robert Townsend. This comic should not be confused with the Spider-Man villain Looter who later went by the name. Fictional character biography The Meteor Man is a formerly cowardly schoolteacher named Jefferson Reed living in Washington D.C. where his neighborhood was terrorized by a gang called the Golden Lords who are allied with a drug lord named Anthony Byers. One day, he witnessed a robbery by two kids who were trying to join the Golden Lords. After hiding in a dumpster to evade the pursuing members, he emerges and is struck by a chunk of green meteor that grants him superpowers. He eventually uses his new-found powers (with the help of the fed-up residents) to clean up the neighborhood and put the Golden Lords out of business. However, the Golden Lords' leader Simon Cain has also been exposed to the same meteor. Both men try to avoid getting drained of their powers and need constant exposure to a meteor fragment or they will lose their powers. Jefferson absorbed the energies in Simon and defeated them. When Simon was defeated, Anthony and his men show up to finish the job as the Bloods and the Crips come to Meteor Man's side. Anthony and his men plan to \\"take a vacation in the Bahamas.\\" Just then, the police arrive and arrest the bad guys. In an effort to gain a constant supply, Simon Cain has volunteered himself for study to a secret government facility, and one storyline had Jefferson Reed going to Arizona as it is rumored that a larger hunk of the same meteor had landed near the Grand Canyon. Powers and abilities The meteor that struck Jefferson Reed gave him superpowers that ranged from superhuman strength, speed and hearing, healing powers, flight, x-ray/laser vision, invulnerability, telekinesis, super breath, weather manipulation and the ability to communicate with dogs and imbue fertility. When Meteor Man touches a book, he can temporarily absorb the contents of the book and use it for 30 seconds. Weaknesses The one weakness to Meteor Man is that his powers are easily drained that he must recharge by touching a meteor fragment.

The western azalea is known to occur as far north as Lincoln and Douglas Counties in Oregon and as far south as the mountains of San Diego county. Typically found in the coastal ranges of western North America, it also grows in the Cascade and Sierra Nevada mountain ranges, but is not known east of them. Description Rhododendron occidentale is a shrub growing to 5 m tall. The leaves are deciduous, 3‚Äì9 cm long and 1‚Äì3 cm broad. The flowers are 3.5‚Äì5 cm diameter, with five lobes on the corolla; color varies from white to pink, often with a yellow blotch. There is considerable diversity in the form and appearance of this species, with genetic diversity seeming to reach its highest level along the coast in the vicinity of the border between Oregon and California. It is tolerant of serpentine soils to the point that serpentine soils (along with surface water) can be used as a sign of its presence in southern Oregon. For this reason, it is a part of the unique plant community found in the serpentine barrens of the Siskiyou Mountains, along with Darlingtonia californica and Cypripedium californicum. It is usually found in wetlands although, like other rhododendrons, it does not grow with its roots submerged in water. It prefers both more moisture and more sunlight than Rhododendron macrophyllum, an evergreen rhododendron with a similar range. History and cultivation Rhododendron occidentale was described by explorers in western North America in the nineteenth century. At one time, the various geographic races were each classified as separate species. Seed was sent to Veitch Nursery in England in 1850 by William Lobb. The western azalea was an early contributor in the development of deciduous hybrid azaleas in Great Britain, such as the Exbury azaleas. During the twentieth century it has been the subject of ongoing plant exploration as at least three generations of rhododendron enthusiasts have sought out unusual forms for use in the garden and to record for science. Many of those forms are now conserved in the Smith-Mossman Western Azalea Garden at Lake Wilderness Arboretum in Maple Valley, Washington state, USA. References * Galle, Fred C.

It is located 51 kilometres from Teruel, the capital province. It is home to a medieval castle. the main attraction of the town is the medieval castle. However, Peracense hides also other charms that should be highlighted, both in terms of its cultural and natural heritage. Geography Placed in the western end of the province of Teruel, Peracense is the most southern town of Jiloca Region. Its 28.7 km2 of his municipal area border in the north with Villar del Salz; in the east with Villafranca del Campo; in the south with Almohaja and in the west with R√≥denas (Region of Sierra de Albarrac√≠n). The local roads TE-58 and TE-V-9024 make the principal way to arrive to the town. Both roads allow the access to the highway A-23 -principal communication axis of the region-, whether you reach it through Villafranca del Campo or through Santa Eulalia del Campo. History The most ancient settlers in Peracense, at least as there are evidences, are from the Iberian Period. Archaeological sites, such us El Palomar -placed in a surrounding area of the current urban town center-, testifies this statement. The remainders in the castle, -where fragments of Iberian ceramics were found-, can also indicate the presence of human settlement previous to the construction of the fortress. It is known that the first documentary reference to Peracense's existence is dated in 1220 in the Cartulario de Aliaga. This document contains transcriptions of several original documents relative to the foundation of the Order of the Temple (Latin: Pauperes commilitones Christi Templique Salomonici), commonly known as the Knights Templar, in this place. In this documents, Peracense is highlighted as a geographical limit. Peracense belonged to the family and inheritors of Juan Jim√©nez de Urrea until 1336, who sold the village, as well as the close town of Almohaja, to the Community of Daroca's Villages, joining both of them to the Rio Jiloca's Town Association from this precise moment. When the Community of Villages broke up, Peracense belonged successively to the Sobrecullida of Daroca (1488-1495), to the vereda de Daroca (1646) and to the Corregimiento of Daroca (1711-1833). In 1785 Peracense is considered to be an independent village, having this status until 1834 when the Local Government is founded, firstly associated to the Albarrac√≠n's Administrative area and then, in 1965, to the Teruel's Administrative Area. Socioeconomic structure Traditionally, Peracense's socioeconomic structure has been narrowly linked to the agricultural activity, very important in the town and the region on these days. Population According to the census review on January 1, 2009, the population of Peracense was 93 inhabitants, which gives barely a three inhabitants/km2 population density. This population numbers and the resultant population pyramid is the reflection of a very aged demographic structure. As an example, 50% of the population is over 65 years old, which clarifies the number of 60 years old average age at this moment. This demographic structure is a direct consequence of the rural population exodus who took place in the second half of the 20th century and who concerned the whole interior regions in Spain. In fact, in 1930 the population of Peracense managed to reach 455 inhabitants, its historical maximum, losing since then almost 80% of its total workforce. Nowadays, the local government and the region of Jiloca are working actively to revitalize the demographic and socioeconomic structure of the town, taking part in programs of demographic promotion, collaborating also with the Association of Entities for the Population of Teruel (HABITATE) and the Aragonese Association of Towns and Regions against the Depopulation. Economic activities Traditionally, the local economic base has been almost exclusively agricultural and livestock activities. With just over 1,000 hectares used for crops -almost 36% of the total town area-, the village has 19 agricultural farms, -according to the latest agricultural census-, all of them family business. In this regard, we can highlight the winter cereal crop production (wheat, barley, etc.). In addition to the agricultural activities, many of the farms in the village include a livestock orientation. Thus, the town livestock rounds 1,500 heads, 1,300 of them sheep. In regard to other economic activities in the territory, the town has 16 economic activities registered, distributed on the energy field (1 activity), construction (3) and services (12). The revitalization of the socioeconomic structure runs towards the enhancement of Peracense tourist attractions, especially its excellent medieval-castle, but also with the broadcasting of its environmental and landscape values. Culture Feast Fiestas de San Gines in honor of the patron of the town (August 25) and the Virgin of the Villeta (August 26). Cultural activities All early August since 2006, Peracense's castle is the scene of groups encounter who recreate the Medieval era. The aim of this event is to recreate the life on the castle around 1210, the moment in which the Peracense's fortress was the border with the Muslim Kingdom of Valencia. During the four-day meeting, the castle comes to life, being enabled several of its units as forge, kitchen, guard hall or chapel by the different attending groups, with amazing and great details. In the 2010 edition attended the event 15 groups from Spain and Portugal, with around a hundred characters perfectly outfitted, dressed and armed with the specific tools of the medieval times. The party, organized by the turolense group Regi Fidelis, has its own rules known as the \\"Code of Peracense\\", a document where the historical context recreation is described, as well as is also specified the dresses, the characteristics that must have the camp or the rules to follow while staging the battles. The purpose is to make the event, staging and their actions as faithful as possible. Natural heritage Track GR-24 As part of the extension of the GR-90, GR-24 runs through Iberian Aragon√©s Mountains from Aldehuela de Liestos to Peracense, connecting also with the Track GR-10, which leads us to the Albarrac√≠n and Javalambre Mountains. With its 80 kilometers long, apart from the environmental and cultural values presented in the town of Peracense -such as the medieval castle or the monumental tree Carrasca de los Tocones-, it must be added the Gallocanta lake, a unique landscape spots considered one of the most important wetlands in Europe and a winter home of large numbers of migratory birds. The GR-24 track has seven small tours that organize a 200 km network of trails and connects in Peracense with the GR-10 (Sierra de Albarracin-Sierra Javalambre). Cultural heritage The castle of Peracense Undoubtedly, The Castle in Peracense has to be regarded as one of the most important and best preserved in the south of Aragon, located in the mountains of Sierra Menera. Its historical significance resides in being a strategic bulwark against the nearby Kingdom of Castile and natural transit point between the cities of Daroca and Teruel, two of the largest human settlements in the Kingdom of Aragon in medieval times. In ancient documents is named Pietra Solez, dating its existence from the late 13th century, but most of the buildings belong to the 14th century. Apart from the historical significance, we must add the excellence landscape environment in which the castle is situated, close to the Hill of San Gines, and settled on a spur of rodeno rock, with nearly a perfect camouflage. Its average elevation is 1365 meters above the sea and its coordinates are: latitude, 40¬∞ 38' 30\\", longitude 02¬∞ 13' 05\\" (Madrid Meridian). =History= The origin of the castle is not completely clear. The archaeological remains found in its vicinity indicate that this area should be the defense of a small medieval town, known by locals as the Villeta, place where the medieval image of the Virgin and Child proceed, preserved nowadays in the parochial church in the town. According to information managed by Christopher Guitart, the building already existed in 1284, used by the royal troops as a starting point for the conquest of Albarracin. However, archeological Celts and Romans remains were also found, which gives us an overall idea of its ancestral origin. The fortress itself, the one we can see nowadays, was built in the first half of the 14th century for military use. Despite its location, as it is much closer to the city of Teruel than Daroca, and just on the border during the Middle Ages that separated the territories of both communities, the Castle was administered by governors designated by the community of Daroca. The castle is located at the mountain or rock of San Gin√©s, a strategic Teruel's geographical landmark, which territories were conquered by the troops of Daroca to the Muslim. The castle in Peracense, like other neighboring castles, was the result of rivalry between the medieval kingdoms of Castile and Aragon. Its mission was to control one of the possible access points where the Castilian troops could enter in Aragon in times of conflict, and to prevent their arrival in the Valley of Jiloca and all its main towns such as Santa Eulalia, Villafranca, Monreal del Campo or the city of Teruel. However, it seems that access of the Castilian troops could be from other nearby points, more difficult to be defended, and for this reason this castle was barely attacked and besieged. One reason to explain the lack of use of this castle is that it always was properly protected by other defensive elements of the environment. On one hand, the rectangular tower rising in the aforementioned hill of San Gin√©s, the main visual control point due to its location on a high land elevation with an environment eminently plain. On the other hand, we have the castle of R√≥denas, a great unknown building that served the castle of Perancense as a shield. The most obvious evidence of this statement is that there are no remains of a wall at the top in the castle of R√≥denas, while the remains of the castle in Peracense have always being more important, even before the recent restoration. Due to R√≥denas' castle belonged to the Community of Teruel, another possibility can be considered: both castles were kept to protect the possessions of their respective Communities on sporadic conflicts between them, rather than defend Arag√≥n of raids part from the kingdom of Castile. As already mentioned, there are no important events evidencing this castle sieges by enemy troops during the Middle Ages. We have to wait for war episodes of the first Carlist War to document their partial use again. =Description= This fortress consists of three concentric enclosures set on red sandstone outcrops (micaceous of buntsandstein), which were partially chopped and modified to improve the defense. This sandstone (Rodeno), as megaliths, as ashlar, or as masonry walls settled with lime mortars or gypsum, is the mainly used material in the construction of the walls on this fortress. The wood was used to a lesser extent and always in beams and putlogs. The natural and intricate terrain secured the defense of the east and north flanks, and for that reason is why the Keep Tower (Torre del Homenaje) is erected in this area. On the west and south sides of the castle two high and thick walls with battlement were built. In the first enclosure, still remain two central elements of the castle: a cistern and two towers. In the second square, enclosed by an imposing wall three meters thick built at right angles, with a side of 70 and another 40 meters, the Weapon Square was established. =Condition= The Castle has been extensively renovated. This restoration has brought life to a building that was mortally wounded, and had to be largely rebuilt. What was before was more than significant, and restorers had complete and original testimony of every part of the castle, for example the battlements. The castle has a museum with replicas of many archaeological pieces collected in the excavations, and has a souvenir shop expressly designed for the castle, open to the public since the early days of July 2002. =Visits= For further information, visit Peracense's Town Hall. =Protection= The Castle is under the protection of the General Declaration of the Decree of April 22, 1949, and Law 16/1985 on Spanish Historical Heritage. Church of San Pedro Dated in 1740, the Church of San Pedro has a basilica floor plan with three naves inside built in several sections. The transept is covered with a dome over pendentives. Built in concrete and masonry, the outside has a single volume with a hip roof. The tower, has two sections, the first one quadrangular, while the second has rounded corners and is decorated with Ionic pilasters. Town Hall Is a two-level building built in masonry. Downstairs can be seen the old fish market, consisting of two masonry lowered arches.

Work  Bowles has challenged economic theories that free markets and inequality maximize efficiency and argued that self-interested financial incentives can produce behavior that is inefficient and violates a society's morality. He has argued that economies with less inequality, such as Asian countries, have outperformed economies with more inequality, such as Latin American countries.  Academic work and interests  On his website at the Santa Fe Institute, he describes his two main academic interests as first, \\"the co-evolution of preferences, institutions and behavior, with emphasis on the modeling and empirical study of cultural evolution, the importance and evolution of non- self-regarding motives in explaining behavior, and applications of these studies to policy areas such as intellectual property rights, the economics of education and the politics of government redistributive programs\\"; and the second being concerned with \\"the causes and consequences of economic inequality, with emphasis on the relationship between wealth inequalities, incomplete contracts, and governance of economic transactions in firms, markets, families and communities.\\"Samuel Bowles Bowles frequently collaborates with his former colleague Herbert Gintis (another Emeritus Professor of Economics from Umass Amherst), both of whom were asked by Martin Luther King Jr. to write background papers for the 1968 Poor People's March.\\"Born Poor?

Real-world experiments show that contrary to traditional economic theories market incentives destroy cooperation and are less efficient than voluntary, altruistic behavior \\"in most cases.\\" People act not only for material interests, but also \\"to constitute themselves as dignified, autonomous, and moral individuals.\\" Behavioral experiments suggest that \\"economic incentives may be counterproductive when they signal that selfishness is an appropriate response\\" and \\"undermine the moral values that lead people to act altruistically\\". Bowles gives the example of day care centers in Haifa, where a fine was imposed on parents who were late picking up their children at the end of the day. Rather than avoiding late pick-ups, parents responded by doubling the fraction of time they arrived late. After 12 weeks, the fine was revoked, but the enhanced tardiness persisted unabated. According to Bowles, this illustrates a \\"kind of negative synergy\\" between economic incentives and moral behavior, further stating: \\"The fine seems to have undermined the parents' sense of ethical obligation to avoid inconveniencing the teachers and led them to think of lateness as just another commodity they could purchase\\". Bowles cites research by Ernst Fehr and others establishing that behavioral experiments modeling the voluntary provision of public goods show that \\"substantial fractions of most populations adhere to moral rules, willingly give to others, and punish those who offend standards of appropriate behavior, even at a cost to themselves and with no expectation of material reward\\". Diego Rivera's mural of factory workers at Ford's River Rouge assembly plant shows that according to Bowles organizations motivate members \\"by appealing to other-regarding motives such as the desire to do a good job and a sense of reciprocal obligations among members of a firm\\". In most cases, \\"[i]ncentives undermine ethical motives\\" as they \\"may frame a decision problem and thereby suggest self-interest as appropriate behavior\\". Simply using market terminology offers justifications for actions that would otherwise be unjustifiable. Economic structures of societies produce people with different values. In a game in which individuals could choose how much to withdraw from a common pool (\\"the forest\\"), the withdrawal that maximized the gains of the group was substantially less than the withdrawal that maximized the gains of the individual. When subjects were trained in a game with incentives to be selfish, they continue to be selfish even when they play in a second game without those incentives. In a \\"regulation\\" model where individuals were fined for \\"overexploitation\\", their behavior was entirely self-interested. In a society, \\"if the relevant incentives allow the selfish to exploit the civic- minded, then the latter are less likely to be copied\\". Studies of 15 small- scale societies shows that \\"individuals from the more market-integrated societies were also more fair-minded\\" in that they made more generous offers and preferred to reject an unfair offer even at the cost of receiving nothing. In these societies, \\"individuals engaging in mutually beneficial exchanges with strangers represent models of successful behavior who are then copied by others\\".  Inequality vs. economic success  \\"What is the relationship between inequality and the economic success of nations, firms, and local communities?\\", Bowles asks. At the University of California, Berkeley, he and other researchers have challenged two views long held by most economists, namely that inequality goes hand-in-hand with a nation's economic success and that reducing economic inequalities inevitably compromises efficiency. For instance, he wrote that \\"East Asian countries with relatively level distributions of income have dramatically outperformed Latin American countries with less equal income distributions. Investments in the nutrition, health and education of poor children have produced not only more economic opportunity but higher economic performance. Indeed, emerging economic theory suggests that inequality may have adverse effects, blunting productive incentives and fueling costly conflicts between haves and have-nots\\".Samuel Bowles Home Page of the Network on the Effects of Inequality on Economic Performance The traditional debate has been polarized, Bowles said, between ideal models of equality that overlooked the role of incentives and idealized models of the private market that overlooked inequality. The Berkeley group studied four questions: # How does inequality affect cooperation in local communities, and impact the local environment and other public goods, like irrigation water, neighborhood safety and other residential amenities, fisheries, forestry, and grazing lands? # How do inequalities affect the efficiency and productivity of farms, firms, and other entities, and are there more efficient forms of governance that can be promoted? # How do economic disparities among citizens affect bargaining, policy making, and economic performance at a national level? # What principles can guide the design of efficient and politically viable policies to alleviate poverty and enhance economic opportunity for the less well off?

UDP newspaper history before The Guardian  The UDP's history in the newspaper business starts with the Beacon, owned by Dean Lindo, which began printing in 1969 and was the main UDP newspaper (replacing The Reporter). The Beacon survived until 1994, but the last years of the newspaper saw it become slowly eclipsed by the new People's Pulse, headed first by Zelma Jex and later by William Ysaguirre and Ann-Marie Williams. The Pulse was the main newspaper for much of the 1990s but shut down like its predecessor after a UDP election loss in 1998.  Formation  With the defunct People's Pulse scheduled for shutdown after the 1998 general elections, in which the UDP lost, it was thought that the party needed a new image. The Guardian was expected to be part of that new image. With this in mind, the first issue of the newspaper rolled off the press in October 1998, even as the Pulse faced unpaid bills.

Editorial stance  As the official print organ of the United Democratic Party, The Guardian consistently criticizes the policies of the opposition People's United Party, whether in or out of government, similar to its PUP counterpart The Belize Times with regard to the UDP. In March 2003, after the UDP lost elections called on the 5th of the month, editor Panton claimed the election was the worst managed in Belizean history and listed a number of instances he thought were proof of the Elections and Boundaries Department's perfidy toward the UDP. However, Panton was at the time a member of the EBD's parent body, the Elections and Boundaries Commission, and was seen to have embarrassed the Commission by his action. A similar incident occurred prior to the 2003 by- election in October contested by the March loser John Saldivar. Panton editorialized in the Guardian again about alleged abuses by the EBD and earned himself its ire once more, though Saldivar won the election anyway. Both cases went into the EBD's report of events in 2003, and Panton would eventually be replaced by John Avery.

The film also features special appearances by Luther Vandross, Sinbad, Naughty by Nature, Cypress Hill, and Big Daddy Kane. Townsend stars as a mild-mannered schoolteacher, who becomes a superhero after his neighborhood in Washington, D.C. is terrorized by street gangs. Plot Jefferson Reed (Robert Townsend) is a mild-mannered school teacher in Washington, D.C. His neighborhood is terrorized by a local gang called The Golden Lords, led by Simon Caine (Roy Fegan) and allied with drug lord Anthony Byers (Frank Gorshin). One night, Jeff steps in to rescue a woman from the gang only to end up running from them himself. Hiding in a garbage dumpster, he manages to escape. As he climbs out, he is struck down by a glowing, green meteorite. His spine is crushed and he receives severe burns. A small fragment of the meteor was left over and taken by a vagrant named Marvin (Bill Cosby). Reed awakens several days later in the hospital, but when his bandages are taken off, he is miraculously healed of all injuries. Jeff soon discovered that the meteorite had left him with spectacular superpowers such as flight, x-ray/laser vision, superhuman strength, speed, and hearing, invulnerability, healing powers, the ability to absorb a book's content by touch, super breath, telepathy with dogs (which he uses to communicate with his own dog Ellington), and telekinesis. Confiding this to his parents Ted (Robert Guillaume) and Maxine (Marla Gibbs), they convince him to use his powers to help the community. His mother designs a costume and as the Meteor Man, he takes on the Golden Lords. He shuts down 15 crack houses, stops 11 robberies, brings peace between the police, the Crips (Cypress Hill), and the Bloods (Naughty by Nature) where they begin to work together to rebuild the community they destroyed, and plants a giant garden in the middle of the ghetto. The Golden Lords learn Meteor Man's secret identity and his slowly diminishing powers. As the violence gets out of hand and the Golden Lords continue their attacks, the community members plan to make a deal with them, but Jeff instead teaches them about fighting for their beliefs. A now, powerless Jeff fights Simon and is beaten up. Simon points his gun at Jeff, but Jeff's neighbor Earnest Moses (James Earl Jones) throws a record at him, successfully knocking the gun out of Simon's hand. Suddenly, Marvin uses the meteor fragment to strip the Golden Lords of their guns. This enables the locals to stand up to the Golden Lords as they fight them alongside Marvin's dogs. Marvin accidentally drops the meteor and both Jeff and Simon grab the rock from both sides, gaining superpowers, and engage in a brawl. When Simon is about to throw a dumpster at Jeff, he hears Ellington barking, telling Jeff that he can win, and throws the dumpster at Ellington instead, seriously injuring him. This angers Jeff and he disappears and returns as Meteor Man. They continue with their brawl with Meteor Man winning and draining Simon of his powers by absorbing them. He then defeats the rest of the Golden Lords. The locals all gather around Ellington who is now lying on the street, whimpering in pain. Jeff uses his x-ray vision to see that Ellington's ribs are broken. Before Jeff can do anything, his powers fade away, again. But just then, Marvin comes over and uses the last of his powers from the meteor fragment to heal Ellington's injuries, thus saving Ellington's life. The locals all applaud. Anthony Byers and his gang then confront Meteor Man, but are out-numbered by the Bloods and the Crips who show up to protect Meteor Man. Anthony Byers and his gang are then arrested by the police after attempting to \\"take a vacation to the Bahamas\\".

History of the training center  Sewell Point, the area occupied by the Training Center, has a long history of naval presence. During the American Revolutionary War and throughout the nineteenth century, Cape May Sound was used as a harbor of refuge. In 1917, the Navy established a \\"section base\\" in Cape May to provide training, vessel support and communication facilities for coastal defense. Initially, the Navy converted an abandoned amusement center, built along the oceanfront, for military use. The old skating rink became the mess hall and sleeping quarters, the stage was made into a galley, the \\"human roulette wheel\\" ‚Äì a scrub table and the \\"barrel of fun\\" became a brig. When the old wooden structure burned down in 1918, the Navy built standard military facilities along the harbor front (some of these buildings still stand). After World War I, the base was adapted to accommodate dirigibles. The largest hangar in the world, 700 feet long and over 100 feet tall, was built to accommodate an airship under construction in Britain. However, the R38 (ZR-2) crashed on its test flight and \\"lighter-than-air\\" craft were never fully adopted for Navy use. In 1924, the U.S. Coast Guard occupied the base and established air facilities for planes used in support of United States Customs Service efforts. During the Prohibition era, several cutters were assigned to Cape May to foil rumrunners operating off the New Jersey coast. After Prohibition, the Coast Guard all but abandoned Cape May leaving a small air/sea rescue contingent. For a short period of time (1929‚Äì1934), part of the base was used as a civilian airport. With the advent of World War II, a larger airstrip was constructed and the Navy returned to train aircraft carrier pilots. The over the water approach simulated carrier landings at sea. The Coast Guard also increased its Cape May forces for coastal patrol, anti- submarine warfare, air/sea rescue and buoy service. In 1946, the Navy relinquished the base to the Coast Guard. In 1948, all entry level training on the east coast was moved to the U.S. Coast Guard Recruit Receiving Station in Cape May. The Coast Guard consolidated all recruit training functions in Cape May in 1982. It provides seaman apprentices, fireman apprentices, seamen and firemen to the Coast Guard Fleet ‚Äì generally en route to \\"A\\" schools ‚Äì as well as sending some personnel directly to \\"A\\" schools. Although modern training facilities have replaced most of the original Naval Base buildings, the Coast Guard is respectful of the history of Sewell Point and their host city.  Additional roles  A Company Commander marches his company of trainees at Cape May In addition to its role as the sole accession point for the Coast Guard's enlisted corps, TRACENCM contains the Coast Guard's recruiter and company commander (i.e. \\"drill instructor\\") programs. Personnel from TRACENCM's ceremonial guard are often called upon by various civic and veterans' organizations to provide an active duty, uniformed military presence at numerous functions throughout the year (e.g. Veteran's Day, Memorial Day). The TRACEN maintains its own active duty and reservist staffed military fire and police departments, as well as ambulance service, that are frequently called for mutual aid in the local areas. TRACENCM is also home for and provides logistical support to over a dozen tenant commands. These tenant commands in turn perform support and operational missions that include: Search and Rescue; Military Readiness; Port & Environmental Safety; Commercial Vessel Safety; Enforcement of Laws and Treaties; Marine Environmental Response; Military Readiness; Recreational Boating Safety; Aids to Navigation; and Waterways Management.

Lineage and early life A patrilineal descendant of Robert the Bruce, he was the elder son of Archibald Campbell Carne Ross of Penzance and Brecon (through whom he descended also from Joseph Carne, of the Batten, Carne and Carne bank), and Millicent Strode Cobham. His paternal grandfather was Charles Campbell Ross. He was educated at Lindisfarne in Blackheath, Naish House in Burnham-on-Sea, Malvern College and Christ College, Brecon. He also attended Balliol College, University of Oxford after winning a Henry Skynner Scholarship in Astronomy in 1925, however he transferred to the School of English Language and Literature and graduated with first class honours in 1929. He also possessed a master's degree from the University of Birmingham. Career He was appointed an Assistant Lecturer in English Language at the University of Leeds in 1929, becoming a full lecturer in 1936. During the Second World War from 1940 he worked for the Foreign Office, before returning to academic life in 1946 as a Lecturer in English Language at Birmingham University, becoming Reader the following year. He was Professor of English Language there from 1948 to 1951 and Professor of Linguistics 1951-74. In an article published in 1954, he coined the terms \\"U\\" and \\"non-U\\", on the differences that social class makes in English language usage.Ross, Alan S.

It depicts Lord Farnham wearing the mantle and robes of a Knight of St. Patrick. The statue originally stood in the now long gone Farnham Gardens, which were on the opposite side of Farnham Street, slightly further along the street. The Rt Hon. Henry Maxwell, 7th Baron Farnham, K.P. (9 August 1799 ‚Äì 20 August 1868), was an Irish peer and Member of Parliament. Lord Farnham was the son of The 6th Baron Farnham and Lady Anne Butler. He was elected to the House of Commons for County Cavan in 1824, a seat he continued to represent until 1838. The latter year he succeeded his father to become The 7th Baron Farnham, inheriting the huge Farnham Estate in County Cavan, and subsequently served as an Irish Representative Peer from 1839 to 1868. He was made a Knight of St. Patrick in 1845. Lord Farnham married Anna Stapleton, daughter of Thomas Stapleton, 16th Baron le Despencer, on 3 December 1828. The couple had no children. Lord and Lady Farnham were killed in the Abergele train disaster in August 1868. After his death, a statue in his honour was erected in Cavan, allegedly 'by his tenants'. The statue now sits in front of the relatively new Johnston Central Library on Farnham Street in the town. The Farnham family crest reads Je suis pret (I am ready).

Plot  The story concerns a homeless boy named Ricky, or Ted in the Japanese version. Whilst seeing a movie about Lemuel Gulliver he is discovered to have entered without buying a ticket and he is thrown out onto the street. Ejected and dejected, he is then nearly run over by a truck, but is knocked unconscious when he is thrown against a wall. He awakes to find a talking dog and then the Colonel, a talking clockwork toy soldier who has been discarded in a rubbish bin. The dog suggests the trio amuse themselves at an amusement park that is closed for the night. The trio enjoy themselves on the rides and in a planetarium but are pursued by three security guards. The boy, his dog and the Colonel escape on fireworks rockets that land them in the countryside. They meet Professor Gulliver himself in a forest. Gulliver is now an elderly, space-traveling scientist who has built a rocket ship. With Dr. Gulliver's assistant Sylvester the crow (named Crow in the Japanese edition), Gulliver and the trio travel the Milky Way to the Planet of Blue Hope. They discover the planet has been taken over by the Queen of the Purple Planet and her evil group of robots, who the inhabitants of the Blue Planet created to make themselves a life of leisure that turned into a nightmare when the robots overthrew the population of the Blue Planet and seized control. Armed with water-pistols and water balloons which melt the villains, Ricky and Gulliver restore the Planet of Blue Hope to its doll-like owners who regain life as human beings. The boy wakes up in the street. He meets his canine companion who now is an ordinary dog who can not talk and discovers the non-talking non- living Colonel in the rubbish bin. The three walk down the street looking for a new adventure.  Production  This was one of the first Toei animated features to depart from Asian mythology, though, like Toei's previous animated features, it is modeled after the Disney formula of animated musical feature. By borrowing elements from Hans Christian Andersen, Jonathan Swift and science fiction, it was hoped that this film would attract a large international audience. However it proved to be no more popular than Toei's previous, Asian- themed films. After the failure in the U.S. of this and Toei's previous animated feature, this was the last Japanese animated feature to be released in the United States for over a decade, until Sanrio's Metamorphoses and The Mouse and His Child, both of which were released in the U.S. in 1978.  Staff  Not yet the internationally popular electronic music composer he was later to become, Isao Tomita contributed the original Japanese score. However, for the American edition, songs were composed by Milton and Anne Delugg, who had provided the song \\"Hooray for Santy Claus\\" for Santa Claus Conquers the Martians (1964). In one of his earliest animation jobs, a young Hayao Miyazaki worked on this film as an in-between artist. His contribution to the ending of the film brought Miyazaki to the attention of Toei. The screenplay was written by Shinichi Sekizawa, the writer of the first Mothra (1961). Sekizawa also contributed screenplays to some of the most popular films in the Godzilla series from King Kong vs. Godzilla (1962), to Godzilla vs. Mechagodzilla (1974), including Mothra vs. Godzilla (1964). In the English language version, former Our Gang star Darla Hood provides the voice of the Princess. Reception In a contemporary review, the Monthly Film Bulletin reviewed an 85-minute English-language dubbed version of the film, and described it as a \\"charmless animated feature\\". The review described the animation as \\"mediocre\\" and with \\"little variation or invention and a noticeable lack of perspective\\" English soundtrack Milton DeLugg composed the score for the English language version of the film.

Its territory is situated in the north-western part of the J√°sz-Nagykun-Szolnok county. The main town in the region is J√°szber√©ny. J√°szs√°g is inhabited by the Jassic people, an Iranic ethnic group whose linguistic base is preserved by the Ossetians. The population of the region is around 85,000. Name J√°szs√°g means \\"Province of the J√°sz\\" (i.e. Province of the Jassic people). History In ancient times, this area was settled by Celts, Dacians, Sarmatians, and Germanic peoples. It was part of the Dacian Kingdom of Burebista in the first century BC. In the 1st century AD, a Sarmatian tribe known as the Iazyges settled in this region. In the early Middle Ages, the territory of present-day J√°szs√°g was part of the Hun Empire, the Kingdom of the Gepids and the Kingdom of the Avars. At the end of the 9th century, the area was settled by the Hungarians and was subsequently included into the medieval Kingdom of Hungary. In the 11th century, the territory of present-day J√°szs√°g was part of the √öjv√°r County, while in the 12th century, it was divided between Heves√∫jv√°r and Pest counties.

Following the Battle of Moh√°cs (1526), the region was firstly included into the Eastern Hungarian Kingdom and later was annexed by the Ottoman Empire. During Ottoman administration in the 16th-17th centuries, the territory of present-day J√°szs√°g was initially part of the Budin Eyalet and later part of the Eƒüri Eyalet. At the end of the 17th century, the Ottoman Empire ceded the area to the Habsburg Monarchy and an autonomous region of J√°szs√°g was restored within the Habsburg Kingdom of Hungary. The region preserved its regional autonomy until 1876, when it was included into J√°sz-Nagykun-Szolnok County.

They were part of a comprehensive scheme developed by the Greater London Council (GLC) to alleviate traffic congestion on the city's road system by providing high speed motorway-standard roads within the capital linking a series of radial roads taking traffic into and out of the city. The Ringways originated from earlier plans including the County of London Plan, and were developed in the 1960s in response to increasing concern about car ownership and traffic. The plans attracted increasing opposition towards the end of the decade over the demolition of properties and noise pollution the roads would cause. Following a series of protests, the scheme was cancelled in 1973, at which point only three sections had been built.\\"Within London, a few fragments had been built: the Ringway 1 East Cross Route was complete by the early 1970s, and the A40(M) Westway and a short stub of the West Cross Route were open to traffic before the GLDP inquiry halted the plans.\\" - Some traffic routes originally planned for the Ringways were re-used for other road schemes in the 1980s and 1990s, most significantly the M25, which was created out of two different sections of Ringways joined together. History Background The Great West Road was an early 20th century attempt to solve traffic congestion around London London has been significantly congested since the 17th century. Various select committees were established in the late 1830s and early 1840s in order establish means of improving communication and transport in the city. The Royal Commission on London Traffic (1903‚Äì05), produced eight volumes of reports on roads, railways and tramways in the London area, including a suggestion for \\"constructing a circular road about 75 miles in length at a radius of 12 miles from St Paul's\\". Between 1913 and 1916, a series of conferences took place, bringing all road plans in Greater London together as a single body. Over the next decade, of new roads were constructed, primarily as post-war unemployment relief. These included the North Circular Road from Hanger Lane to Gants Hill, Western Avenue and Eastern Avenue, the Great West Road bypassing Brentford, and bypasses of Kingston, Croydon, Watford and Barnet. In 1924, the Ministry of Transport proposed another circular route, the North Orbital Road. This ran further out from London than the North Circular and was planned to be around long, running from the A4 at Colnbrook to the A13 at Tilbury. The Highway Development Survey, 1937 In May 1938, Sir Charles Bressey and Sir Edwin Lutyens published a Ministry of Transport report, The Highway Development Survey, 1937, which reviewed London's road needs and recommended the construction of many miles of new roads and the improvement of junctions at key congestion points. Amongst their proposals was the provision of a series of orbital roads around the city with the outer ones built as American-style Parkways ‚Äì wide, landscaped roads with limited access and grade-separated junctions. Bressey's plans called for significant demolition of existing properties, that would have divided communities if they had been built. However, he reported that the average traffic speed on three of London's radial routes was , and consequently their construction was essential. The plans stalled, as the London County Council were responsible for roads in the capital, and could not find adequate funding. County of London Plan and Greater London Plan, 1940s Ministry of Information documentary film The Proud City. The Ringway plan had developed from early schemes prior to the Second World War through Sir Patrick Abercrombie's County of London Plan, 1943 and Greater London Plan, 1944. One of the topics that Abercrombie's two plans had examined was London's traffic congestion, and The County of London Plan proposed a series of ring roads labelled A to E to help remove traffic from the central area. Even in a war- ravaged city with large areas requiring reconstruction, the building of the two innermost rings, A and B, would have involved considerable demolition and upheaval. The cost of the construction works needed to upgrade the existing London streets and roads to dual carriageway or motorway standards was considered significant; the A ring would have displaced 5,300 families. Because of post-war funding shortages, Abercrombie's plans were not intended to be carried out immediately. They were intended to be gradually built over the next 30 years. The subsequent austerity period meant that very little of his plan was carried out. The A Ring was formally cancelled by Clement Attlee's Labour government in May 1950. After 1951, the County of London focused on improving existing roads rather than Abercrombie's proposals. Ringway Scheme, 1960s By the start of the 1960s, the number of private cars and commercial vehicles on the roads had increased considerably from the number before the war. British car manufacturing doubled between 1953 and 1960. The Conservative government, led by Prime Minister Harold Macmillan, had strong ties to the road transport industry, with more than 70 members of parliament being members of the British Road Federation. Political pressure to build roads and improve vehicular traffic increased, which led to a revival of Abercrombie's plans. The Ringway plan took Abercrombie's earlier schemes as a starting point and reused many of his proposals in the outlying areas but scrapped the plans in the inner zone. Abercrombie's A Ring was scrapped as being far too expensive and impractical. The innermost circuit, Ringway 1, was approximately the same distance from the centre as the B Ring. It used some of Abercrombie's suggested route, but it was planned to use existing transport corridors, such as railway lines, much more than before. The location of these lines produced a ring that was distinctly box-shaped and Ringway 1 was unofficially called the London Motorway Box. In 1963, Colin Buchanan published a report, Traffic in Towns, which had been commissioned by the Transport Minister, Ernest Marples. In contrast to earlier reports, it cautioned that road building would generate and increase traffic and cause environmental damage. It also recommended pedestrianisation of town centres and segregating different traffic types. The report was published by Penguin Books and sold 18,000 copies. Several key ideas in the report would later be perceived as being correct as road protesting grew from the 1980s onward. The London Traffic Survey was published the following year, and concluded that the Ringways should be built in order to cater for future network traffic, instead of Traffic in Towns which said if a road was not built, there would be no demand along that route anyway. The 1960s plans were developed over a period of several years and were subject to a continuing process of review and modification. Roads were added and omitted as the overall scheme was altered and many alternative route alignments were considered during the planning process. The plan was published in stages starting with Ringway 1 in 1966 and Ringway 2 in 1967. After the Conservatives won the GLC elections in the latter year, they confirmed that both Ringways would be constructed as planned. The plan was hugely ambitious and almost immediately attracted opposition from several directions. Ringway 1 was designed to be an eight-lane elevated motorway running through the middle of Camden Town. A principal problem was the route of Ringway 2 in south London, since the South Circular was largely an unimproved series of urban streets and there were fewer railway lines to follow. Parts would be built with four lanes in each direction, and in some cases there was no other plan than to destroy whatever urban streets were in the way of the new road. At Blackheath, the road would have run in a deep- bored tunnel to avoid any impact on the local area, at an estimated cost of ¬£38 million. However, until around 1967 the opposition was more towards specific proposals instead of the concept of Ringways generally. The report Motorways in London, published in 1969 by the architect/planner Lord Esher and Michael Thomson, a transport economist at the London School of Economics, calculated that costs had been enormously underestimated and would show marginal economic returns. They predicted large quantities of additional traffic that would be generated purely as a result of the new roads. Access to the new roads would soon be overwhelmed even before the rings and radial roads were near capacity, while about 1 million Londoners would find their lives blighted by living within 200 yards of a motorway. Reports suggested between 15,000 and 80,000 Londoners would lose their homes as a result of the Ringways. The Treasury and the Department of Transport both came out against the scheme, primarily because of worries over the cost. Despite this opposition, the GLC continued to develop its plans, and began the construction of some of the parts of the scheme. The plan, still with much of the detail to be worked out, was included in the Greater London Development Plan, 1969 (GLDP) along with much else not related to roads and traffic management. In 1970, the GLC estimated that the cost of building Ringway 1 along with sections of 2 and 3 would be ¬£1.7 billion. (approximately ¬£ today) Three- quarters of this would have to come from central government grants. In 1970, the British Road Federation surveyed 2,000 Londoners, 80% of whom favoured more new roads being built. In contrast, a public enquiry was held to review the GLDP in a climate of strong and vocal opposition from many of the London Borough councils and residents associations that would have seen motorways driven through their neighbourhoods. The Westway and a section of the West Cross Route from Shepherd's Bush to North Kensington, opened in 1970. It showed the public what the Ringways would be like for local residents and what demolition would be required, and led to increased complaints over the scheme. The GLDP received 22,000 formal objections by 1972. The GLC realised that the South Cross Route might be impractical to build, and looked instead at integrating public transport through a new park-and-ride scheme at Lewisham that would serve a new Fleet line on the London Underground. The GLC attempted to hold on to the Ringway plans until the early 1970s, hoping that they would eventually be built. By 1972, in an attempt to placate the Ringway plan's vociferous opponents, the GLC removed the northern section of Ringway 1 and the southern section of Ringway 2 from the proposals. In January 1973, the enquiry recommended that Ringway 1 be built, but that much of the rest of the Ringway schemes be abandoned. The project was submitted to the Conservative government for approval and, for a short period, it appeared that the GLC had made enough concessions for the scheme to proceed. A report around this time commissioned by Frank Layfield showed that the GLDP was too dependent on roads for its transport plans. Because the GLC had proposed the Ringways as a complete scheme, protesters against specific parts of it in different areas were able to unite against a common goal, which led to the Layfield Inquiry successfully challenging the proposals. The Labour party made large gains in the GLC elections of April 1973 with a policy of fighting the Ringways scheme. Given the continuing fierce opposition across London and the likely enormous cost, the cabinet cancelled funding and hence the project. Ringway 1 Plan of Ringway 1 showing the parts of the central area scheme that were built. Blue lines are roads built as planned, red lines those built later. Roads shown in grey were never built. Ringway 1 was the London Motorway box, comprising the North, East, South and West Cross Routes. Ringway 1 was planned to comprise four sections across the capital forming a roughly rectangular box of motorways. These sections were designated: *North Cross Route ‚Äì from Harlesden to Hackney Wick via West Hampstead, Camden Town, Highbury and Dalston *East Cross Route ‚Äì from Hackney Wick to Kidbrooke via Bow, Blackwall and Greenwich *South Cross Route ‚Äì from Kidbrooke to Battersea via Lewisham, Peckham, Brixton and Clapham *West Cross Route ‚Äì from Harlesden to Battersea via North Kensington, Shepherds Bush, West Kensington, Earls Court and Chelsea Harbour The West Cross Route near White City Much of the scheme would have been constructed as elevated roads on concrete pylons and the routes were designed to follow the alignments of existing railway lines to minimise the amount of land required for construction, including the Metropolitan line in the north, the Greenwich Park branch line in the south, and the West London line to the west. Nevertheless, the disruption and widespread demolition required to build the Ringway would have been considerable. Ringway 1 was expected to cost ¬£480 million (¬£ today) including ¬£144 million (¬£ today) for property purchases. It would require and affect 7,585 houses. The only elements of Ringway 1 that were constructed were: * Part of the West Cross Route between North Kensington and Shepherds Bush which was opened by Michael Heseltine in 1970, simultaneously with Westway, to loud protests; some residents hung a huge banners with 'Get us out of this Hell ‚Äì Rehouse Us Now' outside their windows and protesters disrupted the opening procession by driving a lorry the wrong way along the new road. *The East Cross Route, including a new 'eastern bore' for the Blackwall Tunnel opened between 1967 and 1979. The East and North Cross Route junction at Hackney Wick. The sliproad in the centre is the only part of the North Cross Route to be constructed The North Cross Route began south of Willesden Junction and followed the London Overground line up to the line of the M1, then between the Midland main line and Metropolitan line, with a link to Finchley Road. It passed through Hampstead owing to local geography, and over British Rail's goods depot at Camden Town, where there was to be an interchange with a town bypass. It followed railways to the north of and King's Cross, then run in a tunnel through Highbury, and cross Kingsland High Street on a viaduct, leading to a junction with the East Cross Route by Hackney Wick. The whole of the East Cross Route was built and follows the A12 to Bow Road, then the A102 through the Blackwall Tunnel to the Sun in the Sands roundabout, and the A2 to Kidbrooke, meeting the South Cross Route. The South Cross Route ran beneath Blackheath Park in a tunnel, following railways as much as possible for its route though Peckham, Loughborough Park and Clapham to Nine Elms. There was then a link to the West Cross Route and Ringway 2 at Wandsworth. The West Cross Route followed the West London line, with a bridge over the Thames near Chelsea Basin. There was a planned interchange with the A4 Cromwell Road and Holland Park Avenue. The section north to the Westway was built. North of here, it would have continued to follow the West London line, crossing the Great Western railway and the Grand Union Canal, linking with the North Cross Route by Willesden Junction. Ringway 2 Plan of Ringway 2 as proposed in late 1960s Ringway 2 was planned to run though Oxleas Wood Ringway 2 was an upgrade of North Circular Road and a new motorway to replace the South Circular Road. The North Circular was largely a coherent route (see \\"Background\\" above), but the South Circular was merely a signposted route through the suburbs of South London on pre-existing sections of standard roads, involving twists and turns, selected by route planners in the 1930s. Ringway 2 would have headed roughly in a direction towards the North Circular Road at Chiswick, though there was no definite proposed route. Much of the Ringway, particularly the southern section where a new route was required, would have been placed in cuttings to mitigate disruption to local residents. Northern section The North Circular Road was to have been improved to motorway standard along its existing route. Some plans refer to the section in east London as the M15, but this was not planned to refer to the entire road. Since the Ringways Plan was cancelled, most of the route has been upgraded, some of it close to motorway standard, but this has been done in a piecemeal manner. In places, the road is a six-lane dual carriageway with grade separated junctions, while other parts remain at a much lower standard. In some cases this has been because of protests; the junction with the North Circular and the A10 was only completed in 1990 after several other schemes had been blocked. At the western end of the North Circular a new section of motorway would have been constructed to take the route of Ringway 2 eastwards from the junction with the M4 at Gunnersbury along the course of the railway line through Chiswick to meet and cross the River Thames at Barnes. This section was never well planned and did not have an exact proposed alignment. The route of the eastern section of the North Circular Road south from the A406's junction with the M11 to the junction with the A13 (the \\"South Woodford to Barking Relief Road\\") was built on the planned motorway alignment, opening in 1987. The section between South Woodford and Redbridge roundabout (A12 junction) was, for a time, temporarily designated as part of the M11. At its eastern end, Ringway 2 was planned to have crossed the River Thames at Gallions Reach in a new tunnel between Beckton and Thamesmead.BY OUR LOCAL GOVERNMENT CORRESPONDENT. \\"Minister decides on tunnel for Thamesmead.\\" Times, 12 Mar. 1969, p. 3.

Although this tunnel was never built, the utility of an additional river crossing in this area continued to be recognised during the decades after the Ringway Scheme's cancellation and various proposals for an East London River Crossing have been developed, the most recent of which was the Thames Gateway Bridge, cancelled in 2008. Southern section The South Circular Road was in the 1960s, and remains still, little more than an arbitrary route through the southern half of the city following roads that are mainly just single carriageway. The road planners considered the existing routing unsuitable for a direct upgrade so a new replacement motorway was planned for a route further to the south where the road could be constructed with less destruction of local communities. Starting in the London Borough of Greenwich at the southern end of the new tunnel in Thamesmead, the planned route for the new southern section of Ringway 2 would have first interchanged with the A2016 then headed south, first through Plumstead towards Plumstead Common and then, via open land, to Shooters Hill Road (A207). Controversially, the route was then planned to cross the ancient woodland of Oxleas Wood and the adjacent Shepheardleas Wood to connect to the \\"Rochester Way Relief Road\\" (A2) at a junction at Falconwood. Heading south from the A2, Ringway 2 would have crossed Eltham Warren Golf Course and Royal Blackheath Golf Club to reach the A20 at Mottingham where its next junction would have been constructed. Next, heading west out of the London Borough of Greenwich, the motorway crossed to Baring Road (the A2212) near Grove Park station. Here the route encounters the first substantial urban development cutting an alignment through the London County Council's Downham Estate ‚Äì land already in public ownership, thereby avoiding the need for expensive land purchases and compensation payments. Here the motorway would have run parallel with Shroffold Road and Durham Hill to cross Downham Fields then run parallel with Downham Way to meet Bromley Road (A21) at a junction. West of Bromley Road, Ringway 2 would have followed a westerly alignment, crossing the River Ravensbourne, and running across more sports fields and the northern corner of Beckenham Place Park to a junction with Beckenham Hill Road (A2015) near Stumpshill Wood where it would have left the London Borough of Lewisham and re-entered the London Borough of Bromley. From Beckenham Hill Road, Ringway 2 would have continued through more open land towards Lower Sydenham station where the motorway would have turned south to run along the side of the railway line past New Beckenham station. Here the route would have followed the railway line (now occupied by Tramlink) south-west towards Birkbeck station where a junction would have been built to connect to Elmers End Road (A214). Continuing along the railway line south-west of Birkbeck station, the motorway would have skirted the northern side of Beckenham Cemetery and entered the London Borough of Croydon. Here Ringway 2 would have had an interchange with another of the new motorways planned by the GLC, the \\"South Cross Route to Parkway D Radial\\" coming south-east along the railway line from Crystal Palace station. Like Ringway 2 this road was never built. Continuing west, the route would have crossed Penge Road (A213) and the railway line to Norwood Junction. Next, it would have passed across a residential section of South Norwood. Here the roads are not aligned to afford an easy route for a motorway and demolitions would have been required to provide a passage for it to reach Whitehorse Lane where it would have turned south-west again to follow the road for a short distance before turning west again just north of Selhurst Park stadium. Crossing waste ground and the southern tip of Grangewood Park, a junction would then have been built with Grange Road (A212). More demolitions would have been required to the north of Thornton Heath town centre for the Ringway to meet another railway line at Thornton Heath station. Ringway 2 would have turned to follow the railway north-west towards Norbury. At Norbury a junction would have been provided with the A23 before continuing north-west into the London Borough of Lambeth and on towards Streatham. South of Streatham Common station, Ringway 2 would have left the alignment of the railway to head west across Streatham Vale and Abercairn Road to a junction built on a triangle of railway land and allotments where it would have met the end of the M23 coming north from Mitcham. Having entered the London Borough of Merton and again taking the easiest alignment, the Ringway would have continued along the railway line to Tooting. A junction with the A24 would have been provided at the south end of Tooting High Street. Between there and Haydons Road station the motorway would have turned north through the industrial area of Summerstown then crossed over the main railway line to Waterloo station adjacent to the River Wandle. Entering the London Borough of Wandsworth, the Ringway would have taken a route through Southfields via the parks and playing fields on the west side of the Wandle until it reached Buckhold Road where it would have cut a north-west alignment through the residential area of west Wandsworth to reach a junction with West Hill (A3) and Upper Richmond Road (A205). Ringway 2 would have followed Upper Richmond Road to East Putney from where it would have run alongside the railway line through Putney and into the London Borough of Richmond upon Thames. It would have followed the railway across Barnes Common then over the River Thames adjacent to Barnes Railway Bridge to meet the northern section. In 1970 the GLC expected the long southern ring to cost ¬£305m, including ¬£63m for property purchases. It would require and affect 5705 houses. Ringway 3 Ringway 3 Cranford is on the planned route of Ringway 3 Ringway 3 was a new road, the north section of which became part of the M25 from South Mimms to Swanley via the Dartford Crossing. It was intended for traffic bypassing London, and was a Government scheme outside of the remit of London County Council. The route was roughly based on the earlier \\"D\\" ring designed by Patrick Abercrombie. The southern section was never planned in detail, so a specific route does not exist. The section in West London was eventually built to a lower standard as the A312. Ringway 3 was planned to link the capital's outer suburbs linking areas such as Barnet, Epping, Dartford, Purley and Chessington. Construction began on the first section of the motorway between South Mimms and Potters Bar in 1973 and the motorway was initially designated as the M16 motorway before its opening. Whilst the construction of the first section was in progress, the plan for Ringways 3 and 4 were modified considerably. Broadly speaking, the northern and eastern section of Ringway 3 (from the current junction 23 of the M25 motorway with the A1 east and south to the current junction 3 with the M20) was to be built and connected to the southern and western section of Ringway 4 to create the M25. The remaining parts of the two rings became redundant. The South Mimms to Potters Bar section (junction 23 to junction 24) was opened in 1975, temporarily designated as an A-road (A1178). The remaining sections of the northern Ringway 3 were constructed over the next eleven years: the M25 motorway was completed in 1986 with the opening of the Ringway 4 to Ringway 3 linking section from Micklefield to South Mimms (junction 19 to junction 23). One part of Ringway 3 in west London was eventually built as The Parkway/Hayes Bypass (A312). Ringway 4 Ringway 4 Ringway 4 was more commonly known by the names \\"North Orbital Road\\" and \\"South Orbital Road\\", and was first mentioned in Bressey's report.\\"Route For South Orbital Road.\\" Times, 26 Apr. 1939, p. 18. The Times Digital Archive, https://link.gale.com/apps/doc/CS303117466/TTDA?u=kccl&sid;=TTDA&xid;=30e8e437. Accessed 5 Sept. 2020. The southern section became part of the M25 and M26 from Wrotham Heath to Hunton Bridge. Sections of the A405 and A414 through Hertfordshire are its proposed line. The road was planned as a new rural motorway/dual carriageway connecting a number of towns around the capital including Sevenoaks, Redhill/Reigate, Leatherhead, Staines, Uxbridge, Watford, St Albans, Hatfield, Hertford and Hoddesdon. Despite its name, the route of Ringway 4 did not make a complete circuit of London. It was, instead, U-shaped. The planned route started at a junction with the M20 motorway (then also being planned) near Wrotham in Kent and ran west as motorway around the capital to Hunton Bridge near Watford. From Watford, the road was to become dual carriageway heading east until it met Ringway 3 near Navestock in Essex. Construction began on the first section of the motorway between Godstone and Reigate (junctions 6 to 8) in 1973 and included a junction with the M23 motorway which was under construction at the same time. Whilst the construction of the first section was in progress, the plan for Ringways 3 and 4 was modified considerably. Broadly speaking, the motorway section of Ringway 4 was to be built and connected to the northern and eastern section of Ringway 3 (from the current M25 junction 23 with the A1 clockwise to the current junction 3 with the M20). Two additional sections of motorway were added to the plan to join the two original sections and the remaining parts of the two rings were cancelled. The south-eastern section of Ringway 4 between Wrotham and Sevenoaks was redesignated as the M26. Except for a deviation from the original plan around Leatherhead, the current M26 and the M25 between junctions 5 and 19 mostly follow the planned route of Ringway 4. The Godstone to Reigate section was opened in 1976 and the remaining sections of the southern Ringway 4 were constructed over the next ten years. One short section of the dual-carriageway portion of Ringway 4 was constructed in Hoddesdon linking the town to the A10. The overly large junction between the link road and the A10 was built with space available to continue the road westward over the A10 as originally planned. Legacy Ringway 1 Elevated junction of the West Cross Route and Westway at White City looking north-west shortly after construction. The continuation of the West Cross Route would have passed under the roundabout with the stubs from the roundabout linking to the northern slipways. In the central London area only the East Cross Route and part of the West Cross Route of Ringway 1 were constructed together with the elevated Westway which links Paddington to North Kensington. These were all begun and completed before the plan was cancelled. With its elevated roadway on concrete pylons flying above the streets below at rooftop height, the Westway provides a good example of how much of Ringway 1 would have appeared had it been constructed. The East Cross route was the only part to be built in its entirety and it includes a permanently unfinished junction at Hackney Wick with the proposed North Cross Route. Ringway 2 Southwyck House in Brixton was specifically designed to shield the noise from Ringway 2 The North Circular Road (A406) section of Ringway 2 survived the cancellation of the Ringways. It remained a trunk road and a extension from South Woodford to Barking had land reserved from 1968. This extension was approved in 1976, and opened in 1987. Improvements have been made to the existing North Circular, so that most of it is now dual carriageway. However, these have been done in a piecemeal fashion so that the road varies in quality and capacity along its length and still has several unimproved single carriageway sections and awkward junctions. By comparison, very little has been done to improve the condition of the South Circular Road (A205) (which has complex junctions and forks) and no part of the southern part of Ringway 2 has been built, mainly because of the density of the residential areas through which the South Circular runs. The road remains predominantly single carriageway throughout. One relic of the scheme is Southwyck House in Brixton, which was deliberately designed to shield noise from Ringway 2, leading to its nickname of \\"Barrier Block\\". Other Ringways Parts of Ringways 3 and 4 were started soon after Ringway 1 was cancelled. The first section of the northern half of Ringway 3 was constructed between South Mimms and Potters Bar and opened in 1975. The first section of Ringway 4 was built between Godstone and Reigate and opened the following year. Before the first of these opened, the planned north and east sections of Ringway 3 and the planned south and west sections of Ringway 4 were combined as the M25 (the northern part was initially designated as the M16 during the planning stages but opened as the M25). The remaining sections of these two circular routes were never built. M23 Uncompleted London- bound slipway from the A23 to the unbuilt M23 north of junction 7, showing an unused bridge The M23 was particularly affected by the cancellation of the Ringways. The original plan had been to connect it to Ringway 2 near Streatham, and when the Ringway was cancelled, it was extended to meet Ringway 1 near Stockwell. Once the Ringways were cancelled completely, there seemed little point in finishing the M23 as it would drop all its traffic onto suburban streets. However, the M23 up to Streatham remained a projected route throughout the 1970s, and appeared on some road atlases of the time. The Wallington M23 Action Group campaigned for the motorway to be formally cancelled, as the inability to develop land along the line of the proposed M23 had led to planning blight in the area. In 1978, the M23 north of Hooley was cancelled, to be replaced by an all-purpose relief road replacing the A23. Some residents complained, saying the motorway should still be built, and that its terminus at Hooley caused a build up of traffic there, and contributed to congestion on other roads. These proposals were cancelled in May 1980. The M23 to Streatham was briefly revived in 1985 by the GLC after the government had announced plans to spend ¬£1.5 billion on trunk roads in London. In December 2006, the Coulsdon Relief Road was opened by the Mayor of London, Ken Livingstone. It was one of the few road proposals approved by the anti-car Livingstone, and included a dedicated lane for buses and cycles. Radials Some of the radial routes that were planned to connect to the Ringway system were built much as planned, including the M1 and M4. Other radial roads, such as the M3, M11 and M23, were truncated on the outskirts of London far from their intended terminal junctions on Ringway 1. Others were simply not built at all in a form recognisable from the Ringway proposal. Later events Coulsdon Relief Road In 2000, Transport for London (TfL) was formed, taking responsibility for all related projects in Greater London, including roads. They did not have responsibility for maintaining any motorways, so the built parts of the Westway and West and East Cross Routes were downgraded to all- purpose roads. TfL has concentrated primarily on improving public transport in London and discouraging the use of private cars where practical. The only new road constructed by TfL has been the Coulsdon Relief Road. The feedback and complaints from the Ringway plans led to an increased interest towards road protest in the United Kingdom. These included opposition to transport projects such as Twyford Down and Heathrow Terminal 5 and industrial projects such as Hinkley Point C nuclear power station. Documentation The Ringway plans were largely made in secret, and in some cases no definitive route was made, which has made it difficult to work out its exact route and impact. Consequently, the project is not particularly well known to the general British public. The website roads.org.uk, run by enthusiast Chris Marshall, has been praised for its level of detail in researching the Ringways, and cited as a definitive source of information.

He is best known as the author of the work of responsa Seridei Eish. Rabbi Weinberg was considered a genius in his time - with mastery over both Torah and secular subjects. An insightful and introspective individual, his varying interests in Talmud, musar, Hebrew literature, Russian language, and general academia make him one of the best representatives of the tumultuous intellectual trends present in his period. Biography Yechiel Yaakov Weinberg was born in Poland.The \\"Ba'al Seride Esh\\" He studied at the yeshivas of Mir and Slabodka. In the latter, \\"he combined within himself Lithuanian profound understanding of Halacha with the Slabodka musar expounded by the illustrious Alter, Rabbi Nosson Tzvi Finkel.\\"Judaism 101 - Rabbi Yechiel Yaakov Weinberg - A Glossary of Basic Jewish Terms and Concepts - OU.ORG In 1906 he married 16-year-old Esther Levine, daughter of the deceased Rabbi Yaakov Meir of Pilvishki. He also became rabbi of this city, both the spiritual rabbi and crown rabbi, and served for seven years. At the outbreak of World War I, he went to Germany. There he studied at the University of Giessen. Although Polish-born and Lithuanian-trained, Rabbi Weinberg \\"developed an extremely beautiful German prose style which was matched only by his mastery of modern Hebrew.\\" He taught at and eventually became rector (rosh yeshiva) of the Hildesheimer Rabbinical Seminary in Berlin. His students included Rabbis Eliezer Berkovits, Giuseppe (Yoseph) Laras and Josef Hirsch Dunner. As rosh yeshiva, Rabbi Weinberg emerged as a leading advocate of Neo-Orthodoxy, the German approach to Orthodox Judaism, based on the Torah im Derech Eretz of Rabbi Samson Raphael Hirsch. Although Torah im Derech Eretz was \\"an ideology that he had openly opposed in his youth,\\"Azure Weinberg \\"championed\\" this approach during his tenure at the Hildesheimer seminary,See for example http://www.daat.ac.il/daat/kitveyet/deot/vaynberg.htm (Hebrew) and he \\"played and was to play a seminal part in the reconciliation of Torah orthodoxy with modernity.\\" Rabbi Josef Dunner  Special reports  Guardian Unlimited His \\"melding of sources, methods, and worlds was unparalleled in modern halachic literature. It required breadth and depth of knowledge that were, and remain, rare.\\" Weinberg was offered the position of the head of the prestigious London Beth Din by Chief Rabbi Joseph Hertz in 1934. But following pressure from his students in Berlin, Weinberg turned the offer down, following which it was offered to Dayan Yehezkel Abramsky who held the position for almost twenty years.http://onthemainline.blogspot.com/2011/04/guest-post-chief-rabbinate- and.html In 1939, he fled Nazi Germany, and became trapped in the Warsaw Ghetto, where he was a prominent leader. Because of his Russian citizenship, the Germans imprisoned him together with Russian prisoners of war, enabling him to avoid the concentration camps and to survive the war. After the war, a loyal student, R. Shaul Weingort, brought him to Montreux, Switzerland, where he lived until his passing in 1966. Despite many offers of prominent rabbinic positions across the globe, R. Weinberg chose not to leave Switzerland, where he penned many influential and important responsa.Rav Yitzchak Blau: The Life of R. Yechiel Yaakov Weinberg, vbm-torah.org. Works *Seridei Eish (\\"Remnants of the Fire\\") Responsa dealing with halachic questions addressed to Rabbi Weinberg from all over the world concerning the great problems of modern life - technological, social and personal. It was first published in four volumes by Mossad Harav Kook in Jerusalem (1961, 1962 and 1966 - just before Rabbi Weinberg's passing) and has been republished as Shut Seridei Eish (1999). \\"These four volumes have already become classics in the world of halachic literature... Like all great responsa works, [these] are - apart from their intrinsic halachic value - a faithful mirror of the time in which they were written and no doubt will become a fertile source for the research of future Jewish historians and sociologists\\". *Mechkarim beTalmud (\\"Investigations of the Talmud\\") documents Rabbi Weinberg's studies on Talmudical methodology. It was published in 1938 while Rabbi Weinberg was rosh yeshiva of the Orthodox Rabbinical Seminary in Berlin. This publication laid the foundation for Rabbi Weinberg's responsa. It contains not only a great number of sugyos, explained in a novel manner, but may be considered a handbook on Talmudic methodology. This work is considered \\"no less classical than his responsa\\". In it, \\"the traditional Lithuanian [method of study] and the modern scientific approach to the study of Talmud became an organic unity\\". *Other works by Rabbi Weinberg include: **Chidushei Baal \\"Seridei Eish\\" (Jerusalem, 2005). **Li-ferakim (2002); discussions on mussar, aggada and midrash, and contemporary issues. **Kitvei ha-Gaon Rabbi Yechiel Yaakov Weinberg zatsal (2 vols., Scranton, 1998, 2003). **Pinui atsmot metim (Berlin, 1926).

The other administrative divisions were Shapur- Khwarrah, Istakhr and Darabgerd, while a fifth named Arrajan was founded in the early 6th century by Kavadh I (r. 498‚Äì531).  History  Ardashir- Khwarrah was founded by the first Sasanian king Ardashir I (r. 224-242), who around the same time also founded its capital, Gor. Although some sources state that the capital was established after Ardashir's victory in 244 over the Parthian king Artabanus V, archeological evidence confirm that it was established before the battle. In Gor, Ardashir I built a Zoroastrian tower called Terbal, which was similar to a Buddhist stupa. Furthermore, he also built a fire-temple which the 10th-century Arab historian al-Masudi reportedly visited. In the early 5th-century, a bridge was built in Gor by the Sasanian minister (wuzurg framadƒÅr) Mihr Narseh, who was a native of Abruwan, a subdistrict in Ardashir-Khwarrah. An inscription was also written on the bridge, which says; \\"This bridge was built by order of Mihr-Narseh, wuzurg framadƒÅr, for his soul's sake and at his own expense... Whoever has come on this road let him give a blessing to Mihr-Narseh and his sons for that he thus bridged this crossing.\\" Furthermore, he also founded four villages with a fire-temple in each of them. The name of the fire-temples were; Faraz-mara- awar-khwadaya, Zurwandadan, Kardadan, and Mahgushnaspan. He had a fifth fire- temple constructed in Abruwan, which may have been the Barin fire-temple that the 10th-century Persian geographer Estakhri visited, who stated that the fire-temple had an inscription that stated 30,000 dirhams was spent for its construction. Sometime before 540, a diocese was established in Gor. In ca. 644, during the Arab invasion of Iran, one of Ardashir-Khwarrah's subdistricts, Tawwaz, was seized by al-'Ala' ibn al-Hadrami, who thereafter sent Hormoz ibn Hayyan al-'Abdi to capture Siniz, which he successfully managed to. In 649/50, Abd-Allah ibn Amir made an unsuccessful attempt to capture Gor. In 650/1, the last Sasanian king Yazdegerd III (r. 632‚Äì651) went to Gor to plan an organized resistance against the Arabs, but after receiving the news of Istakhr's fall, fled to Kirman. The Arabs then quickly seized Gor, Siraf, and the rest of Pars.

Physically they are a spindly insectoid species. They despise death, injury and any form of weakness. If forced to humiliate itself by conversing with a member of an alien species as an equal, a Tandu will cut off one or two of its own legs as a form of ritual purification. A Tandu who has been deemed by his superiors to have failed unforgivably is expected to commit \\"suicide\\" by cutting off his own head.  Worship  Like many Uplift Universe species, the Tandu worship the Progenitors (a semi-mythical race that lived two billion years ago and created (uplifted) the first intelligent species) and would by human standards be considered religious zealots. They are a highly xenophobic species, viewing all other intelligent lifeforms simply as enemies or tools for them to use. They follow the \\"Inheritor\\" sect of the cult of the Progenitors, believing that upon the return of the Progenitors (an event roughly equivalent to the Christian Rapture in many Galactic mythologies) the current power structure of galactic civilization will be destroyed and the universe will be cleansed of \\"unworthy\\" races. The Tandu believe they will be given the privilege of being made the Progenitors' holy warriors, who will slaughter the unworthy upon their return.  Clients  The Tandu have created at least two slave races that are powerful psychic adepts: Episiarchs and Acceptors. The Tandu may have violated the rules of the uplift institute by making them truly dependent on them. The Tandu have had records of their clients sealed. Episiarchs Episiarchs are shaggy quadrupeds that have the ability to temporarily alter reality by force of will, and are used to open short-lived portals that allow Tandu ships to travel instantly to distant parts of the universe, giving them nearly unmatched strategic speed. This method of travel is not popular among other starfaring races because of the risk involved, as it randomly results in the destruction of entire ships or even fleets. The Episiarchs have other military (and possibly civilian) uses as well, although these are not greatly elaborated upon. In Startide Rising an Episiarch is used to create a temporary dry pathway on waterlogged land so that a party of Tandu infantry may move more easily. Acceptors Acceptors are spider-like creatures that have the ability to psionically \\"see\\" the universe around them in great detail and clarity, that is, they \\"accept\\" data at a quantum level at great range. They are used by the Tandu as living sensors. Incrementors Incrementors have only appeared in the book Contacting Aliens: An Illustrated Guide To David Brin's Uplift Universe and may be later changed. Incrementors were the Tandu's first Client race, their being listed last in formal introductions likely indicates a demotion in status. They resemble multi-legged dandelions with sensory nodules circling below a globe of soft fuzz. They are likely Psi-adepts like the rest of the Tandu client races. How they serve the Tandu is unknown.  Technology and relationship with Earthclan  In the novel Startide Rising, a Tandu warship used a probability engine, directed by an Episiarch, to leap into the middle of an enemy formation. The ship created a great deal of destruction, before the Tandu ship ceased to have ever existed. The risks of this probability drive deter most non Tandu races from using such technology. The Tandu have fought several minor skirmishes with the Earth Confederation. They are described as being extremely dangerous enemies, often winning even when the numerical odds favored the humans. This may not necessarily say all that much about their prowess, as humans in this universe are an extremely weak race, but more advanced alien species seem to respect their abilities. The Tandu are organized as a raiding force and use mostly Battlecruiser-like ships with great speed and firepower but poor protection that rely mostly on not getting hit for their survival. A Tandu light destroyer was described as being equipped with \\"antimatter beams\\", possibly antiparticle beams or possibly more exotic antimatter/matter conversion weapons.

Still others claim that \\"Swamp Yankees\\" had ancestors who fought in the Great Swamp Fight of King Philip's War.
