Biography Nof was born Akiva Naparstek' in Tel Aviv during the Mandate era. He studied international relations, Middle Eastern studies and law at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem. He was certified as a lawyer, and also studied at the Institute of Social Studies in The Hague. Political career Having joined Herut, he became chairman of the party's youth leadership.Akiva Nof: Public activities Knesset In 1965 he left the party to establish the Free Centre, serving as its secretary and organisational co-ordinator between 1967 and 1969. He was elected to the Knesset on the Likud list (an alliance of Herut, the Liberal Party, the Free Centre, the National List and the Movement for Greater Israel) in 1973. On 26 October 1976 he and Shmuel Tamir left Likud to establish the Free Centre as an independent faction. Both resigned from the Knesset on 22 January 1977, with Nof being replaced by Amal Nasser el-Din. Having joined the new Democratic Movement for Change in 1977, Nof returned to the Knesset following the May 1977 elections. When the party split in 1978 he joined the Democratic Movement, before defecting to Ahva on 17 September 1980. On 28 January the following year he returned to Likud, and was re-elected on its list in the elections later that year. He lost his seat in the 1984 elections. During his three terms in the Knesset, Nof served, among other duties, as the chairman of the forming committee for the \\"Israeli Law Courts\\" bill. He was prominent in legislative initiatives regarding social issues such as retirees' fair pay, gender equality regarding children's custody of divorced couples, smoking prohibition in public spaces, correction of taxation inconsistencies, prevention of marriage of minors, as well as prevention of corruption in public enterprises. He also served as a member of public boards of directors, such as the Seniors' Services Association, the Bible Museum, Independence House and the Haifa Symphony. Nof also served as an internal adjudicator at the Histadrut, at the Legal Bar Association and at the Composers and Writers Association. By filing lawsuits, Nof instigated some principle-setting court rulings, such as mandatory provision for handicap access to entertainment venues, prohibition of political censorship of works of art broadcast on radio and television. Music and writing Nof composed and wrote popular songs and hits for leading performers including HaGashash HaHiver. His song Izevel (about Jezebel) was a number one hit in 1972. As a student in the Netherlands in the 1960s, while working as a freelance reporter for Kol Israel, Nof interviewed John Lennon and Yoko Ono during their Bed-In. At the end of the interview, Lennon sang a verse from Nof's song Oath for Jerusalem, which Nof transcribed for him into Latin characters. Nof has published two poetry and song books titled Longing For The Past, and Pleasure Comes For Ever.

Krishnaswamy Iyer. He was moved by the social conditions around him to make reform oriented films. Balayogini (lit. Child Saint) was made to expose the plight and suffering of widows in middle class Brahmin communities in Tamil Nadu. Subramanyam produced this film under his \\"Madras United Artists Corporation\\" banner to express his criticism of the existing social norms and his disapproval of priesthood. A progressive film-maker, Frontline Magazine 03-16 July 2004 He wrote the story, screenplay & dialogues and directed it himself. He cast his niece Saroja as the titular character. The film was started in 1936 and released in 1937. The completed film was 19,000 feet (210 minutes runtime) in length. Plot Sarasa's (K. R. Chellam) father is arrested by Police for being a debtor. She goes to the sub collector's (K. B. Vatsal) house to ask for help. The collector's widowed sister Janaki and her niece (Baby Saroja) take pity on her. They are driven out of the house by the angry collector. They take refuge in the house of their low-caste servant Munuswamy. Munuswamy dies and Janaki cares for his children as her own.

Overexploitation, also called overharvesting, refers to harvesting a renewable resource to the point of diminishing returns. Continued overexploitation can lead to the destruction of the resource. The term applies to natural resources such as: wild medicinal plants, grazing pastures, game animals, fish stocks, forests, and water aquifers. In ecology, overexploitation describes one of the five main activities threatening global biodiversity. Ecologists use the term to describe populations that are harvested at a rate that is unsustainable, given their natural rates of mortality and capacities for reproduction. This can result in extinction at the population level and even extinction of whole species. In conservation biology the term is usually used in the context of human economic activity that involves the taking of biological resources, or organisms, in larger numbers than their populations can withstand.Oxford. (1996). Oxford Dictionary of Biology. Oxford University Press. The term is also used and defined somewhat differently in fisheries, hydrology and natural resource management. Overexploitation can lead to resource destruction, including extinctions. However it is also possible for overexploitation to be sustainable, as discussed below in the section on fisheries. In the context of fishing, the term overfishing can be used instead of overexploitation, as can overgrazing in stock management, overlogging in forest management, overdrafting in aquifer management, and endangered species in species monitoring. Overexploitation is not an activity limited to humans. Introduced predators and herbivores, for example, can overexploit native flora and fauna. History When the giant flightless birds called moa were overexploited to the point of extinction, the giant Haast's eagle that preyed on them also became extinct. Concern about overexploitation is relatively recent, though overexploitation itself is not a new phenomenon. It has been observed for millennia. For example, ceremonial cloaks worn by the Hawaiian kings were made from the mamo bird; a single cloak used the feathers of 70,000 birds of this now-extinct species. The dodo, a flightless bird from Mauritius, is another well-known example of overexploitation. As with many island species, it was naive about certain predators, allowing humans to approach and kill it with ease. From the earliest of times, hunting has been an important human activity as a means of survival. There is a whole history of overexploitation in the form of overhunting. The overkill hypothesis (Quaternary extinction events) explains why the megafaunal extinctions occurred within a relatively short period of time. This can be traced with human migration. The most convincing evidence of this theory is that 80% of the North American large mammal species disappeared within 1000 years of the arrival of humans on the western hemisphere continents.Paul S. Martin The fastest ever recorded extinction of megafauna occurred in New Zealand, where by 1500 AD, just 200 years after settling the islands, ten species of the giant moa birds were hunted to extinction by the Māori. A second wave of extinctions occurred later with European settlement. In more recent times, overexploitation has resulted in the gradual emergence of the concepts of sustainability and sustainable development, which has built on other concepts, such as sustainable yield, eco-development and deep ecology. Overview Overexploitation does not necessarily lead to the destruction of the resource, nor is it necessarily unsustainable. However, depleting the numbers or amount of the resource can change its quality. For example, footstool palm is a wild palm tree found in Southeast Asia. Its leaves are used for thatching and food wrapping, and overharvesting has resulted in its leaf size becoming smaller. Tragedy of the commons Cows on Selsley Common. The tragedy of the commons is a useful parable for understanding how overexploitation can occur. In 1968, the journal Science published an article by Garrett Hardin entitled \\"The Tragedy of the Commons\\". Also available at http://www.garretthardinsociety.org/articles/art_tragedy_of_the_commons.html. It was based on a parable that William Forster Lloyd published in 1833 to explain how individuals innocently acting in their own self interest can overexploit, and destroy, a resource that they all share. Lloyd described a simplified hypothetical situation based on medieval land tenure in Europe. Herders share common land on which they are each entitled to graze their cows. In Hardin's article, it is in each herder's individual interest to graze each new cow that the herder acquires on the common land, even if the carrying capacity of the common is exceeded, which damages the common for all the herders. The self-interested herder receives all of the benefits of having the additional cow, while all the herders share the damage to the common. However, all herders reach the same rational decision to buy additional cows and graze them on the common, which eventually destroys the common. Hardin concludes: > Therein is the tragedy. Each man is locked into a system that compels him to > increase his herd without limit—in a world that is limited. Ruin is the > destination toward which all men rush, each pursuing his own interest in a > society that believes in the freedom of the commons. Freedom in a commons > brings ruin to all. In the course of his essay, Hardin develops the theme, drawing in many examples of latter day commons, such as national parks, the atmosphere, oceans, rivers and fish stocks. The example of fish stocks had led some to call this the \\"tragedy of the fishers\\". A major theme running through the essay is the growth of human populations, with the Earth's finite resources being the general common. The tragedy of the commons has intellectual roots tracing back to Aristotle, who noted that \\"what is common to the greatest number has the least care bestowed upon it\\", as well as to Hobbes and his Leviathan. The opposite situation to a tragedy of the commons is sometimes referred to as a tragedy of the anticommons: a situation in which rational individuals, acting separately, collectively waste a given resource by underutilizing it. The tragedy of the commons can be avoided if it is appropriately regulated. Hardin's use of \\"commons\\" has frequently been misunderstood, leading Hardin to later remark that he should have titled his work \\"The tragedy of the unregulated commons\\". Fisheries The Atlantic bluefin tuna is currently seriously overexploited. Scientists say 7,500 tons annually is the sustainable limit, yet the fishing industry continue to harvest 60,000 tons. In wild fisheries, overexploitation or overfishing occurs when a fish stock has been fished down \\"below the size that, on average, would support the long-term maximum sustainable yield of the fishery\\".NOAA: FishWatch glossary Retrieved 2 February 2010. However, overexploitation can be sustainable.[Source?] When a fishery starts harvesting fish from a previously unexploited stock, the biomass of the fish stock will decrease, since harvesting means fish are being removed. For sustainability, the rate at which the fish replenish biomass through reproduction must balance the rate at which the fish are being harvested. If the harvest rate is increased, then the stock biomass will further decrease. At a certain point, the maximum harvest yield that can be sustained will be reached, and further attempts to increase the harvest rate will result in the collapse of the fishery. This point is called the maximum sustainable yield, and in practice, usually occurs when the fishery has been fished down to about 30% of the biomass it had before harvesting started.Bolden, E.G., Robinson, W.L. (1999), Wildlife ecology and management 4th ed. Prentice-Hall, Inc. Upper Saddle River, NJ. It is possible to fish the stock down further to, say, 15% of the pre-harvest biomass, and then adjust the harvest rate so the biomass remains at that level. In this case, the fishery is sustainable, but is now overexploited, because the stock has been run down to the point where the sustainable yield is less than it could be. Fish stocks are said to \\"collapse\\" if their biomass declines by more than 95 percent of their maximum historical biomass. Atlantic cod stocks were severely overexploited in the 1970s and 1980s, leading to their abrupt collapse in 1992. Even though fishing has ceased, the cod stocks have failed to recover. The absence of cod as the apex predator in many areas has led to trophic cascades. About 25% of world fisheries are now overexploited to the point where their current biomass is less than the level that maximizes their sustainable yield. These depleted fisheries can often recover if fishing pressure is reduced until the stock biomass returns to the optimal biomass. At this point, harvesting can be resumed near the maximum sustainable yield. The tragedy of the commons can be avoided within the context of fisheries if fishing effort and practices are regulated appropriately by fisheries management. One effective approach may be assigning some measure of ownership in the form of individual transferable quotas (ITQs) to fishermen. In 2008, a large scale study of fisheries that used ITQs, and ones that did not, provided strong evidence that ITQs help prevent collapses and restore fisheries that appear to be in decline. New Scientist: Guaranteed fish quotas halt commercial free-for-allA Rising Tide: Scientists find proof that privatising fishing stocks can avert a disaster The Economist, 18th Sept, 2008. Water resources Overexploitation of groundwater from an aquifer can result in a peak water curve. Water resources, such as lakes and aquifers, are usually renewable resources which naturally recharge (the term fossil water is sometimes used to describe aquifers which do not recharge). Overexploitation occurs if a water resource, such as the Ogallala Aquifer, is mined or extracted at a rate that exceeds the recharge rate, that is, at a rate that exceeds the practical sustained yield. Recharge usually comes from area streams, rivers and lakes. An aquifer which has been overexploited is said to be overdrafted or depleted. Forests enhance the recharge of aquifers in some locales, although generally forests are a major source of aquifer depletion. Depleted aquifers can become polluted with contaminants such as nitrates, or permanently damaged through subsidence or through saline intrusion from the ocean. This turns much of the world's underground water and lakes into finite resources with peak usage debates similar to oil. These debates usually centre around agriculture and suburban water usage but generation of electricity from nuclear energy or coal and tar sands mining is also water resource intensive.http://www.epa.gov/cleanrgy/water_resource.htm A modified Hubbert curve applies to any resource that can be harvested faster than it can be replaced. Though Hubbert's original analysis did not apply to renewable resources, their overexploitation can result in a Hubbert-like peak. This has led to the concept of peak water. Forest resources Clear cutting of old growth forests in Canada. Forests are overexploited when they are logged at a rate faster than reforestation takes place. Reforestation competes with other land uses such as food production, livestock grazing, and living space for further economic growth. Historically utilization of forest products, including timber and fuel wood, have played a key role in human societies, comparable to the roles of water and cultivable land. Today, developed countries continue to utilize timber for building houses, and wood pulp for paper. In developing countries almost three billion people rely on wood for heating and cooking.http://atlas.aaas.org/pdf/63-66.pdf Forest Products Short- term economic gains made by conversion of forest to agriculture, or overexploitation of wood products, typically leads to loss of long-term income and long term biological productivity. West Africa, Madagascar, Southeast Asia and many other regions have experienced lower revenue because of overexploitation and the consequent declining timber harvests. Biodiversity The rich diversity of marine life inhabiting coral reefs attracts bioprospectors. Many coral reefs are overexploited; threats include coral mining, cyanide and blast fishing, and overfishing in general. Overexploitation is one of the main threats to global biodiversity. Other threats include pollution, introduced and invasive species, habitat fragmentation, habitat destruction, uncontrolled hybridization, global warming, ocean acidification and the driver behind many of these, human overpopulation. One of the key health issues associated with biodiversity is drug discovery and the availability of medicinal resources.(2006) \\"Molecular Pharming\\" GMO Compass Retrieved November 5, 2009, From A significant proportion of drugs are natural products derived, directly or indirectly, from biological sources. Marine ecosystems are of particular interest in this regard. However, unregulated and inappropriate bioprospecting could potentially lead to overexploitation, ecosystem degradation and loss of biodiversity. Endangered species It is not just humans that overexploit resources. Overgrazing can be caused by native fauna, as shown in the upper right. However, past human overexploitation (leading to elimination of some predators) may be behind the situation. Overexploitation threatens one-third of endangered vertebrates, as well as other groups. Excluding edible fish, the illegal trade in wildlife is valued at $10 billion per year. Industries responsible for this include the trade in bushmeat, the trade in Chinese medicine, and the fur trade.Hemley 1994. The Convention for International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora, or CITES was set up in order to control and regulate the trade in endangered animals. It currently protects, to a varying degree, some 33,000 species of animals and plants. It is estimated that a quarter of the endangered vertebrates in the United States of America and half of the endangered mammals is attributed to overexploitation. All living organisms require resources to survive. Overexploitation of these resources for protracted periods can deplete natural stocks to the point where they are unable to recover within a short time frame. Humans have always harvested food and other resources they have needed to survive. Human populations, historically, were small, and methods of collection limited to small quantities. With an exponential increase in human population, expanding markets and increasing demand, combined with improved access and techniques for capture, are causing the exploitation of many species beyond sustainable levels.Redford 1992, Fitzgibon et al. 1995, Cuarón 2001. In practical terms, if continued, it reduces valuable resources to such low levels that their exploitation is no longer sustainable and can lead to the extinction of a species, in addition to having dramatic, unforeseen effects, on the ecosystem. Overexploitation often occurs rapidly as markets open, utilising previously untapped resources, or locally used species. The Carolina parakeet was hunted to extinction. Today, overexploitation and misuse of natural resources is an ever-present threat for species richness. This is more prevalent when looking at island ecology and the species that inhabit them, as islands can be viewed as the world in miniature. Island endemic populations are more prone to extinction from overexploitation, as they often exist at low densities with reduced reproductive rates. A good example of this are island snails, such as the Hawaiian Achatinella and the French Polynesian Partula. Achatinelline snails have 15 species listed as extinct and 24 critically endangered while 60 species of partulidae are considered extinct with 14 listed as critically endangered. The WCMC have attributed over- collecting and very low lifetime fecundity for the extreme vulnerability exhibited among these species.WCMC. (1992). McComb, J., Groombridge, B., Byford, E., Allan, C., Howland, J., Magin, C., Smith, H., Greenwood, V. and Simpson, L. (1992). World Conservation Monitoring Centre. Chapman and Hall. As another example, when the humble hedgehog was introduced to the Scottish island of Uist, the population greatly expanded and took to consuming and overexploiting shorebird eggs, with drastic consequences for their breeding success. Twelve species of avifauna are affected, with some species numbers being reduced by 39%. Where there is substantial human migration, civil unrest, or war, controls may no longer exist. With civil unrest, for example in the Congo and Rwanda, firearms have become common and the breakdown of food distribution networks in such countries leaves the resources of the natural environment vulnerable. Animals are even killed as target practice, or simply to spite the government. Populations of large primates, such as gorillas and chimpanzees, ungulates and other mammals, may be reduced by 80% or more by hunting, and certain species may be eliminated altogether. This decline has been called the bushmeat crisis. Overall, 50 bird species that have become extinct since 1500 (approximately 40% of the total) have been subject to overexploitation,The LUCN Red List of Threatened Species (2009). including: * Great Auk – the penguin-like bird of the north, was hunted for its feathers, meat, fat and oil. * Carolina parakeet – The only parrot species native to the eastern United States, was hunted for crop protection and its feathers. Other species affected by overexploitation include: * The international trade in fur: chinchilla, vicuña, giant otter and numerous cat species * Insect collectors: butterflies * Horticulturists: New Zealand mistletoe (Trilepidia adamsii), orchids, cacti and many other plant species * Shell collectors: Marine molluscs * Aquarium hobbyists: tropical fish * Chinese medicine: bears, tigers, rhinos, seahorses, Asian black bear and saiga antelope * Novelty pets: snakes, parrots, primates and big cats Cascade effects Overexploiting sea otters resulted in cascade effects which destroyed kelp forest ecosystems. Overexploitation of species can result in knock-on or cascade effects. This can particularly apply if, through overexploitation, a habitat loses its apex predator. Because of the loss of the top predator, a dramatic increase in their prey species can occur. In turn, the unchecked prey can then overexploit their own food resources until population numbers dwindle, possibly to the point of extinction. A classic example of cascade effects occurred with sea otters. Starting before the 17th century and not phased out until 1911, sea otters were hunted aggressively for their exceptionally warm and valuable pelts, which could fetch up to $2500 US. This caused cascade effects through the kelp forest ecosystems along the Pacific Coast of North America. One of the sea otters’ primary food sources is the sea urchin. When hunters caused sea otter populations to decline, an ecological release of sea urchin populations occurred. The sea urchins then overexploited their main food source, kelp, creating urchin barrens, areas of seabed denuded of kelp, but carpeted with urchins. No longer having food to eat, the sea urchin became locally extinct as well. Also, since kelp forest ecosystems are homes to many other species, the loss of the kelp caused other cascade effects of secondary extinctions. In 1911, when only one small group of 32 sea otters survived in a remote cove, an international treaty was signed to prevent further exploitation of the sea otters. Under heavy protection, the otters multiplied and repopulated the depleted areas, which slowly recovered. More recently, with declining numbers of fish stocks, again due to overexploitation, killer whales have experienced a food shortage and have been observed feeding on sea otters, again reducing their numbers.

RTE Television, 1978 He joined the nationalist militia, the Irish Volunteers in 1913 and the following year, though only fifteen, was involved in the smuggling of arms into Ireland.https://www.google.com/books/edition/The_Irish_Civil_War_1922_23/2m6ICwAAQBAJ?hl=en&gbpv;=1Peter Cottrell, The Irish Civil War, p. 60 Military career First World War Dalton joined the British Army in 1915 for the duration of the Great War. His decision was not that unusual among Irish Volunteers, as over 20,000 of the National Volunteers joined the British New Army on the urgings of Nationalist leader John Redmond. Dalton's father, however, disagreed with his son's decision. Emmet Dalton initially joined the 7th battalion of the Royal Dublin Fusiliers (RDF) as a temporary 2nd Lieutenant.https://www.thegazette.co.uk/London/issue/29432/supplement/421 By 1916 he was attached to the 9th Battalion, RDF, 16th (Irish) Division under Major-General William Hickie, which contained many Irish nationalist recruits. During the Battle of the Somme in September 1916, Dalton was involved in bloody fighting during the Battle of Ginchy, in which over 4,000 Irishmen were killed or wounded. Among the casualties was Tom Kettle, a former nationalist Member of Parliament and personal friend of Dalton's father and of Emmet. Dalton was awarded the Military Cross for his conduct in the battle.https://www.thegazette.co.uk/London/issue/29793/supplement/10179Neil Richardson, \\"A Coward If I Return, A Hero If I Fall: Stories of Irishmen in World War I\\", (Dublin 2010), p.333. Afterwards he was transferred to the 6th Battalion, Leinster Regiment, and sent to Salonika then Palestine, where he commanded a company and then supervised a sniper school in El Arish. In 1918 Dalton was re-deployed again to France, and in July promoted to Captain, serving as an instructor.Cottrell p. 60–61  Irish War of Independence  On demobilisation in April 1919, Dalton returned to Ireland. There, finding that his younger brother Charlie had joined the IRA, Dalton himself followed suit. Dalton later commented on the apparent contradiction of fighting both with and against the British Army by saying that he had fought for Ireland with the British and fought for Ireland against them.Cottrell p. 60–61 He became close to Michael Collins and rose swiftly to become IRA Director of Intelligence – and was involved in the Squad, the Dublin-based assassination unit. On 14 May 1921, Dalton led an operation with Paddy Daly that Dalton and Collins had devised. It was designed to rescue Gen. Sean McEoin from Mountjoy Prison using a hijacked British armoured car and two of Dalton's old British Army uniforms.  Irish Civil War  Dalton followed Collins in accepting the Anglo-Irish Treaty in 1922 and was one of the first officers – a Major General – in the new National Army established by the Irish Provisional Government of the Irish Free State. The Treaty was opposed by much of the IRA and Civil War between pro and anti-treaty factions eventually resulted. Dalton was in command of troops assaulting the Four Courts in the Battle of Dublin which marked the start of the war in June 1922. At Collins' instigation Dalton, as Military liaison officer with the British during the truce, took control of the two 18 pounder guns from the British that were trained on the buildings. He became commander of the Free State Army under Mulcahy's direction. He was behind the Irish Free State offensive of July–August 1922 that dislodged the Anti-Treaty fighters from the towns of Munster. Dalton proposed seaborne landings to take the Anti-Treaty positions from the rear and he commanded one such naval landing that took Cork city in early August. In spite of firm loyalty to the National Army, he was critical of the Free State's failure to follow up its victory, allowing the Anti-Treaty IRA to regroup resuming the guerrilla warfare started in 1919.Cottrell p. 63 Emmet Dalton and Alice Shannon following their wedding in October 1922 On 22 August 1922, he accompanied Michael Collins in convoy, touring rural west Cork. The convoy was ambushed near Béal na Bláth and Collins was killed in the firefight. Dalton had advised him to drive on, but Collins, who was not an experienced combat veteran, insisted on stopping to fight.Charles Townshend, \\"The Republic: The Fight For Independence\\" (Dublin 2013/14)Richardson, p.333. Dalton was married shortly afterwards (on 9 October 1922 to Alice Shannon) in Cork's Imperial Hotel. By December 1922 he had resigned his command in the Army. He did not agree with the execution of republican prisoners that marked the latter stages of the Civil War. After briefly working as clerk of the Irish Senate, he left this job to work in the movie industry. Film industry Over the following forty years, he worked in Ireland and the US in film production. In 1958 he founded Irish Ardmore Studios in Bray. His company helped produce films such as The Blue Max, The Spy Who Came in from the Cold and The Lion in Winter, all of which were filmed in Ireland.Cottrell p. 63 His daughter is Irish actress Audrey Dalton.https://www.irishtimes.com/culture/books/emmet-dalton-a-revolutionary- with-a-second-act-1.2017481 Death Emmet Dalton died in his daughter Nuala's house in Dublin in 1978 on his 80th birthday, never having seen the film that Cathal O'Shannon of RTÉ had made on his life. During the making of the film they visited the battlefields in France (including Ginchy and Guillemont on the Somme), Kilworth Camp in Cork, Béal Na Bláth, and other places that Dalton had not visited since his earlier years. He wished to be buried as near as possible to his friend Michael Collins in Glasnevin Cemetery in Dublin and was buried there in March 1978 after a military funeral. None of the ruling Fianna Fail government ministers or TDs attended.

Previously in Roman history the war and the command structure would have been straightforward: the Senate would declare war, and the mandate to carry it out would be assigned to one of the two consuls elected for the year, with both being assigned if necessary, and ex-consuls being available as generals with the rank of proconsul. For a small war the consul might give the task to an immediate subordinate, a praetor, or if the task was small enough, a legate. Beginning in the times of the Mithridatic Wars, the mandates and the chains of command were complicated by a second, parallel series of conflicts, the Roman civil wars. The tension between the Patricians and the Plebeians had produced a system of two parties: the Populares and the Optimates. The government itself was bicameral. The Senate was a body of officials appointed from the senatorial class. Its purpose was to issue decrees, which were to be carried out by the two consuls, who were elected magistrates. Elections were performed and laws were passed by the Roman assemblies, of which there were different types. They were considered to be the populus, \\"people\\", in the formula SPQR (\\"senate and people of Rome\\"). The people were considered to be represented in particular by another class of elected magistrate, the Tribunes, who could intercede in the decrees of the Senate. Gradually the opposition developed that would lead to the end of the Republic.Plutarch termed the opposition \\"the secret disease from which the state had long been suffering.\\" The tribunes were primarily populares. They relied for their authority on the laws of the assemblies. The consuls and praetors were primarily optimates. They took their authority from the Senate. Until the times of the Mithridatic Wars, the system seems to have been operative, supported by the custom of making an informal agreement, English \\"deal,\\" featuring a quid pro quo, \\"something for something,\\" for each side. Livy's basic word for this arrangement is a verb, convenire, \\"come together\\". AppianCivil Wars, Book I, \\"Introduction\\" explains in Greek that in the period of the civil wars, this arrangement ceased to be effective: the magistrates attacked each other with all the resources at their command. Thus Sulla's forces going east in 87 BC to fight the Mithridatic war were faced with additional problems. The government on which they should have been able to rely for support was paralyzed by civil conflict of magistrate against magistrate. It was not always clear who was subordinate to whom and what their mandates were. Some Greek inscriptions found by archaeologists suggest a more precise view of the chain of command than can be gleaned from the historians. However the information from inscriptions is limited. For instance, in most cases the dates of the inscriptions are not known exactly. Only tentative conclusions can be drawn from them. Format of the inscriptions Management of the Greek inscriptions Knowledge of ancient Greek inscriptions (as well as Latin ones) has been growing in parallel to archaeological data since the beginning of the 19th century. The first efforts at recapturing them were drawings included with sketches of the monuments on which they occur, As the inscriptions themselves became targets for collection and an art of assembling fragments grew the rubbing became the preferred form of reproduction and publication. It was for the most part supplanted by just copying the letters as they appear. At the same time a need was recognized to catalog the many thousands of inscriptions that began to be reconstructed and collected primarily by museums of various agencies public and private. =IG and SEG= Now inscriptional material is a prime target of any excavation. The inscriptions have been numbered and systematized by location and type. The standard reference in which they have been published is by international convention named Inscriptiones Graecae, abbreviated in citations by IG or IG2 for the second edition. There are many volumes by different scholars for different regions. Some are available by downloading from the Internet; others are new or are being republished and are under Copyright Law. In a more recent development, inscriptions from these volumes are being translated by various agencies and are available online. There have been several other attempts to develop reference works of Greek inscriptions, sometimes by medium, such as on vases, or on clay tablets, and sometimes by type, such as decrees or on monuments. Each reference has its abbreviation, organization, and numbering system. A common term in use is \\"supplement,\\" as in Supplementum Epigraphicum Graecum (SEG), which publishes newly discovered inscriptions. Many inscriptions are published in different systems and thus might be referenced in literature under different numbers. In that case there is usually a Concordance correlating inscriptions numbers in one system with numbers in another. =Honorific inscriptions of the Mithridatic War= The inscriptions selected for this article are mainly monumental and honorific: they are the Tituli, or identifiers on the bases of statues erected by a local municipality in Greece to honor some Roman commander or governor. The times are generally the periods of the First and Second Mithridatic Wars. The Third Mithridatic War is later, more widespread, and brought about more fundamental changes. The main inscription under consideration is the one from Rhodes, considered first. Other inscriptions are brought in in support of it. A few inscriptions are coin legends. The inscriptions for the most part come from the relevant volume of the IG. These volumes typically include rubbings, which are then represented by capital letters, or majuscules, which in those times were the only graphemes available to the ancient Greeks. The small letters, or minuscules, were not invented until the Middle Ages; that is, an ancient Greek would not have been able to read the Greek so familiar to those who read it today. Rubbings are generally represented in text by majuscules. Typically (but not always) there are no spaces or other white space between words. The modern transliteration may be given instead, or in addition, with brackets around reconstructed or missing text. All text comes from Internet resources. Translations are also from the Internet. Minor variations between sources are to be expected. Language of the inscriptions Ancient Greek dialects The language portrays a mixture of Hellenic and Latin cultural elements, with Hellenic predominating. All modern classifications of Ancient Greek dialects recognize a general division into East Greek and West Greek, formally presented as that by Carl Darling Buck. In general, the West Greek pronunciation retains the originals of sounds that have changed in East Greek; for example, an original \\"a\\" instead of an Attic-Ionic \\"e.\\" West Greek speakers extended through Central Greece, the Peloponnesus, Crete, Rhodes, a small region of the coast of Anatolia, and on the west southern Italy, including Sicily. At the beginning of the Hellenistic period, the center of dominance of the West Greek speakers was Macedon. After a long and hard-fought conflict Rome extended its power over them. Once defeated they tended to be docile and loyal to Rome. This was the culture on which Sulla was able to rely in the first two Mithridatic Wars. East Greek was centered on the city of Athens, always the largest of Greece. It included the islands of the Aegean and the more northern coast of Anatolia. From a linguistic point of view, the language of Boeotia (originally Aeolic as opposed to Attic-Ionic and Doric) was East Greek also, but politically the Boeotians sided with the West Greeks against Athens, once its rival. Remembering the days of the Delian League Athens resented Roman rule, being quick to instigate a Greek revolt in favor of Mithridates. It is true that in Roman times Attic-Ionic had become Koine Greek, a common language of the Eastern Mediterranean, which was to supplant the earlier dialects and become modern Greek. In the 1st century BC, however, the dialects were still spoken locally. They appear in the inscriptions. Thus the inscription at Rhodes was West Greek, or \\"Doric.\\" The honorific monuments were erected by West Greek speakers, eager to assert loyalty to Rome. The vocabulary is of mixed cultures. Sometimes the Greek word translates the Latin, such as tamias for quaestor. If no Greek equivalent exists, one is likely to be innovated, such as antitamias for proquaestor. The Greeks had no native promagistrates. A Latin word may be spelled with Greek letters, such as imperator, which also appears translated as stratagos. Statue of an envoy to the Romans at Rhodes Text of the inscription View of the city of Rhodes from inside the wall of the mediaeval city to the ancient acropolis on the other side of the wall. The Turkish cemetery is on the other side of the wall to the left, out of view. Colossus stood, already at the bottom long since due to an earthquake. City of Rhodes in 1865 This inscription is from the lower half of a statue-base found in a suburb of the city of Rhodes located on the northern tip of the island of Rhodes in a garden near the Turkish cemetery, just to the south of the mediaeval city. The latter did not then exist, but was the port of a larger Hellenistic city. It was the capital of the Rhodian Republic, which included holdings in Anatolia, notably Kaunos in Caria. As the republic was a friend and ally of Rome, it and Kaunos served as a refuge for Romans during the troubles of the First Mithridatic War. The port sheltered what was left of the fleet and served as a collection point and haven for the new fleet commanded by Lucullus. The inscription was published by IG in 1895 (which gives it the inscription code \\"IG XII 1 48\\") by Friedrich Hiller von Gaertringen.. Includes the rubbing and a transliteration with reconstruction. For a second reconstruction see SIG³ 745 = . Hiller explains that the rubbing was the work of Robert Koldeway, published in 1894. He accepts Mommen's dates of not before 82 BC, when Murena was made Commander of Asia, and not after 74 BC, when Lucullus was made Consul in Asia. The inscription was found in two pieces, Lapis A (\\"Stone A\\") and Lapis B. Lapis A has only one comprehensible word. The language is in a dialect of ancient Greek, Doric Greek, which is evident in the Greek spelling; for example, stratagos for Attic strategos. In this document a certain Dionysios son of Lysanias commends a Rhodian benefactor (name lost) to the Gods after recounting various (lost) benefactions and public services performed by him. Apparently the Rhodian envoy of the monument was sent by the Rhodian free state a number of times as an emissary to the Romans, whom it supported and assisted in every way. The signature by the sculptor is one of the few known of his. Commanders mentioned in the inscription The recipients of these ambassadorial visits are five senior Roman commanders:For brevity these names are given in inscriptional form, as is the custom in the IG. Inscriptions use a lot of abbreviations, such as SPQR. L. Cornelius L. f. pro. cos. stands for Lucius Cornelius Lucii filius Proconsul where L. f. is a patronymic. For a look-up of abbreviations refer to List of classical abbreviations. Oddly enough, this inscription contains no abbreviations. * L. Cornelius L. f. Sulla, pro cos. and commander-in-chief * L. Cornelius L. f. Lentulus, pro cos. * L. Licinius L. f. Murena, imperator * L. Licinius L. f. Lucullus, proquaestor * A. Terentius A. f. Varro, legate Use of the term \\"commander\\" in the inscriptions (Imperator in Latin, stratagos in Doric Greek) is consistent with the terminology adopted by most modern militaries: he is the officer in charge, who has the authority to issue commands. A duty command is not the same thing as a rank. The commander of a facility outranks any visiting officer, even though the visitor might be of higher rank. In the inscription, Sulla and Murena are both imperatores, but not at the same time. Murena merits the term because Sulla left him in command to return to Rome. This assignment gave him the legal right to attack Mithridates, who was still legally at war with Rome, even though ordered not to do so by Sulla. A second practice of ancient Rome adopted by modern militaries is supersession. If two officers are assigned the same command, the higher-ranking one assumes command, while the other must yield to his authority. For example, Sura was conducting operations under his own command in Central Greece. He was superseded by Sulla on notification by Lucullus. He then had to obey Sulla's legal command to report back to his Macedonian commander. Fimbria in Asia Minor was superseded the moment Sulla set foot in his command. A refusal to obey would be an act of civil war. The men in these cases had much more power than most soldiers today. Mutiny was more common than it is today. Fimbria's men refused to back him in civil war. Sulla at one point is said to have had to totally ignore the murder of an officer, pretending that it never happened.This custom reached anarchic extremes during some years of the empire, when the men would ratify or not ratify the Senate's choice of an emperor by welcoming or murdering the new emperor on his first visit to their camp. The centuriones, the commanders of 100 (company commanders), were also key officers. They stood in a conspicuous place near their company in the line of battle. It was they who were in direct contact with the men, and who listened to their complaints, tallied their votes, and spoke for them in a mutiny. Most mutinies were settled by negotiation and agreement. Typically they involved the execution of the most vociferous rebel or rebels as scapegoats. The higher-ranking commanders, such as those listed in the inscription, ignored the centurions at their own risk. Usually they bought their loyalty with higher pay or a higher share of the booty. Sulla was known for his generosity, which bought him the loyalty of the entire army. To obtain the money for this price he took to plundering first the temples and then the expensive art objects of Greece and Asia Minor, a practice followed by all succeeding commanders, regardless of partisanship. =Sulla= Bust of Sulla. Sulla is readily identifiable as the strategos, the \\"general\\" in charge, with the rank of proconsul. He had been elected consul for 88 BC and was assigned the Mithridatic War by lot, but his involvement in Sulla's first civil war that year prevented him from assuming command of the eastern front, and the next year he was not consul. He negotiated an arrangement with the consuls for 87 BC using the power acquired from his victory in the civil war (the head of one enemy magistrate decorated the Roman forum while the other went visiting the Africans to avoid losing his). They would keep their heads and have Sulla's good will in exchange for their sending him to the east as proconsul still in possession of the mandate. That course required him to command a province, which one of the sources says was Asia. All he had to do to be installed as governor was to take it back from Mithridates. =Lentulus= The next officer in the list, Lucius Cornelius Lentulus, is termed a proconsul as well. However, not only does he not appear in the historians (Plutarch, Appian, Livy, etc.) as a Proconsul, he does not appear there at all, despite the numerous high-ranking magistrates from his family in that century.In classics, Historian is to be distinguished from History. Historians dedicated their work intentionally to history. Other types of writer sometimes dabble in history as well: the geographer, Strabo, the natural scientist, Pliny the Elder, etc. In this case the writer probably identifying this Lentulus is considered an orator, Marcus Tullius Cicero. Furthermore, he is not on the List of Roman consuls. Thus, not having been consul, he could not normally be appointed to be a proconsul. There was such a person: the earliest studies of the inscription (Mommsen and others, 1892-1894) suggest that he was the same as the Lucius Lentulus, a praetor at Rome, to whom Metellus complained of erasures in the roll of citizens in the events leading up to the civil war of 88 BC, as reported by Cicero.Pro Archias, Chapters 5. Appeals of this sort were processed by the Urban Praetor (Praetor urbanus), who was also required to remain in range of the city. Thus as praetor this Lentulus could not have gone with Sulla. If he did, he must have been promoted out of the job. In fact there was an exception to the rule that proconsuls must be ex-consuls, which was exercised in the event that legitimate ex-consuls could not be found, as was the case more frequently in the search for officers qualified to be provincial governors. This case was rediscovered by Adrianus Turnebus at the height of Renaissance scholarship in a study of Cicero's \\"Concerning the Laws\\" (De Legibus). He distinguishes between proconsul, the name of a magistracy, and the phrase pro consule, \\"acting as proconsul\\", as in ex praetura pro consule as opposed to ex consulatu. The Rhodians may not have known the difference, or Sulla did not choose to make it known. Dessau's sources speculate that he was nominally the governor of Cilicia, but none of these governorships were ever occupied. Subsequently, Lentulus vanishes from history, perhaps, Dessau's sources suggest, by death. In the current war he would have been the equivalent of a lieutenant general, sitting with Sulla in the early morning in the headquarters (praetorium) to give the orders of the day to the legionary officers (centurions and legates) as they reported to receive them. He was also available to lead operations at Sulla's direction. =Murena= Lucius Licinius Murena was the father (pater) of a son by the same name also involved in the Civil and Mithridatic Wars. Unlike Lentulus, Murena is an imperator, but not a proconsul, not even ex praetura. Moreover, he cannot be found on the list of consuls, even though his son can. The idea that he was some sort of praetor at Rome, to become pro consule ex praetura is thus unsubstantiated by any evidence.Murena's son was praetor in 65 BC, and consul in 63 BC, the first of his family to reach this rank. He was promptly charged by an election rival with bribery, and was defended in court by Cicero. His former commanding officer, Lucullus, was there as a character witness. Cicero said that Murena, father, and his father, had been honorable praetors at Rome, that the family was plebeian, that the charges were trumped up, and in his view it was high time that the plebeian family were admitted to a Senatorial post (De Murena, Chapter 12). He won. However, the praetorship was not a hereditary position. It had to be won by each office-holder. In the time of his service in Sulla's army as Legate, Murena was far too young and unknown to have been appointed to any praetorship at Rome or anywhere else. He had to earn his opportunity, which he did mainly after 87. The rise of Murena The first history hears of Murena is his behavior before the walls of Athens. Archelaus, reinforced from the sea, sallies out in a surprise attack on Murena's men, who start to retreat precipitously. Murena rallies them and also another legion returning from a wood-cutting expedition. These latter were in disgrace for cowardice. Standing them all against Archelaus, Murena wins the day. Sulla removes the stigma. This was the first indication that Murena was going to be preferred for promotion. His next appearance is in the Battle of Chaeronea (86 BC), as related by Plutarch in Sulla. Intent on maneuvering, Sulla places him in command of somewhat more than a legion used for detached duty. He was to guard against any sudden moves by Archelaus. His rank is not stated, but the duties are those of a legate. He has won Sulla's confidence, as he is later left as provincial governor of Asia Minor when Sulla returns to Italy at the end of the First Mithridatic War in the Spring of 83 BC. It was a promotion Sulla would regret when Murena plunged him into the Second Mithridatic War despite orders to the contrary. Murena's rank just before the promotion was legate, not a senior officer: approximately a colonel, if centurions, or company commanders, were captains and military tribunes were majors.The information is given in a 4th century source, . The Latin is Murenam legatum suum provinciae Valerianisque praefecit. It can be seen that Sulla assigned his legate as commander of the province. There is some evidence that a promotion went with this assignment: he was honored with a triumph in 81 BC as a propraetor (Lieutenant General of an expeditionary force). A Greek source says that the Senate \\"sent him out\\" as hegemon (\\"commander\\"). Whether the contradiction means that he had to return with Sulla in order to receive the command from the Senate, or simply be authorized by the Senate, is not known. He could not have been an honored guest of the Rhodian people before this time, which was 83 BC. Murena as commander of the east The Senatorial version may indicate a more sinister collaboration between themselves and Murena against Sulla. Marius had come back from Africa, and in Sulla's absence, he dominated the political landscape, proscribing all Sulla's friends, which is the main reason, say the main sources, why Sulla was anxious to wind down the war and return to Rome. Sulla was hardly gone before Murena mobilized the Romans in his province to attack Mithridates, starting the Second Mithridatic War. Simultaneously with his campaign, the Senate refused to ratify Sulla's agreement.Mommsen's exculpatory theory was that Murena's obligation to enforce the \\"regulations\\" of the Treaty of Dardanos led him to attack Mithridates. It called for reparations: However, Murena well knew that no such treaty was in effect, that the agreement was only between the two commanders, and that both individuals were calling for him to desist. He had motives, no doubt, but beyond the relief of the Roman colonials in Asia they are not specified. The issue seems to have been bitter feelings over the Asiatic Vespers; the Romans were intent on exacting reparations. Sulla was too lenient for their tastes. They began to plunder Asia Minor. Mithridates wrote to Sulla and the Senate and then withdrew to wait for an answer, of which he had some hope. Sulla had left Lucullus behind, proquaestor again, but now Murena's proquaestor (and Sulla's agent). He found himself in the middle. He was still friends with Mithridates. Although technically working for Murena, he took a sort of vacation, spending his time in philosophy, and in acquiring books and paintings to be sent back to Rome. An emissary was sent from Sulla to Murena requesting that he cease and desist, which he ignored. Mithridates therefore defended his realm. This time he had the measure of the Romans. After a number of contests Murena was forced to retreat to Phrygia. Meanwhile, Marius forced Sulla's hand, trying to kill Sulla and all his adherents. Sulla found it necessary to engage in another civil war, which he won at the Battle of the Colline Gate (82 BC), making himself dictator. Marius had died earlier. A new deal was struck with Mithridates, which the Senate still did not ratify. Murena's rescue Sulla moved to rescue his former subordinate: he sent Aulus Gabinius, then a young officer, to arrest Murena and bring him back to Rome. There Murena received Sulla's traditional clemency, being the only other officer besides Sulla to claim a triumph as a commander in a victorious war. The twin triumphs of 81 BC These fasti are just a list of triumphs with year and participants. 81 BC has two entries, most of which are lost: [L. Cornelius L.f. P.n. Sull]a Felix, dictator, [over king Mithridates,] 4, 3 k.Feb. {27th & 28th January}; [L. Licinius L.f. ... Murena, propraetor, over king Mithridates, ... ] may well have been the occasion of the various honorific statues. Mithridates had a new deal, but it was too late. He began to mobilize for an all-out final offensive. Sulla never saw it, as he died in 78. Murena vanished from history, but the family continued in politics with no dislocation. Lucullus inherited the command in Asia. Murena's son went to work for him. =Lucullus= Representation of a bust of Sulla's Lucullus Lucullus was an important supporter of Sulla, meriting his own article in Plutarch, as well as mention in Plutarch's Sulla, and Appian's Mithridatic Wars. Only some summary annals fail to mention him at all. Even though he receives premier attention from the historians, they fail, somehow, to state explicitly what his position in the Roman army was. For that there are several inscriptions. Lucullus as quaestor and proquaestor His rank in the First and Second Mithridatic Wars, as can be seen in the inscription on the base of the statue of an envoy to the Romans at Rhodes quoted above, was that of Proquaestor, which takes its meaning from Quaestor. just as Proconsul comes from Consul. Officers can only be Consuls and Quaestors for the year at Rome by election. At subsequent times and other places they are Proconsuls and Proquaestors, unless elected again; however, a waiting interim was required, to avoid just such a tenure. If Lucullus was Proquaestor for Proconsul Sulla out of Rome, then the most obvious explanation is that he was Quaestor for Consul Sulla at Rome in 88 BC. By law, the elections for supreme magistrates returned two two-man teams of Consul and Quaestor.The dictatorship of Sulla changed the number of Quaestors allowed per Consul, but he would not be Dictator until 82 BC. The latter term had already been in use at Rome for other purposes. Etymologically it means \\"he who inquires\\", (cognate with the English word \\"inquire\\"). A quaestor was \\"he who inquires after ways and means\\", which at Rome meant primarily treasurer, and out of Rome, Supply Officer. He commanded, for example, the quaestorium, or warehouse, of a camp. The Senate would decide what needed to be done, and allocate specific mandates to the Consuls. The Consuls would look to the Quaestors for ways and means. In war the Consuls became the joint heads of the armed forces in the field. Wherever they went they took command by supersession. As there were only two Consuls, nowhere near enough to assume all the mandates, the Senate was allowed to appoint Proconsuls as field commanders, theoretically under the ultimate command of the current Consuls (not even the Senate always respected that chain of command). In Roman power politics, this work-around was a weak point, especially under Sulla. The Promagistrates using their influence might be able to force some degree of autonomy from the magistrates, especially if they were of a different political party. Family connection was another basis of power. The team of Sulla and Lucullus on campaign was brokered by Sulla in a deal with the Consuls. In such a deal it is unlikely that Sulla would choose anyone but his old teammate, Quaestor Lucullus, now to be Proquaestor. He would certainly not choose one of the current Quaestors, who would be working for the current Consuls, not for him, nor would he have any power at all to install his own Quaestor. It is possible that Lucullus was a Proquaestor from the Social War, but then why would Sulla pass over his Quaestor in favor of someone else's former Quaestor? Whatever the facts were, they were so taken for granted that the historians did not even think they should mention it. There is, however, one exception to the silence of the historians: one mention of a Quaestor, which can hardly be anyone else but Lucullus. It occurs in the context of Sulla's first civil war. Roman society from the outset was divided into tribes, which grew from a few at Rome during foundation to 35 in the 1st century BC in all Italy, excluding the Italian allies, which were independent states. Their loss of the Social War (91-88 BC) left them in uncertain status. If they were to be included as full citizens in the Roman state they needed to be organized into tribes, as all voting for office was done by the Tribal Assembly at Rome, composed of representatives from each tribe. The optimates and the populares collaborated to win the Social War, but after it their platforms on the disposition of the conquered Italian states differed sharply. The populares would incorporate them into the existing tribes. However, these new assembleymen, who would be populares, would influence voting in favor of that party. The optimates would avoid this event by grouping the new citizens into a definite number of tribes, which could be defeated as a block in the assemblyA summary of the complex issue of the tribes may be found in (Gerrymandering). In 90 and 89, the last days of the Social War, the Romans were deciding the fates of the defeated Italic states. The populares were winning the issue of the tribes. The Lex Plautia Papiria and its predecessor, the Lex Julia, provided for the acceptance of some Italic individuals and communities into the tribal structure (as full citizens). They were already making a difference. A proposed measure to \\"distribute the new citizens among all thirty-five tribes\\" was vetoed by the optimates. This was to be their last victory in the assembly. Plutarch says: :But when the Italians had at last made their submission, and many persons at Rome were suing for the command in the Mithridatic war, with the aid of the popular leaders, contrary to all expectation the tribune Sulpicius, a most audacious man; brought Marius forward and proposed to make him pro-consul in command against Mithridates. Marius at that time (88 BC) was too old for the military. His corpulent figure made a spectacle as he tried to exercise with the young soldiers on Campus Martius. Plutarch expresses an inability to understand his motivations. However, the proposal passed the Assembly, which had the right to pass any law it pleased, but the law was not necessarily Constitutional; that is, consistent with the traditional system of laws and institutions. There was no Supreme Court to strike it down. In peacetime a lawyer, such as Marcus Tullius Cicero, would have had time to test the law in court. In this case Marius sent Tribunes immediately to relieve Sulla of his command at Nola. Based on an ordinance of the Assembly, he was taking it on himself to bypass the Senate, its decrees, and its acting Consuls, the S part of the SPQR formula. Sulla, moreover, had no recourse except himself as Consul. Sulla called an assembly of his men, and explained the situation, but he was shouted down by calls for a march on Rome, which would amount to civil war. All six legions voted for it, except the general staff, who promptly left the camp for Rome, with one exception: one quaestor who joined the movement. He is most likely to have been Sulla's quaestor, as there were only two quaestors. There would have been considerable bonding from the event, so that if he were not Lucullus, history would have to assume that after 88 Sulla dumped his closest friend and ally either in favor of an unknown proquaestor, and that the latter was dumped also, or in favor of one of the quaestors of 87 BC, one of whom must then have been Lucullus, who would have had to have deserted his elected consul. App. is Appian, BC is Bella Civilia, 1, 57 refers to Book I, Chapter 57. Lucullus as consul and proconsul According to Cicero,Lucullus, Chapter 2. Lucullus inherited the governance of Asia (praefuit) after the departure of Murena. He must have been proquaestor pro praetore, at least informally; however, the Senate did not confirm that rank, but made him an aedile, a beginning rank. Cicero does not state their reasoning, but the position was only temporary. Sulla and Murena were being given a twin triumph at Rome. Asia was de facto at peace. No one made an issue over the fact that the Senate had still not ratified the peace. They had other uses for Lucullus. Presumably recalling him from Asia, they elected him praetor of Africa. After a few years of that he ran for consul and won for the year 74 BC with Marcus Aurelius Cotta (consul 74 BC). His old friend and mentor, Sulla, had died in 78 after refusing to continue with the dictatorship despite popular urging to do so. He knew that he was seriously ill. The year after Lucullus left office, troubles arose again in Asia. The king of Bithynia, Mithridates' rival, had died and left his kingdom to the Romans. The Senate accepted the offer. Mithridates judged that this was the right moment for the uprising and counterattack he had been planning secretly for years. After war broke out anew the Senate sent Lucullus, a new proconsul, to the east (73 BC) with a renewed mandate for war, the Third Mithridatic War, and a fresh army. Acquiring a new fleet in Asia (Sulla had taken the previous one to Italy during his invasion of it) he was victorious at sea and on land, driving Mithridates' forces before him wherever he went. Without advice, Mithridates was still a bad general. At a final debacle he and his whole army stampeded out of their camp, flattening its defenses, on hearing a rumor of a minor Roman victory (which was true). They escaped massacre by pursuing Roman troops when the Romans stopped to plunder the rich contents of their camp. Mithridates escaped to Armenia, where he had in-laws among the royals. Lucullus captured Pontus. Overconfident, he split his forces, leaving some to guard Pontus, and taking the rest into Armenia. Tigranes the Great, king of Armenia, ridiculed Mithridates as general. He said of the Romans \\"If they are here as ambassadors, they are too many; if as enemies, altogether too few.\\" He was soon routed by Lucullus, who gave his camp to his own men for plundering. Now that Tigranes was taking the Romans more seriously, he began to cooperate with his in-law and colleague, to the detriment of Lucullus. It was at this time that Mithridates wrote in Iranian to the countrymen of his ancestors, the Parthians, asking for military assistance. They were remnant kingdoms of Alexander's Empire. He had kept the same satrapies and in many cases the same satraps. After his death they restructured into a new Iranian empire. Mithridates was rebuffed, yet the Parthians sent advisors and stationed bowmen on the border. Encountering showers of arrows later, Pompey decided to be content with Anatolia and Syria. Whether because advised by the Parthians, or because forced to rely on their own ingenuity, the two kings devised a winning plan. Tigranes led Lucullus on into the mountains of Armenia. The weather was too adverse for a successful campaign. The men sensed that something was wrong and it was only with difficulty that he could force them to go on. Mithridates returned to Pontus through the passes and fell on the unsuspecting Romans there. He effected a massacre of 7000 men, penned into a muddy ditch. The high ratios of centurions and tribunes among the slain indicate that the men ultimately deserted their officers on the field. Mithridates then fortified Armenia Minor (mountains of eastern Pontus) as a redoubt. Badly wounded himself, he needed time to recover. The fall of Lucullus When he heard, Lucullus hastened back to Pontus, sending word that he was coming, but it was too late. The Roman people had also heard. A scandal ensued. The Senate sent envoys to inform Lucullus that he was relieved of duty, and envoys to the army to inform them that they were to disband immediatey. The main reason given was that the war had gone on too long. Plutarch recounts some of the details (Lucullus Chapter XXXV): Lucullus went through the camp \\"entreating his soldiers man by man, going about from tent to tent in humility and tears, and actually taking some of the men by the hand in supplication.\\" His appeal was to honor and duty. The men answered for the most part by throwing their empty purses before him. He had enrichened himself, they said, neglecting to remunerate them. He was being punished for his clemency in collecting the reparations and for his nobility in restraining the men from sacking Anatolian communities. Sulla used to distribute this type of income to the men. It was not just Lucullus who was in disgrace. The success of the military depended to a large extent on unit pride. Each unit had its own insignia. The standards-bearer was a position of honor, and whoever held it was paid more. Tradition and reputation were everything to the standing of the unit among the other units. If a unit was consistently mutinous or had a poor performance in battle it was put on notice with a \\"stigma,\\" amounting to a poor rating. It did not improve it was dissolved and the men were released from service on less than honorable terms, foregoing all benefits, as the Senate would not employ a unit with a tradition of mutiny and dishonor. The men whom Lucullus begged were those taken away from Fimbria by Sulla, now branded \\"Fimbria's men,\\" who had also murdered their previous commander. They were only being asked to hold the forts until Lucullus' successor arrived. Dismissed troops had only one further chance of honor, that another commander would allow them to re-enlist and re-employ them in other units. The price for the opportunity was sometimes high; for example, decimation, the execution of every 10th man. The other units managed to persuade Fimbria's men to stay for the summer, but they knew they would not be re-employed, and would not follow military discipline. While Sulla waited, Mithridates and Tigranes re-occupied Anatolia and Syria. They did not attack the Romans further. The Romans at least knew that a larger army was on its way. =Varro= The identity problem Aulus Terentius Varro is termed a presbeutes in the inscription, which is confusing, since the verbal form of the word is used in Lapis A to mean \\"envoy.\\" Varro is not the envoy, some unknown person is. If Varro is to be interpreted as envoy, then the inscription commemorates an envoy to an envoy, a sort of circle of mutual recognition not consistent with communications to the other four persons, who were commanders. Governments would be sending envoys to governments, not to their envoys. Traditionally translators therefore resort to the second major meaning of the word as an agent of some sort (in native Greek). Which was it? In the inscription he is an honored guest and benefactor, along with the other commanders, implying that he, too, was a commander, and in the capacity was also presbeutes. A rank of presbeutes acting as commander is implied. Translators since the late 19th century predominantly interpret presbeutes as legatus, a Roman rank, on the border between higher officer and legion-level officer. As in the above translation, Varro becomes \\"a legatus of the Romans\\" in some sort of capacity as acting commander. The \\"envoy\\" interpretation is still credible to some, such as J.S. Arkenberg, who refers to \\"Aulus Terentius Auli filius Varro, ambassador of the Romans, guest of the state, and benefactor of the people.\\" Attempts to discover more about the real person encounter the same problems as for most of the magistrates of the times: the Terentii Varrones family, as well as most of the others, gave all their males the same name, rarely changing the praenomen, or first name. Typically the historians do not use it anyway. Terentius Varro could be any of a number of people. There are many mentions of Varrones but no continuous historical narrative, such as for Sulla or Lucullus. The historical problem is to attribute all the mentions to one or more real persons (the prosopa, hence the terms prosopology and prosopological). The historian, Appian, does clarify the meaning of presbeutes as the Roman rank, but not for this Varro, rather for another, over a decade later, in the Third Mithridatic War. The circumstances in between are roughly as follows. The rise of Pompey Pompey the Great in middle age. Pompey brought himself to Sulla's attention at the beginning of Sulla's second civil war when, as a 23-year old civilian, without any authority whatever, he raised three legions in Picenum (Adriatic coast) and marched them to the relief of Sulla in southern Italy. Such was the magnetism of his personality that he compelled the cooperation of all military officers and magistrates required to perform that feat, passing edicts without any right to do so, setting up drafts in each city of the province, selecting the legionary officers himself, and raising the money to arm, equip, and supply them. He regarded that as a superior course of action to just showing up as a refugee like all the rest. This manifest genius (but not unparalleled in Roman history) was rewarded instantly by Sulla, who, anxious for his safety, had taken a force out to meet him, only to find the three legions secure and marching in good order. Pompey dismounted and saluted Sulla as commander. Sulla dismounted and saluted him as commander, proferring the position on the spot. From then on Pompey was the only officer for whom Sulla would rise on his entry into a room. Without any rank at all he held successive positions of command under Sulla. A resemblance to Alexander the Great was often noted. Sulla attempted to compensate for his lack of legitimate rank by giving him connection. Pompey would divorce his wife (leaving her in poverty) and Sulla's step-daughter would divorce her husband (even though she was pregnant) so that she and Pompey could marry. She died shortly after in childbirth, but the connection was cemented. As long as Sulla was dictator, Pompey would not be questioned. That was only a few years, as it turned out. Pompey's license and aggression were more than Sulla could stand. They were not speaking when Sulla died. Nevertheless, Pompey insured that the now unpopular Sulla received a princely funeral. After the death of Sulla the disposition of Pompey by the Senate was a question mark. They could not assign him to any position of which he was worthy because he had not followed the Cursus Honorum and was too young for any of them. He could not join Lucullus, as he had been disinherited by Sulla and was not on good terms with Sulla's best friend, either. He would not be neglected. He was an optimate, a powerful friend of the Senate in his own right, and was still in command of the three legions Sulla had given to him. The Senate asked him to disband them. He refused. As might be expected of a military genius, he found his own way out of the impasse. What he needed was time and experience. Pompey negotiated a deal with the Senate by which he would disband his army at Rome if the Senate would send him as co-commander with proconsular powers to share the command of the Roman forces in Spain with another supporter of Sulla with whom he felt he could get along better, Quintus Caecilius Metellus Pius. The latter was a legitimate proconsul, having been one of the consuls with whom Sulla had made a deal by which he retained the Mithridatic mandate and was able to go east to carry it out. Metellus was commanding a force in Africa when the populares took over Rome in the absence of Sulla. He never relinquished his command though relieved but hid a few legions in Liguria beyond the reach of the populares, claiming that he was still in command until he relinquished it in Rome. When Sulla landed in Italy, he hastened southward with his legions in support. When Sulla became dictator he sent Metellus to Spain to quell a revolt of the Lusitanians there. When the optimates assumed control the populares all officially lost their commands. The provincial officers either kept their commands illegally or became mercenaries. The Lusitanians had hired Quintus Sertorius away from command of Roman troops in Africa to lead them as a mercenary with proconsular powers. He staged a long guerilla war (Sertorian War) in the mountains of Spain and Portugal against Metellus, and then against Metellus and Pompey. Pompey was there for years. The war seemed unwinnable. Metellus abandoned it finally to assume a mandate against the Gauls, leaving Pompey as supreme commander. The rebels thought they saw their chance. As Sertorius refused to face the Romans in the lowlands, they assassinated him in 72 BC. Apparently they had no experience with the use of heavy infantry in open ground, which Sertorius must have known, as he assiduously avoided it. After a number of disasters against Pompey in the lowlands they were forced to surrender. Pompey and Metellus returned to Rome to celebrate twin triumphs in 71. Being at last of age to serve as consul, Pompey ran and won in 70, becoming qualified to be a legal proconsul the next year. Nothing much happened in 70. The next few years would test his skills to the maximum, bringing him forward as the new leader of Roman politics with a Senate-voted title of \\"the Great.\\" Pirates, bandits, privateers Olu Deniz, a section of the Turquoise Coast Lucullus was relieved of command in 67 BC with no immediate replacement. He remained non-operational in the camps, persuading such troops as would volunteer to stay on in the hope of future employment, to maintain the minimum defense. Mithridates carefully avoided him. It was the Senate's duty to pass on the mandate for war to someone else. They were prevented from doing so by another crisis of national security. Settlements along the entire coastline of Greece and Italy were being attacked, plundered, and burned by troops landing from flotillas. Appian, their main historian, calls them peiratai (Latin pirati, English pirates), \\"marauders.\\" He reports that they were considered leistoi, \\"bandits.\\" They appeared to be mainly interested in plunder, including kidnapping and holding for ransom. They began to strike close to Rome. Two praetors with their insignia (on official business) were taken in a highway ambush. According to the stories handed down to Appian, the Roman people were not sure of who the attackers were or why they were attacking. The most common belief (which still deceives some moderns) is that the marauders were bandits from Cilicia, which had a certain reputation for marine banditry: :”The power of the pirates had its seat in Cilicia at first ... but it took on confidence and boldness during the Mithridatic Wars, because it lent itself to the king’s service.”Plutarch, ‘’Pompey’’, Chapter 24. This paradoxical statement suggests that the Cilician people, who resided in a few handfuls of villages with an urban center or two imposed by external cultures on the westernmost corner of the Turquoise Coast, a rugged terrain formed by mountains descending to the sea, had through some sort of boldness so multiplied in population and military power that they could now dominate thousands of miles of coastline. If this implication were true, they would not need Mithridates or Tigranes, to assume power over the whole Mediterranean. This view is too contradictory even for Plutarch, who proposes it. He therefore further hypothesizes that the Cilician pirates were joined by “men whose wealth gave them power, and whose lineage was illustrious, and who laid claim to superior intelligence ... feeling that the occupation brought them a certain reputation and distinction.” We are to assume, then, that the main motive was not plunder to acquire wealth after all, since they already had it, but was notoriety. Under the influence of this equally incredible motivation they abandoned all thought of country and duty to seize control “over the whole of our Mediterranean Sea, making it unnavigable and closed to all commerce.” They had more than a thousand ships and captured 400 cities. With a comparable force Sulla had invaded and conquered Italy. Appian presents perhaps the clearest view of the phenomenon of the pirates, or at least a view that is consistent with the other history of the times. The pirates were neither Cilician nor plunderers. They were the naval branch of Mithridates’ armed forces, which sometimes operated quasi- autonomously as Privateers, but less frequently as individuals. They did not consider themselves illegal. They claimed to be collecting the spoils of war. Under a blanket franchise (Letter of marque) they attacked in squadrons, each consisting of a certain number of ships from an allied nation. They played elaborate charades to conceal their true identity from their victims, hence the quasi-banditry, the ostentatious show of wealth (gilded ship parts, embroidered sails), and the mock respect for Roman citizens, a status to which the victims would ultimately appeal, but this appeal would identify them as the target. The pirates would “release” them (in mid-ocean). “Cilician” was a ready-made disguise. Appian says: :”They chose for their principal rendezvous the coast of Cilicia where it was rough and harborless and rose in high mountain peaks, for which reason they were all called by the common name of Cilicians. Perhaps this evil had its beginning among the men of the Crags of Cilicia, but thither also men of Syrian, Cyprian, Pamphylian, and Pontic origin and those of almost all the Eastern nations had congregated, .... Thus, in a very short time, they increased in number to tens of thousands. They dominated now not only the eastern waters, but the whole Mediterranean to the Pillars of Hercules.”Appian, ‘’Mithridatic Wars’’, Chapters 92-93. Appian explains elsewhere that he is covering the topic of the pirates in one place because it is not otherwise covered, which is not strictly true. The true topic covered is the war for control of the seas. The Mithridatic fleet after the disgrace of Lucullus has accomplished all the goals of maritime supremacy: marines are able to strike where and when they please, terrorizing the coastline, and use of the waters for trade, transport, and communications has been denied to the Romans. Appian's remarks on the topic are not confined to a few chapters. Along with the history of land warfare he has been developing a history of naval operations as well. The Roman fleet Rome was initially a land power only. If it needed troop transports or warships it rented the services of its allies. The seas were ruled by Etruscan, Greek and Carthaginian fleets. Facing them in a major way for the first time, the Romans found they needed their own fleets. The first official Roman navy The Roman navy; that is, an official military arm of the SPQR, is believed to have begun in 311 BC with the creation of a pair of elected magistrates, the duumviri navales, “the two naval officers,” whose task was “to have charge of equipping and refitting the fleet.” They were added to the government by the Plebeian Council, one of the Roman Assemblies. Acting on a complaint of the consuls of that year that the Roman army contained too many unqualified officers appointed by Senators through a political spoils system, they passed two laws, which were ratified also by the Senate. The lex Atilia Marcia, proposed by two Tribunes of the People, Lucius Atilius and Gaius Marcius, created a professional corps of legionary-level (lower) officers by ruling that of the 24 Military tribunes in the standing army of four legions, 16 must be elected (on the theory that they would run on the strength of their qualifications). Being higher than a company commander (centurion) and lower than a legion commander (legate) they were on the legate's staff for any work that might come up, including line commands of battalions (maniples) or commands of speciality units, such as engineers. One of the speciality units, the fleet (classis) was detached from the army altogether according to a second law proposed by Marcus Decius, another Tribune of the PeopleThe sole source on the duumviri navales is Livy, 9.30.4 and scattered mention elsewhere in Livy. There is latitude for much reconstructional speculation; e.g., The law is therefore the Decian Law. The duumviri were minor civilian magistrates. They had no military rank per se. They might also be in the military with different ranks. In this phase of naval history, however, the naval occupations were not part of the army. In Livy's terminology, sailors were not milites, they were socii navales, “naval associates.” Who was considered to associate with whom is not clear. The captain of a ship was its magister, “master.” More of a connection to the upper magistrates is made with an admiral, or commander of more than one ship, the praefectus classis. This prefect is not the military rank. It is a command position. Livy's Summary for Book XII mentions a duumvir who was defeated and killed by the Tarentines in 282 BC while acting as praefectus classis; that is, commander of the squadron. New strategies for war on the high seas Employment of fereae manus, a new invention prerequisite for boarding. The small Roman navy remained an ineffective arm until the 5th year of the First Punic War (264-241 BC) The Carthaginians had taken control of Sicily. The Romans had determined to recapture it but they could not get across the Strait of Messina without being rammed and sunk by the large and experienced Carthaginian fleet, which included the latest ships. A fortuitous set of circumstances led the Romans to build a new fleet. It had major innovations, which enabled them not only to destroy the Carthaginian fleet and take Carthage but to become the only significant naval power in the Mediterranean, so much so that they called it mare nostrum, “our sea.” The innovations were the grappling hook, the boarding ramp, and the Marine Corps. The consuls for the year 260 BC, Gnaeus Cornelius Scipio Asina and Gaius Duilius (transliterating to Bilius in Greek) were assigned the First Punic War; specifically, the invasion of Sicily. They both were to be imperatores, Duilius of the land forces, Scipio of the naval forces.The story is told mainly in Polybius, Book I, Chapters 20-23, but Pliny the Elder, Florus and a few others add information. Scipio at first borrowed the naval services of the Greek allies in southern Italy. The loan would have included sailors, as the Romans had but few of those. As they started across in convoy formation, the warships protecting the transports, the Carthaginians attacked and drove them back. One aggressive Carthaginian ship ran aground and was taken intact. Someone among the Romans had the idea of using the captured ship as a model in an accelerated shipbuilding program. His identity did not survive, but the plan could not have been carried out without the approval and support of the consuls.Consul Appius Claudius Caudex had already obtained a senatorial decree in 264 BC to employ a fleet to drive the Carthaginians from Sicily, according to Suetonius and Seneca. Subsequent consuls were thus faced with the problem of where to obtain one. The construction became an incident of note in Roman history. Pliny the Elder (Book 16.74.192) reports that the time from the cutting of the trees to the launching of the fleet was 60 days. In that same time rowers (remiges, pl. of remex) were trained on mock benches. Rowing was a skill requiring close coordination between the master, the steersman, the coxwain (Greek keleustes), stationed amidships, and the rowers, who must learn a repertoire of signals given by the coxwain. At the end of 60 days Scipio found himself admiral of a fleet of 160 new ships manned by newly trained oarsmen.The 160 is Florus', Book 2. Polybius has 120. His position was strategos, Latin imperator, the same as for a land general. The ship captains were still nauarchoi, “ship-masters.”Noting the discrepancy between the swift Punic ships and the putative Roman copies, Pitassi rejects the copy story and supposes that the Romans were building units of ships analogous by function to army units; i.e., light, heavy, cavalry, skirmishers, etc. He also rejects the 60-day story as impossible with regard to the output of traditional shipyards: . Of course, any speculation is plausible; the problem is to find evidence. Moderns do not have the luxury of re-writing history under the aegis of non- fiction. Scipio went ahead to Messina with 17 ships. A deputation arrived from Lipari offering to change sides from Carthaginian to Roman (whether true or pretended). Arriving in its harbor first with his 17 ships Scipio was subsequently blockaded by a Carthaginian squadron of 20 ships commanded by Boodes, sent by Hannibal Gisco, who demanded Roman surrender (Battle of the Lipari Islands). The Roman sailors escaped by swimming ashore. Scipio remained for unknown reasons and was taken prisoner, for which the Romans named him asina, “jackass.” He was not otherwise harmed. (The subsequent victories of other members of his family over the Carthaginians served to redeem his reputation.) Overconfident, Hannibal sailed north with 50 ships hoping to surprise the main Roman fleet, which he now counted as an easy mark. Encountering them off the “Italian headland” (unknown) he was driven off with loss of most of his ships. News of the defeat at Lipari was a catalyst for the Romans. Experience with their new fleet was teaching them that they had not managed to capture an example of the latest, most maneuverable warship after all. The one they did capture had run aground. The men complained that “their ships were ill-built and slow in their movements.” According to the law, they were required to send for the other consul, but before they did so, “someone” (tis in Polybius) suggested that they fit the ships with grappling hooks and boarding ramps so that ship-borne soldiers could board enemy ships. The sailors could not be boarders as they had to row. The bigger Carthaginian ships, which these were, were decked, which offered a place for soldiers to wait. Roman marines, 120 BC. Two appear to be already standing on a boarding ramp. Duilius was sent for. His organization of the ship-board soldiers is generally considered the origin of the Marine Corps, which is not to imply that before him no soldiers ever boarded an enemy ship.Duilius' victories were followed by a rash of honorific inscriptions claiming a number of \\"firsts\\" for him that, taken literally, cannot possibly be true. Roller points out that the sense meant is probably an innovative improvement of previous uses: He created an organization to do so. These became known as classiarii, “(soldiers) of the classis.” Their initial victories solidified their fighting reputation, assuring their organizational perpetuity. Some of the emperors later formed regiments of marines to fight on land. There has been no cultural break in the employment of marines since then. Duilius, reports Polybius, left his land army (pedzika stratopeda) in command of the chiliarchoi, a rank between the company commander and the legion commander. The only Roman officer that fits is the military tribune, one rank below the legion commander, a legate. This delegation is unusual. Some legates should have been left behind to command the legions left behind. If the military tribunes were acting legion commanders, then Duilius must have had the legates with him; in fact, they must have commanded the milites Duilius brought with him to serve as classiarii, which were kept separate from the ship-handlers, or socii navales. If one century could fit on one ship, the remaining ships would require 143 centuries, which, in the manipular system in effect 315-107 BC, would amount to 11440 marines of an average of 80 men per ship/century, or two legions. He took about half his standing army of 4 legions to serve as marines. He also would have taken his staff of legates for delegation of command. A Roman attack now was staged something like this. Their strategy was to close with the enemy immediately under any terms, with little or no maneuvering. At close range a shower of fereae manus, “iron hands,” went out from marine ballistae, grappling the object ship (Florus, “Epitome,” Book II). A 36-foot by 4-foot railed ramp on a swivel swung out perpendicular to the rail. The last 12 feet were bent up vertically with a spike projecting from the bottom, giving the appearance of a “crow” (corvus) about to peck. When in position the crow pecked, dropping the end of the bridge onto the enemy superstructure. A point of four men in teams of two ran forward to secure the end of the bridge. The entire company ran over it concentrating on the enemy deck before the enemy crew could reach the point. Little resistance could be offered. The captive ship was manned by its former crew, now under Roman direction. The technique was broadened to the assault of cities with a sea wall, the ramp being dropped onto the wall, and to enemy dock facilities. Allowing for a suitable time to install the new inventions and embark the marines, the Romans proceeded to take the Straits of Messina with their entire force. The numbers on either side vary slightly depending on the author but it is clear that both sides were about evenly matched with about 120 ships. The first conflict was the Battle of Mylae, fought for control of Messina at Milazzo. It was a Roman victory. The Carthaginians attacked twice, losing 30 ships the first time and 20 the second before they perceived that new inventions were being employed against them and beat a retreat. The Romans won again at the Battle of Sulci off Sardinia in 258 BC, and again at the Battle of Tyndaris in 257 BC, etc. Hannibal Gisco was condemned for incompetence by the Carthaginian Senate after Sulci. They evidently still did not understand why the Carthaginians were no longer victorious. Rome becomes a maritime power The topic of Roman naval operations is now covered by an extensive bibliography attempting to answer such questions as, was the navy a distinct branch, were the marines a distinct branch, did the marines row, did the rowers fight, what were the chains of command, etc. There are no single, simple answers, except to say that they depend on the theatre of operations, the time period, the government, the state of technology, etc. One modern myth takes its being from the frontier river commands, due to the excavation of a number of river boats along the Rhine and Danube. The vessels were small open patrol boats rowed by milites. Care and deployment of the boats was part of the military education of the regular army. The boat-handling jobs were given by rotation to all the soldiers. When not in use, the boats were stored in sheds in a fortified adjunct of the main base. The boat-handlers were called classiarii even though the boats were not a classis, the handlers were not in the navy or marine corps, and they did no fighting in or from the boats, as one cannot fight and row at the same time. Rivers were used for transport of regular troops, supplies, and communication. One cannot conclude generally that because milites handled river boats on the frontier and were called classiarii, the Roman navy was an adjunct to the army. The development of the deep-water navy suggests that at their lower levels the navy, army, and marine corps must have been distinct organizations. Ship-masters, navigators, and supporting officers were highly skilled professionals much in demand. Navigation depended mainly on personal knowledge of the coastline, without which the ships were sure to become lost and go aground. Lucullus asking ships from Egypt was also asking for the services of their skilled crews. Those were denied, as the Pharaoh had already sent 300 crews to Mithridates to man new ships. Sailors were not going to be asked to abandon their ships to man some battle line ashore, nor could they be used to board enemy vessels leaving their own vessels to the wind and waves. If marines were to be available to heavy warships they must be stationed at naval bases. It is unthinkable that soldiers would be pulled out of a line of battle to march for days to a naval base to be trained ad hoc as rowers for the navy or to become marines. The fleet would have left port long before. Aboard a ship, the centurion of marines did not take orders from the ship's master or vice versa. Among the magistrates elected to the higher ranks no such distinctions were recognized. A consul or proconsul or any of his staff could command either legions or ships, or both as required. Legates might be assigned army groups or ship squadrons. The Romans retained their new Command of the sea throughout most of the First Punic War until the Carthaginian navy found that it could not continue its bid for control of Sicily. The issue came to a final resolution in the Battle of the Aegates Islands (west of Sicily) in 241 BC. Previously at the Battle of Drepana in 249 BC the Romans had lost one fleet due to errors in strategy and a second in a storm. The Carthaginians thus regained control of the sea for a few years.Polybius Book I Sections 50-54. The treasury being depleted, wealthy Romans banded together to finance construction of another fleet, this time on the model of a Rhodian quinquereme, a heavy battleship, but lighter and more maneuverable with the capability either to ram or to board. By this time Carthage was using marines also. A fleet was sent to Drepana with supplies. The plan was to offload the supplies, embark marines, and attack the Romans. They never reached Drepana. The Roman fleet, specially lightened, attacked them first in the Aegates Islands, captured most of the ships, and sank the rest. Peace was granted to Carthage in exchange for their interest in Sicily and for severe reparations. Carthage concentrated now on building a state in Mediterranean Spain, which ultimately collided with the Romans at Saguntum, the result being the Second Punic War, 218-201 BC. In it Carthage relied mainly on a land campaign beginning with an invasion of Italy over the Alps by Hannibal. Despite numerous defeats Rome was strong enough to endure and to bring forth the men who would destroy Carthage. From first to last Hannibal encountered Scipio Africanus, who, a 17-year old lad accompanying his father, Publius Cornelius Scipio as an observer at the Battle of Ticinus, used his bodyguard of 30 cavalrymen to rescue his father from capture. A generation later, commander of Roman forces in Africa, he won the Battle of Zama in 202 BC against Hannibal and forced Carthage to a peace it could not endure, stripped of its military and subject to the rule of Rome. Rome’s expansion into the eastern Mediterranean Until this point Rome had been mere visitors and trading partners in the Aegean region. Now that Rome had pointed the way to maritime supremacy through amphibious warfare, the smaller coastal states found that they could become players in the international game of power simply by building a naval strike force and using it to plunder shipping and capture coastal cities. A frenzy of fleet-building took place. Skilled mariners were in great demand. Rome was forced to defend itself, which it did by building ad hoc fleets for the use of the magistrates assigned to specific conflicts. Naval facilities were always adjunct to commercial ports or military camps. There were not yet any permanent fleets. For example, the naval base at Misenum and its permanent fleet, the classis misenensis, date to approximately 23 BC in the reign of Augustus Thus when Pliny was its commander he was a specifically naval officer appointed by the emperor, not a magistrate. Securing the Adriatic Conflict and conquest of the east began in the decade after the First Punic War with the First Illyrian War, 229-228 BC. Illyria was not a unified state. It was rather a region of small independent kingdoms distinguished by language as well as by politics. The major language or language group was spoken by tribes in “Illyria Proper” (Roman term) in the west Balkans, now speaking unrelated Albanian and Slavic languages. No descendant of the Illyrian languages remain. The populations were overrun in the Middle Ages. Livy reports that about the year 302 BC a fleet of Greek marauders under Cleonymus of Sparta kept to the center of the Adriatic on their way north to raid the Veneti, in order to avoid the piracy of the Illyrians, Liburnians, and Istrians, suggesting that the feared piracy was confined to the coasts of the Balkans.Book X Chapter 2 Agron having succeeded in 250 BC to the kingship of the Ardiaei, a coastal tribal state of the Illyrians, after 240 built a new fleet with Roman modifications. The lembus was a light monoreme in which the masts and rigging had been replaced by a deck for marines, ideal for amphibious assault, but inadequate in deep- water battles against heavy ships. Agron used them in coasal waters to place a chain of bases in Epirus, assisting in its political disintegration. This aggrandizing activity reached a peak with the amphibious assault in 231 BC on the forces of the Aetolian League, who were besieging the coastal city of Medion (location unknown) in an attempt to compel it to join the League. A force of 100 lembi landed 5000 marines at night, from which a complement of 50 marines per ship is calculated. Agron celebrated his victory to such a degree of \\"convivial excesses\\" that he died of pleurisy. His wife Teuta became regent for his infant son. That year either Agron before his death or Teuta after it ventured to siege the island state of Issa a little further out into the Adriatic. Issa appealed to Rome. As long as the Illyrians had confined themselves to their coastal waters the Romans seemed willing to endure even attacks on their merchant vessels, but now they sent ambassadors to demand an accounting of causes. At least one was killed in an Illyrian attack. The Senate declared war. The Illyrians took Corcyra, placing it under a governor, Demetrius of Pharos. Seeing that the Romans were preparing an army and a fleet, Demetrius secretly turned coat. With him as guide, a consular army of over 20,000 men (four legions) invaded Illyria forcing Teuta's surrender. Illyrian conquests in Greece became Roman protectorates. Ardiaei was reduced to an inland kingdom, while the Romans set up Demetrius as client king of the Illyrian coast. Rome enjoyed total peace for several years. In 221 BC the small state of Istria began attacking Roman grain ships, causing the Senate to reply with the First Istrian War, 221 BC. This Istria was located on the Istrian Peninsula in the northeast Adriatic just to the south of what is now Trieste. The war was over in the year it began, the Romans imposing a settlement. Subsequently, Demetrius of Pharos, having married into Teuta's family, changed sides again. Building a fleet of 90 ships he launched a surprise attack on the Roman fleet. The resulting Second Illyrian War was brief (220-219) resulting in the unseating of Demetrius and his taking refuge with the court of Macedon. A new client-king, Gentius, sat on the throne of Ardiaei. Peace came to the Adriatic under Roman control. The Second Punic War was upon them. Philip V of Macedon, having been an ally of Teuta, after some victories of Hannibal in Italy, formulated a secret treaty of mutual defense with Carthage in 215. The discovery of a copy on a captured ship led the Senate to send investigators with a force of 55 ships to ascertain its truth. If true, they were to attack Philip. Thus began the First Macedonian War, 214-205 BC. Philip at first sent fleets of Illyrian-style lemni to capture the Adriatic. When it became clear that they were no match for Roman quinqueremes, he withdrew them, effecting a campaign overland to Illyria instead. He relieved Illyria. Realizing that they had no forces to send to the Balkans, the Romans brought in the Aetolian League and Pergamon against Macedon. They were both defeated. However, learning that a Roman army was in Africa, Philip hastened to make peace before the inevitable fall of Carthage. The terms were basically the status quo: the Adriatic with Balkan bases were given to Rome; Philip kept Illyria and Greece. Liberating Greece and Anatolia from the diadochi kingdoms Believing that his Roman frontier was secure, Philip entered a war of aggrandizement to the east, securing the colonial possessions of Ptolemaic Egypt, now ruled fortuitously by the six-year-old Ptolemy V Epiphanes. His forays into Asia Minor led him into opposition to Pergamon and Rhodes, both friends of Rome, which hastened to the liberation of the Mediterranean from Macedonian tyranny (in the ideology of the times), resulting in the Second Macedonian War, 200-197 BC. They were joined by a defensive alliance of all the Greek states, including Athens, until Macedon stood alone and was forced to surrender, leaving Rome as the guardian of Greek freedom, which it defended from numerous bases throughout Greece. Peace and freedom were proclaimed by the Roman commander, Titus Quinctius Flamininus. This peace was somewhat uneasy, as the Romans had failed to reach a satisfactory alliance with the Seleucid Empire, co-conspirators with Macedon in the seizure of Ptolemaic lands. The Seleucids were not of much help to Macedon as they were engaged in fighting the Egyprian army in Syria. Having acquired Syria by victory over Egypt, Antiochus III the Great turned his attention to his own \\"liberation of Greece\\" from the Romans, invading it through the Hellespont and Thermopylae, starting the Roman–Seleucid War (192-188 BC), during which Hannibal, then a refugee, was a personal advisor to Antiochus. The Seleucid army was stopped by a Roman at the Battle of Thermopylae (191 BC). The rest of the war went no better, forcing the surrender of Antiochus. To obtain peace he paid reparations to Rome and ceded Anatolia to Rhodes and Pergamum. The losing kingdoms only bided their time. Philip had been given some severe terms by the Senate through Flaminius. He was to remove his troops from Greece and Anatolia, give up all holdings there, return all political power to the local regions, pay heavy reparation to Rome, and give his younger son, Demetrius, as a hostage to Rome. Finding life in the big city to his liking, the young man was soon Romanized, becoming a popular celebrity. Meanwhile, Philip gained some credibility by turning on his former ally, the Seleucid Empire. He facilitated the march of the Roman army through Macedon on its way to Syria, building roads, providing supplies, and warding off Thracian marauders, in reward for which the Romans cancelled the rest of his debt and sent Demetrius home. Whether Philip was ever sincere remains questionable. The urban praetor began to receive charges filed by many states of Greece claiming that Philip was not facilitating the terms of his settlement.The details of the charges were stated in Book IX of Appian but only fragments survive, without the detail. The fragments have been placed online in Philip sent Demetrius to defend him before the Senate. The fact that he produced a list given by Philip to the Senate earlier showing the tasks accomplished and those remaining to be accompilshed with regard to Greece suggests a defense of inability to keep up with the schedule. In any case Demetrius won a pardon for him. More serious charges were filed by Pergamon, unknown exactly, but apparently of a territorial nature. The Senate found against Philip. An arbitration committee awarded a piece of Macedon to Pergamon, after which Philip began to mobilize for war. A campaign began at Rome to replace Philip with Demetrius, bypassing his older brother, Perseus. In the last year of his life Philip had Demetrius executed, presumably for some charge such as treason. In 179 BC Perseus inherited the throne. He was anti-Roman. A counter-liberation provokes Rome to harsh measures There followed an alliance race between Macedon and Rome. Rome did not go to war lightly; it needed a casus belli, a hostile act. As long as Macedon and its allies did not give Rome one they could find friends where they pleased. In the first year of his reign Perseus made a state marriage with Laodice V, a princess of the Seleucid Empire, recently vanquished by Rome (above). Around that time also he approved a suit for the hand of his sister, Apame IV, presented by Prusias II of Bithynia. A few years earlier, 183 BC (unknown exactly), the Romans had sent envoys to the court of his father, Prusias I of Bithynia, demanding the surrender of Hannibal, who had been given refuge there. Instead, Hannibal died of poisoning (accounts vary), we are told by a summary of a missing book of Livy,Book 39 of the summaries found at Oxyrhynchus. but no further detail is given. The fact that Prusias was now joining the Macedonian collaboration suggests that he was distressed over the fate of Hannibal. The period of furtive conspiracies and pretended compliances received an object lesson starting in the second year of Perseus’ reign with the Second Histrian War (178-177). King Epulon broke his kingdom's former peace treaty with a surprise attack on the new (180 BC) Roman colony of Aquileia, which had been placed close to the Histrian northern border as a base for the control of the northern Adriatic. The city was not taken but Epulon defeated a consular army sent to relieve it. The next season's consular army under Gaius Claudius Pulcher (consul 177 BC) devastated Histria, colonized it with Veneti, and reduced the population to slavery, placing a colony, Tergeste, that would become Trieste. These measures bought Rome several years of remission, but they were no solution, as the alliance race intensified through fear of Rome. It was a public relations defeat. Macedon now attempted to restore its credibility to the Greek states by conducting a campaign of massive economic relief. Most of the states were bankrupt, burdened by the heavy costs of war and manifestly unjust reparations. Roman reputation was suffering from a disconnect between the Senate and the men sent to carry out its mandates. The reparations officers, mainly army officers, were charging and collecting exorbitant rates of interest. Fragment 17 of Appian testifies to a growing disenchantment with Rome: a “hatred of the Romans, which the Roman generals had caused” (but the incidents are missing). Into these scenarios stepped Perseus, offering economic aid, arbitration of wars between states, and agreements cancelling debt. Like Antiochus the Great before him, Perseus appears to have been aiming at a role reversal, in which Greece must now be liberated from the tyrannical Romans (in ideology).: ”The Senate ... saw itself in danger of being replaced by Perseus as the arbiter of liberty and the supporter of social justice .... The Roman Senate fought back in kind, sending endless commissions, which would criminalize the interest, provide plans for debt payment, and arbitrate disputes. The apparent sincerity of the Macedonians was never questioned. In 172 BC King Eumenes II of Pergamon, still a loyal ally, came to Rome in person to inform on Perseus and sound the alarm of war. Perseus’ intent, he said, was to arouse and ally the Greeks against Rome. For this whole time he had been rearming. When the moment was right he would strike. A counter-embassy from Perseus was rejected. Visiting Delphi on the way back to Pergamon, Eumenes was waylaid by four assassins, but escaped. After a criminal investigation pointed to Perseus as the instigator, Rome declared war. The Mithridatic fleet At the beginning of the conflict the Romans dominated the seas, which they had done since defeating the Carthaginian and Etruscan fleets. Mithridates had no significant navy, but he knew how necessary one was going to be. The Roman admiralty The administration of government facilities of any sort was performed by elected officials called magistrates, Latin magistratus, a specific form of the ubiquitous magister, “master,” etymologically “doer of greatest things.” A master was any person of social respect and authority. A magistrate was a person whose authority was assigned by the government. The same word means also “magistracy,” the office in general. The power that was granted to the magistrate to fulfill the duties of his office was the officium. Exercising it he was acting ex officio, which was the most fundamental justification of any action taken by any magistrate. At Rome, magistrates had to justify themselves frequently, especially in the late Republic. Although magistrates had a large degree of freedom and autonomy in the performance of their officia there was nevertheless a hierarchy deriving from the Roman Monarchy. The king then had held all the executive power, appointing magistrates and commanders as he pleased. After the long break of the Republic, the emperor, claiming to be acting king, resumed the executive powers of kings. Meanwhile, the SPQR fortified itself against monarchy by breaking the executive power into a ladder, so to speak, of magistracies. Each magistrate would be personally approved through election. Once elected, the magistrate had to behave appropriately to the rung of the ladder or Cursus honorum, on which he now stood. At the top were the two Roman consuls. They could be ordered by the Senate to do anything: fight enemies, build roads and public buildings, provide rescue and relief in disasters, offer medical services, grow crops, and build and command fleets. The substructure on which they relied consisted mainly of the army, which was filled out by a draft, to which all males over a certain age were subject on demand. The soldiers might find themselves doing anything, mainly construction. The old roads over the Alps even today are marked with placques commemorating the legions that constructed them. The nature of the cursus and the functions of the magistracies were profoundly different from the command structures of today. There was a distinct army, navy and marine corps, but they did not include any magistracies. The latter existed entirely to fill the upper echelons of military or civilian command. The career of Pliny the Elder is an example of how the cursus worked. As a young man he served as a provincial cavalry officer. After successful service he retired, moved to Rome, became a famous and wealthy encyclopedist, and personal assistant of the emperor. Then, and only then, was he qualified to begin the cursus, which was somewhat different from the cursus of the Republic, including imperial officers. He ended with the imperial rank of procurator. When Mount Vesuvius erupted he was commander of the fleet at Misenum (a large naval base). The title of Pliny's command was praefectus classis, the same as the first known fleet commander. This was a position, not a rank. It has been interpreted imprecisely as “admiral.” The Roman navy had no admirals, or servicemen of admiralty rank. If an Admiralty is to be defined as a permanent branch of government taking responsibility for the navy, and an Admiral is a command rank of a permanent navy, as they usually are today, then the Roman state had no such institutions. It had fleet commanders, who were elected magistrates or the appointees of elected magistrates, or of the Senate, or later of the Emperor. The term admiralty applied to the ancient Romans must mean the commanders of fleets, who might have any of a number of ranks. Fleet commanders of the Mithridatic Wars Supporting inscriptions Honorific inscription at Hypata for Lucullus Ypati. The summit of the slope was the location of the akropolis. Location of the deme of Ypati =Honor to Quaestor Lucullus= This inscription is a titulus, or text, on a broken, honorific statue-base found in a garden in what was ancient Hypata in Thessaly. It was published by IG in 1908, giving it an inscription code of \\"IG IX 2 38. It also appear in SIG3 743. The word translated by quaestor is Tamias. \\"treasurur.\\" There were different types. An unqualified tamias, a municipal financial officer, was responsible for public funds and property, a function performed at Rome by the urban quaestor. The supply officer of a military unit, equivalent to the military quaestor, was the tamias ton stratiotikon. The officer who handled funds for the temples was the tamias tou theou. Of this inscription Kern says (English translation from Latin): :\\"L. Licinius L.f. Lucullus (consul 74 B.C.) was quaestor and then proquaestor in Asia 88-80 B.C. Tamias can signify either (Dittenberger).\\" The use of the term quaestor for tamias does not prove that Lucullus was not a proquaestor. Greek inscriptional language does include anti tamias, where anti is the word the Greeks used to translate Roman pro, \\"in place of.\\" Lucullus arriving in Alexandris to request the use of Egyptian ships is an anti tamias, suggesting that tamias was simply quaestor. Subsequently, however he is quaestor pro praetore in charge of the fleet. Despite the semantic ambiguity, the geographic circumstances point to tamias being quaestor. The dedicating agency is the koinon (\\"government\\") of the Ainianes, an ethnic name. The ethnic may be just a convention referring to any people living at Hypata, which once was the capital of the tribe, or it may refer archaically to the older Ainian League. He refers to this inscription. In any case this inscription is one of a class issued by Thessalian and some other Greek koina. In the previous century Rome subdued the Thessalian countryside by dissolving recalcitrant koina and rewarding cooperative ones. In the 1st century BC it was restoring koina and offering economic assistance to them coordinated through quaestores, which subsequently was occasion of an honorific statue. These inscriptions reveal the existence of a lower-ranking acting quaestor, the leg(atus) pro q(uaestore), which was to be expected as there were not enough quaestores to assist all the koina that needed it. If the word Quaestor (tamias) can be taken to mean exactly that, then the year of the inscription can be taken to be the year Lucullus was quaestor. It must be earlier than all the inscriptions that refer to him as proquaestor. In that year, he must have served in some capacity to be honored in Thessaly. The first record of his being in Thessaly was in the year of his mission to arrange supply prior to Sulla's invasion of Greece in 87.In an effort to offer an alternative explanation, Zoumbaki proposes that Lucullus' presence at Hypata is explained by his concern for minting currency, which would raise the date to 87 or after. The historians, however, say that Lucullus was told to do the minting in the Peloponnesus. Thessaly was not only out of the way, but was at risk of being taken by the Pontians. Moreover, Lucullus was only a minter for part of 87. A ghost, or unknown minter, supplanted him for the next three years. War had been declared the previous year, but due to the circumstances of Sulla's first civil war, he was unable to act on the mandate. The next year he was no longer Consul. He brokered a deal with the Consuls of that year that he should prosecute the war as Proconsul. One of the Consuls for 87 was loyal to Sulla; the other soon broke the deal and brought charges that were grounds for impeachment against Sulla. Sulla had six legions. He could use them either to prosecute the Civil War or to take command in the east. If he chose the east, he knew that his enemy in the recently completed civil war, Marius, would return to Rome and that, without his legions, the populares would soon be dominant, and he would be cut off from the supply and support of Rome. He therefore set up a supply infrastructure among the loyal Greeks, with the help of Lucullus. When he landed on the shore of the Gulf of Corinth in March 87 BC (or in another theory on the shores of Epirus) his first concern was for supply. Regardless of what ships he used to cross the Adriatic, they must be left in the Gulf. He and Lucullus devised a scheme of \\"borrowing\\" the wealth stored in temples. That date was either late 88 or early 87, before March, the month of the invasion. Although the inscription suggests a date of 88 BC, it is not proof positive that the date of the quaestorship per se was not 87. The circumstances, however, are unfavorable to 87. If it was not 88, then Lucullus was not the quaestor that remained loyal to Sulla in the Civil War, but whose quaestor was he? Sulla could no longer hire a quaestor himself, not being Consul. Moreover, if he was quaestor in 87, Sulla had no legitimate authority to invite him further as proquaestor, which would have been up to the Senate, now held by his enemies.Considering that the final historical verdict for the First War is that he finished as Proquaestor, reverting to his rank on handing over command of the fleet, it is possible that the usage of the words varies; that is, in some situations Quaestor was a position rather than a rank. Other similar titles use Proquaestor pro Praetore, which is what may have been meant. In coin legends also, the same Quaestor is sometimes listed for multiple years. For the ins and outs of the question, see the following. The view that in fact Lucullus was Quaestor in 88 remains a strong one. His timetable as quaestor in 87 is too crowded. In 87 he had two months to accomplish an amazing number of tasks. He had to desert the Consul with whom he was elected to take up with Sulla. He and Sulla then had to decide to go ahead with the invasion of Greece and plan how to live off the countryside. Lucullus must then sail to Greece and travel extensively in the countryside of Central Greece contacting the provincial officers. He sets up a supersession meeting with Sura, then returns to Sulla. The time required for all these activities would be more credible as 6 months, rather than 2. Ready at last, they sail to the Gulf and demand the promised supplies. The Siege of Athens begins. They raid all the temples. Now Lucullus must set up a mint and coin money. Finally, made propraetor and sent off to Egypt in the fall of 87, having been quaestor less than a year, he serves as fleet commander until 85. It was impossible for him to have been proquaestor, as stated in all his other honorific inscriptions. =Quaestor pro Praetore Lucullus= Whether his quaestorship is dated to the more easily explainable 88 BC or to the more difficult 87 BC, it was only his starting rank in the campaign. There is more evidence that Sulla found him too valuable for the supply officer role. He was of more use as an emissary and expeditionary commander. Toward the end of 87 Sulla sent him on an expedition again, this time to beg ships from Ptolemaic Egypt to counter Archelaus' battle fleet. The request was refused by the welcoming but cautious Egyptian king, and he travelled the islands of the Aegean, working from the Roman naval base at Rhodes, which had successfully repulsed Archelaus. His purpose was to gather a contributed fleet from the islanders. He brought unexpected hope to the adherents of Rome who had not dared to oppose Archelaus. Around this time the letters to the people of Mopsuestia, formerly Seleuceia, in Cilicia were written, which were engraved on a marble block for public viewing. The main text of the inscription replies to a request to Lucullus that the Temples of Isis and Serapis be granted the power of refuge. It was granted. An initial paragraph from Sulla underwrites the decision by Lucullus. The latter refers to himself as Quaestor pro Praetore (Tamias kai Antistrategos): that is, a former quaestor promoted to acting praetor. The date of the letter must be the end of the First Mithridatic War, as the pirates of Cilicia were submitting, with Lucullus perhaps making the decision in 86 BC, and Sulla ratifying in either 86 or 85. If Lucullus was Quaestor pro Praetore (\\"Quaestor acting as commander\\") in 86, and Quaestor is to refer only to his rank, then he cannot also have been Proquaestor (ex Quaestor) in 86. And yet, if he was Quaestor in either 88 or 87, as the honorific inscription at Hypata implies, he must have been Proquaestor (and not Quaestor) in 86. =The Proquaestor Pro Quaestore solution= Considered in the light of inscriptions now catalogued and known to moderns, the rank of Lucullus appears to be a problem. There is a question whether he was Quaestor in 88 or Quaestor in 87; however, beyond that, in some years he appears to have been both Quaestor and Proquaestor. If it is assumed that magistrates can be either Quaestors or Proquaestors, but not both, then insoluble contradictions are seen generally solved by tossing out evidence contrary to a given proposition as exclusive choice. Thonemann, for example, after a review of the evidence as he sees it decides Lucullus must have been Quaestor in 87 and Proquaestor thereafter, discarding evidence to the contrary, but whichever view he were to take, he could not keep it without discards. Thonemann distinguishes between \\"classes of document,\\" the inscriptions taking precedence; however, he goes a step further. They must be mutually reconcilable; if they are not, then they may be moved in time to make them so, which is a step in the direction of writing your own history. The unknown Quaestor of 88 is passed off with \\"the identification is far from evident.\\" Cicero in Lucullus 2 mentions that Lucullus served as Quaestor in Asia while Murena was fighting the Second Mithridatic War (82 BC), and yet he reports in Lucullus 11 that the latter was in Alexandria as Proquaestor (86 BC), which seems to place the cart before the horse. If he was already Proquaestor in 86, how could he be Quaestor in 82? Thonemann dismisses the contradiction as \\"carelessness,\\" but Cicero repeats it in Pro Archia 5.11, reporting that he ruled Asia as Quaestor. As an ex-magistrate himself, he might be expected to remember these matters. Thonemann would go so far as to alter the date recommended by the editors of an inscription set up in a former pirate community in Cilicia from 84 BC to 87 BC, requiring a totally different political situation. In 84 the inscription addresses Quaestor pro Praetore Lucullus, commander of the victorious Roman fleet poised offshore. In 87 it must strangely be addressed to an as yet unvictorious Quaestor commanding nothing and without a commander in Central Greece, and be coming from a unit of pirates that had allied itself with Mithridates. Any change in chronology must consider the implied concomitant adjustments to the matrix of events, not just the rank of one magistrate. A solution was proposed as early as 1837 by a contributor signing only ECB (probably Rev. Edward C. Brice, member, Numismatic Society), which Thonemann and some others reject out of hand as \\"Constitutionally quite impossible\\" (it is not impossible). It is based on the Constitutional distinction between \\"urban quaestor,\\" the treasurer at Rome, and \\"military quaestor,\\" expected not to be at Rome; that is, \\"field quaestor.\\" It is one of those distinctions rarely explicitly made by a society that took it for granted. Any such distinction (there were more) referenced by just the word \\"quaestor\\" is bivocal. On the one hand a Quaestor is someone who holds one of these positions. On the other hand, if the Constitutional rank of Quaestor is not so distinguished, but the office is, then the office and the rank are different meanings. In that case a Proquaestor might be assigned to the job of Quaestor Militaris just as he would be assigned Pro Praetore. He would technically be Proquaestor Pro Quaestore, but no such rank is testified. One might guess that just plain Quaestor would cover it. To demand of all the Quaestors that they be certified as such by the Senate seems unreasonable for the need. Ex-Quaestors would do just as well, or other ranks acting pro Quaestore. Sulla in fact found it necessary as Dictator to increase the number of Quaestors per Consul. It went up from there. There were never enough to go around. Honorific inscription at Larissa for Sura Location of Thessaly An inscription from Larissa in Thessaly honors Q. Braetius Sura and is the only source stating his full name. Sura is known for being the commander of the only Roman forces in Central Greece to resist the incursion of Archelaus there. According to the historians, Central Greece was not his regular duty assignment. He had been under the commander of Macedonia, who ordered him to the defense of Thessaly and Boeotia, which were being subdued, for the most part unwillingly, by Archelaus; i.e., they were mainly pro-Roman. War had already been declared by the Senate. A war Consul had already been elected, who was Sulla in 88, and he had received the mandate, but he was unable to serve it that year dues to civil war. He sent Lucullus to Central Greece to announce to the Romans that he was coming, and to announce to Sura that he was now superseded, and was to report back to his commander C. Sentius in Macedonia province for the winter (88-87 BC). Any refusal to obey the order would be interpreted as another act of civil war. Sura obeyed forthwith, indicating the loyalty of the troops in the eastern theatre to Sulla and to the Senate. The date of the supersession is the key date of the entire sequence of events in the First Mithridatic War. Was it 88 or 87 BC? Here are the exact words in translation of the major source of the topic, Plutarch in Sulla: :\\"But when Lucius Lucullus ordered him to give place to Sulla, who was coming, and to leave the conduct of the war to him, as the senate had voted, he at once abandoned Boeotia and marched back to Sentius.\\" The Senate had given the war to Sulla in 88. In 87 Sulla was not Consul and had no power to conduct anything except under the authority of the Consuls for 87. Unless directed by those Consuls as Quaestor for that year, Lucullus had no power to demand anything from anyone. The coins engraved with Sulla and Manlius Torquatus =Proquaestor Lucullus leaves a vacancy= At the beginning of his consular career, Sulla was fortunate enough to find an incomparable Quaestor, Lucius Licinius Lucullus, who was able to be a confidant of all his plans, collaborate in operations planning, and serve as ambassador to rebel provinces and foreign states, all the while tending successfully to the duties of supply and finance. Expressing the full range of his capabilities, Lucullus was for the most part operating above his pay grade. He was better than the job he had. In recognition of this fact Sulla promoted him to acting fleet commander in 87, beginning with the task of procuring a fleet. He was lost as a Proquaestor for the remainder of the First Mithridatic War. The proquaestorial post was now vacant and must be filled. Lucullus is said by Plutarch to have managed money for Sulla: :Most of the money used in Peloponnesus during the Mithridatic war was coined by him, and was called Lucullean after him. It remained current for a long time, since the wants of the soldiery during the war gave it rapid circulation This was a lot to ask of a man who shortly was sent off to Egypt pro Praetore and whose name never appears on any Roman currency as moneyer. It is a safe presumption that, unless Plutarch made the story up, Lucullus set up the mint and perhaps designed the currency. He certainly was not doing any minting for the years he was in the Aegean serving as admiral of Sulla's new fleet, nor did he command any mints. From the fact that the money was very popular one might infer that the soldiers called it \\"Lucullean.\\" They more than anyone else were in the campaign for the money Sulla paid, the metal for which he levied from the temples and as tribute. Documentary evidence that Sulla had found a candidate appears from 82 BC, a successful year for him. In that year he had defeated all his enemies at Rome and declared himself Dictator (reviving the old position). He had sent for his repentant commander in Asia, Murena, who was now ready to accept Sulla's agreement with Mithridates. Lucullus had been relieved of his command of the fleet. He had been kept on nominally as Murena's Proquaestor, but he did not function as that. Either he was being allowed a long vacation or Sulla was using him to report on the situation. In any case he relieved Murena of command, re-assuming his old rank of acting commander, this time in command of Asia. He would never be Proquaestor again. His fate in the Third Mithridatic War, when he was relieved from the Consulship and from command as incompetent, to be replaced by another protege of Sulla (now deceased), Pompey \\"the Great,\\" remained totally unanticipated. =The new currency= Sulla and Murena were planning a twin triumph of Asian victory in 81. In preparation for this victory celebration Sulla issued a special, limited run of coins now entitled (those that have been collected) RRC 367, according to the numbering scheme in Michael H. Crawford's \\"Roman Republican Coinage.\\" It survives as a number of variants: 367/1, 367/2, etc. The coin legends all say the same, except for minor spelling variations. An example is given below: The coin is an Aureus (\\"gold coin\\"), a then new type, designed (with the silver Denarius) for across-the-table payment of their wages to Sulla's men. A Denarius represented a day's wages; an Aureus, a month's. The obverse (\\"heads\\" in the American vernacular) represents the goddess, Roma. ECB originally had supposed it is meant to be Pallas Athena, without considering that such an interpretation would place the patron goddess of Rome's enemy, Athens, on its coin. Themes on coins are never sardonic. On the reverse (\\"tails\\") is a representation of a Quadriga driven by Sulla followed by a winged victory, probably a reference to the triumph he claimed in 81. Sulla would not be in a position to declare any such victory until he had won Sulla's second civil war and had become dictator in 82 BC. The quadriga represents the triumph of 81 BC. He probably knew for sure that he was going to claim it after his victory of 82, but he needed Murena present, which is why he sent to arrest him. The minting therefore was most likely to have been 82/81 BC, in Italy, since the head is of Roma. Sulla's coins at the time have a more or less standard format, perhaps a reflection of their military origin. On the obverse is the goddess, Roma. The abbreviated name of the moneyer also appears.In the terminology of the British Museum the moneyer is the \\"magistrate responsible for coin production.\\" There are not a few only; it was a necessary post, and moneyers were generally not of interest to the historians. The Museum publishes a list: On this coin the moneyer is a member of the Roman patrician family, Manlii Torquati, the founder having been Titus Manlius Torquatus (consul 347 BC). Approximately every few generations they acquired the Quaestorship and minted legal tender, usually with their own motif, including a Celtic torc (which the founder took from a vanquished Celtic opponent). The torc does not appear on this coin, and is not represented by the beaded circle. Torquatus is not a civilian. He is a high officer in Sulla's victorious army, assigned the rank and the position by Sulla. =The delayed epiphany of Proquaestor Torquatus= Lucullus was the last to hold the position of Military Quaestor in 87, but Torquatus does not appear until 82. So it is unclear who was the original minter of Lucullean currency. Investigation of the further identity of Torquatus in the hope of clarification is complicated by the fact that all the men of the Torquatus family bear the same name and so are indistinguishable on the written page. There are definite appearances of Torquati but the connections between the persons are speculative at best. Putting aside the question of subsequent appearances, how far back can the known minter of Sulla be traced? How and when did Sulla meet and employ him? A presumption that he was the ghost minter of the Peloponnesus is by no means warranted: why would he not identify himself until 82? Between 84 and 82, all of Italy was torn by Sulla's second civil war, of greater impact by far than his First. It was a virtual \\"Return of Odysseus.\\" Torquatus apparently appears at the end of it on the side of the returned Sulla, but in what capacity is also unclear. In 85 BC it appeared that Sulla had brokered a lasting deal with Mithridates ending the First Mithridatic War. Mithridates would retire to his boundaries, offer the Romans no further resistance, and pay reparations, in return for which he would be molested no more. Sulla retired in jubilation to Athens, where he shopped for antiquities, acquired the books of Aristotle and travelled about the now peaceful countryside. He sought treatment also for the first onset of the disease that would kill him in 78, a numbness of the legs. Having had a rest, he wrote to the Senate. They had dishonored him in the legal pursuit of his duties, he said. He had been declared a public enemy. His honors were stripped, his property confiscated, his family driven into exile, and his friends murdered. As he was still in command, having never returned to Rome to relinquish it, as the law required, he was now coming home to settle the affair. The innocent had nothing to fear, but he would have vengeance on the guilty. The Senate was ordered to make restitution immediately. Received and read, this epistle dropped chaos on Italy. The Consuls for the year, Lucius Cornelius Cinna and Gnaeus Papirius Carbo, both Populares, had been in the field recruiting against the day of Sulla's return. The Senate decreed that they should cease these activities, and they agreed, but illegally declared themselves Consuls for 84, to avoid returning to Rome for any elections. In 84, receiving intelligence that Sulla planned to cross from Liburnia on the Balkan side, they began ferrying troops to there. Some crossed; the rest refused. In the attempt to enforce authority using Lictors, Cinna (with his Lictors) was stoned to death. Carbo brought the troops back. Due to bad auspices no replacement Consul was elected. Still Sulla delayed his coming. In 83 BC Lucius Cornelius Scipio Asiaticus (consul 83 BC) and Gaius Norbanus were Consules, both Populares. Sulla was expected through Liburnia. According to Appian, at the start of the campaign season Sulla left Piraeus, Port of Athens, with 5 legions and 6000 cavalry for the city of Patras on the coast of the Peloponnesus. There is no mention of how he got there, but any other method than ship would imply an unnecessary and troublesome march overland across the Peloponnesus or Central Greece. Plutarch has him making the latter march to Dyrrachium. Sulla could not have made both trips simultaneously, but his army included Greeks from Central Greece, including Macedonians. They might have chosen to use Dyrrachium. In any case, 1600 ships ferried 46000 men from Patrae to Brindisi, or 1200 ships from Dyrrachium, if you believe Plutarch, or possibly 2800 ships from both places with a round number of 79,000 men, taking control of the heel of Italy. They were welcome at Brindisi. The inscriptional trail of the Murenae =Far-flung inscription at Messene honoring Commander Murena= Walls of Messene. This title on a statue base discovered in 1913 in the marketplace of ancient Messene in the Peloponnesus became IG V 1 1454. Subsequently, it was found to be one of a group of three honoring Roman dignitaries Murena, Sulla and Agrippa, all three dubbed as SEG 48 494 (Murena),495, 496, dated 83-81 BC. There are some peculiarities with the presumption that they were actually there in a military role. First, the Peloponnesus was entirely at peace and fully cooperative with Sulla when he was before the walls of Athens, and did not need any Roman intervention or Roman commander. Second, Messene is far from the theatre where Murena was left in command. The presumption that the Peloponnesus would somehow naturally be hostile to Romans is based on a gap in the main testimonies. In Appian, Archelaus, failing to take Rhodes, is impelled to subdue the rest of Greece by turning them against each other. Archelaus enters Central Greece in 88 BC with Achaeans (Gulf of Corinth), Lacedaemonians and Boeotians. Their compliance in the light of subsequent events is forced and temporary, at least as far as the Boeotians are concerned. The whole of Central Greece rallies around Sulla's eagles. Appian details the defection of Boeotia but says not one word about the Peloponnesians, allowing the possibility that they were still hostile. Sulla did not have time for hostile Peloponnesians; in fact, he probably could not have kept his position in the Megarid faced with a coalition of Athenians and Peloponnesians. In Plutarch's Sulla he shortly sends out confiscation letters to the Temples at Epidaurus, Olympia, Delphi and elsewhere asking them to ship their treasures to the army in the Megrid, perhaps the Quaestorium at Eleusis — an absurd request to an enemy — and they are quick to comply. He then assigns Lucullus the task of establishing a mint in the Peloponnesus and striking much of the precious metal received into gold and silver coins to be used to pay the men, suggesting that the soldiers had the freedom of the markets there. If the Peloponnesians did not take much of a part in liberating Boeotia, at least they were on just as good terms with the Romans as the Boeotians. There was no reason for the Romans to maintain a special command for the Peloponnesus or promote anyone to commander there. The command mentioned in the inscription must be the one granted to Murena (father) in 84 BC. The date of the inscription is the same as the one from Rhodes, the period between Second and Third Mithridatic Wars, when the Greek states were trying to reassure the Romans of their continued loyalty. The reason why it is so far-flung remains to be discovered.In the main point of view, the wide-ranging public gratitude of the Greeks is matched by the wide-ranging naval efforts of Murena suppressing piracy in the Eastern Mediterranean. Even so, Messene is in Central Peloponnesus, not so vulnerable to attack and occupation from the sea, surrounded by the other Peloponnesians as possible allies. =Carian statues honoring Murena's sons= Ruins of Kaunos Residential quarter of Kaunos Among the main beneficiaries of Roman hegemony were the Karians, who set up an unusual number of statues with honorific tituli in this period. As well as A. Varro and his mother Paulla Terentia the honorands include the two sons of Sulla's Murena, Lucius and Gaius. Lucius is commemorated on a white marble base with cuttings for an equestrian statue. Gaius is commemorated on a circular white marble base with cuttings for a standing statue. Probably both sons departed Rome with their father early in 87 and remained with him throughout. Cicero ignores Gaius and only mentions young Lucius' service to his father at this time, as well as his participation in the father's eventual triumph.pro L. Murena 11-12 But Gaius' foot-statue erected along with the mounted ikon of their father, indicates that he was already 15 turning 16 in 87(R) and thus (just) old enough for a position on his father's staff. Gaius Murena's participation in this long period of eastern service in company with his own family and his adfinis Aulus Varro is significant to the history of Varrones Murenae, since it was most likely Gaius who made the son of his father's long-serving legatus his heir by testamentary adoption, thus creating the name Terentius Varro Murena for the first time (in 47 or 46 BC). The inscriptional trail of the Varrones =Carian statue honoring Varro's mother= Map of Caria. A round statue base from Selimiye thought to have been taken there from Euromos (Karia) registers Varro's mother's name, Paula (Pōlla) Terentia, and her presence in the east, probably among the numerous noble men and women who fled Rome and Italy during and immediately subsequent to the bellum Octavianum. While Sulla was away from Rome conducting operations against Mithridates his enemies persecuted and proscribed his friends and supporters and their families, causing them to seek refuge with his army in the east. This exodus was the prelude to Sulla's second civil war. The inscription is therefore dated to no later than 82 BC. =Bilingual text from Delos honoring fleet commander Varro= The bilingual text from Delos appears to be the latest known which includes the Roman ethnic, which is missing from the statue titulus for his mother. =Muster of the ship from Cos= A stele thought to have been set up at Samothrace.IG XII, 8 260 = IGR I 843 lists all the officers, specialist crew and marines who served aboard a quadrireme (tetreres) from Kos under the ship's captain (trierarchos) Kleonikos and the, evidently Rhodian, admiral (nauarchos) Eudamas. At the very top of the list A. Terentius A. f. Varro legatus appears as commander of the entire fleet (or perhaps \\"expedition\\"): ΤΟΥ ΣΤΟΛΟΥ ΠΑΝΤΟΣ. In combination with the Rhodian titulusSIG³ 745, above in which he and Murena imperator are singled out from the other three senior officials as public proxenoi and benefactors of the Rhodian damos, this document demonstrates that A. Varro was Murena's principal fleet commander in the joint land and sea operations with the Rhodians in 84. Appian entirely omits these in his account of the Mithridatic Wars,Mith.64ff. but briefly alludes to Murena's anti-piracy campaign in the later context of the famous Pompeian bellum Piraticum.Mith.93. See also Cicero Verr.II i.89-90 on the new fleet Murena was obliged to order built in 84 to combat piracy: Decem enim navis iussu L. Murenae populus Milesius ex pecunia vectigali populo Romano fecerat, sicut pro sua quaeque parte Asiae ceterae civitates. [. . .] in ea classe quae contra piratas aedificata sit. In his extant geography Strabo (XIII 4.17 = 631 ed.Casaubon) briefly alludes to Murena overrunning the Milyas and deposing the last tyrant of Kibyra, Moagetes. He no doubt covered these events in detail in his (lost) Historiai.

Species richness is the fundamental unit in which to assess the homogeneity of an environment. Therefore, any reduction in species richness, especially endemic species, could be argued as advocating the production of a homogenous environment. Monocultures Homogeneity in agriculture and forestry; in particular, industrial agriculture and forestry use a limited number of species.Luc Hens and Emmanuel K. Boon Causes of Biodiversity Loss: a Human Ecological Analysis, MultiCiencia. Human Ecology Department, Belgium. About 7,000 plants (2.6% of all plant species) have been collected or cultivated for human consumption. Of these, a mere 200 have been domesticated and only a dozen contribute about 75% of the global intake of plant-derived calories. 95% of world consumption of protein derives from a few domesticated species, i.e. poultry, cattle and pigs. There are about 1,000 commercial fish species, but in aquaculture fewer than 10 species dominate global production. Human food production therefore rests on the tips of pyramids of biodiversity, leaving the majority of species not utilised and not domesticated. Species migration Species naturally migrate and expand their ranges, utilising new habitats and resources, e.g. the cattle egret. These natural invasions, an incursion in the absence of anthropogenic influences, occur \\"when an intervening barrier is removed, or through the development of biotic or abiotic transportation mechanisms, able to overcome the barrier in question\\".Drake, J.A., Mooney, H.A., Castri, F.di., Groves, R.H., Kruger, F.J., Rejmánek, M. and Williamson, M. (1989). Biological Invasions: A Global Perspective, SCOPE 37. John Wiley and Sons. Introductions, or human-mediated invasions, have in the last century become more frequent. It is estimated that on an average day more than 3,000 species alone are in transit aboard ocean-going vessels. Using species richness as the unit for which to assess global homogeneity, it appears that anthropogenic assistance in alien species establishment has done much to reduce the number of endemic species, especially on remote islands. Some 'species-poor' habitats may, however, benefit in diversity if an invader can occupy an empty niche. Arguably, that environment becomes more diverse, equally it has also \\"become more similar to the rest of the world\\", though ecological interactions between the invaders and the natives are likely to be unique. Indeed, many species are so well naturalised that they are considered native, yet they were originally introduced; with the best examples probably being the Roman and Norman introduction of the hare and the rabbit respectively to Britain. Introduction of non-endemic species and subsequent eradication of species can happen remarkably fast; evolutionary tempo is, however, slow and \\"succession of rapid change [will] result in a great impoverishment\\". That impoverishment will indeed equate in a world that is more similar, as there will simply be less species to formulate difference.

In 1638, Orazio Falconieri purchased a palace on the Via Giulia which had a small courtyard facing the River Tiber.Rome: The Biography of a City by Christopher Hibbert (Penguin UK, 2001) He bought an adjacent property in 1645 and in 1646 and appointed the architect Francesco Borromini to remodel and refurbish the two. Some of Borromini’s work was lost in the nineteenth century development of Lungotevere, the embankment and road between the Tiber and the buildings which overlook it, but parts remain. The surviving parts of Borromini’s work include the façade to the Via Giulia, the Belvedere overlooking the Tiber and the decorative work in several rooms.Borromini by Anthony Blunt (Harvard University Press, 1979) On the façade, the number of bays was increased from seven to eleven and at either end, tall inverted fluted pilasters were placed terminating in falcons heads, a reference to the family name, that each look back at the façade. Overlooking the Tiber, Borromini added a Belvedere, a three bay loggia with Serliana openings, that stands above the surrounding buildings. On the interior, some of the rooms are ornamented with stucco work designed by Borromini, with the frequent use of heraldic devices and symbolic motifs References Palaces in Rome Rome R.

Originally called The Revelators they added Electric to the name in 2009 when they toured with The Animals and David \\"Honeyboy\\" Edwards. The band play an electric set of Chicago blues, Texas blues and British blues all with an indie twist. Their acoustic set is a mix of original and standard Delta blues they have performed at UK and European Blues Festivals since 2004. Style and techniques Feeling at home in the US as well as in the UK, Donahue musically draws from influences of both countries like Celtic music, rock, blues and country. Technically, Donahue mostly plays in fingerpicking or hybrid picking style with his right hand. However, his left hand technique made him famous among guitar players. Technically Gregory's style of playing slide guitar is fingerpicking, and plays guitar on his lap, he plays acoustic guitar in normal position but once again he will use finger style playing. Gregory's harmonica style or better known as blues harp is strongly influenced by Chicago players such as Junior Wells and Little Walter. Gordon Wride's guitar technique is reliant on a heavy rhythm to complement the intricate styles of Donahue and Gregory, he will use both plectrum and hybrid picking Wride's slide technique is quite robust in the style of Son House and Jack White (musician) vocal style and influence is based on the early delta blues singers such as Robert Johnson, Skip James etc. Wride was also trained bel canto style by an operatic teacher for many years.

The festival's run spans nine days in mid-July, starting on the first Friday after Independence Day. It is a celebration of the heritage of Fort Wayne, established during the French and Indian War at the confluence of three rivers, the Maumee, St. Marys, and St. Joseph. Events include a community parade through downtown, a food alley, amusement rides, a bed race, art and craft shows, children's and seniors mini-fests, an International Village, a shopping marketplace, Rivergames and a fireworks finale.http://www.trfonline.org/ History At the first Three Rivers Festival in 1969, an estimated 100,000 people attended a grand parade, and 60 events on the Columbia Street Landing. The festival in 1973 attracted one million visitors. Among its highlights was the air show by the Navy's Blue Angels. In 1976, the Nation's Bicentennial, the festival included an international beer can collectors convention. That year attendance topped 2 million. In 1977, the festival added fireworks for the first time, and its opening day parade was the second largest in the state. When the festival opened in 1979, seven hundred balloons were released from the top of a city building. By 1980, the festival has grown to 206 events across the city. The following year, the festival introduced a children's parade and attempted to set a record for the World's Longest Hot Dog, at long. Two years later the festival featured the World's Biggest Pretzel, at in diameter.http://lcweb2.loc.gov/diglib/legacies/IN/200003008.html The festival has continued to grow and add new attractions and fun events. In 1991 a $20,000 Arts United grant expanded Sunday in the Park to art events at Seniors Day and the Children's Festival. By 1999, the Art in the Park was expanded to include Main Street, featuring a juried show of 85 national artists. That same year, the Three Rivers Festival enjoyed crowds in excess of 500,000, maintaining its position as the second largest event in Indiana. 2020 saw its first cancellation as the COVID-19 pandemic was to blame. The 52nd was deferred to 2021. Financial  Three Rivers Festival is a 501(c)4 not-for- profit organization, founded in 1969, and funded entirely by vendor participation fees, souvenir sales, refreshment sales, entertainment ticket sales, and the sponsorship and support of area businesses. For 2009 and 2010, Fort Wayne Newspapers was the Festival Title sponsor. National Serv-all was the 2010 sponsor of the Fireworks Finale. PNC, Sweetwater and STAR 88.3 were other major 2010 sponsors. Three Rivers Festival Events As the second largest festival in Indiana, the Three Rivers Festival has family-friendly events, centered in Headwaters Park in downtown Fort Wayne, Indiana. Many affiliated events are featured throughout the Fort Wayne area. Art In The Park The first weekend of the Festival features \\"Art in the Park\\", a juried fine arts show & sale, located on Freimann Square, Main Street and Barr Street, adjacent to the Arts United Center and the Fort Wayne Museum of Art in downtown Fort Wayne. Over 100 talented artists from northeast Indiana and across the country offer oils, watercolors, photography, sculpture, pottery, and more. Opening Day Parade Beginning in the historic West Central neighborhood, the two-hour parade fills winds through downtown Fort Wayne. A local musical group typically opens the parade with the national anthem, followed by many parade units, area high school marching bands, local celebrities, the \\"Queen Bee\\" Helium Balloon from Vera Bradley, and approximately 100 other entries. The Parade is broadcast live on Indiana's NewsCenter, with a repeat broadcast in early evening. The Parade route distance is approximately two miles, winding through the West Central Neighborhood and downtown. The first Parade unit steps off at approximately 9:45 a.m., and arrives at the downtown broadcast point shortly after 10:00 a.m. The Parade ends at Calhoun and Superior Streets. Fireworks Finale Tens of thousands of area residents eagerly await Northeast Indiana's largest pyrotechnic show, marking the close of nine days of Three Rivers Festival.

The motivation for coming up with this model (and others like it) is to compensate for the lack of \\"traces\\" in such storage devices. A \\"trace\\" is simply a logging of a set of data regarding the performance of the storage device, focusing on the I/O requests: how many read/write operations, the size of each request, the exact address (LUN-wise), and a time-stamp. Accurate, valid and detailed traces of actual storage systems are very difficult to get for the purpose of academic analysis (for reasons that are beyond the scope of this article), and that is why such models are a necessity. Usually, the data that is available is much coarser and low in quality, in comparison to a full trace: For example, the data might record for every unit of time T, the number of I/Os that took place at each LUN (or track), along with the total hit/miss ratios. For example: For a disk drive with 4 tracks, A, B, C and D and after 15 minutes of work, the I/O requests were the following: 7600, 20, 50, 6000 for A, B, C and D respectively. It is easy to see why this data is insufficient to determine the actual workload: Consider a second even more simple example: Two tracks, A and B, which each have 1,000 I/Os during 15 minutes. To answer the simple question, \\"How hard did the disk work during those 15 minutes?\\" then consider these two following scenarios: *(I) The disk first received and responded to all 1,000 I/O requests at track A, and later, all 1,000 I/Os of track B. *(II) The disk received and responded to an I/O request from a different track interchangeably: First at A, then at B, then A again, alternating A/B up to 1000 times. It is easy to see that, at each of these scenarios, the amount of work done by the disks is very different (in the first scenario, the case being that the disk did a minimal amount work, not having to travel between tracks more than once, and in the second scenario, a maximal amount of work). The I.R.M. was first introduced by E. Coffman and P. Denning, and it is still in active use today. It is the most simplified model. In this \\"memoryless\\" model, every I/O reference represents an i.i.d multinomial random variable, whose outcome is the location of the next reference track. Thus, arrivals to any given track must occur at a specific average rate, which is directly proportional to the probability of requesting the track. More specifically, the arrival rate of requests to a given track equals its access probability, of being referenced, multiplied by the overall rate of requests. That is, we denote N as the sum of all the I/O requests (both read and write) and assign to each track the probability the number of I/Os, which came from it, divided by N. In the case of our first example: N = 7600 + 20 + 50 + 6000 = 13,670 and we'll assign the following probabilities to each track: : A -> 7600/N, B -> 20/N, C -> 50/N and D -> 6000/N. The benefit of this model, other than being simple and easy to work with, is its conservative property. This means that when analyzing the worst-case-scenario, we cannot be off by very much in the result of the model, as illustrated in the following example: * Going back to the second example: :: In the best- case-scenario - the disk only traveled once from A to B, and in the worst- case, the disk traveled 2,000 times back or forth. :: Using the I.R.M. model (a technical computation that will not be brought here), then the expectancy is 1,000 travels between tracks. :: That is: the result was off from the worst-case-scenario by a multiple of two, while in the best-case-scenario, it actually spared a multiple of 1,000! Indeed, it can be proven that the I.R.M. model always satisfies that it is always \\"off\\" by, at most, a multiple of two.

After his death both his will and his remains became caught up in the struggle around the Protestant Reformation in England. Life He was a justice in the reigns of Henry VII and Henry VIII, and was made sheriff in 1513. He adopted Martin Luther's religious views, and shortly before his death in 1530 he made a will in which he expressed his belief in justification by faith, and refused to make any bequests to the clergy. Objection was taken to the will as an heretical document when it came to be proved in the ecclesiastical courts, and eventually it was brought before convocation. After prolonged discussions, the will was pronounced heretical on 27 February 1532 by Archbishop William Warham. Tracy was declared unworthy of Christian burial, and Warham directed Dr. Thomas Parker, vicar-general of the bishop of Worcester, to exhume Tracy's body. Parker exceeded his instructions, and had Tracy's remains burnt at the stake. Aftermath Richard Tracy, the younger son who, with his mother, was executor to the will, induced Thomas Cromwell to take the matter up, and Parker had eventually to pay a fine. Tracy's will became a sort of sacred text to the reformers; possessing copies of it was frequently made a charge against them. In 1535 was published The Testament of Master Wylliam Tracie, esquier, expounded both by William Tindall (i.e. William Tyndale, who knew Tracy well) and Jhō Frith (i.e. John Frith); other editions appeared in 1546, 1548 and 1550.It is reprinted in the Works of Tyndale (Parker Society), iii.268–83. The will is also printed in Hall's Chronicle, pp. 796–7; Foxe, Actes and Mon.; Atkyns, Gloucestershire, pp. 410–11; and Rudder, Gloucestershire, pp. 771–2. Hugh Latimer, John Bale, and James Pilkington all used the incident in polemic fashion against the Catholic clergy. Family By his wife Margaret, daughter of Sir Thomas Throckmorton, William Tracy had issue two sons, William and Richard. William, the elder, inherited the Toddington estates, and was great-grandfather of Sir John Tracy, in 1642–43 created Baron and Viscount Tracy of Rathcoole in the peerage of Ireland. Robert Tracy, the judge, was younger son of the second viscount. The peerage became extinct on the death of Henry Leigh Tracy, eighth viscount, on 29 April 1797.

History Castell Gwallter was built around 1120 by Walter de Bec, who was one of the tenants of Gilbert Fitz Richard. Walter was a \\"distinguished knight who had chief command at the 'Battle of the Standard' in 1138, and is said to have stood on the wagon of the Standards, and to have inspired his troops by an oration in a voice like a trumpet\\". He was one of the great feudal knights with estates in the North of England. The castle was captured in 1136 by Owain Gwynedd but was retaken in 1153 by Lord Rhys and his brothers. After this, history does not relate what happened to the castle, but it may have been demolished. The site Castell Gwallter is situated in a prominent position about half a mile west of the village of Llandre. It is one of about 300 castles of its type in the area built to try to subdue the Welsh, a motte-and-bailey type fortification which originally had a tower built on a large mound. The motte is surrounded by a ditch and the inner bailey is small, and is surrounded by a larger outer enclosure. The whole site is very well-preserved and as there is no sign of building stone on top of the mound, the tower may have been made of wood. There is steep ground to the east and the north which provides natural defences, and the site is about higher than St Michael’s Church, Llandre to which it is adjacent. Visitor information The castle is on private land but can be seen from a public right of way which passes close by.

His ironic name is based on that of Willy Loman from Arthur Miller's play Death of a Salesman. Lowman is played by real-life Hells Angel David Labrava. Lowman is the enforcer for the Sons of Anarchy Motorcycle Club, and is affiliated with the Tacoma, Washington charter at the beginning of the series but later becomes a nomad (has no permanent charter). As of the episode \\"The Push\\", he is a patched in (official) member of the Sons of Anarchy Motorcycle Club Redwood Original (SAMCRO) charter. As of season 6, he is SAMCRO's Sergeant-at-Arms. Biography Happy, or \\"Hap\\" as called by SOA members is an enforcer for the Sons of Anarchy Motorcycle Club, and, along with Tig Trager, is commonly used to carry out the club's murders. He is from Tacoma, Washington but frequently visits the club's charter in Charming, California where he has a good relationship with the President, Clay Morrow. Hap mentions that his mother is from Bakersfield. A heartless assassin, he has been shown to enjoy acts of violence that even other members of the club are disturbed by. He has a Smiley (happy face) tattooed on him every time he kills someone. On his cut, he wears patches reading \\"Sgt. At Arms\\", \\"Unholy Ones\\", \\"Men Of Mayhem\\", and \\"In Memory of Opie\\". Sons of Anarchy =Season 1= Happy first appears in the pilot episode at a club meeting. The Mayans, a rival motorcycle gang, had stolen the club's guns and burned down their weapons storage warehouse. However, Juice Ortiz, the club's intelligence officer, had located the guns in San Leandro, and the following night, Jax Teller, Tig Trager, Chibs Telford, and Clay Morrow stole the guns back from an industrial storage warehouse. They also destroyed the warehouse and a heroin factory.Pilot - Recap Happy kills Esai Álvarez, the son of the Mayans President Marcus Álvarez, as payback for the Mayans' attempted hits on Clay and Ernest Darby. Esai's father sanctioned the hit in a jail-house deal with Clay in exchange for SAMCRO's selling guns to the Mayans. Happy pretended to be a churro vendor, and when Esai approached his stall, Happy stabbed him in the back of the neck with a knife. Happy is also seen in the closing moments of the episode, getting his 11th Smiley tattoo, documentimg Esai's murder.Hell Followed - Recap Happy states in the episode \\"Better Half\\" that his sick mother lives in Bakersfield, and that he is thinking of \\"going nomad\\" for a while to take care of her. Clay's response to that statement is, \\"There's always a seat at that table for you.\\" Happy drove Cherry and Cameron Hayes to Canada in one of Chief Unser's trucks at the end of this episode.Better Half - Recap In the final episode of the season, \\"The Revelator\\", Happy goes with Chibs and Tig to San Joaquin to kill the witness who identified Bobby Munson and Opie after the murder of Brenan Hefner. The safe house was being guarded by two sheriffs and a female ATF agent, but the trio managed to knock all three unconscious and gain entry to the house. When Tig saw that the witness was a teenage girl, he had initial doubts about killing her, and Happy showed his cold-bloodedness by offering to kill her instead. However, Tig stepped up, but just before he shot her, Jax came in and stopped him doing so at gunpoint. Jax then told Chibs and Happy to leave, and beat Tig up for killing Donna. Later in the episode, Happy, as well as Sons of Anarchy members from across the country, attended the funeral of Opie Winston's wife Donna, whom Tig had mistakenly killed.The Revelator - Recap =Season 2= At the beginning of the season, Happy has gone nomad but often returns to Charming to help the club. Since Chibs' near-fatal injury, Happy has been present at all of SAMCRO's dealings, possibly filling in until Chibs is well again. Happy was arrested, along with most members of SAMCRO, when they accidentally raid a Christian retreat and fall into a trap set by a White supremacy group. He served time in prison with fellow members Clay, Tig, Juice, Bobby, and Jax. At the end of the episode, he and the others are released. =Season 3= At the beginning of season 3, Happy is very involved with SAMCRO affairs, still providing muscle while SAMCRO tackles the aftermath of Abel (Jax's son)'s kidnapping. During Half-Sack's funeral, Chibs mentions that Happy will be transferring to SAMCRO. Happy goes with Piney and Bobby to get medicine for his sick mother, but is cornered by hillbillies who are trying to steal the illegal meds from Piney's friend. When the hillbillies try to make a deal with them the SOA fires at them, because they realize she supplies clinics. With help from SAMCRO Happy, Piney, and Bobby are all safe. In the episode \\"The Push\\", Happy is patched in as (becomes) an official SAMCRO member. In the next episode Happy accompanied SAMCRO to Belfast. When SAMCRO is arrested by officers and almost deported, the kidnappers interrogate them about who hired them. Jax tells Happy to kill one of the men, and Happy replies \\"Oh yes I will\\", but is stopped. A look into his dark mind is displayed when Liam O'Neill is being brutally tortured; Happy looks on in sheer delight while everyone else is visibly shaken. Happy is arrested with Jax, Clay, Tig, Bobby, and Juice in the season finale, and like the others, upon learning Jax ratted, has a look of hate on his face. When it is revealed SOA knew, and it was a Club plan, Hap laughs with the others. =Season 4= In the premiere, Happy and the other members are released. Happy and Tig love the \\"Jellybean\\", a strip club not known for the best or most hygienic dancers, where the Russians like to do business. Juice replies, \\"the freak circle is complete.\\" Later in the premiere while being followed by two officers, Happy serves as a distraction by kicking the side of the patrol car, which is what had gets them in custody later. In \\"Custody\\", on the side of the road, it's revealed Happy reuses condoms. He defends himself saying he's not cheap, just \\"mindful of excessive spending\\", which comes ip again in season 3, when he tells Clay his mother's medication is very costly and giving him money troubles, another reason he's willing to do runs and hits. Later in the same episode, Happy Juice, Bobby, and Chibs leave Opie and Lyla's wedding early to get their guns from the Russians and kill them. This is Juice's first kill for the club (that is mentioned or see on screen). Happy and Kozik are only mentioned in the next episode. In season 4 episode 3, Happy votes against becoming involved with the cartel, saying, \\"I'm sorry, but I'm a No.\\" In episode 3, it is revealed that he is a neat freak. In \\"With An X\\", when one of the bricks of the cartel's cocaine is stolen, Happy helps interrogate the prospects, pretending to bash Miles' hands with a hammer and locking them in a room with a loaded gun. When the thief is seemingly revealed to be Miles (actually Juice whom Miles caught, killed and planted the brick on), Happy shoots his body, calling him, \\"a lying bitch\\", and confirms to Clay that \\"he was VERY dead.\\" When Clay is shot, supposedly by the Niners (actually Opie, vengeful over Clay's murder of Piney) Happy agrees with Tig's attempted murder of Laroy (although Tig accidentally killed Laroy's girlfriend Veronica Pope), stating, \\"he's gotta to die, like A LOT.\\" In the finale, Happy is seen at a SAMCO meeting, taking Opie's old seat at the clubhouse table. =Season 5= Happy is seen with the rest of the club in the season premiere when their shipment of cocaine is attacked by Niners, in revenge for Tig's murder of Laroy's girlfriend Veronica Pope. Happy is unintimidated by Roosevelt's threats to control their problems, to prevent them from hurting Charming, or he will call in Gang Task Force. When Opie is killed by black prisoners while inside, on orders of Veronica's father Damon Pope, Happy is present at his wake. Happy is later seen again in \\"Andare Pescare\\" helping Jax, Tig, Chibs, and Bobby track the man who beat Opie to death, who's revealed to be the cousin of the Grim Bastards MC President T.O. Cross. When Tig suggests tracking down the man themselves and bashing his head in, Happy states \\"Second that\\". In \\"To Thine Own Self\\" Happy is present during the dispute with Nero's old gang and accompanies Jax, Chibs, and Tig to meet with them. When they get into a high-speed chase/shootout, Happy's head is grazed by a bullet; he is shown to not be seriously injured and gets a thrill out of getting shot. =Season 6= Happy has become the new sergeant-at- arms after Bobby's resignation as Vice President and Chibs' promotion. Happy is taken by the Chinese, to be held captive until they receive the second-in- command for the IRA. He later kills the Chinese and receives another smiley tattoo for killing a rat for Caccuza. =Season 7= Mayans M.C. =Season 1= Happy makes his debut in the season finale: \\"Cuervo/Tz'ikb'uul\\", wherein it is revealed Happy killed Marisol Reyes, the mother of the series protagonist Ezekiel \\"EZ\\" Reyes and his brother Angel Reyes. =Season 2= EZ comes closer to cracking into Happy Lowman's involvement with killing operations for SAMCRO, including the murder of his own mother. In the second episode, EZ reveals the truth to his brother Angel about their mother's death and that he got information on the side about her killer; Happy Lowman, and his history with SAMCRO. Angel and EZ travel to Charming and break into Happy's house, holding him at gunpoint. The Reyes brothers try to get answers from a tied up Happy, but he refuses to speak until they threaten his dog, Opie. He explains the hit was for both their parents and that the order came from Mexico. He promises to get more information from his contact and that they will be even.

The Royal Commission on the Ancient and Historical Monuments of Wales notes the possible presence of a counterscarp on the lower ground. History Ystrad Peithyll Castle was built in the wake of the Norman occupation of Wales under Henry I. It was inhabited by a steward named Razo (also referred to as Razon or Ralf), under the command of Gilbert Fitz Richard who had been named Lord of Cardigan in 1110. The castle was one of several fortifications attacked in the rebellion led by Gruffydd ap Rhys (1113 or 1116). The structure was surrounded by enemy forces before being overrun. Many of the inhabitants were killed and the castle itself was set on fire and largely destroyed.

In 1969 Bassey moved her home to Lugano, Switzerland, with her second husband Sergio Novak, whom she had married in Las Vegas in August 1968.

Does Anybody Miss Me has remained part of her live show and was recorded as the opening track of the album Live At Talk Of The Town in 1970. This album saw Bassey re-record her 1958 UK #1 hit single As I Love You which she had previously released on the Philips label. Also issued in the US as Does Anybody Miss Me there the album did not include the re- recording of As I Love You and Think Of Me. The original album was issued in mono and stereo.

If blood pressure falls below critical closing pressure, then the vessels collapse. This happens during the measurement of blood pressure with a sphygmomanometer. At resting state the arterial critical closing pressure is ~ 20 mmHg. Critical closing pressure in arteries is higher than the mean vascular filling pressure that develops after death (~7 mmHg). Therefore, arteries collapse after death, then fill up with air once the dissection begins. In severe haemorrhage, blood loss leads to a significant reduction in pressure.

It is a sports college, as well as the second largest school in Calderdale, behind Trinity Academy. The school currently has over 1,700 students and over 250 members of staff. History The school was founded in Elland, Calderdale, in the county of West Yorkshire, England almost 300 years ago by Joseph Brooksbank. Brooksbank grew up in Elland, but left the town at the age of sixteen to become a haberdasher’s apprentice in London. He was described as a promising and prosperous young man, whose enterprising spirit was rewarded with the title of Citizen of the City of London in 1681. His social standing was reflected by his marriage in 1679 to 'Mary, daughter of Richard Stamp, merchant, of The City and of Reading, and niece of the Thomas Stamp who became Lord Mayor in 1691'. A final accolade was bestowed upon him when he was appointed a Master of the Haberdashers Company in 1718. However, Joseph never forgot his local roots and, in 1712, he founded a new school in his hometown. The original Brooksbank School was opened to help forty impoverished children of Elland to learn to read without fees and to write for a charge of one penny a week. Joseph’s son, Stamp, who was born in 1694, became a director of the Bank of England by the age of thirty-six and was appointed the governor of the bank from 1741-1743. Stamp, who was also a Member of Parliament, had reached millionaire status at the time of his death in 1756. In the same year, Stamp’s son, also called Joseph, increased the Brooksbank connection with Elland by generously providing the school with a second endowment. Little is known about what happened over the following hundred years as records are scarce. The school moved its premises to Westgate. Charity Commissioners, who inspected the school in 1829, reported that forty children were attending and that the schoolmaster was being paid a salary of £70 a year. As the years passed, there was a requirement for improved educational opportunities and it was decided that Elland needed a brand new building infrastructure in a better location. The elevated green fields along Victoria Road were chosen and building work began. An impressive new school, whose classical facade remains intact today, opened to approximately one hundred pupils on 12 September 1911; it was named Elland and District Secondary School. In 1933, the school’s reputation for academic achievement was growing and it was renamed Elland Grammar School to reflect this. As a result, the learning flourished and the number of pupils on roll began to rise. Twenty-five years later, as the nation embraced the idea of comprehensive education, the school shed its grammar school identity and embraced the ethos of equal educational opportunities for all students regardless of ability. A new name was needed to reflect the new ethos and the school looked to its founding forefathers and chose to revive the name Brooksbank. A series of major extensions have been added since then, and The Brooksbank School is now home to a learning community of around 1,700 young people. Campus Classroom extensions and gym The school is located on the west side of Elland, and is a five-minute walk from the town centre, and south of the accessible M62 motorway. It has bus links to locations including Halifax, Huddersfield, Brighouse and Wakefield. Facilities include a sports hall, four tennis courts, three drama studios, a playing field and a gymnasium. Brooksbank School sponsored sports include badminton, table tennis, and rugby. Extracurricular activities Extracurricular activities include both football and rugby. The school plays rugby league and competes in national school competitions. Since 2009 the school has been in the national championship final 8 times, winning 5 of these 8 appearances. Each year, the school performs a drama production. The school has over 40 clubs and societies.

Rode also invented and created the first workable RFID products: workplace entry cards, for which he held several patents. Early life France was born in Nožice, Slovenia on November 20, 1934 to farmers father Jože and mother Pepca, born Prešeren, as the oldest of four children. His younger sister Agata and brothers Marko and Aleš completed the family. France started elementary school education in nearby Homec soon after the German occupation of Slovenia during the Second World War. A few months into the first school year the local Partisans burned the school building and the children were prevented from attending formal schooling for the duration of the war. After the war, until the school in Homec was rebuilt, France’s class met in the local church rectory or in a Gasthouse in the mornings and reported for work at the school construction site in the afternoon. Due to an accelerated learning program, France completed the fourth grade in Homec in 1947 and in the fall of the same year began attending high school in Kamnik. He skipped the fifth grade by studying and passing exams designed for the fifth grade during the summer months. Education and academic interests His academic interests at that time were in mathematics, physics and natural sciences. Whenever he had to study, France was excused from farm work. However, living on the farm allowed him no time for extracurricular activities for which he envied his schoolmates. Only occasionally he managed to join his peers after school. His fondest memories of such activities include participating in the staging of Hamlet, directed by Ciril Gostič, brother of operas singer Joze Gostic, France’s Godfather. His nostalgic memories also include skiing trips to Mala Planina and staying with his ski buddies in “Steletova koča.” Living on the farm did have some side benefits. France learned hard work habits and discovered his inventive drive. In his uncle’s carpentry shop next door, he built his own toys and later tools that were otherwise too expensive to buy. He made the slide rule he used during all his academic years in Ljubljana. France planned to study mathematics at Ljubljana University, but altered his interest to electrical engineering after he visited the University’s electrical engineering laboratories. He never regretted this switch. He felt that in this field he would be able to combine his interest in mathematics with some hands-on work. Early work France’s early contact with the world outside Slovenia (which was at that time part of Yugoslavia), were two summer jobs in Germany and a few school excursions. These contacts subsequently led him to visit companies in Sweden, Denmark, the Netherlands, and Germany, which exposed him to advanced technologies of that era. They also triggered in him a desire to learn more about new places and people. Soon after his graduation in Ljubljana, he filed an application at Northwestern University in Evanston, Illinois and in November 1960 he boarded the Slovenian ship Bohinj. France earned a master's degree in bio-medicine at Northwestern University in 1962. In September of the same year he joined Hewlett-Packard Company in Palo Alto, California where he worked periodically for over twenty years. Pioneering work on pocket calculator France’s subsequent contribution was just as vital for HP as the former and it consisted of the first integrated circuit designed within the company. The engineers and the management were anxiously awaiting the arrival of the processed chip, which arose from France’s cutting and pasting of its layout. Being armed with two most important technologies that catapulted Silicon Valley, France was the obvious choice for carrying the intricate load of designing the miniature processor for HP-35, the first scientific pocket calculator. While he did not get the recognition of having designed the first microprocessor in the world, France’s HP-35 calculating unit had all the characteristics associated with a microprocessor. It had a complete instruction set for controlling its arithmetic units. The algorithms for trigonometric and logarithmic algorithms took advantage of this instruction set which has put the slide rule out of business. But it also opened the door to a new genre of pocket calculators. Using the same hardware as the HP-35, France designed the HP-80 business calculator, that replaced reams of tables used to compute mortgages, returns on investments and other business transactions with a dedicated keyboard. France also foresaw the need for a laptop style computer and has proposed and then led to completion the development of the Briefcase Computer. Hewlett-Packard oscilloscopes had a poor reputation and the top management asked the central Research & Development Laboratory to do something about it. A new promising concept called for an integrated processor and France was asked to help. For him this was such an easy task that he found time to enrich the final prototype named “Smart Scope” with many vital ideas, which later became topics of his doctoral dissertation in 1975. Entrepreneurial path In 1979 France established the company Sielox Inc., which was to develop electronic locks and security devices based on one of his patents. In the same pursuit he also established cooperative relationship with Ljubljana University and with the Slovenian microelectronics firm ISKRA for purposes of manufacturing the required microchips. In 1986 Sielox was acquired by Checkpoint Systems and France became their R&D; vice president. In 1990 he moved to Trimble Navigation, where he participated in efforts to embed the new satellite based navigation GPS into airplanes and with additional equipment enable them for blind landing. During the last two years at Trimble Navigation France was heavily involved with attempts to redesign and then integrate the GPS receiver into only two chips. This effort led him to join his two coworkers who established a new company called eRide Inc. Their goal was to design novel GPS receivers, which would make it possible to navigate under diverse condition such as inside the buildings or in other reflective environments but primarily inside a wristwatch.

Ayesha's mother, Dr Aarti returns from Pune and is shocked by the news. Remy tells the police that the family's other servant, Chetan, has also been missing since Ayesha's murder. It is also revealed that Ayesha was pregnant and had a boyfriend named Riyaz. Evidence from the early stages of the investigation lead the detectives to believe that Dr Sachin is the prime suspect, and he is thus taken under judicial custody. The case goes to CBI and Officer Sunil Paraskar (Kay Kay Menon) takes charge. Not convinced with the evidence, he begins a fresh investigation. He soon discovers that Sachin is having an extra-marital affair with Brinda (Mita Vashisht), a former actress who is married to Sachin's colleague, Dr Hansal. Hansal is aware of the relationship and the couples frequent stays in a five- star hotel. Once, while following Sachin and Brinda, he spots Ayesha and Riaz in the same hotel. Sachin also sees his daughter and warns Ayesha to break up with Riyaz. The two separate but Riyaz continues to sneak into Ayesha's house when her parents are away. Hansal, who lives in the building right across the Mahajans', sees Riyaz enter the house one night, and deliberately calls Sachin to inform him. In a drunk state, and unable to control his anger, Sachin attacks Riyaz with a surgical knife, injuring him on the arm. In a bid to save Riyaz, Ayesha hits her father on the head and he falls unconscious. Panicked, the two drag Sachin to his room and put him to bed. Riyaz leaves and Ayesha goes to sleep. Paraskar is thus convinced that Sachin is not the killer. Brinda hires a prominent lawyer, who succeeds in getting Sachin out on bail. After the trial, Sachin tells Aarti that he wants a divorce, and afterwards he books into a hotel with Brinda. Paraskar hunts down Riyaz, who has been hiding since the murder. During the interrogation, Paraskar and Riyaz are attacked and Riyaz is later found dead. Paraskar also discovers missing servant Chetan's dead body in the Mahajan house, adding to the mystery. Soon after, Chetan's relative Sudhakar Mishra is killed as well. Paraskar then interrogates Remy, and it is revealed that she had previously given birth, contrary to her earlier claims of never having been in a relationship. He meets her mother, who points out to a picture of a younger Remy, and the pieces finally fall in place, ending the investigation. At the hotel, Sachin's dead body is found and the local police conclude that he committed suicide due to the guilt from the case. However, Paraskar is not convinced and summons Aarti, Remy, Brinda, Hansal, Riyaz's parents and local police officers to the Mahajan house, where Ayesha was killed. He reveals that Ayesha was not the biological child of Aarti but was instead the daughter of Remy. Remy and Sachin had an affair when they were younger, but class differences did not allow Sachin to marry her, so he married Aarti instead. However, Aarti is infertile so the couple decided to adopt a child. Sachin pretends to adopt a child, bringing home his daughter with Remy. He also hires Remy as a full-time maid and nanny. As Ayesha begins to grow, Aarti notices the striking similarity between her daughter and Remy, and realises the truth. As revenge, she plots to frame her husband when she gets the opportunity. Paraskar reveals that Aarti had returned the night Aayesha died and not the next day as she had claimed. She was the one who killed Ayesha and later killed Chetan as well, since he had seen her walking out of Aayesha's room covered in blood. To complete her revenge, Aarti then visits Sachin under the guise of serving him divorce papers, and kills him. Finally, Paraskar reveals that Riyaz and Sudhakar Mishra were killed by a corrupt local policeman, who was being bribed by Aarti. As Aarti is being arrested, she smirks at a distraught Remy, happy with the fact that she has killed her child and lover. Cast *Kay Kay Menon as C.B.I.

Plus, there's the emotional quotient of the parents being accused of murdering their only daughter, something that the Indian audience has always felt for.\\" Shooting for the film completed prior to the verdict announcement and Gupta stated that he was not using the film to \\"pass a verdict\\" on anyone involved with the case. The production, along with two similar proposed films by different filmmakers, was met with some criticism by the Talwar family, who stated that they would seek legal recourse against any media adaptation of the murder case. Gupta later responded to this by stating that the film was intended to be a complete work of fiction and that he did not use any of the real names of people involved with the murder. He went on to say that the film would center upon a CBI investigator trying to uncover the truth of his daughter's murder and that he had never definitively stated that Rahasya would be based on the Aarushi murder case. Rahasya was issued a U/A certificate by the Censor Board in January 2014 and they deemed that the film was dissimilar to the murder case. The Talwar family initially requested permission to screen Rahasya before it released to the general public and upon receiving no response from Gupta or the production company, filed a case against the film stating that they felt that it would potentially distort facts about their daughter's death. The case was settled through the Bombay high court, where it was decided that one member of the Talwar family would screen the film but would not disclose to any outlet how the film ended. After the screening an advocate for the Talwar family filed a request for a stay of the film's release, stating that although the censor board had deemed that the film and the murder case were not similar that there were \\"over 100 similarities\\" that were not listed on the affidavit.

Biography He was born in 1958. Kavita (Granthali, 1990) a collection of his early poetry and Search Engine (Granthali, 2004). These collections have been followed by three volumes of poetry - All that I Wanna Do (Abhida Nantar, 2005), Mutatis Mutandis (2006) and Two Poems (2006). His two books, '1,2,3... Happy Galaxy' and collection of present poetry 'Smiles' (2007) was published by Abhida Nantar in 2007. In 1982, he edited Sankalp: A collection of essays by social activists in Maharashtra. It was awarded the Marathi Sahitya Parishad award. His second book, the novel Ashant Parva (Season of Unrest, 1992), concerns itself with the construction of a politically sensitive self in post-industrial India. With his solo exhibition of watercolours, Rumour of the Truth (2003), held in Mumbai, Chennai and Delhi, Khandekar occasioned the arrival of his pictorial vocabulary. In 2004, his installation entitled, FLEX- The Fluid Less Sex, was on display at an International fashion show in New Delhi. The following year he exhibited two installations, \\"All That I Wanna Do\\" and \\"La Peau de Chagrin\\", at Museum Art Gallery and Pundole Art Gallery respectively. And though the exhibitions were held concurrently and addressed the plangent landscape of capitalism, Khandekar approached both the exhibitions fortified with two distinctive registers. In mid-2006 Tits n Clits n Elephant Dick, his exhibition of paintings, sculptures and installations held at Jehangir Art Gallery, with contributions from Vaishali Narkar, became controversial when the Mumbai Police stopped its public viewing. The installation was an inquiry into the conflicting realities of market driven societies and their peculiar cultural logic. He concluded the year 2006, with a solo exhibition of his painting and installations, What do I love when I love you, my God? At The Fourth Floor gallery in Mumbai. The works attempted to underline a link between shopping bulimia and religious fundamentalism, a last-ditch strategy for late capitalist, consumer societies. In the year 2007,He had another solo exhibition,'Kegel Exercises' (Aswani Mudra) at Pundole Art Gallery, Mumbai .He displayed marble inlay works, inlaid with share market ticker tape and its abstract distortions. The show also included 'Encore' audio installation. Same year, i.e. in 2007. He had one more major show titled as 'Acquire, Merge or Collaborate..' At Ashish Balram Nagpal Galleries, Mumbai; exhibition his paintings and a sculpture. He used scanned electron micrographs (SEM) images and share market ticker tape numbers to obtain a unique motif. In addition to these exhibitions Khandekar has partaken of several group and Web-based exhibitions. Khandekar has also written articles on environmental issues in various dailies and magazines. From 1990-1995, he edited the magazine Sujan, for an NGO of the same name. Khandekar has worked on several international projects in senior managerial capacities, for both large Indian and multinational corporations.

Facts Chase Manhattan Bank was in the highly speculative business of lending money against receipts from five future movies (in this case, Amy Foster, U Turn, Apt Pupil, The Mirror Has Two Faces and The People vs. Larry Flynt). The bank wanted to protect against its substantial risk. So it took out a policy of insurance with HIH Insurance. Intermediaries who knew about movies, much more than either the bank or the insurer, negotiated. The bank made a claim for insurance cover. HIH resisted the bank's claim and in doing so alleged misrepresentations, both negligent and fraudulent by the bank’s agents (not the bank itself). The insurance contract had disclaimers for misrepresentations by the bank. One issue was whether the disclaimers could absolve the bank of liability for misrepresentation. Judgment All of the judges except Lord Steyn gave a speech. The majority of the House of Lords (Lord Bingham, Lord Steyn, Lord Hoffmann, Lord Hobhouse) held the disclaimers could exclude liability for negligent misrepresentation, but not for fraud, were it established. One could exclude liability for someone else's fraud, but not for one's own. They said that to try to exclude liability for one's own fraud would be contrary to public policy.

It was developed by Susannah and Ya'Acov Darling Khan, who directed the Moving Centre School Europe, representing Gabrielle Roth and the 5Rhythms in Europe until 2007. Movement Medicine integrates physical, artistic, spiritual, shamanic and therapeutic practices so as to stimulate human creativity, healing and transformation, focussing on the relationship with ourselves, each other, the earth, and the spirit of life. It is non-denominational, aiming to answer the spiritual impulse without the need for dogma or belief. The Movement Medicine practice is meant to give people tools to integrate the freedom and aliveness of the dance into daily life. Besides 5Rhythms, Movement Medicine is influenced by shamanism, Helen Poynor's \\"Walk of Life\\" movement work,Poynor, Helen. Walk of Life. Retrieved 24 October 2013. and global environmental initiatives such as the \\"Awakening the Dreamer\\" Symposium.Pachamama Alliance. . Retrieved 24 October 2013. Although not a social movement in the traditional sense of the word, the practice shows similarities with the Human Potential Movement and the New Age movement, sharing interest in a search for self actualization, empowerment and spiritual transformation. There is a professional organization of Movement Medicine Teachers and Facilitators, and a Registered Charity which sponsors dancers from different countries to train to teach the practice. Maps of Movement Medicine Movement Medicine works with 4 different 'maps', which focus on different aspects of life in general and the dance practice in particular. Each map is accompanied by different tools, exercises and practices. Firstly, the map of the 4 Aristotelian elements, Earth, Fire, Water and Air is foundational to Movement Medicine. According to Ya'Acov and Susannah Darling Khan, these elements provide an opportunity to explore different movement qualities, and provide a language of metaphor to support the practice. Each element is considered to exist both inside and outside the dancer, who connects to them through movement and imagination. Secondly, \\"the 5 dimensions of awareness\\" concern different dimensions of moving between micro and macro, individual, inter-personal and global. These are called \\"the 5 dimensions of awareness\\": Self, Relational, Environmental, Ancestral and Divine. The practice supports movement across each of these. According to Ya'Acov Darling Khan, trance is like \\"discovering that you've got second, third, fourth, and fifth gears of perception when you've been ambling along in first.\\" The third map, called \\"the 9 Gateways\\" provides an orientation in space and time and reflects the following 9 aspects of life, divided into groups of three, called \\"Journeys\\": 1 Body, 2 Heart, 3 Mind, 4 Past, 5 Present, 6 Future, 7 Fulfilment 8 Interconnection, 9 Realisation. The 1st \\"Journey\\" covers the first three gateways; Body, Heart and Mind. In Movement Medicine, this is represented as a vertical axis from the feet, through the head upwards, and back down again. The 2nd \\"Journey\\" explores the 4th, 5th, and 6th gateways, which are Past, Present and Future, which are said to form an axis through time, with the 'present' represented in the body, connected horizontally to the past (behind) and future (in front). The \\"3rd Journey\\", which is visualised as a horizontal connection from side to side, aims to manifest individual qualities, a sense of connection with the culture or community around, and a sense of the realisation of the mystical experience of 'one-ness.' Finally, the last map reflects the dynamic relationship between yin and yang at the centre and the tree of life which is found in many cultures worldwide,.Cooper, J. C. (1978). An Illustrated Encyclopaedia of Traditional Symbols. London, Thames and Hudson Ltd. In the tree sits the phoenix, which, as symbol for the power of transformation,Cirlot, J. E. (1971). A Dictionary of Symbols. London, Routledge. seems to reflect the essence of Movement Medicine. Research A PhD research describes that Movement Medicine dancers experience fundamental shifts in their personal growth and wellbeing in areas of the body, emotions, mind and spirituality. Participants describe insights regarding personal beliefs and patterns, their relationship to ancestral and family history, and to cultural patterns and mechanisms. Furthermore, participants sometimes experience new awareness regarding the nature of life, oneness, and various other ‘life lessons’. Although the variety of different traditions that inform the practice has been criticized, the mixture of different techniques are united in a coherent structure, which offers people from many different backgrounds useful entry points. A second PhD research project is still being carried out at Exeter University, which looks at the transformational aspects of Movement Medicine through the lens of leadership studies.

Its last duty assignment was at Kadena Air Base, Okinawa, where it was inactivated in 1956. History for additional related history see 471st Special Operations Wing In 1951, the USAF created the 581st Air Resupply and Communications Wing (ARCW), whose operational component was the 581st Air Resupply and Communications Group at Mountain Home Air Force Base, Idaho. The group consisted of four squadrons. The 581st Air Resupply and Communications Squadron (later Air Resupply Squadron) (ARS), the 581st Airborne Materials Assembly Squadron, the 581st Holding and Briefing Squadron, and the 581st Reproduction Squadron. The mission of the 581st ARS was the infiltration, resupply, and exfiltration of guerrilla-type personnel, and the aerial delivery of psychological warfare (PSYWAR) materiel (leaflets and other similar materials). Of the four squadrons assigned to the group, the 581st Air Resupply Squadron (ARS) was the lone squadron devoted to flying operations. In the summer of 1952 the wing and group relocated to Clark Air Base in the Philippines, where it was assigned to Thirteenth Air Force. Korean War Shortly before deployment to Clark, the group was reduced to paper status and its squadrons were attached directly to wing headquarters. This arrangement continued until the wing was inactivated in September 1953 and the 581st Holding and Briefing Squadron and the 581st Reproduction Squadron were inactivated. The group was redesignated the 581st Air Resupply Group and gained a maintenance squadron. For all practical purposes, the wing headquarters became the group headquarters. For a more detailed description of the group's operations during this period, see 581st Air Resupply and Communications Wing. First Indochina War At the direction of the 315th Air Division commander, the 581st C-119s provided limited airlift support to Far East Command's Korean operations throughout 1952. Beginning in 1953, however, the C-119s were employed in Southeast Asia in support of French operations in Indochina. Supplies, including ammunition, vehicles, and barbed wire, were delivered to Haiphong Airfield in ever increasing quantities. When US presence in Indochina could not be publicly escalated, plans were developed to utilize 581st personnel in a discrete support role. Refurbished C-119s, under French markings, were flown into Indochina by 581st crews, and French C-119s were flown out for depot repair at Clark AB. Instructors from the 581st were also tasked to train CIA-employed Civil Air Transport civilian aircrews in the C-119. American support for the French only prolonged the inevitable fall of the former colonial power. In May 1954, the French were defeated at Dien Bien Phu, thus ending 100 years of French colonial rule in Indochina. Inactivation In September 1953, after the Korean Armistice was signed that ended active conflict on the Korean peninsula the wing was inactivated and the group was reassigned directly to Thirteenth Air Force. The group was approximately one-half the size of the former wing and consisted of two squadrons—one flying squadron and one support squadron—as compared to six squadrons before the reorganization In October 1954, the 581st relocated from Clark AB, Philippines, to Kadena AB, Okinawa,Fletcher, p. 65 where it continued reduced operations out of that location for the next two years. In September 1956 the group was inactivated, thus closing a chapter in special operations history in the Pacific.

They built their first church of wood and metal at this site in 1873, aided by materials sent by Queen Victoria's government, including a bell cast in England in 1870. Located at the intersection of Marina, Mayor, and Abolicion streets, it was the first Anglican church built on the island.Explore Puerto Rico, by Harry S. Pariser. San Francisco: Manatee Press, p. 244, Retrieved November 30, 2009 Holy Trinity was still the only Protestant church in Puerto Rico at the time of the United States invasion in 1898. Because the old church had deteriorated, it was taken down; and a new church building was constructed on the same site in 1926. It has a synthesis of English neo-Gothic and Spanish-colonial styles. The 1870 bell was installed in the new church. The architect or designer is unknown. The church was listed on the U.S. National Register of Historic Places on 29 September 1986. Physical appearance The Holy Trinity Church (1926) is a free-standing structure located on the east side of \\"calle Marina\\" at the intersection of \\"calle Mayor\\" and \\"calle Abolición\\", a public area formed by the merging of \\"calle Marina\\" and \\"calle Mayor\\". The building follows the typical cruciform plan, created by a double- height nave with a crossing situated just west of the semi-circular apse. The nave incorporates an interior balcony addition above the main entrance. Concrete pilaster masses along the side walls support a concrete plate which, in turn, supports the wooden king trusses of the exposed roof construction. The side walls are divided into five bays of equal width by the pilaster masses. Bays 1 through 4 are punctured by attenuated, circular-arch, glazed windows of Gothic proportions, and the transept is located at bay 5. All interior walls are free of ornamentation.Mariano G.

September 29, 1986. The exterior is characterized by the combined use of neo-Gothic and Spanish-Colonial elements. The body of the church is buttressed between the window opening along the north and south facades. The transept rises only one story in height and its gables are oriented along a north–south axis. The exterior walls are void of any ornamentation as well, and the composition is capped by a ceramic tile roof typical of mission-style churches. The primary facade is particularly exemplary of the combination of North-American and Hispanic influences. This facade consists of a vertical rectangular frontispiece, surmounted by a bell gable with a bell in each of its two slender Roman arches, and a cross at the ridge, resulting in a composition similar to that of many of the colonial churches found on the island. Nonetheless, the frontispiece is flanked by buttresses and is punctured by a circular window at a second-floor height, reminiscent of the neo-Gothic church architecture common throughout the United States. A projecting, one-story, cubical reception section provides access to the nave through a semi-circular arch with iron grillework. This foyer area is sheltered by a hipped Spanish tile roof. In addition, its walls are whitewashed, in contrast to the unpainted appearance of the main body of the church, strengthening the impression of a mission-style addition to a Gothic structure.Mariano G.

Significance Spain permitted only Catholics to settle in its colonies in the New World: both Jews and Protestants were excluded. By the late 18th and early 19th century, they relaxed their rules to permit non-Roman Catholics to settle in various Spanish colonies, as part of trying to develop the colonies economically by attracting new immigrants.Mariano G.

Listing Reference Number 86002766. 29 September 1986. With the fall of the Spanish monarchy in 1868, the first Spanish republic was formed and the Tolerance of Worship Act was approved the following year. In 1869 the first organized Protestant services in Puerto Rico were held in the city of Ponce, organized by British and other Protestant residents. During that same year, a representative group from this congregation met to plan the establishment of an Anglican church, to be known as the Holy Trinity Church. Materials were received from Britain, as a present from Queen Victoria to her British subjects abroad. These materials included a bell cast in England, which bears the date 1870. In 1873 the church building began construction. After the Spanish Republic fell in 1874, the monarchy was reinstated. Religious intolerance returned, and colonial authorities ordered Holly Trinity church to close. At the intervention of Queen Victoria and the British Consulate, the Spanish crown allowed the Church to function under certain conditions: the front doors were to remain closed, the bell would not be allowed to ring, and no services could be held in Spanish. These measures remained in effect until 25 July 1898, when United States troops entered Ponce. On that day, parishioners rang the bell to greet the soldiers and celebrate the restoration of religious liberty. This bell is still known as the Freedom Bell by the residents of Ponce. By 1923 the old wood and metal church had deteriorated beyond repair. Funds were raised by public subscription to build a new, more permanent structure on the same site. The new church was completed in 1926. It combined the use of neo-Gothic and Spanish colonial elements which synthesize the building's tradition and function: the neo-Gothic represents the British religious heritage while the Spanish colonial symbolizes the community it would serve. The combination of these architectural styles, not common in Puerto Rico, makes this structure a unique example of its kind in the city of Ponce. The 1870 bell from England was installed in the new church. While other churches of Anglican faith have since combined characteristics of both styles, the Holy Trinity Church appears to represent the clearest convergence, resulting in hybrid forms and elements rather than Spanish applique on a Gothic church. In addition, the church is a good example of construction in a period of cultural and architectural transition in Puerto Rico, using concrete as a main building material, but keeping with the centuries-old tradition of exposed wooden rafters and Spanish-tile roofing.Mariano G.

It is native to western North America from British Columbia to Texas and northern Mexico, where it grows in many types of habitat. It is a glandular and sparsely hairy annual herb exceeding a meter in maximum height. The leaf blades may be long, the lower ones oval and the upper narrower in shape, and are borne on petioles. The inflorescence bears several flowers with pinkish or greenish white tubular throats long, their bases enclosed in pointed sepals. The flower face has five mostly white lobes. The fruit is a capsule about long.  Natural history   Introduction  Nicotiana attenuata has been utilized as an ecological model species since 1994, thanks in large part to its diverse interactions with a host of different plants, insects and microorganisms in its native habitat. Work at the Max Planck Institute for Chemical Ecology in Jena, Germany, has been instrumental in integrating a toolbox of genomic, ecological, and analytical tools alongside field work in the Great Basin Desert in order to study the interactions of N. attenuata in its native environment. = Genome = Nicotiana attenuata’s genome is ~2.26 Gb long, significantly more than the plant model species Arabidopsis thaliana. Preferential gene retention after a genome-wide duplication event in the genus Nicotiana partially accounts for this large size, which is roughly twice that of N. obtusifolia (~1.23 Gb), a closely related species.  Predators  Two species of hornworm, the tobacco hornworm and the tomato hornworm, use N. attenuata as a host plant. Each of these species respond negatively to high concentrations of nicotine within plant leaves, with the tobacco hornworm showing a more intense reaction. Nicotine concentrations together with insect predators help to determine where on the plant the hornworms prefer to feed. Defenses against herbivory N. attenuata has been observed to utilize direct and indirect defenses against herbivory.

Zavala, Aparna G. Patankar, Klaus Gase, Dequan Hui, Ian T. Baldwin Plant Physiology Mar 2004, 134 (3) 1181-1190; DOI: 10.1104/pp.103.035634 As an indirect defense, when the leaves are eaten by larvae, the plant emits green leaf volatiles (GLVs) that attract Geocoris bugs, which are predators of the worm. These GLVs are one of many herbivory- induced plant volatiles (HIPVs) that N. attenuata emits via jasmonic acid signaling. When GLVs come into contact with saliva from the hornworm there is a conformational change in the GLVs that attracts Geocoris bugs and increases predation on the hornworm eggs and larvae.Schuman et al. eLife 2012;1:e00007. DOI: 10.7554/eLife.00007 It has also been discovered that wild tobacco responds to volatile organic compounds (VOCs) emitted from other proximate species and undergoes priming of defenses.Danny Kessler. et al., Current Biology 20, 237–242, February 9, 2010 ª2010 Elsevier Ltd All rights reserved DOI 10.1016/j.cub.2009.11.071 Another indirect defense that has recently been studied is a change in flowering time and phenology, prompting a change in pollinator from the night-active hawkmoth to day-active hummingbirds. The flowers of N. attenuata normally open at dusk and are exposed during the night where Hawkmoth pollination occurs coupled with oviposition and thus future herbivory by hawkmoth larvae. Saliva from the hornworm causes a jasmonic acid transduction cascade leading to changes in flower phenology. Flowers reduce benzyl acetone (BA) concentrations, a hawkmoth-attracting volatile, and shift corolla opening to dawn, where day-active hummingbird pollination prevails and herbivory by the Hawkmoth larvae is lessened.Danny Kessler. et al., Current Biology 20, 237–242, February 9, 2010 ª2010 Elsevier Ltd All rights reserved DOI 10.1016/j.cub.2009.11.071 This shift from night opening to morning opening flowers was discovered using a native population of N. attenuata in Utah. Mesh coverings were placed over selected plants in different test groups with hornworms present or absent, and through a series of trials the ratio of morning opening to night opening flowers after just 8 days was significantly increased in the plants with hornworms present.Danny Kessler. et al., Current Biology 20, 237–242, February 9, 2010 ª2010 Elsevier Ltd All rights reserved DOI 10.1016/j.cub.2009.11.071 Collectively, these direct and indirect defenses show the impressive plasticity in behavior of N. attenuata in responding to herbivore attack.

He served as Palatine of Hungary from 1646 until his death. Biography Family and education Count Ivan III Drašković was a son of Ivan II Petar Drašković and his wife Eva Drašković née Istvánffy. Educated in Graz, Austria, where he finished philosophy studies, and in Bologna, Italy, where he graduated in law, Drašković spoke several foreign languages. He was also enrolled at the Classical gymnasium in Zagreb.Goldstein, Ivo - Szabo, Agneza, Povijest zagrebačke Klasične gimnazije (1607. - 2007.), Zagreb, 2007., str. 22, On 29 January 1629 he married Barbara Thurzó, a Hungarian countess, and they had five children, among which two sons, John IV and Nicholas II. Political and military career During his lifetime, the Drašković family achieved the highest point of its power, wealth and influence. Due to his successes in battles against the Ottomans, Ivan III Drašković was well known as defensor Croatiae (), having organised the Croatian defence forces, fortified the towns and castles, as well as built border military strongholds at the same time. On 4 September 1631 he was given (together with his brother Nicholas I and his cousin Caspar II) the title count by the Croato-Hungarian king Ferdinand II. In his career Drašković was, among other duties, a cavalry captain, master of king's chamberlains and king's secret advisor. On 10 July 1640 he was appointed ban (viceroy) of Croatia and superior commander of Karlovac military frontier. Thus he was the third member of the family sitting (so far) on the ban's throne, after his father Ivan II and his grandfather's brother Juraj. On 22 September 1640 the king Ferdinand III summoned a diet in Pressburg (; today Bratislava, Slovakia) where Drašković was appointed palatine of Hungary, the highest dignitary in that country after the king. Death and funeral Having performed the high function of palatine, Drašković suddenly died on 5 August 1648 in his new domain Óvár, Nógrád County (today Olováry in the Banská Bystrica Region, southern Slovakia), he had been given a short time before his death by the king Ferdinand III. He was buried during a solemn funeral rite in the St. Martin's Cathedral in Pressburg, which served as the coronation church of the Kingdom of Hungary between 1563 and 1830.

He previously played club football for Cannes, Créteil, for whom he made 17 appearances in Ligue 2, Cherbourg, Drancy and Villemomble. In international football, he represented Portugal at under-17 level. Personal life Sanches Leal was born in Setúbal, Portugal, but raised in the Grigny suburb of Paris. After his professional football career ended, he started a building firm in Paris. Football career Sanches Leal began his football career as a youngster with his local club, Viry- Châtillon, before joining the youth system of Cannes. While with Cannes, he won six caps for Portugal at under-17 level, which included all three of Portugal's group matches at the 2002 UEFA Under-17 Championships. He played once for the club's first team in the Championnat National (the third tier of French football) before returning to the Paris area in summer 2004 where he joined Créteil, primarily as a backup player. He made his Ligue 2 debut on July 29, 2005, as a second-half substitute in a 3–2 victory over Caen. Over the 2005–06 season, he appeared in seventeen Ligue 2 matches, and was rewarded with his first professional contract. Sanches Leal spent the following season on loan at Cherbourg, where he scored twice from 25 appearances in the Championnat National. A groin injury sustained shortly before the end of the season kept him out until December 2007, when he returned to action with Créteil's reserves. He made two assists on his return to the first team – who had been relegated in his absence – in January, and finished the season with 13 league appearances. He played only infrequently in 2008–09, and left the club at the end of the season. After a trial, he signed for Drancy, bottom of the Championnat de France amateur (CFA). The new blood helped Drancy retain their fourth-tier status, and Sanches Leal moved sideways, to Villemomble. In January 2011, he walked out of the stadium before the start of a match against Noisy to express his unhappiness at being omitted from the starting eleven. He did not play for the club again, only returning to football in June 2012 after more than a year out, when he signed for CFA club Viry-Châtillon, for whom he had played as a youngster.

The \\"ultimate holding company\\" is Rocket Lab USA Inc. registered in the United States. The subsidiary is Rocket Lab Limited, a New Zealand limited company. It developed a sub-orbital sounding rocket named Ātea and currently operates a lightweight orbital rocket known as Electron, which provides dedicated launches for smallsats and CubeSats. The company was founded in New Zealand in 2006 by engineer Peter Beck and established headquarters in California in the United States in 2013. The Electron test program began in May 2017, with commercial flights announced by the company to occur at a price listed in early 2018 as US$5.7 million. Launching from Mahia Peninsula, New Zealand, the rocket's test flights took place on 25 May 2017 and 21 January 2018, while its first commercial flight took place on 11 November 2018. On 16 December 2018, Rocket Lab launched their first mission for NASA's ELaNa program. The company plans to make its first launch from the Mid-Atlantic Regional Spaceport in Virginia in 2020.  History  Rocket Lab was founded in June 2006 by New Zealander Peter Beck, the company's CEO and CTO. Internet entrepreneur and fellow New Zealander Mark Rocket was the seed investor and co-director from 2007 to 2011. Rocket Lab claimed it became the first private company in the Southern Hemisphere to reach space after launching its Ātea-1 sounding rocket in November 2009. The payload was not recovered, but this was not deemed necessary. As an instrumentation dart, the payload was ballistic; its trajectory depended only on the boost phase of flight. The launch took place off the coast of New Zealand, from the private island (the Great Mercury Island) of Michael Fay, a New Zealand banker and investor. Another early investor into Rocket Labs was Stephen Tindall, a New Zealand entrepreneur and start-up investor. In December 2010, Rocket Lab was awarded a U.S. government contract from the Operationally Responsive Space Office (ORS) to study a low cost space launcher to place CubeSats into orbit. This agreement with NASA enables the company to use NASA resources such as personnel, facilities, and equipment for commercial launch efforts. Around 2013, the company moved its registration from New Zealand to the United States, and opened headquarters in Huntington Beach, California. The move coincided with the company receiving funding from American sources, and was in part due to increased U.S. government customership in the company. In 2020, Rocket Lab moved its headquarters to Long Beach, California. Funding was obtained from Khosla Ventures in 2013, and Callaghan Innovation (a Crown entity of New Zealand) and Bessemer Venture Partners in 2014. Lockheed Martin became a strategic investor in 2015, and Rocket Lab announced in March 2017 that it had raised an additional US$75 million in a Series D equity round led by Data Collective with participation by Promus Ventures and several previous investors. In May 2017, the investments of the Crown agency Callaghan Innovation into Rocket Lab over the years was reported to total NZ$15 million. In November 2018, the company reported raising a US$140 million Series E round led by Future Fund. The first NASA mission, launched in 2018, was valued by the space agency at US$6.9 million (with launch services, etc., included). Rocket Lab began to develop reusable first-stage technology in 2018, after previously stating publicly that they had no intention of attempting to recover and then reuse their small low-cost launch vehicles. They disclosed the effort to study the potential recovery of an Electron first stage in August 2019, eventually aiming to use a parachute and mid-air retrieval, stating that they hope to make a stage recovery attempt before mid-2020. In December 2019, they flight tested the reentry technology — a Rocket Lab proprietary aerothermal decelerator — on Electron flight number 10, and were able to decelerate the rocket and successfully bring it through the space-to- dense-atmosphere transition. They did not attempt to recover the rocket on this first test; but they plan to add guided parachutes to future test flights, eventually recovering the booster by snagging the parachute- descending rocket with a helicopter in the lower atmosphere. In March 2020, the company announced that it had acquired Sinclair Interplanetary, a Canadian manufacturer of components for small satellites. Rocket Lab said that it will use Sinclair technology on its Photon line of small satellite buses, and that it will help Sinclair increase production of small satellite components for sale to other firms.  Launch vehicles   Ātea  The first launch of the Ātea (Māori for \\"space\\") suborbital sounding rocket occurred in late 2009. The of long rocket weighing was designed to carry a payload to an altitude of . It was intended to carry scientific payloads or possibly personal items. Ātea-1, named Manu Karere or Bird Messenger by the local Māori iwi, was successfully launched from Great Mercury Island near the Coromandel Peninsula on 30 November 2009 at 14:23 local time (01:23 UTC) after fueling problems delayed the scheduled 07:10 local time liftoff. The rocket was tracked by GPS uplink to the Inmarsat-B satellite constellation; it splashed down approximately downrange. The payload had no telemetry downlink, but had instrumentation including the launch vehicle's uplink to Inmarsat. Payload was not required to be recovered, being only a dart, and the company advised that should it be encountered by vessels at sea, the payload should not be handled as it was \\"potentially hazardous\\" and contained delicate instruments. However, performance characteristics were completely determined by the boost stage, which did have downlink telemetry and was recovered. A second launch of Ātea-1 was not attempted.  Electron  Electron Electron is a two-stage launch vehicle which uses Rocket Lab's Rutherford liquid engines on both stages. The vehicle is capable of delivering payloads of 150 kg to a 500 km Sun- synchronous orbit, the target range for the growing small satellite market. The projected cost is less than US$5 million per launch. The Rutherford engine uses pumps that are uniquely powered by battery-powered electric motors rather than a gas generator, expander, or preburner. The engine is also fabricated largely by 3D printing, via electron beam melting, whereby layers of metal powder are melted in a high vacuum by an electron beam rather than a laser. By March 2016, the second-stage Rutherford engine had completed firing tests. The first test flight took place on 25 May 2017 at 04:20 UTC from Mahia Peninsula in New Zealand's North Island. After reaching an altitude of about , the rocket was performing nominally but telemetry was lost so the decision to destroy it was made by range safety. On 21 January 2018 at 01:43 UTC, their second rocket, on a flight named \\"Still Testing\\", launched, reached orbit and deployed three CubeSats for customers Planet Labs and Spire Global. The rocket also carried an additional satellite payload called Humanity Star, a of wide carbon fibre geodesic sphere made up of 65 panels that reflect the Sun's light. Humanity Star re-entered Earth's atmosphere and burned up in March 2018. On 11 November 2018, the first commercial launch (third launch in total) of Electron occurred from Mahia Peninsula carrying satellites for Spire Global, GeoOptics, a CubeSat built by high school students, and a prototype of a dragsail. On 4 July 2020, an issue during the second-stage burn of flight 13, named \\"Pics or It Didn't Happen\\", caused Electron to fail to get into orbit and its payloads were lost.  Photon satellite bus  Based on Rocket Lab's Electron kick stage, Photon is a satellite bus. It uses the Curie engine and communicates on S-band. Depending on the orbital inclination (37° to Sun- synchronous orbit), it is expected to have a maximum payload capacity of . In October 2019, Rocket Lab announced plans to use Photon to launch small payloads into lunar orbit as soon as fourth quarter 2020. A modified version of Photon would have bigger propellant tanks and the HyperCurie engine for interplanetary missions. The low Earth orbit version of Photon can take to Sun-synchronous orbit. The interplanetary version will have a payload capacity. HyperCurie is an evolution of the Curie engine, which comes in a monopropellent version and a bipropellant version, while the HyperCurie is a hypergolic version. HyperCurie is electrically pumped. The first satellite to use Photon bus (or a demo-version of it) was the First Light satellite (COSPAR 2020-060A), Rocket Lab's first in-house designed and built Photon demonstration satellite. It was launched aboard Electron rocket on 31 August 2020 on the 14th Electron mission \\"I Can't Believe It's Not Optical\\". On that mission, the Electron rocket lifted the First Light and the customer satellite, Capella 2, to orbit; then the First Light satellite, acting in the capacity of a kick stage (final rocket stage which inserts the payload satellite into desired orbit), inserted the customer satellite into its orbit and then went on to begin its own orbital mission as a standalone satellite. First Light thus had a dual role in the mission: first as the final rocket stage delivering the customer satellite and then as a standalone satellite. The purpose of First Light standalone mission is to demonstrate the new (as compared to \\"plain\\" kick stage) systems for operating in orbit as a long- duration standalone satellite. To demonstrate Photon bus' payload hosting, the First Light had a low-resolution video camera.  Viscous liquid monopropellant  In 2012, Rocket Lab demonstrated a rocket propelled by a Viscous Liquid Monopropellant (VLM) developed in work sponsored by sponsored by DARPA and the Office of Naval Research (NRL). The VLM was reported to be thixotropic, so that it behaves as a pseudo solid until a shear force is applied, at which point it flows like a liquid. The VLM was reported to have a density comparable to solid-rocket fuels, with a specific gravity of about 1.72, whereas the specific gravity of liquid rocket fuels was reported to rarely be above 1. The VLM reportedly required no special handling, was non- toxic, water soluble, had low sensitivity to shock, a high ignition point, and was barely flammable in atmosphere. Rocket Lab has been issued US patent US20120234196A1 on a Viscous Liquid Monopropellant which discloses additional details.  Facilities   Manufacturing  In October 2018, Rocket Lab revealed their new manufacturing facility in Auckland, New Zealand. It is intended for the production of propellant tanks and stage builds, and is in charge of the overall integration of launch vehicles for Launch Complex 1. The company's headquarters in Long Beach, California, produce the Rutherford engines and avionics.  Launch Complex 1  Launch Complex 1A under construction in 2016 After encountering difficulty in obtaining resource consent for the Kaitorete Spit launch site, Rocket Lab announced in November 2015 that its primary launch site would be on the Mahia Peninsula, east of Wairoa in the North Island, New Zealand. The site is licensed to launch rockets every 72 hours for 30 years. Rocket Lab Launch Complex 1 (LC-1A) was officially opened on 26 September 2016 (UTC; 27 September NZDT). , a second pad on Mahia Peninsula named Launch Complex 1B is under construction.  Launch Complex 2  In October 2018, after several months of search, the company announced their selection of the Mid-Atlantic Regional Spaceport (MARS) at NASA's Wallops Flight Facility as their second launch site. The site was chosen for a number of factors: the speed and ease in which the new pad could be built due to infrastructure readiness, the low number of launches from other companies, and the location's ability to supplement orbital inclinations provided by LC-1. It is expected to be capable of monthly launches serving US government and commercial missions. Launch Complex 2 (LC-2) is located within the fence line of MARS Launch Pad 0A. In December 2019, construction of the launch pad was completed and Rocket Lab inaugurated the LC-2. The first flight of Electron from LC-2 is expected in September 2020.

Facts Mr Walker negotiated with Mrs Boyle to purchase Stall House in Stall House Lane, Pulborough, West Sussex for £105,000. During negotiations Mr Walker sent enquiries to Mr Boyle asking, > ‘Is the vendor aware of any disputes regarding the boundaries, easements, > covenants or other matters relating to the property or its use?’ Mrs Boyle asked her husband who answered ‘no’. But really there had been a long running dispute with the neighbour, which Mr Boyle incorrectly thought had been settled. Condition 17(1) of the contract (which incorporated the ‘National Conditions of Sale’) said that, > ‘no error, misstatement or omission in any preliminary answer concerning the > property shall annul the sale’. Mr Walker brought an action for rescission based on misrepresentation. The question was whether Mr and Mrs Boyle could rely on the exclusion clause and whether it was reasonable under MA 1967 s 3. Judgment Dillon J held the condition fell foul of s 3 MA 1967. He held Mrs Boyle had not shown that the exclusion satisfied s 11 of the Unfair Contract Terms Act 1977 in this case. Neither party's solicitors directed their minds to condition 17, so it was not one which ‘ought reasonably to have been known to or in the contemplation of the parties’. He added that the National Conditions of Sale, though common, were not the product of negotiations between interested trade parties.

It is in the Deane deanery, the Bolton archdeanery and Diocese of Manchester. The church has been designated a Grade II listed building. The church has no patron saint and is not named after a saint or martyr. It has been variously called St Lawrence, St George, Holy Trinity, and St Catherine but its correct title is Rivington Church. History A deed of 1280 mentions three acres of \\"terra ecclesiastical\\" in Rivington. A Saxon font, found in the locality, is housed in the church's Millennium Room. The church has a circular graveyard which is typical of churches of early foundation. That, and the Saxon font, may be proof of pre-Conquest foundation. The arched windows on the south side are cut from solid stone, a Saxon feature. At the enclosure of the manorial waste in 1536, the priest was given .Richard Pilkington, whose son became the Bishop of Durham, appealed to Doctor Bird, the Bishop of Chester, to dedicate the chapel and chapelyard. They were consecrated in October 1541. At the consecration, the village residents stated on oath they had worshipped at the site for generations. Queen Elizabeth I, at the petition of Bishop Pilkington in 1566, granted letters patent for a free grammar school and licence to provide a curate or minister and allow baptisms, marriages and burials at the church for the inhabitants of Rivington, Anglezarke, Hemshaws and Foulds. Before this time the inhabitants had to travel to the surrounding parishes. The Reverend Samuel Newton was ejected from the church on \\"Bartholemew Sunday\\" in 1662 and most probably the staunchly Puritan congregation followed him and many became Presbyterian. This event led to the eventual founding of Rivington Unitarian Chapel. The church remains primarily as rebuilt in 1666 with alterations and restoration in the late-19th century. The restoration in 1861 cost £500 and involved building an \\"inward-jutting porch\\" to the west entrance, laying Minton tiles in centre aisle, raising the altar and adding railings, restoring the rood screen, panelling the walls to a height of five feet, replacing the box pews and installing a small organ. Rivington was created a parish out of the ancient ecclesiastical parish of Bolton le Moors. In 1856, and at their own cost, and by a privilege that few churches in the country possessed, the parishioners were able to elect their own minister. In 2014 an extension was added to the church's west end providing a reception and display area, toilet and kitchen. Structure Exterior left The church is built of irregularly coursed sandstone with large quoins, some measuring five feet, at the corners and a slate roof. It is a small, plain building with three three-light windows on each side. The nave is 55 feet 6 inches in length by 27 feet 6 inches in width and the chancel, 13 feet 6 inches by 15 feet 6 inches. The 19th-century gabled porch is between the centre and western windows on the south side and a modern vestry is on north side. The west gable wall has an elliptical-headed doorway and the octagonal bell turret has a square base and a conical roof with a weather vane. The roof is covered with green slates and finished with overhanging eaves. The three-bay nave has square-headed windows of three square lights on the north side, and round heads on the south side. There is a doorway between the second and third windows from the east on each side and a door at the west end. The chancel has three round-headed lights in each side and a five light east window. In the graveyard, the earliest gravestone is marked 1616. Some graves stones still present now laid flat at ground level were in the nineteenth century raised with stones sides and some other slabs originally laid at ground level were once surrounded by wrought iron railings, The iron was removed for the war effort in World War II. The churchyard contains three Commonwealth war grave burials of British Army personnel, one of World War I and two of World War II. Stones near the entrance include the 'Anderton Stone' which depicts shack bolts from the Anderton coat of arms and a crucified figure with 'INRI' believed to originate from Anderton Hall chapel. Above it is a carved with a Sator Square reading \\"SATOR AREPO TENET OPERA ROTAS\\" which possibly predates the Christian era. Interior The roof has four collar trusses with bracing to tie-beams and collars. The church is furnished with a late-medieval oak screen and a late 16th-century octagonal, oak pulpit on a stem with two linen-fold panels in each side. The screen and pulpit are considered to predate the church building. On the north wall is a genealogical painting copied, in 1835, from a 16th-century painting relating to the Pilkington family which was damaged by fire in 1834. There is an 18th-century brass chandelier with fluted body and two tiers of arms. The earliest memorial in the church is dated 1627. The church contains a pipe organ by Lewis & Co dating from 1884. It was overhauled in 1927 by Jardine and Co. Belltower The belltower, a Grade II Listed building in the churchyard close to the church, is a small, square, single-storey building with a basement and outside steps built in sandstone with a stone slate roof. It was built to hold a large bell bought from All Saints' Church, Wigan in 1542. The bell was sold by church commissioners around 1551. The detached bellhouse, the only such structure in Lancashire, was used as a charnel house but is now used as a tool house by the sexton and grave digger.

Continuous urbanisation and the growth of population result in increasing power consumption in buildings. Thus, while experts express the huge potential for energy conservations in this sector, the belief still predominates among stakeholders that energy-efficient buildings are more expensive than conventional buildings, which adversely affects the “greening” of the building sector. This belief is contested by studies finding evidence for the opposite being the case.  EDGE Program in India  The IFC, a member of the World Bank Group, and the Confederation of Real Estate Developers' Associations of India (CREDAI), apex body of private real estate developers, have partnered to promote green buildings in the country through IFC's EDGE certification. An MoU was signed in the presence of Minister for Environment and Forests Prakash Javadekar on November 25, 2014.  BEE certification  The Indian Bureau of Energy Efficiency (BEE) launched the Energy Conservation Building Code (ECBC). The code is set for energy efficiency standards for design and construction with any building of minimum conditioned area of 1,000 m2 and a connected demand of power of 500 KW or 600 KVA. The energy performance index of the code is set from 90 kW·h/sqm/year to 200 kW·h/sqm/year where any buildings that fall under the index can be termed as \\"ECBC Compliant Building\\" Moreover, the BEE launched a five-star rating scheme for office buildings operated only in the day time in three climatic zones, composite, hot&dry;, warm&humid; on 25 February 2009. IGBC rated green buildings are also able to meet or exceed the ECBC compliance. The CII Sohrabji Godrej Green Business Centre is a BEE 5 star-rated building. The Reserve Bank of India's buildings in Delhi, Bhubaneshwar in Orissa and in Kerala have been star rated. In Tamil Nadu 11 buildings were star rated by BEE, in the year 2010, including RBI buildings. Green houses In Tamil Nadu, the government is planning to build solar- powered green houses for rural poor. It has allotted Rs.1058 crore for construction of 60,000 houses. In Maharashtra, near Mumbai in the Thane District, Govardhan Eco Village, a community in India, has built buildings with compressed stabilized Earth blocks, Rammed Earth Technique, Cob Houses(ADOBE Bricks) with traditional thatched roofs. These buildings have received a five-star rating from GRIHA, an Indian Nationwide Green Standards for Buildings, a wing of the famous TERI. Traditional buildings Traditional buildings were energy efficient because architecture depended on the places. Buildings in the hot and dry regions, had corridors directing the wind to cool naturally. In wet regions, structures using natural light and breeze, were used. Some examples are * Hawa Mahal - Articulated windows provides cool breeze in a desert area * Golkonda - Ventilation is designed to let in fresh cool breeze, in spite of summer. The traditional building practices were utilized in constructing the Dhyanalinga. Mud mortar stabilized with lime, sand, alum and some herbal additives was used.

Facts Cremdean Properties Ltd contracted to buy some Bristol property from Nash. They wanted to develop it. They relied on representations by Nash’s agents that there was planning permission for of offices. The true figure was much lower. Cremdean sought rescission or damages for misrepresentation. Nash sought to rely on a footnote clause in the invitation to tender document that said although statements (like the planning permission) ‘are believe to be correct their accuracy is not guaranteed’ errors would not annul the sale and pre-contract statements did not form part of the offer. Also, any purchaser should satisfy himself. Cremdean Properties Ltd argued that the exclusion fell within MA 1967 s 3 and was unreasonable. Judgment Bridge LJ held that the footnote was an exclusion clause within s 3. He noted that Nash’s argument that the footnote was effective to nullify representations in the document altogether (not just exclusions) and resulted that no representation had ever been made. He said this argument altogether, and that such a result would be ‘remarkable’. He distinguished Overbrooke Estates Ltd v Glencombe Properties Ltd situation had no effect here, because here the agents that published the documents always had Nash’s authority. He added that it would be enough to go by ordinary interpretation principles, that the footnote was an exclusion. But even if an ingenious draftsman had said that ‘no representation is being made by our representations’ or something, s 3 could still not be circumvented. Scarman LJ concurred. He said that the logic of Nash's argument was appealing that, Buckley LJ concurred.

History Israel has had its own voluntary Green Building Standard, for buildings with reduced environmental impact, IS-5281 since 2005. The standard is based on a point rating system, awarding up to 5 stars based on the number of points achieved (55 – 100) in 8 categories. While the 2005 version covered only new residential and office buildings,a significantly revised and updated new version was approved in 2011, following pressure from professionals and market players. The new standard written with the help of BRE, the British office that wrote BREEAM, the UK Green Building tool, covers new buildings and buildings under significant renovation. This version was revised in August 2014. A number of Israeli municipalities are currently using the standard as a mandatory part of their building licensing process. Together with complementary standards 5282 [classification of buildings according to energy use] and 1738 for sustainable products provides a system for evaluating the environmental sustainability of buildings.Green Building Standards United States Green Building Council LEED rating system has been implemented on some building in Israel including the Intel Development Center in Haifa. Standard 5281 The Israeli Green Building Standard ('Buildings of Lesser Environmental Harm'), Standard 5281, was upgraded and expanded in 2011 in cooperation with the Ministry of Environmental Protection, the Standards Institute of Israel, the Ministry of Interior, Ministry of Building and Housing and the Israeli Green Building Council. While the old standard only applied to residential and office buildings, the revised version defined seven standards for seven types of buildings: residential, offices, healthcare institutions, public, commercial, education and tourism buildings. The 5281 standard encompasses issues pertinent to every green building: energy, land, water, building materials, health and welfare of building users, waste, transportation, building site management and innovation. Each issue is divided into sub- categories that include rating and assessment criteria, and the score is determined in accordance with the project's compliance with the requirements. A building is deemed a 'green building' if it meets the minimal requirements for each of the categories, as well as additional preconditions to minimize the building's \\"environmental footprint.\\" The standard has five levels, ranging from one star to five stars.

Conditions R(b) of the sale said, > ‘The vendors do not make or give and neither the Auctioneers nor any person > in the employment of the Auctioneers has any authority to make or give any > representation or warranty in relation to these premises.’ The auctioneers, Wilmotts, represented to Glencombe that the local council had no plans for the property and were not interested in compulsory purchase. After Glencombe made a successful bid, the council told Glencombe the property would be purchased in its slum clearance programme. So Glencombe refused to pay Overbrooke. Overbrooke sought specific performance. It was contended that any liability for misrepresentation had been validly excluded under s 3 of the Misrepresentation Act 1967. Judgment Brightman J held that Overbrooke Estates Ltd were not responsible and could get specific performance. Condition R(b) was effective - not to exclude liability, but to define their duty so that responsibility for the auctioneer's negligent statements was never assumed. The condition meant that no ostensible authority had been given to the auctioneers as agents to make representations on Overbrooke's behalf. Therefore s 3 MA 1967 did not apply.

Milne first became a commissioner on 14 August 1834 when William IV appointed him a \\"Commissioner of His Majesty's Woods, Forests, Land Revenues, and Buildings\\". The Commission was a three-man body which managed the public and commercial functions of Crown land in Britain. The Commission was composed of a First Commissioner, who headed the body, and two co-commissioners. Throughout his career with the commission, which ran from 1834 until his death in 1850, Milne served as a co- commissioner. On his first commission Milne worked with Sir John Hobhouse, the First Commissioner, and Sir Benjamin Charles Stephenson. Milne was reappointed to the commission, which had changed its remit to \\"Woods, Forests, Land Revenues, Works, and Public Buildings\\", by the King on 23 December 1834. Stephenson remained on the commission but Lord Granville Somerset was appointed as the new First Commissioner. Milne and Stephenson reappointed once more on 28 April 1835, with Viscount Duncannon serving as First Commissioner. This composition was retained until 14 June 1839 when Charles Alexander Gore was appointed by Queen Victoria to replace Stephenson. The Commission's title was changed to the \\"Commission of Woods, Forests, Land Revenues, Works, and Buildings\\", the last time it would change during Milne's life. Milne and Gore were reappointed on 16 September 1841 with the Earl of Lincoln replacing Duncannon at the head. Milne and Gore were once again reappointed on 2 March 1846 with Viscount Canning as First Commissioner. Milne was appointed to the Commission for the last time on 7 July 1846, with Gore returning as a co- commissioner and Viscount Morpeth as First Commissioner. Milne died in 1850, having served on the Commission for 16 consecutive years of its 41-year existence. Milne served with six different First Commissioners and just two separate co-commissioners. His replacement on the commission was Thomas Francis Kennedy who was appointed on 28 August 1850. Milne was appointed to be a member of the Improvement of the Metropolis Commission on 30 November 1842. This commission, whose members did not receive a salary, sat from 1842 to 1851 and was tasked with \\"enquiring into and considering the most effectual means of improving the metropolis, and of providing increased facilities of communication within the same\\". The commission was composed of some of the leading architects and politicians of the time. Milne sat on the commission alongside the Earl of Lincoln and Gore as well as Lord Lyttelton, Lord Colborne, James Charles Herries, Sir Robert Harry Inglis, Sir Charles Lemon, Henry Thomas Hope, Henry Gally Knight, Robert Smirke and Charles Barry. On 27 April 1848 Milne was appointed a Companion of the Order of the Bath (Civil Division) for his work as a commissioner of woods and forests. He was a friend of Charles Babbage and William Huskisson and some of his correspondence with those men, and others, is held by The National Archives. He was also close to the architect and civil engineer Thomas Telford and, along with John Dickinson (of the House of Commons), served as executor of his last will and testament after his death in 1834.

Each Green Star SA rating tool reflects a different market sector (e.g. office, retail, multi-unit residential, etc.). The first tool developed was Green Star SA - Office which was published in pilot form for public comment in July 2008, with final version 1 release at the Green Building Council of South Africa Convention & Exhibition ’08 on 2–4 November 2008. South Africa is in the process of incorporating an energy standard (SANS 204)SANS 204 which aims to provide energy-saving practices as a basic standard in the South African context. Green Building Media (launched in 2007) has also played an instrumental role in green building in South Africa, through their informational portal,Green Building Journal of South Africa as well as their monthly Green Building e-Journal of South Africa, which is sent to professionals within the built environment. They currently hold two annual events which focusing on sustainability; the Green Building Conference and a Retrofitting Seminar.

The GBCSA in Cape Town (15 September 2014) the launch of the “EDGE” rating system, to be utilised for homes in South Africa. The launch comes in the wake of the GBCSA’s hugely successful My Green Home education and awareness campaign for the greening of homes, in addition to a detailed market research study jointly led by IFC and the GBCSA on the potential need and impact of EDGE in the South African market. EDGE, which stands for “Excellence in Design for Greater Efficiencies,” seeks to help facilitate a transformation of the property sector in rapidly urbanising countries by influencing design considerations. To achieve the EDGE standard, minimum savings of 20% energy, water, and embodied energy in materials must be met. The goal of IFC’s EDGE programme is to help build capacity for developers, banks, and governments to mainstream resource-efficient buildings in rapidly growing economies around the world. With EDGE, builders can assess the most cost-effective ways of bringing green features into their designs, financiers can offer better terms to developers and green mortgages for homeowners, and governments can do their part through incentives and improved regulations. EDGE has been adapted for the local South African context, especially in light of the SANS 10400 Part XA energy efficiency building code. This code was promulgated for all new buildings in 2011. Since 2009, IFC has invested more than $600 million in green buildings, including homes, commercial buildings, hotels, and hospitals, both directly and through financial partners. IFC has also provided regulatory advice to the governments of Colombia, Panama, the Philippines, Vietnam, Indonesia, and Bangladesh. As part of its climate strategy, IFC has developed EDGE to encourage resource-efficient building design by proving the business case for building green.

Astronomers have announced the discovery of a super-Earth extrasolar planet in close orbit. Planetary system Gliese 433 b is an extrasolar planet which orbits the star Gliese 433. This planet is a super-Earth with at least six times the mass of Earth and takes approximately seven days to orbit the star at a semimajor axis of approximately 0.056 AU. The planet was announced in a press release in October 2009, but no discovery paper at the time was made available. A study described in a 2014 paper by Tuomi et al. confirmed both Gliese 433 b and another candidate planet, previously detected in 2012, Gliese 433 c. Gliese 433 d, whose discovery was published in January 2020, is very similar in mass to Gliese 433 b but orbits slightly further out, actually within the optimistic habitable zone of the star, but it is still too close to the star, and therefore too warm, to be inside the narrower boundaries of the conservative habitable zone. Gliese 433 c orbits the furthest out from the star. To date it is the nearest, widest orbiting, and coldest Neptune-like planet yet detected. It is also notable in having an unusually eccentric orbit for a large planet so far from its parent single star and other planets. Diagram of the (probable) Gliese 433 Star system.

The Chelmsford by-election, 1945 was a parliamentary by-election for the British House of Commons constituency of Chelmsford, Essex on 26 April 1945. Vacancy The by-election was caused by the death of the sitting Conservative MP, John Macnamara. He was killed on active service in Italy on 22 December 1944. He had been MP here since holding the seat in 1935. Election history Chelmsford had been won by the Conservative Party at every election since 1924, when they re-gained the seat from the Liberals, and was now a safe seat. The result at the last General election was as follows; Candidates The local Conservatives selected 35-year-old Flight Lieutenant Brian Cook. Before the war he was a painter, designer and publisher.http://www.ukwhoswho.com The Labour party had selected Dr Mary Day to contest a General Election expected to take place in 1939-40.Report of the Annual Conference of the Labour Party 1937-40 There had been no Liberal selected. At the outbreak of war, the Conservative, Liberal and Labour parties had agreed an electoral truce which meant that when a by-election occurred, the party that was defending the seat would not be opposed by an official candidate from the other two parties. When the Labour and Liberal parties joined the Coalition government, it was agreed that any by-election candidate defending a government seat would receive a letter of endorsement jointly signed by all the party leaders. The Common Wealth Party put forward 29-year-old Ernest Millington as candidate. He served with the RAF Bomber Command during the Second World War, where he rose to the rank of wing commander and was awarded the Distinguished Flying Cross in 1945. Campaign Polling day was set for 26 April 1945. When nominations closed, it was to reveal a two horse race, between the Conservative Cook and Millington for the Common Wealth party. Cook received a joint letter of endorsement from all the leaders of the parties in the coalition. Millington advocated a socialist programme based on nationalisation of the land and public ownership. Result Millington gained the seat; Aftermath When the 29-year-old Millington took his seat, he was the youngest MP in the House, which had been elected in 1935. The victory signalled the shift in public opinion that led the Labour party to pull out of the wartime coalition government and win a landslide victory in the 5 July 1945 general election. Millington held his seat in the 1945 general election and joined the Labour Party in April 1946.

( 15511593) was an English military and naval commander. Life Born about 1551, he was the son of Alexander Carleill, citizen and vintner of London, by his wife Anne, daughter of Sir George Barne. After Alexander's death, Christopher's mother Anne married Francis Walsingham in January 1562; Walsingham was spymaster to Queen Elizabeth I of England. Anne died in 1564 and left her son Christopher in Walsingham's care. Christopher was educated in the University of Cambridge. In 1572 he went to Flushing (Vlissingen), and was present at the Siege of Middelburg. Lodewijk van Boisot, the Dutch admiral, had a high opinion of his advice. Afterwards he went with one ship and a vessel of smaller size to La Rochelle to serve under Henri, Prince of Condé, who was about to send supplies to the town of Brouage, then besieged by Charles, Duke of Mayenne. Condé had intended to attack the royal fleet in person, but on the arrival of Carleill the command was given to him. Having discharged this duty he went to serve Steenwijk in Overijssel, then besieged by the Spanish. He was then placed at the head of the English troops at the fortress of Zwarte Sluis. When leading troops there to the army he was surprised by a body of the enemy consisting of two thousand foot and six hundred horse. He vigorously resisted them, inflicting heavy losses. As inconvenience arose from the great number of foreigners in the camp of the Prince of Orange the sole command was given to Carleill. After the siege of Steenwick was raised he went to Antwerp, and he was on the point of returning to England, when he was sent for by the prince and the confederate states again to assume the sole command of the camp until Sir John Norreys should arrive to share the command with him. Altogether he served the Prince of Orange for five years, without receiving pay. He conveyed the English merchants to Russia in 1582, when Frederick II of Denmark was at war with the Russians. The Danish fleet met them, but, observing his squadron of eleven ships, did not venture on an engagement. The Russian envoy got on board at the port of St. Nicholas, and was conveyed to England. By the interest of his stepfather (the old DNB says \\"father-in-law\\", a term that meant \\"stepfather\\" in the 16th century; Carleill was unmarried), Sir Francis Walsingham,Conyers Read, Mr Secretary Walsingham and the Policy of Queen Elizabeth (Cambridge: Harvard University Press, 1925) Carleill received £1,000 subscribed at Bristol for an attempt to discover the coast of America lying to the south-west of Cape Breton, and proposed to the Russian merchants to raise more in London, and to settle one hundred men in their intended plantation. The project appears to have been unsuccessful, but Carleill wrote a summary on its advantages. In 1584, Sir John Perrot, Lord Lieutenant of Ireland, appointed Carleill commander of the garrison of Coleraine and the district of Route, County Antrim. Being recalled to England in 1585 in consequence of disputes with Perrot, he was, through the influence of Walsingham, made lieutenant-general of the land forces, consisting of above 2,300 troops, in the expedition to Santo Domingo, Sir Francis Drake being at the head of the fleet, consisting of twenty-one sail. Carleill was captain of the Tiger and in charge of the troops that were conveyed which led to the plundering of Santiago in the Cape Verde, after which they then seized Santo Domingo, captured Cartagena de Indias, and St. Augustine. On 26 July 1588, he was appointed constable of Carrickfergus, County Antrim. In 1588, he was governor of Ulster. On 10 June 1590, he wrote to Lord Burghley, requesting a commission from the queen to seize for lawful prize any goods which might be found in England belonging to Spanish subjects, and complaining of his monetary losses in her service. Carleill died in London on 11 November 1593. John Stow said he utterly abhorred piracy; Sir John Perrot entertained a different opinion of Carleill's views of piracy.

Allison was a Georgia court case. In Georgia vs Allison, Janet Allison was convicted of sexual offenses for allowing her (then pregnant) daughter, aged 15, to have sexual intercourse in her home. The events took place in the year 2000. The young couple later married and had a child of their own, but Allison's name has been entered into the sex offender registry, with various adverse consequences for her life and that of her family. As a family law matter, the case was not widely reported in the popular press at the time, but Allison's plight has subsequently attracted attention from publications and television programmes critical of the State of Georgia's stance on sex offenders. Allison was not given a prison term, but three of her children were taken into foster care. She was obliged to leave her four bedroom home, because it is unlawful for a sex offender to live within a quarter of a mile of a church, and now lives in a mobile home \\"way off down a dirt road\\". She is allowed no contact with the daughter involved, nor with her grandchild. Further changes to Georgia's laws on sex offenders in 2006 strengthened the restrictions on where Allison could live. When Georgia's strict sex offender residency law passed the state legislature in 2006, the bill's House sponsor, Jerry Keen, said Georgians should celebrate because sex offenders would be forced to leave Georgia. Keen stated: \\"We want people running away from Georgia. Given the toughest laws here, we think a lot of people could move to another state ... If it becomes too onerous and too inconvenient, they just may want to live somewhere else. And I don't care where, as long as it's not in Georgia.\\"http://www.hastingsconlawquarterly.org/archives/V35/I2/Canlas- LaFlam.pdf Allison was one of the plaintiffs who challenged the new provision of the sex offender law. According to the Newstandard News, Allison \\"has already been informed by county sheriffs that she must move, and, according to the complaint, she has unsuccessfully searched in five counties for an affordable home that would allow her to comply with the new law.\\" The Southern Center for Human Rights called this outcome unconstitutional and has challenged it in the Federal courts. On July 20, 2010, the Georgia legislature amended the law, relaxing some of the restrictions on some sex offenders. According to Associated Press writer Greg Bluestein the relaxed restrictions included an appeal procedure, whereby those on the sex offender list could explain why they thought they should be removed. The restrictions on whether, and how close to schools and churches those on the list could live was also relaxed. Bluestein wrote \\"After losing court battle after court battle, state legislators were forced to make a change or a federal judge was going to throw out the entire law.\\" As someone convicted before 2003, Allison no longer faces a residency restriction.

That was the only example built as it was decided to revise the design with more powerful engines as the VIT-2. Development The Polikarpov design bureau (OKB) was ordered, in 1936, to begin development of a fast twin-engined aircraft that could be used for ground attack duties and as a heavy fighter. It delivered the ground attack version the following year for evaluation, although it could be modified as necessary for other roles. The VIT-1 was reasonably successful, but it was decided to give it more powerful engines and modify its structure. The improved aircraft was designated as the VIT-2.Gordon, p. 281 The VIT-1 was a low-winged, twin-engined aircraft with a mixed structure. The monocoque fuselage was made in halves of 'shpon', molded birch plywood. The wing and tail structures were built from a mix of steel tubes and duralumin with a duralumin skin. The VIT-1 had the first metal- skinned control surfaces in the USSR.Gunston, p. 305 The main legs of the conventional landing gear retracted aft into the engine nacelles, but the tailwheel was fixed.

Waters fought for the world title three times during his career, losing to Gianfranco Rosi, Terry Norris and Simon Brown. He was the son of Cec Waters and the younger brother of boxers Dean and Guy. Biography Troy and his brothers were initially trained by their father who was a brutal taskmaster. Troy said their life was like a \\"military camp where it was boxing for breakfast, lunch and dinner\\". Waters fought as a junior middleweight. Waters turned pro in 1984 and won his first five professional fights before losing to future WBA super middleweight champion In-Chul Baek for the OPBF light middleweight title. Waters lost a twelve-round decision. In 1987, he won the Commonwealth Title knocking out Lloyd Hibbert in the fourth round. He successfully defended the title four times. In his 16th fight and on a nine fight win streak he fought Gianfranco Rosi in Italy for the IBF Super Welterweigh (light middleweight) title on 27 October 1989. The bout went the distance but was fairly one-sided, with the defending champion retaining his belt in a 12 Round unanimous decision. Waters second attempt at a world title came six wins later in 1993 in San Diego when he lost to WBC light middleweight champ Terry Norris in three rounds. The second round of his fight with Norris was named The Ring's \\"round of the year\\" for 1993. Waters knocked down Norris in the second round, but lost by TKO in the third round. Just two fights later Waters lost his third and final title fight to Simon Brown in Las Vegas by majority decision. In his next fight he defeated Mexican and former WBC welterweight champion Jorge Vaca. After a car accident and almost retiring, his last major fight for promoter Don King, was a loss in the first round in a WBC eliminator match to future champion Félix Trinidad, in August 1997 at Madison Square Garden.

He was one of the Iroquois chiefs that were seized treacherously and sent to the galleys in France in 1687, after being invited to a conference at Fort Frontenac by Denonville, the Canadian governor. He was allowed to return with Frontenac to Canada in 1689, became attached to the new governor, accompanied him to Montreal, and advised him to release the other Indian captives that were then in Canada. His advice was followed; the Indians were sent back to their tribes, and were exhorted by Oureouhare to persuade the latter to send an embassy to Montreal. This was done on 9 March 1690, and the envoy said that the French prisoners that had been scattered in the other cantons were now all at Onondaga, and would be disposed of as Oureouhare should direct. The efforts of the latter to reconcile the Iroquois to French rule were unsuccessful, and Frontenac began to have doubts of his fidelity. His conduct in 1691, when the Iroquois invaded the French colony, dispelled all doubts, and his bravery at Repentigny contributed greatly to the defeat of the savages. He commanded the Christian Hurons in an engagement at La Prairie in the same year, and afterward pursued a body of Iroquois and recaptured several French prisoners. He then went to Quebec and received the thanks of Frontenac, as well as numerous presents. Several tribes offered to make him their chief, but he replied that he would never leave Ononthio (Frontenac), for whom he seems to have felt a sincere affection. He retired among the Christian Iroquois of the mountain in 1692, but made frequent excursions among the Cayugas and other tribes in the interest of the French, persuading the Cayugas to release their French prisoners, and keeping them firm in their allegiance. He visited Quebec in 1697, and fell sick after his arrival. He was a sincere Christian, and when the missionary who attended him spoke of the crucifixion, it is said that he cried out: “Why was I not there? I would have prevented them from so treating my God.” He was buried with pomp. Frontenac regretted him all the more that he relied on him principally for bringing about a treaty with the Iroquois.

Since its establishment over four decades ago, NAOWA has been in the vanguard of the provision of community health centres to complement the health care delivery services and carefully designed welfare programmes that are targeted at women, youths, children and the less privileged in Nigeria. The organisation has been described as \\"the most powerful women's organisation in the country\\".David J. Parkin, Lionel Caplan, Humphrey J. Fisher (1996) Berghahn Books. The politics of cultural performance History NAOWA began in the 1950s as ‘Army Wives Association’ (AWA). The association ventured into charitable activities during the tenure of Welby Everald between 1962 and 1965. Members were encouraged to donate to orphanages, thus forming the basis for the modern aims and objectives of the association. The name of the association was changed to Nigerian Army Officers’ Wives Association (NAOWA) on attainment of Nigeria’s Republican status in 1963. Victoria Aguyi-Ironsi was the first indigenous president of the association. Since then, NAOWA has had 23 distinguished successive national presidents with varying lengths of tenure. Since the association is non-governmental and non-profit making with no subvention from either federal or state government, most of its programmes are derived through the benevolence of individuals and corporate bodies. Initiatives The association has over the years established day-care centres, model nursery and primary schools, skill acquisition centres, shopping malls and children’s parks in many locations across the country. This move brought about the construction of a befitting modern vocational training centre in Abuja. The rationale behind this initiative is to further complement the Nigerian Army and federal government welfare programmes to emancipate and broaden the knowledge of soldiers’ wives, youths, widows and the less privileged from ignorance, poverty and diseases in order to redress the prevalent imbalance in the area of education in their barracks and immediate environment. In addition to this, the aim is to contribute to nation building by producing self- employed people who can establish on their own and employ others, by contributing to the societal welfare through the training of the underprivileged and to assist military personnel in acquiring basic skills so that they can be efficient, self-sustaining and self-reliant on retirement. The centre will be moderated by the following bodies; Nigerian Army School of Finance and Administration (NASFA), Industrial Training Fund (ITF) in conformity with National Board for Technical Education (NBTE). The following are the proposed diploma and certificate courses: *Secretarial Studies *Catering and hotel management *Fashion and textile designing *Computer studies *Cosmetology *Hairdressing and barbering *Extramural and adult education NAOWA undertakes a number of social and philanthropic activities in order to contribute to the well being of the barracks community and its surrounding environment particularly, widows, orphans, unemployed barracks youths and the less privileged. Statistics taken from all the divisions of Nigerian Army Barracks, showed that the number of female children enrolled in barrack schools dropped to 50% between primary and secondary school, with only a handful proceeding to any form of higher education. This problem transcends all segments of Nigerian society including the barracks community. It is in realization of this that the United Nations Children’s Funds (UNICEF), federal government and some state governments established respective programmes for female education. However, as broad and laudable as these programmes their impact is yet to reach girls in Nigerian Army Barracks. Based on this information, the association deemed it necessary to embark on the programme dedicated towards enhancing the education of girls and reverse these negative trends that inhibit equal opportunities and gender insensitive laws practiced among children. In line with this, NAOWA has already flagged off the Girl Child Education Programme (GCEP) campaign in many states of the federation. In pursuit of its aim and objectives, NAOWA support governments and other agencies in the provision of self-help projects, vocational training centres, periodic donation and contribution of cash, drugs, treated mosquito nets and other relief materials to ‘Homes’ for the motherless, elderly and destitute. The activities of the association is not only limited to barracks alone, it is also extended to the surrounding communities. Hence the need to embark on the construction of a modern maternity centre equipped with state-of-the-art facility in Kaduna (Northern Nigeria) for the provision of maternal and child health services. The centre, when established, will improve access to basic health care and medical services, especially focused on improving women's health and drastically reducing child and maternal mortality. NAOWA is also making effort to partner with local community leaders to extend quality health services beyond the formal healthcare system. The association is concerned with preventive rather than curative aspects of health within a larger population-level, rather than individual-level health issues. The main focus of the association is intervention to prevent rather than treat a disease through surveillance of cases and the promotion of healthy behaviours. In many cases treating a disease may be vital to preventing it in others, such as during an outbreak of an infectious disease. In addition, NAOWA also carries out a periodic enlightenment campaign on hand washing, vaccination programme, and environmental sanitation to improve lives through the prevention and treatment of diseases. Magazine NAOWA publishes a magazine as the mouthpiece of the association, showcasing its activities and write-up on topical issues, opinion and comments, socio-cultural, entertainment and political events across the globe. The magazine is published annually and it enjoys a wide readership and circulation to all military formations across the country. The maiden and second edition of the magazine were published in 2007 and 2008 respectively.

GAFFA, 1996(5), 12. The band did not attempt to create songs that resemble the old, and assumed it at least would not be a complete fiasco given their continued success. Rotator is heavier and less carefree than its predecessor, with a hint of bitterness especially in regard to the state of the music industry. As lead singer Tim Christensen explains: \\"There are several songs about the [music] industry. One song for example describes how you should first do well before they take you in from the cold. Nobody makes it from the start; they must smell the money. We are the cause that other bands have had the problem that the record label tells them, 'Now that Dizzy is running so well, we won't be taking in other bands.' It embarrasses us a bit, but cannot do anything about it.\\" Drummer Søren Friis elaborates: \\"One can actually take ourselves as an example, as we first had to win DM i Rock before it happened.\\" Bassist Martin Nielsen clarifies, \\"The songs aren't about how bad we have it, but mostly about how bad the business can be sometimes.\\" The song \\"11:07 PM\\" is about the death of John Lennon, an event which has had a profound impact on Christensen, even though he was only six years old at the time.Elle (23 January 2010). \\"Interview: Tim Christensen\\". The title of the song refers to a presumed time of death. On this album, Nic Wastell, an Englishman, corrected some of the lyrics. \\"The idea came from both myself and from our label, because I am fairly lazy when it comes to writing lyrics. Since we had recorded all the music, I could see that some of the lyrics weren't entirely complete,\\" says Christensen.  Studio struggles and the band's demise  EMI-Medley head of A&R; and producer Nick Foss had made an agreement with lead singer and guitarist Tim Christensen that if their debut album Dizzy Mizz Lizzy sold gold (equal to 40,000 copies at that time), the next would be recorded at the legendary Abbey Road Studios in London,Poulsen, Jan (October 2004). \\"Live at Abbey Road Studios 2004\\" (complimentary booklet).Poulsen, Jan (February 2010). \\"Dizzy Mizz Lizzy - Rotator\\" (foreword in reissued Rotator CD booklet, part of the Dizzcography box set). which it did in 2 months' time, and would continue to sell 5× platinum.Facebook (2010). \\"Tim Christensen: Info\\". Retrieved on 12 November 2010. As a result, Rotator was recorded in the same studios The Beatles had recorded in, which was Christensen's boyhood dream, and which he repeated in 2004 when playing and recording a solo live show there. While recording at the Abbey Road Studios, it turned out the other band members did not share Christensen's enthusiasm,Soundvenue (2004). \\"Tim Christensen: I Beatles' fodspor\\" (Tim Christensen: In The Beatles' footsteps). nor could they appreciate the unique symbolism recording in these legendary studios as much as Christensen.Winther, Anne (2003). \\"Tim Christensen: Giv ham en million, og han vil investere i et nyt køkken\\" (Tim Christensen: Give him a million and he will invest it in a new kitchen). GAFFA, 2003(9), 58. Svidt, Ole Rosenstand (6 November 2015). \\"Grundig Dizzy Mizz Lizzy-biografi byder på flere afsløringer\\" (Thorough Dizzy Mizz Lizzy biography offers more insights). GAFFA. This meant Christensen had no one to share his palette of emotions with, causing him to turn to Pernille Rosendahl, his girlfriend since 1995, in and out of the studio. This further added to the crisis and caused Christensen to become increasingly estranged from the band. Nielsen and Friis even went as far as labeling the couple as \\"John and Yoko\\", referring to the supposed detrimental influence of Yoko Ono on John Lennon that contributed to the break-up of the Beatles. This period furthermore showed the first signs of the band members heading in different musical directions, about which Christensen explained in 2000: \\"I needed change while the others wanted to continue in the same style, and that was actually the most important reason we split up.\\"Elsnab, Peter (2000). \\"Guldfuglen er landet på begge fødder\\" (Golden bird has landed on both feet). GAFFA, 2000(10), 19–20. This can especially be heard in the song \\"Rise and Fall\\"; although songs were always a collaborative effort by the band, Christensen requested Nielsen and Friis to allow him to be in full control over this song, and as a result it is distinctly different from all other songs on the album. In pursuit of the album's release, they played on festivals in Denmark, Norway and Germany, and went to Japan in September 1996 for shows in Tokyo (2×), Sapporo, Osaka, Nagoya and Fukuoka. In Denmark, they played dozens of shows which fatigued both the band and the fans, while the problems that arose during the recording of Rotator also pursued the band on tour. After five years of non stop recording and touring and having lost touch with reality, the band decided to take a sabbatical in 1997. They worked on some demos in January 1998,Tuxen, Henrik (1998). \\"Stopper på toppen: Dizzy opløst\\" (Stop at the top: Dizzy dissolved). GAFFA, 1998(4), 8. but did not find the band dynamics revitalized, and the trio decided to split up on 10 March 1998 while discussing their future on a bench in the Rosenborg Castle Gardens. The split occurred amidst a wave of prominent Danish bands disbanding. Critics would later explain their decision as the band having the courage to stop in time despite enormous success,Tuxen, Henrik (18 August 2006). \\"Dizzy Mizz Lizzy på Vega i går\\" (Dizzy Mizz Lizzy at Vega yesterday). GAFFA. although it was largely due to fatigue that the trio could not bring themselves to continuing to play. Their tastes in music had also become less compatible, with Christensen wanting a more vintage Beatles-like sound and Nielsen and Friis preferring to make heavy metal music.  Reception  The album reached gold status the very day it went on sale on 24 May 1996, and they appeared to have lived up to the notorious expectations of creating a worthy sequel to their debut album.Reuss, Anders (1996). \\"Fra Europe til Seattle\\". GAFFA, 1996(5), 12. It sold 100,000 copies in Denmark, \\"which is exceptionally high for a guitar rock album in Denmark\\" and was good for double platinum, but it could not match the commercial success of its eponymous predecessor Dizzy Mizz Lizzy by a long shot. In Japan, another 100,000 copies were sold.Poulsen, Jan (February 2010). \\"Dizzcography\\" (complimentary booklet). Reviews were generally positive; GAFFA described it as \\"a solid bastion of a publication,\\"Madsen, Finn P. (1996). \\"Dizzy Mizz Lizzy: Rotator\\".

It allows users to create tests that mimic the actions and assessments of a human tester.Software Test Engineering with IBM Rational Functional Tester. The Definitive Resource It is primarily used by Software Quality Assurance teams to perform automated regression testing. Overview Rational Functional Tester is a software test automation tool used by quality assurance teams to perform automated regression testing. Testers create scripts by using a test recorder which captures a user's actions against their application under test. The recording mechanism creates a test script from the actions. The test script is produced as either a Java or Visual Basic.net application, and with the release of version 8.1, is represented as series of screen shots that form a visual storyboard. Testers can edit the script using standard commands and syntax of these languages, or by acting against the screen shots in the storyboard. Test scripts can then be executed by Rational Functional Tester to validate application functionality. Typically, test scripts are run in a batch mode where several scripts are grouped together and run unattended. During the recording phase, the user may introduce verification points, which capture an expected system state, such as a specific value in a field, or a given property of an object, such as enabled or disabled. During playback, any discrepancies between the baseline captured during recording and the actual result achieved during playback are noted in the Rational Functional Tester log. The tester can then review the log to determine if an actual software bug was discovered. Key Technologies Storyboard Testing Introduced in version 8.1 of Rational Functional Tester, this technology enables testers to edit test scripts by acting against screen shots of the application. Object The Rational Functional Tester Object Map is the underlying technology used by Rational Functional Tester to find and act against the objects within an application. The Object Map is automatically created by the test recorder when tests are created and contains a list of properties used to identify objects during playback. ScriptAssure During playback, Rational Functional Tester uses the Object Map to find and act against the application interface. However, during development it is often the case that objects change between the time the script was recorded and when a script was executed. ScriptAssure technology enables Rational Functional Tester to ignore discrepancies between object definitions captured during recording and playback to ensure that test script execution runs uninterrupted. ScriptAssure sensitivity, which determines how big an object map discrepancy is acceptable, is set by the user. Data Driven Testing It is common for a single functional regression test to be executed multiple times with different data. To facilitate this, the test recorder can automatically parametrize data entry values, and store the data in a spreadsheet like data pool. This enables tester to add additional test data cases to the test data pool without having to modify any test code. This strategy increases test coverage and the value of a given functional test.  Dynamic Scripting Using Find API  Rational Functional Test script, Eclipse Integration uses Java as its scripting language. The Script is a .java file and has full access to the standard Java APIs or any other API exposed through other class libraries. Apart from this RFT itself provides a rich API to help user further modify the script generated through the recorder. RationalTestScript class that is the base class for any TestScript provides a find API that can be used to find the control based on the given properties.

Liebmann to describe how \\"a single courageous State may, if its citizens choose, serve as a laboratory; and try novel social and economic experiments without risk to the rest of the country.\\"New State Ice Co. v. Liebmann, Brandeis was an Associate Justice of the Supreme Court of the United States from 1916 to 1939. This concept explains how within the federal framework, there exists a system of state autonomy where state and local governments act as social \\"laboratories,\\" where laws and policies are created and tested at the state level of the democratic system, in a manner similar (in theory, at least) to the scientific method. An example today would be the legalization of marijuana in Colorado despite the fact that it is illegal federally. The Tenth Amendment of the United States Constitution provides that \\"all powers not delegated to the United States by the Constitution, nor prohibited by it to the States, are reserved to the States respectively, or to the people.\\" This is a basis for the \\"laboratories of democracy\\" concept, because the Tenth Amendment assigns most day-to-day governance responsibilities, including general \\"police power\\", to the state and local governments. Because there are 50 semi-autonomous states, different policies can be enacted and tested at the state level without directly affecting the entire country. As a result, a diverse patchwork of state-level government practices is created. If any one or more of those policies are successful, they can be expanded to the national level by acts of Congress. For example, Massachusetts established a health care reform law in 2006 that became the model for the subsequent Affordable Care Act at the national level in 2010, or the various concealed carry state reciprocity agreements that motivated the subsequent federal Concealed Carry Reciprocity Act of 2017.

Aerial photography of Kandahar at night in 2011. Energy in Afghanistan is provided by hydropower followed by fossil fuel and solar power. According to Da Afghanistan Breshna Sherkat (DABS), approximately 35% of Afghanistan's population has access to electricity. This covers the major cities in the country. Many rural areas do not have access to 24-hour electricity but this should change after the major CASA-1000 project is completed. Afghanistan currently generates over 600 megawatts (MW) of electricity from its several hydroelectric plants as well as using fossil fuel and solar panels. Over 670 MW more is imported from neighboring Iran, Uzbekistan, Tajikistan and Turkmenistan. Due to the large influx of expats from neighboring Pakistan and Iran, Afghanistan may require as much as 7,000 MW of electricity in the coming years. The Afghan National Development Strategy has identified alternative energy, such as wind and solar energy, as a high value power source to develop. As a result, a number of solar and wind farms have been established, with more currently under development. Hydroelectricity Inside the power station at the Kajaki Dam in the southern Helmand Province of Afghanistan Afghanistan has the potential to produce over 23,000 MW of hydroelectricity. A number of hydroelectric plants were built between the 1950s and the mid-1970s, which included the Naghlu in the Sarobi District of Kabul Province and the Kajaki in Helmand Province. Other hydroelectric facilities that were operational as of 2002 included plants at Puli Khumri, Darunta in Nangarhar Province, and one in Mazar-i- Sharif. Also in operation was the Breshna-Kot Dam in Nangarhar, which had a generating capacity of 11.5 MW. Construction of two more power stations, with a combined capacity of 600 kW, was planned in the city of Charikar in Parwan Province. Southern Afghanistan has been lacking adequate electricity due to problems with the Kajaki power plant in Helmand, which has been damaged and neglected for many years.\\"Re-Engineering Afghanistan: The coalition has spent hundreds of millions trying to give Afghanistan electricity. Unfortunately, it made many of the mistakes it made in Iraq,\\" by Glenn Zorpette, IEEE Spectrum, October 2011 A third generating turbine was recently added. This added 16.5 MW to its generating capacity and eventually provide the southern Afghan cities of Kandahar and Lashkar Gah with around 10-hour electricity per day. The Afghan-India Friendship Dam in Herat Province, which produces 42 MW of electricity, was inaugurated in 2016. A number of other water mega dams are being built in different parts of the country. Electricity import Afghanistan currently imports over 670 MW of electricity from neighboring Iran, Turkmenistan, Uzbekistan and Tajikistan. This costs Afghanistan $280 million annually. =Uzbekistan= Discussions on electricity supplies began back in 2006, the Construction of a high voltage transmission line from Uzbekistan to Afghanistan was completed by October 2008. It runs from Kabul through five Afghan provinces towards the country's border with Uzbekistan, and connects to the Uzbek electricity transmission system. It was expected that the project would cost $198 million [USD] the transmission lines were jointly funded by India and the Asian Development Bank. As a result, by early April 2009, all the capital city of Kabul had 24-hour electricity, the increase in power has already made a difference to many ordinary Afghans. By 2011, the 220 kV line form Uzbekistan had a capacity of nearly 300 MW. =Tajikistan and Kyrgyzstan= After completion, the billion dollar CASA-1000 project will provide 300 MW of electricity to Afghanistan, with the remaining 1000 MW going towards Pakistan. Natural gas and oil Work on the Turkmenistan-Afghanistan-Pakistan-India (TAPI) pipeline is ongoing. Natural gas reserves were once estimated at 140 billion cubic metres. Production started in 1967 with 342 million cubic metres but had risen to 2.6 billion cubic metres by 1995. In 1991, a new gas field was discovered in Chekhcha, Jowzjan Province. Natural gas was also produced at Sheberghan and Sar-e Pol. Natural gas was Afghanistan's only economically significant export in 1995, going mainly to Uzbekistan via pipelines from northern Afghanistan, which at the time was controlled by Junbish-i-Milli. As of 2002, other operational gas fields were located at Djarquduk, Khowaja Gogerdak, and Yatimtaq, all in Jowzjan Province. In 2002, natural gas production was . Afghanistan is reported to have oil reserves totaling about 1.9 billion barrels. Small amount of crude oil is produced at the Angot field in the northern Sar-e Pol Province. Another small oilfield at Zomrad Sai near Sheberghan was reportedly undergoing repairs in mid-2001. Petroleum products such as diesel, gasoline, and jet fuel are imported from neighboring countries, mainly from Iran and Central Asia nations. A small storage and distribution facility exists in the city of Jalalabad in Nangarhar Province.  Coal  Afghanistan is reported to have coal reserves totalling 100-400 million tons. These mines are located from Badakhshan and extend up to Herat Province. The country has more than 11 coal reserves which include the following:  Bamyan province  # Ashposhta and Sarasia coal reserves - 150 million tons # Sarjungel and Sar Asia coal reserves  Baghlan province  # Karkar coal reserves # Dodkash coal reserves  Samangan province  # Dara e sof-Shabashak reserves (Very High Quality) 74 million tons # Darae e sof- Gola badri - Keshine Mabayen Village and Balkhab District coal reserves  Badakhshan province  # Kotal khaki - Barf District coal reserves  Parwan province  # Farakort Gorband Province and Gawoparan Surkhparsa District coal reserves  Herat province  # Karukh coal reserves - 15 million tons  Daikundi province  # Lagharjoe - Kacharan District coal reserves  Uruzgan province  # Kandalan Village Mudakhil District coal reserves Paktia province # Khost and Paktia coal reserves - 75 million ton  Solar and wind farms  Afghanistan's first wind farm in the Panjshir Province. Afghanistan has the potential to produce over 222,000 MW of electricity by using solar panels. In 1991, a new 72-collector solar installation was completed in Kabul at a cost of $364 million. The installation heated 40,000 liters of water to an average temperature of 60 °C around the clock. The use of solar power is becoming widespread in Afghanistan. Solar parks have been established in a number of Afghan cities.Private firms to build 30-MW solar park in AfghanistanECOsys Implements the Hybrid Solar and Wind Power Plant in Herat Province- AfghanistanSolar powered hatchery in Balkh to increase poultry production Solar-powered street lights are seen in all Afghan cities and towns. Many villagers in rural parts of the country are also buying solar panels and using them. The country also has the potential to produce over 66,000 MW of electricity by installing and using wind turbines. The first wind farm was successfully completed in Panjshir Province in 2008, which has the potential to produce 100 kW of power. The United States Agency for International Development (USAID) has teamed up with the National Renewable Energy Laboratory to develop a wind map of Herat province. They have identified approximately 158,000 MW of potential wind power. Installing wind turbine farms in Herat could provide electricity to most of western Afghanistan. Smaller projects are wind pumps that already have been attached to water wells in several Herat villages, along with reservoirs for storing up to 15 cubic meters of water. The 300 KW wind farm in Herat was inaugurated in September 2017.  Biomass and biogas Besides wind and sun, potential alternative energy sources for Afghanistan include biomass, biogas, and geothermal energy. Biogas plants are fueled by animal dung, and produce a clean, odourless and smokeless fuel. The digestion process also creates a high-quality fertilizer which can benefit the family farm. Family-sized biogas plants require 50 kilograms of manure per day to support the average family. Four to six cows are required to produce this amount of manure, or eight to nine camels, or 50 sheep/goats. Theoretically, Afghanistan has the potential to produce about 1,400 million cubic meters of biogas annually. A quarter of this amount could meet half of Afghanistan's energy needs, according to a January 2011 report from the United States National Renewable Energy Laboratory.  Lithium and uranium  Afghanistan has large amounts of lithium and uranium reserves.Afghanistan sitting on a gold mine  Geothermal  An area of vast untapped potential lies in the heat energy locked inside the earth in the form of magma or dry, hot rocks. Geothermal energy for electricity generation has been used worldwide for nearly 100 years. The technology currently exists to provide low-cost electricity from Afghanistan's geothermal resources, which are located in the main axis areas of the Hindu Kush. These run along the Herat fault system, all the way from Herat to the Wakhan Corridor in the northern parts of Afghanistan. With efficient use of the natural resources already abundantly available in Afghanistan, alternative energy sources could be directed into industrial use, supply the energy needs of the nation and build economic self-sufficiency.

Security and cultural issues Afghanistan is a totally Islamic country. In Islam, a tourist or a traveler is called a musafir. Such person is generally treated as a diplomat and must be protected under Afghan culture at all costs, even if he or she is disobedient to the law of Afghanistan or to the Afghan culture. Every mosque is a place of ultimate protection against common criminals. Although Afghans in general are very friendly to tourists, their country is not very safe because foreign tourists have been kidnapped and sometimes killed. Finding an honest and reliable tour guide is the key to safety in Afghanistan.

As of 12 November 2010, the segment of this road from its intersection in the west with PR-2R (a.k.a., Carretera Pámpanos) to its intersection in the east with PR-12, officially became the Bulevar Luis A.

In the 1960s, the segment from Carretera Pámpanos in the east to just before PR-500 in the west was built as part of the urban development of that area in the 1960s. However, Avenida Las Américas came to an abrupt dead end before reaching PR-500. The third segment built was built to connect Avenida Las Américas from Avenida Hostos (PR-123) in the west to Avenida Julio E. Monagas in the east. This last segment was built in the 1980s. During the same period the road was expanded to the west to connect Avenida Las Américas with PR-500.

Avenida Las Américas runs easterly from PR-500, intersecting with PR-2R (Ramal PR-2R) near Francisco Montaner Stadium and Juan Pachín Vicéns Auditorium, and passing Secretaría de Recreación y Deportes. Continuing east it passes Pontifical Catholic University of Puerto Rico, and Museo de Arte de Ponce, before intersecting with Avenida Hostos PR-123. Other points of interest on Avenida Las Américas are the former Puerto Rico Police headquarters for the Ponce Region, the Ponce Governmental Center, and Hospital Metropolitano Dr. Pila. Continuing east, the road crosses Rio Portugués and immediately afterwards the road intersects Avenida Santiago de los Caballeros (PR 12), and takes a northerly turn to intersect with PR-1 at Bulevar Miguel Pou, about one mile further. Additional businesses along its way are Café Rico and Centro del Sur Mall, both at Avenida Las Américas's intersection with PR-133, also known as Calle Comercio.

Although Avenida Las Américas ends at its intersection with PR-1, physically the roadway continues as a non-divided four-lane road called Avenida Emilio Fagot to intersect with PR-14 and, further north, to come to an end at a junction with PR-10 for access to points in northeast and north Puerto Rico, respectively. The less transited western section of Avenida Las Américas experiences an hourly traffic flow upwards of 2400 vehicles.

He is most notable for winning the British and Empire bantamweight boxing championship in 1913. Boxing career Beynon was a collier from the South Wales coalfield who supplemented his wages by taking up boxing while still a teenager. One of Beynon's first professional bouts was a loss against George Dando of Merthyr Tydfil, before Beynon entered one of the more successful phases of his career in the first three years as a professional fighter. On 2 June 1913, Beynon faced Digger Stanley at The Ring, in Blackfriars, London. Stanley was the reigning British and Empire bantamweight champion and was favourite to win the bout and retain his belt. Beynon won the fight by points over twenty rounds becoming the second officially recognised holder of the title. Beynon's term as the bantam weight title holder was short lived, as after a win over Frenchman Robert Dastillon, he failed in his first defence of the belt, against Digger Stanley; losing in the same way as he won, by points over 20 rounds. Beynon's later career never reflected the success of his early career, losing the majority of his challenges. Beynon faced several notable fighters, included a win over past British flyweight champion Joe Symonds in 1921 and two knockout losses to Charles Ledoux, European bantamweight champion. When Beynon first faced Ledoux, it was for the European bantamweight championship title, and he lost the fight after being forced to retire in the eighth round after his eyebrow was split.

It is a slow viral infection of the brain characterized by chronic encephalitis, usually manifesting between 8–19 years of age. It is believed to be due to a persistence or reactivation of rubella virus infection. Cause It develops 6 months to 4 years after the primary rubella infection, which in most cases is a congenital rubella. In children with congenital rubella infection the deficits remain stable; neurological deterioration after the first few years of life is not believed to occur. Progression of the disease can be divided into two stages: * 1st stage: Behavioural Changes  insidious onset  subtle changes in behaviour and declining school work * 2nd stage: Neurological Changes  seizures – sometimes myoclonic  cerebellar ataxia  spastic weakness  retinopathy, optic atrophy  frank dementia leading to coma  spasticity and brainstem involvement with death in 2–5 years Diagnosis The diagnosis is considered when a child with congenital rubella develops progressive spasticity, ataxia, mental deterioration, and seizures. Testing involves at least CSF examination and serology. Elevated CSF total protein and globulin and elevated rubella antibody titers in CSF and serum occur. CT may show ventricular enlargement due to cerebellar atrophy and white matter disease. Brain biopsy may be necessary to exclude other causes of encephalitis or encephalopathy. Rubella virus cannot usually be recovered by viral culture or immunohistologic testing. Treatment Although no specific treatment exists, the disease can be managed with anticonvulsants, physiotherapy, etc. Incidence PRP is very rare and similar to SSPE but without intracellular inclusion bodies.

There are three occurrences known on the Nevada sideNevada Natural Heritage Program Rare Plant Fact Sheet and fewer than five occurrences in California.California Native Plant Society Rare Plant Profile The plant grows only in alkaline salt pans made up of moist and drying, salt-encrusted clay soils surrounded by other halophytes, such as Atriplex confertifolia and Cleomella brevipes.Flora of North America Description Nitrophila mohavensis, the Amargosa niterwort, is a petite rhizomatous perennial herb growing no more than about 10 centimeters tall. It produces erect branches, often in pairs, covered in fleshy oval-shaped green leaves 3 or 4 millimeters long. The inflorescence is a solitary flower or cluster of a few flowers emerging from between the leaves. The flower lacks petals but has pink petallike sepals which fade white with age. Conservation Nitrophila mohavensis is a federally listed endangered species. Its range is restricted and highly localized, making it vulnerable to severe losses or extinction in a single event.USFWS. Determination of threatened status with critical habitat for six plants and one insect in Ash Meadows, Nevada and California; and endangered status with critical habitat for one plant in Ash Meadows, Nevada and California.

Both businesses closed in 2015 after staff walked out over unpaid wages and Melngailis was arrested for fraud in 2016 and convicted in 2017. Background Melngailis was born and raised in Newton, Massachusetts, and attended Newton North High School. Her early interest in food came from her mother, a professional chef. Her father was a physicist at MIT.MeIngalis, Sarma. One Lucky Duck http://oneluckyduck.com/pages/about-sarma Accessed June 6, 2016 Melngailis graduated from the University of Pennsylvania in 1994 with a B.A. in Economics, and a B.S. in Economics from the Wharton School. She moved to New York City, working at Bear Stearns until 1996, then moving to Bain Capital in Boston on private equity investment. She returned to New York City in 1998 and joined a high-yield investment fund at CIBC, but soon left to enroll at New York's French Culinary Institute from which she graduated in 1999. Business Together with her then-boyfriend chef, author, and speaker Matthew Kenney, she opened Commissary in 2001, but it closed in March 2003, after which she consulted for Jeffrey Chodorow's China Grill Management. With Chodorow and Kenney, Melngailis opened Pure Food and Wine in June 2004 as New York City's first upscale raw food restaurant. Located in Manhattan's Gramercy Park neighborhood, the restaurant was listed twice in New York magazine's “Top 100 Restaurants” and five years in a row in Forbes magazine's list of “All Star New York Eateries.\\" One Lucky Duck Juice and TakeawayOne Lucky Duck Takeaway review is the name of the takeaway retail store attached to the restaurant, Pure Food and Wine. OneLuckyDuck.com, launched in 2005, is an online store for snacks prepared and packaged from her restaurant as well as ingredients, skincare, supplements, books, apparel, and home products, all related to raw and organic living. A second One Lucky Duck location was open in New York City's Chelsea Market from December 2009 through January 2015. In 2014, One Lucky Duck Juice and Takeaway's first location outside of New York City opened in San Antonio, Texas. Controversy In January 2015, Pure Food and Wine and One Lucky Duck staff walked out en masse due to Melngailis' failure to pay employees a month's worth of owed wages. This was the second time in a year a month's worth of wages had been withheld from employees, the first happening in July 2014. On February 8, 2015, Melngailis addressed the walkout and closure in a blog post. She apologized for the incident, but her blog post was subsequently removed. In an interview with Well+Good, Melngalis said that the delayed wages were due to slim margins caused by debts and expensive ingredients, and that she had also previously missed her own rent payments. During the ordeal, Melingailis provided employees a different explanation, blaming the situation on changing banks. In April 2015, Pure Food and Wine, One Lucky Duck, and OneLuckyDuck.com reopened. A majority of staff did not return to the restaurant after its reopening. Again in July 2015, the staff of Pure Food and Wine as well as One Lucky Duck walked out due to unpaid wages.

Together with Jules Chéret he is considered to be one of the pioneers of the modern coloured and illustrated poster of the Belle Époque in France, in particular in Paris. Early life Alfred Choubrac was born in Montmartre (Paris). Nécrologie, Le Radical, 28 July 1902 Martin, Nos peintres et sculpteurs, graveurs, dessinateurs, p. 105 With his elder brother Léon Choubrac, Alfred was trained as a classical artist with the painters Charles Doërr and Isidore Pils at the École des Beaux Arts. Beraldi, Les graveurs du 19e siècle, p.17 The Choubrac brothers came very soon to the poster, practicing since 1875 the modern treatment of colors and typography, associated with images thanks to chromolithography. In the early 1870s, the Choubrac brothers and Jules Chéret (known as \\"the father of the modern poster\\") reduced the cost of colour lithography introducing technical advances. Additionally, in 1881 restrictions on bill-posting (affichage) were lifted and eased state control of the media in France.Verhagen, The poster in Fin-de-Siècle Paris, p. 107Carter, Karen L. (2010). Unfit for public display: female sexuality and the censorship of fin‐de‐siècle publicity posters, Early Popular Visual Culture, 8:2, 107-124 In 1884, the Paris city council started to rent out surfaces belonging to the municipality, paving the way for a rapid increase in the production and distribution of advertising posters. Posters with clear colours and dashing images appeared all over town during the vibrant spirit of the Belle Époque. Ateliers Choubrac They worked mainly with the printing press F. Appel. Later, Léon and Alfred created the Ateliers Choubrac, one time hosted by the printing press G. Massias, 17 passage Daudin, one of the first graphic design agencies in Paris, operating their prints on a lithographic press. Around 1898, the name of the Atelier was associated with the name of Imprimerie Bourgerie & Cie, 83 rue du Faubourg, St Denis in Paris. Ateliers Choubrac, Bibliothèque Nationale de France (BNF) Although his brother Leon died young (1847-1885), Alfred went on to produce an impressive number of posters for Parisian entertainers, theatres, businesses and various commercial products.Maindron, Les affiches Illustrées (1886-1895), p. 51-55Hiatt, Picture Posters, Chapter 5 Alfred Choubrac specialized in posters for shows in the Parisian night-life scene of the Belle Époque, for places such as the Théâtre des Variétés, Théâtre du Châtelet, Folies Bergère, Opéra comique, Moulin rouge, Casino de Paris, the Eldorado, the Circus Fernando. Alfred Choubrac (1853-1902), Bibliothèque Nationale de France (BNF) With Chéret and Toulouse- Lautrec, amongst others, Choubrac was among the most important poster artist of his time.Verhagen, The poster in Fin-de-Siècle Paris, p. 109 His most famous poster is that of Au Joyeux Moulin Rouge, based on the popular Parisian nightclub Moulin Rouge. Censored The 1880s and 1890s were an intermediary period in the development of the poster in which its primary political function shifted to a primarily promotional one as advertising in the emerging consumer economy, often, if not primarily, through the commoditisation of female sexuality. In April 1891, under orders from the Minister of the Interior, the prefect of Paris, Henri-Auguste Lozé, seized and destroyed hundreds of posters considered to a violation of public decency. Many artists and their printers were charged. Several of Choubrac's posters were prohibited and he was brought to court along with the printers. Les affiches obscènes, La Presse, 9 May 1891 One of the censored posters advertised the performance of the dancer Ilka de Mynn at the Folies Bergère, who was depicted in a maillot (body stocking), which according to the court that charged Choubrac was a cause for concern because the model appeared to be nude. Another poster was an advertisement for the French magazine Fin de Siècle, which showed a scarcely dressed female dancer. Rapazzini, Le Moulin Rouge en folies, p. 86 In an interview with La Presse, Choubrac said he was astonished by the upheaval, claiming that \\"nudity is exposed everywhere and in much more provocative ways; and I frankly confess that I do not see where the evil was, I sought to make a work of art and nothing more.\\" L'affiche artistique, La Presse, 12 April 1891 Image:Luka_de_Mynn_-_Choubrac.jpgIlka de Mynn at the Folies-Bergère, 1891 Image:Choubrac_1891_poster_censored.jpgCensored poster for the French magazine Fin de Siècle, 1891 Image:Choubrac_1891_poster_uncensored.jpgUncensored poster for the French magazine Fin de Siècle, 1891 Image:Journal_Fin_de_Siècle_poster_Choubrac.png Second version for Fin de Siècle (after censored poster), 1891 Other work and exhibitions In later life he became also known for his designs of stage costumes for the theatre.Gutsche-Miller, Sarah (2010). Pantomime-Ballet on the Music-Hall Stage: The Popularisation of Classical Ballet in Fin-de-Siècle Paris, Thesis, Schulich School of Music McGill University Choubrac illustrated several works by Emile Zola. He carried out a number of bookstore posters to promote popular works. He also produced commercial posters for brands such as the Muscovite Digestive, Humber Cycles, Beeston Tire, Naigeon Gold Water, Unbreakable Baleinine Corsets, Mokatine, Decauville Cycles, Burgeatine Liqueur, and the Hippodrome of Saint-Ponchon, among others. As an illustrator, he sometimes collaborated with his brother Léon in Gil Blas or the satirical weekly Le Courrier français, among others. The first poster exhibition in France occurred in 1884 in the Passage Vivienne in Paris and included American as well as French posters with specific representation of the work of Cheret and the two Choubrac brothers.The Color Revolution: Color Lithography in France, 1890-1900 The New York Grolier Club in November 1890 organised an exhibition of prints of the \\"masters in the newest art\\", that of bill posting, including Choubrac, Chéret, Willette and Eugène Grasset.Posters at the Grolier Club, The New York Times, November 7, 1890 Legacy and death The poster collector Ernest Maindron, who wrote the first essay about the illustrated poster in the Gazette des Beaux-Arts in 1884, and later published the first book on the subject (Les Affiches Illustrees) in 1886, mentioned the Choubrac brothers and Chéret among the pioneers of the illustrated poster.Collins, Bradford R. (1985). The Poster as Art; Jules Chéret and the Struggle for the Equality of the Arts in Late Nineteenth-Century France, Design Issues, Vol. 2, No. 1 (Spring, 1985), pp. 41-50 Maindron praised Choubrac's bold line, sense of composition and highly decorative skills.

Formed in 1989 with just 3 buses and serving close to 3000 passengers per month, the agency currently serves more than 73,000 passengers per monthICTC Transportation Commission Agenda of June 25, 2014 with over 20 buses in operation. Twelve routes, plus the El Centro Circulators (which are labeled as the Green Line running clockwise and the Blue Line running counterclockwise) form the structure of the system. Service is provided every day of the week except on recognized federal holidays. Two limited stop routes (the 31/32 Direct) also travel Monday-Saturday, and two express buses (the 21 & 22 IVC Express) run to Imperial Valley College when classes are in session. Recent Developments Imperial Valley Transit has been on a concentrated effort in recent years to improve transit services to the region it serves. These efforts include replacing an aging fleet from the 1990s with new vehicles. New transit stations have also been developed with more on the way planned for the cities of Calexico and Imperial. Schedules for the most in-demand routes have been expanded as well, alleviating overcrowding. Partnership with Yuma County Intergovernmental Public Transportation Authority (YCIPTA) and the Quechan Indian Tribe The following routes are treated as an extension of the Imperial Valley Transit system, funded and administered by the Imperial County Transportation Commission (ICTC), YCIPTA, and Quechan. The routes are operated with Yuma County Area Transit (YCAT) buses. =YCAT Turquoise Route 10= Since its formation in 1989, IV Transit had provided public transportation to Winterhaven with an extension of Route 3 east of Holtville. This lifeline route, composed of one round trip, provided passengers in the remote community access to government and medical services in the county seat of El Centro every Wednesday. When ICTC, administrator and funder of IV Transit, was approached by Quechan and YCIPTA to provide better transit services in the area, all agencies agreed to discontinue the extension of Route 3 east of Holtville and replace it with the newly jointly funded YCAT Turquoise Route 10. The more extensive route, effective January 7, 2013, provided two round trips a day and traveled every Monday, Wednesday, and Saturday. The route better serves Eastern Imperial County residents and connects Yuma, Winterhaven, and El Centro via Interstate 8. Further connections are available to YCAT routes at the Downtown Yuma Transit Center and IVT routes at the El Centro Regional Transit Terminal. Though showing modest gains in ridership since then, service on Saturdays has been cut effective July 1, 2016 due to its inability to meet farebox recovery ratio performance standards. Additionally, discounts and fare passes were terminated for YCAT's Turquoise Route 10 in order to increase its chances of meeting the aforementioned standard. As of June 30, 2017, Turquoise Route 10 achieved its standard and added a third day to its schedule effective July 1, 2018 with the addition of Fridays. YCAT Blue Route 5 This partnership was further broaden when ICTC started to jointly fund with YCIPTA and Quechan YCAT's Blue Route 5 in FY 2016. The route, which has been around since June 1, 2012, is a circulator running in a counter clockwise direction connecting Yuma with the Fort Yuma Indian Reservation, Winterhaven, and the Quechan Casino Resort. The service further enhances the transportation options Eastern Imperial County residents have at their disposal. And since October 20, 2013, Blue Route 5 now makes a stop at the Andrade Port of Entry. This is the first time public transit services have ever stop at this destination. Schedule Expansion Part of this expansion included an increase in Saturday service beginning August 3, 2013. Buses would now run approximately every 90 minutes on Routes 1 & 2. Trips to and from Imperial Valley College have also improved in August 2013 from an initial 7 to 11 trips a day on Route 21. Again, this alleviated overcrowding and allowed students to arrive to classes on time. Further expansion was achieved with headway improvements from 70 to 35 minutes beginning October 1, 2013 on Route 1 during peak hours from 7 a.m. thru 5:30 p.m. The immediate results were buses running on time and less passengers being left behind at bus stops. On December 18, 2013, the Brawley Gold Line circulator was established in the city of Brawley to better serve its residents and transferring passengers on the main bus routes of the system. It serves key destinations, providing greater mobility around the city. Additional circulators are planned when funding becomes available with the Garnet Line in Calexico and the Red Line in Imperial. Starting January 5, 2014, limited Sunday service was implemented between Calexico and Brawley on Routes 1 & 2 along with IVT Access, the local para transit service of Imperial Valley.Sunday Service This is the first time public transportation services has been provided county-wide on Sundays. Transit Technology In 2016, Wi-Fi has also been introduced to the entire fleet of vehicles except for the circulator routes (Blue, Gold, and Green Lines) in Brawley and El Centro.ICTC Transportation Commission Agenda of December 14, 2016 Also, most if not all vehicles have security cameras.

The highway runs between its western terminus at SR 93 in West Lafayette and its eastern terminus at a diamond interchange with I-77 on the outskirts of the village of Stone Creek. Route description SR 751 traverses portions of Coshocton and Tuscarawas Counties. There is no portion of this state highway that is included as a part of the National Highway System. History The designation of SR 751 came in 1962 along what was formerly designated SR 75 between the current western terminus in West Lafayette and the intersection with Bridge Street (formerly U.S. Route 21) in Stone Creek. The route had been a part of the state highway system since 1912, though between 1912 and 1922, the route was numbered SR 408. The next year, the route between what is now County Road 9 in Oxford Township and Stone Creek became SR 75 and the final portion between West Lafayette and CR 9 became SR 75 by 1931. The entire route of what is now SR 751 became paved by 1939. With the construction of I-75 in the western part of the state, and the state's rule that no state highway number may duplicate an Interstate or U.S. route number, SR 75 was redesignated in part as an extension of SR 93 from West Lafayette south, and as the newly designated State Route 751 from West Lafayette to Stone Creek. With the completion of I-77 around Stone Creek by 1971, and corresponding removal of US 21 from Ohio in that year, SR 751 was extended through Stone Creek from its previous eastern terminus along Bridge Street, then easterly from the split of Tuscarawas County Road 21 (former US 21) to its current eastern terminus at I-77's exit 73. No other significant changes have taken place to the routing of SR 751 since that extension.

However, in addition to the morphological debt that is used to determine phylogenetic dissimilarities in cladistics, there is also stratigraphic debt which adds the dimension of time to the equation. Although stratocladistics has been viewed with suspicion by some workers, it represents a total evidence approach that has some advantages over traditional cladistic approaches.

Young (12 January 1891 – 16 January 1981) was an American radio engineer who had many accomplishments during a long career at the U.S. Naval Research Laboratory. Although self-educated, he was a member of a small, creative team which some attributed to the developing the world's first true radar system. Background and Career Leo Crawford Young grew up on a farm near Van Wert, Ohio. Although his formal education stopped with high-school, he was self-educated in early radio technology. He built his first crystal radio when he was 14 years old. To receive stations, he learned the Morse code, and soon built his own spark-gap transmitter, joining the ranks of amateur radio enthusiasts in the pre-license days. (Young was later issued the call sign W3WV). After high school, he used his ability with Morse code to gain employment as a railroad telegrapher. In 1913, he joined the Naval Communications Reserves and set up the central control station for the Navy- Amateur Network.Geny, Doug; \\"Pioneer Radar Developer is Former Van Werter\\", by Times Bulletin, Van Wert, Ohio, September 24, 1964 The Navy Reserve was activated at the start of World War I in 1917. Young was assigned to the District Communications Office at Great Lakes, Illinois, where Albert Hoyt Taylor was the Director. Taylor was also an amateur radio operator (call sign 9YN), and he and Young began a personal and professional relationship that existed for the rest of their lives. In 1918, Taylor was sent to the former Marconi Communications Station in Belmar, New Jersey, to head the Navy's Trans-Atlantic Communications System, and then went to the Navy's Aircraft Radio Laboratory (ARL) at Anacostia, Washington, D.C.; Taylor arranged for Young to follow him in both of these assignments. In 1919, both Young and Taylor returned to civilian life, but stayed as employees at the ARL In 1922, Taylor and Young were making measurements with a transmitter located at the ARL and a receiver on the opposite shore of the Potomac River. A wavering in the strength of the received signal was noted as a wooded ship crossed the signal path. Taylor reported this to higher authorities as a potential method of detecting ships intruding into a formation, but no further tests were authorized. One of Young's projects of the ARL was in developing amplitude modulation for transmitters, allowing audio communications as an alternate to Morse code. To test the equipment, he began \\"broadcasting\\" music and short news items using call letters NSF. By 1922, this expanded to broadcasts from Congress, including an address by President Warren G. Harding. Requests for \\"air time\\" began to interfere with the Young's research work, and in early 1923, the broadcasting operation was transferred to Radio Virginia, the Naval Radio Service in Arlington, Virginia. The Naval Research Laboratory (NRL) was opened in July 1923, at Bellevue in Washington, D.C., close by Anacosia. This absorbed a number of existing Naval research operations, including the ARL. Taylor was named Superintendent of the Radio Division with Young as his assistant. Over the next decade, Young had a major role in most of the early radio developments of the NRL, including their round-the-world high-frequency experiment in 1925, communicating 10,000 miles between Radio Virginia and a U.S. Navy ship in Australia. Gregory Breit and Merle A. Tuve at the Carnegie Institution of Washington were studying the characteristics of the ionosphere (then called the Kennelly-Heaviside layer) using a transmitter built at the NRL. In attempting to determine the distance to the layer, they asked Young if he could design an appropriate modulation technique. Young suggested using pulse modulation, with the height possibly determined from the lapsed time between transmitted and received pulses. Young built the modulator, and in 1925 Breit and Tuve used this to determine that the height varied between 55 and 130 miles.Breit, G, and M.A. Tuve; \\"The Height of the Ionized Layer,\\" Physical Review, Vol. 28 (1926), p. 554 In 1930, Lawrence A. Hyland, another member of Taylor's team dating back to Great Lakes, was testing an antenna and observed interference from a passing aircraft. Reminded of the 1922 observation of a similar nature, Taylor and Young submitted a report titled \\"Radio-Echo Signals from Moving Objects,\\" and again suggested that this might be used for detection purpose. The report slowly made its way through the bureaucracy in Washington, and in early 1932 was forwarded to the Army's Signal Corps Laboratories where it fell on \\"deaf ears.\\" Taylor convinced the NRL Director to allow an internally funded low-level project on interference- based detection. Lack of success by early 1934, however, led Young to suggest trying a pulsed transmitter, similar to the one built earlier for Breit and Tuve; this would not only provide a higher peak power but the timing between the transmitted and received pulse could be used to determine the distance to the target. Robert Morris Page was assigned by Taylor to construct an experimental apparatus to test this concept. Page used a pulsed transmitter to drive an existing antenna atop the main NRL building. A receiver, modified to pass pulsed signals, had its antenna mounted some distance away from the transmitter. Both the transmitted and received signals were displayed on a commercial oscilloscope. In December 1934, this system successfully detected an aircraft at distances up to one mile as it flew up and down the Potomac River. Although the displayed signal was almost indistinct and the range was small, this was a proof of the basic concept. Based on this, Page, Taylor, and Young are usually credited with building and demonstrating the world's first true radar. (Radar is a name coming from an acronym for RAdio Detection And Ranging. A number of earlier devices, dating back to 1904, had been developed for detecting remote objects, but none of these measured the distance (range) to the target; thus, they were not radar systems.)Buderi, Robert; The Invention That Changed the World, Simon & Schuster, p. 65, 1996 With this success, in 1935 funds were officially provided for further research and development of the system. The early proof-of-concept equipment operated at 60 MHz and required an antenna impractically large for shipboard use. For the follow-on system, the frequency was raised to 200 MHz, the limit for transmitter tubes and other components at that time. This allowed the antenna to be greatly reduced in size (antenna size is inversely proportional to the operating frequency). Young and Page developed another very important component, the duplexer. This device allowed a common antenna to be used for both transmitting and receiving. With other improvements, a full prototype system was first tested at sea in April 1937. Initially designated the XAF, the system was improved and tested, then placed into production as the CXAM radar, the first such system deployed by the U.S. Navy starting in May 1940. (The acronym RADAR was coined by the Navy at that time as a cover for the highly classified work in this new technology.) Young continued to work at the NRL as a research engineer until his retirement in 1961. Mr. Young died on January 16, 1981, in Forestville, Maryland.\\"Leo Young, Retired Scientist, Helped Develop Early Radar\\", The Washington Post, January 24, 1981 Recognitions Leo C.

The theorem is named after Ukrainian mathematicians Vladimir Marchenko and Leonid Pastur who proved this result in 1967. If X denotes a m\\\\times n random matrix whose entries are independent identically distributed random variables with mean 0 and variance \\\\sigma^2 < \\\\infty, let : Y_n = \\\\frac{1}{n}X X^T and let \\\\lambda_1,\\\\, \\\\lambda_2, \\\\,\\\\dots,\\\\, \\\\lambda_m be the eigenvalues of Y_n (viewed as random variables).

Rombouts and Th. van Lerius, Antwerp, 1864, p. 252, on Google books (baptized on 24 September 1623 in Antwerp – buried on 25 June 1667 in Antwerp) was a Flemish still life painter who worked in a number of sub-genres but is principally known for his fruit still lifes. He also created flower still lifes, banquet still lifes, vanitas still lifes and pronkstillevens. He is known to have painted fish still lifes representing the Four Elements.Joris van Son at the Netherlands Institute for Art History He collaborated with figure artists on 'garland paintings', which typically represent a devotional image framed by a fruit or flower garland.Joris van Son, The lamentation with a garland of fruit at the Hermitage Life Joris van Son was born in Antwerp as the son of Joris and Catharina Formenois and was baptized on 24 September 1623 in the Antwerp Cathedral. It is not clear with which artist he trained. His work shows a strong influence of Jan Davidszoon de Heem, a Dutch still life painter who was active in Antwerp from the mid-1630s. This may be an indication that van Son studied with de Heem or was an assistant in de Heem's studio and was very familiar with de Heem's work in his formative years.Frans Jozef Peter Van den Branden, Geschiedenis der Antwerpsche schilderschool, Antwerpen, 1883, pp. 1119–1121 He became a master in Guild of Saint Luke of Antwerp in the guild year 1643/1644.De liggeren en andere historische archieven der Antwerpsche sint Lucasgilde Volume 2, by Ph. Rombouts and Th. van Lerius, Antwerp, 1864, p. 144, on Google books Still life with fruit and a glass on a ledge In 1647, he became a member of the pious bachelor society, de 'Sodaliteit van de Bejaerde Jongmans', a fraternity for bachelors established by the Jesuit order. This did not stop him from seeking out the company of women. He started a relationship with Cornelia van Heulens. Their relationship produced a daughter, Maria Chatharina, who was born on 3 August 1656. The still life painter Jan Pauwel Gillemans the Elder was her godfather. Not long thereafter, on 22 October 1656, van Son married the mother of his child. Two years later a son, who was named Jan Frans, was born. The last child of the couple, called Maria Chatharina, was baptized on 5 October 1660. Van Son's work was much appreciated by collectors and his paintings were in the collections of artists such as Victor Wolfvoet and traders such as Geraert van Dorth.Joris van Son at the Prado Museum The pupils of van Son were Frans van Everbroeck, Jan Pauwel Gillemans the Younger, Cornelis van Huynen, Norbert Montalie and Abraham Herderwijn (Aberam Herderwyn). His son Jan Frans was only nine when he died and was therefore not trained by Joris. Rather, Jan Frans was a pupil of Jan Pauwel Gillemans the Elder. Jan Frans became a still life painter and worked in England.Jan Frans van Son at the Netherlands Institute for Art History Pronk still life with overturned silver ewer Van Son died prematurely at the age of 44. He suddenly took ill in May 1667 and died in his native city where he was buried on 25 June 1667. Work General Van Son was a specialist still life painter. He practised many of the sub-genres of still life such as fruit still lifes, flower pieces, banquet still lifes, vanitas still lifes, garland paintings and pronkstillevens, i.e. sumptuous still lifes of luxurious objects. He is known to have painted fish still lifes representing the Four Elements. These showed fish lying on a beach in front of the ocean. The painter Jan van Kessel the Elder later produced similar works. The chronology of his work is not easy to establish as he did not date many of his paintings. Van Son's still lifes almost always include fruit, often of varieties that are not native but imported.Joris van Son, Fruit and Corn Hanging by a Ribbon at the National Trust Collections His still lifes are animated by branches of cherries or raspberries, which endow the composition with a great lightness. The objects are distributed on a table or ledge at a level so that an intimacy with the viewer is created. Garland of Fruit and Flowers with the Death of Adonis Garland paintings Another important portion of van Son's output falls into the category of 'garland paintings'. Garland paintings are a type of still life invented in early 17th century Antwerp by Jan Brueghel the Elder and subsequently practised by leading Flemish still life painters, and in particular Daniel Seghers. Paintings in this genre typically show a flower or, less frequently, fruit garland around a devotional image or portrait. In the later development of the genre, the devotional image is replaced by other subjects such as portraits, mythological subjects and allegorical scenes.Susan Merriam, Seventeenth-Century Flemish Garland Paintings. Still Life, Vision and the Devotional Image, Ashgate Publishing, Ltd., 2012David Freedberg, \\"The Origins and Rise of the Flemish Madonnas in Flower Garlands, Decoration and Devotion\\", Münchener Jahrbuch der bildenden Kunst, xxxii, 1981, pp. 115–150. Garland paintings were usually collaborations between a still life and a figure painter. Not all of van Son's collaborators on his garland paintings have been identified but they are known to have included Erasmus Quellinus II, Pieter Boel, Frans Wouters and Jan den Duyts.Joris van Son and attributed to Peeter Boel, Still life of fruit and flowers with parrots, monkey and tortoise at the Netherlands Institute for Art History Joris van Son and Frans Wouters, Three Putti with Vanitas Symbols within a Decorated Cartouche at the Netherlands Institute for Art History His collaborators painted the figure or figures inside the cartouche while van Son painted the fruit and flower garland. The Garland of Fruit and Flowers with the Death of Adonis is an example of a collaboration with Erasmus Quellinus. The central images in his garland paintings were devotional as well as secular. Van Son painted garland paintings with garlands of flowers and of fruits and occasionally a combination of the two with the upper part being made up of flowers and the lower part of fruit or vice versa. The fruits and flowers in these compositions are bunched together in groups that are attached to sculptural frames. His flower garlands reveal the influence of Daniel Seghers, although conceptually his work is closer to that of Jan Davidsz de Heem who is presumed by some art historians to have been his master. The light in van Son's work is softer than that in de Heem's work. Van Son was particularly skilled in the rendering of the physical qualities of the skin of fruits, as is evident in the hairiness of the peaches in his compositions. An example of a devotional garland painting is The Virgin with the Child inside a festoon of fruit (Prado Museum).Joris van Son, La Virgen con el Niño dentro de un festón de frutas at the Prado Museum Vanitas still lifes Van Son is also known for his vanitas still lifes, a genre of still lifes which offers a reflection on the meaninglessness of earthly life and the transient nature of all earthly goods and pursuits. A vanitas still-life Vanitas still lifes of van Son are listed for the first time in 1666 in Antwerp. Some of his garland paintings are vanitas paintings. This is for example the case with the composition Allegory of Human Life (At Walters Art Museum). This composition contains the typical symbols present in vanitas paintings: a skull, a burning candle and an hourglass. The flowers in high bloom and the butterflies also refer to the fleetingness of things.Joris van Son, Allegory on Human Life at the Walters Art MuseumJoris van Son, Memento Mori at the Netherlands Institute for Art History Another garland painting with vanitas motif is the Three Putti with Vanitas Symbols within a Decorated Cartouche (At Lempertz on 15 November 2014, Cologne, Lot 1072) where the typical symbols of vanitas also appear: a skull, soap bubbles and opulently glittering vases which reference the transience of things and, in particular, of earthly wealth.Joris van Son (Attributed), Three Putti with Vanitas Symbols within a Decorated Cartouche at Lempertz A pure vanitas painting is the Vanitas still-life with a skull, a pistol, a lute with broken strings, a flute (At Christie's on 10 December 2004, London lot 59), in which a wide range of vanitas symbols are displayed on a table. On the lower right of the painting are inscribed the words 'Vanitas, Vanitas. Et omnia Vanitas', which refers to the famous line of the Ecclesiastes, which in the Latin version of the bible called the Vulgate is rendered as Vanitas vanitatum omnia vanitas. In the King James Version it is translated .Joris van Son; A vanitas still-life with a skull, a pistol, a lute with broken strings, a flute at Christie's Pronkstillevens Still life with crabs, fruit and a partly peeled lemon, with glasses behind A large portion of his output consists of pronkstillevens, the sumptuous still lifes that were popular in Flanders and the Dutch Republic from the 1640s. Van Son's work in this genre was influenced by Jan Davidsz. de Heem. A representative example in this genre is the Pronk still life with overturned silver ewer (Liechtenstein Museum). Pronk still lifes are often interpreted as having a vanitas meaning.Joris van Son (Antwerp 1623-1667), Still Life with Fruit and Boiled Crayfish at the Centre for Art Technological Studies and Conservation From the late 1650s van Son painted a number of more modest still lifes in which the composition and colouring was rather restrained. An example is the Still life with fruit basket, lobster and oysters (At Hampel 7 April 2016 Munich, lot 189). These more moderate still lifes are not believed to reference the vanitas theme but rather to celebrate the varied gifts of nature.

Biography Adams was a member of an old Warwickshire family, being the second son of Mr. Serjeant Adams, by his marriage with Miss Eliza Nation, daughter of a well-known Exeter banker. He was educated at Eton and Oxford, and between the time of his leaving school and entering the university was the pupil of Dr. John Brasse, author of Brasse's Greek Gradus, by whom his great abilities were first appreciated. He obtained a postmastership at Merton, and in 1836 took a double first-class degree, his elder brother having gained a similar distinction eighteen months previously. In 1837 he became fellow and tutor of his college, and in 1840 vicar of St. Peter's-in-the-East, a Merton living generally held by a resident fellow (and nowadays deconsecrated and forming part of St Edmund Hall. With his immediate predecessor at St. Peter's, Walter Kerr Hamilton, and his immediate successor, Edmund Hobhouse, Mr. Adams was very intimate. He always took a deep interest in the welfare of the parish, and has left us an interesting memorial of his incumbency in his well-known Warnings of the Holy Week, a set of lectures preached at St. Peter's in Holy Week, 1842. In the spring of this year he went to Eton as one of the examiners for the Newcastle scholarship, and, while bathing there, was all but drowned, and caught a violent cold which, flying to his lungs, ultimately proved fatal. It was hoped that a few months of residence in a warm climate would restore his health, and he accordingly passed the winter of 1842 in Madeira. But the disease had gained too firm a hold to be checked, and he resigned his living, settling at Bonchurch, Isle of Wight. Here he passed the last few years of his life, busily engaged with his pen, and taking part in every effort to improve the spiritual condition of the neighbourhood. He was at Bonchurch acquainted with Elizabeth Missing Sewell. One of his last public acts was to lay the foundation-stone of the new church at Bonchurch; and a few months later his remains were laid in the churchyard of the old church, where, by a happy design, his grave has the ‘shadow of the cross’ ever resting upon it. All Adams's allegories were published when he was virtually a dying man. The Shadow of the Cross, written at Arborne Cottage, near Chertsey, in the summer of 1842, was followed by the Distant Hills in 1844. The design of both was to show the privileges of the baptised Christian and the danger of forfeiting those privileges. His next work, the Fall of Crœsus, was less successful; not, according to the Dictionary of National Biography (DNB), from any falling off in point of composition, but because the choice of subject was less happy. It is simply an English version of the story of Herodotus, with a Christian colouring. But his next production, the Old Man's Home, was the most successful of all his works. The DNB speculates that its success rests on the fact that the scene of it was laid in the Undercliff, which Adams knew well and loved, and which he described most vividly. The story itself is of additional interest, dealing as it does with an ‘old man,’ who is represented as hovering on the borderland between sanity and insanity, but full of true aspirations which to his keepers were unintelligible, when it is known that the author's father had done much to promote a more considerate treatment of the insane. This story was a special favourite with the poet Wordsworth. The King's Messengers was written during the very last months of Adams's life. Its object is to illustrate the danger of a wrong, and the blessedness of a right, use of money; and in the delineation of the characters the writer shows a dramatic power which he had not before displayed. Besides the works which bear William Adams's name there are two others which are to be ascribed to him, the Cherry Stones, or Charlton School, a capital story popular with boys, for the completed and edited by his brother, the Rev. Henry Cadwallader Adams, a well- known author; and Silvio, an allegory written before any of the others, and revised and published with a modest preface by another brother in 1862. The popularity of Adams's allegories, which, besides passing through many editions in English, have been translated into more than one modern language, has been out of all proportion to their apparent slightness. The circumstances of their composition, no doubt, give a tinge of romantic interest to them—an interest which extends to the brief career of their pious and gifted author. But apart from this, according to the DNB, there is a peculiar fascination about them which carries the reader along, and which thoroughly reflects the personal character of the man.

From 1949 it offered live thoroughbred racing every Friday and Saturday night May through mid-September, and also offered harness racing. Beginning in 1996, it offered simulcast wagering seven days a week all year long on thoroughbred and harness races from across the US and Canada. Admission and parking were free. For a period, this was the only track in Michigan to offer live thoroughbred racing. The track opened in 1949 for Thoroughbred flat racing. In 1953 a harness racing season was added. After 1985, only Standardbred harness racing events were run here until 2014, when Thoroughbred racing was revived. The track was sold and closed in April 2018, leaving Northville Downs as the only horse racing track in Michigan. It closed in 2019. A developer intended to use the Hazel Park site to build an Amazon distribution center. Under the ownership of Bernard Hartman and Herbert Tyner, owners of Hartman and Tyner Inc., in 2009 Hazel Park generated roughly $550,000 in revenue for the City of Hazel Park. History The 5/8-mile track was the first in the nation of this length. In the late 1940s a group of auto racing enthusiasts purchased 140 acres of landfill property on the Southwest corner of 10 Mile Road and Dequindre Road to build an auto racing track in Hazel Park. Construction began on the 5/8-mile track, but it was halted because of financial troubles with the project. A successful area businessman with a love for horse racing purchased the property from the defunct auto racing enterprise. Samuel \\"Dayton\\" Matkin, a race car driver, had suggested that the track could be converted to horse racing. (Matkin, one of the founders of the course, would serve at various times as Racing Official, Timer, and Barn Superintendent.) In the early summer of 1949, with the race track already in place, the Hazel Park Raceway worked to convert the facility to a horse racing venue, and constructed stables and related facilities. Hazel Park Raceway opened its doors on August 17, 1949 with its first thoroughbred meet. The first harness meet was held in the spring of 1953. The track was maintained as a dual-breed facility (Thoroughbred and Standardbred) from 1949 through 1984. From 1985 to May 2014, Hazel Park ran only live harness racing events. In 1996 the state legislature passed a law to authorize three casinos in Detroit. It also approved expanding betting opportunities at tracks, by authorizing betting for simulcast events. Hazel Park Raceway began offering live simulcast wagering year-round, 7 days a week, on thoroughbred and harness races from across the US and Canada. Patrons could bet on races from North America’s major race tracks in the simulcast lounges located on the 2nd, 3rd and 4th floors of the clubhouse. Attendees could bet on the biggest races in North America, including the Triple Crown of flat racing: the Kentucky Derby, Preakness, and Belmont; and the Breeder's Cup, and major harness races such as the Hambletonian and Little Brown Jug. The main building hosted simulcast races, the dining room, and the Top of the Park Grill. In 2004 Hazel Park Raceway replaced its old grandstands with a new 40,000-square foot, multi- million-dollar structure that included modern grandstands, a press box, and a gaming facility. Plans for a gaming facility, which would have included slot machines, were put on hold indefinitely pending needed legislation. The grandstands were home to Action On The Apron, a party atmosphere with an outdoor bar and live band. Patrons can get close and personal views of the horses and racing. The clubhouse was renovated throughout the years. Patrons could view the track from the dining room located in the Clubhouse on the first turn. In addition to the dining room and many concession stands, the owners added the Top of The Park Grill located on the 4th floor of the Clubhouse. During live racing (May–September), food was available from concession stands, the Top of The Park Grill, or the Clubhouse dining room. On simulcast days, food and beverages were available at the concession stand on the 3rd floor or the Top of The Park Grill. In 2014 the racetrack reintroduced Thoroughbred flat racing, in an effort to attract younger patrons. To prepare, it invested \\"approximately $250,000 in a new racing surface;\\" the soft, sandy loam had a limestone base, considered \\"ideal for thoroughbred horses.\\" Thoroughbred racing was operated through the season of 2018. Together with the year-round simulcast schedule, the racetrack had profitable operations. But that year the track was sold and racing ended. Stable fire In June 1987, a fire broke out at the Hazel Park Harness Raceway, killing 15 of the 26 horses in the stable. The average value of the horses was approximately $15,000 each. The fire started in a housing barn located about 500 yards from the grandstand, while races were still being held. The fire was contained after 30 minutes of burning; the origin of the fire is unknown. Sale and closure After the racetrack was sold to Ashley Capital in 2018, late that year demolition began. The new owners intended to develop the 140-acre property for multiple tenants of which includes, LG, Amazon, Bridgwater, Akasol, Dakkota, Hi-Lex, Enova Premier. Special events Annual fireworks In honor of Independence Day and Labor Day, fireworks were annually set off at the Hazel Park Raceway for public viewing. This was usually done after the last race of the evening.

It is mandated to provide professional, technical and instruction for special purposes and to promote research extension services and progressive leadership in agriculture, agricultural education, home technology and other related fields. Its main campus is located in Malacampa, Camiling, Tarlac. TCA derives its legal mandate as an autonomous state agricultural college from Presidential Decree (PD) 609 dated December 18, 1974 which officially terminated its merger with the Tarlac College of Technology, now Tarlac State University (TSU). As highlighted in PD 609, TCA is mandated to undertake instruction, research and extension including production programs in agriculture, agricultural engineering, veterinary science, forestry and natural resources management in Central Luzon. The college was converted into a state university, the Tarlac Agricultural University, on May 10, 2016 by virtue of Republic Act No. 10800. History The Tarlac College of Agriculture was established in 1944 as Camiling Boys/Girls High School. It started with 368 students, 13 faculty members and a school principal. But it stopped operation in December 1944 and resumed after the Liberation as Tarlac High School, Camiling Branch. The reopening of the school was a response to the clamor of parents whose children stopped schooling during the war years and the difficulty of traveling from Camiling to Tarlac. On July 6, 1945 Municipal Resolution No. 34 created the Camiling Vocational Agriculture School (CVAS) replacing Tarlac High School, Camiling Branch. That it focused on vocational agriculture was considered a means to hasten the economic recovery of the town from the ravages of the war. CVAS had 534 students and 13 faculty. From 1945 to 1948, the school offered two curricula – the general academic to enable the former students to graduate and the agriculture curriculum for the first year and second year. On September 26, 1946, the school was renamed Camiling Rural High School (CRHS). In 1948, the general curriculum was phased out. Early in 1952, the Director of Public Schools served notices that the school should be relocated to a permanent site and increase the declining enrollment. Otherwise it might be closed or transferred to another town. The most conducive for an agricultural school's expansion was found in Malacampa, a barangay seven kilometers away from the town proper. In June 1953, the school with 155 students and eight faculty moved to the new site. Classrooms and offices were made of bamboos and nipa in the “middle of a wilderness.” Funds from FOA-PHILCUSA later came and permanent buildings replaced the bamboo structures. TCA facade (Camiling, Tarlac) Expansion and development was accelerated when CRHS was converted to Tarlac National Agricultural School (TNAS) in 1957, under a Superintendent. It became a policy to make all projects profitable – piggery, poultry, goat and vegetables. Linkaging for research started from pork barrel funds. In 1961, the two-year technical agriculture post secondary course was opened and in 1963, the Health Center was built out of funds from the Philippine Charity Sweepstakes. By that time, TNAS already had a school hymn and a student publication, “The Carabao.” In 1965, TNAS and Tarlac School of Arts and Trades (TSAT) were merged to become the Tarlac College of Technology. TNAS became TCT-College of Agriculture (TCT- CA) while TSAT became the Tarlac College of Technology – College of Arts and Trades (TCT-CAT) by virtue of RA 4337. As TCT-CA, it offered three degree programs: Bachelor of Science in Elementary Education major in Elementary Agriculture or Home Economics (BSEEd); Bachelor of Science in Agriculture (BSA) major in Crop Science/Animal Science; and Bachelor of Science in Agricultural Engineering (BSAEng’g). Government programs related to agriculture, especially after the declaration of Martial Law in 1972 gave a boost to the enrollment in these courses. Graduates found immediate employment here and abroad. From all indications the school could well become autonomous. Thus, on December 18, 1974 by virtue of PD 609 issued by President Ferdinand E. Marcos, Tarlac College of Agriculture became one of the state colleges in the country. The first College President was Mr. Jose L. Milla. During President Milla's stewardship, the campus area was increased to 60 hectares; a forestry laboratory in Titi Calao, Mayantoc was acquired through PD 1506; Fishery was added to the existing production projects and joint researches with IRRI were undertaken. Enrollment further increased and the number of faculty and non-teaching. The second College President was Robustiano J. Estrada. Upon his assumption, the ten-year development program and the TCA Code were prepared. There was a major reorganization in the administrative set up of the College. Two Vice-Presidents were designated: the Vice-President for Administrative and Business Affairs took care of the non-academic staff and functions; and the Vice- President for Academic Affairs was in charge of the academic programs now based in different Institutes under a Dean. There was an exodus of faculty to take graduate studies because of the promotion scheme of state universities and colleges that gave highest point to educational attainment. Infrastructure development was also accelerated by Estrada. Academic buildings rose to accommodate enrollment that reached thousands and which increased every year. Twenty-one faculty cottages, the Girl's Dorm and Boy's Dorm, a guest house, six-door staff apartment, a research and development building, a multi-purpose building, the Administration cum library and the chapel were all constructed. The old structures were repaired and PAG- ASA established an Agro-Metrological Station. These gave a new look to the campus. By then the campus has expanded to 70 hectares, including a 4-hectare athletic oval. Research and Extension also expanded and the TCA became a byword among households in the service area. The production projects also increased, notably rice, vegetables, piggery, poultry, goat, cattle, nursery, fruit trees, seedlings and canteen service. Feliciano S. Rosete became the 3rd President of TCA when Estrada's term expired in 1989. During the first five years of Rosete's term, other infrastructures came about. The landmark was the Farmers’ Training Center built from the Countrywide Development Fund (CDF) of the then Senator Alberto G. Romulo. It was also during Pres. Rosete's term that scholarships from private individuals and NGOs started pouring in, and more curricular programs were offered. Extension and Research accomplishments also multiplied. In 2001, Philip B. Ibarra became the 4th President of TCA. His administration is noted for sustaining the gains and glories of the past while working out for more. TCA then was notable for revolutionizing its curricular offerings, computerization of enrolment and administrative system, aggressive accessing of financial and material resources, development of new leaders, and strengthening existing partnerships with local and international organizations. All these initiatives has Pushed TCA to be the Best Institution through Transparent and Caring Administration. On January 14, 2010, Max P. Guillermo, assumed the presidency of this College. He pursues a new strategic planning initiative: TCA at 2015 that outlines the formulated institutional plans, based on strategic programmatic strengths to be supported by a comprehensive development plan to make TCA an energized incubator of new ideas and center of innovation. The second term of the president unfolds more aggressive realization of the goals of the College to pursue opportunities thru external relations such as sending OJT students abroad, faculty exchange, research paper presentations and forging partnerships with universities in Asia and the world over. More outputs and completion of programs, projects and activities will be generated through the collective efforts of the administration, faculty and staff as well as the students and partner agencies. The incessant establishment of linkages with various sectors intensifies TCA's presence to be more visible. TCA will brace more challenges of the ASEAN 2015 and globalization at a greater sphere. The panoramic view of the Tarlac Agricultural University Facade After years of persistent hard work and months of anxious waiting, finally, the Tarlac College of Agriculture (TCA), home of agriculture-based scientific technology in Tarlac, is now Tarlac Agricultural University (TAU). Signed on May 10, 2016 by His Excellency Benigno S. Aquino III, Republic Act No. 10800 formally converted TCA to TAU, making the institution as the first state college in the country to be converted into a university through the Merit Evaluation System of the Commission on Higher Education (CMO No.46,S. 2012); another first for the institution. Science Tourism * Tarlac Agricultural University. The public University offers a perfect place for agro-ecotourism excursion. Its three main exploration facilities such as the Bamboo Park, Agro - Ecotourism and The Research and Production district provides an ambiance of a Rural tourism and Agricultural science based activities. The University has the Ecotourism Hostel, Continuing Education Center and Bamboo Training Center for Accommodation and Seminars/Training services. It has also the TAU Function hall. Symbol The carabao has always been the symbol of the Tarlac College of Agriculture. The carabao is resilient even through the ages, synonymous to actions and sustained accomplishments, that is TCA through the years. It is always good to go back to memory lane and learn how the College has weathered storms before reaching its present status.

In 1969, while reading Henry Miller's The Time of the Assassins, his study of Arthur Rimbaud, Robbins became aware of Kenneth Rexroth's poetry through Miller's reference to Rexroth's remarkable \\"Memorial\\" for Dylan Thomas,poetryfoundation.org \\"Thou Shalt Not Kill,\\" about which Miller stated, \\"If one has any doubts about the fate which our society reserves for the poet, let him read this \\"'Memorial.'\\" During this early period of development Robbins had preceded reading Miller's book on Rimbaud with The Diary of Najinsky, Van Gogh's Letters, Kenneth Patchen's The Journal of Albion Moonlight, Jack Hirschman's Artaud Anthology, and Wilhelm Reich's The Murder of Christ, making the connection to Rexroth's elegy for Thomas timely in the way that it lyrically and convincingly categorizes and specifies the violent multi-faceted alienation of society with the vulnerability and ensuing martyrdom of certain artists. As suggested by Robbins' prose poem monologue \\"My Dylan Thomas,\\" the Welsh poet was an inspiration and an early influence. At age eighteen Robbins attended a production of Sidney Michaels' Dylan: A Play Based On Dylan Thomas In America By John Malcolm Brinnin and Leftover Life To Kill By Caitlin Thomas. The production was an inspiration adding to Robbins's continuing study of Thomas's poetry with a new emphasis on sound, voice, and prosody in general. After a five-year period of studying many of the key books of Western literature, philosophy and politics, Robbins decided to search for a way to contact Rexroth who had become—through his essays in Bird in the Bush, Classics Revisited, and Assays; along with his Collected Shorter Poems, Collected Longer Poems, and his many books of translations—his initial literary guide. Robbins discovered from an old friend attending the University of California, Santa Barbara, that Rexroth taught a course in Poetry, Song, and Performance at UCSB. At the evening course, Robbins introduced himself to Rexroth who generously requested he recite his poems during the class performances. For several weeks thereafter Robbins was a visitor-participant in Rexroth's poetry seminar held in his home in Montecito. They remained in contact until Rexroth's death in 1982. The events in 1971, and the ensuing friendship with Rexroth would prove particularly decisive for Robbins' development as a poet and essayist. It was at this time that he re-connected with his old friend; poet, translator, art curator, and publisher John Solthighmoonoon.com who had become friends with Rexroth and his wife, Carol Tinker. Political sensibility Clearly, as explored in his essay The Tropic of Rabelais, the Passage to Whitman: A Note on Poetry and Community,Third Rail #4, 1980. and his prose poem, Sympathetic Manifesto,From Sympathetic Manifesto, Perivale Press, 1987. honoring the anarchist organizer, lecturer and teacher Voltairine de Clerye, Robbins' working-class political sensibility is not simply one of dissidence and alienation. It could be stated that several of his poems from his earlier collections, such as For Pablo Neruda, Hooker with a Lily,From The Roots and the Towers, Third Rail Press, 1980. They're Honking at a Woman, The Boss Jack Sterner had a Dream, Collecting Myself,Sympathetic Manifesto or the later poems My Pico Boulevard, Gregor Samsa's Face, Her Friday,From Driving Face Down, Eastern Washington University Press 2001. and his more recent poems Dignity in Naples and North Hollywood, Latina Worker, My Piece of the Puzzle, and Before and After TampicoFrom My Piece of the Puzzle, Eastern Washington University Press, 2008.poetry.la display direct parallels to Marx's compassionate diatribe in his chapter \\"Alienated Labor\\" from the Economic and Philosophical Manuscripts, but the underlying thematics in Robbins' political poems are anarchist variations of the claims he made in the...Rabelais...Whitman essay alluded to above: Really, if our values are at all valuable, it would be a process of false logic to believe in anything that has to do with the world powers. The very fact that they have the means to help but no active concern for whole populations of unemployed, marginally employed, underfed people—aside from turning them into submissive robotized satellites of exploitative disgrace—shows that these powers are an invention of the ethically dispossessed.\\"Third Rail #4, 1980, p.35. Again, as in his Neruda poem, the notion of legendary individuals takes precedence over the social conditions they have pitted themselves against—de Clerye as a teacher and organizer is celebrated for her devotion to alleviating economic violence to immigrants and the poor, Neruda for a comparable political consciousness in his poems and his activism in Chilean politics; with Rabelais and Whitman he states that we never feel they are artists in the way we understand Antonin Artaud or William Burroughs to be, as understandable as their positions are—their work is almost exclusively a violent depiction of a desperately avaricious and alienated world, it is a literature of revolt, revulsion, and frustrated purgation. With Rabelais and Whitman we have the literature of liberation: imaginative, sexual, worldly, and above all humane.Third Rail #4, p. 34. Ultimately, Robbins' writings containing social issues can not be easily classified. On the one hand, his narrator cogently, even passionately explores and exposes injustices his characters' endure. There is a sense of working-class rage. Moreover, these poems have the effect of elegies to the actual human values abused by the world capitalist system and the various branches of the soviet communist system. However, his conclusions, if there is a remedy to be found in his writings, might be said to be founded in a poetically reductive idealism; for example, he concludes the prose poem \\"Sympathetic Manifesto\\" with these final lines: \\"I will always believe in the Revolution, and in something better: the rarer action, said Prospero, is in Virtue than in Vengeance\\" (60). And he concludes his essay on Charles Bukowski by stating that \\"To survive without adding to the horror is sometimes the best we can do; it is at least an effort that makes sense as a starting point. There is courage, discipline, and cunning in the effort. Finally, what remains after a poet's survival, which is not an inconsequential matter in our culture—is the art. In the art of Bukowski the most central theme, both comically and tragically, is simply the passion to exist, to take it as it comes, recount what it was all about, and, paradoxically, recount the butchery done to that passion, and the butchery endured, by humans.\\"Notes to The Three Penny Opera, Grove, p. 99. Finally, there does not appear to be a consistent \\"reductive\\" quality in his interpretations and conclusions but a variety of crucial insights and problem-solving or lamentably unsolvable approaches; here his path of interpretative and representative response and expression finds allegiance with Bertolt Brecht in his statement that \\"Complex seeing must be practiced.\\" Current poems that exemplify his radical working-class, anti-war complexity are \\"Predators' Hour2, Open All Night\\"My Piece of the Puzzle (63-66). and \\"Ash Lands.\\" Each poem can be found at pemmicanpress.com. Regarding Robbins' poetry, Bill Mohr has stated that > Art supposedly gives us aesthetic distance. Knowing the limited capacity of > art to redeem anybody's suffering, Robbins' poems provide no such obvious > safety net. On the other hand, the voice in his poems, with its impeccable > contralto of hope and revulsion, reminds us not to accept any limits other > than our own resilient skepticism.Beyond Baroque Magazine Vol. 26 No. 2, > 2004. On his web site, one of the quotes Robbins refers to from Albert Camus concretely supports the paradox of artistic skepticism: \\"Art itself could probably not produce the renascence which implies justice and liberty. But without it, that renascence would be without forms and, consequently, would be nothing.\\"See \\"Biography,\\" Dorenrobbins.com. Cultural work Influenced by several alternative poetry journals of the period, such as George Hitchcock's Kayak, Clayton Eshleman's Caterpillar, and Robert Bly's The Seventies with its emphases on \\"wild association\\", political poetry, and critical book reviews, Robbins co-founded the literary Journal, Third Rail (Los Angeles, CA 1975), with fellow poet Uri Hertz. He co-edited until 1980, remaining as a contributing editor until 1982. The avant-garde of the period had at least two specific modernist traditions. One, was the ongoing longer-poem development of a personal-historical, disjunctive, elliptical, interior monologue and collage form like that of Ezra Pound's Cantos, William Carlos Williams's Paterson, Louis Zukofsky's \\"A\\", and Charles Olsen's The Maximus Poems. The shorter, lyrical development continued out of the non-referential poems of Gertrude Stein's Tender Buttons, the French \\"cubist\\" poetry of Pierre Reverdy, and the short, sometimes opaque poems of the American poets George Oppen, the aforementioned Zukofsky, and to a certain extent their inheritors Robert Duncan, Robert Creeley, and the Beat Generation poet Philip Whalen. On the other hand, Beat poets Allen Ginsberg, Harold Norse, and Charles Bukowski carried on the Whitman tradition of the authentic voice, \\"I was the man, I suffered, I was there.\\" Eshleman's Caterpillar combined both traditions, including that of European and Latin American surrealism. Similar to George Hitchcok's Kayak and Eshleman's Caterpillar, Robert Bly's magazine represented an international modernist faction closely related to surrealism, but a surrealism driven by emotional and sociological dynamics forcing the poet to invent a new imagery, not always aligned with rational analysis, as compared to a surrealism of \\"automatic writing\\" often leaving the reader with an alternate disappointment to that of the game of indeterminacy and abstract expression resulting in the majority of language poets. To this end Bly emphasized the works of Georg Trakl, Federico García Lorca, César Vallejo and Pablo Neruda in particular. There is a good deal of reductive theorizing and a certain degree of non-substantive depth psychology fantasizing in Bly's arguments, while his own poetry, surreal and otherwise, often struggles with the effects of sentimentality and bathos; however, his influence urging poets toward a more passionate sense of psychoanalytic personal and radical social awareness, imagery and association cannot be underestimated. For Hertz and Robbins, at least up to 1982, it appears the generally mutual focus of Third Rail was basically connected to the paths Kayak, Caterpillar, and The Seventies were taking. That is, there was a strong interest in continuing the development of an international poetry, generally written in a language Rexroth himself referred to as \\"the international idiom\\". From 1975–1982, Third Rail published works by Henry Miller, Walter Lowenfels, Kenneth Rexroth, Robert Bly, Jack Micheline, Christopher Buckley,creativewriting.ucr.edu Douglas Blazek, Andrea Hollander Budy, Naomi Shihab Nye, Barbara Szerlip, Kazuko Shiraishi, Takahashi Shinkichi, Paul Eluard, Blaise Cendrars, Pablo Neruda, Juan Armando Epple, Pablo Antonio Cuadra, Natalia Gorbanevskaia, Anna Akhmatova and many lesser known poets. The journal also published special sections on political events, such as \\"Poets on Chile, Neruda, Allende\\" (1976) and \\"Poets Against Nuclear Power\\" (1980). Hertz and Robbins conducted interviews with the internationally renowned Japanese poet, Kazuko Shiraishi, and surrealist poet and founder of Kayak Press, George Hitchcock. Robbins regularly published his poems in the journal along with critiques of the poetry of William Pillin, Philip Whalen, Bert Meyers, Clayton Ehsleman, Katerina Gogou, and Carol Tinker. In 1994, Robbins was a guest editor for the Japanese-based Literary Journal, Electric Rexroth. His selection of contemporary poets and prose poets included work by Sharon Doubiago, Linda Janakos, Robert Bly, Gerald Stern, Philip Levine, Ralph Salisbury, Ingrid Wendt, Clayton Eshlemen, Marvin Bell, and Tania Pryputniewicz. Robbins' selections for Electric Rexroth were informed by a desire to present poems that contested at least two of the crucial criticisms of contemporary narrative lyrical poetry: one, that imagery had become convenient rather than fresh and emotionally driven; and two, the anecdotal self-consciousness pervading mainstream poetry had resulted in a lack of urgency in speech rhythms, while the effects of sound had become routine to the point of cliché. The narrative idiosyncrasies, unique imagery and fantasy, idiomatic freshness, emotional and philosophical insights in Sharon Doubiago's, \\"Someone waiting for me among the violins,\\" Philip Levine's, \\"The Simple Truth,\\" Tania Pryputneiwicz's \\"Labor,\\" and Gerald Stern's \\"Ducks Are for Our Happiness,\\" are four of the fourteen selections that clearly stand as testimonials for the ongoing vitality of original expression continuing to generate out of the Whitman-W.C. Williams tradition, emphasizing poetry written in a common language close to American idiomatic speech. Two other works Robbins selected for Electric Rexroth, Robert Bly's \\"An Open Rose,\\" and \\"Grandma's Myth\\" by Linda Drand (aka Linda Janakos), are, respectively, strong representations of prose poetry and the hybrid prose poem-short fiction form Robbins himself would develop in his 2004 book, Parking Lot Mood Swing: Autobiographical Monologues and Prose Poetry (Cedar Hill Press). Themes Ethnic and working- class themes are embodied in the characters and narrators in Doren Robbins' poems. Most of these characters are family members or friends Robbins worked with when he was pantry man, broiler chef, deliveryman, book store clerk, or carpenter. Whether they be family members that escaped pogroms in Ukraine, deserted the Russian Revolution, survived WWI, WWII, the American-Korean War, or contemporary veterans and immigrants that returned from the American- Vietnam War or the violent conflicts in Latin America, many of these characters are survivors of the ongoing industry of international civilized violence. The storytellers that passed on the historical experience of persecution, exploitation, rape, and murder are legendary characters in the sense that they had the will and the luck to emigrate and survive. Some of these characters appear in the poems \\"Before and After Tampico\\", \\"Four Family\\", and \\"My Pico Boulevard\\". The later poem literally emphasizes and politicizes the French poet Blaise Cendrars' declaration and manifesto, \\"Poetry is in the Streets\\" (\\"Le Poesy es en la rue\\"), while extending his claim to the notion that the poetry emerging from these streets is historical and demands a radical disclosure and expression regarding the ideologies of power and censorship underlying and undermining the subject. These and several other of his poems are a compassionate and bitter witnessing of injustice and attest to a realism with ethical concerns stretching back to the Jewish Prophets of the First Testament. One of his more noted poems, \\"For Neruda\\",Robbins, Roots 11. his elegy to the Chilean poet Pablo Neruda, commemorates the life and work of Neruda as one to be celebrated for his compassion, dissidence, and rage, not only for his remarkable love poems, or for his allegiance to Joseph Stalin. Robbins' notion of the legendary individual is not associated with archetypal patterns that are readily universal, but with archetypal characters that are autonomous in relation to the uniqueness of time, place, and culture. Furthermore, these characters are not epic or tragic heroes; they are cooks, carpenters and war veterans making enough to live month-to-month, a political exile saving money to bring the rest of his family across the U.S. border, a guy who survived a concentration camp working the delicatessen counter, waitresses and cashiers working in poor coffee shops and department stores. His poems \\"Anna\\", and \\"Dvayda\\", display the tradition of the legendary common woman linked to Chaucer's Wife of Bath with her exceptional forthrightness or Shakespeare's Emilia with her erotic honesty and her ethical, non-negotiable good will. The struggles and comradeship of the two main characters of B. Traven's The Death Ship can be seen in a parallel frame with the aforementioned poem, \\"Before and After Tampico.\\" For Robbins, the Ars Poetica of \\"Poetry is in the Streets\\" does not erase the imaginative drive for creating complex narrative poems that modulate space and time, utilize unusual or surreal images, hyperbolic and ecstatic metaphors with the purpose in essence being to create and perform highly rhythmic lyrical-narrative poems capable of carrying a variety of the tones of emotional expression. Unlike the elegies to the renowned poets Neruda or Pavese,Robbins, Sympathetic 15. one of the poems that best represents Robbins' method is the elegy, \\"Name a Dish After Me\\",Robbins, Donkey's 52. written about the early death of his brother-in-law, John Mazak, who was a cook. Here the leaps and associations from Mazak's death to his childhood, to scenes of his surviving daughters and sister, to the speaker's reflections and fantasies musically build-up to an emotionally intricate closure. Robbins has also created a substantial body of poems exploring the conflicts and celebrating the ecstasy and emotional complexity of married life, including the unique bond between parent and child. These poems are included in his earlier books Sympathetic ManifestoRobbins, Doren, Sympathetic Manifesto, (Van Nuys: Perivale Press, 1987) 73-91. and Seduction of the Groom.Robbins, Doren, Seduction of the Groom: Love Poems (Palos Verdes, Loom Press, 1982). The strongest examples of earlier poems in this genre are \\"In-terminal Rose\\", \\"Seduction of the Groom\\", \\"Dreaming of a Daughter\\", and \\"In the Middle of a Fight\\". Examples from his more recent collections Double MuseRobbins, Doren, Double Muse (Rabbel-A Press 1998)., The Donkey's TaleRobbins, Doren. The Donkey's Tale (Los Angeles, Red Wind Press, 1999). Driving Face Down,Robbins, Doren, Driving Face Down (Spokane, Eastern Washington UP, 2001). and \\"My Piece of the Puzzle,Robbins, Doren, My Piece of the Puzzle (Spokane, Eastern Washington UP, 2008) include \\"You Have Brought So Much To This Marriage. And So Have I\\", \\"Marc Chagall and the Male Soul\\", \\"I Went Through a Box of Emily's Shell Jewelry\\", \\"The Eighties\\"; and from current published poems: \\"Pulled Over\\", \\"The Fire Petal\\", \\"The Weaving\\", \\"The Sexiest Part\\", \\"My Boat, My Waves\\", and \\"Badlands and Outlands\\". While the poems listed above are products of a sensual, emotionally confrontational, and melancholic sensibility, \\"Badlands and Outlands\\" (Double Muse 1998) is the longest and most ambitious of his love poems. As compared to the overall compilation of his poems exploring divisions or celebrating sex and intimate companionship, \\"Badlands and Outlands\\" is a meditation on a divided and partially formed personality, a possibly undependable sexually charged partner who is still aware of the potential for a way out of marital commitment. The narrator observes his habits and behaviors with their sometimes self-destructive drives (self- destructive in the sense that intimate trust is damaged by lust); he faces \\"not exhilaration,/ not imagery, [but] some other shore/ where celebrating stops […]\\" And yet, there is \\"…the sustaining presence / of Venus Janakosov\\" and, finally, his connecting attraction for her is \\"crested, empathic, vulgar.\\" The poem, for all of its self-destructive plunging and reflection is a commitment to marriage resonating with fertility and ambiguity: \\"momentary undermined attentions, in Florence—/ the fatigue and vibrant tone,/ the sunflower's hole cragged with seeds, in Florence,/ the frame without angles, in Florence.\\" Style, form, and themes Many poets confronting the limitations of lineation in poetry, while desiring a wider subject matter and freedom in the approach to style, have turned to the prose poem. In his craft statement on writing prose poetry Robbins noted, \\"I do not work in formal structures, but I have worked diligently to create 'free verse' and prose poem styles that retain the dynamics of what Whitman called 'the poetic quality'[…]\\" It is well known that Ford Maddox Ford and Ezra Pound believed poetry should be at least as well written as prose; the opposite is also true, especially in terms of sensitivity to sound, not to mention an active rhythmic phrasing flowing directly or erratically as emotional tone forces arrangements of meaning.Doren Robbins, [untitled statement of prose poetry], Bear Flag Republic: Prose Poems and Poetics from California, ed. Christopher Buckley and Gary Young (Santa Cruz: Greenhouse Review Press/ Alcatraz Editions, 2008) 327-28. Arguably, the collage technique of monologue, short fiction, prose poem, interior monologue, and vaudeville-influenced dialogue reflect an attraction to Chaucer's high mockery in House of Fame, Bottom's dream from A Midsummer Night's Dream, as well Shakespeare's other \\"clowns\\" in Othello and particularly the \\"philosophizing\\" clown in King Lear. Robbins' first prose collection, Parking Lot Mood Swing: Autobiographical Monologues and Prose Poetry, certainly displays an affinity with Sterne's enlightened absurdities and non-liner style in Tristram Shandy. His prose poem essay in Bear Flag Republic notes with appreciation the writings of Louis-Ferdinand Celine, Henry Miller, Samuel Beckett, Marguerite Young, Kurt Vonnegut Jr., Thomas Bernhard, Stephen Dixon, and Kenneth Patchen of the previously noted Journal of Albion Moonlight. Such works as \\"Chaucer's Quill, Sappho's Libido, Frida Kahlo's Eye Brows\\", \\"Dealing With the Insomnia Surf\\", \\"Pantagruel Antigruel\\", \\"As Much Sex as Elvis\\", \\"Green Torso\\", and \\"Whitman, Artaud, and the Punk Nation\\", from Parking Lot Mood Swing appear to be a natural form for supporting his drive to include in a serio-comic poetic language subjects and details usually left out of poetry. Whether these \\"omissions\\" are implicit to the ongoing decorum of lyric poetry, or if the matter revolves around the restrictions of lineation as compared to the reality of including unlimited material expressed in rhythmic sentences, Robbins recent publications indicate he has opted for working in this genre along with his ongoing lyric-narrative output. Supporting this claim are several prose examples published after Parking Lot Mood Swing, such as \\"Alternate Robonovich, Adjunct\\",25\\\\. Robbins, Café Irreal, #29 \\"Nothing but an Ear\\",See Exquisite Corpse, #14 & #16 \\"Arlon's Talking to Himself Memoir\\",See Hotel Amerika, Vol.7, No. 2 from the forthcoming novella, Twin Extra (Highmoonoon 2010); and \\"Just My Luck\\", \\"My Defects Call Me Back\\", and \\"Night Song\\" from the Bear Flag Republic prose poem anthology.

A single prototype was built in 1938 for evaluation purposes. Although a promising design it was recommended that it be introduced into production as a high-speed dive bomber with a reduced armament to increase its speed. Development The VIT-2 was derived from the VIT-1 prototype, but it was given Klimov M-105 engines and its structure was revised. It was a low- winged, twin-engined aircraft with a mixed structure. The monocoque fuselage was made in halves of 'shpon', molded birch plywood and a large fuel tank was placed between the pilot and rear gunner. The fuel tank was moved to the rear and the canopy was lengthened in consequence. The wing structure was built from a mix of steel tubes and duralumin with a duralumin skin. The empennage was redesigned as a twin tail. The main legs of the conventional landing gear retracted aft into the engine nacelles and were given fairing to reduce drag when retracted, but the tail-wheel was fixed. The nose was extensively glazed to give the bombardier/navigator good visibility and he was armed with a ShVAK cannon with 10° of vertical travel. The rear gunner/radio operator sat in a manually operated turret armed with another ShVAK and he was also provided with a retractable pair of ShKAS machine guns for ventral defense. Two Shpitalnyi Sh-37 cannon and two more ShVAKs were mounted in the wing roots. Up to of bombs could be carried internally in the fuselage or a pair of FAB-500 bombs could be carried under the wings.Gordon, p. 282 The prototype was first flown on 11 May 1938 by the famous pilot Valery Chkalov and had its propellers replaced by constant speed VISh-61 propellers shortly afterwards.

The track was written by Savan Kotecha, Max Martin and Johan \\"Shellback\\" Schuster, and produced by the latter two. It is an electropop song with Eurodance influences, and its compositional structure is noticeably different from the other songs on Echo. The instrumentation consists of keyboard riffs and beats, instead of pianos and guitars which are used on the other songs. The chorus of \\"Outta My Head\\" was compared to the works of Australian singer Kylie Minogue and German group Cascada due to its Eurodance style. It debuted and peaked at number 98 on the Slovakian Singles Chart upon the release of Echo. Lewis has performed the song on Jimmy Kimmel Live! and it was included on the set list of her debut concert tour, The Labyrinth (2010). Recording and composition \\"Outta My Head\\" was written by Savan Kotecha, Max Martin and Shellback, with production done by the latter two, for Lewis's second studio album, Echo (2009). It was recorded by Ann Miniceli at Maratone Studios in Stockholm, Sweden, and at Germano Studios in New York. She was assisted in the process by Christian Baker. It was mixed by Serban Genea at MixStar Studios in Virginia Beach, Virginia. The Pro Tools engineer for the mixing was John Hanes, and his assistant was Tim Roberts. \\"Outta My Head\\" is an electropop song with Eurodance influences which lasts for a duration of three minutes and 39 seconds; it appears as the fifth song on the standard United Kingdom track list of Echo. On the US edition, it runs for one second less and is included as the sixth track. The instrumentation of \\"Outta My Head\\" is different from the rest of the songs on Echo and does not follow the same styles of production. Instead of using pianos and guitars, it employs \\"stuttering keyboard riffs\\" and \\"cheap beats\\". The lyrics of the song contain a \\"Fk you!\\" sentiment. \\"Outta My Head\\" moves at a tempo of 130 beats per minute in the key of C major. Lewis' vocals span from G3 to A5.http://m.musicnotes.com/sheetmusic/mtdFPE.asp?ppn=MN0081540&ref;=google The song follows a chord progression of F–C–Em. Critical reception \\"Outta My Head\\" garnered mixed reviews from music critics. Nick Levine for Digital Spy described \\"Outta My Head\\" as a \\"genuine surprise\\" because of its uptempo style and how different it is to the rest of the songs on Echo, which Levine thought often sounded the same from song to song. He further wrote that the chorus is something which would suit German Eurodance group Cascada. Writing for The Independent, Andy Gill praised the song for its \\"fast, juddering\\" style and wrote that it is the edgiest song on the album. Although, he thought that it did not deviate from \\"the chunky, machine-like reliability\\" which is present on the rest of Echo. Michael Cragg for musicOMH complimented the song for lifting Echos overall feel of being \\"mundane\\", and that it is an \\"obvious highlight\\" of the album. He continued to write that the chorus is \\"brilliantly camp\\" and would be well suited to Kylie Minogue. Nate Chinen for The New York Times thought that Lewis was trying to show musical relevance with songs such as \\"Outta My Head\\" and \\"Love Letter\\", but achieves it with mixed results. \\"But Ms. Lewis strives for relevance here too, with mixed results. \\"Love Letter\\" is Kelly Clarkson without the spunk; \\"Outta My Head\\" is Lady Gaga without the smirk.\\" Mike Diver for BBC Music thought that the song represents \\"cheesy\\" Eurodance and almost achieves being a credible dance song, if it was not for the slightly \\" too cheap-sounding, too tinny of production\\". As part of his review of Echo, Matthew Cole for Slant Magazine wrote that he was unimpressed by the \\"novelty\\" of Lewis' impressive vocals, writing that she uses the higher registers of her voice too much. \\"The fact that Lewis can sing isn't a novelty here—it's the premise of the album. On nearly every track she can be found cooing impossibly high melodies over bouncing club beats ('Can't Breathe,' 'Outta My Head') or imbuing the ballads with thick, powerful choruses to match their outsized string arrangements ('Broken'). Hugh Montgomery, writing for The Guardian, was critical of the song, writing that it is the \\"only serious misfire\\" on the album and that it confirms how \\"Lewis does sexy and upbeat like Jedward do singing in tune.\\" Although he thought Lewis' vocals are \\"technically unimpeachable\\" on \\"Outta My Head\\", it is the artistry behind it which fails to deliver. Live performances Lewis performed \\"Outta My Head\\" for the first time live on Jimmy Kimmel Live! on 25 November 2009 in the United States. She also performed the lead single from the album, \\"Happy\\". The song was included as the seventeenth song on the set list of her debut concert tour, called The Labyrinth (2010). It was later included on the DVD release of the tour, The Labyrinth Tour: Live from the O2. Lewis performed the song in the last section of the set list, along with a cover of Eurythmics \\"Sweet Dreams (Are Made of This)\\" and Lewis' version of \\"Run\\".

In 1938 and 1939, Murphy and his twin brother, William, won consecutive Big Ten Conference doubles championships while competing for the University of Chicago. In 1939, he was also the runner-up in the NCAA singles and doubles championships. Murphy later had a long career as a tennis coach and instructor at the University of Minnesota, the University of California, Berkeley and The Broadmoor Resort in Colorado Springs. He has also published several books on tennis. Tennis player A native of Chicago, Illinois, Murphy and twin brother, William, began to play as a doubles team for Tilden High School in Chicago. The brothers won the Illinois High School Athletics Association state championship in doubles in both 1934 and 1935. They played for the University of Chicago from 1937 to 1939, leading the school to three Big Ten tennis championships. As a doubles team, they were \\"undefeated in collegiate meets,\\" including wins at the Big Ten doubles championships in 1938 and 1939. They were also the runner-up team at the 1939 NCAA doubles championship. In 1938, the Murphy brothers helped the undefeated University of Chicago tennis team score the first clean sweep in the history of the Big Ten tennis championships by winning all nine finals matches at Evanston, Illinois. The brothers won the doubles title over the Northwestern team, 5-7, 6-4, 7-5. John Shostrom won the No. 1 singles and the Murphy brothers won the No. 2 and No. 3 singles. At the national level, the Murphy brothers were ranked as the #10 doubles pair by the United States Lawn Tennis Association in 1938. In May 1939, when the Murphy brothers led the University of Chicago to its third straight Big Ten Tennis Championship, the Associated Press wrote: \\"The University of Chicago, where the athletic habit of recent years had leaned toward defeat, now has a new complex well-established - tennis championships.\\" The Murphy brothers won their second consecutive doubles championship, and Chet won the No. 1 singles. In June 1939, the brothers were runners-up in the NCAA doubles championship to Bob Peacock and Doug Imhoff of University of California-Berkeley, and Chet was runner-up in the NCAA singles championship to Frank Guernsey of Rice in Texas. In US Singles competition, Chet played Bill Talbert several times and never lost to him. He was one of the best tennis players in the United States at that time. In May 1939, Murphy played an exhibition match against the top- ranked American female tennis player, Alice Marble. The match was played in front of a \\"throng of 2,000, so crowded it was difficult to watch,\\" with Murphy winning in straight sets, 6-4, 6-3. Tennis coach and author In 1941, Murphy received a master's degree in physical education from George Williams College in Chicago. Then he served five years as a naval aviator in World War II. After being discharged from the Navy, Murphy began a career as a tennis coach. He taught Lorraine Williams, who won the National 15 Singles title in 1953. He taught and coached tennis at the University of Chicago, University of Detroit, University of Denver, University of Minnesota and University of California, Berkeley. In four years at Minnesota (1956–1959), Murphy started with a team in 1956 that went 1-7, but turned the program into a winner with a 9-4 record in 1959. In ten years as the tennis coach at California (1960–1969), Murphy compiled a record of 80-52. His best season at Cal was 1961. With #1 player, Jim McManus, his team finished with a record of 11-3, placed third in the AAWU, and advanced to the NCAA Semifinals, finishing third. While on a summer break from college coaching, Murphy accepted a position as Head Tennis Professional at The Broadmoor Resort in Colorado Springs. He returned the following summer and began a program that \\"helped establish the Broadmoor as one of the preeminent tennis centers in the United States.\\" In addition to collegiate coaching, Murphy directed the tennis programs at The Broadmoor for 44 summers. (\\"Broadmoor's head tennis professional Chet Murphy was recently appointed NCAA delegate to the Tennis Games Committee of the United States Collegiate Sports Council.\\") Murphy had success as a writer of books about tennis. He and his brother, Bill, co- authored the \\"Tennis Handbook\\", first published in 1962. On his own or as a co-author with his brother, Chet Murphy also wrote \\"Advanced Tennis,\\" \\"Tennis for the Player, Teacher, and Coach,\\" \\"Tennis for Thinking Players,\\" \\"Lifetime of Tested Tennis Tips,\\" and \\"A Parents Guide to Teaching Kids to Play.\\" In 1956, Murphy received a Doctor of Education degree from the University of Michigan. In 2000, Murphy moved to Tucson, Arizona to be with brother, Bill, who died in 2005. Then in 2014, after son, Tony died, he moved from Tucson to live with his son, Tom, in Newnan, Georgia.

It was founded in the 12th century, by monks from the Cluniac Priory of St Pancras in Lewes, East Sussex, now known as Lewes Priory, and passed into private hands at the time of the Dissolution of the Monasteries under Henry VIII. The last private owner, the jeweller R. A. Jones, gave the priory and the grounds to the local council. The grounds now form a public park, Priory Park, and the Grade I listed building is open to the public as a museum. Priory Park is located adjacent to the priory. History Prittlewell Priory was founded by the Cluniac Order as a cell to the Priory of St Pancras at Lewes, East Sussex. Prittlewell was one of the lesser monasteries, housing not more than 18 monks. In 1536 much of the building was destroyed, and what remained was much altered during the 18th century. Alterations were made again in the early 20th century, when the refectory was restored and partly rebuilt. A number of original features do survive, including a 12th-century doorway with chevron and dog-tooth ornamentation. After the Dissolution the priory was a private residence. According to William White, in his 1848 Directory of Essex, on the Dissolution \\"...[the Priory's] revenues were valued at £194.14s.3d. per annum, and it was granted to Lord Chancellor Thomas Audley, who conveyed it to Robert, son of Lord Rich. It afterwards passed with the manor to various families\\". The last family to live there, the 19th-century Scrattons, are explored in an exhibition inside the house. In 1917 the building was purchased by Robert Jones, and in May 1922 it opened as Southend's first museum. In 2011 works began on refurbishing the existing buildings and the construction of a new Visitor Centre. The £2 million works were in part funded by the Heritage Lottery Fund and the Cory Environmental Trust in Southend-on-Sea, hlf.org.uk. Retrieved 23 May 2012 and were undertaken by The Facility Architects and Ibex Interiors. Works were completed in the summer of 2012 and the Priory re-opened in the June of that year. The new Visitor Centre, adjacent to the Priory, opened in February 2013.  Conflict with Lewes Priory  Lewes, holding dominion over the monastery at Prittlewell, were responsible for electing the prior who would rule there. In 1311, this post was granted to William le Auvergnat. Two years into his rule, however, he was accused of corruption, and the prior of Lewes attempted to remove him. This led to a prolonged conflict between the two priories, with Lewes promoting the ascension of James de Cusancia, and William steadfastly opposing his displacement. Due to this unrest, the prior of Prittlewell was summoned before the King in 1318. During this audience, William outwardly resigned his position, only to return to the monastery and forcibly occupy it with his supporters. In 1321, the monks of Lewes armed themselves and launched a counterattack, invading the priory as Mass was being said. Captives were seized and spirited away to face punishment, and William himself was struck a fatal blow at the altar, his death finally allowing James de Cusancia to succeed him as prior of Prittlewell.

In 1869 he moved to West Ogwell manor houseObituary Notice - Daniel Robert Scratton: Transactions of the Devonshire Association, Vol.34, 1902, p. 36in Devon, where he died in 1902. It was only when William Howell Scratton purchased the Priory in 1887 that it truly became a family home. The family created a walled kitchen garden, which originally had hot houses and a melon pit. This was on the site of the monks' burial ground. Today, it is an ornamental garden. The Collections The Victorian extension of the Priory, which once housed the bedrooms, now hosts an interactive display on the local wildlife. Other collections at the Priory include Daniel Robert Scratton of Prittlewell Priory, Essex by Stephen Pearce (1867) and Mrs Scratton of Prittlewell Priory by an unknown artist. Priory Park When R A Jones purchased the Priory, he also purchased a large tract of the surrounding land, which he donated to the town for the creation of Priory Park. The Park was formally opened on 14 July 1920 by the Duke of York, who was later to become King George VI.

It is an alternative theory to the grandmother hypothesis which tends to ignore male benefits of continued spermatogenesis and their roles in assistance. The patriarch hypothesis incorporates these neglected areas. It suggests selection pressure on male longevity extended the female lifespan; whose adjustment of life history has been constrained by the size of the ovaries – resulting in human females surviving beyond the age at which they can reproduce. With an extension of the post-reproductive female life stage, they could enhance their inclusive fitness by giving kin assistance. This way, with no choice in the timing of fertility termination, females are optimising an essentially bad situation. Frank Marlowe first put forward the patriarch hypothesis. He postulates that if women survive beyond an age at which they can reproduce and men continue spermatogenesis, then old males can benefit greatly if they can copulate with younger females. It is theorised that increased use of tools and weapons compensates for the decline in natural fighting ability with age. This serves to produce a more stable male hierarchy, where attainment of high social status and reproductive access is less reliant on physical strength. With such a scenario older males are able to retain a competitive ability with younger males, thereby asserting a selection pressure on extending longevity in males that could retain social status. Higher ranking males may also be a more attractive mate choice. One mechanism that could extend the lifespan is delaying the age at maturity. Offspring with a slower life history would exhibit a protracted period of dependence. If depletion of oocytes occurs at age 50, females should selectively counter this as it reduces their fecundity. Recruitment of help from kin and husbands may compensate by enabling females to reduce birth intervals by weaning offspring at an earlier age. In addition, by passing on longevity to her sons, a female would stand to gain inclusive fitness. Evidence for The patriarch hypothesis rests on three assumptions: *Older males must reproduce. *:It is clear that older males do reproduce, as the oldest verified paternity is 94 years, 35 years beyond the oldest documented birth attributed to females. *The allele for slowing life history and extending longevity is not on the Y chromosome. *:To date a ‘longevity’ gene(s) is still elusive. However, INK4a/ARF situated on the human chromosome 9p21 does appear to act as a tumour suppressor therefore extending longevity. *Increasing the ovarian follicular reserve is difficult. *:There are few explanations on density restrictive mechanisms other than physical size. NOS3 has been proposed as a candidate gene for the regulation and timing of reproductive functions, such as menopause, although it is unclear why timing has not adjusted with longevity. More importantly there is a lack of understanding why 70–99.9% of mammalian follicles are subjected to atresia. Future analysis of the differential expression of genes of the bcl-2 family may hold the key. Longevity is a central determinant of the grandmother hypothesis; selection for greater longevity in males, as suggested by the patriarch hypothesis, could extend female lifespan, provided such a gene is not on the Y chromosome. Males have much to gain from late reproduction, even if they die shortly after conception.Hudson, M. (2005). Why do females (especially human females) survive beyond an age at which they can reproduce? Sussex University Press. Brighton Females that found their longevity extended, were constrained by the difficulties of increasing their follicular reserves and thus could enhance their inclusive fitness by giving kin assistance.

Dogs Socialized dogs can interact with other non-aggressive dogs of any size and shape and understand how to communicate. The critical period of socialization commences when they are approximately three weeks old and will continue until they are twelve to fourteen weeks old, during which they move to the next stage of development, the juvenile period. This period of socialization is the time when puppies form social bonds, learn to explore and learn when/how to base fear. Additionally, this stage consists of teaching them how to appropriately react and habituate to environmental changes in preparation for adulthood. Habituation is the process when a puppy has gotten used to stimuli in their environment and therefore ignores it, deeming it non-threatening. The puppy's future personality will be greatly influenced during the socialization period. Their temperament and character is developed throughout this period as well, which will last for the duration of their life. During the socialization stage, all five senses are being stimulated by exposure and desensitization of sights, sounds, tastes, smells and touch of things around them. It is critical that human interaction takes place frequently and calmly from the time the puppies are born, from simple, gentle handling to the mere presence of humans in the vicinity of the puppies, performing everyday tasks and activities. As the puppies grow older, socialization occurs more readily the more frequently they are exposed to other dogs, other people, and other situations. Dogs who are well socialized from birth, with both dogs and other species (especially people), are much less likely to be aggressive or to suffer from fear-biting. The cognitional development of puppies can be affected when the critical period of socialization is disrupted. Physiological consequences of this period not occurring can lead to puppies maturing to adults who are not able to react appropriately to new environments, situations or people. Additionally, behavioural issues can arise. Aggression, avoidance and fear are just some of the implications that can arise from a puppy not achieving the critical period of socialization. It is estimated that one in four adult dogs have at least one behavioural problem. Dogs are the animal which is typically the most closely attached to humans, developing tightly wound relationships with people. Therefore, it is crucial for the safety of both parties that there is adequate training in place. Dogs experience socialization through the critical period of socialization in two main types: active and passive. Active implies the intended socialization of humans introducing their puppy to something/someone new (i.e. at obedience class or a ride in the car). However, passive involves socialization of the puppy to something/someone new in which they have done so unintentionally themselves (i.e. insects found in the backyard while exploring or items found while running around the house). Dogs will often learn two ways; by association and consequence. Learning by association is classified as classical conditioning, while learning by consequence is called operant conditioning. With puppy socialization, classical conditioning involves pairing something they love with something within the environment. Additionally, operant conditioning involves the puppy learning to do something to achieve getting what they want. These two learning types can occur simultaneously with a puppy having the ability to learn both an internal and external response to a stimulus. In contrast, a puppy can also demonstrate methods of actively avoiding a situation they do not enjoy. Socialization experiments =Using puppies= The researchers, Fox and Stelzner did a socialization experiment on puppies of the same species. The major finding of this experiment is the fact that the puppies weaned from the mother at a later age (12 weeks) have better socialization skills. This proves that the beginning of a puppy's life is a very important time for socialization and will affect their social tendencies for the rest of their lives. Hennessey, Morris, and Linden conducted a socialization experiment using inmates as handlers of the shelter dogs being studied. These researchers found that the dogs in the experimental group did not jump on and bark at unfamiliar humans as much as the dogs in the control group did. The socialized dogs also showed to be more responsive to commands than did the dogs in the control group. The researchers believe that through more effective socialization, more dogs can be adopted from shelters. Battagalia claims that there are 3 important periods during the first year of life for a puppy. Her research shows that if puppies experience stimulation from humans during the first few months of their lives, they will be less likely to feel stress in their adult lives and they will be better socialized. She claims this is a very important thing for dog breeders to know to improve the success of their puppy's future lives. =Using dog and wolf puppies= A study done by the six researchers, Topál, Gácsi, Miklósi, Zirányi, Kubinyi, and Csányi compares the inherent social tendencies between dog puppies and wolf puppies. What these researchers found was that dog puppies showed attachment to their owners and showed to be more responsive to their owner than an unfamiliar person. The wolf puppies did not show to be more responsive to their owners than to an unfamiliar human. Researchers concluded that this is a genetic difference between species. These six researchers attempted to answer the question, \\"Why?\\" in their next experiment. They found that dogs were more successful in finding hidden food and in completing a learned task than wolves were. The most prominent observation these researchers made was that the dogs would look into the eyes of the human as if looking for a clue and the wolves would not look at the faces of the humans. They concluded that this is a genetic difference between the two species as a result of evolution. Monkeys Monkeys are often studied because of the close evolutionary relationship between monkeys and humans. Like humans, some monkeys tend to show declining social activity with age. Research has shown that older females spent less time grooming other and interacted with fewer animals than younger individuals did. Socialization experiments Bernstein and Ehardt conducted an experiment on aggressive behavior of rhesus monkeys. They found that the monkeys showed more aggression towards kin than non-kin, mostly from older kin to younger kin. This supports the hypothesis that aggression is used in socialization and correction of inappropriate behaviors in the immature monkeys. If the aggression is no more severe than is needed to correct the behavior, it can improve the survival rate of all the relatives. In 1980, Berman researched the mother-infant relationship of rhesus monkeys both in the wild and in captivity. She found many similarities between the two parenting styles but some minor differences. The captive mother has been described as more protective and less willing to let their infant out of their control. The difference that likely has to most effect on this relationship is, the wild monkey has kin around which helps with the socialization of the infant, and the mother in captivity does not. This shows how environmental factors can affect the early socialization of infant rhesus monkeys. Socialization at a young age has been seen to affect sexual behavior in the adult rhesus monkey, in a study done by, Gold, Wallen, and Goldfoot. This is not seen as prominently in rats, and other small animals as it is in primates. The monkeys have difficulty acting normally even when a sexual opportunity presents itself, this is due to the fact that they have affectional disorders that they do not often overcome. It is very difficult to study the lives of isolated children so researchers have turned to studying the effect of total isolation on rhesus monkeys. Completely isolated monkey's first response to stimulus is fear or aggression. They do not learn any normal socio-emotional skills. When these monkeys are able to come in contact with a group, they do not know how to interact and would not be able to survive in a group.

The miniseries is a reimagining of the classic Lewis Carroll novels Alice's Adventures in Wonderland (1865) and Through the Looking-Glass (1871), taking place about 150 years later with science fiction and additional fantasy elements added. The miniseries, produced by Reunion Pictures is three hours long, split into two parts, which premiered on Sunday, December 6, 2009, and Monday, December 7, 2009, respectively. Writer and director Nick Willing previously directed a 1999 adaptation of the books that followed the story more closely; however, Alice is intended to be a modern interpretation, imagining how Wonderland might have evolved over the last 143 years. The mini-series was partially shot in the Kamloops, B.C., Canada area. Plot Alice Hamilton is a judo sensei living with her mother Carol. Her father disappeared when she was ten, and she has spent much of her life looking for him. She invites her new boyfriend Jack Chase to dinner, but is shocked when he gives her a valuable-looking ring as a gift. Jack abruptly leaves, Alice following only to witness Jack being abducted by several men. A man (the White Rabbit) appears and finds out that Alice is in possession of the ring because he hears the click of the mechanical box that contains the ring opening behind her back. He manages to take the box from her, thinking the ring is still in it, but Alice had already quickly taken it out and resealed the box. The White Rabbit runs away and Alice chases him to find out where they had taken Jack, but falls through a giant looking glass and lands in Wonderland, which has evolved over the past 150 years. Mary Heart, the Queen of Hearts rules over Wonderland from the Happy Hearts Casino, where people from Alice's world (\\"Oysters\\") are taken to, sedated and play games in the casino, their positive emotions drained from them and turned into drug- like substances for the people of Wonderland to digest, keeping them under the Queen's control. Alice escapes her own capture, with the ring still in her possession. Identified as an \\"Oyster\\" by the tattoo she gains, Alice is taken to Hatter, a member of the resistance seeking to free the Oysters from the Queen's control. Hatter takes Alice to ask Dodo to help save Jack, but Dodo refuses, until the Hatter reveals the ring Alice wears, which Dodo recognizes as the Stone of Wonderland, able to open the Looking Glass back to the human world. Alice flees when Dodo tries to kill her, Hatter accompanying her to the forest where they escape a jabberwock and meet Charlie, a surviving White Knight, who fled a battle years ago where Wonderland's knights were wiped out by the Queen. The Queen has the White Rabbit executed, and has the Walrus and Carpenter revive Mad March, her favorite assassin to track Alice. Alice deliberately allows Mad March to capture her, so she can negotiate with the Queen to free Jack in return for the ring, which Alice has hidden. Jack appears, revealed as the Queen's son and to already be engaged to the Duchess. However, Jack passes Alice her father's watch, implying he is alive and in Wonderland. Alice is put in the Truth Room, where Tweedledum and Tweedledee interrogate her to learn the ring's location, but she is freed by Hatter and Charlie, the trio escaping back to the forests, whilst Jack also escapes. In hopes of aiding the resistance and returning Alice home, Hatter uses his connections to find someone who can bring them to Caterpillar, leader of the resistance, using the ring as leverage. To their surprise, the agent who arrives is Jack, revealing him as an agent of the resistance who had originally stolen the ring as part of a ploy to initiate a coup to overthrow the queen. Trusting him, Alice retrieves the ring, and accompanies Jack to meet Caterpillar, who reveals that Alice's father is Carpenter, but he has no memory of her. As the Carpenter has been crucial in process for extracting emotions for the Queen, Jack had deliberately approached Alice in hopes that she could help the Carpenter break away from the Queen's control. Just as the Carpenter shows signs of regaining memories, Mad March and his minions arrive, capturing Alice and Jack whilst Caterpillar escapes. Reunited with her ring, the Queen decides to send Alice home and execute Jack. Hatter stages a rescue with Charlie but is captured by Mad March after Charlie loses his courage and flees. Charlie, after feeling guilty for deserting Hatter, uses the skeletons of the extinct White Knights as a distraction to trick the Hearts into believing they are under attack. After being tortured by Dr. Dum and Dee, Hatter kills Mad March and escapes. Alice escapes again, joining up with the Hatter to snap the Oysters out of their sedations and rally them to escape. Carpenter appears, having regained his memories, but is killed by Walrus. The Oysters' unpleasant emotions run high, causing the casino to start collapsing. Alice, Hatter, Jack, the Duchess and the Queen escape but Winston, the loyal King of Hearts willingly perishes knowing his wife never loved him. With her followers no longer listening to or fearing her, the powerless Queen surrenders the Stone of Wonderland to Alice. Alice returns home, learning her experience may have been a dream when she awakens in hospital to find she had been found unconscious an hour after chasing Jack. However, the next day she discovers the \\"construction worker\\" who found her was Hatter. The two share a passionate kiss in front of a looking glass, as Carol stares in shock.

The characters appear as human with features resembling their usual forms. The original Alice is mentioned several times, and multiple characters mistake Alice Hamilton for the same character. The Hatter is presented as a suave character who owns a business that sells the human emotions like drugs, with the Dormouse in his services. He is not only depicted to be the same age as Alice but he falls in love with her. The Ratcatcher character appears to be based on the Mouse from the first book. The Dodo is head of the resistance against the Queen, and is flanked by the gun-wielding Duck and Owl. The Caterpillar is the leader of the resistance, and appears as an aging man wearing spectacles. A fusion of the present-day Alice's pet cat Dinah and the Cheshire Cat appears in a dream Alice has. The Queen of Hearts appears to be a lot calmer and more calculating than the book's version, suggesting that her personality is based on the Red Queen in Through the Looking Glass. The White Rabbit is used as the name for the Queen's organization, but also the character himself appears as a white-haired man named \\"Agent White\\" portrayed by Alan Gray. The March Hare appears as an assassin called Mad March, who speaks with a pronounced Brooklyn accent and has a computerized rabbit cookie jar for a head. The Carpenter is a human in this adaptation, whilst he is a Wonderland resident in the books, alongside The Walrus who is also in a human version. Tweedledum and Tweedledee appear as disturbed psychiatrist-like doctors in the Queen's service. A computer-generated Jabberwock appears in one scene. Reception Alice was the most watched original mini-series on Syfy since Tin Man in 2007 (which rated the highest in their history). Part One jumped 143% in Adults 18–49, 91% among Adults 25–54 and 89% in total viewers versus the 2009 Sunday 9–11PM (ET/PT) time period average, propelling Syfy to #1 in prime among Men 18–49. Part Two rose +223% in Adults 18–49, +159% among Adults 25–54 and +176% in total viewers versus the 2009 Monday 9–11PM (ET/PT) time period average. Overall, Alice delivered 1.3 million Adults 18–49, 1.2 million Adults 25–54 and 2.3 million total viewers along with a 1.7 HH rating. Alice boosted Syfy into the #3 cable entertainment network for both Adults 18–49 and Adults 25–54 in its Sunday and Monday 9–11PM (ET/PT) time period. Reviews of Alice varied greatly, with ratings averaging around a 54, or average, on Metacritic. Paige Wiser of the Chicago Sun-Times gave the show three of five stars, saying that it was \\"charming, but not perfect.\\" Randee Dawn from The Hollywood Reporter also gave the program a mediocre review, and Nancy deWolf Smith of The Wall Street Journal said that \\"despite...diversions and whiz-bang special effects, [Alice] drags at times.\\" Mark A. Perigard of the Boston Herald called Alice \\"fresh and original,\\" lauding the acting and story. TV.com also praised the show, calling it \\"a champion of production that fuses modern invention and nostalgic resourcefulness\\", and David Hinckley of New York Daily News called it \\"just plain wonderful,\\" saying that it was \\"a vehicle to engage the imagination while it amuses and entertains.\\" Steven James Snyder of Techland.com said: \\"There's no denying that Alice has put it all on the line. And even when it comes to those who may not think that the whole thing gels perfectly, Alice's unhinged creativity is bound to at least earn their respect.\\" Rick Bentley at The Fresno Bee said: \\"The result will have you smiling like a Cheshire Cat. Willing creates a world that's Minority Report meets Austin Powers. The real fun is seeing how cleverly Willing has updated the familiar story to make it different from past TV and film versions.\\" However, Tom Shales from The Washington Post' gave the program a very negative review, saying that Tin Man was far superior, while IGN said that Alice was \\"long-winded, uninspiring, and...hardly [did] the original material justice.\\" Robert Bianco from USA Today gave the show an indifferent review, calling it superior to Tin Man but saying the plot was \\"superimposed...with its shifting motives and dreary lectures,\\" ultimately giving it two and a half stars out of four. Blu-ray and DVD Alice was released on DVD and Blu-ray on March 2, 2010. On some region's DVD releases, the miniseries is presented as a continuous film, instead of in two parts.

Description The southern spotted skunk grows to a length of with a tail length of and weighs between . It is conspicuously coloured in black and white and resembles the western spotted skunk in appearance. It has anal glands beneath the tail which secrete musk which can be sprayed with considerable accuracy at a predator. Distribution and habitat The southern spotted skunk is native to Central America where its range includes Mexico, Guatemala, Honduras, El Salvador, Nicaragua, Costa Rica and Belize. It is present at altitudes of up to in dry rocky areas with scrub and open woodland, and also in agricultural areas. Behaviours The southern spotted skunk is nocturnal and secretive in its habits. It climbs trees but mainly searches for food on the ground for the small mammals, insects, birds, eggs, grain and fruit on which it feeds. Status The chief threats faced by the southern spotted skunk are human activities such as road construction, wildfires and agricultural monoculture. Though not very common, it has a large range and is presumed to have a large total population, and it is able to adapt to disturbance to its habitat.

Produced over several years, the album features guest appearances by members of Korn and Faith No More, alongside a backing band dubbed the Vanduls Ugenst Allliderasy. Will Rap Over Hard Rock for Food was released to mixed reviews from critics, who largely considered it outdated. Production Will Rap Over Hard Rock for Food is the début solo album by Chuck Mosley, formerly of the band Faith No More. Mosley collaborated with several artists on the album, including former bandmate Roddy Bottum, Korn frontman Jonathan Davis and Rob Zombie guitarist John 5. Mosley met Davis while Korn were touring as part of the Ozzfest lineup, and shared what he had completed of the album at that point with him. Mosley's backing band for the album were dubbed the Vanduls Ugenst Allliderasy (VUA), and comprised members of other groups, including Cobra Verde guitarist Tim Parnin, and \\"a guy named Eric\\" from Pro-Pain. The album focuses on a mix of rap and rock music, a style which Mosley has been considered to have made popular with the release of Faith No More's We Care a Lot; a reworked version of that album's title track is featured on Will Rap Over Hard Rock for Food. The song \\"Sophie\\", a ballad, is named for Mosley's youngest daughter. Mosley began working on the album in 1997, but experienced delays due to ill health and alleged financial mismanagement from the record label.  Track listing  Personnel *Chuck Mosley: Vocals, guitar *Michael Siefert: Drums, bass, guitar, programming, keyboards *Tim Parnin: Guitar *Michael Cartellone: Drums *Billy Sullivan: Guitars Release and reception Will Rap Over Hard Rock for Food was initially available for pre-order between July 28 and August 10, 2009; pre- order copies were signed by Mosley and included a bonus postcard. The album was later released on August 11, 2009, on the Reversed Image Unlimited record label. Reviewing the album for AllMusic, Phil Freeman awarded it three stars out of five. Freeman felt that Mosley's blending of rap and rock elements \\"was wildly innovative 15 years ago\\" but would struggle to find a contemporary audience. Freeman described the album's music as \\"capable but thoroughly lackluster\\", but picked out \\"We Care a Lot\\" and \\"The Enabler\\" as the highlights of the record. Blabbermouth.net's Keith Bergman rated the album 7.5 out of 10, calling it \\"a weird, diverse, off-kilter, unfashionable stew of influences\\" that sounds unlike Mosley's previous Faith No More albums. Bergman singled out the retread of \\"We Care a Lot\\" as the low point of the album, but felt that overall Mosley's vocal talent had been underrated and worked well across the record.

The rumour of Šmíd's death was spread by Drahomíra Dražská, a porter at a student dormitory in the city's Troja district. The dissident Charter 77 activist Petr Uhl believed her story and passed it along to Radio Free Europe, the BBC and Voice of America, who broadcast it.Sebestyen (2010), Revolution 1989: The Fall of the Soviet Empire, p. 370-371 The news of a student's death shocked many, and the rumour is thought to have contributed to the fall of the Czechoslovak Socialist Republic. The Martin Šmíd in question was allegedly a student of the Faculty of Mathematics and Physics at Charles University. Two students with that name attended the school at the time, both in their second year at the university, but nothing happened to either of them on November 17. One did not attend the student demonstration, and the other left it just before the police attack. After the story spread across the country, the public reaction was one of outrage. The government showed the two Martin Šmíds and interviewed one of them on television, but people did not believe their assertion that the story was fictitious. Massive demonstrations began across the weekend and the government responded by arresting Uhl for \\"spreading false rumours\\". Drahomíra Dražská's actions, and her motivation for them, have never been fully made clear. The most likely explanation is that she invented the story of Šmíd's death,Závěrečná zpráva vyšetřovací komise Federálního shromáždění pro objasnění událostí 17. listopadu 1989, část III. 5) - Desinformace o údajném úmrtí studenta Šmída, [cit. 2009-10-21]. Available online. and Dražská herself has on several occasions corroborated this claim.Drahomíra Dražská: Strůjkyně zprávy o mrtvém Šmídovi promluvila. Available online. Following the Velvet Revolution, a conspiracy theory began to spread that the incident had been a secret police operation. According to journalist Victor Sebestyen, the StB \\"faked the 'death' of Martin Šmíd in order to create a groundswell of popular anger that would remove General Secretary Jakeš and other hardliners, and replace them with Gorbachev-type reformers.\\" Sebestyen maintained that Ludvík Zifčák, a junior StB agent who had infiltrated the student movement, fell down and played dead during the November 17 demonstrations in Wenceslas Square and that Dražská, whom Sebestyen also believed to be an StB agent, then passed on to Uhl the story that \\"Šmíd\\" had been killed. However, an investigation by a committee of the Czechoslovak parliament found no evidence of these claims, and Dražská's involvement with the StB was considered to be highly unlikely. Furthermore, following the events of November 17, Zifčák continued his undercover work, casting doubts on his role as Martin Šmíd since the operation would be compromised had he been recognized.

Description The king threadfin is a large threadfin which can attain a maximum total length of and a maximum published weight of , although the more common total length is . It has a pointed snout and the dorsal profile of the head is almost flat in young fish and concave in adults. There are two separate dorsal fins, the first dorsal fin has 8 spines and the second spine is thicker than others. The second dorsal fin has a single spine and 11 to 13 soft rays. The anal fin has 3 spines and 10 to 12 soft rays, the base of the anal fin base is roughly equal in length to the base of the second dorsal fin base. The pectoral fin has 14 or 15 unbranched rays, and has a length equivalent to roughly a quarter of the standard length with its tip just falling short or just reaching the tip of the pelvic fin. There are 5 pectoral filaments with first filament being the shortest, reaching past the level of origin of the pelvic fin. The second pectoral filament extends to past the tip of the pelvic fin. The third and fifth pectoral filaments extend past the level of the origin of the anal fin. The fourth pectoral filament is the longest, having a length equivalent to 40 to 53% of the standard length and this filament extends far beyond the level of the origin of the anal fin. The caudal fin is deeply forked with neither of its lobes being filamentous. There are 60-76 pored scales on its lateral line which is simple In form and extends from the upper end of the gill slit to the upper end of lower caudal fin lobe. The ppper sides of head and the flanks are tinged golden silver, becoming silvery on the lower flanks. Both dorsal fins are pale brown, the pectoral and pelvic fins are vivid yellow. The front portion of the anal fin is yellow, the remainder being yellowish white. The pectoral filaments are white or yellowish white. The tail is greyish with a greyish black rear margin. Distribution The king threadfin is found in the eastern Indian Ocean and the western Pacific Ocean. It is found in southern New Guinea and northern Australia. In Australia its range extends from Eighty Mile Beach in Western Australia to the Brisbane River in Queensland. In New Guinea its range extends along the southern coast from Western New Guinea, Indonesia, to the Gulf of Papua in Papua New Guinea. Habitat and biology King threadfin occur in shallow, turbid waters such as coastal waters, estuaries, mangrove creeks, and mangrove-lined rivers, over sandbanks and mud substrates. It normally aggregates into loose schools, however, the larger individuals are more frequently recorded as pairs or as individuals. This is a carnivorous species which feeds on prawns and fish. It is a protandrous hermaphrodite and fish between fork lengths of appear to be transitional hermaphrodites in that they have mature male and immature female reproductive organs, and they function reproductively as males. King threadfins in the process of transitioning are most frequently recorded from June to September. The females spawn pelagic eggs but little is known about the larvae although the nursery areas are inshore, shallow and of low salinity. Fisheries The king threadfin is one of the most important species in the fisheries in the Northern Territory, Queensland and Western Australia and it is caught mostly using coastal set gillnets, and also using fixed tidal traps, beach seines, ring nets and handlines. The fishery in the southern part of the Gulf of Carpentaria is dominated by males in the age range 3-6 years old. In the Gulf of Carpentaria between 1980 and 1987 the gillnet fishery landings of this species equalled an average 30% by weight of total landings. It is a popular sport fishing quarry too and in Queensland and Western Australia there are minimum sizes which can be taken and a bag limit. Species description Polydactylus macrochir was first formally described as Polynemus macrochir in 1867 by Albert Günther who gave the type locality as New South Wales, thought to be an error for Queensland.

Biography Beginnings Romus was born in Hancock, Michigan. He began playing piano at the age of five until he was thirteen when he decided to play the alto saxophone, which his mother also played. In 1982 and 1984, Romus attended the Stanford Jazz Workshop summer programs where he participated in master classes led by Stan Getz, Bruce Forman, Eddie Moore, and Dizzy Gillespie. Romus’s exposure to Stan Getz was a pivotal moment in his early development where Getz would ask him to find a mirror and work on his tone watching his embouchure as he played. His pivotal experience with the tenor saxophonist was when Getz picked up his horn and joined him in a rendition of the song \\"I’ll Remember April\\" during a master class.2009 Podcast “Taran’s Free Jazz Hour Radio” radio interview of Rent Romus' early life aired Monday June 1, 2009 in Angers France at www.taransfreejazzhour.com When Romus was sixteen years of age, his first experience in curation was hoisted upon him after his high school teacher Dick Goodrich quit his job leaving him in charge of a 17-piece big band called the North Area Youth Jazz Ensemble (NAYJE).[ “All Music Guide”] by Greg Prato From 1987 - 1991 he attended the University of California at Santa Cruz. While at college he led the band Jazz on the Line which he had founded alongside saxophonist/composer Michael Sidney Timpson in 1984, that served as a vehicle for the members' compositions and performances. Nineties Between 1989 and 1994 Romus produced three albums with Jazz on the Line including In the Moment with tenor saxophonist Chico Freeman. Other performing members during the group’s history included saxophonist Dan Magay, pianist Stephano DeZerega, trumpeter Jason Olaine, vocalist Anna Gurski, and drummer Ben Leinbach. Other guest artists included drummer Steve Rossi, bassists Ravi Abcarian, Corin Stiggall, and Ernie Provenchure. After graduating from the University of California in Santa Cruz in 1992, Romus worked odd jobs before moving to San Francisco in 1993 where he formed a trio with drummer James Zitro and former Sun Ra Arkestra cellist Kash Killion, originally called the RKZtet and later dubbed the Lords of Outland. In 1995 Romus changed personnel of the group to include his longtime associate Jason Olaine along with drummer Andrew Borger and bassist Vytas Nagisetty (aka Brock Lee). That same year he recorded the first Lords of Outland album entitled You'll Never Be the Same.\\"Gettelman, Parry (February 21, 1997).\\" \\"Rent Romus & the Lords of Outland\\" Orlando Sentinel, p. 10.[ “CD Review by Scott Yanow”], Rent Romus’ Lords of Outland, ‘’You’ll Never Be the Same’’, 1996 In the summer of 1995 and 1996 Romus toured in Denmark with pianist Jonas Müller, drummer Tomas Barfod, drummer Stefan Pasborg which later lead to his 1999 recording with Pasborg and bassist Jonas Westergaard as the Life's Blood Trio.“CD Review by Ken Waxman” www.jazzweekly.com In 1997 Romus performed and recorded with Jon Birdsong, Dave Mihaly, and guest tenor saxophonist John Tchicai known best for his work with John Coltrane and Albert Ayler in the 1960s. In 1998 Romus worked with instrument inventor Tom Nunn, cellist Doug Carroll, guitarist Joel Harrison and drummer Dave Mihaly. This formation focused on a set of compositions inspired by the writings of author Philip K. Dick.“CD Review by Nils Jacobson” PKD Vortex Project, 2002 New millennium In 2001 Romus reinvented the Lords of Outland with bassist Bill Noertker, drummer Dave Mihaly and the late trombonist Toyoji Tomita,“Toyoji Tomita obituary” 1951 - 2008 Born in Berkeley, CA; Died unexpectedly on April 17 at home and later that year recorded Avatar In the Field a tribute to the late saxophonist Albert Ayler . In 2002 Romus began working with poet/musician/artist CJ Borosque whom he later married. Together they produced The Metal Quan Yin[ \\"CD Review of Metal Quan Yin\\"] All Music Guide, Steven Loewy, 2002 (destinations suite) with an expanded group that included vocalist Jesse Quattro and Andre Custodio, based on her self-published book of the same name. That same year also marked a shift in Romus’ musical exploration branching out into complete free improvisation when he alongside guitarist Ernesto Diaz-Infante created The Abstractions,“CD Review of The Abstractions Aural Innovations” October 2002 a collective ensemble that ranged in size from two to ten players. The group toured the west coast of the United States in 2002 and 2004 and released three recordings and included Jesse Quattro, Scott R Looney, Bob Marsh, Philip Everett, Sandor Finta, CJ Borosque, Ray Schaeffer, Lance Grabmiller, Alwyn Quebido, and Dina Emerson. In 2006 Romus toured through the midwest of the United States performing in St. Louis Missouri, Urbana Illinois, Detroit Michigan, and Columbus Ohio with stops along the east coast to Philadelphia and New York City with composer and pianist Thollem McDonas and drummer Jon Brumit as the Bloom Project. In contrast to the Lords of Outland, Bloom Project featured a more sparse melodic repertoire.\\"CD Review from KZSU Stanford University Radio\\" KZSU Radio, Stanford CA, by Wedge, Reviewed 2009-05-08 During that same year Romus shifted the roster of the current Lords of Outland with drummer Philip Everett, bassist Ray Schaeffer, and CJ Borosque on no-input effects pedals mixing harsh noise and free improvisation and producing recordings to present day. Curator, producer From his first experience as a young music producer in 1984 with the North Area Youth Jazz Ensemble (NAYJE), Romus continued to produce and curate performances and presentations in the San Francisco Bay Area. Romus runs Edgetone Records, launched in 1991 originally as a vanity label to support his recordings, and later in 2001 began releasing other artists primarily from the San Francisco Bay Area crossing many forms of improvised and experimental music. He was the Executive Director of Jazz in Flight from 1996-1997 a non-profit jazz presenting organization based in Oakland California until it disbanded in 2001, which booked creative touring and local performing musicians at Yoshi's (jazz club) in Oakland California.

Style of music AfroFlow literally means \\"flowing from Africa\\". It recognizes where the music comes from and was also named out of respect for Fela Anikulapo-Kuti, who created a style of music called afrobeat. AfroFlow is, \\"the root of hip-hop, R&B;, soul and gospel music.\\" They incorporate all these styles into their music. Performances During performances, AfroFlow is known for pulling people on stage from the audience. They believe that entertaining should be interactive and the crowd is a vital part of every performance. They have even brought audience member who are currently smoking up on stage to quit right on the spot.  Acting  Mike-E also has 13 acting credits to his name, including small parts in \\"The Butterfly Effect 3: Revelations,\\" \\"The Ides of March\\" and \\"Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice.\\" He also modeled Pelle Pelle clothing for an international print campaign. Partnership with American Cancer Society It all started when Mike-E was asked to perform at an American Cancer Society conference for the South- Atlantic Division. Here, he did a combination of hip-hop and spoken word to entertain and educate and to create awareness about cancer and the effects of tobacco use. The American Cancer Society realized the great partnership that could be formed to help spread the message. From that point, Mike-E traveled to hospitals, cafes, middle schools, along with a variety of other locations before they decided to take it national. Mike-E wrote poems about the tobacco industry long before his partnership with ACS. He states, \\"I believe that tobacco companies are knowingly engaging in legalized genocide.\\" AfroFlow has committed their entire work to educating others about the harmful effects of tobacco use and educating other on how to stay healthy. In 2008, AfroFlow performed at the Great Lakes Regional Summit. It was here, with the help of others, that they were inspired to create a Fight Back song. The song includes the three main elements of Relay for Life: Celebrate. Remember. Fight Back.

Family and education Gibbins was born in Neath, the eldest son of F J Gibbins, a local Justice of the Peace. He was educated privately but also attended the Quaker School in Scarborough. In 1898 he married Sarah Jennet Rhys, the daughter of Jenkin Rhys of Ysguborfawr, Breconshire. They had two sons.Who was Who, OUP 2009 In religion Gibbins was a devout member of the Society of Friends.Marcus Tanner, The Last of the Celts; Yale University Press, 2004 p208 Career Gibbins main business concern was tinplate manufacturing. He entered the tinplate trade in 1880 and was assistant manager at the Ynispenllwch works in 1884. In 1890 he erected and managed the Eagle Tinplate works at Melyn in Neath.W E Minchington, Industrial South Wales 1750-1914: Essays in Welsh Economic History; Routledge Library Editions, 2009 p112 He was regarded as a model employer in his industry. He provided his workers with a canteen, a lending library as well as other recreational facilities. He was also looked upon as fair-minded and was often asked to act as an arbitrator in trades disputes. He was one of the founders of the Welsh Plate and Sheet Manufacturers' Association and was its chairman from 1910 to 1922. In the years after the First World War however small, independent, tinplate makers faced difficult economic conditions and, like others in the trade, Gibbins withdrew from production.Minchington, Industrial South Wales; p113 After 31 years in the business he sold out to Baldwin Ltd in 1921 making well over £100,000.Gregory P Marchildon, Mergers and Acquisitions; Edward Elgar Publishing Ltd, 1991 p96 He went on to develop interests in the insurance industry, becoming a director of the London and Scottish Assurance Corporation and he was sometime chairman of the Welsh Insurance Corporation. Politics In 1910 the sitting Liberal MP for the constituency of Mid Glamorganshire, Samuel Thomas Evans resigned his seat to take up the post of President of the Probate, Divorce and Admiralty Division of the High Court of Justice. This resulted in a by-election and the Mid Glamorgan Liberal and Labour Association selected Gibbins to fight the seat. Gibbins was initially reluctant having given certain private assurances that he would not contest the election but he was prevailed upon to change his mind and having consulted his close friends (and perhaps getting the permission of his wife), he agreed to stand.Mid Glamorgan Herald and Neath Gazette, 19 March 1910 The by-election was acrimonious because it signalled a rupture between the Liberals and organised Labour in the area, especially the South Wales Miners Federation. It also caused internal conflicts within the South Wales Miners Federation, with William Brace, their Vice-President, opposing the intervention of a Labour candidate.The miners and British politics 1906-1914 by Roy Gregory It also caused internal conflicts for the Liberal Party as the local Association had been put under pressure by the Liberal Chief Whip, the Master of Elibank. Elibank wanted the Liberals to stand aside in favour of a Labour candidate in the interests of good relations with Labour at Westminster where the Liberal government now depended on Labour and the Irish Nationalists.K O Morgan, Wales in British Politics, 1868-1922; University of Wales Press, 1963 p251 However, the Liberals in Mid Glamorgan did not wish to yield the seat and determined to fight it. With tacit Unionist support given to him in a campaign characterised by anti-socialist rhetoric, Gibbins held the seat for the Liberals with a majority of 2,710 against a strong Labour challenge from Vernon Hartshorn a prominent miners’ official who later sat as Labour MP for Ogmore.The Times, 2 April 1910 p15 However, in the words of historian Brinley Richards, \\"the hurly-burly of Parliamentary life was not to [Gibbins’] liking.\\"Brinley Richards, History of the Llynfi Valley; 1982, D Brown & sons, p198 He served as MP only a few months, standing down at the general election in December 1910. Thereafter he concentrated on business, industrial relations and philanthropy. Other appointments Gibbins was typical of the late Victorian and Edwardian Liberal political class. He served on committees, commercial and philanthropic. He was appointed a Justice of the Peace for the county of Glamorgan. He was an ardent upholder of hospital work and a vice-president of the Welsh National Memorial Association. He served as High Sheriff of Glamorgan for 1908. In 1911 the Board of Trade set up an Industrial Council to act as a National Conciliation Council in relation to labour and trade disputes. Gibbins was appointed to sit on the Council as one of the employers’ representatives.John Henry Greenwood, Law Relating to Trade Unions, Stevens, 1911 republished in A Handbook of Industrial Law: A Practical Guide for Trade Union Officers and Others; BiblioLife, 2009 p69 In 1916 Gibbins was appointed a member of the Appeal Tribunal for Glamorgan under the Military Service Act 1916 which introduced conscription.http://www.gazettes- online.co.uk/issues/29506/pages/2783/page.pdf Under the Act those liable to be called up were entitled to apply to a local (borough or district) tribunal for exemption on grounds of conscientious objection, domestic hardship or that they were key workers in industry; if dissatisfied with the result, they could appeal to the county tribunal. One factor in Gibbins' appointment may have been his Quaker upbringing, as he would have had knowledge of religious objection. Death In 1922, Gibbins went to live at Cwm Irfon Lodge, Llanwrtyd Wells. He later moved again to Glynsaer, Llandovery where he died on 30 July 1937 aged 76. He was buried at Cynghordy, near Llandovery.

For many years he taught the youth how to swim in Inks Lake before creating his summer camp. In 1963, he brought the first public swimming pool to Burnet. For thirty years that swimming pool hosted Burnet's small high school state championships. In 1968, the girls' high school and college state championships were hosted there. He also invented the Blob, a highly used toy in all water based summer camps.  Camp Longhorn  Robertson founded Camp Longhorn with his wife Pat in 1939 on Inks Lake in Burnet, Texas. The camp's main purpose was to teach children the importance of swimming and encouraged children to make swimming an active role in their lifestyle. He shut the camp down for three years when World War II broke out so he could join the United States Navy, where he trained Underwater Demolition Teams and survival swimming skills. He was stationed in San Diego and then transferred to Fort Pierce, FL where he taught the Underwater Demolition Teams. Tex never quit coaching and led the Navy Swim Team to the National Navy Championships. When he returned, he spent all his time coaching the Texas swimming team and running Camp Longhorn, using his swim athletes as counselors. Many popular camp objects were inspired from World War II including a Vietnam-era, 40-foot long gasoline storage tank that was inflated and children jumped onto it while another flew off, along with ice cream lids children threw back and forth eventually becoming the Frisbee. Vic Malfronte, the World Frisbee champion, gives credit to Tex for creating the earliest organized sailing disc games. Tex grew up throwing metal can lids with neighborhood friends, and then introduced the game of throwing the \\"Sa-Lo\\" when he was a camper at Camp Wolverine in Michigan which is considered the birthplace of organized Frisbee. Robertson then introduced the Frisbee to his camp in 1939. Retiring in 1950 as the UT swim coach, Robertson now focused entirely on the camp with his wife Pat. The first year Camp Longhorn opened it only had one camper and sixteen counselors all swimmers from the University of Texas. Today, the camp has spread into three different branches two located on Inks Lake and the other, which opened in 1975, on Indian Springs, the lake next door. Inks Lake is fed off the Colorado River and Indian Springs is fed off of two private spring-fed lakes, both are located in the Hill Country. Tex came up with the term and famous slogan, \\"Attawaytogo\\" in 1939 to help campers encourage one another and realize that they are \\"somebody\\" at Camp Longhorn. The welcoming camp uses the term \\"Everybody is Somebody!\\" because Longhorn prides itself in the way each camper acts putting everything and everybody before themselves. Longhorn teaches all campers to love Camp and to be a friend and have friends. Robertson continued to run the camp until he died at age 98 and passed the camp down to his five children: Nan, Sally, Robby, Bill, and John. Pat Robertson visited both during the camp sessions after Tex died until she passed away in 2015. Today, Camp Longhorn hosts over 4000 campers every summer and the camp had their 75th anniversary in the summer of 2014.

As a home tutor, she devised a set of influential principles of education. Biography and writings Elizabeth Missing Sewell was born at High Street, Newport, Isle of Wight, on 19 February 1815, was third daughter in a family of seven sons and five daughters of Thomas Sewell (1775–1842), solicitor, of Newport, and his wife Jane Edwards (1773–1848). She was sister of Henry Sewell, the first premier of New Zealand, of James Edwards Sewell, warden of New College, Oxford, of Richard Clarke Sewell, reader in law to the University of Melbourne and the author of a large number of legal works, and of William Sewell, clergyman and author. Elizabeth was educated first at Miss Crooke's school at Newport, and afterwards at the Misses Aldridge's school, Bath. At the age of fifteen she went home, and joined her sister Ellen, two years her senior, in teaching her younger sisters.. About 1840 her brother William introduced her to some of the leaders of the Oxford Movement, including Keble, Newman and Henry Wilberforce. Influenced by the religious stir of the period, she published in 1840, in The Cottage Monthly, Stories illustrative of the Lord's Prayer, which appeared in book form in 1843. Like all her early works, these stories were represented as having been edited by her brother William. The family experienced money difficulties through the failure of two local banks, and the father died in 1842 deep in debt. Elizabeth and the other children undertook to pay off the creditors, and set aside a certain sum each year from her literary earnings, until all was repaid. Until 1844 the family lived at Pidford Manor or Ventnor, but in that year Mrs Sewell and her daughters settled at Sea View, Bonchurch. Elizabeth bought the house, enlarged it in 1854, and later changed its name to Ashcliff. At Bonchurch, she met William Adams, another High Church author of religious works. In 1844, Elizabeth Sewell published Amy Herbert, a tale for girls, embodying Anglican views. It was many times reprinted and enjoyed success both in England and in America. In 1846 there came two of the three parts of Laneton Parsonage, a tale for children on practical use of a portion of the Church Catechism. She interrupted her work on this to publish Margaret Perceval (1847), in which at the suggestion of her brother William she urged the claims of the Church of England on young people, in view of the current secessions to Rome. The third part of Laneton Parsonage ensued in 1848. Her mother died in 1847. In 1849 Miss Sewell journeyed to the Lake District with her Bonchurch neighbours Captain and Lady Jane Swinburne and their son Algernon, the poet, then a boy of twelve. They visited Wordsworth at Rydal Mount. In 1852 she published The Experience of Life, a novel based largely on her own observations. It has been seen as her most notable literary production. Elizabeth Sewell had now taken on the financial affairs of the family. Finding that her writing did not earn them enough, she and her sister Ellen (1813–1905) decided to take pupils at their house in Bonchurch, Isle of White. They never saw their venture as a school, but as a \\"family home\\", which they conducted till 1891. They began with six girls, including their nieces. Seven was the customary number. She defined her methods of education in her Principles of Education, drawn from Nature and Revelation, and applied to Female Education in the Upper Classes (1865). Good accounts of the life at Ashcliff appear in Miss Whitehead's Recollections of Miss Elizabeth Sewell and her Sisters (1910) and in Mrs Hugh Fraser's A Diplomatist's Life in Many Lands (1910); both writers had been pupils. Miss Sewell defied the demands of examinations, making her pupils read widely and take an interest in the issues of the day. She herself gave lessons in general history. The holidays were often passed abroad: in 1860 she spent five months in Italy and Germany, which led to a volume entitled Impressions of Rome, Florence, and Turin (1862). She was in Germany again at the outbreak of the Franco-Prussian War. Among those she met on visits to London and Oxford were Charlotte Mary Yonge, Dean Stanley, and Robert Browning. She had made Tennyson's acquaintance in the Isle of Wight in 1857. In 1866, convinced that middle-class girls needed a better education, she founded at Ventnor St Boniface School, which gained a building of its own and became known as St Boniface Diocesan School. Its many years of prosperity was gradually curbed by the high schools that came into being in 1872. The death of her sister Emma in 1897 caused her deep depression and her mind became gradually clouded. She died at Ashcliff, Bonchurch on 17 August 1906 and was buried in the churchyard there. A prayer desk in her memory was put up in the church by pupils and friends. It has a tablet commemorating her and her two sisters. According to the Dictionary of National Biography, Elizabeth Sewell's influence over young people was helped by a dry humour. Despite firm Anglican convictions, she won the ear of those of other views. She was an accomplished letter writer. Beside works already mentioned, Miss Sewell wrote seven tales published between 1847 and 1868, of which Ursula (1858) stands out, and many devotional works, such as Passing Thoughts on Religion (1860), and schoolbooks. Her Thoughts for Holy Week (1857) and Preparation for the Holy Communion (1864) were often reprinted, as late as 1907 and 1910 respectively. Her schoolbooks deal chiefly with history. Two volumes of Historical Selections (1868) were written in collaboration with the novelist Charlotte Yonge. Yonge was additionally the founding editor of The Monthly Packet, to which Sewell contributed. References External links Elizabeth Missing Sewell, Eleanor L. Sewell, The Autobiography of Elizabeth M.

The house was named in honor of famed politician Robert McClelland, who owned the house from 1841–1853. Today, the house is also part of the larger East Elm-North Macomb Street Historic District and is located in its original location just east of North Monroe Street (M-125) and across East Elm Avenue from the River Raisin in one of the oldest sections of Monroe. History The property on which this house sites was first platted in 1836. It was sold to Robert McClelland in about 1841, then mayor of Monroe. (note: large pdf file) The house was built in 1841 for McClelland. McClelland was a very well known local and state politician and eventually rose to national politics. He left Monroe to serve in the United States House of Representatives, representing Michigan's 1st congressional district from 1843–1849. McClelland maintained ownership of the house even after he was elected Governor of Michigan in 1852. It was from this position that he was selected by President Franklin Pierce to be his Secretary of the Interior in 1853. At that point, McClelland sold his house to local merchant Benjamin Dansard. The entire western portion of the house, which contains a library, bedroom, kitchen, and dining room, was not part of the original house and was later added by Dansard. Dansard died in 1888, but the house remained in the family until 1917, when it was sold to Kirke G. Bumpus. Today, the house is privately owned.

She is married to Gerald Rosenberg; they have two sons, Clifford and Nicholas, a daughter-in-law, Kim, and one grandson, Henry. She lives in New York City. E.E.O.C. vs Sears, Roebuck In 1985, Rosenberg testified as an expert witness in a highly-publicized case in which the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) had charged Sears Roebuck and Company with discrimination against their women employees. Rosenberg testified that the underrepresentation of women in Sears' sales force was \\"consistent with an absence of discrimination\\", due to differences in the career aspirations of men and women and other factors not attributable solely to Sears' business practices. In deciding the case in Sears' favor, Judge John A. Nordberg noted that Rosenberg's testimony helped him determine his verdict. This touched off a lengthy public debate that virtually isolated Professor Rosenberg from fellow feminists and historians, who accused her of turning her scholarship against the women's movement, with College of Staten Island professor Sandi Cooper terming Rosenberg's testimony an \\"immoral act\\" and fellow witness. Hofstra University professor Alice Kessler-Harris stating that: \\"You would not lie in your testimony, but you also would not say or write something as a historian solely to hurt a group of people. And the consequences of Rosalind's testimony can be interpreted that way.\\" Within short order, numerous publications such as Radical History Review, New Directions for Women, The Chronicle of Higher Education and The Nation analyzed the case, and most were critical of Rosenberg's participation. Rosenberg acknowledged that she was seen by many as \\"a kind of traitor to the cause\\", but justified her decision to testify with the statement: \\"Scholars must not subordinate their scholarship to their politics,even if their scholarship appears to be heading in a politically dangerous direction. If the scholars allow their politics to drive their scholarship, they will be left with bad scholarship and misguided public policy.\\" She was supported by fellow history professor Carl Degler of Stanford University, who had previously declined to testify in the case, but who later called that decision \\"cowardly\\" and wrote: \\"Rosalind did the right thing. She agreed to look into an issue, she examined it and she testified. History is a discipline in which we try to uncover the truth as we understand it.

As of year-end 2004, 70 quantitative products that had an established track record by Casey, Quirk & Associates managed $157 billion, nearly double the assets from three years earlier when they stood at about $88 billion. By comparison, the assets in non-quant products increased to $925 billion from $720 billion, a 28 percent increase.

Quantitative investment process A study of Fabozzi, Focardi and Jonas （2008）Challenges in Quantitative Equity Management, Frank J. Fabozzi, Sergio M. Focardi and Caroline Jonas, 2008 firstly identified an investment process as \\"fundamental\\" or \\"quantitative\\" by the way asset managers making investment decisions. If the whole procedure is done by human judgment or intuition, an investment process will be labeled as a \\"fundamental\\" one; and only if it is purely done by computer-based models, the process can be classified as \\"quantitative\\". There is also tradeoff between these two approaches, which they define it as a hybrid one if the money manager combines both ways. Quantitative mutual fund versus hedged quant fund Another concept that might make people confused is that quantitative funds can be operated as a hedge fund as well as a normal one. As a manager of a hedge fund whose job is to earn absolute return, one can employ varieties of strategies such as market neutral, statistical arbitrage, or high-frequency trading strategies to enhance the return of one's portfolio, and also high leverages, since there are little constraints in operating hedge fund. But as a quant- mutual fund, an asset manager delivers alpha by stock screening and disciplined risk managements. Operating a quantitative fund For quantitative funds we are considering now, the investment process breaks down into three key parts: *Input system. Providing all necessary inputs such as data and rules; *Forecasting engine. Generating estimations for prices, returns and also, risk parameters; *Portfolio construction engine.

The participants in the conflict were the Pequot and the English with their allied tribes (the Mohegan and Narragansett). The Fairfield Swamp Fight occurred July 13–14, 1637 in what is present-day Fairfield, Connecticut. The town of Fairfield was founded after the battle in 1639. Before the battle The English (and their Narragansett and Mohegan allies) drove the Pequot from their homes in the wake of the Mystic massacre in May 1637. Fleeing westward along the Connecticut coastline, the Pequot arrived in Sasqua Village, present-day Fairfield, where they sought refuge with the Sasquas Indians, a tribe of some 200 members.Fairfield Museum and Research Center. \\"The Great Swamp Fight.\\" The Hartford General Court dispatched Captain Israel Stoughton and his troops numbering some 120 soldiers to southern Connecticut, with the goal of ending the Pequot War and the capture of Sassacus, the Pequot chief sachem. As they moved westward, the English encountered stragglers from the band of Pequots and obtained intelligence about the whereabouts of Sassacus and his fellow tribesmen.Chet. Conquering the American Wilderness, 36. As the English forces approached Sasqua Village, several Pequot on a hill just beyond the English revealed their position. Recognizing this, they attempted to flee. The English followed them to investigate. The compromised Pequots rushed up the hill, the English following. The Pequot sought refuge in a swamp, later named Sadque, and the English continued to search the abandoned village and encircle the swamp the Pequots had sought refuge in. Lieutenant Davenport attempted to force his way through, but a volley of arrows prevented his success.Cave, The Pequot War, 160. The battle Among the participants in the battle were Captain John Mason, the man responsible for the massacre at Mystic, and Roger Ludlow, a statesman from Wethersfield. The combined English forces surrounded the swamp, firing rounds into the thickets. These acts were meant to force the Pequot into negotiations for the release of non-combatants. Day 1 – July 13th The English surrounded the Pequot warriors at a distance of roughly four yards apart from one another. Thomas Stanton, \\"a man well acquainted with Indian language and manners\\", was sent into the swamp to talk to the Indians. Stanton was able to negotiate a settlement with Sassacus for the release of some 180 elderly men, women and children who would surrender to the English.Mason, History of the Pequot War, 16. In addition to the Pequot non-combatants that were released, the Pequot hosts, the 200 Sasquas Indians were released as well. Roughly 100 Pequot warriors remained with Sassacus in the swamp. The remaining warriors refused to surrender. The fighting resumed and continued through the night. The English entered the swamp and systematically shot down the Pequot warriors, some of whom were later found drowned in the bottom of the swamp. The Pequot warriors held their location through the night until the fog rolled in the following morning. Day 2 – July 14th The English soldiers, Captain Patrick's forces specifically, had the clear advantage with their use of \\"small shot\\" during the engagement.Mason, History of the Pequot War, 17. The small shot was essentially multiple musket bullets fired at a single time.Chet, Conquering the American Wilderness, 35. This was disabling to the Pequot forces. Initially, the Pequot warriors took advantage of the English and their slow advance. Sassacus and his warriors were able to exploit a weak point in Patrick’s perimeter. The Pequot at this point attempted to break the English perimeter on the offensive. This ability to break through the English perimeter led to Sassacus’ escape to the Mohawk territories of New York.Chet, Conquering the American Wilderness, 139. The casualties among the colonists were few. John Winthrop was quoted saying, \\"[the Pequot] coming up behind the bushes very near our men... shot many arrows into their hats, sleeves and stocks, yet (which was a very miracle) not one of ours was wounded.\\" Mason's account supported this, saying that \\"several were found slain,\\" a reference to them being injured. The aftermath Fairfield Swamp Fight Monument Most, if not all, of the Pequot warriors were killed during the engagement. The 180 Pequot non-combatants were taken captive and dispersed among the English and their allies.Mason, History of the Pequot War, 18. Many of the slaves taken prisoner did not remain in captivity for long because of their inability to adapt to their roles in servitude. Some of those captured were shipped off to the West Indies into the slave trade.Deforest, History of Indians in Connecticut, 149. The soldiers took Pequot wampum, some kettles and other items as spoils. In the ensuing weeks after the battle, the Mohawk Indians of New York tracked down Sassacus and the Pequot warriors accompanying him. The Mohawk murdered Sassacus, sending his head to Hartford as evidence of his capture.Katz, Pequot War Reconsidered, 219. On September 21, 1638, the Treaty of Hartford formally ended the war and eliminated the Pequot political and cultural identity. The survivors were not allowed to live on tribal lands, and any geographic locations bearing the name of the Pequot were changed. Among these were the Pequot River, renamed the Thames, and Pequot Village, which was renamed New London.Katz, Pequot War Reconsidered, 220. Roger Ludlow, one of the soldiers in the forces that fought the Pequot at the swamp fight, later petitioned the General Court to found a settlement on the same location and the surrounding lands. Being \\"charmed with the landscape,\\" under his leadership, the plantation of Uncos was founded in 1639, later becoming the town of Fairfield.Child, Fairfield: Ancient and Modern, 16. Battlefield preservation efforts The Mashantucket Pequot Museum filed an application with the National Park Service American Battlefield Protection Program in January 2007 to develop a phased plan to research, protect, and preserve the sites involved in the Pequot War. Among these sites was the Fairfield Swamp area. Kevin McBride, an archaeologist and professor from the research center at the University of Connecticut, is leading the program.McBride, Battle of Mystic Fort Documentation, 4. Researchers from the Mashantucket Pequot Museum and Research Center were able to determine study and core areas from narrative accounts (those of Philip Vincent, John Mason, William Hubbard, Increase Mather and the John Winthrop Papers) as well as the Connecticut Colonial Records, local deeds and other records. Using non-invasive techniques, including the use of metal detectors, researchers were able to mark spots of interest to determine the origin of the artifacts.McBride, Battle of Mystic Fort Documentation, 52. Much of the original swamp and surrounding areas have been impacted substantially through residential and commercial development. The construction of Interstate 95 resulted in the filling of approximately half of the entire swamp. As a result of this, many of the archaeological artifacts are thought to be lost.McBride, Battle of Mystic Fort Documentation, 56. Among the goals of the preservation efforts, the researchers hoped to find an exact location for the Pequot Swamp and the areas surrounding it. Once that land was found, they hoped to secure permission from local landowners to further survey the land. Among the initial findings of the report was new information about Pequot armaments. The armaments held by the Pequot are beginning to be reconsidered and among them are thought to be firearms and \\"Mohawk Hammers.\\"McBride, Pequot Swamp Fight Battlefield, 21.

Initially a vassal of the Serbian Empire, it became an independent lordship after 1355, although de facto under Venetian influence, and remained as such until it was conquered by the Ottoman Turks in 1417.  History  The strategically important city of Valona, on the coast of modern Albania, had been fought over repeatedly between the Byzantines and various Italian powers in the 13th century. Finally conquered by Byzantium in ca. 1290, it was one of the chief imperial holdings in the Balkans.Miller (1921), pp. 432–434 Byzantine rule lasted until the 1340s, when the Serbian ruler Stefan Dušan, taking advantage of a Byzantine civil war, took Albania. Valona fell in late 1345 or early 1346, and Dušan placed his brother-in-law, John Asen, brother of the Bulgarian Tsar Ivan Alexander, in charge of Valona as his capital, and with Kanina and Berat as his main fortresses. According to some scholars, however, Dušan had captured Valona and Kanina already in 1337. The extent of John's authority over this territory is unclear; it is not known whether he was limited to the rule of these fortified cities, or whether his authority was more extensive, with the various local chieftains of central Albania reporting to him as a representative of Dušan.Fine (1994), pp. 320, 347, 357 John was granted the rank of Despot by Dušan, and went on to solidify his control over his new territory by portraying himself as the heir to the Despots of Epirus. To that end, he married Anna Palaiologina, the widow of Despot John II Orsini, adopted the trappings of the Byzantine court, took on the surname \\"Komnenos\\" that was traditionally borne by the Epirote rulers, and signed his documents in Greek.Fine (1994), pp. 320, 347 After Dušan's death in 1355, John established himself as an independent lord. He maintained close relations with Venice (whose citizen he became) and with Simeon Uroš, ruler of Epirus in the south. Under his rule, Valona prospered through trade with Venice and the Republic of Ragusa (mod. Dubrovnik). John died in 1363 from the plague, and was succeeded by Alexander, possibly his son, who ruled until ca. 1368. He continued his father's policies, maintaining close ties with Ragusa, whose citizenship he acquired.Soulis (1984), pp. 137–138Miller (1921), pp. 434–435 In 1372, John's unnamed daughter was married to Balša II of the Serbian Balšić noble family, who received Valona, Kanina, Berat and Himara as a dowry. Many of Valona's citizens fled to the island of Saseno and asked for Venetian protection.Fine (1994), pp. 372, 383 Balša continued to expand his territory in the western Balkans, inheriting Zeta in 1378 and conquering Dyrrhachium from Karl Topia soon after, whereupon he assumed the title \\"Duke of Albania\\", probably after the former Venetian province of the same name. Thopia called on the Ottomans for help however, and Balša was killed in the Battle of Savra near Berat in 1385. His widow Komnina recovered control of her patrimonial territory, and ruled it thereafter jointly with her daughter Ruđina. Berat however had already fallen to the Muzaka, and their lordship was now confined to the area around Valona, with Kanina, Himara and the fort of Pyrgos.Fine (1994), pp. 390–391 Map of the Balkans 1345-1541 The principality was now faced with the ever-increasing Ottoman threat; in 1386, Balša's widow offered to cede Valona to Venice in exchange for aid, but the Republic refused, since Valona alone without her hinterland was indefensible. Following the decisive Ottoman victory at the Battle of Kosovo in 1389, the situation became yet more precarious. A similar offer in 1393 was also rejected by a Venice anxious not to antagonize the Ottomans, but another, more comprehensive proposal, followed two years later. Through the bishop of Albania, the widow offered to the handover of the entire principality in exchange for a lifelong pension for her and her family of some 7,000 ducats drawn, from the principality's revenue (estimated at 9,000 ducats). Negotiations faltered after the widow's death in 1396.Miller (1921), pp. 435–436 She was succeeded by Ruđina, who in 1391 had married Mrkša Žarković. According to Italian sources, the principality was called the Kingdom of Serbia during Mrksa'a period. Threatened by Ottoman expansion, both Balša's widow and Mrkša repeatedly offered to surrender Valona and their principality to the Venetians, but they refused or procrastinated. After Mrkša's death in 1415, he was briefly succeeded by his widow Ruđina, until the Ottomans took the city in 1417.Soulis (1984), pp. 140–141Miller (1921), pp. 436–437 The Venetian bailo at Constantinople tried to obtain the return of the territory to Ruđina, who was a Venetian citizen, or alternatively purchase it for the Republic with up to 8,000 ducats, but nothing came of it. With the exception of a brief Venetian occupation in 1690–91, the region remained under Ottoman rule until the First Balkan War and the establishment of an independent Albanian state.Miller (1921), pp. 437–442 Rulers *John Komnenos Asen (1346–1363), Despot *Alexander Komnenos Asen (1363–1372), Lord of Valona and Kanina *Balša II Balšić (1372–1385), Lord of Kanina and Valona, and eventually Duke of Albania ()Srpsko učeno društvo (1881), p. 207 * Komnina Balšić (1385–1396), with *Mrkša Žarković (1396–1414), variously styled dominus Avlonae (Latin: \\"lord of Valona\\"), (Greek: \\"lord of Kanina\\") or Ré di Serbia (Italian: \\"King of Serbia\\") * Ruđina Balšić (1414–1417) See also * Albanian principalities * History of Albania  References   Sources   Medieval Epirus Albanian principalities 14th century in Serbia 15th century in Serbia Subdivisions of the Serbian Empire ","title":"Principality of Valona"},{"id":"25117071","text":"Karl Ritter (5 June 1883, Dörflas, Marktredwitz - 31 July 1968, Murnau am Staffelsee) was a German diplomat during the Third Reich and was convicted as a war criminal in the Ministries Trial. A member of the Nazi Party, he was ambassador to Brazil for two years, Special Envoy to the Munich Agreement, and a senior official in the Foreign Office during World War II. Career Ritter graduated with a degree in law in 1905. In 1907 he was appointed to the Bavarian Civil Service. In 1911 he transferred to the colonial office, and in 1918 to the economics office before settling in 1922 in the Foreign Office, where he headed the sections for economics and reparations and finally the section for trading politics, where he played a significant role in the 1930-31 project to establish a German-Austrian Customs Union, which however came to nothing because of French opposition. After the Nazis came to power, in 1937-38, he was first envoy and then ambassador to Rio de Janeiro. In Rio, he was declared persona non grata for demanding the Brazilian government ban anti-Nazi propaganda.O Brasil na Guerra – Cronologia : \\"já que este último foi declarado persona non grata pelo Brasil (Ritter havia censurado o Governo brasileiro por permitir uma suposta campanha anti-nazista contra alemães residentes no país)\\".

Ministries Trial At the war's end Ritter was arrested. At the Ministries Trial in 1947, he was arraigned on five counts. He was found innocent on the first, promotion of aggressive war. On the third count, crimes against humanity, specifically Jews, Catholics and other minorities, the judgement of the court was that Ritter was implicated in the deportation of Jews from Denmark, France, and Hungary, but that while he was under no illusions concerning the fate of Jews deported to the East, he \\"most likely had no immediate knowledge of the extent, methods, and associated circumstances of the measures to exterminate the Jews\\" and that \\"knowledge of the commission or existence of a crime suffices for a conviction only in those cases where a legal obligation exists to prevent or oppose an action.\\"Das Urteil im Wilhelmstrassen-Prozess, p. 158: \\"Er hat sich über die Judenpolitik ... und über das Schicksal der nach dem Osten deportierten Juden keinen Illusionen hingegeben, wenn er auch höchstwahrscheinlich keine unmittelbare Kenntnis von dem Umfang, der Methode und den Begleitumständen der Ausrottungsmaßnahmen gegen die Juden gehabt hat.\\" p. 159: \\"Kenntnis davon, daß ein Verbrechen begangen worden ist oder bevorsteht, genügt zu einer Verurteilung nur in den Fällen, in denen eine Rechtspflicht besteht, eine Handlung zu verhindern oder sich ihr zu widersetzen.\\" On the remaining counts he was found Not Guilty in the sense of the indictment, except for the second count, war crimes, specifically killing and mistreating participants in the war and prisoners of war, on which he was found guilty in two instances, firstly of Foreign Office complicity in an order not to prosecute cases of lynching of Allied flyers, regarding which the judgement of the court was that while Ritter was not the originator of this policy of murder, he was guilty of carrying it out;Das Urteil im Wilhelmstrassen-Prozess, p. 64: \\"Wir sehen Ritter nicht einfach als Laufburschen an...er war zwar nicht Urheber dieser Mordpolitik, hat sie aber durchgeführt.\\" and secondly of the killing of escaped prisoners of war, because in his function within the Foreign Office he was obligated to inform the OKW that under the Geneva Convention of 1929 and Article 14 of the Hague Convention of 1907, the Swiss Embassy extends its protection to British prisoners of war, and he had instead been complicit in the sending of an untrue and misleading memorandum to the Swiss Embassy. One of the three judges, Leon W. Powers, dissented on both counts.Das Urteil im Wilhelmstrassen-Prozess, p. 298. Ritter was sentenced to four years in prison, including time served beginning in 1945; he was released a month after sentencing, on May 15, 1949.Deutscher Presse-Dienst, \\"Die Urteilssprüche\\", Hamburger Abendblatt, 16 April 1949 He was represented by the defense lawyer Horst Pelckmann, who was replaced by Erich Schmidt-Leichner. Later life and family Nothing is known of Ritter's life after his release except for attendance at the home of Winifred Wagner along with Edda Göring, Adolf von Thadden, Hans Severus Ziegler and others. Ritter's illegitimate son Karl-Heinz Gerstner worked as a diplomat in Paris: it was subsequently demonstrated that he had on numerous occasions clandestinely assisted the French resistance; he became a communist and a journalist in East Germany.

A former president of the Canadian Historical Association, he is a professor emeritus at York University.  Background  Craig Heron grew up in the 1950s in a working- class household in suburban Toronto. The first in his family to go to university, he graduated with an Honours B.A. in Modern History from the University of Toronto in 1970 and completed an M.A. in History at the same institution in 1973. He was employed by the Ontario Federation of Students and the Dictionary of Canadian Biography before undertaking an M.A. in Comparative Labour History at the University of Warwick in England. On his return to Canada in 1976, he joined the active social history group at Dalhousie University, where he completed his Ph.D. in 1981. He began teaching at York University in 1982 and was appointed to the Division of Social Science and the Department of History at York University in 1984, where he served as a professor until his formal retirement.W Craig Heron, York University → Faculty of Liberal Arts & Professional Studies His presidential address to the Canadian Historical Association, delivered in 2009, is a notable review of the historical context of his own family background in post-1945 Canada.\\"Harold, Marg, and the Boys: The Relevance of Class in Canadian History,\\" Journal of the Canadian Historical Association, 2009, 1-26.  Research and Publishing  Most of Heron's research, teaching and writing has focused on Canadian labour and social history. Like his contemporaries, such as Gregory Kealey, Heron was influenced by the work of historians such as E.P. Thompson, E.J. Hobsbawm, Herbert Gutman, David Montgomery and others outside Canada who promoted a \\"new labour history\\" to address the multiple dimensions of the working-class experience. Heron's first major book, Working in Steel: The Early Years in Canada, 1883–1935, drew on themes from the history of technology and business and urban, ethnic and labour history. With sociologist Robert Storey of McMaster University, he co-edited a collection of workplace studies, On the Job: Confronting the Labour Process in Canada, with subjects ranging from early printers and railway workers to fast food and assembly line workers. Another edited collection, The Workers' Revolt in Canada, 1917-1925, shed new light on the range of labour unrest across Canada at the close of the First World War. Heron's subsequent books included The Workers' Festival: A History of Labour Day in Canada, co-authored with Steve Penfold, and Booze: A Distilled History. He also wrote a short popular history of the Canadian labour movement, which has gone through three editions. In 2015, he published Lunch-Bucket Lives: Remaking the Workers' City, an exploration of working- class life in Hamilton, Ontario in the early twentieth century. The book received awards from the Ontario Historical Society, the Canadian Historical Association and the Canadian Association for Work and Labour Studies. It was also chosen as the Book of the Year for 2015 by the International Labor History Association. Their citation described the book as \\"a tour de force of social and labor history, bringing an ultra-comprehensive analysis of labor, management, youth and families, gender tensions, ethnic and community contributions, within the economic dynamics of a Canadian city and its labor movement.\\"York professor Craig Heron recognized by International Labor History Association, Quill & Quire, 29 March 2016 His most recent book, published in 2018 under the title Working Lives: Essays in Canadian Working-Class History, is a collection of his articles in the field.  Professional Activities  At York University, Heron taught courses at all levels and supervised more than twenty doctoral dissertations. Several of his students have become prominent academics, among them Adele Perry (University of Manitoba), Steven Penfold (University of Toronto) and Ian Milligan (University of Waterloo). In administrative work, Heron assisted in creating York's programs in Labour Studies and also in Public History. He served as chair of the Division of Social Science and also on the university Senate and on the executive of the York University Faculty Association. For the University of Toronto Press, he was editor of the series Themes in Canadian Social History. In 2006 he was elected vice-president of the Canadian Historical Association and then as president in 2007-09. For his service to the Association, he received the Queen's Diamond Jubilee Medal in 2012. Beyond the university, Heron has been active in the promotion of public history, a form of historical engagement he discussed in an influential article in 2000.\\"The Labour Historian and Public History,\\" Labour/Le Travail, 45 (Spring 2000), 171-97. For many years he was a member of the board of the Workers’ Arts and Heritage Centre, the workers' museum and cultural centre in Hamilton, Ontario, which he helped to establish in 1988. He also curated several exhibits and walking tours for them. He often consults on historical projects and speaks at public events held by museums, archives, unions and heritage organizations. Most recently, Heron has chaired the steering committee for a Toronto Workers’ History Project.  Recognition  In 2017, Heron was named a professor emeritus at York University.

Begay specialized in watercolors, gouache, and silkscreen prints. At the time of his death in 2012, he was the last living, former student of Dorothy Dunn and Geronima C. Montoya at the Santa Fe Indian School. His work has won multiple awards and is exhibited in museums and private collections worldwide and he was among the most famous Diné artists of his generation. Early life and education Harrison Begay was born circa 15 November 1917, in Whitecone, Arizona. Begay's birth year has also been recorded as 1914. His parents were Black Rock and Zonnie/Ah-Hin Nil-bah and he had eight siblings. His mother belonged to the Red Forehead Clan, and his father was from the Zuñi Deer Clan. He grew up in a hogan, where he was raised tending goats and sheep. In 1934, he entered the Santa Fe Indian School to study art at the \\"Studio School\\" under Dorothy Dunn. His classmates included Gerald Nailor, Quincy Tahoma, and Andrew Tsihnahjinnie. Begay learned Dunn's characteristic \\"Studio Style\\" painting, a type of \\"Flatstyle\\". In her book American Indian Painting of the Southwest and Plains Areas, Dunn described Begay's work as \\"at once decorative and lifelike, his color clear in hue and even in value, his figures placid yet inwardly animated.... [H]e seemed to be inexhaustibly resourceful in a quiet reticent way.\\" Begay was one of the Studio School’s star students. Begay served in the Works Progress Administration’s Federal Art Project during the Great Depression era between 1933-1943, painting murals. His Federal Art Project work was once housed in the Gallup Arts Center (a WPA Arts Center), which was demolished and the collection was moved to the Octavia Fellin Public Library in Gallup, New Mexico. During his career, Begay worked in gouache, watercolor, sandpainting, silkscreen painting, and commercial illustration. Most of his works represent genre scenes of Diné (Navajo) life and of natural imagery. He was married in 1940 to Ramona Espinosa. From 1940–1941, Begay attended Black Mountain College in Black Mountain, North Carolina under a scholarship from the Indian Commission. The scholarship allowed him to study architecture for one year at the institution. After he continued studies at Phoenix Junior College.  Career  From 1942 to 1945, during the Second World War, Begay served in the US Army Signal Corps in Germany, Iceland, the Czech Republic, and other parts of continental Europe. Begay took part in the D-Day storming at Normandy Beachhead. He was honorably discharged in 1945 and returned to Santa Fe. In Begay’s early artwork, he often depicted hunting and war imagery, but he later moved away from these types of images following his harrowing experiences during World War II. That same year in 1945, Begay and his wife divorced, and he had financial problems and trouble selling this artwork. He travelled through Colorado, staying in Denver to study with Gerald Curtis Delano. He returned in to Arizona in 1947. In the 1950s, interest in Begay’s artwork increased. Critics often categorized his style in this period as Native American “Traditionalism,” and praised his work as pure, serene, idealized, and uncomplicated. In 1951, Begay expanded his artistic horizons by co-founding the Tewa Enterprises in Santa Fe with fellow artist Charles Barrows. This printing company provided another avenue for Begay and Native American artists to disperse their art to a wide audience. Begay took an active role in cutting the screens for his serigraph reproductions. His artwork was easily adapted to the new medium due to his flat forms, delicate lines, and strict fields of color. The low cost of his prints led to the popularization of Begay’s paintings to a wide American and European audience. Tewa Enterprises promoted Native American artists and was one of the first companies of its kind. Begay was close friends with fellow Studio School artist Quincy Tahoma. Following Tahoma’s death in 1956, Begay was overcome with grief. In 1959, Begay decided to relocate to the Navajo Nation Reservation to be closer to his family and community. In the 1960s and 1970s, Begay spent the majority of his time at the Navajo Nation Reservation continuing to make and sell paintings and prints. His work in the 1960s and 1970s represent genre scenes, animals, geographical locations, and natural elements. Begay placed particular emphasis on horses, colts, deer, and fawn. His career was so profitable that he was able to support himself and his family through his art making. Collectors described Begay’s work as a “timeless, peaceful and gentle world, recognizing only the beauty in the Navajo way of life.” Some scholars deem his paintings to be overly sentimental and romanticizing snapshots of everyday life, dismissing them as “Disney art.” Others praise the soft tone and peaceful style of his art as inventive, original, refined, delicate, and detailed. Death and legacy Harrison Begay died on 18 August 2012 in Gilbert, Arizona at the age of 95. He was buried in the Fort Defiance Veterans Cemetery in Arizona. Begay’s work has been included in a large number of public museum collections, including the Montclair Art Museum, National Museum of the American Indian, the Museum of Modern Art, the Museum of Northern Arizona, the Heard Museum, the Museum of Indian Arts and Culture, the Wheelwright Museum, the Southwest Museum of the American Indian, the Philbrook Museum, the Gilcrease Museum, the De Young Museum of San Francisco, and many more.

The Hôtel d'Assézat in Toulouse, France, is a French Renaissance hôtel particulier (urban palace) of the 16th century which houses the Bemberg Foundation, a major art gallery of the city. The Hôtel d'Assézat differs from the other not only in size and its exceptional ornementation, but also in its pristine condition, a fact which earns it a mention in every overview of French Renaissance. Today, it is home to the Union des sociétés savantes and the Bemberg Foundation.Explanatory comments of Toulouse Renaissance exhibition (2018), Colin Debuiche. It is one of the first manifestations of French classicism. History The Hôtel d'Assézat was likely built by Toulouse architect Nicolas Bachelier for Pierre d'Assézat, an internationally renowned Toulouse woad merchant. The construction of the Hôtel began in 1555 and was not yet completed when Pierre d'Assézat died in 1581. It is an outstanding example of Renaissance palaces architecture of southern France, with an elaborate decoration of the cour d'honneur (courtyard) influenced by Italian Mannerism and by classicism. The use of brick is typical of Toulouse. The Hôtel now belongs to the City of Toulouse and was restored in the 1980s. Presentation Pierre Assézat was at the height of his social and professional success when he launched the construction of his mansion close to the Merchant Exchange, of which he had been one of the founders. Nevertheless, he did get caught up in the religious troubles of the time. A Calvinist convert, he was obliged to leave Toulouse after attempting to seize the town along with his fellows capitouls in 1562. He recanted ten years later and returned to his townhouse in Toulouse where he died in 1581. Assézat launched the first phase of construction in 1555–1557. The main L-shaped structure was built along with the staircase pavilion in the corner. The stonemason Jean Castagnié was entrusted with carrying out the masonry works defined by the architect Nicolas Bachelier. The designs of the façades, featuring twin columns which develop regularly over three floors (Doric, Ionic, Corinthian), takes their inspiration from the great classical models such as the Coliseum. The capitals also precisely adhere to classical models, known from engravings. The erudite architecture—its source can also be traced to the treatises of the royal architect Sebastiano Serlio—expresses order and regularity. On the deaths of Castagnié and Bachelier the construction work stopped; it was restarted in 1560 under the direction of Dominique Bachelier, son of Nicolas. He undertook the creation of the loggia and the passageway, which divided up the courtyard, and the street gate. Much polychrome interplay (brick/stone) and various ornaments (cabochons, diamonds, masks) evoke luxury, surprise and abundance, themes peculiar to mannerist architecture. Main gate The monumental gate designed by Dominique Bachelier combines power with delicacy. The gateway arch takes a certain rhythm from several projecting stones decorated with small dots. Serlio's Extraordinary Book of Doors contain this type of composition and it was used on several occasions by Toulousain architects (Hôtel de Molinier and Hôtel de Massas). The Doric pilasters that frame the gate display an alternating succession of diamond-shaped stone, which gives the ensemble a precious aspect. In the upper section the Ionic pilasters around the mullioned window are fluted and delicately ornamented. And with the table that surmounts it, the composition imparts a refined sophistication. Thus, Dominique Bachelier was able to offer the owner a complete composition which evoked both power and a delicate erudition. The passageway and the consoles In the courtyard, the passageway features arches decorated with diamond-shaped stone. They rest on large scrolled consoles, whose fronts are decorated with grotesque masks of different design. On the side, the rolls of the scrolls engender plant pods and cloves. Each console is borne upon a lion foot standing on a section of pilaster capped underneath with a magnificent rose. These consoles illustrate, by themselves, the manneristic aesthetic on the unusual and the association of opposites, combining mineral, vegetable and animal kingdoms. These refined motifs, heightened through the polychrome interplay and relief of the passageway, were much appreciated by contemporaries and inspired details on other buildings, such as Hôtel de Massas and Laréole Castle. Staircase term In the stairwell, on the landing of the first floor, stands the impressive figure of a male term. Half man, half pilaster, his face grimacing and his hands holding a cushion placed on his head to reduce the pain, this term was condemned to support the weight of the console. Although a symbol of knowledge in the sense that it alludes to mythology (Atlas and Hercules), this motif also amuses thanks to an association of opposites, such as the straining muscles and the soft cushion. Cariatid termes and other telamons were much appreciated in Renaissance Toulouse, notable examples can be found on the windows of Hôtel du Vieux-Raisin and on the main gate of Hôtel de Bagis. Bemberg Foundation Charles IX of France by François Clouet. Entrance of the Foundation seen from the courtyard. Since 1994, the Hôtel d'Assézat has housed the Bemberg Foundation (Fondation Bemberg), an art gallery which presents to the public one of the major private collections of art in Europe: the personal collection of the wealthy Argentine Georges Bemberg (1915–2011). His foundation was created in collaboration with the City of Toulouse. The large Bemberg collection features paintings, drawings, sculptures, ancient books and furniture.

He was the Men's Tennis Coach at Stanford University for 38 years from 1966–2004. His Stanford men's tennis teams won 17 NCAA Men's Tennis Championships, and 50 of his players won All- American honors. He was named the ITA-Wilson \\"Coach of the Decade\\" both for the 1980s and the 1990s. Biography Early years Gould was born in Ventura, California in 1937. He attended Ventura High School with longtime tennis friend, Tom Chivington. He was the Student Body President and the Most Valuable Player (MVP) of the Tennis Team. He also won the Ventura County Singles and Doubles Championships in 1955. After graduating from Ventura High School in 1955, Gould enrolled at Stanford University. In the summer of 1958, he contacted the Southern California Tennis Association to provide two players to run a kid's clinic in Ventura and was sent Mike Franks and Noel Brown. Dick won three varsity letters in tennis and won the tennis team's Leadership Award. He graduated from Stanford University with a Bachelor's Degree in 1959, and earned a Master's Degree from Stanford in 1960. Gould began his coaching career at Mountain View High School in Mountain View, California, where he was Tennis Coach and Assistant Football Coach from 1960–1964. From 1963–1966, he was the Tennis Coach at Foothill Junior College in Los Altos, California, where his first champion player was Horst Ritter, who won the State Junior College Singles Championship, as well as the doubles with Rodney Kopp in 1963. His teams won consecutive State Junior College Championships in 1964 and 1965. He was succeeded by friend and another legendary coach in Tom Chivington. He was also the tennis professional at the Fremont Hills Country Club in Los Altos Hills from 1960–1966. Stanford's men's tennis coach In 1966, Gould was hired as the Head Tennis Coach at Stanford. He continued to serve as Stanford's Head Tennis Coach for 38 years from 1966–2004. At Stanford, Gould's tennis teams won 17 NCAA Team Championships in a span of 28 years, winning in 1973 and 1974, 1977 and 1978, 1980 and 1981, 1983, 1986, 1988 through 1990, 1992, 1995 through 1998, and 2000. His teams were NCAA Championship runners-up in 1972, 1976, 1984, and 1994. His players also won 10 singles titles and 7 doubles titles. He is the winningest coach in Stanford men's tennis history with an overall record of 776–148 and a .840 winning percentage. During Gould's tenure as Head Coach at Stanford, 50 of his players were selected as All-Americans. Nine of his Stanford players, including John McEnroe, Gene Mayer, Alex \\"Sandy\\" Mayer, Roscoe Tanner and Tim Mayotte, have gone on to be ranked among the top 15 in ATP World Singles Rankings. He has also coached 14 players who have reached top 10 in ATP World Doubles Rankings, including No. 1 Ranked Doubles Players, McEnroe, Jim Grabb, Jonathan Stark, Alex O'Brien, Jared Palmer, and Bob and Mike Bryan. The Stanford men's tennis program began its rise to national prominence when Gould successfully recruited Roscoe Tanner in 1969 and Alex \\"Sandy\\" Mayer in 1970. In 1972, Tanner and Mayer won the NCAA doubles championship, and the Stanford team finished second in the NCAA tournament. In 1973, Stanford won everything in the NCAA tournament: Mayer won singles, Mayer and Jim Delaney won doubles, and the team won the national championship ahead of USC. This was Stanford's first NCAA team championship in tennis, and its first NCAA team championship in any sport since 1953. Gould coached both John McEnroe and his younger brother Patrick. They each led Stanford to NCAA championships, and John won the NCAA single's title. In June, 1977, a few months before John McEnroe entered Stanford, he reached the Wimbledon semifinals, and there were rumors that he would turn pro immediately. This gave Gould an opportunity to play a trick on McEnroe. In Gould’s words: > When school was getting ready to start, he called me. “Coach, I'm at the > airport. Can you pick me up as soon as possible?” I teased, “I gave your > scholarship away. I thought you were turning pro.” Silence. Then we both > cracked up over the phone. When the tennis season began early in 1978, the Stanford team was so deep that the defending NCAA singles champion, Matt Mitchell, played for Stanford in the no. 4 position behind McEnroe, Bill Maze, and Perry Wright. The team compiled a perfect 24-0 record, the first of three Stanford men's tennis teams to enjoy an undefeated season. The 1998 team finished its season with a perfect 28–0 record, lost only two singles matches and one doubles point during the entire season, and won all four of its NCAA matches without losing a dual-match point. Gould's tennis philosophy focused on the serve-and-volley game. However, Gould continued to have success in the 1990s even as the game evolved with powerful, oversized, composite rackets and blasting topspin ground strokes. Gould is also the author of the tennis instructional book, \\"Tennis Anyone?\\", one of the most popular tennis guides ever published. Gould is also credited with developing the first personal seat license plan while coaching at Stanford. Seeking financing for a new tennis stadium, Gould in 1986 came up with the idea of selling the rights to seats, a licensing plan under which purchaser's name is engraved in the seat, and the purchaser owns the right to have first choice for tickets for any event held in the stadium. Family and later years Gould's wife, Anne, was the Women's Tennis Coach at Stanford from 1976 through 1979. She led the women's team to an AIAW championship in 1978—the first team championship in any women's sport for Stanford. The team finished in second place the other three years she coached. (The NCAA did not begin sponsoring women's tennis championships until 1982.) Gould and his wife have five children. After the 2004 season, Gould stepped down as the head tennis coach, but he remained active at Stanford for many more years as the John L. Hinds Director of Tennis. He retired in January, 2018, completing a Stanford tennis career as player, coach, and director of tennis that spanned 57 years. Awards, honors and halls of fame Gould was twice named the Intercollegiate Tennis Association-Wilson \\"Coach of the Decade,\\" first for the 1980s and subsequently for the 1990s.

As with clothes, there were several hairstyles that were limited to certain people in ancient society. Styles are so distinctive they allow scholars today to create a chronology of Roman portraiture and art; we are able to date pictures of the empresses on coins, or identify busts depending on their hairstyles. Significance A young woman sits while a servant fixes her hair with the help of a cupid, who holds up a mirror to offer a reflection, detail of a fresco from the Villa of the Mysteries, Pompeii, c. 50 BC Much like today, hair for the Romans was as much an expression of personal identity as clothes. Hairstyles were determined by a number of factors, namely gender, age, social status, wealth and profession. A woman's hairstyle expressed her individuality in the ancient Roman World. How one dressed one's hair was an indication of a person's status and role in society. Hair was a very erotic area of the female body for the Romans, and attractiveness of a woman was tied to the presentation of her hair. As a result, it was seen as appropriate for a woman to spend time on her hair in order to create a flattering appearance. Hairdressing and its necessary accompaniment, mirror gazing, were seen as distinctly feminine activities. Lengthy grooming sessions for women were tolerated, despite writers such as Tertullian and Pliny commenting on their abhorrence for time and energy women dedicate to their hair.Tertullian., De Culti Feminarum,2:7 However, the numerous depictions of women hairdressing and mirror-gazing in tomb reliefs and portraiture is a testament to how much hairdressing was seen as part of the female domain.Kampman (1981), 149–52 For more than just attractiveness, hairstyling was the leisure pursuit of the cultured, elegant female. Hair was seen as much as an indication of wealth and social status as it was of taste and fashion. But unlike modern-day hairstyles, comfort and naturalism for the Romans took a back-seat to hairstyles that displayed the wearer's wealth to a maximum. In other words, having a complex and unnatural hairstyle would be preferred to a simple one, because it would illustrate the wealth of the wearer in being able to afford to take the time to style their hair.Bartman (2001), 6 For women to have a fashionable hairstyle showed they were part of the elegant Roman culture. A 'natural' style was associated with barbarians, who the Romans believed had neither the money nor the culture to create these styles. \\"Natural\\" showed a lack of culture, and grooming of the hair went hand-in-hand with being part of a sophisticated civilization. The association with barbarians was why Roman men kept their hair cut short. It was the job of slave hairdressers, called Ornatrices, to create their master's hairstyle new each day, as well as pulling out any grey hairs.Carcopino (1973), 167 Apart from society, hair was used symbolically to mark rites of passage; for instance, loosened hair was common at a funeral, and the seni crines was the hairstyle worn by brides and Vestal Virgins; divided and plaited into six braids, and in the case of the bride, it was parted with a spear.Bartman (2001), 4 A bride's hair was parted with a hasta recurva or hasta caelibaris, a bent iron spearhead and crowned with flowers. In addition to ceremonies hairstyle defined the age of a woman. There was a marked difference in hair acceptable for preadolescent girls and sexually mature women. Preadolescent girls would often have long hair cascading down the back where as women would have equally long hair but it would be controlled through wrapping and braiding. Headgear Statue showing Palla drawn over head. This hairstyle is that of the Antonine Period. Veils Perhaps due to its erotic association, hair was often linked with Roman ideas of female modesty and honour. We know that veils were important in this case, as they protected against (or encouraged, according to Seneca the Elder) solicitations by men.Seneca the Elder., Controversiae 2.7.6 The palla was the mark of a married, respectable woman. It was a piece of cloth wrapped around the body with one end over the shoulder. There is significant evidence for the palla being draped over the back of the head as a veil.Olson (2008), 33 The palla supposedly signified the dignity and sexual modesty of a married woman, but due to its encumbering nature as a veil, there has been much debate whether it was only worn in public by the aristocracy, or if at all by working women of lower classes.Fantham (2008), 166-7; Olsen (2008), 33-6 both offer discussion on this Vittae were woollen fillets that bound a married woman's hair. They were another indication of a wife's modesty and purity and were seen as part of the clothing and presentation of a matron.Olson (2008), 36 Vittae could be inset with precious stones, or in the case of the Flaminicae, they would be purple in colour. Wigs Fresco showing a woman looking in a mirror as she dresses (or undresses) her hair, from the Villa of Arianna at Stabiae (Castellammare di Stabia), 1st century AD Due to the nature of hair and the relatively wet climate in the upper reaches of the Roman Empire, there are very few examples of wigs that survive to this day. Women wore wigs whether they were bald or not. So too did men; Emperor Otho wore a wig, as did Domitian.Suetonius., Life of Otho, 12 ; Morgan (1997), 214 Wigs allowed women to better achieve the kind of 'tall' styles that particularly punctuated the Flavian and Trajanic eras (e.g. the periods of 69–96 and 98–117 AD). So tall were these hairstyles, that ancient writer Juvenal likens them to multi-storey buildings. Wigs were made from human hair; blonde hair from Germany and black from India were particularly prized, especially if the hair came from the head of a person from a conquered civilisation.Ovid, Amores, 1:14:45-6 ; Bartman (2001), 14 The blond hair of various Germanic peoples symbolized the spoils of war. In cases where wigs were used to hide baldness, a natural look was preferred, therefore a wig with a hair colour similar to the wearer's original was worn. But in instances where a wig was worn for the purpose of showing off, naturalism did not play much of a part. Obviously fake wigs were preferred, sometimes intertwined with two contrasting hair colours with blonde hair from Germany and black from India.Bartman (2001), 14 Gold dust also gave the appearance of blond hair and enhanced already blond hair. Emperor Lucius Verus (r. 161 – 169 AD), who had natural blond hair, was said to sprinkle gold dust on his head to make himself even blonder.Michael Grant (1994). The Antonines: The Roman Empire in Transition. London & New York: Routledge. , pp 27-28. A convenience of wigs used by Romans is that they could be directly pinned onto the head of the wearer, meaning a style could be achieved much faster than if it had been done with the wearer's own hair. Further, it would lessen the inconvenience of having to grow one's own hair too long. It has been suggested that the necessary length to be able to create these hairstyles daily would be well below the shoulder, perhaps to the waist.Olson (2008), 71; Bartman (2001), 10 There were two types of wig in Roman times: the full wig, called the capillamentum, and the half wig, called the galerus.Olson (2008), 74 The galerus could be in the form of a fillet of woolen hair used as padding to build an elaborate style, or as a toupee on the back or front of the head. Toupees were attached by pins, or by sewing the it onto a piece of leather and attaching it as a wig. Further, glue could be used to affix it to the scalp or alternatively, as a bust from the British Museum illustrates, the toupee could be braided into the existing hair.Bust of Matidia, London, The British Museum 1805.7-3.96; Bartman (2001), 10 Janet Stephens is an amateur archaeologist and hairdresser who has reconstructed some of the hairstyles of ancient Rome, attempting to prove that they were not done with wigs, as commonly believed, but with the person's own hair. Detachable marble wigs Busts themselves could have detachable wigs. There have been many suggestions as to why some busts have been created with detachable wigs and some without. Perhaps the main reason was to keep the bust looking up-to-date. It would have been too expensive to commission a new bust every time hair fashion changed, so a mix- and-match bust would have been preferable for women with less money.Kleiner and Matheson (1996), 174 Perhaps another reason was to accommodate the Syrian ritual of anointing the skull of the bust with oil. Or further, in cases where the bust was a funerary commission, it can be safely assumed that the subject of the bust would not have had an opportunity to sit for another portrait after their death.Fittschen and Zanker (1983), 105 Although exactly how these marble wigs were attached is unknown, the likely difficulty of changing the 'wigs' effectively would have probably put many women off choosing a detachable and reattachable bust in the first place.Bartman (2001), 19  Tools of the trade   Dyes  Dying hair was popular among women, although the frequency that hair was coloured often made it weaker. Tertullian discusses how hair dye burnt the scalp and was harmful for the head.Tertullian, De Culti Feminarum, 2:6 Artificial dyes could be applied through powders, gels and bleach. Henna, a temporary dye, or even animal fat, could be applied to make the hair more manageable.Bartman (2001), 12 Hair and the Artifice of Roman Female Adornment; Allason-Jones (1989), 133-7 Aside from henna, more common permanent dyes were based on natural substances and perhaps more unorthodox mixtures. To prevent graying some Romans wore a paste at night made from herbs and earthworms and pigeon dung was used to lighten hair. For example, to dye hair black, Pliny the Elder suggests applying leeches that have rotted in red wine for 40 days.Pliny the Elder., Natural History, 32:23 Dying hair red requires a mixture of animal fat and beechwood ashesPliny the Elder., Natural History, 28:51 whilst dying hair gold required saffron.Tertullian, De Culti Feminarum, 2:6:1 Ovid gives plenty more examples for dyes, such as herbs and saffron.Ovid., Ars Amatoria, 3:158-64 To cure diseases such as hair loss, Pliny suggests the application of a sow's gall bladder, mixed with bull's urine, or of the ashes of an ass's genitals, or other mixtures such as the ashes of a deer's antlers mixed with wine. Further, goat's milk or goat's dung is said to cure head lice.Pliny the Elder., Natural History, 28:46 Gold Hairnet, Imperial period, Pompeii  Curling irons, pins and hairnets  The calamistrum was the name for the Roman curling iron. It consisted of a hollow metal outer cylinder and a smaller solid cylinder inside it. The hair would be wrapped around the solid cylinder and inserted into the metal outer. The metal outer would be heated in a fire, making the hair curly. It has been reported that because of the frequency and temperature that hair was curled at, thinning and damaged hair was common amongst women.Olson (2008), 73 While gel and henna, as mentioned above, were used to manage hair, hairnets and pins were in common usage too. Poorer women would have used wooden pins, while the aristocracy used gold, ivory, crystal, silver or painted bone. The pins were decorated with carvings of the gods, or beads and pendants.Kleiner and Matheson (1996), 162; Olson (2008), 75-6 Styles over time Roman hairstyles changed, but there were several constant hairstyles that were used continuously, such as the tutulus, or the bun. The beehive, helmet, hairbouquet or pillbox are modern day names given to Roman hairstyles. Tutulus The tutulus was originally an Etruscan style worn commonly in the late 6th and early 5th century BC was a hairstyle worn primarily by the materfamilias, the mother of the family.Olson (2008), 39 It remained in constant use even when fashion changed. To achieve it, the hair was divided and piled high and shaped into a bun, after which it was tied with purple fillets of wool. By the end, the hair would be conical in shape. It was also the hairstyle worn by the flaminicae. thumbPortrait of a woman of the Flavian period, marble // Portrait bust of a young woman (Julia, daughter of Titus?). Marble. 80s—90s CE. Shows the extremely elaborate hair styles worn by upper- class Roman women of the time. Rome, Capitoline Museums, Palazzo Nuovo, Hall of the Emperors. Republican period and Augustan era styles The Republican period and the nodus style was particularly common. In Imperial iconography the nodus coiffure was associated predominately with the women of Augustus' household. The nodus style saw the hair parted in three, with the hair from the sides of the head tied in a bun at the back while the middle section is looped back on itself, creating an effect not unlike the (comparably modern) Pompadour style.Examples of the Nodus style Livia, wife of Augustus, and Octavia, sister of Augustus, particularly favoured the nodus style, both continuing to use it well into the Imperial Period.Further examples of the Nodus and Other styles in the Julio-Claudian era were designed to be simple, with hair parted in two and tied in a bun at the back. This was perhaps done in order to juxtapose Roman modesty against Cleopatra and her flamboyance.Kleiner and Matheson (1996), 37 Flavian and Antonine hairstyles Portrait of a Roman woman, Flavian period Rome, Musei CapitoliniFlavian and Antonine hairstyles differed greatly between men and women in real life and in the physical appearance of hair for male and female sculptures. In ancient Rome hair was a major determinant of a woman's physical attractiveness, women preferred to be presented as young, and beautiful. Therefore, female sculptures were known to have dramatic curls carved with strong chiaroscuro effects. On the other hand, most men in the Flavian period of late first century AD have their hair trimmed short on the crown like the portrait of Domitian for example (pictured) that implied an active role in society, while a woman's connoted passivity. Flavian and Antonine hairstyles are perhaps the most famous, and extravagant, of Imperial Rome's styles. During this time the aristocratic women's style became the most flamboyant (cypriote curls). The styles were lofty, with masses of shaped curls and braids. The high arching crowns on the front were made using fillets of wool and toupees, and could be attached to the back of the head as well as the front. Typically, as in the case of the famous Fonseca Bust (pictured), this particular hairstyle appears to have been popular during the Flavian period. The hair was combed into two parts; the front section was combed forwards and built with curls, while the back was plaited and coiled into an elaborate bun (Orbis Comarum).Bartman (2001), 18 This fashion was described by the writer Juvenal as the hairstyles that made women appear tall from the front but quite the opposite from the back. The later Antonine Period saw curls at the front of the head brought to a lower level than the Flavian Period. The braids coiled at the back of the head were brought further forward, instead often resting on the top of the head. Another style of the Antonine period saw the hair separated into rivets and tied at the backExamples of the Antonine styles and riveted Furthermore, whether Roman portraits faithfully translate the actual hairstyles worn by the sitters is problematic because of the scarcity of surviving hair which leaves little basis of comparison. The second problem is the physical accuracy of the Roman portraits itself. However, as a result of the many sculptures that have some reference to hair, ethnographers and anthropologists have recognized hair to play a key role in identifying gender and determining societies in which individuals belonged. Severan dynasty Julia Domna, wife of Septimius Severus, had a particularly notable hairstyle. Julia Domna was the wig's most influential patron. She wore a heavy, globular wig with simple finger-sized waves with a simple center parting. Julia Domna was the daughter of a high-ranking priest from Syria, and it has been suggested that her style was indicative of her foreign origins.Bartman (2001), 17 Despite being from the East, she adopted a wig to project a familiar Roman guise and particularly in order to imitate her predecessor, Faustina the Younger. In 2012 Janet Stephens's video Julia Domna: Forensic Hairdressing, a recreation of a later hairstyle of the Roman empress, was presented at the Archaeological Institute of America’s annual meeting in Philadelphia.Bust of DomitianForeign women often wore their hair differently from Roman women, and women from Palmyra typically wore their hair waved in a simple center-parting, accompanied by diadems and turbans according to local customs. Women from the East were not known to commonly wear wigs, preferring to create elaborate hairstyles from their own hair instead.Bartman (2001), 17-8 As time progressed, Severan hairstyles switched from the finger-waved center parting style, to one with more curls and ringlets at the front and back of the head, often accompanied by a wig.Example of Severan style, finger waves underneath Palla  Men's hairstyles  fair hair hunting rabbit in a mosaic from the Villa Romana del Casale, Roman Sicily, 4th century AD Roman hairstyles for men would change throughout ancient times. While men's hair may have required no less daily attention than women's, the styling as well as the social response it engendered were radically different. Lengthy grooming sessions for men would be looked at as taboo. Throughout the period as well, women's hair was carved according to different techniques based on the sex. For example, one of the primary features that is seen in many women but never in men is long hair divided by a center part. It is apparent men never wore this, since there is no biological difference in hair between sexes this is a practice determined solely by culture. Eyebrows of both sexes were tended to be treated in the same manner. In early times, it is most likely Roman men wore their hair long. With the introduction of barbers called tonsors in about 300 BC it became customary to wear hair short. In Ancient Rome, household slaves would perform hairdressing functions for wealthy men. However, men who lacked access to private hairdressing and shaving services or those who preferred a more social atmosphere went to a barbershop (tonstrina). Barbershops were places of social gatherings and a young man's first shave was often even celebrated as a passage to manhood in the community. The barbers usually shaved the customers faces with iron razors and applied an aftershave with ointments that may have contained spider webs. Trimming a head of hair and shaving would be the rule in Rome in the second century BC. Roman men who wore beards would not be admitted into the senate unless they shaved. In Ancient Rome it was desirable for men to have a full head of hair. This was a problem for Julius Caesar. Being bald was considered a deformity at the time, so Caesar went to great pains to hiding his thinning hair. And because of it he used to comb his thin locks forward over the crown of his head. Suetonius wrote: \\"His baldness was something that greatly bothered him.\\" Caesar was allowed by the Senate to wear a laurel crown with which he was able to mask his receding hairline. During the Roman times it is easy to know how the emperors wore their hair. For example, one constant feature of Augustus's portraits is his hairstyle, with its distinctive forked locks of hair on his forehead. The emperor was most often looked at as the trendsetter during these times. This is shown by the emperor Nero (54–68 AD) who adopted elaborate hairstyles with curls and even had sideburns. Men began to curl their hair more and Nero started the trend. Following in the Flavian period most men have hair trimmed short on the crown and lacking strong plasticity. During the next few decades a straight hair cut with forehead bangs was popular with Trajanic men. Another trend that was started by Emperor Hadrian (117–138 AD). He was the first emperor to wear a beard, and after him many of the emperors continued the trend. This has usually been seen as a mark of his devotion to Greece and Greek culture. One literary source, the Historia Augusta, claims that Hadrian wore a beard to hide blemishes on his face.

The chemical formula is therefore C5nH6n+2 Staffanes were first obtained in 1988 by P. Kazynski and J. Michl, by spontaneous polymerization of [1.1.1]-propellane C5H6 or C2(=CH2)3. In the reaction, the axial C-C bond of the propellane (the \\"bridge\\") is broken, creating a free bond on each of the two axial carbons (the \\"bridgeheads\\"). The resulting structural unit [-C≡(-CH2-)3≡C-] is a rigid cage, consisting of two carbon atoms joined by three methylene bridges; therefore the joined units are constrained to lie on a straight line.

As the 332d Troop Carrier Squadron it remained in China through 1947. The squadron was activated again for the Berlin Airlift from 1948 to 1949. The squadron was active again from 1955 to 1958 as an assault airlift unit, operating the Fairchild C-123 Provider. Its last period of active service was from 1993 to 2004 providing operational support airlift with C-21 Learjets. History World War II British troops unload a combat cargo C-47 in Burma The squadron was first activated in India in June 1944 as the 11th Combat Cargo Squadron, one of the original squadrons of the 3d Combat Cargo Group. The squadron equipped with Douglas C-47 Skytrains and was attached to the 443d Troop Carrier Group shortly after the squadron was organized. The squadron provided airlift support for the Allies in their efforts to control norther Burma, then in their drive southward.Maurer, Combat Units, pp. 32-33 In May 1945, the squadron moved its operations from India to China. It was awarded the Distinguished Unit Citation following V-J Day for its actions in China, Mongolia and Vietnam in September 1945. From October through December 1945, it airlifted Chinese troops to eastern China for the disarmament of Japanese troops locate there. Beginning in January 1946, the squadron provided transportation for General George C. Marshall, who was attempting to resolve the civil war between the Nationalist and Communist forces seeking to control China. These efforts proved unsuccessful and were terminated in early 1947 and the squadron was inactivated in April of that year. Berlin Airlift C-54 landing at Tempelhof Central Airport The squadron was activated a second time as the Air Force replaced its provisional 1422d Air Transport Group in November 1948 with the 513d Troop Carrier Group to operate its Douglas C-54 Skymasters flying from Rhein-Main Air Base, Germany to support the Berlin Airlift.See Fletcher, p. 151 (discontinuance of 1422d and activation of 513th). The squadron flew food and supplies to West Berlin. The Soviets ended their blockade of Berlin in May 1949, but airlift operations continued through September in order to create a stockpile should the Soviets resume the blockade.Haulman, p. 8 With the end of the airlift, air transport forces in Germany were drawn down and the squadron was inactivated in October of that year. Assault airlift C-123B Providers in formation during the 1950sAircraft are Fairchild C-123B-7-FA Providers, serials 54-636 and 54-641 The squadron was activated again at Sewart Air Force Base, Tennessee as an assault airlift unit. Although initially equipped with Fairchild C-119 Flying Boxcars, it soon transitioned to the Fairchild C-123 Provider. The squadron participated in numerous exercises to maintain proficiency in assault airlift operations. In October 1957, Tactical Air Command converted its tactical units to the dual deputy organization and the squadron was reassigned from the 513th Group to the 513th Troop Carrier Wing. The squadron was inactivated in 1958 as Sewart became a Lockheed C-130 Hercules base.Ravenstein, pp. 279-281 Operational support airlift The squadron was redesignated the 322d Airlift Flight and activated with C-21 Learjets at Randolph Air Force Base, Texas in April 1993. It was initially assigned to the 12th Operations Group at Randolph, but in 1997, operational support flights were transferred to Air Mobility Command (AMC) and the flight came under the 458th Airlift Squadron, located at Scott Air Force Base, Illinois. The squadron provided airlift support, primarily to senior members of Air Education and Training Command. Most of the flight's pilots were new pilots, who were also able to gain experience on an aircraft whose operating costs were lower than tactical airplanes. The squadron's mission included aeromedical evacuation. The use of the small C-21, rather than larger Douglas HC-9 Nightingales resulted in savings when missions called for transportation of single patients or small medical teams. The flight kept a plane on alert on a rotating basis with its parent 458th Squadron.McKenna & Coppage, p. 43 The squadron was inactivated in September 2004, when AMC consolidated the operations of its eight operational airlift flights into four squadrons.

Biography Edmund Hobhouse, born in London on 17 April 1817, was elder brother of Arthur Hobhouse, 1st Baron Hobhouse, and was second son of Henry Hobhouse, under-secretary of state for the home department (Home Office). He entered Eton in 1824, but left it in 1830 from ill-health and read with tutors. He matriculated at Balliol College, Oxford, on 16 December 1834, and graduated B.A. in 1838, proceeding M.A. in 1842, B.D. in 1851, and D.D. in 1858. He rowed in the Balliol boat for four years (1835–8), and was stroke in 1836–7. Oxford giving no facilities for theological study, Hobhouse went to Durham University, where he graduated L.Th. in 1840. At his father's wish, he entered for a fellowship at Merton, and was elected at his third trial in 1841. He was ordained deacon in the same year and priest in 1842. In 1843 he became vicar of the college living of St. Peter in the East, Oxford, which he held with his fellowship till 1858. Hobhouse worked his parish with zeal and declined offers of better preferment. Bishop Samuel Wilberforce made him rural dean, and as secretary of the diocesan board of education he did much for the church schools, and helped to found the Culham training college for schoolmasters. On his father's death in 1854 he devoted part of his patrimony to providing at St. Edmund Hall and St. Alban Hall, Oxford, help for necessitous students. On the subdivision of the diocese of New Zealand, Bishop George Augustus Selwyn obtained the appointment of Hobhouse to the new see of Nelson, for which he was consecrated in 1858. The diocese, extending over , had a sparse and scattered population, with few roads. Its difficulties were increased by the outbreak of the New Zealand Wars and by the discovery of gold. Hobhouse was diligent in ministering to his scattered flock, was generous in hospitality, provided a residence for the holder of the see, and founded the Bishop's School. But the work broke down his health; he resigned the see in 1865 and returned home in 1866. In 1867 he became incumbent of Beech Hill, near Reading. On Bishop Selwyn's translation to Lichfield he made Hobhouse, in 1869, his assistant bishop, and in 1871 gave him the rectory of St James' Church, Edlaston, Derbyshire. During 1874–5 he was chancellor of the diocese, though he had no legal training. On the death of Selwyn in 1878, the new bishop, W. D. Maclagan, retained him as assistant; but ill-health led him to resign in 1881. He retired to Wells, lending aid to clergy around him but refusing office. The Somerset Archæological Society gained in him an active member, and he helped to found the Somerset Record Society. He died at Wells on 20 April 1904. Hobhouse was twice married: (1) in 1858 to Mary Elizabeth, daughter of General the Hon. John Brodrick (d 1864), by whom he had two sons; and (2) in 1868 to Anna Maria, daughter of David Williams, Warden of New College, Oxford, who survived him. His second son Walter was also an Anglican priest – he became Archdeacon of Aston and of Gloucester and a canon in Birmingham and in Gloucester (all in England).‘HOBHOUSE, Rev. Walter’, Who Was Who, A & C Black, 1920–2008; online edition, Oxford University Press, December 2007 accessed 23 November 2012 Hobhouse, who was from his Oxford days a zealous student of English mediæval history, more especially on its ecclesiastical side, published A Sketch of the Life of Walter de Merton (1859), and edited the Register of Robert de Norbury, Bishop of Lichfield and Coventry (in Collections for a History of Staffordshire, vol. i. 1880). For the Somerset Record Society he edited Calendar of the Register of John de Drokensford, 1309–1329 (1887); Churchwardens' Accounts of Croscombe, &c.; (1890); Rentalia et Custumaria Michaelis de Ambresbury (1891); and (with other members of the council) Two Cartularies of the Augustinian Priory of Bruton and the Cluniac Priory of Montacute (1894).

Synopsis In a region in the east of France, Pierrette, (Dominique Labourier), a young mill worker devotes herself totally to her trade union activity even to the detriment of her private life. She has separated from her husband and left her child in the care of a relative. Two men enter into her life. She crosses first the path of an émigré Italian, nicknamed Beau Masque, (Luigi Diberti), a truck driver. Then, at the time of a dance organised by the French Communist Party, she makes the acquaintance of Philippe Letourneau (Jean-Claude Dauphin), the factory director. He is the young 'son of the family', pushed into the business by his parents who are majority shareholders. Though attracted to Philippe, Pierrette takes no action, not wanting to compromise her union activity. It is with Beau Masque that she begins a relationship. But a wave of redundancies, that the director does not control, is going to throw the protagonists towards a final drama.

He was named to his position on 27 March 2008, after nearly three decades in finance- related positions in the government and the government-owned Industrial Bank of Korea, and retired on 25 March 2011. Personal life Kim was born on 13 October 1948 in Yecheon, Gyeongsangbuk-do near the Sobaek Mountains. He was raised by his mother and paternal grandfather after losing his father to the Korean War at the age of two. He studied primary, middle, and high school in his hometown; he states that his home room teacher at Daechang High School left an indelible mark on him during his formative years. He matriculated at Seoul National University as an undergraduate in 1967, graduating in 1971 with a degree in commerce. He passed the State Administration Examination for Civil Servants in 1970 while in his senior year. When his daughters got married in 2008 and then in 2009, he publicly broke with Korean wedding traditions by refusing gifts of cash, out of concern for the propriety of a person in his official position accepting such gifts from people in the sector he was supposed to regulate, and held comparatively simple weddings. Early career Kim's first official assignment as a civil servant was in the Economic-Science Council, a presidential advisory body. He joined the Ministry of Finance in 1976. He received a master's degree in economics from the University of Washington in 1985. In 1992, he went to the United Kingdom to begin his service as financial and economic counselor in the South Korean embassy there. He returned to South Korea in 1996 in the Ministry of Finance. After serving as the FSS' vice-governor from 2000 to 2001, Kim took up the position of chairman and CEO of the government-owned Industrial Bank of Korea, which he held until 2004. He redirected the bank towards an emphasis on consumers and service, and was awarded the Dasan Financial Prize in January 2003 and the Korea Customer Satisfaction CEO award in November the same year. Under his leadership, the state bank’s profitability peaked and its stock price jumped to reflect the changes that were made during his helm to turn IBK into \\"a state bank that makes money\\". During his tenure at IBK, he also wrote a 240-page not-for-sale promotional book entitled Humorous Bundle (), which was distributed in an effort to bring about a spirited corporate culture by changing the stiff image of bankers and create a livelier place of work. Kim then joined the monetary policy committee of the Bank of Korea. As governor of the Financial Supervisory Service As one of his first acts upon taking office, Kim set up the Change Management Task Force and charged it with eliminating the deep-seated practices and embedded culture of heavy-handedness for which the financial supervisory authority was criticized. He also ordered a probe into how the organization was perceived at large in order to identify areas that the market viewed as heavy-handed of the financial regulator, and to clearly set down the accountability and performance of senior officials, a structure of divisions was adopted to complement the oversight of the respective areas of financial services. In November 2008, Kim had the Corporate Credit Task Force set up within the FSS in a joint FSS-FSC step to back a corporate restructuring drive, to be led by creditor financial institutions. Unlike the aftermath of the 1997 Asian Financial Crisis, when the restructuring of insolvent corporate debtors had taken place in an atmosphere of panic, Kim championed a preventive restructuring drive based on corporate debtors and industrial sectors that were likely to face difficulties in meeting their obligations. Corporate restructuring moved forward in those industries particularly susceptible to global economic cycles, such as shipbuilding, shipping, and construction industries. The media credited Kim for having quelled some of the looming uncertainties that unnerved financial markets. In an effort to raise the level of financial support to low-income earners, Kim also encouraged the country’s banks to lend to those who were hardest hit by the global financial crisis. He dispatched bank examiners to banks to ensure that industry malpractices such as compensating deposits and balances were restrained. He also launched a series of programs within the FSS to redress financial negligence and malpractices and to respond to consumer reports of financial malpractice, such as commissions for intermediation. He also pointed out the need to lower the financial costs of those in the lower income brackets by doing away with the banking practice of requiring cosignatories for loans.

It was an important cultural center in south central Wisconsin and served as a destination and important venue for members of the LGBT community from Wisconsin and northern Illinois, until its destruction by fire on February 18, 1996. The Club de Wash in the complex hosted many well-known musical acts over its history, and served as a hub of central Wisconsin's live music community. The Hotel Washington organization, through owner Rodney Scheel, was important in establishing gay pride events in the Madison area, including Madison's seminal MAGIC Picnic. History Located at 636 West Washington Avenue in Madison, the Hotel was created at the Milwaukee Road railroad depot in Madison in 1885.The Wisconsin Light (TWL), Volume 9, Number 5, February 29, 1996, p. 1 Originally named the Commercial Hotel, it was a low-rent hotel and halfway house through most of the twentieth century, until it was purchased by Rodney Scheel in 1975Jones, p. 5B for $190,000.Linda Fibich, The Milwaukee Journal, Sunday, December 20, 1984 At the time, it also contained a \\"greasy spoon\\" restaurant called the HOT L Cafe. Rodney and his brother and business partner Greg converted the cafe into the Café Palms, a higher-end eating establishment. After Rodney Scheel's death in 1990, his brother, Greg Scheel, continued to operate the Hotel Washington with no break in continuity. At the building's peak in the 1990s, several other businesses were located within the confines of the building: * Rod's, a historically significant gay barFibich, 1984 * Club de Wash, a mixed use bar with regular live entertainment * Café Palms, a restaurant featuring omelettes, sandwiches, and desserts. * The Barber's Closet, a basement bar that was a former speakeasy during Prohibition, and which featured a range of craft cocktails * The Barber's Closet Salon, a working hair salon whose shelf of barber's tools hid a second door to The Barber's Closet (bar) * The New Bar, a teen-friendly dance club * Café Espresso * The Micro Bar, a bar featuring craft beers The building also maintained a working hotel with both short and long-term housing. Residents included several retired railroad workers. Fire Just after 6 am on Sunday, February 18, 1996, fire broke out in the building. Fire crews arrived at the scene at 6:28 AM.TWL, 1996, p. 16 All 16 people in the building at the time of the fire were evacuated safely.The Daily Cardinal, Monday, February 19, 1996 The building was largely gutted.

However, it was as a teacher, first at Maloga Aboriginal Mission and later at Cummeragunja Reserve, that he is remembered in history. Through this role, he equipped and influenced generations of Aboriginal Australian activists, including Margaret Tucker, Pastor Doug Nicholls, George Patten, Jack Patten, William Cooper and Bill Onus. Early life James was born in Mauritius in 1859. On his birth certificate, James is recorded as being \\"Thomas Shadrach Peersahib\\". His father was denoted as James Peersahib (in other documents, this name is Peersaib). And his mother was Esther née Thomas. The couple were both Tamil, of Indian descent living in Mauritius.George Edward Nelson, Dharmalan Dana: An Australian Aboriginal Man's Search for the Story of His Aboriginal and Indian Ancestors (ANU Press, Canberra, 2014) p257Bringing real learning: South Asian and Islamic Contributions to Australia by Professor Heather Goodall [Speech delivered on Sir Syed Day in Sydney, October 2009], Souvenir Magazine, Aligarh Muslim University Alumni of Australia, 2009:18-21 His father James had been raised a Muslim in Madras and had moved to Mauritius to work as an interpreter to Magistrate Edward Henry Martindale at Wilhelms Plaines. However, following some years of hardship at Black River had asked a local missionary to become a Christian and later became a catechist in the Anglican church.Vincent W Ryan, Mauritius and Madagascar: Journals of An Eight Years' Residence in the Diocese of Mauritius, and of a Visit to Madagascar (London: Sheeley, Jackon, and Halliday, 1864) http://anglicanhistory.org/africa/mu/ryan18642.html As a young man, James lived in Port Louis and was educated at the local school. Even as a teenager, he achieved local stature as an educator of other boys. However, in his later teens he was traumatised, first by the death of his younger brother Samson (in 1875), then the death of his mother shortly afterwards, and by the quick remarriage of his father to Luckheea, which he saw as insensitive. With these misgivings, he decided to make a journey to Australia and began using James as his surname, presumably to honour his father, though he would never see him again. James was fluent in Tamil, French, English and probably, later, Yorta Yorta.Nancy Cato, Mister Maloga (University of Queensland Press, St Lucia, 1976) p97 His interest in medicine and preaching may have come from his mother's family back in Ceylon. His maternal uncle Manuel as well as his cousins Gamiel and William \\"Nesam\\" Paranesam were all deacons of the Anglican Church. So too was his cousin Abishegam Thomas, who was also a medical doctor. Abishegam's family remember that, even as a young teen, \\"Shadrach was a really brilliant student; he was not only brilliant, his English was perfect and he did very good work\\".George Nelson, Robynne Nelson Dharmalan Dana: An Australian Aboriginal Man's Search for the Story of His Aboriginal and Indian Ancestors (ANU Press, Canberra, 2014) p271 Career James arrived in Tasmania in 1879, applying for a teaching job on 23 August, and may have taught there for sometime. He probably then moved to Melbourne to begin studying medicine, but he developed typhus, with subsequent shakes making a future in surgery impossible. With that setback, he found himself greatly attracted to the work of mission - after meeting a great number of Aboriginal evangelists and singers at Brighton in Melbourne on 3 January 1881. The group of 25 Aboriginal Australian men and women had travelled down from the Maloga Mission, and James was introduced to the founder of the mission, Daniel Matthews, by a mutual friend, shipping entrepreneur Charles Crosby. It is recorded that James believed, “God spoke to me that day!”.As recalled by his daughter, Priscilla, recorded in George Nelson, Robynne Nelson Dharmalan Dana: An Australian Aboriginal Man's Search for the Story of His Aboriginal and Indian Ancestors (ANU Press, Canberra, 2014) p271 In the memory of Daniel's son, John Kerr Matthews, \\"the result was that Mr James offered to assist in the mission work without remuneration\\". The missionary accepted his offer. James became permanent assistant to Daniel Matthews when the Maloga School received its recognition as a State School on 1 August 1881, and from then on he received a government salary. Then, when Matthews formally resigned as official teacher at Maloga in August 1883, the department installed \\"The gentle Indian schoolteacher, Thomas James, who was much liked by his pupils...\\".Nancy Cato, Mister Maloga (University of Queensland Press, St Lucia, 1976) p110 In 1883 he was appointed Head Teacher of the school. When the residents of Maloga left the mission to settle at Cummeragunja in 1888, James relocated his school at the reserve. While at Cummeragunja, he worked as a translator of the Yorta Yorta language. He continued to preach and evangelise, not just at Cummeragunja (where he was the Sunday School teacher), but out of town too, to Aboriginal people and to white farmers, in places like Nathalia and Picola.George Nelson, Robynne Nelson Dharmalan Dana: An Australian Aboriginal Man's Search for the Story of His Aboriginal and Indian Ancestors (ANU Press, Canberra, 2014) p187 He would also take Aboriginal people to Sunday school, in order to \\"assist in preaching the Gospel of Salvation to the settlers on the Victorian side of the Murray\\".Jane Carey, Claire McLisky, \\"Creating White Australia\\", Sydney University Press, p. 79 During his career, he had many struggles with authorities, including some mission managers, such as Mr Harris; as well as, at times, the Department of Education and the NSW Board for the Protection of Aborigines (known as APB). His preaching caused concern, as it apparently caused discontent. One sermon, on 7 February 1909, was interpreted as inciting unrest about the removal of the Aboriginal farm blocks. Mrs Harris, the manager's wife, wrote that James was being \\"disloyal to the APB who were trying to bring about friendly relations between the blacks and whites\\". The APB blamed him for unrest at Cummeragunja, and the Board and managers began speaking openly about their fears that he was giving the people ideas – enabling them to write petitions and complain. The APB tried to sack him twice; however, this was not easily achieved, as he led a very successful teaching team, with marks for children, both black and white, being above average for the state. The 1908 departmental report found that the Cummeragunja school had “earnest, capable and enthusiastic teachers. They are thoroughly in sympathy with the whole of the coloured parents and children and their influence is a good one”.George Nelson, Robynne Nelson Dharmalan Dana: An Australian Aboriginal Man's Search for the Story of His Aboriginal and Indian Ancestors (ANU Press, Canberra, 2014) p289 Later life In 1922 James retired from teaching, having been removed as head teacher.George Nelson, Robynne Nelson Dharmalan Dana: An Australian Aboriginal Man's Search for the Story of His Aboriginal and Indian Ancestors (ANU Press, Canberra, 2014) p25 He had hoped that his son, who was his teaching assistant, would be appointed as his replacement. However the New South Wales Government decided to appoint someone else. From there James moved to North Fitzroy, and worked as a herbalist and masseur, specialising in treatment of arthritis.It is recorded that James published a book on Aboriginal culture called Heritage in Stone; however, no copy can currently be found. Death and legacy James died in January 1946 in Shepparton and was buried at Cummeragunja. Over the course of his four decades of teaching James taught many Aboriginal people who later rose to prominence, including Douglas Nicholls (his nephew), William Cooper (his brother-in-law) and Bill Onus. Essentially, the men and women became who went on to be the founders of the Australian Aborigines' League in Melbourne had all came from the \\"scholar’s hut\\" of James. He taught them reading and writing (according to a letter he wrote to Chief Inspector Thomas Pearson on 28 August 1891);George Nelson, Robynne Nelson Dharmalan Dana: An Australian Aboriginal Man's Search for the Story of His Aboriginal and Indian Ancestors (ANU Press, Canberra, 2014) p148 see Koori Heritage Trust. however it seems he also gave these leaders rhetorical skills, an understanding of government and rights. Family In 1885 James married Ada Bethel Cooper, who had been one of the older students at his school when he first attended. She was a Yorta Yorta woman, whose mother, Kitty, was one of the elders of the community. The couple had eight children, including Shadrach Livingstone James, who later became an Aboriginal activist and noted public speaker.

Despite its taxes, Andorra ceased to be a tax haven for its neighboring countries years ago, and for the European Union and OECD recently. In accordance with the mandate established in the 1993 Constitution, tax powers are divided between the Comuns — town councils – and the Government.  History  After the Andorran Constitution came into force, the qualified law delimiting the powers of the Comuns, of November 4, 1993, configures and delimits the powers of the commons within the framework of their self-government. During the period 1994–1996, an important activity of tax development was observed with the creation of five new taxes: * Vehicle ownership rate (1994). * Trademark Office Fees (1995). * Tax on the registration of holders of economic activities (1995). * Court fees (1995). * Tax on the game of bingo (1996). In 2000, the legislator approved the Law on the Tax on the provision of services (ISI), in accordance with the political model of generalizing indirect taxation to all sectors of the economy. It is a framework law that establishes the bases for indirect taxation on services and that, through specific laws, within two years, must be developed in all sectors. In May 2002, the indirect tax on the provision of banking and financial services (currently repealed), and the indirect tax on the provision of Insurance services were approved. The same year, the rate was approved by reason of the notarized public faith service (currently repealed) and the tax on real estate property transfers within the framework of fiscal co- responsibility between the commons and the Government. In 2003, Law 10/2003, of June 27, on communal finances unifies the essential elements of communal taxes and homogenizes the bases of the various tax figures that these local administrations develop through the respective ordinances. On November 3 of the same year, the three specific tax laws were passed that generalize indirect taxation to all sectors of the economy: * Indirect tax on the provision of business and professional services. * Indirect tax on internal production. * Indirect tax on commercial activities. These three new taxes, which entered into force on January 1, 2006, were replaced by the indirect general tax (IGI), which entered into force on January 1, 2013. Government direct taxation begins in 2006 with the entry into force of the capital gains tax on property transfers. It is a direct tax that is taxed on the increase in the value of real estate that is evidenced by the inter vivos, onerous or lucrative transfers of real estate, as well as by the constitutions or transfers of real rights over them. On December 29, 2010, three major taxes were approved in the field of direct taxation. They are: * Law 94/2014, of December 29, on the income tax of non-tax residents * Law 95/2010, of December 29, on Corporation Tax * Law 96/2010, of December 29, on Income Tax from economic activities (in force until December 31, 2014) In 2013, Andorra announced plans to impose an income tax in response to pressure from the European Union.Andorra bows to EU pressure to introduce income tax, The Telegraph, June 2, 2013. The tax was introduced in 2015, at a flat rate of 10%.Individual income tax, Government of Andorra. Also the General Indirect Tax (IGI) was applied. Its introduction allowed replacing the vast majority of existing indirect tax figures that taxed the consumption produced in the territory. In this way, the indirect taxation framework becomes more neutral and efficient for companies and fairer for citizens. In 2014, the Department of Taxes and Borders was created, with the aim of establishing an administrative authority in charge of managing the tax system and the customs system, equipped with human resources and legal mechanisms that allow for management and collection effective income of a tax nature. Finally, on January 1, 2014, the Personal Income Tax (IRPF) came into force, which completes the configuration of the Andorran fiscal framework and introduces a tax system comparable to that existing in other neighboring countries, the European Union and the OECD. The new tax covers all the income that the taxpayer may obtain, regardless of its type and source, also incorporating business income that until then was taxed on income tax from economic activities. * Law 5/2014, of April 24, on the Income Tax of natural persons * Law 42/2014, of December 11, amending Law 5/2014, of April 24, on Personal Income Tax  Communal tax system  The qualified Law delimiting the powers of the commons determines the taxing power of municipalities in relation to taxes: * The traditional tax of \\"foc i lloc\\" (fire and place). * The property tax. * The tax on rental income. * The filing or location tax of commercial, business and professional activities. * The construction tax.

It is a tax composed of sections that are applied on the income tax base, similar to that of neighboring countries. Without going into the many details of the tax and in a simplified way: * From 0 to 24,000 € of income is taxed at 0% * From €24,000 to €40,000 of income the rate is 5% * Any amount over €40,000 of income is required to pay 10% The tax on savings income follow the same regime as the income tax, but the difference in this case is that the first €3,000 of investment income is tax exempt. The rest of income is taxed at 10%. Corporate tax The more relevant tax on corporations in Andorra is the IS or Impost de Societats (IS), and corresponds to a fixed general rate of 10%. There are in addition some bonuses for new corporations: * In the first year, any taxpayer has a 50% reduction in the settlement fee. * For the taxpayers of this tax who are constituted as new entrepreneurs of a new business or professional activity and who have an income of less than 100,000 euros, the applicable tax rate during the first 3 years of activity is:  5% for the part of the tax base between 0 and 50,000 euros.  10% on the basis of remaining taxation. Value added tax On January 1, 2013, Andorra introduced the IGI (Impost General Indirecte), that is the main value added tax and indirect tax, replacing the old sales tax regime. Its general tax rate is 4.5%,http://www.expansion.com/pymes/2016/03/17/56e2f4fbca4741a8028b4650.html (in Spanish) but there are some other rates applied to certain goods and services: * Super reduced rate (0%) for health and CASS services, education, gold investment and certain NGOs services * Reduced rate (1%) for human consumption goods, books, magazines * Special rate (2.5%) for transportation and artistic and culture services * Increased rate (9.5%) for banking and financial services.  Capital gains tax on property transfers (PLV)  When someone want to sell Andorran property to obtain some profit, a capital gains tax will be applied on the real asset. The nominal rate is 15% if the property is sold before the first year, 13% if it is sold in the second year of possession, 10% in the third year of possession and decreases by 1% each year after the third year (so the rate can be 0% in the 12th year). However, an individual can avoid the capital gains tax buying another property before six months of the sale.http://www.nomoretax.eu/living/relocation-to-andorra/ (in English) References * Andorra ","title":"Taxation in Andorra"},{"id":"25117911","text":"The Daughters of Isabella is a spiritual, social and charitable organization that was started as a female auxiliary of the Knights of Columbus.

The hall is of various builds as successor to a 15th-century timber-framed courtyard house that was built near to the present building of which no trace remains. It is a private residence. History Pilkington The Rector of Standish, Roger Standish in 1477 was the last surviving trustee of the estates of Alexander Pilkington of the Pilkington family of Lancashire who had died in 1474 and held the families land in Rivington and Mellor in trust, the original beneficiary being his son Ralph who also died the same year. The trust had been created in 1460 with trustees named as Thurstan Pilkington Chaplain and his brother Thomas, with Ralph his son appointed as his attorney to deliver seisen. He released the estates to the beneficiary being Robert Pilkington, Alexanders grandson on him attaining the age of majority. Roberts ownership of lands in Mellor was challenged legally and physically by his uncle, William De Aynesworth and his son who carried out raids on properties on the estate and harassed the tenants and took numerous costly legal actions and even abducted Robert and took him prisoner, at which time they tried to poison him. Robert Pilkington settled at Rivington where he made immediate improvements to Rivington Hall. recorded in a deed of 1477 between him and Adam Holden to create a cross chamber and two great windows at the hall. The first hall was built of wood and plaster. The chantry at the altar of St Nicholas at the Church of the St Wilfrid, Standish was founded 1478 and records of a memorial once located there recorded that Robert Pilkington had been custodian and chaplain of the chantry giving it a yearly income of six marks. The chantry ended in consequence of the Abolition of Chantries Act 1547. Pilkington painting Roberts eldest son and heir Richard was born in 1488, he married Alice Asshawe daughter of Lawrence Asshawe of Hall on the Hill, Heath Charnock in 1504, he inherited his fathers estates on his death in 1508. Nationally the Reformation and Dissolution of the Monasteries led to significant changes in his time, enclosures also taking place. Richard and Alice had a large family, their two eldest sons were George born 1516 and their second son was James Pilkington, the first Protestant Bishop of Durham, born in the old hall in 1518, a tale has passed down through generations that James two sons, Joshua and Isaac were kidnapped at the hall near the old saw pits in Hall Wood, both died young. Richard improved the local chapel, Rivington Church and in 1536 donated 3 acres of land for use of the priest, he died in 1551 and his wife in 1565 and are interred under the floor of the church, a copy of their memorial 'The Pilkington Painting' is on display there. George the eldest son married Anne daughter of Geoffrey Sharkerly of Chester in 1544, as a wedding gift Richard his father gave the couple New Hall and lands belonging to it, a year after his fathers death on inheriting the hall in 1552 he passed New Hall to his mother Alice for her lifetime. Georges eldest son Robert was born in 1560. George was appointed by letters patent in 1566 as one of the first governors of ' The Free School of Queen Elizabeth in Rivington', he donated land in 1587, the school was founded by his brother the Bishop of Durham, James. George died in 1597, the hall then passed to his son Robert who had married the same year. The problem of the land enclosure had resulted in sixteen cases before the courts during the lifetime of George, more cases continued during the time of ownership by Robert. Robert inherited the hall on the death of his father George in 1597. Robert had been Feodary of Lancashire and farmer of the Queen's mills at Earl Shilton, Leicester from 1592 until his death. He had a legal practice in London where he stayed until 1596, he had served as MP for Clitheroe in 1589, he moved to Gray's Inn 1585. Rivington Hall After the death of Robert his estate was left with debts and to pay them the hall was sold to relatives Robert Lever and Thomas Breres in 1611, the Breres became resident at the hall, whilst New Hall and its land was retained. Andrews / Crompton In 1729 John Andrews bought the Breres' share of the estate. Robert Andrews rebuilt the hall in 1774. After Andrews' death the property passed to his sister Hannah Maria Andrews who had married Robert Fletcher of Liverpool. Their daughter, Lucy married Woodhouse Crompton in 1834. The Tithe Tax in 1850 gives detail of the extent of Rivington Hall in the mid Victorian era, being 32 acres. 20th Century to present The Cromptons remained at the hall by agreement until 1910 made when they sold the estate to William Lever in 1900, Leverhulme sold the Hall, Hall Barn and land to Liverpool Corporation in 1902. Rivington Hall and Hall Barn were used as bases for troops and the Ministry of Food in World War II, the Hall had been left derelict until the intervention of William Salmon, who reinvested the profits from his business there to pay for the work of restoring the Barn Tea Rooms and the hall which by 1953 was considered for demolition. Salmon Catering has held a lease for the property since. The hall is a today a private residence. The Hall is under land registry title number LAN62356, the freehold is held by United Utilities and a lease is held by Salmon Catering, the Hall and adjacent barn tea room is not subject to the Liverpool Corporation Act 1902. Architecture The 15th-century wood and wattle and daub structure was demolished and the hall rebuilt in stone and extended from the end of the 17th century. The oldest part of the hall is dated 1694 WB (William Breres) over a rear door on the west side. The date 1700 and WBM (William Breres and Martha) is on the north wing. The oldest parts of the hall are to the rear where the ground floor is built of sandstone rubble with quoins whilst the upper storey is built of coursed squared sandstone indicating a later date. The oldest parts contain mullion windows. The stables to the east of the house were dated 1713 WBMI (William and Martha Breres and John) and 1732 IAA (John Andrews and Abigail). The date stones are now in the chapelyard of Rivington Unitarian Chapel. The halls west front is a symmetrical red brick, two-storey structure built in the classical Georgian style with five bays and a pedimented centre and stone parapet hiding the roof which has a chimney in each gable. The central doorway, approached by a flight of four stone steps, is flanked by side lights and has a pediment. At ground floor level there are four tall, 15-pane sash windows and on the floor above five shorter 12-pane sashes with splayed heads. The spout heads bear the date 1774 RA (Robert Andrews). The south wing was built in brick in the 19th century and was mostly demolished and rebuilt by Robert Andrews in 1774, incorporating some of the older stone building, with a red-brick Georgian frontage.

Career After a year in Downtown Theatre and another in Youth Theatre, in 1949 he got a job in National Theatre, where he stayed until 1956. His breakthrough role was Imre Madách's Moses, which he had played for 22 years, more than 700 times. On 23 October 1956 he recited Sándor Petőfi's Nemzeti dal at the Petőfi Square in Budapest in front of a crowd of 20,000 people. This was the opening act of a youth protest, which protest in a few hours became a nationwide revolt against the government. Sinkovits became a member of the Hungarian Theatre and Film Association Revolutionary Committee on 30 October. After the revolution was crushed, Sinkovits was banned from acting for a half year for his activities, and his membership in the National Theatre was terminated. Between 1958 and 1963, he worked in the Attila József Theatre. In 1963 he returned to the National Theatre and he became one of its dominant actors for decades. At 4 May 1991 reburial ceremony of Jozsef Cardinal Mindszenty in Esztergom, Sinkovits delivered a powerful rendition of Hungarian poet Mihály Vörösmarty's poem Szózat before the 50,000 mourners in attendance. YouTube video of Mindszenty's reburial (see video at 2:12) Szózat is considered to be a second national anthem of Hungary. Personal life In 1951, Sinkovits married Hungarian actress Katalin Gombos (b. 12 February 1929 Hódmezővásárhely; died 6 November 2012 Budapest). They had two children: Andrew Sinkovits-Vitay and Mariann Sinkovits, both of whom also became actors. Sinkovits and Gombos are buried in the Óbuda cemetery.

Established in the 1820s, the farmstead consists of a farmhouse and six outbuildings situated on the remaining of what was once a antebellum farm. Maden Hall has been designated a century farm and has been placed on the National Register of Historic Places. William Ross II (1790-1865), the son of a Scotch-Irish immigrant, built the Maden Hall farmhouse in 1825, and in subsequent years acquired the surrounding land, much of it given to him by his father-in-law, John Gass. In spite of raids from bushwhackers, the farm survived the U.S. Civil War intact, and after the war the farm was maintained by Ross's children and grandchildren, most of whom made relatively few changes to the farm over several decades. In 1968, former University of Tennessee football standout Len Coffman (1915-2007) and wife Jennie King (a Ross descendant) purchased the farm from King's relatives. The Coffmans' daughter, Carol, is the farm's current owner. Location Maden Hall is situated at the intersection of Kingsport Highway (State Route 93) and Gass Memorial Road, just north of Greeneville. The farm is surrounded by hills on the north, east, and south, and on the west by a valley created by South Fork Roaring Fork Creek (a tributary of Lick Creek). The farmhouse and outbuildings are on the west side of Gass Memorial Road, although the farm includes pastureland and woodland on the north side of the road. History Maden Hall detached kitchen/slave cabin William Ross was born in County Fermanagh in Ireland in 1742 and immigrated with his parents to Virginia in 1759. He served in the American Revolution, and in 1786 received a land grant in Greene County, Tennessee as payment for his service. Ross's son, William Ross II, was born in Greene County in 1790. Scottish immigrant Alexander McAmish settled on what is now the Maden Hall Farm in the late-18th century, and he apparently gave it the name \\"Maden Hall.\\" Around 1825, William Ross II purchased a parcel of land from McAmish, and built the Maden Hall farmhouse shortly thereafter. The Maden Hall property was adjacent to land owned by Ross's father-in-law, prominent Greene County politician John Gass. Gass, one of the Overmountain Men who fought Kings Mountain in 1780, was a delegate to Tennessee constitutional convention in 1796, and established a school and church just west of the modern Maden Hall Farm (Gass Memorial Road connects the two areas). Ross married Gass's daughter, Margaret, in 1813, and in 1835 Gass deeded to Ross a large portion of the property adjacent to Maden Hall. Ross primarily grew wheat, corn, flax, and oats, and raised livestock. By the time of the U.S. Civil War, Ross's Maden Hall holdings consisted of and 12 slaves. In a memoir, Ross's grandson, John Gass Ross, mentioned several of his grandfather's slaves, among them a \\"slave boss\\" known as \\"Old Barney,\\" and two others known as \\"Aunt Sarah\\" and \\"Louis.\\" Ross recalled playing in the cantilever barn with a young slave named \\"Little Jim.\\" Ross also wrote that during the war, his grandfather invited his relatives to live at Maden Hall, as it was self-sustaining and relatively isolated. Bushwhackers raided the farm several times, stealing crops, livestock, and farm tools. Post-Civil War After the death of William Ross II in 1865, Maden Hall passed to his son, David Ross, who sold it to another Ross son, William Ross III (1816-1893), two years later. Upon his death in 1893, William Ross III left Maden Hall to his son, Vincent Ross, who died just four years later. Vincent Ross's widow, Mollie Mays Ross (1857-1941), managed Maden Hall until 1929, and left the farm to her children. In the 1920s, tobacco became the Maden Hall Farm's chief crop. In 1968, Jennie King Coffman (a granddaughter of Mollie Ross) and husband Leonard \\"Len\\" Coffman acquired Maden Hall. Len Coffman played football for the University of Tennessee under Coach Robert Neyland in the late 1930s, and was drafted to play in the NFL in 1940. He later worked as an assistant coach under Bowden Wyatt at the University of Wyoming. The Coffmans made several additions to the Maden Hall house in the 1970s, most notably the addition of a front porch, a patio, and a new kitchen wing. The Coffmans' daughter, Carol, took the necessary steps to have the farm placed on the National Register of Historic Places. Historical structures Farmhouse Rear view of the Maden Hall farmhouse, showing the rear ell wing The Maden Hall farmhouse is a two-story Federal-style brick house with a 1.5-story ell and a 1-story kitchen wing. The main wing of the house measures by , and the ell measures by . The kitchen wing, added to the east side of the house in the 1970s, measures by . The bricks of the original portions of the house were laid in Flemish bond, whereas the bricks of the new kitchen wing were laid in common bond. The house's gable roofs were originally covered with wooden shingles, but these have been replaced by seam metal panels. Around 1910, the interior of the house was damaged by fire, and was replaced with Queen Anne design elements. The interior follows a central hall floor plan, although whether or not this was the original floor plan or a result of renovations after the 1910s fire is uncertain. The main staircase, fireplace mantels, and first-level floor structure were also replaced as a result of the fire. The entrance to the main section of the house is decorated with a five- point star topped by a crescent moon, which may allude to the early Rosses' Mason activities.Richard Doughty, Greeneville: One Hundred Year Portrait (1775–1875) (Greeneville, Tenn.: Doughty, 1975), p. 281. The ell wing originally housed a kitchen, but was converted into a den in the 1970s. Outbuildings Maden Hall Farm outbuildings Maden Hall Farm has six outbuildings considered contributing to the NRHP property: *An 1820s-era by slave cabin and detached kitchen, located almost adjacent to the main house's ell wing. The cabin's walls are made of sawn timber, and the cabin rests on a mixed brick and stone foundation. *An 1820s-era by smokehouse, built of hewn logs connected with half-dovetail notching. *An 1840s-era by cantilever barn. The barn consists of two by cribs built of V-notched hewn logs. A small shed was added to the east side of the barn in 1956. The barn's loft cantilevers about out beyond the cribs, bearing more resemblance to cantilever barn types found in Southwest Virginia than to the great cantilever barns in Sevier and Blount counties in Tennessee. *An 1840s-era by corn crib and shed, built of V-notched hewn logs. The corn crib occupies the northern one-third of the structure. *A 1910s-era by springhouse, originally built over a natural spring that feeds into South Fork Roaring Fork Creek. The springhouse consists of two compartments, one containing a trough originally used for storing perishables, the other allowing easy access to the spring for drinking water. *A 1940s-era by frame hog house, originally used for loading hogs, but later used as a storage shed.

The same year, secondary school enrollment was about 71%; 69% for boys and 74% for girls. The pupil to teacher ratio for primary school was at about 12:1 in 2003; the ratio was about 7:1 for secondary classes. Higher education The University of Andorra was established in July 1997. It has a small enrollment and mostly offers long- distance courses through universities in Spain and France. The majority of secondary graduates who continue their education attend schools in France or Spain. In 2003, about 8% of eligible adult students were enrolled in tertiary programs.

After worked with his father it was assumed that he would be appointed his successor as Head Teacher, however the New South Wales government declined to appoint him to the position. Working life In 1928 James and his family moved to Mooroopna where he worked for Ardmona Fruit Products Co-operative. He was elected as secretary of the local branch of the Food Preservers' Union and was for a time vice-president of the Goulburn district council. Activism Between 1928 and 1955 was honorary secretary of the Aboriginal Progressive Association of Victoria. In this role he was active in lobbying government to improve living conditions for Aboriginal people. James faced bureaucratic opposition due to his mixed-race heritage. Death James died in 1956 of a heart attack in Geelong and was buried in Mooroopna Cemetery.

The covering groups were classified in : for , the covering groups are 2-fold covers except for the alternating groups of degree 6 and 7 where the covers are 6-fold. For example the binary icosahedral group covers the icosahedral group, an alternating group of degree 5, and the binary tetrahedral group covers the tetrahedral group, an alternating group of degree 4.  Definition and classification  A group homomorphism from D to G is said to be a Schur cover of the finite group G if: # the kernel is contained both in the center and the commutator subgroup of D, and # amongst all such homomorphisms, this D has maximal size. The Schur multiplier of G is the kernel of any Schur cover and has many interpretations. When the homomorphism is understood, the group D is often called the Schur cover or Darstellungsgruppe. The Schur covers of the symmetric and alternating groups were classified in . The symmetric group of degree n ≥ 4 has two isomorphism classes of Schur covers, both of order 2⋅n!, and the alternating group of degree n has one isomorphism class of Schur cover, which has order n! except when n is 6 or 7, in which case the Schur cover has order 3⋅n!.  Finite presentations  Schur covers can be described using finite presentations. The symmetric group Sn has a presentation on n−1 generators ti for i = 1, 2, ..., n−1 and relations :titi = 1, for 1 ≤ i ≤ n−1 :ti+1titi+1 = titi+1ti, for 1 ≤ i ≤ n−2 :tjti = titj, for 1 ≤ i < i+2 ≤ j ≤ n−1. These relations can be used to describe two non-isomorphic covers of the symmetric group. One covering group 2\\\\cdot S_n^- has generators z, t1, ..., tn−1 and relations: :zz = 1 :titi = z, for 1 ≤ i ≤ n−1 :ti+1titi+1 = titi+1ti, for 1 ≤ i ≤ n−2 :tjti = titjz, for 1 ≤ i < i+2 ≤ j ≤ n−1. The same group 2\\\\cdot S_n^- can be given the following presentation using the generators z and si given by ti or tiz according as i is odd or even: :zz = 1 :sisi = z, for 1 ≤ i ≤ n−1 :si+1sisi+1 = sisi+1siz, for 1 ≤ i ≤ n−2 :sjsi = sisjz, for 1 ≤ i < i+2 ≤ j ≤ n−1. The other covering group 2\\\\cdot S_n^+ has generators z, t1, ..., tn−1 and relations: :zz = 1, zti = tiz, for 1 ≤ i ≤ n−1 :titi = 1, for 1 ≤ i ≤ n−1 :ti+1titi+1 = titi+1tiz, for 1 ≤ i ≤ n−2 :tjti = titjz, for 1 ≤ i < i+2 ≤ j ≤ n−1. The same group 2\\\\cdot S_n^+ can be given the following presentation using the generators z and si given by ti or tiz according as i is odd or even: :zz = 1, zsi = siz, for 1 ≤ i ≤ n−1 :sisi = 1, for 1 ≤ i ≤ n−1 :si+1sisi+1 = sisi+1si, for 1 ≤ i ≤ n−2 :sjsi = sisjz, for 1 ≤ i < i+2 ≤ j ≤ n−1. Sometimes all of the relations of the symmetric group are expressed as (titj)mij = 1, where mij are non-negative integers, namely mii = 1, mi,i+1 = 3, and mij = 2, for 1 ≤ i < i+2 ≤ j ≤ n−1. The presentation of 2\\\\cdot S_n^- becomes particularly simple in this form: (titj)mij = z, and zz = 1. The group 2\\\\cdot S_n^+ has the nice property that its generators all have order 2.  Projective representations  Covering groups were introduced by Issai Schur to classify projective representations of groups. A (complex) linear representation of a group G is a group homomorphism G → GL(n,C) from the group G to a general linear group, while a projective representation is a homomorphism G → PGL(n,C) from G to a projective linear group. Projective representations of G correspond naturally to linear representations of the covering group of G. The projective representations of alternating and symmetric groups are the subject of the book .  Integral homology  Covering groups correspond to the second group homology group, H2(G,Z), also known as the Schur multiplier. The Schur multipliers of the alternating groups An (in the case where n is at least 4) are the cyclic groups of order 2, except in the case where n is either 6 or 7, in which case there is also a triple cover. In these cases, then, the Schur multiplier is the cyclic group of order 6, and the covering group is a 6-fold cover. :H2(An,Z) = 0 for n ≤ 3 :H2(An,Z) = Z/2Z for n = 4, 5 :H2(An,Z) = Z/6Z for n = 6, 7 :H2(An,Z) = Z/2Z for n ≥ 8 For the symmetric group, the Schur multiplier vanishes for n ≤ 3, and is the cyclic group of order 2 for n ≥ 4: :H2(Sn,Z) = 0 for n ≤ 3 :H2(Sn,Z) = Z/2Z for n ≥ 4  Construction of double covers  The double cover of the alternating group can be constructed via the spin representation that covers the usual linear representation of the alternating group. The double covers can be constructed as spin (respectively, pin) covers of faithful, irreducible, linear representations of An and Sn. These spin representations exist for all n, but are the covering groups only for n≥4 (n≠6,7 for An). For n≤3, Sn and An are their own Schur covers. the corresponding diagram of orthogonal and spin/pin groups. Explicitly, Sn acts on the n-dimensional space Rn by permuting coordinates (in matrices, as permutation matrices). This has a 1-dimensional trivial subrepresentation corresponding to vectors with all coordinates equal, and the complementary (n−1)-dimensional subrepresentation (of vectors whose coordinates sum to 0) is irreducible for n≥4. Geometrically, this is the symmetries of the (n−1)-simplex, and algebraically, it yields maps A_n \\\\hookrightarrow \\\\operatorname{SO}(n-1) and S_n \\\\hookrightarrow \\\\operatorname{O}(n-1) expressing these as discrete subgroups (point groups). The special orthogonal group has a 2-fold cover by the spin group \\\\operatorname{Spin}(n) \\\\to \\\\operatorname{SO}(n), and restricting this cover to A_n and taking the preimage yields a 2-fold cover 2 \\\\cdot A_n \\\\to A_n. A similar construction with a pin group yields the 2-fold cover of the symmetric group: \\\\operatorname{Pin}_\\\\pm(n) \\\\to \\\\operatorname{O}(n). As there are two pin groups, there are two distinct 2-fold covers of the symmetric group, 2⋅Sn±, also called \\\\tilde S_n and \\\\hat S_n.  Construction of triple cover for n = 6, 7  The triple covering of A_6, denoted 3\\\\cdot A_6, and the corresponding triple cover of S_6, denoted 3\\\\cdot S_6, can be constructed as symmetries of a certain set of vector in a complex 6-space. While the exceptional triple covers of A6 and A7 extend to extensions of S6 and S7, these extensions are not central and so do not form Schur covers. This construction is important in the study of the sporadic groups, and in much of the exceptional behavior of small classical and exceptional groups, including: construction of the Mathieu group M24, the exceptional covers of the projective unitary group U_4(3) and the projective special linear group L_3(4), and the exceptional double cover of the group of Lie type G_2(4).  Exceptional isomorphisms  For low dimensions there are exceptional isomorphisms with the map from a special linear group over a finite field to the projective special linear group. For n = 3, the symmetric group is SL(2,2) ≅ PSL(2,2) and is its own Schur cover. For n = 4, the Schur cover of the alternating group is given by SL(2,3) → PSL(2,3) ≅ A4, which can also be thought of as the binary tetrahedral group covering the tetrahedral group. Similarly, GL(2,3) → PGL(2,3) ≅ S4 is a Schur cover, but there is a second non-isomorphic Schur cover of S4 contained in GL(2,9) – note that 9=32 so this is extension of scalars of GL(2,3). In terms of the above presentations, GL(2,3) ≅ Ŝ4. For n = 5, the Schur cover of the alternating group is given by SL(2,5) → PSL(2,5) ≅ A5, which can also be thought of as the binary icosahedral group covering the icosahedral group. Though PGL(2,5) ≅ S5, GL(2,5) → PGL(2,5) is not a Schur cover as the kernel is not contained in the derived subgroup of GL(2,5). The Schur cover of PGL(2,5) is contained in GL(2,25) – as before, 25=52, so this extends the scalars. For n = 6, the double cover of the alternating group is given by SL(2,9) → PSL(2,9) ≅ A6. While PGL(2,9) is contained in the automorphism group PΓL(2,9) of PSL(2,9) ≅ A6, PGL(2,9) is not isomorphic to S6, and its Schur covers (which are double covers) are not contained in nor a quotient of GL(2,9). Note that in almost all cases, S_n \\\\cong \\\\operatorname{Aut}(A_n), with the unique exception of A6, due to the exceptional outer automorphism of A6. Another subgroup of the automorphism group of A6 is M10, the Mathieu group of degree 10, whose Schur cover is a triple cover. The Schur covers of the symmetric group S6 itself have no faithful representations as a subgroup of GL(d,9) for d≤3. The four Schur covers of the automorphism group PΓL(2,9) of A6 are double covers. For n = 8, the alternating group A8 is isomorphic to SL(4,2) = PSL(4,2), and so SL(4,2) → PSL(4,2), which is 1-to-1, not 2-to-1, is not a Schur cover. Properties Schur covers of finite perfect groups are superperfect, that is both their first and second integral homology vanish. In particular, the double covers of An for n ≥ 4 are superperfect, except for n = 6, 7, and the six-fold covers of An are superperfect for n = 6, 7. As stem extensions of a simple group, the covering groups of An are quasisimple groups for n ≥ 5.

It won the 2009 Pulitzer Prize for Biography, with the prize jury describing it as \\"an unflinching portrait of a not always admirable democrat but a pivotal president, written with an agile prose that brings the Jackson saga to life\\". Meacham wrote American Lion drawing in part on previously unavailable documents, including letters, diaries, memorabilia, and accounts from Jackson's intimate circle that had been largely privately-owned for 175 years. Much of the correspondence was found in archives at The Hermitage, Jackson's estate in Nashville, Tennessee. American Lion is not a full-scale account of Jackson's entire life or political career, but rather focuses on his presidency and his domestic arrangements in the White House. American Lion focuses a great deal on the Bank War, the federal tariff on imports, and the Petticoat affair, during which Meacham claimed \\"the future of the American presidency was at stake\\". Meacham believed Jackson represented the best and worst of American character, citing his simultaneous capacity for kindness and cruelty. Of all the early U.S. presidents and Founding Fathers, Meacham believed Jackson was \\"the most like us\\", and had the strongest influence on the modern presidency. In writing American Lion, Meacham said he sought not to whitewash Jackson or \\"all his sins, which are enormous\\", such as his support of slavery and Indian removal. American Lion received generally positive reviews. It was included on The New York Times Book Reviews list of 100 Notable Books of 2008, and was ranked one of the best books of 2008 by The Washington Posts Book World. Critics praised Meacham's writing, the depth of research, Jackson's riveting story, and the placement of Jackson's legacy in a modern context. Mixed or negative reviews accused Meacham of portraying Jackson too positively or spending too much time on political scandals. The book has been read by U.S. Presidents George W. Bush and Donald Trump, and praised by such figures as Mike Pence, Mark Zuckerberg, Bill O'Reilly, Jon Stewart, Eric Cantor, and Tim McGraw. In 2015, HBO announced it was working on a television miniseries adaptation of American Lion starring Sean Penn as Andrew Jackson, but the project stalled after the departure of director Phillip Noyce over reported disagreements with Jackson's depiction. Synopsis 1828 presidential election and death of Rachel Jackson (pictured) immediately afterward. American Lion opens just after Andrew Jackson's victory in the 1828 United States presidential election. Author Jon Meacham writes about the viciousness of the election and the death of Rachel Jackson immediately afterward, which Jackson blames on his attacks by his political enemies during the campaign. The book then touches upon Jackson's early life, including his birth in the Waxhaws region of the Carolinas and his family life. It briefly covers his marriage to Rachel, legal career, move to Nashville, Tennessee, and his military career, particularly his role in the Battle of New Orleans and the part it played in elevating his reputation. The book then segues into the beginning of his political career, his rivalries with Henry Clay and John C. Calhoun, and his loss in the 1824 presidential election despite winning the popular vote, which Jackson regarded as a \\"corrupt bargain\\" by his political enemies. Returning to Jackson's presidency, Meacham defines patronage, the Bank War, the Nullification Crisis, Indian removal, clerical influence in politics, internal improvements, and respect abroad as \\"the questions that would define Jackson's White House years. Meacham wrote that, to many in established Washington, Jackson's arrival \\"signaled the destruction of the rule of the nation in an atmosphere of geniality and gentility\\". By contrast, Meacham wrote that Jackson felt the country was \\"suffering from a crisis of corruption (in) the marshaling of power and influence by a few institutions and interests that sought to profit at the expense of the whole\\". According to the book, Jackson felt the President should \\"use his powers with a firm hand\\", whereas his foes thought of Congress as the government's center of gravity. Meacham wrote that Jackson's most enduring conviction was that, as President, he was acting selflessly in the interest of the nation and of its mass of citizens, and that his own will was the same as the will of the country. Meacham wrote: \\"No institution, he argued, should stand between the people and the presidency. ... No president had spoken in such a way before.\\" conflict with the Second Bank of the United States and its president Nicholas Biddle (pictured) is one of the focal points of American Lion. Meacham focuses a great deal on Jackson's determination to end the Second Bank of the United States, which was presided over by Nicholas Biddle, and which Jackson believed had been manipulated by Clay to assist with John Quincy Adams' election to the presidency in 1824. Jackson regarded the bank as a fundamentally corrupt institution and \\"the embodiment of unfair privilege\\". The book highlights Biddle's challenge to Jackson in pressing for recharter and his attempt to use the influence of the Bank to harm his reelection. It covers Jackson's veto of the charter, attempts by Biddle and Clay to see the veto overridden, and ultimately the decision by the United States House of Representatives in 1834 not to override the veto, ensuring the Bank would not be rechartered. The book also discusses Jackson's role in the removal of Native Americans to lands west of the Mississippi River. Meacham wrote: \\"Jackson believed in removal with all his heart, and by refusing to entertain any other scenario, he was as ferocious in inflicting harm on a people as he often was in defending the rights of those he thought of as the people.\\" As the book recounts, Jackson was not compelled by treaties signed and assurances previously provided to Native Americans; he did not believe that they had title to the land, and he would not tolerate what he felt were competing sovereignties within the nation. It details Jackson's support for the successful passage of the Indian Removal Act, which would ultimately lead to the Trail of Tears. American Lion also highlights Jackson's feelings on what he called the \\"absurd and wicked doctrines of nullification and secession\\", and his confrontation with the state of South Carolina regarding the issue of nullification after the state declared the Tariffs of 1828 and 1832 unconstitutional and therefore void within the state's boundaries. Meacham described the Nullification Crisis as \\"perhaps the most delicate mission of his life – how to preserve the Union without appearing so tyrannical and power-hungry that other Southern states might join with South Carolina, precipitating an even graver crisis that could lead to the secession of several states.\\" The book covers Jackson's support of the Force Bill, which authorized the President to use military forces against South Carolina if necessary, as well as the Compromise Tariff of 1833, which ultimately ended the crisis. Finally, the book focuses on Emily Donelson's role as White House hostess and de facto First Lady of the United States. Meacham wrote: \\"Family life was crucial to Jackson, who had known so little of it growing up, and Emily ensured that the White House was a sanctuary for him.\\" The book also discusses the Petticoat affair, during which Jackson's Secretary of War John Eaton was socially ostracized due to his wife Peggy Eaton's perceived moral failings and lack of sexual virtue. The scandal generated considerable chaos and controversy during Jackson's administration, during which Jackson felt, according to Meacham, that \\"to acknowledge the Eatons was to side with Jackson; to snub the Eatons was to oppose Jackson\\". Meacham wrote that Jackson's interpretation of the Eaton affair was that he was \\"acting for the common democratic good\\", while aristocratic elites were acting against him out of jealousy of his power in Washington. The book highlights how Martin Van Buren endeared himself to Jackson by siding with him during the scandal, and how the Petticoat affair led to resignations from Jackson's cabinet that sparked \\"a national debate over Jackson's first three years of leadership and whether he should have another term\\". Following the conclusion of Jackson's two terms, American Lion ends with a brief synopsis of his post-presidency life, including Emily Donelson's death, and Jackson's own death in 1845. Writing and sources American Lion was written by Jon Meacham, then the editor of Newsweek magazine. Jon Meacham was the editor of Newsweek magazine at the time that American Lion was released. It was the third book he wrote, following Franklin and Winston: An Intimate Portrait of an Epic Friendship (2003) and American Gospel: God, the Founding Fathers, and the Making of a Nation (2006). Jonathan Karp, an editor at Random House, was the first to suggest Andrew Jackson as a subject to Meacham. The book took about five years to write, with Meacham drawing in part on previously unavailable documents, including letters from Jackson's intimate circle that had been largely privately-owned for 175 years. Meacham said he was \\"surprised, delightfully so\\" by the number of new sources that emerged in the course of his research, which he said \\"provide hitherto unknown details about a lost world that foreshadowed and shaped our own\\". Most of the previously unpublished correspondence was found in archives at The Hermitage, Jackson's estate in Nashville, Tennessee. Among them were unpublished letters in the Benjamin and Gertrude Caldwell Collection, which were housed at the Hermitage. Meacham was also given access to a private collection of letters kept by Mrs. John Lawrence Merritt, as well as John Donelson's collection at Nashville's Cleveland Hall. This Cleveland Hall collection included unpublished diaries, and about 60 to 70 previously unreleased letters, including several from Andrew Donelson and Andrew Jackson Jr. Meacham described the Cleveland Hall, Merritt, and Caldwell letters in particular as \\"critical\\" to his book. The Merritt letters included new details about Emily Donelson's role in the life of the White House, as well as the fact that John Henry Eaton considered resigning from Jackson's administration in the spring of 1829. Meacham said this was particularly notable because, had he resigned, it might have preserved John C. Calhoun's viability as a presidential successor to Jackson and changed the course of Jackson's first term. The Merritt and Caldwell letters also shed new light on the central role Emily and Andrew Donelson played in the early lives of Andrew and Rachel Jackson, and included allusions to such important issues during Jackson's presidency as the tariff, nullification, the Bank war, and the efforts by those seeking to succeed Jackson in 1836. The Donelson letters offered details about the harshness of partisan politics of the 1830s, life in the White House and the Jackson circle in the South, and the extent of slave trading in Jackson's family during the White House years. They also \\"examine how Jackson's deliberations on the crucial issues of the day played out against this background of weddings, births, and White House frolics\\". While writing the book Meacham developed a relationship with the Donelson family, which helped gain an immediacy in writing about events of the early 1800s. Meacham said: \\"My lens was, 'What was it like to walk through those hallways?' This is the first time we've known what it was like to live in the White House in Andrew Jackson's time.\\" Meacham was also given access to private collection of letters and memorabilia held by Scott Ward, a descendant of Andrew Jackson Jr. living in Atlanta. Among those letters was the reply of Thomas Marshall to the last letter of Jackson's life. Other sources for American Lion included unpublished letters and diary entries from the papers of John Quincy Adams and his wife Louisa, as well as letters from British, Dutch, and French diplomatic archives, which provided observations on the political and social scenes of Washington, D.C. Among these was a note from Richard Wellesley, 1st Marquess Wellesley discussing the risk of the union's collapse during the crisis of nullification. Meacham also accessed letters from Treasury Secretary Samuel Ingham detailing a near gunfight with John Henry Eaton. Maria Campbell shared with Meacham The Memoirs of Mrs. Eliza Williams Chotard Gould, a private and unpublished account by Campbell's great-great-great-grandmother which included eyewitness accounts of Jackson in New Orleans just before and after his military victory over the British. Meacham received guidance from several historians during the course of writing American Lion, including Arthur M. Schlesinger Jr., the author of The Age of Jackson; Sean Wilentz; and Daniel Feller, editor of The Papers of Andrew Jackson and author of The Public Lands in Jacksonian Politics and The Jacksonian Promise: America, 1815–1840. Meacham also acknowledged the influence Jackson scholars James Parton and Robert V. Remini had over his work on American Lion. First Lady of the United States Laura Bush and Jean Becker, chief of staff to former President George H. W. Bush, allowed Meacham to tour the private quarters of the White House as part of his research, and Meacham also visited the United States Capitol. Meacham said his personal opinion of Jackson had improved by the end of the writing process, saying: \\"There are two ways to write a biography. One is to be utterly hostile. The other is to be empathetic. I chose to be empathetic.\\" Themes In American Lion, Jon Meacham described Andrew Jackson as representative of both the best and worst of American character. Meacham said he named book American Lion because he felt lions make both the best allies and the worst enemies, which he felt captured the contradictions at Jackson's core: \\"If he were on your side, he would do all he could to protect you. If he believed you a foe, then he was a ferocious and merciless predator.\\" Meacham believed Jackson represented the best and worst of American character, citing his simultaneous capacity for kindness and cruelty. Meacham believed of all the early U.S. presidents and Founding Fathers, Jackson was \\"the most like us\\", and the duality of Jackson's nature is one shared by America itself. To that end, Meacham believed an understanding of Jackson leads to an understanding of the capacity Americans have for cognitive dissonance, particularly in tolerating inequality and injustice while convincing oneself that they are in fact striving for those virtues. American Lion is not a full-scale account of Jackson's entire life or political career, but rather focuses on his presidency and his domestic arrangements in the White House. Meacham said he did not seek to write an academic study of Jackson's preidency because he believed that territory had already been covered by multiple biographies and historical accounts, and instead he \\"attempted to paint a biographical portrait of Jackson and of many of the people who lived and worked with him in his tumultuous years in power\\". Through his forceful character and aggressive actions in the office, Meacham believes Jackson influenced the modern presidency more than any chief executive that came before him. In particular, Meacham believed Jackson helped shaped such aspects of modern American politics as popular campaigning techniques, media manipulation, and engaging citizens in the narrative of politics while simultaneously governing. Meacham wrote: \\"All of these features flowered in the age of Jackson, and they all feel very contemporary.\\" Ann Robinson of The Oregonian wrote that the book illustrates how Jackson has changed the U.S. presidency in ways that continue to resonate in modern times, particularly in his expansive claims for the executive branch's inherent constitutional powers, such as the veto. Author Robert Roper noted that American Lion largely does not contest the mainstream interpretation of Jackson's story, though journalist and critic Janet Maslin said the book \\"dispenses with the usual view of Jackson as a Tennessee hothead and instead sees a cannily ambitious figure determined to reshape the power of the presidency during his time in office\\". According to Maslin, American Lion portrays Jackson as more calculating than he is often considered to be, and describes how Jackson's rivals like Henry Clay and John C. Calhoun often misunderstood his true agenda because they could not see past his confrontational style. Likewise, author and historian Douglas Brinkley noted that most historians tends to disregard Jackson's intellectual abilities, but that later chapters of American Lion in particular focus on this aspect of Jackson and \\"separate Jackson from his rough-and-tumble reputation and to present him in a more multi-dimensional way\\". Meacham said he did not want American Lion to whitewash Jackson or \\"all his sins, which are enormous\\", such as his support of slavery and Indian removal. Meacham wrote: \\"In the saga of the Jackson presidency, one marked by both democratic triumphs and racist tragedies, we can see the American character in formation and in action.\\" Meacham believed \\"the tragedy of Jackson's life is that a man dedicated to freedom failed to see liberty as a universal, not a particular, gift.\\" Conversely, Meacham believed one of the triumphs of Jackson's life was that he held together a country which ultimately – albeit belatedly – extended its protections and promises to all. Meacham felt that progress would not have been possible if Jackson had not thwarted the divisive forces of his day, writing: \\"By saving the Union, Jackson kept the possibility of progress alive.\\" Author and The Seattle Times book reviewer Steve Weinberg argued American Lion presents Jackson through the great man theory, which believes the character of the ruler determines events more than events wash over the ruler. However, Weinberg also noted that Meacham \\"wisely dilutes\\" the great man theory by emphasizing Jackson's chief advisers and family. American Lion tells what Roper called the \\"human-interest saga of the Jackson circle\\", with a heavy focus on the people closest to him during his presidency, such as Andrew Jackson Donelson and Emily Donelson. Through his portrayal of Jackson's reaction to those with whom he disagreed during the Petticoat affair, Maslin said American Lion \\"convey(s) the stubbornness with which Jackson turned seemingly personal conflicts among the women in his life into matters of public concern\\". According to The New York Times writer Andrew Cayton, American Lion presents Jackson as a man to whom \\"personal loyalty was always the supreme law\\", and as someone who considers his personal enemies to be enemies of the nation itself. In the book, Meacham argued that because Jackson was orphaned, and never had any biological children himself, he spent much of his life forming substitute families that he would protect like a father: first with the soldiers who served under him, and then later with his surrogate son Andrew Jackson Donelson. American Lion also portrays Jackson as taking a very paternalistic approach to the presidency itself, noting Jackson's words that he looked at his citizens \\"with the feelings of a father\\". Maslin wrote: \\"In Mr. Meacham's view, Jackson’s paternalism was sincere: no president may have felt more literally like the father of his country.\\" Jackson's view of himself as a paternal role even extended to his treatment of Native Americans, with him viewing his removal policies as a sensible and proactive step to move them out of harm's way and protect them. Publication and sales Prior to the publication of American Lion, Pulitzer Prize-winning author and historian Daniel Feller read the manuscript and fielded questions from Meacham about the work. Historians Walter Isaacson and Doris Kearns Goodwin also read the manuscript, and different sections of it were reviewed in advance of publication by such historians and scholars as Catherine Allgor, H. W. Brands, Andrew Burstein, Mark Cheathem, Donald B. Cole, William W. Freehling, Richard Latner, John F. Marszalek, and Matthew Warshauer. Meacham's book was published within five years of the release of several books about Andrew Jackson by such authors as Sean Wilentz, Daniel Walker Howe and Andrew Burstein. Robert Roper, an author who reviewed American Lion for the Los Angeles Times, said Meacham's book did not contest the portrayals of Jackson presented in those books, but rather it \\"selectively enriches that version with graceful new readings of some formerly overlooked primary materials\\". American Lion debuted at #2 on The New York Times bestseller's list, and remained on the list for more than six months. According to Publishers Weekly, American Lion sold 463,678 copies domestically in the calendar year 2018. Following the book's publication, Meacham was named to the board of directors of The Hermitage, and was also named a trustee of the Andrew Jackson Foundation. An audiobook version of American Lion, narrated by Richard McGonagle, was released by Random House Audio on November 11, 2008. Reception American Lion received generally positive reviews. It was included on The New York Times Book Reviews list of 100 Notable Books of 2008, and was ranked one of the best books of 2008 by The Washington Posts Book World. The Posts blog The Fix also included it on its list of best presidential biographies. American Lion was featured on The New York Times list of \\"17 Great Books About American Presidents\\", and on Amazon's list (compiled by various book editors) of \\"100 Biographies and Memoirs to Read in a Lifetime\\". Author and historian Douglas Brinkley called it \\"the most readable single-volume biography ever written of our seventh president\\". The New York Times literary critic Janet Maslin called it a \\"carefully analytical biography (which) looks past the theatrics and posturing to the essential elements of Jackson's many showdowns\\". Andrew Cayton, also of The New York Times, called the book \\"enormously entertaining, especially in the deft descriptions of Jackson’s personality and domestic life in his White House\\", but felt Meacham has missed an opportunity to reflect on the nature of American populism as personified by Jackson. Presidential biographer Doris Kearns Goodwin called American Lion \\"a beautifully written, absolutely riveting story\\", describing Meacham as \\"a master storyteller (who) interweaves the lives of Jackson and the members of his inner circle to create a highly original work\\". Historian Michael Beschloss called it \\"a spellbinding, brilliant and irresistible journey (that) shows us how the old hero transformed both the American presidency and the nation he led.\\" Journalist and author Allen Barra called American Lion probably the \\"fullest and most balanced biography\\" of Andrew Jackson. In a review for Los Angeles Times, Robert Roper called it an engaging book that enriches the story of Andrew Jackson, and \\"comes most startlingly alive when he tells the old, amazing story of the ill-educated rube who invented modern politics\\". Deirdre Donahue of USA Today called it \\"marvelously readable\\", and said Meacham \\"displays his gift for illustrating how personal bonds and personal experience influence history\\". In a review for Rocky Mountain News, Dan Danbom called American Lion a readable account of an interesting and colorful historical figure, and while he felt Meacham could have provided more historical context in parts, he believes the parallels between Jackson's time and contemporary politics made it recommended reading. The Washington Post reporter Justin Wm. Moyer identified American Lion as the definitive Jackson biography. Steve Weinberg of The Seattle Times said Meacham \\"deserves credit for modernizing Jackson so that a new generation of readers might discover him\\". Erik J. Chaput of The Providence Journal called American Lion an \\"engaging and oftentimes brilliant study\\" of Jackson, and felt it was at its best during its analysis and discussion of the Petticoat Affair. He added: \\"No book published on Jackson in recent memory is more illuminating about his life, his family, his political ideology, and his religious beliefs\\". The Journal writer Trevor Seigler said the book should go a long way toward correcting misconceptions about Jackson, writing: \\"You'll certainly never see the $20 bill the same way again.\\" In a review for New York Journal of Books, author and poet J. W. Nicklaus called American Lion a skillfully rendered biography that reads like a novel rather than a dry historical account, and he complimented Meacham for collating such a vast volume of information into an accessible biography. Dean Poling of The Valdosta Daily Times called it an excellent biography \\"in prose that reads like a novel\\". In a review for The Manhattan Mercury, Ed Horne called American Lion impressive in scope and \\"of textbook quality, but still a lively read of a crucial era of American history\\". St. Louis Post-Dispatch book reviewer Myron A. Marty called American Lion a \\"elegantly written, thoroughly researched book\\", as well as \\"a paean to Jackson\\", writing that Meacham \\"makes no attempt to conceal his boundless admiration for the man and his accomplishments\\". He felt Meacham spent too much time on the scandals and political infighting from Jackson's administration, but felt this imbalance was \\"countered by Meacham's sensitive portrayal of Jackson's interactions with members of his family\\". Other reviews were more mixed. Jill Lepore of The New Yorker called American Lion \\"engrossing\\" but felt it was too admiring of Jackson, arguing it did not assign Jackson enough blame for the Panic of 1837 that ensued nine weeks after his Presidency. Ann Robinson of The Oregonian reviewed the book positively, but said Meacham examines the Petticoat affair \\"in somewhat tedious detail\\", and felt Meacham's attempts to humanize Jackson \\"with tales of his visits to orphans or of his fondness for children and his enduring love for his wife\\" were of limited success. Joe Pompeo of The New York Observer felt the second half of the book was the most interesting because of the focus on the Eaton affair and because the issues Jackson tackled in his second term were themselves more interesting. However, he expressed surprise that the book so rarely turns to life outside Washington: \\"The people, for all their centrality to Jackson's administration, are also the most notable omission in Mr. Meacham's account.\\" Adera Causey of Chattanooga Times Free Press called Meacham a \\"solid writer (who) seamlessly explicates complicated political issues\\", and presents Jackson's story in an approachable format. However, she said he spent too much time on the Eaton affair and could have devoted more attention to such issues as the handling of Native American land rights, slavery, and the unique roles of church and state. The Washington Post columnist Michael Gerson called the book \\"brilliant in everything except its reverence for its subject\\". Alex Beam, columnist for The Boston Globe, was very critical of American Lion, saying he attempted to portray Jackson too positively, and \\"trafficks in treacly legends\\", and calling the book \\"laughable\\" and \\"piffle\\". Beam wrote: \\"Meacham is a smooth writer and I can't fault him for seeking the shortest possible path to the bank, penning triumphalist, jingoistic hogwash\\". An AudioFile review of the American Lion audiobook complimented Richard McGonagle's vocal delivery, which it said improved upon the \\"sometimes chatty and unabashedly pro-Jackson history\\" presented in the narrative itself. American Lion was read by U.S. President George W. Bush, according to his advisor Karl Rove. U.S. President Donald Trump, who maintains that he does not read many books, has claimed to have read American Lion. Others who have voiced enjoyment of the book include U.S. Vice President Mike Pence, Facebook co-founder Mark Zuckerberg, former House Majority Leader Eric Cantor, former The Daily Show host Jon Stewart, and former White House Deputy Press Secretary Raj Shah. Political commentator Bill O'Reilly complimented the book, calling it a \\"fair assessment\\" of Jackson and saying it deserved the Pulitzer Prize. Nashville Mayor John Cooper has called it his favorite book, and country music singer Tim McGraw has called it one of his favorites. Tim Walch, a historian and former director of the Herbert Hoover Presidential Library and Museum in West Branch, Iowa, included American Lion in his 2015 list of books that all the U.S. presidential candidates should read, and it was the Buffalo News Book Club selection of February 2010. Actor Benjamin Walker read American Lion as part of his preparation to play Andrew Jackson in the rock musical Bloody Bloody Andrew Jackson; he called it a \\"great book\\". When Meacham first sought to write Destiny and Power (2015), a biography of President George H. W. Bush, Bush said he was intimidated because he felt he was a very different figure than Andrew Jackson as portrayed in the book, saying: \\"It is a little overwhelming to think that I would be following a lion.\\" Awards and honors American Lion received the Pulitzer Prize for Biography. When the Pulitzer Prize jury awarded the book in 2009, the judges described it as \\"an unflinching portrait of a not always admirable democrat but a pivotal president, written with an agile prose that brings the Jackson saga to life\\". American Lion was also nominated for a 2008 Los Angeles Times Book Prize for Best Biography, losing to Ida: A Sword Among Lions, the Paula Giddings biography of African-American investigative journalist Ida B. Wells. Adaptations Actor Sean Penn had been expected to star in and co-produce a television adaptation of American Lion before the project stalled. In December 2015, HBO announced it was working on a six-hour television miniseries based upon the book, also to be called American Lion, starring Sean Penn as Andrew Jackson. It would have been Penn's first major television role. The project was developed by Lionsgate Television, with the script written by Doug Miro and Carlo Bernard, who later co-created of the television series Narcos. Miro and Bernard were to serve as executive producers along with Penn and Matt Jacobson, Head of Market Development for Facebook, which would have been his first producing credit. Jacobson optioned the rights for American Lion after reading the book in 2012: \\"I saw a lot of analogies with what is happening now and felt the story needed to be told.\\" The Jackson biography by historian Robert V. Remini was to provide additional source material. It was the first series order at HBO for Lionsgate Television. Director Phillip Noyce became attached to the project, and it was scheduled to go into production the summer of 2016, with a planned release in 2017. But Noyce left the project in May 2016, reportedly over disagreements with how to depict some of the more negative aspects of Jackson's presidency, though The Hollywood Reporter quoted a source who claimed Noyce was let go for not providing a production end date. The project stalled after that and few details have emerged since.

It originally aired on January 11, 2010. The episode features a fantasy musical number, \\"Nothing Suits Me Like a Suit\\", performed by Neil Patrick Harris, which was nominated for the Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Original Music and Lyrics.  Plot  Future Ted tells the kids about the time he almost met their mother. Leaving class, Ted confiscates alcohol from fraternity brothers and shares it with the woman they were propositioning, Cindy (Rachel Bilson), a Ph.D. student roughly Ted's age. He asks her out and learns that Cindy has serious issues with her roommate (whom Future Ted reveals to be the Mother) with whom her dates keep falling in love. Ted promises Cindy to never fall in love with her roommate (\\"Oops,\\" says Future Ted). Throughout the date, Cindy complains about her roommate and her odd habits which Ted secretly thinks are awesome. After the date, Cindy tells Ted she cannot see him again, not wanting to risk her scholarship or Ted's teaching career. However, Ted does not want to miss a chance at love and returns to Cindy's apartment to persuade her to go out again. Ted picks three items from the room to show how much they have in common, but it turns out they are all connected to her roommate. Frustrated that Ted is already more compatible with her roommate, Cindy tells him to go. Ted catches a glimpse of the roommate's leg as he leaves, and forgets to take the yellow umbrella he had brought with him which returns to the possession of the Mother. Barney seeks to bed MacLaren's attractive new bartender (Stacy Keibler), but after dating insensitive Wall Street losers she does not like men in suits. For a while he dresses casually, convincing the bartender she misjudged him. However, Barney exhibits withdrawal, becoming overly affectionate of a suit Marshall wears, and sneaking to the bathroom to wear a suit. Barney accidentally rips the jacket which is damaged beyond repair, though his tailor, Tim Gunn, transplants the buttons to save another suit and Barney cremates the remains. With the urn of suit ashes and his real tears for his lost suit, Barney convinces the bartender to go to his apartment, where she accidentally opens his suit closet. She forces him to choose between her and his suits, and Barney imagines himself breaking into song, professing his love of suits—only to choose her at the end of the song when he realizes \\"she is pretty hot.\\" He tells her she is more important than the suits and they will go first thing in the morning. As they fall into bed, he whispers, \\"You guys are fine\\" to his suits, which move slightly as if breathing a sigh of relief. Meanwhile, Lily, Marshall, and Robin argue about the bartender's attractiveness. Robin suggests the location amplifies natural beauty and gets behind the bar but is soon kicked out. Marshall insists the bartender is not that attractive, saying Lily is the most beautiful woman he has ever met. Lily, clearly impressed by the bartender herself, tries to get Marshall to say she is not as beautiful as the bartender, and eventually even implies that the bartender is better looking than Marshall, upsetting him a little.  Production  Executive producer and co-creator Craig Thomas revealed Neil Patrick Harris will be performing a \\"big-ass musical\\" number as the culmination of a big Barney story. Thomas has said, \\"There is some serious Mother action in episode 100\\" revealing only a small teaser about the episode. \\"Nothing Suits Me Like a Suit\\" was backed by sixty-five dancers and accompanied by a fifty-piece orchestra.  Casting  Rachel Bilson was cast for an undisclosed role in episode 100 of the show, although her representative said she is only contracted for one episode. Tim Gunn of Project Runway brings his sartorial skills to help out Barney in a time of need. Craig Thomas explains \\"Tim is basically like Barney's ER physician for a serious suit emergency\\" and serves as a personal tailor and fashion consultant to fix a \\"Suit Catastrophe\\" for Barney. Speaking to Entertainment Tonight, Neil Patrick Harris said that they \\"never had a guest star on the show that people responded to more than Tim Gunn\\" and that even the cast and crew were asking for his autograph. Alyson Hannigan described him as \\"more popular than Britney Spears.\\" Although unofficial, on the Season 5 DVD commentary of the episode, it has been expressed that they hope to have Gunn return as a possible recurring character. Former wrestling diva Stacy Keibler guest stars as Karina, a bartender in MacLaren's. The writers describe her as \\"the hottest bartender in the world\\" and she gives the episode its title, as she forces Barney to choose between his suits and getting the girl. Her three previous ex-boyfriends were all suit wearers, and Barney cannot get with her without giving up his suits.  Reception  Donna Bowman of The A.V. Club rated the episode with a grade A, describing the 100th episode as one of the best the show has ever produced. She describes the episode as appealing to fans in a way that doesn't exclude other viewers, noting the quality of the writing and editing, the voiceover being used to great effect, and advancing the storyline for all the characters. Brian Zoromski of IGN gave the episode 9.8 out of 10, and called the milestone episode \\"a giant thank you to the fans\\" with plot advancement on the Mother topped by a lavish musical production. \\"If anyone ever doubted whether the writers could believably pull off this meandering, long-winded story of how a father met his kids' future mother without dropping the pieces, this episode shows that the How I Met team has a strong grasp of how everything fits together.\\" Cindy McLennan of Television Without Pity rated the episode with a grade A. Nickolas Clague of The New York Times gave the episode 9.2 out of 10.

Although Malta had formally ceased to be part of the Kingdom of Sicily only since 1814 following the Treaty of Paris, Italian irredentism in Malta was mainly significant during the Italian Fascist era.  Italy and Malta before 1814  Map of Malta in the 16th century, when Italian was declared the official language by the Knights of Malta Until the end of the 18th century Malta's fortunes—political, economic, religious, cultural—were closely tied with Sicily's. Successive waves of immigration from Sicily and Italy strengthened these ties and increased the demographic similarity. Italian was Malta's language of administration, law, contracts and public records, Malta's culture was similar to Italy's, Malta's nobility was originally composed of Italian families who had moved to Malta mainly in the 13th century and the Maltese Catholic Church was suffragan of the Archdiocese of Palermo. There were minor and subtle differences, however. In the early 15th century Malta was incorporated directly into the Sicilian crown following an uprising which led to the abolishment of the County of Malta. Domestic governance was thus left to the Università and the Popular Council, early forms of representative local government. The Maltese language, the creation of the Diocese of Malta as well as the granting of Malta to the Knights Hospitaller in 1530 were developments which started to give a distinct character to Maltese culture and history. Following a brief French occupation (1798–1800) the British took military control of Malta even though it was still formally part of the Kingdom of Sicily. The initial intention - expressed in the Treaty of Amiens - was to re- establish the \\"status quo ante\\" returning Malta to the Kingdom of the Two Sicilies, but British interests in the Mediterranean changed it abruptly. So Malta became a British Crown Colony in 1813 even if with diplomatic protests from southern Italian authorities, which was confirmed a year later through the Treaty of Paris.  Italian culture in Malta between 1814 and the Fascist era  Cultural changes were few even after 1814. In 1842, all literate Maltese learned Italian while only 4.5% could read, write and/or speak English.Brincat, Giuseppe. \\"Malta. Una storia linguistica\\".Introduction However, there was a huge increase in the number of Maltese magazines and newspapers in Italian language during the 1800s and early 1900s,Italian magazines in Malta during the 1800s (in Italian) so as a consequence the Italian was understood (but not spoken fluently) by more than half the Maltese people before WW1. The Sette Giugno monument, symbol of the pro-Italian Maltese. In 1878, a Royal Commission (the Rowsell-Julyan-Keenan Commission) recommended in its report the Anglicisation of the educational and judicial systems. While the judicial system remained predominantly Italian until the 20th century, teaching of the English language started to be enforced in State schools at the expense of Italian. In 1911, English overtook Italian as the secondary language after Maltese, spoken by 13.1% of the population compared to 11.5% for Italian. The Royal Commission's report also had significant political impact. Supporters and opponents organised themselves into a Reform and Anti-Reform parties which, apart from being the forerunners of the present day two main political parties in Malta, assumed respectively the anglophile and italophile imprint (and also, subsequently, pro-colonial and anti-colonial policies) that were to characterise them for decades to come. Sette Giugno, a popular revolt in Malta in 1919, was later considered in fascist Italy as the beginning of the \\"active\\" Italian irredentism in Malta. This commemoration (official since 1986) is in remembrance of the riots of 1919 when the Maltese population revolted against the British government to obtain some form of representative government. Four people died when fire was opened on the protesters.  Fascist era and World War II  Tri-lingual voting document for the later cancelled 1930 elections in Malta Villa Gloria by Alberto La Ferla in Ta' Xbiex, in Stile Littorio with prominent fasci-like columns Enrico Mizzi (Malta's Prime Minister in 1950) was jailed in 1940 for his \\"pro-Italian irredentism\\" opinions. The Fascists invested heavily in promoting Italian culture in Malta. They were making overtures to a minority who not only loved Italy's language but also saw Malta as a geographical extension of the Italian mainland. Malta was described as \\"the extreme end of Italian soil\\" (Senator Caruana Gatto who represented the nobility in the Maltese in 1923). The battle, however, was still being fought in largely cultural terms, as the \\"Language Question\\" on the role of Italian in education. This led to the revoking (the second) of the Maltese Constitution in 1934 over the Government's budgetary vote for the teaching of Italian in elementary schools. Italian was eventually dropped from official language status in Malta in 1934, its place being taken by Maltese. Italian ceased to be taught at all levels of education and the language of instruction at the University of Malta and the Law Courts. In 1935 there were manifestations against all these decisions, promoted by the Maltese fascists: the Nationalist Party declared that most of the Maltese population was supporting directly or indirectly the Italian Maltese's struggle. But when Italy entered the war on the side of the Axis powers and aerial bombardments of Malta began, what little interest in Italian irredentism that existed in Malta was lost. The colonial authorities however took precautions: in 1940 they interned and eventually deported to Uganda 49 italophile Maltese including the leader of the Nationalist Party, Enrico Mizzi. Other 700 Maltese with ideals linked to the Italian irredentism in Malta were sent to concentration camps in central AfricaArticle in Italian about Borg Pisani, in which many of the 700 Maltese irredentists are named () A number of Maltese living in Italy participated in fascist organizations and joined the Italian military forces during World War II. Among them were Carmelo Borg Pisani, Antonio Cortis, Paolo Frendo, Ivo Leone Ganado, Roberto Mallia, Manuele Mizzi, Antonio Vassallo, Joe d’Ancona and Carlo Liberto. Carmelo Borg Pisani attempted to enter Malta during the war (Operation Herkules), but was captured and executed as an alleged spy in November 1942. He received the Gold Medal of Military Valor, the highest Italian military award, by King Victor Emmanuel III a few days after his death. Requests have been made by his family and the Italian government to exhume his body and give it a burial outside prison grounds, which request has never been acceded to. Benito Mussolini called him a \\"Maltese Martyr\\" and created in his honor in Liguria the Battaglione Borg Pisani in November 1943, in which other Maltese irredentists fought.  After World War II  Since World War II, there have been no calls for Italian irredentism in Malta. Enrico Mizzi became Malta's Prime Minister in 1950, but never denied his past when he promoted the union of Malta to Italy: he defined himself as \\"a man without stain and without fear\\" (in Italian : \\"Uomo senza macchia e senza paura\\")Enrico Mizzi declared in 1949, just before being elected Prime Minister: \\"I hope that when I pass from this life to become a memory to posterity I hope no one will slander me... for party reasons.... As I had been declared by the Nationalist Party some thirty years ago, I am still, thank God, before the Party, before the people, and above all else before my own conscience 'senza macchia e senza paura'.\\" (Legislative Assembly Debates, Sitting No 8, 17 March 1949, p.397) See also * Italian Maltese * Carmelo Pisani * Enrico Mizzi  Notes   References  * Attard, Joseph.

Morgan (March 3, 1919 – December 16, 1980) was an American tennis player, coach and athletic director. He was associated with athletics at UCLA for more than 40 years. He played four years of varsity tennis at UCLA from 1938-1941 and served as the school's head tennis coach from 1949-1966, leading the Bruins to eight NCAA Men's Tennis Championships. He also served as UCLA's athletic director from 1963-1979, a period during which the university won 30 NCAA championships, including ten NCAA Men's Basketball Championships. Biography Morgan was born in Newcastle, Oklahoma, and played football, basketball, tennis and baseball at Cordell High School in Cordell, Oklahoma. Morgan began his lifelong association with UCLA as a student in the late 1930s. He was a four-year letterman on UCLA's tennis team, and was team captain in 1941. During World War II, Morgan served in the U.S. Navy and was the commander of a torpedo boat in the Pacific Theatre of Operations. In 1946, Morgan returned to UCLA as assistant tennis coach under William C. Ackerman. He took over as the head tennis coach in 1949, a position he held until 1966. UCLA won eight NCAA team championships while Morgan was the men's tennis coach—1950, 1952, 1953, 1954, 1956, 1960, 1961, and 1965. Morgan's championship teams at UCLA included individual champions, including Edith Sigourney, Arthur Ashe, and Charles Pasarell, and outstanding players such as Mike Franks, Mike Green, Allen Fox, and Larry Nagler. He was named to the ITA Collegiate Tennis Hall of Fame in 1983. In 1963, Morgan was given the additional responsibility as UCLA's athletic director. He stepped down as tennis coach in 1966, but continued to serve as UCLA's athletic director until 1979. During Morgan's 16 years as UCLA's athletic director, he is credited with \\"revitaliz[ing] the sports program, catapult[ing] Bruin teams into the national spotlight, and ultimately redefin[ing] UCLA athletics as a model looked to by universities across the country.\\" During his tenure as athletic director, UCLA won 30 NCAA championships—ten in basketball, seven in volleyball, six in tennis, four in track and field, and three in water polo. Morgan hired Tommy Prothro as football coach, and the Bruins football teams went to four bowl games, including two Rose Bowls, during Morgan's tenure as athletic director. Morgan also oversaw the completion of Pauley Pavilion and the construction of Drake Stadium, Spaulding Field and a boathouse for crew in Marina del Rey. Morgan was known for his competitive nature and a personality that some described as \\"difficult, even arrogant.\\" In his early years as UCLA's athletic director, he sat on the bench with John Wooden during basketball games and was known to vilify officials from the bench. Morgan's outbursts reportedly resulted in a rule change banning athletic directors from sitting on the bench during basketball games. In 1979, Morgan retired due to poor health. He died the following year at age 61. In 1983, the J. D. Morgan Center at UCLA was dedicated. It houses the university's athletic department, including both administrative and coaching staff.

PSSA Results Pennsylvania System of School Assessments, commonly called PSSAs are No Child Left Behind Act related examinations which were administered from 2003 through 2012, in all Pennsylvania public high schools. The exams were administered in the Spring of each school year. The goal was for 100% of students to be on grade level or better in reading and mathematics, by the Spring of 2014. The tests focused on the state's Academic Standards for reading, writing, mathematics and science. The Science exam included content in science, technology, ecology and the environmental studies. The mathematics exam included: algebra I, algebra II, geometry and trigonometry. The standards were first published in 1998 and are mandated by the Pennsylvania State Board of Education.Pennsylvania Department of Education, State Academic Standards, 2014 In 2013, the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania changed its high school assessments to the Keystone Exams in Algebra 1, Reading/literature and Biology1.

College remediation According to a Pennsylvania Department of Education study released in January 2009, 8% of Abington Heights School District graduates required remediation in mathematics and or reading before they were prepared to take college level courses in the Pennsylvania State System of Higher Education or community colleges. Less than 66% of Pennsylvania high school graduates, who enroll in a four-year college in Pennsylvania, earned a bachelor's degree within six years. Among Pennsylvania high school graduates pursuing an associate degree, only one in three graduated in three years.National Center for Education Statistics Per the Pennsylvania Department of Education, one in three recent high school graduates who attend Pennsylvania's public universities and community colleges takes at least one remedial course in math, reading or English. Dual enrollment Abington Heights High School offers a dual enrollment program. This state program permits high school students to take courses, at local higher education institutions, to earn college credits. Students remain enrolled at their high school. The courses count both towards high school graduation requirements and towards earning a college degree. The students continue to have full access to activities and programs at their high school. The college credits are offered at a deeply discounted rate. Originally, the Commonwealth offered a small grant to assist students in costs for tuition, fees and books. Under the Pennsylvania Transfer and Articulation Agreement, many Pennsylvania colleges and universities accept these credits for students who transfer to their institutions. For the 2009-10 funding year, Abington Heights School District received a state grant of $4,165 for the program. In 2010, Governor Edward Rendell eliminated the grants to students. Graduation requirements Among Pennsylvania's 500 public school districts, graduation requirements widely vary. The local School Board sets the graduation requirements in a graduation policy. At AHHS students must earn 23.5 credits in order to graduate. By Pennsylvania School Board regulations, beginning with the class of 2020, public school students must demonstrate successful completion of secondary level course work in Algebra I, Biology, and English Literature by passing the Keystone Exams. The exam is given at the end of the course. Keystone Exams replace the PSSAs for 11th grade. Students have several opportunities to pass the exam. Schools are mandated to provide targeted assistance to help the student be successful. Those who do not pass after several attempts can perform a project in order to graduate. Students have several opportunities to pass the exams. Schools are mandated to provide targeted assistance to help the student be successful. Those who do not pass after several attempts can perform a project in order to graduate. The original intent was to gradually add seven more exams including civics and geometry. In 2017, the Pennsylvania General Assembly passed legislation that eliminated developing any more Keystone Exams in other subjects.PA General Assembly, Act 6 of 2017, June 21, 2017 In 2011, Pennsylvania high school students field tested the Algebra 1, Biology and English Lit exams. The statewide results were: Algebra 1 38% on grade level, Biology 35% on grade level and English Lit - 49% on grade level. Individual student, school or district reports were not made public, although they were reported to district officials by the Pennsylvania Department of Education. Students identified as having special needs and qualifying for an Individual Educational Program (IEP) may graduate by meeting the requirements of their IEP. In 2017, the Pennsylvania General Assembly passed House Bill 202, which makes modifications of the Keystone Exam mandates for students who attend VoTech and Career Tech schools. These pupils will be allowed to use alternate assessments or industry-based certifications. School safety and bullying The Abington Heights School District administration reported there were zero incidents of bullying in the District in 2015. Additionally, there were two incidents involving knives and no sexual incidents involving students. The local law enforcement was involved in ten incidents at the schools with seven arrests.Center for Safe Schools, Abington Heights High School School Safety Report 2014-15, 2015 Each year the school safety data is reported by the district to the Safe School Center which then publishes the compiled reports online. Nationally, nearly 20% of pupils report being bullied at school. Abington Heights School Board has provided the district's anti-bully policy online.Abington Heights School Board, Bullying Policy 249, 2006 All Pennsylvania schools are required to have an anti-bullying policy incorporated into their Code of Student Conduct. The policy must identify disciplinary actions for bullying and designate a school staff person to receive complaints of bullying. The policy must be available on the school's website and posted in every classroom. All Pennsylvania public schools must provide a copy of its anti-bullying policy to the Office for Safe Schools every year, and shall review their policy every three years. Additionally, the District must conduct an annual review of that policy with students. The Center for Schools and Communities works with the Pennsylvania Commission on Crime & Delinquency and the Pennsylvania Department of Education to assist schools and communities as they research, select and implement bullying prevention programs and initiatives. According to the Center for Disease Control’s biannual national study of high school students in 2009, five percent of Pennsylvania students did not go to school for at least one day because they felt unsafe at school or on their way to or from school. Education standards relating to student safety and anti harassment programs are described in the 10.3. Safety and Injury Prevention in the Pennsylvania Academic Standards for Health, Safety and Physical Education. Safe School grant In 2013, Abington Heights School District did not participate in a state Safe Schools Targeted Grant. The maximum of $25,000 grants were awarded through a competitive application process. The funds had to be used for research based interventions, like: peer mediation, staff training in managing behavioral issues and creating a positive school climate. The District also did not apply for School Resource Officer and Police Officer grants.PDE, School Resource Officer and Police Officer grant, 2014 Wellness policy Abington Heights School Board established a district wellness policy in 2006.Abington Heights School Board Policy Manual, Student Wellness Policy 246, 2006 The policy deals with nutritious meals served at school, the control of access to some foods and beverages during school hours, age appropriate nutrition education for all students, and physical education for students K-12. The policy is in response to state mandates and federal legislation (P.L. 108 – 265). The law dictates that each school district participating in a program authorized by the Richard B. Russell National School Lunch Act (42 U.S.C. 1751 et seq) or the Child Nutrition Act of 1966 (42 U.S.C. 1771 et seq) \\"shall establish a local school wellness policy by School Year 2006.\\" Most districts identified the superintendent and school foodservice director as responsible for ensuring local wellness policy implementation. The legislation placed the responsibility of developing a wellness policy at the local level so the individual needs of each district can be addressed. According to the requirements for the Local Wellness Policy, school districts must set goals for nutrition education, physical activity, campus food provision, and other school-based activities designed to promote student wellness. Additionally, districts were required to involve a broad group of individuals in policy development and to have a plan for measuring policy implementation. Districts were offered a choice of levels of implementation for limiting or prohibiting low nutrition foods on the school campus. In final implementation these regulations prohibit some foods and beverages on the school campus. The Pennsylvania Department of Education required the district to submit a copy of the policy for approval. Abington Heights School District offers both a free school breakfast and a free or reduced-price lunch to children in low income families. All students attending the school can eat breakfast and lunch. Children from families with incomes at or below 130 percent of the federal poverty level are provided a breakfast and lunch at no cost to the family. Children from families with incomes between 130 and 185 percent of the federal poverty level can be charged no more than 30 cents per breakfast. A foster child whose care and placement is the responsibility of the State or who is placed by a court with a caretaker household is eligible for both a free breakfast and a free lunch. Runaway, homeless and Migrant Youth are also automatically eligible for free meals.USDA, Child Nutrition Programs - Eligibility Manual for School Meals, 2012 The meals are partially funded with federal dollars through the United States Department of Agriculture.Pennsylvania Hunger Action Center, The Pennsylvania School Breakfast Report Card, 2009 In 2013, the USDA issued new restrictions to foods in public schools. The rules apply to foods and beverages sold on all public school district campuses during the day. They limit vending machine snacks to a maximum of 200 calories per item. Additionally, all snack foods sold at school must meet competitive nutrient standards, meaning they must have fruits, vegetables, dairy or protein in them or contain at least 10 percent of the daily value of fiber, calcium, potassium, and Vitamin D.USDA, Child Nutrition Programs, June 27, 2013 In order to comply with the Healthy, Hunger- Free Kids Act of 2010 all US public school districts are required to raise the price of their school lunches to $2.60 regardless of the actual cost of providing the lunch. The Healthy Hunger-Free Kids Act of 2010 mandates that Districts raise their full pay lunch prices every year until the price of non- subsidized lunches equals the amount the federal government reimburses schools for free meals. That subsidy in 2013-2014 was $2.93. In 2015, federal reimbursement rates were: $3.07 per meal for students who are income-eligible for free lunches and $2.67 for those who qualify for a reduced price. School lunch participation nationally dropped from 31.6 million students in 2012 to 30.4 million in 2014, according to the federal Department of Agriculture. Pennsylvania statistics show school lunch participation dropped by 86,950 students in the same two years, from 1,127,444 in 2012 to 1,040,494 in 2014. In 2014, President Barack Obama ordered a prohibition of advertisements for unhealthy foods on public school campuses during the school day. The US Department of Agriculture requires that students take milk as their beverage at lunch. In accordance with this law, any student requesting water in place of milk with their lunch must present a written request, signed by a doctor, documenting the need for water instead of milk. Abington Heights School District provides health services as mandated by the Commonwealth and the federal government. Nurses are available in each building to conduct annual health screenings (data reported to the PDE and state Department of Health) and to dispense prescribed medications to students during the school day. Students can be excluded from school unless they comply with all the State Department of Health's extensive immunization mandates. School nurses monitor each pupil for this compliance. Beginning with the 2017–18 school year, high school students are mandated to receive a dose of MCV meningococcal conjugate vaccine for 12th grade entry. Nurses also monitor each child's weight. Nurses also monitor each child's weight. In 2016, the Pennsylvania Department of Health made available to each Pennsylvania high school the overdose antidote drug naloxone in a nasal spray. School nurses were also provided with educational materials and training developed by the National Association of School Nurses. The cost was covered by a grant from a private foundation. Extracurricular Activities Abington Heights HIgh School offers a wide variety of clubs, activities and an extensive, publicly funded sports program. Eligibility for participation is determined by school board policy and in compliance with standards set by the Pennsylvania Interscholastic Athletic Association (PIAA). The PIAA mandates that student athletes must be passing at least four full-credit subjects to participate in sports. By Pennsylvania law, all K-12 students residing in the school district, including those who attend a private nonpublic school, a Pennsylvania public cyber charter school, charter school and those who are homeschooled, are all eligible to participate in the extracurricular programs including all athletics. They must meet the same eligibility rules as the students enrolled in the district's schools. According to PA Child Abuse Recognition and Reporting Act 126 of 2014, all volunteer coaches and all those who assist in student activities, must have criminal background checks. Like all school district employees, they must also attend an anti child abuse training once every three years.Eleanor Chute., New Pa. law expands clearance requirements for school volunteers, employees, Pittsburgh Post-Gazette, December 15, 2014Ali Stevens., Child Protective Services Law impacts schools, WKOK.com 1070AM, January 6, 2015 Sports Coaches receive compensation as outlined in the teachers' union contract.

Buildings at the site are amongst the earliest examples of the pillared four room house characteristic of Iron Age Israelite architecture, featuring a courtyard divided by stone pillars, a rectangular back room and rooms along the courtyard. The foundations of a structure built of large stones were also uncovered, possibly a fortified defense tower. The biblical town of Giloh is mentioned in the Book of Joshua (Joshua 15:51) and the Book of Samuel (II Sam 15:12).Gilo & Har Choma Some scholars believe that biblical Giloh was located in the central Hebron Hills, whereas the name of the modern settlement was chosen because of its proximity to Beit Jala, possibly a corruption of Giloh. During the construction of Gilo, archaeologists discovered a fortress and agricultural implements from the period of the First Temple period above the shopping center on Rehov Haganenet. Between Givat Canada and Gilo Park, they unearthed the remains of a farm and graves from the Second Temple period. Roman and Byzantine remains have also been found at various sites.

She combined a bel canto technique with interpretation in French, Russian Spanish, Italian, German and Nahuatl. An extremely versatile singer, her repertoire ranged from classical opera seria to the bel canto music of Salvador Moreno Manzano, and Carlos Jiménez Mabarak; further, to the works of Blas Galindo, Manuel Ponce and Tata Nacho. In her career she took challenges as to sing many Mexican pieces of Sonido 13 (thirteenth sound), a microtonal system invented by Julián Carrillo in 1925. Born in Parral, Chihuahua, and raised by her mother Guadalupe Ontiveros Mardueño and a musician and band director in Oaxaca, Prospero Gonzalez. Her first opera was Wagner's Die Walküre at age 12. She received her musical education Mexico and established her career in France where she won the first prize of French music interpretation in the École Française du Paris in 1955. Career She moved to Mexico City and studied at the Conservatorio Nacional de Música de México, she finished her musical studies very young winning the first prize of Bel canto in a contest at the Mexican Conservatory. She started her career as a soloist at the Orquesta Sinfónica Nacional under Carlos Chávez, during which time she sang in the National Mexican Opera and on national radio. Later she sang at the Russian Opera of San Francisco. In 1953 she was given a scholarship to perfect her studies in Europe, this allowed her to perform in many international contests in Munich, Vercelli and Geneva in which she won a silver medal. In 1955 she won the First Prize of Interpretation of French Music in the École Française du Paris. In that same year she was signed for a tour to Morocco, Rabat and Casablanca. The tour continued to the Spanish cities of Seville, Malaga and Barcelona. In Paris, she signed for a LP record with Barclay Records, with Mexican composers like Tata Nacho, Manuel Ponce, and Salvador Moreno Manzano. She owned a remarkable tessitura with a vocal range that allowed her to sing in microtonal quarter tones, eights and sixteens in Julian Carrillo's compositions. She was the first mezzo-soprano in the world who sung in Nahuatl or Mexica language in such exclusive places as the Metropolitan Opera, Carnegie Hall and La Scala in Milan. The tone of the voice was warm, velvety, profound; the color and deep rich tones without vibrato.

The president is Alphonso Bridgewater and the secretary general is Glenville Jeffers. The committee has oversaw six Olympic and five Commonwealth Games, winning one gold medal at the 2002 Commonwealth Games, by Kim Collins in the 100 meters.  History  The Saint Kitts and Nevis Olympic Association was founded with a constitution on 27 May 1986. Saint Kitts and Nevis Amateur Athletics Association was formed in 1977 and joined the International Olympic Committee (IOC) in 1993. The Association created a National Olympic Committee (NOC), which was first officially recognized in 1993. The NOC and Commonwealth Games Association (CGA) both governed multiple sports prior to 1998. Since they both shared the same member organizations, the CGA merged with the NOC, making the NOC responsible for both the Olympic Games and the Commonwealth Games. The constitution was revised on 10 June 2004; ratified 30 November 2006; and approved by the IOC 1 June 2007. The NOC was officially located at the Charles Wilkin Building in Basseterre, Saint Kitts from 1994 to 2005, when it moved to the Olympic House. In June 2015, it launched a strategic plan to aid in the development of sport in Saint Kitts and Nevis for the following nine years until 2024. As of April 2020, the president is Alphonso Bridgewater and the secretary general is Glenville Jeffers. The NOC is a part of the Pan American Sports Organisation. Events Olympics Kim Collins competed at five of the first six Olympic Games for the committee. Saint Kitts and Nevis participates in the Olympic Games in the Summer Olympics and have not competed at the Winter Games. Saint Kitts and Nevis entered the Olympic Games for the first time at the 1996 Summer Games in Atlanta, United States. The delegation featured one athlete in both the men's and women's 100-meter sprints and three relay teams. Both sprinters reached the quarter-finals of the respective events, with the relay teams not advancing past the first round. Four years later, at the 2000 Summer Games, two athletes were sent, with Kim Collins reaching the final of the 100 meter event; placing seventh. At the following event in 2004, Collins placed one better, reaching sixth position in the same event. Collins competed in the 200 meters in 2008 also finishing fourth, with a time of 20.59 seconds. The NOC did not allow Collins to compete in 2012 stating had violated team rules, and did not allow him to compete. The 4 × 100 relay team of Delwayne Delaney, Brijesh Lawrence, Jason Rogers, and Lestrod Roland made a new national record during the first round of 38.41 seconds but did not progress past the first round. The 2016 Olympics featured seven participants, led by team captain Antoine Adams. At the event, Collins was the first 40-year-old to run a 100 meters under 10 seconds, where he was the oldest sprinter at the Games. Collins advanced the furthest of any Saint Kitts and Nevis athlete, reaching the semi-finals of the event. He finished sixth in his heat with a time of 10.12 seconds and did not advance to the finals. Adams and Lawrence both reached the quarter-finals in the same event. Commonwealth Games Prior to 1998, the nation's participation in the Commonwealth Games and the Commonwealth Youth Games was organised by the Saint Kitts and Nevis Commonwealth Games Association. Since that time, the Olympic Committee has been in charge of participation. Saint Kitts and Nevis joined the Commonwealth Games Federation and first participated in the Commonwealth Games in 1978 (as part of Saint Christopher-Nevis-Anguilla) where they participated in both athletics (100 and 800 meters) and cycling (road and track). The committee has subsequently sent teams to compete in every Commonwealth Games since 1990. The nation has won just one medal at the Games, a gold for Kim Collins in the 100 meters at the 2002 Games. The country has participated in athletics, cycling and table tennis.

The grant extended along the Pacific coast from Rancho Punta de Pinos and Seal Rocks south to Carmel by the Sea and encompassed present day Pebble Beach, California. Diseño del Rancho Pescadero History Fabián Barreto, a Mexican who came to Monterey in 1827 married María del Carmen Garcia Barreto Madariaga in 1833. Barreto received the one square league grant in 1836, but died in 1841. Barreto was \\"killed by a beam,\\" [Schwald] presumably while building a house. His widow, Maria married Juan Madariaga in 1844. Madariaga Adobe on Abrego Street in Monterey is named after his family. Juan Madariaga's mother was also named \\"Maria Madariaga\\" and the two Marias (and there were more) are often confused in local lore. Maria, the wife of Juan, sold the Rancho Pescadero before she married into the Madariaga family, so it never did belong to the Madariaga's. Maria - the Ghost Lady - most likely could not pay the taxes on the land, and was forced to sell it. David Jacks acquired the property through the Romies. Maria also likely did not understand what part of her holdings that she was selling, as title documents were often not available, which may account for the double-sale. The sudden death of the ill- fated Fabian Barreto, second husband of Maria, resulted in the passing of the land to John Romie and then to David Jacks. (a more complete description of this transaction history (with date discrepancies) can be found on a website dealing with the Hart Mansion - hartmansion.com.) In 1846 (?) Maria Madariaga sold Rancho Pescadero to John Romie. John Frederick Romie and his wife, Maria A. Frohn (1801–1886), came from Hamburg, Germany to Mexico in 1835. In 1841 they came to Monterey where Romie operated a tailoring business. After the discovery of gold, Romie went to the mines, and died at Placerville in 1850. His widow sold Rancho Pescadero to John C. Gore in 1852. In 1860 [the year she died?] María Madariaga re-sold the land to David Jacks, who owned the adjoining Rancho Aguajito to the east. David Jacks married Maria Cristina Soledad Romie (1835-), the daughter of J. F. and Maria A. Frohn Romie in 1861.Michael Norman, 2008, Haunted Homeland: A Definitive Collection of North American Ghost Stories, Tor Books, With the cession of California to the United States following the Mexican-American War, the 1848 Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo provided that the land grants would be honored.

Saint-Jacques Cathedral (Cathédrale Saint-Jacques) was the Roman Catholic cathedral in Montreal from 1825 to 1852, named for St. James the Greater. From 1825 to 1836, it was the seat of the auxiliary bishop of Quebec in Montreal. With the creation of the Roman Catholic Diocese of Montreal in 1836, it became the cathedral of the new diocese. History Built at the corner of Saint-Denis and Sainte-Catherine streets, it was the city's first purpose-built cathedral. Its construction started in 1822 and its cornerstone was blessed on May 22, 1823. It was consecrated on September 22, 1825. The cathedral and the diocesan building were destroyed in the Great Fire of July 9, 1852, along with 1,200 other buildings. At this point the diocese moved temporarily to the nearby chapel of the Sisters of Providence, before finally moving to a chapel on the current site of Mary, Queen of the World Cathedral, built in 1894, which is also dedicated to St. James. The church was rebuilt by architect John Ostell for the Society of Saint-Sulpice as a parish church, and consecrated in 1857. It burned down the next year. It was rebuilt by Victor Bourgeau by 1860, with an 85-metre spire added in 1876, a golden weathervane in 1905, and a transept in 1889. It was burned out yet again in 1933. Its congregation's numbers seriously declining, the church was almost closed in 1965, but instead was designated as a pilgrimage centre and official Christian church of Expo 67. Uniquely, the church was connected directly to Berri-De Montigny metro station (today Berri-UQAM) by an underground city connection. The patched-together building was purchased in 1973 by the Université du Québec à Montréal, and was demolished except for the spire and transept, classified as historic monuments. They were integrated into the university's Pavillon Judith-Jasmin.

It is a commercially important flatfish that lives on the sandy bottoms of the European shelf. It ranges geographically from the Barents Sea to the Mediterranean. European plaice are characterised by their smooth brown skin, with distinctive red spots and a bony ridge behind the eyes. They feed on polychaetes, crustaceans and bivalves and can be found at depths of up to 200 metres. At night they move into shallow waters to feed and during the day they bury themselves in the sand.

Saturn's X-ray spectrum is similar to that of X-rays from the Sun. 14 April 2003 The history of X-ray astronomy begins in the 1920s, with interest in short wave communications for the U.S. Navy. This was soon followed by extensive study of the earth's ionosphere. By 1927, interest in the detection of X-ray and ultraviolet (UV) radiation at high altitudes inspired researchers to launch Goddard's rockets into the upper atmosphere to support theoretical studies and data gathering. The first successful rocket flight equipped with instrumentation able to detect solar ultraviolet radiation occurred in 1946. X-ray solar studies began in 1949. By 1973 a solar instrument package orbited on Skylab providing significant solar data. In 1965 the Goddard Space Flight Center program in X-ray astronomy was initiated with a series of balloon-borne experiments. In the 1970s this was followed by high altitude sounding rocket experiments, and that was followed by orbiting (satellite) observatories. The first rocket flight to successfully detect a cosmic source of X-ray emission was launched in 1962 by a group at American Science and Engineering (AS&E;). X-ray wavelengths reveal information about the bodies (sources) that emit them. 1920s to the 1940s The Naval Research Laboratory (NRL) opened in 1923. After E.O. Hulburt (1890-1982) arrived there in 1924 he studied physical optics. The NRL was conducting research on the properties of the ionosphere (Earth's reflecting layer) because of interest in short wave radio communications. Hubert (Hulburt ?) produced a series of mathematical descriptions of the ionosphere during the 1920s and 1930s. In 1927, at the Carnegie Institution of Washington, Hulburt, Gregory Breit and Merle Tuve explored the possibility of equipping Robert Goddard's rockets to explore the upper atmosphere. In 1929 Hulburt proposed an experimental program in which a rocket might be instrumented to explore the upper atmosphere. This proposal included detection of ultraviolet radiation and X rays at high altitudes. Herbert Friedman began X-ray solar studies in 1949 and soon reported that the energy of \\"the solar X-ray spectrum ... is adequate to account for all of E-layer ionization.\\" Thus one of Hulburt's original questions, the source and behavior of the radio-reflecting layer, began to find its answer in space research. At the end of the 1930s other studies included the inference of an X-ray corona by optical methods and, in 1949, more direct evidence by detecting X-ray photons. Because the Earth's atmosphere blocks X-rays at ground level, Wilhelm Röntgen's discovery had no effect on observational astronomy for the first 50 years. X-ray astronomy became possible only with the capability to use rockets that far exceeded the altitudes of balloons. In 1948 U.S. researchers used a German-made V-2 rocket to gather the first records of solar x-rays. The NRL has placed instruments in rockets, satellites, Skylab, and Spacelab 2 Through the 1960s, 70s, 80s, and 90s, the sensitivity of detectors increased greatly during the 60 years of X-ray astronomy. In addition, the ability to focus X-rays has developed enormously—allowing the production of high-quality images. 1960s The study of astronomical objects at the highest energies of X-rays and gamma rays began in the early 1960s. Before then, scientists knew only that the Sun was an intense source in these wavebands. Earth's atmosphere absorbs most X-rays and gamma rays, so rocket flights that could lift scientific payloads above Earth's atmosphere were needed. The first rocket flight to successfully detect a cosmic source of X-ray emission was launched in 1962 by a group at American Science and Engineering (AS&E;). The team of scientists on this project included Riccardo Giacconi, Herbert Gursky, Frank Paolini, and Bruno Rossi. This rocket flight used a small X-ray detector, which found a very bright source they named Scorpius X-1, because it was the first X-ray source found in the constellation Scorpius. 1970s In the 1970s, dedicated X-ray astronomy satellites, such as Uhuru, Ariel 5, SAS-3, OSO-8 and HEAO-1, developed this field of science at an astounding pace. Scientists hypothesized that X-rays from stellar sources in our galaxy were primarily from a neutron star in a binary system with a normal star. In these \\"X-ray binaries,\\" the X-rays originate from material traveling from the normal star to the neutron star in a process called accretion. The binary nature of the system allowed astronomers to measure the mass of the neutron star. For other systems, the inferred mass of the X-ray emitting object supported the idea of the existence of black holes, as they were too massive to be neutron stars. Other systems displayed a characteristic X-ray pulse, just as pulsars had been found to do in the radio regime, which allowed a determination of the spin rate of the neutron star. Finally, some of these galactic X-ray sources were found to be highly variable. In fact, some sources would appear in the sky, remain bright for a few weeks, and then fade again from view. Such sources are called X-ray transients. The inner regions of some galaxies were also found to emit X-rays. The X-ray emission from these active galactic nuclei is believed to originate from ultra-relativistic gas near a very massive black hole at the galaxy's center. Lastly, a diffuse X-ray emission was found to exist all over the sky. 1980s to the present The study of X-ray astronomy continued to be carried out using data from a host of satellites that were active from the 1980s to the early 2000s: the HEAO Program, EXOSAT, Ginga, RXTE, ROSAT, ASCA, as well as BeppoSAX, which detected the first afterglow of a gamma-ray burst (GRB). Data from these satellites continues to aid our further understanding of the nature of these sources and the mechanisms by which the X-rays and gamma rays are emitted. Understanding these mechanisms can in turn shed light on the fundamental physics of our universe. By looking at the sky with X-ray and gamma-ray instruments, we collect important information in our attempt to address questions such as how the universe began and how it evolves, and gain some insight into its eventual fate. Imagine the Universe! is a service of the High Energy Astrophysics Science Archive Research Center (HEASARC), Dr. Alan Smale (Director), within the Astrophysics Science Division (ASD) at NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center. All material on this site has been created and updated between 1997-2011. Goddard Space Flight Center Balloons In 1965, at the suggestion of Frank McDonald, Elihu Boldt initiated Goddard's program in X-ray astronomy with a series of balloon-borne experiments. At an early stage he was joined by Peter Serlemitsos, who had just completed his PhD space physics thesis on magnetospheric electrons, and by Guenter Riegler, a University of Maryland physics graduate student interested in doing his dissertation research in astrophysics. From 1965 to 1972 there were over a dozen balloon-borne experiments (mostly from New Mexico), including the first such to take place from Australia (1966), one in which hard X-ray emission was discovered (albeit with crude angular resolution) from a region towards the Galactic Center whose centroid is located among subsequently identified sources GX1+4, GX3+1, and GX5-1. A balloon-borne experiment in 1968 was based on the multi-anode multi-layer xenon gas proportional chamber that had recently been developed in our lab and represented the first use of such a high performance instrument for X-ray astronomy. Due to the attenuation of soft X-rays by the residual atmosphere at balloon altitudes these early experiments were restricted to energies above ~20 keV. Observations down to lower energies were begun with a series of high altitude sounding rocket experiments; by this stage Steve Holt had already joined the program. A 1972 rocket-borne observation of Cas A, the youngest supernova remnant in our galaxy, yielded the first detection of an X-ray spectral line, iron K-line emission at ~7 keV. Rockets Graph The figure to the right shows 15-second samples of the raw counts (per 20.48ms) observed in a 1973 sounding- rocket-borne exposure to three of the X-ray brightest binary sources in our galaxy: Her X-1 (1.7 days), Cyg X-3 (0.2 day), and Cyg X-1 (5.6 days). The 1.24 second pulsar period associated with Her X-1 is immediately evident from the data, while the rate profile for Cyg X-3 is completely consistent with the statistical fluctuations in counts expected for a source that is constant, at least for the 15s duration of the exposure shown; the Cyg X-1 data, on the other hand, clearly exhibit the chaotic \\"shot noise\\" behavior characteristic of this black-hole candidate and also provided preliminary evidence for the additional feature of millisecond \\"burst\\" sub-structure, noted for the first time in this observation. The sharp cut-off at ~24 keV in the flat spectrum observed for Her X-1 in this exposure provided the first reported evidence for radiative transfer effects to be associated with a highly magnetized plasma near the surface of a neutron star. The black-body spectral component observed for Cyg X-3 during this experiment gave strong evidence that this emission is from the immediate vicinity of a compact object the size of a neutron star. An observation of Cyg X-3 a year later with the same instrument yielded an optically thin thermal spectrum for this source and provided the first evidence for strong spectral iron K-line emission from an X-ray binary. Orbiting observatories The Rossi X-ray Timing Explorer (RXTE) is a satellite that observes the time structure of astronomical X-ray sources. The RXTE has three instruments—the Proportional Counter Array, the High-Energy X-ray Timing Experiment (HEXTE), and one instrument called the All Sky Monitor. The RXTE observes X-rays from black holes, neutron stars, X-ray pulsars and x-ray bursts. Our large area PCA (Proportional Counter Array) on the current RXTE (Rossi X-ray Timing Explorer) mission genuinely reflects the heritage of our sounding rocket program. RXTE continues to provide very valuable data as it enters the second decade of successful operation. Goddard's ASM (All-Sky Monitor) pin-hole X-ray camera on Ariel-5 (1974-1980) was the first X-ray astronomy experiment to use imaging proportional counters (albeit one-dimensional); it provided information on transient sources and the long-term behavior of several bright objects. Jean Swank joined the program in time for the beginning of our OSO-8 experiment (1975-1978), the first broadband (2-40 keV) orbiting observatory based on multi-anode multi-layer proportional chambers, one that showed the power of X-ray spectroscopy; for example, it established that iron K-line emission is a ubiquitous feature of clusters of galaxies. The HEAO-1 A2 full-sky cosmic X-ray experiment (1977-1979) provided the most comprehensive data (still the most definitive) on the cosmic X-ray background broadband spectrum and large-scale structure, and a much used complete sample of the brightest extragalactic sources; it posed the challenging \\"spectral paradox\\" just now being unraveled with new results on evolution (from deep surveys) and on individual source spectra extending into the gamma-ray band. The SSS (Solid State Spectrometer) at the focus of the HEAO-2 Einstein Observatory (1978-1981) grazing incidence telescope was the first high spectral resolution non-dispersive spectrometer to be used for X-ray astronomy, here for energies up to ~3 keV, limited by the telescope optics. By the use of conical foil optics, developed in our lab, the response of a grazing incidence X-ray telescope was extended to 12 keV, amply covering the crucial iron K-band of emission. A cooled Si(Li) solid state detector was used at the focus of such a telescope for the BBXRT (Broad Band X-Ray Telescope) on the Astro-1 shuttle mission (STS-35) on Columbia in December 1990, the first broadband (0.3-12keV) X-ray observatory to use focusing optics. In collaboration with X-ray astronomers in Japan, Goddard supplied conical foil X-ray optics have been used for the joint Japanese and American ASCA mission (1993-2000). It was the first broadband imaging observatory using CCD non-dispersive spectrometers. Substantial improvement in the capability of solid-state non-dispersive spectrometers has been achieved in our lab (in collaboration with the University of Wisconsin) by the successful development of quantum calorimeters with resolution better than 10 eV (FWHM). Such spectrometers have been used in a sounding-rocket-borne experiment to study spectral lines from the hot interstellar medium of our galaxy and will soon play a major role in the joint Japanese/American Suzaku orbiting X-ray observatory launched in July 2005. The critical early stages of this program benefited from highly dedicated technical support by Dale Arbogast, Frank Birsa, Ciro Cancro, Upendra Desai, Henry Doong, Charles Glasser, Sid Jones, and Frank Shaffer. More than 20 graduate students (mostly from the University of Maryland at College Park) have successfully carried out their PhD dissertation research within our X-ray astronomy program. Almost all of these former students have remained actively involved with astrophysics. * Early research The USA V-2 period NRL scientists J. D. Purcell, C. Y. Johnson, and Dr. F. S. Johnson among those recovering instruments from a V-2 used for upper atmospheric research above the New Mexico desert. This is V-2 number 54, launched January 18, 1951 (photo by Dr. Richard Tousey, NRL). The beginning of the search for X-ray sources from above the Earth's atmosphere was on August 5, 1948 12:07 GMT. A US Army V-2 as part of Project Hermes was launched from White Sands Proving Grounds Launch Complex (LC) 33. In addition to carrying experiments of the US Naval Research Laboratory for cosmic and solar radiation, temperature, pressure, ionosphere, and photography, there was on board a solar X-ray test detector, which functioned properly. The missile reached an apogee of 166 km. As part of a collaboration between the US Naval Research Laboratory (NRL) and the Signal Corps Engineering Laboratory (SCEL) of the University of Michigan, another V-2 (V-2 42 configuration) was launched from White Sands LC33 on December 9, 1948 at 16:08 GMT (09:08 local time). The missile reached an apogee of 108.7 km and carried aeronomy (winds, pressure, temperature), solar X-ray and radiation, and biology experiments. On January 28, 1949, an NRL X-ray detector (Blossom) was placed in the nose cone of a V-2 rocket and launched at White Sands Missile Range in New Mexico. X-rays from the Sun were detected. Apogee: 60 km. A second collaborative effort (NRL/SCEL) using a V-2 UM-3 configuration launched on April 11, 1949 at 22:05 GMT. Experiments included solar X-ray detection, apogee: 87.4 km. NRL Ionosphere 1 solar X-ray, ionosphere, meteorite mission launched a V-2 on September 29, 1949 from White Sands at 16:58 GMT and reached 151.1 km. Using V-2 53 configuration a solar X-ray experiment was launched on February 17, 1950 from White Sands LC 33 at 18:01 GMT reaching an apogee of 148 km. The last V-2 launch number TF2/TF3 came on August 22, 1952 07:33 GMT from White Sands reaching an apogee of 78.2 km and carried experiments *solar X-ray for NRL, *cosmic radiation for the National Institute of Health (NIH), and *sky brightness for the Air Research and Development Command. Aerobee period Aerobee Hi Missile, White Sands Missile Range Museum. The first successful launch of an Aerobee occurred on May 5, 1952 13:44 GMT from White Sands Proving Grounds launch complex LC35. It was an Aerobee RTV-N-10 configuration reaching an apogee of 127 km with NRL experiments for solar X-ray and ultraviolet detection. On April 19, 1960, an Office of Naval Research Aerobee Hi made a series of X-ray photographs of the Sun from an altitude of 208 km. The mainstay of the US IGY rocket stable was the Aerobee Hi, which was modified and improved to create the Aerobee 150. An Aerobee 150 rocket launched on June 12, 1962 detected the first X-rays from other celestial sources (Scorpius X-1). USSR V-2 derivative launches Starting on June 21, 1959 from Kapustin Yar, with a modified V-2 designated the R-5V, the USSR launched a series of four vehicles to detect solar X-rays: a R-2A on July 21, 1959 and two R-11A at 02:00 GMT and 14:00 GMT. Skylark The British Skylark was probably the most successful of the many sounding rocket programs. The first launched in 1957 from Woomera, Australia and its 441st and final launch took place from Esrange, Sweden on 2 May 2005. Launches were carried out from sites in Australia, Europe, and South America, with use by NASA, the European Space Research Organisation (ESRO), and German and Swedish space organizations. Skylark was used to obtain the first good- quality X-ray images of the solar corona. The first X-ray surveys of the sky in the Southern Hemisphere were provided by Skylark launches. It was also used with high precision in September and October 1972 in an effort to locate the optical counterpart of X-ray source GX3+1 by lunar occultation. Véronique The French Véronique was successfully launched on April 14, 1964 from Hammaguira, LC Blandine carrying experiments to measure UV and X-ray intensities and the FU110 to measure UV intensity from the atomic H (Lyman-α) line, and again on November 4, 1964. Early satellites GRAB satellite at the National Cryptologic Museum. The satellites carried two sets of instruments: an unclassified experiment (called Solrad) and a then-classified payload to collect electronic intelligence (ELINT) (called Tattletale). The satellites launched with the Thor-Delta rocket system became known as the TD satellites. TD-1A was successfully launched on March 11, 1972 from Vandenberg Air Force Base (March 12 in Europe). The SOLar RADiation satellite program (SOLRAD) was conceived in the late 1950s to study the Sun's effects on Earth, particularly during periods of heightened solar activity. Solrad 1 was launched on June 22, 1960 aboard a Thor Able from Cape Canaveral at 1:54 a.m. EDT. As the world's first orbiting astronomical observatory, SOLRAD I determined that radio fade-outs were caused by solar X-ray emissions. The first in a series of 8 successfully launched Orbiting Solar Observatories (OSO 1, launched on March 7, 1963) had as its primary mission to measure solar electromagnetic radiation in the UV, X-ray, and gamma-ray regions. The first USA satellite which detected cosmic X-rays was the Third Orbiting Solar Observatory, or OSO-3, launched on March 8, 1967. It was intended primarily to observe the Sun, which it did very well during its 2-year lifetime, but it also detected a flaring episode from the source Sco X-1 and measured the diffuse cosmic X-ray background. OSO 5 was launched on January 22, 1969, and lasted until July 1975. It was the 5th satellite put into orbit as part of the Orbiting Solar Observatory program. This program was intended to launch a series of nearly identical satellites to cover an entire 11-year solar cycle. The circular orbit had an altitude of 555 km and an inclination of 33°. The spin rate of the satellite was 1.8 s. The data produced a spectrum of the diffuse background over the energy range 14-200 keV. OSO 6 was launched on August 9, 1969. Its orbital period was ~95 min. The spacecraft had a spin rate of 0.5 rps. On board was a hard X-ray detector (27-189 keV) with a 5.1 cm2 NaI(Tl) scintillator, collimated to 17° × 23° FWHM. The system had 4 energy channels (separated 27-49-75-118-189 keV). The detector spun with the spacecraft on a plane containing the Sun direction within ± 3.5°. Data were read with alternate 70 ms and 30 ms integrations for 5 intervals every 320 ms. TD-1A was put in a nearly circular polar sun-synchronous orbit, with apogee 545 km, perigee 533 km, and inclination 97.6°. It was ESRO's first 3-axis stabilized satellite, with one axis pointing to the Sun to within ±5°. The optical axis was maintained perpendicular to the solar pointing axis and to the orbital plane. It scanned the entire celestial sphere every 6 months, with a great circle being scanned every satellite revolution. After about 2 months of operation, both of the satellite's tape recorders failed. A network of ground stations was put together so that real-time telemetry from the satellite was recorded for about 60% of the time. After 6 months in orbit, the satellite entered a period of regular eclipses as the satellite passed behind the Earth—cutting off sunlight to the solar panels. The satellite was put into hibernation for 4 months, until the eclipse period passed, after which systems were turned back on and another 6 months of observations were made. TD-1A was primarily a UV mission however it carried both a cosmic X-ray and a gamma-ray detector. TD-1A reentered on January 9, 1980. Surveying and cataloging X-ray sources OSO 7 was primarily a solar observatory designed to point a battery of UV and X-ray telescopes at the Sun from a platform mounted on a cylindrical wheel. The detectors for observing cosmic X-ray sources were X-ray proportional counters. The hard X-ray telescope operated over the energy range 7 - 550 keV. OSO 7 performed an X-ray All-sky survey and discovered the 9-day periodicity in Vela X-1 which led to its optical identification as a HMXRB. OSO 7 was launched on September 29, 1971 and operated until May 18, 1973. Skylab, a science and engineering laboratory, was launched into Earth orbit by a Saturn V rocket on May 14, 1973. Detailed X-ray studies of the Sun were performed. The S150 experiment performed a faint X-ray source survey. The S150 was mounted atop the SIV-B upper stage of the Saturn 1B rocket which orbited briefly behind and below Skylab on July 28, 1973. The entire SIV-B stage underwent a series of preprogrammed maneuvers, scanning about 1° every 15 seconds, to allow the instrument to sweep across selected regions of the sky. The pointing direction was determined during data processing, using the inertial guidance system of the SIV-B stage combined with information from two visible star sensors which formed part of the experiment. Galactic X-ray sources were observed with the S150 experiment. The experiment was designed to detect 4.0-10.0 nm photons. It consisted of a single large (~1500 cm2) proportional counter, electrically divided by fine wire ground planes into separate signal-collecting areas and looking through collimator vanes. The collimators defined 3 intersecting fields of view (~2 × 20°) on the sky, which allowed source positions to be determined to ~ 30'. The front window of the instrument consisted of a 2 µm thick plastic sheet. The counter gas was a mixture of argon and methane. Analysis of the data from the S150 experiment provided strong evidence that the soft X-ray background cannot be explained as the cumulative effect of many unresolved point sources. Skylab's solar studies: UV and X-ray solar photography for highly ionized atoms, X-ray spectrography of solar flares and active regions, and X-ray emissions of lower solar corona. Salyut 4 space station was launched on December 26, 1974. It was in an orbit of 355 × 343 km, with an orbital period of 91.3 minutes, inclined at 51.6°. The X-ray telescope began observations on January 15, 1975. Orbiting Solar Observatory (OSO 8) was launched on June 21, 1975. While OSO 8's primary objective was to observe the Sun, four instruments were dedicated to observations of other celestial X-ray sources brighter than a few milliCrab. A sensitivity of 0.001 of the Crab nebula source (= 1 \\"mCrab\\"). OSO 8 ceased operations on October 1, 1978. X-ray source variability The P78-1 or Solwind satellite Although several earlier X-ray observatories initiated the endeavor to study X-ray source variability, once the catalogs of X-ray sources were firmly established, more extensive studies could commence. Prognoz 6 carried two NaI(Tl) scintillators (2-511 keV, 2.2-98 keV), and a proportional counter (2.2-7 keV) to study solar X-rays. The Space Test Program spacecraft P78-1 or Solwind was launched on February 24, 1979 and continued operating until September 13, 1985, when it was shot down in orbit during an Air Force ASM-135 ASAT test. The platform was of the Orbiting Solar Observatory (OSO) type, with a solar-oriented sail and a rotating wheel section. P78-1 was in a noon-midnight, Sun-synchronous orbit at 600 km altitude. The orbital inclination of 96° implied that a substantial fraction of the orbit was spent at high latitude, where the particle background prevented detector operation. In-flight experience showed that good data were obtained between 35° N and 35° S geomagnetic latitude outside the South Atlantic Anomaly. This yields an instrument duty cycle of 25-30%. Telemetry data were obtained for about 40-50% of the orbits, yielding a net data return of 10-15%. Though this data rate appears low, it means that about 108 seconds of good data reside in the XMON data base. Data from the P78-1 X-Ray Monitor experiment offered source monitoring with a sensitivity comparable to that of instruments flown on SAS-3, OSO-8, or Hakucho, and the advantages of longer observing times and unique temporal coverage. Five fields of inquiry were particularly well suited for investigation with P78-1 data: *study of pulsational, eclipse, precession, and intrinsic source variability on time scales of tens of seconds to months in galactic X-ray sources. *pulse timing studies of neutron stars. *identification and study of new transient sources. *observations of X-ray and gamma-ray bursts, and other fast transients. *simultaneous X-ray coverage of objects observed by other satellites, such as HEAO-2 and 3, as well as bridging the gap in coverage of objects in the observational timeline. Launched on February 21, 1981, the Hinotori satellite observations of the 1980s pioneered hard X-ray imaging of solar flares. Tenma was the second Japanese X-ray astronomy satellite launched on February 20, 1983. Tenma carried GSFC detectors which had an improved energy resolution (by a factor of 2) compared to proportional counters and performed the first sensitive measurements of the iron spectral region for many astronomical objects. Energy range: 0.1-60 keV; gas scintillator proportional counter: 10 units of 80 cm2 each, FOV ~ 3° (FWHM), 2-60 keV; transient source monitor: 2-10 keV. The Soviet Astron orbital station was designed primarily for UV and X-ray astrophysical observations. It was injected into orbit on March 23, 1983. The satellite was put into a highly elliptical orbit, ~200,000 × 2,000 km. The orbit kept the craft far away from the Earth for 3.5 out of every 4 days. It was outside of the Earth's shadow and radiation belts for 90% of the time. The second major experiment, SKR-02M, aboard Astron was an X-ray spectrometer, which consisted of a proportional counter sensitive to 2-25 keV X-rays, with an effective area of 0.17 m2. The FOV was 3° × 3° (FWHM). Data could be telemetered in 10 energy channels. The instrument began taking data on April 3, 1983. International Year of Light 2015 (IYL 2015) (Chandra X-Ray Observatory). Spacelab 1 was the first Spacelab mission in orbit in the payload bay of the Space Shuttle (STS-9) between November 28 and December 8, 1983. An X-ray spectrometer, measuring 2-30 keV photons (although 2-80 keV was possible), was on the pallet. The primary science objective was to study detailed spectral features in cosmic sources and their temporal changes. The instrument was a gas scintillation proportional counter (GSPC) with ~ 180 cm2 area and energy resolution of 9% at 7 keV. The detector was collimated to a 4.5° (FWHM) FOV. There were 512 energy channels. Spartan 1 was deployed from the Space Shuttle Discovery (STS-51G) on June 20, 1985 and retrieved 45.5 hours later. The X-ray detectors aboard the Spartan platform were sensitive to the energy range 1-12 keV. The instrument scanned its target with narrowly collimated (5' × 3°) GSPCs. There were 2 identical sets of counters, each having ~ 660 cm2 effective area. Counts were accumulated for 0.812 s into 128 energy channels. The energy resolution was 16% at 6 keV. During its 2 days of flight, Spartan-1 observed the Perseus cluster of galaxies and the Galactic Center region. Ginga was launched on February 5, 1987. The primary instrument for observations was the Large Area Proportional Counter (LAC). The European Retrievable Carrier (EURECA) was launched July 31, 1992 by the Space Shuttle Atlantis, and put into an orbit at an altitude of 508 km. It began its scientific mission on August 7, 1992. EURECA was retrieved on July 1, 1993 by the Space Shuttle Endeavour and returned to Earth. On board was the WATCH or Wide Angle Telescope for Cosmic Hard X-rays instrument. The WATCH instrument was sensitive to 6-150 keV photons. The total field of view covered 1/4 of the celestial sphere. During its 11-month lifetime, EURECA tracked the Sun and WATCH gradually scanned across the entire sky. Some 2 dozen known X-ray sources were monitored—some for more than 100 days—and a number of new X-ray transients were discovered. The Diffuse X-ray Spectrometer (DXS) STS-54 package was flown as an attached payload in January, 1993 to obtain spectra of the diffuse soft X-ray background. DXS obtained the first-ever high resolution spectra of the diffuse soft X-ray background in the energy band from 0.15 to 0.28 keV (4.3-8.4 nm). X-1 X-ray sources XMM- Newton spectrum from superheated iron atoms at the inner edge of the accretion disk orbiting the neutron star in Serpens X-1. The line is usually a symmetrical peak, but it exhibits the classic features of distortion due to relativistic effects. The extremely fast motion of the iron-rich gas causes the line to spread out. The entire line has been shifted to longer wavelengths (left, red) because of the neutron star's powerful gravity. The line is brighter toward shorter wavelengths (right, blue) because Einstein's special theory of relativity predicts that a high-speed source beamed toward Earth will appear brighter than the same source moving away from Earth.

As all-sky surveys are performed and analyzed or once the first extrasolar X-ray source in each constellation is confirmed, it is designated X-1, e.g., Scorpius X-1 or Sco X-1. There are 88 official constellations. Often the first X-ray source is a transient. As X-ray sources have been better located, many of them have been isolated to extragalactic regions such as the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC). When there are often many individually discernible sources, the first one identified is usually designated as the extragalactic source X-1, e.g., Small Magellanic Cloud (SMC) X-1, a HMXRB, at 01h15m14s -73h42m22s. These early X-ray sources still are studied and often produce significant results. For example, Serpens X-1. As of August 27, 2007 discoveries concerning asymmetric iron line broadening and their implications for relativity have been a topic of much excitement. With respect to the asymmetric iron line broadening, Edward Cackett of the University of Michigan commented, \\"We're seeing the gas whipping around just outside the neutron star's surface,\\". \\"And since the inner part of the disk obviously can't orbit any closer than the neutron star's surface, these measurements give us a maximum size of the neutron star's diameter. The neutron stars can be no larger than 18 to 20.5 miles across, results that agree with other types of measurements.\\" \\"We've seen these asymmetric lines from many black holes, but this is the first confirmation that neutron stars can produce them as well. It shows that the way neutron stars accrete matter is not very different from that of black holes, and it gives us a new tool to probe Einstein's theory\\", says Tod Strohmayer of NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center. \\"This is fundamental physics\\", says Sudip Bhattacharyya also of NASA's in Greenbelt, Maryland and the University of Maryland. \\"There could be exotic kinds of particles or states of matter, such as quark matter, in the centers of neutron stars, but it's impossible to create them in the lab. The only way to find out is to understand neutron stars.\\" Using XMM-Newton, Bhattacharyya and Strohmayer observed Serpens X-1, which contains a neutron star and a stellar companion. Cackett and Jon Miller of the University of Michigan, along with Bhattacharyya and Strohmayer, used Suzaku's superb spectral capabilities to survey Serpens X-1. The Suzaku data confirmed the XMM-Newton result regarding the iron line in Serpens X-1. X-ray source catalogs Catalogs of X-ray sources have been put together for a variety of purposes including chronology of discovery, confirmation by X-ray flux measurement, initial detection, and X-ray source type. Sounding rocket X-ray source catalogs One of the first catalogs of X-ray sources published came from workers at the US Naval Research Laboratory in 1966 and contained 35 X-ray sources. Of these only 22 had been confirmed by 1968. An additional astronomical catalog of discrete X-ray sources over the celestial sphere by constellation contains 59 sources as of December 1, 1969, that at the least had an X-ray flux published in the literature. Early X-ray observatory satellite catalogs Each of the major observatory satellites had its own catalog of detected and observed X-ray sources. These catalogs were often the result of large area sky surveys. Many of the X-ray sources have names that come from a combination of a catalog abbreviation and the Right Ascension (RA) and Declination (Dec) of the object. For example, 4U 0115+63, 4th Uhuru catalog, RA=01 hr 15 min, Dec=+63°; 3S 1820-30 is the SAS-3 catalog; EXO 0748-676 is an Exosat catalog entry; HEAO 1 uses H; Ariel 5 is 3A; Ginga sources are in GS; general X-ray sources are in the X catalog. Of the early satellites, the Vela series X-ray sources have been cataloged. The Uhuru X-ray satellite made extensive observations and produced at least 4 catalogs wherein previous catalog designations were improved and relisted: 1ASE or 2ASE 1615+38 would appear successively as 2U 1615+38, 3U 1615+38, and 4U 1615+3802, for example. After over a year of initial operation the first catalog (2U) was produced. The third Uhuru catalog was published in 1974. The fourth and final Uhuru catalog included 339 sources. Although apparently not containing extrasolar sources from the earlier OSO satellites, the MIT/OSO 7 catalog contains 185 sources from the OSO 7 detectors and sources from the 3U catalog. The 3rd Ariel 5 SSI Catalog (designated 3A) contains a list of X-ray sources detected by the University of Leicester's Sky Survey Instrument (SSI) on the Ariel 5 satellite. This catalog contains both low and high galactic latitude sources and includes some sources observed by HEAO 1, Einstein, OSO 7, SAS 3, Uhuru, and earlier, mainly rocket, observations. The second Ariel catalog (designated 2A) contains 105 X-ray sources observed before April 1, 1977. Prior to 2A some sources were observed that may not have been included. The 842 sources in the HEAO A-1 X-ray source catalog were detected with the NRL Large Area Sky Survey Experiment on the HEAO 1 satellite. When EXOSAT was slewing between different pointed observations from 1983 to 1986, it scanned a number of X-ray sources (1210). From this the EXOSAT Medium Energy Slew Survey catalog was created. From the use of the Gas Scintillation Proportional Counter (GSPC) on board EXOSAT, a catalog of iron lines from some 431 sources was made available. Specialty and all-sky survey X-ray source catalogs The Catalog of High-Mass X-ray Binaries in the Galaxy (4th Ed.) contains source name(s), coordinates, finding charts, X-ray luminosities, system parameters, and stellar parameters of the components and other characteristic properties for 114 HMXBs, together with a comprehensive selection of the relevant literature. About 60% of the high-mass X-ray binary candidates are known or suspected Be/X-ray binaries, while 32% are supergiant/X-ray binaries (SGXB). For all the main-sequence and subgiant stars of spectral types A, F, G, and K and luminosity classes IV and V listed in the Bright Star Catalogue (BSC, also known as the HR Catalogue) that have been detected as X-ray sources in the ROSAT All-Sky Survey (RASS), there is the RASSDWARF - RASS A-K Dwarfs/Subgiants Catalog. The total number of RASS sources amounts to ~150,000 and in the BSC 3054 late-type main-sequence and subgiant stars of which 980 are in the catalog, with a chance coincidence of 2.2% (21.8 of 980).

The coding sequence for a nested gene differs greatly from the coding sequence for its external host gene. Typically, nested genes and their host genes encode functionally unrelated proteins, and have different expression patterns in an organism. There are two categories of nested genes: * genes nested within an intron of a larger gene * genes which lie opposite the coding sequence of a larger gene  Nested intronic genes  A nested intronic gene lies within the non-coding intronic region of a larger gene, and occurs relatively frequently, especially in the introns of metazoans and higher eukaryotes. Because only eukaryotic DNA contains intronic regions, this type of gene does not occur in bacteria or archaea.. The human genome contains a relatively high proportion of nested intronic genes. It is predicted to contain at least 158 functional intronic nested genes, with an additional 212 pseudogenes and three snoRNA genes nested in intronic regions. These genes seem to be distributed randomly across all chromosomes, and the majority code for proteins that are functionally unrelated to their host genes.  Genes nested opposite coding sequences  Genes nested opposite the coding sequences of their host genes are very rare, and have been observed in prokaryotes, and more recently, in yeast (S. cerevisiae) and in Tetrahymena thermophila. These non-intronic nested genes remain to be identified in metazoan genomes. As with intronic nested genes, nonintronic nested genes typically do not share functions or expression patterns with their host genes.
