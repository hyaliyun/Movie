He was the older brother of Ren√© Eschass√©riaux and father of Camille Eschass√©riaux, both of whom also had political careers. Before 1792 Joseph Eschass√©riaux studied law in the town of Saintes where his family were long- established aldermen. In 1775, at the age of 22, he began practising as a lawyer at the parlement of Bordeaux. In 1785 he became President of the Maronne tribunal, a post he held until the French Revolution. He became commander of the National Guard in his home town of Corme-Royal. In 1790 he was elected to the post of administrator of the district of Saintes and then joined the administration of the d√©partement of Charente-Inf√©rieure. In 1791 he was elected as a d√©put√© for Charente-Inf√©rieure to the Legislative Assembly. He was elected fourth out of six seats, with 243 out of 424 votes. He took his seat with the centrist majority of the Assembly. 1793-1799 On 5 September 1792 he was re-elected to the National Convention taking the third of eleven seats with 379 votes out of 575. He took his seats with the Mountain and, as a member of the Agriculture and Commerce Committee, was noted for his assiduous work producing reports on a range of subjects such as union with Belgium, the provision of basic goods and the work of the police. At the trial of Louis XVI he voted for the king's death. In August 1973 his brother Ren√©, who had less radical views, also became a member of the Convention. During theThermidorian Reaction Eschass√©riaux declared himself against Robespierre. Four days later, on 13 Thermidor (31 July 1794), he was elected to the Committee of Public Safety as Robespierre's supporters were removed, with the support of his friend Bar√®re. He remained in the Committee for two months, taking charge of commerce and the supply of goods. As a left Thermidorian, he was opposed to the growing reaction and defending the continued existence of the political clubs. He left his post on 16 Vend√©miaire Year III (7 October 1794) and remained aligned with moderate republicans. On 15 Vend√©miaire Year IV (7 October 1795) he came back onto the Committee of Public Safety, just after the crushing of the Royalist insurrection. He took charge of the same portfolio he had managed during his previous term of office. That same month, October 1795, he was elected to the Council of Five Hundred by Charente- Inf√©rieure, as well as by fifteen other d√©partements. He was re-elected throughout the period of the Directory and became secretary of the Council in May 1796. As he had done under the Convention, he prepared reports on a number of topics, principally to do with administrative and colonial questions, including Saint-Domingue. He supported the constitutional clubs, which had succeeded the revolutionary political clubs, and remained hostile to the Catholic Church. In 1797 he married Louise, the daughter of Gaspard Monge and Marie-Catherine Huart, with whom he had children. Their son Camille Eschass√©riaux was a d√©put√© under the July Monarchy. Later career and retirement Eschass√©riaux enthusiastically supported the Coup of 18 Brumaire and became a member of the Tribunat, where he served for seven years. In 1806 Napol√©on named him charg√© d'affaires for the Republic of Valais, and then Minister Plenipotentiary to the Principality of Lucca and Piombino until 1809. He was awarded the L√©gion d'honneur and was later made a Baron of the Empire in 1810. On his return from Lucca, he devoted himself to writing about history. He retired to Saintes in 1814 but signed the Acte additionnel supporting Napoleon's return during the Hundred Days. In 1816, with the Bourbon Restoration he went into exile as a regicide. He fled first to Courtrai and then to Huy, but after just three years of exile he was given permission by Louis XVIII to return to France. He retired to his property at Th√©nac where he died in 1824 at the age of seventy.

It was owned by Ludvig Holberg from 1745 to 1756. He left it to Sor√∏ Academy and it has now been converted into a self-owning foundation and contains a Holberg exhibition. The main building is listed. The main building was listed on the Danish registry of protected buildings and places by the Danish Heritage Agency on in 1918. History Early history Tersl√∏segaard traces its history back to the 13th century. The first known owner was Anders Knudsen Gros√∏n. He was married to Esbern Snare's daughter. It was acquired by Jens Grubbe in 1305 and was then owned by his descendants for more than a hundred years. The last member of the Grubbe family to own Tersl√∏segaard was Niels Grubbe. He had no sons and the estate was therefore passed on to his son-in-law Anders Jensen Passow. Members of the Passow family owned Tersl√∏segaard with few interruptions until the beginning of the 16th century when it came into the possession of the Bishopric of Roskilde. It was after the Reformation confiscated by the Crown and then granted to Mads Erolsen B√∏lle who had assisted Christian II in the defence of Copenhagen. Both he and his daughter are buried in Tersk√∏se Church. Tersl√∏segaard remained in the B√∏lle family until 1604. The nexct owner was Steen Brahe, a brother of the astronomer Tyge Brahe. He was a member of the Privy Council for 32 years and held Kalundborg Castle in fee for 28 years. Lydvig Holberg and Sor√∏ Academy Ludvig Holberg, c. 1748 Ludvig Holberg purchased Tersl√∏segaard with churches and tenant farms in 1745. He had already previously acquired Brobygaard at Slagelse. He was involved in the efforts to reopen Sor√∏ Academy. Being both unmarried childless, he agreed to leave his estates, library and most of his fortune to the academy. The agreement with the king included that Holberg earned the title of Baron of Holberg. This meant that he would be free of taxes from any income from his estatestime. The new Sor√∏ Academy was inaugurated on 26 July 1949. Map of the fields under Tersl√∏segaard, 1816 He spent his summers on the estate and commented: \\"I enjoy watching the crops grow and being harvested and to watch the cows walk in procession to their gathering places in the morning and evening\\". He lost almost all his cattle in a single week when cattle disease hit Denmark in the middle of the century. Many landowners immediately purchased new cattle and lost then again in the next outbreak but Holberg replaced them with sheep and horses. Holberg died in 1756. Holberg's casket, a work of Johannes Wiedewelt, can be seen in Sor√∏ Monastery Church. His will determined that a few of the rooms should be made available to a \\"good widow\\". In 1816, Sor√∏ Academy sold most of the land off in lots. Most of the parcels were acquired by the owner of nearby Kammersgave. Later history Tersl√∏segaard I the second half of the 19th century The main building fell into despair and was in 1861 sold in auction. The buyer was G. F. R. Gr√ºner, a former student at the academy. He was joined by three other former students in his effort to preserve the estate and the widow's residence. They was granted royal approval of \\"Four former Soranian Alumni's Preservation of Holberg's Widow Seat at Tersk√∏segaard\\" in 1862. The estate was managed by a board consisting of the count of Frijsenborg, the barons of Lehn and Juellinge and the owner of Tersl√∏se. After G. F. R. Gr√ºner's death in 1890 Tersl√∏segaard once again fell into neglect and the remaining land was sold off. Holberg's library at Tersl√∏segaard, 1919 The Soranian Society of former students at Sor√∏ Academy established a fubnd- raising committee. It acquired Tersk√∏segaard in 1905 and completed a comprehensive refurbishment of the building in 1916. It was subsequently turned into a self-owning institution. Architecture Tersl√∏segaard is a three-winged complex with a half hipped red tile roof. It is built with timber framing but has been rendered white. The oldest part of the building is from 1832. It was lengthened and expanded with the two side wings in the second half of the century. The cellar is from the Middle Ages. It was thoroughly restored by Martin Nyrop iafter the committee had acquired the building in 1905. The building was also refurbished in 1930 and 2012. The building was listed on the Danish registry of protected buildings and places by the Danish Heritage Agency on 23 December1982.

The film stars Stanley Tucci as a college professor who becomes obsessed with a student (Addison Timlin). The film had its world premiere at the Los Angeles Film Festival on June 19, 2017.  Plot  Ted Swenson (Stanley Tucci), after publishing his first novel, which earns him a little fame, begins his career as a creative writing teacher at the (fictional) Euston College in Vermont, hoping to soon leave it after he publishes another hit novel, but gets stuck in that job for about 10 years and becomes a tenured professor. One of his students, Angela Argo (Addison Timlin) requests him to read the first chapter of her novel, 'Eggs', which he does and finds the writing style impressive. His colleague Magda (Janeane Garofalo) tells him about the vulgar poems Angela wrote when she took her class, and tells him that she actually insisted on making it a donation to the college library. Though librarians found the poetry about a phone sex worker rather obscene, they decided to keep it as an act of good faith. Ted checks out that poetry book which primarily consists of erotic conversations between a phone sex worker named Angela 911 and her clients. Later, he attends a dinner at his colleague's place along with his wife Sherrie (Kyra Sedgwick), where they all discuss about new campus sexual harassment rule-book and how political correctness is affecting their teaching style. Ted praises Angela's writing and encourages her to write more; she in turn gives him increasingly erotic later chapters of her novel. Ted, reading her novel, which is about a teenage girl sexualizing her science teacher, starts imagining himself as that science teacher but tries to keep their relationship professional. One day, Angela asks him to give her a ride to Burlington to get a new laptop. After returning to the school, she invites him into her dorm room to set up her computer. Though reluctant, Ted follows her and soon, she comes onto him and they quickly begin to have sex. However, before they can finish, Ted's weak tooth comes out and they humorously decide to postpone sex for some other time. While leaving her room, Ted meets one of his other students who eyes him suspiciously. One day during class, Angela blatantly tells another student that her plot and characters are weak. While the students expect Ted to reprimand her, he does nothing and, after everyone leaves, Angela asks Ted to show her novel to his agent. Though surprised, Ted agrees and actually meets his agent but the agent shows disinterest in reading a newbie's novel. Later, Ted tries to explain the situation to Angela but she becomes furious, shouting that she only slept with him in hopes of getting to a reputed agent through him. Shocked, Ted says he didn't think their relationship had anything to do with business and Angela angrily leaves. The next day, Ted gets a call from the university board and learns that Angela has filed a sexual harassment suit against him and produced tape of their previous day‚Äôs conversation as proof. Everyone, including his wife, blames him and, after his students and some faculty members testify against him, he loses his job, marriage and reputation. However, Angela gets a call from Ted's agent, who now shows interest in her work in light of the controversy. Fifteen months later, Ted is seen writing his memoirs in a cafeteria and when he sees a woman at his table reading the 'Eggs' novel, he asks her how she likes the book.

The protoconch contains 1¬Ω smooth whorls, forming a rather elevated apex. The subsequent whorls are well rounded, shouldered at the summit, and marked by strong spiral cords, of which 3 occur upon the first two whorls between the sutures, and 4 upon the penultimate whorl. The base of the body whorl is marked by eight additional cords, which equal those between the sutures in strength and have about the same spacing. The spaces between these spiral cords are about as wide as the cords. In addition to the spiral cords, the whorls are marked by slender axial ribs, which are slightly protractive. Of these ribs, 12 occur upon the first, 16 upon the second and 28 upon the last whorl. The junctions of the axial ribs with the spiral cords form slender tubercles, while the spaces enclosed between them appear as well rounded, strongly impressed pits. On the anterior half of the base, the axial riblets become much enfeebled, so that here the pitting is less apparent. The sutures are strongly constricted. The aperture is moderately large, decidedly channeled posteriorly and anteriorly. The outer lip is thin, showing the external sculpture within. The inner edge of the columella and the parietal wall is covered with a thin callus.P.

Early life Cowan lived in Durban, South Africa, before moving to Kambalda, Western Australia at the age of four. Coaching career After completing high school, Cowan contacted all sixteen AFL clubs to seek a coaching position. After no interest from fifteen of the clubs, agreed to meet with her and appointed her as a Western Australian based talent scout at just seventeen years of age. At 21 years of age, Cowan became the first female assistant coach in the West Australian Football League (WAFL) when she became the midfield coach with the West Perth Football Club. She spent eight years with West Perth before moving to the South Fremantle Football Club, also as the midfield coach. In 2013, she was appointed the senior coach of the Melbourne Football Club's women's team during the women's exhibition series and in the same year she was named as the Football Woman of the Year. She coached Melbourne for all three years of the exhibition series - winning 5 out of the 6 matches and in February 2016, she became the first female assistant coach in Melbourne's history and the second in AFL history when she became the player development and welfare coach. Due to family reasons she left the club in July and became the inaugural coach of the Fremantle AFL Women's team. After entering the inaugural AFL Women's season as favourites to win the premiership, Fremantle failed to live up to the pre-season expectation with the AFL head of female football and junior development, Josh Vanderloo, stating the reason was most likely due to injuries to key players and losing elite Western Australian talent to other states as marquee signings. Cowan finished the season with one win, five losses and a draw. Fremantle finished the 2018 season with three wins, finishing seventh. Cowan was in discussions to extend her contract for the 2019 season, but instead chose to resign as head coach. Cowan was approached by West Coast Eagles after leaving Fremantle, who offered her a contract for the 2020 AFLW season. She is also currently the AFL‚Äôs High Performance Coach / Mentor for the Female Coach Academy.

Early life Louisa Belle Howard was born in Bellefonte, Pennsylvania, on August 27, 1857. She was the only daughter of Samuel Gill and Mary Spencer (1834-1906), and granddaughter of William Spencer, Emporia pioneer. With her parents, at the age of eight years, she moved to Emporia, Kansas, where she was placed in the model department of the State Normal School, and remained a student in that institution for ten years. Howard inherited from her father musical talent of a high order, and literary talent from her mother. Her musical studies have gone hand in hand with her literary work. Career At the age of eighteen years Belle Howard began to teach. She gave lessons in music with her school-teaching. After seven years of successful work in the public schools of Lyon County, Kansas, in the vicinity of Emporia, Howard moved with her family to El Dorado, Kansas, teaching in the El Dorado city schools with marked success for a period of three years. She resigned her position in El Dorado to devote her energies exclusively to musical and literary work, and organized a prosperous music school at her home. When Garfield University was opened in Wichita, Kansas, she moved there from El Dorado for further study and development for herself and children. She obtained a position in the Wichita schools with a salary sufficient to meet all her expenses, tuition in the University and support of her family. Twenty-five years of Howard's life have been spent in the school- room, as student and teacher. She was connected with the Mozart Conservatory of Music and the Western School of Elocution and Oratory. She also taught at Guthrie, Oklahoma, the college at Waitsburg, Washington, and the Grandview School near Emporia. Her entertainments were generally given in churches, and she was assisted by her daughter. Personal life Soon after starting a career as teacher, Belle Howard married Dr. Ervin P. Howard (died in 1917), but it was an unfortunate marriage, and after three years, she was left alone with her two infant children. Among other duties the care of an invalid mother fell to her. After years of struggles she failed in health and was forced to abandon labor of all kinds. After two years of rest she gained strength enough to take up again life's duties, and with her twelve-year-old daughter, May Belle, began to give musical and elocutionary entertainments. Many painful experiences came to her, accompanied by the serious and protracted illness of her mother, herself, and lastly of her son, but she persevered in the work of her life's effort and ambition. Her daughter became at the same time a violinist, elocutionist and vocalist of marked skill. Later in life she lived in Wichita with her daughter May Belle Howard (1879-1968) and son Guello/Guy Payne Howard. She died on November 11, 1947, at her home at 1425 Lawrence, Emporia, Kansas, and was buried at Maplewood Cemetery.

Fives later lined out with the junior team before making his senior debut for Waterford in 1949. Over the course of the next few seasons he was a regular member of the starting fifteen. Fives later played for Galway for five seasons, ending his time there in 1959 as a two- time All-Ireland Senior Hurling Championship runner-up. Two year later he was back on the inter-county scene as a member of the Roscommon junior team. Fives won three successive Connacht Junior Hurling Championship medals before retiring from inter-county hurling. Fives was selected for the Rest of Ireland team on a number of occasions between 1952 and 1959. He also lined out with Connacht, however, he ended his career without a Railway Cup medal.

Sticky pads are used to fix items to otherwise smooth surface that is leaned or that moves, so that objects put on that surface could off due to insufficient friction when the surface inclines or moves. The pad has large friction coefficient both with the base surface and with the item laid on it, which prevent both the sticky pad from moving with respect to the surface, and objects laid on the pad from moving relative to the pad. Sticky pads are commonly used on car dashboards where forces caused by acceleration of the vehicle would cause objects put on dashboards slip off the otherwise smooth surface of the dashboard. Contrary to fasteners, sticky pads do not affix objects to the surface. They merely prevent objects from slipping on the surface until the threshold acceleration or inclination angle is exceeded. Sticky pads also usually don't make use of adhesives. Because of this they are easily detached form the surface, and they need gravity to serve their purpose. In particular, the force acting on the object must have a component perpendicular on the surface and directed towards it. This is different from Microsuction tape where adhesion of object is achieved by microscopic bubbles on the surface that function as small suction cups. Sticky pads are made of rubber-like materials. This help dissipate kinetic energy when the base surface vibrates, such that object on the pad keep maintaining large enough contact surface with the pad and tangential friction forces keep preventing objects from slipping relative to the pad. Principle of operation Although basic principles of sticky pads are simple, physics behind may be complex due to many specific and sometimes conflicting requirements arising from practical use. Mechanisms involved in high friction materials go beyond simple Coulomb friction. These can be combined by other mechanisms such as energy dissipation in viscous materials or adhesion. The above requirements impose many design challenges. To operate well on vibrating surfaces, pads are usually made of soft, rubber like materials with very high friction coefficients. Designs seek to achieve certain level of adhesion (e.g. for use on vertical or very steep surfaces) without compromising easy detachment and continuous use without residual left-over. Some applications (such as sticking smartphones or tablets to vertical surface) require high degree of reliability, which is difficult to achieve without strong sticking to the surfaces. Various innovative approaches and engineered materials are used to keep in line with requirements. Some designs apply sticking based on vacuum in addition to high friction and softness (see e.g. micro-suction tapes). Other development includes designs that find inspiration in nature, especially in animals that are able to climb walls and ceilings such as geckos, various species of insects , tree frogs , or chameleons. Mechanisms of insects that can scale walls and ceilings help understand how to produce surfaces with extremely high friction that don't exhibit too much sticking for practical applications. Abilities of geckos have been intensively studied to find out how sticking of vertical walls or ceilings can be joined with ability of easy and quick detachment that enables geckos quick movement. It has been discovered that Van der Waals force rather than friction or adhesion is the most important mechanism behind gecko's abilities. This implies that artificial designs mimicking geckos' feet should rely on maximizing surface contact between object and the pad, which is less practical in some situations, for example when pads are used on non-flat surfaces or when objects put on the pad don't have flat surfaces. On the other hand, mechanisms in geckos' feet help design materials with reliable sticking and easy detachment at the same time. Mechanisms used in geckos, tree frogs and some insects were also studied for self-cleaning ability, which would enable artificial materials retain the ability to prevent sliding after continuous use in dirty environments.

The Hope Waddell Training Institution is named after him. Early life and training Waddell was born in Monaghan, Ireland on 14 November 1804 to Susan Hope and the son of Alexander Waddell both members of the Presbyterian Church of Ireland. He expressed an early interest in joining the ministry however was discouraged in doing so due to a speech impediment. At the age of 17 he apprenticed with a druggist before leaving, in 1822 ,to study for the church. He was accepted as a candidate for the missionary in 1825 by the Scottish Missionary Society and in 1827 entered the United Secession Hall.  Missionary work in Jamaica  Following Waddell's ordainment in 1829, he married Jessie Simpson and together they embarked on a mission to Jamaica with the Church of Scotland Mission. Here he worked with the enslaved population of Cornwall until 1831, when the Baptist War slave revolt broke out. Many blamed the revolt on the Christian and Baptist missions due to giving the slaves ideas about equality and freedom. Waddell gives an account of this in Twenty-nine years in the West Indies and Central Africa: a review of missionery work and adventure. 1829-1858. He remained in Jamaica until 1834, when owing to his wife's illness the couple left Jamaica.  Missionary work in Nigeria  He subsequently gained Church of Scotland Mission approval for a mission Nigeria in 1845, and he arrived in the village of Old Calabar in 1846 accompanied by former members of his congregation who wished to ‚Äúcarry the gospel to their native land\\". In 1847 he moved the mission to Creek Town and worked educating the local population, teaching them English and converting them to Christianity. He made attempts to stop the practice of infanticide in the area, building a settlement for twins and their mothers so as to isolate them from the rest of the population, and allowing them to live. In addition, he managed to procure various agreements to abolish human sacrifice in the surrounding area. He also worked to limit the spread of what was most likely yellow fever in the villages, through use of calomel. While in Nigeria he learned Efik and built a relationship with King Eyo Honesty II, the ruler of the area at the time. Following a leave of absence in 1853, the relationship between Waddell and his colleagues at the mission began to become strained, a possible cause for his eventual retirement from the mission in 1858, officially due to illness. Death and legacy Following his return from Nigeria, Waddell established a missionary congregation and eventually retired to his home in Dublin. Days before Waddell‚Äôs death on April 18, 1895, a school was founded in Duke Town, Nigeria and named the Hope Waddell Institute (later known as the Hope Waddell Training Institution) in honour of his work. It continues to run to this day and has produced many Nigerian politicians.

She served as the assistant recording secretary (1878‚Äì80), corresponding secretary (1880‚Äì93), and a member of the Our Union publication committee (1876‚Äì83) of the National Woman's Christian Temperance Union (WCTU); as well as the president (1904) and corresponding secretary (1875‚Äì86) of the Connecticut WCTU. She also originated the plan of the Loyal Temperance Legion, the children's society of the WCTU. Buell wrote extensively for temperance publications, and other papers and magazines. She made her home in East Hampton, Connecticut. Early life and education Caroline Brown was born in Marlborough, Massachusetts, October 24, 1843. Her ancestry was New England and Puritan. She was the daughter of Rev. Thomas Gibson Brown (died in 1885), of the New England Conference of the Methodist Episcopal Church, and Caroline M. Daniels (1808-1892). Her paternal ancestry was early transplanted from England to New England, in the area, now known as New Hampshire. Caroline's grandfather became a rampant rebel, and shouldering his gun, marched to Bunker's Hill, and helped to \\"fire the shot heard round the world.\\" His wife, too, was of vigorous stock, a hearty Yankee woman, who nurtured her little family of fifteen boys and girls. She was able to hold her own in an argument, and even when vanquished she could argue still. Both she and her husband lived to old age, as did their fathers and mothers before them, and they died near a hundred years old. The pioneer spirit also possessed the maternal ancestry, which was imported into New England in the earliest period of its history, in the Mayflower, and colonized finally in Connecticut. She was the only daughter of an itinerant Methodist minister. Forced to struggle with adverse circumstances and conditions, she grew to early womanhood with a sound physical constitution and a gradually developed, vigorous mental character. Burning with desire for larger intellectual culture, she embraced every means afforded her to that end, and supplemented the discipline of trial and the tuition of experience with earnest study and diligent reading as opportunity offered, both in and outside the regular curriculum of school life. In such a school, by such severe discipline, were developed the traits which made her a counsellor and adviser. She was educated in public and private schools. Career Caroline Brown Buell On August 25, 1862, in East Hampton, Connecticut, the day before he left to join the Union Army in the Civil War, she married Lt. Frederick W. H. Buell, of the 18th Connecticut Infantry Regiment. He died during the war in 1865. During the war her father, husband and three brothers also served the Union, three in the army and two brothers in the navy. Her father was the chaplain of her husband's regiment, and in war, he earned the name of \\"The Fighting Chaplain.\\" During those years, Buell worked, watched and waited, and in the last year of the conflict, her husband died, leaving her alone with her only son. The war record of her family made her a favorite with the veterans of the war. In ensuing years, after the death of her eldest brother's wife, Buell hastened to take the care of his motherless children. Here, she spent more than three years of her life. It was here she was found when, in 1876, she was chosen to be the Corresponding Secretary of the WCTU of Connecticut, which had been organized in some measure the preceding year. She entered at once into the work devolved upon her, and gave to the organization the benefit of her executive ability, so that speedily, the WCTU in Connecticut was put into orderly and effective shape. Her sound judgment, her powers of discrimination, her energy, her acquaintance with facts and persons, and her facile pen made her at once a power in the association. She came into office when much was new and experimental, and she gave positive direction to the work and originated many plans of procedure. It was in her first year as Corresponding Secretary of the Connecticut Union that she devised the plan of quarterly returns, that went on to be adopted all over the country by the various State Unions. Annually, since that period, Buell was honored by re- election to the Corresponding Secretary's position. At an executive meeting held at the close of the WCTU's Newark Convention in 1876, a publishing committee was appointed, which included Buell, representing Connecticut, as well as Mary Towne Burt, New York; Jane M. Geddes, Michigan; Frances E. Willard, Illinois; Esther Pugh, Ohio, Harriet Maria Haven, Vermont and Zerelda G. Wallace, Indiana. Buell, Burt, and Willard were made a quorum for the transaction of business. The quorum at once renamed the WCTU organ to Our Union, made Burt publisher, and Margaret Elizabeth Winslow, of Brooklyn, editor. According to Gifford (1995), Buell, Pugh, and Frances H. Rastall went on to use the Union Signal to promote their private businesses. In 1880, in the Boston convention, Buell was chosen corresponding secretary of the National WCTU, and in that position she did effective work with her writing and lecturing for the association. She was re-elected to that office regularly for twelve years. Upon the platform, as a speaker before an audience, she was always self-poised, self-unconscious, earnest, and impressive. She was a dignified presiding officer and an accomplished parliamentarian, and in State conventions she had often filled the chair in emergencies. Buell was a member of the National American Woman Suffrage Association, the National Purity Association, Sorosis, and the Century Study Clubs. She died in 1927 and is buried at Lakeview Cemetery, East Hampton, Connecticut.

It was built from 1856 to 1887, near the Old Church of Saint George, previous cathedral church of the same eparchy. The cathedral was burned and severely damaged by Albanian mobs during the 2004 unrest, but was later renovated. History Modern Serbian Orthodox Cathedral of Saint George in Prizren was built in the second half of the 19th century, during the Ottoman rule in the region. Initiative for the creation of a new cathedral church was launched during the first half of the 19th century, and only after long negotiations with Ottoman authorities final permission was obtained in 1855, and foundation was laid in 1856. Up to that point, minor Old Church of Saint George served as a temporary cathedral church of the Eparchy of Ra≈°ka and Prizren, since Ottoman authorities previously took over the ancient medieval Cathedral of the Holy Mother of God (Bogorodica Ljevi≈°ka) in Prizren, and turned it into a mosque. Local leaders of Eastern Orthodox Christians knew that ancient cathedral will not be returned to them as long as Prizren is under Ottoman rule, and therefore decided to build a new cathedral. Foundations were laid in 1856, but construction was completed in 1887. Prolonged construction was caused by constant financial and administrative difficulties. After the consecration of the new cathedral in 1887, additional efforts were undertaken in order to complete the internal inventory and decoration of the church. Significant acquisitions were made during the tenure of metropolitan Dionisije Petroviƒá of Ra≈°ka and Prizren (1896-1900), and his successor, metropolitan Niƒáifor Periƒá (1901-1911). Both of them were Serbian Orthodox hierarchs, appointed by the Ecumenical Patriarchate of Constantinople. Major turning point in the history of the Cathedral occurred at the beginning of the First Balkan War (1912‚Äî1913). In the autumn of 1912, Prizren was annexed by the Kingdom of Serbia. In the spring of 1913, rector of the Serbian Orthodox Seminary of Prizren, protopresbyter Stevan Dimitrijeviƒá was appointed as administrator of the Eparchy. Under the Treaty of London (1913), Albanian-majority Prizren was officially annexed to Serbia. During the First World War (1914-1918), the region was occupied by the armies of the Central Powers from the end of 1915 up to the autumn of 1918. After the liberation in 1918, new Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes (Yugoslavia) was created, and included all territories of Serbia. After the Serbian Patriarchate was renewed in 1920, Eparchy of Ra≈°ka and Prizren was returned to the jurisdiction of the Serbian Orthodox Church, and the Cathedral of Saint George in Prizren was confirmed as the official cathedral church of the Eparchy. In 1941, Kingdom of Yugoslavia was attacked and occupied by Nazi Germany and its allies. The central parts of the Eparchy of Ra≈°ka and Prizren, including the city of Prizren, were occupied by Italians. Formally, Italian occupation zone was annexed to Fascist Albania. That marked the beginning of mass persecution of some ethnic groups in Prizren, and other annexed regions of Metohija (Dukagjini) and central Kosovo. During that period, many Serbian churches of the Eparchy of Ra≈°ka were looted and destroyed by the Italian army,.  March Pogrom of 2004 and restoration  After the Kosovo War (1999), territory of Kosovo including Prizren, was placed under the administration of the United Nations Interim Administration Mission in Kosovo. During the March Pogrom of 2004, Serbian Orthodox Cathedral of Saint George in Prizren was looted and set on fire by local extremists. Only after many difficulties, the cathedral was gradually restored during next few years.

The most forceful Russification was enforced onto children, due to their poor knowledge of Polish culture and language. History The self-will of Grand Duke Konstantin and the infraction of the Constitution of the Kingdom of Poland, together with the rise of secret societies, led to the November Uprising (1830-1831). The intensification of Russification occurred after the aforesaid uprising failed, leading to the abolishment of the Constitution of 1815 (granting the Kingdom of Poland national autonomy). In 1832, with the implementation of the Organic Statute of the Kingdom of Poland, the Sejm was liquidated along with the Kingdom's armed forces, Russian institutions and law was implemented and any aide to the November Uprising had their landed property seized. Martial law was implemented in 1833. All decisions were given by Russian military chiefs, and Namiestnik Ivan Paskevich. The retained Council of State (until 1914) had a Russian majority. Gradually, most aspects of society were subject to central authority in St. Petersburg. The Vilnius University, Krzemieniec Lyceum and other Polish gymnasiums were liquidated. The Russian monetary system was implemented in 1841, followed by the Russian code of law in 1847. The next move forward was to subordinate the Kingdom of Poland to the Russian Namiestnik, Ivan Paskevich. In 1837, Polish voivodeships, forming the administrative division of the Kingdom, were renamed to governates, reflecting the Imperial Russian model. Fa√ßade of the Staszic Palace where after 1893, the Tserkva of St. Tatiana of Rome was set up, with a Byzantine-Russian style, showcasing the architectural element of Russification in Warsaw The next exacerbation of Russification came after the failed January Uprising (1863-1864): the implementation of an interminable, the Russification of administrative and educational institutions, the liquidation of the Uniate Church in January 1874, Russian soldiers killed at least ten Uniates in Drel√≥w and thirteen in Pratulin. Poles underwent expulsions and were expropriated. Initially, Polish town names were Russified. In 1869, the Warsaw Main School was closed down, and in its location, the Russian language Imperial University was opened. The years 1869-1885 saw the systematic removal of the Polish language from the education system, the end result, in 1885, was its placement as a second, uncompulsory school language. Only religion was taught in Polish. Dmitry Ilovaysky's history text books were enforced in school history classes, falsifying history and as such continually implemented Russification. Additionally, the Russian language was introduced into folk schools. Conclusively, speaking the Polish language was banned in institutions of education. There was also an attempt to introduce the Cyrillic alphabet into Polish. The budget of the Kingdom of Poland was amalgamated into that of the Russian Empire. In 1874, the position of Namiestnik was replaced by Governate- General. The Governate-General would head the Warsaw Military District that encompassed all of Congress Poland. The symbolic figure behind the Russification was Governate-General of the Warsaw Military District, Alexander Apukthin, who inter alia introduced the education of skilled informers and the double-crossing of students, which became fundamental to the policing in schools. In 1869, Russian became the sole legal language for courts and the administration. In 1875, the then Polish court procedure was abolished in favour of its Russian counterpart. Until World War I, the Kingdom of Poland was beset by \\"extraordinary rights\\", by which the Governate-General had the authority to bring any civil individual to trial at a military court, or send them into the Russian Far East if they are deemed a \\"political suspect\\". In 1885, the Bank of Poland was replaced by a cantor of the Russian State Bank. More radical Russification occurred in parts of the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth, that after the Partitions were not incorporated into the Kingdom of Poland and instead directly into the Russian Empire. The Vilnius University and Krzemieniec Lyceum were closed down, as a retribution for the participation of the students in the November Uprising. Between 1832 and 1834, by royal prerogative of Tsar Nicholas I, several thousand Polish families were expelled to Siberia from Wo≈Çyn and Podole. When in 1839 the Uniate Church was liquidated, its followers and priests were forced to convert to Eastern Orthodoxy. The Roman Catholic Church saw further restrictions, with its landed wealth seized, after proclaiming support for the January Uprising. Property was similarly seized from the participants of the January Uprising, with land proprietors having an additional tax levied onto their property. It was prohibited for Poles to buy land. Polish theatres, periodicals, schools and societies were liquidated. The aforesaid methods of Russification were also enforced on other non-Russian populations, with the type of severity dependent on the locality.

During the first 36 years of his career his paintings were entirely non-figurative. His style changed in 1995 when he moved his studio from New York City to a rural community in upstate New York. While continuing to be abstract his paintings thereafter contained figurative elements and were seen to have greater emotional content. Throughout his career his work frequently appeared in solo and group exhibitions in both commercial and public galleries. It has been collected by the Museum of Modern Art, Metropolitan Museum of Art, Guggenheim Museum, National Gallery of Art, and other major American art museums. He received a Guggenheim Fellowship in 1981 and a National Endowment for the Arts grant in 1983. Early life and training Berthot was born on March 30, 1939 in Niagara Falls, New York, and, from age two, was raised on a truck farm in Clearfield, Pennsylvania, 175 miles to the south. As a child, he received his first drawing lessons from his maternal grandmother who was also his primary caregiver. Having completed his education at local public schools, he briefly enrolled in a commercial art school in Pittsburgh before moving on to New York where, from 1960 to 1962, he attended evening classes at Pratt Institute and from 1960 to 1961 at the New School for Social Research. Berthot later credited a Pratt instructor, Hank Raleigh, with getting him a start as a professional painter. The classes he took gave him relatively little grounding in the technique or history of art, but he learned much from hours spent in museums. He also learned much from other artists, particularly Milton Resnick who, as he later said, took him under his wing and through his friendship and guidance I became more aware of the real possibility of painting.\\" Career Artistic style Jake Berthot, \\"Lovella's Thing,\\" 1969, acrylic on shaped canvas, 84 x 72 inches Berthot began his career making abstract paintings in the minimalist tradition. He would apply a thick painterly surface to large shaped canvases that were seen to employ the reductive means of minimalism, but expressing instead of restraining emotion. Despite its simplicity of means, his work was said to deal \\"more in feelings than in analysis.\\" Painted in 1969, \\"Lovella's Thing\\" is a good example of his style at this time. Shortly before his death, Berthot explained the way in which it evolved: \\"With Lovella's Thing I originally thought of painting the middle a flat, blank color, but when I got into it, putting down a lot of acrylic washes, I just started to paint it in a more felt way. So it became a kind of dialect between something very concrete and something very felt. I liked the blunt presence the shape had on the wall and then penetrating the surface in the middle in what I suppose could be called a Rothkoesque kind of way.\\" In the mid-1970s Berthot's style evolved. His work continued to have a painterly, lyrical quality, but he added bright colors to the muted palette of earlier work and introduced rectangular bars and ovals into canvases that were now simple rectangles. Regarding the bars, he later said that he worked to uncover the tension points, or focal points, that were inherent in the vertical and horizontal axes of a grid. He said he sought \\"a balance between the object and the opening,\\" and thereby \\"to gradually achieve balance between my two influences: the systemic and the felt.\\" \\"Yellow Bar With Red,\\" of 1977 is typical of paintings in this period. Another well-known painting from this period, \\"Walken's Ridge,\\" 1975-1976, is somewhat unusual. Although a pure abstraction, it has the size and shape of Monet's Water Lily paintings--14 feet wide in two equal sections-- and has, as Berthot said, the feel of a landscape. Jake Berthot, \\"Walken's Ridge,\\" 1975-1976, oil on canvas mounted on wood, two panels, 60.125 x 152.7 inches overall During the 1980s Berthot began to exhibit etchings and drawings along with his paintings. The drawings were often graphite on a background of a gray enamel. The lines frequently formed ovoid shapes and were accompanied by quasi-calligraphic markings. A critic said this work contained a \\"poetic lyricism\\" that could be accessed \\"not at a cognitive level but at a more elemental, intuitive one.\\" Berthot later told an interviewer that in it \\"gradually feeling began to predominate.\\" The paintings of this period continued to employ ovals and rectangles in canvases on which the \\"materiality of pigment,\\" as one critic noted, produced \\"a highly tactile surface.\\" Another critic wrote that \\"the shimmering, encrusted surfaces of the 'ovals' are reminiscent of Claude Monet's late Waterlilies. The use of gold with deep reds and bright blues recall Medieval icons.\\" Of his work at this time, Berthot said: \\"I try to break the code of painting and let it take on its own life without any code.\\" Jake Berthot, \\"Hard Line,\\" 1980-1983, oil on linen, 60 x 50 inches During the early 1990s, Berthot continued to employ bars and ovals in paintings. Of this period in his career, Berthot later said, \\"I reached another point where the idea was closing in on itself, there was too much idea; the paintings started to feel too literal, too much like a figure in space. I wanted something more organic, more felt.\\" He said that he wanted to \\"make the painting something you experience rather than just see.\\" His \\"Hard Line\\" of 1980-83 is an early example of this approach, showing a rectangle in a muted background having bright accents that a critic said were and unexpected fiery flame. In 1994, Pepe Karmel, writing in the New York Times, said of works like these: \\"Despite the lack of recognizable imagery, the paintings seem haunted by a nostalgia for representation.\\" The oval shape appears as well in Berthot's drawings and etchings of this period some of which had representational content, including most often an ovoid skull. Apart from a brief period spent in Maine, Berthot had lived in New York City from the time he moved there in 1959 until the day in 1994 when he moved his home and studio about 100 miles north of the city to a rural spot in Ulster County along the Hudson Valley in the foothills of the Catskill Mountains. At this time he made a gradual transition from abstract paintings that had no clear subject to ones that, while continuing to be abstract in character, had the natural environment as their subject. Of this transition, Berthot said: \\"Even though my work now is landscape-based, it is more abstract than it was a few years ago. It is dealing with the space in the middle. At first I was painting the volume of the tree in space. Next, what I felt was that space itself has volume. And now, it is the light that has volume.\\" The painting, \\"Chapel Trail Near Alter Road\\" shows the direction that his work took at this time. His drawings similarly enlarged the scope of their subjects as the untitled tree drawing of 2002 shows. Jake Berthot, \\"Chapel Trail Near Alter Road,\\" 2000, oil on panel, 26.675 x 26.125 inches Throughout his career, Berthot consciously kept aloof from the labeled art movements of his time. He once said, \\"I am not interested in the new but in trying to make paintings that refuse to grow old,\\" and on another occasion, speaking of an affinity he felt with C√©zanne's approach to his work, he said: \\"His clear method ... is not a closure but an opening.... You have to have a form and method and within that form and method, at a certain point you have to become the servant of the painting.\\" Summing up this attitude on another occasion he said that as he worked a time would come when he felt that a painting would take over his consciousness \\"to dictate what it wanted to be.\\" His paintings were his companions as well as the focus of his life. When the Phillips Collection asked to mount a major retrospective of combining the many works of his that it owned along with the work then in his studio, he declined saying he could not live without having the paintings around him. Jake Berthot, \\"Night Wood and Rock,\\" 2012-2014, oil on linen, 20.5 x 24.5 inches During the course of his career critics had pointed to an increasing emotional impact in his paintings and one or two of them had said that while the paintings could be comprehended entirely on their own merits, it was possible to see in them Berthot's responses to the personal difficulties he encountered over the years of his career. While he was undergoing treatment for leukemia during the last few years of his life, Berthot produced paintings that have been seen to possess a high level of emotional content. Writing in 2015, a friend of his, the artist Elisa Jensen, referred to them as \\"haunting, haunted, living, breathing, and absolutely undeniably alive.\\" Concerning one of them, called \\"Night, Wood, and Rock,\\" a friend said it was \\"pure essence, stripped of all inessentials,\\" and that his close observation of it infused him with a \\"serene acceptance of life's glory, suspended always above death, no matter death's imminence or seeming finality.\\" Exhibitions and awards Berthot's earliest exhibitions were at the Feiner, Park Place, and O.K. Harris galleries and the Jewish and Whitney museums in New York. He was given solo shows at the Feiner Gallery, 42 Fifth Avenue, in 1963, and the O.K. Harris Gallery, 465 West Broadway, in 1970, and was included in group exhibitions at the Jewish Museum, in 1970, the Whitney Museum, in 1971. Before showing at O.K. Harris Berthot had been supporting himself as an art instructor. He later said the gallery's owner, Ivan Karp had enabled him to work full-time in his studio by giving him a living allowance equal to his teaching salary. During the 1970s he exhibited frequently in commercial galleries and museums. He was given a solo show at O.K. Harris in 1975, appeared in a charity exhibition at the Cayman Gallery in 1977, was selected to appear in a show called \\"Artists Choose Artists\\" at the CDS Gallery (1982), and appeared in a solo exhibition at the McKee Gallery (1983). In addition, paintings of his appeared in shows at the Whitney Museum Downtown Branch (1974), Corcoran Gallery (1975), Baltimore Museum of Art (1975), Venice Biennale (1976), Aldrich Museum (1978), Brockton Art Museum (1980), and the Hudson River Museum (1983). During the 1980s Berthot continued to show at the McKee Gallery. He also showed at the Cava Gallery, Philadelphia, in 1987 and the Nielson Gallery, Boston, in 1998 and 2000. During this time his work continued to appear in museum exhibitions including the Museum of Modern Art. The Museum of Modern Art included works by Berthot in \\"New Works on Paper\\" (1981), \\"An International Survey of Recent Painting and Sculpture\\" (1984), and \\"Contrasts of Form: Geometric Abstract Art, 1910-1980\\" (1985). His work was also included in exhibitions at the Berkeley Art Museum (1984), the galleries of Muhlenberg and Lafayette colleges (1984), Mandeville Gallery, University of California, San Diego (1986), the Museum of Contemporary Art San Diego, and the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston (1987). In 1988 he was given a retrospective exhibition at the Rose Art Museum, Brandeis University. Until about 2004 he continued to be represented by the McKee Gallery and thereafter by the Betty Cunningham Gallery which, since his death, has also represented his estate. Museum exhibitions from the early 1990s include: \\"Slow Art: Painting in New York Now\\" at P.S.1, Long Island City, New York (1992), \\"Square Painting/Plane Painting at the Center on Contemporary Art, Seattle, Washington (1997), \\"Jake Berthot\\" at the Phillips Collection (1998), \\"Against The Grain\\" at Museum of Modern Art (2006), an exhibition at Hood Museum of Art, Dartmouth (2009), an exhibition at the gallery of SUNY Ulster (2010), and \\"Jake Berthot: From the Collection and Promised Gifts\\" at the Phillips Collection (2016). Berthot's works are owned by the Museum of Modern Art, Metropolitan Museum of Art, Whitney Museum of American Art, Guggenheim Museum, National Gallery of Art, Houston Museum of Fine Arts, and the Berkeley Art Museum and Pacific Film Archive. Not long before he died, he bequeathed the paintings that remained in his studio to the Phillips Collection. He received a Guggenheim Fellowship in 1981, and a National Endowment for the Arts Grant in 1983. Art teacher While Berthot was in evening school at Pratt, a teacher asked him to take over a class for another teacher who had not shown up. He did well enough so that he was offered a job in the fall of 1961. He later said he liked the work partly because it required him to tell people what to do, \\"rather than them telling me what to do.\\" Berthot subsequently taught classes at Cooper Union (1974‚Äì81), Yale University (1982-92), the University of Pennsylvania (1993) and the School of Visual Arts (1994 -2013). Personal life and family Berthot was born on March 30, 1939 in Niagara Falls, New York. His father was Earl H. Berthot (1911‚Äì1962) and his mother Sara Catherine Barr Berthot (1912‚Äì2002). His birth name was John Alex Berthot. When he was two years old his parents separated and his mother took him to her parents' eight-acre truck farm in Clearfield, Pennsylvania. At this time his grandmother, Cora Barr (1887‚Äì1969) became his primary caregiver. His grandfather, Thomas Barr (1886‚Äì1967), owned and worked the farm. Including Sara, his grandparents had three of their eleven children living with them when she returned home. The youngest of them was thirteen years older than Berthot and in that rural setting he had no companions his own age. The farm was self-sufficient but austere; there was electricity but no indoor plumbing. Before her marriage Cora had a relationship with a boyfriend who was an artist. She encouraged Berthot's early interest in drawing. He went through the public school system where he lived and afterwards attended a commercial art school in Pittsburgh. At the age of 20 in 1959, he moved to New York City, enrolled in a school to learn window display, and got a job in that occupation in a store in the Bronx. Shortly afterwards, he married his first wife, the poet, Ginny MacKenzie, whose job, teaching at Pratt Institute, enabled him to take evening art classes there. In the early 1980s he and MacKenzie divorced and he moved briefly to Maine. Sometime later he married Kristin Flynn and some years later they too divorced. In 2006, 11 years after his move to the rural home and studio in Accord, N.Y., Berthot seriously injured his right wrist when he fell from a ladder while pruning a tree and about six years after that he was diagnosed with a virulent form of leukemia from which he did not recover. He died on December 30, 2014. Other names used Named John Alex Berthot at birth, he used Jake Berthot as his professional name all his life. His surname is pronounced BEAR-TOE.

Objects are attached to the other side by pressing them against the tape. They stick to the tape due to small bubbles (cavities) on the surface of the tape. These contain air, which is squeezed out when the surface of an object is pressed against the surface of the tape. Due to sealing properties of the material, when the object is pulled off the surface, a vacuum is created in the cavities. Due to external air pressure, this creates a force that prevents the object from being removed from the surface, a mechanism similar to that of a suction cup. When a large enough surface area of the object is pressed onto the tape, considerable force is necessary in order to detach the object by pulling it off. The mechanism is similar to that of a suction cup, where a well attached cup with a radius of 2 cm (with no air left between the cup and the surface) would require a force of about 130 newtons to detach it from the surface. For micro-suction tape, the necessary force is proportional to the attachment surface area. Compared to a suction cup, the force is smaller for the tape (assuming the same attachment surface area) because only a portion of the surface area contains craters that form vacuum chambers, and the maximal force factor is determined by this portion. Force by which an object is attached to the tape can be controlled by the force with which the object is pushed against the tape. A softer push against the tape will squeeze less air from the craters on the tape's surface, reducing the difference between external air pressure and pressure in the created vacuum chambers, which essentially generates the force holding the object against the tape. As described above, a significant force is necessary to detach the object by pulling it away from the tape in a perpendicular direction. Using this method, the total force of all vacuum chambers must be counteracted at once. However, it is easy to peel the tape from the object starting at the edge of the contact area. Using this method, only a small number of vacuum chambers are detached at a time, and each chamber generates only a weak opposing force due to its small surface. In order to ensure a reliable long-term grip, surface bubbles must be well sealed after object attachment and must not leak air. The tape must be made of material that is not permeable by air. It must be soft in order to adapt to surface roughness of the attached objects and provide good sealing, therefore objects with rough surfaces can not be attached reliably, and this kind of tape does not work well for objects made of porous materials permeable by air. In some applications, attachment may be improved by combining other mechanisms, such as high friction between the tape and objects attached to it. Friction force is not significantly reduced over time and it does not depend significantly on contact area. Specific traction (force per surface unit) is roughly proportional to contact pressure. If contact surface area is reduced (at the same gravity force acting on the object laid on the tape), both contact pressure (stress component normal to the contact surface) and specific traction (shear stress - tangential component) increase proportionally, which yields similar (not reduced) friction force. Other approaches are also considered for devices with similar function, such as those inspired by animals that are capable of scaling vertical walls and ceilings, e.g. geckos, tree frogs and some insects.

The story was by Heck Allen, and Paul Frees voiced all the characters.  Background  This cartoon and Deputy Droopy were the last two directed by Tex Avery for MGM, before he left to return to Walter Lantz's studio, where his career in animation began. It was the last 1950s MGM cartoon that was not filmed in CinemaScope.  Plot  Spike plays a prisoner doing 500 years at Sing Song Prison. However, he has come up with an escape plan and starts digging a tunnel under his cell floor using a teaspoon. 20 years (and 6,500,004,395,632 teaspoons) later, Spike finally digs up through the outside of the prison wall. He returns to his cell to get his disguises but stops all escape activity when the warden comes walking by. When Spike mentions to the warden that it is his 20th anniversary in prison, the warden suddenly remembers it's his wedding anniversary and runs out to get his wife a gift. This prompts Spike to grab his disguises, run through and out of the tunnel, into a train boxcar and into a television set. Seconds later, the TV is hauled onto a truck and taken to Sing Sing Prison. As Spike talks about the many places he plans on visiting, he suddenly sees the warden on the phone and goes into a panic. Turns out that the TV is the anniversary gift for the warden's wife. After the warden finishes his phone call, he goes over to the TV and checks it out. Spike realizes that he must play out everything that the warden wants to watch; first is a Western movie, followed by a boxing match. The warden wants to watch horse racing next, but Spike pours water from a can across the screen and posts a sign: RACES CALLED OFF: RAIN. So the warden decides on a musical program instead (with Spike playing a \\"one-man band\\"). The warden turns the TV off and is satisfied that his wife will enjoy it. An exhausted Spike, not wanting to go through any more, breaks through the bottom of the set and starts digging through the ground just as the warden picks the TV up and heads home. Shortly thereafter, Spike reaches the end of his path, only to end up back in the same TV set, now in the warden's living room. The warden proceeds to show his wife how well it works, but when he \\"turns it on\\", Spike pops up and goes into a mental breakdown.

Written and co-produced by James DeMonaco, it marks the first film of the series not to be directed by him. It is the fourth installment in the Purge franchise, the film is a prequel depicting the origins of the annual \\"Purge\\", a 12-hour span once a year in which all crime in America, including murder, rape and arson, is legal; it originates as an experiment confined to Staten Island with the promise that those who stay on the island for its duration will be paid a large sum of money, but the New Founding Fathers are determined to get the results they want by any means necessary. The First Purge was released on July 4, 2018, by Universal Pictures. It has grossed over $137 million worldwide, becoming the highest-grossing entry in the franchise, but received mixed reviews from critics like its predecessors.  Plot  A crazed drug addict named Skeletor discusses his dark thoughts, including his desire to \\"purge\\" and unleash his hatred on other people. An NFFA employee tells Skeletor that he can very soon. In an alternate 2014, the New Founding Fathers of America (NFFA) are now the most powerful party in the United States, going as far as to have the current President, Bracken, be of that party. In 2017, NFFA chief of staff Arlo Sabian and sociologist Dr. May Updale announce an experiment to take place on Staten Island where for 12 hours, citizens will be allowed to purge and release their inhibitions in any way they choose, including murder. The NFFA offers residents $5,000 to stay during the experiment, with additional compensation if they join the purge and survive. They also outfit the participants with contact lens cameras so that they can monitor all activity and put tracking devices in them so they will know if they try to leave the island. Drug lord Dmitri tells his dealers that they will not be leaving the island, as moving his large amounts of money and product will draw too much attention, and tells them to stay in a safe house and lay low. Dealer Capital A decides to defy this order and go out and purge, while newbie dealer Isaiah is attacked and cut by Skeletor. Isaiah goes to his sister Nya, an anti-Purge activist and Dimitri's ex-girlfriend, for treatment. As people flee Staten Island, Nya joins her friends Dolores, Luisa, and Selina in a church to wait out the Purge. Dmitri has stayed behind, and Anna and Elsa, two prostitutes, are sent by his dealers to his office to keep him company. Skeletor commits the first-ever Purge murder, and the video recorded by the NFFA goes viral. The NFFA also observe that more parties than killings are taking place and that crimes are mostly just looting and vandalism, as opposed to the expected murder. Isaiah secretly joins the Purge to get his revenge on Skeletor. He eventually confronts him during the Purge but cannot shoot him. Isaiah runs off and into more purgers, before hiding and calling Nya for help. Anna and Elsa are revealed to be Purgers who attempt to kill Dmitri, but Dmitri fights them off and learns that Capital A had sent them in an attempt to take over Dmitri's business. Skeletor captures Nya in the streets and attempts to rape her, but Isaiah wounds him and they escape. Capital A and his crew go to Dmitri's office to thank Anna and Elsa for killing Dmitri, but Dmitri and his gang ambush him and kill them all, except for Anna and Elsa, who are told to never return to Staten Island. Nya and Isaiah return to the church to see blood-soaked white supremacist bikers leaving it. Although Nya's friend Luisa and her daughter Selina survived, Dolores' fate is unknown. They all return to Nya's apartment, where Dolores eventually manages to make it safely. Meanwhile, at the NFFA headquarters, Updale becomes suspicious of a sudden increase in murder, along with the presence of masked participants. She reviews the video footage of the Purge and notices vans full of masked killers arriving. Much to her horror, she finds out that said masked killers are trained mercenary groups killing multiple civilians. Sabian explains that he sent the mercenaries to make the experiment look successful, and eventually to help balance the wealth disequilibrium amongst the rich and the poor. Updale protests this tampering, realizing that the NFFA only wants to eradicate the poor to save the expense of social programs. Knowing that his corruption has been exposed, Sabian has Updale taken away and killed, and erases all footage of the event. Dmitri and his gang escape through the streets, until unknown assailants attack them. Dmitri kills them all and discovers they are mercenaries. Realizing they were sent by the NFFA, who had also dumped weapons into the neighborhood to provoke participation, Dmitri and his crew decide to take a stand against them and protect the neighborhood. After saving local shop owner and friend Freddy and his associates, they go to Nya's apartment building to try and save her and her friends, but NFFA drones shoot and kill most of Dmitri's gang. Dmitri calls Nya and warns her of the mercenaries' invasion, but he is coming to help her. Dmitri successfully kills a number of mercenaries and helped Nya's group to hide in a safe space. The mercenaries are about to shoot a rocket-propelled grenade into the apartments when a deranged Skeletor arrives and kills some mercenaries before he himself is killed. Dmitri grabs a piece of plastic explosive, throws it and shoots it repeatedly until it explodes, killing the remaining mercenaries. As sirens sound the end of the Purge, a wounded Dmitri is hailed as a hero, and he states that the survivors must somehow fight back. During the end credits, Sabian reads a statement calling this experimental Purge a success, and that a nationwide Purge may begin as soon as the following year, which leads into the events of the other films, and directly ties into The Purge television series.

He became a visitor scientist for a couple of years at the US National Cancer institute Biometry Branch, where he continued to work with William Haenszel, and then became a full time professor in Pathology at the Medical Center of Louisiana at New Orleans. He was able to achieve the rank of Boyd professor, the highest academic rank among LSU staff.‚Äù (Fontham, 2010). He continued to work there until Hurricane Katrina destroyed Charity Hospital in New Orleans, and his lifetime collection of pathology specimens was lost. ‚ÄúRecognized for his expertise in gastroenterology, he was given an award by the American Gastroenterological Association (AGA) for his individual contributions research in this field of science‚Äù (Stuart, 2013). He also served on the World Health Organization for many years for his research on Helicobacter pylori bacteria which was later classified as a class 1 carcinogen. After the destruction of Charity Hospital in New Orleans, Dr. Correa obtained a new position as professor of pathology at Vanderbilt University after becoming a full time member. ‚ÄúHe ended up founding the cancer registry in Cali, Colombia. He also was the leader in development in SEER Louisiana cancer registry‚Äù (Fontham, 2010). Over the course of his life he has published over 550 papers and book chapters and earned the title of Principal Investigator for the NCI program project on the etiology of gastric cancer. According to Dr. Peek, ‚ÄúDr. Correa's contributions to the field of gastric carcinogenesis are protean, as he was the first investigator to define histologic stages in the canonical progression to intestinal-type gastric adenocarcinoma, years prior to the discovery of H. pylori.‚Äù (Newman 2017) Sources:A Conversation With Pelayo Correa : Epidemiology.\\" LWW.

In her half- century of artistic works, she garnered over seventeen awards of national and international recognition. Beginning her career in a Pop Art style which moved towards abstract, her trajectory moved toward cubism and realism as she explored light, color, sensuality and the bounty of her surroundings. Her reinterpretations of master painters led her to an exploration of Colombian multiculturalism, and her later works focused on Afro-Colombian and mestizo heritage within the Colombian landscape. Her works can be found in the permanent collections of the Fuji Art Museum in Tokyo; the in Zaragoza, Spain; the Museum of Modern Art in Mexico City; the Nassau County Museum of Art of Roslyn Harbor, New York, as well as the Bogot√° Museum of Modern Art and museums in other Latin American cities. Her collection of archival materials on San Basilio de Palenque were donated to the United Nations University in Tokyo and the Smithsonian's National Museum of African American History and Culture. Early life Ana Mercedes Hoyos Mej√≠a was born on 29 September 1942 in Bogot√°, Colombia to Ester Mej√≠a Guti√©rrez and Manuel Jos√© Hoyos Toro. Her father was an architectural engineer and encouraged Hoyos in the study of art history. She completed her primary and secondary schooling at Colegio Marymount in Bogot√°, taking private lessons in painting under Luciano Jaramillo. This formal schooling was offset with trips to Europe, Mexico and the United States to learn about art in other cultures. She studied visual arts at the University of the Andes with Jaramillo, as well as , Marta Traba and Armando Villegas, though she did not complete her studies. In 1967, she married Jacques Mosseri Han√©, an architect, and they spent a month in New York City, exploring exhibits of Pop Art, before returning home to Bogot√°. Subsequently their daughter Ana was born in 1969. Career Hoyos began her career as a teacher, at the University of the Andes, where she taught from 1961 to 1965. She began exhibiting in 1966 and in 1967, won the second prize at Bogot√°'s Museum of Contemporary Art () Young Painter's Biennial. The following year she took first place in the Bogot√° Museum of Modern Art's \\"Environmental Spaces\\" exhibition. In the latter part of the 1960s, she produced Pop Art works and by the 1970s, was working in a minimalist style producing abstract works. These led to the creation of her first series, Ventanas (Windows), which many consider her most important works. The oil paintings were small with a square presentation, utilizing vertical and horizontal lines to frame an abstract landscape. The window was a device to focus the view on a frozen moment in time, typically depicting a landscape image, with the frame itself representing the separation of the internal and external reality. In her later works in this series, the framed image becomes more obscure and it is impossible to determine if one is looking in or out of the window. In 1971, Hoyos won the Caracas Prize at the 22nd Salon of National Artists, for paintings 1‚Äì10 of the Ventanas collection. By the mid-1970s Hoyos' series Atm√≥sferas (Atmospheres) breaks through the window and the images explore the unfettered expanse of light, abandoning the frame entirely. Painting with alternating layers of various colors with each followed by a white layer, she explored the depths of color focused in light. In 1978, Hoyos won the 27th National Salon of Visual Artists first place prize for her Atm√≥sferas works, which was controversial because of the highly competitive nature of the Colombian art scene and ultimately led her to make New York City her second home. The recognition led to international exposure, as well when she was invited to participate in the Biennale de Paris and in an exhibition, \\"Geometr√≠aSens√≠vel\\", with Roberto Pontual and other Latin American artists hosted by the Museum of Modern Art in Rio de Janeiro. Hoyos next evolution was in a series of floral and fruit works, in which she stripped out most of the petals and focused on the flower head of sunflowers. By using only the circular forms to explore the sensuality of earth's abundance, she attempted to remove spatial references to focus on the flower itself. From these images, she moved into a series of still lifes returning to a window-like photographic frame. Using fruits typical to those found on the beaches of Cartagena, her form became oblong, as if the fruit were itself a landscape. She achieved symmetry though use of shapes of plantain counter-balanced by watermelon surrounding either slices of fruit or the bounty found in a fruit vendor's shop. Between 1984 and 1987, these still lifes became an exploration of art history, paying homage to master painters of the past, such as Caravaggio, C√©zanne, Jawlensky, Lichtenstein, Van Gogh, Zurbar√°n. Reworking some of their paintings, Hoyos' study of history inserted her own view of magical or mythical and ethnic experience into the European tradition. In 1988, she was brought to the attention of North American audiences with an interview in Newsweek, which featured interviews with artists labeled \\"new teachers\\". Through her still lifes, Hoyos came to appreciate Afro-Colombian heritage, transitioning from an admiration of the beauty of the lush bounty to an appreciation of the cultural contributions and multicultural diversity of the people that populated Colombia. She began researching slavery and its counterpart, the idea of freedom, to come to an understanding of how those historical events shaped and changed Colombia. She began documenting through photographs and oral interviews the history of San Basilio de Palenque, collecting testimonials of common people, their herbal knowledge, legends, games and cultural traditions. This exploration of Colombia's past, led her to produce the series of works on the Afro-Colombian community for which she is most known and for which she gained wide recognition. The paintings used exaggerated light and details infused with tropical images and colors to depict the Caribbean coastal populations and vegetation. In 1992, Hoyos was invited by the Japan Foundation to participate in a cultural exchange program for artists. The following year, works from her collection on Palenque were exhibited at the Yoshii Gallery in New York City. President Bill Clinton invited her to participate in the conference on \\"Culture and Diplomacy\\" held at the White House in 2000. That same year, she was given an Honoris Causa master's degree in visual arts from the University of Antioquia of Medell√≠n. From November 2004 to March 2005, a traveling retrospective of Hoyos' work toured throughout Mexico before moving on to Colombia over that same summer. The exhibit consisted of works over a 36-year period, including from her series Ventanas; Atm√≥sferas; still lifes; tributes; and Colombian negritude. The variety of styles, including abstract, Pop Art, and realism presented, in a chronological display, the development of the artist and her explosive use of color and rhythm. Her contemporary style, reflected both art movements in her era, as well as her pictorial commentary on the history of Latin America through her images of the multicultural traditions of mestizos and Afro- Latinos. In February 2014, an exhibit, Tres D (3-D), was hosted at the Nueveochenta Gallery featuring rarely-seen sculptural works by Hoyos. Her three-dimensional works followed and were consistent with the themes expressed in her paintings over the course of her career. Shortly before her death, in July 2014, Hoyos made arrangements for her collection of artifacts relating to the palenqueros to be donated to the United Nations University in Tokyo with a smaller portion going to the National Museum of African American History and Culture, which houses the Smithsonian's collection of African-American history. Death and legacy Hoyos died on 5 September 2014 in Bogot√° after a brief hospitalization. In her lifetime, she was honored with over seventeen national and international awards in recognition of her work. She has works included in the permanent collections of the Fuji Art Museum in Tokyo; the in Zaragoza, Spain; the Museum of Modern Art in Mexico City; the Nassau County Museum of Art of Roslyn Harbor, New York, as well as the Bogot√° Museum of Modern Art and museums in other Latin American cities.

Appearing as a member of the public on BBC Nationwides On the Spot live election special, Gould confronted Thatcher over the sinking of the Belgrano, an Argentine warship, during the 1982 Falklands War between the United Kingdom and Argentina.Julia Langdon (25 May 1983). \\"Sinking of Belgrano surfaces again\\", The Guardian, p. 2: \\"Mrs Thatcher insisted that the orders to sink the Belgrano were justified because it was a danger to British ships.\\" \\"A moment of weakness, fathoms deep\\", The Guardian (editorial), 26 May 1983, p. 12: \\"Why, inquired Mrs. Gould, had the Tory War cabinet ordered the sinking of the Belgrano ...?\\"\\"Margaret Thatcher's Belgrano critic Diana Gould dies, aged 85\\", BBC News, 9 December 2011. ARA General Belgrano, a cruiser, sank with the loss of 323 lives on 2 May 1982, after Thatcher gave the order to attack it when it sailed near a 200-mile exclusion zone the British had declared around the Falkland Islands. It was hit by two Mark 8 torpedoes launched by , a nuclear- powered hunter-killer submarine. The sinking was controversial, in part because of a dispute as to whether the ship had been heading toward or away from the exclusion zone when it was hit. Gould believed it had been sailing away from the exclusion zone. It was made public in 2011 that General Belgrano had in fact been ordered to sail toward it. The exchange between Thatcher and Gould became iconic, remembered because of Gould's persistence in asking why Thatcher had given the order, which seemed to rattle the prime minister.Clive Bloom (2015).

After attending Howard Gardens Grammar School in Cardiff and winning a scholarship to Cambridge, she studied geography at Newnham College, Cambridge, and graduated with first- class honours. She was also awarded blues for hockey, swimming, and diving. After Cambridge, she became a meteorological officer in Cornwall with the Women's Royal Naval Service and married a fellow serviceman, Clifford Gould of the Fleet Air Arm. In 1955, after leaving the Navy, Gould became a part-time PE teacher in Cirencester.\\"Diana Gould\\", The Daily Telegraph, 8 December 2011.

Secrets of the Conqueror: The Untold Story of Britain's Most Famous Submarine. London: Faber & Faber. Nationwide During a live election-special episode of Nationwides On the Spot on 24 May 1983, the prime minister had agreed to take questions from pre-selected members of the public sitting in BBC studios around the country. Gould had been invited after writing to the show, although her husband said later that her application had been accepted \\"much to her horror\\". She came to the meeting prepared; two days before the programme, she telephoned Tam Dalyell, a Labour MP who had been pressing for information about the sinking, and asked him to brief her. Thatcher and Sue Lawley, the anchor, were in the BBC's Lime Grove Studios in Shepherd's Bush, west London, where the prime minister took questions from 18:25 until 19:00. Gould, in the BBC's Bristol studio, was the fourth member of the public to be invited to speak. \\"Mrs. Thatcher,\\" she asked, \\"why, when the Belgrano, the Argentinian battleship, was outside the exclusion zone and actually sailing away from the Falklands, why did you give the orders to sink it?\\" Thatcher replied: \\"But it was not sailing away from the Falklands. It was in an area which was a danger to our ships and to our people on them.\\"\\"TV Interview for BBC1 Nationwide (On the Spot)\\", transcript, Margaret Thatcher Foundation. Naval forces in the South Atlantic, 1‚Äì2 May 1982 Gould said that the ship had been \\"on a bearing of 280 and it was already west of the Falklands\\". Thatcher continued to insist that the ship had represented a danger to British troops, and that the Argentine government had been warned that any ships representing a danger within a certain area were vulnerable. Gould pressed the prime minister several times to clarify whether the ship had been sailing away from the Falklands, but Thatcher avoided repeating that it had not. She said the full facts would be published in about 30 years, adding: \\"I think it could only be in Britain that a Prime Minister was accused of sinking an enemy ship that was a danger to our navy, when my main motive was to protect the boys in our navy.\\" Gould suggested the sinking had put an end to a Peruvian peace proposal, but according to Thatcher, the proposal had not arrived in London until after the sinking. At several points the women clearly became irritated with each another. Gould said at one stage: \\"That is not good enough, Mrs. Thatcher,\\" to which Thatcher replied: \\"Would you please let me answer?\\" Directly after the interview, Thatcher apparently talked about abolishing the BBC.John Campbell (2008).

Aftermath Belgrano Action Group Ascension Island After the exchange, Gould became involved with the Belgrano Action Group, an activist group set up by Tam Dalyell, Clive Ponting and others.

Entitled The Sinking of the Belgrano, the report has not been published, but Thorp wrote in his book The Silent Listener (2011) that General Belgrano had been ordered to sail into the exclusion zone to rendezvous with other ships, possibly for a pincer attack against the British, and not to her home port as the Argentine government claimed at the time.D.

It is an example of German Expressionism so prevalent there following the success of The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari in 1919. The film's sets were designed by art director Franz Schroedter. Plot Tomski, a Russian soldier, mentions to the other soldiers playing cards with him that, years before, his grandmother, the Countess Tomski, told him that an old sorcerer had bestowed upon her a supernatural secret to winning at cards. Another soldier named Hermann later manages to sneak into the Countess' house and tries to wrest the secret from her. The old woman dies of fright, and later her ghost returns to haunt Hermann, driving him insane.

She is the 2018 European and 2018 World Group 5 Hoops champion, the 2017 World Group All-around silver medalist and the 2014 Youth Olympic Group All-around silver medalist.  Career  She started rhythmic gymnastics at the age of three in club \\"Levski Iliana\\". At the age of six she moved to club \\"Levski\\", where her coach was Branimira Markova. Bineva became Vice Olympic Champion of the Youth Olympic Games in Nanjing 2014. Later she became part of the new ensemble with Madlen Radukanova, Simona Dyankova, Laura Traets and Teodora Aleksandrova in 2016. Her hobbies are reading, going to the cinema and walking in the park. She was later integrated in the Bulgarian group in 2017 and 2018. In February 2017 she suffered a right ankle injury at an event in Moscow, the trauma was extensible ligaments, swelling in the bone and a broken piece that is 6 years old on her right leg and could not compete at the Rumi and Albena international tournament in Varna, Bulgaria. In April 2017 she broke bone in her hand at training when she and one of the other gymnasts hit really bad and bone on her right wrist broke, that is why she performed with linguists at the 2017 World Championships. She kept competing in 2018 despite those injuries and became European and World Champion. In 2019, she decided to retire to keep the cohesion of the Bulgarian group safe a year before the Olympic Games and to avoid the danger of having to train a new gymnast in a terrible rush a few months before Tokyo if her injury was too painful again.  Personal life  Eli has 3 sisters (Miroslava, Viki and Martina Bineva) and one brother (Kaloyan Binev). Her father Slavcho Binev won gold at the 1992 European Championships in taekwondo and became a well-known Bulgarian businessman and politician after the end of his sports career and her mother is Maria Bineva.

It is a rare European fungus that has only been officially recorded a few times. Taxonomy The fungus was originally described as a species of Hydnum by Portuguese botanist F√©lix Avelar Brotero in 1804. Rudolph Arnold Maas Geesteranus transferred it to the newly created genus Mycorrhaphium in 1962. It has also been placed in Hydnellum by Petter Karsten in 1879, and Steccherinum by Howard James Banker in 1906. Description Mycorrhaphium pusillum has a small fruit body with a rounded to fan-shaped cap measuring in diameter. Sometimes neighbouring caps fuse together during growth to make a larger conglomerate. The cap colour is pale cream to pale yellowish, sometimes with regions that are pale brown. The pale cream stipe is long and thick. Spines on the underside of the cap are slender, numbering about 7 or 8 per millimetre, and are about a mm long. The mushroom has no distinct odour. The spores of M. pusillum are thin walled and more or less cylindrical, typically measuring 2.9‚Äì3.6 by 1.9‚Äì2.2 Œºm. They usually contain an oil droplet. The hyphal system of the context is monomitic (containing only loosely arranged generative hyphae), although in the spines it is dimitic. The skeletal hyphae in the spines are thick walled, sometimes so much that they are almost solid, or with a small lumen. They are densely arranged in a parallel fashion, and usually measure 3.7‚Äì4.9 Œºm in diameter. Habitat and distribution A rare fungus, Mycorrhaphium pusillum is found only in Europe. It has been collected only a few times in southern and central Europe, and the first northern European collections were reported in 2015. In these latter collections, it was found fruiting on mossy ground in forest dominated by birch trees.

Born December 1, 1890 in Mattoon Illinois to mill owner E.K. White, Holmes was involved in the mill and flour industry from a young age. She graduated Chelsea High School in 1907 and then went on to pursue higher education at Eastern Michigan University, then known as Ypsilanti Normal College. Prior to her marriage to Howard S. Holmes and subsequent development of Jiffy Mix, Holmes was a school teacher in Illinois. Holmes' father, E.K. White, had founded a flour mill in 1887, which was incorporated as the Chelsea Milling Company in 1901. In 1908, White sold the company to Mabel's father-in-law, Harmon Holmes. Mabel's husband, Howard Holmes, ran the company until his death in 1936, after which she became company president. Holmes was active in the business until the early 1940s. Holmes first had the idea for a prepared, all-purpose baking mix in the late 1920s when she saw the poor quality of a biscuit made by the widowed father of her twin sons' friend. She wanted to develop a product that would save time in the kitchen and be so easy even a contemporary man could make it. Jiffy Biscuit Mix was introduced in 1930 as America's first prepared, all-purpose baking mix, named Jiffy Mix because it took so little time to prepare. Although Bisquick is widely accredited as being the first baking mix on the market due to its notoriety, Jiffy Mix was actually released first, thus holding the title of first all-purpose baking mix in America. Today, Jiffy brand has branched out to include mixes for all manor of baked goods, from biscuits to pizza dough, although their staple item is still the corn muffin mix.. Holmes was inducted into the Michigan Women's Hall of Fame in 2015.

He blockaded himself his office at the city hall, which resulted in the OMON having to storm the building. Although the local prosecutor dropped the charges against Cherepkov in November 1994, Russian President Boris Yeltsin signed an executive order removing him from his post. He regained the mayorship in 1996 after the State Duma passed a resolution declaring his removal from office illegal. President Yeltsin later issued an order to restore Cherepkov in September 1996. Cherepkov's return to office lasted only two years with Yeltsin reversing course and suspending the mayor again in November 1998. Cherepkov was elected to the city council of Vladivostok in January 1999, but had his election overturned by a local court only three months later. In 2000, Cherepkov won a seat in the State Duma. He was re-elected in 2004. In December 2011, Cherepkov announced the intention to run for President of Russia in the 2012 elections. Although he was nominated as a candidate for the election, he refused to turn in the required two million signatures in order to become registered by election officials.–ë—ã–≤—à–∏–π –º—ç—Ä –í–ª–∞–¥–∏–≤–æ—Å—Ç–æ–∫–∞ –æ—Ç–∫–∞–∑–∞–ª—Å—è –æ—Ç –ø—Ä–µ–∑–∏–¥–µ–Ω—Ç—Å–∫–æ–π –≥–æ–Ω–∫–∏ // Lenta.ru In 2013, Cherepkov attempted to regain his former post as mayor with the Green Alliance Party.

Biography  Born in France to Jean Le Monnier and Jeanne Michaud, he started his military career, whose rigid discipline, however, was ill-suited to his free and inharmonious character. He fled from the Enrico IV school in Paris, and then was expelled. The father, for punishment and to start it for a profession, entrusted him to a family friend who headed a print shop in Paris. Forced to become a typist, Felice Le Monnier discovered, by accident, his vocation. In a short time he mastered all the secrets of the craft and in a few years became professional.  Relocation to Florence  In the capital of the Grand Duchy of Tuscany, Le Monnier did not have difficulty finding work and entered the typography of Passigli and Borghi. In 1837 he founded with Borghi la Felice Le Monnier and C. It is the origin of the historic Le Monnier publishing house, still active today within the publishing group Mondadori. The new company for the first years worked as a simple typography, but Le Monnier, who in 1840 had reached the full ownership of the entire company, cultivated an ambitious project: to become a publisher. Thus was published in 1841 the first book chosen, chosen and promoted by Felice: The Speeches on the Italian stories of Canon Giuseppe Borghi. In the following decades, Le Monnier, while never interrupting the printing business on behalf of third parties (practices, among other things, common to all 19th century Italian publishers), built one of the most prestigious editorials in Italy, always coherently guided by a precise and modern philosophy, at the same time commercial and cultural. The Monnier was addressing the new broad public of the middle classes, the new emerging, unity and patriotic bourgeoisie. His choices followed the design, clear from the beginning, to publish works that would satisfy, as he himself stated, \\"the political concept and the literary criterion\\", that they associate patriotic spirit and artistic value. Frenchman Le Monnier then became a protagonist of the Risorgimento feelings of moderate Italy.  The National Library  The first great commercial success, the Arnaldo da Brescia by Giovan Battista Niccolini (1843), was perfectly in line with these premises, and there is no shortage of attention to Grand Ducal censorship. Niccolini's drama inaugurates the \\"National Library\\", a prestigious event from the rigorous pink covers that soon became the instrument of Le Monnier's cultural policy and the source of its greatest commercial success. The National Library did not exhaust the editorial activity of Le Monnier, which printed periodicals and newspapers, both on behalf of third parties (La Patria) and on its own (The Gazette of the People, with an independent, unified, monarchical program). Intriguing intuitions and intended to develop in the future of the Le Monnier editorial brand, to this day, were the publication of dictionaries (from the vocabulary of the Italian language by Pietro Fanfani of 1855) and of school books (since 1856).  The Case of the Promessi Sposi  Felice Le Monnier was also starring in \\"excellent\\" the widespread violation of copyright; in 1845 he republished the promised spouses in the edition of Passigli of 1832, without the permission of Alessandro Manzoni (who had published the final edition in the meantime). From this episode was born a long cause that ended only in 1864, with the full victory of Manzoni. The Monnier, who defended himself by invoking the non-retroactivity of the Austro-Sardinian Convention on Copyright in 1840, was sentenced to compensation of 34,000 lire. In addition to this famous episode, which attracted the attention of leading jurists, Le Monnier, following a widespread custom at the time especially among small publishers, printed pirate editions of other works, including Margherita Pusterla by Cesare Cant√π and Marco Visconti by Thomas Grossi.  The sale of the company and the death  In 1865, disappointed by the new climate of united Italy, which he believed was dominated by politicians and far from the ideals that had led the Risorgimento struggles, and beginning to feel the weight of the age, Felice Le Monnier gave the company ownership to a company (Societ√† Successori Le Monnier), formed by notable Florentines and Tuscans and presided over by Bettino Ricasoli, which impressed the publishing house with a culturally less defined editorial policy. Felice Le Monnier, who remained in the company as director until 1879, fled to Florence and died on June 27, 1884. He is buried in the Sacred Doors Cemetery in Florence.

There are two main structures both of which are Grade II listed buildings: the Castle Hill Offices on the east of Castle Avenue and the Castle Avenue Offices on the west of Castle Avenue. They take their name from Winchester Castle, which is located beside. History The complex was originally designed by Owen Browne Carter in the Elizabethan style and completed in 1833. It was initially used as offices to support the local judicial authorities, who dispensed justice from Winchester Castle, but, following the implementation of the Local Government Act 1888, which established county councils in every county, it also became the offices and meeting place for Hampshire County Council. The Castle Hill Offices were rebuilt to a design by James Robinson and Sir Arthur Blomfield in 1895. The Castle Avenue Offices were rebuilt in two phases: the eastern section, which was designed by William John Taylor and Sir Thomas Jackson, was completed in 1912 and the western section, which was designed by Sir Herbert Baker, was completed in 1932. From the late 19th century the offices also accommodated the headquarters of the 1st Volunteer Battalion of Hampshire Regiment. This unit evolved to become the 4th Battalion the Hampshire Regiment in 1908. The battalion was mobilised at Castle Hill in August 1914 before being deployed to India. Queen Elizabeth II Court, a large red-brick rectangular building with a clock tower and a central courtyard, was built to the north of Castle Hill in the 1960s. The Castle Hill Offices continue to be occupied by the County Council who use them for their Council Chamber and also as the location of their Basing and Portal meeting rooms.

Ice drilling allows scientists studying glaciers and ice sheets to gain access to what is beneath the ice, to take measurements along the interior of the ice, and to retrieve samples. Instruments can be placed in the drilled holes to record temperature, pressure, speed, direction of movement, and for other scientific research, such as neutrino detection. Many different methods have been used since 1840, when the first scientific ice drilling expedition attempted to drill through the Unteraargletscher in the Alps. Two early methods were percussion, in which the ice is fractured and pulverized, and rotary drilling, a method often used in mineral exploration for rock drilling. In the 1940s, thermal drills began to be used; these drills melt the ice by heating the drill. Drills that use jets of hot water or steam to bore through ice soon followed. A growing interest in ice cores, used for palaeoclimatological research, led to ice coring drills being developed in the 1950s and 1960s, and there are now many different coring drills in use. For obtaining ice cores from deep holes, most investigators use cable-suspended electromechanical drills, which use an armoured cable to carry electrical power to a mechanical drill at the bottom of the borehole. In 1966, a US team successfully drilled through the Greenland ice sheet at Camp Century, at a depth of . Since then many other groups have succeeded in reaching bedrock through the two largest ice sheets, in Greenland and Antarctica. Recent projects have focused on finding drilling locations that will give scientists access to very old undisturbed ice at the bottom of the borehole, since an undisturbed stratigraphic sequence is required to accurately date the information obtained from the ice.  The Goals of ice drilling  The first scientific ice drilling expeditions, led by Louis Agassiz from 1840 to 1842, had three goals: to prove that glaciers flowed,Clarke (1987), pp. 4‚Äì5. to measure the internal temperature of a glacier at different depths,Clarke (1987), pp. 11‚Äì12. and to measure the thickness of a glacier.Desor (1844), pp. 292‚Äì293. Proof of glacier motion was achieved by placing stakes in holes drilled in a glacier and tracking their motion from the surrounding mountain. Drilling through glaciers to determine their thickness, and to test theories of glacier motion and structure, continued to be of interest for some time,Bl√ºmcke & Hess (1910), pp. 66‚Äì70. but glacier thickness has been measured by seismographic techniques since the 1920s.S√ºsstrunk (1951), p. 313.Barry & Gan (2011), pp. 85‚Äì86. Although it is no longer necessary to drill through a glacier to determine its thickness, scientists still drill shot holes in ice for these seismic studies.Bentley et al. (2009), p. 222. Temperature measurements continue to this day: modelling the behaviour of glaciers requires an understanding of their internal temperature, and in ice sheets, the borehole temperature at different depths can provide information about past climates.Alley (2000), pp. 65‚Äì67. Other instruments may be lowered into the borehole, such as piezometers, to measure pressure within the ice,Iken et al. (1976), p. 143. or cameras, to allow a visual review of the stratigraphy.Hubbard & Glasser (2005), p. 126. IceCube, a large astrophysical project, required numerous optical sensors to be placed in holes 2.5 km deep, drilled at the South Pole.Benson et al. (2014), p. 105. Borehole inclination, and the change in inclination over time, can be measured in a cased hole, a hole in which a hollow pipe has been placed as a \\"liner\\" to keep the hole open. This allows the three-dimensional position of the borehole to be mapped periodically, revealing the movement of the glacier, not only at the surface, but throughout its thickness.Sharp (1953), p. 182. To understand whether a glacier is shrinking or growing, its mass balance must be measured: this is the net effect of gains from fresh snow, minus losses from melting and sublimation. A straightforward way to determine these effects across the surface of a glacier is to plant stakes (known as ablation stakes) in holes drilled in the glacier's surface, and monitor them over time to see if more snow is accumulating, burying the stake, or if more and more of the stake is visible as the snow around it disappears.Knight (1999), pp. 34‚Äì35. The discovery of layers of aqueous water and of several hundred mapped subglacial lakes, beneath the Antarctic ice sheet, led to speculation about the existence of unique microbial environments that had been isolated from the rest of the biosphere, potentially for millions of years. These environments can be investigated by drilling.National Research Council of the National Academies (2007), p. 1.Talalay (2016), p. 2. Part of the GISP2 ice core from 1837‚Äì1838 meters deep, in which annual layers are visible. The core was drilled in the early 1990s, and this picture covers some 38 years of accumulated ice, which dates from about 16,250 years ago. Ice cores are one of the most important motivations for drilling in ice. Since ice cores retain environmental information about the time the ice in them fell as snow, they are useful in reconstructing past climates, and ice core analysis includes studies of isotopic composition, mechanical properties, dissolved impurities and dust, trapped atmospheric samples, and trace radionuclides. Data from ice cores can be used to determine past variations in solar activity,Bradley (2015), p. 138. and is important in the construction of marine isotope stages, one of the key palaeoclimatic dating tools.Hay (2015), p. 676. Ice cores can also provide information about glacier flow and accumulation rates.Knight (1999), pp. 206‚Äì208. IPICS (International Partnership in Ice Core Sciences) maintains a list of key goals for ice core research. Currently these are to obtain a 1.5 million year old core; obtain a complete record of the last interglacial period; use ice cores to assist with the understanding of climate changes over long time scales; obtain a detailed spatial array of ice core climate data for the last 2,000 years; and continue the development of advanced ice core drilling technology.  Drilling design considerations  The constraints on ice drill designs can be divided into the following broad categories.  Ice removal method and project logistics  The ice must be cut through, broken up, or melted. Tools can be directly pushed into snow and firn (snow that is compressed, but not yet turned to ice, which typically happens at a depth of to );Alley (2000), pp 48‚Äì50. this method is not effective in ice, but it is perfectly adequate for obtaining samples from the uppermost layers. For ice, two options are percussion drilling and rotary drilling. Percussion drilling uses a sharp tool such as a chisel, which strikes the ice to fracture and fragment it.Talalay (2016), pp. 53‚Äì56. More common are rotary cutting tools, which have a rotating blade or set of blades at the bottom of the borehole to cut away the ice. For small tools the rotation can be provided by hand, using a T-handle or a carpenter's brace. Some tools can also be set up to make use of ordinary household power drills, or they may include a motor to drive the rotation. If the torque is supplied from the surface, then the entire drill string must be rigid so that it can be rotated; but it is also possible to place a motor just above the bottom of the drill string, and have it supply power directly to the drill bit.Talalay (2016), pp. 6‚Äì7. If the ice is to be melted instead of cut, then heat must be generated. An electrical heater built into the drill string can heat the ice directly, or it can heat the material it is embedded in, which in turn heats the ice. Heat can also be sent down the drill string; hot water or steam pumped down from the surface can be used to heat a metal drillhead, or the water or steam can be allowed to emerge from the drillhead and melt the ice directly. In at least one case a drilling project experimented with heating the drillhead on the surface, and then lowering it into the hole. Many ice drilling locations are very difficult to access, and drills must be designed so that they can be transported to the drill site.Talalay (2016), p. 97. The equipment should be as light and portable as possible. It is helpful if the equipment can be broken down so that the individual components can be carried separately, thus reducing the burden for hand-carrying, if required.Talalay (2016), pp. 169‚Äì170. Fuel, for steam or hot water drills, or for a generator to provide power, must also be transported, and this weight has to be taken into account as well.  Cuttings and meltwater  Mechanical ice auger, showing cutting teeth, helical flights used to transport ice cuttings up away from the cutting region, and a central void for the core itself. Mechanical drilling produces pieces of ice, either as cuttings, or as granular fragments, which must be removed from the bottom of the hole to prevent them from interfering with the cutting or percussing action of the drill. An auger used as the cutting tool will naturally move ice cuttings up its helical flights. If the drill's action leaves the ice chips on top of the drill, they can be removed by simply raising the drill to the surface periodically. If not, they can be brought to the surface by lowering a tool to scoop them up, or the hole can be kept full of water, in which case the cuttings will naturally float to the top of the hole. If the chips are not removed, they must be compacted into the walls of the borehole, and into the core if a core is being retrieved.Mellor & Sellmann (1976), pp. 81‚Äì82. Cuttings can also be moved to the surface by circulating compressed air through the hole, either by pumping the air through the drillpipe and out at the drillhead, forcing the chips up in the space between the drill string and the borehole wall, or by reverse air circulation, in which the air flows up through the drill string. Compressed air will be heated by the compression, and it must be cooled before being pumped downhole, or it will cause melting of the borehole walls and the core.Talalay (2016), p. 72. If the air is circulated by creating a vacuum, rather than pumping air in, ambient air carries the cuttings, so no cooling is needed.Talalay (2016), p. 107. A fluid can be used to circulate the cuttings away from the bit, or the fluid may be able to dissolve the cuttings. Rotary mineral drilling (through rock) typically circulates fluid through the entire hole, and separates solids from the fluid at the surface before pumping the fluid back down. In deep ice drilling it is usual to circulate the fluid only at the bottom of the hole, collecting cuttings in a chamber that is part of the downhole assembly. For a coring drill, the cuttings chamber can be emptied each time the drill is brought to the surface to retrieve a core. Thermal drills will produce water, so there are no cuttings to dispose of, but the drill must be capable of working while submerged in water, or else the drill must have a method of removing and storing the meltwater while drilling.Zagorodnov & Thompson (2014), pp. 322‚Äì325.  Drill string logistics  The drilling mechanism must be connected to the surface, and there must be a method of raising and lowering the drill.Mellor & Sellmann (1976), pp. 90‚Äì92. If the drill string consists of pipes or rods that have to be screwed together, or otherwise assembled, as the hole gets deeper and the drill string lengthens, then there must be a way to hold the drill string in place as each length of rod or pipe is added or removed. If the hole is only a few metres deep, no mechanical assistance may be necessary, but drill strings can get very heavy for deep holes, and a winch or other hoisting system must be in place that is capable of lifting and lowering it. A \\"trip\\" in drilling refers to the task of pulling a drill string completely out of the hole (tripping out) and then reinserting it back into the hole (tripping in). Tripping time is the time taken to trip in and out of the hole; it is important for a drill design to minimize tripping time, particularly for coring drills, since they must complete a trip for each core.Sheldon et al. (2014), pp. 260‚Äì261.  Borehole stability and permeability  The overburden pressure in a deep hole from the weight of the ice above will cause a borehole to slowly close up, unless something is done to counteract it, so deep holes are filled with a drilling fluid that is about the same density as the surrounding ice, such as jet fuel or kerosene. The fluid must have low viscosity to reduce tripping time. Since retrieval of each segment of core requires a trip, a slower speed of travel through the drilling fluid could add significant time to a project‚Äîa year or more for a deep hole. The fluid must contaminate the ice as little as possible; it must have low toxicity, for safety and to minimize the effect on the environment; it must be available at a reasonable cost; and it must be relatively easy to transport. The depth at which borehole closure prevents dry drilling is strongly dependent on the temperature of the ice; in a temperate glacier, the maximum depth might be , but in a very cold environment such as parts of East Antarctica, dry drilling to might be possible.Bentley et al. (2009), p. 223. Snow and firn are permeable to air, water, and drilling fluids, so any drilling method that requires liquid or compressed air in the hole needs to prevent them from escaping into the surface layers of snow and firn. If the fluid is only used in the lower part of the hole, permeability is not an issue. Alternatively the hole can be cased down past the point where the firn turns to ice. If water is used as a drilling fluid, in cold enough temperatures, it will turn to ice in the surrounding snow and firn and seal the hole.Talalay (2014), pp. 341‚Äì342.  Power, torque, antitorque, and heat  Tools can be designed to be rotated by hand, via a brace or T-handle, or a hand crank gearing,Bl√ºmcke & Hess (1899), pp. 33‚Äì34. or attached to a hand drill.Talalay (2016), p. 30. Drills with powered rotation require an electrical motor at the rig site, which generally must have fuel, though in at least one case a drilling project was set up near enough to a permanent research station to run a cable to the research building for power. The rotation can be applied at the surface, by a rotary table, using a kelly, or by a motor in the drillhead, for cable-suspended drills; in the latter case the cable must carry power to the drillhead as well as support its weight. For rotary drills, gearing is required to reduce the engine's rotation to a suitable speed for drilling.Talalay (2016), pp. 109‚Äì110. If torque is supplied at the bottom of the hole, the motor supplying it to the drillbit beneath it will have a tendency to rotate around its own axis, rather than imparting the rotation to the drillbit. This is because the drillbit will have a strong resistance to rotation since it is cutting ice. To prevent this, an anti- torque mechanism of some kind must be provided, typically by giving the motor some grip against the walls of the borehole. A thermal drill that uses electricity to heat the drill head so that it melts the ice must bring power down the hole, just as with rotary drills.Bird (1976), p. 2. If the drillhead is heated by pumping water or steam down to the bottom of the hole, then no downhole power is needed, but a pump at the surface is required for hot water. The water or steam can be heated at the surface by a fuel-powered boiler. Solar power can also be used.Blake et al. (1998), p. 175.  Directional control  Some drills which are designed to rest on their tip as they drill will lean to one side in the borehole, and the hole they drill will gradually drift towards the horizontal unless some method of counteracting this tendency is provided.Philberth (1972), p. 7. For other drills, directional control can be useful in starting additional holes at depth, for example to retrieve additional ice cores.Zagorodnov et al. (1992), p. 1.  Temperature  Many glaciers are temperate, meaning that they contain \\"warm ice\\": ice that is at melting temperature (0 ¬∞C) throughout.Knight (1999), p. 2. Meltwater in boreholes in warm ice will not refreeze, but for colder ice, meltwater is likely to cause a problem, and may freeze the drill in place, so thermal drills that operate submerged in the meltwater they produce, and any drilling method that results in water in the borehole, are difficult to use in such conditions.Paterson (1981), p. 80. Drilling fluids, or antifreeze additives to meltwater, must be chosen to keep the fluid liquid at the temperatures found in the borehole. In warm ice, ice tends to form on cutters and the drillhead, and to pack into spaces at the bottom of the hole, slowing down drilling.Talalay (2016), pp. 266‚Äì269.  Core retrieval  To retrieve a core, an annulus of ice must be removed from around the cylindrical core.Hubbard & Glasser (2005), pp. 44‚Äì46. The core should be unbroken, which means that vibrations and mechanical shocks must be kept to a minimum, and changes in temperature which could cause thermal shock to the core must also be avoided.Talalay (2014), p. 345. The core must be kept from melting caused by heat generated either mechanically from the drilling process,Cao et al. (2015), pp. 78‚Äì85. from the heat of compressed air if air is used as the drilling fluid, or from a thermal drill, and must not be contaminated by the drilling fluid. When the core is about to be retrieved, it is still connected to the ice beneath it, so some method of breaking it at the lower end must be provided, and of gripping it so it does not fall from the core barrel as it is brought to the surface, which must be done as quickly and safely as possible. Most coring drills are designed to retrieve cores that are no longer than , so drilling must stop each time the hole depth is extended by that amount, so that the core can be retrieved. A drill string that must be assembled and disassembled in segments, such as pipe sections that must be screwed together, takes a long time to trip in and out; a cable which can be continuously winched up, or a drill string that is flexible enough to be coiled, significantly reduces tripping time. Wireline drills have a mechanism that allows the core barrel to be detached from the drill head and winched directly to the surface without having to trip out the drill string. Once the core is removed, the core barrel is lowered to the bottom of the hole and reattached to the drill.  Brittle ice  Over a depth range known as the brittle ice zone, bubbles of air are trapped in the ice under great pressure. When a core is brought to the surface, the bubbles can exert a stress that exceeds the tensile strength of the ice, resulting in cracks and spall.Souney et al. (2014), pp. 20‚Äì21. At greater depths, the ice crystal structure changes from hexagonal to cubic, and the air molecules move inside the crystals, in a structure called a clathrate. The bubbles disappear, and the ice becomes stable again.Uchida et al. (1994), p. 302.Alley (2000), p. 50. The brittle ice zone typically returns poorer quality samples than for the rest of the core. Some steps can be taken to alleviate the problem. Liners can be placed inside the drill barrel to enclose the core before it is brought to the surface, but this makes it difficult to clean off the drilling fluid. In mineral drilling, special machinery can bring core samples to the surface at bottom-hole pressure, but this is too expensive for the inaccessible locations of most drilling sites. Keeping the processing facilities at very low temperatures limits thermal shocks. Cores are most brittle at the surface, so another approach is to break them into 1 m lengths in the hole. Extruding the core from the drill barrel into a net helps keep it together if it shatters. Brittle cores are also often allowed to rest in storage at the drill site for some time, up to a full year between drilling seasons, to let the ice gradually relax.Talalay (2016), pp. 265‚Äì266. Core quality in the brittle ice zone is much improved when a drilling fluid is used, as opposed to dry hole drilling.Zagorodnov et al. (1998), p. 190.  Percussion drills  A percussion drill penetrates ice by repeatedly striking it to fracture and fragment it. The cutting tool is mounted at the bottom of the drill string (typically connected metal rods), and some means of giving it kinetic energy must be provided. A tripod erected over the hole allows a pulley to be set up, and a cable can then be used to repeatedly raise and drop the tool. This method is known as cable tool drilling. A weight repeatedly dropped on to a rigid drill string can also be used to provide the necessary impetus. The pulverized ice collects at the bottom of the borehole, and must be removed. It can be collected with a tool capable of scooping it from the bottom of the hole, or the hole can be kept full of water, so that the ice floats to the top of the hole, though this retards the momentum of the drill striking the ice, reducing its effectiveness.Vallot (1898), pp. 190‚Äì193. A percussion drilling tool that is not mechanically driven requires some method of raising the drill so it can be released, to fall on the ice. To do this efficiently with manual labour, it is usual to set up a tripod or other supporting scaffold, and a pulley to allow the drill string to be raised by a rope. This arrangement, known as a cable-tool rig, can also be used for mechanical drilling, with a motor raising the drill string and allowing it to fall. An alternative approach is to leave the drill string at the bottom of the borehole, and to raise and let fall a hammer weight onto the drill string. The earliest scientific ice drilling expedition used percussion drilling; Louis Agassiz used iron rods to drill holes in the Unteraargletscher, in the Alps, in the summer of 1840. Cable-tool rigs have been used for ice drilling in more recent times; Soviet expeditions in the 1960s drilled with cable-tool rigs in the Caucasus and the Tien Shan range, and US projects have drilled on the Blue Glacier in Washington between 1969 and 1976, and on the Black Rapids Glacier in Alaska in 2002. Two other percussion methods have been tried. Pneumatic drills have been used to drill shallow holes in ice in order to set blast charges, and rotary percussion drills, a type of drilling tool once in common use in the mining industry, have also been used for drilling blasting holes, but neither approach has been used for scientific investigations of ice. Percussion drilling is now rarely used for scientific ice drilling, having been overtaken by more effective techniques for both ice and mineral drilling.  Hand-operated mechanical drills   Spoon-borers  A soil sampling auger contains a pair of blades at the bottom of an enclosed cylinder; it can be driven and rotated by hand to pick up soft soil. A similar design, called a spoon-borer, has been used for ice drilling, though it is not effective in hard ice.von Drygalski (1904), pp. 283‚Äì284. A version used by Erich von Drygalski in 1902 had two half-moon cutting blades set into the base of the cylinder in such a way as to allow the ice cuttings to accumulate in the cylinder, above the blades.Talalay (2016), p. 9.  Noncoring augers  Ice auger with offset brace handle Augers have long been used for drilling through ice for ice fishing. Augers can be rotated by hand, using a mechanism such as a T handle or a brace bit, or by attaching them to powered hand drills.Talalay (2016), pp. 31‚Äì33. Scientific uses for non-coring augers include sensor installation and determining ice thickness. Augers have a helical screw blade around the main drilling axis; this blade, called the \\"flighting\\", carries the ice cuttings up from the bottom of the hole.Talalay (2016), p. 27‚Äì28. For drilling deeper holes, extensions can be added to the auger, but as the auger gets longer it becomes more difficult to rotate. With a platform such as a stepladder, a longer auger can be rotated from higher off the ground. Commercially available ice augers for winter fishing, powered by petrol, propane, or battery power, are available for hole diameters from 4.5 in to 10 in. For holes deeper than 2 m a tripod can be used to winch the auger from the hole. A folding brace handle with an offset design is common; this allows both hands to contribute to the torque.  Coring augers  Coring ice auger with no barrel. Designs like this proved difficult to make sufficiently rigid. Augers that are capable of retrieving ice cores are similar to noncoring augers, except that the flights are set around a hollow core barrel. Augers have been devised that consist of the helical cutting blades and a space for a core, without the central supporting cylinder, but they are difficult to make sufficiently rigid. Coring augers typically produce cores with diameters in the range 75‚Äì100 mm, and with lengths up to 1 m. Coring augers were originally designed to be manually rotated, but over time they have been adapted for use with handheld drills or small engines. As with noncoring augers, extensions can be added to drill deeper. Drilling deeper than 6 m requires more than one person because of the weight of the drill string. A clamp placed at the surface is useful for supporting the string, and a tripod and block and tackle can also be used for support and to increase the weight of string that can be handled. As the drill string gets longer, it takes more time to complete a trip to extract a core, since each extension rod must be separated from the drill string when tripping out, and re-attached when tripping in. Drilling with a tripod or other method of handling a long drill string considerably extends the depth limit for the use of a coring auger. The deepest hole drilled by hand with an auger was 55 m, in the Ward Hunt Ice Shelf on Ellesmere Island, in 1960. Usually a hole deeper than 30 m will be drilled with other methods, because of the weight of the drill string and the long trip time required. Modern coring augers have changed little in decades: an ice coring auger patented in the US in 1932 closely resembles coring augers in use eighty years later. The US military's Frost Effects Laboratory (FEL) developed an ice mechanics testing kit that included a coring auger in the late 1940s; the Snow, Ice and Permafrost Research Establishment (SIPRE), a successor organization, refined the design in the early 1950s, and the resulting auger, known as the SIPRE auger, is still in wide use. It was modified slightly by the Cold Regions Research and Engineering Laboratory (CRREL), another successor organization, in the 1960s, and is sometimes known as the CRREL auger for that reason.Talalay (2016), pp. 37‚Äì39. An auger developed in the 1970s by the Polar Ice Core Office (PICO), then based in Lincoln, Nebraska, is also still widely used.Talalay (2016), pp. 40‚Äì41. A coring auger designed at the University of Copenhagen in the 1980s was used for the first time at Camp Century, and since then has been frequently used in Greenland.Talalay (2016), pp. 42‚Äì43. In 2009, the US Ice Drilling Design and Operations group (IDDO) began work on an improved hand auger design and a version was successfully tested in the field during the 2012‚Äì2013 field season at WAIS Divide.Goetz & Shturmakov (2013), p. 66.Talalay (2016), pp. 45‚Äì46. As of 2017 IDDO maintains both 3-inch and 4-inch diameter versions of the new auger for the use of US ice drilling research programs, and these are now the most-requested hand augers provided by IDDO.Anonymous (2017), p. 8. The Prairie Dog auger, designed in 2007, adds an outer barrel to the basic coring auger design. Cuttings are captured between the auger flights and the outer barrel, which has an anti-torque section to prevent it from rotating in the hole.Talalay (2016), pp. 43‚Äì44. The goal of the outer barrel is to increase the efficiency of chip collection, since it is common to see chips from a hand auger run fall back into the hole from the auger flights, which means the next run has to redrill through these cuttings.Kyne & McConnell (2007), p. 99. The outer barrel also makes the auger effective in warm ice, which could easily cause an auger with no outer barrel to jam. The outside barrel of the Prairie Dog is the same as the diameter of the PICO auger, and since the Prairie Dog's anti-torque blades do not perform well in soft snow and firn, it is common to start a hole with the PICO auger and then continue it with the Prairie Dog once dense firn is reached.Bentley et al. (2009), pp. 258‚Äì259. The Prairie Dog is relatively heavy, and can require two drillers to handle it as it is being removed from the hole. The IDDO maintains a Prairie Dog drill for the use of US ice drilling research programs.Anonymous (30 June 2017), Ice Drilling Design and Operations: Long Range Technology Plan, p. 10. IDDO also provides a lifting system for use with hand augers, known as the Sidewinder. It is driven by an electric hand drill, which can be powered by a generator or by solar cells.Bentley et al. (2009), p. 259. The Sidewinder winds a rope around the hand auger as it is lowered into the hole, and assists in raising the auger back out of the hole. This extends the maximum practical depth for hand augering to about 40 m. Sidewinders have proved popular with researchers.Anonymous (30 June 2017), Ice Drilling Design and Operations: Long Range Technology Plan, p. 9.Talalay (2016), p. 44.  Piston drills  A piston drill consists of a flat disc at the bottom of a long rod, with three or four radial slots in the disc, each of which has a cutting edge. The rod is rotated by hand, using a brace handle; the ice comes through the slots and piles up on top of the disc. Pulling the drill out of the borehole brings the cuttings up on the disc. In the 1940s some patents for piston drill designs were filed in Sweden and the U.S., but these drills are now rarely used. They are less efficient than auger drills, since the drill must be periodically removed from the hole to get rid of the cuttings.Talalay (2016), p. 34‚Äì35.Talalay (2016), p. 50.  Hand core drills and mini drills  Some hand drills have been designed to retrieve cores without using auger flights to transport the cuttings up the hole. These drills typically have a core barrel with teeth at the lower end, and are rotated by a brace or T-handle, or by a small engine. The barrel itself can be omitted, so that the drill consists only of a ring with a cutting slot to cut the annulus around the core, and a vertical rod to attach the ring to the surface. A couple of small hand-held drills, or mini drills, have been designed to quickly collect core samples up to 50 cm long. A difficulty with all these designs is that as soon as cuttings are generated, if they are not removed they will interfere with the cutting action of the drill, making these tools slow and inefficient in use.Talalay (2016), pp. 45‚Äì51. A very small drill, known as the Chipmunk Drill, was designed by IDDO for use by a project in West Greenland in 2003 and 2004, and was subsequently used at the South Pole in 2013.Anonymous (30 June 2017), Ice Drilling Design and Operations: Long Range Technology Plan, p. 7.  Rotary rigs using drillpipe  Rotary rigs used in mineral drilling use a string of drillpipe connected to a drillbit at the bottom of the hole, and to a rotary mechanism at the top of the hole, such as a top drive or rotary table and kelly. As the borehole deepens, drilling is paused periodically to add a new length of drill pipe at the top of the drill string. These projects have usually been undertaken with commercially available rotary rigs originally designed for mineral drilling, with adaptations to suit the special needs of ice drilling.Talalay (2016), pp. 59‚Äì99.  Dry drilling  When drilling in ice, the hole may be drilled dry, with no mechanism to dispose of the cuttings. In snow and firn this means that the cuttings simply compact into the walls of the borehole; and in coring drills they also compact into the core. In ice, the cuttings accumulate in the space between the drillpipe and the borehole wall, and eventually start to clog the drill bit, usually after no more than 1 m of progress. This increases the torque needed to drill, slows down progress, and can cause the loss of the drill. Dry core drilling generally produces a poor quality core that is broken into pieces.Talalay (2016), p. 59. In 1950, the French Exp√©dition Polaires Fran√ßaises (EPF) drilled two dry holes in Greenland using a rotary rig, at Camp VI, on the west coast, and Station Centrale, inland, reaching 126 m and 151 m.Talalay (2016), pp. 61‚Äì62. Some shallow holes were also drilled that summer on Baffin Island, using a coring drill,Talalay (2016), pp. 62‚Äì63. and in the Antarctic, the Norwegian‚ÄìBritish‚ÄìSwedish Antarctic Expedition (NBSAE) drilled several holes between April 1950 and the following year, eventually reaching 100 m in one hole.Talalay (2016), p. 63. The last expedition to try dry drilling in ice was the 2nd Soviet Antarctic Expedition (SAE), which drilled three holes between July 1957 and January 1958.Talalay (2016), p. 64. Since that time dry drilling has been abandoned as other drilling methods have proved to be more effective.  Air circulation  Several holes have been drilled in ice using direct air circulation, in which compressed air is pumped down the drillpipe, to escape through holes in the drillbit, and return up the annular space between the drillbit and the borehole, carrying the cuttings with it. The technique was first tried by the 1st Soviet Antarctic Expedition, in October 1956. There were problems with poor cuttings removal, and ice forming in the borehole, but the drill succeeded in reaching a depth of 86.5 m.Talalay (2016), p. 71. Further attempts were made to use air circulation with rotary rigs by US, Soviet and Belgian expeditions, with a maximum hole depth of 411 m reached by a US team at Site 2 in Greenland in 1957. The last time a project used a conventional rotary rig with air circulation was 1961.Talalay (2016), pp. 60‚Äì61.  Fluid circulation  In mineral exploration, the most common drilling method is a rotary rig with fluid circulated down the drillpipe and back up between the drillpipe and the borehole wall. The fluid carries the cuttings to the surface, where the cuttings are removed, and the recycled fluid, known as mud, is returned to the hole. The first ice drilling project to try this approach was an American Geographical Society expedition to the Taku Glacier in 1950. Fresh water, drawn from the glacier, was used as the drilling fluid, and three holes were drilled, to a maximum depth of 89 m. Cores were retrieved, but in poor condition.Talalay (2016), p. 77. Seawater has also been tried as a drilling fluid.Talalay (2016), p. 79. The first time a fluid other than water was used with a conventional rotary rig was in late 1958, at Little America V, where diesel fuel was used for the last few metres of a 254 m hole.Talalay (2016), p. 75.  Wireline  A wireline drill uses air or fluid circulation, but also has a tool that can be lowered into the drillpipe to retrieve a core without removing the drill string. The tool, called an overshot, latches onto the core barrel and pulls it up to the surface. When the core is removed, the core barrel is lowered back into the borehole and reattached to the drill. A wireline core drilling project was planned in the 1970s for the International Antarctic Glaciological Project, but was never completed, and the first wireline ice drilling project took place in 1976, as part of the Ross Ice Shelf Project (RISP). A hole was started in November of that year with a wireline drill, probably using air circulation, but problems with the overshot forced the project to switch to thermal drilling when the hole was 103 m deep.Talalay (2016), pp. 80‚Äì81. The RISP project reached over 170 m with another wireline drill the following season, and several 1980s Soviet expedition also used wireline drills, after starting the holes with an auger drill and casing the holes.Talalay (2016), pp. 82‚Äì83. The Agile Sub-Ice Geological (ASIG) drill, designed by IDDO to collect sub-glacial cores, is a recent wireline system; it was first used in the field in the 2016‚Äì2017 season, in West Antarctica.Anonymous (30 June 2017), Ice Drilling Design and Operations: Long Range Technology Plan, p. 19.  Assessment  There are many disadvantages to using conventional rotary rigs for ice drilling. When a conventional rotary rig is used for coring, the entire drill string must be hoisted out of the borehole each time the core is retrieved; each length of pipe in turn must be unscrewed and racked. As the hole gets deeper, this becomes very time-consuming. Conventional rigs are very heavy, and since many ice drilling sites are not easily accessible these rigs place a large logistical burden on an ice drilling project. For deep holes, a drilling fluid is required to maintain pressure in the borehole and prevent the hole from closing up because of the pressure the ice is under; a drilling fluid requires additional heavy equipment to circulate and store the fluid, and to separate the circulated material. Any circulation system also requires the upper part of the hole, through the snow and firn, to be cased, since circulated air or fluid would escape through anything more permeable than ice. Commercial rotary rigs are not designed for extremely cold temperatures, and in addition to problems with components such as the hydraulics and fluid management systems, they are designed to operate outdoors, which is impractical in extreme environments such as Antarctic drilling.Talalay (2016), p. 97. Commercial rotary rigs can be effective for large-diameter holes, and can also be used for subglacial drilling into rock. They have also been used with some success for rock glaciers, which are challenging to drill because they contain a heterogeneous mixture of ice and rock.Talalay (2016), p. 88.  Flexible drillstem rigs  Flexible drillstem rigs use a drill string that is continuous, so that it does not have to be assembled or disassembled, rod by rod or pipe by pipe, when tripping in or out. The drill string is also flexible, so that when out of the borehole it can be stored on a reel. The drill string may be a reinforced hose, or it may be steel or composite pipe, in which case it is known as a coiled-tubing drill. Rigs designed along these lines began to appear in the 1960s and 1970s in mineral drilling, and became commercially viable in the 1990s. Only one such rig, the rapid air movement (RAM) system developed at the University of Wisconsin-Madison by Ice Coring and Drilling Services (ICDS), has been used for ice drilling.Talalay (2016), pp. 101‚Äì103. The RAM drill was developed in the early 2000s, and was originally designed for drilling shot holes for seismic exploration.Anonymous (30 June 2017), Ice Drilling Design and Operations: Long Range Technology Plan, p. 18. The drill stem is a hose through which air is pumped; the air drives a turbine that powers a downhole rotary drill bit. Ice cuttings are removed by the exhaust air and fountain out of the hole. The compressor increases the temperature of the air by about 50¬∞, and it is cooled again before being pumped downhole, with a final temperature about 10¬∞ warmer than the ambient air. This means it cannot be used in ambient temperatures warmer than ‚àí10 ¬∞C. To avoid ice forming in the hose, ethanol is added to the compressed air. The system, which includes a winch to hold 100 m of hose, as well as two air compressors, is mounted on a sled.Bentley et al. (2009), p. 285. It has successfully drilling hundreds of holes in West Antarctica, and was easily able to drill to 90 m in only 25 minutes, making it the fastest ice drill. It was also used by the Askaryan Radio Array project in 2010‚Äì2011 at the South Pole, but was unable to drill below 63 m there because of variations in the local characteristics of the ice and firn.Talalay (2016), p. 107. It cannot be used in a fluid-filled hole, which limits the maximum hole depth for this design. The main problem with the RAM drill is a loss of air circulation in firn and snow, which might be addressed by using reverse air circulation, via a vacuum pump drawing air up through the hose. As of 2017 IDDO is planning a revised design for the RAM drill to reduce the weight of the drill, which is currently 10.3 tonnes. Other flexible drill stem designs have been considered, and in some cases tested, but as of 2016 none had been successfully used in the field. One design suggested using hot water to drill via a hose, and replacing the drillhead with a mechanical drill for coring once the depth of interest is reached, using the hot water both to hydraulically power the down hole motor, and to melt the resulting ice cuttings.Talalay (2016), p. 103. Another design, the RADIX drill, produces a very narrow hole (20 mm) and is intended for rapid drilling access holes; it uses a small hydraulic motor on a narrow hose. It was tested in 2015 but found to have difficulty with cuttings transport, probably because of the very narrow space available between the hose and the borehole wall.Talalay (2016), pp. 104‚Äì105. Coiled-tubing designs have never been successfully used for ice drilling. Coring operations would be particularly difficult, since a coring drill must trip out and in for each core, which would lead to fatigue; the tubing is typically rated for a lifetime of only 100 to 200 trips.  Cable-suspended electromechanical drills  upright=1.5 A cable-suspended drill has a downhole system, known as a sonde, to drill the hole.Bentley et al. (2009), pp. 226‚Äì227. The sonde is connected to the surface by an armoured cable, which provides power and enables the drill to be winched in and out of the hole. Electromechanical (EM) cable-suspended drills have a cutting head, with blades that shave the ice as they rotate, like a carpenter's plane. The depth of penetration of the cut is adjusted by a device called a shoe, which is part of the cutting head. The ice cuttings are stored in a chamber in the sonde, either in the core barrel, above the core, or in a separate chamber, further up the drill. The cuttings can be transported by auger flights or by fluid circulation. Drills that rely on auger flights and which are not designed to work in a fluid-filled hole are limited to depths at which borehole closure is not a problem, so these are known as shallow drills. Deeper holes have to be drilled with drilling fluid, but whereas circulation in a rotary drill takes the fluid all the way down and then up the borehole, cable-suspended drills only need to circulate the fluid from the drill head up to the cuttings chamber. This is known as bottom-hole circulation. The upper part of the sonde has an antitorque system, which most commonly consists of three or four leaf-springs that press out against the borehole walls. Sharp edges on the leaf springs catch in the walls and provide the necessary resistance to prevent this part of the drill from rotating. At the point where the cable connects to the sonde, most drills include a slip ring, to allow the drill to rotate independently of the cable. This is to prevent torque damage to the cable if the anti-torque system fails. Coring drills may also have a weight that can be used as a hammer to assist in breaking the core, and a chamber for any instrumentation or sensors needed. At the bottom of the sonde is the cutting head, and above this is the core barrel, with auger flights around it on shallow drills, and typically an outer barrel around that, usually with internal vertical ribs or some other way of providing additional impetus to the upward-bound cuttings on the flights. If there is a separate chip chamber it will be above the core barrel. The motor, with suitable gearing, is also above the core barrel. Shallow drills can retrieve cores up to 300‚Äì350 m deep, but core quality is much improved if drilling fluid is present, so some shallow drills have been designed to work in wet holes. Tests reported in 2014 showed that wet drilling, with the top of the drilling fluid no deeper than 250 m, would maintain good core quality. Drilling fluids are necessary for drilling deep holes, so the cable-suspended drills that are used for these projects use a pump to provide fluid circulation, in order to remove the cuttings from the bit. A few drills designed for use with drilling fluid also have auger flights on the inner barrel. As with shallow drills, the cuttings are stored in a chamber above the core. The circulation can be in either direction: down the inside of the drill string, and up between the core barrel and the borehole wall, or in the reverse direction, which has become the favoured approach in drill design as it gives better cuttings removal for a lower flow rate.Talalay (2016), pp. 252‚Äì253. Drills capable of reaching depths over 1500 m are known as deep drilling systems; they have generally similar designs to the intermediate systems that can drill from 400 m to 1500 m, but must have heavier and more robust systems such as winches, and have longer drills and larger drilling shelters. Core diameters for these drills have varied from 50 mm to 132 mm, and the core length from as short as 0.35 m up to 6 m. A common design feature of these deep drills is that they can be tipped to the horizontal to make it easier to remove the core and the cuttings. This reduces the required height of the mast, but requires a deep slot to be cut into the ice, to make room for the sonde to swing up.Bentley et al. (2009), pp. 227‚Äì228. The first cable- suspended electromechanical drill was invented by Armais Arutunoff for use in mineral drilling; it was tested in 1947 in Oklahoma, but did not perform well.Talalay (2016), p. 179.Shoemaker (2002), p. 24. CRREL acquired a reconditioned Arutunoff drill in 1963,Hansen (1994), p. 7. modified it for drilling in ice, and in 1966 used it to extend a hole at Camp Century in Greenland to the base of the ice cap, at 1387 m, and 4 m further into the bedrock. Many other drills have since been based on this basic design. A recent variation on the basic EM drill design is the Rapid Access Isotope Drill, designed by the British Antarctic Survey to drill dry holes to 600 m.Talalay (2014), p. 340. This drill does not collect a complete ice core; instead it will collect ice cuttings, using a cutting head similar to a spoonborer. The resulting access hole will be used for temperature profiling, and along with the isotope results which will indicate the age of the ice, the data will be used for modeling the ice profile down to bedrock in order to determine the best place to drill to obtain the oldest possible undisturbed basal ice. The drill is expected to reach 600 m in 7 days of drilling, rather than the 2 months which would be needed to drill a core; the speed is because the cutters can be more aggressive as core quality is not an issue, and because the borehole is narrow which reduces power requirements for the winch.  Thermal drills  Thermal drills work by applying heat to the ice at the bottom of the borehole to melt it. Thermal drills in general are able to drill successfully in temperate ice, where an electromechanical drill is at risk of jamming because of ice forming in the borehole. When used in colder ice, some form of antifreeze is likely to be introduced into the borehole to prevent the meltwater from freezing in the drill.  Hot water and steam drills  center Hot water can be used to drill in ice by pumping it down a hose with a nozzle at the end; the jet of hot water will quickly produce a hole. Letting the hose dangle freely will produce a straight hole; as the hole gets deeper the weight of the hose makes this hard to manage manually, and at a depth of about 100 m it becomes necessary to run the hose over a pulley and enlist some method to help lower and raise the hose, usually consisting of a hose reel, capstan, or some type of hose assist.Iken et al. (1976), p. 145. Since the pressure in the hose is proportional to the square of the flow, hose diameter is one of the limiting factors for a hot-water drill. To increase flow rate beyond a certain point, the hose diameter must be increased, but this will require significant capacity increases elsewhere in the drill design.Bentley et al. (2009), pp. 264‚Äì265. Hoses that are wrapped around a drum before being pressurized will exert constricting force on the drum, so the drums must be of robust design.Bentley et al. (2009), p. 272. Hoses must wrap neatly when spooling up, to avoid damage; this can be done manually for smaller systems, but for very large drills a level-wind system has to be implemented.Bentley et al. (2009), p. 273. The hose ideally should have the tensile strength to support its weight when spooling into the hole, but for very deep holes a supporting cable may need to be used to support the hose.Bentley et al. (2009), p. 274. Steam can also be used in place of hot water, and does not need to be pumped. A handheld steam drill is able to rapidly drill short holes, for example for ablation stakes, and both steam and hotwater drills can be made light enough to be hand carried. A guide tube can be used to help keep the borehole straight. In cold ice, a borehole drilled with hot water will close up as the water freezes. To avoid this, the drill can be run back down the hole, warming the water and hence the surrounding ice. This is a form of reaming. Repeated reamings will raise the temperature of the surrounding ice to the point where the borehole will stay open for longer periods.Bentley et al. (2009), p. 265. However, if the goal is to measure temperature in the borehole, then it is better to apply as little additional heat as possible to the surrounding ice, which means that a higher energy drill with a high water flow rate is desirable, since this will be more efficient. If there is a risk of the drill freezing in, a \\"back drill\\" can be included in the design. This is a mechanism which redirects the hot water jet upwards if the drill meets with resistance on tripping out.Bentley et al. (2009), p. 275. A separate hot water reamer can also be used, jetting hot water sideways onto the borehole walls as it passes. Boreholes drilled with hot water are rather irregular, which makes them unsuitable for certain kinds of investigations, such as speed of borehole closure, or inclinometry measurements. The warm water from the nozzle will continue to melt the borehole walls as it rises, and this will tend to make the hole cone-shaped‚Äîif the hole is being drilled at a location with no surface snow or firn, such as an ablation zone in a glacier, then this effect will persist to the top of the borehole. The water supply for a hot water drill can come from water at the surface, if available, or melted snow. The meltwater in the borehole can be reused, but this can only be done once the hole penetrates below the firn to the impermeable ice layer, because above this level the meltwater escapes. The pump to bring the meltwater back to the surface must be placed below this level, and in addition, if there is a chance that the borehole will penetrate to the base of the ice, the drilling project must plan for the likelihood that this will change the water level in the hole, and ensure that the pump is below the lowest likely level.Bentley et al. (2009), pp. 266‚Äì267. Heating systems are usually adapted from the heaters used in the pressure washer industry.Bentley et al. (2009), p. 271. upright=2.5When any thermal drilling method is used in dirty ice, the debris will accumulate at the bottom of the borehole, and start to impede the drill; enough debris, in the form of sand, pebbles, or a large rock, could completely stop progress.Bentley et al. (2009), p. 267. One way to avoid this is to have a nozzle angled at 45¬∞; using this nozzle will create a side channel into which the obstructions will go. Vertical drilling can then start again, bypassing the debris. Another approach is to recirculate the water at the bottom of the hole, with an electrical heater embedded in the drill head and filters in the circulation. This can remove most of the small debris that impedes the drillhead.Rado et al. (1987), pp. 236‚Äì238. A different problem with impure ice comes from contaminants brought in by the project, such as clothing and wood fibres, dust, and grit. Using snow from around the campsite to supply the drill with water is often necessary at the start of drilling, as the hole will not yet have reached the impermeable ice, so water cannot be pumped back up from the bottom of the hole; shoveling this snow into the drill's water supply will pass these contaminants through the drill mechanism, and can damage the pumps and valves. A fine filter is required to avoid these problems.Bentley et al. (2009), p. 276. An early expedition using hot water drills was in 1955, to the Mer de Glace; √âlectricit√© de France used hot water to reach the base of the glacier, and also used equipment that sprayed multiple jets simultaneously to create a tunnel under the ice.Reynaud & Courdouan (1962), p. 813. More development work was done in the 1970s.Gillet (1975), pp. 171‚Äì174. Hot water drills are now capable of drilling very deep holes and capable of clean access for sub glacial lakes: for example, between 2012‚Äì2019 on the WISSARD/SALSA project, the WISSARD drill, a mid-sized hot water drill, drilled clean access up to 1 km at Lake Mercer in Antarctica; and between 2004 and 2011, a large hot water drill at the South Pole was used to drill 86 holes to a depth of 2.5 km to set strings of sensors in the boreholes, for the IceCube project.Benson et al. (2014), p. 113. Hot water coring drills have also been developed but are susceptible to debris stopping forward motion in dirty ice.Bentley et al. (2009), p. 264. An early steam drill was developed by F. Howorka in the early 1960s for work in the Alps.Howorka (1965), pp. 749‚Äì750. Steam drills are not used for holes deeper than 30 m, as they are quite inefficientBentley et al. (2009), pp. 283‚Äì284. due to thermal losses along the hose, and pressure losses with increasing depth under water.Rado et al. (1987), p. 236. They are primarily used for quickly drilling shallow holes.  Hotpoints  Instead of using a jet of hot water or steam, thermal drills can also be constructed to provide heat to a durable drillhead, for example by pumping hot water down and back up again inside the drill string, and use that to melt the ice. Modern thermal drills use electrical power to heat the drillhead instead. It is possible to drill with a hotpoint that consists of an electrical heating element, directly exposed to the ice; this means that the element must be able to work underwater.Ract-Madoux & Reynaud (1951), p. 303. Some drills instead embed the heating element in a material such as silver or copper that will conduct the heat quickly to the hotpoint surface;Shreve (1962), pp. 151‚Äì152. these can be constructed so that the electrical connections are not exposed to water.Ward (1961), p. 537. Electrothermal drills require a cable to bring the power down the hole; the circuit can be completed via the drillpipe if one is present.Sharp (1951), pp. 479‚Äì480. A transformer is needed in the drill assembly since the cable must carry high voltage to avoid power dissipation.Hansen (1994), pp. 5‚Äì6. It is more difficult to arrange electrical power at a remote location than to generate heat via a gas boiler, so hotpoint drills are only used for boreholes up to a few hundred metres deep.Bentley et al. (2009), p. 284. The earliest attempt to use heat to drill in ice was in 1904, when C. Bernard, drilling at the T√™te Rousse Glacier, tried using heated iron bars to drill with. The ends of the bars were heated until incandescent, and lowered into the borehole.Mercanton (1905), pp. 461‚Äì462. The first true hotpoint was used by Mario Calciati in 1942 on the Hosand Glacier. Calciati pumped hot water from the surface down the drillstem, and back up after it had passed through the drillhead.Kasser (1960), p. 99.Renaud & Mercanton (1950), pp. 67‚Äì68. Other hotpoint designs have used electrical heating to heat the drillhead; this was done in 1948 by a British expedition to the Jungfraujoch,Gerrard et al. (1952), pp. 548‚Äì551. and by many other drill designs since then. Hotpoints do not produce cores, so they are used primarily for creating access holes.  Electrothermal coring drills  359x359px The development in the 1960s of thermal coring drills for intermediate depth holes was prompted by the problems associated with rotary coring drills, which were too costly to use for polar ice cores because of the logistical problems caused by their weight.Bird (1976), p. 1.Langway (1967), pp. 102‚Äì104. The components of a thermal drill are generally the same as for a cable-suspended EM drill: both have a mast and winch, and an armoured cable to provide power downhole to a sonde, which includes a core barrel. No antitorque system is needed for a thermal drill, and instead of a motor that provides torque, the power is used to generate heat in the cutting head, which is ring shaped to melt an annulus of ice around the core. Some drills may also have a centralizer, to keep the sonde in the middle of the borehole. The sonde of an electrothermal drill designed to run submerged in meltwater may consist almost entirely of the core barrel plus the heated cutting head (diagram (a) in the figure to the right). Alternative designs for use in colder ice (see diagram (b) at right) may have a compartment above the core barrel, and tubes that run down to just above the cutting head; a vacuum pump sucks up the meltwater. In these drills the meltwater must be emptied at the surface at the end of each coring run. Another approach (see (c) at right) is to use a drilling fluid that is a mixture of ethanol and water, with the exact proportions determined by the ice temperature. In these drills there is a piston above the core barrel and at the start of a run the piston is at the bottom of the sonde, and the space above is filled with drilling fluid. As the drills cuts downwards, the core pushes the piston up, pumping the fluid down and out around the cutting head, where it mixes with the meltwater and prevents it from freezing. The piston is the only moving part, which simplifies the design; and the core barrel can take up much of the length of the sonde, whereas drills which suck out the meltwater in order to drill in a dry hole have to sacrifice a large section of the sonde for meltwater storage.Zagorodnov & Thompson (2014), pp. 324‚Äì325. Thermal drills designed for temperate ice are light and straightforward to operate, which makes them suitable for use on high-altitude glaciers, though this also requires that the drill can be disassembled into components for human-powered transport to the most inaccessible locations, since helicopters may not be able to reach the highest glaciers.Zagorodnov & Thompson (2014), p. 323.Koci (2002), pp. 1‚Äì2. Electrothermal drill designs date back to the 1940s. An electrothermal drill was patented in Switzerland in May 1946 by Ren√© Koechlin, and was used in Switzerland,Nizery (1951), pp. 66‚Äì72.Koechlin (1946), pp. 1‚Äì5.Remenieras & Terrier (1951), p. 255. and in 1948 a British expedition to the Jungfraujoch drilled to the bed of the glacier using an electrothermal design. Twenty electrothermal coring drills were designed between 1964 and 2005, though many designs were abandoned because of the higher performance of EM coring drills.  Autonomous probes  Cryobot design for NASA Martian ice cap probe, partly built in 2001 If the goal is to obtain instrument readings from within the ice, and there is no need to retrieve either the ice or the drill system, then a probe containing a long spool of cable and a hotpoint can be used. The hotpoint allows the probe to melt its way through the ice, unreeling the cable behind it. The meltwater will refreeze, so the probe cannot be recovered, but it can continue to penetrate the ice until it reaches the limit of the cable it carries, and send instrument readings back up through the cable to the surface. Known as Philberth probes,Aamot (1968a), p. 321. these devices were designed by Karl and Bernhard Philberth in the 1960s as a way to store nuclear waste in the Antarctic, but were never used for that purpose. Instead, they were adapted to use for glaciological research, reaching a depth of 1005 metres and sending temperature information back to the surface when tested in 1968 as part of the Exp√©dition Glaciologique Internationale au Groenland (EGIG).Bentley et al. (2009), pp. 286‚Äì287.Philberth (1976), p. 117. Because thermal probes support their weight on the ice at the bottom of the borehole, they lean slightly out of the vertical, and this means they have a natural tendency to stray away from a vertical borehole towards the horizontal. Various methods have been proposed to address this. A cone-shaped tip, with a layer of mercury above the tip, will cause additional heat transfer to the lower side of a slanting borehole, increasing the speed of melting on that side, and returning the borehole to the vertical.Philberth (1972), p. 10. Alternatively the probe can be constructed to be supported by ice above its centre of gravity, by providing two heating rings, one of which is towards the top of the probe, and has a greater diameter than the rest of the probe. Giving this upper ring a slightly lower heating power will cause the probe to have more bearing pressure on the upper ring, which will give it a natural tendency to swing back to vertical if the borehole starts to deviate. The effect is called pendulum steering, by analogy with the tendency of a pendulum always to swing back towards a vertical position.Aamot (1967), p. 1. In the 1990s NASA combined the Philberth probe design with ideas drawn from hot-water drills, to design a cryobot probe that had hot water jets in addition to a hotpoint nose. Once the probe was submerged in a thin layer of meltwater, the water was drawn in and reheated, emerging at the nose as a jet. This design was intended to help move particulate matter away from the nose, as a hot-water drill tends to. A version with no analytical tools on board was built and field tested in Svalbard, Norway, in 2001. It penetrated to 23 m, successfully passing through layers of particulates.Bentley et al. (2009), 288‚Äì289. Cryobots remain in good thermal contact with the surrounding ice throughout their descent, and in very cold ice this can drain a substantial fraction of their power budget, which is finite since they must carry their power source with them. This makes them unsuitable for investigating the Martian polar ice cap. Instead, NASA added a pump to the cryobot design, to raise meltwater to the surface, so that the probe, known as the SIPR (for Subsurface Ice Probe) descends in a dry hole. The lower gravity on Mars means that the overburden pressure on the ice cap is much less, and an open borehole is expected to be stable to a depth of 3 km, the expected depth of the ice cap. The meltwater can then be analyzed at the surface. Pumping through a vertical tube will cause mixing, so to ensure discrete samples for analysis at the surface, a large bore and a small bore tube are used; the small bore tube is used for sampling, and then its contents are allowed to return to the probe and are pumped back up the large bore tube for use in experiments that do not depend on stratigraphy, such as searches for living organisms. Leaving the analytical instruments on the surface reduces the necessary size of the probe, which helps make this design more efficient.Cardell et al. (2004), pp. 1‚Äì2. Along with the water transport tubes, a heated wire ensures that the water stays liquid all the way to the surface, and power and telemetry is also carried from the surface. To keep the hole vertical the probe can sense when it is deviating, and the jets of hot water are adjusted to compensate. The drill is expected to make use of solar power in operation, meaning it must be able to function on less than 100 W when in sunlight. A fully built version of the probe was successfully tested in Greenland in 2006, drilling to a depth of 50 m.Bentley et al. (2009), p. 291. NASA has proposed a similar design for drilling in the ice on Europa, a moon of Jupiter. Any such probe would have to survive temperatures of 500 ¬∞C while being sterilized to avoid biological contamination of the target environment.  Other drill types   Snow samplers  Snow samples are taken to measure the depth and density of the snow pack in a given area. Measurements of depth and density can be converted into a snow water equivalent (SWE) number, which is the depth of water that would result from converting the snow into water. Snow samplers are typically hollow cylinders, with toothed ends to help them penetrate the snow pack; they are used by pushing them into the snow, and then pulling them out along with the snow in the cylinder.Talalay (2016), pp. 15‚Äì16. Weighing the cylinder full of snow and subtracting the weight of the empty cylinder gives the snow weight; samplers usually have lengthwise slots to allow the depth of the snow to be recorded as well, though a sampler made of transparent material makes this unnecessary. The sampler must grip the snow well enough to keep the snow inside the cylinder as it is removed from the snow, which is easier to accomplish with a smaller diameter cylinder; however, larger diameters give more accurate readings. Samples must avoid compacting the snow, so they have smooth inner surfaces (usually of anodized aluminium alloy, and sometimes waxed in addition) to prevent the snow from gripping the sides of the cylinder as it is pushed in. A sampler may penetrate light snow under its own weight; denser snow pack, firn, or ice, may require the user to rotate the sampler gently so that the cutting teeth are engaged. Pushing too hard without successfully cutting a dense layer may cause the sample to push the layer down; this situation can be identified because the snow level inside the sampler will be lower than the surrounding snow. Multiple readings are usually taken at each location of interest, and the results are averaged. Snow samplers are usually accurate to within about 5‚Äì10%. The first snow sampler was developed by J.E. Church in the winter of 1908/1909, and the most common modern snow sampler, known as the Federal snow sampler, is based on Church's design, with some modifications by George D. Clyde and the U.S. Soil Conservation Service in the 1930s. It can be used for sampling snow up to 9 m in depth.Talalay (2016), pp. 16‚Äì18.  Penetration testers  Penetration testing involves inserting a probe into snow to determine the snow's mechanical properties. Experienced snow surveyors can use an ordinary ski pole to test snow hardness by pushing it into the snow; the results are recorded based on the change in resistance felt as the pole is inserted. A more scientific tool, invented in the 1930s but still in widespread use, is a ram penetrometer. This takes the form of a rod with a cone at the lower end. The upper end of the rod passes through a weight that is used as a hammer; the weight is lifted and released, and hits an anvil‚Äîa ledge around the rod which it cannot pass‚Äîwhich drives the rod into the snow. To take a measurement, the rod is placed on the snow and the hammer is dropped one or more times; the resulting depth of penetration is recorded. In soft snow a lighter hammer can be used to obtain more precise results; hammer weights range from 2 kg down to 0.1 kg.Talalay (2016), pp. 20‚Äì21. Even with lighter hammers, ram penetrometers have difficulty distinguishing thin layers of snow, which limits their usefulness with regard to avalanche studies, since thin and soft layers are often involved in avalanche formation.Talalay (2016), p. 24. Two lightweight tools are in wide use that are more sensitive than ram penetrometers. A snow micro-penetrometer uses a motor to drive a rod into snow, measuring the force required; it is sensitive to 0.01‚Äì0.05 newtons, depending on the snow strength. A SABRE probe consists of a rod that is inserted manually into snow; accelerometer readings are then used to determine the penetrative force needed at each depth, and stored electronically. For testing dense polar snow, a cone penetrometer test (CPT) is use, based on the equivalent devices used for soil testing. CPT measurements can be used in hard snow and firn to depths of 5‚Äì10 m.Talalay (2016), pp. 22‚Äì23.  Rotary auger rigs  24-inch auger used by the US Navy in testing polar construction equipment in 1967 Commercially available rotary rigs have been used with large augers to drill in ice, generally for construction or for holes to gain access below the ice. Although they are unable to produce cores, they have been intermittently used by US and Soviet scientific expeditions in the Antarctic.Talalay (2016), pp. 64‚Äì71. In 2012, a British Antarctic Survey expedition to drill down to Lake Ellsworth, two miles below the surface of the Antarctic ice, used an Australian earth auger driven by a truck-mounted top drive to help drill two 300 m holes as part of the project, though in the event the project was delayed.Talalay (2016), p. 68.Siegert et al. (2014), p. 63. Powered augers designed to drill large holes through ice for winter fishing may be mounted on a snow vehicle, or a tractor or sled; hole diameters can be as high as 350 mm. These rigs have been produced commercially in both the US and the USSR, but are no longer in common use.  Flame-jet drills  A flame-jet drill, more usually used to drill through crystalline rocks, was used to drill through ice on the Ross Ice Shelf, in the 1970s. The drill burns fuel oil, and can be run under water as long as enough compressed air is available. It drills rapidly, but produces an irregular hole contaminated by soot and fuel oil.Bentley et al. (2009), p. 283.  Vibratory drills  A Soviet-designed drill used a motor to provide vertical vibration to the barrel of the drill at 50 Hz; the drill had an outer diameter of 0.4 m, and in tests at Vostok Station in the Antarctic drilled a 6.5 m hole, with a 1.2 m drilling run taking between 1 and 5 minutes to complete. The drill's steel edges compacted snow into the core, which helped it stick to the inside of the barrel when the drill was winched out of the hole.Talalay (2016), pp. 19‚Äì20.Morev & Zagorodnov (1992), pp. 1‚Äì2.  Drilling system components   Cutters  upright=2 Mechanical drills typically have three cutters, spaced evenly around the drill head. Two cutters leads to vibration and poorer ice core quality, and tests of drillheads with four cutters have produced unsatisfactory performance. Geometric design varies, but the relief angle, Œ±, varies from 5‚Äì15¬∞, with 8‚Äì10¬∞ the most common range in cold ice, and the cutting angle, , varies from 45¬∞ (the most common in cold ice) up to 90¬∞. The safety angle, between the underside of the cutting blade and the ice, can be as low as 0.8¬∞ in successful drill designs.Talalay (2012), pp. 18‚Äì19. Different shapes for the end of the blade have been tried: flat (the most common design), pointed, rounded, and scoop shaped.Talalay (2012), pp. 12‚Äì13. Cutters have to be made of extremely strong materials, and usually have to be sharpened after every 10‚Äì20 m of drilling. Tool steels containing carbon are not ideal because the carbon makes the steel brittle in temperatures below ‚àí20 ¬∞C. Sintered tungsten carbide has been suggested for use in cutters, since it is extremely hard, but the best tool steels are more cost effective: carbide cutters are fixed to the body of the cutting tool by cold pressing or brass soldering, and cannot easily be unmounted and sharpened in the field.Talalay (2012), pp. 20‚Äì21. The cutting depth is controlled by mounting shoes on the bottom of the drill head; these ride on the ice surface and so limit how deep the cutter can penetrate in each revolution of the drill. They are most commonly mounted just behind the cutters, but this position can lead to ice accumulating in the gap between the cutter and the shoe. So far it has not proved possible to correct this by modifying the shoe design.Talalay (2012), pp. 23‚Äì26.  Drilling fluids  Drilling fluids are necessary for borehole stability in deep cores, and can also be used to circulate cuttings away from the bit. Fluids used include water, ethanol/water and water/ethylene glycol mixtures, petroleum fuels, non-aromatic hydrocarbons, and n-butyl acetate. * Water is the cheapest and cleanest option; it may be present on the glacial surface or may be created by thermal drilling. In cold ice some form of antifreeze is necessary, or heat must be reapplied by reaming the hole periodically.Bentley et al. (2009), p. 293. * Ethanol and water. Ethanol acts as an anti-freeze in water; at sufficient concentrations it can reduce the freezing temperature of the mixture to well below any temperature likely to be encountered in ice drilling. The concentration must be chosen to prevent the liquid freezing and also to maintain the borehole against the ice overburden pressure. Because the density of the mixture decreases with lower temperatures, vertical convection will develop in boreholes where temperatures decrease with depth, as the lighter mixture rises. This causes slush to form in the borehole, though successful drilling is still possible.Ueda (2002), pp. 133‚Äì135.Zagorodnov et al. (1998), pp. 193‚Äì194. Ethanol is one of the cheapest options for a drilling fluid, and requires less storage space than other options because in use it is diluted with water. A Soviet expedition left an 800 m borehole in Antarctica filled with ethanol and water at an ice temperature of ‚àí53 ¬∞C; after 11 months the borehole remained open and drilling was resumed with no problems. A problem with this option is that the mixture will penetrate cores that have cracks. * Ethylene glycol and water was used at Camp Century in 1966 in the lower part of the hole to dissolve the cuttings.Bentley et al. (2009), p. 230. * Petroleum fuels. This includes diesel, jet fuel, and kerosene. They are inexpensive and easily available, and were once in common use; disadvantages include flammability and the aromatics they contain, which are a health hazard. * Non-aromatic hydrocarbons. As of 2009 these had become the most commonly used drilling fluids; eliminating the aromatics resolved the health issues with these fluids. They are significantly more expensive than untreated petroleum fuels. * n-Butyl acetate. A widely used fuel in the 1990s, because it is a close match for the density of ice, this is now unpopular because it dissolves many materials, which prevents their use in the drilling equipment it comes in contact with. It is also flammable and corrosive, and protective clothing and in some cases masks may be necessary for people exposed to it.Bentley et al. (2009), p. 294. * ESTISOL-based fluids. ESTISOL is an ester, like n-butyl acetate, but it has no health concerns.Talalay (2014), p. 342. Densifiers are used in drilling fluids to adjust the density of the fluid to match the surrounding ice. Perchloroethylene and trichloroethylene were often used in early drilling programs, in combination with petroleum fuels. These have been phased out for health reasons. Freon was a temporary replacement, but has been banned by the Montreal Protocol, as has HCFC-141b, a hydrochlorofluorocarbon densifier used once Freon was abandoned.Bentley et al. (2009), pp. 294‚Äì295. Future options for drilling fluids include low molecular weight esters, such as ethyl butyrate, n-propyl propionate, n-butyl butyrate, n-amyl butyrate and hexyl acetate; mixtures of various kinds of ESTISOL; and dimethyl siloxane oils.  Anti-torque  Leaf springs and hinged friction blades on CRREL drill used to drill at Byrd Station in Antarctica from 1966 to 1968 The two main requirements of an anti-torque system are that it should prevent rotation of the sonde, and it should allow easy movement of the drill up and down the borehole.Talalay et al. (2014), p. 211. Attempts have been made to design drills with counter-rotating components so that overall torque is minimized, but these have had limited success.Wehrle (1985), pp. 196‚Äì198. Five kinds of anti-torque systems have been devised for use with cable- suspended EM drills, though not all are in current use, and some drills have used a combination of more than one design. The first drill to require an anti-torque system was used at Camp Century by CRREL in 1966; the drill incorporated a set of hinged friction blades that swung out from the sonde when the drill motor was started. These were found to have very weak friction against the borehole wall, and were ineffective; the drill had to be controlled carefully to prevent twisting the cable. No other drills have attempted to use this approach.Talalay et al. (2014), p. 207. For the next deployment of the drill leaf springs were installed, and this has proved to be a more durable design. These are mounted vertically, with a curve outwards so that they are easily compressed by the borehole wall, and can slide up and down with the movement of the drill. They pass easily through any areas of irregularity in the borehole, but the edges of the springs cut into the borehole wall and prevent rotation. Leaf springs are very simple mechanically, with the additional benefit of being easy to adjust by changing the spacing between the end points. They can be placed anywhere on the drill that does not rotate, so they do not add length to the sonde.Talalay et al. (2014), pp. 208‚Äì209. The shape is usually a fourth-order parabola, since this has been determined to provide the most even loading against the borehole wall.Reeh (1984), pp. 69‚Äì72. Leaf springs have been found to be so effective that they can prevent rotation even in heavy drills running at full power. Skate antitorque systems have blades attached to vertical bars which are pushed against the borehole wall; the blades dig into the wall and provide the anti- torque. Skates can be built with springs which allow them to keep the blades pressed against the wall in an irregular borehole, and to prevent problems in narrower parts of the borehole. Although skates are a popular design for anti- torque and have been used with success, they have difficulty preventing rotation in firn and at boundaries between layers of different densities, and can cause problems when drilling with high torque. When they fail, they act as reamers, removing chips from the wall which can fall to the drillbit and interfere with drilling.Talalay et al. (2014), pp. 209‚Äì210. upright=3 In the 1970s, the Japanese Antarctic Research Expedition (JARE) group designed several drills using side-mill cutters. These are toothed gears that are driven from the rotation of the main drill motor via 45¬∞ spiral gears; their axis of rotation is horizontal, and they are placed so that the teeth cut four vertical slots in the borehole wall. Guide fins higher on the sonde travel in these slots and provide the antitorque. The design was effective at preventing rotation of the sonde, but it proved to be almost impossible to realign the guide fins with the existing slots when tripping in. Misalignment increased the chance of the drill getting stuck in the borehole; and there was also a risk of ice cuttings from the mill cutters jamming in between the drill and the borehole wall, causing the drill to get stuck. The system was used again in a drill developed in China in the 1980s and 1990s, but the problems inherent in the design are now considered insuperable and it is no longer in use.Talalay et al. (2014), p. 210.Talalay (2016), p. 146. The most recent anti-torque system design is the use of U-shaped blades, made of steel and fixed vertically to the sides of the sonde. Initial implementations ran into problems with thin blades bending too easily, and thick blades providing too much resistance to vertical movement of the sonde, but the final design can generate strong resistance to torque in both firn and ice.Talalay et al. (2014), pp. 210‚Äì211. Drills may be designed with more than one anti-torque system in order to take advantage of the different performance of the different designs in different kinds of snow and ice. For example, a drill may have skates to be used in hard firn or ice, but also have a leaf-spring system, which will be more effective in soft firn.  Breaking and retaining cores  upright=1.5 In ice core drilling, when an annulus has been drilled around the core to be retrieved, the core is still attached to the ice sheet at its lower end, and this connection has to be broken before the core can be retrieved. One option is to use a collet, which is a tapered ring inside the cutting head. When the drill is pulled up, the collet compresses the core and holds it, with loose ice chips wedged in it increasing the compression. This breaks the core and holds it in the barrel once it has broken. Collets are effective in firn but less so in ice, so core dogs, also known as core catchers, are often used for ice cores. A typical ice drill core dog has a dog-leg shape, and will be built into the drill head with the ability to rotate, and with a spring supplying some pressure against the core. When the drill is lifted, the sharp point of the core dog engages and rotates around, causing the core to break. Some core dogs have a shoulder to stop them from over-rotating.Talalay (2012), pp. 28‚Äì29. Most drill heads have three core dogs, though having only two core dogs is possible; the asymmetric shearing force helps break the core. The angle, , between the core dog point and the core, has been the subject of some investigation; a study in 1984 concluded that the optimum angle was 55¬∞, and a later study concluded that the angle should be closer to 80¬∞.Talalay (2012), pp. 29‚Äì30. Core catchers are made from hardened steel, and need to be as sharp as possible. The force required to break the core varies with temperature and depth, and in warm ice the core dogs may gouge grooves up the core before they catch and it breaks.Talalay (2012), pp. 31‚Äì32. Some drills may also include a weight that can be used as a hammer, to provide an impact to help in breaking the core. For snow and firn, where the core material may be at risk of falling out of the bottom of the core barrel, a basket catcher is a better choice. These catchers consist of spring wires or thin pieces of sheet metal, placed radially around the bottom of the core barrel and pressed against the side of the barrel by the core as the drill descends around it. When the drill is lifted, the ends of the catcher engage with the core and break it from the base, and act as a basket to hold it in place while it is brought to the surface.Talalay (2012), p. 35.  Casing  Casing, or lining a hole with a tube, is necessary whenever drilling operations require that the borehole be isolated from the surrounding permeable snow and firn. Uncased holes can be drilled with fluid by using a hose lowered into the hole, but this is likely to lead to increased drilling fluid consumption and environmental contamination from leaks. Steel casing was used in the 1970s, but rust from the casing caused damage to the drills, and the casing was not sealed, leading to fluid leaks. There were also problems with the casing tubes not being centered, which caused damage to the drill bit as it was lowered through the casing. Fibreglass and HDPE casing has become more common, with junctions sealed with PTFE tape, but leaks are frequent. Heat fusion welding for HDPE casing is a possible solution. To seal the bottom of the casing, water can be pumped to the bottom of the hole once the casing is set, or a thermal head can be used to melt ice around the casing shoe, creating a seal when the water freezes again. Another approach is to use a hotpoint drill, saturating the snow and firn with melted water, which will then freeze and seal the borehole.Talalay (2014), p. 341. Low-temperature PVC tubing is not suitable for permanent casing, since it cannot be sealed at the bottom, but it can be used to pass drilling fluid through the permeable zone. Its advantage is that it requires no connections since it can be coiled on a reel for deployment.

He is the former leader of the Nationalist Party from September 2017 till October 2020. Early life Adrian Delia grew up in Birkirkara. He received his formation from the Jesuit St Aloysius' College. He graduated as a lawyer from the University of Malta in 1993. Professional life Delia started out in the Legal Office of Mid-Med Bank, a bank later acquired by HSBC and branded as HSBC Malta. Delia founded his legal firm Aequitas Legal. He acted as Director and Company Secretary of Erste Bank Malta. Involvement in football Delia was elected as vice-president of Birkirkara F.C. in June 2011, while also representing the club in the council of the Malta Football Association. He then was president of Birkirkara from 29 May 2015 till 29 June 2017 following his announcement that he would be taking an active role in politics. Under the presidency of Delia the club achieved the first qualification in the third qualifying round in the UEFA Europa League in Season 2016‚Äì17. Delia famously lured in former Italian international Fabrizio Miccoli. The team won a match against West Ham United F.C., but were eliminated on penalties. After the match West Ham showed interest in Birkirkara's Mauricio Mazzetti, but Delia commented that no formal offers had been made. Involvement in politics Adrian Delia worked for Radio 101 during his student years. He was approached by Mario de Marco on behalf of the Nationalist Party (Malta) to contest the 2013 Maltese general election and 2017 Maltese general election, which he both declined for career reasons. In 2017, after the Simon Busuttil's announced departure as Leader of the Nationalist Party further to the loss in the 2017 elections, Delia was the first to contest the leadership of the party. He resigned from Birkirkara F.C. on 28 June 2017. His nomination was made official on 17 July 2017. Delia faced Chris Said, Frank Portelli and Alex Perici Calascione. In August 2018, it was reported that Adrian Delia was possibly the most popular throughout the race, as his lack of political experience was seen as an advantage. On 17 September 2017 he was confirmed as Leader of the Nationalist Party. Leader of the Nationalist Party During the beginning of his tenure, Delia started reworking the image of the Nationalist Party. In fact the team installed was no longer made up by a majority of lawyers, which was typical of the party, but instead included a sociologist, an economist, a banker and an engineer. He also reintroduced the party to the man in the street, by visiting villages and their local clubs. He took a socially conservative stance in politics in general, flagging Malta as lacking traditional moral values and national soul, and has come out against the relaxation of drug laws and liberalisation of prostitution. Delia also raised security concerns from lack of community policing where necessary. He also came out against vacation leave for homosexual women seeking IVF treatment abroad, a parliamentary motion which proved unpopular and was lost. On 16 October 2017, further to the death of Daphne Caruana Galizia, he expressed concerns over rule of law, calling the incident ‚Äúthe collapse of democracy and freedom of expression.‚Äù He called for Joseph Muscat, then Prime Minister of Malta, to assume responsibility of what happened by resigning. Delia however declined to join protests, saying it would not be appropriate for him to be present, given their past feud. On 3 February 2018, as Opposition Leader, Delia reshuffled spokespersons within the Parliamentary Group and took the shadowing of the Justice Ministry in hand. On 20 May 2018, Delia promised that a PN government, if elected, would repay the money overcharged from energy bills. Further to the conclusions of the magisterial inquiry with regards to ownership of Egrant, Delia requested that the report would be published in full, and wrote to the Advocate General to provide him with a full copy. Furthermore, Delia removed Simon Busuttil from Shadow Minister for Good Governance and asked him to resign on 22 July 2018. Delia assumed the Good Governance portfolio himself. His request was later backed by the Administrative Council of the Party. Controversy In 2017, Daphne Caruana Galizia accused Delia of links to a London-based prostitution racket. Delia denied the allegation. In a later interview, in May 2018, he promised to resign if any such activity is ever found. During the same period, in September 2017, Delia was also linked to freemasonry, a link he denied. In September 2018, several of Malta's human rights NGOs called out Delia for his comments about foreigners causing a threat to Maltese identity and values, calling them \\"abhorrent\\". The NGOs were also \\"shocked and disgusted\\", saying that by \\"using inflammatory language and calling for affirmation of the Maltese identity\\" he had \\"accused non-Maltese nationals of instilling feelings of fear and insecurity\\". In late December 2018, Delia has been accused of domestic violence, calling for him to step down from the leadership of the PN. A women's rights campaigner, Francesca Fenech Conti, has also urged Delia to resign after the domestic violence allegations. Democratic Party leader Godfrey Farrugia and former PN general secretary Rosette Thake also urged Delia to resign. Income Tax January 2018, Dr Delia had reached an agreement with the Inland Revenue Department to start settling dues dating back more than a decade. The first bill, which covered the period between 2007 and 2013, totalled ‚Ç¨81,751. It consisted of ‚Ç¨48,374 in unpaid tax, a ‚Ç¨4,604 penalty and ‚Ç¨28,773 in interest. For the period 2014 to 2017 the pending bill of income tax was ‚Ç¨64,086. Dr Delias In-Laws paid the PN leader around ‚Ç¨55,000 on 23rd March 2018 and ‚Ç¨65,000 on 20th April 2018 to settle his tax bill.

Casinos Foxwoods Casino Connecticut has two Indian casinos, Foxwoods Resort Casino in Ledyard and Mohegan Sun in Uncasville. They are operated on tribal lands under the federal Indian Gaming Regulatory Act by the state's two federally recognized tribes, the Mashantucket Pequot Tribe and the Mohegan Tribe, respectively. A third casino, to be jointly owned by the two tribes, is planned in East Windsor, but has been held up by legal proceedings. The tribes pay 25 percent of their slot machine revenue to the state, in exchange for the state maintaining its prohibition on the machines outside of the two casinos. As of the 2016-17 fiscal year, the two casinos had a total annual slot handle of $13.2 billion, with winnings of $1.1 billion. Tribal gaming began in 1986 with the opening of a high-stakes bingo parlor on the Mashantucket Pequot reservation, after a court ruled that state bingo regulations did not apply on the tribe's sovereign land. The operation expanded to include table games in 1992, and slot machines in 1993. The Mohegan Tribe, having gained federal recognition in 1992, opened its casino in 1996. Parimutuel wagering Parimutuel wagering on horse racing, greyhound racing, and jai alai is offered at sixteen off- track betting (OTB) parlors around the state operated by Sportech, and also at the two tribal casinos. The Sportech operation had a total annual handle of $168 million as of 2015, with $125 million paid out for winning bets. Two greyhound tracks and three jai alai frontons have previously operated in Connecticut. Horse racing and off-track betting were legalized in 1971. Jai alai and dog racing were added the following year. A horse track named Connecticut Park was proposed to be built in Wolcott, but was canceled in the late 1970s after failing to gain state approvals. The state's OTB operation opened for business in 1976. Jai alai frontons opened in Hartford and Bridgeport in 1976, and in Milford in 1977. The Bridgeport and Hartford frontons closed in 1995, and the Milford fronton followed in 2001. Plainfield Greyhound Park operated from 1976 to 2005 in Plainfield; Shoreline Star Greyhound Park opened at the former jai alai fronton in Bridgeport in 1996, and closed in 2005. Charitable gaming Eligible non-profit organizations are permitted to conduct several games of chance for fundraising purposes, including bingo, raffles, carnival games (referred to as bazaars) and pull- tabs (referred to as sealed tickets). As of 2015, charitable games in the state had total gross annual revenues of $32.7 million, with the organizations making a profit of $10.6 million. The law allowing charitable bingo was enacted in 1939. It was expanded to allow bazaars and raffles in 1955, and sealed tickets in 1987. Las Vegas nights, featuring casino games like blackjack and roulette, were legalized in 1972, but this was repealed in 2003 in an effort to block the opening of more tribal casinos in the state. Lottery The Connecticut Lottery offers scratchcard games and draw games, including the multi-state Powerball and Mega Millions games. As of 2015, the lottery had annual gross sales of $1.1 billion, with $707 million paid out as prizes. The legislature authorized the lottery in 1971, as part of the same bill that legalized parimutuel wagering. Lottery sales began in 1972.

The building is L-shaped with two storeys, built of stone rubble and limewashed externally. When it was first described in 1771 the Rectory was partially tiled and partially thatched, though it currently has a slate roof.

While the two stone mullioned trefoil windows are original, the other openings are 19th century. In the 1800s the building became a carriage house. During the English Civil War the Rectory's occupant, Dr Hugh Lloyd, was captured on the battlefield at the nearby Battle of St Fagans of 1648.

She served as the White House hostess during her father's administration and directed the restoration of the White House following the American Civil War.  Early life  Martha was born on October 25, 1828 in Greeneville, Tennessee, the eldest of Andrew Johnson and Eliza McCardle's five children. She attended local schools in the Greeneville, Tennessee area. While her father was serving in the U.S. House of Representatives, Martha attended Miss L.S. English's Female Seminary in Georgetown (later known as the Georgetown Female Seminary) and spent time at the White House during the term of James K. Polk.  Marriage  She married David T. Patterson, a United States Senator from Tennessee, on December 13, 1855. The couple had two children, Andrew Johnson Patterson (1857 - 1932) and Mary Belle Patterson Landstreet (1859 - 1891).  First Daughter  Martha's father, Andrew Johnson became President of the United States after the assassination of Abraham Lincoln in 1865. First Lady Eliza McCardle Johnson suffered from ill health and had little interest in social functions, so her daughter Martha took over hostess responsibilities. Eliza made only two public appearances during her tenure as First Lady. Martha was a popular figure in Washington and set a friendly tone for White House social functions. She disarmed onlookers by announcing, \\"We are plain folks from Tennessee, called here by a national calamity. I hope not much will be expected of us.\\" In keeping with her image as a country girl, Martha brought two Jersey cows to the White House. The cows pastured on the lawn and Martha milked them daily, \\"don[ning] a calico dress and a spotless apron.\\" Just before the execution of Mary Surratt, her daughter Anna came to the White House, hoping to persuade Johnson to spare her mother's life. Denied access to the president, she lay weeping on the stairs to his office and was comforted by Martha, who said there was nothing she could do to stop it. The White House had fallen into disrepair after the Civil War. Much of the furniture was dirty and broken, the walls and floors were stained with tobacco juice, and the entire house was infested with insects. Martha oversaw a $30,000 renovation of the White House. She hung new wallpaper, slipcovered for old furniture, and used muslin cloth to cover the carpets during receptions. During her remodel, Martha discovered a series of George P. A. Healy presidential portraits that were originally commissioned by Congress in 1857. Martha framed and displayed them in the Transverse Hall where they can still be seen.  Later life  Martha died on July 10, 1901.

Cook et al (2010) follow W.F. Kirby (1906) and Karny (1937) in treating Pachyrhamma as a neuter noun, and thus use a neuter suffix for the species name, i.e. waitomoense rather than waitomoensis.  Ecology and natural history  P. waitomoensis form aggregations near the entrances of caves during daytime, often in crevices or among stalactites. The juveniles are quite inactive during daylight, generally remaining still unless disturbed. Adults form pairs which mate repeatedly throughout the day, often breaking up and reforming in different combinations. Females leave the aggregations to lay their eggs, which they do by piercing their ovipositor into soft clay on ledges and in crevices within the cave. After being laid the eggs take about eight months to hatch. P. waitomoensis treading across a stream surface in Waitomo. At dusk the weta emerge from the cave, seeming more likely to do so when conditions outside are darker (less moonlight) and wetter. Outside of caves the weta scavenge on and amongst plants, searching for plant, animal and fungal material to eat. The complete life cycle from hatching to death takes approximately two years. Adults are present year- round, but most abundant from late summer to early winter. Many caves inhabited by P. waitomoensis are solutional limestone karst, with active waterways flowing through them. The weta are adept at navigating within this environment and can even tread across the surface of water without sinking.

He is known as leader of the Flatters expedition, an ill-fated attempt to explore the route of a proposed Trans-Saharan railway from Algeria to the Sudan. Almost all members of the expedition were massacred by hostile Tuaregs. The survivors resorted to eating grass and to cannibalism on the long retreat through the desert. After a brief outburst of public indignation the fiasco was forgotten. Background and early years (1832‚Äì53) Paul-Fran√ßois-Xavier Flatters was the son of Jean-Jacques Flatters (1786‚Äì1845) and √âmilie-Dirc√©e Lebon. His father came from Westphalia to Paris to study sculpture and painting. He was a student of Jean-Antoine Houdon and Jacques-Louis David, and was second in the Prix de Rome for sculpture in 1813. He served in the French army from February to July 1814 at the close of the First French Empire. During the Bourbon Restoration Jean-Jacques Flatters earned a living by making busts of famous people such as Goethe and Byron. Paul Flatters' maternal grandfather, Simon Lebon, joined the National Guard in 1792 during the French Revolution and served in the army until retiring as a colonel on half pay in December 1815. He married into a leading family of the Naples aristocracy in 1807. His daughter, √âmile-Dirc√©e Lebon married Jean-Jacques Flatters in 1830. Turenne by Jean-Jacques Flatters Paul Flatters was born in Paris on 16 September 1832. In 1845, when he was just thirteen, he lost his father. A patron and friend of the family, Baron Isidore Taylor, paid for his education in the Lyc√©e de Laval in Laval, Mayenne. Paul's mother died in 1850. He was admitted to the √âcole sp√©ciale militaire de Saint-Cyr in 1851. Flatters graduated from Saint-Cyr in October 1853, ranked 65th out of 230 students. Algerian administration (1853‚Äì80) Flatters was made a second lieutenant and posted to Algeria with the 3rd Zouaves. He was appointed lieutenant in 1855. In 1856 he was granted a request to transfer to the Arab Bureaus (bureaux arabes), which had been created by Marshal Thomas Robert Bugeaud to administer the indigenous population. Flatters did not serve in the Crimean War of 1853‚Äì56 or the Franco-Austrian War of 1859. In January 1863 he spent three month's leave in Paris. There he met and became engaged to the 19 year old Sara-Marie Le Gros, sister of a former schoolmate at Laval. Flatters was promoted to captain in 1864. He married Sarah Marie Legros (1845‚Äì1933) in Paris on 1 May 1864. Their son √âtienne Paul Jean Flatters (1868‚Äì1950) would become a Brigadier General. Due to the rough conditions in Algeria his wife could not accompany him when he returned to Algeria, and for the next fifteen years they spent time together only when he was on leave or during the short periods when he was stationed in France. Flatters learned to read classical Arabic and to speak the local vernacular form, and became interested in local history and culture, although his scholarship was always superficial. He published Histoire ancienne du Nord de l'Afrique avant le conqu√™te des Arabes in 1863 for an Arab audience. The book asserted that North Africa was a Berber country to which both Islam and Arabs were alien newcomers. The governor general approved, and ordered the book to be distributed to all the Berbers of the Kabylie. In 1865 he published a revised version of the book for a European audience, Histoire de la g√©ographies et g√©ology de le province de Constantine. Flatters served in the Franco-Prussian War of 1870, but was taken prisoner almost at once and transferred to Germany. He was in Paris in April‚ÄìMay 1871 when the Paris Commune was suppressed. In 1871 responsibility for administration in the departments of Constantine, Algiers and Oran was transferred to civilians, but the army continued to administer the interior of Algeria. In 1871 Flatters was promoted to major. He was based at Laghouat and worked on administrative tasks. In 1876 and 1877 Flatters wrote three reports on the caravan trade between the Sudan and the Mediterranean, blaming some of the problems on the Senussi Sufi order and tribe. The reports show that Flatters was fully aware that any European who ventured into the desert without strong protection would almost inevitably be killed. He also observed that the Turks and the merchants of Tripoli, Ghadames, Ghat and Murzuk would be opposed to a Trans-Saharan railway that would divert trade to Algeria. He cast doubt on whether France would benefit from such a railway when the British were supplying much cheaper trade goods. Writing from Laghouat in the spring of 1877 Flatters noted that the Saharan trade was still mainly one of slaves. Many went to other parts of the Maghreb, but Flatters said that 1,000 were brought to Algeria each year. Due to French abolition of slavery, the merchants in the Sahara would not allow a French presence in the desert. Flatters argued that the French should therefore tolerate and regulate the trade in slaves, which was inevitable, so as to gain access to the interior. In 1879 he published a long article in the Revue historique titled √âtude sur l'Afrique septentrionale des origines √† l'invasion arabe. On 3 May 1879 he was promoted to lieutenant-colonel and returned to France. First expedition (1879‚Äì80) The Trans-Saharan expedition was appointed in 1879 by Charles de Freycinet, Minister of Public Works, to investigate construction of a railway across the Sahara. Three possible routes starting from Oran in the west, Algiers in the center and Constantine in the east were to be examined by three expeditions. The western expedition was led by the engineer Justin Pouyanne. The central one was led by the engineer Auguste Choisy and included Georges Rolland. These two expeditions would complete their work without difficulty. The eastern route was considered the most dangerous, going via the Hoggar Tuareg town of Rhat. Flatters lobbied in Paris to be chosen as leader of this mission. At the age of 48 he was relatively old to lead the expedition. He suffered from sciatica and depended on morphine to relieve his pain, and had unpredictable moods. Flatters originally proposed a major expedition with more than 200 tirailleurs to provide strong protection, and was supported in this by the military members of the commission. He was opposed by Henri Duveyrier, who had experience of army blundering and was convinced that only small and unobtrusive expeditions whose members adapted to local customs could succeed. The mid-19th century explorer Duveyrier had developed a romantic view of the Tuaregs as peace-loving, honorable people. In fact they were ruthless in dealing with intruders into their land using whatever methods they saw fit. Duveyrier was supported by Ferdinand de Lesseps of Suez Canal fame and other civilian members. A compromise was agreed where the size of the expedition was cut in half, making it a target without adequate means of defense. The Flatter expedition crosses a marsh. Chocolats Lombart trading card Flatters returned to Algeria in November 1879, charged with reconnoitering the route that he had himself said was the most favorable for the proposed railway. He left Constantine on 25 January 1880 with 12 Europeans supported by Algerian tirailleurs, cameleers and Chaamba guides. The future Islamologist Alfred Le Ch√¢telier was an assistant topographer. The caravan travelled south to Ouargla. Flatters left from Ouargla on 5 March 1880 with thirty-nine people. They traveled south through the Igharghar valley past A√Øn Ta√Øba, El-Bodh and Timassinin. From Timassinin the expedition headed southeast along the Igharghar valley, and on 16 April 1880 encamped on shores of Lake Menghough on the fringe of the Tuareg of the Ajjer country. With provisions running short and the local people showing hostility, Flatters decided to return by the same route. The French began their retreat northward on the morning of 21 April 1880. Captain Masson was given the rearguard with orders to \\"die to the last man if need be so the convoy can get away\\". In fact the Tuareg did little to harass the column. Pressed by Masson, who thought it necessary to save the expedition, on 27 April 1880 Flatters sent a letter to the Amenoukal of the Ahaggar Tuareg in which he promised to return the next winter. The expedition returned intact to Ouargla on 17 May 1880 with valuable information about the country. The valley of the Igharghar river offered a promising route to the Niger River. Second expedition (1880‚Äì81) Advance Flatters quickly returned to Paris to raise support for a second expedition. He received a less enthusiastic reception than with the first expedition, and some of the officers from the first expedition chose not to accompany him on the second attempt. Leaders of the expedition included Flatters, the civil engineers Beringer and Roche, Captain Masson of the artillery corps and Dr. Guiard, all of whom had served on the first expedition. Other members were Lieutenant de Dianous and the civil engineer Santin, who replaced the infantry second lieutenants Le Chatelier and Brosselard of the first expedition. There were also two French staff soldiers, Brame and Marjollet, 47 Algerian sharpshooters, 31 Arab volunteers who had formerly served in the army, 7 Chaamba guides and a Muslim mullah of the Tedjini order. The second expedition of 93 men left Ouargla on 4 December 1880 and traveled south by a road west of that taken by the first expedition. It went up the Wadi Mia to Inifel, then along the Wadi Insokki to the Insokki well. From there it went southeast by Messeguem, bypassing the Tademait plateau in Amguid. After three months of travel through the desert the expedition reached Sebka. This is the most southern point reached by the Romans, and the expedition saw the ruins of a monument raised by General Cornelius Balbo in 44 BC. The expedition went on from Sebkha, heading towards Asiou, an important point in the central Sahara from which Flatters hoped to reach the Sudan without difficulty. On 16 February 1881 the expedition stopped at Bir el-Garama about north of Asiou. The site is near today's city of Tamanrasset. Massacre H. Brosselard, member of the 1st expedition Before the expedition left Ouargla plans had been made to destroy it by the Kel Ahaggar Tuaregs of the Hoggar Mountains, the Awlad Sidi Shaykh confederation and the Senussi. They knew the planned route and were kept informed by the expedition's guides, who helped sabotage the expedition by leading it past wells. Six hundred men of the three tribes gathered to ambush the expedition near Bir el-Garama. Tuaregs had been shadowing the expedition for several days when it approached the wells of Bir- el-Gharama. However Flatters considered that Ahitagel ag Muhammad Biska, the Amenukal of the Kel Ahaggar, completely controlled the area and would ensure that no French were harmed in his land. Near In-Uhawen, or the wells of Tadjenout, Flatters left his baggage in camp with half his troops while he and his officers and scientific staff went to find the well, followed by the camels. Flatters told a guide who warned of danger, \\"we have nothing to fear\\". Half an hour after they found the well, Flatters and his men were surrounded by a large force of Tuaregs armed with lances and muzzle-loading muskets. Some men tried to flee on the camels, but the animals refused to leave the well. Flatters, Masson, Beringer, Roche, Guiard and the expedition's commissary Deverny were killed, as were 30 camel drivers. Only ten men escaped. The Tuaregs took almost all of the 250 camels. Retreat The camp was not attacked. Lieutenant de Dianous took command. Without camels the survivors were limited in the amount they could carry. The 56 survivors, including 4 Frenchmen, were well armed against attack but had no transportation and very little water. Traveling by foot the retreat to Ouargla would take 2‚Äì3 months. They decided to leave that night after burning most of their supplies and dividing the mission's 102,000 francs between them. They also divided the food and ammunition, and gave the strongest men the skins of water to carry. They struggled back, suffering from hunger and thirst. The Touareg picked off beasts of burden and stragglers. By 22 February 1881 the survivors were almost out of food, and a few days later were eating grass. They straggled on, with the strongest going ahead in the hope of finding game. When they had lost all hope, a group of Tuaregs approached and offered to sell them milk, meat and dates at a high price. The dates turned out to be poisoned with a substance that caused dizziness and psychosis. This came from the plant called Falezlez by the Tuaregs (Hyoscyamus muticus, or Egyptian henbane). The effect was to induce a burning sensation in the victims' lungs, and to cause them to rush about madly and fire off their guns. Many of the sharpshooters and Chaamba had avoided the dates and were able to restore calm, and the poisoned men recovered after vomiting. Some of the party escaped during this incident. The retreat continued the next day. The wells at Amguid were guarded by a strong force of Tuaregs who were driven away after a fight in which de Dianous, Santin, Brame, Marjolet and 12 tirailleurs were killed. The only remaining Frenchman was the commissary Pob√©guin. The survivors broke up into small groups, each suspicious that the others were hoarding. On 23 March 1881 an Algerian tirailleur in Pob√©guin's group was shot. Several men built a large fire and cooked the \\"mutton\\" which they offered to Pob√©guin, but he refused to eat it. With all discipline gone more victims were shot and eaten, and Pob√©guin eventually joined in. He himself was killed and eaten by the end of March. Four tirailleurs reached Ouargla on 2 April 1881, and three others were picked up on the road. On 4 April 1881 the last survivors arrived at Messeguem. Towards the end of April about a dozen exhausted survivors reached Ouargla. Aftermath The first response when the news reached France was shock, followed by calls to punish the Ahaggar Tuareg and make greater efforts to colonize the Sahara. However, interest soon faded and the tragedy was forgotten. Some of the newspapers held Duveyrier partly to blame for the disaster with his opposition to military force and utterly inaccurate depiction of the \\"vicious, cruel and barbaric\\" Tuareg. Duveyrier tried to vindicate his approach by two solo expeditions into the Rif mountains in Morocco. He became increasingly disturbed by guilt and anger, and took his own life on 24 April 1892. The disaster caused plans for a railway to be abandoned. From some of the letters written by Flatters before the disaster it was possible to assemble some information on the country the expedition had travelled through. For several decades this was the main source of information on the central Sahara. There is a marble column with a bronze plaque commemorating the Flatters Expedition in the Parc Montsouris in the 14th arrondissement of Paris. Another memorial was erected in Ouargla.

It took effect on July 1 of that year. The law was authored by Peachtree City Republican state representative Matt Ramsey, and was partly based on Arizona's SB 1070 bill that had passed the previous year. Sponsors In the Georgia House of Representatives, HB 87 was co-sponsored by Matt Ramsey, Rich Golick, Katie M. Dempsey, Rick Austin, Stephen Allison, and Ed Lindsey. In the Georgia State Senate, it was sponsored by Bill Hamrick. Provisions HB 87 requires businesses in Georgia with more than 10 employees to use E-Verify to verify that prospective employees are eligible to work in the United States legally. The bill allows police in the state to attempt to determine the immigration status of some suspects. It also makes the intentional transportation of undocumented immigrants while a crime is being committed punishable by a fine of up to $1,000 and a prison sentence of up to a year. In addition, it punishes undocumented workers convicted of using fake identification to gain employment with up to 15 years in prison and up to a $250,000 fine. Similarity to Arizona's SB 1070 Commentators noted that HB 87 was similar to other anti-illegal immigration laws that had recently been passed in other U.S. states, such as Arizona SB 1070. Some of HB 87's critics dubbed it a \\"copycat\\" of SB 1070, a claim that PolitiFact rated \\"half true\\" because, although the two laws are similar, the authors of HB 87 tried to address concerns about the constitutionality of such legislation. For instance, HB 87 merely allows police to check the immigration status of suspects, whereas SB 1070 required them to do so. Reactions When HB 87 was signed into law, it was widely described as one of the toughest such laws in the country. Multiple organizations, including the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) and the Southern Poverty Law Center (SPLC), also publicly raised the possibility of suing Georgia over the law. The bill was also criticized by the leaders of the Leadership Conference on Civil and Human Rights and the Georgia Latino Alliance for Human Rights. The government of Mexico also criticized Deal for signing the bill into law, saying in a statement that \\"The legislators and state executive ignored the many contributions of the immigrant community to the economy and society of Georgia.\\" Some critics, including Azadeh N. Shahshahani and Wade Henderson, criticized the bill on the basis that it would invite racial profiling of Latinos and other people of color. Other critics also criticized the law because they thought it would adversely effect trust in the police among immigrants. Supporters of the bill generally argued that it would benefit Georgia taxpayers by reducing the economic burdens associated with providing for undocumented immigrants in the state. Support for the bill came from conservative groups that support strict immigration laws, including Americans for Immigration Control, whose spokesman, Phil Kent, said that the bill was about protecting taxpayers from the costs of illegal immigration. Kent told CNN that \\"We just want to make sure that people are welcome here and that they come here legally. And then we can cut back on the illegal immigration.\\" The bill was also supported by Mark Krikorian of the Center for Immigration Studies, who said that in passing it, Georgia \\"...seems to have addressed the top-priority matters a state can deal with,\\" and by Catherine Davis, legislative director for the Network of Politically Active Christians, who told the Atlanta Journal-Constitution that the bill \\"will stop unscrupulous behavior.\\" Effects HB 87 has since been criticized for allegedly having a negative impact on Georgia's economy, especially in the agricultural sector, because it decreased the number of undocumented workers who were available to work on farms in Georgia. A 2011 University of Georgia study showed that after the law, Georgia experienced a labor shortage of over 5,000 farm workers, which resulted in $140 million in crop losses. Similarly, according to the 2012 Georgia Ag Forecast, Georgia experienced an agricultural labor shortage of almost 50% after HB 87 was passed. An Atlanta Journal- Constitution survey, also conducted in 2011, estimated that farmers in Georgia would be short by about 11,000 workers during the upcoming season. When Jason Carter was running for governor of Georgia in the 2014 election, he criticized Deal for signing the law, saying that it had resulted in an \\"economic disaster\\" for the state and noting that he had voted against it in the state legislature. Deal responded that Georgians believed it was important to enforce the law, and that the bill had served to remind the federal government how important it was to address the issue of undocumented immigration. Some researchers have also expressed concern that the law may adversely affect public health among Hispanic immigrants in Georgia. For instance, a 2013 study found that visits to the pediatric emergency department among Hispanics in Georgia decreased after the law was implemented, while the acuity of these visits tended to increase; in contrast, no other group in Georgia saw these trends during the same time period. Protests Prior to Governor Deal signing HB 87 into law, numerous protesters gathered outside his office at the Georgia State Capitol, and the group Southerners on New Ground called for a boycott of the state if the bill was enacted. On July 2, 2011, a rally took place outside the State Capitol to protest the law; the size of the crowd was estimated at between 8,000 and 14,000. Legal challenges On June 2, 2011, the ACLU, the SPLC, the Asian Law Caucus, and the National Immigration Law Center filed a lawsuit challenging HB 87, arguing that it was preempted by federal law and was unconstitutional. In March 2013, the United States Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit issued a permanent injunction which blocked multiple provisions of the law, including section 7, which made it illegal to transport or harbor undocumented immigrants while they were committing another crime.

Together with the two other lakes, Pedersborg Lake and Tuel Lake, it is collectively known as the Sor√∏ Lakes. They drain into the Sus√• River. Sor√∏ Lake is owned by Sor√∏ Academy, a centuries-old educational institution that stands on its northeastern shores. A tour boat operates on the lake in the summer time. It is also a popular venue for a wide range of recreational activities, including, sailing, rowing, kayaking, fishing and swimming. Geography The lake consists of a rounded southern part and a long, narrow section, Smalles√∏ (Narrow Lake), which extends north and finally becomes a canal that flows into Pedersborg Lake from where water continues to Tuel Lake and then through Tuel √Ö to the Sus√• River. It has a total area of 210 hectares and a maximum depth of 12.9 metres. It is a kettle hole and only fed by two minor streams. History Sor√∏ Lake in the 18th century Sor√∏ Abbey and the town of Sor√∏ was built on what was almost an island in a single lake. Lake Sor√∏ and Lake Pederborg when an embankment with a new road to Slagelse was built in the beginning of the 19th century. Thuels√∏ was separated from the two other lakes when the area now known as Flommen was drained and water levels in the lake was lowered. Sor√∏ Lake was a popular destination for excursions already from the 19th century, especially the Parnas Pavilion on a small hillat the southwestern corner of the lake. It later developed into one of the largest entertainment venues on Zealand with room for 1,200 dining guests and entertainment by artists such as Kai Normann Andersen, Liva Weel and Osvald Helmuth. A small ferry operated on the lake from 1872, transporting passengers back and forth between the railway station and the town centre or Kongebroen. Surroundings Town and landmarks Sor√∏ Academy's main building The town of Sor√∏, with Sor√∏ Academy, Is located on the northeastern shores of the lake. The academy's campus area features a number of historic buildings, including Sor√∏ Abbey Church. Parnas Park opened at the former site of the Parnua pavilion in 2015. Parnas Hus plays host to parties and other events. The park also comprises various outdoor activities. Feldskovpavillonen is a small thatched building with exposed timber framing. It was built in about 1840 by Etatsr√•d Povelsen and has been frequented by cultural figures such as B.S. Ingemann and Hans Christian Andersen and many others. √Ügir at the northwestern corner of the lake is a former residence for a forest worker where it was also possible to have tea. St√∏vlet Katrines Hus was originally built for Christian IV's mistress St√∏vlet Cahtrine. It is now operated as a high-end restaurant. Nature It is surrounded by woodland and green corridors along the shoreline on most of the other sides. Grydebjerg Eood is situated on the west side of the lake. S√∏nderskov is located to the southeast of the lake, adjoining Flommen on the east side of the lake is grazed by cattle and horses. Activities Sailing and rowing Sor√∏ Roklub, a rowing lub, is located at the lake. Boat tours The tour boat Lille Claus has been operating on the lake in the summer time since 1997. It has room for 60 passengers. Fishing The lake is particularly known for its carp fishing. The carps in the lake weights up to 15 hg. Other fish in the lake include pike, zander and perch. Local sports fishers are organized in Sor√∏ Lystfisker Forening. Bathing Bathing is mainly done from Skjolden on the east side of the narrow Smalles√∏ section of the lake.

Braulio is amaro delle Alpi and a type of Valtelline herbal amaro. It is a digestif typically served cold or at room temperature, though it is also occasionally served as an aperitif with sparkling white wine.  History  The original recipe dates to 1826, conceived by Francesco Peroni, a pharmacist and botanist of Bormio who studied the beneficial properties of various local herbs. Production of Braulio began in 1875. Since 1999, the amaro has been a property of Casoni Liquori S.p.A., a company based in Finale Emilia (Modena), although production continues at the Peroni family farms in Bormio. The trademark is held by Fratelli Averna S.p.A., acquired in 2014 by the Campari Group.  Production  The main ingredients of Braulio are medicinal herbs, fruits, roots and berries that, at least originally, were collected on the slopes of the Braulio Valley. The liqueur is aged for two years in casks of Slavonian oak. Another reserve named the Braulio Reserve is aged for three years and produced in very limited quantities.

Mobile Mail-Screening Stations are operated by the United States Postal Inspection Service. Description The Mobile Mail- Screening Station was designed by the United States Postal Services' Technical Services Division. Each unit is a tractor and trailer combination containing eight compartmentalized areas that house specialized mail screening equipment. This includes: the GID-3 ambient air monitoring system for the detection of industrial toxins and chemical warfare agents, the HI-SCAN 7555i X-ray Inspection System to scan packages and letters for the presence of improvised explosive devices (IEDs), Smiths Detection HazMatID for the identification of \\"unknown powders, liquids, pastes and gels\\" and the SABRE FR air filtration table for the detection of toxic industrial chemicals. A fully deployed Mobile Mail-Screening Station is operated by a staff of five to eight people.

In the 1975, the Hare Krishnas purchased the building for $1,000,000 and called 340 West 55th their \\"Skyscraper temple\\", amenities included a theater, gift shop, museum, soup kitchen and a hotel, with hundreds of followers living communally in the upper floors. In 1977, Swami Prabhupada died, and soon thereafter, the Krishnas were troubled with financial difficulties. In 1981 local leadership decided to sell the Manhattan property. In 1982, the building was transformed into co-op apartments, as it is known today. Architecture The Sherwood blends stone, brick and Venetian-style balconies to make it a unique gem on this quiet block. Its relatively simple architecture is rock-solid secure, a reassuring beacon of civilized urban architecture. Its great gray stone base is only one-and-a-half stories high. The George Washington Stone Company built the foundation and base. Detailed carving rest atop the two columns at its canopied entrance with a scalloped band-course above its second floor which is not highlighted by its color, The red tiles of a mid-level setback on the eastern portion of the fa√ßade are not pronounced but echo the band-course one floor below. Its angled west wing is sophisticated and subtle and scarcely noticeable. The bright pink stone window surrounds and the corner quoins on the western end of the second floor are somewhat muted by the seven columned curved rock balconies beneath the windows. The building's west wing has a Venetian-style loggia with seven slender arches on the 9th floor beneath a setback terrace. The naturalistic, low relief ornament motifs that run along its gray stone base was produced by the architectural sculptors Ulysses Ricci and John De Cesare. Fruits, animals and twisting vines can be discerned, as well as a bible centered above the entrance, the symbol of the National Bible Institute. These stylized elements sit somewhere between medieval revival and Art Deco. Notable residents * Philip Baloun - Party Planner & Special Events Designer * A. C.

They are a large, flightless, nocturnal orthopteran endemic to New Zealand. Mountain stone wƒìtƒÅ are long lived and are found on many central mountain ranges in New Zealand's South Island. __TOC__  Taxonomy  Hemideina maori was first described in 1891 by Swiss Entomologists Alphonse Pictet and Henri de Saussure.  Habitat and Distribution  Unlike other Hemideina species H. maori occupy an alpine habitat. They are found at high elevation (above the tree line) of the South Island of New Zealand. They have been found above 1500 metres above sea level (m.a.s.l) with a lower limit of 1100m.a.s.l, from the Kaikoura Ranges south to the Rock and Pillar range in Otago. They use cavities under rock slabs ('tors') broken from schist outcrops as retreats during the day. Tors are separated by alpine meadows with no rocks and therefore are assumed to have no wƒìtƒÅ, causing population fragmentation. The mountain wƒìtƒÅ do not move far during their life time, and are exposed to high winds and low temperatures all year round.  Diet  Studies of mountain stone wƒìtƒÅ frass have found that their diet may consists of many plant species and few invertebrate species. All plant species preferred by H. maori have a higher than average lipid content. There are few published studies of the diet of H. maori or of the intraspecific variation in their diet. It is however known that they are omnivorous, feeding on plants and live and decaying matter.  Morphology  alt= H. maori are a large wƒìtƒÅ with a body length of approximately 6cm. The length of the male and female tibia do not differ (mean of tibia length = 18.6 +/- 0.17 mm for each sex). Both males and females have directional asymmetry in mandible length with the left mandible being longer than the right (Males: median 0.53mm, range: 0.01 to 1.37mm, n=48. Females: median 0.49mm, range 0 to 1.21mm, n= 35). Males can show extreme dimorphism in weaponry that appears to be a result of sexual selection of male-male combat for access to females. These males have mandibles that tend to be two times longer and their head can be up to 1.5 times wider than those of females with a similar tibia length.  Body Colour  A hybrid zone between the two colour forms (melanic and yellow) of Hemideina maori has been studied in the Rock and Pillar mountain range and. It was found that both the black and yellow lineages in the Rock and Pillar range do not form a monophyletic group suggesting that H. maori exhibited a colour polymorphism before the separation of the two Rock and Pillar lineages occurred. Physiology  Adaptation to Montane Environment  Cuticular water loss (CWL) and respiratory water loss (RWL) were found to be reduced in montane wƒìtƒÅ compared to lowland wƒìtƒÅ, suggesting that montane Hemideina have an increased desiccation resistance via decreased water loss. It was also found that the black colour morphs lost less total water than yellow colour morphs driven by a decrease in CWL in the black morphs.  Freeze Tolerance  Frozen mountain stone wƒìtƒÅ in the Southern Alps, New Zealand Mountain stone wƒìtƒÅ can survive being frozen solid over winter and are estimated to be inactive for at least 5 months of the year. During winter H. maori are often immobile with ice crystals on their cuticle, when touched the individuals appear to be frozen solid on warm days however, they can be found thawed and active under rocks. While the wƒìtƒÅ are immobile they are in a state of suspended animation, they can survive up to 17 days in temperatures of about -10 ¬∞C. At temperatures below -10 ¬∞C, approximately 85% of their body water is crystallized, one of the highest ice contents known for any animal. During winter, their haemolymph contains low molecular weight cryoprotectants such as amino acids, especially proline (up to about 100 mM) and the disaccharide trehalose. These substances are synthesised during autumn and their concentration decreases again during spring and summer (proline concentration decreases to about 10 mM during summer). The amino acids and sugars presumably help to decrease the ice content colligatively; however, they probably also have a direct protective effect on membranes and proteins via direct interaction or by modifying the water layer with the closest proximity to the molecules. Behaviour Unlike other Hemideina species, H. maori is a species of tree wƒìtƒÅ, which spends most of its time in tors on the ground. Just like other tree wƒìtƒÅ species however, H. maori leave their refuges at night to forage and oviposit in soil. To defend against predators, mountain stone wƒìtƒÅ will often \\"play dead\\". They lie still for a short time on their back, with legs splayed, claws exposed and jaws wide open ready to scratch and bite. This behaviour is often accompanied with regurgitation when grabbed by a predator which can act as an irritant or toxin.  Predators  Morepork (ruru), native nocturnal bird and potential predator to the mountain stone wƒìtƒÅ Potential mammalian predators of the mountain stone wƒìtƒÅ appear to be present in either very low numbers or not at all at elevations above 1100 m.a.s.l, suggesting that rats, possums, cats and other potential mammalian predators have not dispersed into this area in large numbers. This means that native nocturnal predators of the mountain stone wƒìtƒÅ are most likely to be reptiles such as geckos and skinks or birds such as ruru (morepork).  Breeding  Mountain stone wƒìtƒÅ have a several year life cycle, they may take at least 4 years to reach sexual maturity with some individuals surviving at least 4 breeding seasons. The H. maori mating season tends to end before the alpine cold period, (autumn is March & April in the southern hemisphere) this is a time when the days are cold and the wƒìtƒÅ are inactive in their rock refuges. Males cohabit with many females, (up to seven females with a single male) males that live with a large number of females have a higher chance of mating success. Adult males have larger heads and elongated mandibles compared to adult females (secondary sexual dimorphism). H. maori have a harem- polygynous mating system, copulation tends to occur within their rock refuges with the ability to quickly mate with any female who returns to the retreat. Males use their large mandibles in male-male fights for access to harems. To copulate males move alongside females making their attennal in contact with her, they then curve their abdomen towards the females terminalia. Copulation tends to last for a mean of 3.1 minutes.  Conservation Status  Populations of this widespread species are found on most ranges on the Southern Alps and therefore it is not considered to be at risk of extinction. A mark-recapture study conducted by Leisnham et al where 480 adult mountain stone wƒìtƒÅ were marked, over the period of three field seasons (between November 1997 and April 2000) 72% of marked individuals (n = 229) were recaptured at least once.

This wƒìtƒÅ species is endemic to New Zealand and populates regions in the southern half of North Island/Te Ika a Maui and the north-west of the South Island/Te Wai Pounamu. They forage arboreally during the night and are most likely polyphagous. There is obvious sexual dimorphism in adults. Individuals are reliant on tree cavities for refuge, social interactions and mating. The conservation status of H. crassidens is \\"not threatened\\".  Distribution and habitat  Hemideina crassidens is endemic to New Zealand. Populations are distributed between the Ruapehu district and Wellington district of the North Island, and in the Westland district of the South Island. A closely related native tree wƒìtƒÅ, Hemideina thoracica, is widely distributed in the northern two-thirds of the North Island New Zealand. It has been suggested that H thoracica competitively excludes H. crassidens from warmer northern regions of the North Island. On Mt Taranaki, H. crassidens is found only at elevations above ~700 m asl, and H. thoracica is found lower down the slopes where temperatures are slightly warmer. Hemideina crassidens is a nocturnal and arboreal. This species uses holes in tree branches to hide during the day.They usually live in tree holes, suggesting a reliance on forest. However, many extant tree wƒìtƒÅ populations occupy scrub habitats or even use rock refuges when trees are not available.  Climate change  In the central North Island populations of H. crassidens have become isolated within areas mostly populated by H. thoracica suggesting previous range contraction due to interactions with competitors and the environment. This contraction is likely to continue southwards during global warming, resulting in the displacement of H. crassidens from many lowland areas of central and southern North Island.  Diet  Being a tree wƒìtƒÅ, H. crassidens spend most of their time foraging arboreally. They are generally herbivorous, feeding on the leaves, fruit and flowers of a wide range of trees and shrubs. However, polyphagy is common among wƒìtƒÅ species and it is likely that H. crassidens supplement their diet with animal matter. Individuals have been documented feeding on living or recently dead invertebrates.  Morphology  alt= Hemideina crassidens are relatively large at maturity (> 6.5 cm body length). Their bodies are smooth and shiny, the abdomen is ringed with bands contrasting bands of dark brownish to black and yellow, with a pale underside. This colouration is reminiscent of uniform of the Wellington rugby team, the Hurricanes, and can be used to distinguish it from the Auckland tree wƒìtƒÅ (Hemideina thoracica). They have heavily spined hind tibiae that are used in defence postures.Ordish, R.G. (1992) Aggregation and communication of the Wellington weta Hemideina crassidens (Blanchard) (Orthoptera: Stenopelmatidae). New Zealand Entomologist 15: 1‚Äì8. The antennae are long and mobile to help with sensing and navigation, particularly in the dark. The Wellington tree wƒìtƒÅ and the Hawkes Bay tree wƒìtƒÅ (Hemideina trewicki) look the same but have different numbers of chromosomes. In South Island H. crassidens have 19 (male) or 20 (female) chromosomes and in North Island this species has 15 or 16 chromosomes. The Hawkes Bay tree wƒìtƒÅ has 17 (male) or 18 (female) chromosomes. Sexual dimorphism Males display highly exaggerated, positively allometric mandibles. Accelerated maturation of males gives rise to three different head sizes that correlate their maturation on either the 8th, 9th or 10th instar. 8th instar males have small heads, 10th instar males have particularly elongated jaws and a large vertex and 9th instar males have an intermediate from. Females only reach maturity at the 10th instar. In this wƒìtƒÅ species, females can be identified by their small head and long ovipositor. alt= none  Galleries  Tree wƒìtƒÅ (Hemideina crassidens) form aggregations of adults in roost holes. These usually comprise just one adult male and several females. Rather than bore their own tree holes, H. crassidens inhabit natural crevices and cavities, or pre-existing tunnels that have been excavated by large wood-boring larva such as Ochroydus hutoni (Coleoptera: Cerambycidae) or Aenetus virescens (Lepidoptera: Hepoalidae). They prefer tree holes in living timber and avoid fallen or rotten logs.Field, L.H.; Sandlant, G.R.

(Ed.): The biology of wetas, king crickets and their allies. CABI Publishing, Oxon. Native trees and shrubs such manuka (Leptospermum scoparium), kanuka (Kunzea ericoides), ngaio (Myoporum laetum), kohekohe (Dysoxylum spectabile) and mahoe (Melicytus ramiflorus) are favoured by H. crassidens. Suitable galleries have a narrow entrance hole (~20mm in diameter) in order to provide protection from predators such as birds. The holes are entered head first and exited in reverse so that the spines on their hind tibiae point outwards to defend from intruders. Inhabited galleries can often be identified by the neatly nibbled entrance which is kept clean. Individuals often occupy the same gallery for an extended period of time. Galleries buffer against environmental variation, especially humidity.Field, L.H.; Sandlant, G.R. (1983) Aggression and mating behaviour in the Stenopelmatidae (Orthoptera; Ensifera), with reference to New Zealand wetas. Pp. 120‚Äì146 in Gwynne, D.T.; Morris, G.K. (Eds): Orthopteran mating systems. Sexual competition in a diverse group of insects. Westview Press, Boulder, Colorado, USA.  Breeding  Hemideina crassidens is a polygynous insect in which males guard females that reside in tree cavities termed 'galleries'. Galleries are used for breeding and males compete for control of them and access to the females within. Male head size is an indicator of combative ability as the head is used as weaponry in combat for dominance and control of a harem. In cases where the gallery is sufficiently large, multiple males can occupy a single gallery, suggesting that a dominant male defends a harem rather than a gallery per se. Males can avoid combat by facing off, opening their jaws and assessing the gape of their opponent‚Äôs mandibles. In a non-violent contest the male whose mandibles span the furthest is considered dominant. Small headed males can mate by wandering nocturnally and copulating with females outside of a gallery, or by sneaking into a gallery occupied by a dominant male and copulating with females within. A small headed male is able to control a harem within a gallery if the entrance is too small for large headed males to fit through. Most matings and ovipositions occur over the summer and autumn. Females lay their eggs vertically in the soil approximately 10mm under the surface. Hatching occurs in spring and individuals take about 18 months to become mature, reaching sexual maturity in the following summer. Hemideina crassidens do not show any parental care. Their normal lifespan is about 3 years, with about 18 months as immatures.  Conservation  The number of suitable galleries in an area is considered to be a major limiting resource of H. crassidens. The construction and distribution of artificial refuges has been suggested as a possible conservation strategy to try and increase populations of H. crassidens and H. thoracica.Bleakley C, Stringer I, Robertson A, Hedderley D (2006) Design and use of artificial refuges for monitoring adult tree weta, Hemideina crassidens and H. thoracica.

The neighborhood draws its name from Union Avenue (which bifurcates the northern part of the neighborhood), and Miles Park in its far southwest corner (originally the town square of Newburgh Village). Union‚ÄìMiles Park was originally part of Newburgh Township, which was organized in 1814. Settled by whites as an area of farms and orchards, Union‚ÄìMiles Park became one of two centers in the Cleveland steelmaking industry beginning in 1856. The steel mills drew Irish, Scottish, and Welsh immigrants to the area, with the intersection of E. 93rd Street and Union Avenue becoming known as \\"Irishtown\\". After an 1882 strike at the steel mill was broken using Polish and Slovak strikebreakers, the large Irish and Welsh communities were displaced by these two new immigrant groups. Railroads cut through many areas of Union‚ÄìMiles Park, defining the area. The steel industry in Union‚ÄìMiles Park collapsed during the Great Depression. White flight from the area in the 1960s, and a strong influx of African Americans eager to take advantage of inexpensive housing, radically changed the demographic nature of the neighborhood. Since the mid-1970s, Union‚ÄìMiles Park has been challenged by a high poverty rate, low adult educational achievement, extensive decrepit and vacant housing, high crime, and a lack of employment opportunities. Union‚ÄìMiles Park is bordered on the west by South Broadway, the northwest by Kinsman, the north by Woodland Hills, the east by Mt. Pleasant and Corlett, and the south by the city of Garfield Heights, Ohio. Geography Looking east down Woodland Avenue. The Portage Escarpment rises a hundred feet above the Erie Plain, below. Cuyahoga County is bifurcated along a northeast‚Äìsouthwest line into two distinct geographic areas. To the northwest of this line are the Till Plains of the Central Lowland physiographic section of the United States. To the southeast of this line is the Southern New York Section of the Appalachian Plateau. The Portage Escarpment forms the boundary line between these two geographic areas. In what would become Newburgh Township, the Portage Escarpment acts as a moderately high bluff or ridge extending from Doan's Corners (located roughly at the modern intersection of Euclid Avenue and E. 105th Street) southwest, south, and southwest again to the old Newburgh Village. Northwest and west of the ridge, the terrain is relatively flat. It rises gradually in a series of sandy ancient beach ridges left by Lake Erie at a time when the lake was much larger that it is today. East and southeast of the ridge, glacial moraine covers the Allegheny Plateau as it rises gradually toward the Appalachian Plateau. This area is hilly, cut through by numerous dry ravines. The western edge of Newburgh Township was bounded by the Cuyahoga River, whose valley lay below the surrounding land. In the north, Kingsbury Run acted as a natural border for many years between the city of Cleveland and Newburgh Township. To the south of Kingsbury Run, Burke Branch defined the route of Kinsman Avenue, and Morgan's Run that of Broadway Avenue. Mill Creek, a small tributary of the Cuyahoga River, formed the township's southern and southeastern boundary. Union‚ÄìMiles Park lies primarily east and southeast of the Portage Escarpment, with only the far southwestern part of the neighborhood on the Till Plains. Mill Creek helps define the area's southwestern border. Early history Early human settlers 1867 drawing of a Woodland/Whittlesey encampment located near the intersection of Broadway Avenue and Aetna Road Human beings first settled in northeast Ohio about 11,000 BCE, at the end of the Wisconsin Glaciation. The area, only recently uncovered by retreating glaciers, was initially tundra-like, but over time developed extensive evergreen forests. This highly nomadic hunting culture, known as Paleo-Indian, disappeared about 8,000 BCE, replaced by the nomadic hunter-gatherer Archaic culture. As the climate continued to warm, vast beech and maple forests (which continued to exist into the 19th century) supplanted the evergreens. About 2,500 BCE, this culture was in turn replaced by the semi-sedentary Woodland culture, which introduced ceramics and textiles to Ohio. The semi-permanent encampments of the Woodland people were usually atop high bluffs overlooking major river valleys, and consisted of low earthen walls and shallow ditches, which led early white settlers to mistakenly characterize them as \\"forts\\". Over time, these encampments were used for longer periods each year, and become more complex. Toward the end of the Woodland period, the Woodland people developed the bow and arrow. The more advanced culture of the Woodland people led to a major population increase in northeast Ohio. A warming trend in the global climate about 800 CE created more agriculturally favorable weather in Ohio, which led to development of subsistence farming. A new society emerged, the Whittlesey culture (named for 19th century Ohio scientist Charles Whittlesey). The semi-permanent blufftop settlements of the Woodland period became small- to medium-sized permanent villages. The Whittlesey engaged in the farming of beans, corn, and squash, and developed an extensive fishing tradition. Between 1600 and 1650 CE, the Whittlesey people disappeared. The cause‚Äîabsorption into another culture, disease, emigration, low birth rate, warfare, or some combination of factors‚Äîis not known. By the time the Iroquois of what is now central New York began moving along the shore of Lake Erie into northeast Ohio in 1650 during the Beaver Wars, the area was almost uninhabited. In the early and mid 1700s, the Mingo, Odawa (or Ottawa), and Ouendat (or Wyandot) occupied the area after fleeing the Iroquois. By 1800, Native American emigration out of the area was occurring again, and few indigenous people lived anywhere in Ohio by 1850. At least two of the Woodland people \\"forts\\" still could be seen in Newburgh Township. One settlement was about southeast of the Cleveland city limits on Broadway Avenue, near the modern intersection of Broadway avenue and Aetna Road. The encampment stood on a small spit on dry land, protected on either side by deep ravines. The Woodland people had erected two parallel, low earthen walls across the neck of the spit. A high artificial mound existed near this \\"fort\\". The second \\"fort\\" was located near what is now the CanalWay Center of the Ohio & Erie Canal Reservation of the Cleveland Metroparks, and consisted of earthen walls approximately high, with a ditch in front of them. Early history: White settlement prior to the establishment of Newburgh Township The Connecticut Western Reserve Modern Mill Creek Falls In 1662, Charles II of England, ignoring existing Native American claims to the area, granted to the Connecticut Colony all lands west of the colony between the 41st and 42nd parallels of north latitude. These rights began at the western border of the Colony of Rhode Island and Providence Plantations and extended to the Pacific Ocean, although they did not include lands already ceded to the Province of New York or the Province of Pennsylvania. Charles and other English monarchs had also pledged these same lands to the Massachusetts Bay Colony, the Province of New York, Plymouth Colony, and the Colony of Virginia. In 1786, Connecticut ceded all its land claims to the government of the United States in exchange for cancellation of its American Revolutionary War debts. Connecticut retained only those lands known as the Connecticut Western Reserve, an area bounded by Lake Erie on the north, Pennsylvania on the east, and the 41st parallel of north latitude on the south. The Western Reserve extended for exactly to the west, and came to an abrupt halt. On August 3, 1795, the state of Connecticut sold the Western Reserve to the Connecticut Land Company for $1.2 million ($ in dollars). Sales to potential settlers began immediately. The first settlers in what would be Newburgh Township were David Bryant and his son, Whitman, who arrived in June 1797. East of the Portage Escarpment, they found dense forests of American sycamore, beech, black walnut, eastern hemlock, eastern redcedar, northern red oak, Ohio buckeye, shagbark hickory, sugar maple, and white oak. West of the escarpment were American elm, ash, beech, and black cherry. In some places, settlers would have seen artificial meadows, created by Native Americans using controlled fire. On the flats which formed the valley of the Cuyahoga River bluegrass, white clover, and wild rye grew in profusion. American bison, eastern elk, and the extremely plentiful white-tailed deer were the most common game animals inhabiting the area. Canada geese, ducks, grouse, passenger pigeon, quail, and wild turkey were the most common game fowl. In November 1799, Wheeler W. Williams and Ezra Wyatt constructed a gristmill at what is now Mill Creek Falls. In 1800, a sawmill was erected alongside the grist mill. Anticipating great growth in the area, in 1800 the 10 families which lived in Newburgh established the first burying ground in the township, the Axtell Street Cemetery, on at what is now E. 78th Street and Krueger Avenue (adjacent to the neighborhood's western boundary). Many of Newburgh's pioneer families were buried in there, including the Ames, Burk, Edwards, Gaylord, Hamilton, Holly, Hubble, Jewett, Miles, Morgan, Hamilton, Quayle, and Wiggins families. Their faith in the township's grown proved correct. Although the mouth of the Cuyahoga River initially drew the most settlers, a great many of these families moved into the highlands of Newburgh Township after finding their original homesteads prone to malaria. Among the area's settlers was Charles Miles, Sr., who moved to Newburgh from Hudson, Ohio, in 1805. The Miles family later became one of the most important in the township. The first educational opportunities for youth in Newburgh Township were private classes, which began to be offered about 1800. The first school open to the public (upon payment of tuition) was founded in 1802 near the intersection of Woodhill (now E. 93rd Street) and Kinsman Roads. A second school followed at the intersection of Woodhill Road and Union Avenue a few years later. A significant amount of road building occurred in the area just prior to and after the township's organization. By 1806, Newburgh Street (today's Woodhill Road and E. 93rd Street) had opened on the ridge between the grist mill and Doan's Corners. This area was now well-settled, with numerous farms and orchards alongside both sides of the road. The Newburgh Road (today's Broadway Avenue below E. 34th Street; not to be confused with Newburgh Street) and Pittsburgh Street (today's Broadway Avenue above E. 34th Street) were constructed about the same time. The Newburgh Road was the most heavily traveled road between Cleveland and Newburgh, made even more so by the opening of Ontario Street in 1812 (which connected Newburgh Road to Cleveland's Public Square). The Aurora Road (now Miles Avenue and Ohio State Route 43) opened about 1812 as well, although it was abandoned by 1820. Newburgh Township was formally organized on October 15, 1814. Its first law enforcement officer was one-legged, one-armed police constable Gaius Burke. Newburgh township and village Newburgh Township (dark purple line), Union‚ÄìMiles Park (black line), and other areas carved from the township. Early Newburgh Township Cleveland & Pittsburgh Railroad tracks at Broadway Ave. and Jones Rd. in 2017. For much of its early history, Newburgh Township rivaled Cleveland in size and importance. Newburgh was considered so much more important that it was more common for the public to say \\"Cleveland, the town six miles north of Newburgh\\" than the other way around. The neighborhood's first public school, later known as the Miles Park School, opened in 1818 near the corner of Miles and Broadway Avenues. Newburgh Township's importance began to wane after 1826. Cleveland and Newburgh had both vied for the location of the U.S. federal courthouse in Cuyahoga County, but Cleveland won the battle‚Äîallowing that city to permanently eclipse Newburgh. Newburgh Township continued to grow economically, if not in political or cultural importance. A significant concentration of homes had grown up northeast of the intersection of what is now Broadway Avenue and Miles Avenue, near Mill Creek Falls. This area became known as the Village of Newburgh. In 1828, a \\"town hall\\" was erected at what is now 9213 Miles Park Avenue, where it served as a township meeting hall, church, and school. The Newburgh Road was extended to Bedford, Ohio, in 1830; South Highway (Kinsman Avenue) was extended into the center of Cleveland (giving Newburgh access to downtown) in 1830; and Miles Road was repaired and reopened in 1833 as a state road (albeit only to Aurora, Ohio). The Newburgh Road was so important to the area's economic health that it was widened to from in 1834, and renamed Broadway. The area's population had also grown, and several churches were now formed in the township. These included the Miles Park Methodist Church (9105 Miles Park Avenue), and the Miles Park Presbyterian Church (9114 Miles Park Avenue) both founded in 1832, and the Disciples of Christ Church (later known as the Miles Avenue Church of Christ; 9200 Miles Avenue), founded in 1835. The widening of Broadway Avenue significantly improved the economic condition of the Village of Newburgh. By 1840, a carding mill, quarry, sawmill, and two taverns all clustered around what is now the intersection of Broadway and Miles Avenue. A brick-making factory opened shortly after 1840, and remained in operation until the late 1850s. One of the most important businesses in the Village of Newburgh opened in 1840 as well. Known as Cataract House, this three-story brick structure on the west side of Broadway Avenue consisted of a ballroom, meeting halls, and restaurant. It burned in 1852, and was rebuilt as a brick structure. Eagle House, constructed a few years later across the street on the east side of Broadway, offered similar amenities until 1853. A second public school opened in Newburgh Township in 1843 on the northeast corner of what is now Union Avenue and E. 116th Street. Known as the Manx Street School, it served the growing Welsh immigrant population of the area. The building was replaced in 1871, and renamed the Mt. Pleasant School in 1913. In 1847, the Cleveland and Pittsburgh Railroad (C&P;) announced it would build its tracks through the heart of Newburgh Township. The route opened in 1851. The railroad entered the township near E. 69th Street and Central Avenue, heading southeast to Holton Avenue. The tracks then ran south to the intersection of Harvard and Broadway Avenues, at which point they followed Broadway (crossing the street three times) until leaving the township. The railroad greatly improved the economic and social life of Newburgh. Pre‚ÄìCivil War Newburgh Village The tracks of the former Cleveland & Mahoning Valley Railroad at Aetna Road in the Union‚ÄìMiles Park neighborhood in 2017. In 1850, the United States Census showed that Newburgh Township was the fifth-most populous incorporated area in Cuyahoga County, with 1,542 residents living in 259 families in 246 dwellings. Only Cleveland (17,034), Brooklyn‚ÄìOhio City (6,275), East Cleveland (2,313), and Bedford (1,953) were larger population centers. The vast majority of workers in Newburgh Township were agricultural laborers, with a few individuals employed in ways that supported agriculture: blacksmiths, carpenters, shoemakers, and wagon makers. The agricultural economy of Newburgh Township was limited as most farms were small (no more than in size) and numerous dry ravines cut across the arable land. Most families engaged in subsistence farming. Non-agricultural businesses in the township were few in number. Although the Village of Newburgh added a tavern and a sawmill in the 1840s, it still had no hotel or boarding house. 1850 was the same year that Theodore Miles, son of an original pioneer settler of Newburgh Township, donated land east of Broadway Avenue, about equidistant between Harvard and Miles Avenues, for a village square. Cuyahoga County surveyor Ahaz Merchant platted a public square and village around this piece of property. In 1852, the state of Ohio constructed the Northern Ohio Lunatic Asylum on what is now Turney Road between Warner Road and Vineyard Avenue, adjacent to the current neighborhood's western border. Later known as Newburgh State Hospital and still later as the Cleveland State Hospital, it burned to the ground in 1872, after which a larger, secure building was constructed. The grounds adjacent to Mill Creek were sold to the city to add to Garfield Park in 1896. The hospital, notoriously overcrowded and wracked by repeated abuse scandals, closed in 1975 and was demolished in the fall of 1994.; ; ; The Cleveland and Mahoning Valley Railroad (C&MV;) began laying its tracks through Newburgh Township in 1853. The railroad began in a yard that stretched along the Old Ship Channel of the Cuyahoga River in the Ohio City neighborhood of Cleveland. It cut across the peninsula (paralleling Mulberry Avenue), then briefly ran along the Cuyahoga River. It cut overland to the southeast to avoid the Scranton Flats and Wheeling Bend, crossing the Cuyahoga just north of Kingsbury Run. The tracks then ran parallel to and east of Broadway Avenue, shifting to an east-southeast direction about E. 55th Street. After crossing the tracks of the Cleveland and Pittsburgh Railroad, the C&MV; turned sharply southward. Before reaching Hamilton Avenue (now called Harvard Avenue), the tracks shifted southeast again, largely paralleling Harvard Avenue, Caine Avenue, and Miles Avenue before leaving the township. In 1854, Union Avenue was constructed and planked from Broadway Avenue just south of E. 55th Street all the way east to Chagrin Falls (a distance of about ). Union‚ÄìMiles and the steel industry Growth of the steel industry in Union‚ÄìMiles Throughout the 1850s, Newburgh Township's economy diversified rapidly. In 1857, Henry and Lemuel Pratt opened the Ohio Chair Factory at the corner of Broadway and Walker Avenues on the Union‚ÄìMiles Park western boundary. Although the factory closed about 1872, the building remained for years, and in 1875 served as the temporary headquarters for the Eighteenth Ward's newly formed police district. By 1858, the Village of Newburgh boasted a boot and shoe store, dry goods and grocery store, hotel, physician, shingle manufacturer, and wagon maker. The completion in 1856 of the Cleveland and Mahoning Valley Railroad provided the impetus for the establishment of the iron and steel industry in Newburgh by linking the mills to sources for raw materials, opening up regional markets for iron and steel, and for allowing Cleveland to serve as a transshipment center for iron ore to inland areas. That same year, the Grasselli Chemical Company opened on the Cuyahoga River (near the modern intersection of Broadway Avenue and E. 30th Street) to supply chemicals to the iron industry. Although Grasselli Chemicals was located outside the Union‚ÄìMiles Park neighborhood, Czech and Polish immigrants, seeking work in the plant, began settling along Broadway Avenue nearby. Steel became both Cleveland and Newburgh Township's biggest industry in the 1860s. By 1870, Cleveland was the nation's second-largest producer of iron behind Pennsylvania, and by 1880 Cleveland's economy was overwhelmingly dominated by the iron and steel industry. Steel rapidly boosted the greater Cleveland area's population so that by 1890 Cleveland was the tenth-largest city in the nation. As late as 1920, steel was still the most important industry in Ohio, and Cleveland remained the Ohio steel industry's most important center. Cleveland was not only a national center for steel production, but because of steel it also became a major shipbuilding and automobile production hub. The city became the second-largest automobile manufacturing center in the nation (only Detroit was larger), because of its ready access to steel. Along with the Cleveland Flats along the Cuyahoga River, Union‚ÄìMiles Park was one of two great steel-making centers in Cleveland. The Cleveland Rolling Mill in Newburgh Township was Cleveland's most important manufacturer by 1879, and six years later, the company was the largest iron and steel manufacturer in Cleveland and one of the five largest steel firms west of Pennsylvania. Formation and growth of Cleveland Rolling Mill Drawing depicting the Cleveland Rolling Mill's Newburgh Works in 1885. 1856 saw the establishment of Union‚ÄìMiles Park's (and Cleveland's) most important manufacturer, Cleveland Rolling Mill. The firm was established by brothers and Welsh immigrants David and John Jones in lot 456 to manufacture flat bottomed railway rails. The brothers ran out of money that same year, and shut down. Scottish immigrants Henry and William Chisholm made a major investment in the Jones plant in 1857, and the company was renamed Chisholm, Jones and Co. The plant was expanded and began rerolling iron flanged railway rails into flat bottomed rails. In 1860, Amasa Stone and his brother, Andros, made a further investment in the company, which took the name Stone, Chisholm & Jones. The new capital enabled to firm to add a blast furnace and puddling plant, which opened in 1859. A second blast furnace was added in 1860. It was the first blast furnace to operate in the Cleveland region. The plant had grown so swiftly that it now employed about 150 workers and produced of iron railroad ties daily. On November 9, 1862, Stone, Chisholm & Jones reorganized and became the Cleveland Rolling Mill after receiving investments from Henry B. Payne, Jeptha Wade, and Stillman Witt. The company built a high, wide blast furnace in 1864 near the west end of what is now Saxe Avenue, and the following year erected its first Bessemer converter. This made the Cleveland Rolling Mill only the second Bessemer steel works in the United States. Henry Chisholm, the driving force behind Cleveland Rolling Mill. Cleveland Rolling Mill expanded its presence in 1868 with the construction of the Newburgh Steel Works next to its existing plant. The new works included an open hearth Bessemer furnace; it was the first continuous open hearth Bessemer furnace west of the Allegheny Mountains and only the fifth such furnace in the nation. A stationary blast furnace and four rolling open hearth furnaces were also built. A boiler plate mill, sheet metal mill, and wire mill were in operation by 1870. Another high, wide blast furnace was erected in 1872. By the end of 1872, the combined Newburgh plants had two puddling mills; two blast furnaces; two Bessemer converters; a boiler plate mill; two rail and rod mills; a wire mill; and a bolt, nut, and spike manufacturing shop. The Newburgh plants were producing so much pig iron, cast iron, and steel that Cleveland Rolling Mill became one of the principal metalworks in the state. A second open hearth furnace was constructed in 1876, and the company leased the works and the Proton Furnace of the Cleveland Iron Co. in 1878. Cleveland Rolling Mill built a high, wide blast furnace at the leased site a year later, by which time Cleveland Rolling Mill occupied of the Union‚ÄìMiles Park neighborhood. Cleveland Rolling Mill continued to expand in the last two decades of the century. In April 1880, the firm issued new stock to double its capitalization, purchased the \\"Canal Tract\\" from John D. Rockefeller, built the Central Furnaces on the site from 1881 to 1882 A blooming mill was built on the Newburgh site in 1881, and a third blast furnace in 1882. 1882 also saw the erection of a Garrett rod mill, the first of its kind anywhere in the world. Construction of the Central Furnaces enabled the company to dismantle two of the older furnaces at Newburgh in 1884. Another blooming mill was erected at Newburgh in 1901, another blast furnace in 1901, and a rod mill in 1902. Cleveland Rolling Mill was acquired by the American Steel and Wire Company of New Jersey in 1899. By that time, the company's works stretched from E. 91st Street in the east to E. 78th Street in the west, and from Harvard Avenue in the south north to Aetna Road. A second, smaller works occupied an area a half-mile to the west, bounded by Broadway Avenue, Fleet Avenue, and Aetna Road. Cleveland Rolling Mill occupied a total of in what would become the Union‚ÄìMiles Park neighborhood, and 4,000 workers were employed there. Other steel companies By 1859, several other metal manufacturing plants had been built in Newburgh Township near rail lines. Most of these merely rerolled rails, but after some years many of these plants began manufacturing finished iron as well as steel. Another 21 iron and steel mills were established in the area between 1860 and 1866. Among the more important companies were: * The Cleveland Wire Mill Company, established in February 1867. Its works were built adjacent to the neighborhood's western border where Wire Avenue met the Cleveland & Pittsburgh Railroad tracks. The only mill of its kind in northern Ohio when it was built, it proved so successful that it doubled in size within a year. This mill was also the largest of its kind in the country, and capable of manufacturing an extremely wide range of product. Cleveland Rolling Mill purchased the works of the Cleveland Wire Mill Company in 1868 or 1869. Cleveland Rolling Mill expanded the plant beginning in 1896, adding a rod mill with two small blast furnaces and a continuous rod mill with one small blast furnace. * The Aetna Iron and Nail Company, established in June 1867. It works were built adjacent to the neighborhood's western border on land owned by the Union Iron Works (at what is now the intersection of Aetna Road and E. 82nd Street). The southern edge of the works abutted the Axtell Street Cemetery. * The American Sheet and Boiler Plate Company, established in 1868. Its works were constructed just north of the Cleveland Rolling Mill's works (at what is now Aetna Road, between the Cleveland & Pittsburgh and the Cleveland & Mahoning Valley railroad tracks). * The Cleveland Iron Co., established in 1869. Its works were constructed between the Cleveland Rolling Mill works and the American Boiler Plate works at Carter Avenue (now Cambridge Street). The company plant included the high, wide Proton Furnace. Cleveland Rolling Mill leased the company and its works beginning in 1878. * The Union Iron Works, established in 1869. Its works were built adjacent to the neighborhood's western border just north of Union Avenue (at what is now the northeast corner of the intersection of Union Avenue and E. 78th Street). Founder Samuel Augustus Fuller established the mill to roll railway rails. Henry Chisholm purchased the company in 1871 and combined it with the Aetna works two blocks to the south to produce steel using the Bessemer process. The firm built the Emma Furnace in 1872, a massive and famous blast furnace named for Emma Paton (daughter of David Jones and wife of Aetna Iron co-founded James Paton). Additional, smaller furnaces were constructed in 1875. Fuller bought the mills back in 1880 and formed the Union Rolling Mill Co. Chisholm spun off the Emma Furnace under the ownership of the Newburg Furnace Co. in January 1882, and it was purchased by the Union Rolling Mill Co. in August 1883. By 1893, the Union Rolling Mill Co. employed 400 workers on of land. * The Gartland Foundry, founded in February 1893. Its works were located on Echo Street between E. 71st and E. 72nd, just outside the Union‚ÄìMiles Park western boundary. The firm was so successful that it doubled the size of its plant in 1899. Consolidation in the Union‚ÄìMiles Park steel industry In April 1898, Cleveland Rolling Mills joined with 13 other nail, rod, and wire manufacturing companies to form the American Steel and Wire Company of New Jersey. Cleveland Rolling Mill furnished steel for its own mills and three other wire and nail mills in the region. In 1901, American Steel and Wire merged with American Sheet Steel Company, American Steel Hoop Company, American Tin Plate Company, Carnegie Steel Company, Federal Steel Company, National Steel Company, and National Tube Company to form U.S. Steel. The merger left U.S. Steel in control of nearly all the wire and nail companies in the nation. Changes wrought by the steel industry Broadway and Newburg Street Railway powerhouse at Broadway Avenue and Aetna Road The Union‚ÄìMiles Park iron and steel mills‚Äîand the associated factories which turned these products into bolts, machinery, nails, plate, rods, tools, and other items‚Äîwere largely concentrated in the central and western sections of the neighborhood. The emergence of the steel industry encouraged a large number of Irish, Welsh, and, to a much lesser extent, Scottish immigrants to move to the area to work in the mills. Most of the Irish and Welsh workers settled around the intersection of Broadway Avenue and Jones Road, just north of Harvard Avenue. Another Irish community formed on Gaylord Avenue southeast of the Cleveland Rolling Mill, which led people to refer to this part of Union‚ÄìMiles Park as Irishtown. Nearly all of the Irish and Welsh workers were unskilled, low-paid employees. As the iron and steel industry in the area expanded, and more immigrant workers moved into the area, small houses on lots set close together proliferated. Employers and developers began to build worker housing against iron and steel plant boundaries so that their employees could walk to work. To provide these workers with access to the downtown retail area, the Broadway Street Railway opened in 1863. This was a horse-drawn omnibus guided by metal rails ran down Broadway Avenue from Public Square to the Village of Newburgh twice a day. The Broadway & Newburgh Street Railway's omnibus line opened in 1873, running from the Kinsman Street Railway at the intersection of Woodland Avenue and E. 55th Street south to Broadway Avenue, and then down Broadway to E. 110th Street. A third omnibus line, the Brooklyn Street Railway, began operating in 1883 from Public Square. It traveled south on Ontario Street and Orange Avenue to Woodland Avenue, and then east on Woodland Avenue to Woodland Cemetery. One year later, it extended its line south from Woodland Avenue along E. 55th Street to Broadway (paralleling the Broadway & Newburgh Street Railway). Between 1884 and 1894, all non-cable street railways in Cleveland had converted to electricity. The Brooklyn Street Railway built a powerhouse at the intersection of Broadway Avenue and Aetna Road. In 1893, the company, now part of the Cleveland Electric Railway Company, began construction of a spur on Miles Avenue from Broadway to E. 131st Street. A loop, beginning at Broadway and Union Avenue, traveled east on Union to E. 93rd Street, south to Harvard Street, and back to Broadway. Despite the extensive public transit system, the proximity of working housing to the steel mills meant that 60 percent of workers in 1920 in the Union‚ÄìMiles Park neighborhood still walked to work daily, a much higher percentage than in any other industrial city in the nation. Newburgh Town Hall. This image, taken between 1894 and 1903, shows the town hall in use by the Newburgh branch of the Cleveland Public Library. By 1860, most people in Newburgh Township worked in the iron and steel industry or in the area's chair and soap factories. The metals industry was so important to the area that it was called the \\"Iron Ward\\". The new blast furnaces worked through the night, and were so bright that when a pair of new furnaces began operation in 1861 the fire department believed the city was ablaze. The mills generated noise and soot, and at night the glare from the blast furnaces and Bessemer converters would light up the sky above. The large number of railroad tracks in the area divided neighborhoods, and trains were both loud and heavy polluters. The population boom led the Village of Newburgh to erect a $3,600 ($ in dollars) town hall on its village green in 1860, and to enlarge it in 1872. The public square was named Miles Park in honor of its donor, Theodore Miles, in 1877. As the large influx of immigrants supplanted the New England Yankee culture of the area, which had predominated since its first settlement by whites, new social institutions were formed. Welsh immigrants founded a Sunday school in 1857, which became the Welsh Congregational Church (known colloquially as the Jones Avenue Church and the Welsh Church of Newburg) in 1858. The church moved to a donated house on Wales Street (now E. 86th Street) in 1860. The house was enlarged in 1866, and a much larger church erected alongside the old structure in 1876. The church became known as the Centennial Church in 1881. The first Roman Catholic church established in Newburgh was Holy Rosary Church, founded in 1862. The growth of the Catholic community in Ohio was small at first. The first Catholic church in northern Ohio was only built in 1820, and by 1829 there were only two. The first Catholic church in Cleveland wasn't built until 1840. A significant influx of Catholic believers in the early 1840s led to the rapid construction of more churches. The Roman Catholic Diocese of Cleveland was erected on April 13, 1847, and Amadeus Rappe became the first bishop with his consecration on October 10, 1847. The influx of Irish immigrants in the 1850s greatly enlarged the Catholic population in the Union‚ÄìMiles Park area. A mission, the Church of Newburgh, was founded in 1854 to serve this Irish population. The success of this mission led directly to the founding of Holy Rosary. The congregation initially worshipped on the second floor of the Newburgh Village town hall until its church home was erected at the corner of E. 93rd Street and Miles Park Avenue later that year. Holy Rosary built a new, larger structure at 8328 Broadway Avenue in 1881 (just outside the southwestern border of Union‚ÄìMiles Park), and the congregation changed their name to Holy Name Church. Interior of Holy Name Church in 2017. The church was founded as Holy Rosary in 1862, and moved to its current location and adopted its current name in 1881. Churches were not the only social organizations to be established. The Freemasons organized the Newburgh Lodge in 1866, and erected a Masonic Hall at what is now 8201 Broadway. In 1916, the lodge contracted with local architect William J. Carter to design and build the Newburgh Masonic Temple six blocks to the southeast at 8910 Miles Park Avenue. Despite the immense changes in Union‚ÄìMiles Park since 1856, the area was still quite rural. Nearly all homes in the neighborhood in 1873 were modest (and grimy), and nearly all roads were rutted dirt. Broadway was the only paved street, as it had been lined with stone in 1871 and 1872. Only four dry goods and grocery stores existed on Broadway Avenue, while a meat and vegetable market stood at the corner of Harvard Avenue and E. 91st Street. The area's first newspaper, All Around the Clock, also began publishing in 1873. The newspaper changed its name to the South Cleveland Advocate in 1876. Smoke and soot covered much of the area around the railroad tracks and steel mills. Village of Newburgh Village of Newburgh incorporated in 1874, separating the village from the remainder of the township. That same year, the Reeves Opera house opened a few yards north of Cataract House. This three-story stone structure served as a restaurant, saloon, theater, and boarding house. The first fire station in the township opened at E. 91st Street and Walker Avenue (a block north of Miles Park) on February 9, 1875. Equipment consisted of a steam pumper (named the \\"George B. Senter\\") and an old ladder truck, both donated by the city of Cleveland. The village's first police station opened in June 1876 on Broadway Avenue in the old Ohio Chair Factory building. Steel strikes and changing demographics A major strike by the Amalgamated Association of Iron and Steel Workers hit Cleveland Rolling Mill in May and June 1882. The company responded by bringing large numbers of Polish and Slovak immigrants into the mills as strikebreakers. The strike was broken, and most of the Irish and Welsh never returned to the mills. The company's tactic prompted a fundamental shift in the neighborhood's identity, from Irish and Welsh to Polish and Slovak. It also created lasting enmity between the western and eastern Europeans in the area. A second strike occurred at the Cleveland Rolling Mill in July 1885. Poles and Slovaks in the neighborhood successfully encouraged their immigrant kin to avoid becoming strikebreakers. Unable to hire enough replacement workers to staff the plant, the company locked out its employees and closed the plant. When the union engaged in mass picketing in protest, Cleveland police attacked the picket line and 35 strikers were injured. Once more, the strike was broken. The population increase in the area encouraged the Cleveland Board of Education to establish a third public school in Union‚ÄìMiles Park in 1886. This was the Woodland Hills School, located on the southwest corner of the intersection of Union Avenue and E. 93rd Street. The same year, the Newburgh branch of the Young Men's Christian Association (YMCA), which had been organized in January 1874, opened its gymnasium and meeting center at 2527 Broadway Avenue (now 8305 Broadway Avenue). Railroads and cemetery Calvary Cemetery, showing the bridge which connects the two sides of the cemetery beneath the Conotton Valley Railroad tracks The Newburgh & South Shore Railroad, entering Union‚ÄìMiles Park via a bridge over Broadway Avenue near Jones Road Another major railroad built its line through Newburgh beginning in 1881. The Connotton Northern Railroad was incorporated in 1880 to build a line from Canton to Fairport Harbor. The line began construction in Canton and was built about halfway (into Portage County) when the railroad decided that Cleveland would be a better terminus. On November 8, 1880, the Connotton Northern merged with the Connotton Valley Railroad to form the Connotton Valley Railway. Construction on the line into Cleveland began in 1881, and was completed in January 1882. The road's line entered the Union‚ÄìMiles Park neighborhood at what would later be Calvary Cemetery, ran north to the southern end of the Cleveland Rolling Mill site, then turned southwest and west to follow Morgan's Run before crossing the Cuyahoga River near the Clark Avenue Bridge. The road then followed the Cuyahoga north- northwest to terminate at the Scranton Peninsula. The Axtell Road Cemetery was demolished in 1880 and the land sold to the Connotton Railway. The Harvard Grove Cemetery was established on Harvard Avenue between E. 59th and E. 64th Streets the same year to accommodate the more than 3,000 bodies which were removed. While the railroad caused the removal of one cemetery, another was built adjacent to it in 1892, when the Catholic Diocese of Cleveland established a large burial ground, Calvary Cemetery, on the former Leand farm. The cemetery's all lay on the western side of the Connotton Valley railroad tracks. The cemetery made its first expansion east of these tracks when it purchased another in 1900.; In 1893, Cleveland's Superior, St. Clair, West Side, and Woodland Avenue streetcar lines merged to create the Cleveland Electric Railway Company (\\"Big Consolidated\\"). That same year, the Broadway, East Cleveland, Newburg, and South Side lines merged to form the Cleveland City Railway (\\"Little Consolidated\\"). That same year, the city gave permission for \\"Big Con\\" to extend its Broadway & Newburgh line east down Miles Avenue. The company built a car barn (or depot) at 10200 Miles Avenue (west of the Lake Erie & Wheeling railroad tracks on the southwest corner of the intersection of E. 102nd Street and Miles Avenue). This car barn was the site of a near-riot by striking workers during the 1899 Cleveland streetcar strike. The first interurban to reach Newburgh was the Akron, Bedford and Cleveland Railroad, which opened on October 26, 1895. It began by connecting to the line ran to the Cleveland Electric streetcar line at Broadway Avenue, and ran through Cuyahoga Falls to Akron. The neighborhood received its first public library when the \\"Newburg Library\\", a \\"station\\" of the Cleveland Public Library, opened in 1894 in the Newburgh Town Hall. It was only the second branch of the public library system to open, and the first to open east of the Cuyahoga River. One of the last major metal industry firms established in Union‚ÄìMiles Park in the 19th century was the Champion Rivet Company, formed in 1896 but not incorporated until 1900. Its plant was originally located just outside the border of Union‚ÄìMiles Park at the intersection of Union Avenue and E. 88th Street. The last major railroad through Union‚ÄìMiles Park was the Newburgh and South Shore Railroad. The company incorporated in 1899 as a subsidiary of American Steel and Wire. The line, which began construction in 1899 and was complete in 1904, was intended to link the Newburgh area iron and steel plants with those on the Cuyahoga River and near the port of Cleveland. The line began at the company's Central Furnaces and ran briefly south before turning west and crossing the Cuyahoga River at the now-demolished Jefferson Avenue Bridge. The track ran through the company's plant on the west side of the Cuyahoga, and recrossed the river near the now-demolished Clark Avenue Bridge. The road then ran south (passing over Campbell Road and under Harvard Avenue) before turning east. After an at-grade crossing of E. 49th Street and the bridging of E. 71st Street, the tracks turned north at E. 76th Street and followed Jones Road into the Newburgh Works. They terminated at Aetna Road. By the end of the 19th century, the demographic shift in Union‚ÄìMiles Park was largely complete. The heart of this community was centered at Aetna Road and E. 93rd Street, where the majority of Poles and Slovaks began settling about 1890. Whereas once the area had been dominated by descendants of New England Yankees and by Irish, Scottish, and Welsh immigrants, the neighborhood was overwhelmingly populated by immigrant Poles and Slovaks by 1900. To accommodate the large number of children in these immigrant families, the Miles School (not to be confused with the Miles Park School) opened in September 1899 just outside the southeast boundary of the Union‚ÄìMiles Park neighborhood at E. 119th Street and Miles Avenue. Annexations Early annexations of Newburgh Newburgh Township was formally organized on October 15, 1814. Cleveland became a village on October 23. At that time, its boundaries were the Cuyahoga River, Lake Erie, Erie Street (E. 6th Street) and Huron Road. When Cleveland was incorporated by the state on March 5, 1836, a small triangular section of the township (roughly bounded by what is now E. 22nd Street and the RTA Rapid tracks) was given to Cleveland. The city purchased from landowner George Worthington in April 1850 in order to include the toll gate on Pittsburgh Street (now Broadway Avenue) within the city limits. Despite the extensive industrialization of Newburgh Township and particularly Union‚ÄìMiles Park in the 1850s and 1860s, the township offered few amenities. Most of the area was still rural, providing little property tax revenue. There were no firefighting, law enforcement, or freshwater services. Just two streets, Broadway and Miles, had been paved. During this period, many residents of Newburgh Township began agitating to be annexed by the city of Cleveland. 1869‚Äì1873 annexation wave Map showing the original 1814 Newburgh Township, with annexations by the city of Cleveland and others. The Union‚ÄìMiles Park neighborhood is outlined in black. Cleveland annexed most of Newburgh Township, including about half of Union‚ÄìMiles Park, from 1869 to 1873. Both push (developers seeking to annex undeveloped land into the city) and pull (the city seeking to incorporate developed areas) annexation occurred, as Cleveland began absorbing the northwest corner of the township and gradually moved southeast. The first annexation in this wave occurred on February 28, 1867, when Cleveland absorbed a large, rural, sparsely populated area at the north end of the North Broadway neighborhood. The boundary of this annexation began at the Cuyahoga River at a point due west of the intersection of McBride Avenue and E. 55th Street. It ran due east to E. 65th Street, then north on E. 65th Street to Quincy Avenue, and west on Quincy to E. 55th Street. It then went south on E. 55th Street roughly to Ensign Avenue, west roughly to Rockefeller Avenue, then south to the Cuyahoga River. The second annexation occurred on August 6, 1867. This included the entire area between the 1836/1850 annexations and the February 1867 annexation. It also included small panhandle section north of Quincy Avenue between E. 55th and E. 71st Streets. A small area (original lot number 333) was annexed on December 14, 1869. It was bordered by the August 1867 annexation on the north and west, Woodland Avenue on the south, and East 75th Street on the east. (This incorporated Woodland Cemetery into the city limits.) The first part of Union‚ÄìMiles Park to be annexed by the city of Cleveland was the northern northwest corner. This was part of a large annexation of Newburgh Township which occurred on November 19, 1872. The annexed area border began at E. 75th Street and Quincy Avenue, and ran east to E. 100th Street, then south to Union Avenue, west to E. 65th Street, south to Kenyon Avenue, and then due west to the Cuyahoga River. This pushed Cleveland's city limits up against the northern border of the Village of Newburgh. On September 16, 1873, the Village of Newburgh agreed to be annexed by Cleveland. The border of this annexation began at E. 100th Street, ran south to Grand Division Avenue, west to E. 77th Street, north to Force Avenue, west to E. 55th Street, north to Fleet Avenue, and then west to the Cuyahoga River. This annexation left the entire western half of Union‚ÄìMiles Park inside the Cleveland city limits. Later annexations On November 19, 1893, a small portion of Newburgh Township was added to the Cleveland city limits. The boundary of this annexation began at Fleet Avenue and E. 49th Street, and ran south three blocks, east two blocks, south one block, and then diagonally southeast along the north side of Brow Avenue. This brought the city limits to Burk Run. In 1904, that portion of Newburgh Township west of Mill Creek incorporated as the Village of Newburgh Heights. Cleveland annexed a small portion of Newburgh Heights on September 25, 1905. This was an area bounded by the north side of Kazimier Avenue, E. 65th Street, Grant Avenue, E. 71st Street, Oak Avenue, and the east side of the Newburgh and South Shore Railroad tracks up to the north side of Deveny Avenue. It aligned Cleveland's border with that of Newburgh Heights. In 1907, the portion of Newburgh Township south of the Cleveland city limits incorporated as the village of South Newburgh. It incorporated as the city of Garfield Heights in 1930. Cleveland annexed the incorporated Village of Corlett on December 28, 1909. This roughly square area was encompassed by E. 110th Street on the west, a line equal to the south side of Cotes and Beachwood Avenues on the south, E. 139th Street on the east, and a line equal with Bartlett Avenue in the north. This brought the southeast corner of Union‚ÄìMiles Park into the Cleveland city limits. The remaining portion of Newburgh Township was annexed by the city of Cleveland on February 10, 1913. This added the northeast corner of Union‚ÄìMiles Park to the city of Cleveland. The rural and industrial portion of Newburgh Village seceded and formed the Village of Cuyahoga Heights in 1917. Union‚ÄìMiles Park name Cleveland neighborhood names are generally colloquial, as the people who live in them form a neighborhood identity and began to give a name to the place where they live. One of the first mentions of the named \\"Union‚ÄìMiles Park\\" in the mass media came in the form of advertisements for homes or apartments for rent in 1926. The Plain Dealer newspaper used the name \\"Union‚ÄìMiles Park\\" for the first time in September 1930. The newspaper's use of the name was rare until 1979, when the Union‚ÄìMiles Community coalition emerged. 20th century Pre-depression Union‚ÄìMiles Park Champion Rivet moved to this factory in 1901. The Boulevard School, opened in 1910, in 2017 In 1904, the Newburgh Town Hall was moved from 9250 Miles Park Avenue slightly to the north at 9213 Miles Park Avenue to make was for a new library building. In 1905, one of the major landmarks of the area was radically changed when the Cleveland and Pittsburgh Railroad (C&P;) won approval of a plan to build new, wide tracks on the south side of Broadway Avenue in order to eliminate an at-grade crossing nearby. The plan required digging a new channel for Mill Creek and moving the Mill Creek Falls some to the south. The waterfalls were moved in 1905. Large areas of the Union‚ÄìMiles Park area continued to be under-developed in the early 20th century. Hamilton Avenue was renamed Harvard Avenue in 1905, but the dirt road did not begin to be paved until 1914. Roads were so bad that when St. Catherine Church (at E. 93rd and St. Catherine Avenue) caught fire in March 1899, the poor condition of the roads prevented firefighting personnel from reaching it in time and the new church burned to the ground (and was rebuilt).; Even as late as 1906, most of Union‚ÄìMiles Park still consisted of fields and dirt roads. Residential growth continued, however, leading to the establishment of more social institutions. The town hall was demolished in 1906, and a new library building erected on the site from 1906 to 1907. The neighborhood's population, which was just 11,000 in 1910, more than doubled to 28,000 in 1930. A new Catholic church, St. Catherine Church, opened in December 1898, and St. Catherine's School opened in the fall of 1900. Another Catholic church, St. Lawrence Church, opened in 1902, as did the associated parochial school, St. Lawrence's School (at E. 81st Street [formerly Rural Street] between Crofoot and Union avenues, just outside the neighborhood's boundary). Nativity of the Blessed Virgin Mary Church ( \\"Nativity B.V.M.\\" and \\"St. Mary of the Nativity\\"), a Catholic church ministering specifically to the Slovak community, opened at 9510 Aetna Road in 1903. It was a small, two-story structure with classrooms on the second floor. Strong growth in membership due to continuing high rates of Slovak immigration into the neighborhood led Nativity B.V.M. to move its building to the Dunlap Avenue side of its lot so that the erection of a large new parish school could begin in 1915 on the original church site. although its associated parochial school was not dedicated until 1916. The $100,000 ($ in dollars) structure opened in December 1916. The iron and steel industry continued to play a large role in the Union‚ÄìMiles Park economy in the first 25 years of the 20th century. Champion Rivet moved its factory in 1901 to Harvard Avenue between E. 110th and E. 116th streets. The first large metal industries company to open in Union‚ÄìMiles Park in the 20th century was Champion Machine and Forging, which opened a factory at E. 78th Street and Osage Avenue about 1908. The second was the Allyne-Ryan Company. Founded by C. C. Bohn, E. E. Allyne, Daniel Ryan, and Rollin H. White, it manufactured automobile cylinders and hard-to-cast items at its plant at Aetna Road and E. 91st Street. The fourth public school in Union‚ÄìMiles Park, the Boulevard School, opened in 1910. Located at the intersection of Carton Avenue and Kinsman Road, it was designed to alleviate overcrowding at the Mt. Pleasant School. Infrastructure, too, received a boost in Union‚ÄìMiles Park when, some time between 1900 and 1910, the Cleveland and Pittsburgh Railroad opened its Newburgh station at Harvard Avenue and Broadway. The Cleveland Short Line Railway began construction in May 1906 from the Lake Shore and Michigan Southern Railway (LS&MS;) main line on the border between the Riverside and Bellaire‚ÄìPuritas neighborhoods of Cleveland (an area known to railroads as \\"Rockport\\"), to the LS&MS; rail yard in Collinwood, Ohio. The first section, from Rockport to the Lake Erie and Pittsburgh Railway (a block south of the intersection of Broadway and Harvard Avenues in the Slavic Village neighborhood, an area known to railroads as \\"Marcy\\") opened on February 24, 1910. The remaining of the line, which cut through Union‚ÄìMiles Park, opened on July 1, 1912. Concordia Lutheran Church, after its expansion. The original church is the small, red brick building to the left. Several more churches were founded in Union‚ÄìMiles Park in the 1910s and 1920s. The congregation which would later be known as St. Joseph Byzantine Catholic Church formed in 1909, and built a small, wood-frame church at 9321 Orleans Avenue in 1913. Concordia Lutheran Church, a congregation for African Americans, was founded 1914, and erected its first church building and school in 1916 at what is now Union Avenue and Martin Luther King Drive. The congregation that formed Archangel Michael Orthodox Church ( St. Michael's Orthodox Church) split from St. John the Baptist Orthodox Church in 1921. It began construction of its new church home at 10000 Union Avenue in April 1924, completing the structure in 1926. Although the long-standing Cataract House closed in 1917, the first Union‚ÄìMiles Park movie theater, the Milo Theater, opened at Miles Avenue and E. 100th Street in 1918. One of the last large metals industry firms to open in Union‚ÄìMiles Park, Superior Screw, built its factory at Aetna Road and E. 93rd Street in 1920. The last school to open before the depression, Paul Revere Elementary, opened adjacent to the neighborhood's northeast boundary at E. 108th Street and Sandusky Avenue in 1920.; An addition was built from 1925 to 1926.; Miles Park Methodist Church lost its high steeple in 1925. Miles Park Presbyterian renovated the interior of its church in 1935, leaving little of historic character. Nativity of the Blessed Virgin Mary Church built a much larger, Italian Renaissance Revival church at 9614 Aetna Road, adjacent to its parish school. The new church opened in October 1927. Great Depression: Collapse of the steel industry and growth of churches and schools Looking east through Bisbee Park (now Carol McClendon Park) Although U.S. Steel had continued to expand in the area west of Union‚ÄìMiles Park from 1900 to 1925, the Great Depression led to the collapse of the steel industry in the neighborhood. U.S. Steel had been created from a wide range of companies. Rather than an integrated plant, the company found that gross inefficiencies emerged as the pieces of the company attempted to work together to make steel. The company had to move molten iron from the Central Furnaces to the Newburgh Works using congested railroads. Once converted into steel, the steel had to be shipped to other Cleveland area plants for conversion into beams, plate, rods, and wire. U.S. Steel announced on December 1, 1932, that it would close the Newburgh Works in four months. The mill's furnaces and Bessemer converters went cold on April 30, 1933,; and its demolition began in September 1935. Superior Screw moved to Shaker Heights, Ohio, in 1933 as well. Although the closure of the Newburgh Works meant the loss of 2,000 jobs, the Union‚ÄìMiles Park neighborhood continued to see new schools and other buildings erected. John Adams High School, the first secondary school in the area, opened on the eastern border of Union‚ÄìMiles Park at the intersection of Corlett Avenue and E. 116th Street in 1923.; Nathan Hale Elementary School opened in 1928 at 3588 East Blvd. (now Martin Luther King Jr. Drive). The library at the old town hall moved into a new structure at 9213 Union Avenue in 1931. It was promoted to \\"branch\\" status and moved into a large new building at 9319 Union Avenue in 1939. In 1933, St. Joseph Byzantine built a new, much larger church home next to its existing small wood-frame structure. This Romanesque Revival structure featured two towers with copper domes and extensive interior mural paintings. Concordia Lutheran also expanded the same year, significantly enlarging its church.; Miles Park School, too, added space, building an auditorium, classroom, and gymnasium. Union‚ÄìMiles Park received its first public park when of land at the eastern end of Beacon Avenue were converted into Bisbee Park in July 1939. The park was created through the efforts of a neighborhood businessmen's club, the city, and the federal Works Progress Administration. 1940 to 1959: Slow decline Dove Park in 2017 Simmons Manufacturing, which purchased the former Superior Screw building in 1933, Simmons vacated the building in the late 1930s, and it was purchased by United States Ordnance Engineers, Inc. (a subsidiary of Lake Erie Chemicals) in April 1941 for use as a war materi√©l factory. Lake Erie Chemicals would retain ownership of the structure after the war, and it housed a wide variety of small manufacturers until 1957 when Braden Sutphin Ink purchased and moved into the building. The city of Cleveland constructed a second public park in Union‚ÄìMiles Park in 1948, Dove Park. Once Cleveland's most important industry, the steel industry in the city began to shrink again in the 1950s. Gartland, which changed its name to Superior Foundry in 1901, expanded in 1955 and purchased Allyne-Ryan in 1958. It then closed the Allyne-Ryan plant in 1960, sold the Allyne-Ryan plant in September 1961, and went out of business itself in October 1961. A rise in the demand for specialty steel helped offset these losses somewhat, and Union‚ÄìMiles Park remained a Central and Eastern European ethnic enclave until the 1960s. This enabled the Catholic presence in the neighborhood to continue to thrive. In 1955, St. Mary's Ukrainian Catholic Church broke ground on its new church home at Kinsman Road and E. 105th Street. That same year, St. Joseph Byzantine Catholic Church began construction on a $400,000 ($ in dollars), eight-room school and parish rectory. The structures were completed in 1957,; and the original 1913 church demolished. Nevertheless, the population of Union‚ÄìMiles Park dropped 19.0 percent between 1940 and 1960. 1960 to 1979: Rapid demographic change U.S. Steel slowly closed its operations in Cleveland in the 1960s and 1970s. By the late 1960s, the loss of these high-paying manufacturing jobs, improved public transportation and commuter highway systems, and the growth in both job opportunities and worker housing in the suburbs had convinced most Czechs, Poles, Slovaks, and other whites to leave Union‚ÄìMiles Park for new homes outside the city. Champion Machine and Forging (renamed Champion Forge) closed in 1965. The firm was purchased by Schott Industries in 1948, and then by Steel Improvement in 1954. The building was leased to several small manufacturers after Champion Forge ceased to exist. White flight in the 1960s caused a steep decline in the neighborhood. Many absentee property owners no longer gave their homes the right amount of maintenance, and mortgage defaults, foreclosures, and sheriff's sales became common. Many homes were simply abandoned. The presence of even one or two abandoned or closed homes on a block caused the value of surrounding properties to fall significantly. As the number of empty or abandoned buildings rose, so did crime, squatting, and vandalism, and the remaining property owners often reduced their maintenance even further. This white flight so devastated the Central and Eastern European communities of Union‚ÄìMiles Park that many of the churches and other social institutions these communities supported neared collapse by 1970. The racial makeup of Union‚ÄìMiles Park changed as the local Union‚ÄìMiles Park economy worsened. African Americans had long been restricted to Cleveland's Central neighborhood by white refusal to sell or rent to blacks, restrictive housing covenants, and low incomes. Few blacks lived outside Central; just 2,300 African Americans (10 percent of the total neighborhood population) lived in Union‚ÄìMiles Park in 1960. Throughout the 1960s and 1970s, African Americans moved into Cleveland neighborhoods being abandoned by whites‚Äîneighborhoods once denied to blacks, but now with plenty of empty housing being sold at steep discounts. Although Cleveland as a whole lost 52 percent of its population from 1960 to 1980, the city's African American population held steady. There were 253,108 African American residents in Cleveland in 1960 (28.9 percent of total population), and 252,481 blacks in Cleveland in 1980 (44 percent of total population)‚Äîa loss of just 627 people. As a percentage of population, however, African Americans rose from 28.9 percent of the total population in 1960 to 44 percent of the total population in 1980. In Union‚ÄìMiles Park, the population actually rose by 0.9 percent from 1960 to 1970, and dropped just 16.9 percent from 1970 to 1980. During the same period, Cleveland as a whole lost 14.3 percent and 23.6 percent of its population, respectively. The total population figures for Union‚ÄìMiles Park mask the underlying racial shift, which was already apparent by 1972. The markedly lower population losses in Union‚ÄìMiles Park were due to a large influx of African American residents, and by 1980 90 percent of all residents in the neighborhood were African American. These demographic changes affected social institutions in the neighborhood. As middle-class African Americans left the area for the suburbs, the churches they supported were often unable to survive. St. Philip's, a black-majority Lutheran church located in the Kinsman neighborhood, merged with Concordia Lutheran in September 1965, with the new congregation using Concordia's building. Concordia Lutheran engaged in a \\"merger of strength\\" with St. John Lutheran in Independence, Ohio, in 1967, and sold its building to Mt. Haven Baptist Church. The Cleveland public school system continued to invest in the neighborhood, however. The district approved a $1.39 million ($ in dollars) replacement for the Miles Park School at 4090 E. 93rd Street in 1969.; Delayed a year by a construction workers' strike, the new school opened in September 1971.; A new Woodland Hills School began construction in 1969 as well, and completed in 1973.; In June 1977, Archangel Michael Orthodox Church moved to Broadview Heights, Ohio. It sold its old church home, school, and social hall to other organizations, most notably El Hasa Temple Number 28. This Shriners lodge lost its building at 1809 E. 55th Street to fire in June 1976. Beginning in 1977, it rented (and later purchased) the former St. Michael's social hall for use as its new headquarters. Miles Park Methodist Church closed its doors in 1978, and sold its church structure to Allen Chapel Missionary Baptist Church. Cleveland had long suffered from racially discriminatory practices by lending institutions, and in 1979 residents of Union‚ÄìMiles Park began picketing lenders, including the Federal Housing Administration (FHA). By this time, the Union‚ÄìMiles Park neighborhood was crime-ridden and decaying. The neighborhood was still solidly blue-collar, and the 1973‚Äì75 recession hit the area especially hard. Many of the most affordable homes were owned or leased by public housing agencies, yet these homes were some of the most decrepit in the area. In the spring of 1979, 100 block clubs in the neighborhood formed an umbrella group, the Union-Miles Community Coalition, to work more effectively as an advocate for improved housing and city services in the area. 1980 to 1999: Destabilization and recovery The 1982 Union Branch, a unit of the Cleveland Public Library system The 1980 recession and the early 1980s recession both hit Union‚ÄìMiles Park hard, leaving the community with 25 percent of its residents living below the federal poverty line. The congregation at St. Joseph Byzantine moved to the suburbs in April 1980, selling its building to Greater Zion Hill Baptist Church. The Boulevard School closed in the fall of 1980 due to falling enrollment. The Union-Miles Community Coalition had taken on an increasing number of tasks since its formation. Initially, it pressed the city to provide improved basic services, and to tear down abandoned, decrepit, or vandalized housing. It formed neighborhood watch programs and safety patrols, and it pushed local banks to establish branches in the neighborhood and provide more lending in the area. To enable it to take on increasingly complex problems requiring full-time staff and public and private financing, the coalition formed the nonprofit Union Miles Development Corporation (UMDC) on May 1, 1981. Working with the Center for Neighborhood Development, UMDC won passage of a new state law allowing nonprofit community development corporations to act as receivers for abandoned housing. UMDC also established the Cleveland Housing Receivership Project, which acted as a clearinghouse and advisory body to member neighborhood housing groups interested in using receivership to improve their Cleveland neighborhoods. In 1982, the city built a new, $1.8 million ($ in dollars) Union Branch library at 3463 E. 93rd Street. The 1906 library building on Miles Park, which had been vacated since the construction of the Union \\"station\\" library years before, remained open for community use until 1987. The early 1980s recession crippled U.S. Steel's few remaining operations in Cleveland. The corporation closed its last large plant, the Cuyahoga Works, in May 1984. One of the neighborhood's landmark structures, the Newburgh Town Hall, burned in 1984. The structure was sold in 1923 to the Thomas Funeral Home (later known as the Thomas-Wheaton Funeral Home). It was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1973, converted into an apartment building some time between 1978 and 1984, and rented by a motorcycle club as its clubhouse. The fire on November 18 caused more than $50,000 ($ in dollars) in damage, and it was demolished in October 1985.; ; ; The continuing job and population losses among blue-collar workers in Union‚ÄìMiles Park left 40 percent of the area's housing stock abandoned and demolished. By 1989, housing foreclosure rates in the area reached 35 percent, causing runaway neighborhood decline. Houses on Pratt Avenue at E. 97th Street By the late 1980s, Union‚ÄìMiles Park had become a transitional neighborhood. As poor African Americans in the Kinsman neighborhood achieved a measure of financial stability and wealth, they moved into Union‚ÄìMiles Park. As working-class African Americans moved into the middle class, they left Union‚ÄìMiles Park for suburbs like Warrensville Heights. Despite improvements in some city services in the late 1980s, including the refurbishment of Bisbee and Dove parks, Union‚ÄìMiles Park suffered a 10 percent population loss between 1980 and 1990. By 1990, the racial composition of the neighborhood had risen to 95 percent African American. Poverty had also worsened in the neighborhood. Union‚ÄìMiles Park was ranked 13th in 1970 in terms of the Cleveland neighborhoods with the highest level of poverty. By 1990, it was ranked 8th, with 60.9 percent of all residents living below the federal poverty line‚Äîmaking it one of the poorest neighborhoods anywhere in Cleveland or Cuyahoga County. Aging housing stock and more closures in what was left of the steel industry continued to negatively impact Union‚ÄìMiles Park in the 1990s. Although a few market-rate housing developments were built in the 1990s, the area population declined 10.8 percent from 1990 to 2000. The population loss was greatest among middle- class families, which led to even greater disinvestment in housing and the loss of the neighborhood's few retail districts. Poverty levels rose to 28.0 percent, and 9.1 of all housing units in the neighborhood were vacant. John Adams High School closed in 1995 and was torn down in 1999. Mt. Pleasant School was also closed in 1995 (and scheduled for demolition by the end of 2017). Nativity of Blessed Virgin Mary Church closed on December 27, 1992. The congregation had dwindled to less than 120 worshippers, and had been without a full-time priest for nine years. Area priests had been filling in on a temporary basis, but illness and other duties deprived the congregation of its last pastor in late 1992 so the diocese decided to close the church. Union- Miles Park in the 21st century Stabilization and new schools The Earle B. Turner Recreation Center Miles Park School Nathan Hale School John Adams High School The decline of the Union‚ÄìMiles Park neighborhood slackened in the first decade of the 21st century as the area's population rose significantly from just 15,464 in 2000 to 19,004 in 2010 (an increase of 22.9 percent). Older congregations continued to close or move out of the city, replaced by new ones. Miles Park Presbyterian Church closed in 2000 and sold its building to New Life Missionary Baptist Church. Greater Zion Hill Baptist Church sold the St. Joseph Byzantine building and adjacent school to the House of Glory Church in 2002. House of Glory sold the church (but not the school) to Greater Tabernacle Church in 2010. Greater Tabernacle Church abandoned the structure at some point thereafter, and it was demolished in February 2016. St. Catherine Church merged with two other parishes on January 1, 2008, to form Holy Spirit Parish. The new congregation chose St. Timothy Church at 4341 E. 131st Street for its new home. St. Lawrence Church closed in June 2010. Other changes in the area were more positive. The closed 1906 Miles Park library was rehabilitated in 2000 and turned over to the Union-Miles Neighborhood Development Corporation for use as its headquarters. An overlook, small park, and walking trail were completed at Mill Creek Falls in 2002 as well. Cleveland Metroparks and the Slavic Village Development Corp. spent $1.2 million ($ in dollars) building observation decks and restoring a nearby 19th- century home (which was converted into the Mill Creek Falls Historic Center). Another $200,000 ($ in dollars) were spent building a parking lot and adding a traffic light to improve vehicular access. Clean Ohio, a state open space preservation fund, provided another $650,000 to acquire an additional of land, which added green space, picnicking areas, and toilet facilities to the park. Mill Creek Falls Park opened on October 10, 2002. In December 2004, the city purchased the YMCA building at 11300 Miles Avenue and turned it into a public recreation center.; It was named the Earle B. Turner Recreation Center, in honor of the retired Cleveland City Council member and then-clerk of the Cleveland municipal courts. Schools in the area also received a boost. The Cleveland public school system embarked on a $1.5 billion ($ in dollars) program of new construction and rehabilitation of the public schools in 2002. The 1969 Miles Park School was demolished, and a new $14 million ($ in dollars) Miles Park School opened in August 2007.; The Miles School was demolished in 2010 and a new school was built on the same site in 2015. The 1928 Nathan Hale School was also demolished, and a new Nathan Hale/Mt. Pleasant School built at the same site in 2010. Woodland Hills School closed in 2011, and the building sold for $275,000 ($ in dollars) to Breakthrough, a charter school company, for use by its E Prep and Village Prep schools. Paul Revere elementary school closed in 2012. The first high school to be built under the new program was John Adams High School. The school district had sold the old high school's site to the city in 1999, but repurchased it in 2003 for a new high school.; The new $36.8 million ($ in dollars) John Adams High School opened in the fall of 2006. Initially, John Adams hosted a single, traditional high school. In December 2016, however, the school district decided to dissolve the traditional high school housed by the building. In its place, the city established a Bard High School Early College, to open in the fall of 2017. The city did not yet say what other high school programming will occupy the structure. Crime in the neighborhood Although it has a reputation as a high-crime area, the crime rate in Union‚ÄìMiles Park in 2004 was about the same as the city as a whole. The property crime rate was slightly lower than the city average, and tended to be concentrated in the industrial district on the western edge of the neighborhood. The rate of assault, domestic violence, illegal possession of a firearm, and use of a firearm in a crime were also comparable to that of the city as a whole. Again, they were much higher (double the citywide average) in the western industrial area. Drug crimes were 45 percent higher in Union‚ÄìMiles Park than in the city as a whole. Drug activity, however, was concentrated on eastern and western edges of the area, rather than throughout the neighborhood. The violent crime rate in Union‚ÄìMiles Park was slightly higher than in the city as a whole. Within the neighborhood, violent crime rates varied considerably. In the area along E. 116th Street south of Union Avenue, it was much higher than the city as a whole. In many other areas of the neighborhood, it was substantially lower than the city as a whole. Economy of the neighborhood The industrial areas of the Union‚ÄìMiles Park neighborhood are clustered primarily along the railroad tracks. As of 2004, roughly 30 medium to large manufacturing companies called the neighborhood home. Major industries included building materials manufacturing, chemical manufacturing, commercial laundries, coatings and varnish manufacturing, small foundries and metal- shaping operations, machine shops, roofing materials manufacturing, and warehouses. Many of these surviving industries have existed for two decades or more, and are family-owned. In 2004, there were 104 vacant or underutilized parcels in the Union‚ÄìMiles Park industrial district. Although polluted properties were uncommon, most of the vacant/underutilized parcels have brownfield problems and are not ready for development. Union‚ÄìMiles Park no longer has any core retail areas. Little retail exists, and it is widely dispersed. As of 2004, there were about 1,400 vacant retail parcels in the neighborhood. Economic and social geography of the neighborhood The Union‚ÄìMiles Park neighborhood is somewhat close to both downtown Cleveland and the University Circle arts and museum area, but the neighborhood is relatively isolated from both of them. The only major north‚Äìsouth road through the neighborhood is E. 93rd Street, which is in poor condition, does not extend to University Circle, and which has two active at-grade railroad crossings. Harvard, Miles, and Union Avenues, the major east‚Äìwest roads, are in relatively good condition but provide no access to downtown. The many railroad lines also isolate the neighborhood from the surrounding city and suburbs. Abandoning or changing the route of these rail lines, and eliminating the numerous at-grade crossings in the neighborhood, are not currently feasible. Public transportation in Union‚ÄìMiles Park consists solely of RTA bus lines which operate on Harvard Avenue, Miles Avenue, Union Avenue, Kinsman Road, E. 93rd Street, and E. 116th Street. There is no Rapid light rail station in the neighborhood. Notable residents and places The Cermak Building, which opened in 1906, is an NRHP site within the Union‚ÄìMiles Park neighborhood.

The electric cooperative was founded in 1945 and is headquartered in Buxton. Electricity Cape Hatteras Electric Cooperative distributes electricity to 7,000 members on Hatteras and Ocracoke islands, both of which are barrier islands that are situated between the Atlantic Ocean and the Pamlico Sound in the Outer Banks region of the state of North Carolina. As an electric cooperative, Cape Hatteras Electric Cooperative is owned by the members who it provides electricity to. Cape Hatteras Electric Cooperative is a Touchstone Energy Cooperative and a member of the North Carolina Electric Membership Corporation (NCEMC), an electric generation and transmission cooperative that supplies electricity to most of North Carolina's electric cooperatives. Cape Hatteras Electric Cooperative receives its electricity supply from underground cables attached to the Herbert C. Bonner Bridge over the Oregon Inlet that connect to the Dominion North Carolina Power electric system. A diesel generation plant operated by the NCEMC is located in Buxton and is used during peak demand times and also to provide limited backup power to Cape Hatteras Electric Cooperative during times of transmission maintenance or emergencies. History Cape Hatteras Electric Cooperative was founded in 1945 to provide electricity to Hatteras Island, most of which lacked electricity at the time as investor-owned utilities did not find it profitable to serve the island. Prior to 1945, the only place on the island that had electricity was Hatteras Village. Originally, generators were the only power source on Hatteras Island, resulting in frequent power outages. In the 1960s, electric lines were constructed across the Herbert C. Bonner Bridge. A new cable across the bridge was built in 1995 at a cost of $10 million. In recent years, utility poles have been raised and new substations have been constructed. A new power line will be installed after the new Herbert C. Bonner Bridge is completed. On July 27, 2017, a crew working on constructing a new Herbert C. Bonner Bridge severed the underground cable serving Cape Hatteras Electric Cooperative, causing a widespread power outage on Hatteras and Ocracoke islands. The power outage resulted in tourists being evacuated from Hatteras and Ocracoke islands during the peak of the summer vacation season. During the outage, a state of emergency was declared while residents were mandated to conserve their energy use, with emergency generators serving the islands. Power to Hatteras and Ocracoke islands was restored on August 3, with tourists allowed to return the next day. A $10.53 million settlement was reached, with PCL Civil Constructors denying guilt. The new bridge was completed and opened to traffic on February 25, 2019, although some minor work remained to be performed, and a dedication ceremony was held on April 2, 2019 with NC Governor Roy Cooper as the keynote speaker. However, it was not Herbert C. Bonner, but long-time NC state senator and leader Marc Basnight who was recognized in the naming ceremony. Despite some objection from Hatteras Island residents and officials, and a NC BOT rule requiring unanimous consent by Dare County, the NC Board of Transportation made an exception and voted to name it after Senator Basnight, thus it is now the Marc Basnight Bridge over Oregon Inlet.https://www.outerbanksvoice.com/2019/03/07/board-of-transportation-oks- naming-new-bridge-for-basnight/ https://www.outerbanksvoice.com/2019/04/02/celebration-honors-basnight-and-a- legacy-built-to-last-a-century/ References External links * Companies based in North Carolina Energy companies established in 1945 Electric power companies of the United States Electric cooperatives of the United States 1945 establishments in North Carolina American companies established in 1945 ","title":"Cape Hatteras Electric Cooperative"},{"id":"55127526","text":"Tri-City United High School is a public school located in Montgomery, Minnesota, United States.

Kolchuk's career saw a variety of highs and lows, but he eventually compiled a distinguished record of service. Biography Kolchuk was born in western Belorussia in 1894, and was called up to the Tsar's army in 1915, but led a battalion of Red Guards in the revolution in Petrograd in 1917. While serving as a Red Guard he had the misfortune to be captured while fighting the White forces of Admiral Kolchak. He spent ten months in captivity before being conscripted into Kolchak's army in March, 1919, but soon deserted and joined the Red Army in May. He took command of a battalion on the Turkestan front later that year, and then in the Polish-Soviet War in 1920, where he was wounded in action. After the Civil War ended, Kolchuk graduated from the Vystrel Officers Course in 1924 and the Frunze Academy in 1931. During the 1920s he commanded each rifle regiment of the 24th Rifle Division in turn, and later the 4th Turkestan Rifle Regiment of the 2nd Rifle Division. Following the Frunze course he was appointed to command of Far Eastern Front's 6th Separate Railroad Exploration Brigade until April, 1936, and eventually earned the Order of the Red Banner of Labour. During the Great Purge, Kolchuk was arrested in July, 1938, on charges of disloyalty and was sentenced to two years imprisonment. He was released into the reserves in July, 1941, and was first given command of the 182nd Reserve Rifle Regiment of Southern Front. On May 8, 1942, still carrying his pre-war rank of Kombrig, he took command of the 353rd Rifle Division, which he held until May 30, 1944, being promoted to Major General on November 17, 1942. He led his division through the campaigns in southern Ukraine until he was appointed to command of the 37th Rifle Corps in 46th Army. He held this post for the duration of the war, advancing through the Balkan states and into Austria. After the war he commanded rifle corps until 1950, finishing his career as chief of the 1st Automobile School. He retired in 1953 and died at Vinnytsia in Ukraine in 1972, at the age of 77.David M.

Dsup suppresses X-ray-induced DNA damage by approximately 40% and improves tolerance to radiation. Tardigrades can withstand 1,000 times more radiation than other animals, median lethal doses of 5,000 Gy (of gamma rays) and 6,200 Gy (of heavy ions) in hydrated animals (5 to 10 Gy could be fatal to a human). The only explanation found in earlier experiments for this ability was that their lowered water state provides fewer reactants for ionizing radiation. However, subsequent research found that tardigrades, when hydrated, still remain highly resistant to shortwave UV radiation in comparison to other animals, and that one factor for this is their ability to efficiently repair damage to their DNA resulting from that exposure. The Dsup protein has been tested on other animal cells. Using a culture of human cells that express the Dsup protein, it was found that after X-ray exposure the cells had fewer DNA breaks than control cells.  Function and structure  The Dsup from Ramazzottius varieornatus is mainly used for study, since it is one of the most stress-tolerant species. Orthologous versions of Dsup are also found in Hypsibius exemplaris (OQV24709, ). Dsup does not exhibit a lot of secondary structure, save for the helix in the middle. The C-terminal half contains an NLS, and this Ala/Gly-rich half is sufficient for DNA binding. It is probably mostly disordered, but it has a lot of positive charge. Dsup is known to bind to free DNA, but it binds more tightly to nucleosomes, the typical packed form of DNA in eukaryotic cells. Its nucleosome binding domain is vaguely similar to the one in HMGN proteins. Molecular dynamic simulation of Dsup in complex with DNA shows that it is an intrinsically disordered protein. Its flexibility and electrostatic charge helps it bind to DNA and from aggregates.

It was discovered by astronomer William Herschel on March 15, 1784. NGC 4647 is listed along with Messier 60 as being part of a pair of galaxies called Arp 116; their designation in Halton Arp's Atlas of Peculiar Galaxies. The galaxy is located on the outskirts of the Virgo Cluster. Interaction with Messier 60 In optical images, the two galaxies disks overlap. This has suggested an ongoing interaction, however images do not reveal any signs of star formation which would have been caused by a tidal interaction between the two galaxies. Recent studies of Hubble images made in 2012 of the two galaxies indicate that tidal interactions between the two have just begun. Interstellar medium of NGC 4647 The gas in NGC 4647 has been mildly disturbed. The galaxy's location in the Virgo Cluster suggests that might it suffered an effect known as ram-pressure stripping caused by the intracluster medium. Another explanation may be hot gas in the halo of Messier 60. The hot gas in Messier 60 may have increased the pressure of gas on the eastern side of NGC 4647 through either ram- pressure striping or a bow-shock between the two galaxies causing the observed asymmetry of gas in the galaxy. The difficulty is that the galaxies would have to be so close that tidal forces from Messier 60 would cause the disk of NGC 4647 to get ripped apart.

History The Xalda is one of the oldest sheep breeds in Spain. It is first recorded in 27 BCE, by the Greek historian Estruban, who wrote of black tunics being made by the Asturi tribe out of the Xalda's wool. The Xalda likely traces its lineage back to the ancient Ovis aries celticus, and is related to other sheep of Celtic origin, including the Ouessant, the Black Wales, the morite, and several German breeds. Most of its related Iberian ancestors are extinct, with one notable exception being the very rare Bordaleira of Northern Portugal. The sheep used to be very popular within its native range, with an estimated 6,000 being alive in the 12th century. During its height, the Xalda was an important part of the culture and history of Asturias. However, the breed began to decline in numbers by the 1940s due to abandonment of the countryside in its native range. It also faced competition from specialty dairy breeds, which became popular among cheese makers. Whatever the reason for the decline, by 1980 only 800 purebred Xalda remained, and by the founding of the breeders association in 1992, only 400 purebred animals remained. Characteristics The Xalda is a small, highly agile sheep, with rams usually weighing around 33 kg and standing 61 cm tall and ewes weighing around 22 kg and measuring 51 cm tall. Their wool is usually black or white, but can take on a reddish tint as they grow. Although it is rare, they can be gray in color, as well. Black and gray individuals can have spots on heir heads. It has a similar phenotype to other Celtic sheep breeds in the Atlantic arc. Uses The Xalda is often raised for meat. The meat from Xalda lambs is generally regarded to be of a very high quality. The meat possesses an extremely high protein content and is very tender. They were also raised for wool during the breeds peak, and in some towns their wool would comprise almost all the town's clothing. Conservation Status At the height of the breed's population, the Xalda was very widespread in Asturias, with an estimated 6,000 living in the 12th century. However, the breed decreased in popularity due to abandonment of the countryside in its native range and competition from more commercially viable breeds. By the 1980s, only 800 head remained, and by time the breeders association was founded in 1992, there were only 400 Xalda left. However, the founding if the Xalda breeders association in 1992, ACOXA (Asociaci√≤n de Criadores d'Oveya Xalda) helped the efforts to conserve the breed greatly, although it still suffers from a lack of genetic diversity. Nonetheless, the breed's population has increased greatly in recent years, and numbers around 1,700 today.

Smith is an American children's book author. He is the author of Hoodoo (2015), The Mesmerist (2017), and Black Panther: The Young Prince (2018). For Hoodoo, Smith won the American Library Association's Coretta Scott King/John Steptoe Award for New Talent.  Early life  Smith was born in Maine to a military family that moved frequently; he also lived in Japan, Alabama, Michigan, Washington, DC, South Carolina, and Delaware, among other places. His love of fantasy and science fiction novels began as a child, but he first worked as a writer in advertising before turning to writing children's fiction.  Fiction career  Smith published his first book, Hoodoo, with Clarion Books in 2015. Set in the 1930s Alabama, Hoodoo earned Smith the American Library Association's Coretta Scott King/John Steptoe Award for New Talent. Smith's second book, The Mesmerist (Clarion Books, 2017), is set in London at the turn of the century. In January 2018, Smith published a children's novel for Marvel Comics featuring Marvel's superhero Black Panther. The book, Black Panther: The Young Prince, was released just prior to Marvel's Black Panther film. Reviewing the book in the Bulletin of the Center for Children's Literature, Kate Quealy-Gainer wrote, \\"Fans will notice allusions to T'Challa's future adventures as the ruling Black Panther, but even the comic-book averse will relate to T'Challa's negotiating of middle-school dynamics and may also appreciate his cleverness as he faces down his enemies.\\" The School Library Journal named the book to a list of eight fantasy \\"must-reads\\" featuring a black protagonist; their January 2018 review called it a \\"must-purchase for all collections.\\"  Personal life  Smith lives in Baltimore.

Early life  Auction site Christie's declared it to be a portrait of Pancrazio Buciun√¨ Reverse stamp of one of von Gloeden's works, bearing a stamp of Pancrazio Buciun√¨ When Wilhelm von Gloeden arrived in the hilltop city of Taormina overlooking the Ionian Sea, he engaged the services of a local boy, Pancrazio Buciun√¨, named after Pancras of Taormina. The fourteen year old was already extremely handsome, with dark skin and large eyes. Von Gloeden nicknamed him \\"Il Moro\\" (The Moor) because of his Arabic heritage. Il Moro first became one of von Gloeden's models, then assistant, pupil and eventually lover. The couple were in love. The young Buciun√¨ looked after von Gloeden when he was sick, administering medications, getting special food from townspeople, preparing the salt water baths that doctors prescribed. He also arranged for local youths to participate in the midnight parties von Gloeden threw for his guests.  First World War  When Italy entered the First World War, Gloeden had to leave the country. He left his home and studio in the care of Buciun√¨ until his return in 1919. Buciun√¨ was conscripted into the Royal Italian Army when the war began. Since he was in his thirties, he was not sent to the front, but was posted to a coastal artillery unit near Taormina. Thus, he was able to look after the villa and maintain the studio. Buciun√¨ and von Gloeden were able to communicate with the help of a Swiss friend. Since Italy and Germany were at war, letters could not be sent directly. Wilhelm mailed them to neutral Switzerland. Then letters were resent to Pancrazio. This mail exchange continued for almost the entire war. There was no political or military information in the letters, but when some were opened in a routine check, Italian authorities suspected something. Buciun√¨ wrote to von Gloeden about the house and the animals, with details about the conduct of \\"the crow\\" and \\"the dove\\". He also wrote about models, referring to them by first names. Some suspected this was part of an espionage network. As a result, Buciun√¨ was arrested on charges of treason. He was imprisoned for three months at a military prison and faced court-martial as a spy with capital punishment if convicted. Despite interrogations, during which he was threatened with shooting, if he did not tell who were the persons with \\"cover\\" names, he convinced the military he was loyal. Buciun√¨ was sent back to serve with his artillery unit and was also allowed to resume correspondence with von Gloeden.  After First World War  Von Gloeden returned to Taormina in 1919, as soon as the war ended. He continued to photograph till 1930 with Pancrazio Buciun√¨ always by his side. When von Gloeden died in 1931, Buciun√¨ was named as his heir. He received all his personal belongings and about 3,000 photographic glass plates. Buciun√¨ was married and had children.  During the Mussolini regime  At the end of the 1920s, when the Vatican formed an alliance with the fascist government, some 1,000 glass negatives and about 2,000 prints from von Gloeden's inheritance were confiscated and destroyed by police as obscene. The so-called vice campaign started in 1936. The police raided Il Moro's home. Over 1,000 of the master glass negatives were destroyed, while he wept. He was accused of keeping pornography and arrested. Buciun√¨ was charged and put on trial. The same as with his treason case he was able to defend himself and von Gloeden's memory, telling the court that it was not competent to judge works of art. He listed collectors who kept those photographs, including Italian museums and critics, as well as the Ministry of Education itself. The court acquitted him, but this couldn't save the destroyed works. Il Moro distributed the remaining plates among local families, priests and institutions.  After World War II  Photo from tomb of Pancrazio Buciun√¨ in Taormina When Buciun√¨ reassembled his collection after World War II ended, he found that only one third of the works was saved. Others were destroyed or disappeared. Little is known about Il Moro's life after his trials and World War II. When Roger Peyrefitte visited Taormina in the 1940s, he mentioned Pancrazio Buciun√¨ in his novel, telling that: \\"His faithful Moro, today a simple fisherman, working at what many of his countrymen do (fishing)\\". Pancrazio Buciun√¨ died in 1963. His descendants still live in Taormina and keep part of his collection. Some 800 remnants of von Gloeden's work, that belonged to Il Moro, including 800 glass negatives and 200 albumen prints, were moved to the archive of Lucio Amelio in Naples.

Relations were first commenced in 1973. Diplomatic representation Qatari embassy in Berlin By January 1973, just two years after Qatar gained its independence, Germany was among the eighteen countries that Qatar appointed an ambassador to. Qatar has had an embassy in Berlin since 2005. It is headed by Saoud bin Abdulrahman Al Thani as of 2017. Germany has an embassy in Doha, which is headed by Hans-Udo Muzel as of 2017. Diplomatic visits In 1999, sheikh Hamad bin Khalifa Al Thani visited Germany, marking the first time the Qatari leadership made an official visit to the country. President of Germany Johannes Rau paid a visit to Qatar in 2001, and in 2002 Sigmar Gabriel, the Prime Minister of Lower Saxony, also visited Qatar. The first German chancellor to travel to Qatar on an official capacity was Gerhard Schr√∂der, who did so in 2005. During his visit, the two countries signed a security agreement. Emir Tamim bin Hamad Al Thani visited Angela Merkel in September 2017 to discuss the 2017 Qatari diplomatic crisis. Merkel expressed \\"great concerns\\" over the dispute and the absence of any immediately foreseeable resolution. Diplomatic relations Political In August 2014, Gerd M√ºller, German Minister of Development, alleged that Qatar was funding ISIS militants. Following the comments, Germany said that it \\"regrets\\" the remarks made by M√ºller, and that it did not wish for any misunderstandings. One day after Germany commented on the minister's statements, Qatar denounced ISIS and claimed that it does not provide funding of any kind. =2017 Qatari diplomatic crisis= On 6 June 2017, German FM Sigmar Gabriel condemned the Saudi-led boycott of Qatar. In July, he called on the blockading countries to respect Qatar's rights as a sovereign nation, and applauded its prudence in responding to the blockade. As part of an effort to allay its neighbors concerns about its alleged funding of terrorist groups, on 5 July, Qatar agreed to provide German intelligence agencies with virtually all of its information and data. Military In April 2013, Qatar signed a $2.5 billion deal with German defense company Krauss-Maffei Wegmann to purchase 62 Leopard tanks. Almost half of the tanks had been delivered to Qatar by October 2016. In early 2019 Germany announced that it had approved the sale of the RIM-116 Rolling Airframe Missile (RAM) weapon system to Qatar. The deal was criticized by opposition lawmakers citing ongoing human rights concerns in the Persian Gulf region. Announcement of the deal came amidst a freeze on German weapons sales to Saudi Arabia in the wake of the assassination of Jamal Khashoggi. Business and investment Qatar has made large-scale investments in some of Germany's most prominent companies, including Volkswagen, Siemens and Deutsche Bank. The Qatar German Business Forum was inaugurated in 2000, and a joint economic commission between the two countries was set up in 2007. In 2015, Germany accounted for 7.3% of Qatar's foreign trade volume. Qatar's main export to Germany is liquefied natural gas. Germany's main exports to Qatar are motor vehicles and machinery. Arts and culture The Qatar Germany 2017 Year of Culture was an initiative organized by Qatar Museums Authority to enhance cultural ties between Qatar and Germany. The first joint event was a performance by the Qatar Philharmonic Orchestra, which was directed by German conductor David Niemann. They played both German and Qatari music at the Katara Opera House.

The United States Geological Survey reported an earthquake of 6.3-magnitude not far from North Korea's Punggye-ri nuclear test site. South Korean authorities said the earthquake seemed to be artificial, consistent with an underground nuclear test. The USGS, as well as China Earthquake Networks Center, reported that the initial event was followed by a second, smaller, earthquake at the site, several minutes later, which was characterized as a collapse of the cavity formed by the initial detonation.  Nuclear device  Order to conduct the test, signed by Kim Jong-un on 3 September 2017 The North Korean government announced that it had detonated a hydrogen (thermonuclear) bomb that could be loaded onto an intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM). The announcement stated the warhead had a variable yield \\"the explosive power of which is adjustable from tens kiloton to hundreds kiloton (sic) ... [and] which can be detonated even at high altitudes for super-powerful EMP attack\\". A later technical announcement called the device a \\"two-stage thermo-nuclear weapon\\" and stated experimental measurements were fully compatible with the design specification, and there had been no leakage of radioactive materials from the underground nuclear test. Photographs of North Korean leader Kim Jong-un inspecting a device resembling a thermonuclear weapon warhead were released a few hours before the test. Analysts have tended to give credence to North Korea's claim that it was a hydrogen bomb. 38 North made a revised estimate for the test yield at 250 kT, making it near the maximum-containable yield for the Punggye-ri test site. Tom Plant, director of proliferation and nuclear policy at the Royal United Services Institute said, \\"The North Koreans do bluff sometimes, but when they make a concrete claim about their nuclear programme, more often than not it turns out to be true. ... I think the balance is in favour of it being a thermonuclear bomb rather than a conventional atom bomb.\\" Others have been skeptical that it was a completely successful test of a true hydrogen bomb as North Korea claimed. Determining whether it is a two-stage thermonuclear bomb or a fusion-boosted fission weapon may not be possible without radionucleide emission data. The yield estimates of less than 300 kT would be lower than any other nation's first test of a fusion-primary thermonuclear device, which would typically be in the 1000 kT range, while boosted fission weapons and variable-yield nuclear devices can be as low as hundreds of tons, but are not considered true hydrogen bombs; meanwhile the largest pure-fission bomb tested was Ivy King at 500 kT. An October 2 Scientific American article said the test was \\"estimated to have been a 160-kiloton detonation ‚Äî far below an H-bomb's capabilities.\\" While this assertion appears to be the author's, it is preceded and followed with quotations from Edwin Lyman of the Union of Concerned Scientists' Global Security Program. Martin Navias of the Centre for Defence Studies at King's College London noted that the breakthroughs needed to get from a fission to a fusion device would have to be done by the North Koreans on their own ‚Äì China, Russia, Pakistan, and Iran would not or could not help. Jane's Information Group estimates a North Korean thermonuclear Teller-Ulam type bomb would weigh between . http://www.janes.com/images/assets/111/75111/North_Korea_bargains_with_nuclear_diplomacy.pdf As of January 2018 there have been no official announcements from the United States confirming or contradicting the detonation of a hydrogen bomb. However, on 15 September 2017 John E. Hyten, head of U.S. Strategic Command, said, \\"When I look at a thing this size, I as a military officer assume that it's a hydrogen bomb.\\"  Yield estimates  On the day of the test the chief of the South Korean parliament's defense committee, Kim Young-Woo, stated the nuclear yield was equivalent to about 100 kilotons of TNT (100 kt): \\"The North's latest test is estimated to have a yield of up to 100 kilotons, though it is a provisional report.\\" The independent seismic monitoring agency NORSAR estimated that the blast had a yield of about 120 kilotons, based on a seismic magnitude of 5.8. On 4 September, the academics from the University of Science and Technology of China released their findings based on seismic results and concluded that the nuclear test occurred at at 03:30 UTC, only a few hundred meters from the four previous tests (2009, 2013, January 2016 and September 2016) with the estimated yield at 108.1 ¬± 48.1 kt. On 5 September, the Japanese government gave a yield estimate of about 160 kilotons, based on analysing Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty Organization seismic data, replacing an early estimate of 70 kilotons. On 6 September, an early assessment by U.S. Intelligence that the yield was 140 kilotons, with an undisclosed margin of error, was reported. On 13 September, U.S. Intelligence was reported referring to an early yield estimate range of 70 to 280 kilotons made by the Air Force Technical Applications Center. On 12 September, NORSAR revised its estimate of the earthquake magnitude upward to 6.1, matching that of the CTBTO, but less powerful than the USGS estimate of 6.3. Its yield estimate was revised to 250 kilotons, while noting the estimate had some uncertainty and an undisclosed margin of error. On 13 September, an analysis of before and after synthetic-aperture radar satellite imagery of the test site was published suggesting the test occurred under of rock and the yield \\"could have been in excess of 300 kilotons\\". In October 2019 a paper by the Indian Space Research Organization was published using satellite interferometric synthetic-aperture radar data to analyse surface deformations using Bayesian modelling to reduce uncertainties. It found that the explosion depth was 542 ¬± 30 metres below Mount Mantap, and the yield was 245‚Äì271 kilotons.  Reactions  The United Nations Security Council met in an open emergency meeting on 4 September 2017, at the request of the US, South Korea, Japan, France and the UK. Canada, China, Indonesia, Japan, Malaysia, the Philippines, Russia, Singapore, South Korea, and the United States voiced strong criticism of the nuclear test. US President Donald Trump wrote on Twitter: \\"North Korea has conducted a major nuclear test. Their words and actions continue to be very hostile and dangerous to the United States\\". Trump was asked whether the U.S. would attack North Korea and replied: \\"We'll see.\\" Defense Secretary James Mattis warned North Korea that it would be met with a \\"massive military response\\" if it threatened the United States or its allies.
