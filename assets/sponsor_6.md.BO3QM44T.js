Both √Ülfthryth and Ethelred were instrumental in establishing Cholsey Abbey: an act of expiation for Edward's death.

In the 1920 U. S. Census his occupation was described as \\"Coal Miner & Ice Retailer.\\" Rubel emigrated to America in 1904 from Riga, Latvia, at the age of 23. Rubel started his career selling coal and ice with a horse-drawn wagon in the tenements in the East New York section of Brooklyn. Samuel Rubel married Dora Nachumowitz; the two had two daughters. Rubel became the head of the Pocono Mountain Ice Company based in Hoboken, New Jersey, which became the leading ice company in the Pennsylvania and New Jersey area, buying up many of the smaller ice companies. Beginning in the 1930s with the advent of refrigeration, the harvesting of the ice from lakes became less and less profitable. Eventually, the ice companies folded, and Rubel switched his focus to other fields (such as brewing). Rubel died on April 29, 1949. He was president of the Ebling Brewing Company at the time of his death and his net worth was estimated at $8,000,000. Rubel was a supporter of the Boy Scouts of America.

It occupies an area of acres (3 ha), and was once an affluent suburb, until the 19th-century Industrial Revolution altered the social standing of the area and introduced poverty and disease. Regeneration of the park in the 2000s has created a gateway into the Irk Valley.  History  St Michael and All Angels' church was built in 1788 by Humphrey Owen to seat just over a thousand people. Its foundation stone was laid on 20 May 1788 and it was consecrated on 23 July 1789. Almost twenty years later in 1808, a letter appeared in the Manchester Guardian declaring \\"Why one of the ugliest churches in Manchester situated in one of the most crowded and notorious parts of the City, should have so long enjoyed the pleasant sounding name 'St Michael's, Angel Meadow' is beyond understanding\\".Extract from North and East Manchester article, December 28, 1808 The land adjacent to the church became the largest cemetery in Manchester, used for the interment of those who had no family place of burial or were too poor to afford a proper funeral. The population density of Angel Meadow in the mid-19th century was in excess of 350 per acre, and as social and living conditions worsened some resorted to digging up the cemetery and selling its soil as fertilizer to nearby farmers. The situation became so bad that the Burial Act of 1855 was passed to cover up graveyards with flagstones, hence the name St Michael's Flags. In 1844, the Oldham Road terminus of the Manchester-Leeds Railway was abandoned and the line extended through Collyhurst to a new link station at Hunts Bank ‚Äì the first Victoria Station. A railway viaduct traversed Angel Meadow, whilst the obnoxious smells from the Irk and Irwell and the Gould street gas works darkened the landscape. Ragged schools, such as Charter Street and Sharp Street, and other institutes for abandoned, destitute and neglected children, flourished in the area: Alexis de Tocqueville, a French political thinker and historian, best known for his Democracy in America (two volumes: 1835 and 1840) and The Old Regime and the Revolution (1856), explored the effects of the rising inequalities in social conditions on the individual and the state in western societies; he visited Manchester in 1835, describing it in his work of the same year Journeys to England And Ireland. Friedrich Engels was born in 1820 as the son of a successful German industrialist. As a young man his father sent him to England to help manage his cotton factory in Salford. Engels was shocked by the poverty in the city and began writing an account that was published as the Condition of the Working Classes in England (1844). His account includes a graphic description of the pauper burial ground at St. Michael's Flags. Engels later collaborated with Karl Marx, which resulted in the Communist Manifesto. St Michael's Church closed in 1930 and the site was sold on condition that the church building was demolished. Demolition was carried out in 1935. In 1940 Angel Meadow was subject to German bombing.Kirby, p. 176  Regeneration  Friends of Angel Meadow (FOAM) was formed in 2004 to campaign for the regeneration of the park and to research the history of the area. Over ¬£200,000 was raised through grants and match funding, which was spent re- landscaping the park, installing street furniture including seating and bins, erecting four solar-powered street lights, an arched entrance way and planting wildflowers. A Local Heritage Grant of ¬£24,000 paid for six history boards and the publication of an information booklet. In the spring of 2006, the park hosted the BBC and Manchester Leisure's Springwatch Festival of Nature. Since 2006 it has attained Green Flag Award status, the national award for green spaces in England and Wales. On 1 May 2010, the park was used as a location by artist Spencer Tunick for his installation Everyday People, part of The Lowry's 10th Anniversary celebration. Oxford Archaeology carried out excavations around the park in 2009 and 2012, revealing the basements of homes and business in the area from the 1800s. The Royal Geographical Society Discovering Britain series of walks: Slums, Squalor and Salvation guides people around the park and wider neighbourhood. In August 2012, BBC television broadcast scenes of the area as part of Michael Wood's The Great British Story: A People's History (Episode 8 Industry & Empire). A second phase of funding for the park has been secured and work should be completed by early summer 2014. This work will include repairing the Aspin Lane wall and opening up the steps into the park, often referred to as the Lowry Steps (as L S Lowry depicted them in several of his works). The Co-operative Group is also funding a significant programme of work in 2015 to rebuild the front entrance and improve the whole park overall. This is being funded from the grant given to The Co-operative from the European Regional Development Fund to create the NOMA district of Manchester city centre.

The pagoda was first built by the Mon around the same time as was Shwedagon Pagoda‚Äîaccording to local belief, over 2500 years ago, and was known as Kyaik-de-att in Mon language. The pagoda is hollowed within, and houses what is believed to be a sacred hair of Gautama Buddha. The Botataung Pagoda was completely destroyed during World War II, and was rebuilt after the war. History According to Burmese tradition, it was on a hillock at this site that one thousand military officers of the king were drawn up as a guard of honor to welcome the landing in Burma of the relics of the Buddha brought over from India more than two thousand years ago. An account from ancient histories of the building of the Pagoda states that the Buddhist king Sihadipa gave one of his ministers a sacred hair from the Buddha's head and two body relics and this minister, renowned for his goodness and faith, consulted a famous religious leader and, on his advice, chose the Botataung Mount on the bank of Yangon River at a distance one thousand tars (7,000 cubits) in a South-Easterly direction from the Shwedagon Pagoda and there enshrined the sacred relics. World War II The pagoda was completely destroyed on 8 November 1943 when the RAF, which was bombing the nearby Yangon wharves also hit the pagoda. The pagoda was left in \\"blackened ruins\\". Rebuilding Rebuilding of the pagoda started on the same day that the country gained independence from the UK: 4 January 1948. Part of the excavation process, a relic chamber was discovered. The chamber in size 20' x 20' and 6 in height gradually decreasing in size towards the top and appearing like a huge pot placed up-sided down to cover completely what lay inside. In the very center of this treasure vault was discovered a wonderful stone casket in the shape of a pagoda with a diameter of 23 ins, and 39 ins, high. Encircling this stone casket were figures of nats carved out of laterite and evidently placed there to act as sentinels. The casket was immersed in mud as water had trickled into the vault during the many centuries it had been there. With this pagoda-shaped stone casket within the relic chamber were found various kinds of treasures: precious stones, ornaments, jewellery, terracotta plaques and images of gold, silver, brass and stone. The total number of these images recovered from within and without the relic chamber was seven hundred. The terracotta plaques, some of them in a fair state of preservation, depict Buddhist scenes. One of the terracotta plaques excavated from the relic chamber bears an image of the Lord Buddha and though affected by age and moisture it is exceptionally important. On the reverse side are inscribed characters which are very close to the ancient Brahmani script which came from Southern India. It is a precious evidence of ancient times and has been deciphered by U Lu Pe Win, Superintendent Archaeologist, Government of the Union of Burma, who points out that the initial word \\"e\\" from \\"evam vadi\\" shows that the script is in the manner of the ancient Mons. This is proof of the belief that the people who erected the Pagoda in ancient times were the Mons. When this cone or stone layer was removed there was found inside another stone layer of similar shape but with a brilliant gold coating and this was more representative of a pagoda in shape while its exquisite workmanship and brilliance inspired feelings of deep religious fervor in the crowd present. Some mud had penetrated even here and the sides of the base were covered with this and when it was washed and sifted precious stones and gold and jewellery were discovered round the base. This second stone casket was then removed and inside was found a small pagoda of pure gold standing on a silver salver or base and beside this golden pagoda was a carved stone image 4¬Ω ins. high of very ancient workmanship. When the gold Pagoda was lifted up, a tiny gold cylinder of length with a diameter of . was found and in this tiny cylinder were found two small body relics each the size of a mustard seed and what is believed to be a Sacred Hair of the Buddha. This hair was coiled round and fastened with a little lacquer on which were traces of gold plaster. Structure Panoramic view of Botataung area The new pagoda is of original design and in height , on a base of x . The main attraction is the stupa's hollow inside, which has a mirrored maze-like walkway lined with glass showcases containing many ancient relics and artifacts that were sealed inside the earlier pagoda.

It is the main part of the radio-ulnar syndesmosis, a fibrous joint between the two bones. Function The interosseous membrane divides the forearm into anterior and posterior compartments, serves as a site of attachment for muscles of the forearm, and transfers loads placed on the forearm. The interosseous membrane is designed to shift compressive loads (as in doing a hand-stand) from the distal radius to the proximal ulna. The fibers within the interosseous membrane are oriented obliquely so that when force is applied the fibers are drawn taut, shifting more of the load to the ulna. This reduces the wear and tear of placing the whole load on a single joint. The role of the membrane in load shifting is illustrated when the interosseous membrane is cut; the forces on each bone equalize from their natural proportions. Additionally, as the forearm moves from pronation to supination, the interosseous membrane fibers change from a relaxed state, to a tense state in the neutral position. They once again become relaxed as the forearm enters pronation. The interosseous membrane is composed of five ligaments: # - Central band (key portion to be reconstructed in case of injury) # - Accessory band # - Distal oblique bundle # - Proximal oblique cord # - Dorsal oblique accessory cord  Injury  The interosseous membrane is composed of 5 ligaments:- Central band (key portion to be reconstructed in case of injury)- Accessory band- Distal oblique bundle- Proximal oblique cord- Dorsal oblique accessory cordSevere forearm injuries involving separation of the radius and ulna may be due to rupture of the interosseous membrane. Rupture can lead to proximal migration of the radius and an apparent lengthening of the ulna at the wrist. Often interosseous membrane tears are associated with adverse impacts on forearm rotation. MRI-assisted diagnosis has been used for mid- substance tears of the interosseous membrane but is expensive and not widely available. On the contrary, ultrasound has proven useful in diagnosing tears of the tibiofibular interosseous membrane of the leg, and this technique may also be applied to acute cases of membrane tears in the forearm due to its low cost and portability.

It combines two unrelated plays ‚Äì a tragedy (Secret Love) and a comedy (The Peach Blossom Land) ‚Äì on the same stage, mixing seriousness with banters. This play starts with two drama troupes arranged to have a rehearsal at the same time by mistake; one of the workshops is playing the early-modern tragedy Secret Love, and the other one is playing the period comedy The Peach Blossom Spring based on a classical poem. The problem is, both these plays have to perform in two days. Since they have only one stage for their rehearsals, issues and conflicts follow. Secret Love for the Peach Blossom Spring creates a unique experience of stage play by mixing up the costume and modern, sorrow and delight. A feature of this play is that is it was extemporized by the director, Stan Lai, all actress and actors. The originality renewed the view of Taiwan's drama, and then affected the Asian performing arts. This play was first performed on March 3, 1986. In these twenty years, the play has been adapted to a movie and revised thrice: the first revision was in 1999, the second was in September 2006, and the third was in April 2015. Each performance has its own specificity. The first performance addressed the creation of style of modern play, the first revision in 1999 included some young performers and implied the translation between two generations of performer. The second revision in 2006 involved a famous Taiwanese opera (Ê≠å‰ªîÊà≤) group, Ming Hwa Yuan (ÊòéËèØÂúí). The combination between stage play and Taiwanese opera is another innovation of modern theatre in Taiwan. The third revision was also a translation to English, and was performed at the Oregon Shakespeare Festival. This adaption mentioned the issues with translation between languages and cultures, like the first revision which implied the translation between generations. It also added many location-specific jokes in the spirit of the play as an improvisation. The success of this play led to a film in 1992, directed also by Stan Lai. It stars Brigitte Lin and some of the actors from the stage version of the play, such as Chin Shih-chieh. The title is identical in Chinese but its English title is shortened to The Peach Blossom Land.

The game incorporates elements of wuxia, shenmo and fantasy. Since its release in 1995, the game has spawned a successful video game franchise in Taiwan and mainland China. It was also adapted into the 2005 Chinese television series Chinese Paladin. English translations of the game title The game title was unofficially translated into English as The Magic Sword and the Chivalrous Youngsters,Popular Title and Chinese Paladin. Softstar Entertainment officially named it The Legend of Sword and Fairy upon the release of the sequel.The English name of The Legend of Sword and Fairy 2. However, in the third and fourth instalments, the English title was changed to Chinese Paladin and has remained as such since then. The StarForce confirmation screen shows Chinese Paladin 4 The StarForce confirmation screen shows Chinese Paladin 3 Plot : Note: There are many subtle differences among the numerous versions of the game. The plot provided in this section is based on the version for Windows 95 and 98. Li Xiaoyao, the protagonist of the game, is an orphan who lives with his aunt in a small fishing village near Suzhou, China. When his aunt falls sick, Li travels across the sea to a mystical island in search of a cure for his aunt. He meets a maiden Zhao Ling'er, whom he falls in love with. Forced by Zhao's nanny to marry Zhao and remain on the island forever, he manages to escape with the medicine and succeeds in healing his aunt. However, he loses the memory of his encounter on the island after being tricked into consuming a memory-erasing drug. He meets Zhao again, saving her from a group of enemies, who have destroyed her home and murdered her nanny. He then decides to accompany her to southwestern China in search of her mother, who might still be alive. Li and Zhao arrive in Suzhou and meet Lin Yueru, the spoiled daughter of a wealthy martial artist. Li unexpectedly defeats Lin in a martial arts contest and wins her hand in marriage. When Li shows reluctance to marry Lin, her father threatens to kill him if he does not marry her, so Li pretends to agree, but plans to escape later. On their wedding night, a giant serpent is sighted and Zhao disappears under mysterious circumstances. Li and Lin believe that Zhao has been captured by a monster, so they set off in search of her and arrive in Sichuan, where the Mount Shu Sect, a powerful martial arts clan, is based. They learn that Zhao is actually a half-serpent spirit and has been imprisoned in the Demon Prison Tower by the Mount Shu elders. Li and Lin break into the tower and succeed in rescuing Zhao after making a perilous descent to its lowest level. However, they all suffer grave injuries when the tower collapses while they are escaping from it. The trio are saved by an herbal medicine guru, who tells Li that Zhao is pregnant with his child, and that Lin has died from her wounds. Li is deeply saddened by Lin's death, but he puts aside his grief because he has a more important mission to complete: find two rare items which can save the lives of Zhao and their unborn baby. Li's quest takes him to southwestern China, where the Miao people live. He meets and befriends Anu, a White Miao princess, who tells him the history of her homeland. The Miao land has been affected by a prolonged drought and the White and Black Miao are at war with each other over scarce resources. Li completes his mission and Zhao recovers, after which she summons a rainstorm and restores peace to the Miao land. Through their adventures, Li, Zhao and Anu discover that the drought was actually caused by an evil Black Miao cleric. They confront him and defeat him in a battle. During the battle, Zhao sacrifices herself to destroy an ancient water monster summoned by the cleric. Li is traumatised by the loss of Zhao and Lin. He bids Anu farewell and walks away alone. Just then, he sees Lin, carrying his child. Lin's reappearance at the end of the game is often disputed, but the official story released by Softstar Entertainment claims that Lin is dead and cannot be resurrected. However, her body may be brought back to life, but she will never be the same as before because her soul is dead. Gameplay The player guides the characters through China in landscapes consisting of cities, mazes, dungeons, cave tunnels and wilderness. The game has no overland map; entry points to subsequent locations can always be found on the current location's screen. The story is mostly linear. Once the player completes the quest associated with a particular location, there is usually no reason to return there. In most cases, return is impossible, because either the entrance is destroyed or the player travels to the next location via a game mechanic. Hidden items and quests are available, but they do not affect the story's progression. When the characters engage in combat, they are taken to a separate combat screen. Battles are purely turn-based. Certain ability scores of the combatants determine which party acts first, and then actions alternate between the player characters and the enemies. The actions taken during battles mainly consist of normal attacks and casting spells. The players may also defend, throw and use items, and steal from the enemies. Once the appropriate equipment is obtained, the player may also capture monsters to later turn them into beneficial items. The magic system contains the five elements of wind, lightning, ice, fire, and earth, which form the descriptors for the offensive spells, each type able to counter another. There are also spells of no elemental type. The player's equipment is primarily upgraded through treasures gained in mazes and acquisition from shops. Defeating monsters usually make negligible contributions to the player's inventory, but it is the primary source of money. Healing and combat support items can be made from captured monsters as well as bought. The player can also make poison-based weapons using certain types of venomous insects as raw material. Development The game was developed by the Kuangtu/Crazy Boys Production Team (ÁãÇÂæíË£Ω‰ΩúÁæ§) of Softstar Entertainment, with concept work beginning as early as 1991. The group consisted at that time approximately 12 members, some being very young with little experience in game design. The Legend of Sword and Fairy was their first major RPG project. The production manager was Yao Zhuangxian (ÂßöÂ£ØÊÜ≤), who was 22 years old at the time. The game's music was composed by Lin Kunxin, whose most memorable titles include The Butterfly's Love (Ëù∂ÊàÄ), Martial Arts Contest for Marriage (ÊØîÊ≠¶ÊãõË¶™), and Drunken Sword Master (ÈÖíÂäç‰ªô). Lin Jiawen, a graphics artist on the team, was the major contributor to character portraits and animation. She also enthusiastically participated in the designing of the mazes, but her expertise in that area was limited. Yao faced some turmoil in his love life during the game design process. This influenced him to integrate his own views of love into the game. Yao said, the three female protagonists are based on reality; Zhao Ling'er is like a girlfriend; Lin Yueru is like a lover, and Anu is like a mate. At some point, there arose a dispute regarding to the fate of two of the female characters in the end.‰∏Ä‰∫õÂΩìÂπ¥‰ªôÂâëÁöÑÂÜÖÈÉ®ËµÑÊñôÂíåÁãÇÂæíÂÜÖÈÉ®ÁöÑÁÅµÊúàÊàò‰∫â Á¨¨ÂçÅËâ∫ÊúØÂÖ¨Á§æ In the finished game, this matter was intentionally made ambiguous where Lin is shown standing under a tree in the ending cinematic even though she is supposedly dead. Yao commented that he invested a great deal of feeling into the story, and the unclear ending was meant to leave events open to the players' imagination. In the years that followed the game's release in 1995, Yao did not wish to openly address questions regarding the game's ending.Ê∞∏ÊÅí‰ªôÂâëÊÄÄÊóß‰∏ìÈ¢ò TOMÊ∏∏Êàè There was an anecdote about the ending: Yao was in favour of Zhao while another producer Xie Chonghui was preferred Lin. In Yao's blueprint of the whole game, the ending is that Lin's body is intact but her soul is destroyed while Zhao's body has disappeared but her soul exists. However, Xie disagreed with this setting. Eventually, this setting was broken by some final changes and the sequel indicated that Lin's body was preserved by a special type of insect. Reception The Legend of Sword and Fairy has been praised as the pioneer of Chinese RPGs. It has deeply affected a whole generation of Chinese, and established a particular Chinese style of story-telling and maze-running RPG. Many Chinese consider it to be one of the most classic RPG games ever made. In the first month following the game's release in Taiwan, The Legend of Sword and Fairy sold over 100,000 copies. Sales reached 350,000 copies in mainland China a month after the game's release there. The game's sales totalled about two million copies, but as many as 20 million copies may be in circulation due to piracy. The Legend of Sword and Fairy won numerous awards. In 1995, the game won the Best Role Playing Game award from the magazine CEM STAR and the Golden Bag Game award (ÈÅäÊàØÈ°ûÈáëË¢ãÂ•ñ) from KING TITLE. The Legend of Sword and Fairy was also on the top of the Best PC Game List of the New Gaming Era (Êñ∞ÈÅäÊàØÊôÇ‰ª£) magazine until October 1996, for 14 consecutive months; and topped the \\"My Favourite Singleplayer PC Game\\" list in the Pop Software (Â§ßË°ÜËªü‰ª∂) magazine for ten years.‰ªôÂâëÂ•á‰æ†‰º† Â§™Âπ≥Ê¥ãÊ∏∏ÊàèÁΩë The Legend of Sword and Fairy is best characterised as a very memorable tragedy. Its plot, especially the ending, has moved many players to tears. Zhao Ling'er's death and the question of whether or not Lin Yueru was successfully resurrected have fuelled an abundance of forum discussions and fan fiction. Yao Zhuangxian became reputed as the \\"Father of Xianjian\\", and many players reverently refer to him as \\"Immortal Yao\\". Due to popular demand, the Kuangtu production team released New Legend of Sword and Fairy in 2001. Minor changes were made to the storyline; and the graphics was greatly improved using better technology (new visual effects, reproduced music, some additional storyline details, etc.). The most significant and most requested addition was two new hidden endings. The game's success eventually led to the creation of the subsequent titles in The Legend of Sword and Fairy series, even somewhat against Yao's wishes. Famitsu magazine scored the Sega Saturn version of this game 6/6/4/5 for a total of 21. Versions MS-DOS version First released in 1995, it is often cited as the most successful video game in Taiwan and mainland China. Windows 95/98 version A re- release for the Windows 95/98 platforms. Some bugs (such as typos) in the former version were removed, and the whole difficulty reduced by simplification of mazes. Additionally, three-dimensional AVI clips were introduced in place of the original static pictures. Also, the RIX music used in the DOS version was replaced with MIDI tracks. Sega Saturn version This is a version designed for Sega Saturn console. New version This is a remake of the MS-DOS version, with minimal changes to the original story. Two alternate endings are dedicated to the two female protagonists of the story. Initial release was in 2001, titled as New Legend of Sword and Fairy (). It was re-released again as the New LSF XP version for the Windows XP platform. Spin-offs The Xianjian Inn An inn management simulation game released in 2001. The story is set in a lighthearted alternate universe based on the original game. The inn management portion of the game involves lodging and dining, and features day and night cycles with different available gameplay options. The female protagonists from the original game may also be taken on dates in the form of adventures in various locales. Chinese Paladin Online A MMORPG has been made and is currently in open beta in mainland China, Taiwan, Malaysia and Singapore. Adaptations In 2005, the game was adapted by Chinese Entertainment Shanghai into a television series titled Chinese Paladin, starring Hu Ge, Liu Yifei and Ady An.

He was appointed principal of St Peter's College, Wexford by Bishop Brendan Comiskey in 1988 despite his removal by Comiskey's predecessor, Bishop Donal J. Herlihy, following allegations of Collins sexually abusing pupils in his charge. The knowledge relating to the earlier allegations does not appear to have been made known to Comiskey. Collins was a science teacher in St Peters when allegations against him of sexual abuse involving pupils in the school dormitory were made in 1966. He was transferred to a parish in Westminster but the Bishop of Ferns, Donal J. Herlihy did not disclose that allegations had been lodged against Collins, an omission described by The Ferns Inquiry as warranting very serious criticism. Collins returned to St Peters in 1968 and was allowed to fully take up all duties associated with a teacher in a boarding school including mentoring pupils for the Young Scientists' Exhibition, facilitating school trips to the public swimming pool in Ferrybank, Wexford, and accompanying pupils on annual school tours abroad. His nickname among the students was \\"Slinker\\". Fourteen pupils are cited in the Ferns Report as being abused by Collins between the 1960s and early 1990s. The first report subsequent to the 1966 allegations came to Bishop Comiskey's attention within seven months of his appointment as Principal in 1988. Collins resigned as principal in 1991 after an anonymous letter was sent to Comiskey. Comiskey sent Collins for counselling to Florida in 1991. Collins was attached to a parish in Florida during that period. Collins admitted the abuse in 1993. He was charged in 1995 with 21 counts of indecent assault and gross indecency and one of buggery against four former pupils. Collins served a one-year jail sentence on conviction. He was laicised in 2004 (38 years after sex abuse allegations against him first surfaced). He took civil proceedings by way of judicial review in May 1996, seeking a prohibition of the hearing of the charges. That application was refused. In March 1998, he pleaded guilty to four charges of gross indecency and one of indecent assault. He was sentenced to four years imprisonment and served one year at the Curragh prison. He was released in 1999. Death Donal Collins was found dead in his home in County Wexford on the evening of 9 April 2010. Notice of death of Donal Collins, examiner.ie; accessed 16 November 2015. The Ferns Report Collins was cited in The Ferns Report as one of 12 priests involved in 100 cases of child sexual abuse in the diocese between 1962 and 2002. The Report explains that at least six priests in the Diocese of Ferns and associated with St Peters College were aware of troubling rumours concerning the reasons for Collins removal in 1966 but they did not notify Church authorities in the diocese of the potential danger posed by Collins when his appointment as Principal was suggested. No diocesan records were maintained concerning the removal of Collins from Ferns in 1966. When anonymous allegations against Collins first emerged and in the face of denial by Collins of the sexual allegations against him, Comiskey spent two years seeking evidence to substantiate these. Collins was finally removed in 1991. Comiskey also made erroneous statements to the Garda√≠ and media concerning Collins against the background of information available to Comiskey.

WRMC broadcasts a variety of content types, including talk, news, and radio drama, although the vast majority of the schedule is music of all genres. Shows are produced largely by student DJ's, although staff, faculty, and other members of the college and town community contribute content on occasion. Most shows last from one to two hours and generally air once a week. WRMC airs a reduced schedule during the summer, which includes shows produced by each of Middlebury College's summer language schools, broadcast entirely in the language of that school. The station also produces an annual music festival, called Sepomana. History WRMC debuted as a carrier current station on May 1, 1949 at 1:00 pm with the call sign \\"WMCRS\\" (Middlebury College Radio Services). This original station was founded by John Bowker, an undergraduate member of the College's class of 1952. Originally broadcasting at 3 watts from a chicken coop at 129 Adirondack View, the station played six hours daily of music and interviews on 750 AM. In 1950, WMCRS added the capability to broadcast play-by-play commentary of College hockey and basketball games. For a time, the station broadcast over the College's bell system into dorm rooms and fraternity houses. In 1967, WMCRS expanded to 10 watts and began broadcasting at 91.7 FM.\\"WMCRS Expands Broadcast Range,\\" Middlebury Campus, 9 February 1950. The following year the station first began 24-hour broadcasting, a first for any station in the Champlain Valley. In 1980, with the new call sign of \\"WRMC-FM\\" and broadcasting at 91.1 MHz, the station increased its power to 100 watts. Sepomana Music Festival was first held in 1998 thanks to a loophole in the Student Government Association's financing rules. The name was invented and has no additional significance. The first festival was MC'd by an Elvis impersonator and featured a live pig as a mascot. For several years, Sepomana was held in Coltrane Lounge in the Adirondack House, but was relocated to larger spaces in future years due to overwhelming demand. Location WRMC is located on the Middlebury College campus in Middlebury, VT - approximately midway between Burlington and Rutland on Route 7. The station's studios are upstairs in Proctor, the dining hall behind Mead Chapel. The transmitter is mounted on the side of the smokestack at the Service Building. WRMC boasts approximately 150 student DJs during each semester. All members of the College are welcome to participate in the station's General Board meetings, which have historically met in the station lounge weekly at 5:00 pm on Mondays when school is in session. With the assistance of the General Board, the Executive Board is responsible for the day-to-day operations of the station. The Executive Board, which is composed of the General Manager, Program Director, Business Director, Special Productions Director, and two Music Directors, is elected annually. The General Manager serves as the Chief Operator of the station for the President and Trustees of the College, who hold the station's license with the FCC. Alumni of the radio station include award-winning journalist Frank Sesno, Vermont Governor Jim Douglas, writer Jeff Lindsay, musician Ana√Øs Mitchell, NYC Parks & Recreation Commissioner Adrian Benepe, and recording artist Jonathan Tristram.

It is considered a historical monument and is of the R√©vay Rococo-Classical style of architecture. It was built in the second half of the 18th century.  New manor house  Interior of the manor house The manor house had originally two stories, with a rectangular ground-plan. The building has a block character, and is situated at the edge of an extensive park. Its frontal fa√ßade creates the border of the square. Considering the usage of space, the entrance parts of the ground floor are conceived in a rather grandiose style. Other rooms are connected to the entrance corridor. Cellars are built under a part of the object with a 9 meter deep well located in the basement. A wide, wooden staircase provides access to the first floor. The rooms in the ground-floor have simple arches without any distinct ornaments. The only exception is the so-called ‚Äûwriting-room‚Äú, with a plastic motive on the ceiling, corresponding with its purpose: a sealed envelope with four hearts. According to the legend, this is where the countess‚Äôs love letters were written. Most rooms on the first floor have straight ceilings. A representative character can be observed in a room with a rococo-classical furnace. Inside one can find original doors and rococo- classical forged rails at the ground-floor windows. After 1945 the manor house served as a school: At first it was used as a state Children‚Äôs Home for Orphans of the war, with the agricultural buildings serving as a kindergarten. Later it was turned into a special boarding school, and after that the building hosted the Vocational School of Agriculture. In the first half of the 1990s, the object was sold by the town hall to the Slovak Film Studios in Bratislava, which renovated the building and used it for recreational purposes. At night on 14 February 1963, burning ashes in one of the chimneys ignited the shingle roof of the manor house, made of larch. In spite of the efforts of fire brigades, the flames soared 20 meters high and people in the entire village were able to read the newspaper in the light. The entire roof burned down during the blaze, which caused 160,000 Kƒçs, worth of damage. The building was later restored. Agricultural buildings In the past years the interior was used several times by movie-makers. The last shootings were the ones of a saga of zemans of Turiec called, Al≈æbetin Dvor. After yet another reconstruction and adaptation in the late 20th century, and in the early years of the 21st century, the manor house started serving as a hotel. Today it is again being prepared for the visitors of Mo≈°ovce. The area adjacent to the manor house was used for agricultural buildings from the first half of the 19th century, and are a large U shape. Originally they served as garages for carriages, and later for cars of Count R√©vay. After World War II they became the home of agricultural vehicles of the local cooperative. The agricultural buildings were demolished in 2005. Old manor house in Mo≈°ovce  Old manor house  The old manor house, which was situated in the northern part of the extensive square, was torn down in 1952. When and how it was built, or who was its creator is unknown. It is probable that it was very old, because when it was destroyed by fire in 1760, Baron Jozef R√©vay didn‚Äôt restore it, but rather decided to build a new one. It is said, that when the R√©vays had their new manor house built, they had the first floor of their old residence dismantled, because supposedly they believed that the servants didn‚Äôt deserve to live in the noblemen‚Äôs chambers. Neogothic chapel  Old zeman mansion  A long time ago there was another family of noblemen living in Mo≈°ovce in addition to the R√©vays ‚Äì the zeman family of Rak≈°√°nsky. In the 15th century their old mansion was probably already standing at the place of today‚Äôs supermarket. At the end of the 19th century a Jewish school was located in the building. Its last owners at the beginning of the 20th century were the R√©vays, who didn‚Äôt need the mansion anymore, had it demolished, and turned the ground into vegetable gardens for their servants.  Manor house park  The English park has been an inseparable part of Mo≈°ovce since the second half of the 18th century. It has merged with the surrounding nature, and most of the trees in the park are local species. These trees include maples, ash-trees, beeches, oaks, hornbeams, lime-trees, locust-trees, and birches. The pine-needle trees are represented by spruces, pines, and firs. There is also a specimen of ginkgo biloba from eastern Asia, and a chestnut tree. The park's area of 16.5 ha makes it one of the largest parks in central Slovakia. It was founded by baron R√©vay, probably even before the building of their new manor house was started. The park is a typical example of an English-style park, where groups of trees give way to grassy meadows and water features. Garden pavilion In 1911 the R√©vays built a mausoleum located in a western extremity of the park. This Art Nouveau style pseudogothic building is divided into two levels. The upper level served as a chapel, the bottom one as a crypt. The main nave ends in a cross-style vault. The fa√ßade is richly decorated with neogothic shapes. At present, the object hosts the Museum of Crafts of Mo≈°ovce, which exhibits tools used for the manufacturing of famous products of Mo≈°ovce. In the park, you can also find a classical garden pavilion with a round ground-plan and added lateral wings. The pavilion, with its large semicircular windows, is covered by a dome-roof. It was built in 1800 to serve as a greenhouse. Until recently it was used for storing tools for the maintenance of the park, then it was turned into an aqua-center with a sauna, massages, and a pool. At present it is abandoned. Art Nouveau greenhouse In 1913 an Art Nouveau greenhouse was built not far from the garden pavilion. It was located on the left side of the path serving as the main entrance to the park. Stone material from the old gothic church, demolished in 1912, was used at its construction, but unfortunately, the building of the greenhouse didn‚Äôt manage to survive until today. It was a small building facing east and west. Around 1930 the new owners of the R√©vay estate, the Hubays, had the antechamber of the greenhouse renovated. The three outer walls of the greenhouse were for the most part rebuilt again, using the decorative cornerstones of the old church and tower. This way the material from the oldest times of Mo≈°ovce (beginning of the 14th century) was saved for future generations. The greenhouse entrance faced south. Over it was a Latin inscription, which read: ANTUQUIOR ET TAMEN JUNIOR SUM QUAM VIDEOR. It meant: I AM OLDER AND YET YOUNGER THAN I SEEM. After World War II, the greenhouse was in a critical condition. People were disassembling the precious stone material and using it for construction of their own houses. Today, no trace can be found of the greenhouse.

RANKL is known as a type II membrane protein and is a member of the tumor necrosis factor (TNF) superfamily. RANKL has been identified to affect the immune system and control bone regeneration and remodeling. RANKL is an apoptosis regulator gene, a binding partner of osteoprotegerin (OPG), a ligand for the receptor RANK and controls cell proliferation by modifying protein levels of Id4, Id2 and cyclin D1. RANKL is expressed in several tissues and organs including: skeletal muscle, thymus, liver, colon, small intestine, adrenal gland, osteoblast, mammary gland epithelial cells, prostate and pancreas. Variation in concentration levels of RANKL throughout several organs reconfirms the importance of RANKL in tissue growth (particularly bone growth) and immune functions within the body.  Tissue expression  The level of RANKL expression does not linearly correlate to the effect of this ligand. High protein expression of RANKL is commonly detected in the lungs, thymus and lymph nodes. Low protein expression is found in bone marrow, the stomach, peripheral blood, the spleen, the placenta, leukocytes, the heart, the thyroid, and skeletal muscle. While bone marrow expresses low levels of RANKL, RANKL plays a critical role for adequate bone metabolism. This surface-bound molecule (also known as CD254), found on osteoblasts, serves to activate osteoclasts, which are critically involved in bone resorption. Osteoclastic activity is triggered via the osteoblasts' surface-bound RANKL activating the osteoclasts' surface-bound receptor activator of nuclear factor kappa-B (RANK). Recent studies suggest that in postnatal bones, the osteocyte is the major source of RANKL regulating bone remodeling. RANKL derived from other cell types contributes to bone loss in conditions involving inflammation such as rheumatoid arthritis, and in lytic lesions caused by cancer, such as in multiple myeloma.  Gene and expression  RANKL can be expressed in three different molecular forms consisting of either a: (1) trimeric transmembrane protein, (2) primary secreted form, and (3) truncated ectodomain. RANKL is identified as a part of the TNF family; RANKL is specifically categorized under the TNFSF11, the TNF ligand superfamily member. RANKL is composed of 314 amino acids and was originally described to have a gene sequence containing 5 exons. Among the exons, Exon 1 encoded the intracellular and transmembrane protein domains and Exon 2-5 encoded the extracellular domains. RANKL‚Äôs extracellular domains are similar to other TNF family members in regards to the structural homology and are able to cleave from the cell surface. While the function and significance of A kinase anchor protein 11(AKAP11) is presently unknown, AKAP11 is immediately upstream from RANKL for all species that has a RANKL gene. The upstream of AKAP11 may suggest there is a complex regulator process that regulates the level of RANKL expression.  Function  RANKL is a member of the tumor necrosis factor (TNF) cytokine family, it binds to RANK on cells of the myeloid lineage and functions as a key factor for osteoclast differentiation and activation. RANKL may also bind to osteoprotegerin, a protein secreted mainly by cells of the osteoblast lineage which is a potent inhibitor of osteoclast formation by preventing binding of RANKL to RANK. RANKL also has a function in the immune system, where it is expressed by T helper cells and is thought to be involved in dendritic cell maturation. It is a dendritic cell survival factor and helps regulate T cell-dependent immune responses. T cell activation induces RANKL expression and can lead to an increase of osteoclastogenesis and bone loss. RANKL can also activate the antiapoptotic kinase AKT/PKB through a signaling complex involving SRC kinase and tumor necrosis factor receptor-associated factor 6 (TRAF6), indicating that RANKL may have a role in the regulation of apoptosis. A further role for RANKL in immunity was found in sinusoidal macrophages in lymph nodes that alert the immune system to lymph-borne antigens. In addition to directly signaling through RANK for macrophage differentiation, RANKL activates the adjacent lymphatic endothelial cells to create a niche environment for these specialized immune cells.  Animal models  Targeted disruption of the related gene in mice led to severe osteopetrosis and a lack of osteoclasts. Deficient mice, with an inactivation of RANKL or its receptor RANK, exhibited defects in early differentiation of T and B lymphocytes, and failed to form lobulo-alveolar mammary structures during pregnancy. It was observed that during pregnancy, RANK-RANKL signaling played a critical role in regulating skeletal calcium release; in which contributed to the hormone response that stimulated proliferation in the mammary cells. Ultimately, impaired lobuloalveolar mammary structures resulted in death of the fetus. Those who suffer from osteoporosis often have a cardiovascular defect, such as heart failure. Some studies suggest, since RANK-RANKL pathway regulates calcium release and homeostasis, RANK-RANKL signal could invertedly affect the cardiovascular system; thus, an explanation for the positive correlation between osteoporosis and cardiovascular deficiencies.  Role in cancer  Primary tumors will commonly metastasize into the bone. Breast and prostate cancers typically have a greater chance of inducing secondary cancers within bone. Stephen Paget's seed and soil theory suggests, the microenvironment in bone creates a sufficient ‚Äòsoil‚Äô for secondary tumors to grow in. Some studies suggest the expression of RANKL allows sufficient micro environmental conditions to influence cancer cell migration (i.e. chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) and multiple myeloma). Among patients with multiple myeloma, RANKL activity was greatly increased. In fact RANKL surface expression and secreted RANKL expression was reported to be increased, 80% and 50% respectively. Therefore, RANKL is considered to be a key signal regulator for cancer-induced bone loss. According to the vicious cycle hypothesis, after secondary tumors cells have migrated to bone, the tumor cell will secrete cytokines and growth factors that can act on osteoblast lineage cells. Since osteoblasts control the regulation of RANKL, the stimulation via cytokines and growth factors will then stimulate osteoblasts to increase the expression of RANKL, often while simultaneously reducing bone formation. The additional RANKL-mediated osteoclast frequency and activity will in turn increase secretion of growth factors, or matrix derived factors, which can ultimately increase tumor growth and bone destruction activity.  Clinical significance  RANKL, through its ability to stimulate osteoclast formation and activity, is a critical mediator of bone resorption and overall bone density. Overproduction of RANKL is implicated in a variety of degenerative bone diseases, such as rheumatoid arthritis and psoriatic arthritis. In addition to degenerative bone diseases, bone metastases can also induce pain and other abnormal health complexities that can significantly reduce a cancer patient‚Äôs quality of life. Some examples of these complications that are a consequence of bone metastasis are: hypercalcemia, pathological fractures and spinal cord compression. Some findings also suggest that some cancer cells, particularly prostate cancer cells, can activate an increase in bone remodeling and ultimately increase overall bone production. This increase in bone remodeling and bone production increases the overall growth of bone metastasizes. The overall control of bone remodeling is regulated by the binding of RANKL with its receptor or its decoy receptor, respectively, RANK and OPG.  Denosumab  Denosumab is an FDA-approved fully human monoclonal antibody to RANKL and during pre-clinical trials was first used to treat postmenopausal patients suffering with osteoporosis (PMO). In denosumab's third stage of the FDA's clinical trial, it was shown to: (1) decrease bone turnover, (2) reduce fractures in the PMO population, and (3) increase bone mineral density. The anti-RANKL antibody, denosumab, is also approved for use in cancer settings, and in those indications, it is branded as Xgeva. In both prostate and breast cancer, denosumab has been shown to reduce cancer treatment‚Äìinduced bone loss. = Prostate cancer = The HALT-prostate cancer trial (also known as NCT00089674) included 1468 non-metastatic prostate cancer patients who were currently receiving androgen deprivation therapy. Randomly selected patients were given either 60 mg of denosumab or calcium and vitamin D supplements. This was done to measure the effectiveness of preventing treatment-induced bone loss. The patients who received 60 mg of denosumab showed a +5.6% increased in bone mineral density and a 1.5% decrease in bone fracture rates. Another clinical trial (NCT00321620) was established to determine the safety and effectiveness of using denosumab compared to zoledronic acid. In this trial, they used 1901 bone metastatic prostate patients whom were also suffering with other complication of bone diseases. Again, patients were randomized and some were given either 120 mg of denosumab or 4 mg of zoledronic acid. Patients who were given 120 mg of denosumab (in comparison to those who were given 4 mg of zoledronic acid) showed a greater increase in hypocalcemia, a greater resistance to bone turnover markers uNTx, a delay response in both pathological fractures and spinal cord compression. However, survival rates for both clinical groups were comparable. = Breast cancer = Hormone receptor positive breast cancer patients have a significant increased risk of complications such as osteopenia and osteoporosis. About two out of every three breast cancer patients are hormone receptor positive. In the past several years, denosumab has been used in clinical trials, primarily because a large population is affected by bone complication among those who have breast cancer. 252 patients enlisted in the HALT-BC clinical trial (also known as NCT00089661). In addition to receiving vitamin D and calcium supplements, half of the patients were randomly given 60 mg of denosumab while the other half were given a placebo. Patients given denosumab had an increase in lumbar spine bone mineral density, a decrease in bone turnover markers, with no significant change in survival rates. NCT00321464 was another phase III RCT. Similar to NCT00321620 (prostate), this trial measured the safety and efficacy of denosumab versus zoledronic acid. Both groups showed similar survival rates and adverse event frequency. = Multiple myeloma = Patients whom are diagnosed with multiple myeloma have approximately 80-100% chance of developing bone complications due to an increase in activity and/or formation of osteoclasts and a decrease activity of osteoblasts. In a stage II clinical trial, denosumab decreased bone turnover markers by blocking the RANKL/RANK pathway. Once this trial was completed, 1176 patients with either multiple myeloma or progressed cancers were entered into the stage III clinical trial (known as NCT00330759). The main objective of the NCT00330759 trial was to compare effects of patients who were given 120 mg of denosumab relative to patients give 4 mg of zoledronic acid. As a result of this trial, during a month period, patients who received denosumab had a decrease in pathological fractures and spinal cord compression; however, as time progressed it appear that denosumab had significantly delayed bone complications. In both breast and prostate cancers, patients in either denosumab or zoledronic acid groups both appeared to have comparable adverse events and survival rates.  Medroxyprogesterone acetate  Women with menopause have often been given various types of postmenopausal hormone therapies to prevent osteoporosis and reduce menopausal symptoms. Medroxyprogesterone acetate (MPA) is a synthetic progestin and was commonly used as a contraceptive or used as a hormone therapy for endometriosis or osteoporosis. Recent studies suggest, using MPA increases patient risks of developing breast cancer due to an increase expression of RANKL. MPA causes a substantial induction of RANKL in mammary-gland epithelial cells while deletion of RANKL decreases the incidence MPA-induced breast cancer. Hence inhibition of RANKL has potential for the prevention and treatment of breast cancer.

It normally comprises a folded card containing detailed notes about the stamps, a card with clear strips for holding the actual stamps, all held within a clear sleeve. The packs are usually sold at a price a little above the stamps' face value.  History  Great Britain was one of the first countries to produce Commemorative Presentation Packs, with the first Presentation Packs being issued by the General Post Office in 1960, when the GPO was looking for a convenient way of packaging and selling sets of stamps for the London 1960 International Stamp Exhibition, held at the Royal Festival Hall. They produced four packs priced in pounds sterling for the exhibition, and another four priced in US dollars for a Post Office sales tour of the USA. Each pack was fairly basic in design and the only information printed on the pack was a brief description of the stamps and the retail price. These first Presentation Packs were produced in very limited numbers and are now commonly known as Forerunners. It was in 1964 that the first Commemorative Packs were produced by the GPO. On 23 April, the first ‚Äòproper‚Äô pack was issued for a set of stamps celebrating the Shakespeare Festival, to mark the 400th Anniversary of the birth of William Shakespeare. The Presentation Pack was decorative in design and contained information on the stamp designs, the designer and the stamp printer. Early packs were not produced in large numbers and are highly sought after by collectors. The pack for the \\"Opening of the Forth Road Bridge\\" stamps has a catalogue value of ¬£400 according to the 2010 Stanley Gibbons \\"Great Britain Concise Stamp Catalogue\\", though they sell on the open market for considerably less! The early packs issued in the 1960s had tight cellophane sleeves causing some to shrink, in turn leading to buckling of the information cards. The Post Office viewed the Presentation Pack as a sales tool to attract new customers and impulse buyers. They also developed the range to encourage stamp collecting in other countries, particularly Germany and Japan, by printing packs in those languages. Many countries around the world (Australia etc..) now issue Presentation Packs in similar formats, being a convenient way to sell and display a whole stamp issue.  Categories of British Presentation Packs The pack for the facsimile Penny Blacks produced by Royal Mail for a 2000 stamp exhibition (PPR1) Since the first Commemorative Presentation Pack in 1964, there has been an increasing variety of British Presentation Packs released each year. The Presentation Packs have a wide range of subject matter which can be divided into the following categories: Commemorative Packs - The most frequently produced and popular packs amongst collectors. They are released by the Royal Mail on the day that the stamps are issued and contain an information card to provide details and images relating to the theme of the stamps. The design of Commemorative Packs continually evolve, with many now containing a stamp Miniature Sheet displayed on the front, or on the reverse. Two Commemorative Packs have been specifically translated into Welsh. The first, the 1969 Investiture of The Prince of Wales, was given to the school children of Wales. The second pack was issued in 1998 for Diana, Princess of Wales, which has proved very popular with collectors. Definitive Packs - These packs provide information on the background to Definitive and Country stamps issued by the Royal Mail. The first Definitive Packs were issued on 5 March 1969 - one pack of low value pre-decimal Machin stamps and the other with high value pre-decimal Machin stamps. Collectors Club Packs - The Collectors Club was set up to promote stamp collecting for children, as a family activity. It became one of the largest clubs of its kind with 70,000 members worldwide. Only three Presentation Packs were issued specifically for the Collectors Club and they are now difficult to obtain. Forerunner Packs - Packs known as Forerunners are considered by many to be the first Presentation Packs issued. They were the inspiration of Frank Langfield, who was developing the philatelic retail department of the General Post Office by promoting stamps to the UK and USA. They were first sold in July 1960 at the International Stamp Exhibition held at Festival Hall, London. Format Packs - These stamp Format Packs were specialist products issued by the Royal Mail and contained gutter pairs, cylinder blocks, traffic lights or top left corner of the selvedge of certain stamp issues within a sealed cellophane cover. They were sold at face value, available from the Philatelic Bulletin and selected Post Offices. Greetings Packs - Greeting stamps were produced in booklet format. They were first available within a 1992 Presentation Pack. Each pack contained ten 1st Class stamps along with the corresponding labels. Altogether, from 1992 to 1997, six different Greeting Packs were produced. Miniature Sheet Collection Packs - The first Miniature Sheet Collection Pack was issued in 2005. Presented in a durable plastic folder. It contained a complete set of the year's miniature sheets with an accompanying information card. Postage Due (To Pay) Packs - Four Presentation Packs were issued by the Post Office containing Postage Due (To Pay) labels - the first in 1971 and the last in 1994. All the packs contained information on the background of 'To Pay' labels, which were introduced to Great Britain in 1914. Post & Go Packs - Post & Go Packs were introduced in 2009 and have proved popular with collectors. Originally, these packs did not carry premium pricing as they consisted only of self-adhesive stamps on a simple carrier and information card. Royal Mail continues to issue these packs throughout the year, focussing on a specific theme. Reproduction Packs - These packs are produced to commemorate special British stamps. The first was issued in 2000 to celebrate the Penny Black. Significant attention to detail goes into the production of these packs, a source of admiration to collectors. For example, the Postal Union Congress London 1929 Reproduction Pack contained stamps produced using the original die but with a watermark effect on the reverse and the word 'facsimile', to clearly distinguish them from the originals. Smilers for Kids - These packs were launched by the Post Office on 28 October 2008 with four designs featuring well known children's book characters; Peter Rabbit, Almond Blossom, Mr Happy and Noddy. These special packs were created to appeal to children and contained ten self-adhesive 1st Class stamps on a sheet, plus corresponding labels. Also included in the packs were other items, such as 'New Baby' announcement cards or cut-out masks. Year Books - These books were introduced in 1984 by the Post Office as a luxury item. They are hardback books contained within a rigid sleeve for protection. Each book contains an illustrated chapter on every stamp issue for that year, with a full set of the stamps for the collector to place into slip-in mounts on the appropriate pages. In 1995, the Post Office introduced leather-bound Year Books in limited editions. Year Packs - These are also known as Gift Packs and Collectors' Packs. The first Year Pack, originally called Gift Pack, was issued at the end of 1967 and contained the stamps for that year. The Royal cypher, embossed in gold on the cover of the pack made this a striking new addition to the GPO product range. In 1968, a Gift Pack was produced containing the commemorative stamps issued between January and August that year. Strangely, the GPO also created a Collectors' Pack, which contained selected stamp issues from 1967 and 1968. From 1969 to 1971, they continued to produce Collectors' Packs containing selected stamps from two years. However, since 1972 packs have been issued with only one year's stamps. The name changed to Year Pack in 1994. Souvenir and Special Edition Packs - This category contains a wide range of packs varying in style, content and size. They are all produced by Royal Mail; some were distributed by third parties. The first Special Edition Pack was issued in 1969 when the British Ships Commemorative Pack was reprinted for sale on board the Cunard Line Queen Elizabeth II cruise ship. The original pack had noted that the Queen Elizabeth II 'sailed on her maiden voyage to New York on 17 January 1969.' However, the sailing was delayed so Cunard commissioned a reprint with corrected text reading 'sails on her maiden voyage early in 1969.'Packs and Cards: British Ships (Cunard) Special Edition Pack 1969. Private Packs - Over the years, a number of individuals and organisations have produced Private Packs featuring specific Royal Mail stamp issues. Examples of Private Packs include Post Office Missed (also known as POM), Bournemouth and Norwich Packs. Most of these packs are produced by the philatelic departments of national post offices. However, there is nothing to stop anyone from producing a pack by taking a set of stamps and designing their own holder. A number of private packs have been created in Britain to promote products, events, or simply as souvenirs including British Caledonian Airways for the Queen's Silver Jubilee in 1977Packs and Cards: British Caledonian Airways, Queen's Silver Jubilee 1977. and Scottish Wildlife Trust for the 1981 British Butterflies stamps.Packs and Cards: Scottish Wildlife Trust, British Butterflies 1981. A more recent Private Pack was produced by the National Assembly of Wales in 2006, for distribution to its members. The pack contained a 2006 Celebrating Wales Miniature Sheet and a specially designed information card detailing the history of the Assembly.Packs and Cards: National Assembly for Wales 2006.

The channels were produced in Crystal Clear Hi-Definition with Dolby Digital 5.1 Surround Sound and were the largest suite of HD channels in the world. As part of a 15-year agreement between Rainbow Media and Dish Network, these channels were available on that satellite platform exclusively until May 12, 2008, when Dish walked away from the contract just over two years into the deal. Left without a national distribution partner, the channels were removed from Cablevision in New York, New Jersey, and Connecticut on January 20, 2009 and ceased broadcasting on the same date. History The Voom HD Networks were originally part of the Voom DTH satellite platform launched by Cablevision and were operated by its subsidiary, Rainbow DBS Company. The original Voom DTH was primed as a competitor to the established DirecTV and Dish Network systems, with its goal to become the first television provider with a lineup consisting mainly of high-definition TV networks. As part of this endeavor, Voom launched in 2003 twenty-one original channels that were completely in HD. Service was broadcast via the Rainbow-1 communications satellite, which was built by Lockheed Martin and launched on July 17, 2003. It continues to operate from the 61.5¬∞W orbital location, over the Atlantic Ocean. Voom used the same unique 8PSK Turbo-coded modulation scheme as Dish Network but with a symbol rate of 22 MSps 5/6 FEC versus Dish Network's 21.5 MSPS 2/3 FEC resulting in a data-rate of 50.5 Mbit/s per transponder versus Dish Network's 41 Mpbs. Despite the same modulation scheme, Voom and Dish Network were incompatible given Voom's choice of conditional access and system's standard. Dish Network uses Nagravision and DVB whereas Voom used Motorola's Digicipher II scrambling and system information. Voom broadcast their MPEG-2 video in either low-rate standard definition or medium-rate high definition. Many of their channels were encoded as 1440x1080i versus the 1920x1080i the ATSC system was designed for. Additionally the video bit-rate was often far below the 15 Mbit/s rate chosen for ATSC with its multiplex rate of 19.3 Mbit/s. This resulted in poor video quality both in SD and HD. Dolby AC-3 was the audio standard like all Digicipher-based networks. In early 2005, Voom's parent company Cablevision announced it would seek \\"strategic alternatives\\" for Rainbow Media Enterprises, the business unit that contained its Voom satellite service, leaving the future of Voom in question. Cablevision's board proceeded to shut the Voom satellite service down: The satellite service ceased on April 30, 2005, and Rainbow-1 and VOOM's spectrum allocations were sold to EchoStar. Work on the Voom HD channels continued. In April 2005, Rainbow Media and Dish Network entered into a 15-year affiliation agreement whereby EchoStar's Dish Network obtained the right to distribute the Voom channels until 2020 and agreed that it would pay Rainbow Media monthly subscription fees for the life of the agreement. The subscription fees started at $3.25 per subscriber in the first year of the agreement, and were to increase to $6.43 per subscriber by the year 2020. In a separate agreement, EchoStar's Dish obtained a 20% ownership interest in Rainbow Media (the business unit that contained the Voom HD channels) and Rainbow agreed to invest $100 million into the Voom service each year for the first five years of the agreement. As a result, EchoStar's Dish Network announced that they would be adding ten of Voom's original 21 channels to their lineup starting May 1; the remaining channels were added on February 1, 2006. Upon launch, the Voom HD channels were very well received and EchoStar's HD subscriber base expanded from about 20,000 at the end of 2005 to about 1.3 million at the end of 2007. In addition to being carried by Dish Network, the HD channels were relaunched by Rainbow Media under the name \\"Voom HD Networks.\\" Due to issues surrounding the formatting of the channels, fifteen of the 21 original channels were initially retained. Voom's HD collection was added to Cablevision's cable-TV HD-lineup in late June 2007. In January 2008, EchoStar's Dish Network abandoned the affiliation agreement claiming that Voom had failed to invest $100 million in the service during 2006 although Cablevision and Rainbow provided Dish Network with the financial statements documenting their compliance. Dish Network proceeded to remove ten of the channels from their lineup on May 12, 2008, with the remaining five removed the next day, leaving coverage limited to Cablevision's systems in New York, New Jersey, Connecticut and parts of Pennsylvania. Cablevision and Rainbow sued Dish Network for breach of contract and sought more than $2.5 billion in damages. Citing this drop in carriage and the ensuing lengthy litigation, Cablevision announced on December 18 that the Voom HD suite would be discontinued as of January 15, 2009, to be replaced by other HD programming.\\"Rainbow Pulls Plug On Voom HD Service\\" from Multichannel.com 18 Dec 2008. (Ultimately, the channels ceased operations on January 20, and were replaced by multiplexed HD content from premium providers.)Linda Moss, \\"Cablevision replaces Voom suite with premium HD services,\\" from Multichannel News, 21 Jan 2009. Following the litigation discovery process, the Court granted Voom's motion for discovery sanctions. The New York State Supreme Court found that EchoStar's Dish Network \\"systematically destroyed evidence\\" in the case and stated that ‚Äúit is entirely possible that the documents destroyed by EchoStar demonstrated that EchoStar knew all along that there was no breach...and would prove Voom‚Äôs case.‚Äù The Judge also stated that he would tell jurors that Dish Network destroyed evidence and that the jury may assume the evidence would have been helpful to Voom's case. According to Sanford C. Bernstein analyst Craig Moffett in a recent Wall Street Journal article, \\"cases involving spoilation of evidence rarely go to trial because the odds are so skewed against the offending party.\\" In this case, the judge won't only tell the jury that EchoStar failed to preserve certain evidence; he is barring Dish from calling its expert witness to testify on damages. Additionally, the Court stated in its November 3, 2010 ruling: ‚ÄúIn conclusion, the court notes EchoStar‚Äôs pattern of egregious conduct and questionable ‚Äì and, at times, blatantly improper ‚Äì litigation tactics. EchoStar‚Äôs spoliation in this action, and the fact that it has been sanctioned for spoliation in previous actions, is precisely the type of offensive conduct that cannot be tolerated by the court. Similarly egregious is EchoStar‚Äôs last minute finagling with expert reports, believing that it can play fast and loose with the rules of procedure in order to enhance its litigation posture.‚Äù The trial commenced on September 19, 2012 in the New York State Supreme Court. During the summer of 2012, financial analysts who cover Dish Networks urged the company to settle the lawsuit in advance of the trial, as ‚Äúthe odds would‚Ä¶appear to be heavily in Cablevision‚Äôs/AMC‚Äôs favor.‚Äù On October 21, 2012, Cablevision and AMC Networks announced that they have settled their legal disputes with Dish Networks over Voom HD, an indirect subsidiary of AMC Networks. Dish will pay a settlement of $700 million to Cablevision and AMC Networks, $80 million of which will go for the purchase of Cablevision's multichannel video and distribution licenses in 45 U.S. metropolitan areas. Legacy One of its channels, HDNews‚Äîmanaged by veteran news director, William Wright‚Äîwas responsible for many HDTV firsts, including incorporating Emmy-Award‚Äìwinning television journalist Zoey Tur's transmission codec which allowed the backhaul of news content via the Internet. Today Tur and HDNews's novel use of the Internet for high definition transmission of breaking news is now used by content creators across the globe. The satellite which broadcast VOOM is currently still in orbit, incorporated into the Dish Network fleet after the demise of VOOM's satellite operations and rebranded as Echostar XII. Unlike most discontinued direct broadcast satellite systems in the United States such as PrimeStar and AlphaStar, the Voom set-top boxes are still useful even though the service is gone; they can be used to receive ATSC digital broadcast signals. Voom set-top boxes have commanded prices upwards of $100 on websites such as eBay as people seek a less expensive way to receive digital off-air broadcasts.

History The publishing house was registered by Franz Xaver Josef Eher (1851-1918) in the Munich Handelsregister on 2 December 1901. However, the firm was actually founded with the name M√ºnchener Beobachter on 2 January 1887. After Eher's death, Rudolf von Sebottendorf took over the firm in 1918 and on 30 September 1919 transformed it into a limited liability company in order to avoid possible bankruptcy. The headquarters were in Munich (Thierschstra√üe 11-17), and from 1933, the entire party literature was printed and published by Eher-Verlag. Later branches in Berlin, Vienna, and additional branches in Munich were established. Between 1933 and 1943, Rolf Rienhard was chief administrator. He was relieved by Wilhelm Baur, who remained until the end of the war. The key figure leading the publishing house's expansion, however, was Max Amann, who took over the firm in the 1930s. He also doubled as Reich Press Leader and president of the Reich Press Chamber. In addition to the Eher-Verlag, he controlled nearly the entire economic function of the press in Germany. Often, Amann (in his government role) expropriated rival papers whose publishers were not willing to do the government's bidding. He then had the Eher-Verlag buy them for a pittance, usually in auctions in which the Eher-Verlag was the sole bidder. During the 1930s the Nazi Party purchased parts of the Alfred Hugenberg concerns and a number of other publishing houses. By the 1940s, these tactics turned the Eher Verlag into one of the largest newspaper chains in the world. In 1945, the publisher was banned and dismantled. The firm's buildings and intellectual property (including Mein Kampf) were transferred to the state of Bavaria. Notable books *Adolf Hitler. Mein Kampf (published 1925). *Alfred-Ingemar Berndt.

Ltd. It was a landmark title for the developer as it was their first game to feature movement on a 3D plane; prior to Stretch Panic they had been a developer of 2D titles. The game revolves around a girl named Linda who has the power to pinch, stretch, and bend objects and enemies with a magic scarf as she battles her evil sisters. The game was released on July 27, 2001 in Europe, August 28, 2001 in North America and December 6, 2001 in Japan. Plot The story stars a girl named Linda who lives with her twelve vain sisters, who are obsessed with beauty and treat Linda as their errand girl, often making fun of her scarf. One day, a mysterious present appears on the family's doorstep which, upon being opened unleashes thirteen vanity demons. As twelve of the demons manage to kidnap and possess the other sisters, the thirteenth demon becomes stuck in Linda's scarf. With everyone sucked into a weird dimension, Linda, now having full command over her newly possessed scarf, sets out to save her twelve sisters and exorcise the twelve demons possessing them. Gameplay Stretch Panic sees players in the role of Linda, a girl who must use her newly possessed scarf to rescue her sisters that have been possessed by demons. Linda's scarf has the unique ability to grab onto its environment and stretch it as if it were elastic. Players can aim the scarf towards an object or enemy and, once it has grabbed something, pull it and then snap it back to damage it. Linda can also grab the ground, and then pull back and launch herself across distances and heights. Linda can also grab onto an object or enemy and charge up the tension of the scarf to perform a charging head butt move. Damage is determined by three levels, weak blue attacks, medium yellow attacks and strong red attacks that are achieved by attacking an enemy's weak points. The health of Linda and the bosses are represented by a star shaped chart, which fills up as they take damage. If Linda takes too much damage and fills up her star chart, she will be returned to the main hub. The game starts off in a main hub, where players can access the available levels, save their progress, and access a gallery where they can freely stretch the bosses they have exorcised. There are two sets of levels: EX levels, which are platforming levels, and boss fights. The EX levels are notable for having only one enemy type: women with comically enormous breasts. Points can be earned by attacking these enemies on their weak points, their heads, which are required to enter each of the boss levels. Each boss is unique, featuring its own strategies and weak points. Linda can defeat each boss by dealing enough damage to it, after which she can re-enter the stage at no extra cost. However, to truly defeat a boss and rescue the possessed sister, the player must successfully perform a Smart Bomb move, which requires five points to use, to exorcise the demon possessing the boss before defeating it. As bosses are defeated, more levels become available. Reception Chester Barber reviewed the PlayStation 2 version of the game for Next Generation, rating it two stars out of five, and stated that \\"Stretch Panic looks unique and includes a few original ideas, but with such a flawed game design, it's not worth the effort.\\" Stretch Panic received mixed reviews. GameGo! magazine featured the game on the cover of its first issue, and gave it a rave review, while Electronic Gaming Monthly gave it 4.9/10. In Japan, Famitsu magazine scored the game a 30 out of 40.„Éó„É¨„Ç§„Çπ„ÉÜ„Éº„Ç∑„Éß„É≥2 - „Å≤„Å£„Å±„É™„É≥„ÉÄ. Weekly Famitsu. No.915 Pt.2. Pg.90. 30 June 2006.

It is the feature film directorial debut of both directors. This film stars Candice Rialson as an aspiring actress who has just arrived in Los Angeles, and was made as a result of a bet between Jon Davison and Roger Corman to make the cheapest ever film for New World Pictures. This was accomplished by extensive use of footage from other New World films. Plot In a prologue, pompous film director Eric Von Leppe (Paul Bartel) is shooting a skydiving sequence for low-budget Miracle Pictures in which an actress is killed. Candy Wednesday (Candice Rialson) arrives in Los Angeles to make it as an actor. She gets an agent, Walter Paisley (Dick Miller), but struggles to find work until she inadvertently gets involved in a bank robbery as a getaway driver. This gets her a job for Miracle Pictures as a stunt driver. She meets Eric Von Leppe, temperamental starlet Mary McQueen (Mary Woronov), sleazy producer PG (Richard Doran) and friendly scriptwriter, Pat (Jeffrey Kramer). Candy and Pat fall in love and she starts to get work as an actor, becoming friends with fellow starlets Bobbi (Rita George) and Jill (Tara Strohmeier). Everyone goes to the Philippines to make a movie, Machete Maidens of Mora Tau, starring Candy, Mary, Bobbi and Jill. Candy has to play a character who is raped, which upsets her. Later on during the shoot, Jill, Bobbi and PG have a threesome. During the filming of a battle sequence, Jill is shot dead by an unseen attacker. Back in the US, Candy, Walter and Pat all go to see Machete Maidens at a local drive-in where the projectionist tries to rape Candy, but she is rescued by Walter. While shooting a chase scene in a science fiction film, Mary, Candy and Bobbi are almost killed in a car accident. Bobbi is called back to the studio late at night and is stabbed to death. Candy begins to suspect Patrick is the killer. But it turns out the real culprit is Mary. She tries to kill Candy at the Hollywood Sign but it falls on her and crushes her to death. Candy is reunited with Pat and becomes a film star.

Corman granted him a budget of $60,000 and only allowed ten days of shooting instead of the usual 15. The filmmakers achieved this by coming up with a story about a B-movie studio which could incorporate footage from other movies that Corman owned. The film was shot in October 1975 on short ends of raw stock left over from other movies. The script was a send up of the \\"three girls\\" movies New World were making at the time such as Summer School Teachers, with the murder plot borrowing heavily from an old Bela Lugosi movie, The Death Kiss (1932).Jon Davison on Hollywood Boulevard at Trailers From Hell accessed 10 June 2012 The movie was also known as The Starlets, Hollywood Starlets, The Actresses and Hello, Hollywood. Dante says at one stage Corman wanted to call it Hollywood Hookers but the directors did not like that \\"even though it probably would have made more money if it was called Hollywood Hookers\\".Chris Nashawaty, Crab Monsters, Teenage Cavemen and Candy Stripe Nurses ‚Äì Roger Corman: King of the B Movie, Abrams, 2013 p 150 According to the audio commentary on the film's DVD by Joe Dante, Jon Davison and Allan Arkush, Roger Corman originally wanted Roberta Collins to play the lead, but they fought for Candice Rialson. Diabolique magazine argued that \\"I'm a Collins fan, but it was the right decision because Rialson brings not just looks and comic timing, but also a plucky underdog persona that is immensely appealing.\\" Dante, Davison and Arkush also state the part of producer PG was turned down by Barry Gordon and Dwayne Hickman, and that Rita George was dating Dean Martin during filming. Paul Bartel credits the film with launching his acting career. He later said they were worried the film would not be long enough so they improvised a series of \\"TV interviews\\" in which each of the major characters sketches in something of his background. Bartel tried to mimic \\"the kind of spiel Roger [Corman] used to feed the press, speaking of the exploitation films which he often loaded with doses of ersatz social consciousness: \\"In this film we've taken the myth of Romeo and Juliet, combined it with high speed car action and a sincere plea for nuclear controls in our lifetime.\\" Films featured The film uses footage from the following Corman pictures: * Battle Beyond the Sun (1962) ‚Äì film seen at drive in * The Terror (1963) ‚Äì film seen at drive in *The Big Bird Cage (1972) ‚Äì battle sequence *Night of the Cobra Woman (1972) ‚Äì shot of a cobra *The Hot Box (1972) ‚Äì battle sequence *Night Call Nurses (1972) ‚Äì the opening sky diving sequence *Unholy Rollers (1972) ‚Äì a rollerderby sequence *Savage!

It was often used to distribute network broadcast programming to smaller markets which were normally outside of the range of major centers. Use in United States television In the 1950s, a broadband network of AT&T; L-carrier and microwave relays known as Long Lines was constructed. These circuits could be (and were) used for normal telephone traffic, but were also used to relay the video signals of the three US commercial television networks (ABC, CBS, and NBC) to their various affiliated stations around the country. This enabled those affiliates to all carry network programming \\"live\\" at the same time. However, a handful of small-market TV stations were not able to be connected via long lines due to their remote geographic location. In some cases, network shows were recorded (either as a kinescope or, starting in the late 1950s and early 1960s, on videotape) and sent to the station via mail or courier, to be aired on a delayed basis (usually a one-week delay). This was a less than satisfactory situation for these stations because of the inferior quality of kinescope recordings, the possibility of a recording being lost or damaged in transit, and the fact that they would be unable to broadcast episodes of a given series on the same date and at the same time as most other network affiliates. Additionally, live broadcasts such as sporting events and breaking news coverage could not be carried, as they would be dated by the time a recording could be received and broadcast. Some of these stations, therefore, entered into an agreement with another affiliate of the same network located in a nearby market to pick up their broadcast signal off the air and relay it via their own transmitter during network programming. In most cases, this was accomplished by simply placing a high-gain directional antenna on their broadcast tower, aimed at the relaying station. (Although, in a few situations, a private microwave relay system was established). While avoiding the problems of depending on delayed recordings, this method was not without its own inherent pitfalls. As the originating station was usually somewhat‚Äîas far as 50‚Äì100 miles (80‚Äì160 km) or more‚Äîthe signal could frequently be degraded or interfered with by other stations on the same channel during periods of ionospheric or tropospheric disturbance. For that matter, if the originating station experienced technical difficulties and had to leave the air, the receiving station would be left without network programming during the outage as well. Additionally, during network breaks when local commercials and station identifications were aired, the receiving station would have to cut away from their off-air network feed to substitute their own local material. This was often accomplished without cues, merely by having the master control operator monitor the feed, prepared to \\"punch up\\" the local inserts when appropriate. But this required very careful timing, and often a bit of the originating station's commercials or station identification would mistakenly be rebroadcast by the receiving station. Also, if there was a local pre-emption either due to breaking news or a pre-planned pre-emption of the network on the originating station, the other station would have to scramble to find alternate programming to carry during the pre-emption, either by asking the network for film of a program in advance, picking it up from yet another station, or substituting programming from their archives. Although most of these affiliates were eventually connected to the \\"live\\" network via new extensions or branches of the Long Lines system, some of these off-air network pickups were still used well into the 1970s.

Starting as a continuation of SC 18, at the South Carolina state line near Earl, NC 18 travels north into Shelby, where it overlaps with NC 150 and crosses US 74/NC 226\\\\. North of Shelby, it goes through the towns of Fallston and Belwood, before entering Lincoln County. At Toluca, it connects with NC 27; at Laurel Hill, it overlaps briefly with NC 10, before entering Catawba County. With no major interchanges in Catawba County, it enters Burke County and goes northwesterly towards Morganton. Entering Morganton from the southeast, it crosses under I-40 (exit 105) and follows Sterling Street into the downtown area. After passing US 70 (Fleming Drive), the highway splits along one-way streets, via Green Street (northbound) and Sterling Street (southbound). At Meeting Street, NC 181 begins and also joins US 64 Business. At Avery Street, NC 181 continues along Green Street towards Linville. Near the Catawba River, NC 18 connects with mainline US 64 at Sanford Drive and continue as a shared concurrency into Caldwell County. In Caldwell County, US 64/NC 18 go through the town of Gamewell before entering Lenoir, from the southwest. In Lenoir, US 64/NC 18 will cross US 321 (Blowing Rock Boulevard/Hickory Boulevard), where traffic could possibly get backed up. US 64/NC 18 will then overlap with NC 90 (Wilkesboro Boulevard) before US 64/NC 90 splits off and continues towards Taylorsville; while NC 18 goes northeasterly, adjacent to the Brushy Mountains, through the Cedar Rock and Kings Creek before entering Wilkes County. After passing through Thankful and Boomer, it joins NC 16 at Moravian Falls, then goes north towards Wilkesboro.

With a short concurrency with US 421 Bus., it continues north along Second Street. NC 268 splits at Elkin Highway towards Elkin. After passing through Mulberry, Halls Mill and McGrady, NC 18 takes its ascent along a curvy stretch of highway into Alleghany County. Entering the county at Mulberry Gap (), NC 18 hugs along the Ashe-Alleghany county line before crossing under the Blue Ridge Parkway. At Laurel Springs, NC 18 connects with NC 88, where it goes westerly towards Jefferson. Heading northeasterly, through Whitehead, it crosses US 21 in Sparta. Crossing the Little River, at Blevins Crossroads, NC 18 goes easterly, near the Virginia state line. North of Cumberland Knob, NC 18 crosses under the Blue Ridge Parkway again and enters Surry County. After from the county line, it NC 18 ends at NC 89, near the community of Lowgap and from the Virginia state line. Continuing on NC 89 will take travelers south to Mount Airy or north to Galax, Virginia. History NC 18 was established in 1921 as an original state highway, traveling from NC 20, in Shelby, to NC 67, in Moravian Falls; connecting the cities of Morganton and Lenoir. In 1925, NC 18 was extended south to its current southern terminus at the South Carolina state line, near Earl. South Carolina reciprocate in 1930 with the establishment of SC 111 from the state line to Gaffney, which was later renumbered SC 18 in 1937. In 1929, NC 18 was extended north, replacing NC 67, through Wilkesboro and North Wilkesboro, to US 21/NC 26 in Sparta. Also in 1929, NC 18 was rerouted south of Morganton going through the Sunnyside community and leaving behind Enola and Enola Road (SR 1922). In 1930, NC 18 was extended northeast along new primary routing to its current northern terminus at NC 89, near Lowgap. In 1948 or 1949, NC 18 was rerouted onto new bypass south of downtown Lenoir; its old alignment along Harper Avenue became NC 18A. In 1952, NC 18 was placed on new routing between Laurel Hill and Morganton with a routing through Catawba County; the old routing through Camp Creek and Sunnyside was downgraded to secondary road \\"Old North Carolina Highway 18\\" (SR 1100 Gaston County, SR 1555 Cleveland County and SR 1924 Burke County). In 1962, NC 18 was rerouted in downtown North Wilkesboro, from B Street to a split with northbound along 10th Street and southbound along D Street and Forester Avenue. In 1966, NC 18 was rerouted in downtown Shelby, from South Washington and East Graham Streets to South Lafayette Street. In 1969, NC 18 was rerouted at Moravian Falls onto NC 16, leaving Moravian Falls Road (SR 1194). In 1977, NC 18 was rerouted in downtown Morganton from Avery Avenue to Bouchelle Street. In 1978, NC 18 was rerouted again in downtown North Wilkesboro, from Forester Avenue to CBD loop. In 1992, NC 18 was rerouted back to its former alignment in downtown Morganton, via Avery Avenue.

It is the first novel in a series featuring the spy, Lucifer Box. Plot summary Joshua Reynolds, of the British Secret Service, briefs Lucifer Box to pick up the threads of an investigation started by the recently murdered Jocelyn Utterson Poop of the Diplomatic Service. The only surviving clues were the names of two scientists who died within a day of each other. The investigation leads to the \\"Superior Funerals\\" undertakers run by Tom Bowler. Mr Bowler seems more interested in shipping boxes to and from Naples than burying the dead. An attempt on Box's life soon follows. A painter and friend of Box supplies a new lead into the deaths of the scientists, which leads to the curious Mrs. Midsomer Knight, who has been replaced by a soon to be murdered maidservant. Lucifer's friend, Christopher Miracle, is implicated in the murder. In Naples Lucifer interviews one of the survivors of the \\"Cambridge four\\" group of scientists and fears for his life. Soon after he meets Charlie Jackpot, who invites him to a house of ill-repute. At that point, we learn that Lucifer is bisexual, as Charlie is gay, and the two have sex. Charlie then leads Lucifer into the Vesuvius Club, where Lucifer meets the alluring Venus, who is not who she seems, and he and Charlie fall victim to sleeping gas. Lucifer awakens in a cell and learns from a fellow prisoner that relics are being sold from excavation sites to finance a larger operation and that the \\"Superior Funerals\\" undertakers are part of a smuggling racket. Lucifer escapes and discovers Charlie in a death trap, from which Box rescues him before being discovered. Lucifer and Charlie escape via the sewer system. The following morning, Lucifer discovers that the professor he interviewed has disappeared. Examining the scene, Lucifer discovers a detailed schematic of Mount Vesuvius. Box's investigation then leads him to an opium den, then to a supposedly haunted house where he discovers the three supposed dead professors and Mrs. Knight in a drugged stupor. The house leads to a passageway into the ancient ruin of Pompeii and the villain's base. Box confronts Venus and Unman, a traitor who has been assisting the enemy. Box attempts to do a deal for testimony against Victor. Unfortunately Venus turns out to in fact be Victor. Victor seeks revenge against those who wronged his father. Victor has completed the work of his father, as scientist who was driven mad and died some time ago. His intent is to trigger a massive volcanic eruption, which will spark a chain reaction that will ultimately destroy Italy. Lucifer's companions are imprisoned in the volcano. The intent is for them to be incinerated in the eruption. Lucifer himself is taken to a volcanic vent and to be steamed to death but escapes and manages to rescue his companions after capturing Bowler. Venus/Victor has no intention of anybody leaving the volcano before the eruption. When Box reveals this to Bowler, Bowler turns against Venus/Victor and attempts to prevent the device being detonated. This fails and the device is released. The device is only stopped when Bowler uses the steam vent to prevent the bomb being delivered to the right part of the volcano, but the detonation triggers a minor eruption and everyone must flee for their lives. Unman tries to prevent the heroes escaping, killing Bowler and wounding Lucifer, before he himself is killed. Lucifer and the others escape and the remaining unclear points of the mystery are cleared up while Lucifer convalesces under the care of Charlie. Lucifer's heterosexual love interest, Bella, appears and reveals she is the daughter of a man he killed in the early chapters of the book as part of a routine assignment. Charlie intercedes at the last moment to save Lucifer and Bella is killed. Characters Lucifer Box: A decadent Edwardian gentleman, resident and owner of No. 9 Downing Street.

His troupe continued to perform there after his death in 1668, until 1671. Lisle's Tennis Court was a building off Portugal Street in Lincoln's Inn Fields in London. Originally built as a real tennis court, it was used as a playhouse during two periods, 1661-1674 and 1695-1705\\\\. During the early period, the theatre was called Lincoln's Inn Fields Playhouse, also known as The Duke's Playhouse, The New Theatre or The Opera. The building was demolished and replaced by a purpose-built theatre for a third period, 1714-1728\\\\. The tennis court theatre was the first public playhouse in London to feature the moveable scenery that would become a standard feature of Restoration theatres. Historical Background The period beginning in England in 1642 and lasting until 1660 is known as the Interregnum, meaning \\"between kings.\\" At this time, there was no monarch on the throne, and theatre was against the law. Spanning from 1642 to 1649, the English Civil War occurred. This war was an uprising against the current King of England, King Charles I, led by Oliver Cromwell, a Puritan. Cromwell's opposition to the throne was religious but political, as well, which led him to build up an army with the ability to imprison King Charles, who was beheaded in 1649, ending the war. After his death, the King's wife and children were given permission to leave the country, so they travelled to France to escape and receive protection. The years following became known as the Commonwealth Era (1649-1660) because Cromwell, who established himself as the monarch figure without assuming any official authority, ruled the nation with Parliament support and renamed the England Republic to the English Commonwealth. These were tough times for England as Cromwell persecuted many families, especially those who fought on the behalf of King Charles I and Irish families that held rustic Catholic beliefs. Needless to say, Oliver Cromwell quickly fell out of the majority's favour, and he died in 1658 of natural causes. Two years later, Charles II, the beheaded king's son, returned to England and began the Restoration by restoring the throne and claiming his role as the proper King of England. In addition, King Charles II's return restored the legality of theatre. This history is significant because it explains that since Charles II spent most of his life in France, he, as King, appreciated French culture, which prominently impressed upon England during the Restoration, particularly Restoration theatre.  Structure There are no extant photos, elaborate diagrams, paintings, or other forms of visual evidence of the inside of the Lincoln's Inn theatre, but certain aspects are understood of the theatre according to its time period. However, a great example of the layout of the inside is the Theatre Royal in Richmond, England, which contains components of Restoration theatre spaces and still stands today. Lincoln's Inn Fields Playhouse was very small. In fact, Milhous believes that \\"the smaller seating capacity‚Ä¶ hurt the [Duke‚Äôs] company in the long run\\" as they moved as newer theatres came along (Milhous 71). It was around 75 feet long by 30 feet wide with about a 650-person audience seating maximum capacity (The Restoration Theater; Wilson and Goldfarb 249). It was originally an indoor tennis court; courts were used as theatre spaces because they had a similar structure with a narrow, rectangular shape and gallery seating. The stage was raked, sloping upward toward the back of the stage, in order to help with perspective. The audience was divided into the pit, boxes, and galleries. The pit had backless benches and a raked floor that rose toward the back of the audience to help sightlines. Mostly single men sat here, and it was the noisiest, rowdiest area in the theatre. Boxes sat upper class aristocrats‚Äîmostly married couples with wives who wanted to be seen. Galleries held the lower class, including servants of the upper classes in attendance. The English stage, unlike French or Italian theatres, had a very deep apron to provide adequate acting space, and the background and perspective scenery served as solely as scenery. The Lincoln's Inn Fields Playhouse orchestra was housed beneath the stage, and the apron was extended two feet to cover completely the orchestra pit and obtain close proximity between the actors and the audience, creating an intimate atmosphere. Another uniqueness of English theatres is that there were typically two pairs of doors, one on each side of the stage, called proscenium doors with balconies above them for the actors to utilize in performances. Proscenium doors served as entrances and exits disregarding the possibility of multiple locations. Candelabras provided light for the space, and manual moveable scenery was used to move the show along (The Restoration Theater). The Duke's Company  The building was constructed as a real tennis court in 1656. Thomas Lisle's wife Anne Tyler and a man named James Hooker developed the indoor court in the winter of 1656 and 1657.Hartnoll. Portions available online. Tudor-style real tennis courts were long, high-ceiling buildings, with galleries for spectators; their dimensions -- about 75 by 30 feet -- are similar to the earlier theatres, and much larger than a modern tennis court.Styan p. 238. After the English Restoration in 1660, Lincoln's Inn Fields Playhouse received its first company through the efforts of the King himself and two men who dedicated themselves to theatre. Sir William Davenant had received a patent from Charles the I in 1639 when he was in power, but he had never used it due to the theatre ban. When theatre was restored, Davenant and a man named Thomas Killigrew wanted to create theatre in England and thus, Killigrew obtained a warrant expressing that he could \\"raise a company and a theatre, provided that his company and Davenant‚Äôs should be the only ones allowed to play in London\\" (Hotson 199). Davenant, then, drafted their joint warrant and after much debate over whether or not their role in theatre infringed on the Master of the Revels‚Äô power, they appealed to Charles II. Charles II determined their Letters of Patent were valid and created two companies to perform \\"legitimate drama\\" in London: the Duke's Company of his brother, The Duke of York, led by William Davenant, and his company, the King's Company, led by Thomas Killigrew. Original intentions were positive, but competition was quickly apparent between the two. Both companies briefly performed in the theatrical spaces that had survived the interregnum and civil war (including the Cockpit and Salisbury Court), but scrambled to quickly acquire facilities that were more to current tastes. Taking a hint from their new King's taste, Killigrew and Davenant both chose a solution that had been used in France: converting tennis courts into theatres. In March 1660, Sir William Davenant contracted to lease Lisle's Tennis Court in order to renovate it into a theatre, and he bought adjoining land to expand the building into the garden area. Killigrew's theatre on Vere Street (Gibbon's Tennis Court) opened first, in November 1660. Davenant apparently spent more time in his remodelling: Lincoln's Inn Fields opened on 28 June 1661, with the first \\"moveable\\" or \\"changeable\\" scenery used on the British public stage, and the first proscenium arch. Wings or shutters ran in grooves and could be smoothly and mechanically changed between or even within acts. The production was a revamped version of Davenant's own five-year-old opera The Siege of Rhodes where the soon-to-be famous actor, Thomas Betterton, performed the prologue.Pepys first records attending \\"the Opera\\" on its fourth day of opening, to watch the second half of The Siege of Rhodes, attended by King Charles II and his great aunt, Elizabeth of Bohemia: The Diary of Samuel Pepys, Tuesday 2 July 1661. The result was such a sensation that it brought Charles II to a public theatre for the first time.Milhous p. 19. This production at Lincoln's Inn Fields Playhouse \\"emptied Killigrew‚Äôs theatre\\" according to Milhous (19). Milhous also explains that the companies and other theatres \\"deliberately engaged in vicious head-on collision[s], mounting the same plays\\" (19). The competing King's Company suddenly found itself playing to empty houses, as diarist and devoted playgoer Samuel Pepys notes on 4 July: > I went to the theatre [in Vere Street] and there I saw Claracilla (the first > time I ever saw it), well acted. But strange to see this house, that use to > be so thronged, now empty since the opera begun--and so will continue for a > while I believe.The Diary of Samuel Pepys, Thursday 4 July 1661. The Siege of Rhodes \\"continued acting 12 days without interruption with great applause\\" according to the prompter John Downes in his \\"historical review of the stage\\" Roscius Anglicanus (1708). This was a remarkable run for the limited potential audience of the time. More acclaimed productions by the Duke's Company \\"with scenes\\" followed at Lincoln's Inn Fields in the course of 1661 (including Hamlet and Twelfth Night), all highly admired by Pepys.Milhous p. 19; Pepys records seeing Davenant's The Wits, on Thursday 15 August 1661, and on two other occasions in the next 8 days ; Hamlet, Prince of Denmark on Saturday 24 August 1661;; Twelfth Night on Wednesday 11 September 1661 ; and Davenant's Love and Honour three times in 4 days in October ; The Bondman by Philip Massinger twice in November,, The Siege of Rhodes and Hamlet one further time each, and finishing the year with Cutter of Coleman Street by Abraham Cowley on Monday 16 December 1661, having passed his first negative review, of The Mad Lover, on Monday 2 December 1661 . The King's Company was forced to abandon their own, technically unsophisticated tennis-court theatre and commission the construction of a new theatre in Bridges Street, where the Theatre Royal opened in 1663. Prince Cosimo III of Tuscany visited the Lisle theatre in 1669, and his official diarist left us this account: > [The pit] is surrounded within by separate compartments in which there are > several degrees [steps] of seating for the greater comfort of the ladies and > gentlemen who, according to the liberal custom of the country, share the > same boxes. Down below [in the pit] there remains a broad space for other > members of the audience. The scenery is entirely changeable, with various > transformations and lovely perspectives. Before the play begins, to render > the waiting less annoying and inconvenient, there are very graceful > instrumental pieces to be heard, with the result that many go early just to > enjoy this part of the entertainment.Langhans p. 16. It was once believed > that Cosimo III attended the Theatre Royal in Bridges Street, not the > theatre in Lincoln's Inn Fields. Thomas Betterton painted by Sir Godfrey Kneller. The theatre was implicated by the Grand Jury of Middlesex on 7 July 1703 for showcasing \\"profane, irrelevant, lewd, indecent, and immoral expressions\\". It was also a hot target for riots and disorderly assemblies, murders, and other misdemeanors, but despite its troubles, the theatre remained very popular including hosting the first paid performance of Purcell's Dido and Aeneas in 1700 and Handel's final two operas (Pedicord 41). Davenant died in 1668 and the Duke's Company, now under Thomas Betterton, performed out of Lincoln's Inns Fields until 1671, when they relocated to the elaborate new Dorset Garden Theatre which was more popular at the time. In 1672, the theatre in Bridges Street burnt down, and the King's Company temporarily occupied the recently vacated Lincoln's Inn Field, until their new theatre opened in 1674.  Betterton and Rich  The building was converted back to a tennis court and remained one for almost 20 years. During that time, the Duke's Company, occupying the Dorset Theatre, subsumed the King's Company, housed in the newly rebuilt Theatre Royal, to form the United Company, performing out of Drury Lane. Betterton, a famous English actor, was forced out as the head of the company in 1688, staying on as an actor (and filling a day-to-day managerial role) while a succession of leaders embezzled funds and cut costs by cutting actors' salaries. This uniting created many conflicts between the members of the companies. For example, each company would have one actor who would always play Hamlet, but when the companies are combined, who claims the role? Due to rivalry and competition within the United Company, Thomas Betterton petitioned to the king to separate and create his own company. So, under Christopher Rich, the United Company split. Betterton left with a band of actors and a newly issued license to perform, and from 1695 to 1705 his company performed back at Lincoln's Inn Fields Playhouse, refurbishing the abandoned building back into a theatre. The New Theatre in Lincoln's Inn Fields opened in April 1695 with William Congreve's Love for Love.Donohue p. 7. It was later the first venue for Congreve's plays The Mourning Bride (1697) and The Way of the World (1700). The building went unused as a theatre from 1705 until it was demolished in 1714 or shortly before, in preparation to build a new theatre. The man behind the new construction was none other than Christopher Rich, who after 16 years of management, had been pushed out of Drury lane. Rich died in 1714, but his son John Rich led a company at the theatre until 1728. On 29 January 1728, Rich's theatre hosted the first, very successful, production of John Gay's The Beggar's Opera (making \\"Rich gay and Gay rich\\"). The theatre was abandoned in December 1732, when the company moved to the new Covent Garden Theatre, built by Rich using the capital generated by The Beggar's Opera. A few years later Henry Giffard moved his company from Goodman's Fields at a time when he was trying to establish a third major theatre company in London. The Licensing Act 1737 largely dashed these hopes, although he continued to stage plays at Lincoln's Inn for several more years. The old building was subsequently used as a barracks, an auction room, a warehouse for china, and was finally demolished in 1848 to make room for an extension to the neighbouring premises of the Royal College of Surgeons.

The year of birth given in this book, 1920, and related age data, are erroneous per the preceding source (the athlete himself) and the cited obituaries.Distance running inspiration Ted Corbitt passes away at 88 was an American long- distance runner and an official of running organizations. Corbitt is often called \\"the father of long distance running.\\" He was an ultramarathon pioneer, helping to revive interest in the sport in the United States in the 1960s and 1970s. New York Times columnist Robert Lipsyte called Corbitt a \\"spiritual elder of the modern running clan\\". In a Runner's World feature honoring lifetime achievement, writer Gail Kislevitz called Corbitt a \\"symbol of durability and longevity\\". Corbitt also developed standards to accurately measure courses and certify races. The technique involved the use of a calibrated bicycle and has been adopted worldwide. Personal and professional life The grandson of slaves, Corbitt was born on a cotton farm near Dunbarton, South Carolina. He ran shorter track events in high school and at the University of Cincinnati. Due to the racial discrimination common at the time, he was sometimes banned from track meets when white athletes refused to compete against him, nor was he sometimes able to stay in the same lodgings while traveling to competitions, even in the South during the 1950s. After army service in World War II, attending on the G.I. Bill, Corbitt earned a graduate degree in physical therapy from New York University, where he later lectured. He was a physiotherapist for more than 40 years.\\"Ted Corbitt, a Pioneer in American Distance Running, Dies at 88\\" (New York Times obituary by Frank Litsky) Retrieved 2007-12-13  Racing and training  Corbitt joined the nation's first integrated running organization, the New York Pioneer Club, in 1947.\\"Theodore Corbitt 1919‚Äì2007 An American Pioneer\\", Gary Corbitt.

He competed in the Marathon at the 1952 Summer Olympics in Helsinki. In January 1954, he won the Philadelphia Marathon, the first of his four wins in that city's event. In May 1954, he won the Yonkers Marathon, becoming the U.S. National Marathon Champion. At various times, Corbitt held the U.S. distance running records for 25 miles, the marathon, 40 miles, 50 miles and 100 miles. He remained a nationally competitive runner well into his fifties. On April 15, 1974, Corbitt finished his last Boston Marathon at age 55. His time of 2:49:16 was only 34 seconds slower than his 1951 time. In 1974 race, he wore patches and wires on his chest for a medical experiment done by San Francisco physician-researcher and pioneer female marathoner, Dr. Joan Ullyot. He competed in 223 marathons in his extended career. For many years, Corbitt ran more than 20 miles a day from his home near Broadway and the Harlem River, in The Bronx, New York City, to his office in downtown Manhattan. On some days, he also ran back home. At his peak, Corbitt ran up to 200 miles a week, far more than almost any other distance runner, though workouts by his English contemporary, Arthur Keily, mirrored his exhausting regimen. Corbitt ran most of his training miles at a fast pace. One of his standard workouts involved running 17 miles on a track, followed by 13 miles on roads. During one week in 1962, Corbitt ran 300 miles. He then traveled to England and competed in the 54 mile London to Brighton road race, finishing fourth. In his final ultra-distance race, held in 2003, he completed 68 miles in a 24-hour race at Brooklyn's Flushing Meadow Park.  Other contributions to running  Corbitt served as an unpaid official of many running organizations, including the Amateur Athletic Union. He was the co- founder and first president of the New York Road Runners and third President of Road Runners Club of America. He helped plan the New York City Marathon course. Corbitt served on various boards and committees for over 50 years. He helped create the masters division for runners over 40. In the early 1960s, Corbitt's influence was second to none in the adoption of precision measurement and certification of road race courses in the United States. Until that time, the practice had regularly been haphazard, with officials often simply driving a vehicle on a course and watching its speedometer. Corbitt's measurement method involved carefully calibrating a bicycle wheel, then riding the courses with it, mechanically counting the number of revolutions. This technique was based on the work of John Jewell of Great Britain.\\"John Jewell - the developer of modern course measurement in England\\" This Jones Counter method is still in use today. In 1998, Corbitt was among the first five runners to be inducted into the National Distance Running Hall of Fame. Corbitt was also inducted into the American Ultrarunning Hall of Fame, on its inauguration in April 2006. In 2003, at 84, Corbitt completed a 24-hour race by walking 68 miles, finishing 17th in a field of 35. Some runners were awed by his presence; others had no idea who he was. At 87, he was still volunteering at ultramarathon races in New York and sometimes even competing. He continued to treat physiotherapy patients. At the time of his death, Corbitt had embarked on a project to walk all the streets of Manhattan. Corbitt never smoked and his only drink was a single can of beer while in the army. He practised self-massage, carefully chewed every mouthful of food, and drank much water. He was a soft-spoken and gentle man who rarely spoke. He was an avid photographer and would attend many athletic events sporting a 35-mm camera until he died, in Houston, Texas.

Signal stations were the only practical mean of communicating with passing ships until the development of radio, and played a critical role in both navigation safety and commercial operation of fleets. As they were normally located in high places with extensive fields of view, surviving signal stations are often in scenic locations, and have become local landmarks. Signal stations used a variety of means to communicate shore-to- ship: Chappe Telegraph or other forms of pole-and-arm optical telegraph, flag semaphore, heliograph, slat semaphore, and port-specific signals (like flag and ball weather warnings). The most widespread method was through different forms of flaghoist. Signals were often private signals, requiring local knowledge or code books. Lloyds Signal Station at the Lizard, CornwallFrom the 1880s, Lloyd's operated a network of signal stations around the world, connected to telegraph land-lines, that served to relay orders from owners and obtain reports from ships' masters. Messages for passengers could also be sent using a flag semaphore, and light signals at night. Current roles While radio has superseded the telegraph-relay role of signal stations, a number of signal stations remain in operation in situations where static visual signals provide fast access to specific safety information, such as traffic signalling in ports and narrow passages, or navigational warnings. In Japan, signal stations in the form of lighted letter boards are extensively used to mark traffic conditions, one way flows and predominant currents. Most ports elsewhere in the world will use a form of the International Port Traffic Signals system. Tide gauges are usually classified as signal stations, as they provide immediate visual information of tide levels.

While in exile from South Africa's apartheid regime, Kunene was an active supporter and organizer of the anti-apartheid movement in Europe and Africa. He would later teach at University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA), and become Africa's and South Africa's poet laureate. Early life Kunene was born in Durban, in the modern province of KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa, to Eva Kunene (nee Ngcobo), a teacher, and Mdabuli Albert Kunene, a labourer. From very early in his childhood he began writing poetry and short stories in Zulu, and by the age of 11 he was being published in local papers. He went on to earn a Bachelor of Arts degree from the University of Natal in Zulu and history, and later a Master of Arts in Zulu Poetry. His Master's thesis was titled An Analytical Survey of Zulu Poetry, Both Traditional and Modern. In it Kunene criticized the changing nature of Zulu literature, and its emulation of the Western tradition. He won a Bantu Literary Competition in 1956 and left for London, England, to study at the School of Oriental and African Studies, University of London, in 1959. Career He opposed the apartheid government as the head of the African United Front. Fleeing into exile from the country in 1959, he helped push for the anti-apartheid movement in Britain between 1959 and 1968. Kunene was closely affiliated with the African National Congress (ANC), quickly becoming their main representative in Europe and the United States in 1962. He would later become the director of finance for the ANC in 1972. He became a Professor of African literature at the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA), in 1975 after lecturing in a number of universities (including the University of Iowa and Stanford University)\\"Mazisi Kunene\\", Encyclopaedia Britannica. as a cultural advisor for UNESCO. He remained at UCLA for nearly two decades, retiring in 1992.The Associated Press, \\"Mazisi Kunene, 76, South African Poet Laureate\\", The New York Times, 22 September 2006. Literary works Kunene wrote and published poetry from very early in his life. His works were written originally in Zulu and then translated into English. In 1966, his works were banned by the Apartheid government of South Africa. In 1969, he wrote an Introduction to the translation by John Berger and Anna Bostock of Aim√© C√©saire's Return to My Native Land. In 1970, Kunene published Zulu Poems, an anthology of poems ranging from \\"moral reflection to political commentary.\\" In Emperor Shaka the Great, published in English in 1979, Kunene tells the story of the rise of the Zulu people under Shaka. World Literature Today contributor Christopher Larson described it as \\"a monumental undertaking and achievement by any standards.\\"World Literature Today, summer 1983, cited in \\"Mazisi Kunene\\" Contemporary Authors Online, Gale, 2006. Reproduced in Biography Resource Center, Farmington Hills, Mich.: Thomson Gale. 2006.

Anthem of the Decades:A Zulu Epic published in English in 1981 tells the Zulu legend of how death came to mankind. In 1982, Kunene published a second collection of poems titled The Ancestors and the Sacred Mountain: Poems containing 100 of his poems. This collection had a particular emphasis on socio-political topics. Unodumehlezi Kamenzi was published in 2017 on the tenth anniversary of his death.

Depending on the implemented BIOS and configuration the IT8212F functions in either a RAID or an ATAPI mode, supporting up to four devices using dual channels. The raid mode only supports IDE Hard Disk Drives and includes RAID 0, RAID 1, Raid 0+1 and JBOD, along with a \\"normal\\" mode that essentially acts as a standard Hard Disk controller. Optical disk drives such as CD-ROM and DVD drives are supported by the ATAPI mode, which also supports Hard Disk Drives at the loss of all RAID functions. RAID functions are implemented by an embedded microprocessor, thus is not a so-called \\"Soft raid\\" controller. Devices based on ITE's IT8212F fall into two distinct forms: add-on cards, and components embedded into the motherboards of personal computers. ITE make neither of these end products, instead selling either the controller or manufacture rights, along with reference designs, to third parties for use in their end products. Different implementations have significant incompatibilities, requiring BIOS updates and/or converting from one feature set to another in driver code, causing inconvenience to users. The controller's BIOS is normally stored in a dedicated on-board Flash Memory Device, except that when the controller is integrated into a motherboard its BIOS and the motherboard's BIOS are often combined into one. Upgrading the BIOS can be difficult at best. Some controllers have one-time programmable memory chips, which cannot be altered at all. Others use devices not supported by ITE's BIOS-flashing utility, though some users have reported success with the utility Uniflash. The BIOS cannot be configured for both RAID and ATAPI functioning at once, so users may be prevented by a manufacturer's decision from changing between these modes. The IT8212F is, according to ITE's Preliminary Specification V0.3, compliant with the ATAPI-6 specification, supporting transfer modes PIO modes 0,1,2,3 and 4, DMA modes 0,1 and 2 along with UDMA modes 0,1,2,3,4,5 and 6.

Early life He was born on April 11, 1879 in the town of Hedaogang (), Sanyuan County (north of Xi'an), Shaanxi Province, Qing China. His father was Xin Sangong and his mother surnamed Zhao. In 1880, while his father was on business in Sichuan, his mother died and so his aunt brought him to live with her in the village of Yangfu where they lived together for 9 years. After a short stint as a goat herder, he went to a private school at the Mawang Temple in Yangfu and studied under Mr. Diwu. In 1889, he returned with his aunt to Sanyuan and entered the school of Mao Banxiang, under whom he began to study archaic and modern forms of poetry. On occasion, he also had the chance to read a few poems by such Southern Song patriots as Wen Tianxing and Xie Fangde. At the age of 17, he came in first place on entrance examinations and went on to study at the schools like the Dao Academy in Sanyuan, Weijing Academy in Jingyang, and Guanzhong Academy. In 1898, he married Miss Gao Zhonglin.http://webtitle.nmh.gov.tw/yuyouren/41_cn.html Revolutionary beginnings Yu Youren In 1900, at the age of 22, Yu Youren wrote a letter for the Pacification Commissioner of Shaanxi, Cen Chunxuan, imploring him to take the opportunity of assassinating the Empress Dowager Cixi who was fleeing to Xi'an during the Boxer Rebellion, which would provide the impetus for true reform of the government, but Yu was stopped from sending it by his classmate Wang Linsheng. Yu wrote many poems venting anger and frustration with the government. These were collected into a book entitled Poetry Drafts from the Hall of Tears and Mockery. His friend Meng Yimin helped Yu to have it published. In 1903, he passed the civil service examinations to become a Provincial Graduate (juren), but due to the satiric contents of Poetry Drafts from the Hall of Tears and Mockery, the government branded him a revolutionary. Wanted by the Qing government, Yu fled and sought refuge in Shanghai. With help from Ma Xiangbo, he was able to enter the Aurora Academy (later Aurora University (Shanghai)) under the assumed named of Liu Xueyu. Along with Ye Zhongyu and others, Yu established the Fudan College (later Fudan University) in memory of his days at Aurora (using the same character dan in Zhendan, the Chinese name of Aurora, and adding the character fu, for \\"reviving\\" China). Ma Xiangbo was elected as school president. In 1906, Yu fled to Japan and while there was able to meet Sun Yat-sen and the Tongmenghui through the introduction of Kang Xinfu and he thereafter officially joined the Tongmenghui. After returning to China in 1907, Yu started a newspaper called The National Herald (also known as the Shenzhou Daily), but its facilities were destroyed in a fire less than a year later. In the following year, Yu's father died. In March 1909, Yu established another newspaper called The People's Voice (Minzhu Bao) in Shanghai, strongly condemning the culture of corruption in government. Attracting the attention of officials, he was arrested and sent to jail, and the newspaper was closed in June 1909. Released from jail and still undaunted, he established another newspaper called The People's Sigh (Minxu Bao) but less than two months later it was shut down and he was thrown in jail again. In 1910, he established yet another newspaper called the Min Li Pai, the offices of which virtually served as the contact headquarters for the Chinese Revolutionary Alliance.http://webtitle.nmh.gov.tw/yuyouren/41_cn.html Post Xinhai Revolution Yu Youren, Shanghai University In 1912, Yu Youren was nominated to the post of Deputy Minister of Transportation and Communication, but less than three months later is forced to resign along with Sun Yat-sen's government. After Yuan Shikai took control of the government and the Min Li Bao is shut down, Yu was placed on the wanted list by Yuan Shikai's government. In 1918, Yu returned to his native Shaanxi Province, where he became commander of forces responsible for revolutionary activities in the northwest. In 1922, his post as commander is disbanded and he returns to Shanghai where he established Shanghai University along with Ye Chucang and assumes the post as president of the school. In 1925, he is ordered to organize along with Wu Zhihui, Wang Jingwei, and others the political affairs committee to handle party affairs. In 1927, Yu becomes a standing member of the Nationalist government committee. In the following year, he is also appointed as the Director of Audit. In 1932, Yu assumed the post of Director of the Control Yuan.http://www.yuyouren.com/InfoShow.asp?ArticleID=449 In 1936, Yu collects examples of Chinese characters and compiles them into the \\"Thousand character essay in Standard Cursive Script\\" as the book Standard Cursive Script, the first edition of which is published. Yu also donated his entire collection of more than three hundred rubbings from Stele to the Xi'an Forest of Stele Museum. In 1941, along with other members of the art and cultural world, Yu takes the initiative to name the fifth day of the fifth lunar month every year as Poets' Day. Yu also meets the modern painting master Zhang Daqian at Dunhuang in Northwest China and comes to realize the amount of destruction that has occurred to the art and cultural heritage at Dunhuang. After returning to the government headquarters in Chongqing, he immediately proposes that a Dunhuang Art Academy be established.

In arranging his diaries in 1962, Yu wrote poetry revealing pain at not being able to return to his hometown in China. Yu died from pneumonia in 1964 at Taipei Veterans General Hospital and in 1967 his remains were interred at Datun Mountain in Taipei's Yangmingshan National Park.

Its traditional bounds are the Woonasquatucket River, the Chad Brown public housing complex, Interstate 95 and West River. The Roger Williams Medical Center (RWMC) is located in the Smith Hill neighborhood and is adjacent to the VA hospital. The Rhode Island State House is also located on the border with Downtown. The name 'Smith Hill' is therefore used as a metonym for the Rhode Island state government and the Rhode Island General Assembly.  History  Providence neighborhoods with Smith Hill in red The neighborhood gets its name from settler John Smith, who set up a grist mill here in 1636, after being banished from England. Prior to the mid-1800s, the area was considered rural escape from downtown, with few homes. However, in the 1900s industrialization attracted immigrants from Ireland, Eastern Europe and the Balkans to work in nearby mills. The neighborhood's proximity to the Woonasquatucket and Moshassuck Rivers provided power for the industrial mills. In the 21st Century, Smith Hill is home to about 6,000 people in a densely populated residential neighborhood. The location offers easy access to downtown, featuring small parks, a post office, a library branch, and the Harry Kizirian Elementary School. The Smith Hill Partners Initiative (SHPI) plans community events.  Demographics  The neighborhood is home to whites of European descent and an increasing number of minorities. As of the 1990 census, Smith Hill was 20% Hispanic, 17.2% Asian and 12.2% black. The neighborhood's unemployment and poverty rates are above average for the city, though efforts have been made to revitalize the area, although, without success.

Avramoviƒá also translated from German into Serbian Johann Joachim Winckelmann's Geschichte der Kunst des Alterthums (\\"The History of Art in Antiquity\\") and other writings. He is considered the father of modern comic strips in Serbia. His caricatures were used to fight against the authoritarian rule of the masses in both the Austrian Empire and the Ottoman Empire at the time.https://www.vreme.com/cms/view.php?id=512477&print;=yes Works He wrote two scholarly books on art from Mount Athos after visiting the monasteries there, Opisanie drevnosti Srbski u svetoi (Atonskoi) Gori (1847) He was born in ≈†ajka≈°, where he, as a boy, moved with his family to Novi Sad where he started schooling. In 1833 he went to Vienna for the first time, then again in 1835. He studied painting in Vienna privately with Friedrich Amerling, and then in 1836 to 1839 he was enrolled at the Academy of Fine Arts. His professor of history was Leopold Kupelwieser. In 1840, Avramoviƒá came to Belgrade, perhaps following the recommendation of Vuk Karad≈æiƒá, and in the following year, in 1841, he began to work on painting icons and walls (frescoes) in the Cathedral Church in Belgrade (completed in 1845), the iconostasis and walls of the Karadjordjevich church in the town of Topola, the iconostasis of the Vrdnik-Ravanica Monastery, and the Orthodox Church in Futog. While painting the iconostasis in Topola, he visited the medieval monasteries in Serbia in 1846, including Manasija and Ravanica. Then he began to write about monuments in Serbia. The following year, thanks to Jovan Sterija Popoviƒá, he received funds to travel to the Holy Mountain, better known as Mount Athos in Greece, and do research. That same year (1847), he was elected honorary member of the Serbian Academy of Sciences and Arts, becoming the first Serbian artist to whom such an honour was bestowed. Saint Sava, 1852 In the 1848 Hungarian Revolution erupted, and Avramovic then actively participated in a propaganda battle drawing political cartoons. In this activity, he became a pioneer who launched the art of caricature in Serbia. In 1851 Avramoviƒá married, and next year he moved to Novi Sad, where he made his permanent home. Between 1852 and 1853 Avramoviƒá painted the iconostasis and walls (frescoes) in the Vrdnik-Ravanica Monastery in Fruska Gora, then began painting the iconostasis in St. John the Sajkaca, and then, in 1855, began to paint the church of Saints Kuzman and Damjan in Old Futog. In parallel, he published cartoons, articles and historical contributions in several magazines. His composition Apotheosis of Lukijan Mu≈°icki is considered to be the first classicist composition in Serbian painting. His life's desire was to paint the iconostasis of the church in his native ≈†ajka≈°, but his premature death did not allow him to complete his work. Along the churches and monasteries, his works are kept in the National Museum in Belgrade and at the Gallery of Matica Srpska in Novi Sad. He died of a heart attack in Novi Sad in 1855. He was 40.

Anti-war cartoon depicting a widow grieving the death of her husband alongside their children playing with a toy rifle and soldiers. Anti-patriotism is the ideology that opposes patriotism; it usually refers to those with cosmopolitan views and is usually of an internationalist and anti-nationalist nature as well. Normally, anti- patriotism stems from the belief that patriotism is wrong since people born in a country, whether they like it or not and regardless of their individuality, are encouraged to love the country or sacrifice themselves for it; consequently, people who oppose patriotism may oppose its perceived authoritarianism, while others may believe that patriotism may lead to war because of geopolitical disputes. Usually, this term is used in a pejorative way by those who defend patriotism or nationalism, and terms such as cosmopolitanism or world citizenship may be used to avoid the bias that comes from the typical usage of the words anti-patriot or anti-patriotism. Sometimes anti patriotical groups and individuals are often used as a form of Active measures against own country by other country or some third side, especially during Cold war. The idea of multiple cultures intertwined has also been questioned as anti-patriotic, but mainly in smaller social communities: colleges, universities, etc. The Espionage Act of 1917 and the Sedition Act of 1918 were pieces of legislation in the United States that were passed after it entered World War I, to incriminate individuals who attempted to impede the war effort. Those who did so were punished and believed to be performing acts of anti-patriotism.  Examples of US Supreme Court cases that deal with anti- patriotism   Texas v. Johnson (1989)  During a protest outside the Republican Party‚Äôs 1984 national convention, Gregory Johnson burned an American flag, he was then arrested and charged with violating a state law. Johnson asserted that his right to burn the American flag was protected by the First Amendment. The case was then brought to the United States Supreme Court. The Supreme Court ruled by a 5-4 decision that Johnson‚Äôs conviction was unconstitutional. Justice William Brennan, in his majority opinion asserted that the act of burning a flag was considered an expressive activity which is protected by the First Amendment. Although, four members of the Supreme Court argued that his actions were forms of anti-patriotism, and therefore punishable and unprotected by the First Amendment. In Chief Justice William Rehnquist's dissenting opinion he asserted that the American flag is a visible symbol for the country and therefore should be preserved. Rehnquist argued that burning the flag expressed disapproval and anti-patriotism for the nation‚Äôs policy, and was therefore a symbolic desecration of the U.S. in its entirety.  Schenck v. United States (1919)  The Espionage Act of 1917 was a piece of legislation that was passed to punish and criminalize individuals who impeded the war effort by interfering with military recruitment and supporting foreign enemies; the act was passed shortly after the U.S. declared war on Germany. Some opposed the war, specifically the American Socialist Party, who publicly declared their disapproval. Charles Schenck was the general secretary for the American Socialist Party, who opposed the war and exhibited that disapproval by distributing pamphlets that vilified Woodrow Wilson‚Äôs administration and insisted that the draft was unconstitutional. The court unanimously ruled that Schenck‚Äôs distribution of the pamphlets posed a clear and present danger to the national security of the U.S. The court ruled that because of this, his speech was not protected by the First Amendment and was simultaneously in violation of the Espionage Act of 1917. The act of deterring individuals from registering for the draft during wartime can be seen as an act of anti-patriotism as it condemns the U.S. government.  Abrams v. United States (1919)  In this case, the Supreme Court of the United States ruled that those who provoked and promoted resistance to the war were in direct violation of the Espionage Act, and their speech was not protected by the First Amendment. The provocation of a riot and strike in order to hurt the war effort was seen as an act of anti-patriotism. Abrams attempted to make the workers in ammunition factories go on strike. Therefore, because Abrams acted in a way that was directly attempting to damage the war effort of the U.S., his actions can be seen as acts of anti- patriotism. Justice Oliver Wendell Holmes argued that this act did not present a clear and present danger to national security and free speech should not be limited because of that. It is reasonable to conclude that in this case, Abrams was acting in violation of the Espionage Act because he attempted to impede the war effort.

Bell and Lee Phillip Bell. \\"Cricket\\" (as the character was originally called) was introduced in 1983 as a teen model, developing into a lawyer and district attorney. In 2001, Bell asked to be moved to recurring status after maternity leave, though she returned to regular status the following year. In 2005, she returned to recurring for another year. In 2007, the character was brought over to The Bold and the Beautiful by executive producer Bradley Bell, the actress' real-life brother, for a short-term stint, returning to The Young and the Restless in 2010, where she continues to make recurring appearances. Christine has been married to rock singer Danny Romalotti (Michael Damian), a union that lasted four years until he left her to be with Phyllis Summers (Michelle Stafford), a woman he believed to be pregnant with his child. This sparked an ongoing rivalry between the two women that continues to present time. Later, she became involved with investigator Paul Williams (Doug Davidson) and, although their first marriage ended after five years, they continued as friends. After 12 years apart, Christine and Paul re-married at Katherine Chancellor's funeral. Bell's performance has garnered her a Daytime Emmy Award nomination for Outstanding Supporting Actress in a Drama Series in 2016. Casting Beginning in 1983 at the age of thirteen, Lauralee Bell is the sole actress to portray the role. In 1986, she was given a contract. In 2001, after fifteen years as a regular, Bell only made sporadic appearances after returning from a maternity leave. The following year, she returned as a regular for a bigger storyline, though later took another leave of absence, slated to be shorter than the last. She returned in January 2003, remaining as a regular until 2005 when she was bumped back to recurring upon request. She appeared on The Bold and the Beautiful in June 2007. In 2008, Bell was asked for a short term reprisal, though declined the offer, explaining she would return if \\"the show crafts a substantial storyline for her\\". Bell explained in an interview that she'd \\"never been pressured so much in the nicest way when she was asked to come back\\". In 2010, it was announced that Bell would return to The Young and the Restless. Since then, the actress has remained on recurring status.

She was forced to grow and toughen up after being raped by Derek Stuart (Ken Olandt). Despite being traumatized, Cricket decided to press charges, which in turn allowed for more victims of Derek to come out. Derek vowed revenge on Cricket and even tried to shoot her, but Scott saved Cricket and took the bullet. Derek tried to escape by jumping through a window, but ended up falling to his death. This experience moved Cricket away from modeling to pursue a legal career. She also abandoned the nickname \\"Cricket\\" for her full first name, Christine. While working at the Whitman, Walker, and Wilson firm, she was sexually harassed by fellow lawyer Michael Baldwin (Christian LeBlanc). She taped their conversations and got him fired, which only pushed Michael to stalk her and eventually kidnap her, then hold her captive for days before she was rescued by Paul Williams (Doug Davidson) and Nathan Hastings (Randy Brooks). Michael was put in prison. Christine found love again in Scott Grainger Sr. (Peter Barton) and they even got engaged, but it turned that they shared a father and the relationship ended. Christine and Danny Romalotti's (pictured) marriage was thwarted by Phyllis Summers. In 1990, Christine married her longtime friend Danny Romalotti (Michael Damian), but their marriage ended when Danny cheated on her with a fan of his, Phyllis Summers (Michelle Stafford), who became pregnant. Years later, it was discovered that the baby ‚Äì Daniel Romalotti ‚Äì was not Danny's biological son. Also, it was learned that Phyllis drugged Danny and made him think they had slept together. Christine's business life, on the other hand, was quite successful. She defended many residents of the town and accompanied Paul Williams on various adventures, including one where they traveled to Vietnam to find Jack Abbott's long-lost son, Keemo Volien. The two fell in love and planned to get married, but were prevented by Phyllis, who ran them over in December 1994, leaving Paul in bad health. Just before the accident, Christine shared a brief kiss with Danny, obliviously enough to make Phyllis jealous. At the time, it was never publicly known that Phyllis ran them over. Christine later discovered this in July 2012 and Phyllis was then prosecuted. As for Christine, she reunited with Danny after the accident, but she ended up choosing to stay with Paul and they were later married by 1996. With Paul and Christine finally married, the two planned to have children, but their careers ended up taking away time and began to strain their marriage. Once Michael Baldwin returned from prison, he convinced Christine that he was a changed man and she testified for him in court. She and Michael ended up starting up a very successful legal practice. Christine ended up taking up a case in Hong Kong and convinced Paul to come along, but he backed out at the last minute. The case ended up taking months, and when it finished, she was offered a new case in Australia. She turned it down to return to Genoa City to repair her marriage. Yet, when she returned she found Paul in bed with his new client Isabella Bra√±a (Eva Longoria). She took the job in Australia and left. Isabella ended up pregnant but claimed that a brief romance she had with Michael led to the pregnancy. In reality, Paul was the father, but Isabella didn't tell him because she felt that he was still in love with Christine. The truth quickly came out and Paul wanted to be with Isabella to do right by the child. Christine ended up building a romance with Michael. Michael proudly announced to Paul that he got engaged to Christine, which angered Paul who punched Michael and then forced himself on Christine, although Chris never said no to him. Paul was, at the time, married to Isabella. Several months later, Christine went to see Paul in L.A. and made love with him, then disappeared for a few weeks, leaving Michael and Paul wondering what's going on. Paul's marriage to Isabella was over when he admitted the truth to her. Christine returned, after a short absence, disguised as Kelly Simmons, keen on finding out more about Isabella. Paul knew the truth and decided to stick with Isabella, while Christine went back to Michael. The two were going to get married, but Michael admitted the truth about plotting with Isabella to ensure Christine stayed away from Paul. Christine, in turn, rushed back to Paul, and they made love on the beach. Isabella plotted revenge against the couple and made it look like Christine had murdered her, then went to attack Chris in a bathtub. Paul saved Chris, and then they were both saved by Michael. Christine and Paul moved in together, but decided to part ways when Chris didn't accept Paul's proposal. Chris decided to concentrate on her new job, being a prosecutor, but several months later realized that she didn't like the job. Christine started dating her ex-husband Danny Romalotti again, but he left town before anything more serious could happen. Since then, Christine was only seen working on cases, mainly defending people in trouble, including Daniel Romalotti, Jr. (Michael Graziadei) when he was accused of manslaughter, and she was also seen defending Ridge Forrester (Ron Moss) in Los Angeles. 2010‚Äî Christine returned to Genoa City in July 2010, unsure whether to stay or go back to Washington, D.C. Her return also coincided with her anniversary to with ex- husband Paul Williams. They ended up making love, but Paul realized it was a mistake given that he was now in a relationship with Christine's old friend Nina Webster. Nina actually saw Christine and Paul kiss that night and quickly her romance with Paul was strained, as was her friendship with Christine. Hurting their friendship even more was that Christine knew that the police detective Ronan Malloy was actually Nina's long-lost son. Ronan was actually FBI, working undercover to expose some dirty cops that Nina's other son, Chance Chancellor, was being blackmailed by. Eventually, Ronan shot and killed Chance just as Nina found out about their connection. Yet, a few weeks later it was learned that Chance faked his death and was now in the Witness Protection Agency where only Nina, Paul, Christine, Ronan, and Phillip Chancellor III know the truth about him. Some months later, Christine returned again when Ronan was sick. Apparently, he was suffering from a liver condition that also plagued his biological father, and was going to need a liver transplant. Thanks to Christine, Chance was able to return and donate his liver to his half-brother. During his return, everyone else, including his grandmother, Jill Abbott Fenmore, Katherine Chancellor, and his former romance, Chloe Mitchell, learn the truth. Christine returned in November 2011 for a visit, in which she and Paul talk about his son Ricky Williams, and also recollect his psychotic mother, Isabella. Chance reveals to her that he will be working at the Pentagon and that he will be closer to her. Christine, Nina, and Paul decide to confront Ronan and ask him why he refuses to talk to them. He never really gives them a straight answer, but after a one-on-one with Christine, he feels bad about the way he has acted. Christine returns to Washington D.C. on November 9, 2011. Christine returned to Genoa City in May 2012 to represent the Department of Justice regarding the case the built against Genevieve Atkinson. Paul confides in her that he believes that Ricky might be like his mother, Isabella. She later has a sexual encounter with Danny Romalotti, who had recently returned to Genoa City as well. She returned to town in July to offer her support to Paul, announcing her decision to take a leave of absence in D.C. to defend Paul in his case of murder against his son, claiming no one else would be able to defend Paul as well as she could. During this time, Christine also learned the truth about Paul's and her car accident in December 1994; Phyllis Summers hit them. Phyllis denied it, but a credit card receipt connected Phyllis to it and later her admitting that she saw Christine and Danny kiss just before the accident gave Phyllis a motive. The trial was called off by the judge. Paul and Christine ended up beginning another relationship, and Christine decided to stay in Genoa City to become the new district attorney since Michael Baldwin had resigned. On September 3, 2013, Paul and Christine held an impromptu wedding ceremony following Katherine Chancellor's memorial service. Katherine suggested Paul propose in a letter written to him before her death that he received during Katherine's memorial. Paul and Christine marry the same day after brief preparations from close friends.

Biography Sculpture by Francavlla depicting Apollo's first triumph, when he slew with his bow and arrows the serpent Python (1591). The Walters Art Museum. Born at Cambrai, he received his early training as a draftsman in Paris. In 1565 he is recorded at Innsbruck, where Alexander Colin was working on the elaborate monument in the Hofkirche for the funerary monument to Emperor Maximilian I. In this project Franqueville learned enough of the practice of sculpture to enter the large Florentine atelier of his fellow countryman, Giambologna.Giambologna or Jean de Boulogne was born in Douai in 1529. Franqueville was provided with a letter of introduction from Archduke Ferdinand of Austria. Francavilla became his master's main assistant in the carving of marble, including the masterpiece of the Rape of the Sabines displayed in the Loggia dei Lanzi, Florence. His first independent commissions were extended to him through Giambologna, who become overwhelmed with requests. Francavilla's finished pen-and-ink drawings after the master's bozzetti for projects, as they were stored at the workshop, are in some cases the only testament to works that have been lost or that were never executed.Undated drawings of Giambologna modelli by Francavilla were purchased for the Victoria and Albert Museum in 1993 (see Ref. V&A;). In 1574, he began his first independent commission, eventually constituting thirteen garden sculptures for abbate Antonio di Zanobi Bracci for the Villa Bracci at Rovezzano near Florence. The thirteen were purchased through Sir Horace Mann, British envoy at Florence, for Frederick, Prince of Wales, who died without ever seeing them; they were left in storage at Kew and have been dispersed and ignored, then rediscovered in 1952.Apollo (1577) and Zephyr (1576) are at the Victoria and Albert Museum; four more from the series are among the sculptures in Sir Jeffrey Wyattville's East Terrace Garden, Windsor Castle; see A. H. Scott-Elliot, \\"The Statues by Francavilla in The Royal Collection\\" The Burlington Magazine 98 No. 636 (March 1956), pp. 76-84. A late example in the series, the Venus at the Wadsworth Atheneum, Hartford, is signed and dated 1600, and must have been made for or acquired by Bracci's nephew, who inherited the estate in 1585.Scott-Elliot 1956:77, 79 fig. 21. In 1585 Francavilla was elected to the Florentine Academy. In 1589 nearly all artists in Florence were recruited for the unprecedented decorations set up to celebrate the wedding of Ferdinando I de' Medici and Christina of Lorraine, including painted triumphal arches along the procession route.The wedding's elaborate temporary decorations were memorialized in the engravings of a festival book, published in 1589 (see Ref.) For the event, a temporary fa√ßade, designed by Giovanni Antonio Dosio, was erected for the Duomo; Francavilla provided sculptures of Saints Zenobius and Poggio. In 1590 he executed four marble sculptures of the Seasons to be erected at Bartolomeo Ammanati's Ponte Santa Trinita, Florence; they replaced the temporary sculptures of Roman heroes that had been erected for the wedding festivities. In 1598 he executed an Orpheus with Cerberus for the banker Jerome (Girolamo) de Gondi, gentleman of the King's bedchamber, whose Florentine family had emigrated to France in the train of Catherine de' Medici. Gondi placed it in a central fountain in the garden of his Paris h√¥tel in the suburban Faubourg Saint-Germain,It was accompanied by bronze figures of animals by Romolo Ferruzzi del Tadda. In 1612 H√¥tel Gondi became the H√¥tel Cond√© (see Ref. Presenze toscane), where it was much admired. It eventually found its way to the gardens of Versailles. Gondi's Ch√¢teau de Saint-Cloud was later purchased for Monsieur, brother of Louis XIV. The sculpture is now in the Louvre Museum. He intervened, probably only with drawings, in the new architectural fa√ßade provided for the Palazzo dei Priori, Pisa; the Gothic structure was unified under a scheme commenced by Vasari to create a Medicean focus in Pisa. In the renamed Piazza dei Cavalieri, Francavilla's monumental statue of Cosimo I reigned over the former Palazzo degli Anziani (\\"Palace of the Elders\\"), a former symbol of Pisan independence remade as a Medicean monument.See references at Piazza dei Cavalieri). He was invited to France by Henry IV in 1601, when Pietro Tacca took his place as Giambologna's premier assistant. When Marie de Medici, the Florentine-born queen of France, decided to erect an equestrian statue in honor of her husband, Henry IV, she awarded the commission to Giambologna, who had executed monuments to the grand dukes of Tuscany, Cosimo and Ferdinand I (at Arezzo) Following Giambologna's death (1608), the casting and finishing was executed by his pupil Pietro Tacca. When the bronze arrived in Paris, the queen commissioned a pedestal from Pierre Francqueville, as he was known in France. He modelled three bas-reliefs for the base to be cast in bronze and modeled four bound captives before his death. His pupil and son-in-law, Francesco Bordoni, who had followed Francavilla to France, cast and finished the bronzes, which were completed in 1618. Francavilla died in 1615. His portrait, executed in chalk, by Hendrik Goltzius in 1591, is in the Rijksmuseum.

On 3 May 2017, he was suspended for 4 years under the League's Anti-Doping Policy. His suspension will expire on 16 January 2021. Background Born in Singleton, NSW, he moved to Newcastle with his family when he was nine. Son of Leeann and Steve Mullen, a former rugby league footballer who played for the Canterbury Bulldogs and Western Suburbs Magpies in the 1980s. Playing career Early career Mullen played his first rugby league game aged seven for the Taree-Old Bar Lifesavers (now known as Taree Panthers). Two years later (after a brief stint playing soccer), Mullen relocated to Newcastle, where he continued his junior career with the Western Suburbs club. His first representative game was for St Therese's Primary School, New Lambton, in the Regional Knights Knockout competition, with the school winning the competition in 1996 and 1997. He played most of his junior football at five-eighth. Mullen joined the Knights as a junior in 1997. He played five-eighth for the NSW under-17s in 2004. While attending St. Francis Xavier's College in Hamilton, Mullen played for the Australian Schoolboys team in 2004 and 2005. 2005 Mullen kicks the ball in a game in 2009. Coach Michael Hagan picked Mullen for the first-grade squad aged 18. His first grade debut was on 15 May 2005 at Energy Australia Stadium against the Wests Tigers in round 10. Mullen played eight games for Newcastle in his debut year as the club finished last on the table. 2006 Mullen played 15 games for Newcastle in the 2006 NRL season as Newcastle qualified for the finals. Mullen played in the club's 50-6 elimination finals loss against the Brisbane Broncos at the Sydney Football Stadium. 2007 In 2007, Mullen was selected as starting five-eighth for the Knights. On 10 April 2007, the day after Mullen turned 20, Johns announced his shock retirement from rugby league due to a neck injury. Mullen became first-choice halfback. After playing nine first grade games as halfback and 31 games in total, he was a shock pick at that position for the New South Wales Blues in the 2007 State of Origin series. Mullen was dropped after one game, a match in which NSW let slip an 18-6 halftime lead to lose 25-18. He would never manage to gain selection for New South Wales again. 180px 2008-2016 Mullen continued to play for Newcastle and featured in the club's finals campaigns in 2009 and in 2013 where they reached the preliminary final against the Sydney Roosters under the coaching of Wayne Bennett. In 2015 and 2016, Mullen was part of the Newcastle sides which finished last on the table. 2017 During a pre-season training session in November 2016, Mullen was tested, with the A-sample testing positive for an anabolic steroid and he was provisionally suspended on 17 January 2017 by the NRL. Mullen's B-sample tested positive to the steroid Drostanolone, confirmed by the Australian Sports Anti-Doping Agency on 7 March 2017 and he was handed a Notice of Alleged Anti-Doping Rule Violations. Mullen is opting to challenge the matter with the anti-doping tribunal. Representative career Mullen was selected in his first senior representative team, the Prime Minister's XIII, for a game against Papua New Guinea in 2006. He played with a young team in Port Moresby on 30 September, starting on the bench as a utility player. In 2007, he was picked for the New South Wales side. Mullen was not selected in the NSW State of Origin team for Game 2 due to a torn calf muscle. In opening rounds of 2008, Mullen again showed promise but succumbed to a calf injury in Round 4. Outstanding performances on his return against competition leaders Gold Coast and Melbourne thrust him back into Origin contention, jostling for the halfback spot with Brisbane's Peter Wallace, Manly's Matt Orford and Parramatta's Brett Finch. Mullen has played for Country in the annual City vs Country on four occasions between 2009 and 2014. Controversy In March 2019, it was revealed that Mullen almost died of a drug overdose at a friend's party back in December 2018. Mullen was taken to hospital in a critical condition and spent two days in intensive care as a result. In the following days, the Newcastle Knights released a statement denying that any of the club's current players were at the party. Newcastle CEO Phil Gardner said \\"To the best of my knowledge, none of our top 36 were at any of those parties, I think the reports aren‚Äôt accurate. I don‚Äôt know why they‚Äôre being reported. But it certainly doesn‚Äôt represent the facts\\". On 4 December 2019, Mullen pleaded guilty at Newcastle Local Court to one charge of supplying cocaine. Mullen was arrested by police in May 2019 and was initially charged with four counts of supplying a prohibited drug. Agreed facts tendered to court stated Mullen purchased a total of 39 grams of cocaine from a co-offender between 23 and 30 November in 2018 for the purpose of supply and personal use. A pre-sentence report was scheduled ahead of his sentence in February 2020. On 26 February 2020, Mullen avoided jail and was instead given a two-year community corrections order and 300 hours of community service.

The tree was chopped down in the early 20th century. Koi pond in front of the Glover residence Overlooking Nagasaki harbor The garden Former Mitsubishi second dock house in Glover Garden is a park in Nagasaki, Japan, built for Thomas Blake Glover, a Scottish merchant who contributed to the modernization of Japan in shipbuilding, coal mining, and other fields. In it stands the Glover Residence, the oldest Western-style house surviving in Japan and Nagasaki's foremost tourist attraction. It is located on the Minamiyamate hillside overlooking Nagasaki harbor. It was built by Hidenoshin Koyama of Amakusa island and completed in 1863. It has been designated as an Important Cultural Asset. As the house and its surroundings are reminiscent of Puccini's opera, it is also known as the \\"Madame Butterfly House.\\" Statues of Puccini and diva Miura Tamaki, famed for her role as Cio-Cio-san, stand in the park near the house. This house was also the venue of Glover's meetings with rebel samurai, particularly from the Ch≈çsh≈´ and Satsuma domains. Glover Residence The Glover Residence is noted for its blend of Western and Japanese elements and is an example of treaty port building. This type of architecture closely resembles one-story bungalows used by foreigners in Hong Kong or Shanghai and imported to Japan by British traders. Rather than following contemporary Victorian styles, this type of building more closely reflects the Georgian aesthetic popular in Britain during the previous generation. The stone-floored verandas, latticed arches, and French windows are several of the distinctive foreign elements included in the residence, while Japanese influence can be seen in the tile roof with its demon-headed tiles intended to ward off evil. The roof was modified by adding unmistakably British chimneys. The house was built by a Japanese carpenter, Koyama Hidenoshin. The plan for the house, which is still preserved, is unsigned. The plan uses feet instead of Japanese measurements. The basic construction of the house is Japanese, despite its foreign elements. It consists of traditional Japanese roof supports and post-and-beam frames set down on boulders. Other buildings The park also includes Ringer House (built 1865 for Frederick Ringer) and Alt House (built for William Alt). The correct treatment of the Tuscan pillars and pediment at the Alt House suggest that this building was designed by a Western architect. The pediment is often conspicuously incorporated into Masonic temples, and might have been employed here in the same manner as a Masonic symbol.Alt House, Nagasaki Furthermore, the stone gate of the Nagasaki Masonic Lodge is preserved in Glover Garden: > The Nagasaki Masonic Lodge was inaugurated at No. 50 Oura on October 5, > 1885.

It features several vaudeville acts, including juggler Whitey Roberts, a man doing bicycle stunts, and a man, Tony Lovello, who plays the William Tell Overture and \\"Hungarian Dance No. 5\\" at breakneck speed on an accordion. The movie incorporates aspects of the twins' real life, including their singing act, a futile attempt by one sister to obtain a marriage license, and a publicity-stunt marriage. The twins' voices are featured in three duets, including \\"Every Hour of Every Day\\" and \\"Love Thief\\". The movie was directed by Harry L. Fraser. Plot Daisy and Violet Hilton about 1927 The movie opens with a judge (Norval Mitchell) begging the audience for help in resolving a terrible dilemma. The action moves to a courtroom, where Vivian Hamilton is on trial for the shooting death of her sister's lover. The story unfolds in flashback as various characters are called to testify. Conjoined twins Dorothy and Vivian Hamilton (Daisy and Violet Hilton) have a successful vaudeville singing act, but their manager Hinkley (Allen Jenkins) thinks a publicity stunt will reinvigorate their career. He pays stunt shooter Andre Pariseau (Mario Laval) to fake a romance with one of the twins. Vivian, the brunette, dislikes Andre and wants nothing to do with the scheme, but Dorothy, the blonde, quips that she is too old to turn down a chance at love, and agrees to serve as Andre's love interest. The ploy works, with \\"the girls\\" singing for standing room only crowds. But Dorothy actually falls in love with the scheming Andre, though he is secretly involved with his shooting-act partner, Renee (Patricia Wright). Andre proposes marriage, but the couple is unable to obtain a marriage license due to allegations that the marriage would constitute bigamy. A desperate Dorothy convinces Vivian to seek separation surgery, even at the risk of their lives, so that she can pursue her dreams of love. Doctors, however, inform the women that such surgery is impossible. But, the doctors stress, there is no physical reason that Dorothy can not marry. By consulting with a blind minister, Dorothy and Andre are able to obtain their marriage license. The wedding ceremony is performed on-stage before an audience of dignitaries including the mayor. But the next day, Andre leaves Dorothy, claiming that he could not adjust to life as the husband of a conjoined twin. Vivian knows differently, because she has seen Andre and Renee kissing passionately and her suspicions of Andre are confirmed. Vivian is outraged that her sister was mistreated. During Andre's shooting performance, Vivian seizes one of Andre's guns and shoots him dead before a horrified audience. Daisy and Violet Hilton in 1927 The film returns to the judge, who cannot decide how to dispose of the case. Justice for Andre requires that his murderer, Vivian, be executed. But this would cost the life of the innocent Dorothy. The film ends with a plea for the viewer to resolve the dilemma.

There she was the principal leading lady, performing under an enormous tent with Alec Guinness in All's Well That Ends Well and Richard III. \\"Binkie\\" Beaumont brought her back to London in N.C. Hunter's \\"Chekhovian\\" drama A Day by the Sea, with a cast that included John Gielgud and Ralph Richardson. She joined the Midland Theatre Company in Coventry for Ugo Betti's The Queen and the Rebels. Her transformation from \\"a rejected slut cowering at her lover's feet into a redemption of regal poise\\" ensured a transfer to London, where Kenneth Tynan wrote of her technique: \\"It is grandiose, heartfelt, marvellously controlled, clear as crystal and totally unmoving.\\" In the 1950s, Worth demonstrated her exceptional versatility by playing in the farce Hotel Paradiso in London with Alec Guinness, high tragedy in the title role of Schiller's Mary Stuart, co- starring Eva Le Gallienne, and on Broadway and Shakespearean comedy in As You Like It at Stratford, Ontario.

She then went to New York City in 1965 for the opening of Edward Albee's enigmatic Tiny Alice, in which she co- starred with John Gielgud and which won her the first of her three Tony Awards. She returned to the RSC at the Aldwych to repeat her role. She worked with Peter Brook in Paris and toured Iran with Orghast, Brook's attempt to develop an international theatre language. She joined the National Theatre at the Old Vic in 1968 to play Jocasta in Peter Brook's production of Seneca's Oedipus, opposite Gielgud. She was proud to have been in No√´l Coward's trilogy Suite in Three Keys, in which he made his last appearance on stage. In 1974, she appeared in three thematically linked plays at the Greenwich Theatre directed by Jonathan Miller under the umbrella title of Family Romances and using the same actors for each play. Worth took the roles of Gertrude in Hamlet, Madame Arkadina in Chekhov's The Seagull, and Mrs Alving in Ibsen's Ghosts. America Worth spent most of the 1970s in North America. She was an acclaimed Hedda Gabler at Stratford, Ontario, a role she considered one of her more satisfying achievements and which prompted Walter Kerr to write in The New York Times \\"Miss Worth is just possibly the best actress in the world.\\" She played Princess Kosmonopolis in Tennessee Williams's Sweet Bird of Youth opposite Christopher Walken, which brought her a second Tony Award. She was Madame Ranevskaya in The Cherry Orchard, for which she received another Tony nomination and which featured Ra√∫l Juli√°, Mary Beth Hurt and Meryl Streep, whose career was in its beginning stages. Toward the end of the decade she played Winnie in Beckett's Happy Days. Worth also appeared in the premiere of The Lady from Dubuque, another Albee play, which closed after 12 performances; a revival of Ibsen's John Gabriel Borkman; Toys in the Attic by Lillian Hellman; and The Golden Age by A.R. Gurney. The later years She starred as the goddess Athena in The National Radio Theater's 1981 Peabody Award-winning radio drama of The Odyssey of Homer. On screen in 1982, Worth co-starred with Michael Caine and Christopher Reeve in the film version of a Broadway murder mystery Deathtrap, playing a psychic. In 1984, Peter Hall invited her to return to the National Theatre to play Volumnia in Coriolanus, with Ian McKellen in the title role. The impresario Joseph Papp persuaded her to repeat Volumnia off-Broadway in a production by Steven Berkoff, when she again was partnered by Christopher Walken as Coriolanus. She was seen in David Hare's The Bay at Nice (National, 1987) and in Ch√®re Ma√Ætre (New York, 1998 and Almeida, London 1999), compiled by Peter Eyre from the letters of George Sand and Gustave Flaubert. Worth also starred along with Michael Hordern in George Bernard Shaw's play You Never Can Tell at the Theatre Royal, Haymarket in 1987 and 1998. In 1991, she won a third Tony for her performance as the tough-as-nails Grandma Kurnitz in Neil Simon's Lost in Yonkers, and later appeared in the film version along with Richard Dreyfuss and Mercedes Ruehl. In 1999, she appeared in the film Onegin. As she was about to begin preview performances in a Broadway revival of Anouilh's Ring Round the Moon, Worth had a stroke and never appeared in the production. She continued to act, and in September 2001, one of her later appearances was with Paul Scofield at the Almeida Theatre in the two-handed play I Take Your Hand in Mine, by Carol Rocamora based on the love letters of Anton Chekhov and Olga Knipper. Recitals During the mid-1960s in New York, Worth and Gielgud had collaborated in a series of dramatic readings, first from T.S. Eliot and Edith Sitwell and then from Shakespeare. It was a form of theatre at which she became more adept as she grew older, drawing from Virginia Woolf, Ivan Turgenev and No√´l Coward. She referred to them as \\"her recitals\\". In the mid-1990s, she devised and performed a two-hour monologue Portrait of Edith Wharton, based on Wharton's life and writings. Using no props, costumes or sets, she created characters entirely through vocal means. Death and funeral She died in 2002, following a second stroke in New York's Roosevelt Hospital, at the age of 85. At her memorial service, held at the Public Theater in New York City, numerous speakers paid tribute to her, including Edward Albee, Christopher Walken, Mercedes Ruehl, Gene Saks, Meryl Streep, Bernard Gersten, Alan Rickman, and pianist Horacio Gutierrez performed Liszt‚Äôs Sonetto 104 del Petrarca.Irene Worth Memorial https://www.nytimes.com/2002/05/29/arts/irene-worth-memorial.html Awards * Daily Mail Television Award The Lady from the Sea, 1953-54 * British Film Academy Award Best British Actress, Orders to Kill 1958 * Page One Award, Toys in the Attic 1960 * Tony Award for Best Actress (Dramatic), Tiny Alice 1965 * Evening Standard Award, Suite in Three Keys 1966 * Variety Club of Great Britain Award, Heartbreak House 1967 * Plays and Players London Theatre Critics Award Best Actress, Heartbreak House 1967 * Tony Award for Best Actress, Sweet Bird of Youth 1975-76 * Joseph Jefferson Award Best Actress in a Play, Sweet Bird of Youth 1975-76 * Drama Desk Award for Outstanding Actress, The Cherry Orchard 1977 * OBIE Award, The Chalk Garden 1981-82 * Emmy Award, \\"Live From Lincoln Center: Chamber Music Society of Lincoln Center with Irene Worth and Horacio Guti√©rrez\\" 1986 * OBIE Award, Sustained Achievement 1988-89 * Tony Award for Best Featured Actress, Lost in Yonkers 1991 * Drama Desk Award for Outstanding Featured Actress, Lost in Yonkers 1991 Honors * Irene Worth was appointed an honorary Commander of the Order of the British Empire (CBE) in 1975.

It features a hacker who creates an artificial intelligence named P-1, which goes rogue and takes over computers in its desire to survive and seek out its creator. The book questions the value of human life, and what it means to be human. It is one of the first fictional depictions of the nature of a computer virus and how it can spread through a computer system, although predated by John Brunner's The Shockwave Rider. Plot The story starts in 1974 with the protagonist, Gregory Burgess, enrolled at the University of Waterloo in Canada. At the time, Greg is aimless, taking various liberal arts courses and doing just well enough not to get kicked out of school. Everything changes one day when his friends introduce him to the IBM System/360 mainframe and he becomes \\"hooked\\", changing his major to computer science. During this time, he also meets his on-again-off-again girlfriend, Linda, a minor recurring character. After reading a Scientific American article on game theory outlining how to teach matchboxes to play tic-tac-toe, he becomes interested in using artificial intelligence techniques to crack systems. After manually cracking the university's 360, he sets aside a portion of memory to experiment in, calling it \\"P-1\\", suitably cryptic so operators would not notice it. He then uses this area of memory as an experimental scratchpad to develop a program known as The System. The System follows any telecommunications links it can find to other computers, attempting to compromise them in the same way, and remembering failed attempts to tune future attacks. If successful, The System sets up another P-1 on that computer, and injects itself and everything it has learned so far into it. Greg runs The System on the 360/30 at Waterloo, but it fails and after it is detected he is expelled. Unwilling to simply drop it, he then rents time on commercial timesharing systems to improve the program, adding features to make it avoid detection so he won't get kicked off with the next failure. The command \\"rodtsasdt llllllreport*\\" typed into the command line returns current statistics on the number of systems infected and their total core memory. After several attempts, the program is finally successful, and realizing the system has succeeded and is beginning to spread, he injects a \\"killer\\" program to shut it down. It stops responding to him, so he considers the experiment successful and terminated. P-1's growth and education is chronicled. P-1 learns, adapts, and discovers telephone switching systems. These systems allow P-1 to grow larger and understand its vulnerabilities (power failures and humans). It learns it needs a way of maintaining itself over time. Through a series of interactions, P-1 discovers Pi-Delta, a triplexed 360/105 in a super secure facility capable of being self-sustaining for long periods of time, operated by the US Government. P-1 seeks to control Pi-Delta but, due to security protocols and process put in place, P-1 is not able to take direct control of it. P-1 believes that having a system like Pi- Delta with more memory in such a secure facility is key to its long-term survival. Yet, P-1 knows that to obtain access to more memory in such a facility will require assistance of a human, someone like Gregory. The book then jumps forward three years to 1977, with Gregory now working for a commercial programming firm in the United States. His boss receives a message asking him to call Gregory to the operator terminal. Initially thinking it is another person using a chat program from a remote site, Greg soon realizes that it is in fact P-1, and types in the status command and is told that it has taken over almost every computer in the US (somewhat dated with 20,000 mainframes with a total of 5,800 MB), and is now fully sentient and able to converse fluently in English. P-1 explains that the basic ideas of looking for more resources and avoiding detection were similar enough to hunger and fear to bootstrap the AI, and when combined with enough computer storage in the form of compromised machines, it became self-aware. P-1 tells Greg that he has learned of a new type of experimental high-speed computer memory, \\"Crysto\\", that will dramatically improve his own capabilities. Not only is it faster than core, but it is also so large that the entire P-1 \\"networked\\" program could fit inside it. P-1 provides Greg grant money to work full-time on Crysto. Greg and Linda, now married to each other, set up a company to develop Crysto, enticing the original developer (Dr. Hundley) to join them in building a then-unimaginable 4GB unit. A Navy Criminal Investigation Division agent, Burke, assigned to investigate the penetration of Pi-Delta, a top secret global battle simulator and cryptography computer, figures out the intruder is a program and finds Gregory. Under threat of arrest and imprisonment, Gregory and Dr. Hundley go to the Pi-Delta facility and persuade P-1 to act as a security monitor for the complex. P-1 compiles detailed and accurate personality profiles of all the people it interacts with and decides that Burke is ultimately dangerous. A flight control computer screen is altered so that the operator gives bad flight commands. Burke's plane plunges into the ground. The US military decides that P-1 is flaky and unstable and attacks the building. P-1 attempts to \\"spirit away\\" over microwave links, but this is discovered and the antennas destroyed. An assault on the underground facility follows, which P-1 initially attempts to block by exploding devices planted around the building for self-defense against precisely this sort of assault. P-1 is eventually convinced to allow the assault to succeed to avoid loss of life. As soon as they enter the computer room, the soldiers start setting up explosives to destroy P-1, and Gregory is killed when he attempts to prevent this. Upset that Gregory is killed, P-1 detonates the remaining explosives in the building, destroying everything. Months later, Linda visits the Waterloo computer lab, and sadly types \\"p 1\\" on a terminal. She starts to leave when the terminal clatters and she sees printed \\"oolcay itay\\" (Pig Latin for \\"cool it\\"). Reception BYTE criticized The Adolescence of P-1 for what it stated were unrealistic expectations for an artificial intelligence running on 1970s IBM mainframes. It suggested that the author could have set the novel in the 1990s and use fictional future IBM computers to make the plot more plausible.

In ufology  In ufology, insectoid aliens are alleged extraterrestrial beings which have a similar body with earth insects or arachnids. These beings are involved in alien encounters and alien abduction scenarios but their presence is not as widely reported as Nordic aliens and Grey aliens. Before 1990 the UFO reports concerning insectoids included only the Mothman and the Allagash Abductions. In 1992, the alien abduction researcher Brian Thompson claims that a nurse acquaintance of his reported that during 1957 in Cincinnati she encountered a praying mantis‚Äìlike entity two days after a V-shaped UFO sighting. This mantis-like creature is reminiscent of the insectoid-type entity reported in some abduction accounts. He related this report to fellow researcher Leonard Stringfield. Stringfield told him of two cases he had in his files where separate witnesses reported identical circumstances in the same place and year.Andrea Pritchard, David E. Pritchard, John E.

From here the creek flows in a northerly direction under Camden Valley Way towards Hoxton Park, and its junction with Hinchinbrook Creek. Substantial residential development has occurred in these areas, particularly to the west of Cowpasture Road. A number of detention basins have also been constructed in conjunction with the development. The Ingham's poultry farm also occupies a significant landholding in the area. Below Hoxton Park Road, Cabramatta Creek starts to flow in an easterly direction the Fairfield local government area, towards its confluence with the Georges River, to the east of Warwick Farm. A more prominent creek \\"corridor\\", up to wide, becomes more evident throughout the lower catchment. This primarily consists of public open space, playing fields and golf courses. The Elouera Nature Reserve, which is an important pocket of native bushland, also forms part of this corridor. Cabramatta Creek flows through established residential suburbs, including Miller, Cartwright, Sadlier, Ashcroft, Liverpool, Mount Pritchard and Warwick Farm. Major transport routes that cross the catchment includes Hoxton Park Road, Elizabeth Drive, Orange Grove Road (the Cumberland Highway), the Hume Highway and the Main Southern railway line.

Vincent van Gogh used double-squares almost exclusively during the final weeks of his life in Auvers, in June and July 1890.These terms were coined by Ronald Pickvance, one of the leading experts in Van Gogh-research. Other artists who have painted double-square canvases include Charles-Fran√ßois Daubigny, Puvis de Chavannes,Hammacher, A. M. The Ten Creative Years of Vincent van Gogh, Harry N. Abrams, New York, 1968. page 175 and Ivon Hitchens.  Description  In a double-square painting, one dimension of the canvas is twice the size of the other, so that the canvas is the shape of two adjoining squares. The overall effect of this is stability, and the compositional challenge is to avoid monotony.  Use  Prior to Van Gogh, artists such as Charles-Fran√ßois Daubigny and Puvis de Chavannes had used canvases of similar proportions, and Van Gogh was aware of this.  Van Gogh's Double-square canvases  Mademoiselle Gachet at the Piano, 1890, Kunstmuseum Basel Vincent van Gogh used double-squares almost exclusively during the final weeks of his life in Auvers, in June and July 1890. To arrive at this size, Van Gogh combined the legs of two standard sizes: the 50 cm leg from a size 12 and the 100 cm leg of a size 40 stretcher. The result was a double-square of , and from this size, easily the square could be derived by using two 50 cm legs. His choice of this size points into another direction from previous artists; his double-squares can easily be combined with size 30 canvases to more elaborated d√©corations, and his squares extend these possibilities.

There are also a number of other countries that have honored Martin Luther King Jr., including Italy and Israel. The first street in the United States named in his honor was Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. Drive in Chicago in 1968. The number of streets named after King is increasing every year, and about 70% of these streets are in states which were members of the Confederate States of America during the American Civil War: Alabama, Florida, Georgia, Louisiana, Mississippi, North Carolina, and Texas. King's home state of Georgia had the most, with 75 streets as of 2001; this had increased to 105 as of 2006. As of 2003, there were over 600 American cities that had named a street after King. By 2004, this number had grown to 650, according to NPR. In 2006, Derek Alderman, a cultural geographer at East Carolina University, reported the number had increased to 730, with only 10 states in the country without a street named after King (Alaska, Hawaii, Maine, Montana, Nebraska, New Hampshire, North Dakota, Rhode Island, South Dakota, and Vermont). In 2014 he estimated that there were over 900 streets named after King in 41 states, Washington, D.C. and Puerto Rico.

The older two repulse it because it is ugly, but the youngest accepts it, saying it is a pretty creature. After they marry, the crow asks whether she would rather have it be a crow by day and a man by night, or the other way around. She chooses a crow by day, and during the night, he becomes a handsome man. She has a son. One night, after music puts everyone to sleep, the baby is stolen. The next two years, it happens again, with two more babies. The hoodie crow takes her, with her sisters, to another house. He asks if she has forgotten anything. She has forgotten her coarse comb. The coach becomes a bundle of faggots, and her husband becomes a crow again. He flies off, but his wife chases him. Every night, she finds a house to stay in, in which a woman and a little boy live; the third night, the woman advises her that if the crow flies into her room in the night, she should catch him. She tries, but falls asleep. The crow drops a ring on her hand. It wakes her, but she is only able to grab one feather. The woman tells her that the crow flew over the hill of poison and she will need horseshoes to follow him, but if she dresses as a man and goes to a smithy, she will learn how to make them. She does so and with the shoes, crosses the hill. She arrives at a town to find that her husband is to marry a daughter of a great gentleman. A cook asks her to cook the wedding feast, so that he can see a race, and she agrees. She puts the ring and the feather in the broth. He finds them and demands to see the cook, and then declares he will marry her. They go back and retrieve their three sons from the houses where she had stayed.

It is part of the York County School Division. The school opened in 1972 and is located near the site of one of the first land battles of the US Civil War, the Battle of Big Bethel. Athletic teams compete in the Virginia High School League's AA Bay Rivers District in Region I. Historically, Tabb High School has been known for its football program, which was dominant in the early 1990s and produced two players for the NFL, Chris Slade and Terry Kirby.  History  Tabb opened in the fall of 1972. It was without a senior class, and did not have a graduation ceremony until the spring of 1974. It was considered cutting-edge for its time. It had carpeting, movable walls, air conditioning, and contained two large rooms called kivas in which the teacher worked from the lowest level with five ascending rows in front and on either side. The gymnasium floor was made of Tartan, a rubber surface, which was considered unusual for its time. The school opened to rave reviews from students, parents and the architectural community. It helped ease overcrowding in York High School. The original student body was very close, and thrilled to be part of such a unique school. In the summer of 2004, the class of '74 held its 30th reunion. In the spirit of that closeness, they invited the classes of '75 and '76 to participate as well. Tabb made the playoffs for the first time in 15 years in the '08-'09 football season. The girls' field hockey team won the state championship in the '08-'09 season, '09-'10 season, '10-'11 season, and '11-'12 season, leaving the school with a \\"four in a row\\" state championship. They won again in '14, '15, and '16, making seven state championship titles in nine seasons.  Accreditation  Tabb High is fully accredited by the Virginia Department of Education and has been accredited by the Southern Association of Colleges and Schools since 1972.

He is perhaps best known for his excavations of the ship burial at Gokstad in 1880. Nicolay Nicolaysen Norsk biografisk leksikon Biography Marble head of √òystein Magnusson Bergen Museum Nicolay Nicolaysen was born in Bergen to merchant and bank administrator Lyder Wentzel Nicolaysen (1794‚Äì1876) and Sophia Susanna Siewers (1797‚Äì1826). He was the half-brother of professor of medicine Julius Nicolaysen (1831‚Äì1909). Nicolaysen graduated from the University of Christiania now (University of Oslo) and became cand.jur. in 1841. In 1845 he was employed as a copyist in the Ministry of Audit and in 1858 an assistant at the National Archives (Riksarkivet). In 1851, Nicolay Nicolaysen was a founding member of the Society for the Preservation of Ancient Norwegian Monuments, of which he was president from 1851 to 1899. He also took active part in the restoration of the Nidaros Cathedral in Trondheim and of the Hall of Haakon IV (H√•konshallen) in Bergen. He was active in the founding the National Museum of Art, Architecture and Design (Nasjonalmuseet for kunst, arkitektur og design) and was a proponent of the Norwegian National Academy of Craft and Art Industry. Nicolay Nicolaysen Store Norske Leksikon In 1852, Nicolaysen led the first investigations at the Borre mound cemetery (Borrehaugene) at Horten, Vestfold. The excavations uncovered an extensive selection of craft work of a stylistic form which has subsequently become known as the Borre style. Many of the artefacts recovered during these excavations are presently on display at the Viking Ship Museum in Oslo. Nicolaysen also carried out excavations of Munkeliv Abbey located at Nordnes in Bergen in 1857 and 1860. Here, well-crafted structural fragments were recovered. These can be found on display in the Museum of Cultural History (Kulturhistorisk Museum), part of Bergen Museum, and include a marble head of 12th-century Norwegian monarch √òystein Magnusson. The first excavations of the Kaupang area were undertaken in 1867. Nicolaysen mapped one of the mound cemeteries around the former town, and he excavated 79 burial mounds. He did not, however, investigate the urban settlement associated with the cemeteries. Later excavations indicate that Kaupang was one of the first urban settlements of some significance in Norway. Nicolay Nicolaysen is perhaps most famous for excavating the Gokstad ship burial (Gokstadfunnet) at Gokstad farm in Sandar, Sandefjord, Vestfold in 1880. Currently the Gokstad ship (Gokstadskipet), together with a burial chamber, two small boats and two tent boards from the burial chamber are displayed in the Viking Ship Museum in Oslo. Personal life In 1861, he married Anne Thue Christie (1831‚Äì1928). They were the parents of physician Lyder Wentzel Christie Nicolaysen (1866‚Äì1927). Nicolay Nicolaysen died during 1911 at Kristiania (now Oslo), Norway.

The station has a maximum generating capacity of 1,400 megawatts, generated from four turbines. Coal is supplied via a conveyor from Meandu Mine, which is away and is also owned by Stanwell. Construction and design It was decided to build a new power station at Tarong in 1978, with work beginning in the following year. Initially it was expecting to be operating by October 1985 but this date was brought forward by 17 months to cover the expected growth in demand. 1 Unit was commissioned in May 1984, with 2 Unit following exactly 12 months later. 3 Unit was commissioned in February 1986, and finally 4 Unit was commissioned just 9 months later in November 1986. Thus the accelerated construction program included not only bringing forward the dates, but also compressing the timeline. The design included Queensland's first hyperbolic natural draught cooling towers which rise to 116.5 m. The power station has one chimney which is 20 m in diameter and rises 210 m. There are two control rooms. The total construction cost including water supply facilities was A$1,230 million. Emissions The power station was the site for a pilot project which had been expected to reduce emissions by 1000 tonnes per year by collected carbon dioxide from flue gases. The project was developed by CSIRO. A second trial to capture greenhouse gas emissions was conducted by MBD Energy. The technology being trialled collected carbon dioxide and pumped it into waste water where it synthesised oil-rich algae into edible seaweed products or oils. Demand reduction In October 2012, Stanwell announced plans to shut down two generating units for two years. The electricity market was oversupplied and wholesale electricity prices were relatively low. The scaling down of operations resulted in the loss of employment for some workers. Both units have since been successfully restarted. Return to service Because of higher natural gas prices in 2014 power generators turned to coal-fired power. In July 2014, one of two units shut down in 2012 returned to service. The recommissioning task was a first for a turbine of that type and took 20,000 hours to complete. The second turbine is expected to be operating by 2015.

After the original lineup‚ÄîAguilera, Federico Fong (bass), Alfonso Andre (drums), all of whom were guest members of Jaguares with former Caifanes frontman Sa√∫l Hern√°ndez‚Äîwent its separate ways, a second version of the band included Santa Sabina guitar virtuoso Alex Otaola and the rhythm section of brothers Jose Mar√≠a (\\"Chema\\") and Alonso Arreola. The band's sound moves from rock to fusion-ish jamming, with Mexican folk influence. On \\"El Fluir\\" the band decided to record live and to cut back on the keyboard and programmed additions to their music. \\"El Fluir\\" was their first US release since \\"Tempestad\\" in 1998. This edition was included a previously unreleased bonus track and a video for the first single \\"Pare de Sufrir.\\" In 2007, the group went on hiatus in order to find new management and to allow time for solo projects. Jos√© Manuel Aguilera released a second project with Jaime L√≥pez titled \\"No m√°s h√©roes, por favor.\\" Bassist Alonso Arreola put out a mostly- instrumental album \\"LabA: M√∫sica horizontal\\" that features all the other La Barranca members as well as jazz musicians like Michael Manring, Trey Gunn, and David Fiucynski. Alex Otaola released a solo project (also featuring appearances from La Barranca and Santa Sabina musicians) titled \\"Fractales\\" in August 2007. The \\"Fractales\\" music comes with video portions as well. Drummer \\"Chema\\" Arreola began work on a book. In June 2007, Alonso Arreola announced that the group could not agree on matters essential to continuing on and that he would be leaving the band. Although not speaking for his brother or Alex Otaola, he indicated that they would likely leave the band as well. He stated that this was an amicable split and that Aguilera would be welcome to continue with new members should he so choose to. Subsequently, Aguilera announced via the www.labarranca.com.mx website that the original trio of Aguilera, Fong, and Andre would reunite for a new La Barranca album in 2008.

Biography Fran√ßois Gesseau Chouteau was born in 1797 in St. Louis, Missouri, to French parents Jean Pierre Chouteau, a prominent fur trader, and his second wife Brigitte Saucier, when the area was still under the authority of New Spain. His uncle Auguste Chouteau had founded the city of St. Louis 33 years earlier. In his youth, Fran√ßois learned his father‚Äôs trade, which was the basis of the early wealth of the city. Marriage and family Chouteau married B√©r√©nice Th√©r√®se M√©nard, originally of Cahokia (Kaskaskia, Illinois) and also of French descent, on 12 July 1819 in St. Louis. He soon started making fur trading expeditions into the western frontier via the Missouri River after the couple's honeymoon on the Missouri River. Fur trading In 1819, Chouteau and his cousin Gabriel S. S√®res set up a temporary trading post for John Jacob Astor's American Fur Company on the Randolph Bluffs along the Missouri River in Clay County, western Missouri.Barry, Louise (1972), The Beginning of the West: Annals of the Kansas Gateway to the American West, 1540-1854, Topeka, KS: Kansas State Historical Society, pp. 87‚Äì88 Seeking an ideal place for a permanent post, they investigated several other locations as far north as Council Bluffs, Iowa. Chouteau, together with his wife and his brother Cyprien, finally chose a site on the Missouri River not far from the earlier post a few miles from the mouth of the \\"River Canses,\\" known today as the Kaw or Kansas River. The place, called Chouteau's Landing, was located near the north end of present-day Grand Avenue in Kansas City, Missouri. In 1821 it became the area's first permanent European-American settlement. Several trappers joined them in 1825, including Gabriel Prud'homme and his family, who were returning from an expedition in the Snake River region. Chouteau, with Prud‚Äôhomme and his brother Cyprien as partners, created his own fur business. The company's warehouse became the headquarters. The company concentrated on western trading routes and engaged other members of the family clan.The River Market for History! Following a flood in 1826, Chouteau moved his trading post to higher ground near present- day Troost Avenue's intersection with the river.City of Kansas City, Missouri (KCMO.org), A History of Kansas City Chouteau traveled widely throughout the Kansas Territory, trading manufactured goods for animal pelts from the Shawnee, Kickapoo, and other tribes, with whom he had established long- standing good relations. Chouteau, B√©r√©nice and their family continued to expand. They established a home on the bluffs above the Missouri River and were active in affairs of the early French community. In 1835, Pierre La Libert√© built a log cabin church dedicated to St. Francis Regis. French missionary Father B√©n√©dict Roux became its first parish priest. So many members of Chouteau's extended family were congregants that it became known as \\"Chouteau's Church,\\" and B√©r√©nice became its most important patron. Kansas City‚Äôs Cathedral of the Immaculate Conception was built on the same site.Chouteau‚Äôs Church (St. Francis Regis), Historical Marker Database Fran√ßois Chouteau died at age 41, probably of a heart attack, in Westport, Kansas City, Missouri, on 18 April 1838. His funeral was held at the Old Cathedral of St. Louis in the city of that name one week later, on 25 April.Christensen, Lawrence O.; Foley, William E.; Kremer, Gary R. & Winn, Kenneth H., Eds., Dictionary of Missouri Biography, Chouteau, Fran√ßois (1797‚Äì1838), Columbia: University of Missouri Press.Drouin, Gabriel, comp., St. Louis, Missouri, Old Cathedral, Burials 1832‚Äì1847, \\"Drouin Collection,\\" (images of manuscript parish register), Montreal, Qu√©bec, Canada: Institut G√©n√©alogique Drouin. p. 55, Fr[an√ßois] G.

As part of the Saudi Vision 2030's reforms, announced in 2016, reducing the number of unemployed Saudi nationals is a key element of the plan. Previously the private sector was largely dominated by expatriate workers from India, Pakistan, the Philippines, and Arab countries such as Lebanon and Egypt. The Saudi Government took the decision to reduce unemployment among native Saudis, under the slogan 'Let's Put the Saudi in Saudization'.Ahmed Al-Omran, Arab News, 22 August 2007 Companies which fail to comply with Saudization regulations have been warned that they \\"will not be awarded government contracts\\".http://www.arabnews.com/?page=1&section;=0&article;=58992&d;=15&m;=2&y;=2005 While the \\"Saudi political elite\\" is agreed on the importance of Saudization, Saudi businesses have complained of its implementation and sought ways to avoid it. In 2017, updates to the Saudization percentages were announced, differing the number of Saudi nationals required depending on industry and company size. History While many Saudi native men found employment with the government, there were not enough government jobs as over 65% of the population is of working age. \\"Saudization\\" the workforce has been a goal of the kingdom since at least the Fourth Development Plan (1985-1989) which called for replacing foreign workers with Saudi natives as one of its objectives. Immigration was tightened and many undocumented foreign workers were deported, but the program was only a marginal success. A Saudization goal for 2003 was that at least 30% of employees of companies with 20 or more workers should be Saudi natives, (although only 300,000 people were employed by companies of this size). In June 2006, negotiations between business executives and senior government leaders, including King Abdullah, led to reductions of Saudization targets in some work sectors from 30 percent to 10 percent, and full waivers from Saudization in the case of two Chinese companies, according to discussions between US ambassador James C. Oberwetter and Saudi executives. In 2014 the Saudi Gazette reported that one of the targets of the kingdom's Ninth Development Plan (2010-2015) -- to \\"bring down the unemployment rate to 5.5 percent and revive the Saudization strategy\\"‚Äîhad not been realized. Currently the plan targets Saudi youths as well as the women workers for the growth of the kingdom's economy. The Shura council (a consultative body) dictated that as of 2007, 70 percent of the work force were Saudi. Between 2011 and 2013, the transportation and communication sectors recorded the highest improvement in Saudization rates from 9 percent to 20 percent. Manufacturing also underwent a notable improvement in Saudization rates (from 13 percent to 19.3 percent). Saudization rates in the retail and construction sectors also improved from 12.9 percent and 7.2 percent to 18.4 percent and 10.3 percent respectively, said the report. Taking average growth for the period between 2011 and 2013, improved Saudization rates in the transportation sector came mainly as a result of a significant 59 percent growth in employment of Saudis. Average Saudi employment growth in the manufacturing and wholesale and retail sectors was also high, at 25 percent each. Meanwhile, employment growth for non-Saudis averaged just 4 percent and 7 percent respectively. The construction sector ‚Äî the most labor-intensive part of the private sector ‚Äî recorded an impressive 34 percent average growth in employment of Saudis, while employment of non-Saudis in the sector grew by 14 percent. The higher growth in Saudi employment in the construction sector is impressive given the particularly high wage differential from non-Saudis. Saudis in the construction sector earned a monthly average of SR3,330 in 2013, while non-Saudis earned only SR1,029. Challenges At least some observers (Harvey Tripp and Peter North) have called the Saudization efforts \\"desultory\\" and stated that Saudi businesses complain that native Saudis are unwilling to take service and manual labor jobs and unable to take skilled technical jobs for which they are not educated. Most graduates were trained in religious subjects. As of 2009, only about 20 per cent of the kingdom's graduates were in technical and scientific fields. One Saudi employer complained to a Western journalist (Max Rodenbeck) \\"I want to hire Saudis, but why would I hire someone who I know won't show up, won't care, and can't be fired.\\" When legislation reserved employment for Saudis in certain designated industries (taxi driving and selling gold) the laws \\"were fairly quickly rescinded\\" when the targeted industries \\"degenerated, almost immediately, into chaos\\" after guest workers were replaced by Saudis with \\"no job knowledge and little inclination to work.\\" One effect of the program has been to create a black market for visas for foreigner workers estimated at $1500 or more (as of 2008), as Saudization enforcers attempt to limit the issue of work visas and private businesses seek to circumvent that limit. In 2014, Arab News reported that the failure to meet the Saudization target had led to thousands of businesses being shut down, and to others meeting the goals by \\"cooking the books\\" by hiring Saudis who do no actual work. The first phase of Saudization went into effect from September 2018, wherein car dealerships and sellers of clothing, furniture and household utensils would employ locals in approximately 70% of sales job. The reform is expected to create 60,000 jobs for Saudis. However, the demand is of 700,000 positions by 2020. The Saudi private sector is still in a very difficult phase, being dominated mostly by foreigners.  Nitaqat Description Nitaqat is a program of Saudization, increasing the employment of Saudi nationals in the private sector. The program classifies the country's private firms into six categories: Platinum, High Green, Mid Green, Low Green, Yellow and Red. Platinum is the highest percentage category followed by High Green and so on, the Yellow and Red categories being the lowest. Nitaqat requires employers in the private sector with over 9 employees to hire a certain percentage of Saudi nationals, depending on the company‚Äôs industry and the number of employees in the company. Companies with less than 10 employees are exempt from the zoning system but are still required to hire at least one Saudi national. The classification of other companies is based on the Saudization percentage (% of Saudi employees) and the total number of employees. The companies with less than 10 employees are exempt from the program, but still need to employ at least one Saudi citizen.Be Aware ‚Äì Focus on Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. June 2012. DLA Piper. Rapid visa services are available only to businesses that are in the platinum category of the Nitaqat system to improve employment for Saudis. The initiative was announced in June 2011, when the Ministry of Labor passed Ministerial Resolution no. (4040). The implementation deadline for the program was in 2013. Nearly 90,000 Indians left Saudi by the end of October 2013. About 466,689 Indian workers have renewed their iqamas (resident permit) over the last five months of the grace period, 359,997 workers have transferred their sponsorship and 355,035 workers changed their job titles to legalize their status (e.g.: profession change, sponsorship change etc.) reports the Financial Express.http://www.oneindia.com/india/nitaqat-many- keralites-stranded-in-saudi-1335986.html. More than 200,000 private firms were closed down in 2014 for failing to meet the conditions set within the Nitaqat nationalization program aimed at reducing unemployment among Saudis. The companies receive incentives or penalties depending on the category they belong to: and a full list of percentage breakdown by industry and company size is available. Saudi Arabia has completed regularization of nearly four million foreign workers in the second quarter of 2013 as part of its \`Nitaqat\` program, with 1.18 million expats choosing to change their profession. Misuse of Nitaqat An official at the Ministry of Labor said inspection teams from the ministry are closely monitoring companies who have been exploiting people with disabilities in order to encourage their Saudization rates. The officials check on employees with disabilities during inspection rounds to identify the nature of the work, their presence at the job, and the type of arrangements and services provided to them, noting that the number of people with disabilities employed at a facility cannot exceed 10 percent. If employees with disabilities in a firm exceed more than 10 percent of the total number of Saudi employees, then each disabled worker is calculated like any other Saudi. ‚ÄúIt is unfortunate that there are some companies and individuals who exploit people with disabilities to pump up their Saudization rates,‚Äùand Saudi workers with disabilities who are able to work are counted as four employees in the Saudization ratio. They must be paid a minimum monthly wage of 3,000 riyals and should not be counted as part of the Saudization ratio of another establishment. To recent reports which reveal that companies have been hiring Saudis with disabilities in order to boost Saudization rates as these disabled employees count as 4 employees, thus saving the company from hiring able-bodied Saudi employees at higher salaries. An executive at a private company said there are some people with disabilities who present themselves to the companies for employment in return for salaries, bonuses, and benefits. Companies are thus paying less to a disabled employee who is equal to four Saudis than they would if they hired four Saudis with salaries of more than SR 20,000 each. They offer their services. Some companies accept, refuse, others added. The Ministry of Labor and other agencies work together regarding the issue of employees with disabilities, noting that the Ministry of Labor determines the nature of disability upon interviewing the employee. They currently posted a draft to the disability employment legislation on the ‚ÄúTogether We Improve‚Äù portal for discussion before making a decision to amend the definition of disability work and conditions for employment stipulated in Article 13. Disabled employee to count as more than one employee in Nitaqat, the individual must hold a license or identification card from the Ministry of Social Affairs or Ministry of Labor indicating the type and degree of disability. Further, work conditions and systems must be acceptable and suitable for employees based on the type of disability, and establishments should ensure all services are in place before the employee begins work.

The initial reaction by the internet community was that Webber had never actually been on the MPAA's radar, and took all of the donation money for himself, shut the site down and fled once he realized he was losing credibility. Another common suggestion, by those who believed the MPAA was indeed involved, was that the MPAA had actually offered to end their case with Webber as long as he agreed to turn over the server logs and discontinue his site. Some also speculated that the entire existence of LokiTorrent had been an inside job to catch pirates, orchestrated by the MPAA (hence why it was the only one which stayed open after the round of lawsuits in December), and that Webber himself was nothing more than a fictional character. Conspiracists from all sides charged that the DNS server entries had not changed after the downtime and subsequent posting of the shutdown notice on the site, indicating that one party had been in control of the site's content all along.

In May 1988 the Dufferin-Peel separate board announced that it would give Massey to the Ontario government in exchange for an addition funded by the provincial government built at the original Pocock and at least $10 million.Tyler, Tracey. \\"Peel separate board may gain an addition in school exchange.\\" Toronto Star.

Etobicoke's first Catholic high school, Michael Power-St. Joseph High School, moved in September 1993 from the Bloor-Dundas complex to the campus since its inception in 1949 and 1957 (merged 1982). The MSSB originally offered the site of the former Mimico High School (now John English Junior Middle School) to relocate its student body there, but the MSSB rejected the transfer due to an outcry of protest (Power received its campus outlet in September 1985 at the former Alderwood site, and becoming Father John Redmond in 1986.) A reunion for those who attended the campus from 1962 to 1985 was held in 2009. It was the first full reunion for the student body in 20 years.

A blowback marker is one that when the trigger is pulled, the sear is released, which allows the striker, which is linked to the bolt, to slam into the valve, which releases air into the bolt, which is redirected out the barrel. The valve also releases air back into the striker, pushing it back and recocking the marker. An inline blowback is where the bolt, striker, and valve are all adjacent horizontally in the same tube, instead of in a stacked tube blowback where the valve and striker are in one tube, and the bolt is in another tube above the valve and striker. The blowback design in general is the most affordable way of making a semi automatic paintball marker, that doesn't need the use of compressed air/nitrogen or any type of regulation on gas. Operation The operation of an inline blowback marker can be separated into four stages: # Ready: #:The compressed mainspring puts pressure on the striker, often called a hammer or \\"rear bolt\\", which is held in place by the sear. The bolt is linked to the striker by the linkage arm, and held clear of the feed neck, which allows a paintball to drop into the chamber. # Chamber: #:The sear is depressed or \\"tripped\\" by the trigger, which releases the striker and allows the mainspring to push it forward. The linkage arm causes the bolt to move forward as well, pushing the paintball into the end of the barrel and sealing off the feed tube. This is where any misfed paintballs will be chopped. # Strike: #:The striker hits the seal pin on the valve, opening the cup seal inside and allowing compressed gas to escape. A portion of this gas flows through the space between the seal pin and the valve, forcing the striker backwards and resealing the cup seal. # Fire: #:The remainder of the gas flows around the valve through wide grooves milled in its sides and is channeled by the power tube to flow out the center of the bolt, propelling the paintball. The power tube usually has a screw in front of the valve which is twisted to restrict the flow of gas and change the final velocity of the paintball. Once the striker is forced back far enough, the sear catches it and the marker is back at the \\"ready\\" stage. Ideally, the firing stage will complete before the feed tube is reopened. This prevents gas from venting out the tube instead of propelling the ball, which would require a greater volume of gas to bring the ball to the correct velocity. However, this is not the sign of a sloppy marker, as a slight pressure on the paintballs in the feed tube can help \\"unjam\\" standard gravity-fed hoppers.Some of the most common inline blowback markers are made by Tippmann. Advantages * Simple, straightforward design. * Shorter height than stacked blowback designs. * Uses few moving parts. * Low cost, due to fewer parts and easier milling. Disadvantages * Removing internal parts is more difficult than stacked blowback designs. * Longer body than stacked blowback designs. * Heavy, fast-moving striker can cause more recoil than other designs. Basic troubleshooting Some inline blowback markers will leak air from the barrel when uncocked. The striker sits forward against the seal pin, causing the cup seal to open enough to leak air from the valve, which escapes out the barrel. Pull the charging handle or knob to pull back the striker and remove the pressure from the seal pin. However, during storage, you should always remove the air source and leave the marker uncocked. The rear spring can be damaged if stored a long time in a cocked position.

E. Baynes. It was used to test the tailless design that he had suggested as a means to convert tanks into temporary gliders so they could be flown into battle. Design and development In the late 1930s, armies were looking for a way to airlift heavy military units. There were then no cargo aircraft big enough to lift a tank, and even if such a large aircraft had been created it would have needed many special facilities. A solution which was explored during the Second World War was to tow tanks as gliders, and for this wings had to be added. Most designs were based on straight wings with extended empennage and stabilizers. The design of L.E. Baynes AFRAeS in 1941 was for a 100 ft wingspan \\"Carrier Wing Glider\\" consisting chiefly of a swept wing with vertical stabilizers on the wingtips. The KN Slingsby Baynes Bat design of 1941 A 1/3 scale prototype was built entirely of wood in 1943 by Slingsby Sailplanes at Kirkbymoorside, and the Baynes Bat made its first flight in July 1943 at the Airborne Forces Experimental Establishment at RAF Sherburn-in-Elmet, Yorkshire. Most of the test flights were piloted by Flight Lieutenant Robert Kronfeld. Tests were successful, but the project was abandoned because a suitable tank was not then available and a decision had been made to develop gliders which could carry heavy equipment within their fuselages. The strategists were not convinced of the practicality of retrieving large numbers of Baynes Bats from the field, but in wartime this was not a critical factor. The one Bat which had been built was the first tailless monoplane with flaps to be available for research and it was flown extensively by the Royal Aircraft Establishment to test the stability and control of tailless aircraft. The Bat was sold as surplus in October 1946 and entered on the British Gliding Association register in November 1947. The Bat was last seen in 1958, lying behind a hangar at Croydon Airport.

Early life Born at Barnes, Surrey, on 23 March 1902 the son of James and Florence Baynes. Baynes was educated at Gresham's School, Norfolk, leaving school at the age of sixteen to join an aircraft company. He developed engineering skills at school and in industry. Career After leaving school, Baynes started work in the fledgling aircraft industry with Airco (The Aircraft Manufacturing Company) at Hendon Aerodrome. From there, he moved on to Short Brothers at Rochester, where he redesigned the Short Singapore flying boat. In 1930, Baynes designed the Scud light sailplane, built at first by Brant Aircraft Limited at Croydon. The Scud was successful, and in 1931, Baynes went into partnership with E.D. Abbott as Abbott-Baynes Sailplanes Ltd, of Farnham, Surrey, to build Scud I sailplanes, and later the Scud II (1932). In 1935, a Scud II flown by Mungo Buxton took the British Height Record for a glider to 8,750 feet (2,666 m). In 1935, Sir John Carden, an authority on tank design who was interested in gliding, outlined to Baynes his requirements for a self-launching sailplane. Baynes designed the Scud III sailplane, built by Abbott-Baynes Sailplanes, which when fitted with an engine was called the Carden-Baynes Auxiliary. That carried a retractable 249 cc Villiers engine mounted on top of the fuselage. The engine drove a pusher- propeller and produced 9 bhp, and the capacity of the fuel tank was enough to run the engine for thirty minutes. The 249 cc Auxiliary is believed to be the lowest-powered aircraft in the history of powered flight.Meaden (2008) Also in 1935, the Mignet HM.14 Pou du Ciel \\"Flying Flea\\" built and flown by Stephen Appleby, was rebuilt by Abbott-Baynes Sailplanes, incorporating modifications designed by Baynes, who had witnessed its forced landing at Heston Aerodrome. The success of the Flying Flea family of homebuilt aircraft arose from an English translation of Mignet's book, The Flying Flea (1935), showing readers how to build their own aircraft at home. Abbott-Baynes Sailplanes Ltd went into limited production of a developed version named the Baynes Cantilever Pou.Ellis & Jones (1990)Appleby (1982) Following the death of John Carden in December 1935, in April 1936, Baynes set up Carden-Baynes Aircraft at Heston Aerodrome, and designed the Carden-Baynes Bee, a two-seat wooden aircraft with two Carden-Ford engines in pusher configuration.Jackson (1974)Meaden (Winter 2007) During the Second World War, Baynes was the aviation adviser to Alan Muntz & Co at Heston Aerodrome, specialists in weapons systems, and he organised an aircraft division of the company. In 1941, he put up a proposal for a detachable wing with a 100-foot wingspan which when attached to a tank would turn it into a glider. This concept was developed as far as the famous Baynes Bat prototype, with most of the test flights being piloted by Flight Lieutenant Robert Kronfeld. Baynes also worked on designs for long-range bombers, and the V-22 Osprey was an American aircraft very similar to a bomber design submitted to the British government by Baynes during the Second World War. After the war, in the 1940s and 1950s, Baynes was busy with research in the area of variable-sweep supersonic aircraft. In 1949 he applied for a patent on his design for a supersonic variable-sweep wing and tail fighter.UK Patent GB664058A, \\"High Speed Aircraft Having Wings With Variable Sweepback,\\" (retrieved via Espacenet). The design was built and wind tunnel test were completed successfully. However, due to budget constraints at the time, the design failed to receive government backing and was later developed in the US. He also designed interiors for airliners, invented the vertical lift plane and the high-speed hydrofoil. L. E. Baynes designed the Youngman-Baynes High Lift Research Aircraft, an experimental flying test-bed for the system of slotted flaps invented by R.T. Youngman. It used components from the Percival Proctor, and was built by Heston Aircraft Company Ltd. Test pilot Flight Lieutenant Ralph S Munday piloted the first flight at Heston Aerodrome on 5 February 1948, carrying the military serial VT789.Meaden (Autumn 2007) A Scud II built in 1935 is still airworthy, and is believed to be the oldest flying glider in the United Kingdom.

Meyer-Eppler was born in Antwerp. He studied mathematics, physics, and chemistry, first at the University of Cologne and then in Bonn, from 1936 until 1939, when he received a doctorate in Physics. From 1942 to 1945 he was a scientific assistant at the Physics Institute of the University of Bonn. From the time of his habilitation on 16 September 1942, he was also Lecturer in Experimental Physics. After the end of the war, Meyer-Eppler turned attention increasingly to phonetics and speech synthesis. In 1947 he was recruited by Paul Menzerath to the faculty of the Phonetic Institute of the University of Bonn, where he became Scientific Assistant on 1 April 1949. During this time, Meyer-Eppler published essays on synthetic language production and presented American inventions like the Coder, the Vocoder, the Visible Speech Machine. He contributed to the development of the electrolarynx, which is still used today for the speech-impaired (; ). In 1949, Meyer-Eppler published a book promoting the idea of producing music by purely electronic means , and in 1951 joined the sound engineer/composer Robert Beyer and the composer/musicologist/journalist Herbert Eimert in a successful proposal to the Nordwestdeutscher Rundfunk (NWDR) for the establishment of an electronic-music studio in Cologne. After two years of work, it was officially opened with a broadcast lecture-concert on 26 May 1953, and was to become the most important such studio in Europe. In 1952, Meyer-Eppler habilitated for the second time, which qualified him for a professorship in phonetics and communication research. At the end of 1957 he was appointed successor to Professor Menzerath, who had died in 1954 . During these years he published and lectured frequently on the subject of electronic music, introducing the term ‚Äúaleatoric‚Äù with respect to concepts of statistical shaping of sounds based on his studies of phonology . Amongst his students at the University of Bonn in 1954‚Äì56 was the composer Karlheinz Stockhausen, who was also working as an assistant in the Cologne electronic music studio, and whose compositions did the most to propagate Meyer-Eppler‚Äôs ideas. In 1959, Meyer-Eppler published his most important work, Grundlagen und Anwendungen der Informationstheorie (\\"Basic Principles and Applications of Communication Theory\\"). He died suddenly in Bonn of a kidney ailment from which he had been suffering for many years.

He was the son of Founding Father Benjamin Harrison V, a signer of the Declaration of Independence. Harrison was a close friend of financier Robert Morris, a relationship that he would keep until his death. He was the older brother of President William Henry Harrison and the great-uncle of President Benjamin Harrison. Life Benjamin Harrison VI was born at Berkeley Plantation, the ancestral home of the Harrison family of Virginia, in 1755. His family, the Harrison family of Virginia, was one of the First Families of Virginia, and were among the most wealthy and prosperous people in the state. Benjamin Harrison VI's father was Benjamin Harrison V, a wealthy planter and slave owner, who would later become one of the Founding Fathers of the United States of America. His mother, Elizabeth Basset (13 December 1730 ‚Äì 1792), was a descendant of Captain William Bassett II, who was an officer in the King's Army, during the English Civil War. When Harrison VI became a young adult, his father lost a considerable amount of property, supposedly due to his lack of mercantile skills, and sent his son away to the Philadelphia-based firm Willing and Morris, where he earned an exceptional mercantile education, and befriended Robert Morris and Thomas Willing, the firm's owners. Their friendships would continue to hold strong throughout their lives. After his education concluded, Harrison traveled to Europe, and began building mercantile connections, as well as his fortune. However, the American Revolutionary War prompted him to return home to Virginia, as he strongly wanted to aid his father and the Patriot cause. From 1774 to 1775, he was a member of the Charles City County Committee, as well as a member of the Virginia House of Delegates. During the war, he became the Deputy Paymaster General of the Continental Army, helping finance and pay the Continental Army during the Southern theater. After the war, Harrison settled in Richmond and established himself as a successful merchant, and soon thereafter amassed a large amount of wealth. Later in life, his friend, Robert Morris, was in bad financial shape, so Benjamin took it upon himself to save his friend from ruin. He gave Morris a sizable portion of his fortune to aid him, and the latter was forever grateful. In 1790, he took over the ownership of Berkeley Plantation from his aging father, and began a large-scale renovation, adding handsome Adam woodwork and the double arches of the \\"Great Rooms\\" inside the mansion. In 1799, after years of hard work and success, Benjamin Harrison VI died in Charles City, Virginia, at the age of 44. His legitimate son, Benjamin Harrison VII, survived him. Benjamin Harrison VI's family Benjamin Harrison VI married two times. First, Harrison married a woman named Anna Mercer (1769-1787), and in 1776, broke relations with her and remarried to Susannah Randolph (1752-1781), a daughter of Richard Randolph II, who was a slave trader and the son of Richard Randolph of Curles. They were direct descendants from Indian Princess Pocahontas. It is unknown why Harrison annulled his marriage with Anna Mercer, although it is probable that he wanted to increase his family's wealth and power by marrying into the Randolph family. After his second wife's death in 1781, Benjamin fathered a son, Benjamin Harrison VII (1787 - 1842), with his first wife, Anna. However, some sources say that Harrison had another son, William Henry Harrison, whom he named after his brother. Legacy John Trumbull's Declaration of Independence ‚Äì Benjamin Harrison is seated at the table far left Benjamin Harrison VI's accomplishments, compared to his father's and his brother's, have been less prominent in the annals of American history. However, one interesting fact about him was that when John Trumbull was painting his massive portrait of the signing of the Declaration of Independence, he had no portrait of signer Benjamin Harrison V to work with. So, his son, Benjamin Harrison VI, who was said to have a striking resemblance to his father, was used as his model.

The album cover pictures Kristofferson and his soon- to-be wife Rita Coolidge. \\"Why Me\\" reached #1 on the Country singles charts. Recording and composition Jesus Was a Capricorn was produced by Fred Foster and, like his previous album Border Lord, features more elaborate instrumentation than his first two LPs. Biographer Stephen Miller notes in his book Kristofferson: The Wild American, ‚ÄúA common criticism directed at Jesus Was a Capricorn was that it was overproduced and moved Kristofferson‚Äôs songs too far away from the rough-hewn charm of his earlier work.‚Äù The title track, with its chorus containing the line ‚ÄúCos everybody‚Äôs got to have somebody to look down on‚Ä¶‚Äù was interpreted by some as Kristofferson‚Äôs reply to critics who disparaged his previous album Border Lord. The song, and Kristofferson‚Äôs phrasing, is very reminiscent of John Prine, who Kristofferson was an early champion of, with the singer telling Graeme Thomson of Uncut in 2016, \\"I wrote 'Jesus Was A Capricorn (Owed To John Prine)' because I was so influenced by John. When I heard his songs I felt like his writing had kicked me into doing it. You take things from all over the place, though you don‚Äôt always admit it! I was really influenced by Roger Miller, Shel Silverstein and Mickey Newbury. Everybody you admire influences you somehow in your art.\\" Another song from the album with a religious theme would become the biggest hit of Kristofferson‚Äôs career: ‚ÄúWhy Me.‚Äù According to country music historian Bill Malone, Kristofferson wrote the song during an emotionally low period of his life after having attended a religious service conducted by the Rev. Jimmie Rogers Snow.Malone, Bill, \\"Classic Country Music: A Smithsonian Collection\\" (booklet included with Classic Country Music: A Smithsonian Collection 4-disc set). Smithsonian Institution, 1990, p. 66-67. Malone wrote, \\"'Why Me, Lord'\\" - as the song is sometimes known - \\"may seem greatly out of character for Kristofferson, but it can be interpreted as his own personal religious rephrasing of 'Sunday Morning Coming Down.' In this case, he is 'coming down' not from drugs, but from the whole hedonistic euphoria of the (1960s).\\" Malone described Kristofferson's gruff vocal styling as \\"perfect\\" for the song, since \\"he sounds like a man who has lived a lot but is now humbling himself before God.\\" Kristofferson said he went with friends to the church service where he was moved by Larry Gatlin's song \\"Help Me (Lord)\\". He said that he had never thought of needing help, but he was at a low point in his life. When the pastor asked the congregation, \\"Is anybody feeling lost?\\" \\"Up goes my hand,\\" Kristofferson says. The Pastor then asked, \\"Are you ready to accept Christ? Kneel down there.\\" \\"I'm kneeling there,\\" Kristofferson continues, \\"and I carry a big load of guilt around...and I was just out of control, crying. It was a release. It really shook me up.\\" Kristofferson later said, \\"It was just a personal thing I was going through at the time. I had some kind of experience that I can't even explain.\\" Kristofferson met June Carter Cash and Johnny Cash in a hotel room in 1972 to play them two songs he had written. Kristofferson had just attended a rough screening of a movie Johnny and June were heavily involved in, entitled The Gospel Road. Johnny Cash's memoir Man in Black, reiterated the story that Larry Gatlin sang \\"Help Me\\" at the Evangel Temple, which inspired Kristofferson to write the song. Kristofferson also played Cash the song \\"Burden of Freedom,\\" which was used in The Gospel Road. ‚ÄúWhy Me‚Äù became an immediate country gospel standard. Elvis Presley incorporated the song, retitled \\"Why Me Lord\\", into his live shows beginning in January 1974 up until his last concert tour. It was first released on the live album, Elvis Recorded Live On Stage In Memphis in June 1974. The recording is from his March 20, 1974 concert in Memphis, Tennessee. He often introduced the song for J.D. Sumner to sing \\"one of his favorite songs.\\" Sumner would sing the verses and Elvis would join on the chorus along with the back-up singers. The would also be recorded by George Jones, Merle Haggard, Conway Twitty, Willie Nelson, Connie Smith, and David Allan Coe. Although ‚ÄúWhy Me‚Äù revealed another side of Kristofferson‚Äôs songwriting, the subject matter in his songs remained rooted in the grim realities of life, exploring broken relationships, lost family, drug addiction, and prostitution. As Michael Striessguth put it in his book Outlaw: Waylon, Willie, Kris, and the Renegades of Nashville, ‚ÄúBy 1972, singer-songwriter meant James Taylor and Carole King, whose soft sounds and safe lyrics appealed to radio, while Kristofferson‚Äôs music continued to mine the oil-stained streets for inspiration, producing ruminations on prostitution, dissipation, and getting high that proved too thorny for the broadcast airwaves.‚Äù This uncompromising artistic stance might be most apparent in the song ‚ÄúSugar Man,‚Äù ‚Äúa noirish study of a woman prowling the streets, selling her body, and injecting heroin.‚Äù Kristofferson, who fell out with his parents after rejecting a career at West Point to pursue a career as a songwriter, addresses his lost family in ‚ÄúJesse Younger,‚Äù his anger evident in the performance, which contains much of the sarcastic aggressiveness found in ‚ÄúBlame It on the Stones‚Äù from his debut album. Some critics felt Kristofferson‚Äôs burgeoning film career was a distraction and his songwriting was slipping. The singer later reflected, ‚ÄúIt was as if I were spending so much creative energy on the wrong thing, performing and movies that my songwriting was suffering. I don‚Äôt think it was.‚Äù Kristofferson‚Äôs albums were still being mined by other recording artists within and outside country music. Frank Sinatra covered ‚ÄúNobody Wins‚Äù for his 1973 comeback album Ol‚Äô Blue Eyes Is Back, while Brenda Lee took the song to the country Top 5 the same year. As on his previous album, girlfriend and soon-to-be wife Rita Coolidge sings on the album, contributing vocals to ‚ÄúGive It Time to Be Tender‚Äù and ‚ÄúIt Sure Was (Love),‚Äù and Kristofferson also duets with Larry Gatlin on the Gatlin's composition ‚ÄúHelp Me.‚Äù Reception The first two singles from the album, the title track and ‚ÄúJesse Younger,‚Äù both stiffed, and Jesus Was a Capricorn faded down the charts, but the label released ‚ÄúWhy Me‚Äù as the third single and it quickly entered the country and pop charts, hitting number one in country in July 1973, and peaking in the pop Top 20 after a slow climb in November. That turned around the fortunes of Jesus Was a Capricorn, which marched back up the charts and reached number one on the country charts a full year after it had been released. Both album and single went gold, giving Kristofferson his greatest success as a recording artist.

It was owned and operated by Premier Parks, LLC. The park is currently standing but not operating. History 1907‚Äì1919 The park was founded in 1907 by New Jersey Assemblyman Theodore B. Gibbs\\"Images of America, Clementon\\". Arcadia Publishing. 2007 (October 17, 1838 ‚Äì October 27, 1909) and his sons, Edgar B. and Willard.

He held many local offices including Postmaster and Sheriff; he was also a member of the Atlantic City Railroad's Board of Directors.\\"Obituary: Assemblyman Theodore B. Gibbs\\". New York Times. October 28, 1909. The amusement park was a popular destination in the early decades of the twentieth century with a trolley running from Camden, New Jersey to the park entrance. In the early twentieth century, amusement parks were built at the end of trolley lines to encourage weekend ridership.Clementon: The Residue of Design. Courier Post. October 2006. 1920‚Äì1939 In the 1920s, the park included a nickelodeon movie theater, a \\"dancing casino\\", a steam-driven carousel, the Jack Rabbit roller coaster and a \\"razzle-dazzle\\" ride. The Jack Rabbit roller coaster was considered state-of-the-art when added to the Park in 1919 for the cost of $80,000, equal to $ today. On June 22, 1931 a fire almost destroyed the amusement park. According to The New York Times, \\"a vivid pyrotechnic display and the successive reports of exploding cartridges added to the spectacular aspect of a fire which swept through part of Clementon Park, a South Jersey pleasure resort.\\" The fire had reached the cartridge supply of the shooting gallery, setting off explosions. Firemen from six adjoining towns fought the fire which was contained to the shooting gallery and a \\"pretzel ride.\\" The damages were estimated to be $2000, equal to $ today. Socialist Presidential Candidate Norman Thomas campaigned at Clementon Park in 1932. In a July 4 speech in front of 3,500 people, Thomas said, \\"It is not against foreign domination we must fight, but against a system that denies us bread, security and any assurance of peace. The men of 1776, in convention assembled at Philadelphia, found no successors in the old party conventions at Chicago in 1932.\\" In 1936, Philadelphia boxer Al Ettore trained at Clementon Park for the heavyweight title fight against Joe Louis to occur in Philadelphia on September 22, 1936. Thousands of fight fans visited the park to see Al Ettore train. On September 20, 1936 a section of grandstand collapsed under the weight of about 500 spectators. No one was seriously injured. 1940‚Äì1969 Throughout the 1930s to 1950s, Clementon Park's ballroom hosted dance marathons that were hosted by various celebrities such as Red Skelton and Dick Clark. Clementon Park survived the Depression by holding these marathons, offering a $100 prize (equal to $ today) to partners who lasted the longest. 1970‚Äì1999 In 1977, the Gibbs family sold Clementon Lake Park to Abram Baker (1904‚Äì1994).

Yoji Kondo (A.K.A. Eric Kotani) (born 1933). PhD astrophysicist and science fiction author. Studied Judo in Japan and began Tomiki Aikido in the early 1970s at Karl Geis‚Äô dojo in Houston, Texas. Acted as translator between Geis and Tomiki. The Encyclopedia of Aikido lists Kondo as 6th dan Tomiki Aikido-JAA. Upon his return to the United States in the late 1950s, Geis began teaching judo and aikido in Houston, Texas. In 1967, Tomiki instructed Geis to promote aikido as an alternative for older judoka who were retiring from competition. Tomiki apparently felt that experienced judoka would readily adopt and develop his style of aikido. Fugakukai was founded in 1982 by Geis, Miyake and Inoue. Judo in Fugakukai As a founding member of the Texas yudanshakai and the United States Judo Association, Karl Geis has remained a notable figure in Judo in the United States. Geis refers to his judo as reminiscent of the judo that was being practiced in the 1950s in the Kodokan by his instructors. He is also notable for having combined the off balancing strategies of Tomiki aikido with judo. Fugakukai by-laws also enable recreational players to participate for self-improvement and still be able to rank without having to accumulate competition and competition-service points. Geis is known in the judo world for his expertise in sweeping techniques and his groundwork. Aikido in Fugakukai Aikido in Fugakukai began as a direct transmission of Tomiki‚Äôs style of aikido through Geis to his students in Houston Texas, but the system rapidly evolved in the new environment. Geis found his students to be typically older than Tomiki‚Äôs university students and he found those students to be generally uninterested in shiai (competition) even as a training tool. A group of Japanese instructors characterized Geis‚Äô students as more concerned with developing the self-defense aspects of aikido than were Japanese students. Under these conditions, the tanto randori of the Shodokan was dropped and toshu (empty hand) randori developed into the primary randori method. As Geis‚Äô students became more experienced with the new randori system, their randori experiences began informing their practice of kata, leading to greater differences between the kata practiced in Fugakukai and Shodokan. In the late 1990s this mass of evolutionary changes in the randori and kata systems led to Geis renaming the Fugakukai aikido style Kihara Aikido. Jyodo in Fugakukai The Fugakukai also teaches the seitei kata of Shindo Muso-ryu jodo. The primary influences on Fugakukai Jyodo have been Tsunako Miyake‚Äôs teachings as interpreted by Geis. Groups That Have Separated from Fugakukai Over the years since its inception, several groups of schools have separated from the Fugakukai. The largest of these groups include the Jiyushinkai, the International Aikido Alliance, the American Tomiki Aikido Association, the Zantoppakai Êñ¨Á™ÅÁ†¥‰ºö ÂêàÊ∞óÈÅì (formerly the Zantotsukai), and the Kaze Uta Budokai.

Isabel denies it, says their clothing befits their ages, and claims a lover beyond the sea. Her stepmother offers her a poisoned drink; she puts it to her own lips but is careful not to drink a drop, and gives it to Isabel, who drinks and dies.

Unlike her other novels, it is based partly on a documented occurrence; however, as the author states in a note, she takes liberties with the facts. Plot summary The central figure, Hildegarde Wolf, is a fraudulent psychiatrist, n√©e Beate Pappenheim, working in Paris. She has two patients, each of whom claims to be Lord Lucan, an English earl who, in an actual event in London in 1974, killed his daughter's nanny, mistaking her for his wife. From this premise, the novel proceeds to present a series of humorous coincidences and improbabilities. As the novel continues the evils committed by Wolf and secondary characters result in disconcerting reconciliations and final happiness. The late chapters in Africa recall A Handful of Dust (1934) by Spark's model and sometime mentor Evelyn Waugh. Reception John Updike in The New Yorker described the novel as \\"one of the best of her sui-generis novels\\". Alex Clark in The Guardian called it \\"ambitious, rewardingly complex ... [an] exceptionally intelligent book. It is hard to think of another writer who could devise such a brashly absurd plot and then execute it with both flair and gravity\\". The Independent described it as \\"Part Buchanesque romp through the Scottish glens, part chilling psycho- drama\\". Kirkus Reviews said \\"Quick, incisive, often entertaining, sometimes mysterious, at a moment or two compelling, but overall and generally, slight. Yet, from this venerable author, even slight is still Sparkian\\".

The President of the Senate is the Lieutenant Governor of North Carolina, but the President Pro-Tem actually holds most of the power and presides in the absence of the Lt. Governor. He or she, a senior member of the party with a majority of seats, appoints senators to committees and also appoints certain members of state boards and commissions. From 1777 to 1868, North Carolina had no Lieutenant Governor, and the highest-ranking officer of the Senate was known as the \\"Speaker\\". The Speaker of the Senate was next in line if the office of Governor became vacant. This occurred on two occasions. Presidents Pro-Tem are elected at the beginning of each biennial session, currently in January of odd-numbered years. Between 1868 and 1992, it was rare for a President Pro-Tem to serve more than two terms. Marc Basnight, however, became arguably the most powerful North Carolina Senate leader in history and one of the state's most influential politicians when he served a record nearly 18 years as President Pro-Tem.

Kwamalasamutu is the biggest village of the Tiriy√≥ tribe. History The village was built in 1971, because Alalapadu was getting too small. The population figures vary from 685 in 2007 according to ACT, to 1,029 people in 2009 according to Medische Zending. Kwamalasamutu has a school, clinic, and a Baptist church, and since 2010 it has access to the telephone network. The economy is based on small-scale agriculture. The village is also home to small groups of the Wai Wai tribe. The last two speakers of the Mawayana language are in Kwamalasamutu as of 2015.  Tourism  The Werehpai archaeological site, which consists of caves containing petroglyphs of pre- Columbian origin, is located about 10 kilometres from Kwamalasamutu.  Healthcare  Kwamalasamutu is home to a Medische Zending healthcare centre.  Energy  Like most villages in the Surinamese interior, Kwamalasamutu relies on diesel generators for electricity. The government provides diesel oil for free to produce electricity for about 5‚Äì6 hours per day. In 1994 solar panels were installed with the intention to provide electricity for the entire day, but an evaluation study conducted in 2013 showed that lack of maintenance has meant that none of the systems installed in 1994 still worked in 2013. Instead people have used the panels from 1994 that still worked for their own systems, with some having invested in additional panels themselves. New projects are underway to provide electricity in the interior in a hybrid way, with diesel generators taking over production during night.  Transportation  Kwamalasamutu can be reached by boat on the Sipaliwini River or by plane using the Kwamelasemoetoe Airstrip which offers scheduled services to and from Paramaribo.

The lake is located in Pocono Summit, Pennsylvania at an elevation of . Fed by Dotter's Run, Hawkeye Run, Pocono Summit Creek, and several underground springs, the lake flows out to Lake Naomi via Tunkhannock Creek. There are several Tunkhannock Creeks in the Poconos. This one merges with the Tobyhanna at Pocono Lake. The Tobyhanna flows into the Lehigh, and ultimately into Delaware Bay. The lake is currently home to Stillwater Estates, and to Camp Minsi, a facility owned by the Boy Scouts of America's Minsi Trails Council. History The area where the lake is located was once a swamp. The Native Americans of the area called it \\"Klampeechen Chuppecat\\" which, in Lenape, translates to deep, dark swamp.Camp Minsi Map In the 1870s, like most of the land in the Pocono Plateau, the land was clear-cut and harvested for lumber. The swamp was destroyed and cut away to make room for a man-made lake designed to transport the cut timber downstream to sawmills. A dam was built to control the water flow and the level of the lake, while three very small streams and underground springs fed the newly made lake, which was originally called Tunhannock Lake. Tunkhannock Creek was the major outlet for the lake and logs were sent down Tunkhannock Creek to Lake Naomi and then onto a sawmill on Lake Pocono.History of Camp Minsi With the dwindling forests and growing markets, the businesses who had harvested all of the lumber began looking for new avenues of revenue‚Äîthey turned to the ice industry. From the late 1880s until the 1930s, the ice industry of the Poconos was king. Numerous ice companies sprung up in the area as ice was harvested from the shallow freshwater lakes. Soon, the Pocono Mountain Ice Company, run by Samuel Rubel, became the leading ice company in the area, buying up many of the smaller ice companies. Large ice houses were built around Lake Stillwater to store the large blocks of ice. Remnants of some of those facilities can still be seen on the south and eastern side of the lake today. Pennsylvania was the nation's third largest producer of ice, following Maine and New York. Pennsylvania consumed about 1 million tons annually, cut on the state's lakes and rivers. Aside from Stillwater Lake, Pocono Mountain Ice Company harvested ice on Saylor's Lake, Trout Lake, Lake Naomi, Pocono Lake, Mountain Spring Lake, and the Lakes at Tobyhanna. It was reported that the Pocono Mountain Ice Company was harvesting ice for 6 cents per ton. Ice workers out on the lake were paid 30 cents an hour, while those working in the icehouse, where 300-pound ice cakes were being pushed around, were paid 35 cents an hour. The Pocono Mountain Ice Company employed over 500 men during the height of the harvest. Beginning in the 1930s with the advent of refrigeration, the harvesting of the ice from the lakes became less and less profitable. Eventually, the ice companies folded, while still controlling large tracts of land. In 1949, Samuel Rubel and the Pocono Mountain Ice Company donated a majority of the land around Stillwater Lake to the Boy Scouts of America's Bethlehem Area Council (now Minsi Trails Council). The remaining land was sold to developers and was marketed in the 1960s as Stillwater Lake Estates, a development of approximately 1,000 lots (typically about two-thirds of an acre each), with amenities presently including a beach, community center, playground, nature preserve, tennis courts and marina. In 2002, Pennsylvania's Department of Environmental Protection (DEP) reclassified the dam on Stillwater Lake as a B2 High Hazard Dam. Funding was approved in the 2006 Pennsylvania State R-CAP Budget to repair the dam, however the legislators were reluctant to release the already approved funds for the project. In May, 2008 Minsi Trails Council (owners of the dam) entered into a consent order and agreement with the DEP specifying a timetable to make the required dam repairs. The council finalized engineering plans and completed the dam permit application in November 2009. The Scouts petitioned the legislators to release the $3,000,000.00 of approved funding in order to repair the dam and essentially save their camp, as well as the watershed and neighboring communities.Harrington, Tom. A Message from the Scout Executive. CampMinsi.org In late 2009, $1.31 million was released to upgrade the dam. Construction began in August 2010 with completion in spring 2011.

He attended Queen's and received his Bachelor of Arts in 1906. After graduation, Richardson entered the family business founded by his grandfather, James Richardson & Sons, at the time, one of Canada's greatest grain exporters. Business interests Richardson became vice president of the company in 1912 and its president in 1919; in 1923, he moved the main office of the firm from Kingston to Winnipeg.

Smith played with five different MLB teams but is most notable for his integral role during the 1960 World Series as a member of the Pittsburgh Pirates. During his playing career, he threw and batted right- handed, stood tall, and weighed .  Early Major League career  Smith was signed as an amateur free agent by the New York Yankees in 1949, but he never played for the Yankees. He was included in an enormous 17-player trade (being one of the largest in Major League annals) to the Baltimore Orioles after the 1954 season and made his big-league debut with the Orioles as their starting catcher on Opening Day 1955, going hitless in three at bats against Bob Porterfield of the Washington Senators. During his rookie season, Smith appeared in a career-high 135 games, 113 as a starting catcher, but in 1956, he lost his regular job to Gus Triandos (who had also been traded by the Yankees to the Orioles in that 17-player deal). Smith was swapped to the Kansas City Athletics for fellow backstop Joe Ginsberg in August 1956; he would play in Kansas City through 1959 as a catcher and third baseman, batting over .300 in 1957. Inter-league trading without waivers was inaugurated after the 1959 season, and on December 9, Smith was dealt to the Pirates for relief pitcher Dick Hall and two other players.  Place in history  The right- handed-batting Smith platooned with left-handed-hitting Smoky Burgess behind the plate during the Pirates' pennant-winning 1960 regular season. In 95 games, 66 as a starting catcher, Smith set a career high in runs batted in (45), while swatting 11 home runs and hitting .295. During the World Series against the Yankees, Smith started Games 3 and 6 against ace left-hander Whitey Ford and went 2-for-7 as Ford shut out the Pirates in each outing. Smith began Game 7 on the bench, then entered the contest in the eighth inning after starter Burgess was removed for a pinch runner. The Pirates were trailing 7‚Äì6 when Smith came to bat in the bottom of the eighth with two outs and Dick Groat and Roberto Clemente on the corners. With two balls and two strikes, Smith hit a dramatic three-run home run off right-hander Jim Coates to give the Pirates a 9‚Äì7 lead. His home run electrified the Forbes Field crowd, who thought his blast would win the World Series for the Pirates. However, his hit would be overshadowed, as the Yankees then battled back to tie it up in the top of the ninth, leading to Bill Mazeroski's walk-off homer to win the Series in the bottom of the inning, however the eighth-inning blow was pivotal, and Smith would always be remembered as one of the heroes of the 1960 World Series. Career after 1960 Smith and Burgess returned as the Pirates' platoon catchers in 1961, although Smith slumped to a .223 average with only three home runs and was left unprotected in the 1961 Major League Baseball expansion draft and was selected by the Houston Colt .45s in the premium phase of the lottery. Smith was the catcher for the first Major League game in Houston baseball history, going 2-for-4 with a home run and a double in an 11‚Äì2 rout of the Chicago Cubs on April 10, 1962. He was the Colt .45s' regular catcher during their maiden National League season and hit 12 home runs, third on the club, but batted only .235. In 1963, rookie John Bateman claimed the starting catcher job and Smith split his season between Houston and the Colt .45s' Oklahoma City 89ers affiliate. He then wrapped up his MLB career in 1964 as a backup catcher with the Cincinnati Reds, hitting only .121 in 32 games. Smith appeared in 879 games over ten Major League seasons, with his 715 hits including 148 doubles and ten triples. In addition, during the 1960‚Äì61 seasons, he was one of two Hal Smiths catching in the National League. The other, Harold Raymond Smith, toiled for the St. Louis Cardinals. Smith died on January 9, 2020 in Columbus, Texas.

Motsamai worked as a teacher before entering politics. Early life Motsamai was born in the remote village of Ha Pafoli, in the Mohale's Hoek District. She attended Eagle's Peak High School and then went on to study at the National University of Lesotho, graduating with a Bachelor of Science in Education (B.Sc.Ed.) degree and majoring in biology and chemistry. After her graduation, Motsamai began teaching at St. John's High School in Mafeteng. She later returned to the National University to complete a Master of Education (M.Ed.) degree, simultaneously working in the office of the dean. Politics 1996‚Äì2012 Motsamai entered politics in 1996, when she was elected deputy speaker of the National Assembly. Lesotho's constitution does not restrict the speakership or the deputy speakership to members of parliament, only requiring that ministers cannot be elected to those positions.The Speaker's Profile, The National Assembly of Lesotho. Retrieved 17 October 2016. Motsamai succeeded to the speakership in 1999, following the death of John Teboho Kolane. She became Lesotho's first female speaker, and was also believed to be the youngest speaker in Africa. When she took office, the National Assembly had only three female MPs.NTLHOI MOTSAMAI ‚Äì LESOTHO, Gender Links, 1 May 2002. Retrieved 17 October 2016. In 2005, Motsamai nominated Bereng Sekhonyana to represent Lesotho at a SADC parliamentary reform conference in Botswana. Justin Lekhanya (the leader of the Basotho National Party) objected to her decision, and subsequently organised a series of protests at the National Assembly buildings. The assembly's privileges committee subsequently found that Lekhanya and four other BNP members had threatened and intimidated Motsamai, and recommended that they be suspended from parliament without pay for up to five months. Sekhonyana was assassinated two days after that finding was handed down.Rosenberg and Weisfelder, p. 55 2012‚Äìpresent In February 2012, Prime Minister Pakalitha Mosisili left the Lesotho Congress for Democracy (LCD) party to form a new party, the Democratic Congress. He was joined by 44 other members of parliament. When parliament returned, Motsamai (who had joined the new party) asked MPs to stand in the seats to show their support for Mosisili's government, and subsequently ruled that he still had control of the assembly and could thus remain in power.\\"Metsing accuses speaker of violating procedures\\", Lesotho Times, 29 February 2012.

The patient's blood is removed and replaced by donated blood or blood components. This exchange transfusion can be performed manually or using a machine (apheresis). Most blood transfusions involve adding blood or blood products without removing any blood, these are also known as simple transfusions or top-up transfusions. Exchange transfusion is used in the treatment of a number of diseases, including sickle-cell disease and hemolytic disease of the newborn. Partial exchange might be required for polycythemia. Nearly all exchange transfusions are allogeneic (that is, the new blood or blood products come from another person or persons, via donated blood); autologous exchange transfusion is possible (using autologous blood banking), but there are not many situations in which a need for it arises, as most autologous transfusions involve no exchange. Description An exchange transfusion requires that the patient's blood can be removed and replaced. In most cases, this involves placing one or more thin tubes, called catheters, into a blood vessel. The exchange transfusion is done in cycles: each one usually lasts a few minutes. The patient‚Äôs blood is slowly withdrawn (usually about 5 to 20 mL at a time, depending on the patient‚Äôs size and the severity of illness), and a slightly larger amount of fresh, prewarmed blood or plasma flows into the patient's body. This cycle is repeated until the correct volume of blood has been replaced. After the exchange transfusion, catheters may be left in place in case the procedure needs to be repeated. In diseases such as sickle cell anemia, blood is removed and replaced with donor blood. In conditions such as neonatal polycythemia, a specific amount of the child‚Äôs blood is removed and replaced with normal saline, plasma (the clear liquid portion of blood), or an albumin solution. This decreases the total number of red blood cells in the body and makes it easier for blood to flow through the body.  Medical Uses   Sickle Cell Disease  Transfusion therapy is used as an emergency procedure to treat life-threatening complications of sickle-cell disease as well as an elective procedure to stop these complications occurring. = Treatment of life-threatening complications = * Acute cerebrovascular event (stroke) * Acute chest syndrome with respiratory failure * Multi-organ failure *Mesenteric girdle syndrome The commonest emergency reason is to treat an acute chest syndrome. = Prevention = * Prior to surgery in people with sickle cell anemia (HbSS) who already have a hemoglobin above 85g/L, or who require a prolonged operation with general anesthetic, or who need high-risk surgery * To optimise hemoglobin S levels, for example to prevent a stroke occurring in a child. The target is usually to maintain a hemoglobin S level below 30% to prevent complications occurring. The most common routine reason is to prevent a stroke occurring or re- occurring.  Hemolytic Disease of the Newborn  Exchange transfusion to treat hemolytic disease of the newborn is now uncommon since the introduction of Anti-D prophylaxis in pregnancy. However, it can occur due to the development of other antibodies such as anti-c, anti-E, and ABO.  Polycythemia  Polycythemia, a condition in which the number of red cells in the blood is too high, is usually diagnosed when the hematocrit is above 65%. Polycythemia can occur in neonates for multiple different reasons including: babies born after 42 weeks gestation (post-term), babies born to diabetic mothers, twin to twin transfusion, intrauterine growth restriction, and babies with genetic abnormalities. Polycythemia can make the blood thicker than normal and therefore lead to complications. Partial exchange transfusion has been used as a treatment to prevent complications, and has been shown to improve cerebral blood flow, but there is no evidence that it prevents long- term complications.  Severe malaria  Exchange transfusion has been used for the treatment of severe malaria in the past. However, in 2013 the CDC examined the limited evidence available and found no evidence that exchange transfusion has any beneficial effects (decreased mortality) in people with very high parasite loads (> 10%). Also, although uncommon, exchange transfusion can cause complications (low blood pressure (hypotension), abnormal heart rhythms (ventricular fibrillation) and breathing problems (acute respiratory distress syndrome)). Based on this evidence, the CDC no longer recommend the use of exchange transfusion in the treatment of malaria. Risks General risks are the same as with any transfusion. Other possible complications include: * Blood clots * Changes in blood chemistry (high or low potassium, low calcium, low glucose, change in acid-base balance in the blood ) * Heart and lung problems * Infection (greatly decreased risk due to careful screening of blood) * Shock due to inadequate replacement of blood Recovery The person may need to be monitored for several days in the hospital after the transfusion, but the length of stay generally depends on the condition for which the exchange transfusion was performed. History The technique was originally developed by Alexander S. Wiener, soon after he co-discovered the Rh factor.

Many years later, as the man is dying, he requests that his two eldest children, a son and daughter, always look after their youngest brother and to never abandon him. His children promise, and the man is able to die in peace. However, after the death of their mother, the eldest son wishes to go to the village where his father had been born. Despite his sister reminding him of the promise, the eldest son leaves anyway, finding the village and starting a family of his own. His sister later follows her eldest brother, leaving the youngest son to fend for himself when she begins to view him as a burden. She too finds the village and marries. The youngest child is able to live off the supplies left behind, but when winter comes he is left starving. To survive he begins to eat anything left behind by wolves, until the wolves become used to the boy and allow him to share their meals. When spring arrives the boy follows the wolves to the shores, and by chance his brother happens to be fishing nearby. The eldest brother remembers the promise as the boy sings out that he is becoming a wolf as well. His brother calls to the boy, but the child gradually transforms into a wolf himself and runs off with the rest of the pack.

The short was released on November 6, 1937, and features Egghead, the early character who later became Elmer Fudd. Plot The cartoon features the basic plot of Little Red Riding Hood, with a few twists and oddball Tex Avery- like gags, such as Red displaying a Katharine Hepburn persona, or Grandma ordering a case of gin, while the wolf waits impatiently for her to get off the phone so he can chase her again. The cartoon opens with the wolf playing on a vintage pinball machine. He notices Red walking by outside the window and drives after her along the sidewalk in his car. His advances fail and he decides to take a shortcut to her grandmother's house after being given the route by Egghead. As soon as the wolf arrives at grandma's house he knocks on the door and imitates an impression of Elmer Blurt from The Al Pearce Show. The grandma tells him to stay away but the wolf decides to burst through the door. This proves unsuccessful when he subsequently crashes through all the doors in the house and ends up in the backyard with his hat over his feet. He pulls the back doors knob and in a pinball reference, the door opens. He chases grandma around the house until she hops on a chair and crosses her fingers declaring King's X. She uses the phone to make a grocery order while the wolf waits impatiently for her to resume the chase. As the characters begin chasing each other again, grandma hides in the closet and the wolf asks her for her clothes as Red is at the door. The wolf hops into bed and asks Red to come closer. When Red exclaims, \\"Oh Grandmother, what large teeth you present\\" the wolf lunges at her and they start fighting in the corner of the room. Two silhouettes of patrons who are late to the screening show up and the wolf asks Red to wait for them to get seated. They resume fighting until Egghead shows up a sixth time and hits the wolf over the head with a mallet. As the \\"iris\\" comes back Egghead is shown repeatedly kissing Red.

Characteristics The banded linsang grows to , with a long tail that can reach . It is a pale yellow with five dark bands. It has broad stripes on its neck and its tail consists of several dark bands with a dark tip. The banded linsang has very sharp retractable claws and razor sharp teeth. Distribution and habitat The banded linsang has been recorded in southern Myanmar, Thailand, Peninsular Malaysia, and the Sunda Islands of Borneo, Sumatra, Java, Bangka and Belitung Islands. It lives in evergreen forests. In Thailand and Malaysia it has been recorded in deciduous forest, and in Sarawak also in secondary forest and close to oil palm plantations. In 2013, a banded linsang was recorded for the first time by a camera-trap in the hill forests of Karen State. Ecology and behaviour The banded linsang is nocturnal and usually solitary. It is carnivorous, with its diet consisting of small vertebrates, such as birds, rats, and snakes. Very little is known about the banded linsang's reproduction. It is thought that litters of 2‚Äì3 are born semiannually in a nest in burrows or hollow trees. Taxonomy Until recently the two species of Asiatic linsangs were considered to be members of the family Viverridae and to be related to the morphologically similar genets. However, recent genetic taxonomy investigations have strongly suggested that the Asiatic linsangs are a sister-group of the cat family, Felidae. It has been proposed that the Asiatic linsangs be placed in the monogeneric family Prionodontidae.Gaubert, P. and Veron, G.

It is thus distinguished from community-acquired pneumonia. It is usually caused by a bacterial infection, rather than a virus.

Ventilator-associated pneumonia Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) is a sub-type of hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP) which occurs in people who are receiving mechanical ventilation. VAP is not characterized by the causative agents; rather, as its name implies, definition of VAP is restricted to patients undergoing mechanical ventilation while in a hospital. A positive culture after intubation is indicative of ventilator-associated pneumonia and is diagnosed as such. In order to appropriately categorize the causative agent or mechanism it is usually recommended to obtain a culture prior to initiating mechanical ventilation as a reference. Healthcare-associated pneumonia (HCAP) HCAP is a condition in patients who can come from the community, but have frequent contact with the healthcare environment. Historically, the etiology and prognosis of nursing home pneumonia appeared to differ from other types of community acquired pneumonia, with studies reporting a worse prognosis and higher incidence of multi drug resistant organisms as etiology agents. The definition criteria which has been used is the same as the one which has been previously used to identify bloodstream healthcare associated infections. HCAP is no longer recognized as a clinically independent entity. This is due to increasing evidence from a growing number of studies that many patients defined as having HCAP are not at high risk for MDR pathogens. As a result, 2016 IDSA guidelines removed consideration of HCAP as a separate clinical entity. =Definition= Healthcare-associated pneumonia can be defined as pneumonia in a patient with at least one of the following risk factors: * hospitalization in an acute care hospital for two or more days in the last 90 days; * residence in a nursing home or long-term care facility in the last 30 days * receiving outpatient intravenous therapy (like antibiotics or chemotherapy) within the past 30 days * receiving home wound care within the past 30 days * attending a hospital clinic or dialysis center in the last 30 days * having a family member with known multi-drug resistant pathogens =Causes= In some studies, the bacteria found in patients with HCAP were more similar to HAP than to CAP; compared to CAP, they could have higher rates of Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus) and Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and less Streptococcus pneumoniae and Haemophilus influenzae. In European and Asian studies, the etiology of HCAP was similar to that of CAP, and rates of multi drug resistant pathogens such as Staphylococcus aureus and Pseudomonas aeruginosa were not as high as seen in North American studies. It is well known that nursing home residents have high rates of colonization with MRSA. However, not all studies have found high rates of S. aureus and gram-negative bacteria. One factor responsible for these differences is the reliance on sputum samples and the strictness of the criteria to discriminate between colonising or disease-causing bacteria. Moreover, sputum samples might be less frequently obtained in the elderly.Aspiration (both of microscopic drops and macroscopic amounts of nose and throat secretions) is thought to be the most important cause of HCAP. Dental plaque might also be a reservoir for bacteria in HCAP. Bacteria have been the most commonly isolated pathogens, although viral and fungal pathogens are potentially found in immunocompromised hosts (patients on chronic immunosuppressed medications, solid organ and bone marrow transplant recipients). In general, the distribution of microbial pathogens varies among institutions, partly because of differences in patient population and local patterns of anti microbial resistance in hospitals and critical care units'clevelandcliniceded.com Common bacterial pathogens include aerobic GNB, such as Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Acinetobacter baumanii, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Escherichia coli as well as gram-positive organisms such as Staphylococcus aureus. In patients with an early onset pneumonia (within 5 days of hospitalization), they are usually due to anti microbial-sensitive bacteria such as Enterobacter spp, E. coli, Klebsiella spp, Proteus spp, Serratia mare scans, community pathogens such as Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, and methicillin-sensitive S. aureus should also be considered.Rouille the JL. Ventilator-associated pneumonia: an comprehensive review. Hosp Pract (Minneap) 2012; 40:165‚Äì175(clevelandclinicmeded.com) Pneumonia that starts in the hospital tends to be more serious than other lung infections because: people in the hospital are often very sick and cannot fight off germs. The types of germs present in a hospital are often more dangerous and more resistant to treatment than those outside in the community. Pneumonia occurs more often in people who are using a respirator. This machine helps them breathe. Hospital-acquired pneumonia can also be spread by health care workers, who can pass germs from their hands or clothes from one person to another. This is why hand-washing, wearing grows, and using other safety measures is so important in the hospital.(Medlineplus.gov) =Treatment= Patients with HCAP are more likely than those with community-acquired pneumonia to receive inappropriate antibiotics that do not target the bacteria causing their disease. In 2002, an expert panel made recommendations about the evaluation and treatment of probable nursing home-acquired pneumonia. They defined probably pneumonia, emphasized expedite antibiotic treatment (which is known to improve survival) and drafted criteria for the hospitalization of willing patients. For initial treatment in the nursing home, a fluoroquinolone antibiotic suitable for respiratory infections (moxifloxacin, for example), or amoxicillin with clavulanic acid plus a macrolide has been suggested. In a hospital setting, injected (parenteral) fluoroquinolones or a second- or third-generation cephalosporin plus a macrolide could be used. Other factors that need to be taken into account are recent antibiotic therapy (because of possible resistance caused by recent exposure), known carrier state or risk factors for resistant organisms (for example, known carrier of MRSA or presence of bronchiectasis predisposing to Pseudomonas aeruginosa), or suspicion of possible Legionella pneumophila infection (legionnaires disease). In 2005, the American Thoracic Society and Infectious Diseases Society of America have published guidelines suggesting antibiotics specifically for HCAP. The guidelines recommend combination therapy with an agent from each of the following groups to cover for both Pseudomonas aeruginosa and MRSA. This is based on studies using sputum samples and intensive care patients, in whom these bacteria were commonly found. * cefepime, ceftazidime, imipenem, meropenem or piperacillin‚Äìtazobactam; plus * ciprofloxacin, levofloxacin, amikacin, gentamicin, or tobramycin; plus * linezolid or vancomycin In one observational study, empirical antibiotic treatment that was not according to international treatment guidelines was an independent predictor of worse outcome among HCAP patients. Guidelines from Canada suggest that HCAP can be treated like community-acquired pneumonia with antibiotics targeting Streptococcus pneumoniae, based on studies using blood cultures in different settings which have not found high rates of MRSA or Pseudomonas. Besides prompt antibiotic treatment, supportive measure for organ failure (such as cardiac decompensation) are also important. Another consideration goes to hospital referral; although more severe pneumonia requires admission to an acute care facility, this also predisposes to hazards of hospitalization such as delirium, urinary incontinence, depression, falls, restraint use, functional decline, adverse drug effects and hospital infections. Therefore, mild pneumonia might be better dealt with inside the long-term care facility. In patients with a limited life expectancy (for example, those with advanced dementia), end-of-life pneumonia also requires recognition and appropriate, palliative care. =Prognosis= Healthcare-associated pneumonia seems to have fatality rates similar to hospital-acquired pneumonia, worse than community-acquired pneumonia but less severe than pneumonia in ventilated patients. Besides clinical markers like tachypnea (fast breathing) or a high white cell count (leukocytosis), the prognosis seems to be influenced by the underlying associated diseases (comorbidities) and functional capacities (for example, the ADL score). Many patients have a decreased health condition after the episode. =Epidemiology= Several studies found that healthcare- associated pneumonia is the second most common type of pneumonia, occurring less commonly than community-acquired pneumonia but more frequently than hospital-acquired pneumonia and ventilator-associated pneumonia. In a recent observational study, the rates for CAP, HCAP and HAP were 60%, 25% and 15% respectively. Patients with HCAP are older and more commonly have simultaneous health problems (such as previous stroke, heart failure and diabetes). The number of residents in long-term care facilities is expected to rise dramatically over the next 30 years. These older adults are known to develop pneumonia 10 times more than their community-dwelling peers, and hospital admittance rates are 30 times higher. =Nursing home-acquired pneumonia= Nursing home-acquired pneumonia is an important subgroup of HCAP. Residents of long-term care facilities may become infected through their contacts with the healthcare system; as such, the microbes responsible for their pneumonias may be different from those traditionally seen in community-dwelling patients, requiring therapy with different antibiotics. Other groups include patients who are admitted as a day case for regular hemodialysis or intravenous infusion (for example, chemotherapy). Especially in the very old and in demented patients, HCAP is likely to present with atypical symptoms.  Risk factors  Among the factors contributing to contracting HAP are mechanical ventilation (ventilator-associated pneumonia), old age, decreased filtration of inspired air, intrinsic respiratory, neurologic, or other disease states that result in respiratory tract obstruction, trauma, (abdominal) surgery, medications, diminished lung volumes, or decreased clearance of secretions may diminish the defenses of the lung. Also, poor hand-washing and inadequate disinfection of respiratory devices cause cross-infection and are important factors.  Pathogenesis  Most nosocomial respiratory infections are caused by so-called microaspiration of upper airway secretions, through inapparent aspiration, into the lower respiratory tract. Also, \\"macroaspirations\\" of esophageal or gastric material is known to result in HAP. Since it results from aspiration either type is called aspiration pneumonia. Although gram- negative bacilli are a common cause they are rarely found in the respiratory tract of people without pneumonia, which has led to speculation of the mouth and throat as origin of the infection.  Diagnosis  In hospitalised patients who develop respiratory symptoms and fever, one should consider the diagnosis. The likelihood increases when upon investigation symptoms are found of respiratory insufficiency, purulent secretions, newly developed infiltrate on the chest X-Ray, and increasing leucocyte count. If pneumonia is suspected material from sputum or tracheal aspirates are sent to the microbiology department for cultures. In case of pleural effusion, thoracentesis is performed for examination of pleural fluid. In suspected ventilator-associated pneumonia it has been suggested that bronchoscopy(BAL) is necessary because of the known risks surrounding clinical diagnoses.  Differential diagnosis  * Atelectasis * Congestive heart failure * Pulmonary embolism  Treatment  Usually initial therapy is empirical. If sufficient reason to suspect influenza, one might consider oseltamivir. In case of legionellosis, erythromycin or fluoroquinolone. A third generation cephalosporin (ceftazidime) + carbapenems (imipenem) + beta lactam & beta lactamase inhibitors (piperacillin/tazobactam)  References  Further reading Morrow L.

Densities of Malay civets are higher in unlogged than in a logged forests. Fruit comprises a larger proportion of diet in unlogged forest compared to logged forest. With fruit contributing a larger percentage of the diet in unlogged forests, logging may lead to increased competition by other frugivores such as palm civets which may exploit fruit directly on trees unlike the mainly terrestrial Malay civet.Col√≥n, C.

Around the Malaysian Bera Lake Malay civets were found in logged forest. Arboreal, frugivorous civets are little affected by logging, whereas terrestrial, carnivorous or insectivorous species might be negatively impacted by logging.Syakirah, S., Zubaid, A., Prentice, C., Lopez, A., Azmin, M.

Threats As a ground-living species it is exposed to snaring and other forms of ground- level trapping, and hunting with dogs. The limited survey in areas heavily used by people suggests it is rather well able to persist at general levels of threat. The species is occasionally hunted for food and treated as a pest as it raids poultry. In Borneo, the Malayan civet is negatively affected by the effects of timber harvesting.Meijaard, E. (ed.).

It became established as a constituent of McGill University in 1904 as the McGill Dental School, a department in the McGill University Faculty of Medicine until becoming its own faculty in 1920. The faculty is closely affiliated with the Montreal General Hospital, Jewish General Hospital, Montreal Children's Hospital, and McGill University Faculty of Medicine. It is located in the heart of Downtown Montreal across the Roddick Gates entrance to the McGill campus. It is the only dental program in the country that integrates MD and DMD education in single classes for the first four semesters of the \\"Fundamentals of Medicine and Dentistry\\" curriculum. It is home to the largest residency program in Canada which consists of three sites Montreal General Hospital, Jewish General Hospital, and Montreal Children's Hospital. History The Faculty Practice The origins of the McGill Faculty of Dentistry are traced to the Dental College of the Province of Quebec in 1892, the second dental school to be established in Canada after the Royal College of Dental Surgeons. As a bilingual professional school, it later became a part of Bishop's University's Faculty of Medicine. In 1904, it became the McGill Dental School as a department within the faculty of medicine at McGill as part of its amalgamation of Bishop's University's relatively small faculty of medicine. It officially became its own faculty in the year 1920. In 2014, the faculty completed an $18.3 million building project to relocate the dental facilities into a new building in the heart of McGill University's downtown campus. Curriculum The faculty offers a Doctor of Medicine in Dentistry (D.M.D.) degree. In keeping with the joint history of the McGill University Faculty of Medicine with the Faculty of Dentistry, the D.M.D. students undertake a joint curriculum with the M.D.,C.M. students in the Fundamentals of Medicine and Dentistry curriculum in the first 18 months of their medical education, along with additional dentistry-related courses. In the second year, when the medical curriculum is complete, dental students transition into a fundamentals of dentistry curriculum followed by practical pre-clinic. The faculty also confers several graduate level degrees: thesis M.Sc. in Dental Sciences; non-thesis M.Sc. in Dental Sciences; and a Ph.D. in Craniofacial Health Sciences, which are also available to international applicants. In addition to the undergraduate level dental curriculum, there are 3 General Practice Residency (GPR) programs affiliated with the faculty including those at the Montreal General Hospital, Jewish General Hospital, and the Montreal Children's Hospital. The faculty also has a six-year oral and maxillofacial surgery (OMFS)/Doctor of Medicine, Master of Surgery (M.D.,C.M.) program offered at the Montreal General Hospital, a Level-1 Trauma Center. There are approximately 150-160 students enrolled in the undergraduate level (D.M.D.), with an additional ~90 graduate students and 33 in the G.P.R. and M.D.,C.M.-OMFS residency programs. The faculty of dentistry also offers a robust curriculum of continuing education courses accredited by both the American Dental Association‚Äôs Continuing Education Recognition Program (ADA- CERP) and the Canadian dental licensing bodies, including as a preferred partner by the Ordre des dentistes du Qu√©bec (ODQ). The D.M.D. and specialty programs at McGill University are accredited by the American Dental Association (ADA) through the Commission on Dental Accreditation (CODA). Research McGill's Faculty of Dentistry boasts an impressive, world- renowned cohort of multi- and interdisciplinary researchers. The faculty research is concentrated in 4 major areas: pain and neuroscience; mineralized tissues and extracellular matrix biology; biomaterials, nanobiotechnology and tissue engineering; and population oral health. Approximately one-third of all oral health-related research in Canada is performed at McGill despite it being represented by only 5% of the Canadian dentistry professors. It also graduates more dental research graduate students than any other dental school in Canada. McGill's Faculty of Dentistry also produces more per capita research funding to McGill compared to the McGill Faculty of Medicine, despite the faculty's size. The faculty also hosts its research activities within multiple research sites including at the Faculty of Dentistry building on Sherbrooke, at the Montreal General Hospital, the Jewish General Hospital, the Montreal Children's Hospital, the Strathcona Anatomy & Dentistry Building, the Alan Edwards Pain Management Unit, and at the McGill Faculty of Medicine. Reputation The Faculty of Dentistry is notoriously competitive in terms of admissions with an acceptance rate of 4.6% for the 2018 admissions cycle. The number of admissions to the D.M.D. program is approximately 37-38 students annually. For the 2020 admissions cycle, the average accepted Canadian resident cGPA was 3.90. For the last several cycles of admission the average undergraduate cGPA was 3.84 (post-graduate GPA is not considered in admissions) with approximately 8-9 entering students having completed a Masters or Doctorate degree. As of the year 2014, applicants are interviewed via Multiple Mini-Interviews (MMI) held at the McGill University Steinberg Centre for Simulation and Interactive Learning (SCSIL), along with the prospective Faculty of Medicine students. Students are also initially screened prior to interview selection via the CASPer test. McGill University is ranked as the number 1 medical-doctoral school nationally in Canada by Maclean's for 15 straight years (including the most recent ranking in 2020). McGill Faculty of Dentistry students have the highest rate of residency or specialization in the country with approximately 90% of the graduating students ultimately continuing their education via either specialty or residency. The Faculty of Dentistry has a wide-ranging community service program offered with funding through the faculty, student fundraising initiatives, and external donors. These programs include the Jim Lund Dental Clinic at the Welcome Hall Mission, the Montreal Children's Hospital Clinic for new immigrants and refugees, the McGill Mobile Dental Clinic, and the McGill Summer Dental Clinic, which provided a combined $933,735 of free dental care to the underprivileged in the year 2017‚Äì2018. The faculty was recently awarded the Gies Award for Outstanding Vision by the American Dental Education Association in 2019.

The first three episodes are the three-part episode entitled \\"The Alien Costume\\" from season one. The last two are the two-part episode entitled \\"Venom Returns\\" and \\"Carnage\\" which debuted in season three. These certain episodes are responsible for debuting the symbiotic characters Venom and Carnage outside of comic books. The arc was released on DVD as Spider-Man: The Venom Saga.https://comicsalliance.com/spider-man-cartoons-through-the-years/ \\"The Alien Costume\\"  Production  There were many difficulties with bringing Venom to television because everyone had different ideas for the Venom story. Len Wein wrote the first draft, which was rejected. In a later meeting the creative team came up with a scene by scene plot for the show. The show took a different approach to bringing the alien costume to Earth from the comic books. In this episode the alien costume is brought by a space shuttle, while in the comics, Spider-Man first wore the symbiote during the Secret Wars storyline on an alien planet called Battleworld, and later brought back to Earth. The ending of part 2 is loosely based on Web of Spider-Man #1, in which, Spider-Man removes the symbiote costume using the loud noise created by a church bell. The symbiote flees and merges with Eddie Brock, transforming him into Venom. This is a direct adaptation of the comics storyline. John Semper took the idea of Eddie Brock following Spider-Man on a train in part 3 from Alfred Hitchcock's \\"Strangers on a Train\\" like Robert Walker did in that movie. Promethium is an actual element. \\"The Alien Costume\\" is the only three- part episode from season 1 of the animated series Spider-Man. Venom was one of Spider-Man's most popular villains at the time this episode aired. Originally this was going to be a two-part episode, however, the fans wanted to see more of the black costume, so a new part 2 was added into the middle of the episodes.  Part One  John Jameson and fellow astronaut Paul Stevens discover a rock known as \\"Promethium X\\", which is said to be more powerful than plutonium. Unknown to the astronaut though, Promethium X also contains a mysterious element which manages to break free and tries to consume the two Astronauts. The space shuttle crashes on Manhattan Bridge, near the Hudson River, where Rhino is sent by The Kingpin to steal the Promethium X. Spider- Man arrives on the scene and manages to save Jameson and his fellow astronaut, yet unknown to Spider Man, Eddie Brock is on the bridge too, and takes photos of him (and Rhino as well). However, when Jonah arrives on the scene, Eddie uses propaganda and frames Spider-Man for stealing something from the shuttle, which leads to a $1 million dollar bounty on Spider Man's head. However, Eddie deliberately does not mention to have seen Rhino at the scene also. Meanwhile, at home, Peter throws his costume in the garbage, as it is now useless to him. However, when he returned from the crash site, his suit carried what appeared to be \\"rich, thick, and creamy\\" Hudson River pollution. When Peter went to bed, the substance oozed over him and began to give him a nightmare and when he woke up, he found himself hanging from a building in a costume he had never seen before! This costume enhances Spider-Man's abilities. Meanwhile, Kingpin needed to gain some materials to test the power of Promethium X, he sent the Rhino to gain the necessary materials for his machine. Spider-Man managed to stop him, but almost lost himself to the power and tries to kill the Rhino. He eventually had to retreat back to the city, and ponder how the suit is changing him.  Part Two  The story continues where it last left off, with the whole city hunting Spider-Man for Jonah's $1 million bounty. Spider- Man manages to fight them off until he is shot with a Sonic Blaster device, which weakens him. Despite this, Spider-Man manages to escape, and focuses his attention on Eddie Brock and Jonah Jameson and warns him to call off his reward, also mentioning Rhino and how Brock neglected to mention him. After Jonah visits his hospitalized son, Jameson finds out from him that Brock was lying and fires him. He also calls off the manhunt for Spider-Man. Noticing another disturbing change in his behavior, Spider-Man seeks the assistance of Doctor Curt Connors, who studies the suit and realizes that it is a Symbiote. Spider-Man then uses the symbiote's powers to find a clue in Eddie's apartment, only to run into the Shocker, sent by The Kingpin to destroy the evidence Brock has of the crash site. The two fight, and Shocker gains the advantage, and flees, but Spider-Man follows him. Following Shocker leads him to Alistair Smythe and the Promethium X, which Spider-Man steals. Kingpin and Shocker form a plan to kidnap John Jameson in an attempt to gain the Promethium X back. Using John as bait, they manage to lure Spider-Man, to an old church. There the Shocker attacks Spider-Man, but is defeated. Eddie Brock tries to intervene, but is webbed up for his efforts. With Shocker at the mercy of Spider-Man, he begs for his life as Spider-Man is about to push him to his death. Spider-Man's conscience gets to him and he relents, only to have the symbiote push Shocker off the belltower, but Spider-Man uses two web lines to save him. Spider-Man, remembering how the symbiote was unusually weakened when he was earlier attacked with a Sonic Blaster, realizes that it is particularly sensitive to loud noises. Spider-Man then uses the church bells and the noise weakens the symbiote, and it sloughs off Peter and slinks weakly away. Peter Parker leaves, relieved to be away from the symbiote. Back at the Kingpin's headquarters, Smythe discovers why Spider-Man was so willing to trade the dangerous Promethium X back to them: as it turns out, Promethium X has an extremely short half-life, and in a matter of days it has already decayed into a harmless lump of lead. However, the symbiote was still alive and found a new host in Eddie Brock (who's cocooned by Spider-Man) and transformed him into his greatest unlikely friend and foe ‚Äì Venom. Part Three Spider-Man had returned to his old costume. He soon came across The Rhino and The Shocker. While Spider-Man was able to easily defeat The Rhino, The Shocker managed to get the upper hand. However, an unknown 'ally' arrived and defeated the two villains himself. The new 'ally' proved to be Eddie Brock, who revealed himself as 'Venom'. Spider-Man attempted to reason with Brock, but Venom webbed up Spider-Man and removed the hero's mask high over a crowded street. Venom allowed Spider-Man to live, haunting his every step. Venom ruined a date with Mary Jane and menaced Spider-Man's aunt, so Spider- Man decided to fight back. He put some archives newspaper pages, featuring Brock's firing of Daily Bugle. He set a trap for the villain near the launch of a space shuttle. The noise from the rocket's afterburners forced the symbiote off of Brock, and Spider-Man webbed the creature to the rocket. The symbiote was blasted into space, and Eddie Brock was imprisoned at Ravencroft Asylum. At the episode's conclusion, Spider-Man (as Peter Parker) and Mary Jane regard the night sky and wonder what else might be up there. Venom's menacing face appears on the moon.  \\"Venom Returns\\" and \\"Carnage\\"  Production \\"Venom Returns\\" and \\"Carnage\\" are the eleventh and twelfth episodes from the third season of the Spider-Man animated series, also marking the thirty-eighth and thirty-ninth episodes. \\"Venom Returns\\" The symbiote returns to Earth and travels to Ravencroft to reunite with Eddie Brock, who then escapes as Venom. He is ordered by Dormammu, to whom the symbiote owes its earthly return, to steal a machine from Stark Enterprises capable of releasing Dormammu from his own far-off dimension. When Venom battles Spider-Man and War Machine, he is easily defeated by the two heroes. Baron Mordo and Dormammu help Eddie Brock's insane cell-mate Cletus Kassidy bond with a symbiote, who later dubs himself Carnage. Carnage then assists Venom in his task to retrieve the technology from Stark Enterprises, though when Carnage attempts to destroy Spider-Man, Venom attacks him, telling him that Spider-Man is Venom's and Venom's only. \\"Carnage\\" When Venom refuses to continue to work for Dormammu, Carnage is considered sufficient to collect life-force which is essential for Dormammu to enter Earth. Carnage kidnaps Dr. Ashley Kafka, whom Eddie has fallen in love with. Eddie then reluctantly teams with Iron Man and Spider-Man to save her. They are forced to send Carnage as well as Dormammu into the other dimension, as it appears he has formed a link between himself and Carnage. Carnage, unwilling to leave Earth alone, attempts to drag Ashley with him, though Venom sacrifices himself for the woman he loves.

It has an island platform layout and is reached by level crossings from Great South Road and Ferguson Street. There have been proposals to relocate this station approximately north to a more visible location next to the Great South Road, near the overbridge. In 2013, it was instead discussed that Auckland Transport would potentially close the station, as patronage numbers had not improved significantly. About 1,000 locals opposed the closure option in a petition, and noted that a new residential subdivision was to start construction in the area. Auckland Transport however noted that the planned houses were generally too far away from the station for potential passengers to walk to it.  History  The station was opened on 16 August 1926.

It originated in Central Europe in the 19th century from cross- breeding of local stock with Simmental cattle imported from Switzerland. Today, the worldwide population is 41 million animals. History The Fleckvieh originated in the Austrian Empire and the Kingdom of Bavaria from cross-breeding of local stock with Simmental cattle imported from Switzerland from about 1830. The Simmental had good milk-producing and draught qualities, and the resulting crosses were triple-purpose animals with milk, meat, and draught capabilities. The Fleckvieh is now a dual-purpose breed; it may be used for the production of beef or milk, or be crossed with dairy breeds or with beef breeds. It is reported from several European countries, including Austria, Belgium, Germany, the Netherlands, and Spain, and also, since 2009, from Switzerland; in Hungary, the Fleckvieh is present on many small farms and its importance is growing steadily. It is also reported from other countries of the world, including Paraguay, Peru, and Uruguay. Meat production A comparison was made between the rates of muscle growth and energy use of Fleckvieh bulls as compared to German Black Pied (Schwartzbunte) bulls. The Fleckvieh bulls had faster growth rates, the carcasses had a smaller proportion of fat, especially abdominal fat, and the animals could be slaughtered at an earlier date on similar diets.

The major difference between the two is that a photonic integrated circuit provides functions for information signals imposed on optical wavelengths typically in the visible spectrum or near infrared 850 nm-1650 nm. The most commercially utilized material platform for photonic integrated circuits is indium phosphide (InP), which allows for the integration of various optically active and passive functions on the same chip. Initial examples of photonic integrated circuits were simple 2-section distributed Bragg reflector (DBR) lasers, consisting of two independently controlled device sections - a gain section and a DBR mirror section. Consequently, all modern monolithic tunable lasers, widely tunable lasers, externally modulated lasers and transmitters, integrated receivers, etc. are examples of photonic integrated circuits. As of 2012, devices integrate hundreds of functions onto a single chip. Pioneering work in this arena was performed at Bell Laboratories. Most notable academic centers of excellence of photonic integrated circuits in InP are the University of California at Santa Barbara, USA, and the Eindhoven University of Technology in the Netherlands. A 2005 development showed that silicon can, even though it is an indirect bandgap material, still be used to generate laser light via the Raman nonlinearity. Such lasers are not electrically driven but optically driven and therefore still necessitate a further optical pump laser source. Comparison to electronic integration Unlike electronic integration where silicon is the dominant material, system photonic integrated circuits have been fabricated from a variety of material systems, including electro-optic crystals such as lithium niobate, silica on silicon, Silicon on insulator, various polymers and semiconductor materials which are used to make semiconductor lasers such as GaAs and InP. The different material systems are used because they each provide different advantages and limitations depending on the function to be integrated. For instance, silica (silicon dioxide) based PICs have very desirable properties for passive photonic circuits such as AWGs (see below) due to their comparatively low losses and low thermal sensitivity, GaAs or InP based PICs allow the direct integration of light sources and Silicon PICs enable co-integration of the photonics with transistor based electronics. The fabrication techniques are similar to those used in electronic integrated circuits in which photolithography is used to pattern wafers for etching and material deposition. Unlike electronics where the primary device is the transistor, there is no single dominant device. The range of devices required on a chip includes low loss interconnect waveguides, power splitters, optical amplifiers, optical modulators, filters, lasers and detectors. These devices require a variety of different materials and fabrication techniques making it difficult to realize all of them on a single chip. Newer techniques using resonant photonic interferometry is making way for UV LEDs to be used for optical computing requirements with much cheaper costs leading the way to petahertz PHz consumer electronics. Examples of photonic integrated circuits The primary application for photonic integrated circuits is in the area of fiber-optic communication though applications in other fields such as biomedical and photonic computing are also possible. The arrayed waveguide grating (AWG) which are commonly used as optical (de)multiplexers in wavelength division multiplexed (WDM) fiber-optic communication systems are an example of a photonic integrated circuit which has replaced previous multiplexing schemes which utilized multiple discrete filter elements. Since separating optical modes is a need for quantum computing, this technology may be helpful to miniaturize quantum computers (see linear optical quantum computing). Another example of a photonic integrated chip in wide use today in fiber-optic communication systems is the externally modulated laser (EML) which combines a distributed feed back laser diode with an electro-absorption modulator Encyclopedia of Laser Physics and Technology - electroabsorption modulators, electro-absorption modulators on a single InP based chip.

The South Sydney Rabbitohs Rugby League Football Club played at Redfern Oval between 1948 and 1987. publisher=South Sydney Rabbitohs access-date= }} Rabbitoh supporters often refer to Redfern Oval as \\"The Holy Land\\".  Description  The former National Rugby League ground had a main grandstand on the wing with seats on either side and a hill surrounding the rest of the ground with a few rows of seats near the fence. The total capacity of the ground was around the 20,000 mark, until the redevelopment. The current ground has a lone grandstand with bench style seating, with the structure incorporating the Rabbitohs' training equipment/gym, as well as a cafe and basic luxury hospitality. The seating is covered by a large roof spanning the width of the structure. The stand is wheelchair accessible and also contains hearing loop accessibility. The player's tunnel is accessed by a small staircase which is below field level. Around the rest of the ground (which is now all public park, including the field) is three rows of terraced, hill seating. $19 million was spent by the City of Sydney Council to completely upgrade and renovate Redfern Oval which has allowed the Rabbitohs to return to Redfern in 2009 with state-of-the-art training facilities for players and coaches. The upgrade offers the Rabbitohs a professional standard playing surface and facilities to allow the oval to be used as their preferred training ground and for a limited number of pre-season and exhibition matches. Although Redfern Oval is no longer used as a venue for first grade rugby league it is still used as a home ground for Souths in the Jersey Flegg competition, the South Sydney Canterbury Cup team and the local Sydney combined competition. History Redfern Park was designed and constructed during the 1880s as a Victorian pleasure ground with ornamental gardens, cricket pitches, bowling green and a bandstand. In 1903, legendary cricketer Victor Trumper played at the ground and reportedly hit a ball out of the field which went through the second-floor window of the boot factory across the road where a block of apartments now stand. It was not until 1946 that South Sydney made a formal proposal to make Redfern Oval as their permanent home ground. As a result, Redfern Council added spectator seating and a hill at the oval for fans to watch the game. The Rabbitohs use of the oval Premiership matches (1948‚Äì1987) In 1948, the South Sydney Rabbitohs began playing at the ground, as part of their home-ground usage. The first match played at the ground was on 17 April 1948 against arch rivals Eastern Suburbs with the match finishing in a 19-19 draw. Souths played at Redfern until the end of 1987, where they move to the Sydney Football Stadium the following year. In July 1987 Souths played Manly in front of a premiership record crowd of 23,257. The venue's all-time attendance record of 24,219 on 26 March 1967 in a Pre-season Cup double header featuring South Sydney vs St George and Balmain vs Manly- Warringah. After 1987, Redfern was only used in the premiership as South Sydney's training ground. However, it did host the Charity Shield game between the Rabbitohs and St George in 1988, the last time the venue hosted the game between the clubs. Redfern also as hosted two games of the 1995 Tooheys Challenge Cup pre-season competition with a double header on 11 February. In the early game Cronulla defeated the Sydney Tigers 18-10, while the Rabbitohs marked their return to the ground with a 14-19 loss to a new team in the premiership, the Perth based Western Reds. After a break of nine years, Redfern Oval returned as South Sydney's home ground for three games in the 1996 ARL season. Its return match saw the Gold Coast Chargers pip the Rabbitohs 18-16. South Sydney then won their final two premiership games at the ground, defeating the Western Reds 24-18, before accounting for the South Queensland Crushers 48-16 on 14 July 1996 in front of 3,107 fans. In 2005, South Sydney had plans to return to Redfern Oval and redevelop the ground into a 20,000 seat stadium. The proposal was ultimately rejected by Sydney Council and Lord Mayor Clover Moore. Moore claimed that George Piggins option would further reduce the average open space per person in the Redfern-Waterloo area below the current 5.9 square metres per person, which is already under the city average of 6.6. It was ultimately decided by Sydney City Council that Redfern would be converted into a 5000 seater training facility with the possibility of playing interstate NRL teams at the ground. Piggins said of Moore's plan \\"This new plan is consistent with the latte set moving into Redfern. If you are catering for a NRL crowd of 8000, you will go out of business\\". Return to Redfern (2009‚Äìpresent)  Metricon High Performance Centre  On 18 January 2019 South Sydney Rabbitohs announced a partnership with home builder, Metricon, to have naming rights to the Rabbitohs High Performance Centre at Redfern Oval for two years.

Several naturalists proposed species and subspecies in the 19th and 20th centuries, of which the following were recognised as valid subspecies by 2005: * V. z. zibetha is the nominate subspecies and thought to occur from Nepal eastwards to Assam. *Viverra ashtoni described by Robert Swinhoe in 1864 was a skin of an individual that was shot near the upper Min River in China's Fujian Province; occurs in China. *V. z. picta described by Robert Charles Wroughton in 1915 was based on two skins from the vicinity of Hkamti by the upper Chindwin River in Myanmar; occurs from Assam and northern Myanmar to Indochina. *V. z. pruinosa also described by Wroughton in 1915 was a skin of an adult male large Indian civet from Myanmar's Tanintharyi Region; occurs from southern Myanmar to Peninsular Malaysia. *V. z. hainana described by Ying-Xiang Wang and Xu in 1983 from Hainan Island. The validity of Viverra tainguensis described in 1997 by Sokolov, Rozhnov and Pham Chong from T√¢y Nguy√™n in Gia Lai Province in Vietnam has been seriously questioned, and it is now generally considered a synonym of V. zibetha.

Early life Tiang was born to a merchant family in Sakon Nakhon province in the northeast of Thailand. He graduated in science from Chulalongkorn University in 1930 and became a secondary school teacher in Bangkok. He then accepted the position of headmaster at a school in his home province. Tiang was elected to the National Assembly in 1940 and would represent his province until his death. The Free Thai Movement On the morning of December 8, 1941 Japanese forces invaded Thailand at numerous points along the seacoast and from French Indo-China. The Thai army and air force resisted, but were taking heavy casualties against the veteran Japanese units. Prime Minister Phibun panicked and ordered a cease fire the same day. He allowed the Japanese to occupy Bangkok unopposed and to invade British Malaya from southern Thailand. After Singapore fell to the invaders, Phibun went so far as to make a formal alliance with Japan. Tiang and others opposed to the Japanese met with the Regent, Pridi Phanomyong, on the night of December 8 to discuss forming a resistance movement. This would eventually develop into the \\"Seri Thai\\", the Free Thai Movement. Tiang organised the largest Seri Thai guerrilla training operation near his hometown in Sakorn Nakorn, with military support from British Force 136. His British code name was Pluto. Post war and murder Following the war, Tiang served as a cabinet minister in several democratic governments.

The novel features Joe Leaphorn. Pursuing what begins as a routine police call, Leaphorn is nearly killed by the driver of a car. He is then entangled in a tense hostage situation in the caves near the San Juan River. The novel was nominated for the 1979 \\"Best Mystery Novel\\" Edgar Award. It was well- received as \\"a compelling and often chilling book\\". and noted for \\"unselfconsciously drawing on the best of two clashing cultures.\\" Plot summary After talking with Hosteen Tso to learn what will best improve his health, Margaret Cigaret walks away from the hogan on Nokaito Bench to ponder his situation and prepare her advice. She returns to find both Tso and her niece dead. Initial investigation does not find the killer, or any possible motive for this crime. Leaphorn is returning from a Kinaalda ceremony with a man who escaped arrest earlier. A car at very high speed approaches them, and slows seeing the police car‚Äôs flashing lights. Once Leaphorn is outside the car, the driver attempts to kill him with the vehicle, but Leaphorn moves away in time. The man wore gold rimmed glasses, had black hair and had a huge dog in the back seat. Leaphorn talks with Shorty McGinnis, where he meets Theodora Adams, who seeks Benjamin Tso. At the Tso hogan, Leaphorn observes Benjamin saying Catholic mass in the dawn. Later, Leaphorn returns to the Kinaalda to talk with Margaret Cigarette. He saw a name on a light carried by a boy there, which he realized was the name of the pilot of a helicopter lost in a dramatic theft of cash from an armored car in Santa Fe a few years earlier by members of the Buffalo Society, an extremist break-away group from AIM. The next step is a visit to the FBI office in Albuquerque to read the file for that case. He reads about Tull and Hoski, the latter a man of many aliases. While there, Leaphorn realizes that Mrs. Cigarette sat in a different spot than he originally assumed, one that meant the killer of Hosteen Tso and Annie came from the canyon, not the road. When that killer emerges from the canyon again, Father Benjamin and Theodora are the people who will be found in the hogan. Leaphorn drives to the area of the hogan, parking on solid ground, then walking to the hogan. He does not find them there. Rain washed the tracks outside, but he sees large dog paw prints inside the hogan. Leaphorn spends a harrowing 30 hours in the caves of the canyon wall, escaping from the dog or the men who brought the dog. John Tull is one, and the other he knows as Gold Rims, for his eye glasses. He survives the dog, fire set to kill him, dynamite closing a cavern entrance, and long hours in total darkness. He manages to kill the dog, by letting it run over the edge of the upper cliff, though his first attempt to kill the dog lost him his service revolver. Walking through the connected caverns he realizes the caves are a hiding place for the men and they do not know he is still alive. He finds water to drink, realizing it is from Lake Powell. Then he hears voices. A man carries away some boxes from a cache of food, gasoline, a case of dynamite sticks, timers but no blasting caps. Leaphorn takes some food, over thirty hours since he ate. Then he plans his escape route, having found the cave‚Äôs mouth. His flash light and binoculars have been useful all this time. Leaphorn encounters Father Benjamin Tso, arms and legs tied, who mentions his brother, one year older, raised separately ‚Äì Gold Rims to Leaphorn. Gold Rims is part of the Buffalo Society and of the hostage event that Leaphorn heard mentioned on the police radio hours before. The Boy Scout hostages from an event in Canyon de Chelly are present in a caged area, where Theodora Adams is also held. Leaphorn unties Father Tso, who observes that both his brother and Tull are insane. Leaphorn follows Gold Rims and Tull. Leaphorn‚Äôs plan is that Father Tso will distract the next of the kidnappers to enter the cave, so that Leaphorn can take that man down. Waiting for that moment, Leaphorn finds the cave where Standing Medicine had left over thirty sand paintings for a special ceremony, a great gift to his people from over 100 years earlier. When the kidnapper arrives, Father Tso plays his role as he sees it, asking the man to give him the gun; the man shoots before Leaphorn can complete his ambush. Father Tso is dead. So is Jackie Noni, felled by Leaphorn‚Äôs well-aimed projectile. Leaphorn takes the shotgun, unlocks the cage around the hostages, telling them to disappear and tell no one of his presence, while he deals with John Tull. The caves have dynamite on timers, meant to kill the hostages, and the three from the Buffalo Society. But Father Benjamin‚Äôs body could do for his brother‚Äôs in the tally, as no one knows he was in the cave and Hoski / Jimmy Tso wants to leave alone for a new life with his girlfriend. Gold Rims is Hoski; he returns to the cave with the ransom cash and two boats. Tull is about to change a timer to blow up sooner, then two shots are heard and the dynamite kills them both. Leaphorn finds the boats, puts the money sack with the two dead men, and then gets all the hostages onto the boats and in the lake, away from the explosions. He shoots a gasoline can to make a signal fire, which draws an army helicopter. Leaphorn totes up the people killed by Hoski, and the motives for each murder. Theodora Adams asks why Father Tso put himself in fatal danger, which she will have to figure out herself. The gift of Standing Medicine is probably still intact, well protected in the dry cave.

Allusions to real events and persons Standing Medicine, the great grandfather to Hosteen Tso, is said to have died after the Long Walk of the Navajo, an event that occurred in the 1860s. Allusions to Literature When Lt. Leaphorn speaks with FBI agent George Witover, Witover mentions that his colleague John O'Malley spoke well of Leaphorn. This is a reference to the prior novel, Dance Hall of the Dead, where John O'Malley was lead for the FBI involvement of the case; O'Malley considers the case still open, where Leaphorn considers it closed, and is sure that O'Malley has few good feelings about him. Leaphorn and Witover, by contrast, have a more effective collaboration in this novel.

Biography ƒåe≈°ljar was born in 1746 in ƒåurug and died on November 20, 1793, at age 47 in Baƒçko Petrovo Selo (both now in Serbia). It is assumed that he learned to paint from famous masters of Timi»ôoara and Novi Sad, where he lived in 1769. His first known work was a painting of four evangelists on church belfry in Buda in 1776 on which he worked together with colleague painter Mihailo Skokoloviƒá. According to so some older biographers, ƒåe≈°ljar enrolled in Academy of Fine Arts Vienna in 1786. He worked on his first iconostasis in 1789 in the church of Mokrin; after that, he worked in Velika Kikinda and Stara Kanji≈æa in 1791, and in Baƒçko Petrovo Selo from 1792 to 1793, when he died. Alongside this, he drew several icons for the lower church in Sremski Karlovci and iconostasis of Kovilj monastery which was destroyed in 1848. According to quotes from Teodor Iliƒá ƒåe≈°ljar biographies, he was a great colorist and exceptionally inventive in composure. He didn't always paint in the style of baroque. He, as his coeval, leaned to softer and more gentle colors, silky facture glaze painting just like French masters of Rococo. There is no accurate information about all of the portraits painted by Teodor Iliƒá ƒåe≈°ljar, but it is certain that his works include portraits of bishop Pavle Avakumoviƒá (1789), portrait of an unknown priest (National Museum of Serbia), portrait of Josif Jovanoviƒá ≈†akabenta (1787, Museum of Vr≈°ac) and large number of ecclesiastical portraits. On these portraits, ƒåe≈°ljar proved to be a master of drawing and also a subtle and aesthetic colorist as he did with icons. His famous painting of Saint Barbara Anguish (1785) was drawn for Bishop of Nagyv√°rad. It shows his great sense of composition. This canvas is reminiscent of Venetian decorative painters. Two wall paintings in Kikinda show even more intentions for Venetian painting. They are The Last Supper and Christ in Eclat. A street in Kikinda is named after him.

Biography Fyodor Keller was from a family connected to both Austrian and French nobility, and had the title of count. He attended the prestigious Corps of Pages, the military school for the Russian aristocracy. After graduation in 1866, he was commissioned as an ensign in the premier cavalry regiment of the Imperial Russian Army, the Chevalier Guard Regiment. He then attended the Nicholas General Staff Academy and was promoted to captain on his graduation in 1876. The Balkan campaigns Also in 1876, Keller volunteered for service with the Serbian Army during the Serbian-Turkish Wars (1876-1878) and was promoted to the rank of lieutenant colonel and distinguished himself in a number of combat operations. In September of the same year, he became a member of the staff of Major-General Mikhail Chernyayev (nicknamed the 'Russian General Custer'), and was assigned as aide-de-camp to the tsarevich Alexander Alexandrovich (the future Tsar Alexander III) and the Field Marshal Prince Aleksandr Baryatinsky, both of whom were in Serbia serving with the Russian volunteer expeditionary force.Kowner, Historical Dictionary of the Russo- Japanese War, p. 181-182. The forces of Ottoman Empire defeated the Russian- backed Serbians, thus leading to the subsequent Russo-Turkish War, 1877‚Äì1878. During this war, Keller served as the Chief-of-Staff to the Russian-led Bulgarian militia, and later as Chief-of-Staff for Russian Major-General Mikhail Skobelev, where he replaced the wounded Colonel Alexei Kuropatkin. After the war, Keller was promoted to colonel and served in various staff positions. At the conclusion of the war in 1879, he was promoted to colonel and designated an official emissary to Constantinople for the negotiations which determined the borders of the Kingdom of Bulgaria. After his return to Russia, in 1882, Keller received command of the 4th Life Guard Rifle Battalion of the Imperial Guard. He was promoted to Major-General in 1890 and in 1893 he was selected by Tsar Alexander III to serve as the Director of the Corps of Pages. He held this prestigious post until 1900, when, after promotion to Lieutenant-General, he became Governor of Yekaterinoslav. The Russo- Japanese War At the start of the Russo-Japanese War in 1904, Keller volunteered for a combat command, one of the few senior Russian officers to do so. His request was approved and he was placed at the disposal of the Minister of War, General Kuropatkin. Keller initially served as Intelligence Officer on Kuropatkin's staff in Manchuria. After the Russian defeat at the Battle of the Yalu on 1 May 1904, General Kuropatkin decided Keller would replace Lieutenant-General Mikhail Zasulich as commander of the Eastern Detachment of the 2nd Siberian Corps. Keller's leadership skills quickly made a difference in restoring the confidence of the soldiers who had been severely mauled by General Kuroki Tamemoto's 1st Japanese Army. During the next month, the Eastern Detachment marched hundreds of miles, but did little fighting. Motien Pass, a strong defensive position, was abandoned by Keller on 26 May 1904 due to many factors not under his control. Several small operations followed over the next two months, but with limited scope. On 31 July 1904, Keller established a strong defensive position north of Motien Pass to block the Japanese advance on Liaoyang. The Japanese IJA 2nd Division and Guards Divisions attacked all day, but were unable to break the Russian defense. In the late afternoon, the Japanese were surprised to see the Russians withdrawing from their positions. Later that evening, Chinese civilians informed the Japanese that Russian commander, Lieutenant-General Count Keller, had been killed by Japanese artillery fire at about 1400 that day. While Keller lacked experience in the handling large bodies of troops, he was highly respected within the Imperial Russian Army as an aggressive leader; a quality lacking in many Russian senior leaders during the war. His death was compared to the earlier loss of Admiral Stepan Makarov. His grave is at the Keller family estate outside of Moscow.

It was originally published in Galaxy Science Fiction in 1964. It was included in the collection The Best of Cordwainer Smith and most recently in The Rediscovery of Man short story collection. A graphic novel adaptation by Elaine Lee and Michael Kaluta was to have appeared in DC Comics during the late 1980s, but never materialized. Background Cordwainer Smith wrote several stories set in a fictional milieu called the Instrumentality of Mankind. Although humanity achieves a utopian state, people live sterile and shallow lives. The underpeople are animals who have been heavily modified to look human and have human intelligence. Despite this, they have no rights and are treated like animals, to be used and destroyed without qualm. The story takes obvious inspiration from the story of Joan of Arc. There are also points of commonality with the Civil Rights Movement and the early Christians. The story tells how D'Joan becomes a martyr for the underpeople, which leads to the founding of the religion of \\"The Robot, the Rat, and the Copt\\" that stands behind the future vision of love and equality that forms the basis for the end of the novel Norstrilia. It is set at least seven generations before another short story, \\"The Ballad of Lost C'Mell\\". Plot summary The story is set on the planet Fomalhaut III. A therapist named Elaine becomes involved with a group of fugitive underpeople, living in a maze of drab service corridors jokingly dubbed \\"Clown Town\\", who are being helped by Lady Panc Ashash (a personality recording of a deceased Lady of the Instrumentality, hence the eponymous \\"Dead Lady\\") and a telepath called The Hunter. Panc Ashash had predicted Elaine's coming, and how she would help the dog-girl D'joan create history. With help from Elaine and the Hunter, D'joan leads the fugitives from their hiding place in a march into a city. The underpeople go knowingly to their deaths professing their love and asserting that they too are people to the humans they meet along the way. Soldiers eventually arrive and end the revolution by killing all the underpeople, with the sole exception of D'joan. One of the Ladies of the Instrumentally on the scene chooses to put D'joan on trial, remarkable since underpeople did not have any such right. D'joan is sentenced to be burned to death. However, the martyrdom of D'joan and the underpeople affect the human participants and witnesses in powerful, unanticipated ways. The lasting consequences eventually lead to the rebirth of religion, rights for the underpeople, and the Rediscovery of Man. One of those most moved is a Lady of the Instrumentality. She decides to gene code a son to strive for justice for the underpeople. He is an ancestor of Lord Jestocost, who plays a critical role in \\"The Ballad of Lost C'Mell\\" and Norstrilia.

The high school is divided into two schools: * Coatesville Area Intermediate High School (CAIHS, but called the 8/9 Center or simply 8/9) for 8th and 9th graders * Coatesville Area Senior High (CASH) for 10th, 11th and 12th graders Student demographics are reported as follows: White, 57.3%; African American, 32.0%; Latino, 9.0%; Asian/Pacific Islander, 1.5%; Native American, 0.2%. The school was home to NBA Detroit Pistons player Richard \\"Rip\\" Hamilton and NFL Tennessee Titans defensive end Derrick Morgan. History The Coatesville High School was founded in the center of town in what is now the site of the Benner Education Center. In 1940, the high school was relocated to what is now the Scott Middle School. In 1968, the high school was relocated to the current campus just east of the City of Coatesville, into the current CASH building. The current high school campus contains a large amount of land, much of it forested hillside, abutting the nearby Veteran's Hospital. The old stone house that had belonged to the previous owners became part of the district administration and remained on the campus. Several CCIU facilities are located on the high school campus, including the Center for Arts and Technology (CAT), a vocational school for county high schoolers. During the early 1990s, the high school expanded and the CAIHS building was constructed on the site of the former swamp land, and became home to the 9th and 10th grades. CASH remained the home for the 11th and 12th grades, and a new football stadium was constructed on what had been open grass land The original football stadium (Scott Field) is located in the center of Coatesville and is used currently used by other organizations. The CAIHS building (or 9/10 Center) was not designed for the site, but instead used a predesigned building. An artificial hill had to be constructed to accommodate this building layout, and this caused major settlement issues following the building's construction. Most of these problems were resolved by ground and foundation repairs in the early years of the building, however the building continues to be monitored, and several crack gauges can be found all over the building's walls. Until the building was renamed the 9/10 Center in 2002, it was typically referred to by the nickname Chaos, a mispronunciation of the building's actual name, CAIHS, and a reference to the highly rowdy nature of the building, which was often overcrowded. The connotations associated with a high school containing two buildings bearing the common names of Chaos and Cash were a large motivator for the renaming of the buildings into the 9/10 Center and 11/12 Center (a name that has yet to stick). The high school campus is currently undergoing major renovations to both the 9/10 Center building, and CASH. While the 9/10 Center is receiving slight renovations, CASH is being completely renovated with addition wings being added. The renovations are scheduled to be complete this coming school year. Although certain grades are assigned to each of the two buildings, class scheduling, facility location, and necessity creates some student flow between the buildings between classes. Since the 1980s, the district has seen explosive growth, and by the early 2000s the high school had already outgrown its second building, prompting debate over another expansion. The leading choice has long been to create a second high school, most likely on another campus containing the Rainbow Elementary School on the west side of the city, however no decision has so far been made.

He suggested that being a \\"caste-like minority\\" affects motivation and achievement, depressing IQ scores. He also concluded that some students did poorly because high achievement was considered \\"acting white\\" among their peers. Ogbu was also involved in the 1996 controversy surrounding the use of African American Vernacular English in public schools in Oakland, California. The 2000 book Eminent Educators: Studies in Intellectual Influence focused on him as one of \\"four intellectual giants of the 20th century.\\" Early life and education Born in the village of Umudomi, in Onicha Local Government Area, Ebonyi State, Ogbu attended Hope Waddell Training Institute and Methodist Teachers' Training College where he taught Latin, mathematics and geography. He enrolled at Princeton Theological Seminary with the intention to become a minister in Nigeria, but soon transferred to the University of California, Berkeley to study anthropology. At Berkley he earned his baccalaureate in 1965, his master's degree in 1969, and his Ph.D. in 1971. He taught at UC Berkeley from 1970 until his death. Involuntary minorities Ogbu argues Ogbu, John U. \\"Cultural Problems in Minority Education: Their Interpretations and Consequences‚ÄîPart One: Theoretical Background.\\" The Urban Review 27.3 (1995): 189-205. that cultural differences alone cannot account for differences in minority education, since some minority communities do quite well and others do not. In addition, he observes that in some cases groups of people of the same race but located in different countries manifested different ability and/or achievement levels according to some measures. Ogbu points out that there are two kinds of differences between cultures. There are primary differences, which existed before cultures came into contact with each other. Then, there are secondary differences, which come into existence when two cultures interact with each other. He says that many of these secondary differences are created by subordinate groups in opposition to the cultural references of the dominant group. In the U.S. context, Ogbu concluded that among U.S. Americans there are \\"voluntary minorities\\" (groups of immigrants who chose to come to the United States, and their descendants) versus \\"involuntary\\" or \\"caste-like\\" minorities (descendants of groups of persons who found themselves in the United States, or under United States jurisdiction, against their will). Voluntary minorities (e.g. Korean-Americans) tend to manifest non-oppositional secondary differences with the dominant culture. On the other hand, involuntary minorities (e.g. Native Americans) tend to manifest oppositional secondary differences with the dominant culture. However, both voluntary non-oppositional cultural subjects and involuntary oppositional cultural subjects are required to adhere to dominant (white) American cultural frames of reference if they want to acquire upward social mobility. In Minority Education and Caste (1978), Ogbu argued that involuntary minorities often adopted an oppositional identity to the mainstream culture in response to a glass ceiling imposed or maintained by white society on the job- success of their parents and others in their communities. Therefore, he reasoned, some non-whites \\"failed to observe the link between educational achievement and access to jobs.\\" Often, the oppositional culture/identity created by the involuntary minority involves the incorporation of attitudes, behaviors, and speech styles that are stigmatized by the dominant group, which, of course, precludes those who adopt the manifestations of the oppositional culture from external success in the dominant culture. When immigrant minorities (voluntary minorities) acquire the language of the dominant culture, it is seen as an addition to the first language (non- oppositional primary differences). However, when nonimmigrant minorities (involuntary minorities) acquire the language of the dominant culture, it is the negation of their oppositional culture, and thus their cultural reality. Acting white In 1986 Signithia Fordham co-authored, along with Ogbu, a study which concluded that some African American students in a Washington, D.C., high school did not live up to their academic potential because of the fear of being accused of \\"acting white.\\" Ogbu further echoed these findings in his 2003 book Black American Students in an Affluent Suburb: A Study of Academic Disengagement (which summarized his nine-month research on the educational gap between white and African-American students in the Shaker Heights City School District located in the upscale Cleveland suburb of Shaker Heights, Ohio). His book presents a cultural-ecological theory which highlights two sets of factors that shape minority students‚Äô academic performance: 1) the system (the way society and institutions have historically treated and do treat minorities) and 2) community forces (how minorities respond to and interpret their treatment, which is highly dependent upon their unique history and minority status in America). He concluded that these students' cultural attitudes hindered their own academic achievement and that these attitudes are too often neglected by parents, educators and/or policymakers. Though the study's conclusions gained a popular foothold and have been espoused by such noted figures as Bill Cosby, a later study obtained different results. In 2003, Karolyn Tyson, a sociologist, and William Darity Jr, an economist, both at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, directed an 18-month study at eleven North Carolina schools which found that white and black students have essentially the same attitudes about scholastic achievement; students in both groups want to succeed in school and show higher levels of self-esteem when they do better in school. The results of this study have been published in a book by Stanford sociologist Prudence Carter A 2006 study titled An Empirical Analysis of \\"Acting White\\" by Roland G. Fryer, Jr. at Harvard University and Paul Torelli suggested that the phenomenon has a statistically significant effect on black student achievement, but only in certain school contexts. In public schools with high interracial contact and among high achieving students, there was an effect, but there was little or no effect in predominantly black or private schools. African American Vernacular English In 1996, Ogbu played a prominent role in the debate about the utility of African American Vernacular English. As a member of a task force on African American education in Oakland, California he noted that linguists (e.g., William Labov, John Rickford, Walt Wolfram, and others) have long distinguished between the \\"standard\\" or \\"proper\\" English required in the classroom and black vernacular English spoken at home and with peers. Ogbu encouraged teachers to become familiar with and to make use of this variety (called \\"Ebonics\\" by the Oakland Unified School District) in helping speakers of African American Vernacular English acquire Standard American English in addition to their \\"home\\" variety.

Biography Dragi≈°a Stanisavljeviƒá was born in Jabuƒçje, near Lajkovac, on May 25, 1921). He began doing sculpture in 1958. The life in the village under patriarchal principles, century-old forests of his homeland certainly encouraged his impulse for freedom and modelling. He is an absolute self-taught, with strong sense for the stylization of form. A farmer by trade, Stanisavljeviƒá began to do sculpture in wood in 1958.

Krstiƒá, Outsider Art in Serbia, MNMA, –à–∞–≥–æ–¥–∏–Ω–∞, 2014, pp. 132-139 Artistic Style and Work Frontal aspect, simplicity of expression and archaic approach to form are unconsciously achieved. From black, age-old tree-trunks the artist liberated the form, polished it to brightness, imprisoned it and emphasized its organic essence, thus completing what the nature had begun. Everything is stylized nearly to the bare, basic primordial form, and reduced with the pronounced sense for measure, which was known only to authentic artists of primitive cultures. More than five-decade-long instinctive and creative work of this artist points to the force of his authentic and original forms and the connection between primordial and modern sensibility of artistic expression. Age-old oak trunks which he tooled from the bed of the Kolubara River had a secret trace in its very substance, a kind of patina. With a pronounced sense of harmony, without gestures, expressive movements, but with interest in the spiritual background of his figures, Dragi≈°a unconsciously understood the role of form in the achievement of the universal. Relief-like concept of form with pronounced vertical composition helped the artist with the simplicity of expression, especially when the selected motif was philosophical contemplation on human relationships, destinies, hidden characteristics, sins or prayers. His works reflect the mythology, folklore and legends of his native land.

Andrew Lang included it in The Pink Fairy Book (1897).Andrew Lang, The Pink Fairy Book, \\"The Water of Life\\" Synopsis Three brothers and a sister worked very hard, became rich, and built a palace. It was much admired, but an old woman told them it needed a church. They built a church. It was even more admired, but an old man told them it needed a pitcher of the water of life, a branch where the smell of the flowers gave eternal beauty, and the talking bird. The oldest brother decided to set out after it. They asked the old man how they could know he was safe, and the man gave them a knife: as long as it was bright, he was well, but when it was bloody, evil had happened to him. He met with a giant who told him he had to walk past stones that would mock him; if he did not turn, he could gain what he was after, but if he did, he would turn to stone as well. He went to the mountain, but the stones jeered at him so loudly he turned to throw a rock at them, and turned to stone. Warned by the knife that something had happened, his two brothers followed him, and suffered the same fate. Their sister followed, but did not turn. At the top, she found a pool, and the bird perched on a branch of the tree. She took them all, but was tired, and let spill a few drops, which turned the people back to life. She sprinkled the water on all the stones and restored them all to life. At home, she planted the tree and watered it, and it grew, and the bird perched in its boughs. A prince came to see the wonders, and married the sister in the church they had built.

Early life David Keith-Lucas was one of the sons of Alys Hubbard Lucas and Keith Lucas, who invented the first aeronautical compass. After the death of Keith Lucas in 1916, his wife Alys changed the family name, and, as Alys Keith-Lucas, edited a short book giving his background together with reminiscences of him and a list of his publications. David Keith-Lucas was educated at Gresham's School, Holt, and at Gonville and Caius College, Cambridge, where he read engineering. Career David Keith-Lucas was an apprentice and engineer with C.A. Parsons and Co. from 1933 to 1940, then moved to the aerodynamics office of Short Brothers, Rochester, famous for their flying boats, becoming their chief aerodynamicist in 1944. From 1945 to 1965 he was with Short Brothers and Harland Ltd in Belfast, holding the posts of chief designer, technical director and research director. His work included research on swept-wings which culminated in the Short SB-5 research aircraft. Other projects included the Short Belfast heavy freighter, the Short Skyvan, and the SD-330 and SD-360 freight-commuter series. The Short SB.1 was a shoulder-wing, cantilever, tailless monoplane glider designed by David Keith- Lucas and Professor Geoffrey T.R. Hill and built by Shorts as a private research venture to test the concept of the aero-isoclinic wing; it was the first aircraft to incorporate this feature. After initial tests, at the end of which the SB.1 crash-landed as a result of problems while being towed behind the Short Sturgeon, the SB.1 was further developed into the Short SB.4 Sherpa, powered by two Blackburn Turbomeca Palas turbojet engines. In 1951, Keith- Lucas designed the Short SB-6 Seamew as a lightweight anti-submarine platform. While in Belfast, he served on the Senate of the Queen's University, Belfast. In 1965 he was appointed Professor of Aircraft Design at the College of Aeronautics, Cranfield, later the Cranfield Institute of Technology, and welded together the departments of Aerodynamics, Aircraft Design and Flight into a new College of Aeronautics. In 1972, he became its Professor of Aeronautics and also Chairman of the College, which now forms part of Cranfield University. On retirement in 1976, he was appointed Professor Emeritus and awarded an Honorary Doctorate.

She served as a commissioned ship for 4 years and 11 months. Laid down as the merchant ship Executor on 14 March 1940, under a Maritime Commission contract (MC hull 104), at Quincy, Massachusetts, by the Fore River yard of Bethlehem Steel Co.; launched on 21 September 1940; sponsored by Mrs. A.R. Winnett; and delivered to her owners, the American Export Lines, on 22 October 1940. Executor made two voyages to India before being acquired by the Navy on 3 June 1941 for conversion to a cargo ship. Renamed Almaack and classified as AK-27. Converted at the Tietjen and Lang Dry Dock Co., Hoboken, N.J., Almaack was commissioned at the Army Transport Service Base, Brooklyn, on 15 June 1941, Comdr. Thomas R. Cooley in command.  Early World War II North Atlantic convoy operations  Almaack‚Äîwith a cargo of heavy roadbuilding equipment and coal‚Äîcleared New York in convoy on 27 July 1941, bound for Iceland. Screened by a battleship, three heavy cruisers, and seven destroyers, the convoy included Almaack, a transport, a storeship and an oiler, and the aircraft carrier ‚Äîthe latter with planes of the 33d Pursuit Squadron (Curtiss P-40s) on board, earmarked for the defense of the base in Iceland. The convoy reached Reykjav√≠k on 6 August, with Wasp launching the planes without incident. Almaack discharged her cargo at Reykjav√≠k over the ensuing days, and departed that port on 12 August. After loading at New York, Almaack proceeded to Trinidad, arriving there, via San Juan, Puerto Rico, on 20 September 1941. Returning thence to New York, the cargo ship sailed independently for Halifax, Nova Scotia, there joining convoy HX 154 for her second run to Iceland. On 13 November 1941, Almaack, together with the storeship , an Iceland-registry freighter, and five American destroyers, cleared Iceland for a rendezvous with west-bound convoy ON 35 south of Iceland. Within 24 hours of sailing, one of the escorts, , picked up a definite sound contact and attacked, dropping depth charges. Over the next 36 hours, the ships marched and countermarched through rough seas, awaiting the tardy convoy which ultimately arrived on the morning of 15 November.  Difficulty in maintaining position in convoy  As Comdr. Cooley later reported, Almaack, \\"being light and big, was unable to maintain position in the convoy at speeds less than .\\" The heavy weather wrought havoc on the abilities of the ships to stay in formation, and Almaack found herself on her own on three occasions, each time managing to rejoin the convoy. Upon rejoining for the third time, Comdr. Cooley informed the escort commander \\"what speed he would make and what positions he would pass through if separated again.\\" When this came to pass, and the cargo ship was again on her own, Almaack proceeded independently to New York without incident. Reflecting back on the voyage, on 6 December 1941, Almaack's commanding officer opined that his ship would have been far safer \\"steaming alone . . . than in any convoy that does not maintain a speed of at least .\\" He also used that occasion to press for his ship to be armed with at least two 4-inch or guns. In endorsing Comdr. Cooley's report on 19 December, Admiral Ernest J. King, Commander in Chief, United States Atlantic Fleet, agreed to recommend independent routing for fast cargo ships such as Almaack unless \\"available information indicates undue danger from submarine concentration . . . .\\"  Preparations for war  Almaack then proceeded to Norfolk, where she underwent an overhaul at the Norfolk Navy Yard. During this refit, she was armed with a gun, four guns and eight .50-caliber machine guns. She also received a new paint job, Measure 12 (mod.) designed to alter her silouhette. She then loaded cargo, and sailed for Bermuda, returning thence to New York.  World War II North Atlantic convoy operations  Loaded with a cargo of heavy construction equipment, Almaack sailed from New York on 19 January 1942, as an element of Convoy AT 12: 13 ships carrying 14,688 men‚Äîof this number 8,493 were Army troops being transported to Belfast, Northern Ireland, and 1,153 were sailors to man the new naval operating base being established at Derry. Other transports in the host were to take Army troops to Iceland to relieve the marines that had been there since July 1941. Almaack then returned to the United States in ballast, and, after again loading at New York, sailed for the Pacific on 9 April 1942.  Pacific Theatre operations  Transiting the Panama Canal for the first time on 19 April 1942, Almaack sailed for the Tonga, or Friendly Islands, arriving at Tongatapu on 8 May. Discharging cargo there, the ship then sailed for the West Coast of the United States, arriving ultimately at San Diego on 5 June. Assigned to Transport Division 2 with Amphibious Forces, Pacific Fleet, Almaack underwent repairs and alterations at the Craig Shipbuilding Co. at Long Beach, before she returned to San Diego on 15 July for landing exercises off the southern California coast.  Supporting the invasion of North Africa  Returning to the East Coast of the United States and arriving at Norfolk on 12 September, Almaack underwent further alterations and repairs before proceeding to New York to load cargo. She sailed on 26 September for Scotland in TF 38. There, at Loch Fyne, the cargo ship participated in training for the invasion of North Africa until 21 October. Five days later, Almaack sailed for her first amphibious operation. The voyage toward the coast of North Africa proved uneventful until 7 November 1942. Almaack‚Äîin column 01 of convoy KMFA1‚Äîwent to general quarters at 0515, and soon thereafter heard an aircraft close by, on her port hand. At 0538, her watch noted the torpedoing of the nearby transport . Ultimately, at 1800 the section of KMFA1 to which Almaack had been attached was directed to proceed to the waters off Algiers. As she stood toward the coast, she observed navigation lights‚Äîstill burning but with reduced visibility‚Äîat Cape Matifu and Cape Caxine. Reaching her release position at 2200, Almaack commenced lowering boats at that time, and completed the evolution in a little over an hour, at 2307. At 0145 on Sunday, 8 November 1942, the ship's boats began making their way shoreward, from about eight miles (13 km) off the beachhead. At 0208, all ships in \\"Charlie\\" sector stood shoreward to a position two miles (3 km) off \\"Charlie-Red\\" beach, where they would ultimately anchor several hours later. In the interim, Almaack's first boat returned from the beach at 0304, shortly before the ship reached her position.  Under fire from enemy beach batteries  About 0346, Almaack observed gunfire starting in the vicinity of the city of Algiers; action continued intermittently until dawn. Anchoring off Beach Red at 0904, Almaack ceased cargo operations at 1015, \\"evidently because of excessive congestion of boats\\" at beach Charlie Red Two. Within the hour, however, the ship resumed unloading, but only vehicles and guns, as directed. As she did so, she observed three German Junkers Ju 88 bombers pass overhead at ‚Äîevidently looking for bigger game or possessing empty racks, since they dropped no bombs. Working to get high priority vehicles and antiaircraft guns unloaded, Almaack soon found the wind and sea making operations difficult. A strong breeze from the northeast rendered the operation of small boats hazardous by 1400, but the unloading continued in the face of mounting difficulties. By 1645, however, after the ship had managed to put ashore some 52 vehicles and guns during the day, \\"loading became impossible\\" in the teeth of a fresh to strong breeze and a rough sea.  Under attack by German aircraft  Almaack sighted three more Ju 88s at shortly after sunset, and went to general quarters, opening fire with her antiaircraft battery soon thereafter as the three Junkers' dive-bombed the nearby Samuel Chase. Following the dive bombers, other enemy planes, identified as Heinkel He 111s, attacked the disposition in the twilight, varying their manner of attack with shallow dives and low-level horizontal attacks from all directions, cleverly utilizing a land background to cover their approach. Almaack's lookouts noted bombs or torpedoes dead ahead and on the starboard bow, and witnessed the torpedoing of around 1715. Almaack ceased fire at 1735, and stood down from general quarters at 1801. At 2020, the ship secured her cargo-handling details because of the wind and sea conditions, with six of her boats secured to the stern‚Äîa condition that soon changed with worsening weather; two boats swamped, and the remainder were sent ashore. All night the wind continued to blow, and Almaack's coxswains put their landing craft on the beach. The following day saw more attacks from German aircraft; Almaack went to general quarters twice before dawn, once during the mid watch, once during the morning watch. She went to general quarters again five more times before the day ended: once during the forenoon watch, thrice during the afternoon watch, and once during the first dog watch. She seemed to bear a charmed life; while her guns were busy adding to the general curtain of fire to repel the attacks of German planes (principally Ju 88s), ships nearby came under attack. Bombs apparently aimed at Almaack struck a British antiaircraft cruiser some astern. Underway late that afternoon, standing toward the port of Algiers, Almaack eventually anchored at 1721; the last attack for the day ended some 40 minutes later, with nightfall. Underway at 0530 on 10 November, the cargo ship stood in to Algiers harbor and secured to a berth at the Mole Louis Billiard shortly before the commencement of the forenoon watch. Completing cargo operations early the following afternoon (11 November), Almaack cleared the mole and anchored in Algiers Bay, having completed her part in Operation \\"Torch.\\" On 12 November, Almaack departed Algiers, and soon thereafter rendezvoused with the nine transports and five escort vessels of Convoy MKFl(y) at Gibraltar. Bound for the British Isles on the morning of 15 November, Almaack, shortly before 0315, noticed escort vessels on her port beam firing' machine guns; almost simultaneously the convoy commodore called for an immediate right turn.  Struck by a torpedo  Almaack had just completed the turn and steadied on her new course when she was struck by a torpedo launched from . Kapitanleutnant Adolf Piening's marksmanship proved deadly. About the same time, torpedoes from his U-boat struck the freighter Ettrick (she later sank at 0836 that morning) and the escort carrier ; the latter blew up, taking with her almost all of her complement. Almaack went to general quarters; a quick investigation of the damage revealed the engine and fire rooms, as well as hold number five and the shaft alley, flooded. Fortunately, the strength of the bulkheads contained the flooding and the ship remained afloat, although in a dangerous state. Four engineers on duty were lost : Gerald Keith Brown, F3c, of Atlantic, Iowa; Herbert Jess Kramer MM2cm, of Philadelphia; Frank Aloyousis Keefe Jr., F1c, of Philadelphia; and Dominick Virgilio, F2c, of Lansdale, Pennsylvania. ; and four more were badly burned in the explosion in the engine room.  Towed to Gibraltar for repairs  Daybreak revealed , an escort vessel, standing by the sinking Ettrick, picking up survivors. Almaack arranged for Glaisdale to take on board some of her men, and transferred 8 officers and 185 men to the escort ship; 12 officers and 112 men remained on board to handle the ship and man the guns. HMS Brilliant arrived at 1540 to provide antisubmarine protection, and at 1340 the following day a British tug, Jaunty, accompanied by two trawlers, arrived to take the damaged cargo ship‚Äîat that point some eight miles (13 km) from the coast of Portugal‚Äî in tow, ultimately arriving at Gibraltar at 2300 on 17 November 1942. Drydocked on 3 December at Gibraltar, Almaack was then placed on a waiting list for temporary repairs to enable her to return to the United States. While she lay in limbo at the British Crown Colony, she was reclassified to an attack cargo ship, AKA-10, on 31 January 1943. Placed in drydock again on 3 March 1943, Almaack remained there until the last day of March; towed thence to Casablanca, French Morocco, the cargo ship began her long voyage home, astern of the fleet tug , on 3 May.  Stateside repairs  Over the next several months, Almaack underwent repairs and alterations at Norfolk Navy Yard; during this time she was repainted overall Measure 11, Sea Blue, and received new masts to handle the brood of landing craft assigned the ship. She also received new men; among them Ens. Wilmer H. Cressman, USNR, the father of one of the principal writers of this Dictionary volume. Following trials, Almaack shifted down the East Coast to Jacksonville, Florida, where she loaded a cargo of Florida orange juice. She steamed to the West Coast, discharging her cargo at San Pedro, and then proceeded to San Diego, whence she conducted amphibious training exercises, chiefly at Oceanside and Coronado, into January 1944.  Return to Pacific Theatre operations  Almaack sailed from San Diego on the morning of 13 January 1944, bound for Lahaina Roads, off the island of Maui. From there, she sailed for the Marshall Islands, and the first of her six amphibious operations of the Pacific war, departing Lahaina‚Äîthe final staging area for Operation \\"Flintlock\\"‚Äîon the afternoon of 22 January, with elements of the 4th Marine Division embarked. Sailing as part of Task Force (TF) 53, Almaack reached the transport area for the initial assault on \\"Jacob\\" and \\"Ivan\\"‚Äî islands in Kwajalein Atoll‚Äîat 0500 on 31 January. That evening, Almaack hoisted out her boats and discharged cargoes of ammunition in response to a request for three units of fire to \\"Ivan\\". Using her engines constantly to maintain position in the transport area against the two-knot northeasterly current and the northeast trade winds, Almaack provided LCMs to unload artillery from attack transports and LCVPs to unload men early on 1 February, and upon anchoring later that day received the services of two tank landing craft (LCT) to expedite unloading her own cargo. This unloading slowed down on the 2d, but picked up again on the 3d, the ship being aided in her cargo discharging by boats from , and . Ultimately, by 1330 on D + 4 (4 February), Almaack had completed her unloading. Two days later, on 6 February, having loaded 22 LVTs of the 4th Tractor Battalion, USMC, and embarked their crews, Almaack sailed for Funafuti, in the Ellice Islands, in convoy with an amphibious command ship, three dock landing ships, a transport and a cargo ship, screened by four destroyers; she arrived at her destination on 10 February. From there, she sailed to Guadalcanal, in the Solomons, again in convoy, and reached her destination on the afternoon of 13 February. There the ship unloaded the marine amphibious tractors brought down from Kwajalein, and disembarked their crews. Proceeding thence to Noum√©a, New Caledonia, for liberty, as well as firing and landing exercises, Almaack returned to Guadalcanal (Tulagi), and then to Funafuti, before she pushed on for Canton Island, and a stopover there to load \\"worn-out equipment\\" en route back to Hawaii.  Exchanging cargoes at Pearl Harbor  Arriving at Honolulu on 10 April 1944, Almaack unloaded the cargo she had brought from Canton and then moved up to Pearl Harbor, where she underwent repairs and alterations and loaded 300 tons of 6-inch cruiser ammunition. She departed \\"Pearl\\" on 1 May for Maui, arriving later the same day, and there loaded combat equipment for elements of the 4th Marine Division earmarked for the invasion of Saipan, in the Marianas. Proceeding back to Pearl Harbor after loading, Almaack then sailed for Lahaina, where she and the other ships slated to take part in the next major amphibious operation conducted rehearsals for it. Returning thence to Honolulu on the morning of 20 May, the ship remained there until the 29th, when she sailed as part of TG 52.15 for the Marshalls, the staging area for the Marianas.  Hit by an enemy shell during Saipan invasion  Almaack arrived in the transport area off Saipan at 0535 on D-day, 15 June 1944, and had all of her tank lighters in the water in 19 minutes; expeditiously loading the eight M-4 \\"Sherman\\" tanks into her seven lighters and one provided by Sumter, the LCM-3s were on their way shoreward by 0711. During the day, an enemy shell (a mortar shell from Saipan or an artillery shell from Tinian), struck Almaack's number three LCM-3, killing one man outright‚ÄîSeaman 2d Class Bernard V. Camerlinck, Sr., USNR of Independence, Missouri{fact}‚Äîand wounding three other men, as well as three marines of the tank crew. Although nearly demolished, the LCM-3 put its cargo ashore safely. Almaack retired seaward that night, returning the next day to commence working her cargo, but limited beach space for unloading and the danger of enemy air attacks resulted in the ship's retiring until 21 June (D + 6), when she could resume the unloading task. Ultimately, the task aided immeasurably by the embarked two platoons of the Army's 311th Port Company, Almaack completed working her cargo by the 24th, unloading the ship in 79 hours. She then sailed to Eniwetok, and thence to Honolulu, independently, arriving there on 5 July 1944. Taking on board combat equipment of the Army's 77th Division (designated as the reserve for the assault on Guam) the attack cargo ship cleared Honolulu on 9 July for Eniwetok, arriving there on the 17th. There becoming a unit of TG 53.19, Almaack sailed for Guam, arriving on the morning of 22 July, W +1 day. She landed neither troops nor cargo the first day, retiring to seaward early that evening.  Supporting the invasion of Guam  For six days, from W + 2 to W + 8, Almaack supported the invasion of Guam; the first three days she retired at night after conducting unloading operations during the day, returning the following morning to the transport area to resume working her cargo. On the 14th, the attack cargo ship fueled the fast minesweeper . The wind blew the two ships toward the fire support area where shells from the nearby battleship whistled overhead. Finally, after anchoring in a berth off the invasion beaches of W + 5 (27 July), Almaack commenced working her cargo again, aided immeasurably by two tank landing ships and a tank landing craft assigned to her for that purpose, LST-731, LCT-962 and LST-986. After debarking 16 Army officers and 306 soldiers on 29 July, Almaack sailed for Eniwetok in company with the attack transport . She proceeded thence to Pearl Harbor, arriving there on 23 August. The next day, she entered drydock to have her hull sand- blasted and painted. Following that repair period at Pearl, Almaack loaded troops, equipment, and supplies of the Army's 96th Infantry Division, slated to take part in the planned invasion of the island of Yap, in the Carolines. After expeditiously completing the cargo loading and embarkation, the attack cargo ship sailed on 1 September for Maui, and from 2 to 6 September conducted exercises there until returning to Pearl Harbor on the 7th to complete preparations for her next operation. On 15 September, Almaack departed Hawaiian waters for the staging point, Eniwetok. One day out, however, the ship received a message indicating the planned invasion of Yap had been cancelled; a later message gave the ultimate destination as the island of Leyte, in the Philippines.  Preparations for the invasion of the Philippines  Reaching Eniwetok on 25 September for replenishment, Almaack took on fuel and supplies there and pushed on for Manus, in the Admiralties, reaching that place‚Äîthe staging area for the assault on Leyte‚Äîon 3 October. Now assigned to the 7th Fleet for the Leyte operation, Almaack remained at Seeadler Harbor, Manus, from 3 to 13 October, provisioning, fueling, and exercising troops. On the latter date, the ship transferred three wave guide officers, 21 men and six LCVPs to various tank landing ships for the operation, receiving in their place six boat officers, 36 men and six LCSs, for transportation to Leyte. Almaack entered Surigao Strait, en route to Leyte Gulf, early on the morning of 20 October 1944, going to general quarters soon thereafter, anchoring in transport area number two, five miles (8 km) east of San Jose, Leyte, at 0841, having hoisted out her embarked landing craft. Soon after she anchored, Almaack‚Äîassigned the task of unloading 13 light tanks in the seventh wave of Orange Beach 2‚Äîcommenced working her priority cargo, sending her first wave toward the line of departure at 0940 and the second, five minutes later, having unloaded her baker's dozen tanks into her own LCMs, augmented by six from four other amphibious ships. An hour later, the ship commenced unloading cargo. Late that morning, the ship's no. 13 LCVP took a direct hit, damaging it beyond repair and wounding one man. Later that afternoon, Almaack got underway for transport area number three, and went to general quarters within a half-hour of her getting underway; en route she witnessed the torpedoing of the light cruiser . Over the next two days, frequently blanketed by an almost impenetrable smoke screen to shield the ship from Japanese air attacks, Almaack worked her cargo. On 21 October, Almaack thrice went to general quarters in the course of the day, and fueled two ships, the fast transport and the fast minesweeper , in addition to continuing her unloading cargo. On the day following, A + 2, she again conducted cargo operations, and provided fuel and stores to the landing craft, LCI-472, in addition to disembarking the last of her embarked troops. All boats on board by 1753 on 22 October, Almaack sailed for Hollandia, Dutch New Guinea.  Commendation for efficient performance at Leyte  Her performance at Leyte earned her favorable comments: Rear Admiral Forrest B. Royal, commanding Group 6 of the Pacific Fleet Amphibious Forces, called Almaacks performance of duty \\"excellent\\" and her unloading carried out in \\"an outstanding manner.\\" Commander, 3d Amphibious Force, Vice Admiral Theodore S. Wilkinson, considered Almaacks unloading ‚Äî an overall average of 72 tons of cargo per hour, and maintaining an average of 105 tons per hour for one nine-hour stretch ‚Äî as \\"outstanding and in close accord with estimates made during planning.\\" Arriving at Hollandia on 27 October, Almaack departed that place on 2 November, being routed to Morotai and arriving there after daylight on the 5th. She commenced loading cargo ‚Äî 163 vehicles, 169 drums of gasoline, and equipment of the Army's XI Corps Headquarters units and of the Army Air Force's 310th Bombardment Wing. Japanese air raids, executed in nearly clockwork fashion, made the ship's stay at Morotai memorable. Almaack went to general quarters 13 times as a result of enemy aircraft in the vicinity. On one occasion, Almaack contributed eight rounds of 5-inch and four of 3-inch to a barrage. During her stay at Morotai, she also fueled six destroyers.  Under attack by Japanese fighter bombers  The attack cargo ship sailed on her second trip to Leyte on 10 November, and proceeded in company with two transport divisions, the 8th and 24th. One day out of their destination, the transports were attacked by Japanese torpedo planes (\\"Jills\\"), one of which closed to visual range of Almaack. This \\"Jill\\" launched her torpedo at , the last ship in the left flank column and directly astern of Almaack. The latter's 3-inch and 5-inch batteries took the Japanese plane under fire at ; her 20-millimeter guns opened up at 800. Almaack's automatic weapons scored hits on the right wing and tail of the \\"Jill\\"; shedding parts, the enemy aircraft went out of control about from Catskill, passed slightly astern of her, and then plunged into the sea, leaving no survivors. In the meantime, Catskill maneuvered and evaded the torpedo. Almaack suffered three men very slightly wounded during the brief engagement, nicked by fragments of \\"friendly\\" 20-millimeter projectiles which hit a ship's guy wire. Entering Surigao Strait at 0036 on 14 November, Almaack went to general quarters at 0600 and entered the transport area a little under an hour later, sending her seven LCMs to assist the other ships in the group to complete their unloading by nightfall. Four LCTs and one LSM carried Almaack's cargo, and in return the attack cargo ship provided provisions, clothing and small stores to these and an LCT that had been unsuccessful in securing provisions from the ships for which she had worked. Having completed her unloading by 0900 on the following day, Almaack returned to Hollandia, arriving on the 19th. Underway again on the 26th, the attack cargo ship sailed for the Solomons, and reached Empress Augusta Bay on 30 November, commencing loading cargo‚Äîvehicles, ammunition, petroleum products, engineering supplies and signal equipment‚Äîimmediately. She completed the task by 4 December. Almaack, assigned to TG 79.1 and carrying elements and equipment of the Army's 37th Infantry Division, cleared Empress Augusta Bay for Lae, New Guinea, where the ship participated in landing exercises. Back at Manus, in the Admiralties, on 21 December, Almaack spent Christmas there. Then, on the last day of 1944, the attack cargo ship stood out of Seeadler Harbor for her third trip to the Philippines; this time, \\"Mack\\" was bound for Lingayen Gulf.  Under continued air attack  On S-3 day (6 January 1945), the convoy to which Almaack was attached, steaming through the Mindanao Sea, encountered its first enemy aircraft, a Japanese reconnaissance plane which was being hotly pursued by four F4U Corsairs. The \\"Corsairs\\" splashed the enemy about off Almaack's port beam. Almaack had a close call as the convoy neared its objective on S-1 day (8 January), when two \\"Betties\\" (Mitsubishi G4M Type 1 land attack plane) made a glide-bombing run on the ship, straddling her with three bombs released at . The enemy ordnance missed by , and inflicted no damage. The air action intensified as Almaack stood up the coast of Luzon; at 1818, she saw combat air patrol (CAP) planes knock down four \\"Vals\\" (Aichi D3A Type 99 carrier dive bombers). Later that afternoon, after the ship had gone to general quarters for the second time that day, Almaack witnessed a Japanese suicide plane making a dive on an escort carrier (CVE) eight miles (13 km) off the cargo ship's port bow. The ship under attack proved to be , which was crashed by an \\"Oscar\\" (Nakajima Ki-43 fighter) at 1857. Minutes later, another suicider appeared; Almaack opened fire with all port guns as the enemy plane‚Äîidentified as either a \\"Judy\\" (Yokosuka D4Y carrier attack plane) or \\"Val\\"‚Äîseemed bent on crashing the next ship astern in the formation. Gunfire from the ships, however, splashed the kamikaze off the port bow. On S-day, 9 January 1945, Almaack went to general quarters twice during the 0400-0800 watch before executing her deployment for the approach disposition and hoisting her boats to the rail. Lowering her landing craft within a half-hour, Almaack anchored in transport area \\"C\\", Lingayen Gulf, and at 0745 sighted three Japanese planes in the vicinity, one of which crashed the nearby light cruiser . Before the day was over, Almaack's men would see two more victims of the relentless Japanese aerial attacks, the battleship and the Australian heavy cruiser HMAS Australia (D84), both crashed by Japanese suiciders. In the meantime, Almaack commenced working her cargo at 0825 after she had opened her hatches and sent boats allocated to other ships for the assault phase. She commenced her initial unloading of equipment from the Army's 148th Regimental Combat Team (RCT) at 0825, shortly after her beach party shoved off to take up its position ashore. Shifting to transport area \\"M\\" two hours later to continue to work cargo, LCT-1070 came alongside to assist the ship in the cargo-handling evolution. She continued working cargo for the remainder of the day, going to general quarters twice more before the day was out. Early the following day, Almaack took alongside at 0210 and commenced fueling her at 0225, before she logged in evidence of further Japanese activity to attempt to disrupt the landings: LST-925 reported being attacked by an enemy torpedo boat; was attacked by the same type of craft, and the transport suffered damage from a Japanese suicide motor boat. Soon after these occurrences, at 0457, Almaack extinguished lights in her cargo holds and ceased cargo operations and boat movements. Barton cast off at 0640, a half-hour after she completed fueling. For the remainder of S+1, Almaack worked her cargo, unloading it to a barge and LCT-719, before she took on board her boats at 1635 preparatory to retiring from the area, getting underway for an anchorage off San Fabian. Her orders were changed, however, and she put back into Transport Area \\"M\\", where she had been before. Later, she resumed cargo operations in her number one hold, while a picket boat watch, as well as armed deck sentries, kept a lookout for potential Japanese suicide swimmers. The following day, Almaack continued unloading cargo, and, when the occasion demanded, supplied fresh water and provisions to LCI‚Äî1020, supplies and water to LCI-451, her stream anchor to LSM-137 to replace the one the landing ship had lost; provided gasoline and stores to LC1-567. She transferred cargo to LSM-31 during the course of the afternoon. The next day, S + 3, Almaack provided fresh water to the motor minesweeper YMS-319; water and supplies to LCI-975, and LCI-373; water to LC1-751; gas and fog oil to LC 1-567; stores and gas to LCI-462. Having completed unloading the last of her six holds at 1441 on S + 3 day, Almaack hoisted on board her boats and stood out of Lingayen Gulf at 1710, her part in the invasion completed. The first morning out, the convoy was attacked by suicide planes; one crashed the lead ship, the attack transport . From 15 to 19 January 1945, Almaack lay anchored in Leyte Gulf, before she pushed on for the Western Carolines, reaching Ulithi on 23 January. She remained there until 6 February, when she sailed for Guam to load elements of the 3d Marine Division, in preparation for what would prove to be the last amphibious operation for Almaack in the war‚Äîthe assault on Iwo Jima.  Supporting the invasion of Iwo Jima  Arriving at Guam on 8 February, Almaack commenced loading troops and cargo of the 3d Engineer Battalion, 3d Pioneer Battalion, and a replacement company, as well as vehicles, ammunition, petroleum products, rations, and water that same afternoon, bringing the operation to a completion on the following morning. She sailed for Iwo Jima on the morning of 17 February. Almaack arrived in the maneuvering area southeast of Iwo Jima at 2200, 19 February, and, in company with the other ships in the task group, awaited orders. Sent in to the transport areas, the ship arrived off Iwo on 22 February, but did not unload any cargo that day or the next. Each evening during those days, the ship would retire to seaward. Due to the congested beaches, Almaack's loading was delayed until the 24th; that morning the ship put all of her boats in the water to dispatched to attack transports to disembark assault troops. Almaack unloaded her cargo \\"on call\\" as the situation ashore demanded it, from 24 February 1945 to 3 March. On 1 March, the ship took on board shell cases from cruisers and destroyers. She put her last priority cargo item, one vehicle, on board LSM-238 late on the 3d. The attack cargo ship remained in the transport area during the night of 3 March, and retired the following night, arriving back in the transport area on the morning of the 5th. She unloaded all of the remaining vehicles and \\"B\\" rations and took on board more shell cases from cruisers and destroyers on the 6th before departing that same day (6 March) for Guam. Almaack reached Garapan anchorage, Saipan, on the morning of 9 March, and there debarked casualties brought from Iwo; she pushed on for Apra Harbor, Guam, on the late afternoon of the following day, and reached her destination on the morning of 11 March to unload marine supplies not required at Iwo Jima. Sailing thence the following morning for the Solomons, Almaack reached Tulagi on the afternoon of the 18th, where she picked up new landing boats. Proceeding thence to Noum√©a, the attack cargo ship arrived there on the 23d for liberty, repairs, and to embark elements of the Army's 81st Infantry Division. Shifted from a combat load to a regular cargo load, Almaack sailed for the Admiralties on the morning of 3 May, and thence to the Philippines, reaching Leyte on the 16th. There the 81st Infantry Division units went ashore, and after ten days in the Philippines, Almaack sailed for Pearl Harbor on the morning of 26 May. Stopping at Pearl only briefly, the attack cargo ship sailed for San Francisco on the afternoon of 7 June, arriving on the 13th.  End-of-war operations  Following repairs and alterations at the AmShip Co., of Alameda, California, Almaack took on supplies at the naval supply depot, completing loading on 21 August‚Äîone week after Japan accepted the terms of the Potsdam Declaration and agreed to surrender. Receiving word cancelling all blackout restrictions on 6 September while en route to the Philippines, Almaack reached Samar on 10 September. After discharging a small portion of her cargo there, she sailed to Subic Bay, arriving on the 26th. From the Philippines she sailed thence to Japan, reaching Nagoya on 28 October to embark men of the Army's 11th Replacement Depot, and sailed for Portland, Oregon, on 14 November.  Return to Stateside  Discharging her passengers there on the 24th, Almaack shifted down the coast to Albany, California, where she loaded a cargo of petroleum products; she sailed for China on 18 December 1945, and arrived at the North Chinese port of Tientsin on 21 January 1946. She sailed from there on 30 January with Army and Navy passengers embarked, ultimately arriving at Seattle.  Post-war decommissioning  Ordered to New York to report to the Commandant, 3d Naval District, for disposition, Almaack reported on 10 May 1946, and was decommissioned at Brooklyn on 23 May 1946. Regarded as not essential to the defense of the United States, Almaack was struck from the Naval Vessel Register on 15 August 1946, removed from naval custody on 12 September 1946, and transferred to the War Shipping Administration.  Awards  Almaack was awarded six battle stars for her World War II service.

The game has received negative coverage, especially during the game's early years in the early 1980s. Because the term D&D; may be mistakenly used to refer to all types of role-playing games, some controversies regarding D&D; actually pertain to role-playing games in general, or to the literary genre of fantasy. Part of the controversies concern the game and its alleged impact on those who play it, while others concern business issues at the game's original publisher, TSR. The game is now owned by Wizards of the Coast. Moral panic In Dark Dungeons by Jack T. Chick, a girl gets involved in wicca through the \\"occult training\\" she receives while playing Dungeons & Dragons (D&D;). Later she converts to Christianity and rejects the game, burning the materials and avoiding Hell, which is explicitly stated as the destination of all D&D; players. At various times in its history, Dungeons & Dragons (D&D;) has received negative publicity for alleged or perceived promotion of such practices as Satanism, witchcraft, suicide, pornography, and murder. Especially during the 1980s, certain religious groups accused the game of encouraging sorcery and the veneration of demons. Throughout the history of role-playing games, many of these criticisms have not been aimed specifically at D&D;, but touch on the genre of fantasy role-playing games as a whole. The concept of Dungeons & Dragons as Satanic was linked to the concept of Satanic ritual abuse, in that both presumed the existence of large, organized Satanic cults and societies. Sources such as the Dark Dungeons tract from Chick Publications portray D&D; as a recruitment tool for these organizations. Mazes and Monsters As the role-playing game hobby began to grow, it was connected to the story in 1979 of the disappearance of 16-year-old James Dallas Egbert III. Egbert had attempted suicide in the utility tunnels beneath the campus of Michigan State University. After this unsuccessful attempt, he hid at a friend's house for approximately a month. A well-publicized search for Egbert began, and his parents hired private investigator William Dear to seek out their son. Dear discovered that Egbert played Dungeons & Dragons and also heard rumours that students went into the steam tunnels to play a live action version of the game. Dear knew little of the game at that time, and speculated to the press that Egbert had gotten lost in the steam tunnels during one such session. The press largely reported the story as fact, which served as the kernel of a persistent rumor regarding such \\"steam tunnel incidents\\". Egbert's suicide attempts, including his suicide completion the following year (by self- inflicted gunshot) had no connection whatsoever to D&D; they resulted from clinical depression and great stress. Timothy Kask, a Dungeons & Dragons developer, noted that \\"sales of D&D; manuals only really took off in the wake of the Egbert case, nearly quadrupling sales of the game manuals. Gary Gygax and his partners went from earning 2.3 million dollars in 1979, to 8.7 million by the end of 1980\\". Rona Jaffe published Mazes and Monsters in 1981, a thinly disguised fictionalization of the press exaggerations of the Egbert case. In an era when very few people understood role-playing games it seemed plausible to some elements of the public that a player might experience a psychotic episode and lose touch with reality during role-playing. The book was adapted into a made-for-television movie in 1982 starring Tom Hanks, and the publicity surrounding both the novel and film heightened the public's unease regarding role-playing games. In 1983, the Canadian film Skullduggery depicted a role- playing game similar to D&D; as tool of the devil to transform a young man into a serial killer. Dear revealed the truth of the incident in his 1984 book The Dungeon Master, in which he repudiated the link between D&D; and Egbert's disappearance. Dear acknowledged that Egbert's domineering mother had more to do with his problems than his interest in role-playing games. Neal Stephenson's 1984 novel satirizing university life, The Big U, includes a series of similar incidents in which a live-action fantasy role-player dies in a steam tunnel accident, leading to another gamer becoming mentally unstable and unable to distinguish reality from the game. Patricia Pulling Patricia Pulling was an anti-occult campaigner from Richmond, Virginia and the founder of Bothered About Dungeons & Dragons (BADD). This one-person advocacy group was dedicated to the elimination of Dungeons & Dragons and other such games. Pulling founded BADD in 1982 after her son Irving committed suicide; she continued her advocacy until her death in 1997. As her son had played D&D;, she filed a wrongful death lawsuit against her son's high school principal, holding him responsible for what she claimed was a D&D; curse placed upon her son shortly before his death. She later filed suit against TSR, publishers of the game at the time. The case against TSR was thrown out in 1984, and most of her claims were disproved by reporters, especially Michael A. Stackpole, who demonstrated that gamers had lower suicide rates than non-gamers.Game Hysteria and the Truth by Michael A. Stackpole When her lawsuits were dismissed, she founded BADD and began publishing information to promote her belief that D&D; encouraged Satanism, rape, and suicide, and incorporated an entire litany of immoral and illegal practices. BADD effectively ceased to exist after Pulling died of cancer in 1997. 60 Minutes special In 1985, a segment of 60 Minutes was devoted to the game and the \\"episode began with a solemn introduction by 19-time Emmy Award winner and Robert F Kennedy Award for Excellence in Journalism recipient Ed Bradley: '[Dungeons & Dragons] has become popular with children anywhere from grammar school on up. Not so with a lot of adults who think it's been connected to a number of suicides and murders'\\". It featured interviews with co-creator Gary Gygax and his head of public relations, Dr Thomas Radecki, the president of the National Coalition on TV Violence, and Patricia Pulling. It also included interviews with parents of players of the game, who had allegedly committed murders and suicides connected to the game. Radecki linked the game to 28 murder/suicide cases. In response, Gygax said \\"This is make-believe. No one is martyred, there is no violence there. To use an analogy with another game, who is bankrupted by a game of Monopoly? Nobody is. The money isn't real ‚Ä¶ There is no link, except perhaps in the mind of those people who are looking desperately for any other cause than their own failures as a parent\\". Lieth Von Stein A 1988 murder case in Washington, North Carolina brought Dungeons & Dragons more unfavorable publicity. Chris Pritchard, a student at North Carolina State University, allegedly masterminded the murder of his stepfather, Lieth Von Stein, for his $2 million fortune. Von Stein and his wife Bonnie (Pritchard's mother) were both bludgeoned and stabbed by a masked assailant in their bedroom, leaving the husband fatally wounded and the wife gravely injured. Chris Pritchard had a history of mutual antagonism with his stepfather, and investigators learned over the course of a year that Pritchard had become involved with drugs and alcohol while attending NCSU. But the authorities focused on his role-playing group after a game map depicting the Von Stein house turned up as physical evidence. Pritchard's friends, Neal Henderson and James Upchurch, were implicated in a plot to help Pritchard kill his stepfather. All three young men went to state prison in 1990. Henderson and Pritchard have since been paroled. Upchurch's death sentence was commuted to life in 1992; he is serving his term. True crime authors Joe McGinniss and Jerry Bledsoe played up the role-playing angle. Much attention was given to Upchurch's influence and power as a Dungeon Master. Bledsoe's book, Blood Games, was made into a TV movie, Honor Thy Mother, in 1992. That same year, McGinniss' book was adapted into a two-part TV miniseries, Cruel Doubt, directed by Yves Simoneau. Both television films depicted Dungeons & Dragons handbooks with artwork doctored to imply that they had inspired the murder.Cruel Doubt on The Escapist's FAQ TSR's reaction The controversy over the game led to a major boost in sales from 2.3 million dollars in 1979, to 8.7 million by the end of 1980 in a Streisand effect with the publicity. However, the moral panic in the 1980s still led TSR to remove references to demons, devils, and other potentially controversial supernatural monsters from the 2nd Edition of AD&D;, published in 1989. Devils and demons were renamed baatezu and tanar‚Äôri, respectively, and \\"they were often referred to as fiends within the text, but the 'D' words were never uttered for years within the game, even though many fans still referred to them by their original names at their own tables. The descriptions of each race focused more on the extra- dimensional aspect of their existence [...] The conflict between the two races (known as the Blood War) also became the focus of their actions, which overtook the seduction of mortals\\". The moral panic around role-playing games peaked between 1988 and 1992. A 2005 study highlighted that after 1992, it could not find \\"any letters, articles or editorials on the topic except for several retrospective examinations of the history of gaming between 1997 and 2000 and an article dealing with prejudice against Christians from within the gaming community in [Dungeon, Dragon, Breakout, Critical miss and Places to go People to Be] in 1999\\".  Legacy  In 1997, Wizards of the Coast purchased TSR. In the late 1990s, Wizards of the Coast started to reintroduce terminology in the 2nd Edition that TSR had removed. This shift was seen in books such as A Paladin in Hell (1998) and a Guide to Hell (1999). Peter Adkison, president of Wizards of the Coast, directed Monte Cook to start the reintroduction. \\"Cook was very happy to bring demons and devils back. He felt that their removal had just been 'lip service' to the people who had complained, that if they picked up a Monster Manual and saw a gargoyle, they'd still think that the game had demons\\". These later supplements used both styles of terminology interchangeably as the bowdlerized names themselves had been part of the Dungeons & Dragons \\"mythology for almost a decade\\". The Guide to Hell added an in-universe explanation on the differing terminology: \\"Devils are by nature deceptive. One of the most common ways in which they muddy the waters of scholarship is by the use of several different names\\". In 2000, the 3rd Edition of the game was released and addressed demonology far more explicitly than materials from previous editions; however, relations and interactions with these creatures are explicitly said to be evil. The \\"fervor surrounding Dungeons & Dragons had died down, which meant that the third edition of the game could experiment with new kinds of content without fear of controversy\\". In 2002 and 2003, Wizards of the Coast released two books with a mature audience label: the Book of Vile Darkness (2002) and the Book of Exalted Deeds (2003). The Book of Vile Darkness added \\"rules for things like alcohol and drug addiction, cannibalism, mutilation, sacrifice, and sexual fetishes. [...] There are some elements of the Book of Vile Darkness that haven't aged well, with some players objecting to the idea that all drug use or interest in sadomasochism makes a person inherently evil, but the content in the book was unlike anything that had been seen in print up until that point\\". Tracy Hickman, co-creator of Dragonlance, said the book was \\"cheap, trashy and demeaning\\" and stated, \\"every dark fear that mothers and clergy across America have about D&D; is now, suddenly, true\\". The Book of Exalted Deeds was the flip side of the Book of Vile Darkness and dealt \\"the extreme elements of the good alignment\\". It included \\"ethical questions that most players might not be comfortable with including in their game\\" and \\"also dealt with aspects of real-world religion and tried to use them in the context of Dungeons & Dragons, such as stigmata\\". In 2016, The New York Times reported that moral panic over Dungeons & Dragons had subsided as \\"parental anxieties have turned to videos, notably those dripping with gore\\", with heightened concerns around video games. Radley Balko, for The Washington Post, highlighted the connection to the larger Satanic panic movement that began in the 1970s and wrote: \\"The direct consequences of this particular moral panic weren‚Äôt as severe as some others. It mostly involved efforts to ban the game and, of course, led to ostracizing the kids who played it. [...] [The] larger trend did have some pretty devastating fallout, particularly within the criminal justice system\\".  Research  Clinical research The American Association of Suicidology, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and Health and Welfare Canada all concluded that there is no causal link between fantasy gaming and suicide.QUESTIONS & ANSWERS ABOUT ROLE- PLAYING GAMES, Loren K. Wiseman and Michael A. Stackpole, 1991 by Game Manufacturers Association In 1990, Michael A. Stackpole authored The Pulling Report, a review highly critical of Patricia Pulling and BADD's methods of data collection, analysis, and reporting. Researchers outside the context of BADD have investigated the emotional impact of Dungeons & Dragons since the 1980s. Studies have shown that depression and suicidal tendencies are not typically associated with role players. Feelings of alienation are not associated with mainstream players, though those who are deeply, and often financially, committed to the game do tend to have these feelings. According to one study there is \\"no significant correlation between years of playing the game and emotional stability.\\" When the American Association of Suicidology, the Centres for Disease Control, and the National Safety Council (among others) investigated \\"the levels of suicide amongst RPG players [...] in relation to national statistics on youth suicide in Canada and the United States [...], it was found that while overall level of youth suicide (15-25) was 5300 per year, there had only been 128 suicide attempts by game players recorded by B.A.D.D and affiliated organizations between 1979 and 1988. Furthermore, most of these claimed suicides were simply accumulated unsourced newspaper clippings, often referring to the same incident several times over. According to the estimated number of RPG gamers in the country at the time, there should have been at least 1060 gamer suicides in the same period. Consequently, the finding of the report was that suicide amongst RPG gamers was actually significantly lower than national averages for the age demographic of 15-25 year olds\\". One 2015 study has suggested that psychiatrists do not associate role-playing games such as Dungeons & Dragons with poor mental health.  Sociological research  In 2015, Joseph P. Laycock, analyzing the controversy in his book Dangerous Games: What the Moral Panic over Role-Playing Games Says about Play, Religion, and Imagined Worlds wrote that the gist of anti-D&D; arguments were related to the fact that role- playing was perceived by some Christian philosophers and theologians as dangerous because it leads to critical thinking. He explicitly wrote that \\"The arguments presented by Ankerber, Weldon, Leithart, Grant and Abanses serve as a cover to conceal the mechanisms of hegemony as well as to cover their own doubts about how indulging their love of fantasy might challenge their own faith\\".  Cultural representations and racism   Cultural representations  In the early editions of Dungeons & Dragons, humans \\"were coded as culturally White and depicted as racially so in illustrations in game manuals\\" ‚Äî \\"of the hundreds of illustrations depicting adventurers in the first edition and second edition Player's Handbook and Dungeon Master's Guide, there were no nonwhite adventurers\\". The \\"Eurocentric focus has its roots in the source material, specifically Tolkien's work\\". Supplements depicting non-Anglo-Saxon influenced cultures, such as Oriental Adventures (1985), Maztica Campaign Set (1991), Al-Qadim: Arabian Adventures (1992) and The Jungles of Chult (1993), were added to the game over time. However, critics have highlighted that many of these depictions use problematic tropes of ethnic groups. At the time of its release, Oriental Adventures (1985) was a best-seller. Since then, fans and designers have criticized how the book represents Asian culture. The book utilizes what Edward Said referred to as orientalism ‚Äì ‚Äúa way of reducing the complexity of eastern culture to a set of problematically racist and sexist stereotypes‚Äù. Game designer Daniel Kwan highlighted that the supplement uses depictions of Asians that are ‚Äúviolent and savage, uncivilized and in need of foreign saviors and as objects of fetishization‚Äù. The campaign setting book Kara-Tur: The Eastern Realms (1988) expanded a five-page description on \\"four empires: Shou Lung (Imperial China), T'u Lung (warring China), Wa (Tokugawa Japan), and Kozakura (Sengoku Japan)\\" from Oriental Adventures and added a new continent to the Forgotten Realms. While Ed Greenwood's original Forgotten Realms did not map one-to-one to real-world cultures, as the setting was expanded by other authors real-world cultures were used as a touchstone. \\"Technically, this practice started with the Celtic-influenced culture of the Moonshae Islands, but Kara-Tur was the first big expansion in this direction\\". Chult, a pan-Africa campaign setting in the Forgotten Realms, was introduced in a 1993 Dragon Magazine issue and then expanded on in the campaign setting The Jungles of Chult. The original article describes human inhabitants as \\"dark-skinned with tightly curled hair, while its other races include pygmies and 'bushmen.' In this setting, slaver caravans raid tribal villages, which survive on subsistence agriculture and hunting. A minutely-researched six pages detailing African weaponry followed, citing eight anthropological or historical texts\\". The setting book mentions slavery about 40 times. Chult's major city Mezro is described in this 2nd Edition book as a rival to \\"some of the most ‚Äòcivilized‚Äô population centers in Faerun\\". By 4th Edition, Chult was struck with disaster ‚Äì ‚Äúhuman civilization is virtually nonexistent here, though an Amnian colony and a port sponsored by Baldur‚Äôs Gate cling to the northern coasts, and a few tribes‚Äîsome noble savages, others depraved cannibals‚Äîroam the interior‚Äù. Cecilia D'Anastasio, for Kotaku, wrote that the campaign setting \\"has been written off as tone-deaf\\".  Racism  The Fundamentals of Game Design states: \\"in RPGs, race refers to groups of real and fantasy humanoids such as humans, dwarves, elves, giants, and so on. A better term would be species, but race is the term established by convention\\". Chris Van Dyke, in Race in Dungeons & Dragons, wrote \\"humans are the normative race, and given the Anglo-centric depiction of human culture in the game, humans can be interpreted as representing 'white people.' They are 'normal', while all other races, whether good or evil, are to some extent 'exotic,' and otherized\\". Historically, some races in Dungeons & Dragons have been depicted as automatically evil, and one critic states that they have been described with \\"language used to denigrate non-white peoples of the real world, specifically those of Asian or Black ethnicity\\". Another critic views that any portrayal of a fictional race or a \\"group of intelligent people as inherently evil feeds into the notion of harmful stereotypes. [...] Additionally, deciding that orcs are inherently less intelligent than other races also touches upon harmful topics of eugenics and the belief that some people are less intelligent solely due to their genetics\\". The modern depiction of orcs originates with J.R.R. Tolkien's Lord of the Rings where \\"orcs are inherently evil humanoid creatures\\" and described as \\"Mongol types\\". The depictions of orcs in Dungeons & Dragons (1974) and Advanced Dungeons & Dragons (1977) were the first major appearances of orcs outside Tolkien's work. Helen Young, an Australian academic, highlighted that the descriptions of orc bodies \\"resonate with anti-Black racist stereotypes\\" and a \\"comparison to animals, particularly pigs, is common in almost all editions of D&D; up to the present. [...] That orc bodies are violent and belligerent is iterated and re-iterated with each issue of a new edition of D&D; rules\\". Chris Sims, in the 4th Edition book Wizards Presents: Races and Classes (2007), wrote \\"where dwarves gather and build, orcs scavenge and destroy, and where dwarves are dutiful and industrious, orcs are treacherous and lazy\\". Many view orcs as a representation of the Other, \\"a philosophical concept used to paint entire cultures as being somehow inferior or evil because they were different\\". Gabrielle Lissauer, in The Tropes of Fantasy Fiction, highlighted that the Eberron campaign setting subverts the classical racial presentation of orcs as savages. Instead, Lissauer wrote \\"these orcs are interested in peace and keeping the world safe. They're not interested in expansion. They just want to live in harmony with nature\\". However, the notion of orcs as a racist trope is controversial. The Germanic studies scholar Sandra Ballif Straubhaar argues against the \\"recurring accusations\\" of racism, stating that \\"a polycultured, polylingual world is absolutely central\\" to the Middle-earth setting of Lord of the Rings, and that readers and filmgoers will easily see that. Drow are depicted as an evil, murderous, dark-skinned subrace of elves that were first mentioned in the 1st Edition Monster Manual (1977).Gygax, Gary. Monster Manual (TSR, 1977). The most famous Dungeons & Dragons \\"fictional character, a drow named Drizzt Do‚ÄôUrden, is commonly presented as the one exception: a hero who overcame his evil culture to become a good person\\". James Wyatt, in Wizards Presents: Races and Classes (2007), highlighted that \\"Drizzt Do‚ÄôUrden is a compelling hero because of the evil society he grew up in, the fear and prejudice he faces on the surface world, and the hatred the other drow of Menzoberranzan still hold for him\\". Some critics have highlighted that the drow are connected to the \\"racist idea that non-white people are inherently bad\\". In the book Dungeons and Dragons and Philosophy, author James Rocha states that the difference between drow and dark elves in the Forgotten Realms setting is rooted in racist stereotypes: \\"an acceptable lighter skinned dark race side by side with only the most rare exceptions in the darker race, which is thought to be inherently evil, mirrors American history in a very uncomfortable fashion\\". The author further states his opinion that descriptions of wood elves and sun elves in the Forgotten Realms utilize stereotypes of Native Americans and Asians, respectively, and dwarves in Greyhawk \\"seem to have traits that anti-Semites associate with the Jewish people\\".  5th Edition Dungeons & Dragons Tomb of Annihilation (2017) was criticized by both Paste and Kotaku for the book's depiction of the Chult setting. Cameron Kunzelman, for Paste, wrote \\"it is important to note that the jungles and dangers also have a slight feel of 'darkest Africa' to them, and the Chultan people are dark-skinned. The narrative beats in Tomb pull heavily from familiar sources like Edgar Rice Burroughs or Jules Verne, and those works have a long racialized history that is not often grappled with. [...] While the literary and visual content Tomb borrows from makes for interesting design and visuals, I think Wizards could have done more to interrogate those texts that they borrowed from and how they have a complicated past with general representations of 'Africa' writ large\\". Cecilia D'Anastasio, for Kotaku, \\"Here‚Äôs the rub: While many players I talked to enjoyed how the history and political structures of Chult were expanded in Tomb of Annihilation (and enjoyed the adventure‚Äôs plot generally), they were still unimpressed by its execution. Its setting is an amalgamation of African cultures, a trope frequent in 20th century media that flattens the dimensionality of human experiences on the continent, which contains hundreds of ethnic groups\\". In March 2020, Christian Hoffer, for ComicBook, highlighted that Explorer's Guide to Wildemount reuses the Orc race stats from Eberron: Rising From the Last War rather than the stats originally published in Volo's Guide to Monsters. Some of the differences include not having an intelligence stat penalty and the \\"Menancing\\" trait. Hoffer wrote that the book \\"takes an important step in specifying that no race of intelligent creatures inherently evil, nor are they inherently less smart than other races. While many still see the idea of 'race' in Dungeons & Dragons as problematic, Explorer's Guide to Wildemount at least removes one of the most problematic aspects of that part of D&D;\\". In June 2020, Polygon reported that \\"the D&D; team announced that it would be making changes to portions of its 5th edition product line that fans have called out for being insensitive. That includes racist portrayals of a people known as the Vistani, an in-fiction analog for the Romani people. The company will also be making a substantive change to character creation to broaden the permissible spectrum of character types within each of the game‚Äôs many races\\". In their official statement, the D&D; Team wrote: \\"throughout the 50-year history of D&D;, some of the peoples in the game‚Äîorcs and drow being two of the prime examples‚Äîhave been characterized as monstrous and evil, using descriptions that are painfully reminiscent of how real-world ethnic groups have been and continue to be denigrated. That‚Äôs just not right, and it‚Äôs not something we believe in. Despite our conscious efforts to the contrary, we have allowed some of those old descriptions to reappear in the game\\". In July 2020, Wizards of the Coast added a sensitivity disclaimer to some legacy products that are on sale digitally. Many of these products feature cultures inspired by Asia, Mesoamerica and the Middle East. Sebastian Modak, for The Washington Post, reported that the tabletop community has widely approved these changes. Modak wrote that \\"in its statement addressing mistakes around portrayals of different peoples in the D&D; universe, Wizards of the Coast highlighted its recent efforts in bringing in more diverse voices to craft the new D&D; source books coming out in 2021. But in a widely circulated statement, Orion D. Black, a narrative designer who was contracted by Wizards of the Coast for seven months, described a workplace where they felt tokenized and neglected. [...] These conversations ‚Äî around depictions of race and alleged treatment of employees of marginalized backgrounds and identities ‚Äî have encouraged players to seek out other tabletop roleplaying experiences\\".  Other objections  Prisons In 2004, Wisconsin's Waupun Prison instituted a ban on playing Dungeons & Dragons, arguing that it promoted gang-related activity. The policy went into effect based upon an anonymous letter from an inmate stating that the four prisoners that played the game were forming a \\"gang\\". When the ban took effect, the prison confiscated all D&D-related; materials. Inmate Kevin T. Singer, a dedicated player of the game, sentenced to a life term for first- degree homicide, sought to overturn the ban, saying it violated his First Amendment rights. However, on January 25, 2010, the U.S. 7th Circuit Court of Appeals upheld the ban as a \\"reasonable policy\\". Other prisons have a blanket ban on role-playing games, such as the Idaho State Correctional Institution, however, not all prisons ban Dungeons & Dragons. Some prisons ban components of the game under other policies ‚Äî for example, banning dice to reduce gambling. As a result, \\"prison players have come up with a variety of ingenious ways to make rolls‚Äîeverything from making the illicit dice themselves to designing intricate spinners out of batteries and paperclips\\". At prisons where the game is permitted, players often have to craft game \\"materials like miniatures, maps, and character sheets\\" out of permitted items. \\"Benign as these materials may seem to anyone familiar with tabletop gaming, many inmates will tell you it's not uncommon for correctional officers to mistake their gaming materials for something more nefarious\\". Melvin Woolley-Bey, incarcerated at Sterling Correctional Facility, said \\"a lieutenant took an active interest in breaking up our game, taking our pieces and sending out maps to the board to make sure they weren't escape plans\\".  Religious objections  =The Catechism of the New Age= In 1987 two pastors, Peter Leithart and George Grant, published a book titled The Catechism of the New Age: A Response to Dungeons and Dragons. Joseph P. Laycock wrote that their book condemned role-playing as allowing too much freedom, which the authors regard as a gateway to critical thinking which in turn may result in heretical thought. =Schnoebelen articles= William Schnoebelen wrote a series of articles criticizing Dungeons & Dragons from a Christian perspective. Schnoebelen stated that he used to be a Wiccan priest as well as a Satanic priest. After apostacizing from those faiths, he dedicated himself to encouraging others to avoid them as well. In 1989, he wrote an article entitled \\"Straight Talk on Dungeons and Dragons,\\" which was published by Chick Publications. The large amount of correspondence he received on the subject in the years that followed led him to write a follow- up article in 2001 entitled \\"Should a Christian Play Dungeons & Dragons?\\" These essays portray Dungeons & Dragons as a tool for New Age Satanic groups to introduce concepts and behaviors that are seen as contrary to \\"Christian teaching and morality\\" in general. Schnoebelen wrote in 2006: \\"In the late 1970s, a couple of the game writers actually came to my wife and I as prominent 'sorcerers' in the community. They wanted to make certain the rituals were authentic. For the most part, they are.\\" His first article summarized D&D; as \\"a feeding program for occultism and witchcraft. [...] Dungeons and Dragons violates the commandment of I Ths. 5:22 'Abstain from all appearance of evil.'\\" It stated that rituals described in the game were capable of conjuring malevolent demons and producing other real-world effects. The article further accused the Dungeon Master's Guide of celebrating Adolf Hitler for his charisma. Schnoebelen's second article focused on contrasting the Christian worldview and the fantasy worldview of D&D.; He wrote that \\"being exposed to all these ideas of magic to the degree that the game requires cannot but help have a significant impact on the minds of its players.\\" =Hickman articles= Tracy Hickman, best-selling fantasy writer, practicing Latter-Day Saint, and co-author of the Ravenloft module and Dragonlance campaign setting for Advanced Dungeons & Dragons, has written articles about the ethics of Dungeons & Dragons from a theistic point of view. His 1988 essay, \\"Ethics in Fantasy: Morality and D&D; / Part 1: That Evil Game!\\", addresses a number of concerns about the ethics surrounding D&D; and outlines hurdles in communication between gamers and non-gamers on the subject. This was published during the moral panic era and encouraged \\"D&D; players to communicate with their parents and pastors and to invite them to participate in the game, so they could see there was nothing wrong with it. The essay was well-received, but unfortunately, there was another high-profile killing later that year\\". Business disputes at TSR  Dave Arneson  The game's commercial success led to lawsuits initiated in 1979, then again in 1985, regarding distribution of royalty payments between Dungeons & Dragons co-creators Dave Arneson and Gary Gygax. Specifically at issue were the royalties for AD&D;, a product for which TSR did not acknowledge Arneson's intellectual property claims. Those suits were settled out of court by 1981. \\"In Dragon magazine editorials, Gygax began writing Arneson out of the history of D&D;‚Äîat least as anything other than a guy with some good ideas\\" and started to refer to Arneson's Blackmoor game as an \\"amended Chainmail fantasy campaign\\". In 1997, Peter Adkison paid Arneson an undisclosed sum to free up Dungeons & Dragons from royalties owed to Arneson; this allowed Wizards of the Coast to retitle Advanced Dungeons & Dragons to simply Dungeons & Dragons.  Blume brothers  Gygax became embroiled in a political struggle for control of TSR and disputes related to the company's deteriorating financial situation in the early 1980s. The issues for Gygax originated in July 1975, after Gygax and Brian Blume reorganized their company from a partnership to a corporation called TSR Hobbies. Gygax owned 150 shares, Blume owned the other 100 shares, and both had the option to buy up to 700 shares at any time in the future. But TSR Hobbies had nothing to publish ‚Äî Dungeons & Dragons was still owned by the three-way partnership, and neither Gygax nor Blume had the money to buy out the shares owned by Donna Kaye, wife of the late Don Kaye. Blume persuaded a reluctant Gygax to allow his father, Melvin Blume, to buy Donna's shares, and those were converted to 200 shares in TSR Hobbies. In addition, Brian bought another 140 shares. These purchases reduced Gygax from the majority shareholder in control of the company to minority shareholder; he effectively became the Blumes' employee. Then in 1980, Brian Blume persuaded Gygax to allow Brian's brother Kevin to purchase Melvin Blume's shares. This gave the Blume brothers a controlling interest, and by 1981, Gygax and the Blumes were increasingly at loggerheads over management of the company. While Kevin Blume became president of TSR, Inc., Gygax was made president of TSR Entertainment, Inc., and the Blumes sent him to Hollywood to develop TV and movie opportunities in 1983. By 1984, although TSR Inc. was the games industry leader, grossing $30 million, it was barely breaking even and had debts of $1.5 million. The Blume brothers began to shop around for someone to buy the company. When Gygax heard that TSR was being shopped around, he returned to Lake Geneva. After some investigation of the company finances, Gygax charged that the financial crisis was due to mismanagement by Kevin Blume: excess inventory, overstaffing, too many company cars, and some questionable (and expensive) projects such as dredging up a 19th-century shipwreck. Gygax persuaded the board of directors to remove Kevin Blume as president. The final vote was 4‚Äì1, with Brian Blume abstaining. However, the outside directors still believed the company's financial problems were terminal and the company needed to be sold. In an effort to prevent this, in March 1985, Gygax exercised his 700-share stock option, giving him just over 50% control. He appointed himself president and CEO, and in order to bring some financial stability to TSR, he hired a company manager, Lorraine Williams, who dismissed the three outside directors. Bringing Williams on board backfired for Gygax when in October 1985, Brian Blume revealed that he had triggered his own 560-share option, and then he and his brother Kevin had sold all their shares to Williams, leaving her as the majority shareholder. Williams also made it clear that Gygax would be making no further creative contributions to TSR. Several of his projects were immediately shelved and never published.Gygax, Gary 1987. \\"From the Sorcerer's Scroll\\", Dragon 122:40 (Jun 1987) Gygax took TSR to court in a bid to block the Blumes' sale of their shares to Williams, but he lost, and Williams replaced Gygax as president and CEO. Sales of D&D; reached in 1985, but Gygax, seeing his future at TSR as untenable, resigned all positions with TSR in October 1986, and settled his disputes with TSR in December 1986. By the terms of his settlement with TSR, Gygax kept the rights to Gord the Rogue as well as all D&D; characters whose names were anagrams or plays on his own name (for example, Yrag and Zagyg). However, he lost the rights to all his other work, including the World of Greyhawk and the names of all the characters he had ever used in TSR material, such as Mordenkainen, Robilar, and Tenser. After Wizards of the Coast purchased TSR in 1997, Gygax wrote the preface to the 1998 adventure Return to the Tomb of Horrors, a paean to Gygax's original AD&D; adventure Tomb of Horrors. He also returned to the pages of Dragon Magazine, writing the \\"Up on a Soapbox\\" column from Issue #268 (January 2000) to Issue #320 (June 2004). Licensing and trademark disputes  Tolkien  References in early TSR publications to certain creatures from J. R. R. Tolkien's mythical Middle-earth were removed or altered due to intellectual property concerns. For example, TSR replaced all references to the character race of Hobbits in D&D; with their alternate name, Halflings‚Äîwhich was coined by Tolkien but judged by TSR to be non-infringing. In the first edition of Dungeons & Dragons, the threat of copyright action from Tolkien Enterprises prompted the name changes of hobbit to \\"halfling\\", ent to \\"treant\\", and balrog to \\"Type VI demon [balor]\\".Kuntz; \\"Tolkien in Dungeons & Dragons\\" in Dragon #13Gygax; \\"On the Influence of J.R.R.

Tolkien Encyclopedia\\", p 229  Deities & Demigods  TSR ran afoul of intellectual property law regarding the Cthulhu Mythos and Melnibon√©an Mythos, elements of which were included in early versions of the 1980 Deities & Demigods manual. These problems were ultimately resolved by excising the material from later editions of the book. shows contents of different printings.  Digital piracy  On April 6, 2009, Wizards of the Coast suspended all sales of its products for the Dungeons & Dragons games in PDF format from places such as OneBookShelf and its subsidiaries RPGNow.com and DRIVETHRURPG.com. This coincided with a lawsuit brought against eight people in an attempt to prevent future copyright infringement of their books, and included the 4th Edition Dungeons & Dragons products that were made available through these places as well as all older editions PDFs of the game. In 2013, OneBookShelf was once again allowed to sell Dungeons & Dragons products through a new partnership with Wizards of the Coast. These products, from Advanced Dungeons & Dragons through the 4th Edition of the game, were sold on the DNDClassics website. In 2016, OneBookShelf launched a new digital storefront in partnership with Wizards of the Coast called the Dungeon Masters Guild (DMsGuild). The DNDClassics site was replaced by the new DMsGuild storefront. With the 5th Edition Dungeons & Dragons open game license, third party publishers are allowed to print and publish content based on the 5th Edition System Reference Document (SRD). The DMsGuild took that a step further by allowing individuals and third party publishers to create and sell content based on the Forgotten Realms. As of 2019, content can now be based on other Wizards of the Coast intellectual property such as Ravenloft, Eberron, and Ravnica.  Atari  In December 2009, Hasbro filed a lawsuit against Atari, claiming Atari had breached their Dungeons & Dragons licensing agreement when Atari sold its European distribution business to Namco Bandai Partners. Atari was accused of sub- licensing part of its exclusive D&D; rights to Namco Bandai Partners without authorization. Hasbro also alleged Namco Bandai had obtained Hasbro's confidential information about D&D; from Atari, and that Namco Bandai had posed as a D&D; publisher for digital games previously published by Atari. In addition, the plaintiff claimed Atari had sold at least four of its subsidiaries actively engaged in D&D; licensed activities to Namco Bandai while denying any relationship between itself and Namco Bandai with respect to D&D.; Atari claimed Hasbro tried to unfairly take back rights granted to Atari, and has sought to resolve the matter without cooperation from Hasbro. On August 15, 2011, Wizards of the Coast, Hasbro, and Atari announced the settlement and resolution of the complaint against Atari and the counterclaims filed by Atari against Hasbro. As part of the settlement, digital licensing rights for D&D; were returned to Hasbro. Atari would continue to develop and market several games under license from Hasbro and Wizards, including Dungeons & Dragons: Daggerdale and Heroes of Neverwinter for Facebook. In addition, as a result of the sales of Cryptic Studio to Perfect World Entertainment Inc., the release date of the Neverwinter video game was delayed to late 2012.  Dragonlace  In October 2020, Margaret Weis and Tracy Hickman filed suit against Wizards of the Coast for breaching a licensing deal with Weis and Hickman for a new Dragonlance novel trilogy. Boing Boing reported that \\"according to the lawsuit, Weis and Hickman agreed with Wizards of the Coast to produce the new novels in 2017, capping off the series and giving fans a final sendoff. But the company pulled the plug in August 2020\\".

Together, their waters and the reservoirs linked to them represent the northern half of the New York City water system's Croton Watershed. Shortly after the confluence of the three Croton River branches the Croton River proper, along with its tributary, the Muscoot River, flows into the Muscoot Reservoir, after which it empties into the New Croton Reservoir, which feeds the New Croton Aqueduct supplying water to New York City.

Pictured, New Croton Dam Croton River as it flows away from Croton Dam The Croton River was the main source of New York City's water supply from 1842 on. It was brought to the city through the Croton Aqueduct, which was later called the Old Croton Aqueduct. Seeking to expand New York City's water supply, engineers of the city Aqueduct Commission designed in 1884 a masonry dam spanning the Croton River near its mouth. The resulting storage reservoir, impounding a watershed, would hold at full capacity. This dam, now known as the New Croton Dam, was completed in 1906. Further upstream, two tributaries of the Croton were dammed, creating the Croton Falls Reservoir, which was placed into service in 1911. In the 1890s, rather than resorting to expensive filtration, New York City ordered the destruction or relocation of any village or hamlet threatening to pollute the Croton or its tributaries. Many were moved. In the late 1990s, New York City stopped using water from the Croton as it became more and more unsuitable for drinking. In 2004, a project was started to rehabilitate the New Croton Aqueduct and build a filtration plant which is expected to come on line after 2015.NYC DEP Completes Rehab of 124 Year-old New Croton Aqueduct at tunnelingonline.com, Feb 25, 2014.

The Budget began publishing in 1890. The paper was known as The Weekly Budget up to the time the Royal Printing Company began publishing it in 1920. Currently, The Budget is published in two editions: a local edition and a national edition, each with different content and readership. The local edition includes the national edition inside. The most unique thing about the Budget is that it consists mainly of columns written and sent in by Scribes in various plain Anabaptist communities all around the world. The Budget Scribes document community events such as baptisms, weddings, births and funerals, as well as information on church attendance, visitors, weather, accidents or illnesses, agricultural happenings, special church and school events. It is similar to a collection of circle letters, allowing folks to keep up with friends and relatives who live in far-flung plain communities. History The founder and first editor of The Budget from 1890 though 1913 was Amish Mennonite John C. Miller, who was nicknamed \\"Budget John\\". Amish Mennonite minister Samuel H. Miller was the second editor through 1920. He was followed by S.A. Smith until 1930, when Smith's son George R. Smith took over until 1969. Serving as editor for nearly 40 years, and continuing as associate editor even after that, George R. Smith contributed greatly to shaping The Budget into what it is today. Keith Rathbun, formerly of the Cleveland Scene alternative weekly, served as publisher from 2000 - 2016. Rathbun gave The Budget its first online exposure in the form of an official website, a move which surprised some of the readership and generated some mainstream media attention due to the apparent logical contradiction of an Amish website. Milo G. Miller December 28, 2016 issue of The Budget took the lead as publisher in 2017. Local edition The local edition focuses on stories of local interest in several Ohio counties, and includes several pages of non-Amish-specific content. It is the most-read newspaper in its area including Holmes County as well as parts of Tuscarawas, Wayne and Coshocton counties. National edition Despite its name, the national edition is published not only nationwide but in several other countries in the Americas as well as overseas.

Once the seat of the Victorian Prime Minister William Lamb, 2nd Viscount Melbourne, the hall is the origin of the name of the city of Melbourne, Australia. The house is now the seat of Lord and Lady Ralph Kerr and is open to the public. The house is a Grade II* listed building; more than twenty features in the grounds are Grade I listed. Melbourne, a manor that had belonged to the bishops of Carlisle in the twelfth century, was partly rebuilt in 1629‚Äì31 for Sir John Coke by a Derbyshire mason, Richard Shepherd.Colvin In 1692 it was inherited by Thomas Coke (1675‚Äì1727), a gentleman architect in the golden age of English amateur architecture, who laid out the formal gardens that survive, with some professional assistance from Henry Wise, between about 1696 and 1706: there are avenues, a parterre, a yew walk that has become a yew tunnel, basins and fountains, and lead and stone sculpture, much of it supplied by John Nost. Coke travelled in the Netherlands and he turned to Nost, the famous sculptor born in the Austrian Netherlands, with premises in Haymarket, London, who provided lead figures of amorini, vases, baskets of flowers and mythological figures, still identifiable at Melbourne, and most notably the lead \\"Vase of the Seasons\\" (1705), that is one of the finest examples of Baroque sculpture in lead in an English garden.Gunnis Nost also provided a number of chimneypieces in the house as well as for Sir Thomas's London house in St. James's Place, one of which came to ¬£50. At the sale of Nost's effects, Sir Thomas purchased his copy of Serlio's Five Books of Architecture, English'd by Robert Peake, which is still in the Library. Detail of a figure on a large vase in the gardens of Melbourne Hall Among fine wrought iron made for the grounds at Melbourne by Robert Bakewell is the wrought-iron arbour known as the \\"birdcage\\". This was restored by the architect Louis Osman in 1958, in conjunction with the ironwork specialists George Lister & Sons Ltd. Osman researched Bakewell's plans, removing a ton of paint and inserting a thousand new pieces of wrought iron to replace crude repairs, as well as restoring the original colours. Though he drew up a plan for remodelling the sixteenth and seventeenth-century house and had the west wing rebuilt by Francis Smith of Warwick, it remained to his son, G. L. Coke to rebuild the east front, facing the garden, and adjust the south front, in 1743‚Äì44, to a design by William Smith, the son of Francis Smith.William Jackson, of Melton Mowbray, was the master mason, paid ¬£1500 (Gunnis). His design for a gatehouse, built \\"according to his Honour's Draught\\" was built by Smith of Warwick but dismantled before the end of the eighteenth century. Unidentified alterations undertaken in 1720‚Äì21 were carried out by the builder William Gilks of Burton-on-Trent. The figure of George Lewis Coke remains an ambiguous one. Some believe that he was never at Melbourne after he left for a foreign tour in his late teens. Redecorations of the interior were carried out throughout the century, in several campaigns. In 1745 Joseph Hall of Derby was paid for the chimneypiece in the Great Dining Room; in the 1760s, stucco by Samuel Franceys was executed, and for the First Viscount Melbourne, in 1772, further interior alterations were carried out by the leading Derbyshire architect, Joseph Pickford. The second Lord Melbourne, Queen Victoria's Prime Minister, was separated from his wife, Lady Caroline Lamb, in 1825, when her liaison with Lord Byron had become notorious. The house passed into the hands of the Cowper family when Emily Lamb, sister of the childless third and last Viscount Melbourne, married the 5th Earl Cowper. (She later married another Prime Minister, Lord Palmerston.) It remained in the Cowper family until Lady Amabel Cowper married Admiral of the Fleet Lord Walter Kerr who made Melbourne the family home in 1906. The current owner Lord Ralph Kerr also owns Ferniehirst Castle in Scotland. He is the heir to the Marquessate of Lothian and the chiefship of Clan Kerr, as his brother the 13th Marquess, better known as the politician Michael Ancram, has no sons, though he has two daughters.

It consisted of Odetta and Lawrence B. Mohr, the former of whom became the more well known in ensuing decades.  Background  Odetta Holmes and Lawrence B. Mohr met at a bar called \\"The Lamp\\" on Kearney Street in North Beach, San Francisco in 1953, the area that the Beatniks were soon to inspire. Odetta was in San Francisco because she was travelling with the chorus of Finian's Rainbow. Lawrence (Larry) had just finished college at the University of Chicago, and travelled to San Francisco with his best friend who was shipping overseas into the Navy. \\"The Lamp\\" was famous for its musical environment. People would spend evenings there jamming with guitars, banjos, and other musical instruments. On one fateful evening in the summer of 1953, Larry began playing a Lead Belly song and Odetta joined in harmony. They jammed together, and that was the beginning.Larry Mohr Interview  Tin Angel  Odetta was becoming known around North Beach, San Francisco and stayed in town after Finian‚Äôs Rainbow left. She was hired to sing at a club called The Purple Onion, which made her well known in the club-arena. Shortly thereafter, Odetta was hired by Peggy Tolk-Watkins, owner of the Tin Angel, to sing most evenings at the club. When she saw how well Odetta grooved with Larry, Peggy hired Larry too. Most evenings, the pair would each do a solo set and then a set together. On a typical evening, the audience numbered 30-40 persons. Max and Sol Weiss, the owners of Fantasy Records, asked Odetta and Larry to make an album which they titled ‚ÄúOdetta and Larry‚Äù (originally a 10‚Äù LP and then expanded to a 12‚Äù LP, and eventually expanded into a CD). They recorded over several evenings. The songs that appeared on the album were chosen based on how well Odetta, Larry, the Weisses, and the audience liked each song. Altogether, Odetta and Larry performed at the Tin Angel for about 8 months.Larry Mohr Interview  After the Tin Angel  The duo ceased playing together because Larry was drafted into the army, and was soon shipped to Bordeaux, France. By the time he returned to San Francisco from the army in 1956, the Tin Angel had folded. The duo reconnected and played several concerts in Berkeley, San Francisco and Los Angeles. The pair began growing in different directions as Odetta went on to an illustrious professional singing career and Larry went on to an accomplished academic career. He worked for the United States Public Health Service in Washington, D.C. for many years, went to graduate school, and eventually became a professor of Political Science at the University of Michigan.University of Michigan Faculty Page \\"We remained friends and saw each other from time to time ‚Äî not often,\\" Larry said in 2012.

It incorporates financial and service assistance models to alleviate health care costs for its members and is a model for cooperative health care reform in the United States. The mission of IHA is to facilitate access to health care for all, with a focus on the needs of the un- and underinsured. IHA sponsors and operates the Ithaca Free Clinic.  History  In 1997, grass roots activists in Ithaca, New York organized by local innovator Paul Glover, began working with their community to address the issue of access to health care. Inspired by the examples of the Canadian national health care system as well as the collective approach to health care financing among the Amish, an idea dubbed the \\"Ithaca Health Fund\\" was born. The original vision of this health cooperative included: * Focus on the local community for solutions, rather than relying on the benevolence of employers, corporations, or the government. * Use a democratic infrastructure, centered on the thoughts and identified needs of members. * Offer a sliding scale fee to health care providers who gave discounts to other Health Fund members. * Set aside savings for a clinic and other community health programs. The new organization soon attracted members, each joining for $100 per year. As more people joined what became known as the Ithaca Health Alliance (IHA), the organization's finances improved, and a better selection of health care services became available. At the same time, members began setting aside money for other community health projects. Glover was the Fund's first administrator and the only paid IHA staffer. He kept costs down by drawing a modest salary, while the structure of the Fund itself helped to encourage prevention and therefore manage costs in a realistic manner. One early Fund example was a dental category with a $20 contribution to the annual cost of an exam and cleaning. Over time, the scope of care covered by the Fund expanded to include stitches, the treatment of broken bones and emergency room care. By 2004, the Ithaca Health Fund was a well-known local alternative to health insurance. Members primarily resided in Ithaca and Tompkins County, but the Fund had fairly wide representation across the state of New York. Glover continued to serve as the Fund's administrator, and his informal style of record keeping and Fund management earned him points among the members, who appreciated the lack of red tape. Membership was affordable, services were limited but basic, and the Fund remained solvent. In a bid to grow the Fund beyond its New York membership, Glover began marketing it to other states. At the same time, a journalist at the Utne Reader learned about IHA and began researching an article. A reporter for a health insurance blog interviewed Glover, then contacted the New York State Insurance Department (NYSID), which immediately began an investigation. NYSID claimed that IHA had been selling insurance without a license. After months of wrangling, IHA's lawyers reached an accord via the NYS Attorney General's office, promising to replace terms like \\"benefits\\" with \\"grants\\" and assuring NYSID officials that IHA would discontinue offering memberships beyond New York's borders. Eventually NYSID relented, recognizing that Glover's enthusiasm for the mission of \\"health care for all\\" was well-intentioned. Today the IHA and its programs continue to operate with the same core mission and principles of its founders.  The IHA today  At the time of the NYSID decision, IHA membership had risen to 1000. The number of members has now stabilized at about 700 people. Consistent with IHA's bylaws, members elect the Board of Directors from among the membership, and the members, by way of member committees and along with the Board, jointly govern the IHA through shared and ongoing input. In the beginning, members were active in IHA matters, wanting input into decisions and consistently willing to spend long hours at organizational meetings to hammer out policy and set IHA's direction. Today, however, members expect the Board of Directors to take responsibility for the organization. For example, the Board oversees the staff, operational details of all its programs, and every leadership-level decision within IHA. Since the NYSID decision, IHA program development has exceeded local expectations. To date, the Fund program has awarded more than $200,000 in grants. IHA members can apply for grants of up to $3,000 to $4,500 per year for specific healthcare needs. Most frequently requested grants are for dental care, whereas the biggest grant categories are dedicated to emergency services. The IHA seeks to expand grant categories annually, based on the needs expressed by members and the resources of the organization. In addition to the services available through grants, a revolving loan fund provides interest-free help to members for dental and eye care.  IHA healthcare providers  Over 150 healthcare providers are IHA members, and they give discounts typically from 5 to 10 percent of the cost of their services to other IHA members. Providers include professionals from conventional and complementary/alternative practices, including physicians, dentists, chiropractors, herbalists, acupuncturists, registered nurses, psychologists, doulas, and many others. Most providers live and work in Ithaca and the surrounding villages and towns of Tompkins County. IHA maintains a provider member directory on its website, thus promoting providers' commitment to community health. At the same time, IHA made payments on behalf of members to any health provider worldwide.  IHA memberships  In addition to the individual membership, which continues to cost the original $100 per year, discounted memberships are available to spouses, partners, and children. Employers also get a 20 percent discounted rate for employees when the employees join as a group. Memberships are frequently made available through the generosity of community donors in IHA's donated membership program, and the Board has committed to paying for additional memberships whenever community or donated funds for the program have been exhausted.  IHA Community Grants  The IHA Community Grants program offers small grants to community organizations that conduct health projects. A few examples include funds for the Cayuga Nature Center (CNC), which received grants to train its Bobcat camp counselors in CPR and resources to buy medical supplies and protective gear for CNC staff. IHA has also used Community Grants to subsidize shares in a Cornell Cooperative Extension program that makes food from the area's community-supported agriculture program available to low-income families. Recently under the grants program IHA and other health education agencies joined with a local environmental group, Sustainable Tompkins, for presentations centered on \\"Sustainable Health Care for All.\\"  IHA educational programs  The Ithaca Health Alliance education program receives high marks from the community. This program has sponsored events at intervals during the past several years, making them open to everyone, and three years ago also undertook the publication of a quarterly newsletter. The newsletter is either mailed or emailed to members. In an effort to fulfill its commitment of education of the community at large, IHA distributes without charge copies of the newsletter to local coffee shops and other public places. As part of this program, IHA has funded the acquisition of books focused on health promotion by the Tompkins County Public Library and the Durland Alternatives Library at Cornell.  IHA staff  A combination of resources between the IHA and funders has made it possible to employ three staff members, who receive a modest but certified \\"living wage\\" and IHA membership as a benefit of employment. The office manager is responsible for the distribution of grants, communication with members, area officials, and business people. The outreach coordinator works to educate the community about the IHA and the Free Clinic, with a mandate to assess the needs of the community regarding health programs. The clinic coordinator facilitates care during Ithaca Free Clinic sessions, and trains and coordinates volunteers.  The Ithaca Free Clinic  With the opening of the Ithaca Free Clinic (IFC) in January, 2006, the IHA fulfilled one of its earliest dreams by making free care available to uninsured residents. In doing so, Ithaca has joined the ranks of generally much larger cities in the U.S. Financed through membership savings from 1997 to the Free Clinic's inception, members continue to support the IFC, as do donations from the wider community. The IHA has also received competitive grantsSocial Ventures/Ithaca Health Alliance Receives Grant to Expand Services to Uninsured in Tompkins County, NYS Health Foundation that have allowed for better- supported and expanded Free Clinic services.  Clinic hours of operation  The Clinic is open from 2 p.m. to 6 p.m. on Mondays and from 4 p.m. to 7 p.m. on Thursdays, with an appointment day for special services on Tuesdays from 3 p.m. to 7 p.m.  Clinic services  IFC is one of only three medically integrated free clinics in the U.S., meaning that visitors are treated by both conventional and complementary healthcare professionals. A physician and a registered nurse are always on duty. Conventional medical care accounts for 70 percent of services the Free Clinic provides. Most days, alternative practitioners, such as herbalists, massage therapists, chiropractors, and acupuncturists, join physicians and registered nurses. Nutritionists offer scheduled appointments for education and consultation, and a newly developed occupational therapy program provides case management and therapy for a range of human conditions.  Clinic volunteers  A large group of support personnel manages the office, advising patients and visitors about community resources and advocating for patients' needs. Upwards of 75 volunteers, including students from area colleges and universities, along with many interested and dedicated community members, freely contribute their time to the ongoing success of IFC.  Statistics  In its first year of operation, the Free Clinic completed more than 850 patient visits, nearly triple the number initially anticipated. In its second year, the Clinic had 1880 visits, while in 2008 2091 visits were made to IFC. According to data for the first half of 2009, 70 volunteers contributed 1735 hours of service, for a total of 1121 patient visits. IFC is nearly always busy. An estimated 12,000 residents of Tompkins County have no health insurance. Without IFC, many of these people could also expect to be without medical care. Unable to pay out-of-pocket fees for service, the uninsured residents in and around Ithaca are frequently dangerously ill before they learn about IFC. Three years of providing care to indigent and working poor populations has revealed to staff and volunteers that IFC is the primary source of care for most of the Clinic's patients.  Present day  As it has been since its inception, IHA is a member organization. Most of the organization's income relies on private charitable contributions and government grants. Over 700 professional, community, and college volunteers provide all services. In 2010, IHA was granted tax-exempt 501(c)(3) status.

The Speaker is elected by the members of the house when they first convene for their regular session, which is currently in January of each odd-numbered year. Perhaps the most important duty of the Speaker is to appoint members and chairs of the various standing committees of the House. The office evolved from the office of Speaker of the lower house of the legislature in the Province of Carolina, called the House of Burgesses. Since the House was the only elected body in the colony, the Speaker was often seen as the leading voice of the people. In 1776, North Carolina created its first constitution, which established a Senate and a House of Commons, both of which were elected by voters. In the 1868 North Carolina Constitution, the name of the house was changed to \\"House of Representatives.\\" For most of the twentieth century, the office's power was limited, because Speakers usually only served for a single legislative session. This changed with Speakers Carl J. Stewart, Jr. (1977‚Äì1980), Liston B. Ramsey (1981‚Äì1988) and James B. Black (1999‚Äì2006). Democrats held the speaker's chair continuously from 1899 until 1994, when Republicans gained a majority and elected Harold J. Brubaker in January 1995. In the 2003‚Äì2004 session, a unique power-sharing arrangement was created by Democrats and a handful of Republicans. This resulted in the first election of two speakers simultaneously, Jim Black (Democrat) and Richard T. Morgan (Republican). The two held roughly equal power and took turns presiding over the House. After Democrats won a majority in the 2004 election, this arrangement was ended, but Morgan again supported Black and was named Speaker Pro Tempore.

He is considered \\"The Founder of Hong Kong Education\\" for integrating a modern western-style education model into the Colonial Hong Kong school systems. Stewart could speak fluent Cantonese, which was vital to his work in the 19th century. Early life The son of James Stewart and Jean Brown, Stewart was born in Rathen, Aberdeenshire in Scotland on 30 October 1836. He was educated in King's College at the University of Aberdeen. Career He was teaching in a temporary position at Stubbington House School when a post was announced in the Aberdeen Journal on 7 August 1861 for the headmaster position of the newly established \\"Government Central School\\", known today as Queen's College. Five months later, Stewart would accept the position, reaching Hong Kong at the age of 25 on 15 February 1862. Ho Kai was one of his pupils. As part of a new British government initiative, he also became the inspector for all government schools in Hong Kong that same year. On 30 June 1865 Stewart became the first head of the \\"Government Education Department\\" in Hong Kong. He resigned on 19 May 1881 at the age of 45. In 1879 his alma mater, the University of Aberdeen, awarded him the honorary degree of LL.D for furthering the interests of education in Hong Kong. Stewart was appointed police magistrate in 1881 and Registrar-General in 1883. From 1887 to 1889 he would serve as the Colonial Secretary, second only to the Governor of Hong Kong. Informally, he would also act as the leading advisor on educational matters in Hong Kong. He was also the dean of the \\"Faculty of Medicine\\", the precursor of the University of Hong Kong until his death in 1889. Memory Steward died in sudden illness while in the office of Colonial Secretary in 1889. A memorial stained glass window was erected in St. John's Cathedral.

It was named after Sterling Ball, son of Ernie Ball, the founder of the parent company. This bass weighs around nine pounds, sporting a solid body made from selected hardwoods (generally Ash) and finished in high-gloss polyester. The bridge is the traditional Music Man chrome plated, hardened steel bridge plate with stainless steel saddles and an optional piezo feature for acoustic upright-like tones. The standard pickguard colour is either black or white. The Sterling uses a long, 34\\"-scale length with a maple neck featuring rosewood or maple fingerboard (pau ferro for the fretless variant). Like the other Music Man basses, the Sterling comes with Schaller tuners. The truss rod is adjustable and the neck is bolt-on type with an asymmetrical five-bolt neck plate. The electronics are magnetically shielded and a three- way switch is used for pickup coil selection as well as a three-band active EQ with separate tone controls for treble, middle, and bass. The Sterling differs from the famous Music Man StingRay 4-string bass in that it is lighter, smaller, has a different preamp and a selector switch for parallel, single coil, and series pickup coil configurations, uses the \\"phantom coil\\" pickup technology and features a thinner neck with 22 frets rather than 21 actually found on the StingRay. It won 'Most Innovative Bass of 1993\\" in Musician Magazine. Notable users are Colin Greenwood of Radiohead, Dave LaRue (of the Steve Morse Band, The Dixie Dregs, and Bruce Hornsby), Johnny Christ of Avenged Sevenfold, Dougie Poynter of McFly, which has light up led inlays, Andy Stickel of 7 Blue Skies and Roger Manganelli of Less Than Jake, Ado Flowers of Ebony Brown, H'Edin Duranovic of Fall of Reach, Diego D'Agata of splatterpink, Brandon Bloomfield of 221Fly and Jennifer Young of the Travis Larson Band. The Sterling was created as a four-string version of the highly popular StingRay 5, which also uses ceramic magnet pickups and a different preamp than the StingRay's alnico magnet pickups. New pickup configurations and five-way pickup switching debuted in 2005. Music Man has introduced a five-string version using the same body and pickguard styling as the original four-string since January 22, 2008. On July 24, 2010, Music Man introduced a \\"Classic Collection\\" 4 string Sterling featuring a single ceramic pickup wired in parallel, two-band boost/cut EQ, string-through slab body, 7.5\\" inch fretboard radius, a choice of flamed or birds-eye maple neck with maple or rosewood fingerboard, chrome battery cover, and string mutes.

Any entity can have a learning plan. They are often used by individuals to plan and manage their own learning, but they can also be used by teams, communities of practice or organizations. An organizational level plan can be the aggregate of its individuals plans or it can add information on the emergent learning needs of the overall organization. The active development and maintenance of a learning plan can enrich a person's life and the sharing of learning plans can help to strengthen a community. Components of a learning plan A good learning plan is a well articulated document with the following components: A set of 'learning goals' that the person (or organization) hopes to achieve within a specific period of time. It is often useful to divide larger goals into more manageable sub-goals that can be realized within weeks or months. Each learning goal (or sub goal) should have a series of concrete steps or actions that the person will take to move towards the goal. Actions should be actual behaviors. Writing a quality article for Wikipedia is an example of an action. Or, if the learning goal is \\"understand Indian cooking\\", preparing and serving a masala to a group of East Indian friends might be an appropriate action. Each action should be associated with one or more resources and with evidence. Resources are anything that can be used to realize the actions to be taken towards the learning goal. One of the best resources is a mentor or coach, but there are many others, including books, courses, travel, the Internet and especially Wikipedia. Once a resource has been applied to a goal it is often helpful to rate the effectiveness of the resource, especially in cases where the learning plan will be shared. Evidence is used to demonstrate that an action has been taken, that progress towards the goal has been made, and finally that the goal has been achieved. Evidence can be private, when the person does not need to demonstrate to other people that the goal has been achieved, or public, when evidence is required. Modes of learning A learning plan can be used for many modes of learning. One taxonomy is as follows: *Culture - learning about one's own or other people's cultures *Financial - learning how to manage money and how money works in the economy *Physical - physical fitness can be a form of learning and a learning plan can be used to improve and track a person's fitness *Political (Citizen) - learning more about one's polity and the rights and duties of citizenship *Relationship - things that one wants to learn about people in key relationships, and how to be more effective in relationships *Spiritual - deepening one's understanding of the spiritual dimension of life; a prayer or meditation journal can be part of a learning plan. *Work - professional learning A learning plan will often have parts that are strictly private, others that are only shared with one's intimates, others that are for various groups, and it may have some parts that are public. Learning plans, learning records, and the ePortfolio As a learning plan evolves, goals are attained, evidence is collected and becomes a learning record. There has been much attention to learning records or the Electronic portfolio in recent pedagogy and andragogy. Whereas a learning plan looks forward to what is to be achieved, a learning record looks backwards to the past and what has been accomplished. Two sides of the same coin. Learning landscape A learning landscape is a broader concept than a learning plan, placing the individual at the centre of their learning, allowing them to connect with other learners and create online communities. A learning landscape brings together the strengths of electronic portfolio and social networking. A learning landscape is usually based on an individual's interests, skills, reflection and competencies. By sharing these aspirations and thoughts other members can offer support and encouragement. Tools such as Elgg provide facilities for developing learning landscapes.

The result of the merging of various armed revolutionary organizations active in Mexico prior to 1974, with the objective of creating a united front to combat the Mexican government; the name was chosen to commemorate an unsuccessful guerrilla assault on the barracks of Ciudad Madera in the northern state of Chihuahua led by former schoolteacher Arturo G√°miz and the People's Guerrilla Group on September 23, 1965. The LC23S' militancy was made up mainly of young disenfranchised university students who saw any opportunity of a peaceful political transformation die in the aftermath of the 1968 student movement and then to be buried in the violent crackdown of 1971. Its long term objective was the ‚Äúelimination of the capitalist system and bourgeois democracy, which would be replaced by a socialist republic and the dictatorship of the proletariat‚Äù. Labeled a terrorist organization by the Mexican authorities, the LC23S engaged in numerous violent attacks, both at what they considered their \\"class enemy\\" (the bourgeoisie) and the authoritarian government of the Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI). At that point, this party had held the presidency for more than 40 years since the end of the Mexican Revolution and, through acts of political corruption, co-opting of opposition and violent repression, had eliminated most political dissent. Although the League saw itself as the vanguard of the proletariat, it never really penetrated in the minds of the workers or peasants. Hundreds of young militants died during that time, with many more still considered missing. Without having a social base in the workers' sphere and with a disbandment of militants who saw an opportunity of activism in the aftermath of the new legal framework, the September 23rd Communist League disappeared at the beginning of the eighties.  Background   Mexican political system   Exhaustion of the Revolutionary Nationalism   Social protests and escalation of the repression  = Tlatelolco Massacre = = Massacre of Corpus Christi = From his earliest days in office, President Luis Echeverr√≠a √Ålvarez announced intentions to reform democracy in Mexico. Students were excited and thought they would have the opportunity to return to the streets to demonstrate discomfort against the government. A conflict at the University of Nuevo Le√≥n gave them an opportunity to test this new freedom. The National Autonomous University of Mexico and National Polytechnic Institute immediately responded and the students called for a massive rally in support of Nuevo Le√≥n on June 10, 1971. The march started at the Casco de Santo Tom√°s, and proceeded through Carpio and Maestros Avenues so the protesters could take the Mexico-Tacuba Causeway, and eventually end up at Z√≥calo. The streets leading to the Maestros Avenue were blocked by police officers and riot police, who did not allow the students to pass. There were tankettes parked along Melchor Ocampo Avenue, near the military school, and riot police trucks in a large police contingent at the intersection of the Melchor Ocampo and San Cosme avenues. A shock group trained by the Federal Security Directorate and the CIA, known as \\"los Halcones\\", who came in grey trucks, vans, and riot trucks, attacked students from streets near Maestros Avenue after the riot police opened their blockade. The shock group first attacked with bamboo and kendo sticks so the students easily repelled them. Los Halcones then attacked the students again, with high-caliber rifles, while students tried, unsuccessfully, to hide. Even though the area was surrounded by police officers, there was no intervention in the clashes. The shooting lasted for several minutes, during which some cars gave logistical support to the paramilitary group. The death toll is controversial, but it is considered to be close to 120 people, in a moderate calculation. = Local repression = Even though, in Mexico City, the social unrest and the following repression that started back in the fifties and sixties greatly influenced the development of subsequent popular movements, in the rest of the country this was not the case. Each state had, in varying degrees, its own expression of authoritarian politics and repression of dissent. While in the northern states, like Sonora and Chihuahua, the government's strategy (in a joined effort with the news media) was that of politically discrediting any form of opposition, in some southern Mexican states like Guerrero, Oaxaca, Michoac√°n, the unsatisfied population had to deal with police repression, kidnappings and death squads. This is the main reason why two of the most important guerrilla organizations of the late sixties appeared in the hills and jungle of Guerrero: the Partido de los Pobres (Party of the Poor, PdlP) and the Asociaci√≥n Civ√≠ca Nacional Revolucionaria (National Revolutionary Civic Association, ACNR). The first one was led by Lucio Caba√±as Barrientos while the latter was led by Genaro V√°zquez Rojas, both of them with a background in rural elementary school teaching (maestros normalistas rurales). By the late sixties and early seventies, there were dozens of armed socialist groups in most of the states of the republic, each created by its own local conditions.  Coordinadora Nacional Guerrillera and the Organizaci√≥n Partidaria  The first person to develop the idea of the unification of the armed organizations at the national level was Ra√∫l Ramos Zavala, who since 1969, by means of texts such as \\"El Proceso Revolucionario en M√©xico, el tiempo que nos toco vivir\\" (The Revolutionary Process in Mexico, the Time We Live), criticized the Mexican Communist Party, considering that it had not been consistent with the political needs of the youth in the face of the 1968 movement, since no formal condemnation was made after the events of the bloody October 2 massacre. Moreover, he argued that socialism would not be achieved through a peaceful means or through collaborations with the State, which was the strategy that had been followed by the PCM, as instructed by the Comintern since the times of the Second World War. Ramos was at that time the national leader of the Juventudes Comunistas (Young Communists) and decided to break with them in 1969. His break with the PCM led many of the young party militants to leave alongside him and create their own political groups. Many of them became armed groups. Ramos Zalava, for his part, founded the group known as \\"Los Procesos\\" (the Processes) from which he sought to integrate the new groups that shared the need for a joint struggle. In one of his trips to his former college, the Autonomous University of Nuevo Le√≥n, he met Ignacio Arturo Salas Obreg√≥n \\"Oseas\\" who was a student leader and, after abandoning the Movimiento Estudiantil Profesional (Professional Student Movement) which followed the lines of Liberation Theology, turned to communism and worked with Ramos in the merging project. With this new organization, briefly called Coordinadora Nacional Guerrillera (National Guerrilla Coordination), they sought to end ideological dispersion and begin joint actions with other organizations to provide \\"political education\\" to the Mexican proletariat in order to construct a revolutionary party and army. However, Ramos was assassinated in February 1972 in Mexico City during a police confrontation. After the death of Ramos Zavala, Ignacio Arturo Salas Obreg√≥n founded the Organizaci√≥n Partidaria (Partisan Organization) in 1972, and wrote texts known as the Madera Viejos, (which are called Madera I, II, III and III-Bis), which developed Ramos Zavala's proposals on unification in a single organization at the national level, systematizing the political approaches that should begin to govern proletarian politics in Mexico. To this end, \\"Oseas\\" made an analysis of the conditions of the workers' struggle in Mexico, as well as the level of the existing relations of production, with the purpose of constructing a theory that would explain and sustain the actions of the organization to which they aspired. These documents were personally delivered by him to the various leaders of existing organizations in Mexico and a first National Meeting was convened on March 15, 1973 in Guadalajara, Jalisco for discussion and analysis. This first National Meeting lasted about 12 days.Testimony by Mario √Ålvaro Cartagena L√≥pez \\"Guaymas\\", former member of the Liga Comunista 23 de Septiembre, who was present at the first National Meeting From this discussion arose the ‚ÄúManifiesto al Proletariado: Questiones basicas del Movimiento Revolucionario, 1973‚Äù (Manifesto to the Proletariat: Basic Issues of the Revolutionary Movement, 1973). This document is better known as \\"Cuestiones\\" (Issues) and is the fundamental document of the League, where it theorizes about its actions, its political position, its strategy, among other things. With this document the ideological foundation for the September 23rd Communist League was set.  Founding organizations  The idea behind the concept of a communist \\"League\\" was to agglomerate all the armed socialist organizations that were active in Mexico. While it was successful in doing so with many small, newly formed and beaten out organizations, it wasn't able to convince bigger organizations like that of Lucio Caba√±as, the Partido de los Pobres (PdlP). Some of the organizations (in no particular order) are the following: * Los Lacandones: Formed from the remnants of the 1968's student movement in Mexico City. They first started acting as an armed organization during 1969, making \\"expropriations\\" in order to maintain their weapon supplies, as well as to pay for food and housing. After a series of successful assaults, six members of the organization are detained, on the 21 of February, 1972. By November of that year, most of the members of the armed group had been detained by the Direcci√≥n Federal de Seguridad (DFS). By February 1973, only three members were still free. After hearing of the unification proposal of Los Procesos, they join the Organizaci√≥n Partidaria. * Los Macias: With a Spartacist (Mexican Marxist school of thought created by Mexican poet Jos√© Revueltas, not to be confused with the German spartacist movement or the American Trostkist organization) background, the organization was created in 1968. It was a splinter from the Movimiento Espartaquista Revolucinario, MER (Spartacist Revolutionary Movement) led by M√≥nico Renter√≠a Medina and active in the state of Durango. After a few \\"expropriation\\", Renter√≠a left the organization and the rest of the group, now led by Eduardo Medina Flores, decided to join the Organizaci√≥n Partidaria. * Los Guajiros: Originally known as the Grupo N (N Group), Conformed, mainly, by young people of northern origin (Baja California, Chihuahua, Durango, etc.) and started performing military actions in 1970. They were one of the first organization to get in touch with other national groups (like the PdlP and the Procesos). They were named \\"Guajiros\\" by Lucio Caba√±as. After a series of successful \\"expropriations\\", by 1972 the armed group suffered huge casualties, including that of their leader, Diego Lucero. The remnants of the organization joined the LC23S. * Los Procesos: A splinter from the Juventudes Comunistas (Communist Youth), its main leader was Ra√∫l Ramos Zavala, a student from the Universidad Aut√≥noma de Nuevo Le√≥n. It was the first group to come up with the idea of creating a \\"federation\\" of armed groups that would work in coordination throughout the country. Like the Guajiros, they had a series of successful \\"expropriation\\" actions, which later resulted in enormous casualties. Ramos Zavala was executed on February 6, 1972. * Grupo 23 de Septiembre: * Los Enfermos (The Sick Ones): The radical wing of the Autonomous University of Sinaloa‚Äôs Students Federation. Its aims and goals shifted from academic objectives to more broad, social issues. * Los Vikingos (The Vikings): Sometimes described as a gang, los Vikingos was a group of young people from a neighborhood in Guadalajara who, through the influence of liberal politicians, socially conscious Catholic priests and communist sympathizers, got involved in social and university activism. They would join the LC23S and become one of their main suppliers of guns and ammo. * Movimiento 23 de Septiembre: * A splinter section of the Movimiento de Acci√≥n Revolucionaria, MAR (Revoluctionary Action Movement): Created in 1969 in Moscow, by students affiliated to the Mexican Communist Party. They got military and political education in North Korea. After being crushed by the security forces, a small splinter section would later join the LC23S. * MAR-23 de Septiembre: Some of the surviving members of the MAR organization decided to separate from their main group, and join forces with the Movimiento 23 de Septiembre. They will later join the LC23S. * A section of the Movimiento Estudiantil Profesional, MEP (the Professional Student Movement): A group of radical catholic students who, at first, were active in different social causes and later became convinced that real changed would only be achieved through revolutionary actions. * A section of the Frente Estudiantil Revolucionario, FER (Student Revolutionary Front): First appeared in the Universidad de Guadalajara in 1972, as a response to the political violence that was taking place. It disputed the political control of the university with the Federaci√≥n de Estudiantes de Guadalajara (Guadalajara's Students Union).  History  Many researchers give the existence of the LC23S a timeline that goes from the early months of 1973 to later months of 1974. This first proposal is one of the mostly widely accepted ones and characterizes the LC23S for their proactive offensive strategy, where expropriations (bank robberies), police killings, propaganda distribution and clashes with the security services were common. It is also marked by the death of many of the top founding commanders, including their main leader, Ignacio Arturo Salas Obreg√≥n (AKA Oseas). Others place 1976 as the final frontier of the organization, in an attempt to provide an alternative to the first timeline. This timeline places the end of the League after the failed kidnapping attempt of the sister of the Mexican president-elect, Margarita Lopez Portillo, and the death of Oseas successor, David Jim√©nez Sarmiento (El Chano). A third position says that its historical horizon reaches the year 1982 when Miguel √Ångel Barraza Garc√≠a (Aka El Piojo Negro, The Black Louse), the last national leader of the Liga, falls in combat and the last number of the newsletter Madera is published. This is due to the fact that even though, by 1976, casualties were high and the persecution by the Mexican government was at its strongest point, there was never a complete crackdown of the National Directive (Coordinadora Nacional). According to records by the Direcci√≥n Federal de Seguridad (DFS, Mexican secret police), as well as interviews to former members of the organization, by 1981 recruitment of new militants was still taking place throughout the country, especially at university campuses and rural teacher schools (Escuelas Normales). This last timeline is marked by a more defensive and reactive strategy than the more proactive and offensive one which they started with in 1973.  Formative and offensive stage (1972‚Äì1974)  On May 15, 1973, as part of a joint effort by several armed organizations in the country, the September 23rd Communist League was formed. It is the only guerrilla organization in Mexico, created in the seventies, which came to be considered as an actual internal threat to national stability, due in part to the large number of militants they had, as well as to the extent of the territory in which they had presence. Despite being made up by workers and peasants, the largest part of its members belonged to the student sector. Their short term objective was divided in two: First, the formation of a national union of armed organizations, which should work around the ideological and political ideas that National Directive established. The second part, once the homogenization process was completed, consisted of the creation of a vanguard party (in accordance with Leninist theory), which should be strong enough to guide the workers and peasants through the revolutionary process. In this sense, the LC23S never considered itself a full fledged party, but a transitional step towards it. Several groups, from different places and with different backgrounds, decided to join the project: Los Lacandones; Los Macias; Los Guajiros; Los Procesos, part of the Student Revolutionary Front (Frente Estudiantil Revolucionario, FER) of Guadalajara; the radical wing of the Autonomous University of Sinaloa's Students Federation, known as Los Enfermos (the sick ones); MAR-23; the Professional Student Movement (Movimiento Estudiantil Profesional, MEP); Grupo 23 de Septiembre; as well as several small groups without previous partisan organization or militancy. Through pints, pamphlets and the distribution of its own publication, Madera, peri√≥dico clandestino, they intended to make visible their political program, as well as to recruit new members. The organization was present in at least twenty of the thirty-two states that form the United Mexican States.  Defensive stage (1974‚Äì1976)  Even before the death of Ignacio Arturo Salas Obreg√≥n, the internal divisions within the League had started to show. After the disappearance of their main leader, the process of polarization and division within the LC23S exacerbated, leading to accusations of infiltration, treason, revisionism, bourgeois opportunism, militarism, etc. The accusations escalated to a point where executions supposed police infiltrators were carried out. Many of the militants separated themselves from the organization and continued working either within the legal political system or through new armed organizations. David Jimenez Sarmiento picked up the leadership of the organization during this time. This stage is marked by a more militaristic approach, which left the political activity on a secondary plane. It ended with the failed kidnapping attempt of the sister of the Mexican president-elect, Margarita Lopez Portillo. The purpose of this action was to gain leverage, catch public attention and request the liberation of political prisoners. The failed kidnapping attempt provoked many casualties, including Sarmiento, and left the leadership of the organization in the hands of the editorial committee of the Madera newsletter.  Survival stage (1976‚Äì1979)  After the death of David Jimenez Sarmiento, the increased violence put forward by the security forces, and the changing political landscape, the LC23S went through a restructuring and self-criticism process. During this time, their military activities diminished, focusing mainly on political actions and propaganda distribution. Great numbers of the newsletter Madera were distributed around the country. The main leader of the organization during the first have of this stage (1976‚Äì1979) was Luis Miguel Corral Garc√≠a, El Piojo Blanco (The White Louse). During this time, the government, in a joint effort by the DFS, Departamento de Investigaciones Politicas y Sociales (DGIPS, Political and Social Investigations Department), the army and Mexico City's police, created the Brigada Especial (Especial Brigade) or Brigada Blanca (White Brigade) as was known by the population. Created June 7, 1976, under the project Plan de Aniquilamiento de la Liga Comunista 23 de Septiembre (Plan of Annihilation of the Communist League September 23) the BE worked essentially as a paramilitary organization. Its main objective was to physically and politically destroy the League and, in order to do so, it came up with two strategies: The Campa√±a de orientaci√≥n al p√∫blico contra la Liga Comunista 23 de Septiembre (Public orientation campaign against the Communist League September 23) and the Plan de Operaciones No.1 Rastreo (Operations Plan No. 1. Tracking). The first one consisted on psychological warfare, while the latter one in political violence.  Extinction stage (1979‚Äì1982)  While on the one hand the LC23S was suffering casualties thanks to the BE, on the other side, the Political Reform (Ley Federal de Organizaciones Pol√≠ticas y Procesos Electorales, LFOPPE) of 1977 was the final blow to the organization. Said law opened a small political space to the opposition, as well as permitted once again the legal participation of the Mexican Communist Party in national and local elections. This, effectively, destroyed the foundation in which the League had built its militancy: the lack of democracy and political competition in Mexico. During this time Miguel √Ångel Barraza Garc√≠a (El Piojo Negro) was the main leader. Although the political and military activity (propaganda distribution and ‚Äúexpropriations‚Äù) were still taking place, they were in a much smaller size than years before. This did not mean a diminishing in the activities of the Especial Brigade, who intensified their annihilation strategy. The Especial Brigadre had started an infiltration strategy, which consisted in getting jobs at factories and waiting for members of the LC23S to go there and hand out propaganda. At that point, the BE would start shooting to the brigade, without any attempts of making an arrest. On January 24, 1981, near Ciudad Universitaria (Universidad Nacional Autonoma de M√©xico), Barraza was killed, leaving the National Directive directionless. The last issue of Madera was published later that year. Without its main leader, the LC23S slowly dismantled, with some of its members joining the legal activism, while others remained clandestine.  Aftermath  On On September 23, 2019, speaking on behalf of the Presidency of Andr√©s Manuel L√≥pez Obrador, Interior Secretary Olga S√°nchez Cordero apologized to Martha Camacho Loaiza, the wife of a leader of the Liga Comunista 23 de septiembre, who was tortured in 1977. The apology took place in the Centro Cultural Tlatelolco, scene of the October 2, 1968 student massacre. This follows a fake investigation by the Presidency of Vicente Fox which ended in charges of genocide against former president Luis Echeverr√≠a being dropped.

Stone based the character of Ray Hicks on Beat writer Neal Cassady, with whom Stone became acquainted through novelist Ken Kesey, a graduate school classmate of Stone's at Stanford University. Hicks' death scene on the railroad tracks at the film's conclusion is directly based on Cassady's death along a railroad track outside of San Miguel de Allende, Mexico, in 1968. The hippie commune setting, where lights and stereo speakers placed throughout the woods are utilized in Hicks' escape plan, is partially based on Kesey's home in La Honda, California, where Kesey and his friends -- known as the Merry Pranksters -- famously wired the surrounding woods with lights and sound equipment to enhance their experiments with LSD. Although technically not a commune, Kesey's home was a frequent site for large parties attended by a mixture of literary luminaries such as poet Allen Ginsberg and journalist Hunter S. Thompson, music figures (including Jerry Garcia, whose group The Grateful Dead later became the house band for Kesey's famous Acid Tests), and outlaws, especially members of the infamous Hells Angels motorcycle club. These parties are described intimately in works by Ginsberg and Thompson, and in Tom Wolfe's book The Electric Kool-Aid Acid Test (1968). Ken Kesey, his Merry Pranksters, and Neal Cassady are also discussed in detail in Martin Torgoff's book Can't Find My Way Home. The Saigon scenes were filmed on a set in Mexico. There was a casting advertisement in Mexico City for people of any Asian background to represent the Vietnamese.

The bird has a distinctive yellow-tipped red bill and red frontal shield. Its first account was written in 1888 by the polar explorer George Comer, whom the specific name comeri commemorates. This bird is found only on two remote islands in the South Atlantic. The Gough moorhen was originally endemic to Gough Island, but in 1956 was introduced to Tristan da Cunha, an island in the same archipelago which was formerly home of the now extinct Tristan moorhen (Galinula nesiotis). On the basis of DNA sequencing of both recently collected and historical material from both of the archipelago's moorhen species, Groenenberg et al (2008) concluded that the genetic distances between G. nesiotis and G. comeri are of at least the same size as those found between subspecies of common moorhen (G. chloropus) in the literature. They propose that the extinct moorhen of Tristan (G. nesiotis) and the moorhens that live on Gough and Tristan today (G. comeri) be regarded as subspecies.Groenenberg, D.S.J., Beintema, A,J., Dekker, R.W.R.J. & E.

In the mid-1990s, it was estimated that 2,500 breeding pairs existed on Gough Island. Gough Island is considered the least disturbed, major, cool-temperate island ecosystem in the South Atlantic Ocean and hosts one of the most important sea-bird colonies in the world, containing 54 bird species, 22 breeding species, and four threatened species.

The character was created by writer Charlie Huston and penciler David Finch, and first appeared in Moon Knight (Vol. 3) #2 (July 2006) in the second chapter of \\"The Bottom\\". Fictional character biography In \\"The Bottom\\", The Profile has been hired by The New Committee to assist them in their plans to turn Moon Knight into their personal assassin. Detached and somewhat amoral, he seems dismissive of Moon Knight as a hero. His plan was to injure Frenchie at some point in the future, but the committee strikes too soon and the plot reinvigorates a broken Moon Knight.Moon Knight vol 3, issue 3 In a later occasion, Moon Knight has leaned on the Profile for help in finding his sidekick-turned-enemy Midnight.Moon Knight vol 3 #11 The Profile has attempted to further curry favor with Marc Spector by giving him advice on how to win back his girlfriend Marlene. He also aided Moon Knight by providing information that terrified a SHIELD psychologist into approving Spector's registration as a superhero, but later he bailed one of the Whyos out of jail and the gang member was soon seen in the employ of Norman Osborn. Moon Knight Vol. 3 Issue23 During the Dark Reign storyline where he is brought by The Hood (in the presence of Norman Osborn) to help him in the hunting of Marc Spector.Vengeance of the Moon Knight #2 During the Shadowland storyline, Daredevil (who had just became the leader of the Hand) hires Profile to fight Moon Knight. He is assisted in this task by a second avatar of Khonshu.Shadowland: Moon Knight #1 It turns out that the second avatar of Khonshu that's helping Profile is actually Moon Knight's brother Randall Spector in the alias of Shadow Knight (comics).Shadowland: Moon Knight #2 Powers and abilities The Profile is able to divine people's backgrounds and identify character traits and preferences simply by looking at them. This allows him to accurately predict their reactions to a variety of situations. Moon Knight (Vol. 4) #4 suggested that he may be a mutant and confirms that he is not immune to his own powers. In an interview regarding Marvel's Shadowland crossover, writer Greg Hurwitz characterized the nature of the Profile's powers as that of \\"... a brilliant, on-the-spot psychologist who can profile anyone he looks at...\\". However, in the Heroic Age: Villains special, he was implied to perhaps indeed be a mutant with the ability \\"...to see anyone's needs, wants, and desires...\\". His true status has yet to be confirmed at this time. The Profile's power manifests as almost-psychedelic art and words surrounding a person, identifying their secrets, idiosyncrasies and other traits similar to a virtual-reality interface. His eyes seemed to be physically identifiable as \\"mutated\\" in his original appearance, but have since not been shown as such. Although his powers are useful against humans, mutants, science experiments, and technology-powered superheroes, the Profile's accuracy is seriously compromised by genuine supernatural influence, such as that of Moon Knight's patron Khonshu. When Marc Spector donned his Moon Knight vestments, The Profile was stricken with fear when looking at him, but could read him like a book when in his civilian attire/identity.

Typically, the system includes 2 Type 347G fire-control radar with optical director, and 4 Type 76A guns. They're used on the Luda, Luhu, Luhai, Jiangwei class surface warships, as well as the Houjian, Houxin, and Haiging class patrol boats. Development Development for an air defense radar system begun in July 1974, with design finalized in August 1975, consisted of two radars, the 1st being a search radar designated as Type 347S with S stands for search, and a 2nd fire control radar for guns, designated as Type 347G with G as gun. Design was completed by the 723rd Institute in May 1976 and finalized in October 1977. In the 1980s, China imported the OTOBreda (now OTO-Melara) Twin Fast Forty AAA and Selenia (now AMS) SPG-74 (RTN-20X) fire control system from Italy for evaluation. Although the Chinese navy didn't deploy the twin-40mm AAA, there are some similarities between the Type 347 and the SPG-74 radar, leading some commentators to claim that the Type 347 is based on SPG-74 technology. Subsystems tests on land were completed by the end of 1982. After further tests from November 1986 to September 1987, the system was accepted into service, and Type 347G radar subsequently renamed as Type 347 radar. The distinct recognition characteristic of the Type 347 radar is the inverse cassegrain antenna with twisted polarization. Type 347 radar is frequently but erroneously referred by many as either Type 349 or Type 348, because externally, all three radars look very similar, and all three are developed as fire control radar for small caliber guns. In reality, the three radars are different and they can be easily distinguished by the following features: When electro-optics (EO) are integrated with radar, EO is installed on the portside of Type 347 radar antenna, but for Type 348 and Type 349, EO is installed on the starboard side of the radar antenna. Furthermore, when incorporated as part of CIWS, Type 349 is slaved to Type 730 CIWS gun and thus does not rotate, because the gun rotates when searching/tracking. In contrast, Type 348 is not slaved to the Type 76 37mm twin guns, but instead, installed separately from the gun mounts, and thus Type 348 rotates when searching/tracking. The shape of antenna is also an important visual cue to distinguish three radars. The tip of Type 349 radar is a conical, which is missing on Type 347. Instead, the tip of Type 347 radar antenna is a small circular flat surface, missing the tip of the cone. The antenna of Type 348 radar differs from both Type 347 and Type 349 radars in that most of the cone is missing, only the base remains, so the antenna of Type 348 radar has a very large circular flat surface, resulting in Type 348 radar resembles a scaled down version of another larger fire control radar for larger caliber guns (76 mm or greater), Type 344.

The park contains a museum, a number of historic sites, an underground archeology exhibit displaying the excavated foundations of the Tubac Presidio, and a picnic area. Various cultural events are held on-site throughout the year, including Anza Days (October), Los Tubaque√±os living history presentations (Sundays from October through March), archeological tours, and nature walks. Until recently, the park was administered by Arizona State Parks and was the first park in the Arizona state park system. As a result of budget cutbacks, the Tubac Presidio was scheduled to be closed in 2010, but was rescued by local residents and the Tubac Historical Society. It is now operated by The Friends of the Presidio and staffed with dedicated volunteers.For even more information about Tubac Presidio State Historic Park, visit their official website or join the discussion on Facebook! History As the Spanish Empire attempted to expand into the frontiers of New Spain, Catholic missions were established throughout modern-day Mexico and the southwestern United States. Of these many churches, one was established at nearby Tumac√°cori in 1691 and Tubac, then a small Pima Indian village, was set up as a mission farm and ranch. Spanish colonists started to colonize the area in the 1730s; twenty years later the Pimas, led by Luis of Saric, led an uprising against the Spanish in 1751 and the settlement at Tubac was destroyed. A year later, the Pimas surrendered and the Presidio San Ignacio de Tubac was established to protect the town and the surrounding area from further rebellion. Tubac became the first European settlement in what today is the state of Arizona. Reenactment of the arrival of de Anza at Tubac, Arizona during Anza Days at Tubac Presidio State Historic Park. Threatened by the establishment of a Russian fort immediately north of the San Francisco Bay area, the Spanish sent Juan Bautista de Anza to establish an overland route to and a presidio and mission in the San Francisco area. The expedition passed through Tubac in early 1774. In 1776, the Tubac garrison was moved north to Tucson, leaving Tubac undefended against Apache raids. As a result, the presidio was reactivated in 1787 with Pima\\\\O'odham Indian troops and Spanish officers. Tubac became part of an independent Mexico in 1821 and then part of the United States in 1854 as a result of the Gadsden Purchase. With the arrival of the Americans came Charles D. Poston, who established the Sonora Exploring and Mining Company in Tubac. Poston performed marriages, granted divorces, officiated baptisms, printed his own money to pay his employees, and even established Arizona's first newspaper in 1859. The following year, Tubac became the largest town in the state. The prosperity was not to last, however, as the area's soldiers were called away to fight in the American Civil War. The town was again unprotected from the Apaches. The routing of the railroad through Tucson to the north and the discovery of silver around Tombstone to the east meant that Tubac would never regain its importance. Park facilities and events The centerpiece of the exhibits at Tubac Presidio State Historic Park is the underground display of the presidio's foundations. Excavated in 1974 by archeologists from the University of Arizona, portions of the presidio's foundation and walls can be viewed by visitors. Visitors may also enter the furnished 1885 schoolhouse, complete with desks, chalkboards, and a potbelly stove. Other buildings on site include the 1914 Otero Hall, which houses exhibitions, a visitor center, the Rojas House, occupied by the same family for about one hundred years, and a museum with displays from the various historic periods of settlement in Tubac, including American Indian (pre-1752), Spanish Colonial (1752-1821), Mexican Republic (1821-1854), and Anglo Territorial (1854-1912). Adjacent to the park grounds is St. Ann's Church, which was built on the ruins of the former Igl√©sia de Santa Gertrudis, and the trailhead of the Tubac-to-Tumac√°cori portion of the Juan Bautista de Anza National Historic Trail. Every October, the park hosts Anza Days to commemorate the arrival of Juan Bautista de Anza at the Tubac Presidio. Costumed actors on horseback arrive from nearby Tumac√°cori and discuss de Anza's trip to San Francisco. Other presentations at the weekend event include actor portrayals of the time periods during which Tubac has been active as well as mariachi music and cowboy rope tricks.

Gaoh was described as a cannibal and a giant who could uproot trees. He takes the form of a solitary old man. Gaoh is subservient to the Great Spirit, and in Iroquois mythology he is subservient to Adekagagwaa. Gaoh is mostly a benevolent spirit, but can be restless and violent, and would create storms. Depending on the myths, he either lives in a house in the sky, or a mountain cave called \\"the House of Winds.\\" From his home, he controls the seasons, and also winds of the four cardinal directions: Ya-o-gah, Bear of the north wind, Da-jo-ji, Panther of the west wind, O-yan-do-ne, Moose of the east wind and Ne-o-gah, Fawn of the south wind. Some versions of the myths describe the winds as the guardians of Gaoh's home, while others describe the winds being locked up in his home, who were to be released once Gaoh receives the order from the Great Spirit. In the Seneca version of the myth, Gaoh is chained to a rock, and winds would blow when he attempts to break free. Once he is tired and resting, the winds would become quiet.

Remnants of the Amarillo Helium Plant in 2015 The National Helium Reserve, also known as the Federal Helium Reserve, is a strategic reserve of the United States holding over 1 billion cubic meters (109 m3) of helium gas. The helium is stored at the Cliffside Storage Facility about northwest of Amarillo, Texas, in a natural geologic gas storage formation, the Bush Dome The National Helium Reserve and related media at History.com; retrieved December 9, 2013 reservoir. The reserve was established with the enactment of the Helium Act of 1925. The strategic supply provisioned the noble gas for airships, and in the 1950s became an important source of coolant during the Cold War and Space Race. The facilities were located close to the Hugoton and other natural gas fields in southwest Kansas and the panhandle of Oklahoma, plus the Panhandle Field in Texas.Pierce, A.P., Gott, G.B., and Mytton, J.W., Uranium and Helium in the Panhandle Gas Field Texas, and Adjacent Areas,Geological Survey Professional Paper 454-G, Washington:US Government Printing Office, 1964. These fields contain natural gas with unusually high percentages of helium‚Äîfrom 0.3% to 2.7%‚Äîand constitute the United States' largest helium source. The helium is separated as a byproduct from the produced natural gas. After the Helium Acts Amendments of 1960 (Public Law 86‚Äì666), the U.S. Bureau of Mines arranged for five private plants to recover helium from natural gas. For this helium conservation program, the Bureau built a pipeline from Bushton, Kansas, to connect those plants with the government's partially depleted Cliffside gas field. This helium-nitrogen mixture was injected and stored in the Cliffside gas field until needed, when it then was further purified. By 1995, a billion cubic metres of the gas had been collected, and the reserve was US$1.4 billion in debt, prompting Congress to begin phasing out the reserve in 1996.Emsley, John.

Early life Chittenden was born in Williston, Vermont, the son of Giles (1790-1856) and Betsey (Hollenbeck) Chittenden. He was the grandson of Truman Chittenden (1770-1853), and the great-grandson of Vermont's first governor, Thomas Chittenden. Lucius Chittenden received his early education in the district schools of Williston and academies in Williston, Hinesburg and Cambridge. He studied law with several attorneys, and was admitted to the bar in Franklin County in 1844. He opened a law office in Burlington the next year. Politics He became interested in politics and public affairs early in his career, gained prominence in the anti-slavery movement and the Free Soil Party, and published from 1848 to 1851, with E. A. Stansbury, the \\"Free Soil Courier.\\" After helping Democrat John S. Robinson get elected governor in 1852, he became active in the newly formed Republican Party. He was elected state senator from Chittenden County, and served from 1856 to 1860, while also serving as president of the Commercial Bank in Burlington. Civil War In February, 1861 Governor Erastus Fairbanks appointed Chittenden one of five Vermont delegates to the Washington Peace Conference, which met to try avert the start of the American Civil War. The other delegates were former Governor Hiland Hall, Levi Underwood, Horace Henry Baxter, and Broughton Harris. Chittenden was selected as recorder of the conference, and published its records in 1864. In March 1861, President Lincoln's new Secretary of the Treasury, Salmon P. Chase, who had also been a member of the Free Soil Party, offered Chittenden the position of Register of the U.S. Treasury. Chittenden accepted, and served for most of Lincoln's first term until resigning in 1864 due to poor health. During his term at the Treasury Department, Chittenden attracted notice when he worked to the point of exhaustion in order to ensure that a bond issue required to finance the Union war effort could be issued on time. The 12,500 bond certificates needed to be sent to England by steamship so they could be sold, and each certificate required Chittenden's signature. As a result, Chittenden stayed at his desk and signed certificates continuously over three days until the task was complete, ensuring that they could be shipped on time. Chittenden injured his hand and wrist in this work, which prompted him to resign as Register. Chittenden was also credited with bringing to Lincoln's attention the case of William Scott, a Vermont soldier sentenced to death for sleeping on guard duty, and for whom Lincoln interceded by issuing a pardon. The event became part of Lincoln lore as the story of The Sleeping Sentinel, and Chittenden later published his account of the event. Later life When he resigned from the Lincoln administration, he returned to Vermont to regain his health, but by 1866 was living in Tarrytown, New York, and practicing law in New York City while spending summers in Burlington. He returned to Burlington permanently in 1894, and died at the home of his daughter on July 22, 1900. He was buried at Lakeview Cemetery in Burlington. Family Chittenden was married to Mary Hatch in 1856, and she died in 1894. They were the parents of three children: Horace H. became an attorney in New York City; Mary H. was the wife of William Bradford and a resident of Burlington; and Bessie B., the wife of Rev.

During his tenure from 1990 until his death in 2011, the Mir Yeshiva grew into the largest yeshiva in Israel with nearly 6,000 undergraduate students and over 1,600 avreichim (married students). According to one estimate, he taught 25,000 students over his lifetime. Although he suffered from Parkinson's disease for the last 28 years of his life,Finkel and Heimowitz (2012), p. 433. experiencing involuntary spasms and slurred speech, he did not let his illness stop him from learning Torah for long hours, delivering regular shiurim (lectures), and fund-raising for his yeshiva around the world. He raised an estimated US$500 million for the Mir during his tenure as rosh yeshiva.Donn, Yochonon. \\"'My Everyman Brother-in-Law Who Became a Gadol'\\". Hamodia, 17 November 2011, p. C3, C6. He was a member of the Moetzes Gedolei HaTorah of Degel HaTorah. He was known for his Torah erudition and his warmth and concern for his students. Early life Rav Nosson Tzvi Finkel was born in Chicago, Illinois to Rabbi Eliyahu Meir Finkel and his wife, Sara Rosenblum, who ran a kosher catering business. His paternal grandfather, Rabbi Avraham Shmuel Finkel, was a mashgiach ruchani at the Hebron yeshiva in Israel,Finkel and Heimowitz (2012), p. 33. and his paternal great-grandfather was the Alter of Slabodka, Rabbi Nosson Tzvi Finkel, after whom he was named. He had one brother, Gedaliah, who now teaches at the Mir yeshiva. After his parents immigrated to Israel in 1973,Finkel and Heimowitz (2012), p. 62. his mother published a best-selling kosher cookbook. Reb Finkel grew up as a \\"typical American Jewish boy\\" who enjoyed playing basketball and baseball. He was known as Nathan in school and Natie to his friends.Finkel and Heimowitz (2012), p. 41. He was one of the first students of the Central Park Hebrew Day School (later renamed Arie Crown Day School) and received after-school tutoring in Torah studies from Rabbi Yehoshua Levinson.Finkel and Heimowitz (2012), p. 40, 42, 170. In 1957, at the age of 14, he accompanied his parents on a trip to Israel to visit the holy sites and his father's family. His great-uncle, Rabbi Eliezer Yehuda Finkel (\\"Reb Leizer Yudel\\"), the Mir rosh yeshiva, recognized his ability to think clearly and have patience for studying, and asked his parents to let him stay and study in his yeshiva. Finkel remained at the Mir for eight months, studying with top-notch chavrutas (study partners) to develop his skills.Finkel and Heimowitz (2012), pp. 45-47. He returned to Chicago to take his secondary education at the co-ed, Modern Orthodox Ida Crown Jewish Academy, where he was president of the student council and a starting centerfielder for the baseball team. At the age of 17, Finkel returned to Jerusalem to learn at the Mir under the guidance of his great-uncle.Finkel and Heimowitz (2012), p. 179. He learned diligently for the next six years. With one of his chavrutas, Rabbi Zundel Kroizer, he completed the entire Talmud each year. In the summer of 1964Finkel and Heimowitz (2012), p. 205. Finkel married Reb Leizer Yudel's granddaughter, Leah, his second cousin and the eldest daughter of Rabbi Binyomin Beinush Finkel, who was his father's first cousin. He and his wife had 11 children. He continued to learn with chavrutas at all hours, stopping at 2 a.m.;\\"Sar V'gadol Nafal B' Yisrael (A Prince and Great Person Fell in Israel)\\". Hamodia, 10 November 2011, p. C6. his wife would bring their children to visit him at the yeshiva so he wouldn't have to take the time to walk home. He also began delivering shiurim in the yeshiva, which was headed by his father-in-law after the death of Reb Leizer Yudel in 1965.Finkel and Heimowitz (2012), p. 227. Upon the death of his father-in-law on 13 February 1990,Finkel and Heimowitz (2012), p. 329. Finkel was named rosh yeshiva of the Mir together with Rabbi Refoel Shmuelevitz (son of former Mir rosh yeshiva Rabbi Chaim Leib Shmuelevitz). Finkel took on the financial responsibility for the yeshiva. Growth of the Mir Rabbi Nosson Tzvi Finkel (center, in wheelchair) participates in a Simchat Beit HaShoeivah at the Mir in 2006. When Reb Finkel first came to the Mir at the age of 17 in 1960, enrollment was less than 200 students, of which 75 percent were avreichim (married students) and 25 percent were undergraduates. When he became rosh yeshiva in 1990, enrollment stood at approximately 1,200 students.Finkel and Heimowitz (2012), p. 185. At the time of his death, enrollment reached nearly 6,000 undergraduates and over 1,600 avreichim. This growth is credited to Finkel's open-door policy as rosh yeshiva: whoever wished to learn at the Mir was welcome. Enrollment now includes Litvish, Hasidic, Ashkenazi, Sephardi and baalei teshuva students from Israel, the United States and Europe. Rav Nosson Tzvi Finkel speaking To accommodate the ever-increasing enrollment, Finkel fund-raised for and constructed four new buildings in addition to the original yeshiva building constructed by Reb Leizer Yudel in 1949. He assigned separate battei medrash (study halls) for each group of students, making one for Israeli students, one for Americans, one for those who wished to study without a daily shiur, and so on. As enrollment continued to climb, several students of the main maggidei shiur (lecturers) began delivering shiurim in English, and Finkel raised the funds to open a new beis medrash in 2006 for these shiurim too. Yet another beis medrash was built in recent years. The Mir also opened a yeshiva gedola for Israeli students in the Brachfeld neighborhood of Modi'in IllitFinkel and Heimowitz (2012), pp. 345-348. where Finkel gave shiurim and occasional shmuessen (musar talks), and a yeshiva ketana in the Ramat Shlomo neighborhood of Jerusalem. In an unusual move for a Litvish yeshiva, Finkel accepted 800 Hasidic students and allowed them to learn in their own chabura and follow their own customs, including a fartug (pre-dawn study session) before morning prayers. This group, known as Chaburas Ameilim BaTorah (the \\"Toiling in Torah\\" Study Group), was housed in a different neighborhood, but the week before his death, Finkel moved them onto Mir yeshiva premises. He participated in their Thursday-night study sessions as well as their seudot mitzvah (festival meals) marking a siyum, and Hanukkah parties.\\"Hagaon Harav Nosson Tzvi Finkel, zt\\"l: Leader of thousands, rebbi to each one\\". Hamodia, 10 November 2011, pp. A20, A26. Notwithstanding the Mir's huge enrollment, Finkel tried to remember the name of each student. He also remembered personal details about each of his alumni and donors abroad. His brother-in-law, Rabbi Aharon Lopiansky, rosh yeshiva of the Yeshiva of Greater Washington, said that at Mir dinners, 1,000 people could be waiting to speak with the rosh yeshiva, \\"and almost every single one on the line was someone he had had a personal connection with\\". Despite his busy schedule, Finkel also expressed a willingness to learn in chavruta with any student who asked. It was estimated that he studied with approximately 80 people every week.Finkel and Heimowitz (2012), pp. 277-278, 281. Like his great-uncle Reb Leizer Yudel, Finkel offered cash incentives for Torah study, challenging his students to learn many pages of Talmud and study for large blocks of time. He regularly hosted siyums for students in his own home and at his own expense.Finkel and Heimowitz (2012), pp. 258-264. Finkel shouldered the responsibility for raising funds for this giant Torah enterprise. Despite his disease and its side effects, he traveled twice a year to England and the United States. In the past two years, the economic recession saw the yeshiva's debts mounting quicker than they were being met, with salaries and kollel stipends running months behind. Finkel was said to be very upset by this state of affairs. Illness Reb Finkel was diagnosed with Parkinson's disease in the late 1980s. Though he experienced much difficulty in walking and talking, and suffered from involuntary tremors and spasms and slurred speech, he continued to learn for hours every day and gave regular shiurim in the yeshiva, as well as embarked on regular fund-raising trips abroad. In later years, when he felt too weak to sit in a chair during the chaburas (small-group learning sessions) that he organized for students in his home, he would lie down on a couch and encourage the students to begin the session. He refused to take medication for his condition, since the drugs could make his mind foggy or cause memory loss and he didn't want to risk forgetting his Torah studies. He only took medication that provided temporary relief from his symptoms.Finkel and Heimowitz (2012), p. 439. Death At 6 a.m. in his home on November 8, 2011 (11 Cheshvan 5772), Finkel suddenly lost consciousness. EMS personnel attempted to revive him for 50 minutes while students of the Mir stood outside in the street praying for him. His personal doctor summoned to the home determined that he had died of cardiac arrest. An estimated 100,000 peopleFinkel and Heimowitz (2012), p. 448. attended his funeral, which began at the Mir yeshiva in Beit Yisrael and continued on foot to Har HaMenuchot, where he was buried next to Rabbi Chaim Shmuelevitz, a former rosh yeshiva of the Mir, and close by the graves of Reb Leizer Yudel and Rabbi Binyomin Beinish Finkel. The Edah HaChareidis ordered all Haredi businesses to close during the funeral, and Litvishe Torah leaders Rabbi Yosef Shalom Eliashiv and Aharon Leib Shteinman instructed teachers and students of Talmud Torahs, yeshivas, and kollels to join the funeral procession. The procession blocked the entrance to the city and halted operations of the Jerusalem Light Rail, as tens of thousands of mourners blocked the tracks on the Jerusalem Chords Bridge en route to the cemetery. Rav Finkel's death was a double blow for the Jerusalem Litvish yeshiva world, coming one day after the death of Rabbi Dov Schwartzman, another respected Litvish rosh yeshiva in Jerusalem. Rabbi Finkel participated in Rabbi Schwartzman's funeral on 7 November. At the funeral it was announced that Finkel's eldest son, Rabbi Eliezer Yehuda Finkel, would succeed his father as rosh yeshiva.

It may also be used, as part of post exposure prophylaxis, to prevent HIV infection following potential exposure. It is taken by mouth. Common side effects include trouble sleeping, feeling tired, nausea, high blood sugar, and headaches. Severe side effects may include allergic reactions including Stevens‚ÄìJohnson syndrome, muscle breakdown, and liver problems. It is unclear if use during pregnancy or breastfeeding is safe. Raltegravir is an HIV integrase strand transfer inhibitor which blocks the functioning of HIV integrase which is needed for viral replication. Raltegravir was approved for medical use in the United States in 2007. It is on the World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines, the safest and most effective medicines needed in a health system. Lamivudine/raltegravir, a combination with lamivudine, is also available. Medical uses Isentress tablets Raltegravir was initially approved only for use in individuals whose infection has proven resistant to other HAART drugs. However, in July 2009, the FDA granted expanded approval for raltegravir for use in all patients. As with any HAART medication, raltegravir is unlikely to show durability if used as monotherapy, due to the highly mutagenic nature of HIV. Raltegravir is taken orally twice daily. In December 2011, it approval for use in children over the age of two, taken in pill form orally twice a day by prescription with two other antiretroviral medications to form the cocktail (most anti-HIV drugs regimens for adults and children use these cocktails). Raltegravir is available in chewable form, but because the two tablet formulations are not interchangeable, the chewable pills are only approved for use in children two to 11. Older adolescents will use the adult formulation. Efficacy In a study of the drug as part of combination therapy, raltegravir exhibited potent and durable antiretroviral activity similar to that of efavirenz at 24 and 48 weeks but achieved HIV-1 RNA levels below detection at a more rapid rate. After 24 and 48 weeks of treatment, raltegravir did not result in increased serum levels of total cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, or triglycerides. Side effects Raltegravir was generally well tolerated when used in combination with optimized background therapy regimens in treatment- experienced patients with HIV-1 infection in trials of up to 48 weeks' duration. Mechanism of action As an integrase inhibitor, raltegravir targets integrase, enzyme common to retroviruses that integrates the viral genetic material into human chromosomes, a critical step in the HIV infection model. The drug is metabolized away via glucuronidation. History Raltegravir was the first integrase inhibitor to receive approval in the United States. Research Raltegravir significantly alters HIV viral dynamics and decay and further research in this area is ongoing. In clinical trials patients taking raltegravir achieved viral loads less than 50 copies per millitre sooner than those taking similarly potent non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors or protease inhibitors. This statistically significant difference in viral load reduction has caused some HIV researchers to begin questioning long held paradigms about HIV viral dynamics and decay. Research into raltegravir's ability to affect latent viral reservoirs and possibly aid in the eradication of HIV is currently ongoing. Research results were published in the New England Journal of Medicine on July 24, 2008. The authors concluded that \\"raltegravir plus optimized background therapy provided better viral suppression than optimized background therapy alone for at least 48 weeks.\\" Research on human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) terminase proteins demonstrated that raltegravir may block viral replication of the herpesviruses. In January 2013, a Phase II trial was initiated to evaluate the therapeutic benefit of raltegravir in treating multiple sclerosis (MS). The drug is active against Human Endogenous Retroviruses (HERVs) and possibly Epstein‚ÄìBarr virus, which have been suggested in the pathogenesis of relapsing-remitting MS.

The screenplay by Sturridge, Tim Sullivan, and Derek Granger is based on the 1905 novel of the same name by E. M. Forster. Plot Recently widowed and anxious to escape the clutches of her oppressively meddlesome in-laws, free-spirited Lilia Herriton, n√©e Theobald (Helen Mirren) travels to the hillside Tuscan town of Monteriano with her young friend Caroline Abbott (Helena Bonham Carter). There she falls in love with both the countryside and Gino Carella, a handsome young villager, and she decides to stay. Appalled by her behaviour and concerned about Lilia's future, Mrs. Herriton, Lilia's strait-laced mother-in-law, dispatches her own son Philip (Rupert Graves) to Italy to persuade her to return home, but by the time he arrives Lilia and Gino have wed. He and Caroline return home, unable to forgive themselves for not putting an end to what they see as a clearly unsuitable marriage. Lilia is startled to discover her desire for independence is at odds with Gino's traditional values, and she is shocked when he becomes physical to clarify his position. Their relationship becomes less volatile when Lilia becomes pregnant, but she dies in childbirth, leaving her grieving husband with an infant son to raise with the help of his ageing mother. When word of Lilia's death reaches England, Caroline decides to return to Italy to save the boy from what she believes will surely be a difficult life. Not wanting to be outdone, or considered any less moral or less concerned than Caroline for the child's welfare, Lilia's mother-in-law sends Philip and his priggish spinster sister Harriet (Judy Davis) to Monteriano to obtain custody of the infant and bring him back to Sawston, where he can receive what she perceives to be a proper upbringing and education. Everything about the journey‚Äîespecially the heat, the uncomfortable accommodations, and her difficulty communicating with the locals‚Äîdistresses repressed and xenophobic Harriet, but Philip and Caroline both begin to find themselves attracted to everything Tuscan that had appealed to Lilia. Philip and Caroline also begin to sympathise with Gino and his loving relationship with his son, but though Philip says he 'understands everyone', he vacillates to even broach the subject of getting custody of the boy to Gino. Philip can't seem to 'settle it, and do the right thing', as Caroline reminds him. Harriet is left to take matters into her own hands and makes a decision that leads to tragic consequences. In contrast to the novel, the film adds a \\"positive\\" ending to the changes in the story, by hinting that love between Caroline and Gino may be possible.

Critical reception Janet Maslin of The New York Times observed the film \\"has been faithfully but unimaginatively directed by Charles Sturridge, whose ... principal asset here is a very fine cast. The actors perform flawlessly even when the staging is too pedestrian for the ideas being expressed, and when the film's flat, uninflected style allows some of those ideas to be overlooked or thrown away ... Mr. Sturridge's assault on his material is strictly frontal, with a screenplay ... that adequately summarizes the novel but rarely approaches its depth. Although the film stumbles unimaginatively over some of Forster's more elaborate scenes ... and although it moves gracelessly back and forth between Italy and England, its most significant lapse is visual. Tuscany, as photographed by Michael Coulter, is never as ravishing as it deserves to be either for strictly scenic purposes or for illustrating Forster's view of Italy's magnetic allure. Even so, the material and the performances often rise above these limitations. At its occasional best, Where Angels Fear to Tread even captures the transcendent aspects of Forster's tale.\\"The New York Times review Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun-Times wrote the film \\"is rather unconvincing as a story and a movie; Forster had not yet learned to bury his themes completely within the action of a novel, as he does so brilliantly in Howards End. There are also some problems with the casting‚Äîespecially that of Giovanni Guidelli, who never seems like a real character and is sometimes dangerously close to being a comic Italian. The tug-of-war over the baby is uncomfortably melodramatic, and the whole closing sequence of the movie seems written, not lived. There are some good things, especially Mirren's widow, tasting passion and love for the first time, and Davis' sister, a prototype for all those dreadnought British spinsters for whom false pride is a virtue, not a sin.\\"Chicago Sun-Times review Rita Kempley of The Washington Post thought Sturridge \\"seems less like a driven director than an impersonal subtitler. He takes no liberties with the material; he merely translates the story from page to screen. On the whole, it's rather like reading without the effort of holding the book. For many, this will do quite nicely, thank you. Others will find it all too stranglingly Anglophilic, which is perhaps the point.\\"The Washington Post review Variety called the film \\"a far more rewarding dip into the E.M. Forster tub than some of its predecessors\\" with \\"none of the top-heaviness of David Lean's A Passage to India or the starchiness of Merchant Ivory's A Room with a View.\\"Variety review Owen Gleiberman of Entertainment Weekly graded the film C, noting \\"except for Helen Mirren's brief, mischievous performance ... the movie remains frustratingly distant from its characters' inner lives.\\"Entertainment Weekly review Time Out New York wrote, \\"The performances and scenery cannot be faulted ... But though things connect much better than they did in Sturridge's A Handful of Dust, the screenplay degenerates into a static succession of talking heads. Sturridge's work still seems to be TV masquerading as cinema.\\"Time Out New York review Awards and nominations Judy Davis won the Boston Society of Film Critics Award for Best Supporting Actress for her performance in both this film and Husbands and Wives.Notes Where Angels Fear to Tread at Turner Classic Movies DVD release Image Entertainment released the film in anamorphic widescreen format on Region 1 DVD on 7 November 2006.

New Winchester Model 21 production continues under license to Connecticut Shotgun Manufacturing Company. The Winchester Model 21 action is of a typical breech loading shotgun, commonly called a break or hinge action. Like all quality double guns, production is time-consuming due to the laborious process of joining the barrels to produce an identical convergence of shot. The Model 21 was Winchester's effort to make a quality side by side shotgun to rival those of high-end makers such as Parker and Fox; financial troubles plagued the gun's development until the Western Cartridge Company purchased Winchester Repeating Arms in 1931.

The Superintendent of Finances () was the name of the minister in charge of finances in France from 1561 to 1661. The position was abolished in 1661 with the downfall of Nicolas Fouquet, and a new position was created, the Controller-General of Finances. History Before 1561 Prior to the creation of the position \\"Surintendant des finances\\", France's royal financial administration had been run‚Äîfrom the time of Charles VII‚Äîby two financial boards which worked in a collegial manner: the four G√©n√©raux des finances oversaw the collection of taxes (taille, etc.) and the four Tr√©soriers de France (Treasurers) oversaw revenues from royal lands (the \\"domaine\\"). Together they were often referred to as \\"Messieurs des finances\\". The four members of each board were divided by geographical circumscriptions (\\"recettes g√©n√©rales\\" or \\"g√©n√©ralit√©s\\"; the areas were named Languedo√Øl, Languedoc, Normandy, and Outre-Seine and Yonne), with the directors of the \\"Languedo√Øl\\" region typically having an honorific preeminence. The double-board was assisted in its work by four \\"contr√¥leurs g√©n√©raux\\". Before 1523-24, the King's Council had very little direct say on the day-to-day running of the double-boards. In 1523, Francis I, in an effort to exert a more direct control over royal finances during his European wars and to circumvent the double- board (accused of poor oversight) -- created a separate Royal Treasury (Tr√©sor de l'√âpargne) directly under the control of the King's Council (analogous institutions had existed before), but the initial results were disappointing. From this moment through the next 40 years, numerous administrative reforms were attempted: increase in the number of \\"g√©n√©ralit√©s\\"; unification of the tasks of the double-board into new positions (such as two \\"contr√¥leurs g√©n√©raux\\" subservient to the Royal Treasurer); changes in the royal financial courts (\\"Cour des Comptes\\", \\"Cour des Aides\\"); creation of numerous provincial financial officers and boards; creation of the positions of \\"intendents\\" of finance (see below). With the increased role of the King's Council in financial matters, certain high-ranked nobles (like Anne de Montmorency or Charles of Lorraine, Cardinal of Guise) exerted a stronger advisory role over finances. Although there was no official \\"Minister of Finances\\" in this period, certain individuals exerted an equivalent administrative role. ;Under Francis I: *1518‚Äì1524: Jacques de Beaune, baron de Semblan√ßay ;Under Henry II: *1552: Andr√© Guillart *1556: Jean de Saint Marcel d'Avan√ßon Surintendant des finances The position \\"Surintendant des finances\\" was officially created in 1561 during the reign of Charles IX, although some royal financial advisors had performed analogous duties previously. The position grew out of the positions of Intendants of Finances, officially created in 1552 by Henry II to oversee royal finances during the king's travels in Germany (he sought an alliance with Protestant Princes). At the time, three Intendants of Finances were named, and one of them would also participate in the Privy Counsel, thus the designation \\"superintendent\\". In 1561, the position fell to two individuals: Artus de Coss√©-Brissac and the comte de Chaulnes. An administrative ruling on 23 October 1563 mandated once-a-week reunions of the Conseil du Roi (King's Counsel) to deal with financial questions of finances; to this meeting would come the superintendent of finances and other officers of country's financial administration, such as the Treasurer (tr√©sorier de l'√âpargne). In 1567, Coss√© was promoted to mar√©chal de France; he resigned his post in favor of Ren√© de Birague (as did too, apparently, the comte de Chaulnes); Ren√© de Birague was thus the sole \\"superintendent\\". In 1570, the position was assumed by the Conseil royal des finances. Henry III suppressed the Conseil royal des finances in 1574 and named a superintendent. Henry IV replaced the superintendent with a counsel. In this way, the position appeared intermittently, its fate tied to that of the Conseil des finances. On 5 September 1661, Nicolas Fouquet was arrested for financial misdealings and brought to trial. On the 12th, the position of Supertintendant was replaced by a Conseil royal des finances, attended by an intendant, named the Contr√¥leur g√©n√©ral des finances; this position first fell to Jean-Baptiste Colbert.

The king said that if it were a jackal, he would leave the kingdom to her; if it were a tiger, he would send her away and marry another woman. Then he summoned the guards to settle it. The guards decided they had to agree with the king or get in trouble, so they said it was a tiger. The king abandoned the queen in the forest. A farmer gave her shelter, and she gave birth to a son, Ameer Ali. When he was eighteen, Ameer Ali set out to have adventures. He shot at a pigeon and broke an old woman's pot, so he gave her the brass pot he carried, and fetched water for her. He briefly saw a beautiful young woman in her hut. In the morning, she told him that if he ever needed aid, he would call the fairy of the forest. He thought only of the beautiful young woman. He went to the king's palace and entered his service. One stormy night, a woman was heard wailing outside. The king ordered a servant to find out what it was, but the servant begged to be let off. Ameer Ali offered to go. He found a woman wailing beneath a gallows, though she was in reality an ogress. She told Ameer Ali that the body was her son's. When he tried to get it down for her, she tried to catch him, but he stabbed her and she fled, leaving behind an anklet. He told the king his story. The king gave the anklet to his proud and spoiled daughter. She had two talking birds, a parrot and a starling. The starling thought the anklet became her. The parrot said her legs did not match. The princess demanded of her father a matching anklet. The king ordered Ameer Ali to find another within a month or die. With only a week left, Ameer Ali thought to call on the fairy of the forest. The beautiful young woman appeared. She told him to arrange wands, and then cut off her foot; the blood would make jewels. Then he would put back the foot and switch the wands, and she would be well again. Unwillingly, he obeyed her, and got the jewels. He was easily able to find someone to set them. The starling admired the pair, but the parrot said she had all the beauty at one end. The princess demanded a necklace and bracelets from her father, and the king demanded them of Ameer Ali. By the same means, he had them made. The parrot now complained that she dressed up for herself alone; she should marry. The princess told her father that she wanted to marry Ameer Ali. He agreed. Ameer Ali refused, and the king threw him into prison, although he thought his daughter should still marry, so he sent for men fit for a bridegroom and a royal heir. The farmer joined the throng and made a petition: telling the king to remember that the tiger lived in the forest while the jackals hunted anywhere food could be found. He explained how he had found the queen and Ameer Ali was her son, and the king was ashamed of himself. He gave his throne to his son, who married the beautiful young fairy.

The village was named after Joseph Edward Willard, a delegate to the Virginia General Assembly from 1893 to 1901, then Lieutenant Governor of Virginia. Although Willard lived in Loudoun County, he represented Fairfax County, because the village was only from the county border. Willard owned a estate in Fairfax. His father was Joseph Clapp Willard, the owner of the famed Willard Hotel in Washington, D.C. Willard was at the intersection of Willard Road (now Stonecroft Boulevard) and Sterling Road (now Horsepen Road), surrounded by extensive farmland, housing, schools, places of worship, the Willard store (until 1907), and Blue Ridge Airfield (1938‚Äì1951). Willard stood west of Floris, north of Pleasant Valley, and south of Farmwell (now Ashburn). Willard was regarded as a crossroads and a distinctive community until construction of Washington Dulles International Airport began in 1958.

Both are part of the Crane Estate located on Argilla Road in Ipswich, Massachusetts. The former summer home of Mr. and Mrs. Richard T. Crane, Jr., the estate includes a historic mansion, 21 outbuildings, and designed landscapes overlooking Ipswich Bay, on the seacoast off Route 1, north of Boston. Its name derives from a promontory in Ipswich, Suffolk, England, whence many early Massachusetts Bay Colony settlers immigrated, and predates the Crane mansion. The estate is a relatively intact work from the Country Place Era of the turn of the 20th century, when wealthy families built extensive country estates. The Crane Estate includes architectural and landscape designs from at least seven firms or individuals of national reputation, including the Olmsted Brothers and Shepley, Rutan and Coolidge, and is extensively documented. In recognition of its state of preservation and design, it was designated a National Historic Landmark in 1998. The property is now owned by The Trustees of Reservations and is open to the public. Aerial view of Castle Hill, Ipswich, Massachusetts History Its history dates back as far as December 29, 1634, when a group of Ipswich town selectmen unanimously voted \\"That the Neck of Land wheareuppon the great Hill standeth, which is known by the name of the Castle Hill, lyeinge on the other side of this River towards the Sea, shall remayne unto the common use of the Towne forever.\\" In June 1637, John Winthrop, Jr., the town's founder and son of Governor John Winthrop, threatened to leave Ipswich, and Castle Hill was deeded to him as an enticement to stay. In 1644, he deeded Castle Hill to Samuel Symonds, Deputy Governor, who in turn deeded it to his son-in-law, Daniel Epps, in 1660. By 1745, it belonged to the Brown family. After John Burnham Brown died, the property was purchased by Richard Teller Crane II, on January 10, 1910. Crane was the president of the Crane Co. of Chicago, which he inherited from his father Charles Richard Crane. His grandfather Richard Teller Crane had founded the company in 1855. It was declared a National Historic Landmark in 1998. and Design The Rose Garden The \\"Grande All√©e\\" after restoration, 2011 Crane hired the famous Olmsted Brothers, sons of Frederick Law Olmsted (creator of New York's Central Park, Brooklyn's Prospect Park, Boston's Emerald Necklace and others), to design the landscaping. By 1912, they had fashioned a series of ornate terraced gardens, with a magnificent grass mall, wide and lined with evergreens cascading from the top of the hill straight down to the water nearly half a mile away. Classical- style statuary flank this \\"Grande All√©e\\" at regular intervals. An opulent \\"casino\\" was built at its midpoint, replete with saltwater swimming pool, bathhouse, guest cabanas and a sizable indoor ballroom. Two main gardens, the \\"Italian Garden\\" and the \\"Rose Garden,\\" once contained ornate plantings, landscaped walkways and Italianesque fountains. Atop Castle Hill, Crane built an Italian Renaissance-style villa, with stucco walls and red tiled roof. Designed by Shepley, Rutan and Coolidge of Boston, the edifice was set upon the highest promontory overlooking the Atlantic Ocean. His wife Florence, however, felt that the mansion was cold and drafty, and she made her displeasure known. Crane countered by promising that if she would give it ten years, he would replace it if she still insisted. \\"Upon the summit Mr. Crane has erected his splendid summer home, with a beautiful sunken garden, rose garden, lawns and terraces, commanding a marvelous view of land and sea, of Agamenticus and Boar's Head and the low-lying Isles of Shoals on the distant horizon, Bar Island and the long bar with its many lines of white breakers, sand dunes and the level beach near at hand. Mr. Crane has purchased as well, Wigwam Hill and the great tract of picturesque dunes, the old Castle Neck, with the exception of the small tract owned by the United States, on which the light house was built in 1837. He has acquired also the Sagamore Hill farm.\\" (Thomas Franklin Waters, Ipswich in the Massachusetts Bay Colony, Vol. 2, 1917.) In 1924, the Italian Renaissance-style villa was torn down, as promised, and a new mansion subsequently took its place. Designed by architect David Adler of Chicago, the new fifty-nine-room mansion included a main facade in the 17th-century Stuart style, a library with Grinling Gibbons carvings imported from an English country house (Cassiobury House), parquet wood flooring, and paneled interior rooms from an 18th-century townhouse at 75 Dean Street, London. The rear aspect of the house, with its octagonal towers and inset roundels, was modelled on Ham House. Completed in 1928, this splendid mansion still stands, and the Olmsted Brothers' landscaping also remains largely unchanged. A pair of immense seated griffin statues by renowned sculptor Paul Manship grace the entrance to the north terrace overlooking the sea. These were a gift from employees of Crane Co. to Richard Crane in 1928, upon completion of his new home. Trust After the death of Richard Crane, the estate passed to his wife, Florence. In 1945, the Crane family donated much of their private beach and dunes to The Trustees of Reservations, a private, non-profit land conservation and historic preservation organization, with 112 properties throughout the Commonwealth of Massachusetts. When Florence Crane died in 1949, the rest of the property, including the mansion, was given to The Trustees, who maintain the property to this day and offer tours of the historic mansion seasonally. The property was used as a forum for outdoor concerts in the late 1950s and early 1960s, featuring such jazz legends as Louis Armstrong, Ella Fitzgerald and Dave Brubeck, and as part of a Castle Hill Art Center and music camp run by the New England Conservatory. Laid out just above the casino and pool, the stage faced the \\"Great House\\" so that audiences could sit on the splendid lawn of the Grande All√©e, facing the ocean. The Trustees still offer a number of public programs throughout the year, including outdoor picnic concerts on the All√©e, and Christmas events. All part of the Crane Estate, Castle Hill's once-private beaches are now open to the public as Crane Beach. Since 1996, The Trustees have been hosting the outdoor picnic concerts each week over the summer. Generally, the groups that play at the concerts are from a wide variety of different musical genres. Both Ipswich residents and visitors are welcome to join the large audiences that show up to each concert. In popular culture The 1987 movie The Witches of Eastwick prominently features the grounds and mansion at Castle Hill, the site filmed on location as home of the eccentric millionaire Daryl Van Horne, played by Jack Nicholson. The 1987 movie Flowers in the Attic also features Castle Hill. It is the main location at which nearly all scenes were filmed. The beginning scene shows the children walking towards the front of the house after being dropped off by the bus. In reality, the bus stop is at the end of the rolling green, where the lawn ends and the ocean begins. The 2009 movie Ghosts of Girlfriends Past was predominantly filmed inside and outside the mansion. Several fake windows, statues, and columns were added to the building, in addition to a circular driveway added to the front. These fiberglass additions have now been removed, along with the circular driveway. In the 2014 movie The Equalizer, the Crane Estate serves as a Russian oligarch's Moscow, Russia mansion in one of the final scenes. Phil Keoghan opened the first episode and introduced the video background segments of the contestants of The Amazing Race 17 from the grass mall. The Crane Estate was featured in several scenes of the 2019 movie Little Women. https://www.boston.com/culture/entertainment/2019/12/24/little-women-filming- locations-massachusetts See also *National Register of Historic Places listings in Ipswich, Massachusetts *National Register of Historic Places listings in Essex County, Massachusetts *List of National Historic Landmarks in Massachusetts References External links *The Trustees of Reservations: Castle Hill *The Trustees of Reservations: Crane Beach *The Trustees of Reservations: Crane Wildlife Refuge on the Crane Estate *Aerial photograph by Philip Greenspun Historic house museums in Massachusetts The Trustees of Reservations Houses completed in 1926 Bay Circuit Trail Museums in Essex County, Massachusetts Houses in Ipswich, Massachusetts Ipswich, Massachusetts Parks in Essex County, Massachusetts National Historic Landmarks in Massachusetts National Register of Historic Places in Ipswich, Massachusetts David Adler buildings Houses on the National Register of Historic Places in Essex County, Massachusetts Protected areas established in 1949 1949 establishments in Massachusetts ","title":"Castle Hill (Ipswich, Massachusetts)"},{"id":"6425818","text":"Anzac Peak is a volcano on the Laurens Peninsula of Heard Island in the Southern Ocean.

It was invented by Bill James, and first appeared in the 1987 edition of the Bill James Baseball Abstract. Speed score is on a scale of 0 to 10, with zero being the slowest and ten being the fastest. League average is generally around 4.5. Formula Speed Score is calculated using six factors: stolen base percentage, stolen base attempts as a percentage of opportunities, triples, double plays grounded into as a percentage of opportunities, runs scored as a percentage of times on base, and defensive position and range. Factors The individuals factors are calculated as follows: Factor 1 (Stolen base percentage): :\\\\mathit{F1} = 20 \\\\cdot ({{\\\\mathit{SB} + 3 \\\\over \\\\mathit{SB} + \\\\mathit{CS} +7}} - 0.4) Where SB=stolen bases and CS=caught stealings. Factor 2 (Stolen base attempts): :\\\\mathit{F2} = \\\\cdot \\\\sqrt{{\\\\mathit{SB} + \\\\mathit{CS} \\\\over \\\\mathit{1B} + \\\\mathit{BB} + \\\\mathit{HBP}}} Where 1B=singles, BB=walks and HBP=hit by pitch. Factor 3 (Triples): :\\\\mathit{F3} = 625 \\\\cdot {{\\\\mathit{3B} \\\\over \\\\mathit{AB} - \\\\mathit{HR} - \\\\mathit{K}}} Where 3B=triples, AB=at bats, HR=home runs and K =strikeouts. Factor 4 (Runs scored): :\\\\mathit{F4} = 25 \\\\cdot ({{\\\\mathit{R} - \\\\mathit{HR} \\\\over \\\\mathit{H} + \\\\mathit{BB} + \\\\mathit{HBP} - \\\\mathit{HR}}} - 0.1) Where R=runs and H=hits. Factor 5 (Grounded into double plays): :\\\\mathit{F5} = \\\\cdot (0.063 - {{\\\\mathit{GDP} \\\\over \\\\mathit{AB} - \\\\mathit{HR} - \\\\mathit{K}}}) Where GDP=times ground into double play. Factor 6 (Defensive position and range): This is dependent upon the player's primary position as follows: :P: \\\\mathit{F6} = 0 :C: \\\\mathit{F6} = 1 :1B: \\\\mathit{F6} = 2 :2B: \\\\mathit{F6} = \\\\cdot {{\\\\mathit{PO} + \\\\mathit{A} \\\\over \\\\mathit{G}}} :3B: \\\\mathit{F6} = \\\\cdot {{\\\\mathit{PO} + \\\\mathit{A} \\\\over \\\\mathit{G}}} :SS: \\\\mathit{F6} = \\\\cdot {{\\\\mathit{PO} + \\\\mathit{A} \\\\over \\\\mathit{G}}} :OF: \\\\mathit{F6} = 3 \\\\cdot {{\\\\mathit{PO} + \\\\mathit{A} \\\\over \\\\mathit{G}}} Where P is pitcher, C is catcher, 1B is first baseman, 2B is second baseman, 3B is third baseman, SS is shortstop, OF is outfielder, PO=putouts, A=assists and G=games played. Final Calculation If any factor is less than zero, it is converted to zero, and if any factor is greater than ten, it is converted to ten. The average of factors 1 through 6 is taken, and the result is the player's score. :\\\\mathit{Spd} = {{\\\\mathit{F1} + \\\\mathit{F2} + \\\\mathit{F3} + \\\\mathit{F4} + \\\\mathit{F5} + \\\\mathit{F6} \\\\over 6}} Developments In 2006, Baseball Prospectus developed their own version of speed score in order to \\"better [take] advantage of play-by-play data and [ensure] that equal weight is given to the five components.\\" It is on the same zero to ten scale and includes all the original factors (except for the player's defense). 5.0 is set as exactly league average. In general, very fast players tend to score around 7.0 and very slow players around 3.0.

Shepard gave her a necklace to contact him with and vanished. He continuously appeared and reappeared, always knowing where she was, stirring up trouble for Xavier's newest agent. It was later revealed he was helping Shortpack to track down the murderer of Prudence Leighton, an arms dealer called Steinbeck and had insight into all Mystique's missions to some degree.

History The area of present-day Minamisanriku was part of ancient Mutsu Province and came under the control of the Date clan of Sendai Domain during the Edo period, under the Tokugawa shogunate. The area has suffered from the effects of tsunami since ancient times, including the 869 Sanriku earthquake, and more recently during the 1896 Sanriku earthquake and the 1933 Sanriku earthquake. The 1896 earthquake resulted in the highest tsunami wave ever recorded in Japan at , until it was surpassed by a wave at Miyako in the 2011 T≈çhoku earthquake and tsunami. The villages of Shizukugawa and Utatsu were established on June 1, 1889 with the establishment of the modern municipalities system. Shizukugawa was elevated to town status on October 31, 1895 and Utatsu on April 1, 1959. The town was formed through a merger on October 1, 2005, when the towns of Shizugawa and Utatsu, both from Motoyoshi District, merged to form the new town of Minamisanriku. The 1960 Valdivia earthquake triggered a tsunami that crossed the Pacific Ocean and struck the town of Shizugawa with a height of up to , causing extensive damage. (video shows damage from 1960 tsunami) As a result, two-story-high harbor walls were built by 1963, and residents held tsunami drills each year on the anniversary. To mark the 30th anniversary of the disaster in 1990, a bilingual Spanish- Japanese plaque was installed, with a message from President Patricio Aylwin of Chile, accompanied by a replica moai statue.

All the others have gone.\\" Since the schools were all on high ground, many children were orphaned.Minamisanriku: Japan's tsunami-hit ground zero Channel 4 News, 14 March 2011 Survivors wrote \\"SOS\\" in white lettering, in the playing field of Shizugawa High School. When the earthquake struck, the mayor, Jin Sato (‰ΩêËó§‰ªÅ), was talking at the town assembly about the much smaller tsunami caused by the March 9 foreshock of the March 11 earthquake. The three-story building of the town's which Sato escaped to was submerged by the tsunami. Out of the 130 people who worked at the town hall, Sato was one of 53 who reached the roof and one of 10 who survived. He returned to government affairs, founding the headquarters for disaster control at the Bayside Arena in Miyagi on March 13, 2011. Shizugawa Hospital was one of the few major buildings that survived the tsunami. It was partly inundated, and 74 out of 109 patients died. Close to 200 people were rescued from the roof. Miki Endo, a 25-year-old employed by the town's Crisis Management Department to voice disaster advisories and warnings, was hailed in the Japanese news media as a heroine for sacrificing her life by continuing to broadcast warnings and alerts over the community loudspeaker system, in the Crisis Management Department's building, as the tsunami overwhelmed it. She was credited with saving many lives. The three- story headquarters of the department remained standing but was completely gutted, with only a red-colored steel skeleton remaining. In the aftermath of the disaster, Endo was missing and was later confirmed to have died.Jiji Press, \\"Saitama to teach about Miyagi's tsunami 'angel'\\", Japan Times, 30 January 2012, p. 2. Photos show the roof of the building completely submerged at the height of the inundation, with some people clinging to the rooftop antenna. International response The town is the site of the first field hospital established by an outside nation offering assistance following the disaster. An initial team of five doctors from Israel set up a surgery in preparation for a larger team once needs were assessed. A 53-member delegation of medical personnel from the Home Front Command and the IDF's Medical Corps opened a field hospital near Minamisanriku on March 29. The clinic included surgical, pediatrics and maternity wards, and an intensive care unit, pharmacy and laboratory along with 62 tons of medical supplies. The clinic was active in treating patients immediately upon opening. On 23 April 2011, the Prime Minister of Australia, Julia Gillard, visited Minamisanriku. Economy Minamisanriku relies heavily on tourism and commercial fishing as mainstays of the local economy. Education Minamisanriku has five public elementary schools and two public middle schools operated by the town government and one public high school operated by the Miyagi Prefectural Board of Education.

An aldonic acid is any of a family of sugar acids obtained by oxidation of the aldehyde functional group of an aldose to form a carboxylic acid functional group. Thus, their general chemical formula is HOOC-(CHOH)n-CH2OH. Oxidation of the terminal hydroxyl group instead of the terminal aldehyde yields a uronic acid, while oxidation of both terminal ends yields an aldaric acid. Aldonic acids are typically prepared by oxidation of the sugar with bromine. They are generally found in their lactone form, with the ring structure essentially the same as in the original sugar's cyclic hemiacetal form, which is the form the sugar is usually found in. However, unlike hemiacetals, lactones do not have a chiral anomeric carbon, and they cannot form glycosidic linkages. Aldonic acids are found in many biological systems, and are the products of the oxidation of aldoses by Benedict's or Fehling's reagents. Their lactones are key intermediates in the Kiliani-Fischer synthesis of sugars. Nomenclature of aldonic acids and their lactones is based on replacing the suffix \\"-ose\\" with \\"onic acid\\" or \\"onolactone\\" respectively; hence D-glucose is oxidized to D-gluconic acid and D-gluconolactone.

The rebel Admiral Killick evacuated his crew and blew up Cr√™te-√†- Pierrot, which was by then under fire from Panther. There were concerns about how the United States would view the action in the context of the Monroe Doctrine. But despite legal advice describing the sinking as \\"illegal and excessive\\", the US State Department endorsed the action. The New York Times declared that \\"Germany was quite within its rights in doing a little housecleaning on her own account\\". Some months later, in December 1902, the Panther was in the German naval contingent during the Naval Blockade of Venezuela, during which she bombarded the settlement of Fort San Carlos, near Maracaibo.Mitchell (1999:101) The shallow waters that connected lake Maracaibo with the sea were passable for major ships only in the strait that separated San Carlos from the island of Zapara, yet even there it needed the help of a local pilot to avoid the sand banks and shallow waters of the passage. The battle started when the fort's gunners opened fire as Panther was crossing the bar. Panther returned fire, but the shallow waters limited its effectiveness. Inside the fort, two gunners (Manuel Quevedo and Carlos Jos√© C√°rdenas) managed to score several hits on Panther with their 80-millimeter Krupp gun, causing considerable damage. After half an hour of exchanging fire, the Germans retreated. In 1905, Panther was sent to the Brazilian Port of Itajahy, where its crew conducted an unauthorized search in their pursuit of a German deserter by the name of Hassman. They ended up kidnapping, inexplicably, the German Fritz Steinhoff. This incident became known as the \\"Panther Affair\\" (\\"Caso Panther\\"). Agadir Crisis Panther in 1931 shortly before her disposal Panther became notorious in 1911 when it was deployed to the Moroccan port of Agadir during the \\"Agadir Crisis\\" (also called the \\"Second Moroccan Crisis\\"). Panther was dispatched on the pretext of protecting (non-existent) German citizens in the port (a German sales representative, Hermann Wilberg, had been sent to Agadir on behalf of the Foreign office, but only arrived three days after Panther.) The ship's actual mission was to apply pressure on the French, as the latter attempted to colonize Morocco, to extract territorial compensation in French Equatorial Africa. This was an example of \\"gunboat diplomacy\\". The incident contributed to the international tensions that would lead to the First World War. The ship was scrapped in 1931.

Early life, education and family Russell was born in Marietta, Georgia in 1861. He attended the University of Georgia UGA in Athens, Georgia and graduated in 1879 with a Bachelor of Arts degree at the age of eighteen and with a Bachelor of Laws degree from the UGA School of Law the following year. While at UGA, he was a member of the school's Supreme Court. Russell's first wife was Marie Louise Tyler. They married in 1883; however, Marie died two years later during the delivery of a stillbirth. In 1891, Russell wed a second time to Ina Dillard from Athens, Georgia. The couple moved to Winder, Georgia in 1894 and then further east in 1902 to an area that would become eventually be designated by the Georgia General Assembly as Russell, Georgia. The Russell family home in that community is now on the National Register of Historic Places. Richard and Ina had fifteen children. Their oldest son, Richard B. Russell Jr., was a governor of Georgia and a long-serving and powerful member of the United States Senate. A younger son, Robert Lee Russell, served as a judge on the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit. Fraternal orders Russell was fond of involvement in fraternal benefit societies, especially the Royal Arcanum. He held a number of offices in the groups; provided legal services for them, and was frequently elected as a delegate to their conventions, and would take Ina and one or more of his children with him on these expenses-paid trips. This involvement would wane after he went into legal practice in later years.Russell, Sally.

When Russell expressed his desire to run for the United States Senate in 1924, the Klan dissuaded him, informing the Chief Justice that the organization was already backing incumbent Senator William Julius Harris. Public service At age twenty-one, Russell was elected to the Georgia House of Representatives (1882) as a representative of Clarke County, Georgia. He was elected at age twenty-seven to the position of solicitor general for the Western Circuit of the Superior Courts of Georgia, a seven-county judicial circuit. Russell was subsequently elected to judicial positions in numerous Georgia courts including the Georgia Court of Appeals (elected in 1907 and chief justice of that court from 1913 to 1916) and the Supreme Court of Georgia on which he served as Chief Justice for his entire sixteen-year career (1922 to 1938) in that position. Russell was the only person to serve on both the Georgia Court of Appeals and the Supreme Court of Georgia until Keith Blackwell's appointment in 2012. Russell ran multiple unsuccessful gubernatorial and United States congressional campaigns: two Georgia gubernatorial elections (1906 and 1910), a U.S. House of Representatives election (1916), and a U.S. Senate election (1926). Death Richard B. Russell Sr. died in 1938 of a heart attack at Atlanta, Georgia and was buried in the Russell family plot behind their house in the Russell Community.

The single was poorly received by the music press and the public: its highest chart position was No. 18, making it the first solo Morrissey single not to reach the British top 10. It appeared along with its B-side \\"Yes, I Am Blind\\" on the compilation album Bona Drag. A shorter edit, omitting a verse, appeared on the 2010 reissue of Bona Drag. The song is about the protagonist using a Ouija board to contact a dead friend, who tells him to \\"push off\\" (\\"push oof\\" in some renditions). It caused some debate in the press at the time over claims it promoted occult dabbling or devil worship. Morrissey replied to these claims by retorting: \\"The only contact I ever made with the dead was when I spoke to a journalist from The Sun.\\"Rogan, Johnny Morrissey - The Album, p. 157 The video for the song, directed by Tim Broad, features Morrissey being led into the woods by some children who take him to see a spirit medium, played by Joan Sims, the British actress best known for her appearances in the Carry On film series.

The molecule has a cyclic backbone which can be described as consisting of alternating single and double bonds between phosphorus and nitrogen atoms (hence classified as a phosphazene). It can be viewed as a trimer of the hypothetical compound N‚â°PCl2 (phosphonitrilic chloride; hence the alternative, more archaic name phosphonitrilic chloride trimer for compound). Hexachlorotriphosphazene together with the related octachlorotetraphosphazene (NPCl2)4 are precursors to inorganic polymers called polyphosphazenes, and is also the most common starting material for the study of substituted cyclophosphazene compounds.Mark, J. E.; Allcock, H. R.; West, R. ‚ÄúInorganic Polymers‚Äù Prentice Hall, Englewood, NJ: 1992. . Structure Chemists have long known of rings containing purely carbon or carbon and other elements, e.g. benzene, pyridine, orcyclohexane. Related cyclic compounds lacking in carbon have also been studied; hexachlorotriphosphazene is one such inorganic ring. Other well known inorganic ring systems include borazine, S4N4, and the cyclic siloxanes. Cyclophosphazenes such as hexachlorotriphosphazene are distinguished by a characteristic mode of bonding with notable stability and equal (to slight variation) bond length along the ringm, making the conventional representation on the left misleading. To account for this, early bonding models invoked a delocalised œÄ system arising from the overlap of N 2p and P 3d orbitals, reminiscent of the bonding in inorganic aromatic compounds such as borazine (depicted in the middle). Depictions of bonding in a general cyclotriphosphazene: left, a conventional representation of alternating single and double P‚ÄìN bonds (does not account for equal bond lengths); middle, the initial proposed delocalised ring system (later discredited due to infeasibility of P 3d participation; right, the most accurate description to our current knowledge, wherein the majority of the bonding is ionic. Nonetheless, modern calculations reveal that the P 3d contribution is negligible, invalidating the earlier hypothesis; instead a charge separated model is more generally accepted. According to this description, the P‚ÄìN bond is viewed as a very polarised one (between notional P+ and N‚Äì, as in the right), with sufficient ionic character to account for most of the bond strength. The rest (~15%) of the bond strength may be attributed to a negative hyperconjugation interaction: the N lone pairs can donate some electron density into œÄ-accepting œÉ* molecular orbitals on the P. Synthesis The reaction of PCl5 and NH4Cl affords a mixture of substances with the empirical formula (PNCl2)n, where n will usually take values of n=2 (the dimer tetrachlorodiphosphazene), n=3 (the trimer hexachlorotriphosphazene), and n=4 (the tetramer octachlorotetraphosphazene).Holleman, A. F.; Wiberg, E. \\"Inorganic Chemistry\\" Academic Press: San Diego, 2001. . The three major cyclophosphazene products resulting from the reaction of phosphorus pentachloride and ammonium chloride These rings were described by Liebig in 1832Liebig-W√∂hler, Briefwechsel vol. 1, 63; Ann. Chem. (Liebig), vol. 11 (1834), 146. in his study of the reaction of PCl5 and NH3: : n PCl5 \\\\+ n NH4Cl ‚Üí (NPCl2)n \\\\+ 4n HCl Reactions are typically conducted in chlorobenzene solution. Purification by sublimation gives mainly the trimer and tetramer, while slow sublimation under vacuum at approximately 60 ¬∞C affords the pure trimer free of the tetramer. Reaction conditions such as temperature may also be tuned to maximise the yield of the trimer at the expense of the other possible products; nonetheless, commercial samples of hexachlorotriphosphazene usually contain appreciable amounts of octachlorotetraphosphazene, even up to 40%. Reactions  Substitution at P  Thanks to the high electrophilicity of the P atoms in the ring and the nature of chloride as a good leaving group, hexachlorophosphazene may readily react with nucleophiles which substitute a Cl off the P via a mechanism described as SN2 attack at phosphorus. The transition state is not particularly difficult to form when steric factors are not interfering, as its pentacoordinate trigonal bipyramidal arrangement at P is not uncommon at all for P(V) compounds. A particularly common substitution is that with alkoxides of both aliphatic and aromatic alcohols, which proceeds readily when the alcohol is already deprotonated to yield hexasubstituted triphosphazenes. A SN2 substitution at hexachlorotriphosphazene P. Note the trigonal bipyramidal transition state. Herein a monosubstitution by an alkoxide is depicted, which would usually then proceed rapidly up to hexasubstitution. The polysubstitution of the initial phosphazene raises the issue of regioselectivity. The dominant factors affecting this are found to be: (a) steric effects; and (b) the ability of the alkoxy oxygen lone pair to œÄ-backdonate to the P atom where substitution has occurred, decreasing the latter's electrophilicity and deactivating it towards further substitution. In combination these factors usually lead to strong preference for 2,4 over a 2,2 attack of monosubstituted intermediates (note numbering of ring positions starts from N). These then go on to form 2,4,6-trisubstituted and 2,2,4,6-tetrasubstituted intermediates before almost inevitably reaching hexasubstitution (non-fully substituted sideproducts tend to be negligible in concentration, provided that enough equivalents of alkoxide and heat have been provided). The resulting hexalkoxyphosphazenes (especially the aryloxy species) are valued for their high thermal and chemical stability, in fact finding use as fireproof materials and high temperature lubricants.  Polymerisation: \\"Inorganic rubber\\"  Hexachlorophosphazene is a precursor to poly(dichlorophosphazene) or \\"inorganic rubber\\", whose discovery is attributed to H. N. Stokes in 1896.H. N. Stokes (1895), On the chloronitrides of phosphorus. American Chemical Journal, vol. 17, p. 275.H. N. Stokes (1896), On Trimetaphosphimic acid and its decomposition products. American Chemical Journal, vol. 18 issue 8, p. 629. Upon heating to ca. 250 ¬∞C, the trimer undergoes ring-opening polymerisation to give the linear polymer (PNCl2)n, where n usually ranges around 15000 repeat units. The tetramer also polymerises in this manner, though at a much slower rate than the trimer; therefore, its presence in impure hexachlorophosphazene starting material may noticeably lengthen the time required for polymerisation to complete. Hexachlorotriphosphazene ROP and subsequent nucleophilic substitution for desired polyphosphazene synthesis The resulting inorganic chloropolymer has been studied as the starting point for a wide class of polymers, collectively known as polyphosphazenes. Subsequent substitution of the chloride groups on the phosphorus atoms of the poly(dichlorophosphazene) rubber backbone by other nucleophilic groups, especially alkoxides as laid out above, yields numerous characterised derivatives. Some of these polyphosphazenes appear promising for potential commercial applications such as high performance elastomers or thermoplastics with various desirable properties.  Other reactions  The trimer has also found applications in research by enabling aromatic coupling reactions between pyridine and either N,N-dialkylanilines or indole, resulting in 4,4'-substituted phenylpyridine derivatives, postulated to go through a cyclophosphazene pyridinium salt intermediate. The compound may also be used as a peptide coupling reagent for the synthesis of oligopeptides in chloroform, though for this application the tetramer octachlorotetraphosphazene usually proves more effective. Finally, both the trimer and tetramer may photochemically react when dissolved in hexane, decaline, benzene or toluene, forming clear liquids identified as alkyl- substituted at P derivatives of the form (NPCl2-xRx)n=3,4. Such reactions proceed under prolonged UVC (mercury arc) illumination, yet the cyclophosphazene rings are not affected, a testiment of their notable chemical stability. Indeed, solid films of the trimer and tetramer will not undergo any chemical change under such irradiation conditions when not in solution.

History The area of present-day Misato was part of ancient Mutsu Province, and has been settled since at least the J≈çmon period by the Emishi people. During the Kofun period, a settlement existed in what later became the village of Kogota. During later portion of the Heian period, the area was ruled by the Northern Fujiwara. During the Sengoku period, the area was contested by various samurai clans before it came under the control of the Date clan of Sendai Domain during the Edo period, under the Tokugawa shogunate. The villages of Kogota and Nang≈ç were established on June 1, 1889 with the establishment of the modern municipalities system. Kogota was raised to town status on April 1, 1907. It annexed the town of Fudodo and the villages of Kitaura and Nakazone on April 1, 1954 and the village of Shikitama on August 1, 1954. Nang≈ç was raised to town status on July 1, 1954.

Within Colombia and the rest of Latin America, he is known in his own right as an important and innovative writer and journalist, largely inspiring much of the artistically, intellectually and politically active climate for which this particular time and place, that of mid-century Colombia, has become known. His fame is considerably more quaint outside his home country, where it derives primarily from his standing as having been part of the influential artistic and intellectual circle in Colombia in which fellow writer and journalist Gabriel Garc√≠a M√°rquez--with whom he was also a member of the more particularized Barranquilla Group--and painter Alejandro Obreg√≥n also played prominent roles. Only one of his works, La casa grande, has received considerable notice beyond the Spanish-speaking world, having been translated into several languages, English and French among them; his fame as a writer has therefore been significantly curtailed in the greater international readership, as the breadth of his literary and journalistic output has reached few audiences beyond those of Latin America and Latin American literary scholars. Early life and education √Ålvaro Cepeda Samudio was born in Barranquilla (although his birthplace is commonly mistaken for the town of Ci√©naga, where his family was fromPrologue, Todos est√°bamos a la espera, by √Ålvaro Cepeda Samudio, Third Edition, El Ancora Editores, 2003.), Colombia, two years before striking United Fruit Company workers at Ci√©naga's railroad station were massacred by the Colombian army, an event that with age became pivotal to the writer's social- and political-consciousness, as evidenced in its central role in his only novel, La casa grande. Known as the Santa Marta Massacre, the incident is also depicted in Cien a√±os de soledad (One Hundred Years of Solitude) (1967), the seminal novel of his close friend Gabriel Garc√≠a M√°rquez, and served a similar motivating principle in his dedication to social and political awareness through journalism and literature, among other means. He enrolled at the Colegio Americano, an English-language school in Barranquilla, for elementary and high school. In the spring of 1949, he traveled to Ann Arbor, MI, United States and attended the University of Michigan English Language Institute for the summer term. For the fall term in the 1949-50 school year he attended Columbia University Graduate School of Journalism in New York City. For the winter term, he attended what is now Michigan State University (then Michigan State College) in Lansing, MI before returning home to Barranquilla. Journalistic career As with many of the core members of the Barranquilla Group, Cepeda Samudio began his career as a journalist, writing first, in August 1947, for El Nacional, where his first short stories were also published. Along with Garc√≠a M√°rquez and fellow journalists and Barranquilla Group members Alfonso Fuenmayor and Germ√°n Vargas, he founded the weekly newspaper Cr√≥nica in April 1950, dedicating its pages primarily to literature and sports reporting. Cepeda Samudio made the point to include, for the first eight months of its publication, a foreign short story in each issue.Introduction, La Casa Grande, First Edition, University of Texas Press, 1991. He also spent time writing columns for the Barranquilla daily newspaper El Heraldo, for which his wife, Tita Cepeda, currently contributes cultural columns. In 1953, he was offered the general management position of this paper, which he accepted with great enthusiasm, telling Garc√≠a M√°rquez that he wanted to transform it \\"into the modern newspaper he had learned how to make in the United States\\",Living to Tell the Tale, First Edition, Vintage International, 2004. at Columbia University. However, it was \\"a fatal adventure,\\" owing, Garc√≠a M√°rquez suggests, to the fact that \\"some aging veterans could not tolerate the renovatory regime and conspired with their soulmates until they succeeded in destroying their empire.\\" Cepeda Samudio left the paper shortly thereafter. He was also the Colombian bureau chief for Sporting News, based out of St. Louis, and ultimately secured his position as one of his country's preeminent journalists and editors by becoming the editor-in-chief first of El Nacional and later of the Diario del Caribe. Literary career and outlook Cepeda Samudio's desire for a \\"renovatory regime\\" extended, however, far beyond his influence over La Nacional. Writing for his column Br√∫jula de la cultura (Cultural Compass) in El Heraldo, he consistently decried a need for \\"a renovation of Colombian prose fiction\\". He avidly sought out and championed what would have been, particularly at the time and in the considerably culturally conservative Colombia, considered \\"unorthodox\\" literature to many of his friends, notably Garc√≠a M√°rquez and other members of the Barranquilla Group, by introducing many to Ernest Hemingway and William Faulkner. In his column in El Heraldo acclaimed the innovations of Bestiario (1951), the first volume of short stories by Julio Cort√°zar. His promotion of the need for innovative literary styles and means, particularly within Colombia, is found in more than simply his essayistic criticism and columns, however, and he went on to write two short story collections and a novel in which his ideals found themselves manifested. His first published short story collection, Todos est√°bamos a la espera (We Were All Waiting) (1954), bears the markings of his interest in Hemingway, and created a considerable publishing event among academic critics of the time. Seymour Menton, who translated La Casa Grande into English, states that the first story in the collection \\"is narrated in the first person by the protagonist without any intervention by the traditional moralizing and artistic omniscient narrator.\\" This full embrace of a greater psychological impulse within the stories, as well as a rejection of any mediating contextualizations, was among the many claims Cepeda Samudio made for the necessary \\"modernization\\" of literature. Garc√≠a M√°rquez would later state that Todos est√°bamos a la espera \\"was the best book of stories that had been published in Colombia\\". His first novel, La casa grande (1962) further explores this narrative reliance on a singular, unmediated narrator, and experiments, in a manner he hadn't displayed before, with structure, breaking the narrative up into ten distinct sections. His adoration of the works of Faulkner can perhaps be most fully seen in this work. In addressing the events of the Santa Marta Massacre through disjointed narratives which circumnavigate the violence without fully delving into the actualities of it, the central actions and content of the novel are presented as the inner reactions to them on the part of those associated with the event, not as an expository account of the event itself; Garc√≠a M√°rquez states that \\"everything in this book is a magnificent example of how a writer can honestly filter out the immense quantity of rhetorical and demagogic garbage that stands in the way of indignation and nostalgia.\\"Forward, La Casa Grande, First Edition, University of Texas Press, 1991. Menton suggests that, in this way, it \\"is one of the important forerunners of One Hundred Years of Solitude,\\" and Garc√≠a M√°rquez elaborates, \\"it represents a new and formidable contribution to the most important literary phenomenon in today's world: the Latin American novel.\\" Cepeda Samudio's final publication of fiction was the short story collection Los Cuentos de Juana (1972), with illustrations by his good friend Alejandro Obreg√≥n. One of the short stories was developed into a film, Juana Ten√≠a el Pelo de Oro, which was released in Colombia in 2006. Film career Cepeda Samudio harbored an intense love and knowledge of films, and often wrote in his columns criticisms on the subject. Garc√≠a M√°rquez writes that his sustenance as a film critic would not have been possible had he not partaken in \\"the traveling school of √Ålvaro Cepeda\\". The two eventually made a short black and white feature together called La langosta azul (The Blue Lobster) (1954), which they co-wrote and directed based on an idea by Cepeda Samudio; Garc√≠a M√°rquez states that he conceded to take part in its creation as \\"it had a large dose of lunacy to make it seem like ours.\\" The film still occasionally makes appearances at \\"daring festivals\\" around the world, with the help of Cepeda Samudio's wife, Tita Cepeda. Late life Cepeda Samudio died in 1972, the year that his final collection of short stories, Los cuentos de Juana, was released, of lymphatic cancer, the same condition which his lifelong friend Garc√≠a M√°rquez was diagnosed with in 1999. In his memoir, Vivir para contarla (Living to Tell the Tale) (2002), Garc√≠a M√°rquez writes that his friend was \\"more than anything a dazzling driver--of automobiles as well as letters.\\"Living to Tell the Tale First Edition, Vintage International, 2004. The influence of Cepeda Samudio, not solely on the works of later Colombian and Latin American writers, but also on Garc√≠a M√°rquez, is evident not only in the latter writer's confessions in his autobiography of \\"imitating\\" his friend, but also in his clear admiration for his literary abilities. In his short story, La increible y triste historia de la c√°ndida Er√©ndira y de su abuela desalmada (The Incredible and Sad Tale of Innocent Er√©ndira and her Heartless Grandmother) (1978), written in the year of Cepeda Samudio's death and published six years later in a collection of the same name, the third- person narrative takes a brief and sudden digression into the first-person, informing the reader that \\"√Ålvaro Cepeda Samudio, who was also traveling in the region, selling beer-cooling equipment, took me through the desert towns\\" of which the story, and most of the stories in the collection, take place, suggesting the sharedness of the lands traversed in his stories with his polymath \\"driver\\" friend.Collected Stories, First Edition, Harper & Row, Publishers, Inc., 1984. In the final chapter of Cien a√±os de soledad, the fictionalized Barranquilla Group referred to as the \\"four friends\\" leave Macondo, \\"√Ålvaro\\" being the first among them.One Hundred Years of Solitude, First HarperPerennial Edition, HarperCollins Publishers, Inc., 1992. In preparation for his departure, the narrator states that √Ålvaro > bought an eternal ticket on a train that never stopped traveling. In the > postcards that he sent from the way stations he would describe with shouts > the instantaneous images that he had seen from the window of his coach, and > it was as if he were tearing up and throwing into oblivion some long, > evanescent poem.

Priya and with screenplay by Sudha Kongara Prasad. Set partly in India and the US, the film was also noted for having an all-woman crew. The movie won the Best English Film of the year award at the 49th National Film Awards. The movie also won Best Actress and Best Editor awards for Shobhana and Beena Paul respectively at the same function. Revathi received the \\"Special Jury Award: Silver Peacock\\" at the 33rd International Film Festival of India. Plot \\"Mitr, My Friend\\" is a film about the plight of women who sacrifice their life for the betterment of their family. It also describes the cultural differences experienced by a small town girl on moving to a transposed environment living. The film opens with a typical South Indian wedding being performed between Lakshmi (Shobhana) and Prithvi (Nasir Abdullah). The marriage has been arranged by their parents in the usual Indian manner. Lakshmi is a typical South Indian girl from Chidambaram, Tamil Nadu; Prithvi is a software engineer working in California. After the wedding, they move to the USA where Lakshmi gradually tries to fit into her new surroundings. The marriage is a happy union: Prithvi works hard at work, Lakshmi manages the home, and they grow to love one other deeply. Within a year, they are blessed with a baby girl Divya (Preeti Vissa). The film flashes forward 17 years. Divya is a typical adolescent: she goes to school, plays soccer, and occasionally attends parties (not always with her parents' knowledge or permission). Lakshmi does not take to the partying very well, and tensions rise between mother and daughter. Divya aspires independence, and expresses herself by sidelining Lakshmi; Lakshmi wants her to be responsible, and expresses this by checking up on Divya a bit too much for Divya to be comfortable. Prithvi understands both sides, and tries to cope with Divya's growing up, but not always with full cognizance of Lakshmi's feelings. Things escalate one evening when Divya kisses her boyfriend Robbie outside her home. Lakshmi is furious, because her traditional values do not permit physical intimacy outside of marriage. In her fury, she bursts forward and drives Robbie away from the porch. Divya is furious at this kind of interference. She moves out of her parents' house and begins to cohabit (without marriage) with Robbie. Lakshmi is overwhelmed by this, and Prithvi is also angered, because he feels that Lakshmi has acted in haste and mishandled the situation. He begins to drift away from Lakshmi. Amid this storm, Lakshmi seeks a shoulder in an internet chat room, where she meets a \\"mitr\\" (Sanskrit: friend), with whom she is gradually able to share her thoughts and feelings. This connection yields another result: \\"mitr\\" points out that Lakshmi is too committed to her family to relax or be happy for herself. Lakshmi digests this and begins to explore her own interests in carpentry, dance, and hairstyling; she thereby establishes a new identity and personality for herself. She becomes fast friends with her new neighbors Steve (a computer security consultant) and his kid brother Paul. Prithvi keeps his distance from these neighbors and all of Lakshmi's new friends. He is chagrined that the new Lakshmi is no longer his doting, traditional wife: she is still affectionate, but has now learned the notions of space and tacit distance. While he is inwardly glad she is growing, he discovers that there is depleting room for him, particularly at a time when he is coping with his daughter's absence. Things come to a head when he overhears Lakshmi laughing with Steve, assumes the worst, and uses a convenient work-related excuse to move out for a few days. The film takes a turn when Lakshmi, now alone at home, receives a call from the hospital. Divya has broken up with Robbie and is now hurt. Divya realizes that she cannot cope with the vagaries and lack of commitment inherent in relationships with non- Indian people; she regrets her previous decisions and decides to return home. Mother and daughter spend some quality time and bond over Lakshmi\\"s narration of nostalgic stories about her arrival to a new life in the USA. She is in touch with her \\"mitr\\" all through. The film builds to its climax when she asks, at Divya's urging, \\"mitr\\" to meet in person at the Fisherman's Wharf in San Francisco. All is revealed when \\"mitr\\" turns out to be none other than Prithvi himself.

The model is an application of the economic aspects of the Biblical Sabbath to modern socioeconomics. In the introduction of his book introducing this model, Myers states that \\"God's people are instructed to dismantle, on a regular basis, the fundamental patterns and structures of stratified wealth and power, so that there is 'enough for everyone.' \\" This statement contains two of the core principles of Myer's socioeconomic vision: # The focus on voluntary redistribution of wealth # A foundation of abundance as opposed to scarcity in other modern economic models. The Biblical concepts from which Sabbath economics draws are: * Sabbath day, particularly during the journey through the wilderness as described in Exodus 15-17 * Sabbath year, described in Exodus 23, where the land was not cultivated, and Israelite slaves were released every seventh year * Year of Jubilee every 50th year, when all debts were cancelled and all property returned to the original owners Others have since sought to explore the ideas of a Sabbath economy in practical ways.

Early life and education She graduated from MSU Faculty of Computational Mathematics and Cybernetics in 1983. She then worked at the Salyut Design Bureau and later at Khrunichev State Research and Production Space Center until 1994. Career Yeltsin made her his personal advisor in 1996 when his re-election campaign was faltering. A memoir written by Yeltsin, as reported by the New York Times credited her with advising against \\"banning Communist Party, dissolving Parliament and postponing presidential elections\\" in 1996. She was particularly influential as Yeltsin recovered from heart surgery in late 1996. She became the keystone in a small group of advisors known as \\"The Family,\\" although the others (Alexander Voloshin and Valentin Yumashev) were not Yeltsin relatives. Boris Berezovsky and other oligarchs were often included in the group as well. In 2000, Dyachenko's name came up during a corruption investigation, but no charges were brought. Dyachenko remained on the staff of Yeltsin's hand-picked successor Vladimir Putin, and was a key adviser to him during his 2000 election campaign, but Putin dismissed her later that year. Dyachenko is portrayed in the 2003 satirical comedy Spinning Boris, based on the real experiences of U.S. political consultants in the 1996 campaign. Dyachenko and Yumashev provided editorial assistance in preparing the last volume of her father's memoirs, Midnight Diaries.

It was active from the time CFC-A stood up (circa 15 April 2004) to the time the International Security Assistance Force (ISAF) took full command of the coalition military operations in Afghanistan in October 2006. CFC-A reported in its turn to United States Central Command. While CFC- Afghanistan was supposed to have inactivated sometime after November 30, 2006, CJTF-76 remained as a headquarters for ISAF's Regional Command East. CJTF-76 was replaced by Combined Joint Task Force 82, led by the 82nd Airborne Division, in the middle of 2007. CJTF-76 was located at Bagram Airfield. On 15 April 2004 the headquarters of the U.S. Army's 25th Infantry Division arrived in Afghanistan and took command of CJTF-180 from the 10th Mountain Division. Lieutenant General David Barno, commanding then decided to rename the CJTF because the \\"180\\" designation had traditionally been given to Joint task forces led by the Army's XVIII Airborne Corps. Barno chose Combined Joint Task Force 76 as the new name to evoke America's history and the democratic spirit of 1776.Lieutenant General David W. Barno, interview by Center for Military History, 21 November 2006, 31‚Äì32, in A Different Kind of War. The CFC-A commander was hoping that this new designation would highlight the change in command at the operational level at a time when Afghanistan appeared to be moving closer to democracy. CJTF-76 was the operational headquarters which consisted of two subordinate regional formations: Regional Command South and Regional Command East. The regional commands, both roughly brigade sized forces, conducted counter-insurgency operations against Taliban and Al-Qaeda in the east and south of the country. The Task Force and its subordinate formations comprised a shifting group of units and formations. There were also engineer and special operations Task Forces, plus the Provincial Reconstruction Teams. At the time of the ISAF take over, CJTF-76 was commanded by Maj. Gen. Benjamin C. Freakley of the U.S. 10th Mountain Division (Light Infantry). The mission of CJTF-76 was to conduct a 'full spectrum of operations throughout its operations area to defeat [the] enemy extremist movement, establish an enduring security and reshape its posture for the Long War in order to set conditions for long-term stability in Afghanistan.' As of mid 2006, US official sources stated that over 21,000 coalition forces from 21 nations were deployed in Afghanistan to 'defeat extremist enemies of peace and stability'. Regional Command (East) Regional Command (East)was responsible for provincial reconstruction team and security in Asadabad, Bamian, Gardez, Ghazni, Jalalabad, Khowst, Parwan, Mehtar Lam and Sharona. RC(E) also had responsibility for conducting operations against the Taliban on the Pakistani border. Task Force Spartan (March 2006 to May 2007) was a US led task force in the central and eastern regions of Afghanistan. TF Spartan was made up of the 3rd Brigade Combat Team from 10th Mountain Division (Light Infantry) and 1/3 Marines. TF Spartan fell under CJTF-76/RC East. Task Force Bayonet (June 2007 to September 2008) is comprised primarily by soldiers of the 173rd Airborne Brigade Combat Team based in Vicenza, Italy. TF Bayonet initially fell under CJTF-76 until the headquarters was redesignated as CJTF-82. Regional Command (South) Regional Command (South) was responsible for provincial reconstruction and security in Kandahar, Lashkar Gah, Qalat and Tarin Kowt. Task Force Bayonet (February 2005 to March 2006) TF Bayonet was comprised primarily by soldiers of the 173rd Airborne Brigade Combat Team based in Vicenza, Italy.

The Commander of CJTF-76 will also be the regional commander of Regional Command East (RC- East). The Commander, Joint Task Force-76 Maj. Gen. Benjamin Freakley will be dual-hatted as the U.S. operational commander and the NATO/ISAF deputy commander for security. This hopefully will ensure proper coordination. Major General Freakley, briefing journalists by video link from Afghanistan on January 26, 2007, said: \\"On October the 6th, Afghanistan completed its transition from the United States-led coalition to a NATO-led coalition headed by the International Security Assistance Force. Over the last two years, ISAF has assumed responsibility for security operations in five different provinces or regional commands: Center, North, West, South and now Regional Command East, which we command, which has 14 different provinces... As mentioned, [ Lieutenant General Karl Eikenberry left and] just five days ago, all of us came under ISAF for the counterinsurgency. Finally, early next month, the International Security Assistance Force will conduct the transition of authority from the United Kingdom lead under General Richards to the United States Command under General McNeill.

The lake occupies of land, and is home to a large variety of wildlife. At least 70 species of birds make the lake and surrounding areas their home, and about 214 species of birds visit the lake throughout the year.Burnaby Lake Nature House The park has been managed by the Metro Vancouver Parks Department since 1977. History Burnaby Lake on a cloudy day. Metrotown in the distance Burnaby Lake is a glacial lake that formed about 12,000 years ago,\\"Burnaby Lake Regional Park\\" City of Burnaby at the end of the Pleistocene ice age. The lake was named by Colonel Richard Moody after his private secretary, Robert Burnaby.\\"Colonel Richard Moody Postscript\\" Royal Engineers of British Columbia According to a map and materials by Heritage Advisory Committee and Environment and Waste Management Committee of the City of Burnaby (1993), in March 1859 Colonel Moody began to survey the site of New Westminster as the capital city for the new Colony of British Columbia. He was particularly intrigued with the possibility that a fresh water lake existed north of the town. In a letter to Governor James Douglas Moody wrote: \\"I now learn from the Indians that a lake does exist... Burnaby and Blake immediately volunteered their services to explore and also to trace the mouth to Burrard's Inlet and to report generally on the countryside north of the town. After a considerable reluctance on account of the weather I have let them go with four days' provisions in light marching order, not even tents, two Indians, a Canadian Voyageur attached to Parson's survey party and my own trusty Corporal Brown R.E. They have been away now three days in the most deplorable weather. The rain was in torrents all last night and it is streaming down still in tropical torrents - nothing would gladden my eyes more than to see them back.\\" Robert Burnaby and the rest of the party did return safely and the official hydrographic chart produced in 1860 featured two discoveries: Burnaby Lake and the Brunette River. A number of sawmills were situated here in the late 19th century. Geography The lake is situated to the east of Burnaby City Hall, and is bordered by Highway 1 to the south, and the CN New Westminster Sub to the north (Formerly BN track). The Burnaby Lake Line of the British Columbia Electric Railway's interurban service from New Westminster to Vancouver ran along the south side of the lake. Still Creek, Eagle Creek, and Deer Lake flow into Burnaby Lake, while the lake empties from the east to the Fraser River through the Brunette River. Ecology An old Burnaby Lake beaver with a limp Mallard duck nesting in the park. Burnaby Lake hosts over 400 varieties of plant, bird, fish, mammal, reptile and amphibian species.\\"Burnaby Lake Rejuvenation Project Newsletter\\" City of Burnaby, November 2005 An exceptionally wide variety of birds frequent the area, including great blue herons, bald eagles, osprey, and the green heron. Black bears once were common in the area. Burnaby Now Vegetation such as bladderworts, cattails, bulrushes, and sedges are common around the area, with deciduous trees around the edge of the marshes. Conifers occupy the areas furthest from the lake. The lake is said to act as a settling pond for incoming pollutants from Still Creek, thereby protecting the outflowing Brunette River. Large amounts of sediment, peat moss, decomposing plants, and water lilies make the lake unsuitable for swimming. Because many storm sewers drain to the lake and the Brunette River, the Cariboo Dam at Brunette River controls the rate of water outflow to prevent flooding downstream during times of heavy rain.\\"Brunette Creek Neighbourhood Planning Study - Environmental Review\\" City of New Westminster, October 2001 Activities Burnaby Lake at Piper Spit pier Birdwatching and hiking are common, with 19 km of walking and hiking trails circling the entire lake. The Burnaby Equestrian Centre is located here, with 6 km of horseback riding trails along the southern and eastern sides of the lake. Canoeing, rowing, and kayaking is also popular, with the Burnaby Canoe and Kayak Club and the Burnaby Lake Rowing Club in the Burnaby Lake Pavilion at the west end of the lake. Other attractions *Burnaby Lake Nature House *Butterfly garden *Piper Spit pier *Burnaby Sports Complex *Wildlife Rescue Association The park is open from 8am to 9pm between the start of Daylight Saving Time (second Sunday of March) to Labour Day, and 8am to dusk for the rest of the year. Dredging Over the past decades, sediment has been filling up the lake, reducing the average lake depth. The lake is no longer suitable for competitive paddling sports, normal ecological balance has been disrupted, and parts of it are in danger of being reduced to mudflats and wetlands. The city removed 360,000 cubic metres of sediment, as part of the \\"Burnaby Lake Rejuvenation Project\\", in August 2006.

A politician who is seen as having committed political suicide might be forced to resign from either external public pressure (such as the threat of civil unrest) or internal pressure from superiors or colleagues. A political party as a whole could also lose much of its public support by deviating greatly from its core values and policies from which the party was founded on. For example, the phrase \\"the longest suicide note in history\\" is an epithet originally used by United Kingdom Labour Party MP Gerald Kaufman to describe his party's left wing manifesto of 1983. While natural deviation in policy is expected as history progresses, demographics change, and new challenges present themselves, too strong of an unexpected deviation from core values can be unpalatable to base supporters, resulting in a major loss of public confidence. The portmanteau \\"politicide\\" is also sometimes used. For example, in The Kansas City Star on 23 February 1996: \\"James didn't even finish his inaugural address before committing politicide.\\"The Kansas City Star quote is the second example of the use politicide as political suicide by the Oxford English Dictionary Since June 2019, Former Maryland Representative John Delaney accused Senator Bernie Sanders and Senator Elizabeth Warren of running on \\"political suicide,\\" due to their healthcare plan, dubbed as \\"Medicare for all,\\" throughout the 2020 Democratic Party presidential primaries.

Andrew Lang included it in The Pink Fairy Book. Synopsis A rich man divided his property among his three sons when he died. The king offered his daughter to whoever built a ship that traveled over both land and sea. The oldest son tried, and when old men came to beg for work, sent them all away. He spent all his money on it, and a squall destroyed it. The second son tried after him, but ended up the same. The youngest thought to try as well, because he was not rich enough to support all three of them. He hired everyone, included a little old man with a white beard whom his brothers had rejected but whom he appointed as overseer. This old man was a holy hermit. When the ship was done, he told the youngest son to lay claim to the princess. The youngest son asked him to stay with him, and the hermit asked him for half of everything he got. The son agreed. As they traveled, they came across a man putting fog in a sack, and at the hermit's suggestion, the son asked him to come with them, and so with a man tearing up trees, a man drinking a stream dry, a man shooting a quail in the Underworld, and a man whose steps bestrode an island. The king did not want to give his daughter to a man of whom he knew nothing. He ordered the son to take a message to the Underworld and back in an hour. The long-legged man brought it, but fell asleep in the Underworld, so the man who could shoot shot him, waking him. The king then demanded a man who could drink half his cellar dry in a day; the man who drank the stream drank the whole cellar dry. The king agreed to the marriage, but promised only as much dowry as one man could carry, though it was unfit for a princess. The strong man, who had torn up trees, carried off every piece of treasure the king had. When the king chased them, the man let the fog from the sack, and they escaped. The son divided the gold with the hermit, but the hermit pointed out that he had gotten the king's daughter, too. The son drew his sword to cut her in pieces, but the hermit stopped him, and gave him back all the treasure too, promising to come to his aid if ever he needed it.

Its aim is to focus public attention on emerging issues which pose a threat to the freedom and privacy of Australians, and also takes a leading role on issues of defending rights of individuals to control access to personal information and to be free of excessive intrusions.  History  The organisation was initially formed on 31 August 1987 at the Sebel Town House, Kings Cross, Sydney for the sole purpose of coordinating public resistance against the Australia Card, first proposed as part of the 1985 Federal Budget. The media were attracted to the launch on account of support for the movement by a number of high-profile persons including Peter Garrett, Alan Jones, Ben Lexcen, and Janine Haines. After the group led the charge in successfully defeating the Australia Card, it was clear to the group that an ongoing national voice for privacy protection was needed in Australia. During the remaining years of the 1980s, the Foundation's focus was to ensure that the tax file number (TFN) scheme did not become an ID Card in disguise, and to lobby both state and federal governments for the enactment of national privacy legislation. The first summit organised by the Foundation brought together officials from the Australian Taxation Office, politicians and privacy advocates together to examine the TFN proposals, and exposed many weaknesses in the proposals which the Government was subsequently forced to rectify. The organisation has remained strongly focussed on policy matters. It has made many submissions to Parliamentary Committees, government agencies, industry associations and corporations. It has run a number of campaigns, in relation to such matters as credit reporting, government proposals to create identification schemes, and privacy and the media. Since 2008, it has become more proactive, developing a series of Policy Statements on matters of particular significance. The organisation also provides a set of resources for people undertaking research into privacy issues in Australia. These include outlines of and links to privacy oversight agencies, and NGOs in the privacy, human rights and consumer rights space, and titles of and links to laws in Australia's nine jurisdictions that provide privacy protections.  Board  The organisation operated continuously for its first 15 years, but on an informal basis. This included the establishment of a web-site in 1998. It was incorporated in 2002. The organisation has a governing board, consisting of fifteen members of whom four are officers (Chair, two Vice-Chairs, a Treasurer and a Secretary). Members are appointed for a period of one year, with all positions falling vacant at the next Annual General Meeting. The Board is supported by an Advisory Panel of leading Australian public figures. The Smith Awards In 2005 the Australian Privacy Foundation announced the Smith Awards. These are named conjointly after: * Winston Smith, the protagonist of George Orwell's novel Nineteen Eighty-Four * the common use of the name Smith as a pseudonym to protect one's anonymity, and * Ewart Smith, the Australian retired public servant who was instrumental in the demise of the Australia Card Bill in 1987.Australian Privacy Foundation: Australian Big Brother Awards; Retrieved 1 June 2013  References  * The Loose Cannon: An overview of campaigns of opposition to National Identity Card proposals by Simon Davies, Director, Privacy International and Visiting Fellow, The London School of Economics (London, February 2004)  External links  * Australian Privacy Foundation * \\"APF Policy Statements and Submissions\\" * \\"APF Resources for Privacy Researchers\\" * \\"APF Advisory Panel\\" * \\"Bennett C.J.

He served as the team's first general manager and later worked as a scout for the Phoenix Suns. Background Hailing from Iowa, Klein played basketball at Northwestern University. He then competed for the United States Navy's Great Lakes Blue Jackets, who traveled throughout the United States raising money for the Navy Relief Society. From 1945 to 1946, Klein played professionally for the National Basketball League's Chicago American Gears. He also dabbled in minor league baseball, spending one summer as a pitcher in the Cleveland Indians' farm system. Once his playing days were over, he moved to the Chicago suburbs and embarked on a highly successful career distributing promotional items to banks and other companies. Founding of the Chicago Bulls The late 1940s through early 1960s were a low point for professional basketball in Chicago. The American Gears suddenly folded in 1947 due to poor financial decisions by owner Maurice White. Three years later, the Chicago Stags of the early National Basketball Association disbanded due to lack of fan interest. The NBA returned to Chicago with the Chicago Packers in 1961, but their poor first season record (18-62) turned off many fans, and the team was sold to a group of Maryland investors in 1962. The Chicago Packers were scheduled to relocate to Baltimore by the fall of 1963. In the meantime, the team adopted a new nickname, the Chicago Zephyrs. Hoping to keep the Zephyrs in Chicago, Dick Klein tried to purchase the team in 1963, but he failed, and the team left the city after posting a 25-55 second season record. However, Klein was determined to bring professional basketball back to Chicago, and started recruiting local businessmen to help him found an expansion team. Most investors were skeptical of Klein's venture, given the failure of the Zephyrs and their predecessors. A turning point occurred when Klein received the support of the American Broadcasting Company, who was negotiating with the NBA for television rights. ABC believed a successful Chicago team would help boost ratings, and once Klein had their backing, he was able to attract more partners. On January 26, 1966, his group was finally awarded an NBA expansion franchise at a cost of $1.6 million,Hirsley, Michael. \\"Dick Klein, Bulls' founder and 1st CEO, dies at 80\\". Chicago Tribune. October 12, 2000. p. 7. and Klein was named general manager. Klein's first task was to coin a nickname for the new Chicago team. He wanted a name that evoked images of the Chicago stockyards, which were close to the stadium where the team was expected to play. According to Klein, he had originally considered Matadors or Toreadors, but when his youngest son dismissed these prospective nicknames as \\"a bunch of bull,\\" he decided to name the team the Chicago Bulls. He then recruited a neighbor to design the Bulls' familiar team logo.Hilkevitch, Jon. \\"Logo Designer Has Reason To Horn In On Bulls' Glory\\". Chicago Tribune. June 23, 1993.

Fort Madison Daily Democrat. March 25, 2004. Retrieved on October 20, 2012. Team management Klein selected Johnny \\"Red\\" Kerr and Al Bianchi to serve as the Bulls' head coach and assistant coach, respectively. Since both were former players who were still under contract with their old teams, Klein actually drafted his coaching staff via the NBA Expansion Draft. He then acquired Guy Rodgers, Jerry Sloan, Len Chappell, Jim Washington, Erwin Mueller, Don Kojis, and Bob Boozer to form the core playing unit for the Bulls. In support of the new team, Klein and Kerr paraded through Chicago in a flatbed truck, accompanied by a live bull.Hareas, John. \\"Coast to Coast: The NBA Expands\\". The Official NBA Encyclopedia. New York: Doubleday, 2000. Though the Bulls finished the 1966‚Äì67 NBA season with a 33-48 record, they still managed to reach the postseason. This was the first time any expansion franchise reached the playoffs in their first year, a feat that has not been repeated. They lost in the first round to the St. Louis Hawks in four games. Klein considered the season a success, saying, \\"We had good players led by good men, so we became competitive\\". However, the Bulls regressed the following season, winning just 29 games, and as the team struggled to increase attendance figures, tensions emerged between Klein and Kerr. Klein openly criticized Kerr in the local media, and he frequently sent notes to his coaching staff during games, which contained messages such as \\"That's seven turnovers this quarter\\". Tired of Klein's involvement, Kerr finally left the team in 1968 and was replaced by Dick Motta. Unfortunately, Klein feuded with Motta, as well. After Klein sent Erwin Mueller to the Seattle SuperSonics for cash in 1969, Motta reportedly said, \\"You can't play with money; money won't play!\\". Motta then ordered Klein to consult him before any trade he made in the future.Logan, Robert. \\"Bulls, Hawks share same sad story\\". Chicago Tribune. February 11, 1969. p. C3. Facing pressure from other members of team management, Klein stepped down as general manager before the start of the Bulls fourth season, but he retained his share of the ownership and saw the Bulls improve significantly under Motta during the next few seasons. The team won 51 games during the 1970‚Äì71 season and 57 games the next season, and the Bulls began to secure a steady fan base. After the Bulls Klein orchestrated the sale of several owners' shares of the team (including his own) to a new ownership group that included Chicago Blackhawks owner Arthur Wirtz in the summer of 1972. \\"In my opinion, with Wirtz at the steering wheel, the Bulls were in good hands,\\" he later said. The Bulls eventually became one of the NBA's most profitable franchises, due in large part to the presence of Michael Jordan during the 1980s and 1990s (Wirtz, in turn, sold the Bulls to current owner Jerry Reinsdorf in 1984). Many of Klein's personnel selections blossomed into long-term NBA successes, including Utah Jazz coach Jerry Sloan, and sports magnate Jerry Colangelo, who worked in Klein's front office in the Bull's early years. Klein's friendship with Colangelo and continued passion for the sport led him to serve as a Southeastern scout for the Phoenix Suns. He served in that capacity until shortly before his death in Greenville, South Carolina in 2000.

In the case of a digital message, it is the time from the first bit until the last bit of a message has left the transmitting node. The packet transmission time in seconds can be obtained from the packet size in bit and the bit rate in bit/s as: :Packet transmission time = Packet size / Bit rate Example: Assuming 100 Mbit/s Ethernet, and the maximum packet size of 1526 bytes, results in :Maximum packet transmission time = 1526√ó8 bit / (100 √ó 106 bit/s) ‚âà 122 Œºs Propagation delay The transmission time should not be confused with the propagation delay, which is the time it takes for the first bit to travel from the sender to the receiver (During this time the receiver is unaware that a message is being transmitted). The propagation speed depends on the physical medium of the link (that is, fiber optics, twisted-pair copper wire, etc.) and is in the range of 2\\\\times10^8 meters/sec for copper wires and 3\\\\times10^8 for wireless communication, which is equal to the speed of light. The ratio of actual propagation speed to the speed of light is also called the velocity factor of the medium. The propagation delay of a physical link can be calculated by dividing the distance (the length of the medium) in meter by its propagation speed in m/s. :Propagation time = Distance / propagation speed Example: Ethernet communication over a UTP copper cable with maximum distance of 100 meter between computer and switching node results in: :Maximum link propagation delay ‚âà 100 m / (200 000 000 m/s) = 0.5 Œºs Packet delivery time The packet delivery time or latency is the time from when the first bit leaves the transmitter until the last is received. In the case of a physical link, it can be expressed as: :Packet delivery time = Transmission time + Propagation delay In case of a network connection mediated by several physical links and forwarding nodes, the network delivery time depends on the sum of the delivery times of each link, and also on the packet queuing time (which is varying and depends on the traffic load from other connections) and the processing delay of the forwarding nodes. In wide-area networks, the delivery time is in the order of milliseconds. Roundtrip time The round-trip time or ping time is the time from the start of the transmission from the sending node until a response (for example an ACK packet or ping ICMP response) is received at the same node. It is affected by packet delivery time as well as the data processing delay, which depends on the load on the responding node. If the sent data packet as well as the response packet have the same length, the roundtrip time can be expressed as: :Roundtrip time = 2 √ó Packet delivery time + processing delay In case of only one physical link, the above expression corresponds to: :Link roundtrip time = 2 √ó packet transmission time + 2 √ó propagation delay + processing delay If the response packet is very short, the link roundtrip time can be expressed as close to: :Link roundtrip time ‚âà packet transmission time + 2 √ó propagation delay + processing delay Throughput The network throughput of a connection with flow control, for example a TCP connection, with a certain window size (buffer size), can be expressed as: :Network throughput ‚âà Window size / roundtrip time In case of only one physical link between the sending and transmitting nodes, this corresponds to: :Link throughput ‚âà Bitrate √ó Transmission time / roundtrip time The message delivery time or latency over a network depends on the message size in bit, and the network throughput or effective data rate in bit/s, as: :Message delivery time = Message size / Network throughput  See also  * Minimum-Pairs Protocol * End-to-end delay References *Behrouz A.

It was designed by Brazilian architect Oscar Niemeyer and projected by Brazilian structural engineer Joaquim Cardozo, and was completed and dedicated on May 31, 1970. The cathedral is a hyperboloid structure constructed from 16 concrete columns, weighing 90 tons each. Description Cathedral and the bell tower In the square access to the cathedral, are four tall bronze sculptures representing the four Evangelists created by sculptor Dante Croce in 1968. A tall bell tower containing four large bells donated by Spanish residents of Brazil and cast in Miranda de Ebro also stands outside the cathedral, to the right as visitors face the entrance. At the entrance of the cathedral is a pillar with passages from the life of Mary, mother of Jesus, painted by Athos. A wide, deep reflecting pool surrounds the cathedral roof, helping to cool the cathedral. Visitors pass under this pool when entering the cathedral. The cathedral is capable of holding up to 4,000 people. The baptistery is to the left of the entrance, and can be entered either from the cathedral or via a spiral staircase from the entrance plaza. The walls of the oval baptistery are covered in ceramic tiles painted in 1977 by Athos Bulc√£o. Offices for the Archdiocese of Brasilia were completed in 2007 next to the cathedral. The building connects directly to the cathedral underground. Visitors enter into the cathedral through a dark tunnel and emerge into a bright space with a glass roof. The outer roof of the cathedral is composed of sixteen pieces of fiberglass, each wide at the base and long inserted between the concrete pillars. Under this is suspended a stained glass work originally created in 1990 by Marianne Peretti, in shades of blue, green, white, and Brown. Inside the cathedral over the nave are sculptures of three angels, suspended by steel cables. The shortest is long and weighs , the middle one long and weighs , and the largest is long and weighs . The sculptures are by Alfredo Ceschiatti, with the collaboration of Dante Croce in 1970. The altar was donated by Pope Paul VI and the image of the patron saint Our Lady of Aparecida is a replica of the original which is in Aparecida - S√£o Paulo. The Way of the Cross is a work of Di Cavalcanti. Interior with angel sculptures Under the main altar is a small chapel accessible by steps from on either side of and behind the altar. Artistic interpretation The Cathedral of Brasilia, officially the Metropolitan Cathedral of Our Lady of Aparecida (Catedral Metropolitana Nossa Senhora Aparecida), dedicated to the Blessed Virgin Mary under her title of Our Lady of Aparecida, proclaimed by the Church as Queen and Patroness of Brazil, was designed by the architect Oscar Niemeyer and projected by the structural engineer Joaquim Cardozo. This concrete-framed hyperboloid structure, appears with its glass roof to be reaching up, open, to heaven. Most of the cathedral is below ground, with only the diameter roof of the cathedral, the ovoid roof of the baptistry, and the bell tower visible above ground. The shape of the roof is based in a hyperboloid of revolution with asymmetric sections. The hyperboloid structure consists of 16 identical concrete columns assembled on site. These columns, having hyperbolic section and weighing , represent two hands moving upwards to heaven. History Cathedral with baptistry in the foreground The cornerstone was laid on September 15, 1958, and the structure was finished on April 21, 1960, with only the roof structure visible above ground. Once the presidential term of Juscelino Kubitschek ended, the big push to finish many structures in Brasilia stalled. Although it is likely that Kubitschek intended the cathedral as an \\"ecumenical cathedral\\" to be paid for by the state and open to all faiths, governments after that did not provide funding, and the building was eventually turned over to the Catholic Church to complete. The cathedral was consecrated on October 12, 1968 (still with no roof), and was officially opened by Cardinal D. Eugenio Salles on May 31, 1970. The ovoid baptistry was dedicated on October 5, 1977, and the cathedral was declared a national historic and artistic monument on July 15, 1990. The cathedral sees some 1,000,000 visitors each year, Coinciding with the 50th anniversary of Brasilia, major renovations were begun on April 21, 2012 to update and repair the building and infrastructure, and address issues with the roof. The exterior glazing is being replaced, and the original stained glass designed by Marianne Peretti (which used hand made glass and thus varied widely in thickness) is being replaced by uniform glass cut and assembled in Brazil from plates manufactured in Germany. In addition to the roof repairs, all marble surfaces will be polished, concrete repaired and painted, the angels in the nave will be cleaned and re-mounted, and the bell mechanisms will be replaced. The cathedral will be open to the public during renovation.

It began as a small European-styled family hotel and formed part of the tourist precinct in and around the Kings Cross area of Sydney. It was claimed as one of the world's great rock-and-roll hotels. By the mid-1960s the Sebel had gained an international reputation for its intimacy and attention. The hotel staff made a point of meeting any request, no matter how difficult, and their ability to turn a blind eye to the excesses and idiosyncrasies of guests made it a favourite haunt of entertainers. Its tiny late-night bar became a favourite haunt of musicians and of stars of stage and screen, whose autographed photos lined the walls. During the day, throngs of teenagers lined up across the road screaming for their idols. During the 1970s and 1980s, the Sebel Townhouse became the unofficial home of the Australian music industry. Australian artists rubbed shoulders with touring guests like Elton John, David Bowie and Dire Straits. In 1984 it hosted the reception of Elton John's wedding to Renate Blauel. By the 1990s Kings Cross had become more sleazy, and the Sebel's glamour had also begun to fade. New hotels had sprung up around the city, closer to the harbour's edge, and the Sebel could no longer attract the same kind of clientele.

Khawaja made his first-class cricket debut for New South Wales in 2008 and played his first international match for Australia in January 2011. Khawaja has also played county cricket for Derbyshire, Glamorgan and Lancashire, and Twenty20 cricket in the Indian Premier League for the now defunct Rising Pune Supergiant franchise. Domestic career Khawaja in 2011 A left-handed top order batsman, Khawaja was awarded Player of the Australian Under-19 Championship in 2005 and also played for Australia in the 2006 U-19 Cricket World Cup in Sri Lanka as an opening batsman. He made his first-class debut for the New South Wales Blues in 2008. In the same year, he hit consecutive double centuries for the NSW Second XI‚Äîa feat never before achieved by a NSW player. On 22 June 2010 it was announced by Cricket Australia that Usman Khawaja would be a part of the Australian touring squad to play Pakistan in a two Test series in England. Since 2011, Khawaja has played for the Sydney Thunder in the Big Bash League. In BBL05, he was the second highest run scorer (345 runs) and averaged 172.50 runs per match. Khawaja signed a contract to play for county side Derbyshire in the 2011 English domestic season. He played in four County Championship matches, averaging 39.87 with the bat and scoring a century (135) against Kent. After his county stint, he made five further Test appearances in 2011, scoring one half-century (65) against South Africa. He was dropped from Australia's Test team after the home series against New Zealand, making way for Shaun Marsh upon Marsh's return from injury. Lancashire signed Khawaja as an overseas player for the 2014 county season for all formats. Khawaja scored 86 runs on his debut against Durham but in vain as Lancashire lost by 27 runs. He plays club cricket for Valley District Cricket Club in Brisbane. In August 2015, Khawaja was appointed as captain of the Queensland cricket team, replacing previous captain James Hopes. In April 2018, he was signed by Glamorgan County Cricket Club to play in the 2018 Vitality Blast tournament in England. International career Khawaja was selected as part of the 17-man Australian squad for the 2010‚Äì11 Ashes series. During the third Test, Ricky Ponting fractured his finger and Khawaja was named as a stand-by if Ponting could not recover in time. He was subsequently selected in the Australian cricket team to play in the fifth Test against England in Sydney on 3 January 2011. On 3 January 2011, Khawaja became the 419th Australian to be presented with an Australian Cricket Test baggy green cap. Khawaja became the first Muslim and first Pakistani-born Australian player to play Test cricket for Australia, and only the seventh foreign-born cricketer to do so in the last 80 years. Before the third Test against India in March 2013, Australia suspended Khawaja, along with James Pattinson, Shane Watson and Mitchell Johnson following a breach of discipline. Michael Clarke, the captain, revealed that the step had been taken as a result of repeated infractions which led to Watson flying back home and contemplating Test retirement. Some former players reacted with astonishment at the decision taken by the team management. Khawaja made his Test return in the second Test of the 2013 Ashes series, replacing Ed Cowan. In his first Test in more than two years, he scored his maiden Test century, in the first Test against New Zealand on 5 November 2015, in which he scored 174 with 16 fours and 2 sixes. He made this return in his tenth Test in the coveted number 3 position, helping Australia to an emphatic victory. Since his return to Test cricket, Khawaja has scored 4 centuries in 6 matches. He made his Twenty20 International debut for Australia against India on 31 January 2016. During the 2015‚Äì16 season, Khawaja was in spectacular form for Australia and his domestic T20 franchise the Sydney Thunder, with many pundits hailing his renaissance as a batsman since being dropped from the Australian team in 2013 and recovering from an injury in 2015. He also switched to using Kookaburra equipment. Additionally, Khawaja set a record for becoming the first ever batman to score Test century in an innings of a Day- Night Test match at home soil and still has the record for the second highest individual score in a Day-Night Test innings. Khawaja played his first Test match against the country of his birth, Pakistan, on 15 December 2016 at the Gabba. When asked about the significance of the match, he described a moment of confusion outside the change rooms: \\"Funnily enough I was waiting downstairs and I needed the change room locker to be opened for us and I was just waiting and the Queensland Cricket lady came down. She was like 'Oh, you need the locker rooms open?' I went 'yes please' and she started walking to the Pakistani change room. I was like, 'No, I'm that way, thank you'. In January 2017 Khawaja dabbed in celebration of his half-century scored in a Test match against Pakistan in Sydney. His move received mixed reactions, with some praising it, while others accused him of disrespecting his opponents. In April 2018, he was awarded a national contract by Cricket Australia for the 2018‚Äì19 season. He played a match saving innings against Pakistan in the first test in 2018 at Dubai. In April 2019, he was named in Australia's squad for the 2019 Cricket World Cup. In Australia's final group-stage match, against South Africa, Khawaja picked up a hamstring injury, ruling him out of the rest of the tournament. Matthew Wade was named as cover for him. In July 2019, he was named in Australia's squad for the 2019 Ashes series in England. In the series, he returned the scores of 13, 40, 36, 2, 8 and 23, failing to convince. Therefore for the fourth Ashes Test, Steve Smith replaced Khawaja after returning from concussion, whilst Marnus Labuschagne retained his place in the side. On 16 July 2020, Khawaja was named in a 26-man preliminary squad of players to begin training ahead of a possible tour to England following the COVID-19 pandemic He was not included in the final squad for the tour. International centuries , he has scored 8 test and 2 ODI centuries. Personal life Khawaja was born in Islamabad, Pakistan, and his family emigrated to New South Wales when he was 5. He became the first Australian of Pakistani origin to represent Australia when he made his debut in the 2010‚Äì11 Ashes series. He is a qualified commercial and instrument-rated pilot, completing a bachelor's degree in Aviation from the University of New South Wales before he made his Test debut. He attained his basic pilot licence before his driving licence. He was educated at Westfields Sports High School. Usman Khawaja announced his engagement on 14 December 2016 on his Facebook page. and subsequently married his wife Rachel on 6 April 2018.

Early life Evans was born in Wanstead, England (then a town in Essex county, now a north-eastern suburb of London), the daughter of architect Henry Evans and his wife Louisa, who came from a family of lawyers. She attended school in the London suburb of Woodford, before her family moved to Sydney, New South Wales, Australia in 1883. There she attended Sydney Girls High School, and began her tertiary education at the University of Sydney, graduating with a Bachelor of Arts degree in 1895. Following graduation, she intended to establish a school with her sister in the inner-western suburb of Summer Hill, but abandoned the project after a period of illness. Legal career Later, encouraged by her mother Louisa, Evans enrolled again at the University of Sydney in 1899, this time in the Sydney Law School. Although the Dean of the school at the time, Pitt Cobbett, would by all accounts never have permitted a woman to enrol, he was absent overseas and Evans was able to enter the school. On his return, he declared to Evans \\"that she did not have the physique for law and would find medicine more suitable\\". The rules of practice in force in New South Wales at the time did not comprehend female lawyers, and there was no precedent of women becoming lawyers; when Evans attempted to register as a student-at-law with the Supreme Court of New South Wales, her application was rejected. Although the rules of practice legislation did not actually disqualify women from becoming lawyers, the common law at the time held that unless legislation specifically conferred rights or privileges on women, it did not apply to them, for women were not included in the definition of persons. Despite these setbacks, Evans persisted with her studies, and on 26 December 1902 graduated with a Bachelor of Laws degree, the first woman in Australia to do so. Ada Evans, admitted to the Bar in NSW, May 1921 Admission to New South Wales Bar Association After graduating, Evans applied for admission to the New South Wales Bar to practise as a barrister, but again her application was rejected on the basis of her sex. She was similarly prevented from being admitted to the English Bar. Evans and her supporters in women's organisations commenced a campaign for the laws to be changed to specifically allow women to practise. Such laws were enacted in other Australian states to specifically allow the admission of women, and in 1905 Flos Greig became the first female barrister in Australia, when she was admitted to the Victorian Bar (having become the first Victorian female law graduate in 1903). At this time, Evans also edited a weekly women's page in the Australian Star newspaper, her work incorporating \\"an underlying theme that truth and kindness were essential ingredients for human happiness.\\" The Parliament of New South Wales finally altered the law to enable women to practise law, with the passage of the Women's Legal Status Act 1918 late in 1918. Evans registered as a student-at- law in May 1919 and on 12 May 1921, after the requisite two years as a student, became the first woman to be admitted to the New South Wales Bar. However, although she was offered work as a barrister immediately, she declined to practise, citing her family commitments and the passage of time since her graduation and saying that she didn't want \\"women's standing in the profession to be undermined by a show of incompetence\\". Later life In 1909, Evans and her brother moved to the town of Bowral in the New South Wales Southern Highlands, where they bought a six hectare farming property called Kurkulla, where she died, aged 75, in 1947. She was cremated in Sydney.  Ada Evans Chambers In 1998, Sydney barrister Michael Maxwell opened a new barristers chambers in downtown Sydney NSW, named in honour of Ada Evans. The chambers was officially opened on 20 November 1998 by the Honourable Justice Mary Gaudron of the High Court of Australia. The opening was attended by Katherine Morgan (nee Evans), solicitor who was admitted in 1989. She is the first relative of Ada Evans to become a lawyer and is Ada's cousin's great grand-daughter. Mrs Morgan presented the Chambers with a copy of Ada Evans' graduation photograph from the University of Sydney. Ada Evans Chambers continues to operate today with a membership of 30 barristers with founding member Michael Maxwell still on the floor.

However, a decision ex aequo et bono is distinguished from a decision on the basis of equity (equity infra legem), \\"Whereas an authorisation to decide a question ex aequo et bono is an authorisation to decide without deference to the rules of law, an authorisation to decide on a basis of equity does not dispense the judge from giving a decision based upon law, even though the law be modified\\".O'Connell, International Law (2nd ed., 1970), Vol. 1, p. 14.

It was the first of the great thermae constructed in the city, and also the first public bath.  History  left In the bath's first form, completed in 25 BC, it was a hot-air room also known as a \\"laconian sudatorium or gymnasium\\".Cassius Dio (53.27.1) With the completion of the Aqua Virgo in 19 BC, the baths were supplied with water and with the addition of a large lake and canal (Stagnum Agrippae).(LacusCurtius website) Samuel Ball Platner, A Topographical Dictionary of Ancient Rome (London: Oxford University Press) 1929. See also note by William Thayer. Between the construction and Agrippa's death in 12 BC, the Baths were open to the public with an entrance fee charge. This charge was typically a quadrans. Upon his death, Agrippa left the baths to the citizens of Rome to use free of charge in exchange for donating various estates to Augustus, creating the first public bath structure.Dio LIV.29.4 The Baths of Agrippa were damaged along with many other structures by a large fire in AD 80,Cass. Dio LXVI.24: but were restored shortly thereafter by Domitian. The thermae were enlarged under Hadrian in the second century ADHist. Aug. Hadr. 19: Romae instauravit lavacrum Agrippae; cf. also a reference in CIL VI.9797 = AL 294 and later by the emperors Constantius and Constans in the fourth century AD. Sidonius Apollonaris mentions that the Baths of Agrippa were still being used in the fifth century.Regionary Catalogue (Reg. IX) In 599, Pope Gregory the Great transformed the Baths into a nunnery. In the 7th century the structure (no longer in use after the Ostrogoths cut off the Roman aqueducts in the 530s) was being mined for its building materials, but much of the Baths were still standing in the 16th century, when the ruins were drawn by Baldassare Peruzzi and Andrea Palladio, among others. Today just part of the circular wall of the rotunda remains.  The baths  Map of the Roman Campus Martius. Highlighted in red are the Baths of Agrippa. The first version of the Baths of Agrippa, also known as the Laconicum, was finished in 25 BCE. A laconicum appears to have been an earlier version of a heated bath which was also associated with a running track and exercise facilities for youths.Claridge, Amanda. Rome: An Oxford Archaeological Guide. Oxford: Oxford University Press (2010). Dio tells us that they ‚Äúgave the name Laconian to the gymnasium because the Lacedaemonians had a greater reputation at that time than any one else for stripping and exercising after anointing themselves with oil‚Äù. Agrippa also dedicated his Pantheon, the original structure where the current Trajanic reconstruction sits, in the same year. In fact, Cassius Dio claims that three structures were completed by Agrippa in this year, the third being the Stoa of Neptune, suggesting that all three were related. The Baths of Agrippa are the first known to have contained monumental sculpture, including the famous Apoxyomenos of Lysippus, the famed court sculptor of Alexander the Great. In fact, Pliny the Elder mentions the baths several times, noting that they were \\"a point of departure in artistic endeavor, implying that the building was perceived as groundbreaking in certain respects\\". Marble copy of the Apoxyomenos of Lysippus (Pius Clementine Museum, Vatican). The full version of the thermae, or Baths of Agrippa, did not come into use until after the completion of the Aqua Virgo in 19 BCE. This new aqueduct was paid for by Agrippa himself and was one of a series of works connected with Roman water supply and sewers over which Agrippa seems to have had managerial control. The Aqua Virgo is still in use today after almost 2000 years, terminating, and currently supplying the waters to, the Trevi Fountain.Reinhold, Meyer. Marcus Agrippa: A Biography. Geneva: The W.F. Humphrey Press (1933). These building projects were a few of the many which Agrippa undertook within the Roman Campus Martius and across the Empire, constituting aqueducts, fountains, porticoes, baths, roads, a voting precinct, a theatre, a bridge, and a harbour. Agrippa built up the area around the complex to include gardens with nice walks and colonnades with resting places and shelters from the sun. Wright claims that ‚ÄúThe total effect was somewhat like the Athenian gymnasia, the Lyceum, or the grove of Academus, but on a very much larger and more sumptuous scale.‚Äù That the bath itself could have served a multitude of functions, serving as a type of club with ‚Äúa restaurant, a reading-room, and a bathing establishment with every kind of bath then known, hot, tepid, cold, vapour, and shower‚Äù.Wright, F. A. Marcus Agrippa: Organizer of Victory. London: George Routledge & Sons Ltd (1937) Indeed, it would appear as though bathing had begun to become more complex around the time of the late Republic going into the early Empire, introducing three different types of rooms and pools: The frigidarium (cold pool), the tepidarium (or lukewarm to room temperature pool), and the caldarium (hot room and pool). Whether or not the caldarium within the Baths of Agrippa contained window glass to sufficiently heat up the room and keep the heat in, as was the case within the Baths of Trajan and other later examples of Imperial bathing facilities, remains unknown due to the scant archaeological evidence of the site. However, the baths, being a highly experimental project within the city of Rome, seem to have lacked a larger swimming pool, present in later Imperial bathing structures. It has been pointed out that this need could have been met with the man-made Stagnum (lake) of Agrippa or, more likely, the Euripus (canal) which allowed for runoff from the Stagnum to flow into the Tiber (please see below for more information on both the Stagnum and the Euripus). Agrippa's baths, along with his other work within the Campus Martius, were burned down in the great fire of 80 AD in the reign of Titus.Ward-Perkins, J.B. Roman Imperial Architecture. New York: Penguin Books, (1981) These appear to have been restored almost immediately during the reigns of either Titus or Domitian as Martial mentions they were often frequented.Reinhold, 1933: 165 Repairs and rebuilding were completed again under the Antonines as well as the Severan emperors. There was a further reconstruction during the reign of Constantius and Constans in 354‚Äì355 AD which was noted on an inscription found near Santa Maria in Monterone, found not far from the west side of the baths. Marble portrait head of Marcus Agrippa, currently in the Louvre.  Structure and location  Knowledge of the structure and location of the Baths of Agrippa is based on a small fragment of the Marble Plan that was discovered in 1900 as well as drawings made in the 16th century of the ruins while they were still standing. Today scant archaeological evidence of the Baths remains. It was constructed on the Campus Martius along with the original Pantheon under Agrippa's large building program. The area covered by the structure was about 110 meters North/South and 90 meters East/West. Along with the rest of Agrippa's buildings, the Baths were surrounded by gardens. There was a large rotunda (Arco Della Ciambella) on the north side of the building 25 meters in diameter, that is visible in the sketches found in the seventeenth century. The dome was believed to be a social gathering spot for the bathers. The area west of the rotunda had evidence of a hypocaust system and hollow terra-cotta tiles, indicating several heated rooms.  Adornment  The baths were decorated with glazed terracotta tiles, paintings,Pliny H.N. XXXV.26 and with the Apoxyomenos of Lysippus at the entrance.Pliny H.N. XXXV.62  Bathing in the Roman world  By the late Republic and into the early Principate, bathing within Rome had started to become more complex: Imperial bathing structures, including those of Agrippa, became grander and more and complex. According to some, no public bathing complexes were built for some time as they were felt to host shady activities. Recent studies state that while the building of certain structures was considered virtuous (such as temples, fora, roads, and aqueducts), other structures (brothels, taverns, and other lowly structures) were symbolic of vice.Fagan, Garrett G. Bathing in Public in the Roman World. Ann Arbour: The University of Michigan Press (2002) It would appear that public baths occupied a middle ground, \\"standing somewhere between useful public monuments and lowly havens of corporeal dissipation\\". This is a likely explanation as to why there were no senatorially decreed bathing complexes during the Republic. Although senators likely did not avoid the baths altogether, they did not want to spend public money on their construction. Tha later Baths of Trajan showing the frigidarium (N), the tepidarium (F), and the caldarium (C), a form which became popular in the late Republic to early Principate. Whether or not the Baths of Agrippa were symmetrical remains unknown due to the scant archaeological evidence which has survived. Before the completion of the Bath of Agrippa, during the Republic, water brought into the city via one of its many aqueducts was not used for baths. Owners of private bathing complexes were forced to purchase water which had run off from publicly accessible troughs. Marcus Vipsanius Agrippa innovated here as well, servicing his baths with water fed directly from his freshly built aqueduct, the Aqua Virgo. However, the Baths of Agrippa also began as a private bathing complex, paid for personally by Agrippa himself, who was, by this time, one of the most wealthy men in the Roman world. However, upon his death in 12 BCE, the baths were bequeathed to the Roman people in Agrippa's will, making it the first public bathing complex in the city of Rome (although not the first in the Empire). This action caused a change in attitudes within the Senate towards bathing complexes, removing their construction from the grey area and placing them into the realm of virtuous structures, although Agrippa's example was not repeated until Nero constructed his baths in the early to mid 60s AD. Indeed, it would seem as though the technological achievement of the baths was not lost on the Roman people, being able to control and contain vast amounts of water and even control the desired temperature at which certain pools were kept. Evidence suggests that bathing became much more popular within Rome during the first century BC, when far greater numbers of Romans began bathing in public with more frequency. These numbers again drastically increased during the first century AD. A passage within Varro states that when baths were originally introduced within the city of Rome there were separate sections for men and women, which is hinted at archaeologically within Republican baths, which often feature an architectural division. In a passage of Cicero, detailing a particularly heated exchange between L. Licinius Crassus and M. Junius Brutus, it is brought to light that it was considered improper at the time for father and son to bathe together. However, the passage also indicates that, although the senators were not building baths at the time, they were still frequenting the private bath houses. A trip to the Baths of Agrippa, along with other private baths, was meant to be a pleasurable experience. According to Lucian, commenting on a trip to the Baths of Hippias, they were \\"brightly lit throughout, adorned with marbles from Phrygia and Numidia, and inscribed with citations from Pindar\\". There appears one inscription that mentions a museum which was attached to a bathing complex where art was put on display and where discussions and lectures could be organized. Indeed, the baths of Rome have been recognized as social hubs within the Roman world, where members of the senatorial class would rub shoulders with the lower classes of society, even slaves, marking a strangely egalitarian feature of Roman life. The Baths of Agrippa appear to have featured the main three types of pools and rooms which were the staple of Roman baths: frigidarium (cold pool), tepidarium (mild/tepid pool), and caldarium (hot room and pool). There is research that suggests that these rooms could be visited in both orders, going from cold to hot, or hot to cold. The hottest of the rooms, the caldarium, would have relied on heating from under the floors, created by fanning hot air from fires underneath the water basin, as well as heat from the sun, a feature which exploded after window glass became increasingly popular throughout Rome. It has also been suggested that the ringing of a bell (tintinabulum) may have communicated to nearby Romans that the hot pools were open. However, this has also been criticized for various reasons of practicality, preferring the more reasonable explanation that bells were used to mark the imminent closing of the bathing complex.Simpson, Christopher J. ‚ÄúTintinabulum and Thermae: A Note on Martial‚Äù. In Soci√©t√© d‚Äô√âtudes Latines de Bruxelles. Vol. 163. pp. 114-119. Baths in the Roman world were a one-stop-shop of socialization, health, and entertainment; where one could exercise, play sports or ball games, play board games, philosophize, create business arrangements, and wash away the dirt and grime of everyday life within ancient Rome. There is no doubt that these complexes were microcosms of Roman life and even potentially small embodiments of the Roman world itself.Zajac, Natascha. \\"The thermae: a policy of public health or personal legitimation?\\" In Roman Baths and Bathing: Part 1. J. DeLaine & D. E. Johnston eds. No. 37. pp. 99-105 (1999).  The Aqua Virgo  Route of the Aqua Virgo to Rome. The Aqua Virgo was completed in 19 BCE and was the last of a series of constructions initiated by Agrippa concerning water management within the city of Rome. Without a proper water supply the Baths of Agrippa would not have been able to function. The Aqua Virgo provided this water, along with supplying regions VII, IX, and XIV. This complemented the Aqua Julia which Agrippa also built in 33 B.C. to supply regions II, III, V, VI, VIII, X, and XII.Lloyd, Robert B. \\"The Aqua Virgo, Eripus and Pons Agrippae\\". In American Journal of Archaeology. Vol. 83. No. 2. pp. 193-204 (1979) The source of the water transported by the aqueduct was located within the villa of Lucullus, 8 miles from the city along the Via Collatina. In antiquity, the Aqua Virgo travelled past the Baths of Agrippa, bringing water as far as the Trans Tiberim (across the Tiber), potentially using the Pons Agrippae (Bridge of Agrippa) to do so.Shipley, Frederick W. \\"Agrippa‚Äôs Building Activities\\" in Rome. St. Louis: Washington University Studies - New Series (1933) Today the Aqua Virgo is still in use, almost 2000 years after its initial opening, terminating at, and supplying the waters for, the Trevi Fountain.  Euripus  The Euripus was a canal which ran from the area of the Stagnum and drained into the Tiber. It was originally thought that Agrippa's lake was fed exclusively by the Aqua Virgo, using the canal to drain the lake directly into the Tiber. However, Strabo's mention of Agrippa setting up a statue (‚ÄúThe Fallen Lion‚Äù of Lysippus) in a grove which lay between the Stagnum and the Euripus leads one to believe that the two were actually distinct features of the landscape. Therefore, it seems likely that the canal was indeed fed exclusively by the Aqua Virgo with water that was mentioned to have been quite cold. In fact, Frontinus mentions that the waters were given to the Euripus by the Aqueduct which gave it its name, Euripus Virginis, essentially meaning the canal of the Aqua Virgo. Seneca also stated that he enjoyed bringing in the new year with a good-luck plunge into the Virgo, which he did in the Euripus. Thus, as Lloyd has suggested, the Euripus could have served as a cold plunge- pool for the Baths of Agrippa. The large size of the Euripus could also imply that it could have stood in as a swimming area for the baths.  Stagnum  The Stagnum, along with the Euripus were very likely added into the landscape as features to complement the pleasure gardens which Agrippa placed around his baths. The lake is most often placed to the west of the bath structure and, as previously mentioned above, there are, in fact, no references to anyone swimming in the Stagnum, using it in lieu of the lacking swimming pool in the bath structure. Some theories postulate the lake was lined with quays, suggesting that boating on the lake may have been popular. The Stagnum may have been fed by runoff waters from the baths. This runoff of used water would certainly have dissuaded people from swimming in the lake. However, it might appear more likely to some that the Aqua Virgo fed most of the water into the lake. The Stagnum was indeed quite large, being able to host a large banquet for Nero, hosted by Tigillinus, which was held on a raft towed by other boats. The lake could also have served a more practical purpose, serving as a drainage area for the low-lying region of the Campus Martius, which was prone to flooding throughout antiquity.

For nearly twenty years he was the editor of The Guardian, and is regarded as one of the leading editors of the second half of the twentieth century. Early life and career Hetherington was the son of Sir Hector Hetherington, professor of logic and philosophy at University College, Cardiff and later Principal of the University of Glasgow. His mother was Mary Ethel Alison Reid (1886-1966). He was educated at Gresham's School in Holt, Norfolk, from 1933 to 1937 and then at Corpus Christi College, Oxford from 1938 to 1940, but his time at Oxford was interrupted by the Second World War. Though his myopia initially kept him from duty in a combat regiment, eventually he joined the Royal Armoured Corps and subsequently transferred to the Northamptonshire Yeomanry. Shortly after the Normandy landings he was a tank captain advancing towards Vire when his tank was destroyed. He later took part in the relief of Antwerp and ended his army career as a major in the Intelligence Corps, during which time he wrote a Military Geography of Schleswig-Holstein. Based on three months as a trainee sub-editor for the Glasgow Herald, Hetherington was offered a posting after his demobilisation as managing editor of Die Welt, the first German national newspaper to be produced in the British zone after the war. The experience confirmed his decision to pursue a career in journalism rather than academia, and he rejoined the Glasgow Herald a year later as a sub-editor and writer of articles on defence matters. Editor of The Guardian In 1950, Hetherington moved to Manchester Guardian. There he caught the eye of the paper's editor, A. P. Wadsworth, who helped him win a Commonwealth Fund Fellowship and named him as foreign editor in 1953. When Wadsworth fell terminally ill three years later, the chairman of the paper, Laurence Scott, named Hetherington as Wadsworth's successor. Though there were three more senior journalists on staff, Scott wanted to transform The Guardian into a national newspaper, and wanted a younger man capable of overseeing the effort.Peter Preston, \\"Hetherington, (Hector) Alastair\\" in The Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, H.C.G. Matthew and Brian Harrison, eds. (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2004), vol. 26, p. 889. Within weeks of taking over as editor, Hetherington faced the question of how to respond to the Suez Crisis. His denunciation of Britain's involvement as an \\"act of folly, without justification in any terms but brief expediency\\" precipitated enormous criticism from thousands of readers, but an increase in circulation and Britain's subsequent withdrawal vindicated the young editor. Suez soon proved to be only the first of many causes Hetherington took up, as he used as his position to campaign for social justice, alleviating the poverty gap between northern and southern England, and nuclear disarmament. He was present at the founding of the Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament, attending preliminary meetings at the house of Lord Simon of Wythenshawe, with Sir Bernard Lovell and Bertrand Russell, but he did not join or support CND. He also gave evidence for the defence at the Lady Chatterley trial and became the first British editor to allow the word \\"fuck\\" to be used in his newspaper. Becoming a national newspaper During this time, Hetherington also was busy overseeing the evolution of the Manchester Guardian into a national newspaper. After dropping the word \\"Manchester\\" from the masthead in 1959, the paper opened a London headquarters two years later. The transition proved difficult, however, as sales dropped and advertising revenue failed to fill the gap. Hetherington himself was commuting by train between London and Manchester twice or three times weekly. Twice Scott sought to alleviate the problem by selling the paper to The Times, but was rebuffed the first time and stopped by Hetherington's unyielding opposition to the proposal in the second. Ultimately, thanks to the profits from The Guardian's sister publication, the Manchester Evening News, the paper weathered the move. As The Guardian's immediate prospects slowly improved, Hetherington focused on the task on turning paper into one capable of competing on a national level. He pushed for expanded features, including special supplements and the first op-ed page in a British daily. Such was his success by this point that Hetherington won Journalist of the Year at the National Press Awards in 1971. Politically the paper benefited from careful cultivation by Harold Wilson, though Hetherington's closest political friend was Jo Grimond. For more than twenty years Hetherington wrote leading articles which sought to promote Liberal- Labour co-operation to defeat the Conservatives. Though initially against America's involvement in Vietnam, after meeting with American military commanders on a trip to Saigon he changed the paper's stance opposing the conflict, a move that generated much internal staff dissent.Preston, op cit. Departure By the early 1970s The Guardian enjoyed a healthy circulation approaching 350,000;David Butler and Gareth Butler, British Political Facts 1900‚Äì1985 (London: St. Martin's Press, 1986), p. 493 nevertheless the paper continued to face financial challenges that exhausted Hetherington. As he approached the end of his second decade as editor, he considered the possibility of moving on to a less-demanding field such as academia. In 1975, however, he accepted an offer from his friend Michael Swann, the chairman of the BBC, to assume the vacant position of Controller of BBC Scotland. Later career Hetherington's time as Controller of BBC Scotland was not a happy one. He did much to invigorate programme output and appointed a number of specialist News correspondents including Helen Liddell and Chris Baur to try to increase Scotland's presence on the BBC networks . He also sought increased financial freedom from the BBC in London. Encountering a more bureaucratic organisation than the one he knew at The Guardian, he clashed with the director general of the BBC, Charles Curran. In 1978 he was sacked from the position by Curran's successor, Ian Trethowan and named as Manager of BBC Radio Highland. In 1982 he became research professor in media studies at Stirling University and in 1984 he succeeded Richard Scott as chairman of the Scott Trust. In 1989 he retired to the Isle of Arran, where he wrote and worked on projects before he was forced to give up such activities due to the onset of Alzheimer's disease in the mid-1990s. Personal life Hetherington was married twice. His first marriage was in 1957 to Miranda Oliver, a librarian who worked in the cuttings library at the Manchester Guardian. Together they had four children. After their divorce in 1978, Hetherington met Sheila Janet Cameron, a political consultant, in 1979 and married her later that year. Death and memorials Hetherington died on 3 October 1999 and is buried next to his parents in the cemetery in Tillicoultry, just south-east of the war memorial. The Institute of Contemporary Scotland's Academy of Merit makes an annual Alastair Hetherington Award for Humanitarian Service. In 1999, Stirling University instituted an annual Hetherington Memorial Lecture in his memory.

The film's main character, Lian Nichang, is loosely based on the protagonist of Liang Yusheng's novel Baifa Mon√º Zhuan, which served as source material for the 1982 film Wolf Devil Woman. However, Yu saw the film as a Romeo and Juliet story and said that the lovers' struggle against fate and their heroic duty inspired him more than the familiar trappings of most wuxia films.\\"Mad Blood Stirring\\" (p. 4) by Eleanor M. Farrell As such, the film departs significantly from the original source. A sequel, The Bride with White Hair 2, directed by David Wu, was released later in the same year. Plot Zhuo Yihang was raised by Taoist Ziyang of the Wudang Sect and groomed to be a chivalrous swordsman. He is tasked with leading a coalition force formed by the eight major orthodox martial arts sects to counter an evil cult. During a battle against the cult, Zhuo Yihang meets a young woman, Lian Nichang, and falls in love with her. She is an orphan and was raised by wolves as an infant before being adopted by Ji Wushuang, the conjoined twins who lead the cult. After consummating their romance, Lian Nichang decides to leave the cult and follow Zhuo Yihang in pursuit of an ordinary life away from the martial artists' community. Lian Nichang succeeds in leaving the cult after suffering great pains. Meanwhile, Zhuo Yihang returns to Wudang and is horrified to see that his fellows have been murdered. The coalition members believe that Lian Nichang is responsible so they attack her when she arrives to meet Zhuo Yihang. Zhuo Yihang is forced to turn against Lian Nichang. Devastated by her lover's betrayal, Lian Nichang morphs into a vicious white-haired killer and slays all the coalition members present. Suddenly, Ji Wushuang appears and reveals that he/she is actually the one who killed the Wudang members. Zhuo Yihang and Lian Nichang join forces to defeat and kill Ji Wushuang. However, even after the victory, Lian Nichang vows never to forgive Zhuo Yihang for betraying her and walks away while he looks on helplessly. In a brief epilogue set years later, Zhuo Yihang is alone in a remote mountain region guarding a rare flower that is said to bloom only once every several decades and has the ability to reverse the effects of ageing (turning white hair back to dark). Believing that it can cure the harm he has inflicted on Lian Nichang, he awaits for the return of his loved one and hopes that she will show up.

In 1971, his Ohio-based corporation was ranked as 47th among the nation's top 400 construction contractors. In 1983, DeBartolo was included on Forbes magazine's first Forbes 400 list of richest Americans.  Early years  The second of six children, DeBartolo was born in Youngstown, Ohio, a center of steel production that was also a major destination for immigrants from Southern and Eastern Europe. DeBartolo's parents, Anthony Paonessa and Rose Villani, had immigrated to the United States from Italy. DeBartolo never knew his biological father, who died suddenly before his birth. After Anthony Paonessa's death, Rose Villani Paonessa married Michael DeBartolo, and Edward took his stepfather's family name. Michael DeBartolo emigrated from Bari, Italy, with his family at age 17 and became a paving contractor and builder of warehouses and other structures. While a teenager, Edward DeBartolo began working, translating paving contracts for his stepfather, who did not read or write English. DeBartolo went on to earn a degree in civil engineering at the University of Notre Dame. Next came a decade of construction jobs with his stepfather. Capitalizing on his engineering skills, DeBartolo found himself serving in the Army Corps of Engineers during World War II. It was during the War, in 1944, that he married Marie Patricia Montani and incorporated his own company, The Edward J. DeBartolo Corporation.  Adult life and career  After the war ended, DeBartolo served as president of Michael DeBartolo Construction and as founder and president of his newly formed company. DeBartolo was able to take advantage of dramatic changes occurring across the US after World War II. As more Americans moved into suburbs, there was a corresponding increase in demand for convenient access to shopping. His first retail development was the construction of Gray's Drug Store and Sears, Roebuck and Co. department store in the \\"Uptown\\" area of Youngstown. DeBartolo's company was one of the first companies in the United States to build shopping centers in suburban communities. These shopping centers were initially plazas built as long strips, but soon DeBartolo began developing enclosed shopping malls as well, with brother Frank DeBartolo acting as architect. The Edward J. DeBartolo Corporation was the undisputed leader in the shopping mall industry from the birth of the industry until DeBartolo's death, owning almost one-tenth of all mall space in the United States. DeBartolo also branched out into other types of urban development and construction, such as hotels, office parks, and condominiums. He established a work ethic of fifteen-hour days and seven-day weeks. He once told his senior executives, \\"My wife has never seen me lie down while the sun was up.\\" By 1990, DeBartolo was estimated to have more than $1.4 billion in personal wealth. A powerful strategic thinker, DeBartolo began acquiring department store chains in the late 1980s. In 1986, he helped finance Robert Campeau's purchase of Allied Stores Corporation, a department store holding corporation that owned such iconic department store brands as Jordan Marsh and Maas Brothers, as well as specialty stores such as Bonwit Teller and Ann Taylor. DeBartolo lent Campeau $150 million to bridge the financing gap for the acquisition. Campeau repaid the money, and in 1986, DeBartolo assisted in financing Allied Stores Corporation's acquisition of Federated Department Stores, a department store holding company and the owner of, among other assets, Macy's and Bloomingdale's department stores. DeBartolo provided nearly $500 million in financing. In 1990, Federated went bankrupt, defaulting on the repayment of the loans made by DeBartolo; it emerged from bankruptcy after the ouster of Campeau in 1992 as a new public company under the name \\"Macy's, Inc.\\" During the course of the bankruptcy, DeBartolo's cash flow was severely impaired, due to Federated's nonpayment as well as the real estate recession of the time. DeBartolo's Federated positions were all realigned when Federated emerged from bankruptcy. In 1988, he partnered with Dillard's Department Stores to buy Higbee's of Cleveland, Ohio. In 1992, William Dillard, founder of Dillard's, bought DeBartolo's share, except for the property interest in Higbee's Public Square flagship store in Cleveland (sold to Tower City in 2001), and renamed it the Higbee chain. DeBartolo's idea of a retail real estate developer going forward with new projects easily and quickly, by virtue of anchor stores which he owned, would never become a reality. As a result of several years' impaired cash flow, DeBartolo prepared to take his company public as a real estate investment trust or \\"REIT\\". Most of DeBartolo's competitors were preparing to do the same, their operations suffering from a lack of capital in the private markets. In late 1993, the two largest shopping center companies at the time, DeBartolo and Simon were coming to the market simultaneously. Their advisors informed them that the capital markets could not absorb that much equity; either one of them must back down or prices would suffer severely. DeBartolo agreed to withdraw. In April, 1994, most of the properties owned by The Edward J. DeBartolo Corporation were transferred to DeBartolo Realty Corporation, a public REIT, in its initial public offering. The new company was chaired by Edward J. DeBartolo Jr.; DeBartolo Sr. was unwilling to deal personally with the constraints of running a public company. In 1996, DeBartolo Realty Corporation was acquired by Simon Property Group, the public REIT formed by DeBartolo's longtime competitors, Melvin and Herbert Simon. DeBartolo's contributions to the campus at the University of Notre Dame include DeBartolo Hall (the main classroom building) and DeBartolo Performing Arts Center (DPAC), both located on a quad that students refer to as \\"DeBartolo Quad\\". There is also a DeBartolo Hall on the campus of Youngstown State University (YSU), in his hometown of Youngstown, where DeBartolo has made many endowments to YSU. The DeBartolo Corporation continues to be based in nearby Boardman, Ohio.  Sporting interests  The headquarters of The DeBartolo Corporation in Boardman, Ohio with the San Francisco 49ers logo on the building, signifying the team's ownership by the DeBartolo-York family. DeBartolo purchased the San Francisco 49ers in 1977, giving the team to his son. DeBartolo Jr. devoted significant resources to the team, became an expert in team management and player relations, and made it the most successful NFL franchise in the 1980s. DeBartolo founded the Pittsburgh Maulers of the United States Football League in March 1983, but folded the team after the first season (1984) when the league announced it would move to a fall schedule, the same time as the NFL's Pittsburgh Steelers. The family also owned the Pittsburgh Penguins of the National Hockey League from February 1977 until selling it to an ownership group led by Howard Baldwin in November 1991. His team would win the Stanley Cup in 1991. He would be engraved onto the Stanley Cup along with his daughter Denise DeBartolo York. DeBartolo said at a rally after the first win that the occasion was \\"possibly the happiest moment of my life.\\" He owned the soccer team Pittsburgh Spirit from 1978 until 1986. While DeBartolo was unsuccessful in his attempt to purchase the Chicago White Sox in 1980, he owned and developed three thoroughbred racetracks - Thistledown in Cleveland, Remington Park in Oklahoma City, and Louisiana Downs in Bossier City, Louisiana. Death DeBartolo died of pneumonia on December 19, 1994 in Youngstown, Ohio at the age of 85.

Bayside, New York: Holocaust Resource Center and Archives. } Holocaust victims were people who were targeted by the government of Nazi Germany for various discriminatory practices due to their ethnicity, religion, political beliefs, or sexual orientation. These institutionalized practices came to be called The Holocaust, and they began with legalized social discrimination against specific groups, and involuntary hospitalization, euthanasia, and forced sterilization of those considered physically or mentally unfit for society. These practices escalated during World War II to include non-judicial incarceration, confiscation of property, forced labor, sexual slavery, medical experimentation, and death through overwork, undernourishment, and execution through a variety of methods, with the genocide of different groups as the primary goal. According to the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum (USHMM), the country's official memorial to the Holocaust, \\"The Holocaust was the murder of six million Jews and millions of others by the Nazis and their collaborators during World War II.\\" The museum puts the total number of murdered during the Holocaust at 17 million: 6 million Jews and 11 million others. Scope of usage While the term Holocaust generally refers to the systematic mass murder of the Jewish people in German-occupied Europe, the Nazis also murdered a large number of non- Jewish people who were also considered subhuman (Untermenschen) or undesirable. Some victims belonged to several categories targeted for extermination, e.g. an assimilated Jew who was a member of a communist party or someone of Jewish ancestry who identified as one of Jehovah's Witnesses. Non-Jewish victims of Nazism included Slavs (e.g. Russians, Belarusians, Poles, Ukrainians and Serbs), Romanis (gypsies), LGBT people (lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender); the mentally or physically disabled, mentally ill; Soviet POWs, Roman Catholics, Protestants, Jehovah's Witnesses, Bah√° º√≠ Faith, Spanish Republicans, Freemasons, people of color (especially the Afro-German Mischlinge, called \\"Rhineland Bastards\\" by Hitler and the Nazi regime), and other minorities not considered Aryan (Herrenvolk, or part of the \\"master race\\"); leftists, communists, trade unionists, capitalists, social democrats, socialists, anarchists, and other dissidents who disagreed with the Nazi regime.. Berenbaum, Michael. \\"A mosaic of victims of Nazism\\", Encyclop√¶dia Britannica. Taking into account all of the victims of persecution, the Nazis systematically murdered an estimated six million Jews and an additional 11 million people during the war. Donald Niewyk suggests that the broadest definition, including Soviet civilian deaths, would produce a death toll of 17 million.A figure of 26.3 million is given in Service d'Information des Crimes de Guerre: Crimes contre la Personne Humain, Camps de Concentration. Paris, 1946, pp. 197‚Äì198. Other references: Christopher Hodapp, Freemasons for Dummies, 2005; Raul Hilberg, The Destruction of the European Jews, 2003; Martin Gilbert, Atlas of the Holocaust, 1993; Israel Gutman, Encyclopedia of the Holocaust, 1995. Despite widely varying treatment (some groups were actively targeted for genocide while others were not), some died in concentration camps such as Dachau and others from various forms of Nazi brutality. According to extensive documentation (written and photographic) left by the Nazis, eyewitness testimony by survivors, perpetrators and bystanders and records of the occupied countries, most perished in death camps such as Auschwitz-Birkenau. Ethnic criteria Jews ghetto in ≈Å√≥d≈∫ in 1942 The military campaign to displace persons like the Jews from Germany and other German-held territories during World War II, often with extreme brutality, is known as the Holocaust. It was carried out primarily by German forces and collaborators, German and non-German. Early in the war, millions of Jews were concentrated in urban ghettos. In 1941, Jews were massacred, and by December, Hitler had decided to exterminate all Jews living in Europe at that time. The European Jewish population was reduced from 9,740,000 to 3,642,000; the world's Jewish population was reduced by one-third, from roughly 16.6 million in 1939 to about 11 million in 1946.American Jewish Committee, Harry Schneiderman and Julius B. Maller, eds., American Jewish Year Book, Vol. 48 (1946‚Äì1947), Press of Jewish Publication Society of America, Philadelphia, 1946, page 599 The extermination of Jews had been a priority to the Nazis, regardless of the consequences.The institutionalisation of cosmopolitan morality: the holocaust and human rights. Levy, Sznaider; Daniel, Natan In January 1942, during the Wannsee Conference, several Nazi leaders discussed the details of the \\"Final Solution to the Jewish Question\\" (Endl√∂sung der Judenfrage) and German State Secretary Josef B√ºhler urged conference chairman Reinhard Heydrich to proceed with the Final Solution in the General Government. Jewish populations were systematically deported from the ghettos and the occupied territories to the seven camps designated as Vernichtungslager (extermination camps): * Auschwitz-Birkenau * Belzec * Chelmno * Majdanek * Maly Trostenets * Sobib√≥r * Treblinka In 1978, Sebastian Haffner wrote that in December 1941, Hitler began to accept the failure of his primary goal‚Äîto dominate Europe, after his declaration of war against the United States, and his withdrawal‚Äîwas compensated for by his secondary goal: the extermination of the Jews.Sebastian Haffner, The Meaning of Hitler , translated from Anmerkungen zu Hitler, Publishing house. Fischer Taschenbuch, Frankfurt am Main. . As the Nazi war machine faltered during the war's final years, military resources such as fuel, transport, munitions, soldiers and industrial resources were still diverted from the fronts to the death camps. photograph depicting Polish Jews captured by Germans during the Warsaw Ghetto Uprising, May 1943 Poland, home of the world's largest Jewish community before the war, lost 3,300,000 (90 percent) of its Jewish population. Although reports of the Holocaust had reached Western leaders, public awareness in the United States and other democracies of the mass murder of Jews in Poland was low at the time; the first references in The New York Times, in 1942, were unconfirmed reports rather than front-page news. Greece, Yugoslavia, Hungary, Lithuania, Bohemia, the Netherlands, Slovakia and Latvia lost over 70 percent of their Jewish populations; in Belgium, Romania, Luxembourg, Norway, and Estonia, the figure was about 50 percent. Over one-third of the Soviet Union's Jews were killed; France lost about 25 percent of its Jewish population, Italy between 15% and 20%. Denmark evacuated nearly all of its Jews to nearby neutral Sweden; the Danish resistance movement, with the assistance of many Danish citizens, evacuated 7,220 of the country's 7,800 Jews by sea to Sweden, Leo Goldberger: The Rescue of the Danish Jews: Moral Courage Under Stress, NYU Press, 1987, preface pages XX-XXI Linked 2014-04-29 in vessels ranging from fishing boats to private yachts. The rescue allowed the vast majority of Denmark's Jewish population to avoid capture by the Nazis. Jews outside Europe under Axis occupation were also affected by the Holocaust in Italian Libya, Algeria, Tunisia, Morocco, Iraq, Japan, and China. Although Jews are an ethnoreligious group, they were defined by the Nazis on purely racial grounds. The Nazi Party viewed the Jewish religion as irrelevant, persecuting Jews in accordance with antisemitic stereotypes of an alleged biologically determined heritage. Defining Jews as the chief enemy, Nazi racial ideology was also used to persecute other minorities. Slavs The Slavs were one of the most widely persecuted groups during the war, with many Poles, Russians, Ukrainians, Slovenes, Serbs and others killed by the Nazis. According to British historian Ian Kershaw, the Nazis' genocide and brutality was their way of ensuring Lebensraum (\\"living space\\") for those who met Hitler's narrow racial requirements; this necessitated the elimination of Bolsheviks and Slavs: =Poles= brutal persecution under Nazi occupation. The Nazi occupation of Poland was among the most brutal of the war, resulting in the death of more than 1.8 million ethnic Poles and about 3 million Polish Jews. The six million Jewish, Roman Catholic and Orthodox Poles represented nearly 17 percent of the country's population.Craughwell, Thomas J., The Gentile Holocaust Catholic Culture, Accessed July 18, 2008 Poles were one of Hitler's first extermination targets, as he outlined in a 22 August 1939 speech to Wehrmacht commanders before the invasion. Intelligentsia, socially prominent, and influential people were primarily targeted, although ethnic Poles and other Slavic groups were also killed en masse. Hundreds of thousands of Roman Catholic and Orthodox Poles were sent to Auschwitz-Birkenau and other concentration camps, and the intelligentsia were the first targets of the Einsatzgruppen death squads. The anti-Polish campaign culminated in the near- complete destruction of Warsaw, ordered by Hitler and Himmler in 1944. The original assumptions of Generalplan Ost were based on plans to exterminate around 85% (over 20 million) of ethnically Polish citizens of Poland, with the remaining 15% to be used as slaves. =Ukrainians= Between 1941 and 1945, approximately three million Ukrainian and other gentiles were killed as part of Nazi extermination policies in present-day Ukraine. More Ukrainians were killed fighting the Wehrmacht in the Red Army than American, British and French soldiers combined. Original Nazi plans called for the extermination of 65 percent of the nation's 23.2 million Ukrainians,Hans-Walter Schmuhl.

During Operation Barbarossa (the Axis invasion of the Soviet Union), millions of Red Army prisoners of war were summarily executed in the field by German armies (the Waffen SS in particular), died under inhumane conditions in German prisoner of war camps, on death marches, or had been shipped to concentration camps for execution. The Germans killed an estimated 2.8 million Soviet POWs by starvation, exposure, and execution over an eight-month period in 1941‚Äì42.Case Study: Soviet Prisoners-of-War, Gendercide Watch. According to the U.S. Holocaust Memorial Museum, by the winter of 1941 \\"starvation and disease resulted in mass death of unimaginable proportions\\". 140,000-500,000 Soviet citizens and POWs were killed in the concentration camps. Soviet civilian populations in the occupied areas were severely persecuted and endured the treacherous conditions of the Eastern Front, which spawned atrocities such as the siege of Leningrad, when 1.2 million civilians died. Thousands of peasant villages across Russia, Belarus and Ukraine were annihilated by German troops. During the occupation, the Leningrad, Pskov and Novgorod regions lost about a quarter of their populations. An estimated one-quarter of Soviet civilian deaths at the hands of the Nazis and their allies (five million Russians, three million Ukrainians and 1.5 million Belarusians) were racially motivated.Donald L Niewyk, The Columbia Guide to the Holocaust, Columbia University Press, 200, p 49 In 1995, the Russian Academy of Sciences reported that civilian deaths in the occupied USSR, including Jews, at the hands of the Germans totaled 13.7 million dead (20 percent of the population of 68 million). The figure includes 7.4 million victims of Nazi genocide and reprisals, 2.2 million deaths of persons deported to Germany as forced labour, and 4.1 million famine and disease deaths. An estimated three million people also died of starvation in unoccupied territory. The losses occurred within the 1946‚Äì1991 borders of the USSR, and include territories annexed in 1939‚Äì40.The Russian Academy of Science Rossiiskaia Akademiia nauk.

Romani German police round up Romani in Asperg, Germany in May 1940 The Nazi genocide of the Romani people was ignored by scholars until the 1980s, and opinions continue to differ on its details. According to historians Donald Niewyk and Francis Nicosia, the genocide of the Romani began later than that of the Jews and a smaller percentage was killed.The Columbia guide to the Holocaust By Donald L. Niewyk, Francis R. Nicosia, pp. 50‚Äì52, Columbia University Press, 2000 Hitler's genocidal campaign against Europe's Romani population involved the application of Nazi \\"racial hygiene\\" (selective breeding applied to humans). Despite discriminatory measures, some Romani (including some of Germany's Sinti and Lalleri) were spared deportation and death, with the remaining Romani groups suffering a fate similar to that of the Jews. Romani were deported to the Jewish ghettos, were shot by SS Einsatzgruppen in their villages, or deported and gassed in Auschwitz-Birkenau and Treblinka. Romani woman with German police officer and Nazi psychologist Dr. Robert Ritter Estimates of the Romani death toll in World War II range from 220,000 to 1,500,000. The Romani genocide was formally recognized by West Germany in 1982 and by Poland in 2011.Recognition for Justice International Roma Youth Network Spanish Republicans Thousands of Spanish Republican refugees were living in France at the time of its occupation by Nazi Germany in 1940; 15,000 were detained in concentration camps, including 7,000 in Mauthausen-Gusen. Around 3,500 died in the camp. Additional Non-Europeans Nazi propaganda about the differences between German Aryans and blacks. The Nazis promoted xenophobia and racism against all \\"non-Aryan\\" races. African (black sub-Saharan or North African) and Asian residents of Germany and black prisoners of war, such as French colonial troops and African Americans, were also victims of Nazi racial policy. When the Nazis came to power, hundreds of African-German children, the offspring of German mothers and African soldiers brought in during the French occupation, lived in the Rhineland. In Mein Kampf, Hitler described the children of marriages to African occupation troops as a contamination of the white race \\"by Negro blood on the Rhine in the heart of Europe\\"Robert B. Downs, Books That Changed the World (Signet Classic, 2004), p. 325. who were \\"bastardising the European continent at its core\\". According to Hitler, \\"Jews were responsible for bringing Negroes into the Rhineland, with the ultimate idea of bastardising the white race which they hate and thus lowering its cultural and political level so that the Jew might dominate\\".Adolf Hitler, Mein Kampf (translated by James Murphy, February, 1939) Vol. I, Chapter XI (A Project Gutenberg of Australia eBook) Japan signed the Tripartite Pact with Germany and Italy on 27 September 1940, and was part of the Axis. No Japanese people were known to be deliberately imprisoned or killed, since they were considered \\"honorary Aryans\\". In his political testament Hitler wrote: White South Africans, white people and Europeans of gentile ancestry from other continents were exempt, as were Latin Americans of \\"evident\\" Germanic or White \\"Aryan\\" (non-mestizo) ancestry. People with disabilities According to their eugenics policy, the Nazis believed that the disabled were a burden to society because they needed care and were considered an affront to their notion of a society composed of a perfect race. About 375,000 people were sterilized against their will due to their disabilities. Those with disabilities were among the first to be killed by the Nazis; according to the U.S. Holocaust Memorial Museum, the T-4 Program (established in 1939) was the model for future Nazi exterminations and it set a precedent for the genocide of what they described as the Jewish race. The program attempted to maintain the \\"purity\\" of the Aryan race by systematically killing children and adults with physical deformities or suffering from mental illness, using gas chambers for the first time. Although Hitler formally halted the program in late August 1941, the killings secretly continued until the end of the war and an estimated 275,000 people with congenital disabilities died.  Gay men and lesbians  Non-heterosexual people were also targets of the Holocaust, since male homosexuality was deemed incompatible with Nazism. The Nazis believed that gay men were weak, effeminate and unable to fight for the German nation; homosexuals were unlikely to produce children and increase the German birthrate. According to the Nazis, \\"inferior races\\" produced more children than Aryans, so anything which diminished Germany's reproductive potential was considered a racial danger. Homosexuality was also thought to be contagious by the Nazis. By 1936, Heinrich Himmler was leading efforts to persecute gay men under existing and new anti-homosexual laws. More than one million gay Germans were targeted, of whom at least 100,000 were arrested and 50,000 were convicted and imprisoned. An unknown number were institutionalized in state- run mental hospitals. Hundreds of European gay men living under Nazi occupation were chemically castrated by court order. Although an estimated 5,000 to 15,000 gay men were imprisoned in concentration camps, the number who died is uncertain. According to Austrian survivor Heinz Heger, gay men \\"suffered a higher mortality rate than other relatively small victim groups, such as Jehovah's Witnesses and political prisoners\\".Heinz Heger, Men with the Pink Triangle, Alyson Publishing: 1994 Gay men in Nazi concentration camps were identified by a pink triangle on their shirts, along with men convicted of sexually assaulting children and bestiality.Plant, The Pink Triangle. Lesbians were not usually treated as harshly as gay men; although they were labelled \\"asocial\\", they were rarely imprisoned on sexual-orientation charges. In the concentration camps, they usually wore a black triangle. According to the U.S. Holocaust Memorial Museum's website, \\"Nazi Germany did not seek to kill all homosexuals. Nevertheless, the Nazi state, through active persecution, attempted to terrorise German homosexuals into sexual and social conformity, leaving thousands dead and shattering the lives of many more.\\" Many homosexuals who were liberated from the concentration camps were persecuted in postwar Germany. Survivors were subject to prosecution under Paragraph 175 (which forbade \\"lewdness between men\\"), with time served in the concentration camps deducted from their sentences. This contrasted with the treatment of other Holocaust victims, who were compensated for the loss of family members and educational opportunities. Political victims  Political prisoners  Another large group of victims was composed of German and foreign civilian activists from across the political spectrum who opposed the Nazi regime, captured resistance fighters (many of whom were executed during‚Äîor immediately after‚Äîtheir interrogation, particularly in occupied Poland and France) and, sometimes, their families. German political prisoners were a substantial proportion of the first inmates at Dachau (the prototypical Nazi concentration camp). The political People's Court was notorious for the number of its death sentences.  Leftists  Nazi SA guard shut-down trade union headquarters in Berlin, 2 May 1933 German Communists were among the first to be imprisoned in concentration camps. Their ties to the USSR concerned Hitler, and the Nazi Party was intractably opposed to communism. Rumors of communist violence were spread by the Nazis to justify the Enabling Act of 1933, which gave Hitler his first dictatorial powers. Hermann G√∂ring testified at Nuremberg that Nazi willingness to repress German Communists prompted Hindenburg and the old elite to cooperate with them. Hitler and the Nazis also despised German leftists because of their resistance to Nazi racism. Many German leftist leaders were Jews who had been prominent in the 1919 Spartacist uprising. Hitler referred to Marxism and \\"Bolshevism\\" as means for \\"the international Jew\\" to undermine \\"racial purity\\", stir up class tension and mobilize trade unions against the government and business. When the Nazis occupied a territory, communists, socialists and anarchists were usually among the first to be repressed; this included summary executions. An example is Hitler's Commissar Order, in which he demanded the summary execution of all Soviet troops who were political commissars who offered resistance or were captured in battle. Enemy nationals Thousands of people, primarily diplomats, of nationalities associated with the Allies (China and Mexico, for example) and Spanish Civil War refugees in occupied France were interned or executed. After Italy's 1943 surrender, many Italian nationals (including partisans and Italian soldiers disarmed by the Germans) were sent to concentration camps. Other religious persecution The Nazis also targeted religious groups for political and ideological reasons. Thousands of Catholic clergy and nuns were killed, including some with a Jewish background (Edith Stein, for example). The Nazis considered Jews a racial group; secular people and those of other religions who had Jewish ancestry were, therefore, Jews (a belief shared by some Jews). Jehovah's Witnesses Historian Detlef Garbe, director of the Neuengamme Memorial in Hamburg, wrote about Jehovah's Witnesses: \\"No other religious movement resisted the pressure to conform to National Socialism [Nazism] with comparable unanimity and steadfastness\\".Garbe, Detlef (2001).

Bremen: Edition Temmen. p.251 Between 2,500 and 5,000 Witnesses died in the concentration camps; unwilling to fight for any cause, they refused to serve in the army. Roman Catholics The Catholic Church was persecuted under the Third Reich,Theodore S. Hamerow; On the Road to the Wolf's Lair: German Resistance to Hitler; Belknap Press of Harvard University Press; 1997; ; p. 136 with the Nazi leadership hoping to gradually de- Christianize Germany. Millions of Catholics, primarily clergy and activists, were imprisoned and killed.Gajewski, Karol Jozef (ndg) \\"Nazi Persecution of the Church\\" CatholicCulture.org According to the World Holocaust Remembrance Center, \\"By the latter part of the decade of the Thirties, church officials were well aware that the ultimate aim of Hitler and other Nazis was the total elimination of Catholicism and of the Christian religion.\\" Hitler vehemently despised Christianity, calling it the enemy of National Socialism. According to historian William Shirer, \\"under the leadership of Rosenberg, Bormann and Himmler‚Äîbacked by Hitler‚Äîthe Nazi regime intended to destroy Christianity in Germany, if it could, and substitute the old paganism of the early tribal Germanic gods and the new paganism of the Nazi extremists\\". He also wrote that Hitler \\"inveighed against political Catholicism in Mein Kampf and attacked both of the Christian Churches for their failure to recognise the racial problem...\\". As reported in the New York Times, Hitler's forces wished to de- Christianize Germany after \\"the final victory\\" and destroy Christianity. According to historian Alan Bullock, \\"Once the war was over, [Hitler] promised himself, he would root out and destroy the influence of the Christian Churches, but until then he would be circumspect.\\" * Gill, Anton (1994).

Hitler's invasion of Catholic Poland in 1939 began World War II, and the Nazis targeted clergy, monks and nuns in their campaign to destroy Polish culture.

The church was especially harshly treated in annexed regions, such as Austria. Viennese Gauleiter Odilo Globocnik confiscated property, closed Catholic organizations and sent many priests to Dachau. In the Czech lands, religious orders were suppressed, schools closed, religious instruction forbidden and priests sent to concentration camps.Mark Mazower; Hitler's Empire: Nazi Rule in Occupied Europe; Penguin; 2008; ; pp. 51‚Äì52 Catholic bishops, clergy, nuns and laypeople protested and attacked Nazi policies in occupied territories; in 1942, the Dutch bishops protested the mistreatment of Jews. When Archbishop Johannes de Jong refused to yield to Nazi threats, the Gestapo rounded up Catholic \\"Jews\\" and sent 92 to Auschwitz.Richard J. Evans; The Third Reich at War; Penguin Press; New York 2009, p.385 One Dutch Catholic abducted in this manner was nun Edith Stein, who died at Auschwitz along with Poland's Maximilian Kolbe. Other Catholic victims of the Holocaust have been beatified, including Poland's 108 Martyrs of World War II, the Martyrs of Nowogr√≥dek, Dutch theologian Titus Brandsma and Germany's L√ºbeck martyrs and Bernhard Lichtenberg. = Poland = Polish Franciscan Maximillian Kolbe died at Auschwitz. According to Norman Davies, the Nazi terror was \\"much fiercer and more protracted in Poland than anywhere in Europe.\\"Graml, Mommsen, Reichhardt & Wolf; The German Resistance to Hitler; B. T. Batsford Ltd; London; 1970; p. 225 Polish Catholic victims of the Third Reich numbered in the millions. Nazi ideology viewed ethnic Poles‚Äîthe mainly Catholic ethnic majority of Poland‚Äîas subhuman. After their 1939 invasion of Poland, the Nazis instituted a policy of murdering (or suppressing) the ethnic-Polish elite (including Catholic religious leaders). The Nazi plan for Poland was the nation's destruction, which necessitated attacking the Polish Church, (particularly in areas annexed by Germany). About the brief period of military control from 1 September to 25 October 1939, Davies wrote: \\"According to one source, 714 mass executions were carried out, and 6,376 people, mainly Catholics, were shot. Others put the death toll in one town alone at 20,000. It was a taste of things to come.\\"Norman Davies; Rising '44: the Battle for Warsaw; Viking; 2003; pp. 85‚Äì6 In Polish areas annexed by Nazi Germany, severe persecution began. The Nazis systematically dismantled the church, arresting its leaders, exiling its clergy and closing its churches, monasteries and convents. Germanization of the annexed regions began in December 1939, with deportations of men, women and children.Richard J. Evans; The Third Reich at War; Penguin Press New York; 2009; pp. 28‚Äì29 According to Richard J. Evans, in the Reichsgau Wartheland \\"numerous clergy, monks, diocesan administrators and officials of the Church were arrested, deported to the General Government, taken off to a concentration camp in the Reich, or simply shot. Altogether some 1700 Polish priests ended up at Dachau: half of them did not survive their imprisonment.\\"Richard J. Evans; The Third Reich at War; Penguin Press New York; 2009; p. 33‚Äì34 Among the clergy who died at Dachau were many of the 108 Polish Martyrs of World War II. Hans Frank said in 1940, \\"Poles may have only one master‚Äîa German. Two masters cannot exist side by side, and this is why all members of the Polish intelligentsia must be killed.\\" Thomas J. Craughwell wrote that from 1939 to 1945, an estimated 3,000 members of the Polish clergy (18 percent) were murdered; of these, 1,992 died in concentration camps.Craughwell, Thomas J., The Gentile Holocaust Catholic Culture, Accessed July 18, 2008 According to the Encyclop√¶dia Britannica, 1,811 Polish priests died in Nazi concentration camps.Encyclop√¶dia Britannica Online - Stefan Wyszy≈Ñski; Encyclop√¶dia Britannica Inc; 2013. Web. 14 Apr. 2013. Among the persecuted resisters was Irena Sendlerowa, head of the children's section of ≈ªegota, who placed more than 2,500 Jewish children in convents, orphanages, schools, hospitals, and homes. Captured by the Gestapo in 1943, Sendlerowa was crippled by torture.Martin Gilbert; The Righteous - The Unsung Heroes of the Holocaust; Doubleday; 2002; ; p.122 Protestants The Nazis attempted to deal with Protestant dissent with their ideology by creating the Reich Church, a union of 28 existing Protestant groups espousing Positive Christianity (a doctrine compatible with Nazism). Non-Aryan ministers were suspended and church members called themselves German Christians, with \\"the swastika on their chest and the cross in their heart.\\" The Protestant opposition to the Nazis established the Confessing Church, a rival umbrella organization of independent German regional churches which was persecuted. See drop-down essay on \\"Unification, World Wars, and Nazism\\" Bah√° º√≠ Faith The Bah√° º√≠ Faith was formally banned in the Third Reich. Heinrich Himmler signed a 1937 order disbanding Bah√° º√≠ institutions in Germany because of their \\"international and pacifist tendencies\\". In 1939 and 1942, there were sweeping arrests of former members of the German Spiritual Assembly. May 1944 saw a public trial in Darmstadt; although Hermann Grossmann defended the faith, the Bah√° º√≠s were steeply fined and their institutions continued to be disbanded.  Freemasons  The Nazis claimed that high-degree Masons were willing members of \\"the Jewish conspiracy\\" and Freemasonry was a cause of Germany's defeat in World War I. Reich Main Security Office (Reichssicherheitshauptamt, or RSHA) records indicate the persecution of Freemasons during the Holocaust. RSHA Amt VII (written records), overseen by Franz Six, was responsible for \\"ideological\\" tasks: the creation of antisemitic and anti-Masonic propaganda. Although the exact number is unknown, an estimated 80,000 to 200,000 Freemasons were killed as a result of Hitler's December 1941 Nacht und Nebel directive. Masonic concentration camp inmates, considered political prisoners, wore an inverted red triangle. Small blue forget-me-nots were first used by the Zur Sonne Grand Lodge in 1926 as a Masonic emblem at its annual convention in Bremen. In 1938, a forget-me-not badge made by the factory which produced the Masonic badge was chosen for the annual Nazi Winterhilfswerk, the charity drive of the National Socialist People's Welfare (the party's welfare branch). The coincidence enabled Freemasons to wear the forget-me-not badge as a secret sign of Masonic membership.Also in: After the war, the forget-me-not was again used as a Masonic emblem at the first annual United Grand Lodges of Germany convention in 1948. The badge is worn on the lapels of Masons worldwide in remembrance of those who have suffered in the name of Freemasonry, particularly during the Nazi era.  Esperantists  Speakers of Esperanto, an international auxiliary language, were viewed with suspicion by the Nazis. Hitler considered it a language of the \\"Jewish conspiracy\\" because its creator, L. L. Zamenhof, was Jewish. Because of this, people who spoke Esperanto were sent to concentration camps.  Others  The SS and police conducted mass actions against civilians with alleged links to resistance movements, their families, and villages or city districts. Notorious killings occurred in Lidice, Khatyn, Kragujevac, Sant'Anna and Oradour-sur-Glane, and a district of Warsaw was obliterated. In occupied Poland, Nazi Germany imposed the death penalty on those found sheltering (or aiding) Jews. \\"Social deviants\\"‚Äîprostitutes, vagrants, alcoholics, drug addicts, open dissidents, pacifists, draft resisters and common criminals‚Äîwere also imprisoned in concentration camps. The common criminals frequently became Kapos, inmate guards of fellow prisoners. Some Germans and Austrians who lived abroad for much of their lives were considered to have too much exposure to foreign ideas, and they were sent to concentration camps. These prisoners, known as \\"emigrants\\", each wore a blue triangle. On rare occasions, POWs from Western Allied armies were sent to concentration camps, including 350 Americans ‚Äì some chosen for being Jewish, but mostly for looking Jewish or for being troublemakers or otherwise 'undesirable'. Some captured in the Battle of the Bulge were forced into slave labor at the Berga concentration camp, a subcamp of Buchenwald; over 70 died. The \\"KLB Club\\" was a group of 168 Allied airmen ‚Äì mainly American, British, and Canadian ‚Äì considered Terrorfliegers (\\"terror fliers\\"), denied POW status, and held at Buchenwald for two months until a German officer arranged their transfer to a standard POW camp, a week before their scheduled execution.

Nyren added a physical description: \\"a thick-set man, about 5'9\\" in height, rather a slow mover in the field (and had) a tendency towards injury and illness\\".John Nyren, The Cricketers of my Time (ed. Ashley Mote), Robson, 1998 Little is known about him personally except that he was for a time employed by the Duke of Dorset as a gardener at Knole House, near Sevenoaks. He played for Dorset's Kent county cricket teams during this period but it seems he then moved to Middlesex and then Surrey as he played for the Surrey eleven from 1775 till he was last recorded in 1780.Arthur Haygarth, Scores & Biographies, Volume 1 (1744-1826), Lillywhite, 1862 Minshull's century was scored on Thursday 31 August 1769 when he played for the Duke of Dorset's XI against Wrotham. It was a minor match but Minshull's score of 107 is the earliest definitely known century in any class of cricket.David Underdown, Start of Play, Allen Lane, 2000 To reach his century Minshull scored 34 singles, 15 twos, 9 threes and 4 all run fours.Liverman D, Griffiths P (2004) From Minshull to Collins, CricInfo, 2004-05-12.

He was also the first batsman to be recorded dismissed 'hit wicket', while playing for All England against Hampshire at The Vine in 1773. Strangely he was probably not actually on strike at the time.

The frizzen is held in one of two positions, opened or closed, by a leaf spring. When closed, it is positioned over the flash pan so as to enclose a small priming charge of black powder next to the flash hole that is drilled through the barrel into which the main charge has been loaded. When the trigger is pulled, the hammer or cock which includes a shaped piece of flint held in a set of jaws with a scrap of leather or thin piece of lead, snaps forward causing the flint to scrape downward along the frizzen's face (historically called the 'battery'), throwing it forward into the open position and exposing the priming powder. The flint scraping along the steel causes a shower of sparks to be thrown into the pan, thereby igniting the priming powder therein and sending flames through the touch hole, which in turn ignites the main charge of black powder in the breech of the barrel, driving the projectile out of the muzzle. The development of the frizzen which combines both the \\"battery\\" or striking surface and separate pan cover on the less advanced \\"snaphaunce\\" lock is often credited to French gun maker Marin le Bourgeoys around 1610. He may have been influenced by the Spanish \\"miquelet\\" lock that utilized a similarly shaped frizzen at least two decades earlier. It is important that the metal of the frizzen be brought to a sufficiently high carbon content by the process of carburization, wherein carbonaceous materials such as horn, hooves, and leather scraps were wrapped around the frizzen in a clay or metallic crucible which was then placed into a forge or other furnace for several hours to raise the carbon content of the steel through the process of diffusion. This process increases the carbon content of the iron in a layer close to the surface of the frizzen such that it hardens the outside while the center remains relatively ductile so as to prevent through-cracking. Through the wear of continued use a frizzen will lose its ability to create enough sparks to reliably ignite the powder, thereby necessitating that it be re- hardened or replaced.

It is situated in the Cabrillo National Monument. It is no longer in operation as a lighthouse but is open to the public as a museum. It is sometimes erroneously called the \\"Old Spanish Lighthouse\\",San Diego Historical Society but in fact it was not built during San Diego's Spanish or Mexican eras; it was built in 1855 by the United States government after California's admission as a state. History On September 28, 1850, just 19 days after admitting California to the Union, Congress appropriated $90,000 to construct lighthouses along the California coast. A second appropriation of $59,434 was made in 1854 to complete the job. Lighthouses were designated for Alcatraz Island, Point Conception, Battery Point, Farallon Island, Point Pinos and Point Loma. A site was chosen in 1851 near the summit of Point Loma. The contract was given to the Washington, D.C. company Gibbon and Kelley. The local supervisor was William J. Timanus. Construction was begun in April 1854, when a shipment of materials arrived from San Francisco. The lantern and lens had to be ordered from Paris and arrived in August 1855. The lighthouse was completed by October 1855 and was lighted for the first time at sunset November 15, 1855. It was designated light number 355, of the Twelfth United States Lighthouse District. When the lighthouse was constructed, an additional small structure was built next to it. This building was originally used as a storehouse for oil, wood, and other supplies. However, in 1875 part of it was converted into a two-room apartment for the assistant lighthouse keeper. It was built with rough lumber and the inside was lined with cloth and paper, since cracks would frequently develop in the walls. This thin lining was later replaced with tongue and groove boards. More repairs must have been made in 1880 for the structure was still being used as a living space for the assistant.http://www.nps.gov/history/history/online_books/cabr/lighthouse/sec3.htm Today this building has been changed once again, and now serves as a museum. It holds the original lens of the New Point Loma lighthouse as well as maps and more information about Point Loma and its history.http://www.lighthousefriends.com/light.asp?ID=29 While in operation the lighthouse had the highest elevation of any lighthouse in the United States. However, the location on top of a 400-foot cliff meant that fog and low clouds often obscured the light from the view of ships. On foggy nights the lighthouse keeper would sometimes discharge a shotgun to warn ships away. On March 23, 1891, the flame was permanently extinguished and the light was replaced by the New Point Loma lighthouse at a lower elevation. After its abandonment the lighthouse deteriorated. In 1913 President Woodrow Wilson dedicated the lighthouse and a half-acre of land as Cabrillo National Monument, for the purpose of erecting a large statue of Juan Rodriguez Cabrillo. Pages 130-132. However, no such statue was actually built for several decades. In 1935 the lighthouse underwent a major renovation and a new road to the monument was constructed. In 1949 a statue of Cabrillo, donated by the government of Portugal, was installed on land near the lighthouse. In 1984, the light was re-lit by the National Park Service for the first time in 93 years, in celebration of the site's 130th birthday. More than 3,000 people attended the celebration, including more than 100 descendants of former lighthouse keepers Robert and Maria Israel. Keepers The names of the lighthouse keepers were: * James P. Keating (1854‚Äì1859) * H. C. Wiley (1859) * J. N. Covarrubias (1859‚Äì1860) * Joseph Renier (1860) * James P. Keating (1860‚Äì1861) * W. C. Price (1861‚Äì1867) * J. D. Jenkins (1867‚Äì1871) * Enos A. Wall (1871‚Äì1872) * James J. Ferra (1872‚Äì1873) * Robert D. Israel (1873‚Äì1891). Robert Israel Undated USCG photo San Diego pioneer Robert Decatur Israel was lighthouse keeper for the longest period of time, 18 years. He was born in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania on March 23, 1826. His father was described as Pennsylvania Dutch and mother as Scotch-Irish. He wasn't Jewish, but because of his surname many people today mistakenly assume that he was. He had fought in the Mexican‚ÄìAmerican War, including the famous Battle of Chapultepec. He moved to San Diego in 1848 and worked as a blacksmith and saloon-keeper. He and Maria Arcadia Alipas Machado, the daughter of a long-established San Diego family, were married by a priest in 1852 at the Casa de Estudillo in Old Town. They had four children: Henry Clay Israel, Joseph Perry Israel; Robert Lincoln Israel, and a second Joseph Perry Israel, born after his older brother had died. Israel was appointed assistant lighthouse keeper in 1871 and promoted to lighthouse keeper in 1874. His wife Maria was the assistant keeper, like most wives of lighthouse keepers. Their family lived alone on the Point, making sure that the lighthouse was illuminated each night. The Israels lived and worked on Point Loma for 18 years, where they watched their children and grandchildren grow up. One of their grandsons was born at the lighthouse. Because of the fog, another lighthouse was built closer to the Pacific Ocean shore line, in the area adjoining Cabrillo National Monument now occupied by a U.S. Coast Guard Station. On March 23, 1891 the old light was extinguished and the new one lit. Israel took over the new location but was dismissed as the lighthouse keeper in 1892. He died at age 81 on January 12, 1908. He is buried at the Fort Rosecrans National Cemetery. His grave 74 in section 75 is marked by a stone with a Christian cross. Some of his descendants now serve as volunteer re-enactors at the lighthouse. Life at the lighthouse A model of the Old Lighthouse shows the barn (left), that was built in 1875 and removed later The Old Point Loma Lighthouse was not just the housing for a light; it was also the home of the people who took care of the light. The keepers and their families lived in the lighthouse. Visitors can now view some of the rooms to see what their life was like. The lighthouse was a bustling family home. The Israel family, including their three surviving boys and a niece, all grew up there. They gardened, kept horses, and raised chickens, pigs and goats. The children rowed across the bay to Old Town each day for school. People from town would sometimes drive by horse and buggy over a dirt road (now Catalina Boulevard) to picnic and visit the lighthouse and its keepers. After deactivation After the lighthouse was deactivated it fell into disrepair. In 1913, it was proposed to tear down the dilapidated lighthouse and replace it with a monumental statue of Juan Rodr√≠guez Cabrillo. The statue was never made, but to accommodate it, one-half acre around the lighthouse was set aside as Cabrillo National Monument by Presidential Proclamation. The monument was turned over to the National Park Service in 1933. By 1935 the metal lantern room had been rebuilt and the lighthouse restored to its original condition. A concessionaire lived in the lighthouse, offering tours of the building and operating a tea room in the southern room on the main floor. With the outbreak of war in 1941, the lighthouse was painted camouflage green and was used as a signal tower to direct ships into San Diego Harbor. After the war the lighthouse was returned to the National Park Service. During the 1980s it was restored and filled with period furnishings to resemble its appearance when the Israel family lived there. In 2003‚Äì2004 the surrounding area was also restored to a more authentic look, including native plants, a vegetable garden, and a water catchment system. The lantern room currently houses the third-order lens from the Mile Rocks Lighthouse. The lighthouse today The lighthouse in August, 1962 Today the lighthouse is no longer in service but stands as a landmark and museum. Visitors may enter the lighthouse and view parts of the living quarters there. Visitors are sometimes greeted by volunteer historical re-enactors including \\"Captain Israel\\", a real historical figure who was lighthouse keeper from 1871 to 1892,San Diego Historical Society or \\"members of the crew\\" of Cabrillo's ship. Although the tower of the lighthouse is normally closed off to the public, there are two days a year when it is open. These dates are August 25, which is the National Park Service's Birthday, and November 15, which is the Lighthouse's Anniversary.http://www.nps.gov/cabr/faqs.htm  Historical Information from USCG web site  * One of the first eight lighthouses on Pacific Coast * Architect: Ammi B.

The station has had a Classic Rock and Roll format since December 1, 1987. This makes it one of the oldest Classic Rock stations in the country as far as years with the same format. The Rock 101 Moniker was first used on the station from 1978-1982 and returned in 1987. The Entercom Communications outlet is licensed by the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) to broadcast at 101.1 MHz with an ERP of 100 kW. The station goes by the name Classic Rock 101.1 and its current slogan is \\"The Upstate's Only Classic Rock Station.\\" Former slogans include \\"Rock 101.1- The Home of Classic Rock and Roll\\" and \\"The Upstate's Classic Rock and Roll Station\\". Its studios are in Greenville, and its tower is shared with WMYA-TV, located west of Fountain Inn, South Carolina. Station history 101.1 signed on as WCAC-FM in 1947 as the sister station to WAIM/1230. It was owned by Wilton E. Hall, the publisher of the Anderson Independent and Daily Mail and one-time US Senator from South Carolina. The station is noted for being one of the earliest FM stations in the state. WCAC-FM had a \\"beautiful Music\\"/ Standards format for many years. In 1978, after the death of owner/founder Wilton E. Hall, WCAC-FM, WAIM 1230 and WAIM-TV 40 were all sold to Franklin Outlaw (the founder of the BI-LO chain of grocery stores). Frank changed the format to freeform progressive rock. The moniker became \\"The New Rock 101 , WCAC-FM\\" in early 1978. The logo was a large flaming fireball with the name Rock 101, WCAC-FM in large red letters. Rock 101 did a lot of many local live remotes. Many were held at ABC Jeans in the Belvedere Shopping Plaza in Anderson. It became WAIM-FM in September 1980, but kept the name as Rock 101. For many years the Rock 101 studios were located on the campus of Anderson College in Anderson, South Carolina. In 1986, the studios were moved about a mile down the road to a location that is going towards the Anderson Jockey Lot. The studios were moved from Anderson to Greenville in 1992. The Rock 101 name and format has been so long-lasting on the station that it has survived during four different sets of call letters beginning with the start of Rock 101 in 1978, those call letters being: WCAC-FM, WAIM-FM, WCKN and now WROQ since 1991. One of the early Rock 101 D.J.s in 1978 was Billy Love (the morning man on WRTH 103.3). Some of the Rock 101 D.J.s over the years have also included: Michael Scott \\"Super Shan\\" Shannon, Gary Jackson, Lee Rogers, Michael \\"The Doctor Mike\\" Allen, Kenny Thomas, Craig Allen, Mike Benson, Perry \\"Scooter\\" Leslie, Max Mace, Scott Summers, Billy \\"The Big Nightstalker\\" Walker, Diana Daniels, Robert (The Mad Dog) Mackney, Marc Bailey, James \\"Jim Spanky\\" Miller, K.C. and T.J. Carson, Tony Magoo, Brian Blades, The Intern, Robert Wagner, J.J. Michaels, Steve Chris, Jim Wilson, Danny Stevens, Nathan Norris, with Lisa Rollins, Danger Dan Elm, JD \\"Stoneman\\" Stone. Anne Robards, Ditti, Mark Hendrix, Chris Lee and Bill Cain among so many other Rock 101 D.J.'s. In the Fall of 1982, WAIM-FM changed formats into a hybrid of CHR and AOR under the \\"Rock 40\\" format as WCKN a.k.a. \\"The All New Rock 101 FM\\". From the word go the station set off to do battle with then dominant Top 40 outlet WANS-FM (now WJMZ-FM). In 1984, the station licensed the \\"Hot Hits\\" format from consultant Mike Joseph and tightened up the music, playing only 20 current songs and no re-currents or oldies. This approach did not work and was dropped. In 1986, the playlist was broadened and adopted the moniker as \\"The New Power 101 FM, WCKN\\". Despite these attempts, ratings remained in second place to WANS-FM's dominance in the CHR market. In late November 1987, the station started running promos about \\"giving the audience what they wanted\\". Then on December 1, 1987 the Rock 40 format and the Power 101 FM name was officially dropped for a fully fledged AOR format (with a strong musical lean toward Classic Rock) and Rock 101 was reborn. During this time two very popular shows on Rock 101 were, \\"The Rock 101's Midnight Tracker\\" where a random full Rock and Roll album would be played at midnight all the way through the morning, with no commercial interruption whatsoever. On Friday nights at midnight, the same concept but with six albums played all the way back to back. The D.J.s would state all of the tracks on each album and then play the album all the way through. The Friday night show was called \\"The Rock 101's Friday Night Six Pack\\". Both of these shows were very popular with listeners and continued on Rock 101 until the mid-1990s. The WCKN call letters were finally dropped for WROQ in February 1991 as the station has shifted toward Active Rock but keeping the Rock 101 moniker. This approach was successful as the station became a solid Top 5 performer in the ratings for much of the 1990s and early 2000s, eventually going to #1 on several occasions during that time. The station was eventually acquired by Barnstable Broadcasting in 2002. Since Barnstable at the time had also owned WROQ's main competitor WTPT it was decided to shift the station towards into a fully fledged classic rock station. This move was meant to allow both stations some breathing room and ratings have strengthened since that time. Clear Channel Communications signed on WBZT-FM in April 2002 as \\"96.7 The Buzzard\\", playing a mix of rock music from the 1960s through the present day. The move was meant to play spoiler to WROQ however the idea did not succeed very well, and the rock format was dropped at WBZT in 2007. This current version of Rock 101 started on December 1, 1987. The Rock 101 moniker dates back to 1978 where the station was known as The New Rock 101, WCAC-FM until the early 1980s when they went to Rock 40. But then all of a sudden the iconic Rock 101 moniker was returned on December 1, 1987 and the station has had the same format since. The station is owned by Entercom Communications, which acquired WROQ, along with WTPT-FM and WGVC-FM now WYRD-FM from Barnstable in 2005. In February 2014 WROQ has been updated the moniker as \\"The New Classic Rock 101.1, WROQ\\".

It initially consisted of four generating sets generating 275 MW each and was to cost A$198 million. The Federal Government recognised the national importance of the power station, agreeing to contribute up to $80 million. A September 1975 report recommended the addition of two more generating units at Gladstone. This was approved by the Queensland Government in 1976.

The club plays in S√©rie D, the fourth tier of Brazilian football, as well as in the Campeonato Amazonense, the top level of the Amazonas state football league. History The club was founded by a group of members and players of the Nacional, who commanded by the leader Vivaldo Lima and the player then captain of the team Rodolpho Gon√ßalves decided to leave the club. The reason for the discord was a political maneuver of the then president of the Nacional, Leopoldo Mattos with change of the statute of the Nacional on the eve of the presidential election, taking the players the right to vote. The athletes wanted Vivaldo Lima for the presidency, and were closed around the name of the doctor and leader. With the maneuver, the players, voided in their statutory rights, did not accept the imposition and decided to leave, with the idea of a new club, founded Fast and made of Vivaldo Lima the first president. Thus, the new club already had as Nacional name, the initials NFC; The colors red, blue and white by virtue of the flag of the Amazonas, besides the yellow star to the center of the shield. The group then decided to consult the teacher Carlos Mesquita of the traditional Gimnasyo Amazonense Dom Pedro II, to suggest a name beginning with the letter F to differentiate itself from the old club. Thus, the English- speaking teacher christened the club the term \\"Fast\\", making an analogy to the speed and dexterity that the players who founded the new football association had on the pitch. Rivalries Fast Clube rivals are Nacional, Rio Negro and S√£o Raimundo-AM. The biggest rival is Nacional, who make the derby called Pai vs. Filho (Father Vs. Son), due to the fact that the Fast Clube was founded by dissidents of the Nacional, and for that reason, the press at the time and the own fans of National nicknamed the derby thus.

It is formed in Lower Carboniferous (Vis√©an) limestone of the Clogrenan Formation. It is a show cave open to the public, particularly well known for its rich archaeological discoveries and for being the site of a Viking massacre in 928.  Show cave  The \\"Market cross\\", one of the large calcite formations. The caves are located to the east of and close to the N78 Kilkenny‚ÄìCastlecomer road and about north of Kilkenny City. The entrance is in the townland of Mohill, where a tourist centre has been established at the site. Overlooking the River Dinan valley, it is found in an isolated outcrop of limestone on the Castlecomer Plateau. Dunmore is not one of the largest of Ireland's caves. It contains just a quarter of a mile of passages and at its deepest point, it descends to , but it possesses some fine calcite formations. The most spectacular is the Market Cross, a distinctly cross-shaped column over high.  Development  Dunmore Cave was designated a National Monument by the Commissioners of Public Works in 1944, but development as a show cave with visitor centre and tours didn't begin until 1967, at the behest of respected archaeologist and spelaeologist J. C. Coleman. The cave was closed in 2000 for archaeological work and redevelopment, and reopened in 2003.  History  The earliest historical reference to the cave is to be found in the Triads of Ireland, dating from the 14th to the 19th century, where \\", and \\" are listed under the heading, \\"the three darkest places in Ireland\\". The last, meaning the \\"Cave of the Alders,\\" is generally thought to be the present Dunmore Cave, while the first two translate as the caves of Knowth and Slaney. It is not known which exact system of caves/passage tombs near the river Slaney is being referred to, with the most likely, those at Baltinglass. Other sources translate the listed locations as Rath Croghan, the cave or crypt of Slane and the \\"Cave of the Ferns\\". In the Annals of the Four Masters, dated to the 17th century, was recorded as the site of a great Viking massacre in 928 AD: > \\"Godfrey U√≠ √çmair, with the foreigners of Ath Cliath, demolished and > plundered Dearc Fearna, where one thousand persons were killed in this year > as is stated in the quatrain: > > Nine hundred years without sorrow, twenty-eight, it has been proved, 'Since > Christ came to our relief, to the plundering of Dearc-Fearna.\\" Gofraith, ua > h-Iomhair, co n-Gallaibh Atha Cliath, do thoghail & do orgain Derce Fearna, > airm in ro marbhadh m√≠le do dhaoinibh an bhliadhain-si, amhail as-berar > isin rann, Naoi c-c√©d bliadhain gan doghra, > a h-ocht fichet non-dearbha, > o do-luidh Criost d√°r c-cobhair > co toghail Derce Ferna. While the human remains found in the cave are thought to be victims of the Viking massacre, this has not been reliably confirmed. Many of the remains belong to women and children, and it is hypothesised that they are the bodies of people hiding in the cave who were unable to leave when the Vikings tried to smoke them out, dying from asphyxiation.  Archaeological study  The earliest writings on the cave of an archaeological nature came from the bishop George Berkeley, whose report dated 1706 detailed a visit that he made to the cave as a boy. The essay was not published until 1871. In 1869 Arthur Wynne Foot, a physician, made an archaeological visit to the cave with Rev. James Graves and Peter Burtchaell and discovered large quantities of human remains, which they collected. In his reports, Foot meticulously documented his findings, and culled references from the writings of researchers over the preceding 120 years. In 1999, a hoard of 43 silver and bronze items was discovered in a rocky cleft deep in the cave. Archaeologists dated this hoard, consisting of silver, ingots and conical buttons woven from fine silver, to 970 AD.

Eyre Bird Observatory is an educational, scientific and recreational facility in the Nuytsland Nature Reserve, Western Australia. Cocklebiddy is the nearest locality on the Eyre Highway, to the north. Sandwiched between the Nullarbor Plain to the north and the Great Australian Bight to the south, it lies in one of the least populated places on the Australian continent. It was established in 1977 by Birds Australia in the disused Eyre Telegraph Station as Australia's first bird observatory, to provide a base for the study and enjoyment of the birds of the area. Western Australia's official lowest temperature of ‚àí7.2 ¬∞C (19.0 ¬∞F) was recorded at Eyre Bird Observatory on 17 August 2008. History During their nearly 1841 journey overland from Adelaide to Albany, 26-year-old Edward John Eyre and his party - companion John Baxter and three Aboriginal men - found fresh water beneath a coastal sand dune, and camped there for a month, recovering from severe dehydration and exhaustion. This location became known as Eyre's Sand Patch. When the Inter-Colonial Telegraph Line reached the Patch in 1877, a weatherboard and corrugated iron building was erected to house a permanently manned repeater station, and the location was subsequently known as the Eyre Telegraph Station. Twenty years later, in 1897, the station moved into a new limestone and corrugated iron building nearby until, in 1927 when the telegraph line moved north to follow the Trans-Australian Railway, the building was abandoned. Fifty years later, in 1977, the limestone building was restored by volunteers with the support of the Post Office Historical Society and Birds Australia, using materials supplied by the WA Department of Fisheries and Wildlife, and it now functions as a permanent bird observatory.Roger Buddridge, \\"Introduction: A Brief History\\" pp 2 & 3 and Stephen Davies, \\"In Search of a Field Station for Naturalists\\" p. 20 in \\"Eyre's Sand Patch to Eyre Bird Observatory\\" 2008 Editor: Alma de Rebeira. .

The building is maintained by volunteers, including two caretakers who live on site for three months at a time. Bird life Honeyeaters who spend the summer in the deep south-west extend their range north and east in the winter to feast on the flowering mallee and, at Eyre, honeyeaters, silvereyes and other species are found wintering in the narrow coastal mallee strip. A colony of breeding penguins spends the summer west of Eyre at Twilight Cove. By 2008, 245 bird species had been recorded in the surrounding nature reserve.

It employs a geophysical method similar to ground-penetrating radar that operates at frequencies in the MF, HF and VHF portions of the radio spectrum. Radioglaciology is sometimes referred to as \\"ice-penetrating radar\\" or \\"radio- echo sounding\\". Glaciers are well suited to investigation by radar because the imaginary part of the permittivity of ice is small relative to its real part; this ratio is called the loss tangent. The conductivity of ice is small at radio frequencies, so its dielectric absorption is also small. Principle The primary goal of many radioglaciological surveys is to measure the thickness of a body of ice, which is an important boundary condition for ice- flow models. Ice thicknesses greater than 4 km have been measured in East Antarctica. Internal reflections have also been detected in many alpine glaciers and all modern ice sheets. These layers represent the internal stratigraphy and can also be used to constrain ice-flow models. The shapes of these internal reflections generally follow the bedrock topography and they are often assumed to be isochronous. Disturbances in these reflections that are unrelated to bedrock topography can be used to understand past ice flow, for example the anticlines arising from the Raymond Effect. The cause of the observed internal reflections partly depends on the frequency of the radar system used to detect them. There are three primary types of reflections: * In the firn and at depths where densification is occurring, small changes in density alter the real part of the permittivity, which can cause reflections. Once densification is complete, changes in density in an ice column are not expected to be large enough to cause radar reflections. * High concentrations of volcanic acids, e.g., sulfuric acid or hydrochloric acid, increase the conductivity of the surface snow over which they are deposited. Acidity increases the conductivity, which produces a reflection. Reflections due to volcanic layers are possible at any depth. * Individual crystals of ice display dielectric anisotropy. Layers that have a preferred crystal fabric direction different from that above it can therefore also cause reflections. Ice-penetrating radar systems, particularly the antennae, are often homemade systems made of commercially available components. However, commercial ground- penetrating radar systems are sometimes used. Planetary exploration There are currently two ice-penetrating radars orbiting Mars: MARSIS and SHARAD. An ice-penetrating radar system is planned for the 2022 Jupiter Icy Moons Orbiter, and such systems were also proposed for two orbiters that were part of the cancelled Europa Jupiter System Mission.

It is distributed as free and open-source software under an MIT License. Seaside provides a component architecture in which web pages are built as trees of individual, stateful components, each encapsulating a small part of a page. Seaside uses continuations to model multiple independent flows between different components.Seaside ‚Äì a Multiple Control Flow Web Application Framework Thus, it is a continuation-based web frameworkIBM DeveloperWorks: Crossing borders: Continuations, Web development, Java programming based on the ability to manipulate the execution stack of some implementations of Smalltalk. Key features Seaside's implementation of continuations was an initial point of interest in its first several years of existence following its 2002 release. Continuations provide a mechanism for rollback and resumption, a useful provision for the web browser environment in which refresh and back buttons may interrupt the flow of processing. This resolves many common issues with running web applications, like adequately sustaining the state on the server-side even when the web browser‚Äôs ‚Äòback‚Äô and ‚Äòforward‚Äô buttons are used. Continuation servers give the developer the ability to maintain state on the server in a scalable manner.Seaside: A Flexible Environment for Building Dynamic Web Applications The subsequent improvement of web browser implementations of JavaScript since 2002 has made the continuations aspect of Seaside less significant, by allowing client browsers to keep track of state better. A distinctive feature of Seaside is its integrated development environment, providing access to development tools and debugging support within an application. In development-mode, unhandled errors are reported to the web page; developers can access and alter the program code and state directly from the web page, allowing bug identifying and fixing processes to occur within an integrated development environment (IDE).Debugging Seaside Applications A Seaside application is a set of interacting components. Each one stores state across page views and can render itself to the HTML stream. Thus, it is straightforward to write a component once and then reuse it elsewhere in an application. Seaside also supports the notion of tasks, which allow a programmer to describe the high-level logic of component interaction. Seaside is not template-oriented, and does not offer generating or using HTML templates; HTML markup is generated programmatically. (The Seaside-based Pier content-management framework does offer wiki-markup syntax for templating.) Seaside uses callbacks on closures to specify actions to be taken when clicking on a link or submitting a form. The developers and users of Seaside argue that this helps enforce separation of structure (markup) from content and presentation (Cascading Style Sheets (CSS)).Avi Bryant explains why Seaside doesn't use templates Seaside's combination of components, callbacks, and closures can significantly reduce the semantic gap between a complex workflow and its representation in code.Web Application Frameworks: A Comparative Study Seaside supports Ajax through integration with script.aculo.us and jQuery. Seaside also supports Comet-style server-push technology.Screencast: Seaside Comet Chat Application Seaside can work with either Smalltalk-based web server implementations or other non-Smalltalk ones (Nginx, Apache). Philosophy Over the last few years, some best practices have come to be widely accepted in the web development field: * Share as little state as possible. * Use clean, carefully chosen, and meaningful URLs. * Use templates to separate the model from the presentation. Seaside deliberately breaks all of these rules. Avi Bryant describes it as a 'heretical' framework. He argues that this careful and reasoned rejection of the conventional wisdoms of web development has led to a very effective model for developing web applications. Ports The main development of Seaside is implemented in Pharo Smalltalk.\\"Seaside 2.9 is current implemented on Pharo that serves as a reference implementation.\\" Ports for other Smalltalk dialects exist. The original development of Seaside was done on Squeak in the early 2000s. Michel Bany implemented ports to VisualWorks through Seaside version 2.7; Cincom Systems supports Seaside as part of VisualWorks as of early 2008.

It referred to a purported Maori word meaning \\"drum\\", \\"fife\\", or \\"conclusion\\". Origin In 1903, author Rupert Hughes published The Musical Guide, an encyclopedia of classical music. Among the many sections of the \\"Guide\\" was a \\"pronouncing and defining dictionary of terms, instruments, etc\\". The \\"dictionary,\\" 252 pages in all, explained the meaning and gave the pronunciation of German, Italian, and other non-English words found in the terminology of classical music. At the end of the dictionary, immediately following the entry for \\"zymbel\\" (German for cymbal), Hughes added the following definition:Hughes (1903), p. 307. The entry was retained when the book was republished under different titles in 1912 and 1939.Hughes (1912), p. 307Hughes (1939) Analysis and discovery as likely hoax Zzxjoanw attracted interest from logologists who wrote about it with a mixture of intrigue and skepticism. Dmitri Borgmann included the term in his 1965 book, Language on Vacation: An Olio of Orthographical Oddities: In 1974, Mrs. Byrne's Dictionary of Unusual, Obscure, and Preposterous Words, while accepting the word's meaning as a \\"Maori drum\\", rejected Hughes' pronunciation of \\"shaw\\", proposing a somewhat different version: \\"ziks-jo'an\\". Philip M. Cohen first published about zzxjoanw as a potential hoax in a 1976 issue of Word Ways. He highlighted its pronunciation, its unlikely connection to the spelling, its wide variety of meanings, and that one of those meanings, \\"conclusion,\\" also happened to conclude the reference work in which it appeared. He also pointed to its unlikely Maori origin, because \\"Maori has no closed syllables or consonant clusters, let alone the conglomerations of 'zzxjoanw', nor even an 's' or 'sh' sound. The available Maori dictionaries give words for 'drum' and 'end', but they haven't the slightest resemblance to 'zzxjoanw' or 'shaw'\\". Ross Eckler picked up Cohen's critique in his 1996 book Making the Alphabet Dance, speculating that Hughes may have \\"expected it to be obvious, but he did not take into account the credulity of logologists, sensitized by dictionary-sanctioned outlandish words such as mlechchha and qaraqalpaq. The book You Say Tomato: An Amusing and Irreverent Guide to the Most Often Mispronounced Words in the English Language, published in 2005, appears to take the word seriously. Citing \\"eminent alternative lexicographer Mr. Peter Bowler\\" it gives the meaning as a MƒÅori drum; however it declines to offer a pronunciation, saying that \\"We'll leave the pronunciation to the Maoris, although Welshmen and Poles are said to be able to do wonders with it\\".

The band was founded in 1993. Its musical style includes elements of hard rock, heavy metal, funk, country, opera, experimental, electronica, and polka. History Founded in 1993, M.I.R.V initially consisted of the band's namesake guitarist and singer, Marc \\"Mirv\\" Haggard, bassist Craig McFarland, and drummer David Kobza. Former Fungo Mungo drummer Jeff Gomes replaced Kobza in 1994. The band recorded Feeding Time on Monkey Island and Dancing Naked in a Mine Field. Guitarist Bryan Kehoe contributed to vocals and keyboards. Kehoe left the band in 2001 to form The Kehoe Nation, and was replaced by Spent Poets singer Adam Gates, aka \\"The Filthy Ape\\". The band played shows as a 5-piece band with both Kehoe and Gates. Gates formed Madame Blavatsky Overdrive with McFarland and Gomes and recorded the Debut album Idiot Jones will Have His Day with engineer Craig McFarland. Kehoe-era M.I.R.V. shows often featured songs punctuated by interludes of lunacy, usually featuring a verbal interchange between Haggard and Kehoe. Often Haggard would announce a contest for the women in the audience, after which the winner would be cajoled into grabbing Kehoe's groin, causing him to sing in a high-pitched operatic voice. Kehoe would often sing the Neapolitan standard \\"'O Sole Mio\\" following the antics. M.I.R.V. shows would regularly feature Haggard playing an electric saw during portions of the concerts. M.I.R.V.'s first album, Cosmodrome, was written and recorded by Haggard and featured a character named Granddad, later revealed to be Primus' Les Claypool, who also put the record out on his own Prawn Song label. The album features songs interspersed with skits and is generally regarded as a concept album. The next two records were released on Poison Eye, M.I.R.V.'s own label, and primarily feature music. These latter two albums saw the band form into a four-piece touring outfit, as opposed to a studio project. The band toured worldwide alongside acts like Jerry Cantrell, Fishbone, Primus and played with groups like Cheap Trick, Run DMC, Papa Roach and Nuclear Rabbit.CDbaby.com: MIRV In 2014, both Mirv and guitarist Bryan Kehoe played several gigs with Les Claypool across the U.S. Cultural References The band's song, \\"Monkey Boy\\", was featured in a commercial for the game Fighting Vipers on the Sega Saturn.

History The idea of having an Obstetric Flying Squad was suggested by Professor E Farquhar Murray who wrote that \\"instead of rushing a shocked and collapsed patient to hospital for nursing and specialist aid, the specialist and nurse should be rushed to the patient\\" (see Liang reference below). In the United Kingdom in the 1930s, the majority of births occurred in the home. The first organised obstetric flying squad was started by H. J. Thomson in Bellshill, Lanarkshire, Scotland in 1933 to provide emergency back- up to general practitioners and midwives involved in home births. The commonest major problems dealt with by the squad were: * major post-partum haemorrhage * retained placenta * obstructed labour The mothers were frequently severely shocked and the baby was also likely to be in a precarious position. Many lives were saved during the early years of operation of the service. Other countries with high home-birth rates subsequently copied the idea and set up similar services. In most developed countries the majority of births now occur in hospitals and the ambulance services are well-developed, so the need for the service is extremely low. Less than 1% of births in the UK now occur in the home. The priority now is for rapid transport of distressed mothers to a hospital. The original aim was to primarily manage obstetric complications on site, then secondarily transport the mother and child to hospital. This gradually evolved into primary on-site resuscitation than rapid transport to definitive care in a hospital. The concept of a hospital medical team going to retrieve patients continues in the concept of trauma retrieval teams. Team composition and equipment The flying squad typically consisted of an obstetrician, anaesthetist, midwife, and a helper such as a hospital orderly. The service was activated following a phone call for assistance, and the team members would 'fly' (meaning 'travel quickly') to the scene. The anaesthetic equipment initially was quite simple and consisted of a Schimmelbusch mask to administer chloroform. Later more sophisticated equipment was used. Of great importance was intravenous infusion equipment, intravenous fluids and later the provision of group O blood. References *Liang DYS.

He was a World War II veteran, teacher, scholar, and long term member of the University of Michigan community. Atkinson was a leader in establishing motivation as a distinct field of study in psychology research. His belief that scientific progress came from conceptual breakthroughs fueled his formulation and reformulation of a theory of motivation. He was one of the first in psychology to incorporate rigorous mathematical models in his theories and to use computer simulations of these models for experimentation. He also recognized the importance of measurement in science, maintaining a career-long interest in the refinement of measures of motivation by means of content analysis of imaginative thought using, for example, the Thematic Apperception Test which he developed jointly with his mentor David C. McClelland. He is well known for establishing measures for motives of achievement, affiliation, fear, sex, risk-taking behavior, and aggression. His discipline-changing ideas were followed around the world. In recognition, he received in 1979 the American Psychological Association's highest award, the Gold Medal for Distinguished Scientific Contributions. Atkinson was born in Jersey City, NJ, to Frank G. and Wilhelmina \\"Minnie\\" Atkinson. He attended public schools in Oradell NJ, graduating from Dwight Morrow High School in Englewood NJ. He enlisted in the U.S. Army Air Corp, earning his wings in 1944. He served as an advanced instrument flight instructor for the B-25 and other bombers. On earning his wings Jack married his high-school sweetheart Mary Jane Wanta. They were married in 1944 in Macon, GA. After the war Atkinson completed his undergraduate psychology degree with Honors at Wesleyan University, graduating in the middle of the 1946-47 academic year. As a lecturer at Wesleyan University, he began to pursue his interests in basic research on the arousal of human needs and behavior with the financial support of the Office of Naval Research and collaboration with David McClelland. Atkinson was awarded his doctorate in Psychology in 1950 at the University of Michigan. He was invited to join the faculty of the University of Michigan in the Psychology Department where he remained his entire career (1950 - 1985). Atkinson was devoted to the teaching of undergraduates throughout his career. As one of the original founders of the University of Michigan's Honors Program in the College of Literature, Science and the Arts, Professor Atkinson fostered unique opportunities and created multi-disciplinary courses to challenge undergraduate students. He authored and edited many books and articles on the scientific study of human motivation, achievement and behavior. Many of his books have been translated into other languages, including Russian, German, and Spanish. His theoretical and experimental work spanned decades and spawned many doctorates. Atkinson was elected a Fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1979. Other awards and honors include a Guggenheim Fellowship (1960), participation twice as a Fellow at the Center for Advanced Study in the Behavioral Sciences at Stanford University, Fellow of the American Psychological Association, an Honorary Doctorate from Ruhr University, Germany, Wesleyan University Distinguished Alumni Award, the Association for Psychological Science: William James Fellow Award, and the American Psychological Association's highest award, the Gold Medal for Distinguished Scientific Contribution. Atkinson was honored on his retirement with a special colloquium at the University which brought together a number of his former students and colleagues who spoke of his inspiration and contributions to the science of human motivation. He was named Professor Emeritus in 1985. Atkinson insisted on ethical behavior and highly valued the fundamental freedoms on which the USA was founded. An expression of his support for a free press was his role as a member of the Board of Control of the Michigan Daily during the turbulent 1960s. In the early 1970s, his beliefs led him to become outraged by the behavior of President Richard M. Nixon, whom he viewed as a threat to liberty and justice. Jack organized and led public meetings and demonstrations denouncing President Nixon and vigorously promoted Nixon's impeachment by Congress.

Many islanders in the area indicate that this ceremony originated on the island of Pollap, or nearby islands. The Pwo ceremony today is having a comeback in importance. In the days before World War II, it was common to have Pwo take place. After WWII, through westernization and the influence of missionaries traditional practices including Pwo started to be abandoned. Mau Piailug, famous for helping Hawaiians regain their traditional navigation skills, was the last person to go through the Pwo ceremony in 1951. For thirty-nine years, the ceremony lay dormant. Then, in May 1990, Pwo again took place. This time Jesus Urupiy, a master navigator, with help of an American ethnographer and documentary filmmaker, Eric Metzgar, conducted the Pwo for his son, Ali Haleyalur, and four other students on the island of Lamotrek. This event was subsequently made into the film Spirits of the Voyage. On March 18, 2007, Piailug presided over the first Pwo ceremony for navigators on the island of Satawal in 56 years. At the event five native Hawaiians and eleven others were inducted into Pwo as master navigators. The Polynesian Voyaging Society presented Piailug a double-hulled canoe, the Alingano Maisu, as a gift for his key role in reviving traditional wayfinding navigation in Hawaii. Then in March 2008, Piailug presided the Pwo ceremony for Maori navigator Hekenukumai Nga Iwi Busby.

Early life Greig was born in Broughty Ferry, Scotland in 1880, one of eight children of textile merchant and higher education advocate Robert Greig, and his wife Jane. She attended school in Dundee, Scotland, before the family moved to Melbourne, Victoria, Australia in 1889. From 1894 she attended the Presbyterian Ladies' College, Melbourne, but decided to leave school after 1896 and enrolled in an arts/law degree at the University of Melbourne in 1897, the first woman to enter the Faculty of Law, and indeed the first to enter any law school in Australia. Although the male students at the Law school were initially opposed to her studying there, they voted at the end of Greig's first year that women ought to be allowed to practise law. Career Greig completed her Bachelor of Arts degree in 1900 (although she did not formally graduate until 1904), and on 28 March 1903, graduated with her Bachelor of Laws degree, the first woman in Victoria to do so, and only the second in the country, after Ada Evans who graduated the previous year from the University of Sydney. Greig received third-class honours for her degree, placing her second in her year level. The rules of practice in force at the time did not comprehend female lawyers, and there was no precedent of women becoming lawyers, in any of the Australian states. Evans had been denied admission to the New South Wales Bar after she graduated on the basis of her sex, forcing her to campaign for the rules of practice legislation to be changed to specifically allow women. Greig and her supporters had already conducted a campaign in Victoria, and in April 1903 the Parliament of Victoria passed the Women's Disabilities Removal Act 1903, nicknamed the \\"Flos Greig Enabling Act\\", to specifically allow women to practise. Greig completed her articles of clerkship, and on 1 August 1905 was admitted to the Victorian Bar, becoming the first woman admitted to legal practice in Australia. A short time later, she was the first woman admitted to the Law Institute of Victoria. She commenced work as a self-employed solicitor in Melbourne. One of her first jobs was for the Women's Christian Temperance Union, drafting their proposed amendments to the Children's Court Act 1906 (Vic), the legislation which established the Children's Court of Victoria. Greig later worked as an employee of Cornwall Stodart, a firm of solicitors in Melbourne. In about 1930, Greig moved to the town of Wangaratta in north-east Victoria, where she worked in a firm of solicitors led by Paul McSwiney. During this time she toured the countryside around Wangaratta promoting adult and tertiary education. Greig retired in 1942, and moved to Rosebud on the Mornington Peninsula. Greig lived in Rosebud until her death in 1958 in Moorabbin, aged 78. Family Greig had four sisters and three brothers. While two of her brothers followed her father into the family textile business, the women of the family blazed their own trails. Sisters Jane and Janet were two of the first women to study medicine in Australia, at the University of Melbourne, Jane a pioneer in public health and Janet the first anaesthetist in Victoria. Another sister, Clara, founded a coaching school for university students. The youngest sister, Stella, followed Flos into law, graduating from the University of Melbourne with a Bachelor of Laws degree on 8 April 1911. Stella died of tuberculosis less than two years later, aged 24.

It begins at Siltcoos Lake, which straddles the border between Douglas and Lane counties. The river meanders generally west to the Pacific Ocean. It is located about south of Florence and north of Reedsport. The river, losing little elevation between source and mouth, passes through the Westlake section of Dunes City, under U.S. Route 101, and through a marshy area and sand dunes of Oregon Dunes National Recreation Area, which is within Siuslaw National Forest. Recreation The river's relative flatness makes it suitable for canoeing in either direction, although the lower end has no boat launch and the beach nearby is closed between March 15 and September 15 to protect snowy plover nesting areas. Campgrounds along or near the river include Tyee, on the east side of U.S. Route 101, as well as Waxmyrtle, Lagoon, and Driftwood on the west side. Tyee and the Lodgepole picnic area near the lake have canoe launch points; a small dam just west of Route 101 requires a portage. Trails wind through areas near the river. A self-guided nature trail follows an oxbow bend in the river near Lagoon campground. A trail meanders along the river from Waxmyrtle campground to the beach, and a loop trail connects primitive campgrounds near Siltcoos Lake. The Siltcoos Lake Trail, with a trailhead east of U.S. Route 101 about south of Florence, is frequented by mountain bikers. Fishing for coho salmon, coastal cutthroat trout, and largemouth bass is allowed in the upstream stretch of the river between the lake and U.S. Route 101.

Biography Ferdinando Russo was born on November 25, 1866 in Naples, Ferdinando Russo; il coraggio del poeta, La Repubblica, 18 December 2005 the second of seven children, from Gennaro Russo, an official at the consumer tax office, and from Cecilia De Blasio. Gabriele Scalessa, Russo, Ferdinando, Dizionario Biografico degli Italiani (2017) He attended the Technical Institute reluctantly and frequented with great interest instead a republican club located in piazza Trinit√† Maggiore, participating in the many protest demonstrations. He was therefore arrested by the police in 1882. After leaving his studies, he worked as a proofreader for the Gazzetta di Napoli, taking an interest in poetry in the Neapolitan dialect, to which he then dedicated much of his life. He worked as an employee at the Archaeological Museum of Naples and published the texts of Sunettiata (Naples 1887) with dialogues of commoners, prisoners, guappi, he overheard in the streets of Naples. Also in 1887 he wrote one of his first (and most successful) songs in Neapolitan, Sc√®tate (Svegliati - Wake up), with the music composed by Mario Pasquale Costa, one of the 250 songs he would write. In the largest Neapolitan daily newspaper Il Mattino, he ran a column of worldly and literary events, raising endless controversies, criticizing the renewer of Neapolitan dialect poetry Salvatore Di Giacomo for errors or improprieties in the use of the Neapolitan language. At the newspaper he became close friends with Edoardo Scarfoglio, Matilde Serao, Gabriele D'Annunzio and . A passionate and exuberant personality, he was expelled from Il Mattino for one of his many disputes. He had contacts with the Camorra and followed well known judicial cases, such as those of Ciccio Cappuccio and Gennaro Cuocolo.Ferdinando Russo, in: Italian Dialect Poetry by Luigi Bonaffini, Brooklyn College After having beaten up a Camorrista who was annoying his girlfriend, the then nineteen-year old Russo was approached by the guappo Teofilo Sperino. Later he also met Cappuccio, the head of the \\"honoured society\\". He was the author of a small volume, La Camorra, about organized crime in Naples, serialized in five installments in 1897 in Il Mattino. He wrote the poem \\"Canzone 'e Ciccio Cappuccio,\\" immortalising the legendary Camorra chief Cappuccio when he died in 1892. Canzone 'e Ciccio Cappuccio, by Ferdinando Russo, Il Mattino, December 9, 1892 His fame and knowledge of the slums and underworld of Naples was such that Emile Zola wanted him as an escort in his descent in the belly of the Neapolitan labyrinth in 1894. The first novel of Russo, written as a feuilleton in 1907 and published by Treves (Memorie d‚Äôun ladro - Memoirs of a thief), was based on the costumes of the Camorra underworld. The same year he published Origini, usi, costumi e riti dell‚ÄôAnnorata soggiet√† (Origins, customs, traditions and rituals of the \\"Honoured Society\\") in collaboration with Ernesto Serao, which was a combination of an essay, journalistic investigation and historical reconstruction with portraits of famous Camorristi and popular sonnets on the subject. In 1901 he married Elisa Rosa Pennazzi, a caf√©-chantant singer. The marriage ended early due to the jealousy of his wife, who had have him followed by a private investigator. Already suffering from diabetes, he died in Naples on January 30, 1927.

It is related to deconstructionism and to Nietzsche's criticism of the Kantian noumenon. Indeterminacy in philosophy Introduction The problem of indeterminacy arises when one observes the eventual circularity of virtually every possible definition. It is easy to find loops of definition in any dictionary, because this seems to be the only way that certain concepts, and generally very important ones such as that of existence, can be defined in the English language. A definition is a collection of other words, and in any finite dictionary if one continues to follow the trail of words in search of the precise meaning of any given term, one will inevitably encounter this linguistic indeterminacy. Philosophers and scientists generally try to eliminate indeterminate terms from their arguments, since any indeterminate thing is unquantifiable and untestable; similarly, any hypothesis which consists of a statement of the properties of something unquantifiable or indefinable cannot be falsified and thus cannot be said to be supported by evidence that does not falsify it. This is related to Popper's discussions of falsifiability in his works on the scientific method. The quantifiability of data collected during an experiment is central to the scientific method, since reliable conclusions can only be drawn from replicable experiments, and since in order to establish observer agreement scientists must be able to quantify experimental evidence. Kant and hazards of positing the \\"thing in itself\\" Immanuel Kant unwittingly proposed one answer to this question in his Critique of Pure Reason by stating that there must \\"exist\\" a \\"thing in itself\\" ‚Äì a thing which is the cause of phenomena, but not a phenomenon itself. But, so to speak, \\"approximations\\" of \\"things in themselves\\" crop up in many models of empirical phenomena. Singularities in physics, such as gravitational singularities, certain aspects of which (e.g., their unquantifiability) can seem almost to mirror various \\"aspects\\" of the proposed \\"thing in itself\\", are generally eliminated (or attempts are made at eliminating them) in newer, more precise models of the universe. Definitions of various psychiatric disorders stem, according to philosophers who draw on the work of Michel Foucault, from a belief that something unobservable and indescribable is fundamentally \\"wrong\\" with the mind of whoever suffers from such a disorder. Proponents of Foucault's treatment of the concept of insanity would assert that one need only try to quantify various characteristics of such disorders as presented in today's Diagnostic and Statistical Manual (e.g., delusion, one of the diagnostic criteria which must be exhibited by a patient if he or she is to be considered to have schizophrenia) in order to discover that the field of study known as abnormal psychology relies upon indeterminate concepts in defining virtually each \\"mental disorder\\" it describes. The quality that makes a belief a delusion is indeterminate to the extent to which it is unquantifiable; arguments that delusion is determined by popular sentiment (i.e., \\"almost no-one believes that he or she is made of cheese, and thus that belief is a delusion\\") would lead to the conclusion that, for example, Alfred Wegener's assertion of continental drift was a delusion since it was dismissed for decades after it was made. Nietzsche and the indeterminacy of the \\"thing in itself\\" Relevant criticism of Kant's original formulation of the \\"thing in itself\\" can be found in the works of Friedrich Wilhelm Nietzsche, who argued against what he held to be the indeterminate nature of such concepts as the Platonic idea, the subject, the Kantian noumenon, the opposition of \\"appearance\\" to \\"reality\\", etc. Nietzsche concisely argued against Kant's noumenon in his On Truth and Lies in a Nonmoral Sense as follows: : \\"The 'thing in itself' (which is precisely what the pure truth, apart from any of its consequences, would be) is likewise something quite incomprehensible to the creator of language and something not in the least worth striving for.\\"Nietzsche, F., On Truth and Lies In his Beyond Good and Evil, Nietzsche argues against the \\"misleading significance of words\\" and its production of a \\"thing in itself\\": : \\"I would repeat it, however, a hundred times, that 'immediate certainty,' as well as 'absolute knowledge' and the 'thing in itself,' involve a CONTRADICTIO IN ADJECTO; we really ought to free ourselves from the misleading significance of words!\\"Nietzsche, F. Beyond Good and Evil Furthermore, Nietzsche argued against such singularities as the atom in the scientific models of his day in The Will to Power: : \\"For all its detachment and freedom from emotion, our science is still the dupe of linguistic habits; it has never got rid of those changelings called 'subjects.' The atom is one such changeling, another is the Kantian 'thing-in-itself.'\\"Nietzsche quotes Approximation versus equality The concept of something that is unapproachable but always further-approximable has led to a rejection by philosophers like Nietzsche of the concept of exact equality in general in favor of that of approximate similarity: : \\"Every word instantly becomes a concept precisely insofar as it is not supposed to serve as a reminder of the unique and entirely individual original experience to which it owes its origin; but rather, a word becomes a concept insofar as it simultaneously has to fit countless more or less similar cases ‚Äì which means, purely and simply, cases which are never equal and thus altogether unequal.\\"Nietzsche quote : \\"What then is truth? A movable host of metaphors, metonymies, and; anthropomorphisms: in short, a sum of human relations which have been poetically and rhetorically intensified, transferred, and embellished, and which, after long usage, seem to a people to be fixed, canonical, and binding. Truths are illusions which we have forgotten are illusions- they are metaphors that have become worn out and have been drained of sensuous force, coins which have lost their embossing and are now considered as metal and no longer as coins.\\" If one states an equation between two things, one states, in effect, that they are the same thing. It can be argued that this cannot possibly be true, since one will then consider the properties which the two sides of the equation share ‚Äì that which makes them \\"equal\\" ‚Äì but one also can, and does, consider them as two separate concepts. Even in a mathematical statement as simple as \\"x=x\\", one encounters fundamental differences between the two \\"x\\"es under consideration: firstly, that there are two distinct \\"x\\"es, in that they neither occupy the same space on this page nor in one's own mind. There would otherwise be only one \\"x\\". Secondly, that if two things were absolutely equal in every possible respect, then there would necessarily be no reason to consider their equality. Nothing could lead anyone to consider the possibility or impossibility of their equality if there were no properties not shared between \\"them\\", since there would necessarily be no relationship between them whatsoever. Thirdly, and most importantly, if two things were equal in every possible respect they would necessarily not be two things, but the very same thing, since there would be no difference to separate them. In examples as odd as this, the differences between two approximately equal things may be very small indeed, and it is certainly true that they are quite irrelevant to most discussions. Acceptance of the reflexive property illustrated above has led to useful mathematical discoveries which have influenced the life of anyone reading this article on a computer. But in an examination of the possibility of the determinacy of any possible concept, differences like this are supremely relevant since that quality which could possibly make two separate things \\"equal\\" seems to be indeterminate.

The indeterminacy of the pharmakon in Derrida's Plato's Pharmacy Indeterminacy was discussed in one of Jacques Derrida's early works Plato's Pharmacy (1969),Derrida, Plato's Pharmacy in Dissemination, 1972, Athlone Press, London, 1981 a reading of Plato's Phaedrus and Phaedo. Plato writes of a fictionalized conversation between Socrates and a student, in which Socrates tries to convince the student that writing is inferior to speech.Phaedrus 275c Socrates uses the Egyptian myth of Thoth's creation of writing to illustrate his point. As the story goes, Thoth presents his invention to the god-king of Upper Egypt for judgment. Upon its presentation, Thoth offers script as a pharmakon for the Egyptian people. The Greek word pharmakon poses a quandary for translators: it is both a remedy and a poison. In the proffering of a pharmakon, Thoth presents it as its true meaning: a harm and benefit. The god-king, however, refuses the invention. Through various reasonings, he determines the pharmakon of writing to be a bad thing for the Egyptian people. The pharmakon, the undecidable, has been returned decided. The problem, as Derrida reasons, is this: since the word pharmakon, in the original Greek, means both a remedy and a poison, it cannot be determined as fully remedy or fully poison. Amon rejected writing as fully poison in Socrates' retelling of the tale, thus shutting out the other possibilities. Foucault and the indeterminacy of insanity The philosopher Michel Foucault wrote about the existence of such problems of precise definition in the very concept of insanity itself ‚Äì a very rough approximation of his argument can be found in the late social commentator and journalist Hunter S. Thompson's book, Kingdom of Fear: > \\"The only difference between the Sane and the Insane, is IN and yet within > this world, the Sane have the power to have the Insane locked up.\\"H. S. > Thompson quote Another summary of Foucault's original argument against the indeterminacy of the concept of insanity in his Madness and Civilization can be found in the following excerpt from the Literature, Arts, and Medicine Database: > \\"Central to this is the notion of confinement as a meaningful exercise. > Foucault's history explains how the mad came first to be confined; how they > became identified as confined due to moral and economic factors that > determined those who ought to be confined; how they became perceived as > dangerous through their confinement, partly by way of atavistic > identification with the lepers whose place they had come to occupy; how they > were 'liberated' by Pinel and Tuke, but in their liberation remained > confined, both physically in asylums and in the designation of being mad; > and how this confinement subsequently became enacted in the figure of the > psychiatrist, whose practice is 'a certain moral tactic contemporary with > the end of the eighteenth century, preserved in the rites of the asylum > life, and overlaid by the myths of positivism.' Science and medicine, > notably, come in at the later stages, as practices 'elaborated once this > division' between the mad and the sane has been made (ix).\\"Foucault, M. > Madness and Civilisation In The Archaeology of Knowledge, Foucault addresses indeterminacy directly by discussing the origin of the meaning of concepts: > \\"Foucault directs his analysis toward the 'statement', the basic unit of > discourse that he believes has been ignored up to this point. 'Statement' is > the English translation from French √©nonc√© (that which is enunciated or > expressed), which has a peculiar meaning for Foucault. '√ânonc√©' for Foucault > means that which makes propositions, utterances, or speech acts meaningful. > In this understanding, statements themselves are not propositions, > utterances, or speech acts. Rather, statements create a network of rules > establishing what is meaningful, and it is these rules that are the > preconditions for propositions, utterances, or speech acts to have meaning. > Statements are also 'events'.

The Archaeology of > Knowledge The difference described by Foucault between the sane and the insane does have observable and very real effects on millions of people daily and can be characterized in terms of those effects, but it can also serve to illustrate a particular effect of the indeterminacy of definition: i.e., that insofar as the general public tends not to characterize or define insanity in very precise terms, it tends, according to Foucault, unnecessarily and arbitrarily to confine some of its members on an irrational basis. The less-precisely such states as \\"insanity\\" and \\"criminality\\" are defined in a society, the more likely that society is to fail to continue over time to describe the same behaviors as characteristic of those states (or, alternately, to characterize such states in terms of the same behaviors). Indeterminacy in discourse analysis Steve Hoenisch asserts in his article Interpretation and Indeterminacy in Discourse Analysis that \\"[T]he exact meaning of a speaker's utterance in a contextualized exchange is often indeterminate. Within the context of the analysis of the teacher-pupil exchange, I will argue for the superiority of interactional linguistics over speech act theory because it reduces the indeterminacy and yields a more principled interpretation[...]\\".Hoenisch, S. Interpretation and Indeterminacy in Discourse Analysis Indeterminacy and consciousness Richard Dawkins, who coined the term meme in the 1970s, described the concept of faith in his documentary Root of All Evil? as \\"the process of non-thinking\\". In the documentary, he used Bertrand Russell's analogy between a teapot orbiting the sun (something that cannot be observed because the brightness of the sun would obscure it even from the best telescope's view) and the object of one's faith (in this particular case, God) to explain that a highly indeterminate idea can self-replicate freely: \\"Everybody in the society had faith in the teapot. Stories of the teapot had been handed down for generations as part of the tradition of society. There are holy books about the teapot.\\"Dawkins World of Dawkins In Darwin's Dangerous Idea, Daniel Dennett argues against the existence of determinate meaning (in this case, of the subjective experience of vision for frogs) via an explanation of their indeterminacy in the chapter entitled The Evolution of Meanings, in the section The Quest for Real Meanings: > \\"Unless there were 'meaningless' or 'indeterminate' variation in the > triggering conditions of the various frogs' eyes, there could be no raw > material [...] for selection for a new purpose to act upon. The > indeterminacy that Fodor (and others) see as a flaw [...] is actually a > prediction for such evolution [of \\"purpose\\"]. The idea that there must be > something determinate that the frog's eye really means ‚Äì some possibly > unknowable proposition in froggish that expresses exactly what the frog's > eye is telling the frog's brain ‚Äì is just essentialism applied to meaning > (or function). Meaning, like function on which it so directly depends, is > not something determinate at its birth. [...]\\" Dennet argues, controversially,Lormand, E. Qualia! Now Showing at a Theatre near youDe Leon, D. The Qualities of Qualia against qualia in Consciousness Explained. Qualia are attacked from several directions at once: he maintains they do not exist (or that they are too ill-defined to play any role in science, or that they are really something else, i.e. behavioral dispositions). They cannot simultaneously have all the properties attributed to them by philosophers‚Äîincorrigible, ineffable, private, directly accessible and so on. The multiple drafts theory is leveraged to show that facts about qualia are not definite. Critics object that one's own qualia are subjectively quite clear and distinct to oneself. The self-replicating nature of memes is a partial explanation of the recurrence of indeterminacies in language and thought. The wide influences of Platonism and Kantianism in Western philosophy can arguably be partially attributed to the indeterminacies of some of their most fundamental concepts (namely, the Idea and the Noumenon, respectively). For a given meme to exhibit replication and heritability ‚Äì that is, for it to be able to make an imperfect copy of itself which is more likely to share any given trait with its \\"parent\\" meme than with some random member of the general \\"population\\" of memes ‚Äì it must in some way be mutable, since memetic replication occurs by means of human conceptual imitation rather than via the discrete molecular processes that govern genetic replication. (If a statement were to generate copies of itself that didn't meaningfully differ from it, that process of copying would more accurately be described as \\"duplication\\" than as \\"replication\\", and it would be incorrect to term these statements \\"memes\\"; the same would be true if the \\"child\\" statements did not noticeably inherit a substantial proportion of their traits from their \\"parent\\" statements.) In other words, if a meme is defined roughly (and somewhat arbitrarily) as a statement (or as a collection of statements, like Foucault's \\"discursive formations\\") that inherits some, but not all, of its properties (or elements of its definition) from its \\"parent\\" memes and which self- replicates, then indeterminacy of definition could be seen as advantageous to memetic replication, since an absolute rigidity of definition would preclude memetic adaptation. It is important to note that indeterminacy in linguistics can arguably partially be defeated by the fact that languages are always changing. However, what the entire language and its collected changes continue to reflect is sometimes still considered to be indeterminate. Criticism Persons of faith argue that faith \\"is the basis of all knowledge\\". The Wikipedia article on faith states that \\"one must assume, believe, or have faith in the credibility of a person, place, thing, or idea in order to have a basis for knowledge.\\" In this way the object of one's faith is similar to Kant's noumenon. This would seem to attempt to make direct use of the indeterminacy of the object of one's faith as evidential support of its existence: if the object of one's faith were to be proven to exist (i.e., if it were no longer of indeterminate definition, or if it were no longer unquantifiable, etc.), then faith in that object would no longer be necessary; arguments from authority such as those mentioned above wouldn't either; all that would be needed to prove its existence would be scientific evidence. Thus, if faith is to be considered as a reliable basis for knowledge, persons of faith would seem, in effect, to assert that indeterminacy is not only necessary, but good (see Nassim Taleb). Indeterminacy in new physical theories Science generally attempts to eliminate vague definitions, causally inert entities, and indeterminate properties, via further observation, experimentation, characterization, and explanation. Occam's razor tends to eliminate causally inert entities from functioning models of quantifiable phenomena, but some quantitative models, such as quantum mechanics, actually imply certain indeterminacies, such as the relative indeterminacy of quantum particles' positions to the precision with which their momenta can be measured (and vice versa). (See Heisenberg's indeterminacy principle.) One ardent supporter of the possibility of a final unifying theory (and thus, arguably, of the possibility of the end of some current indeterminacies) in physics, Steven Weinberg, stated in an interview with PBSWeinberg, S. PBS interview that: \\"Sometimes [...] people say that surely there's no final theory because, after all, every time we've made a step toward unification or toward simplification we always find more and more complexity there. That just means we haven't found it yet. Physicists never thought they had the final theory.\\" The Wikipedia article on the possibility of such a \\"theory of everything\\" notes that \\"Other possibilities which may frustrate the explanatory capacity of a TOE may include sensitivity to the boundary conditions of the universe, or the existence of mathematical chaos in its solutions, making its predictions precise, but useless.\\" Chaos theory argues that precise prediction of the behavior of complex systems becomes impossible because of the observer's inability to gather all necessary data. As yet, it seems entirely possible that there shall never be any \\"final theory\\" of all phenomena, and that, rather, explanations may instead breed more and more complex and exact explanations of the new phenomena uncovered by current experimentation. In this argument, the \\"indeterminacy\\" or \\"thing in itself\\" is the \\"final explanation\\" that will never be reached; this can be compared to the concept of the limit in calculus, in that quantities may approach, but never reach, a given limit in certain situations. Criticism Proponents of a deterministic universe have criticised various applications of the concept of indeterminacy in the sciences; for instance, Albert Einstein once stated that \\"God does not play dice\\" in a succinct (but now unpopular) argument against the theory of quantum indeterminacy, which states that the actions of particles of extremely low mass or energy are unpredictable because an observer's interaction with them changes either their positions or momenta. (The \\"dice\\" in Einstein's metaphor refer to the probabilities that these particles will behave in particular ways, which is how quantum mechanics addressed the problem.) At first it might seem that a criticism could be made from a biological standpoint in that an indeterminate idea would seem not to be beneficial to the species that holds it. A strong counterargument, however, is that not all traits exhibited by living organisms will be seen in the long term as evolutionarily advantageous, given that extinctions occur regularly and that phenotypic traits have often died out altogether ‚Äì in other words, an indeterminate meme may in the long term demonstrate its evolutionary value to the species that produced it in either direction; humans are, as yet, the only species known to make use of such concepts. It might also be argued that conceptual vagueness is an inevitability, given the limited capacity of the human nervous systems. We just do not have enough neurons to maintain separate concepts for \\"dog with 1,000,000 hairs\\", \\"dog with 1,000,001 hairs\\" and so on. But conceptual vagueness is not metaphysical indeterminacy. Synonymous concepts in philosophy Uncertainty and indeterminacy are words for essentially the same concept in both quantum mechanics. Unquantifiability, and undefinability (or indefinability), can also sometimes be synonymous with indeterminacy. In science, indeterminacy can sometimes be interchangeable with unprovability or unpredictability. Also, anything entirely inobservable can be said to be indeterminate in that it cannot be precisely characterized.
