It was one of the largest manufacturers of elevators in Australia, and continued as the Otis Elevator Company. Origin The company was initially formed in 1878 as Hughes, Pye & Rigby manufacturing mining plant, steam engines, elevators, wool & other hydraulic presses. It was incorporated as a public company in 1887 as The Austral Otis Engineering and Elevator Company Limited and in October 1893 changed its name to The Austral Otis Engineering Co Ltd. The company epitomised the boom era. It was founded with just £600 in capital, but by the end of the 1880s it employed 300 workers, producing pumping engines, mining machinery, hydraulic lifts and huge steam engines for the city's cable trams and first electric power stations.eMelbourne School of Historical Studies Department of History, The University of Melbourne July 2008 Austral Otis tendered the Victorian Government to produce two steam traction engines after starting up in 1880 as a general engineering business, and in the late 1880s it set up a well equipped works for heavy engineering, which covered about four acres. It had important agencies for machinery including Worthington pumps and the Otis Bros & Co. elevators. The company undertook many major contracts, for mining and other machinery equipment and it was awarded prizes for its steam engines and hoisting equipment at the Centennial Exhibition in 1888, at Melbourne.;The Australasian ironmonger, builder, engineer, and metal worker: A strictly intercolonial journal, May 1889Australia Post History It also built steam rollers, but only two examples of these are known in the world.The Chrysler Collector No 150, January / February 2004 Herbert Brookes came to Melbourne to improve the management of Austral Otis. He was highly successful and by 1912 was a director of the firm.Patrick, Alison, 'Brookes, Herbert Robinson (1867–1963)', Australian Dictionary of Biography, National Centre of Biography, Australian National University, accessed 18 September 2012 Elevators and steam engines With the development of multi-storeyed iron and steel framed buildings during the skyscraper boom in the 1880s, there was created a demand for fast and reliable passenger lifts such as those of the Otis Elevator Company in the US and Waygood of Britain. With these came the establishment in 1889 of a reticulated hydraulic power system, one of very few in the world at that time.eMelbourne School of Historical Studies Department of History, The University of Melbourne July 2008 Austral Otis had a substantial part of this market. The company also made steam engines for the Melbourne cable tramway system, for gold mines and sluicing plant, and the Ballarat Woollen Mills. The Melbourne City Building was originally served internally by an early Otis hydraulic lift,VHR 112–118 ELIZABETH STREET MELBOURNE, Melbourne City H0437 while the 1932 Manchester Unity Building has a rare surviving original Otis-Waygood escalator between the ground floor lobby and mezzanine. This was the first building in Victoria to have escalators installed.Victorian Heritage Register Number H0411 Spotswood Pumping Station About 1896 the Melbourne and Metropolitan Board of Works sewage pumping station at Spotswood, was being built and fitted with large triple expansion steam engines built by Hathorn Davey & Co. of Leeds, UK. and Thompson & Co Worthington type triple-expansion engines installed at Spotswood between 1895 and 1897. Austral Oitis also built an engine for the No. 6 pumping well in 1901. When the MMBW required additional pumping engines in 1909, Austral Otis were asked to prepare plans for four new engines. While these were based largely on the successful Hathorn Davey design, Austral Otis was able to demonstrate its substantial expertise in steam engineering. The first two new Austral Otis engines were commissioned in June and July 1911, followed by the remaining two in mid-1914.Steam Pumping Engine – Austral Otis, No.8 Pumping Engine, MMBW Spotswood Sewerage Pumping Station, 1911 Other products When a drought threatened water supply for Melbourne's gardens, the Dight's Falls Pumping Station located just below the tail race of the mill at Dight's Falls was erected in 1890 with 150 horsepower engines from Austral Otis.Dight’s Falls Pumping Station As part of its pavilion at the New Zealand and South Seas Exhibition, Austral Otis erected a timber tower 40m high, which included an elevator that travelled about 30 m. It was estimated to have cost about £1200 and was known as New Zealand's Eiffel Tower. The Queenscliff lifeboat shed included a slipway with roller, channel, keelway and cradle supplied by the Austral Otis Engineering Co. An unusual piece of large machinery constructed by the Austral Otis company, was Big Lizzie, built for the Mount Gunson copper mine around 1912 when they needed a super heavy truck to handle swamps and to ford small rivers. It was fitted with Frank Bottrill's \\"Dreadnaught Wheels\\" which he patented in 1906. Some of the McDonald's tractors also had these wheels. The truck did not leave Melbourne for Mount Gunson South Australia until 1916.Australia Post History A unique contract was for the No 1 rail grinder, built in 1929 for the Melbourne & Metropolitan Tramways Board, which was used to smooth tramway tracks.Tramway Museum Society of Victoria, Melbourne & Metropolitan Tramways Board Works Trams Another large contract was for a dragline excavator for use in the newly opened brown coal fields of the State Electricity Commission in the Latrobe Valley, Dragline and associated machinery at Austral Otis Engineering Company, South Melbourne, 1920-1935State Library of Victoria rw008195 which followed a plant for making briquettes in 1893–94, for the Great Morwell Coal Mining Company near what is now Yallourn North.Energy from Brown Coal Latrobe Visitor Information Centre Demise The Food Machinery & Chemical Corporation of USA acquired a controlling interest in the business on 30 July 1948, and Austral Otis became a subsidiary of the American company.The Sydney Morning Herald – Aug 10, 1948 Its name was subsequently changed in Sep 1952 to Food Machinery (Australia) Ltd.AUSTRAL OTIS ENGINEERING CO LTD THE UNIVERSITY OF MELBOURNE ARCHIVES 60/10 The Austral Otis name and company thereafter ceased to exist.AUSTRAL OTIS ENGINEERING COMPANY LIMITED 01/09/1952 A two-storey brick building originally constructed in 1888 as the headquarters for Austral Otis Elevator and Engineering Company Limited survives at the corner of Kavanagh Street and Kingsway, Southbank, Melbourne City.

It is closely related to Mru, forming the Mruic language branch, whose position with Sino-Tibetan is unclear. It consists of two dialects, Anu (Añú) and Hkongso (Khongso, Khaungtso). Hkongso and Anu speakers self-identify as ethnic Chin people, although the Anu-Hkongso language does not classify as a Kuki-Chin language.ISO 639-3 Change Request Number: 2011-031 Most Anu and Hkongso speakers can also speak Khumi. Varieties Hkongso and Anu are mutually intelligible. The Kasang claim to be Hkongso, and live in a small area just to the south of the main Hkongso area, in the villages of Lamoitong and Tuirong. The Anu live in scattered areas to the west of the main Hkongso area. Anu villages include Bedinwa, Onphuwa, Payung Chaung, Yeelawa, Daletsa Wa, Ohrangwa, Tuikin Along, and Khayu Chaung (Wright 2009:6). The Anu people consider themselves to consist of 4 subgroups, namely Hkum, Hkong (Hkongso), Som, and Kla. However, the Hkongso maintain that they are an ethnic group equal to the Anu, but are not a subgroup of the Anu. The Kasang (also known as Khenlak, Ta-aw, Hkongsa-Asang, Hkongso-Asang, Asang, and Sangta) consider themselves as ethnic Hkongso, but their language is intelligible with Khumi rather than Anu. Kasang villages include Lamoitong and Tuirong. The Mru language is also closely related to Anu and Hkongso. The Mru had migrated to the Chittagong Hills from the Arakan Hills. Distribution Hkongso is spoken in the following villages of Paletwa Township. *Bahungtong *Halawa *Kanan *Kanlawa *Lakinwa *Likkung *Pahang *Paletwa *Pawa *Phongphai *Ringrong *Sami *Singkangkung *Tengwa *Tuikinwa *Vadengkung *Youngwa Hkongso subgroups (clans) are Htey (Htey Za ),Kamu, Ngan, Gwa, Hteikloeh, Ngai, Rahnam, Kapu, Kasah, Namte, Krawktu, and Namluek. Leimi, Asang, and Likkheng are other languages spoken in the Paletwa Township area. Phonology Hkongso has minor syllables (also known sesquisyllables), which are typical of Mon-Khmer languages (Wright 2009:12-14). Grammar Unlike the Kuki-Chin languages, Hkongso (kʰɔŋ˥˩sʰo˦˨) has no verb stem alternation and has SVO word order (Wright 2009).Wright, Jonathan Michael. 2009. Hkongso Grammar Sketch. MA thesis, Graduate Institute of Applied Linguistics. Also, unlike Mru and the Kuki-Chin languages, Hkongso has Neg-V word order (pre-verbal negation) instead of the V-Neg order (post- verbal negation) found in surrounding languages.

Cenarrhenes nitida is an evergreen shrub to small tree endemic to the rainforests and scrublands of western Tasmania. It bears white flowers in late spring followed by the development of fleshy fruit.  Taxonomy and naming  The French naturalist and explorer Jacques Labillardière described Cenarrhenes nitida in 1805, from a location described as in capite Van Diemen (Tasmania). It still bears its common name today. The genus name is derived from the Ancient Greek words kenos \\"empty\\" and arrhen \\"male\\", referring to the four staminode-like hypogynous glands. The genus only bears the one species, its name the Latin adjective nitida \\"bright/shining\\", referring to its glossy leaves. Although it resembles the persoonias in appearance, it does not appear to be related to them. Instead, it has been grouped with the Australian genera Agastachys, Symphionema and New Caledonian genera Beauprea and Beaupreopsis in the subtribe Cenarrheninae by Johnston and Briggs in 1975. It remained in its own subtribe in the publication of Flora of Australia in 1995, within the tribe Conospermeae and subfamily Proteoideae. In 1998 Sara Hoot and Andrew Douglas analysed chloroplast sequences and found that Cenarrhenes was sister to a clade comprising the three genera Stirlingia, Conospermum and Synaphea. Peter H. Weston and Nigel Barker reviewed the suprageneric relationships of the Proteaceae in 2006, using molecular and morphological data. In this scheme Cenarrhenes is located within the subfamily Proteoideae on account of it having cluster roots, a solitary ovule and indehiscent fruits. In a phylogenetic study including all the Proteaceae genera, it was found that it was most closely related to the genera Beaupreopsis (New Caledonia) and Dilobeia (Madagascar).Sauquet, H., P. H. Weston, C. J. Anderson, N. P. Barker, D. J. Cantrill, A. R. Mast, and Savolainen, V. (2009). Contrasted Patterns of Hyperdiversifaction in Mediterranean Hotspots. Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the USA 106 (1): 221–25. Port Arthur plum and native plum are common names given to the species.  Description  The white flowers have pink tips in bud Cenarrhenes nitida forms an erect shrub to small tree ranging in height from in sheltered sites such as rainforests to in exposed sites. Its leaves, which are roughly 8 to 12 cm long, are thick, dull and hairless with a cleanly serrated edge and rounded tip. These are attached to the stem via a short stalk. The leaves are spread along the branches and have a nauseating stale-cabbage smell when crushed which helps distinguish it from Anopterus glandulosus (Escalloniaceae) which looks similar but lacks the smell and the leaves are often longer and arranged in false whorls. The leaves turn black when dried. Hence the common name, the fruit of Cenarrhenes nitida are a fleshy drupe which closely resemble commercial plums from the genus Prunus. The fruit are roughly in size, but can get up to . They have a smooth, deep purple skin, edible but chalky tasting pink-white flesh and a large stone at the center. Much like plums, the fruit have a groove running down one side of the fruit and a fine dusty layer on the skin giving it a bluish colour which is easily removed by rubbing. Fruit ripen in autumn from March to May. The flowers are produced in early summer from November to December and are small, symmetrical, and unscented. Each flower has four, pointed, fleshy petals which curl backward when open. Closed flowers have pink tips but turn all white when open. The flowers are stalkless and arranged on woody spikes which are shorter than the leaves. The flowers are insect pollinated and have four, thick, cream-yellow stamens. The pollination is spring-loaded and is triggered by a touch sensitive hair on one of the four anthers. Often, only 1 to 3 flowers per stalk will develop into mature fruit with the remainder forming stunted woody balls.  Distribution and habitat Cenarrhenes nitida is endemic to southern and western Tasmania and some of its islands, growing to an altitude of , the margins of the alpine zone. It occurs most often as an understory tree to small shrub in wet sclerophyll forests and rainforest with poor soils and occasionally in heath, button grass sedgeland and scrub. Offshore populations occur inland on South Bruny Island and in forested areas of the De Witt Islands which closely resemble environments on mainland Tasmania.  Cultivation  Cenarrhenes nitida is a slow growing plant which requires a cool, moist, shady site with well composted soils and preferably good drainage. The seeds mature after the flesh has been removed and the stone allowed to dry. The seeds can be stored this way so long as they are kept in a well ventilated place. Germination is triggered by temperatures of roughly 20 °C after at least two months of cold stratification. Cenarrhenes nitida is often difficult to propagate and can be very slow growing if conditions are not right. They are best grown from seed as cuttings will remain green for considerable lengths of time without developing roots before turning brown.

It works by detecting the passage of the ball using magnetic induction. Along with Hawk-Eye, GoalControl and Cairos it is one of four systems approved for use in the professional game by the International Football Association Board (IFAB).cbc.ca - FIFA picks GoalControl goal-line technology for 2014 World Cup History GoalRef was originally developed by a Danish organisation commissioned by Select Sport who entered the system for consideration by the International Handball Federation. In 2011 Fraunhofer became lead partner in GoalRef alongside the original inventor, and entered the system in the first stage testing being conducted for IFAB by EMPA (Swiss Federal Laboratories for Materials Science and Technology). GoalRef and Hawk-Eye were the only systems that proceeded to EMPA's second stage of testing, involving lab and field tests, plus trials in training and live professional matches. In this phase GoalRef was tested in the Danish Superliga. Following the second phase trials, on 5 July 2012 IFAB approved both GoalRef and Hawk-Eye in principle, making it available for use in professional matches under a set of revised Laws of the Game. Each installation however would also require licensing approval for use in the individual stadium, on a 12-month basis. The 2012 FIFA Club World Cup was the first tournament where GoalRef and Hawk-Eye were used by a match referee. GoalRef was used for the first time on 6 December 2012 in the first match of the 2012 FIFA Club World Cup.

It was developed by Elliott, Rothenberg and Stock (ERS) in 1992 as a modification of the augmented Dickey–Fuller test (ADF). A unit root test determines whether a time series variable is non-stationary using an autoregressive model. For series featuring deterministic components in the form of a constant or a linear trend then ERS developed an asymptotically point optimal test to detect a unit root. This testing procedure dominates other existing unit root tests in terms of power. It locally de-trends (de-means) data series to efficiently estimate the deterministic parameters of the series, and use the transformed data to perform a usual ADF unit root test. This procedure helps to remove the means and linear trends for series that are not far from the non-stationary region.Efficient Tests for an Autoregressive Unit Root, Elliott, Rothenberg and Stock, Econometrica Vol. 64, No. 4, pp. 813-836, Jul., 1996  Explanation  Consider a simple time series model y_{t}=d_t+u_{t}\\\\, with u_{t}=\\\\rho u_{t-1}+e_{t}\\\\, where d_t\\\\, is the deterministic part and u_{t}\\\\, is the stochastic part of y_{t}\\\\,. When the true value of \\\\rho \\\\, is close to 1, estimation of the model, i.e. d_t\\\\, will pose efficiency problems because the y_{t}\\\\, will be close to nonstationary. In this setting, testing for the stationarity features of the given times series will also be subject to general statistical problems. To overcome such problems ERS suggested to locally difference the time series. Consider the case where closeness to 1 for the autoregressive parameter is modelled as \\\\rho=1-\\\\frac{c}{T} \\\\, where T \\\\, is the number of observations. Now consider filtering the series using 1-\\\\frac{\\\\bar{c}}{T}L \\\\, with L \\\\, being a standard lag operator, i.e. \\\\bar{y}_t=y_t-(\\\\bar{c}/T)y_{t-1} \\\\,. Working with \\\\bar{y}_t \\\\, would result in power gain, as ERS show, when testing the stationarity features of y_t \\\\, using the augmented Dickey-Fuller test. This is a point optimal test for which \\\\bar{c} \\\\, is set in such a way that the test would have a 50 percent power when the alternative is characterized by \\\\rho=1-c/T \\\\, for c=\\\\bar{c} \\\\,. Depending on the specification of d_t \\\\,, \\\\bar{c} \\\\, will take different values.  References  A Primer on Unit Root Tests, P.C.B. Phillips and Z.

It is one of the main types of protein phosphorylation. This transfer is made possible through enzymes called tyrosine kinases. Tyrosine phosphorylation is a key step in signal transduction and the regulation of enzymatic activity. History In the summer of 1979, studies of polyomavirus middle T and v-Src associated kinase activities led to the discovery of tyrosine phosphorylation as a new type of protein modification. Following the 1979 discovery that Src is a tyrosine kinase, the number of known distinct tyrosine kinases grew rapidly, accelerated by the advent of rapid DNA sequencing technology and PCR. About one year later, researchers discovered an important role for tyrosine phosphorylation in growth factor signaling and proliferation, and by extension in oncogenesis through hijacking of growth factor tyrosine phosphorylation signaling pathways. In 1990 receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) initiation of intracellular signaling was detected. Phosphotyrosine (P.Tyr) residues on activated RTKs are recognized by a phosphodependent-binding domain, the SH2 domain. The recruitment of SH2 domain proteins to autophosphorylated RTKs at the plasma membrane is essential for initiating and propagating downstream signaling. SH2 domain proteins may have a variety of functions, including adaptor proteins to recruit other signaling proteins, enzymes that act on membrane molecules, such as phospholipases, cytoplasmic tyrosine kinases that relay signals, E3 ubiquitin ligases, and transcription factors. In 1995 proteins were found containing a second type of P.Tyr-binding domain, PTB, in RTK signaling. Gradually the number of identified tyrosine kinases and receptor tyrosine kinases grew. As of 2002, of the 90 known human tyrosine kinases, 58 were RTKs, and opposing the action of the tyrosine kinases were 108 protein phosphatases that can remove phosphate from P.Tyr in proteins. Signal transduction Ushiro and Cohen (1980) discovered the important role of the phosphorylation of tyrosine as a regulator of intracellular processes and revealed changes in the tyrosine kinase activity of proteins in mammalian cells. Subsequently, the change in protein tyrosine kinase activity was shown to underlie the Ras-MAPK signaling pathway regulated by mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinases. The classical scheme of transmission of the proliferative signals through the pathway mediated by growth factors (Ras-MAPK pathway) includes: # association of growth factor with receptor # dimerization of receptor and autophosphorylation of receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) # module coupling of RTK with adaptor SH2−domain proteins; activation of Ras # phosphorylation and activation of MAP kinases # transmission of signal into genome. Another pathway of transmission of proliferative signals into the genome, with participation of growth factors and tyrosine kinases, is the monocascade STAT (signal transducer and activator of transcription) protein pathway activated by receptors of growth factors and cytokines. The essence of this transmission consists in direct activation by tyrosine kinases of the STAT (signal transducer and activator of transcription) proteins located in the cytoplasm. This transmission is also provided by the SH2−domain contacts responsible for the coupling of phosphotyrosine-containing proteins. PTK Two important classes of tyrosine kinase in tyrosine phosphorylation are receptor tyrosine kinase and nonreceptor tyrosine kinase. Receptor tyrosine kinases are type I transmembrane proteins possessing an N-terminal extracellular domain, which can bind activating ligands, a single transmembrane domain, and a C-terminal cytoplasmic domain that includes the catalytic domain. Nonreceptor tyrosine kinases lack a transmembrane domain. Most are soluble intracellular proteins, but a subset associate with membranes via a membrane-targeting posttranslational modification, such as an N-terminal myristoyl group, and can act as the catalytic subunit for receptors that lack their own catalytic domain. Reaction Protein tyrosine kinases (PTKs) catalyze the transfer of the γ-phosphate group from ATP to the hydroxyl group of tyrosine residues, whereas protein tyrosine phosphatases (PTPs) remove the phosphate group from phosphotyrosine. Function =Growth factor signaling= Tyrosine phosphorylation of certain target proteins is required for ligand stimulation of their enzymatic activity. In response to EGF, PDGF, or FGF receptor activation, the SH2 domains of PLCγ bind to specific phosphotyrosines in the C-terminal tails of these receptors. Binding of PLCγ to the activated receptor facilitates its efficient tyrosine phosphorylation by the RTK. PDGF-induced activation of phospholipase C activity is abrogated in cells expressing PLCγ mutated in the tyrosine phosphorylation sites. =Cell adhesion, spreading, migration and shape= Phosphorylation on tyrosine residues, which are localized on membrane proteins, stimulates a cascade of signaling pathways that control cell proliferation, migration, and adhesion. These tyrosine residues are phosphorylated very early. For example, p140Cap (Cas-associated protein) are phosphorylated within 15 minutes of cell adhesion to integrin ligands. =Cell differentiation in development= Tyrosine phosphorylation mediates in signal transduction pathways during germ cell development and determines their association with the differentiation of a functional gamete. Until testicular germ cells differentiate into spermatozoa, cAMP-induced tyrosine phosphorylation is not detectable. Entry of these cells into the epididymis is accompanied by sudden activation of the tyrosine phosphorylation pathway, initially in the principal piece of the cell and subsequently in the midpiece. =Cell cycle control= Transitions in the phases of the cell cycle are also dependent on tyrosine phosphorylation. In the late G2 phase, it is present as an inactive complex of tyrosine- phosphorylated p34cdc2 and unphosphorylated cyclin Bcdc13. In M phase, its activation as an active MPF displaying histone H1 kinase (H1K) originates from the concomitant tyrosine dephosphorylation of the p34cdc2 subunit and the phosphorylation of the cylin Bcdc13 subunit. As cells leave the S phase and enter the G2 phase, a massive tyrosine phosphorylation of p34cdc2 occurs. =Gene regulation and transcription= Regulation with tyrosine phosphorylation plays a very important role in gene regulation. Tyrosine phosphorylation can influence the formation of different transcription factors and the subsequent development of their product. One of these cases is tyrosine phosphorylation of caveolin 2 (Cav-2) that negatively regulates the anti-proliferative function of transforming growth factor beta (TGF-beta) in endothelial cells. Only tyrosine phosphorylation is essential for the negative regulation of anti-proliferative function and signaling of TGF-β in ECs. =Endocytosis and exocytosis= The phosphorylation of tyrosine residues plays an important role in these two very important processes. Ligand- dependent endocytosis, which is not coupled to secretion, is known to be regulated via tyrosine phosphorylation. The effect of tyrosine phosphorylation is specific to rapid endocytosis. Dynamin is tyrosine phosphorylated in rapid endocytosis as well as in ligand dependent endocytosis. =Insulin stimulation of glucose uptake= Insulin binds to the insulin receptor at the cell surface and activates its tyrosine kinase activity, leading to autophosphorylation and phosphorylation of several receptor substrates. Phosphorylation of selected tyrosine sites on receptor substrates is known to activate different pathways leading to increased glucose uptake, lipogenesis, and glycogen and protein synthesis, as well as to the stimulation of cell growth. In addition to the activation of these pathways by tyrosine phosphorylation, several mechanisms of downregulating the response to insulin stimulation have also been identified. =Angiogenesis (formation of new blood vessels)= Protein tyrosine phosphorylation of capillary endothelial cells plays an important role in their proliferation. This phosphorylation can form new blood vessels. =Regulation of ion channels in nerve transmission= Many studies demonstrating high levels of protein-tyrosine kinases and phosphatases in the central nervous system have suggested that tyrosine phosphorylation is also involved in the regulation of neuronal processes. High levels of protein- tyrosine kinases and phosphatases and their substrates at synapses, both presynaptically and postsynaptically, suggest that tyrosine phosphorylation may regulate synaptic transmission. The role of tyrosine phosphorylation in the regulation of ligand-gated ion channels in the central nervous system has been less clear. The major excitatory neurotransmitter receptors in the central nervous system are the glutamate receptors. These receptors can be divided into three major classes, AMPA, kainate, and NMDA receptors, based on their selective agonists and on their physiological properties. Recent studies have provided evidence that NMDA receptors are regulated by tyrosine phosphorylation. Tyrosine kinase and diseases Tyrosine kinases are critical mediators of intracellular signaling and of intracellular responses to extracellular signaling. Changes in tyrosine kinase activity are implicated in numerous human diseases, including cancers, diabetes, and pathogen infectivity. Understanding the mechanism of CD4-mediated negative signaling is of particular interest in view of the progressive depletion of the CD4+ subset of T lymphocytes by the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), which causes AIDS. T-cells from HIV-infected individuals also display activation defects, and undergo spontaneous apoptosis in culture. Similarities between the inhibitory effects of anti-CD4 antibodies and HIV-derived gp 120 immune complexes on T-cells suggest that sequestration of this and/or other putative substrates by gp 120-mediated CD4 ligation in HIV-infected individuals may play a role in the loss of CD4+ cells and the inhibition of their activation.

AISHA seeks to protect women and children from violence through supporting, empowering, and raising awareness of important psychological, social, legal, and economic issues. Furthermore, during implementation of its strategic plan, AISHA has developed and applied a Gender Mainstreaming in all fields of implementation Ever since its establishment, Aisha worked on the empowerment of vulnerable women and children victims of violence in response to the identified needs in the Women and children portion of the community. AISHA started adopting the individual empowerment approach which takes into consideration the individual differences. Accordingly, it has been successful in achieving substantially higher rates of empowerment. AISHA continued a conduit to reach the targeted beneficiaries. On the other hand, focus has been given to influence the community agenda through the sensitization of key individuals and organizations towards the issues of domestic violence, gender equality, and feminist issues. Also, AISHA works on mobilizing and lobbying opinion to influence and pressure on decision-making to get a favourable laws and legislation for women and children in all fields Vision and goals AISHA aspires to play a leading role for protecting women and children victims of violence and at risk and people with special needs in the Gaza Strip to enable them to be active contributors in sustainable community development. The direct beneficiaries of AISHA are women victims of violence and at risk, with special focus on women with disabilities and women headed displaced households, children of these women aged 6–12 years and families of women victims of violence, school counsellors, teachers, doctors and psychosocial service providers. The following strategic objectives orient all AISHA activities: * Increase effectiveness and efficiency of women, with special focus on women victims of violence, participation in community development through enhanced access to support services and protection. * A sensitive environment to safeguard and nurture the development of children and their families for better future. * Legislators and decision makers, are participating in the process of empowering women and children through favourable laws and regulations. * AISHA is a capable organization in the administrative, professional and financial fields. History Prior to 2009 and since 1996, AISHA used to operate under the name \\"Women Empowerment Program (WEP)\\" as the women department within the Gaza Community Mental Health Program (GCHMP). Given the change in the mandate and expanding scope of the GCHMP into a knowledge-based organization focusing of action research, training and advocacy, a restructuring process took place by which the WEP evolved into an independent organization, namely: AISHA. AISHA was under the administrative and financial umbrella of GCMHP until December 31, 2010, so AISHA and since it got its new registration started to seek funding opportunity where it get fund to implement some projects, for instance, 105 women get benefited from the Individual Empowerment Program and 680 individual get benefited from legal awareness sessions in addition to other projects and activities. On Wednesday, 16 January 2013, the Gaza city head office of the association was the subject of a break-in by unknown assailants. = First project = *Project Title: \\"Empowerment of Violated Women, and those at Risk\\" * Implementation date: 1/4/2011 to 31/12/2011 * Locations: Governorates of both Gaza and the North * Number of beneficiaries: 70 women * Financier: SDC Swedish Development Commission * Budget: US$87,783  Nature of the project  The project provides vocational training for seventy women, admitted in two batches, given training in sewing, beauty services, ceramics, knitting and video.

It was introduced in September 2012, and is the successor to the Leica M9 range of cameras. The M uses a 24-megapixel image sensor. The camera is the first M model to feature movie recording, and the first to have Live View, which allows the scene, as viewed through the lens, to be composed. The M can use most M- and R-mount lenses. Leica M cameras are made by hand in Portugal and Germany. There is also a version, the M Monochrom, with a monochrome, rather than colour, sensor.Leica M Monochrom Review The M Typ 240 has been superseded by variants such as the Leica M10. Features The M uses a CMOS 24-megapixel (6,000 × 4,000 pixels) image sensor designed for Leica by the Belgian company CMOSIS, and made by STMicroelectronics in Grenoble. The pixels are on a 6 x 6 µm² grid. The M supports most M-mount lenses and, with an adapter, almost all R-mount lenses. R-lenses support an optional electronic viewfinder. The camera uses a MAESTRO image/video processor which is based on the Fujitsu Milbeaut. It is sealed against dust and water spray. Reception The Leica M camera was introduced at the photokina event in Cologne, Germany on 17 September 2012. The launch event included a \\"concert by recording artist—and Leica shooter—Seal\\". In 2019, with the release of a new firmware update the Leica M (Typ 240) was discontinued. Leica M-P (Typ 240) The Leica M-P (Typ 240) was announced on 21 August 2014 under the slogan the 'Perfect understatement', the camera was released by Leica two years following the Leica M (Typ 240). Featuring a full-frame 24MP CMOS sensor and 2GB of built-in RAM, Leica claims that the new M-P digital is 'twice as fast' as the standard M (Typ 240). It also features weather-sealing for protection against water and dust, its rear LCD is covered in sapphire crystal glass. The camera was released with the initial price of $7950, a $1000 more than the standard M (Typ 240). The design of the Leica M-P was based on that of the 35 mm film Leica MP released in 2003. It harks back to the 1950s and the first M mount camera; the Leica M3. The M-P omits the Leica red dot and replaces it with a minimal Leica script logo on the top plate.

The main part of the museum is housed in the engine house of the former Dunedin Gasworks in Braemar Street, close to Cargill's Corner, which operated from 1863 until 1987. Other buildings which are included in the museum include the boiler room, boiler house, chimney stack, fitting shop, and blacksmith's shop. The museum includes a unique collection of five stationary steam engines, at least some of which are in working full order. There are also displays of domestic and industrial gas appliances. As well as being an operating museum open to the public, the gasworks museum is also a popular venue for event ranging from music performances to gatherings of steampunk enthusiasts. The Dunedin Gasworks were the first in New Zealand and also the last to cease production. At its peak in the 1970s coal gas was provided to over 18,000 customers in the city. The Edwardian buildings of the gasworks were saved by a trust headed by Elizabeth Hinds, Director of the Otago Settlers Museum,Dunedin City Council gasworks museum webpage and several are now listed by the New Zealand Historic Places Trust as Category I Historic Places. Much of Dunedin's gasworks facility was pulled down during the 1980s. The idea of restoring the remaining part of the complex into a museum was mooted during the latter part of the decade, with the first work on structural restoration of the buildings beginning in 1989. The museum was opened on 3 February 2001 in a ceremony attended by Dr. George Emerson, Chair of the Dunedin Gasworks Museum Trust, and Sir Neil Cossons, Chairman of English Heritage.

He had homes in America, France and England. He died from cancer at his home in New York on May 20, 1994, three months before his eightieth birthday.  Background  Pratt was born in Islip, New York. His mother, Beatrice, was the granddaughter of the Standard Oil magnate Henry Huttleston Rogers (1840-1909). His father, Alex, and mother divorced when Dallas was three years old. His sister, Cynthia, was two years his senior. Standard Oil (now Exxon) was founded with J.D. Rockefeller. Dallas inherited a share of this wealth and also the family tradition of public benefaction on a grand scale. He felt that this helped justify great inequalities of wealth, though he knew that not everybody necessarily shared this view. His unusual name came from his ancestor, Alexander James Dallas, who was Secretary of the US Treasury under President James Madison, and after whom Dallas, Texas was named.  Education  He attended Buckley School, Aiken Preparatory School in South Carolina (1924-1927), and St. Paul's School, Concord, New Hampshire (1927-1932). On graduating from Yale University, where he majored in English, in 1936, he took a year off and travelled throughout Europe and Asia studying art and architecture. In 1937 in England, he met the British Quaker John Judkyn (1913-1963) who became his life partner and co-founder of the American Museum. On his return Dallas attended Columbia University and Bellevue Hospital, New York and qualified as a physician and a psychiatrist. It was as a psychiatrist that he served in the US Army Medical Corps during World War II and later continued to practise on the staff of Columbia University, counselling foreign students, and at St. Luke's Hospital, New York. Pratt retained links with Columbia University acting as editor and contributor to Columbia Library Columns for 30 years.  Animal welfare  Dr Pratt's lifelong affection for animals developed into a passionate concern for their welfare, but, ever the moderate, he attempted to persuade rather than harangue the public and scientific establishment. In 1969 he established Argus Archives, the purpose of which was to disseminate information on the plight of animals, particularly in slaughterhouses and laboratories. He wrote and published two books on animal experiments in the US, the first a survey, the second suggesting alternative, less painful techniques. His commitment to animal welfare earned him the Albert Schweitzer medal, presented to him at the White House in 1981, and the Annual Award from the New York Humane Society. Argus Archives later changed its name to The Two Mauds, named after Maud Duke, his childhood governess, and Maud Pratt, his Scots terrier.  Collector  From boyhood Dallas Pratt was a collector, one of his first prized items being a life mask of John Keats that he persuaded his grandfather to give him – he later recalled how he ran from the room clutching the mask lest his grandfather, William Evarts Benjamin, change his mind. Dallas recalled: “When I started my own Keats collection in the 1930s, grandfather kept saying that someday he would give me the mask. For several years he tantalised me with this remark, but the gift never materialised. Finally when I was telling him about a Keats manuscript I had recently acquired from A.S.W. Rosenbach – 31 lines from the first draft of ‘I stood tip-toe upon a little hill’ – he said, ‘I really must give you that mask.’ He went off on another tack but before he had finished the sentence I marched into the dressing-room, lifted the mask from the wall, and with much feeling thanked him for the wonderful gift. He didn't explode, but he was surely taken aback by this act of bravado on the part of his habitually meek grandson. Still, as all collectors know, great acquisition can often only be won by heroic measures (usually financial!).” = Literary collection = Pratt’s collection of books, manuscripts and literary items was formed in the 1930s. In 1971 he presented most of his collection of Keats memorabilia to the Keats-Shelley Memorial House in Rome. = Map collection (The Dallas Pratt Collection of Historical Maps) = At the age of eighteen, Pratt bought his first antique maps from a bookstall on the left bank of the Seine in Paris. “My eye was caught,” he wrote, “by three colourful maps. One was of the world, with fat-cheeked wind-puffers, one of the western hemisphere with a cannibal’s ‘lunch’ dangling from a Brazilian woodpile, and the third depicted an upside-down Europe with south at the top. Who could resist?” In 1988 he gave his collection of 200 maps to the American Museum and designed the Map Room to exhibit the maps and related material dating mostly from the Renaissance and Age of Discovery. = The Compassionate Eye = This collection, which grew out of Pratt’s concern for animal welfare, was begun in the 1980s. It consists of 150 prints depicting the sympathetic relationship between human beings and animals. It was displayed in its entirety for the first time in 2012 at the American Museum; The Compassionate Eye – Birds and Beats from the American Museum’s Print Collection (10 March – 1 July) curated by Laura Beresford. Pratt also had literary interests: he kept a journal from his early years, published two books of poetry and two pioneering studies Painful Experiments on Animals (1976) and Alternatives to Pain in Experiments on Animals (1980).  The American Museum in Britain  In the 1950s Pratt and his partner John Judkyn became aware “that the media has helped to produce a distorted conception of the transatlantic experience and that the treatment of American history in British textbooks had tended to be scant and unbalanced. They had long regretted that no museum in Europe presented an authentic picture of American culture. They decided to remedy this.” Whilst touring museum-restorations in country settings in New England, such as Winterthur, Dallas and John had the idea of creating a similar museum in Britain. “At this stage”, Dallas wrote, “my desire was simply to share with the British the aesthetic charm of early American furniture and decorative art and their historical background. John added a concern of his own: to inform the British of the outstanding achievements in these arts and crafts … There is a shade of difference here between myself as prospective museum exhibitor and John as educator and promoter of Anglo-American understanding. Both motivations merged in the outcome.” The American Museum in Britain is housed in Claverton Manor, on the outskirts of Bath. The museum opened to the public in July 1961 and in 2011 celebrated its 50th-anniversary with an exhibition of Marilyn Monroe’s dresses and artefacts from the David Gainsborough Roberts’ Collection.

It won the award for Best Israeli Brewery at the competition. History Archeological evidence has indicated that beer was produced in the Golan Heights in ancient times. The Golan Brewery, founded in late 2006 by Naftali Pinchevsky and Haim Ohayon, was established with a mind to reviving the region's ancient tradition. Years earlier Pinchevsky was importing homebrewing kits to Israel, but he was ahead of his time and the idea did not catch on. He later established Murphy's bars in Herzliya and Modi'in. Ohayon, a land developer who co-founded nearby Kanaf and who has also invested in the Hapoel Gilboa Galil basketball club and in a local genetics startup, says he is driven by a determination to demonstrate that \\"even though we are far from the center of the country, we will do it best.\\" In 2009 the Golan Brewery entered into a strategic collaboration agreement with the Golan Heights Winery, the latter investing () in the venture. Ohayon envisioned the joining of forces between the two entities as a vehicle for growing his brewery into the third largest in Israel. In 2012 the Golan Brewery was ranked seventh on a list of Israel's top ten microbreweries. Brewery The premises of the Golan Brewery include the brewery itself, a brewpub and a visitor center. The brewpub is frequented by United Nations forces. Visitors can tour the brewery and view the brewing vats, cooling chambers and bottling area. German freelance brewmaster Nikolaus Starkmeth, a former cinematographer, was with the Golan Brewery since its establishment. He was replaced by Omri Zilberman in 2011. The brewery shuts down for the Passover holiday. Its vats are made of copper. Prior to the Golan Brewery's collaboration agreement with the Golan Heights Winery in 2009, its yearly output was 150,000 bottles per year and the beer had a shelf life of only a few days. As of 2012, the brewery produces 130,000 liters per year. The Golan Brewery's beers were featured at the third beer festival in Haifa in 2010. In 2010 the Golan Brewery opened the Golan Brewery Express in downtown Jerusalem for local distribution of its beers on tap. At the competition in Ramat Gan, the Golan Brewery won the award for Best Israeli Brewery. National supermarket chain Tiv Ta'am is among the distributors of the Golan Brewery's beers as of 2012. Beers In 2007 the Golan Brewery produced four varieties of non-pasteurized German purity law-compliant beer using water from local springs: a German-style wheat beer, a barley lager, a red lager, and a dark lager. The brewery imported its raw hops and malt from Germany and the yeast from Belgium.

She is both the weekly food columnist of Refika’nın Mutfağı (Refika’s Kitchen) for Turkey's Hürriyet Daily News newspaper as well as the cooking program host of Mucize Lezzetler (Miracle Tastes). In 2010, Birgül published her first bilingual cookbook Refika’nın Mutfağı/Cooking New Istanbul Style.  Early life  Refika was born in Istanbul into a large family dominated by medical professionals. Her mother is a native of Cyprus, and her father a native of Nevşehir. Refika was diagnosed with dyslexia at a young age, making learning how to read and write a challenge; however, she exhibited a talent for adding large sums in her head, leading to a lifelong passion for mathematics (alongside black-and-white photography). Refika completed her undergraduate studies at Robert College, and has since studied psychology at Koç University and leadership education at London Business School.  Work experience  While she was working at Yavuz Turgul’s advertising agency Medina Turgul, she decided to leave the school for her dream of being an advertiser. Because of the Istanbul earthquake, she changed her mind and started her own business on VoIP (voice over internet protocol) and earned her bread for the first time. After graduation, she worked at IF Istanbul Independent Film Festival and at the organization department of Istanbul Foundation for Culture and Arts (IKSV). And after that, she worked as a senior executive and general manager in private Doğan Hospital for five and a half years.  Relationship with the Kitchen  Her relationship with kitchen started with making foamy Turkish coffee to the whole family when she was as tall as the oven. She learned the Mediterranean cuisine from her Cypriot mother, aunt and uncles and Central Anatolia cuisine from her father, grandfather, father’s sister and aunts-in-law, who are from Nevşehir. Her palate got better during her visits to her relatives in London. She always looks for different things and when she cannot find any, she wants to do it herself. She tried to figure out the algorithm of foods with her love of mathematics. In one of her interviews, she said \\"I believe that some people are born to love. I am one of them. In fact, cooking is a simplistic realisation of the act of showing this love\\". The fact that she thinks that even a nice view can be made edible is an indication of this passion of hers.  Refika’s Kitchen Studio  Refika lives in Kuzguncuk neighbourhood of Istanbul. Upon the publication of her book, she needed a studio that suits this spirit. Therefore she initiated a long-term renovation in the building that has been idle for 30 years and was built by the Greek architect Simotas in Kuzguncuk. So she created her own dream kitchen studio with the name Refika’nın Mutfağı that hosts different points of view and occupation groups in each square meter of it, and in which people younger than 35 years old are employed and which is just like a nest for the people, who started up their first business thanks to dedication and hard work. Today, people from different occupational groups such as architects, lawyers, advertisers, dancers, tailors and sculptors work together and enjoy a pleasant and collective life in the building.  TV show  In October 2011, she started presenting the show Mucize Lezzetler, which was sponsored by Arcelik in her kitchen studio in Kuzguncuk. The show is being broadcast on the weekends on NTV, which is one of the most important national TV channels of Turkey. The facts that each show has a different concept, and that the Turkish cuisine is used in a local and natural way without any limitations make it stand out among other food shows. Refika, whose greatest dream -with her own words- is \\"to see a French person making lahmacun in her/his house\\", continues to create new recipes by conserving the traditions of the culture of Turkish cuisine and also to push the envelope. She is sharing recipes on food and life.

Previously, she was deputy political director in the Clinton White House, and served as field director of the Democratic Leadership Council.  Early life and education  Moore was born in Texas, and graduated from the University of Texas at Austin in 1984. During school she worked for the Lloyd Doggett 1984 campaign for the United States Senate.  Career  = Early years and Clinton administration = After graduation, Moore moved to Washington, D.C. and continued working with political campaigns, joining the staff of Dick Gephardt's 1988 presidential bid. She later joined the Democratic Leadership Council, a center-left organization that promoted the ideals of the New Democrats and backed Bill Clinton in the 1992 presidential election. She became the field director, turning it into the policy and political backbone of the Clinton campaign. Moore served in the White House during both terms of the Clinton Administration. She initially served as a special assistant to the President, a styling given to tertiary staffers. During the second term, she became deputy assistant to the President, a second-level staff position, and also served in the second term as the deputy political director in the Office of Political Affairs. Moore took a leave in the fall of 1996 to serve as deputy political director for the Clinton-Gore reelection campaign. = Post- White House and TechNet = In 2001, following her tenure in the White House, Moore joined the staff of Indiana senator Evan Bayh, at the time a leading force for moderate and centrist democrats, serving as his senior advisor until 2011. Her influence in that capacity extended to both his political dealings in Congress and his chairmanship of the Democratic Leadership Council. She was recruited by John Kerry's 2004 presidential campaign to serve as political director for John Edwards, Kerry's running mate. In 2008, she was brought on to Hillary Clinton's campaign as a senior advisor and director of congressional affairs. In the fall of 2011, Moore was named a resident fellow at Harvard Institute of Politics (IOP), where she led a weekly seminar on the decline of centrists and the increase of polarization in both parties and its impact on policy and politics. Moore then served on Harvard IOP's Fellows Alumni Advisory Council. In March 2012, Moore was appointed by then-Secretary of State Hillary Clinton to the U.S. National Commission for the United Nations Education, Science and Cultural Organization (UNESCO). In February 2014, Moore was named president and CEO of TechNet, a technology based advocacy group backing the interests of companies such as Microsoft, Google, and Apple. In May 2014, Moore was named to the board of the Women's High-Tech Coalition, a non-partisan organization of women technology executives. In 2015, she was included in FedScoop's list of Top 50 Women in Technology. In 2016, Wired listed her as one of a new class of tech insiders in the political elite with great influence in the 2016 presidential election. Moore is an advocate of increasing women's access to and representation in STEM related fields, and has written that the acceptance and inclusion of computer science in secondary schooling curricula is integral in maintaining the United States' competitiveness, as well as ensuring that such curricula are open and available to women and other demographics that remain underrepresented in those fields.

Founded more than 30 years ago, it is continental Europe's largest English-speaking theatre. Each season, more than 60,000 patrons visits its wide range of classics, comedies, thrillers and musicals. In terms of its audience, 70 percent are native German speakers and 30 percent are from the extensive English-speaking community at home in and around Frankfurt. The English Theatre, stadt-frankfurt.de  History  Hamburger Allee 45 1981–1990 venue of the theatre 1979 Frankfurt's first English-language theatre is founded in Sachsenhausen by Kevin Oakes from South Africa and Jon Johnson, Mary Jackson and Ken Elrod from the United States. Kevin Oakes becomes the theatre's artistic director. The ensemble is called cardboard clowns. 1980 Judith Rosenbauer joins the ensemble as an actress and later on becomes its managing director. Shortly thereafter the ensemble disbands. Judith Rosenbauer, Darryl Lockwood and Keith LeFevre continue its activities under the name “Café Theater.” 1981 The theatre moves from Sachsenhausen into a larger space in the Hamburger Allee and is now called “English Theater Frankfurt, Café Theater.” 1990 Thanks to its growing popularity under Judith Rosenbauer's direction, the theatre again relocates and is now housed in a 230-seat facility in Frankfurt's famous Kaiserstraße. 1992, the English Theatre in Frankfurt became the first German theatre to stage a play by August Wilson (\\"Fences\\").Thomas Leuchtenmüller: Die Macht der Vergangenheit. Einführung in Leben und Werk August Wilsons. Königshausen & Neumann: Würzburg 1997, p. 3 and p. XIV. 2001 The Kaiserstrasse is now too small for the English Theatre's growing programme. Thanks to Judith Rosenbauer's initiative and Dr. von Harbou's far-sighted vision, the Dresdner Bank agrees to include a playhouse in its new Gallileo skyscraper. Unfortunately, as a result of economic difficulties, the “English Theater e.V.” must close its doors. Judith Rosenbauer terminates her involvement with the English Theatre. 2002 To keep the tradition of English-language theatre in Frankfurt alive, The English Theatre, a limited charity, is founded. Daniel John Nicolai becomes artistic and executive director of the new organization, which begins co-producing with other theatres in Vienna, Los Angeles and New Jersey. 2003 The English Theatre GmbH moves into its new 300-seat home, sponsored by the Dresdner Bank (now Commerzbank).Location in Gallileo skycraperEntry about Gallileo and the theatre  Productions  Each season the theatre produces a mixture of classics, comedies, thrillers, and contemporary plays as well as musicals. The casting Mandy Actors and rehearsal of the theatre's own productions are held in London or New York. The theatre has produced over a 190 productions including German premiere of musicals Spring Awakening Frankfurter Rundschau -Spring Awakening (Duncan Sheik and Steven Sater), The Full Monty The Full Monty (Terence McNally and David Yazbek) and the South African musical Kat and the Kings (David Kramer and Taliep Peterson) and upcoming Ghost the Musical by Bruce Joel Rubin, Dave Stewart and Glen Ballard. Plays which have had their German premieres at the English Theatre include Fences by August Wilson, Killer Joe by Tracy Letts, Someone Who'll Watch Over Me by Frank McGuinness, Proof by David Auburn, Life After George by Hannie Rayson, A Picasso by Jefrey Hatcher, The Dead Guy by Eric Colbe and Good People (play) by David Lindsay- Abaire. The majority of the actors come from English speaking countries. Directors work on a free-lance basis, and like actors, are chosen for a specific play. For each production a new group of actors is assembled. For these purposes the theatre has an casting agent and stage manager based in London. Rehearsals take place in London, then continue on stage in Frankfurt shortly before the premiere. The only German actress who had her stage début at The English Theatre Frankfurt was the moderator Sonya Kraus, playing a German Nazi agent in the play \\"A Picasso\\", directed by Gareth Armstrong in 2007/2008.

Cowan was an early investor in Broken Hill Proprietary Company Ltd. The property associated with Erindale, Cowan's residence at Burnside, was sub-divided after his death into a new suburb which was also named Erindale.  Early life  Cowan who was born in County Tyrone, Ireland (now Northern Ireland), was the third son of John Cowan, a ploughman and shepherd, and his wife Margaret, née Lammey. Cowan, his parents and four other siblings immigrated to South Australia (SA), arriving in Adelaide on 3 August 1852.'The ship Epaminanados', The Ships List at , retrieved 26 August 2012. The family initially settled in North Adelaide where Cowan attended the North Adelaide Grammar School. When he reached the age of 14, he left to assist with his father's businesses in Two Wells (39 km north of Adelaide).  Business career  After starting his working life as a farmer, grazier and machinist in the mid-1860s, Cowan began a career as a flour miller. He later purchased the Two Wells mill and later expanded his operations to include mills at Gladstone, Quorn, Mallala and Allendale and wharfs at Port Pirie and Port Augusta. He later merged all of these assets with those of others to form the South Australian Milling Company in which he was a major shareholder. The economic depression that affected South Australia in the early 1880s forced Cowan to assign his estate. About 1885, his fortunes improved when he became one of the early investors in the Broken Hill Proprietary Company Ltd via the agency of his wife's brothers-in- law, W. R. Wilson and S. Wilson. He was able to resume investing with a focus on agriculture and mining. At the time of his death, his portfolio included J. Hill & Company (coaching), the Australian Refining and Smelting Company, the Hamley Copper Mining Company, the Moonta and Wallaroo Copper Mining Company, the Bridgeport Coal Company, the General Electric Supply Company of Australia, Ballarat Tramway Company as well as a number of farms and other property holdings.  Political career  Cowan had considered requests to stand for election to parliament at the two previous general elections. When the 1890 election was announced, Cowan nominated for the Electorate District of Yatala whose previous members included his eldest brother, Thomas. On 23 April 1890, he and William Gilbert were elected to the two vacancies for Yatala. Just after 5.00 pm on 21 July 1890, Cowan and his fellow passenger, Mark Bullimore, the local branch manager of the General Electric Supply Company of Australia, were both killed when a train collided with his horse-drawn buggy at the intersection of Grand Junction Road and the main railway line running north from Adelaide in the suburb of Dry Creek. His funeral at Payneham on 23 July 1890 was attended by a large number of mourners including his extended family, friends and business associates, and members from both houses of the South Australian Parliament. The vacancy in Yatala caused by Cowan's death was filled by Richard Butler who had unsuccessfully stood earlier in 1890.'The General Elections', Burra Record, Friday 25 April 1890, page 3, , retrieved 12/10/2010.'Terrible railway accident, A public man killed, Death of Mr J.

They had eight children including Darcy Rivers Warren Cowan, who is notable as a medical practitioner, and Gladys Rosalind Lewis, OBE who is notable both for her marriage to Essington Lewis and her community service. After his death, Cowan's widow and eight children remained at the property in the Adelaide suburb of Burnside that he had purchased in 1889 and had renamed Erindale.

In: An investor’s guide to the gold market, European Edition, p. 46, December 2011 By acquiring vaulted gold, institutional or private investors obtain outright ownership of physical gold. In contrast to the traditional purchase of gold bars or gold coins, an investor who buys vaulted gold also acquires physical gold ownership, but does not hold the gold in his or her own hands. Vaulted gold comes with withdrawal or delivery options, i.e., investors can request delivery of their holdings or pick up holdings directly from the vault. Providers of vaulted gold may charge fees for withdrawal or delivery. In practice, only a small percentage of investors request delivery or withdrawal of vaulted gold holdings.  Differentiation of vaulted gold and other forms of investing in gold  Unlike exchange-traded funds or commodities, in the case of vaulted gold no financial instrument or security is put between the investor and the physical gold. Buyers of vaulted gold acquire direct ownership in gold. Buyers of structured products, which are based on the price of gold, acquire a claim against the issuer of the product, but no outright ownership in gold. Exchange traded funds (ETF) or exchange traded commodities (ETC) can be backed by vaulted gold. In legal terms, the position of an owner of such shares with regards to the physical gold is very different from the one of an owner of outright vaulted gold. Bullion banks offer so-called gold accounts. Allocated gold accounts provide investors with full ownership of vaulted gold, while unallocated gold accounts provide investors only with claims against the provider, rather than any outright ownership in gold. Typically, bullion banks do not deal in quantities of less than 1000 oz (about U.S $1.7 million ) in either type of account,World Gold Council: Gold accounts. In: An investor’s guide to the gold market, European Edition, p. 45, December 2011 which means that gold accounts are mainly targeted at institutional or very wealthy private investors.  Background  In recent years, newly emerged providers of vaulted gold have made outright ownership of professionally vaulted gold accessible to private investors. Historically, vaulted gold was primarily offered by wealthy private banks, e.g., Swiss private banks, in the form of gold accounts. However, in recent years, new providers—including both banks and non-banks (e.g., precious metals traders)—have started to offer vaulted gold or savings plans based on vaulted gold to private investors. For example, some of the first gold accumulation plans were introduced by the precious metals trading company Tanaka Kikinzoku Kogyo during the 1980s.Song, Yasumasa: Japanese Young Boost Gold Buying Amid Recession, Retailer Says. Bloomberg vom 22. März 2009 In addition to classical banks and precious metals traders, new online providers like direct banks or non-banks have started offering vaulted gold products to investors. These providers include Everbank in the United States, BullionVault in Great Britain, GoldMoney in the British Channel Islands and GoldRepublic in the Netherlands, among others.  Characteristics  With the purchase of vaulted gold, investors acquire outright ownership of physical gold. Depending on the specific product features, investors either obtain partial or pooled ownership of large gold bars or whole ownership of bars or coins. Vaulted gold, which is stored in high-security vaults, is typically insured and more safely stored than at home or in a safe deposit box.Bankrate.com: Insurance considerations for items in a safe-deposit box. http://www.bankrate.com/brm/news/insur/20030117a.asp, Retrieved 31-07-2013 Varying by provider, the minimum investment amounts can be as low as for one gram of gold. This makes professional vaulted gold accessible to small private investors. Unlike the direct purchase of gold bars or gold coins, which require private storage or safe-deposit-boxes, the purchase of vaulted gold requires no care for transport or storage on the part of the investor. In most countries, only weak regulations apply for physical gold as well as vaulted gold, and vaulted gold does not qualify as a financial instrument in the legal sense. However, in the Netherlands, professionally vaulted gold is treated as an ‘Investment Object’ and therefore falls under the regulation of the Netherlands Authority for the Financial Markets (AFM).GoldMoney closing all Dutch accounts - Digital Gold Currency Magazine in Digital Gold Currency Magazine vom 28. September 2011  Costs  Investors who purchase vaulted gold must typically bear the following costs: # Commissions or fees for the purchase or sale of gold; # Mark-ups and mark-downs for the purchase and sale of bars or coins compared to the (wholesale) market price of gold (resulting from the so-called spread ); # Fees for the custody by the provider, primarily for storage and insurance; # Costs for optional delivery or pickup. Depending on the product features, the purchase of vaulted gold can be cheaper than the purchase of gold bullion from classical precious metals traders due to aggregated procurement volumes and larger bar sizes that imply lower mark-ups. However, prices for vaulted gold can differ significantly across providers.  Risks  In addition to the market price risk of gold as an investment, buyers of vaulted gold bear a liquidity risk, which can vary significantly by provider and product features. Furthermore, investors bear the potential risk that gold holdings are embezzled by a provider, custodian, or individual, or stolen by third parties. According to the World Gold Council, investors should check that “providers of vaulted gold services are offering outright, unencumbered gold ownership, do not lease any gold without prior approval from clients, store the gold with an independent and accredited vault operator and regularly allow inspections and audits of client gold holdings.\\"cited: World Gold Council: Vaulted gold. In: An investor’s guide to the gold market, European Edition, p. 50-51, December 2011 In addition, the gold should be fully insured against standard risks.  Criticism  There are various critics of fraudulent or overpriced gold investment schemes or inappropriate sales tactics used by some gold dealers or Multi-Level-Marketing companies. As with other unregulated investments, some dubious providers push overpriced gold savings schemes into the market through scare and high pressure sales tactics.

Royal corgis were the Pembroke Welsh Corgi dogs owned by Queen Elizabeth II and her parents, King George VI and Queen Elizabeth The Queen Mother. Fond of corgis since she was a small child, Elizabeth II has owned more than 30 corgis since she became Queen of the Commonwealth realms in 1952. Elizabeth II owned at least one Corgi at any given time between the years 1933-2018. In 2007, Elizabeth II had five corgis: Monty, Emma, Linnet, Willow, and Holly; five cocker spaniels: Bisto, Oxo, Flash, Spick, and Span; and four dorgis (dachshund-corgi crossbreeds): Cider, Berry, Vulcan, and Candy. Monty, Willow, and Holly appeared in the 2012 Olympic opening ceremony when, in a sketch, Daniel Craig (in character as James Bond) arrived at Buckingham Palace to escort the Queen to the event. Monty had previously belonged to the Queen Mother, and died in September 2012. It was reported in 2015 that the Queen stopped breeding corgis so as not to leave any behind when she died. Her final corgi, Willow, died in April of 2018. Two extant , Vulcan and Candy, remain. The royal corgis were globally publicized (such as in the cover photo and feature article of Vanity Fair's Summer 2016 edition). Leaving a lasting legacy after death, they have been depicted and immortalized in various artwork, such as statues, professional photographs, and paintings. For instance, the crown coin commemorating the Golden Jubilee of Elizabeth II depicts the Queen with a corgi. As another example, Elizabeth II is portrayed by Helen Mirren as owning several Corgis during 1997 (the year of Diana's death), in the 2006 film The Queen. History The first three generations from Susan. The Queen has been very fond of corgis since she was a small child, having fallen in love with the corgis owned by the children of the Marquess of Bath. King George VI brought home Dookie in 1933. A photograph from George VI's photo album shows a ten-year-old Princess Elizabeth (later Queen Elizabeth II) with Dookie at Balmoral. Elizabeth and her sister Princess Margaret would feed Dookie by hand from a dish held by a footman. The other early favorite corgi during the same time was Jane. Elizabeth II's mother, at that time Queen Elizabeth, introduced a disciplined regimen for the dogs; each was to have its own wicker basket, raised above the floor to avoid drafts. Meals were served for each dog in its own dish, the diet approved by veterinary experts with no tidbits from the royal table. A proprietary brand of meat dog biscuits was served in the morning, while the late afternoon meal consisted of dog meal with gravy. Extra biscuits were handed out for celebrations and rewards. Crackers (24 December 1939, Windsor – November, 1953) was one of the Queen Mother's corgis, and nearly a constant companion; he retired with the Queen Mother to the Castle of Mey in Scotland. In 1944, Elizabeth was given Susan as a gift on her 18th birthday. Susan accompanied Elizabeth on her honeymoon in 1947. The corgis owned by the Queen are descended from Susan. Rozavel Sue, daughter of Rozavel Lucky Strike, an international champion, was one of the Queen's corgis in the early 1950s. The Queen has owned over thirty corgis since her accession in 1952. When Elizabeth and Prince Philip visited Grand Cayman in 1983, government officials gave her black coral sculptures of a corgi and a horse as a gift, both made by Bernard Passman. Domestic life Sugar was the nursery pet of Prince Charles and Princess Anne. In 1955, her dogs, Whisky and Sherry, were surprise Christmas gifts from the Queen to the Prince and Princess. Pictured with the royal family, the corgi Sugar made the cover of The Australian Women's Weekly on 10 June 1959. Sugar's twin, Honey, belonged to the Queen Mother; Honey took midday runs with Johnny and Pippin, Princess Margaret's corgis, while the Princess lived in Buckingham Palace. Heather was born in 1962 and became one of the Queen's favourites. Heather was the mother of Tiny, Bushy, and Foxy; Foxy gave birth to Brush in 1969. The corgis enjoyed a privileged life in Buckingham Palace. They resided in bespoke room devoted to their habitation, known as the Corgi Room, and slept in elevated wicker baskets. The Queen tended to the corgis in her kennel herself. She also chose the sires of litters that were bred in her kennel. The corgis had an extensive menu at the palace which included fresh rabbit and beef, served by a gourmet chef. At Christmas, the Queen made stockings for pets full of toys and delicacies such as biscuits. In 1999, one of Queen Elizabeth's royal footmen was demoted from Buckingham Palace for his \\"party trick of pouring booze into the corgis' food and water\\" and watching them \\"staggering about\\" with relish. In 2007, the Queen was noted to have five corgis, Monty, Emma, Linnet, Willow, and Holly; five cocker spaniels, Bisto, Oxo, Flash, Spick, and Span; and four \\"dorgis\\" (dachshund-corgi crossbreeds), Cider, Berry, Vulcan, and Candy. In 2012, Queen Elizabeth II's corgis Monty, Willow, and Holly appeared during the brief James Bond sketch when Daniel Craig arrived at Buckingham Palace for a mission to take the queen to the 2012 Summer Olympics opening ceremony. Monty, who had previously belonged to the Queen Mother, and one of her \\"Dorgis\\" died in September 2012. Monty had been named for the horse whisperer and friend of the queen, Monty Roberts. In November 2012, it was reported that Elizabeth owns two corgis, Willow and Holly, and two Dorgis, Candy and Vulcan. It was reported in July 2015 that the Queen has stopped breeding corgis as she does not wish any to survive her in the event of her death. Monty Roberts had urged Elizabeth to breed more corgis in 2012 but she had told him that she \\"didn't want to leave any young dog behind\\" and wanted to put an end to the practice. As of April 2018, with the death of Willow, the Queen no longer has any full- bred corgis. Only two dorgis, Vulcan and Candy, are still alive. The dogs have traditionally been buried at the royal residence, Sandringham estate in Norfolk, at which they died. The graveyard was first used by Queen Victoria when her Collie, Noble, died in 1887. In 1959, the Queen used it to bury Susan, creating a cemetery for her pets. However, Monty was buried in Balmoral estate. Injuries On several occasions, the Queen or her staff have been injured by the corgis. In 1954, the Royal Clockwinder, Leonard Hubbard, was bitten by Susan upon entering the nursery at the Royal Lodge, Windsor. Later in the same year, one of the Queen Mother's corgis bit a policeman on guard duty in London. In 1968, Peter Doig called for the royal staff to put up a \\"Beware of the dog\\" sign at Balmoral after one of the corgis bit the postman. In February 1989, it was reported that the royal family had hired an animal psychologist to tame the dogs after they developed a habit of nipping them and the staff. \\"And in 1989, the Queen Mother’s dog, Ranger, led a pack of corgis that attacked and killed the Queen’s beloved dorgi, Chipper.\\" In March 1991, the Queen was bitten after trying to break up a fight between ten or so of her corgis. She had to have three stitches to her left hand. John Collins, the Queen Mother's chauffeur, had to have a tetanus injection after he also tried to intervene. In 2003, Pharos, a tenth-generation offspring of Susan, was put down after being mauled by Princess Anne's English bull terrier Dottie. Anne arrived at Sandringham to visit her mother for Christmas and the corgis rushed out of the front door as they arrived. It was reported that \\"Dottie went for Pharos, savaging the corgi's hind legs and breaking one in three places.\\" Influence The royal corgis are known all across the world and are closely associated with the Queen. The corgis have had numerous items dedicated to them, in particular being the subject of many statues and works of art. Because of the Queen's fondness for the Welsh Corgi, an increased number of corgis were exhibited in the 1954 West Australian Canine Association's Royal Show. Queen Elizabeth II’s crown coin KM# 1135, made of copper nickel of size 33 mm, issued during her Golden Jubilee year, shows the Queen with a corgi. Cartoonist Carl Giles included the corgis in every cartoon he drew of the Queen after 1962. The pets are the subject of an animated comedy film by Belgian studio nWave Pictures, called The Queen's Corgi, which was released in the UK in July 2019.

It was established in response to Chile’s new demographic scenario characterised by an increase in life expectancy and the growth of senior citizen population, adding on yet another challenge for the government in terms of greater future retirement expenditures and the need to guarantee basic solidarity pensions to those who were not able to save enough for their retirement. At the end of July 2007, the PRF had a total of $1.37 billion worth of assets under its management. History In 2006, Chile passed the Fiscal Responsibility Law which would involve the creation of two new sovereign wealth funds, the first of which was the Pension Reserve Fund. Its primary purpose was to provide funding for the government’s pension obligations and help pay for the projected increase in the minimum pension benefit and take-up rate.

The base hosted British, American and Tongan military personnel at the time of the attack. The Taliban fighters killed two U.S. Marines and destroyed or severely damaged eight U.S. Marine Corps AV-8B Harriers and a United States Air Force C-130 before the entire raiding force was killed or captured. The Taliban claimed that the raid was in response to the film, Innocence of Muslims, and have also stated that Prince Harry, who was stationed at the base at the time, was the target of the attack. To replace the aircraft lost in the attack, the USMC deployed 14 Harriers to Afghanistan 36 hours after the raid. The raid The raid was a complex and coordinated assault by 15 Taliban fighters,More details in this article, 'Camp Bastion Attack revealed High Level- Complacentcy' (accessed 16 April 2014) wearing ACU pattern camouflage and using several types of weapons, which took place on the eastern side of Camp Bastion near the US Marine's aircraft hangars at 22:00 local time (17:30 GMT). The assault team penetrated the perimeter of the camp, guarded by troops from the United Kingdom and Tonga, and separated into three teams to carry out the attack.Aikens, Matthieu, \\"Enemy Inside the Wire: The Untold Story of the Battle of Bastion\\", GQ, September 2013, retrieved 6 September 2013. In the weeks preceding the attack, US Marines had sometimes found the Tongan guards sleeping on duty. One team engaged a group of USMC mechanics from VMM-161 who were in the area; the same team also attacked the aircraft refueling stations. Another group attacked the aircraft, and the last group was engaged at the base cryogenics compound. The group that attacked the aircraft attached explosive charges to several jets, then fired rocket-propelled grenades (RPGs) at others.Lamb, Christina, Nicola Smith, and Tim Ripley, \\"Bastion Raid Signals Birth Of Taliban SAS\\", London Sunday Times, 23 September 2012, p. 23 The attackers were killed or captured during a four-hour firefight by US Marines and the No. 51 Squadron RAF Regiment, along with helicopter support supplied by a British Apache AH1, a USMC AH-1W SuperCobra and machine-gun equipped UH-1Y Venoms from the USMC unit HMLA-469, which took off while under fire from the insurgents. The RAF troops, who were located on the opposite side of the huge base, arrived at the scene approximately 12 minutes after the attack began. Some of the pilots and maintainers from Marine Attack Squadron 211 (VMA-211) also fought as infantrymen, killing one attacker and injuring another who was trying to fire an RPG at a group defending the flight line. This was the first time the squadron had fought since the Battle of Wake Island, when most of their planes had been destroyed in a surprise Japanese attack. Marines from VMM-161 killed one group of five Taliban with small arms fire as they tried to advance down the flight line area. A second group of five insurgents was flushed out of hiding hours later and shot by No. 51 Squadron RAF Regiment and USMC forces in a compound near their entry point. The final group of five insurgents was detected near the flight line hours later and four were killed by gunfire from the RAF quick reaction force and orbiting helicopters. The fifth insurgent was injured and captured.Kovach, Gretel C., \\"'Surreal' Attack At Camp Bastion\\", U-T San Diego, 7 October 2012, p. 1 During the early portion of the fighting, the VMA-211 squadron commander, Lieutenant Colonel Christopher Raible, 40, was killed when an anti-personnel rocket propelled grenade struck the side of the building that houses the squadrons work spaces. The rocket struck the side of the building containing the medical section. Lt. Col. Raible, after hearing several explosions outside the building, left his office to investigate when the rocket struck. A piece of shrapnel from the rocket struck him in the neck, causing him to bleed to the point of incapacity before effectively organizing a defense. Killed nearby was USMC mechanic Sergeant Bradley Atwell, 27, while taking cover behind ground support equipment on the flight line. Atwell and Raible were killed by a single RPG round which exploded in the air above them. Seventeen US and UK personnel were injured. Six AV-8B Harrier IIs and a United States Air Force C-130 were destroyed and another two Harriers severely damaged.Aikens, Matthieu, \\"Enemy Inside the Wire: The Untold Story of the Battle of Bastion\\", GQ, September 2013, retrieved 6 September 2013. Three refuelling stations were destroyed and six soft-skin aircraft hangars damaged. Sergeant Atwell Memorial Aftermath The attack was described as \\"the worst loss of U.S. airpower in a single incident since the Vietnam War\\"; the attack caused 200 million USD in damages.The raid on Camp Bastion was a bloody first for some Marine aviators Together, the six destroyed and two damaged Harriers constituted six percent of the USMC's inventory. Normal attrition of the USMC's Harrier jets is around two airframes a year.Brancato, Kevin, and Christine Ryan, \\"Few Options For Replacing Destroyed Harrier Jets\\", Bloomberg Government, 2 October 2012. The Harrier is no longer in production, but is expected to be replaced in the USMC by the F-35 beginning in 2020. To replace the aircraft lost in the attack, the USMC deployed 14 Harriers to Afghanistan within 36 hours of the raid. The Taliban claimed that the raid was in response to the film Innocence of Muslims, and have also stated that Prince Harry, who was stationed at the base at the time, was the target of the attack. The BBC claimed that the attack \\"bore all the hallmarks of the Haqqani network\\". The ISAF claimed a week later that it had captured one of the raid's planners. = USMC response = Marine Major General Charles M. Gurganus was in charge of the base defenses and had reduced the number of Marines patrolling the base perimeter from 325 to 100 one month before the attack. After pressure from the families of those killed or injured in the battle, the US Senate put Gurganus' promotion to Lieutenant General on hold. On 30 September 2013, USMC Commandant James F. Amos announced that he had found Gurganus and USMC Major General Gregg A. Sturdevant to be accountable for failures of the base defenses during the raid. Sturdevant was in charge of USMC aviation assets in that region of Afghanistan. Both were directed to retire from the USMC immediately at their current ranks of Major General.Burns, Robert, Associated Press, \\"Two Marine generals fired in wake of brazen Taliban attack on Camp Bastion\\", Stars and Stripes, 30 September 2013, retrieved 1 October 2013. The Marine Corps stated Gurganus \\"bore final accountability for the lives and equipment under his charge,\\" and he \\"made an error in judgment when conducting his risk assessment of the enemy's capabilities and intentions.\\" Sturdevant, the USMC said, \\"did not adequately assess the force protection situation\\". Both men retired honorably and with full benefits. According to NBC News, a senior U.S. defense official remarked that if Gurganus was not a general he would have faced a court martial, which would have prevented retirement with full benefits. \\"Marines are dead and six aircraft were destroyed. A Lance Corporal would fry for a lot less than that,\\" NBC quoted the official saying. = British response = The British House of Commons Cross-party Defence Committee investigated the incident, and published their report on 16 April 2014. They concluded that \\"only 11 out of 24 guard towers on the base had been manned\\", and that \\"British commanders must bear a degree of responsibility for... systemic failures and associated reputational damage\\". = Tongan response = A September 2013 article in GQ stated that soldiers from the Tongan contingent in Afghanistan had been responsible for the section of the perimeter which was breached, and that US Marines had sometimes found members of the contingent asleep while on guard duty. In October that year the acting commander of the Tongan Armed Forces stated that the Tongan force at Camp Bastion had not been required to fully man the section of Camp Bastion's perimeter through which the attackers passed. The British High Commissioner to Tonga also stated that it was British, and not Tongan, personnel who were responsible for the penetrated section of the perimeter and that allegations which arose from a US Military enquiry claiming that Tongan troops had been caught sleeping while on guard duty were not correct.

It is estimated that in eleven months of activity (from October 1942 to September 1943), the camp hosted about ten thousand prisoners, 159 of whom lost their lives because of the prohibitive conditions of detention. The remains of most of the victims are kept in the Shrine of the Slavs located within the Sansepolcro cemetery. After decades of neglect, recently in the area where the concentration camp lied, the Renicci Memorial Park was built, and annually hosts the celebrations for the Day of Remembrance. History The first deportations to Renicci are dated 10 October 1942, while in December the prisoners were already over 3,800. Between July and August 1943, fascism fell and coincided with the arrival to Renicci of hundreds of political prisoners transferred from Ustica, Ventotene and Ponza. The camp underwent strikes and protests. Soldiers guarding the camp after September 8 deserted the camp in great numbers, fearing the arrival of the Germans. On 14 September 1943 the prisoners without supervision, fled, dispersing to the surrounding areas, almost all of them joining the partisans active in the Apennines between Tuscany and Marche. Among those who died fighting along with partisan sources were Anton Firman, Valentino and Marinko Bordon Dušan, Luka Pelovič, Stefano Recek and Carlo Zimperman. The fate of Jose Skuli and Alois Bukovac remains unknown.

Tamoya ohboya was discovered by a biologist and educator, William Gillan. In order to name the newly discovered species, Coalition on the Public Understanding of Science organized an online competition, which was won by the high school marine biology teacher Lisa Peck, who explained her winning entry saying: \\"I bet ‘Oh Boy’ is the first thing said when a biologist or layman encounters the Bonaire Banded Box Jellyfish.\\" It is the first species of the genus Tamoya to be discovered in over 100 years. The International Institute for Species Exploration included it in a list of Top Ten New Species in 2011. The species was discovered in the waters of the Dutch Caribbean islands (then part of the Netherlands Antilles). There have been roughly 70 confirmed sightings since 1989, approximately 45 of which took place in the waters of Bonaire and the rest off the shores of Mexico, St Lucia, Curacao, Barbados, Honduras and St Vincent. The most closely related species of Tamoya ohboya live in the waters of Brazil and the south- eastern United States of America. It is characterized by a deep stomach, densely spread cnidocysts and banded tentacles whose color ranges from reddish-orange to dark brown. Tamoya ohboya is hard to collect due to its fast swimming and ungregarious nature. Its ecology is still relatively unknown, but it is presumed that it is a daylight predator whose prey includes small crustaceans and fish. Like other box jellyfish, Tamoya ohboya is highly venomous. Since 1989, three people have reported being stung by Tamoya ohboya, which led to intense pain, skin damage and, in one of the cases, hospitalization. Its head is shaped like a plastic bag.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PcraphPLAxY The number of people stung by Tamoya ohboya is likely higher than the three reported above.

Its core units were mechanized infantry battalions. The brigade was founded in, named after, and headquartered in the city of Brescia and accordingly the brigade's coat of arms was modeled after the city's coat of arms.  History  = Constitution = The \\"Brescia\\" Brigade was first formed with the 19th and 20th infantry regiments on 1 November 1859 in Bergamo. Along with the \\"Cremona\\" Brigade in Brescia and the 6th Field Artillery Regiment it formed the 6th Division of the Line. During the Third Italian War of Independence the Brescia was paired with the \\"Valtellina\\" Brigade to form the 5th Division of the Line, which fought in the Battle of Custoza. The brigade participated in the Capture of Rome and then saw service in the Italian colonial wars: the First Italo-Ethiopian War and the Italo-Turkish War. = World War I = During World War I the brigade fought on the Italian Front and was awarded the Military Order of Italy for its conduct during the Eleventh Battle of the Isonzo on the Banjšice Plateau. In 1918 the brigade was sent to the Western Front in France and fought there during the Hundred Days Offensive. At the end of the war the brigade had reached Rimogne. = World War II = In 1926 the brigade received the 16th Infantry Regiment \\"Savona\\" and became the infantry component of the 27th Infantry Division \\"Sila\\". The same year the brigade was renamed as XXVII Infantry Brigade. In 1935-36 the brigade was employed in Ethiopia during the Second Italo-Abyssinian War. In 1939 the brigade lost the 16th Infantry Regiment \\"Savona\\" and was renamed 27th Infantry Division \\"Brescia\\". This binary division consisted of only two infantry regiments (19th and 20th) and the 55th Field Artillery Regiment. The division participated in the Western Desert Campaign, distinguishing itself during the Siege of Tobruk. The division was completely destroyed during the Second Battle of El Alamein. = Cold War = The brigade was reactivated during the Italian Army 1975 reform, with which the regimental level was abolished and battalions came under direct command of newly formed multi-arms brigades. On 21 October 1975 the Infantry Division \\"Legnano\\" was split into the Mechanized Brigade \\"Legnano\\" and the reactivated Mechanized Brigade \\"Brescia\\". The 67th Infantry Regiment \\"Legnano\\" in Montorio Veronese became the core of the reactivated brigade, which was brought to full strength by adding the 13th Tank Battalion \\"M.O. Pascucci\\" in Cordenons from the disbanded 182nd Armored Infantry Regiment \\"Garibaldi\\" of the Infantry Division \\"Folgore\\", the 20th Mechanized Infantry Battalion \\"Monte San Michele\\" in Brescia from the disbanded 68th Infantry Regiment \\"Legnano\\" in Bergamo of the \\"Legnano\\" Division, and the 52nd Self-propelled Field Artillery Group \\"Venaria\\" in Brescia from the disbanded 52nd Heavy Artillery Regiment, which had been part of 3rd Army Corps' Artillery Command. Together with the Mechanized Brigade \\"Isonzo\\" and Armored Brigade \\"Pozzuolo del Friuli\\", the Brescia became part of the Mechanized Division \\"Mantova\\". The Mantova, based in Udine in North-Eastern Italy, was part of the 5th Army Corps, which was tasked with defending the Yugoslav- Italian border against attacks by either the Warsaw Pact, or Yugoslavia, or both. The Brescia's authorized strength was 4,760 men (272 Officers, 630 non- commissioned officers and 3,858 soldiers) and it was initially composed by the following units: * 30px Mechanized Brigade \\"Brescia\\", in Brescia ** Command and Signal Unit \\"Brescia\\", in Brescia ** 25px 20th Mechanized Infantry Battalion \\"Monte San Michele\\", in Brescia ** 25px 30th Mechanized Infantry Battalion \\"Pisa\\", in Montorio Veronese ** 25px 85th Mechanized Infantry Battalion \\"Verona\\", in Montorio Veronese ** 25px 13th Tank Battalion \\"M.O.

The Brescia along with the Mechanized Brigade \\"Trieste\\" came under the 3rd Army Corps. On the same date the 13th Tank Battalion \\"M.O. Pascucci\\" was transferred to the Armored Brigade \\"Ariete\\" and replaced by the 15th Cavalry Reconnaissance Squadrons Group \\"Cavalleggeri di Lodi\\" in Lenta of the disbanded Armored Division \\"Centauro\\". The \\"Cavalleggeri di Lodi\\" was armed with Leopard 1A2 main battle tanks and M113 armored personnel carriers, and was reorganized in 1987 as 15th Tank Squadrons Group \\"Cavalleggeri di Lodi\\". After the end of the Cold War the Italian Army began to draw down its forces and the Brescia was one of the first brigades to be disbanded. On 27 July 1991 the brigade was officially deactivated along with most of its subordinate units.

Biography After studying for six years at the Academy of Fine Arts in Barcelona, Marsal moved to Buenos Aires, where several French, Italian and Spanish artists from sculpture and metal engraving areas became famous. Loritero, beautiful statuette made by Serafin Marsal In 1898, Marsal received the third prize from the National Fine Arts Exhibition of Buenos Aires. In the next year, he accepted an invitation to teach drawing and sculpture in Santa Fé. There, Marsal participated in urban planning, sculpture production and became part of the city artistic and cultural life. One of his sculptures, a bust of the educator called Sarmento, remains in the plaza dedicated to the teacher. In 1901, he became Art Director of the \\"Blanco & Negro\\" magazine. In 1907, at the age of 46 and highly recognized in the artistic field, Marsal moved to Asunción in Paraguay according to medical recommendations, due to the health problems experienced by his wife. In this smaller city, he faced economic difficulties, as orders were rarer. He taught on the Arts School. Even with no orders, Marsal started to produce small clay statues that represented the Paraguayan people with perfection. Paraguayan woman, represented in the figure by Marsal Artworks Made by hand with clay from Picolmayo River, each statuette represented a typical figure of the Paraguayan people with a variety of details and beautiful finishing. Marsal made each figure a mold from which he extracted the essential piece. However, his method was not a multiple-piece system, so the finishing of each piece was made by hand, and one was different from the other. Besides beauty and a careful finishing, his pieces have an important historical value, as they portray typical figures of a period. They are social representations: There is a woman carrying a jar over her head, donkey as a means of transportation, Indian faces, a man that sold fruits, among many others that frequented the Asunción market. In addition, all figures were entitled in Guaraní, the people language. In autobiographical notes, Marsal once wrote: \\"For approximately 18 years I dedicate myself to making little figures in clay. I calculate that perhaps one hundred small figures were created monthly in my house to be sold in North America, fifty thousand to be sold in Central America and South America; in Europe, four or five thousand; in Japan a bit more one thousand, and many others whose destination I ignore\\". To date, what remained from his works, as the used material is quite fragile, belongs to private collections and to the Museo Memoria de la Ciudad, which has a collection of 36 pieces.

Cell–cell fusion is critical for the merging of gamete genomes and the development of organs in multicellular organisms. Cell-cell fusion occurs when both actin cytoskeleton and fusogenic proteins properly rearrange across the cell membrane. This process is lead by actin-propelled membrane protrusions. Identifiers Effects of EFF-1 and AFF-1 on vesicle morphology. EFF-AFF are the identifiers for type 1 glycoproteins that makeup cell–cell fusogens. They were first identified when EFF-1 mutants were found to \\"block cell fusion in all epidermal and vulval epithelia\\" in the roundworm, Caenorhabditis elegans. EFF-AFF is a family of type I membrane glycoproteins that act as cell–cell fusogens, named from Anchor cell fusion failure. Because it was known that EFF-1 mutants successfully fused the anchor cell and (uterine seam) utse syncytium to produce a continuous uterine-vulval tube, where these connections failed, AFF-1 mutants were discovered. AFF-1 was deemed necessary for this process in addition to the fusion of heterologous cells in C. elegans. The transmembrane forms of these proteins, like most viral fusogens, possess an N-terminal signal sequence followed by a long extracellular portion, a predicted transmembrane domain, and a short intracellular tail. \\" A striking conservation in the position and number of all 16 cysteines in the extracellular portion\\" of EFF-AFF proteins from different nematode species suggests that these proteins are folded in a similar 3D structure that is essential for their fusogenic activity. C. elegans AFF-1 and EFF-1 proteins are essential for developmental cell-to-cell fusion and can merge insect cells. \\"Thus FFs comprise an ancient family of cellular fusogens that can promote fusion when expressed on a viral particle.\\"  Process  Cell-cell fusogens are proteins that promote plasma membrane fusion among different cells. To be considered a fusogen, it must be required for fusion, fuse unfamiliar membranes, and be present on the fusing membrane when need be. These cells include but are not limited too: gametes, trophoblasts, epithelial, and other developmental cells. These fusogens mediate cell-cell fusion and can perform neuron repairs, auto-fusion, and sealing of the phagosomes. Although these proteins promote similar functions among cells, they have individual mechanisms. These are called unilateral (one fusing membrane needed to be present) and bilateral (same or different fusogens present at both membranes) mechanisms. Most fusogen mechanisms begin with hemifusion, but the mechanism for cell-cell fusogens consists of four separate steps. = Step = # Cells must identify and be near each other. # Hemifusion occurs. # Fusion pore in hemifusion structure opens, thus allowing for cell contents to merge. # Cells completely join from pore expansion.  Applications  = Roles in gamete fertilization = Cell-cell fusogens have several different applications. These chemical agents can play a significant part in sexual and asexual reproduction by promoting the fusion of the membrane bilayers. With sexual reproduction, evidence found to prove that in mice, some mandatory sperm-egg fusogens are responsible for fusion; two particular proteins were IZUMO1 and CD9. After comparing the data of experiments done with plants, fungi, and invertebrates, it was seen that several crucial genes could have been responsible for fertilization. However, like yeasts, there were no genes found to be adequate for the fertilization process. As of late, another protein has been classified as a gamete fusogen (HAP2 or GCS1). Like the previous example, this protein is present in plants, protists, and invertebrates. This fusogen resembles the eukaryotic somatic fusogen mentioned earlier, EFF-1. The presence of HAP2 induces hemifusion and the mixing of cell content. Yet when considering asexual reproduction, somatic cells can also undergo cell-cell fusion or self-fusion. Two particular fusogens observed were SO and MAK-2. Evidence supports that these proteins control and regulate efficient protein concentration and localization. = Roles in neuronal repair = In the medical field, experiments are done to test for the uses of cell-cell fusogens in axonal nerve repairs and to determine their usefulness with other nerve cells. The current method for nerve repair is suturing the cut ends of nerves. This has a long recovery process, with a low functionality rate for the repaired nerves. When considering cell-cell fusogens as a potential answer, researchers divided these fusogens into two groups based on fusion mechanisms: cell aggregation and membrane modification. One fusogen PEG was found to fit in both groups. It was this fusogen that made restoring nerve cells in humans possible. Once operations were within a certain time frame (12 hours for human nerve repair and 24 hours for sciatic rat treatments), patient recovery was almost successful. With this research, there is potential for repairing human nerve grafts. Some potential uses of cell-cell fusogens studied are cancer vaccines and the regeneration of damaged cells. Additionally, any peripheral nerve in the body could be repaired, and transferred tissues could work as soon as the senses return. Finally, any surgery done on nerves could be repaired as well, thus resulting in a quicker recovery.

She was the Republican candidate for Lieutenant Governor of Delaware in 2012 and unsuccessfully ran for the Republican nomination for State Treasurer of Delaware in 2014. Background Valenzuela married her husband Eli and moved to Delaware in the early 1990s to care for her aging mother in neighboring New Jersey. She is a mother of three sons in a blended family, with Ian from her previous marriage, Simon from her current husband, and Pedro whom they adopted. Her second son, Simon, was diagnosed as autistic and Valenzuela describes the fight to overcome the negative prognosis as one of the reasons she would start her small business. She and her husband are the vice president and president, respectively, of their own small business, First State Manufacturing, an industrial upholstery company based in Milford, Delaware. For her efforts and contributions to the Delaware economy, Valenzuela was awarded the Small Business Administration's Small Businessperson of the Year Award in 2012. First State Manufacturing employs approximately 60 people and provides a variety of goods ranging from seat covers for restaurants, to engine covers for the United States Air Force, to ballistic vests for the Israel Defense Forces. Political career In April 2012, Valenzuela was nominated by the Delaware Republican Party as its candidate for Lieutenant Governor. She ran against incumbent Democrat Matthew Denn and Libertarian challenger Margie Waite-McKeown. On August 28, 2012, Valenzuela spoke at the 2012 Republican National Convention in Tampa, Florida. She spoke that night between fellow Republican women candidates Mia Love, the incumbent mayor of Saratoga Springs, Utah, and nominee for the U.S. House of Representatives in Utah's 2nd congressional district; and Cathy Rodgers, the incumbent U.S. Representative for Washington's 5th congressional district. On November 6, 2012, the 2012 Delaware lieutenant gubernatorial election took place, where Valenzuela lost to incumbent Denn. She received 37.1% of the vote, versus Denn's 61.6%, and only held a lead in Sussex County, failing to receive a majority of votes in Kent County, New Castle County, or the greater Wilmington metropolitan area. Valenzuela, however, did lose by a smaller margin to her opponent than did any of the other statewide Republican candidates in the state. In 2014, Valenzuela ran for State Treasurer of Delaware. She was defeated in the Republican primary by Ken Simpler following a contentious race marked by infighting and with outside spending behind both candidates, who frequently criticized each other.

Different methods are used to collect this data but all identify the ratios of different diatom colonies present in samples and match those samples with locations at the crime scene. Use of diatoms Diatoms are diverse microscopic algae with silica cell walls that have different characteristics such as color, shape, and size. There are 8,000 known species of diatoms (without taking into account the variety of subspecies that have specialized within their specific environments). Diatoms do not have specialized nutrient and water conducting tissues, which affects their dispersion throughout ecosystems. These microscopic organisms mainly inhabit freshwater environments because of their inability to survive with the cleaning agents present in domestic water sources. Benefits of Diatoms Diatoms are identifiable based on each species unique silica cell walls and vary depending on their environment. Because they have determinant properties diatoms create flora profiles for scientists. When these microscopic algae die, their frustules (silica cell walls) becomes a part of the water sediment. The presence of the frustules enables scientists to compare the cell walls of the deceased organisms with the living diatoms to determine characteristics of their environment. In early spring and the fall the ratio of living diatoms to dead diatoms is high, whereas, in summer and winter the amount of dead diatoms outpopulates the living. Based on this known information diatoms can verify the time of year samples were taken. Different types of diatoms can also determine the properties of a samples ecosystem. For example, the higher ratio of periphytic (type of platonic diatom), the higher the vegetation concentration and shallower the water, but the higher the ratio of scaled chrysophytes a sample means the environment of that organism contains more open water. Forensic scientists can create differentiated markers on environments in the area they are collecting data based on the diatoms population growth rate, which is affected by pollutants in their water sources because the simple tissues of diatoms make them sensitive environmental changes. The reason diatoms are a common tool to match water environments is because of the variability of their populations are predictable and constant, the organisms can be identified by using the light microscope, and their silica cell walls allow for preservation. Disadvantages of Diatoms Out of the 771 cases in 2001, only 28% were fresh water drowning. Living diatoms do not inhabit domestic water sources, which limits the situations that diatoms can be used to create flora profiles or time of death estimations. Diatoms can only tell when or where evidence was found in some situations and not the time of death if there is no body fluid sample available to be collected. If a body is placed in freshwater post mortem then diatoms cannot be used to evaluate time of death. Without the inhalation of water and some circulation present in the victim, the diatoms will not be able to enter the alveolar system and blood stream making it difficult to extract a reliable sample. Another issue with the use of diatoms in order to provide evidential support is that diatoms can also be found on clothes, in food and drink, or air. In a study conducted by Spitz and Schneider in 1964, 500 cubic meters of air was filtered for three days in April and there was between 662 and 1564 individual diatoms present on the filtrate. Because the body can preserve these microscopic algae, the presence of diatoms may not only be on a victim or suspect through their relation to a crime scene, which affects the reliability of the results collected from a scene. Diatoms can also be destroyed based on the biological make up of the body it encounters, this could affect the results in a criminal investigation. Diatom testing In order to use diatom testing there are some guidelines that scientists must follow. To get a more accurate result there has to be at least 20 diatoms in a 100 microliter sample. When dealing with testing on a human body having 5 complete diatoms from more than 2 different organs will also give a positive diagnosis. Samples are taken from bone marrow, lung, spleen, liver, kidney, brain tissue, or from the area where the crime was discovered or occurred. Body Test When a body has been drowned diatoms go into the lungs and then are circulated to other internal organs through the individuals circulation. A forensic scientist will extract 100 g of either a tissue sample or bone marrow from a femur still attached to the victim. There are many different methods of extracting diatoms but the most commonly used method is acid digestion. This method is acknowledged worldwide, less expensive, and takes less time to get results. Scientists boil the sample and then add 50 ml of nitric acid solution. The color of the mixture will turn from yellow to transparent. After 48 hours when the sample has reached room temperature it is centrifuged, which allows the organic matter to completely oxidize, and the pellet is extracted, mixed with distilled water, and examined on a slide. The ratios of the different specimen of diatoms are counted, which allows scientists to match the area where the victim entered the water. Testing a Sample Materials taken from victims, suspects, or the crime scene can also be tested to match locations of where the samples derived. Environmental products, such as mud, are placed in a test tube with a sulfuric acid and potassium dichromate solution for 24 hours. After centrifuging the tube, it is then placed in a boiling water bath for an hour. After the pellet is extracted it is mixed with distilled water and mounted on a slide with Hyrax. When diatom testing on an organic sample scientists use phase contrast microscopy. While observing the diatoms are tallied and organized based on their different species. The ratio of specific specimen of diatoms in the water will have a similar ratio to the sample that is taken from the site where the diatoms were transferred. Scientists use this to match materials and people to specific locations at a crime scene. An example of when this test was used was in Connecticut, July 1991. Two boys were fishing along a river when they were bound, beaten with a baseball bat, and attempted drowning by other three teenage boys. The boys escaped to go report the attack. Forensic scientists took the clothes of the victims and the clothes of the suspects that the boys had identified. At the College of Connecticut the samples taken from the clothing and crime scene underwent diatom testing and then analyzed. The observation of the samples showed that the ratios of algae populations from each sample were about 80% similar. The transfer function approach also was applied to this case and three specific species of Eunotia were considered unique to the crime scene. All three species were found in both the victim and suspect’s clothes. The results were then used to get confessions from the suspects. Time of death estimation When using diatom testing, scientists observe the amount of diatoms present on the organism and may be able to estimate a generalized time of death. If there are less than 20 different species of colonizing diatoms, then the organism's death could have been within the previous 7 to 12 days, but, if there are more than 50 different colonies of diatoms then it is determined that death possibly occurred several weeks ago. Certain taxa of diatoms narrow the time frame to more exact dates. For example, Ankistrodesmus algae is a type of diatom that does not start to colonize on an organism till 30 days after its death. This taxon is also referred to as \\"late colonizers\\". Techniques and methods Extraction methods When using the ‘’’acid digestion method’’’ scientists add sulfuric acid to the sample, let sit for 48 hours, centrifuge, mix with distilled water, and mount on slide for examination. Because this method has the fewest steps, it gives scientists faster and less expensive results. The ‘’’Soluene-350 method’’’ is used only for freshwater samples. The sample is mixed with formalin, rinsed and centrifuged three times with distilled water. Then the pelletis removed from the test tube and added with 8ml of Soluene-350, incubated at 50 degrees Celsius for 2 hours, centrifuged again, and finally mounted on a slide. The ‘’’Enzymatic method’’’ is used for tissue samples and because of the use of enzyme chemicals it is considered an environmentally safe method and has a smaller percentage of damaging the diatoms collected than that of the acid digestion method. Concentrated nitric acid and Proteinase-K, or peroxide, are added to the sample for 12 hours, centrifuged twice, rinsed with distilled water, and then mounted on a slide with Naphrax. Using this form of extraction, observers can use a light microscope when examining the results. The ‘’’Membrane Filter method’’’ is used when there is a presence of either damaged diatoms in the sample (result of pollutants) or inorganic materials. The blood of the victim is taken and filtered through Sodium Dodecyl Sulfate and nitrocellulose membranes with decreasing pore sizes. The membranes are then dried and filtered with distilled water. After being dried the pieces of membrane that filtered the blood are examined for diatoms and pollen grains. ‘’’Colloidal Silica Gradient Centrifugation method’’’ can be used with liver and lung samples. The tissue collected is added to saline solution, centrifuged at a temperature of 12 degrees Celsius, and then added to distilled water to then be mounted on a slide and observed. ‘’’Dry Ash method’’’ can only be applied to a bone marrow sample. Five grams of marrow is taken from a victim to be placed in a nitric acid solution and then bunt in a furnace allowing the release of diatoms to then be analyzed. Transfer function approach In order to determine the reliability of a conclusion, scientists use the transfer function approach. The sample taken from a crime scene is matched with a location at a crime scene based on the ratio of diatom species present. Because diatoms can also be in the air and transferred to people through contact, breathing, eating, and drinking forensic scientists want to establish a base line or percent of error. Samples are taken off of clothing and objects of suspects and around the area of the crime scene and then tested to see the ratio of diatom colonies present before the alleged incident occurred. Specific species of diatoms will be only common to the sample taken from the crime scene. If the person or object was at the crime scene then the presence of that specific taxa should be on the sample taken from the suspects or material. After calculating the ratio scientists then cross-examine the similarities. If there are diatom colonies present at both the scene and in the sample that are different from base line samples then it concludes the information viable. Diatom database In 2006, scientists began creating a diatom database. It is the 'fingerprint system' for diatoms. The computer recognizes different diatom species based on shape and color characteristics. The tallying of colonies present in a sample, as well as the preferences of flora for diatom colonies are in the system so that scientists can access the information. But, as of 2012 the database is not complete and not used in courts. Legal application As of 2012, a small percentage of forensic limnology is used as evidence in courts. The presence of diatoms in air, food, drink, and close contact is not variable enough to be supportive evidence in determining locations of events. Even so, an investigation requires the use of forensic limnology in order to estimate time of death, location of drowning, and the determining of suspect. If the results of forensic limnology are not used in prosecution, the results are used to understand the crime.

It was located in Monigo, a suburb of the town of Treviso. The camp was active between 1942 and 1943. The total number of inmates is not certain, but is estimated in a total of around 10,000, with an average number of 2,582 prisoners at a time (maximum 3,374). The camp often surpassed its full capacity of 2,400 (as stated by Italian military authorities). Memorial plaque on the outer walls of the former camp  Structure and use  The camp was located inside the \\"Cadorin\\" military base, just north-west of Treviso. The inmates occupied five brick barracks, with an additional one reserved to guards and soldiers. In addition to the prisoner accommodations, two small rooms were used for the bathrooms and the canteen, and a seventh cabin served as a kitchen and hosted the command. The camp opened on July 1, 1942. Initially, the camp was populated by Slovenian prisoners, followed in autumn by Croatian individuals (most of them from Rab concentration camp). Due to its relatively small size and the cold weather of early 1943, diseases such as tuberculosis spread through the inmate population. Starting from March 1943, POWs from South Africa and New Zealand (around 500 and 100 respectively) were also assigned to Monigo in a subsection called camp 103. Prisoners came from a transit camp in Benghazi, after being captured during the Fall of Tobruk. The camp remained active until the Armistice of Cassabile between the Kingdom of Italy and the Allies on September 8, 1943. The German Army assumed control of the camp soon after, remaining until the end of the War in May 1945. Afterwards, the camp served for a brief period of time as a DP camp, and was later reinstated to its original military use. The camp under Italian administration New prisoners were subjected to a \\"bonifica\\",Basic decontamination procedure that included shower and clothes disinfection. No uniform was provided (differently from German-managed lagers) and prisoners initially only used their personal summer clothing (even during colder seasons). Inmates were given three blankets, a spoon, a tin and a bit of straw. Bunk beds were placed on each wall, where inmates slept in pairs. No forced labour was theoretically imposed; however, drawings made by Slovenian interned Vladimir Lamut show maintenance activities were required. Prisoners were organized following the \\"Circolare 3C\\" (Memo 3C) by General Mario Roatta, distinguishing \\"repressivi\\" (to repress, partisans) from \\"protettivi\\" (to be protected, usually target of Slavic partisans repercussions). In practice, limited resources and frequent influx of new prisoners prevented this separation, causing cohabitation issues. Inmates were subject to strict discipline, and invasive inspections were frequent. Violence was not systematically practiced; however, the Carabinieri camp commander tenente colonnello Alfredo Anceschi was known for his strictness. Prisoners recalled the episode of a woman tied in the middle of the camp's grounds for an entire day. Living conditions were bad from the start, since dorms had no heating and diet included as low as 911 calories per day. Prisoners were fed with a cup of tea in the morning and later with a loaf of bread. At lunch prisoners were given rice and during the late afternoon, a slice of cheese. Around the end of 1942, only a few months after the camp's opening, inflation further lowered the available budget. In addition to this, guards used to steal supplies in order to resell them in the rampant black market. In November 1942, there were 3,122 prisoners in Monigo: 1,058 men, 1,085 women and 466 children including 42 infants. With the arrival of winter, food supplies dwindles and disease decimated the weakest. Professor Menemio Bortolozzi, pathologist at Treviso hospital, noted the widespread presence of tuberculosis, pneumonia, scabies, muscular atrophy and dysentery. \\"They were not normal corpses,\\" he declared to the press later, \\"they looked like mummies or exhumed bodies\\". In particular, women and children from Rab suffered the most. Camp casualties were reported by different lists, averaging around 200 (187, 192 and 225). 53 children under 10 years of age died; infant mortality rate was about 300 per thousand. Despite the difficult living conditions, Slovenian prisoners organized a choir, chess tournaments and even the publication of a newspaper, Novice izza žice (news from behind the barbed wire).  The camp under German administration  Just after the Armistice was declared, Italian personnel was in a state of complete disarray due to lack of clear orders. Soldiers were either captured by the Germans and deported as POW out of Italy, enlisted in the new Republican Army or forced into joining other German units. Those who successfully fled their posts either went back home or joined partisan formations. The Monigo barracks were left without guards: civilian prisoners, POW of Camp 103 and Italian soldiers left the camp. There is no clear indication of the fate of the majority of the prisoners after September 1943, or Monigo's immediate use. Around the end of 1943, German units seized the camp and installed a driving school for Italian Republican military forces, together with a small garrison of Organisation Todt members. During the night between 5 and 6 December 1943 the great sweep up of the Jews of Venice took place, but there is no indication of Jews in the camp. However, due to the close vicinity of the camp from Venice (40 km) this cannot be excluded, as captured individuals could have stationed there before being transferred to Polish or German extermination camps. Use as a DP camp and termination After the end of the war and the deportation of the remaining German/Italian personnel, the whole structure briefly became a camp for Displaced Persons, administered by the Allied Military Government. From late May 1942 to August 1945, around 20,000 individuals passed through the camp: 8,000 Poles, 4,700 French, 2,000 slavs and a large number of Italian POWs returning from Germany. After the termination of all DP activities, the barracks returned to exercise their usual military function. Today they stand at the disposal of the Italian Army, housing the 33rd EW Regiment. Memorial On November 9, 2019, a civil ceremony was held in memory of the deportees and the refugees of the camp. The ceremony included the unveiling of two memorial plaques, affixed on its boundary walls right next to the military base gates. During the event, civil and religious authorities from Italy, Croatia and Slovenia highlighted the importance of tolerance, human dignity and international cooperation.

It was established in order to provide a means by which National Health Service (NHS) patients in England could get cancer drugs rejected by National Institute for Health and Care Excellence because they were not cost effective. Its establishment was confirmed by the UK government's coalition agreement in 2010,The Coalition: our programme for government , 2010 and by the White Paper, Equity and excellence – Liberating the NHS.Department of Health \\"Equity and excellence – Liberating the NHS\\", 2010 Since April 2011, the fund paid for nearly 100,000 people with cancer to access treatments. It was closed to new drugs from October 2015 to 29 July 2016 in line with the recommendation of the independent Cancer Taskforce report, which called for urgent reform to put the CDF on a more sustainable footing.  Objectives  Following the reforms in 2016 the objectives were updated. The new arrangements put it on a more sustainable footing with 3 key objectives: *patients have faster access to the most promising new cancer treatments. *taxpayers get better value for money in drug expenditure. *Thirdly, pharmaceutical companies that are willing to price their products responsibly can access a new, fast-track route to NHS funding for the best and most promising drugs. The previous objectives of the CDF, as set out by the UK government in 2011,Department of Health \\"The Cancer Drugs Fund: Guidance to support operation of the Cancer Drugs Fund in 2012-13\\", 2012 were that it should: * provide maximum support to NHS patients * put clinicians and cancer specialists at the heart of decision-making, consistent with the Government’s wider policy of empowering health professionals and enabling them to use their professional judgement about what is right for patients * act as an effective bridge to the Government’s aim of introducing a value-based pricing system for branded drugs in 2014. Operation The patient's consultant must apply to the fund using an application form supplied by NHS England. Decision Summaries which are the formal decisions of the Chemotherapy Clinical Reference Group are published. Avastin is the most frequently requested treatment. Kadcyla is the most expensive drug funded. Both are manufactured by Hoffmann-La Roche, which has been described as the largest beneficiary of the fund. From July 2016 it became a “managed access” fund, paying for new drugs for a set period before they are definitively approved or rejected by the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence. It did not accept any new drugs between April and July 2016. From 2016 each drug has evaluation criteria and a timescale for effectiveness to be assessed. If it is considered to be cost effective it will be available to any patient. If not it will not be available at all in the English NHS. The current list of treatments funded by the CDF is available from the NHS England website: https://www.england.nhs.uk/cancer/cdf/cancer-drugs-fund-list/.  History  The funding system originally ran from April 2011 to March 2014, and was preceded by an Interim Cancer Drugs Fund from October 2010 to March 2011. Based on the size of their covered population, each strategic health authority in England was allocated fixed funds from a total £200 million per annum that was made available. The fund overspent by £30m in the year ending 2014. In August 2014 it was announced that the CDF would receive £80 million in additional funding for the following 2 years. But in November 2014 it was announced that 42 drugs currently provided would be reassessed due to inadequate cost-effectiveness. In Wales, the National Assembly debated the use of Cancer Treatment Fund and the Welsh Labour government was clear that it would not be replacing its existing evidence-based system with a cancer drugs fund. It relies on the All Wales Medicines Strategy Group which has appraised and recommended 19 new cancer medicines for use in NHS Wales covering 23 clinical indications. These are now routinely available to eligible patients in Wales but only 9 are available in England via the Cancer Drugs Fund. In May 2015 it was reported that only 59 of the 84 treatments previously funded would be supported in future, and that three new drugs would be included in the scheme. After a manufacturer's appeal Regorafenib was restored to the list. Criticism Research indicates that society does not support the prioritisation of cancer drugs over other treatments.Linley, W.G. & Hughes, D.A., 2012.

James Le Fanu writing in the Daily Telegraph said \\"This mechanism for diverting taxpayers’ money to enhance, to little or no purpose, the profits of Big Pharma might be more aptly named “the Drug Company Fund”.\\" In February 2015 York University researchers reported that the fund represented particularly poor value, diverting money from other patient services and that for every healthy year gained by this fund, five QALYs could be lost across the NHS. In December 2014 Andy Burnham announced that a Labour government would replace the fund with a Cancer Treatment Fund which would pay not only for innovative cancer drugs, but also for surgery and radiotherapy. It could mean increased access to advanced forms of radiotherapy such as intensity modulated radiotherapy and stereotactic ablative radiotherapy. In July 2015 the independent cancer taskforce established by NHS England proposed reform of the fund, which the taskforce said was “no longer sustainable or desirable… in its current form”. Professor Karl Claxton, a health economist at the University of York, says that the fund should be scrapped because the money would be better used on 21,000 patients with heart, lung and gastro-intestinal diseases who are denied cost effective evidence based treatment, arguing that the principal beneficiary of the fund is 'big pharma'. In September 2015 the National Audit Office reported that no data had been collected on the 74,000 patients whose treatment had been funded, at a cost of nearly £1 billion, so it was impossible to discover whether the treatment had been effective. The Public Accounts Committee published a report on the fund in February 2016 which concluded that there was no evidence the fund was benefiting patients, extending lives or a good use of taxpayers' money. Prof Richard Sullivan, of King's College London and Dr Ajay Aggarwal of the London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine published a study in the Annals of Oncology in April 2017. He concluded that the initiative as initially established was a \\"huge waste of money\\" and a \\"major policy error\\". The researchers studied the 47 treatments that were being funded by January 2015, of which only 18% met internationally recognised criteria for being deemed clinically beneficial. For those drugs where there was some evidence of benefit, the average was an extra 3.2 months of survival. The majority of patients were exposed to unpleasant side effects for no benefit. £1.27 billion was spent on the fund during the period studied. No usable data was collected on what happened to patients whose treatment was funded - such as measuring how long they lived, their quality of life or side- effects. There was no consideration of the relative merits of surgery and radiotherapy.

The Dean and Chapter of Lisburn Cathedral are known as the Dean and Chapter of St Saviour, Connor in honour of the original cathedral of Connor. The current building was started in 1708, after its predecessor was burnt down. Its noteworthy features are the gallery seating in the nave and the octagonal spire. At approximately 55m (181 feet) http://lisburn.com/books/Cathedral/cathedral-1.html (Spire and weather vane exactly 106 feet in building plans and tower approximately 75 feet) it is the tallest and most prominent building in the city of Lisburn. History A church was built on the cathedral site in the early 1600s by Sir Fulke Conway as a chapel of ease for his new castle at what was then called Lisnagarvey. It was consecrated in 1623 and dedicated to St Thomas, but was destroyed along with much of the town during the rebellion of 1641.\\"The Cathedrals of the Church of Ireland\\" Day, J.G.F./ Patton, H.E. p49: London, S.P.C.K., 1932 The church was quickly rebuilt and in 1662 St Thomas's was designated the cathedral church and episcopal seat of the United Diocese of Down and Connor by Charles II and renamed Christ Church Cathedral. Additional gallery seating was introduced in 1674 with access via a bell tower. The cathedral burned down a second time in 1707. Again it was quickly rebuilt starting in the (20/08/1708) e completed 11 years much after in the (1719), retaining the galleries in the nave with access via the tower which had survived the fire. The octagonal spire was added in 1804 and the chancel built and consecrated in 1889. In the year of 2003, the 1796 front gates were replaced and in 2004 the clock chimes refurbished. On 31 July 1914 protesting Suffragettes bombed the Cathedral. A small explosion blew out one of the oldest stained glass windows. Four women arrested after the attack, at the home of Lillian Metge, (a middle- class widow who lived in Seymour Street), had to receive police protection when arrested. All the windows of Mrs Metge's house were broken by residents opposed to their actions and the government threatened to raise the rates to pay for the damage caused. No charges were pressed due to the outbreak of World War I and they were released by order of the Home Secretary.

It provides water to the capital city of Gaborone. It is operated by the Water Utilities Corporation. Structure The Bokaa Dam was built in 1990/1991 by damming the Metsimotlhabe River, a tributary of the Ngotwane river just south of Bokaa village. The catchment area is about . The dam is an earthcore fill structure with a crest level height of . It was opened in 1993. The dam's surface area when full is . The reservoir is about in length and over at its widest. Water supply The Bokaa Dam has a capacity of . It is about from Botswana's capital of Gaborone. As of 2012 the dam provided 25% of the water supply for Gaborone and surrounding areas. There were exceptionally dry conditions in the winter of 2012, and the reservoir dried up and was closed in September 2012. The North-South Carrier (NSC) pipeline came into service in 2000, delivering water to Gaborone from the north and running past the Bokaa Dam. An early version of the NSC plan used the Bokaa Dam as the reservoir, but it was decided to instead build a covered reservoir closer to Gaborone at Mmamashia to minimise loss of water through evaporation. Water from the Bokaa Dam is now injected into the NSC pipeline. Water is treated at the Mmamashia plant, directly to the south. Reservoir uses There is a picnic spot for weekend visitors on the southern shore. The dam is in a region of Acacia savanna that is used for grazing many livestock including sheep, goats, donkeys and cattle. The fence is in disrepair so the livestock have trampled the water edge into bare mud in many areas. The reservoir is home to many water birds, notably an important population of southern pochard. Significant numbers of great crested grebe have also been observed. Sometimes it is home to small numbers of pink-backed pelican. Between 1991 and 1995, counts of waterfowls peaked at about 4,000 individuals.

It operated from July 1940 to September 1943, with a capacity of 80-90 people. Jewish refugees from Germany and Austria were interned first, then \\"ex-Yugoslavs\\". History On April 27, 1940, the former school in the municipality of Casoli and local property from Att. Innocent Tilli were identified as possible places of internment. They were replaced a few months later by another location of the same capacity, used in the past as a movie theatre. The Ministry of the Interior decided to allocate the place to an internment camp for foreign Jews, Germans and Austrians. The camp's administration (activated June 10, 1940) was headed by the town's mayor: Moses Ricci, while monitoring was conferred to the police and health matters to Dr. Nicholas Raymond. The first inmates arrived July 14, 1940, their number varying over time as a result of the numerous transfers between camps. Conditions in this camp were better than in most other camps, due to inspections of the Red Cross taking place and inmates receiving international aid through DELASEM. The work of Moses Ricci was even reported in October 1940 by local fascists for being too bland and sympathetic to the inmates, who enjoyed greater freedom of movement and with whom the local population tended to fraternize. In May 1942, the 50 \\"foreign Jews\\" were transferred to another internment camp and in their place came 82 \\"ex- Yugoslavs\\" from Corropoli internment camp. The conditions worsened given the shortage of food and clothing, the lack of toilets and overcrowding, as alleged in Red Cross communications. By September 8, 1943, the camp was closed, after the armistice was signed. See also * Holocaust in Italy References This article was initially translated from the Italian Wikipedia.

The dam is operated by the Water Utilities Corporation, and supplies water to the capital city of Gaborone. Location The Gaborone Dam is located south of Gaborone along the Gaborone-Lobatse road, and provides water for both Gaborone and Lobatse. The effective catchment area covers about , drained by the Notwane river and the lesser Taung, Metsemaswaane and Nywane rivers. Between 1971 and 2000, average annual rainfall was between and . Temperatures range from in Winter to in Summer. Average potential evapotranspiration is about annually. Description Dam construction began in 1963, capturing water from the Notwane River, at a time when the new capital city of Gaborone was in the planning stages. The original dam was complete in 1964. The dam is an earthcore fill structure. During the 1965-66 rainy season the reservoir filled and overflowed. Between 1983 and 1985 the dam was raised by to increase capacity, reaching a maximum height of and a length of . Raising the dam had to be done extremely carefully to ensure that the impervious upstream zone of the dam remained intact and was extended up the raised bank. Most of the reservoir is less than deep. The surface area of the reservoir when full is . Until completion of the Dikgatlhong Dam in 2011, the Gaborone dam was the largest in Botswana. Issues After the dam was opened and filled, the average water levels began to drop. In part, this was due to a cyclical change in rainfall, reducing the amount of water fed into the reservoir and increasing the impact of evaporation in the hot, dry climate. In part it was due to growth of the city and growing per-capita demand for water as the population became more affluent, using water for purposes such as filling swimming pools and washing cars. By the end of 2002 the reservoir was 79% full, and by the start of 2004 it was 54% full. By the end of 2004 the reservoir was just 27% full and the government was forced to impose harsh restrictions on water use. By September 2005 the reservoir was down to 17% full, or per citizen of Gaborone. In the drought-prone country, the water supply is a constant concern. A neon signboard in the city informs residents how full the reservoir is. The reservoir and the green buffer zone that surrounds it are the largest and most fragile ecosystem in the Gaborone area. A book published in 2004 noted that storm water drainage is poor in Gaborone, causing recurring street floods, and that pit latrines and overflowing sewage ponds endanger the water in the reservoir. Reservoir use The reservoir is starting to be marketed as a recreational area. The northern end of the reservoir is planned to become an entertainment venue called The Waterfront. There is a yacht club, called Gaborone Yacht Club, on the northern side of the lake. The southern end houses the Kalahari Fishing Club and a new public facility called City Scapes. City Scapes contains parks, playgrounds, and boating facilities. The dam is popular with birdwatchers, windsurfers, and anglers. However, there is no swimming due to crocodiles and parasitic bilharzias, which can transmit the serious disease schistosomiasis.

Porra antequerana consists of tomato and dried bread. As it is much thicker than its culinary cousins, gazpacho and salmorejo, it is more commonly served as tapas, not soup. Like all soups in this family, there can be variations on the recipe. The word 'Antequerana' derives from the town of Antequera. Page 88, The Cuisines of Spain: Exploring Regional Home Cooking by Teresa Barrenechea, Jeffrey Koehler and Christopher Hirsheimer (Aug 11, 2009) Porra is a type of club or truncheon and the use of the word in the dish's name likely refers to its traditional preparation with mortar and pestle. The original recipe was served warm with bread, tomatoes, vegetables, olive oil, garlic, hard-boiled eggs, ham, and just about anything peasants may have had on hand. These ingredients were made into purée with a mortar (porra). The soup later started to be served cold, mostly as a tapa. It can have many variations such as serving with tuna fish on top.

The dam is used for irrigation and also supports a bird sanctuary. Origins The Mogobane Irrigation Scheme was developed in the colonial era using Balete labor to build residential facilities, a warehouse and storerooms, the dam, canal and of irrigable fields. It was taken over by the district council in 1966. It was transferred to the Malete Land Board when it was formed in 1972, and then leased to the Botswana Development Corporation (BDC). In 2001 the irrigation farm was being sold. At a meeting in October 2003 the Balete were calling for the morafe to repossess the Mogobane Irrigation Scheme, which their grandparents had built on their land. Usage The dam provides water for livestock and for the Mogobane village residents. As of 1982 the dam was infested with bilharzia snails and therefore cannot be used for swimming. The water must be boiled before being drunk. During times of heavy rainfall the dam may overflow, flooding the adjoining Mogobane village. Waterbirds There is a bird sanctuary bordering the dam to the west, with the goal of protecting birds that are not classified as game birds. The reservoir is home to a variety of bird life, with as many as seventy species being recorded at different times of the year including 11 species of herons and egrets, 14 species of ducks and geese and 24 species of waders. In summer the shallows are used by waders, and Black-headed and Grey Herons, Cattle Egret, Reed Cormorant and African Spoonbill breed in the reed beds in the center of the shallows when they are surrounded by water. Orange-breasted Waxbill and Fan- tailed Cisticola are found in the reeds and grasses around the reservoir.

The advert starred Carl Rice, and Kevin Staine.  Advert  The advert features two young Liverpool Football Club fans. One tells the other that star Liverpool player Ian Rush had told him that if he didn't drink milk, he would only be good enough to play for Accrington Stanley. The other fan asks, “Accrington Stanley, who are they?”, to which the first replies, “Exactly”. According to Rice, Tottenham Hotspur were originally going to be named. However, Tottenham objected, so Accrington Stanley were chosen instead, as they were a non-League team at the time, and were thought of as a more obscure team. David Lloyd, a non-executive director of Accrington Stanley, said in an interview in 2012 that the advert earned the club £10,000.  Reception  The advert was popular, and was continually shown for up to six years, after it was originally made in 1989. The phrase was seen to make Accrington Stanley the subject of jokes up to the present day. However, residents of Accrington view the reference positively. In March 2006, Rice was invited as the guest of honour to watch Accrington Stanley's match against Stevenage Borough, and was later invited to Accrington Stanley's last game of the season against Scarborough, as they were promoted to Football League Two. In September 2009, the programme on Sky Sports, Soccer AM promoted Accrington Stanley's “Save Our Stanley” campaign because of the phrase, as they wanted to continue to use it to refer to the club, when reading fixture lists. A “shot-for-shot” remake advertising Black Cow Vodka, which is made from milk, began airing in September 2016, with a much older Rice reprising his role. The advert was banned from airing in March 2017, due to concerns that it targeted children, because of the connection to the original advert, and promoted excessive drinking.

Biography Heinrich Jung was born as the son of a Bergrat (a mining officer of high rank) in Essen and studied from 1895 to 1899 mathematics, physics, and chemistry in Marburg/Lahn and Berlin under outstanding professors including Friedrich Schottky, Kurt Hensel, Lazarus Immanuel Fuchs, Hermann Amandus Schwarz, Ferdinand Georg Frobenius, and Max Planck. In his 1899 doctoral dissertation Über die kleinste Kugel, die eine räumliche Figur einschließt under Schottky he proved the eponymous Jung's Theorem. In 1902 he completed his Habilitation thesis in Marburg and remained there until 1908 as a privatdocent. Afterwards he was a Studienrat (teacher at a secondary school, i.e., Gymnasium) in Hamburg, before he became in 1913 a professor ordinarius in Kiel. After brief military service in World War I he became in 1918 a professor in Dorpat and in 1920 the successor to Albert Wangerin (1844–1933) at the University of Halle, where he remained until his retirement as professor emeritus in 1948. In Halle he was not only a professor but also one of the directors of mathematical seminars and dean of the mathematical and sciences faculty and until 1951 he continued to give lectures. He was a member of the Deutsche Akademie der Naturforscher Leopoldina. Jung developed with his teacher Schottky a general theory of theta functions. Jung's fame derives mainly from his arithmetic theory of algebraic functions in two variables. His original research in this theory is gathered together in his book Einführung in die algebraische Theorie der Funktionen von zwei Veränderlicher. He also applied his theory to algebraic surfaces (with a presentation of this research in his book Algebraische Flächen) and worked on birational transformations in the plane (Cremona transformations). During the Weimar Republic, Jung was a member of the anti-republican Alldeutschen Verband and also Der Stahlhelm. In the Nazi era, Jung was a member of the Nationalsozialistischen Volkswohlfahrt (NSV), the Nationalsozialistischer Deutscher Dozentenbund (NSDDB), and the Nationalsozialistischer Altherrenbund.

The class first appeared in the 3.5 edition of D&D; and was introduced in the Eberron campaign setting. The artificer is a unique base class that reflects many of the core themes of Eberron. Campaign setting Though introduced as a wizard specialist in Player's Option: Spells & Magic (1996) and as a prestige class for gnome arcane spellcasters in Magic of Faerûn (2001), artificers were first added as a standalone class in the Eberron campaign setting. They are a major defining feature of a Dragonmarked house, House Cannith, and the common people in the metropolis of Sharn and other cities rely heavily on artificers to maintain the magical infrastructure. Artificers represent many of the high-magic elements of Eberron as a campaign setting. Publication history =Advanced Dungeons & Dragons 2nd edition= The first appearance of an artificer was as a wizard specialist introduced in the Advanced Dungeons & Dragons 2nd edition supplement Player's Option: Spells & Magic (1996) where artifice was a newly added specialty within the School of Thaumaturgy. This artificer channels magic into or through non-living items for their own personal use, thus any spells in the Enchantment/Charm school which happen to affect living things, and the entire school of Necromancy are opposed to the Artifice specialty and off limits to the artificer of AD&D; 2nd edition. =Dungeons & Dragons 3rd edition= In D&D; 3rd edition, the artificer was introduced as a base class in the Eberron Campaign Setting (2004). The artificer's abilities act primarily on items and constructs. The artificer uses Intelligence-based Infusions instead of typical magics and psionics. Infusions work similarly to spells but must be implanted in a specific object, giving it a temporary magic effect. An artificer can create magic items for which he or she does not have access to the prerequisite spells. Artificers receive a number of craft reserve points every level. These points can be used instead of experience points in the creation of new magic items. Thus Artificers are able to make use of item creation feats without the experience penalty that other spell casters must take. Constructs, mechanical beasts, and particularly Warforged fall under the artificer's area of influence. Specific infusions can be cast to repair or inflict damage to any creature with a construct subtype. At fourth level Artificers may craft a homunculus companion. A homunculus is similar to a Wizard's familiar but more intelligent and generally better equipped to a single task. No published race has artificer as a favored class, though being a warforged artificer gives players the advantage of being able to use infusions on themselves. =Dungeons & Dragons 4th edition= The artificer as an official base class appeared in the Eberron Player's Guide (July 2009). Shannon Appelcline (author of Designers & Dragons) wrote that \\"the artificer was the first character class to be playtested as part of D&D; Insider, in an article that was collected in Dragon #365 (July 2008). The 4e playtest artificer was updated quite a bit for his first official appearance in the Eberron Player's Guide, with the biggest change being to his healing infusions, which was intended to help differentiate him from other leader classes. A design & development article in Dragon #376 (June 2009) provides interesting insights into the development of the artificer [...], such as the fact that special rules only used by the artificer [...] were replaced by more standard 4e mechanics [...] because the new rules 'didn’t amount to enough mechanical benefit'\\". Artificers are arcane leaders. They can use rods, staves, and wands as implements. Artificers can also use arcane spells called infusions to imbue objects with magical power, and focus on buffing, healing and protecting allies. Many of their powers relate to weapons or armor. =Dungeons & Dragons 5th edition= The 5th edition version of the artificer first appeared in a 2017 \\"Unearthed Arcana\\" playtest and went through several rounds of public playtesting. The final version was included in the Eberron: Rising from the Last War (November 2019) campaign book. It was the first base class published for 5th edition since the Player's Handbook (August 2014). It includes three subclasses: the alchemist, focused on potions and sliders, the artilerist, focused on ranged weaponry and defenses, and the battle smith, focused on constructs and combat. Reception During the 5th edition playtest, Bleeding Cool wrote \\"if you happen to remember playing Dungeons & Dragons during the 3.5 Edition phase of the game, you might remember a class called Artificer. [...] Depending on who you ask, the character class was made either to enhance the Eberron campaign at the time, or it was simply put into the game to attract steampunk fans into checking out D&D.; We’re guessing the truth lies somewhere in the middle. Artificer made it into 4th Edition, but was dropped [when] 5th Edition came out in 2014\\". Charlie Hall, in his review of Eberron: Rising From The Last War for Polygon, highlighted potential game balance issues with the Artificer, the first new character class for 5th edition. He wrote \\"trouble is that one of the big issues with D&D; over the years has been magical item spam. […] It got so bad in the 4th edition that the 5th edition introduced a system called 'attunement'. […] The Artificer class will be the first to allow players to attune to more than three magical items at one time. […] I'm just saying, as someone who has DM'd for quite a while now, maybe think twice about allowing an Artificer into your campaign. It might be a bit more trouble than its worth\\". Corey Plante, for Inverse, wrote \\"Why has it taken this long for a new character class, especially one this awesome, to be finalized for D&D; 5th edition? The answer is that if you want to tinker with magical inventions, the process takes time. […] Why is now the perfect time for the Artificer's big debut? The answer has surprisingly little to do with the game itself. Instead, it has everything to do with the setting of Eberron in this latest sourcebook.[…] In a world shaped equally by science and magic, there's no better herald than the Artificer\\". Jeremy Thomas, in his review of Eberron: Rising From The Last War for 411Mania, highlighted the multiple playtest iterations Artificer went through before being published in the 5th Edition. He wrote \\"the version we get rather effectively combines all those elements into a workable, balanced class that feels true to the spirit of the Artificer. Artificers create magical items and use tools to work their magic, and the subclasses (Alchemist, Artillerist, Battle Smith) give an Artificer some distinct roles that they can fill. They’re magic users, but they won’t be encroaching on the pure destructive power of wizards or sorcerers\\". Other media The artificer appears as a class in Dungeons & Dragons Online (DDO). DDO community manager Amanda Grove said she enjoyed playing the class in the game, although she said using two hands to shoot rather than one was difficult. Ashe Collins, for DieHard GameFan, wrote \\"I’m all for the new class, especially since it’s the first class we’re getting that is specific to the Eberron Campaign Setting, The Artificer. I’ve loved this class since I first read about it back when we were playing in Eberron, mainly because I love combining magic and technology. It’s no wonder that Techno-Mages from the Rifts RPG are some of my favorites to play and have as NPCs. In the setting the Artificer worked as a buffer for the Warforge class, but I’m thinking in the MMO it might cover the whole party. And with Crafting being in the game now, I also can’t help but wonder if the class itself might get some kind of bonus to making items or on items. Artificers are an interesting support class but I can see lots of solo builds coming out of it as well\\".

The long, high zoned embankment was completed in 1973. Water from the dam is brought to Selebi-Phikwe by an underground pipeline. In 1982 it was found that groundwater from the local wells in Francistown had high levels of nitrate, and was also inadequate to meet public demand, so the public water supply for that city was changed over to using water from the Shashe Dam. The Shashe Dam water works, off the Francistown road to the north of the Tonota Development Plan Area, also supplies potable water to Tonota. Reservoir usage The total potential yield of fish from the reservoir has been estimated at over 50 tonnes per year. The reservoir is used for subsistence, commercial and sports fishing, and also by a sailing club. Turtles, fish, otters, Nile monitors and many different birds inhabit the reservoir.

It operated from January 1941 to May 1944, with a maximum capacity of 150 people. Irredentist Slavic and Italian communists were interned and after September 8, 1943 it also served as a concentration camp for Jews. History In June 1940 the convent of the Fathers of Celestini Abbey (owned by the City of Corropoli, about a mile away from the village) was approved as a location for the camp. Between 1940 and 1943, the Commissioners of Public Safety: Guido Trevisani, Mario Maiello, John Santamaria, Carmine Medici, Francesco Alongi, Carmine Sanzo and Mario Gagliardi, administered the camp. The supervision was entrusted to the police and health matters to Dr. Gaetano D'Aristotle. The camp was not active immediately since the building required major renovations. During February 1941 the first inmates arrived. Before becoming an internment camp, the structure was identified as a TB health centre. There was pressure to restore the building to its original destination, therefore on May 4, 1942 the building was cleared and its occupants transferred to other camps. However, on June 16, 1942 the Ministry of the Interior imposed the reopening of the camp, which housed inmates with various nationalities: Slavic, Greek, English, etc. reaching a capacity of 165 units. As with a few other Italian camps, this one received complaints about the excessive freedom the inmates enjoyed. This meant among other things that in June 1943 the camp was enclosed with barbed wire. After 8 September 1943 several inmates were freed by Yugoslav partisans. In December of that year, however, 130 people were still in the camp, now controlled by authorities of the Italian Social Republic and inserted as a link in the complex system of Nazi deportation. On February 1, 1944, 69 Jews arrived from Nereto internment camp. In May 1944, 60 of them were to be transferred to the Servigliano prison camp to be deported.

His second son, Ernest Simon went on to become the first Baron Simon of Wythenshawe. Youth and education Henry Simon was born in Brieg, Silesia, then a province of Prussia, on 7 June 1835. His father was a director at one of Germany's first railways, which allowed Henry to spend much of his youth in and among the railways; sparking an inclination to study mechanics from an early age.British Industrial History, http://www.gracesguide.co.uk/Henry_Gustav_Simon In his teenage years Henry was witness to the revolutionary ferment of 1848 and gradually grew disillusioned with his native country. When his much loved uncle Heinrich Simon was forced to seek political refuge in Switzerland, Henry followed him and it was here that he went on to gain his Engineering Diploma from Zurich Technical Polytechnical School. Armed solely with this and a 'surcharge of mental energy and business initiative', Henry moved to Manchester where he would make a lasting name for himself.Mary Danvers Stocks, Ernest Simon of Manchester (1963), p.4 In 1874 Simon married Mary Jane Lane of Melbourne, Australia who bore him a son, Ingo in 1875 before her death in 1876. Subsequently, in 1878, he married Emily Stoehr who added a further four sons and three daughters, their eldest son, Ernest Darwin, was to succeed him on his death as head of the business and become Baron Simon of Wythenshawe in 1947. Career =Flour Milling Industry= Despite arriving in Manchester in 1860 without a penny to his name, within seven years Henry had established himself as a consulting engineer with his own office and become a naturalised British Citizen.Danvers Stocks, Mary, Ernest Simon of Manchester (1963), p.4 But it was in 1878 when he saw his first real success. By introducing a rolling flour milling plant for McDougall Brothers in Manchester, the likes of which he had seen working in Switzerland, Henry set in motion and guided the 'Rollermilling Revolution', a mechanisation of the British flour milling system.Glyn Jones,The Millers(2001),p.83 Not only did this form the foundation of his own successful business, Henry Simon, converted to a limited company in 1896/7, but it also transformed the 'slow, laborious and costly' batch pattern previously used, into one of the most 'highly mechanised industries in the world'.Brian Simon, Henry Simon of Manchester ( 1997), p. 9, p.53 =Coke Ovens= In 1878 he turned his interest towards the transformation of a second industrial process; revolutionising the manufacturing of coke. A conservative and crude process, the use of 'beehive ovens' to produce a deposit of coke also caused the creation of by-products which proved harmful to the environment; posing another 'promising development' for Henry Simon to introduce a technological change.Brian Simon, Henry Simon of Manchester ( 1997), p.53 Visiting the Besseges works at Terrenoire along with a large party of engineers in 1878, Henry Simon saw the potential for the coke oven business in development by Francois Carves. He secured the patent rights to this innovative technology and in due course established a second firm alongside his already prosperous milling industry; Simon Carves. However, the conservatism of the coke industry in Britain was so profound that Henry was unable swiftly implement this revolutionary technology into the mainstream. Forced to finance the 'new-type ovens' himself, it was not until 1892 that he found a means of popularising the new method in such a manner as to allow for an advancement and expansion of the technology.Brian Simon, Henry Simon of Manchester ( 1997), p.54 Legacy In addition to his industrial activities, Simon played a major role in the educational and intellectual life of his adopted city. A great friend of his fellow countryman Charles Hallé Simon was a founding member of the Hallé Concerts Society and after Hallé's death in 1895 he was instrumental in bringing Hungarian born Hans Richter to lead the musical life of Manchester for 12 triumphant years.Michael Kennedy, The Halle Tradition (1960), p. 97 Dissatisfied with the options for educating his daughters to the same standard as his sons Simon, together with C. P. Scott, co-founded the school in the 1890s which became the celebrated Withington Girls' School. Also in 1890, Henry Simon left a note to his sons, urging them to acquire a sound technical education and to keep closely in touch with scientific developments throughout the world.required His desire for them to be in a continuous search for engineering specialities and patents which would be used to improve the efficiency of large scale industrial processes in Britain and elsewhere, has eked into the company mentality and remains a leading factor in Simon Carves Engineering's approach to business today.Anthony Simon, The Simon Engineering Group (1953), p. ix Providing a 'comprehensive range of services to the Process and Energy industries ', Simon Carves Engineering continues to exhibit a 'constant willingness to embrace new technologies, innovative project methodologies and construction methods'.Simon Carves Engineering, http://www.simoncarveseng.com/?q=about In 1898, as a leading benefactor, he was asked to lay the foundation stone for the new Physics Laboratories for Owens College, later integrated in 1903 into the Victoria University of Manchester. These laboratories were where Ernest Rutherford, Hans Geiger et al. in 1907 to 1919 laid many of the foundations of modern nuclear physics and first 'split' the atom.

After his elder brother Swargadeo Chakradhwaj Singha died in the middle of Ahom-Mughal war, Udayaditya Singha succeeded to the throne. His reign witnessed the end of Ahom-Mughal war, which started during the reign of Chakradhwaj Singha, when the Mughal army led by Rajput prince, Raja Ram Singh I of Amber, was decisively defeated by the Ahom forces led by Ahom commander Lachit Borphukan in the Battle of Saraighat. The later part of his reign was characterized by the failure of military expedition against the Dafala tribes and the influence of Paramananda Sannyasi, a saintly figure from Brindaban, over Udayaditya Singha. Udayaditya's over exerted devotion towards Paramananda Sanyasi, aroused dissatisfaction among the nobles, which ultimately caused his deposition and execution. His reign was followed by a series of political anarchy and internal disturbances in the Ahom kingdom which continued till the accession of Gadadhar Singha in 1681 CE. Ancestry and early life Udayaditya Singha was the second son of Namrupia Raja, the grandson of Sureng Deoraja,The Deoraja (as called by the Hindus) was the second son of Suhungmung who is named as either Sureng or Suleng in the Buranjis and as Phichao in the Deodhai's manuscripts. He was the Charing Raja under Suhungmung and the Tipam Raja under Suklenmung. great grandson of Ahom king Suhungmung. His grandfather Sureng Deo Raja was the founder of the Charingia branch of Royal Ahom Dynasty. Sureng Deo Raja was a valliant warrior, who fought many battles in military expedition against Chutiya Kingdom and Kachari kingdom during the reign of his father Suhungmung. He also fought against the invading forces of Koch kingdom led by Chilarai during the reign of his elder brother Suklenmung and his nephew Sukhaamphaa. The early name of Udayaditya Singha was Maju Gohain. When his elder brother Chakradhwaj Singha ascended the throne, Maju Gohain was appointed as Charingia Raja, a post usually held by the heir apparent to the throne. Accession Swargadeo Chakradhwaj Singha died of dropsy in April 1670 CE. The heir apparent to the throne, Maju Gohain was proclaimed as the king of Ahom Kingdom. The Hindu priests and Brahmins named him as Swargadeo Udayaditya Singha, while the Tai-Ahom priests conferred on him the title Sunyatphaa. Reign =War with the Mughals= Udayaditya Singha ascended the throne at a time when the Ahom-Mughal war that started during the reign of his elder brother Swargadeo Chakradhwaj Singha was at its climax. The Mughal army led by the Rajput king Raja Ram Singh I of Amber was desperately trying to conquer the military outpost of Guwahati, while the Ahom forces led by Lachit Borphukan and Atan Burhagohain was bravely defending it against all odds. Raja Ram Singh I sent a proposal to the Lachit Borphukan, that if the Ahoms surrender the garrison of Guwahati in favour of Mughals, he gave his word that the Mughals will respect the boundary of Ahom kingdom which was set according to the treaty of Asura Ali in 1639 CE. The long continuance of hostilities without any decisive result produced some discontent in the Ahom camp. The demand of Ram Singh I thus, received a more encouraging response from Lachit Borphukan and his lieutenants. The proposal was sent to Swargadeo Udayaditya Singha for final decision. The king held consultation with all the nobles. While most of them are in favour of the proposal, the Prime Minister of Ahom kingdom, Atan Burhagohain opposed this proposal stating that the resistance which they had offered to the enemy and which caused such loss of men and provisions was absolutely meaningless if it was followed by their voluntary surrender of Guwahati. He also characterized the promises made by Ram Singh I as a highway made of ashes as they might not be accepted by the Mughal Emperor Aurangzeb, or by the next Mughal commander who will succeed Ram Singh I. Swargadeo Udayaditya Singha confirmed the views of the Premier Atan Burhagohain and directed the commanders to bring the war to a victorious conclusion. When the Ahom rejected the proposal of Ram Singh I, the latter in desperation commanded a contingent of his cavalry to cross the Brahmaputra in boats and enter the plains of Guwahati by breaking through the opening at the Andharubali rampart. The Ahom commander Lachit Borphukan was seriously ill at that time and the Ahom army was demoralized by the absence of their general. On the sight of Mughal boats sailing towards Guwahati, the Ahom forces began to retreat without any fight. When the general Lachit Borphukan learnt about this he himself came to the battle scene and boarded his boat accompanied by six other war vessel and rushed towards the enemy with his seven boats. The appearance of Lachit Borphukan filled the soldiers with enthusiasm and courage. The retreating Ahom army and fleet joined their general and fell upon the invading Mughal forces. The Ahom war vessels entered into the thick of Mughal fleet and in the fight that ensued, the Mughals were completely defeated and the Ahoms gained a decisive victory. This battle is known in the history as the Battle of Saraighat, which occurred in the middle of March, 1671 CE. The Mughal forces were chased till Manas River and the Ahoms retained their possessions of Guwahati and Kamrup. Hadira, opposite Goalpara, now became the Ahom kingdom's western frontier outpost. Swargadeo Udayaditya Singha was overjoyed by this victory and he offered handsome rewards to all the generals of the victorious Ahom army. For their support and services rendered to Ahom forces in driving out the Mughal invaders, the Koch princes, Chandra Narayan, son of Mahendra Narayan, grandson of Bali Narayan, was installed as tributary ruler of Darrang, and Gandharva Narayan, was installed as the tributary ruler of Beltola. Unfortunately Lachit Borphukan who was in high fever during the battle against Mughals died soon after his memorable triumph at Saraighat. His elder brother Laluk Sola was appointed as the new Borphukan at Guwahati. Most of the prominent nobles like Atan Burhagohain remained in Guwahati in order to repel any possible Mughals invasion in Lower Assam =Fire in the Royal Stores= In 1671 CE, a treasure house at Hilikha, containing a great store of gold and silver, was burnt down. Enquiry showed that the Bharali Barua, the officer in charge of the store-house was responsible for the fire, which was caused by his carelessly leaving a lighted pipe near some inflammable material. As a punishment for his carelessness, Bharali Barua was compelled to smoke elephant's dung. =Dafala expedition= The Dafala tribe was living in the hills to the north of present-day Lakhimpur district and Sonitpur district. They use to come down to the plains on marauding excursions when they would capture Assamese people and properties. The Dafalas were however kept in check by the grant of blackmail from the Ahom rulers and by permission to use the services of the Dafala-Bahatias who were formed into a penal colony settled along the foot of the Dafala hills. The Dafalas now complained that they were on the verge of starvation owing to the long delay in the delivery of the stipulated blackmail and the payment of the taxes due from the Bahatias. Therefore, under the leadership of Bar Gam, Radha Gam, Tami Gam and Bakara Gam (the title Gam means leader or chief), the Dafalas raided a village called Gagaldubi and killed three Assamese persons, and carried off forty persons including women and children. Swargadeo Udayaditya Singha immediately arranged an expedition under Ghorakonwar Borbarua to capture and punish the Dafala raiders. The Prime Minister Atan Burhagohain tried to dissuade the monarch stating reasons that the Dafalas lived in inaccessible villages situated in the midst of dense forest and steep mountain defiles, and the hill-men could always evade the pursuers by flying from one shelter to another. The Premier instructed Udayaditya Singha to use tact and diplomacy instead of military force. But the monarch ignored the advice of Atan Burhagohain, and dispatched Ghorakonwar Borbarua against the Dafalas at the head of a considerable force. In May 1672 CE, the Borbarua crossed the Subansiri River and halted at Rangamati from where he shifted his camp to Dulungmukh. Two Assamese officers, Tua and Tita were dispatched to bring the Dafalas to submission. The agents of Dafala chief Bakara Gam met Tua and Tita and expressed regrets for having acted disloyally against the Ahom monarch. Tua and Tita offered to secure pardon for the Dafalas, first from the Borbarua and then from the Swargadeo, and asked them to proceed to the presence of the Borbarua to pay their respects to him. The Dafalas however hesitated to appear before the Borbarua, fearing punishment under Royal orders. Their leader Bakara Gam now appeared on the scene with fifty-two followers and continued the parleys with Tua and Tita. Bakara Gam realized the insecurity of his position, and said, “The Borbarua has come to kill us. How will it be possible on the part of elephants to proceed by paths meant for the passage of dogs and jackals?” Tua and Tita sent a secret message through Ramdhan Ganak Hatkhowa to Ghorakonwar Borbarua asking him to fall upon the Dafalas during the continuance of the negotiations. The Borbarua sent a force who proceeded by boat, but the Dafalas had meanwhile left the venue on the pretext of coming back with the men and goods captured by them from the Assamese. The king accused Tua and Tita for having put the Borbarua on a wrong track and had them chained with iron fetters and imprisoned. The rains then set in, and the Borbarua was compelled to suspend operations which were made more difficult by inaccessible character of the terrain. The king threatened to kill Borbarua if he returned to the capital without subdueing the Dafalas. He even asked the Borbarua to wear the skirt of woman in the event of his further inaction. Having heard this the Borbarua came from Dulungmukh to Barchetia and then to Gangmukh, from where he sent a number of detachments under Khaga Hazarika, Kharagom, Chutia-kari Barua and Chungi Barua who proceeded by different routes against the Dafalas. But the Ahom troops could not make any headway for difficulties of communications aggravated by the torrential showers of the monsoon season. Finally when they reached the villages of the Dafalas, they found it empty, as the Dafalas had already evacuated them for safer destinations. As the Ahom soldiers were about to return, they were attacked by the Dafalas who had concealed themselves in the neighbouring jungles. The Ahom soldiers seized with panic dispersed down the slope of the mountains. Large numbers were massacred by the Dafalas, some were carried off as slaves, and the rest were chased down to the plains. The Ahom officers Khaga Hazarika and Khragom were among the slain. The Borbarua then returned to his camp at Barchetia. The King attributed this reverse to neglect and mismanagement on the part of Ghorakonwar Borbarua. He instructed the chief of his personal body-guards, Papang Chaodang Barua, to arrest the Borbarua and kept him as a prisoner in the Hatisal or Elephant stalls. The king accused the Borbarua of dereliction of duty and ordered him to be stripped naked and put to death, but on the intercession of the Queen-mother, the life of Ghorakonwar Borbarua was spared. But the king had him dismissed and Charingia Pelan Phukan of Rangmahal fame was appointed as the new Borbarua. After some time, Ghorakonwar was readmitted into the good graces of the king, and was made Bhitarual Phukan or the Commander of the household troops. During the following dry season the Dafala leaders returned the goods and released the captured Assamese prisoners of their own accord. =Influence of Paramananda Bairagi on Udayaditya= The later part of Udayaditya's reign was marked by the entry of Paramananda Bairagi or Sannyasi and his influence over the king. Paramananda Sannyasi hailed from Gakulpur near Brindaban. He was also known as Gakulpuri Sannyasi among common Assamese people, owing to his origin from Gakulpur. He had first lived at Hajo with another hermit from Kalitakuchi in Kamrup. He then stayed in Kamakhya for some time. It was believed that during his stay in Kamakhya, he obtained the power to perform miracles. Charmed by his performances of miracles, a large number of people, both male and female, became disciples of the Sannyasi. He then set out on a pilgrimage to Brahmakunda in Eastern Assam, and stayed for sometime at Kalabari in the monastery of Banmali Gosain. Here also the Sannyasi charmed the people by demonstrations of his occult power. The fame of Paramananda Sannyasi spread among the nobility in the capital Garhgaon. Udayaditya Singha also heard of the prowess of Paramananda Sannyasi and had him brought to the Royal Palace. Udayaditya was very much impressed with the miracles performed by the Sannyasi and also by his knowledge on religious topics. The king became greatly devoted to Paramananda, considered him as Guru or religious mentor and constructed for him a large monastery near the entrance of the Capital known as Chunpora-duar. With the view to enhance his Guru's respect, he ordered all the Royal officers to become disciples of Paramananda Sannyasi. Forced by Royal orders, the three Dangarias or ministers, Atan Burhagohain, Baghchowal Borpatrogohain and Langichang Borgohain and Laithepena Solal Gohain and many Phukans, Rajkhowas and Baruas became disciples of Paramananada Sannyasi. The Sannyasi claimed to know, while sitting at his own Chunpora residence, everything that the king said or did in his palace. Claims of this nature enabled the Sannyasi to exercise great sway over the mind of the king and his court. =Atrocities on the Vaishnava Mahantas= Swargadeo Udayaditya Singha became greatly devoted to Paramananda Sannyasi, and in his eagerness to advance the prestige and influence of Paramananda summoned the twelve Vaishanava Mahantas or religious heads of the Thakuria denomination and asked them to become disciples of the Gakulpuri Sannyasi. The Mahantas protested in a body; and their leaders, the Mahantas of Mayamara, Makajan, Silikhatal and Sesamukh were thrown into prison from where, the king said, they would be released only if they could satisfy him about their spiritual prowess by performing some miracle. The Mahantas replied in one voice,- We are incapable of performing miracles. We pass our days in reciting and hearing the glory of the Great God, and in offering prayers for Your Majesty’s welfare. Except this everything else is beyond our ken.The king reiterated his conviction of the omniscience of his Guru Paramananda and the consequent propriety on the part of the Mahantas to become the Sannyasi's disciples. The Thakuria Mahantas now stood as one man determined to oppose the king's design to convert them to the discipleship of the Paramananda. In this they received the tacit support of the three Gohains who thought that the time for their intervention had arrived. =Anti- Paramananda Movement led by Debera Hazarika= Debera was a member of the Ahom Lukhurakhun clan, and he held the rank of a Hazarika, commander of one thousand men. He was the son of Kharagom, the Ahom officer who had been killed in the Dafala campaign in 1672 CE. Debera was very much enraged by the atrocities committed on the Vaishnava Mahantas by Udayaditya Singha. He resolved to curb the influence of the Sannyasi and preserve the integrity and prestige of the Vaisnava monks of Assam. Being himself a disciple of Makajan Mahanta of the Thakuria denomination, he knelt down before the Mahantas and solicited their blessings for the success of his enterprise, saying,- “Your Holinesses should only bestow upon me the dust of your feet, and I shall do whatever redress is necessary.” The king got scent of the mischief that was brewing against him and his protégé; and with the object of keeping Debera away from the capital for some time he ordered him to command an expedition against the Mishmi rebels living near Sadiya. Debera was witty enough to understand the real intension of the monarch, and informed the king that he would start on the expedition after three days as he was convalescent at that time having just recovered from polypus of the nose. On that very night, Debera met the three Dangarias and persuaded them to support Sarugohain, the younger brother of Swargadeo Udayaditya Singha, in his attempt to seize the throne. Debera then broached the proposal to Sarugohain who readily accepted the offer. The prince gave vent to his resentment on the conduct of Udayaditya Singha,-“The Bairagi has become to my brother, not a mere hermit, but an object of extreme veneration, the Saheb of his head. The Dangarias have also accepted initiation from the Bairagi, and the twelve Mahantas have been summoned. Justice cannot tolerate this impious situation.” With the help of Debera and his brother Mohan Deka, Ratanpuria Hazarika, Namgila Hazarika and Tairai Dolakasharia Barua, Sarugohain collected one thousand armed followers to assail and surround the royal residence at Haithaguri and seized the person of the reigning monarch. Meanwhile, Udayaditya got scent of the conspiracy and at once ordered the gates of the city closed and his brother to be arrested. The conspirators decided that they got no time to lose, and therefore decided to act quickly. =Palace Coup and Udayaditya deposed= In November 1672 CE, Sarugohain and his supporters fully armed approached the palace at mid night. They requested the Chief of the guards, guarding the entrance, Pacha-Simalu Hazarika of Dimaruguria unit to open the gate. But Pacha Simalu Hazarika refused to let the conspirators in. Debera asked Gajpuria Hatibarua, the officer-in-charge of elephants and Parikshit Dhekeri Mahout, the elephant rider, to employ elephants to break the gates of the Palace. The elephants broke open the gates and the conspirators entered inside the Palace compound. The entrance guards and their chief Pacha Simalu Hazarika, after offering some resistance, were killed by the conspirators. Sarugohain, accompanied by other conspirators marched towards the Royal Audience Hall. Charingia Pelan Borbarua, Charingia Barua and Papang Chaodang Barua, along with their men rushed forward to resist the conspirators led by Sarugohain, but they were over-powered, after offering some resistance. Sarugohain hurled his spear at the Borbarua and pierced him at the thigh. The Prince then inflicted the finishing blows on the Borbarua and killed the Chaodang Barua as well. Swargadeo Udayaditya Singha, soundly asleep in his bed, heard faintly the uproar and commotion outside, but the body-guard on duty in the Royal bed- chamber, who had already been tutored by Debera, informed the monarch that the disturbance was due to the elephants coming out of their stalls, and the attempt made by the Borbarua to bring them round. The king was satisfied with the answer, and refrained from making further enquiries. Meanwhile, Sarugohain stationed himself at the king's audience-chamber, and dispatched men to guard the several gates of the palace compound. Debera and Mohan deka removed the ladder leading to the royal apartments. Those who opposed Sarugohain and Debera were instantly put to death. Having besieged Udayaditya Singha in his bed chamber and making it impossible for him to escape, Sarugohain seated in the audience hall, declared himself to be king. Ghorakonwar Bhitarual Phukan who had assisted Sarugohain in his bid for the throne was immediately re- elevated to the office of Borbarua. Many royal officers, except Hari Borpatrogohain came and offered their allegiance to the new king. Hari Borpatrogohain was dismissed from his office. Sarugohain appointed one of his loyal followers, Chapa as the new Borpatrogohain. Death of Udayaditya and Paramananda Sannyasi On the following day Udayaditya Singha was placed on a sedan and led to Charaideo Hill. His mother beseeched Sarugohain to spare the life of Udayaditya, or kill her along with the deposed monarch. Sarugohain consoled his mother saying that he and his brother would exercise joint domination, he from his headquarters at Garhgaon and Udayaditya from his capital Charaideo. Udayaditya was put to death soon after his arrival in Charaideo. Before he breathed his last he had put a handful of rice in his mouth and said,--“An innocent is being killed! O, Great God, may retribution descend on him who is committing this crime!” Some sources states that the king was poisoned by Debera. The three wives of Udayaditya were also put to death. Udayaditya Singha's Guru, Paramananda Sannyasi, who had unwittingly caused the revolution, was arrested by Sarugohain and Debera. He was subjected to various tortures, insults and humiliations, and later put to death. His corpse was placed on a raft and set adrift on the Dikhow River, as a warning to others who ever schemed to set up a new order. Legacy Swargadeo Udayaditya Singha's reign was remarkable chiefly for the expulsion of invading Mughal forces from Kamrup and the victory of Ahoms in the Battle of Saraighat. By this time, the Ahoms were able to make their own cannon, as cannons manufactured during his reign were found in Guwahati. The Bairagi Ali or road in Upper Assam was constructed during his reign. Contemporary historians remarked that he lacked the strength and intelligence of his elder brother Swargadeo Chakradhwaj Singha, yet one must not forget that he extended full supports and aids to the Ahom generals in Guwahati who were fighting against the Mughal invaders. While it reflected his fighting spirit and determination, but subsequent events also showed that he was stubborn and lacked the knowledge of political diplomacy and military skills. The military disaster in the campaign against the Dafalas proves it. His stubbornness to bring the old Vaishnava Mahantas or Monks of Assam under the influence of Paramananda Sannyasi was a political blunder of highest magnitude which ultimately cost him his throne and his life. The political unrest and anarchy which began during his reign will continue for another few years, which will be considered as one of the dark chapters in the history of Ahom kingdom, as kings became mere puppets in the hands of powerful ministers who will install and depose king at will. The period of ministerial supremacy will continue till 1681 CE, when Gadadhar Singha from Tungkhungia line of Ahom Dynasty ascended the throne and put an end to the domination of ministers over the monarch.

Nguni people who migrated to the area brought cattle with them and Khoisan people had been raising indigenous varieties of sheep for thousands of years. European settlers introduced new varieties of livestock, many of which have become important on South African rangelands.  Cattle  In South Africa, both beef and dairy cattle are commercially important. Beef herds are most significant in The Eastern Cape and in KwaZulu- Natal, where communal cattle farming is still widely practiced. Commercial dairy farming is practiced in areas including Western Cape and the Free State. Holstein, Jersey, and Ayrshire are the most popular breeds of commercial dairy cattle.  Sheep  When Europeans first arrived in South Africa, the raising of fat-tailed sheep was well established over much of the present day territory. Indigenous sheep breeds, which were raised more for meat than wool, include the Damara, Zulu, and Pedi sheep. During the 1800s, British settlers introduced Merino sheep, which precipitated a brief commercial wool-boom in the Cape Colony.

Auerbach (born December 3, 1958) is a private equity investor known for his leadership role in clean energy investment. He co-founded Hudson Clean Energy Partners, a global private equity firm that invests exclusively in clean energy, and co-founded the U.S. alternative energy investment business within the Special Situations Group at Goldman Sachs & Co. Education and Early Career Auerbach was born and raised in New York City. He began his education in the New York City public school system and then attended the State University of New York at Albany, where he earned a B.S. He went on to attend Boston University School of Law, where he earned a J.D., and New York University School of Law, where he earned an LL.M. in Taxation. After working at several law firms in his early career, Auerbach was named Partner at McDermott, Will & Emery (1991-1992) and then served as Branch Chief, Assistant to the Associate Chief Counsel of the Internal Revenue Service (1992-1994). Auerbach launched his banking career at Morgan Stanley (1995-1997) as Principal (Co-Head) of a joint venture between the firm’s Derivatives & Debt Capital Markets groups and went on to become Managing Director and Head of Structured Capital Markets at Barclays Capital (1997-1999). Goldman Sachs After working in the Debt Capital Markets and Credit Derivatives units at Goldman Sachs, Auerbach joined Goldman’s Special Situations Group in December 2003. He began to focus on the renewable energy industry in the U.S. and went on to launch the alternative energy investment business within the Special Situations Group with a principal focus on wind and solar energy. During Auerbach’s tenure in the Group, he invested over $1.5 billion of firm capital in wind energy, solar energy, and biofuel companies and established a track record of developing, closing, and funding unique structured financings. Auerbach led several of Goldman’s most successful renewable energy investments, including Horizon Wind Energy, SunEdison, and First Solar. Hudson Clean Energy In 2007, Auerbach was joined by another Goldman colleague with whom he co-founded Hudson Clean Energy Partners, an independent private equity firm. Auerbach currently serves as Co-Managing Partner with John Cavalier, who joined Hudson as Co-Managing Partner in 2008 from Credit Suisse’s Global Energy Group, where he was Chairman. Hudson has over $1 billion in assets and invests in sectors that include wind, solar, and hydroelectric energy, biofuels, biomass, smart grid, electric vehicles, energy efficiency, and storage. Hudson’s inaugural fund, Hudson Clean Energy Partners, L.P., held a final close above its target in 2009 at $1.024 billion and was one of the few first-time funds to exceed its target amount, despite adverse global economic and market conditions due to the financial crisis. Since the fund’s inception, Hudson sold its stake in Recurrent Energy to Sharp Corporation of Japan. In 2011, Hudson Clean Energy Partners expanded into China, opening an office in Beijing and appointing Zhongmin Shen as Head of China Operations. As part of its expansion into China, Hudson announced plans to establish an RMB fund to invest in China’s clean energy markets in partnership with The Yangzhou Municipal Government Financial Affairs Office. According to Hudson, the joint venture will enable substantial new investment in China, help harness the country’s manufacturing prowess, and bring foreign technologies to China’s domestic market. In 2012, Hudson Clean Energy Partners purchased a minority stake in GSE Investment Corporation (GSEI), a Chinese company operating in the waste-to-energy and wastewater treatment space. Policy Initiatives As a former Commissioner of the National Commission on Energy Policy (Bipartisan Policy Center), Auerbach has advocated bipartisan support for U.S. clean energy legislation, developed in-depth policy recommendations, and participated in a commission consisting of a private, bipartisan, and diverse group of leading energy experts and stakeholders. Auerbach was also an early supporter of the tax equity market as a significant driver of the expansion of U.S. renewable energy. He has stated that it has had a positive impact in the areas of utility‐scale wind power generation and commercial‐scale solar facilities. In 2011, Auerbach testified in front of the U.S. Senate Committee on Energy and Natural Resources, the U.S. House Energy and Commerce Sub-Committee on Energy and Power, and the U.S. House Committee on Ways and Means, proposing a market-based approach for the federal government to encourage large-scale deployment of clean energy in the U.S. Auerbach has supported the development and implementation of reverse auctions as an innovative approach to support the continued growth of the renewable energy sector that has met success in other industries and recently in the renewable energy industry in Brazil, Argentina, Mexico, Peru, Honduras, Uruguay, China, Morocco, and Egypt. Affiliations Auerbach is a member of the Leadership Council, ACORE, and also serves on the Executive Committee of ACORE’s Partnership for Renewable Energy Finance (US PREF). Auerbach is a member of the U.S. Council on Competitiveness, the Brookings China Center, and was formerly a Commissioner of the National Commission on Energy Policy.

It operated from July 1940 to February 1944, with a maximum capacity of 160 people. There were Jewish and Slavic refugees interned from the Balkans in this camp. History Two buildings in Nereto, the house owned by Silvio Santoni in Viale Vittorio Veneto 39 and that owned by Carine Lupins in alley Scarfoglio 4, were seen as possible sites for the camp in June 1940. Subsequently, in December 1940 it was added to the Agricultural Consortium (called \\"Palazzo bacologico\\") in Rome Avenue. The camp was used to collect Jewish and Slavic refugees. The management of the camp was in charge of the Secretary of Fascist Culture and Mario Marzi from July 1, 1940. From June 31, 1941, Commissioner Pasquale took over. The supervision was entrusted to the police and health matters to Dr. Bruno Marsili and then Dr. Salutanzi. The first inmates arrived in July 1940. The living conditions were poor. There were inspections from the Red Cross and the inmates received international aid from the Delegation for the Assistance of Jewish Emigrants (DELASEM). However, the buildings offered poor sanitation. Lupini House and the Palace bacologico in particular were dilapidated buildings. After September 8, 1943, the building of the Agricultural Consortium was evacuated to house German troops. On December 21, 1943, the German command demanded from the Italian authorities the delivery of all Jewish internees. Sixty-one Jews were handed over to them by the police and deported to the death camps. With the exception of seven inmates who escaped on December 27, 1943. Those who remained in the camp were now on the edge of survival. The approach of the allied army caused the permanent closure of the field on February 1, 1944, with the transfer of the remaining sixty-nine inmates to Corropoli internment camp.

The article itself discussed Deal's previous financial issues and an ethics investigation of Deal. The photograph received criticism from members of both political parties. Pedro Marin, a state representative belonging to the Democratic Party and, at the time, one of Georgia's two Hispanic legislators, criticized the doctored photograph. Brian Robinson, Deal's spokesperson, said \\"Those who can't formulate a coherent argument in our society's marketplace of ideas often resort to childish, even offensive tactics.

Navarro said that the newspaper used the image to represent fear in Hispanic immigrants due to Deal's speeches against immigration during his previous election campaign.

Gaudio grew up in Cleveland, Ohio and attended college at Ohio State University, where he played as a guard for two seasons interrupted by service in World War II. He then joined the Browns, playing under head coach Paul Brown for three seasons before retiring. The Browns won the AAFC championship in each of Gaudio's years with the team. He came out of retirement to play a final season in Cleveland in 1951. After football, Gaudio worked for his family's construction business in Chagrin Falls, Ohio and later moved to Miami, Florida to start a construction business. He died in Miami in 2003. High school and college career Gaudio attended Shaw High School in East Cleveland, Ohio and was a star guard on the school's football team for three seasons. He then enrolled at Ohio State University, continuing as a guard on the Ohio State Buckeyes football team beginning as a freshman in 1942. Gaudio was set to play in 1943 under head coach Paul Brown, but instead joined the Army Air Force during World War II. Professional football career Gaudio returned to Ohio State after the war for the 1946 season. He then worked in the construction business with his father before joining the Cleveland Browns in the All-America Football Conference in the summer of 1947, despite having two years of college eligibility left. He barely made the team, but Brown, who had become the first coach of the Browns, called Gaudio \\"technically perfect\\" and said he had the speed and agility he wanted in a guard. As part of Cleveland's offensive line, Gaudio helped protect quarterback Otto Graham and open up running room for fullback Marion Motley. He was used primarily in his first season as a defensive lineman, but played increasingly on offense the following year after assistant coach Blanton Collier praised his technique in an annual review of film from the previous season. He played more snaps in 1948 than veteran guard Lin Houston. \\"Lin hasn't lost his touch, he's just as good as ever,\\" Browns guard coach Fritz Heisler said at the time. \\"But this fellow Gaudio has been doing a terrific job for us and we just can't keep him off the field.\\" Helped by strong line play, Cleveland finished the 1947 season with a 12–1–1 record and defeated the New York Yankees to win the AAFC championship. The team won the championship again in 1948, winning all of its games and turning in professional football's first perfect season. The Browns again won the AAFC championship in 1949, but the league dissolved after the season and the Browns were absorbed by the more established National Football League (NFL). Gaudio retired after the 1949 season, when he was 24 years old. He came out of retirement to play for the Browns in 1951. After the team lost the NFL championship game to the Los Angeles Rams, he retired for a second time to focus on his family's construction business. Later life and death Gaudio settled in Chagrin Falls, Ohio and by the late 1950s was the vice president of the National Construction Company, a sewer contractor. He worked in the business with his father and two of his brothers, Anthony and Harry. He later started a construction company in Miami, Florida and owned J&B; Gaudio Farms in Ocala, Florida. He helped found the Ocala Breeders' Sales Company, a thoroughbred racehorse auction firm, contributing a $250,000 personal loan. He died in 2003.

Cities in the United States were traditionally made up of low-rise buildings, but significant economic growth after the Civil War and increasingly intensive use of urban land encouraged the development of taller buildings beginning in the 1870s. Technological improvements enabled the construction of fireproofed iron-framed structures with deep foundations, equipped with new inventions such as the elevator and electric lighting. These made it both technically and commercially viable to build a new class of taller buildings, the first of which, Chicago's tall Home Insurance Building, opened in 1885. Their numbers grew rapidly, and by 1888 they were being labelled skyscrapers. Chicago initially led the way in skyscraper design, with many constructed in the center of the financial district during the late 1880s and early 1890s. Sometimes termed the products of the Chicago school of architecture, these skyscrapers attempted to balance aesthetic concerns with practical commercial design, producing large, square palazzo-styled buildings hosting shops and restaurants on the ground level and containing rentable offices on the upper floors. In contrast, New York's skyscrapers were frequently narrower towers which, more eclectic in style, were often criticized for their lack of elegance. In 1892, Chicago banned the construction of new skyscrapers taller than , leaving the development of taller buildings to New York. A new wave of skyscraper construction emerged in the first decade of the 20th century. The demand for new office space to hold America's expanding workforce of white-collar staff continued to grow. Engineering developments made it easier to build and live in yet taller buildings. Chicago built new skyscrapers in its existing style, while New York experimented further with tower design. Iconic buildings such as the Flatiron were followed by the tall Singer Tower, the Metropolitan Life Insurance Company Tower and the Woolworth Building. Though these skyscrapers were commercial successes, criticism mounted as they broke up the ordered city skyline and plunged neighboring streets and buildings into perpetual shadow. Combined with an economic downturn, this led to the introduction of zoning restraints in New York in 1916. In the interwar years, skyscrapers spread to nearly all major U.S. cities, while a handful were built in other Western countries. The economic boom of the 1920s and extensive real estate speculation encouraged a wave of new skyscraper projects in New York and Chicago. New York City's 1916 Zoning Resolution helped shape the Art Deco or \\"set-back\\" style of skyscrapers, leading to structures that focused on volume and striking silhouettes, often richly decorated. Skyscraper heights continued to grow, with the Chrysler and the Empire State Building each claiming new records, reaching and respectively. With the onset of the Great Depression, the real estate market collapsed, and new builds stuttered to a halt. Popular and academic culture embraced the skyscraper through films, photography, literature, and ballet, seeing the buildings as either positive symbols of modernity and science, or alternatively examples of the ills of modern life and society. Skyscraper projects after World War II typically rejected the designs of the early skyscrapers, instead embracing the international style; many older skyscrapers were redesigned to suit contemporary tastes or even demolished—such as the Singer Tower, once the world's tallest skyscraper. Background: 1850–1879 =Commercial and social drivers= Early skyscrapers emerged in the U.S. as a result of economic growth, the financial organization of American businesses, and the intensive use of land. New York was one of the centers of early skyscraper construction and had a history as a key seaport located on the small island of Manhattan, on the east coast of the U.S. As a consequence of its colonial history and city planning, New York real estate was broken up into many small parcels of land, with few large sites. During the first half of the 19th century it became the national center of American finance, and the banks in the financial district of Manhattan competed fiercely with English institutions for international dominance. The Great Fire of 1835 destroyed most of the old financial buildings, and in their place a wide variety of new buildings were erected and demolished in quick succession during the 1840s and 1850s; traveler Philip Hone suggested that the entire city was being rebuilt every decade.; Most buildings adopted the Italian Renaissance inspired palazzo-style of architecture popular in England, and rose no more than five or six stories.; New York did not have any restrictions on the height of buildings, but in practice low-rise buildings were the norm, at least until 1865, with the tallest buildings being the city's churches.; ; New York's population tripled between 1840 and 1870, and property values soared, increasing by more than 90 percent between 1860 and 1875. Currier and Ives' 1874 map of Chicago shows low-rise buildings constructed after the fire of 1871 Further west, the city of Chicago became the other major site in the development of early skyscrapers. In contrast to New York, Chicago emerged as a major metropolis only in the mid-19th century, growing from a village of around fifty inhabitants in 1830, to a city of 30,000 in 1850 and nearly 300,000 by 1870. Chicago became the railroad hub for the American West and the primary trading city for the emerging territories, famous for its commercial culture.; It saw itself as different from the cities on the east coast and was immensely proud of its status as a growing, vibrant center. By the 1870s, Chicago had become the main financial center for the West, but in October 1871 the Great Chicago Fire destroyed the majority of the wooden structures within the city.; ; The city was rebuilt on large plots of land in a new grid network; and followed new city ordinances that prohibited construction in wood.; These factors encouraged the building of taller properties in new innovative designs, which, like New York, saw a range of businesses and services being packed into single buildings.; The construction of taller buildings during the 1870s was hindered by the financial Panic of 1873 and the ensuing economic depression, which lasted until around 1879. Construction slowed, and property values slumped. By 1880, however, the recovery was well underway, with new construction in New York returning to the pace of 1871, and the economic upturn making the construction of taller buildings an attractive financial option again, establishing many of the preconditions for the development of the skyscraper.; =Technological developments= Produce Exchange of 1884 made structural advances in metal frame design. The emergence of skyscrapers was made possible by technological improvements during the middle of the 19th century. One of these developments was the iron framed building. Masonry buildings supported their internal floors through their walls, but the taller the building, the thicker the walls had to become, particularly at the base. In the 1860s, French engineers experimented with using built-up plate girders made of wrought iron to construct buildings supported by internal metal frames. These frames were stronger than traditional masonry and permitted much thinner walls. The methodology was extensively described in engineering journals and was initially used to build warehouses. Using these metal frames for taller buildings, however, meant exposing them to increased wind pressure. As a consequence, protective wind bracing had to be introduced, enabled by the work of Augustin-Jean Fresnel who produced equations for calculating the loads and moments on larger buildings. Metal-framed buildings were also vulnerable to fire and required special fireproofing. French engineers had made advances in this area in the early 19th century, and major breakthroughs came with the work of architect Peter Wight in the 1860s. Spurred on by the catastrophic fires in Chicago in 1871 and Boston in 1872, his findings were turned into a wide variety of patented fireproofing products during the 1870s. Taller, heavier buildings such as skyscrapers also required stronger foundations than smaller buildings. Earlier buildings had typically rested their foundations on rubble, which was in turn laid down on the soft top layer of the ground called the overburden. As buildings became taller and heavier, the overburden could not support their weight, and foundations increasingly needed to rest directly on the bedrock below. In both New York and Chicago this required digging down a considerable distance through soft soil and often below the water table, risking the hole filling up with water before the foundations were complete. The deeper the foundations needed to be, the greater the challenge. Special water-tight boxes called caissons were invented to deal with this problem in England in 1830 and adopted in the U.S. during the 1850s and 1860s. caisson foundations, 1898 The development of the elevator was also essential to the emergence of the early skyscrapers, as office buildings taller than around six stories would have been impractical without them.; Powered elevators were first installed in England during the 1830s and spread to U.S. factories and hotels by the 1840s. Elevators using hoist ropes, however, could only function effectively in low-rise buildings, and this limitation encouraged the introduction of the hydraulic elevator in 1870, even though early models contained dangerous design flaws. By 1876 these problems had been resolved, providing a solution for servicing the early skyscrapers.; New environmental technologies in heating, lighting, ventilation and sanitation were also critical to creating taller buildings that were attractive to work in. Central heating could not be easily extended to serve larger buildings; in the 1850s, a system using low-pressure steam and steam-operated fans became adopted in the construction of the later skyscrapers. Many U.S. buildings were lit by gas, but this carried safety risks and was difficult to install in taller buildings. As an alternative, electric lights were installed from 1878 onwards, powered by basement generators. Ventilation was also a challenge, as smoke drifting into offices from the streets and the fumes from the gas lighting made air quality a major health issue. A steam-driven, forced-draft ventilation system was invented in 1860 and became widely used in taller buildings by the 1870s, overcoming much of the problem. Improvements in iron piping permitted running hot and cold water and sanitation facilities to be installed throughout taller buildings for the first time. Emergence of the skyscraper: 1880–1899 =The first skyscraper= Chicago's Home Insurance Building in 1884, often considered the world's first skyscraper There is academic disagreement over which building should be considered the first skyscraper.; The term was first used in the 1780s to describe a particularly tall horse, before later being applied to the sail at the top of a ship's mast, tall hats and bonnets, tall men, and a ball that was hit high into the air. In the 1880s it began to be applied to buildings, first in 1883 to describe large public monuments and then in 1889 as a label for tall office blocks, coming into widespread use over the next decade.; Identifying the first \\"true skyscraper\\" is not straightforward, and various candidates exist depending on the criteria applied. George Post's New York Equitable Life Building of 1870, for example, was the first tall office building to use the elevator, while his Produce Exchange building of 1884 made substantial structural advances in metal frame design.; The Home Insurance Building in Chicago, opened in 1885, is, however, most often labelled the first skyscraper because of its innovative use of structural steel in a metal frame design.; ; The Home Insurance Building was a tall, 10-story skyscraper designed by William Le Baron Jenney, who had been trained as an engineer in France and was a leading architect in Chicago.; Jenney's design was unusual in that it incorporated structural steel into the building's internal metal frame alongside the traditional wrought iron. This frame took the weight of the floors of the building and helped to support the weight of the external walls as well, proving an important step towards creating the genuine non-structural curtain walls that became a feature of later skyscrapers. The design was not perfect – some of the weight was still carried by masonry walls, and the metal frame was bolted, rather than riveted, together – but it was clearly a significant advance in tall building construction. The approach quickly caught on in Chicago. In 1889 the Tacoma Building replaced the bolted metal design with a stronger riveted approach, and Chicago's Chamber of Commerce Building introduced interior light courts to the structural design of skyscrapers. The 1890 Rand McNally Building became the first entirely self-supporting, steel- framed skyscraper. Some buildings, such as The Rookery and the Monadnock Building, combined elements of both the newer and older styles, but generally Chicago rapidly adopted steel structures as a flexible and effective way to produce a range of tall buildings. Structural engineers specializing in the steel frame design began to establish practices in Chicago. Park Row in New York had several early skyscrapers built for newspaper companies clustered around the City Hall There was a boom in skyscraper construction in Chicago from 1888 onwards. By 1893, Chicago had built 12 skyscrapers between 16 and 20 stories tall, tightly clustered in the center of the financial district.; Chicago's skyscrapers, however, were constrained by the contemporary limits of steel-frame design and the muddy sub-soil in the city, which together limited most of their skyscrapers to around 16 or 17 stories. Chicago's skyscrapers rapidly became tourist destinations for the views of the wider city they provided from their upper floors and as attractive sites in their own right. Tourists were advised to hire cabs for street tours of the skyscrapers – by lying back in the cab, they would be able to safely take in the tops of the tall buildings. The Masonic Temple was the most prominent of these skyscrapers. Built by the Freemasons of Chicago in 1892, at a time when the Masons was a fast-growing social community, the lavish tall skyscraper had 19 stories, the bottom ten holding shops and the higher levels containing the Masons' private suites and meeting halls, some able to hold up to 1,300 people. At the top was a roof garden and observation gallery. The Freemasons were competing with their local rivals the Odd Fellows, who intended to build a much higher skyscraper, tall, that they announced would be the tallest building in the world. Newspapers picked up the story, circulating facts about the size of the Temple and making comparison to historical buildings such as the Capitol or the Statue of Liberty. The Odd Fellows project failed, but the Masonic Temple capitalized on the publicity, being declared the \\"tallest commercial building in the world\\". In comparison, New York trailed behind Chicago, having only four buildings over 16 stories tall by 1893. Part of the delay was caused by the slowness of the city authorities to authorize metal- frame construction techniques; it was not until 1889 that they relented and allowed Bradford Gilbert to construct the Tower Building, an 11-story iron- framed skyscraper.; This encouraged the building of more skyscrapers in New York, although the city remained cautious about the technology for some years.; Finally, in 1895 a breakthrough was made with the construction of the American Surety Building, a twenty-story, high-steel development that broke Chicago's height record. From then on, New York thoroughly embraced skeleton frame construction. In particular, New York newspaper companies adopted the skyscraper, building several along Park Row, sometimes termed \\"Newspaper Row\\", in the 1880s and 1890s. A few early skyscrapers were also constructed in Baltimore, Boston, Pittsburgh, St. Louis, Rochester, and Buffalo, such as the Wainwright Building, Wilder Building, and Guaranty Building.; ; refs for buildings needed. Early examples on the West Coast include the Old Chronicle Building and the Call Building in San Francisco, as well as the Luzon Building in Tacoma, Washington. =Architectural challenges= Masonic Temple Building depicted in 1909, showing the tripartite division of the building's exterior and the typical Chicago window bays The architects of early skyscrapers faced a number of challenges. The most fashionable architectural style in the late 19th century was the French Beaux-Arts movement, sometimes termed the Italian Renaissance style, which applied Classical aesthetic principles to modern buildings. American architects trained in the Beaux-Arts style at the Parisian Académie des Beaux-Arts began to return home in the 1880s, bringing these ideals and standards with them. Applying contemporary Beaux-Arts standards to early skyscrapers, however, was not straightforward. The buildings that the Beaux-Arts movement influenced were typically much shorter and broader than any skyscraper, and it was difficult to accurately reproduce the style in a tall, narrow building. Skyscrapers were also primarily commercial buildings, and economics as well as aesthetics had to play an important part in their design. The architectural writer Barr Ferree noted in 1893 that \\"current American architecture is not a matter of art, but of business. A building must pay, or there will be no investor ready with the money to meet its cost. This is at once the curse and the glory of American architecture.\\" cited George Hill echoed the theme, condemning unnecessary features on the basis that \\"every cubic foot that is used for purely ornamental purposes beyond that needed to express its use and to make it harmonize with others of its class, is a waste\\". cited By the 1890s, Chicago architects were producing a solution to this problem, creating a new architectural style, often termed the \\"Chicago school of architecture\\". The school included architects such as Louis Sullivan and Dankmar Adler, William Le Baron Jenney, John Root, and William Holabird and Martin Roche, whose designs combined architectural aesthetic theory with practical commercial sense. They favoured placing rich, ornate designs on the outside of skyscrapers at the ground level and simpler, plainer ornamentation on the upper levels, with strong vertical lines.; The roofs of their skyscrapers typically formed a comprehensible outline and structure when seen at a distance as part of the city skyline. The intent was to draw the observer's eye upwards, celebrating what Sullivan termed the \\"lofty\\" nature of the skyscraper, but not wasting resources on intricate detailing unlikely to appeal to a busy businessman.; ; Root, p.71, cited At the same time, the more lavish ground floor designs would make the building stand out to passers-by and pull in the necessary business for a successful commercial building. New York Times Building in 2012, showing the multitude of different styles on a single façade typical of the city's early skyscrapers This community also saw close collaboration between architects, specialist structural engineers, and building contractors emerge on the new skyscraper projects. Historically the industry had been dominated by individuals and small firms who combined the roles of architect and engineer, but this broke down in Chicago during the period, being replaced by a partnership between specialist architects who focused on the appearance of the skyscraper, and specialist engineers who focused on the structures that enabled it to be built. Chicago architectural firms grew to be large, hierarchical and with numerous specialist staff; the D. H. Burnham & Company, for example, felt like a small factory to visitors, and ultimately expanded to employ 180 staff. The resulting Chicago school produced large, solid-looking skyscrapers, built with a common appearance and to a common height. The result was usually a box-like palazzo, illuminated with a large light court, ideally, if space allowed, in the center. The outside of the building was commonly divided into three parts: a base, middle section and the roof line. This tripartite design was intended both to emulate classical columns, and reflect the functions of the different parts of the skyscraper. The central court could form a simple courtyard, but many companies preferred to roof over the courtyard with glass to produce an atrium for shops and restaurants. Rents for these shops were up to five or six times that for office space, and made an important difference to the income from a property. Chicago skyscraper windows were also a feature of the style; these were large, fixed windows flanked by smaller sash windows on either side, which provided access to sunlight and adequate ventilation. Sometimes these protruded from the building to form a slight bay. Although the exterior of the Chicago skyscrapers buildings were relatively plain, the entrance ways and lobbies were fitted out in a grand style. The Unity Building, for example, was reported as including \\"Numidian, Alps, Green and Sienna marbles ... an artistic screen of glass and bronze ... a marble balcony\\" alongside \\"Corinthian columns with finely carved capitals, gold-leaf and silver chandeliers, and silver-plated latticework\\" on the elevators. cited ; The aim was to project a sense of prosperity and solid financial credentials, which in turn would attract tenants willing to pay high rents. For the tenants, such surroundings were good for their own business credibility and affirmed their own social status as professionals. New York faced similar architectural challenges, but in comparison to Chicago, skyscraper architects worked less closely with engineers and other specialists, and instead held strong backgrounds in the Beaux Arts movement and perceived their role to be primarily artistic rather than a partnership with the mechanical arts. Their practices tended to be smaller, resembling atelier style workshops. Structural engineers in New York took longer to build up a strong professional role there, a trend reflected in the lower engineering quality of many early skyscrapers in the city. The New York style emphasized stunning height and a somewhat eclectic use of architectural features from other periods, creating an energetic, flamboyant appearance.; Towers were common, making best use of the relatively small plots of land in New York. Some New York skyscrapers emulated the tripartite style of Chicago, but others broke their exterior down into many different layers, each with its own style. Proponents argued that this reintroduced a sense of human proportion to these tall buildings; critics felt that the results were confusing and ungainly. =Life in early skyscrapers= Chicago Stock Exchange Building, 1893; A – court; B – hall; C – toilet; D – barbershop; E – vents; F – flue; G – office, by Early skyscrapers were mainly made up of small office cubicles, commonly only across, which were placed adjacent to one another along long corridors, following a pattern first invented in the Oriel Chambers building in England in 1864. This allowed the average small company to rent a small amount of space using one or two offices, but held out the option for future expansion by renting additional office cubicles if required at a later date. A skyscraper office relied on natural sunlight from the windows but if necessary was dimly lit from electric desk-top lamps. By the standards of the day, these offices were very modern, with radiators, air vents, and the latest fixtures and fittings, and modern communication systems, including telephone and pneumatic tubes were often installed. As a result, many businesses chose to move out of their older, low-rise offices in Chicago to take up tenancy in the new skyscrapers, which were felt to be more convenient and healthier. The first skyscrapers were mainly occupied by male workers, but this changed during the 1890s, with female employees becoming more common. The percentage of female clerical workers in Chicago, for example, increased from 11 percent in 1880 to 21 percent by 1890, reaching 30 percent by 1900. Various moral concerns were raised about men and women mixing in such offices, which were characterized as being masculine spaces, full of tobacco smoke and profanity and therefore unsuitable for women. The new female workers typically worked as typists or stenographers, using the recently invented typewriter, which grew in number in U.S. offices from 146 in 1879 to 65,000 by 1890. Skyscrapers provided a wide range of in-house services for their tenants, including shops, restaurants, barbers, tobacconists, newsagents, tailors, professional specialists and libraries. Skyscrapers also employed a substantial number of service staff to maintain and support them; a building such as the Chicago Board of Trade spent 20 percent of its rental revenue on service staff, employing 41 people, including janitors, elevator operators, engineers, and an electrician. With this collection of services and facilities, skyscrapers of the period were often referred to as small cities in their own right. =Criticism and reform in Chicago= Opposition to Chicago's skyscrapers began to grow during the late 1880s and early 1890s. Even before the development of the skyscraper, some criticized large buildings in Chicago for dominating churches and private houses, and this sentiment strengthened. Critics complained that the concentration of tall buildings in the center of the city was causing huge congestion, and each new skyscraper was also burning additional coal to power its facilities, together consuming a total of over one million tons each year, leaving smoke and stagnant air hanging over Chicago. Many were concerned over the risk of a major fire breaking out and spreading, uncontrolled, from building to building. Chicago was not alone in having concerns over the growth of the skyscraper. In Boston, the Fiske and the Ames Buildings were built in the late 1880s, and tall respectively, but protests by local civic campaigners and the real estate industry resulted in the city passing a law to limit new buildings to a maximum of , effectively banning the construction of skyscrapers. The cities of Philadelphia, Los Angeles and Washington D.C. similarly introduced height restriction laws to limit skyscraper construction. The decisive factor in favor of change in Chicago, however, was the economic slowdown in the early 1890s, which gave way to the financial panic of 1893.; The recession, combined with the frantic building of the previous few years, meant that Chicago suddenly had a significant surplus of office space, threatening occupancy levels and rents. Regulation was introduced by the city council to control the problem in 1892, with support from the real estate industry who hoped to slow the construction of additional office space and shore up their diminishing profit margins. The height of new buildings was limited to , with lower height levels on narrower streets, effectively curtailing the construction of any taller skyscrapers. The \\"First Great Age\\": 1900–1919 The Skyscrapers of New York, a 1906 film. =Pre-war boom= The early years of the 20th century saw a range of technically sophisticated, architecturally confident skyscrapers built in New York; academics Sarah Landau and Carl Condit term this \\"the first great age\\" of skyscraper building. Some were relatively conservative buildings in a classical style, such as the Mutual Life, Atlantic Mutual, and Broad Exchange Buildings, all designed by Clinton and Russell. Others broke new ground, including the Flatiron Building which opened in 1903 near Madison Square. The Chicago firm of Daniel Hudsdon Burnham designed the high, 21 story structure; the unusually shaped, narrow building needed particularly strong wind bracing, while the facade was richly textured and incorporated stylistic features more common in Chicago. A critical and popular success, the Flatiron was likened to the Parthenon of Ancient Greece and became a New York icon.; The construction of the Singer Tower was announced by the company in 1906, who intended to produce the tallest skyscraper in the world. The company already had several low-rise buildings in New York that the tower would be incorporated into and planned to rent out the bottom half of the tower to tenants to subsidize their use of the upper half. The skyscraper was designed by Ernest Flagg, a Beaux- Arts advocate and noted critic of existing skyscrapers, who justified taking on the project as a way of generating support for skyscraper reform. The design was technically challenging: the tall, narrow tower needed special wind bracing, and the deep bedrock on the site required particularly deep foundations. The tower was faced in dark brick and followed the Beaux-Arts style used by the rest of the complex, with a galleried lobby fitted out in Italian marble. When it opened in 1908, it had 47 stories and was tall; visitors paid $0.50 ($12 in 2010 terms) each to use the observation area at the top of the building. Color postcard of \\"The Woolworth Building and City Hall Park, New York City\\" around 1913, when the Woolworth was the world's tallest building The Metropolitan Life Insurance Company Tower was opened in 1909, the culmination of a long building project by N. LeBrun and Sons to hold Metropolitan Life's growing headquarters staff, 2,800 strong by 1909.; At high and with 50 stories, it became the world's new tallest building. Metropolitan Life intended the skyscraper to promote the company's image, and the building was surrounded by publicity. The tower was featured on the front of prominent magazines such as Scientific American, as well as on the sides of corn flake boxes, coffee packets, and cars. The tower was loosely modeled on the Venician St Mark's Campanile, and featured extensive Early Renaissance- style detailing, with the more modern additions of huge clock faces, electric floodlights for night-time illumination, and an observation deck at the top.; The design won critical acclaim within the American architectural profession. The construction of the Woolworth Building was announced in 1910 by Frank Woolworth, who wanted to create the largest income-producing property in the U.S. The project grew, and Woolworth finally opted for a 55-story, high skyscraper, the latest tallest building in the world, at a cost of $13.5 million ($5.1 billion in 2010 terms).; Architect Cass Gilbert designs included a very high proportion of usable – and thus rentable – floor space, with a great deal of light and a flexible floor plan that could be subdivided for different tenants. Up-to-date fittings were installed to encourage a high- class of tenants, including the world's fastest elevators, safety features, and a swimming pool. Gilbert adopted the Beaux-Arts style, using accented terracotta and glass to emphasis vertical lines, elegantly echoing the structural frame underneath and incorporating 15th and 16th century Flamboyant Gothic-styled features. It was capped by a gilded tower that blended into the sky behind it to produce an illusion of even greater height.; ; The building was illuminated with floodlights at night, topped with red and white flashing lights. It was famously dubbed the \\"Cathedral of Commerce\\", rather to Gilbert's displeasure as he had attempted to avoid copying ecclesiastical architecture. Meanwhile, Chicago's skyscraper industry also boomed during the decade before World War I. The city's elevated train network was operating by 1910, allowing more workers to come into the centre. In 1910 alone of new offices were opened and by the end of the decade, Chicago had the second largest number of headquarters offices in the U.S. Chicago architectural firms such as Daniel H. Burnham and then Graham, Anderson, Probst & White continued to design skyscrapers in the palazzo style made popular in the previous decade. Chicago had hosted the World's Columbian Exposition in 1893, a massive international event which had excited interest in the themes of classical architecture and well-designed city landscapes. Chicago also had extensive discussions in 1909 about the potential for designing large parts of the city, the Burnham Plan of Chicago. The resulting skyscrapers reflected these debates: the Railway Exchange, the Peoples Gas and the Illinois Continental and Commercial Bank Buildings were each substantial, quarter-block wide palazzo cubes of common height, their facades divided into a classical tripartite design, and sporting classical columns and other features. Despite the apparent uniformity of design, individual buildings varied considerably in the detail of their designs in effort to express their particular identities, the Peoples Gas Building using texture and the Railway Exchange Building's white terracotta, for example. =Improvements in construction= Typical floor of the Flatiron Building The process of building skyscrapers became more sophisticated, starting with the acquisition of the real estate needed for the site. Brokers working on commission would secretly acquire the individual lots of land required for a project, operating under a variety of names to avoid having the price increase once a planned build became known. The properties at the front of the site would typically be bought first, so if news broke of the skyscraper then those owning property at the back of the plot would have little choice but to sell anyway. The funding for skyscraper developments was normally lent by banks, insurance companies, or raised through bonds sold through a specialised bond house, with the latter becoming increasingly popular after World War I. Efforts were made to improve the processes for erecting skyscrapers, largely through the work of general contractors such as Louis Horowitz and Frank Gilbreth, who in turn drew on recent work by efficiency specialist Frederick Taylor. Time schedules were devised for all the work to be undertaken, with costs carefully monitored and reports produced each day. The results were demonstrated on the Woolworth Building construction project, where of steel were assembled in only six days, a record for the period. Improved windbracing techniques were introduced. The use of pneumatic caissons in skyscraper foundations grew more advanced; in the construction of the 1908 Manhattan Municipal Building they were successfully sunk below the surface, with specially conditioned workers operating in shifts with constant medical support. New technologies were also introduced within the buildings. Fast Otis elevators, powered by electricity rather than steam-driven hydraulics, began to be installed in skyscrapers, with Ellithorpe safety air cushions protecting the passengers in the case of failure. Lighting improved, with the recommended levels in 1916 being around twice the level of the 1890s. Nonetheless, skyscrapers still relied primarily on natural sunlight, which required installing large windows and having tall ceilings to allow the sunlight to penetrate the back of the offices; an office deeper than was not considered a practical design. =Life in the skyscrapers= Working conditions in the Metropolitan Life Insurance Company Tower, 1910 One of the reasons for the increase in the numbers of skyscrapers during the period was the growth in demand for office workers. In part this demand was fuelled by many U.S. firms becoming larger and more complex, and white-collar sectors such as insurance and banking grew in scale. It was also driven by changing technology. The typewriter was joined in the office by the adding machine, the telephone and filing cabinets, all adding to the demand for office space and requiring increasingly specialised workers. Tenants and rental income were essential to the financial success of any skyscraper, as even the largest skyscrapers and those founded by prominent companies rented out much of their office space. Owners could charge significantly more for office space close to the main windows, making it most efficient to build skyscrapers with as much premium office space as possible, even if this cost slightly more to construct in the first instance. As a result, a standard pattern for office units in both New York and Chicago emerged, with either a single rectangular office adjoining an exterior wall, or a \\"T\\" shaped design, with a reception room giving way to two windowed offices, separated by glass partitions. Skyscrapers usually took on large numbers of relatively small companies as their tenants. A skyscraper such as the Woolworth Tower had around 600 different tenants in 1913, for example, while a typical tenant might rent four or five office units in a skyscraper. =Criticism = Alfred Stieglitz's 1910 work Old and New New York, showing the Vanderbilt Hotel under construction Skyscrapers, particularly those in New York, attracted considerable comment, much of it negative. On his return to New York, writer Henry James condemned the buildings in The American Scene as simply \\"giants of the mere market\\", \\"mercenary monsters\\" doomed to be torn down in turn as other, even larger, buildings took their place.; In Chicago the combination of the environmental pollution and skyscrapers meant that, as Charles Warner complained, \\"one can scarcely see across the streets on a damp day, and the huge buildings loom up in the black sky in ghostly dimness\\". Wider artistic sentiments varied. Many, like, Alfred Stieglitz harboured mixed feelings over New York's skyscrapers, reflected in his famous 1903 portrait of the Flatiron building, and his 1910 work Old and New New York that contrasts the growing steel frame of the emerging Vanderbilt Hotel with the old low-rise blocks of the street below. Poets also wrote about the issues, the early Modernist Sadakichi Hartmann describing how \\"from the city's stir and madd'ning roar\\" the Flatiron's \\"monstrous shape soars in massive flight\\". Artists such as Alvin Coburn and John Marin experimented with producing portraits of New York's skyscrapers, capturing the positive and negative aspects of the modern structures. In 1908 artist Harry Pettit produced a romantic interpretation of a future New York, filled with giant skyscrapers supporting aerial bridges and receiving dirigibles from around the globe. Amongst the architectural community, the Exposition in Chicago inspired many in America to champion planning cities that had a unified design, in which each building had unique features but elegantly complemented its neighbours, typically by being built to a common height: \\"horizontal visual unity\\". In the aftermath of the Exposition, many of these advocates joined with the Beaux-Arts movement to form the City Beautiful movement, proposing low-rise cities with wide boulevards, built in a classical style. These critics condemned New York's skyscrapers, Montgomery Schuyler describing how they had produced a \\"horribly jagged sierra\\" of a city skyline and complaining that no modern skyscraper had turned out to be an architectural success. cited ; Charles Lamb argued that the skyscraper impinged on the rights of the rest of the city by destroying the collective appearance of an urban area. cited Some architects, such as Charles McKim and Stanford White refused to work on such projects altogether. =Reform in New York= Calls were made in New York for legislation to prevent the growth of skyscrapers, citing their effect on the city skylines, but these attempts faced legal obstacles. The United States Constitution did not give local government authority to prevent the buildings on the grounds of aesthetics alone, and any such law in New York was considered likely to face judicial challenge. Others argued that legal reform of skyscraper construction was needed for public health and safety reasons, an area in which U.S. law was normally more supportive of state intervention. The risk of fire was one concern; while skyscrapers might be relatively fireproof, their height made conventional fire-fighting difficult. Architect Charles Bragdon considered a large scale, devastating high-rise fire to be inevitable if regulation was not forthcoming. The Baltimore fire of 1904 was widely cited as an example of this risk and, although Baltimore had few high rise buildings, city lawyers argued that the taller buildings had caused the flames to spread through the city during the blaze. Baltimore subsequently passed a law in 1904, banning buildings higher than . Other campaigners argued that skyscrapers were compromising access to light and air, noting that when tall buildings rose straight up from the sidewalk, they cast long shadows across the street, preventing healthy sunlight from reaching smaller buildings below. Equitable Building in 2011, showing the effect of pre-zoning skyscrapers when seen from the sidewalk Early attempts by Ernest Flagg to limit the height of New York's skyscrapers in 1896 failed; further unsuccessful attempts followed between 1906 and 1908, and legislation was turned down again in 1909, partially because of pressure from the real estate industry. After 1913, however, the property market in New York entered a recession, and vacancy levels in buildings began to rise. The campaign for change was helped by the construction of the Equitable Building in 1915 at the estimated cost of $29 million ($10.9 billion in 2010 terms), which rapidly became infamous as its vast height and bulk blocked views cast neighbours into permanent shade.; The real estate industry finally ceased its objections to new legislation, and the 1916 Zoning Resolution was passed. The details of the legislation were largely the work of architect George Ford. Ford had sympathies with the City Beautiful movement, disliked the unimaginative form of many New York skyscrapers, and had concerns over urban public health, but he also found tall buildings exciting and believed that horizontal visual unity produced boring architecture. As a consequence of Ford's influence, New York's laws were relatively complex and divided up the city into different zones; in each zone, a particular zoning envelope applied, controlling the height to which buildings could be built.; Typically a building could only rise up from the sidewalk vertically by around , after which the building had to be set back at a set angle to allow sunlight to reach the street below. On a quarter of the site, however, the owner could build as high as they wished, without any further restrictions. Inter-war period, boom and depression: 1920–1939 =Post-war boom= The Kavanagh Building in Buenos Aires, a landmark of modern architecture built in 1936. It was the tallest building in the world with a reinforced concrete structure. A real estate boom occurred in the U.S. after the end of the First World War, with a particular surge in the construction of new skyscrapers between 1925 and 1931. In New York, a quarter of the financial district was rebuilt between 1928 and 1931, with of new office space added between 1925 and 1929 alone.; In Chicago, limited wartime construction created supply shortages, and rent levels rose in response by around 100 percent between 1919 and 1924. This level of potential profits encouraged an explosion of new building projects in the city. The boom inflated prices in the real estate market, leading to speculative financing and building projects, including the introduction of 100 percent mortgages for new builds. An early edition of the Fortune magazine commented wryly that \\"all a man needs to own a skyscraper is the money and the land. And he may be able to get along without the money.\\" Skyscrapers continued to grow in height throughout the 1920s. In part this was the result of improvements in technology: steel-frame structures had become increasingly efficient, while improvements in elevator design made taller buildings easier to ascend.; Commercial factors were at work too, as growing commercial demand pushed up rents, enabling taller projects, while the higher offices attracted more sunlight, permitting the charging of premium rents. The tallest buildings could also acquire publicity for their owners, in turn making it easier to find and keep the best tenants. Furthermore, the higher the cost of the underlying real estate, the taller a building needed to be to generate a suitable return on the investment, and the minimum sensible commercial height for a skyscraper project grew to between 40 and 45 stories.; , cited 70 story skyscrapers became relatively common, although an influential 1930 study demonstrated that the best rate of return on a skyscraper was to build it 63 stories high, returning an annual profit of 10.25 percent. Main entrance to Cleveland's Terminal Tower in 2012 Skyscrapers continued to spread both across the U.S. and internationally. New York and Chicago remained the center of skyscraper development, but most major cities in the U.S. had built skyscrapers by 1929, frequently as a result of competition between rival cities for status and investment.; ; Cincinnati built the Cincinnati Towers in 1914, followed by the Carew Tower Complex in 1930. In Detroit, the General Motors Building opened in 1920 and the Fisher Building in 1928. Cleveland acquired the Union Trust Building in 1923 and the Terminal Tower in 1929; the latter, built by the Van Sweringen brothers, was, for a short period, the second tallest building in the world.; Seattle had built Smith Tower in 1914, and the Los Angeles local government granted itself an exemption from city planning restrictions in order to build the Los Angeles City Hall in 1928. Also in 1928, the Industrial Trust Tower was built in Providence. Skyscrapers were also built in other developed countries, although reaching nowhere near the level of construction seen in the U.S. This was partially the result of a lack of funding but also because of local architectural preferences. European cities including London and Paris had laws to ban tall buildings, but elsewhere skyscrapers began to appear, including Toronto's Imperial Bank of Commerce Building, Antwerp's Boerentoren and Buenos Aires' Kavanagh, Comega and Safico buildings.; ; ; Many other European skyscrapers were proposed in a frenzy of excited planning, although few materialised. Soviet Russia began the construction of the Palace of the Soviets in the late 1930s, in the Socialist Classicism style, which would have become the tallest building in the world, but war intervened and the skyscraper was never completed. In the post-war years, this style resulted in the monumental Seven Sisters of Moscow building. The technology used in constructing skyscrapers continued to develop. Time was increasingly a factor in the projects, and architects and their specialist teams developed faster ways to design and construct the buildings to minimise the interest payments during construction and hasten the arrival of rental income. By 1930, skyscrapers were being erected in just 12 months by teams of workers totalling 5,000 men, with four floors being assembled in a typical week. Building skyscraper towers involved some adaption of engineering techniques, as effectively two different buildings were being designed – the base and the tower – which needed to be efficiently linked using elevators and other service facilities. Most new offices settled around a standard size, wide by deep, depending on the height of the ceiling, with multiple small windows considered better than a few larger ones.; The output of electric lighting continued to improve, although this began to give off excessive heat within the offices. Air conditioning was first installed in a few skyscrapers during the 1930s.. =Art Deco skyscrapers and New York's set-back style= 40 Wall Street in 2010, showing the setback style During the 1920s and 1930s many skyscrapers were designed in an Art Deco style. This architectural approach typically combined what Carol Willis terms an \\"aesthetic of simple, sculptural mass\\" with the use of rich colour and ornamentation on the surfaces of the buildings.; The aim was to call attention to the increasingly complex three- dimensional shape of the skyscraper, in contrast to earlier styles which could be critiqued, as historian Larry Ford suggests, as being merely \\"short buildings made taller with additional stories\\".; Windows were de-emphasised in favour of creating a strong sense of shape and mass, the surrounding walls treated as textured fabric, dressing the building underneath.; Skyscrapers of this period typically lost their ornamental horizontal divisions, being broken up by physical changes in their shape as one looked up the building, the whole forming a striking silhouette.; In New York, the 1916 act to allow light and air to reach the streets encouraged a stepped or ziggurat approach to skyscraper design; this \\"set-back\\" style often made unrestricted use of the 25 percent of the site allowed by law to complete with a very tall tower. This encouraged a diversity of buildings, while maintaining an element of harmony and consistency of style. The Paramount Building and 120 Wall Street, for example, were constructed in the set-back style without towers, partially because the limited size of the sites would have made the towers relatively narrow and – when packed with the necessary elevators and service facilities – economically unviable. Many other skyscrapers built on larger or more expensive plots opted for the tallest towers possible, including the $24 million ($3.8 billion in 2010 terms) Bank of Manhattan Building at 40 Wall Street and the City Bank-Farmers Trust Company Building at 20 Exchange Place.; New York continued its lead in tall skyscrapers throughout the period; in 1920 it had ten times the number of tall buildings than its nearest rival Chicago. Some New York skyscrapers complemented traditional, cubicle offices linked by corridors, with larger, more open-plan spaces called \\"general offices\\". These maximised the number of workers that could be fitted into a given space and provided for greater flexibility. Expensive corporate suites were also created during the 1930s, especially on Wall Street, typically on the highest levels of the buildings. These were used by the corporate executives and were usually lavishly outfitted in a range of traditional and exotic styles. The lobbies of these skyscrapers remained grand affairs, although some banks now eschewed renting out space to shops and restaurants in favour of a more exclusive atmosphere. The largest skyscrapers held up to 16,000 workers, although between 5,000 and 10,000 was more common, and the buildings held a wide range of services to support them, including beauty salons, private luncheon clubs, chiropodists and gymnasiums. A skyscraper such as the Cities Service Building at 70 Pine Street directly employed over 200 staff to manage and protect the property. The technology within the offices also grew still more sophisticated, with dictating, automatic typing and tabulating machines being used by teams of ever more specialised office workers. =Chicago's towers= The Tribune Tower was one of the most famous buildings of the 1920s. Chicago altered its laws in the 1920s to allow towers to be built as part of its skyscrapers. In 1920, the maximum building height in Chicago was increased to , and unoccupied structures on a building, such as ornamental towers, were allowed to extend up to high. Additional changes came in 1923, with taller occupied towers being permitted for the first time, but subject to controls on overall volumes. The main building of a skyscraper could be up to tall, and a tower could be built on up to 25 percent of the lot, but the tower could not have a volume of more than a sixth of the main block. In practice, this meant that a tower could not be built more than around 20 stories tall in a typical Chicago skyscraper development. Initially, Chicago still preferred palazzo- styled buildings with large light courts in the centre, because they remained the most profitable designs. The Wrigley Building, built under the 1920 law, demonstrated the effect of two ornamental towers on top of a skyscraper. Under the revised law, the Straus Building and the Pittsfield Building took the palazzo design and added somewhat stunted towers on top in the early 1920s, producing profitable buildings. One of the period's most famous buildings, the Tribune Tower, emerged from a competition held by the Tribune Company in 1922 to celebrate its 75th anniversary. The newspaper was one of the largest in the world and used the competition, in which members of the public were invited to influence the design of the skyscraper, to build a loyal following amongst its readership and generate free publicity. The final design was determined by a competition panel largely made up of the company's appointees, who chose John Howells and Raymond Hood's tower design. The resulting tower was a conservative, Gothic design and controversy about the decision broke out almost immediately: Louis Sullivan and many others criticized Howells and Hood's design as being derivative of the Woolworth Tower.; ; Regardless of its critics, the Tribune received as many as 20,000 visitors to its observation gallery when it opened in 1925. The unbuilt second-place entry in the competition, a more simplified stepped-back design by Eliel Saarinen, also proved highly influential. The popularity of the older style then began to wane in favor of a greater emphasis on towers. One common way of building these within Chicago's laws was to build a square main block with a central service core, and then simply place a tower on the top; the more massive the main block, the taller the tower could be. The Trustees System Service Building and the Foreman State National Bank Building form good examples of this approach. Alternatively, the front of the main block could be recessed, as at the Chicago Civic Opera Building or the LaSalle-Wacker Building, sacrificing volume but producing the visual effect of two high wings flanking a very tall tower. The distinctive New York \\"setback\\" style was not adopted in Chicago, the only example of this style being the Palmolive Building on North Michigan Avenue. =Great Depression= The Empire State Building in 2007 The boom in skyscraper construction began to falter following the Wall Street Crash of 1929, with fast economic growth giving way to the slump years of the Great Depression: construction of all sorts slowed considerably. The real estate market that lay behind new skyscraper builds collapsed, and the value of many properties dropped dramatically: the American Insurance Union tower cost $8 million ($1.2 billion in 2010 terms) to build in 1927, but was valued at only $3.5 million ($900 million) by 1933; 40 Wall Street defaulted on its debts in 1935 and was put on sale for just $1.2 million ($240 m).; ; The major bond house of S.W. Straus, behind many successful developments, defaulted on the $214 million ($47 billion) in bonds held by 60,000 investors; the Van Swerigan developer brothers went bankrupt.; Vacancy rates began to increase as the recession bit, increasing from only one percent in central New York in early 1920 to 17 percent in 1931 and 25 percent by 1934. In the face of the recession, some skyscrapers projects were canceled or scaled back. Plans by the Metropolitan Life company to build a 100-story skyscraper alongside their existing tower had been put forward in 1929, but were shelved in the face of the recession and public criticism of such expenditure in the economic climate. Instead the first phase of the project, known as the North Building ended up only 32 stories high in 1932 and the building, even at this height, was only fully completed in 1950. In many other cases, projects which had already been commissioned continued through to completion. This resulted in of new office space being added to New York between 1931–34 even after the start of the recession, adding to the problem of underoccupancy. Some of these buildings, however, became iconic structures, pushing the limits of skyscraper height sharply upwards. The Chrysler Building was completed in 1930, just after the Depression began to affect the industry. Architect William Van Alen competed with the designers of 40 Wall Street to produce the tallest building in the world and famously erected the Chrysler spire in a last-minute, secret move in order to acquire the title for his own 69-story, tall building.; The exterior was built of white and grey brick, but metal was used extensively to ornament it further, including gargoyles, nickel-chrome eagles' heads, and a winged helmet of Mercury.; The entrance used black granite to contrast with the nickel-chrome windows, and the foyer gave way to red marble and a mural ceiling. The design of each part of the building was individualist and distinct, with even each elevator different in design. A Chrysler showroom was placed on the first floor of the building and an observation deck and the exclusive \\"Cloud Club\\" on the upper levels. construction of Rockefeller Center at night, 1933 The Empire State Building originated from a 1928 project to redevelop the original Waldorf–Astoria into a 50-story mixed-use development; the purchase of the site for $14 million ($2.1 billion) set a record in New York for the year. John Raskob and Pierre du Pont entered into the project as financial backers, and concluded that the project would be more profitable if the site was used to build an extremely tall 80-story skyscraper instead. Although revised financial estimates suggested that the height should be cut back, the caché of having the world's tallest building was considerable, and instead an additional five stories were added to ensure the building, at , would be slightly taller than the Chrysler Building. An observation deck was built to attract tourists, which proved to be a valuable source of revenue. The limestone, granite, and aluminium skyscraper was specially designed to be easily erected, with standardized paneling and structural fittings, and was completed in only 18 months, opening in 1931.; Due to the recession, however, it was only 25 percent occupied throughout the 1930s and ran at a loss; critics dubbed it the \\"Empty State Building\\".; Rockefeller Center had originally been intended by John D. Rockefeller, Jr. to be a new location for the Metropolitan Opera House, but the Wall Street Crash of 1929 brought an end to the scheme. Rockefeller decided to develop a large office center instead, taking advantage of the low construction costs during the recession.; At the center of the development was the RCA Building, heavily influenced by architect Raymond Hood. The long, slab-like RCA had two distinct axes – from one side, it appeared to be a narrow tower, from the other it rose like a sheer wall. Not only was the structure highly distinctive, but it was also economically very effective. The design maximized the available light to the offices and eliminated any darker internal rooms, as the core of the building was entirely taken up with elevators and other engineering services. It took until 1940 before all of the building had been filled by tenants. In Chicago, the final pre-war skyscraper was built in 1934. The Field Building was commissioned during the final boom years of the inter-war economy, and the Home Insurance Building – the first skyscraper, built in 1884 – was demolished to make way for the \\"wing and tower\\"-style development. =Skyscraper mania and social commentary= Berenice Abbott's depiction of changing Manhattan, 1936; Cunard Building (right) Public interest in skyscrapers increased during the 1920s, particularly after the Tribune competition. The competition drawings were circulated on display, with 25,000 people coming to see them in Chicago in just one month. In the aftermath, images of skyscrapers flourished across American culture, commencing what historian Merrill Schleier dubbed a \\"skyscraper mania\\". The \\"Titan City\\" exhibition in 1925 celebrated existing skyscraper and featured futuristic murals by Harvey Corbett and Hugh Ferriss, depicting the skyscraper at the heart of the \\"City of the Future\\". Charles Sheeler and Paul Strand's 1921 short film Manhatta explored the form, ending with a sunset shot from the top of a skyscraper. Authors such as Janet Flanner, John Dos Passos and Mary Borden wrote novels with skyscrapers as important motifs or settings. John Carpenter produced a ballet on the theme. Paul Frankl designed a range of popular \\"skyscraper furniture\\". Much of this commentary was positive, reflecting an optimism about technology and the direction of urban life in general. Skyscrapers were seen as an expression of rational engineering, the perfect buildings for mankind to live in, as celebrated in artist Louis Lozowick's lithographs.; Some other proponents of skyscrapers likened them to medieval cathedrals, symbols of the modern age. Poems depicted skyscrapers as objects of sublime, rational beauty, Ferris describing them as \\"buildings like crystals, walls of translucent glass, sheer glass blocks sheathing a steel grill\\". At Chicago's Century of Progress exposition in 1933, skyscrapers and technology were portrayed as a solution for America's current and future problems. The French-Swiss architect Le Corbusier acclaimed New York in 1935 as being \\"overwhelming, amazing, exciting, violently alive\\", but went on to complain that there were still too few skyscrapers, and those that had been built were not yet tall enough. cited Lewis Hine, employed to record the building of the Empire State Building, portrayed the skyscraper construction teams as courageous heroes, creating a genre of photography that continued up until 1941. A worker constructing the Empire State Building in 1930, overlooking the Chrysler Building in the background (r), by Lewis Hine Their critics expressed concerns about the effect of modern technology and urban living on the human condition, arguing that skyscrapers generated pollution and noise, and imposed a regimented and dehumanising lifestyle on the people that worked in them. Social commentator Lewis Mumford reflected the concerns of many in his critiques entitled Is the Skyscraper Tolerable? and The Intolerable City. Political theorist Stefan Hirsch condemned the buildings as \\"bandages covering the sky, stifling our breath\\". Inventor Thomas Edison expressed fears that an uncontrolled expansion of skyscrapers would result in overcrowding and disaster. Artist Howard Cook's engravings critiqued the oppressive character of the new skyscrapers as they loomed over the traditional city. Berenice Abbott's photographic studies of New York in the 1930s explored the complex theme of urban change and the effect of skyscrapers on the older ways of life in the city, echoing Steigler's work in the first decade of the century. Hollywood used skyscrapers extensively in popular films. The Skyscrapers of New York in 1906 became the first of many, and in the 1920s Harold Lloyd produced his five \\"skyscraper films\\", most prominently Safety Last!, in which the hero dangles from a clock on the side of a Los Angeles building. In these early silent movies, skyscrapers were closely associated with masculine identity; Lloyd's climbing of skyscrapers closely associated with his characters' transformation from young men into mature adults, and the winning of the heroine. The 1933 film King Kong included another iconic use of the early skyscraper in its final scenes, as the giant ape scaled the Empire State Building shortly before his death; the scene can be interpreted as contrasting natural instinct with the insensitive rationality of the modern building and wider New York. Legacy The West Street Building in 1988, overshadowed by the modernist World Trade Center Skyscraper development paused during the years of the Second World War. Once development began again in the 1950s and 1960s, the skyscraper entered a different phase of development, usually called the international or modern period. Some experimental designs in this style had been built in the U.S. using European architectural concepts in the early 1930s, most notably the Philadelphia Savings Fund Society and McGraw-Hill Buildings. Post-war, their modernist themes were used in a new generation of skyscrapers. These stood alone on individual plots in the fashion of the Rockefeller Centre's RCA building, rather than as part of a row of buildings, forming huge slabs and towers featuring huge glass façades, breaking with earlier skyscraper traditions.; Inside, new technologies such as fluorescent lighting and widespread air-conditioning meant that many older architectural features such as light courts and operable windows were unnecessary. The trend had substantial implications for many early skyscrapers. Some were redesigned to fit new tastes. Much of the ornate detail was removed from the Metropolitan Life Tower in the 1960s, for example, to fit contemporary, plainer fashions. Many older skyscrapers could not be adapted, however, as they lacked the physical depth to build larger modern offices or the space for new service facilities. Some were demolished to make way for new, larger structures. Amongst these was the Singer Tower, demolished in 1968 and replaced by the international style United States Steel Building. In the 21st century, buildings such as 90 West Street have been renovated as upmarket housing, partially because of their extensive windows and access to sunlight. Critical discussion of early skyscrapers began from the 1880s onwards in the architectural community and continued across a growing cultural and academic community in the inter-war period. In 1930, the terms the Chicago \\"school\\" and \\"movement\\" began to be used for the first time, popularised by the 1940s academics Sigfried Giedion and Carl Condit as a label for the early Chicago architects. They regarded skyscrapers as the early forerunners of modernism and as marking a clear break with earlier architectural forms in the U.S.; This interpretation of Chicago's skyscrapers was later challenged by Robert Bruegmann and Daniel Bluestone, who argued that it underplayed the links of the movement to pre-existing Chicago culture. During the 1980s and 1990s, analysis of the early skyscrapers increasingly shifted away from the architects and architecture of the individual buildings to considerations of skyscrapers' roles in the wider urban context. Histories stressing the social, economic, and cultural dimension of skyscrapers began to be produced, with New York's skyscrapers receiving greater attention than before.; ; The Skyscraper Museum – the first to address the theme – was founded in New York in 1997 by historian Carol Willis to preserve the history of the skyscraper.

The site is listed in the 'Forest of Dean Local Plan Review' as a Key Wildlife Site (KWS).Forest of Dean District Local Plan Review, adopted November 2005, Appendix D 'Nature Conservation Site Designations Within the Forest of Dean District', Key Wildlife Sites Location and habitat The nature reserve lies in the heart of the Forest of Dean, on the B4226 between Cinderford and Coleford and east of Cannop. It is about half a mile to the east of Speech House. This has been a nature reserve managed by the Trust since 1984. It consists of reclaimed land from open-cast mine workings and has lake, marsh and open heath habitats. Mining ceased in 1981, and the area has been swiftly colonised by a significant variety of plants and animals. There is a main lake which is surrounded by tree plantations. These consist mainly of Oak, Alder, Larch and Corsican Pine. Areas to be kept open were identified and this planning has ensured the creation of large areas of open heathland habitat. The water on the site is controlled by a sluice and is linked with that of Foxes Bridge Bog, which is also a Gloucestershire Wildlife Trust nature reserve. The Bog is on the opposite side of the B4226. Nearby (to the west) is another Trust reserve which is Cannop Bridge Marsh at Cannop Ponds. Crabtree Hill is to the north of the lake. In particular, ten hectares of conifers were cleared from this hill by the Forestry Commission in 2011, thus creating a large open area which over time will fully colonise as heathland habitat. This will complement that already created and part of the reserve.'Woorgreens Nature Reserve', (undated), Gloucestershire Wildlife Trust and Forestry Commission joint publication Significant interest The Woorgreens reserve is considered to be the Forest of Dean's best dragonfly site, and over seventeen species have been recorded. Some of the species are scarce and breeding colonies in this area are important. They are supported by the network of other ponds and ditches in the area, such as Kensley pond. Breeding populations recorded include blue-tailed damselfly, large red damselfly, azure damselfly, southern hawker, ruddy sympetrum, broad-bodied chaser and the emperor dragonfly. Woorgreens Lake in the Forest of Dean Birds The water area encourages wading birds such as spotted redshank, greenshank, green sandpiper and curlew. Snipe are recorded as over-wintering. Breeding birds include little grebe, moorhen, mallard, teal and tufted duck. The heathland area encourages whinchat, skylark, tree pipit, cuckoo, nightjar, kestrel and sparrowhawk. The reserve is one of three known sites in the Forest of Dean where stonechat breed. Swift, swallow and house martin are regular feeders as the site is rich in insect life. Siskin, redpoll and crossbills are recorded on the woodland edge of the reserve. Hobbies are recorded chasing dragonflies over the lake. The Royal Society for the Protection of Birds (RSPB) reports on the birdlife of Woorgreens Lake and Crabtree Hill.RSPB Gloucestershire Local group Invertebrates A wide range of butterflies are recorded which include small skipper, common blue, and there are local rarities such as grayling and brown argus reported. Amphibians and reptiles The rare and protected great crested newt is present in the lake.‘Nature Reserve Guide – discover the wild Gloucestershire on your doorstep’ - 50th Anniversary, January 2011, Gloucestershire Wildlife Trust Common lizard, slowworm, grass snake and adder are encouraged by the heathland habitat. This is threatened habitat and once covered large areas of the Forest of Dean. Flora and fungi Rushes flourish along the margins, and a variety of herbs and grasses in the rides. Bell heather has established itself in the heath area, along with ling and gorse. The dead branches of gorse encourage fungi such as yellow brain. Bay boletes may be found beneath the pine trees. Conservation This is a site which nature has colonised, but needs management to control domination by particular species. There is a wader scrape and ditches have been made deeper. There has been planting of willow and alder.

Unlike deterministic approaches, MHE requires an iterative approach that relies on linear programming or nonlinear programming solvers to find a solution. MHE reduces to the Kalman filter under certain simplifying conditions. A critical evaluation of the extended Kalman filter and MHE found improved performance of MHE with the only cost of improvement being the increased computational expense. Because of the computational expense, MHE has generally been applied to systems where there are greater computational resources and moderate to slow system dynamics. However, in the literature there are some methods to accelerate this method.  Overview  The application of MHE is generally to estimate measured or unmeasured states of dynamical systems. Initial conditions and parameters within a model are adjusted by MHE to align measured and predicted values. MHE is based on a finite horizon optimization of a process model and measurements. At time the current process state is sampled and a minimizing strategy is computed (via a numerical minimization algorithm) for a relatively short time horizon in the past: [t-T,t]. Specifically, an online or on-the-fly calculation is used to explore state trajectories that find (via the solution of Euler–Lagrange equations) an objective-minimizing strategy until time t. Only the last step of the estimation strategy is used, then the process state is sampled again and the calculations are repeated starting from the time-shifted states, yielding a new state path and predicted parameters. The estimation horizon keeps being shifted forward and for this reason the technique is called moving horizon estimation. Although this approach is not optimal, in practice it has given very good results when compared with the Kalman filter and other estimation strategies. =Principles of MHE= Moving horizon estimation (MHE) is a multivariable estimation algorithm that uses: * an internal dynamic model of the process * a history of past measurements and * an optimization cost function J over the estimation horizon, to calculate the optimum states and parameters. Moving horizon estimation scheme The optimization estimation function is given by: J=\\\\sum_{i=1}^N w_{y} (x_i-y_i)^2 + \\\\sum_{i=1}^N w_{\\\\hat{x}} (x_i-\\\\hat{x}_i)^2 + \\\\sum_{i=1}^N w_{p_i} {\\\\Delta p_i}^2 without violating state or parameter constraints (low/high limits) With: x_i = i -th model predicted variable (e.g. predicted temperature) y_i = i -th measured variable (e.g. measured temperature) p_i = i -th estimated parameter (e.g. heat transfer coefficient) w_{y} = weighting coefficient reflecting the relative importance of measured values y_i w_{\\\\hat{x}_i} = weighting coefficient reflecting the relative importance of prior model predictions \\\\hat{x}_i w_{p_i} = weighting coefficient penalizing relative big changes in p_i Moving horizon estimation uses a sliding time window. At each sampling time the window moves one step forward. It estimates the states in the window by analyzing the measured output sequence and uses the last estimated state out of the window, as the prior knowledge.

Мария Васильевна Семёнова, also spelled Semenova; born November 1, 1958 in Leningrad, Soviet Union) is a Russian writer of fantasy and historical fiction and a poet. Most of her books are based on Slavic mythology, as well as on Russian and Norse pagan traditions. She's best known for Wolfhound (Volkodav in Russian) fantasy series, that was adapted into 2007 film Wolfhound of The Grey Hound Clan and the 2006 video game Requital. Semyonova is also known for her numerous translations of western fantasy books into the Russian language. Biography Semyonova graduated from Leningrad State University of Aerospace Instrument Making and worked as a computer specialist in the 1980s in a research institute. From her childhood, Maria was interested in Medieval Rus, its traditions and mythology, as well as Viking Age. Her early books, written in Soviet era, were historical fiction about Vikings, medieval Russians and Finns, usually set in Scandinavia or Novgorod. She wrote about such historical persons as Ragnar Lodbrok, Aella of Northumbria, Rurik, Oleg and Vadim, among others. However, most of these books were not published until 1996, as Perestroika-era publishers were not interested in historical fiction. After the fall of Soviet Union, Semyonova abandoned her computer work and became literary translator from English, working for Severo-Zapad. She translated several books by Robert E. Howard, Robin Hobb, L. Sprague de Camp, Margaret Weis and Tracy Hickman, among others. This is where she discovered Western fantasy and became fond of it. However, she was disappointed with a wave of Russian fantasy writers becoming copycats of their western colleagues. Semenova decided to write a fantasy novel based exclusively on Russian tradition and mythology. \\"If you wanted fantasy, you get it. But why do you prefer the chewed-out Tolkien-esque sandwich, while our richest native tradition stays forgotten?\\" - she would recall.Maria Semenova biography (Russian) In 1995, Wolfhound was released. The book, published by Severo-Zapad, was an immediate success, it spanned a series of sequels, a multi-author project, a film and a TV series. Often compared to Robert E. Howard Conan series, Wolfhound was intended as Conan's counterpart: a protector of the weak rather than adventurer.Mir Fantastiki: Conan vs Wolfhound, a comparison of two famous barbarians The books also included a large amount of poetry by Semenova, each chapter was accompanied by a verse. Several other Semenova books, including Dark Grey Wolf series, are set in the same universe with Wolfhound. Success of her fantasy novels allowed Semenova to publish her earlier historical books as well. Maria Semyonova also wrote several lesser-known political detective books, together with Felix Razumovsky and various other co-authors. She also wrote a popular history encyclopedia \\"We, Slavs!\\" about the culture and traditions of Russian paganism. Semyonova is an amateur aikido fighter.  Works  = Novels = * Ведун, Vedun (1985).

The new church was completed in the same age of the election of Francesco Sforza as duke of Milan 1451, and received the current name (meaning \\"St. Mary Encrowned\\") in the occasion. In 1460 the duke's wife, Bianca Maria Visconti, commissione the construction of a new church next to the oldest one, identical and connected to it, in order to create a single, larger edifice.

Dating back to the 15th century, the shrine was built in the spirit of the historical Sufi premier Bibi Jawindi of the Suhrawardiyyah order, a strictly hegemonistic Sunni school of theosophical thought which puts particular emphasis on the Shafi’i school of classical jurisprudence in the context of its interpretation of the Sharia. Jaw Indo was great-granddaughter to Jahaniyan Jahangasht, a famous Sufi saint in his own right. Location The site is located in the south-west corner of Uch, a historical city founded by Alexander the Great, in the Bahawalpr state and Punjab province of Pakistan. Uch, locally known as Uch Sharif, is known as the home of the \\"shrine culture\\" because of its cultural significance and the presence of several monuments and shrines. Architecture Considered one of the most ornate monuments in Uch, the tomb of Bibi Jawindi is an important site for visitors. The exterior of the building is octagonal in shape and has three tiers with the top one supporting a dome, while the interior is circular due to thick angled walls rising up two stories. Both the interior and exterior of the building are richly decorated with Islamic scriptures, carved timber, and bright blue and white mosaic tiles known as faience. The base tier is supported by eight tapering towers in each corner. The compound enclosing the shrine is preserved in its original desert-like conditions and is mostly covered with cemented graves. The surrounding area is covered with green vegetation due to a network of river tributaries and canals crossing the area. World Heritage Site The site was submitted by the Department of Archaeology and Museums Pakistan in January 2004 to be inducted in the World Heritage Sites along with four other monuments in the region. These monuments are the Shrine of Baha'al-Halim, Tomb of Ustead (the architect), Shrine of Jalaluddin Bukhari, and the Mosque of Jalaluddin Bukhari. The site was submitted under the criteria ii, iv, and vi in the cultural category. As of April 2019, it is still on the tentative list. Conservation Photograph showing the damage to the tomb. Over the centuries, the tomb has badly disintegrated as a result of environmental conditions, and during torrential floods in 1817 half of the structure was washed away. Only half of the structure remains today. In 1999, the Conservation and Rehabilitation Center of Pakistan invited international bodies and city officials to work on the conservation of the site. However, because of humidity, salt infiltration, and erosion the complex monuments are still crumbling. Inappropriate methods of repair have further damaged the complex. The World Monuments Fund placed the structure on their Watch in 1998, 2000, and 2002 to gather international attention and obtained grants to conserve the tombs.

It is found in very shallow parts of the western Atlantic Ocean and the Caribbean Sea.  Description  Echinometra lucunter has an elliptical rather than a round test (shell). It can grow to a diameter of about and grows larger at the extreme north and south ends of its range than it does in the centre. It has moderately short spines with wide bases and sharp tips. The colour of the test varies from black to deep brownish-red, often being more ruddy on its aboral (upper) surface than on its oral (lower) surface. The spines are usually black.  Distribution and habitat  Echinometra lucunter is common throughout the Caribbean Sea and also occurs in Florida, Bermuda and the South American coast as far south as Brazil. It occurs on shallow rocky areas and on coral reefs usually at depths of or less but occasionally in deeper water down to about . It is sometimes found among seagrasses and often under rock slabs or broken coral especially in places with high water movement. It sometimes occurs in large numbers and causes considerable damage to coral reefs through its boring activities.  Biology  Echinometra lucunter uses the teeth that surround its mouth to grind away at the rock underneath it so as to make a hemispherical depression in which it takes refuge during the day. It emerges at night to graze on algae growing within a few centimetres (inches) of its home. It defends this hole against other sea urchins of its own species. The king helmet shell (Cassis tuberosa) feeds on it and several species of small goby conceal themselves underneath its test.

Description Reflections is a highly representative Dove piece, a flowing abstract landscape with trees under a prominent sun. The whimsy, organic elements, and prominent sun and moon are all characteristic themes of his work. Although at first glance a straightforward landscape, Dove once referred to it as \\"Reflections (from headlights in car)\\", indicating a more complex possible reading. Historical information In 1910, Dove became the first American to paint an abstract work. His bold, emotional paintings earned him membership in the Stieglitz Group, a cadre of Americans devoted to modernism. In 1933, he moved to Geneva, New York, to live on his family estate. Though unhappy with the region's provincial character, he remained for five years. His work underwent a profound shift in this period, as his artistic and geographic isolation led him to concentrate on scenes from his bucolic surroundings and the \\"purely formal appeal of natural objects' shapes and lines, which he emphasized to the point of abstraction with organic shapes and unexpected color schemes\\". Reflections was created squarely in the middle of his Geneva period. =Location history= Dove first sold Reflections to his long-time friend and patron Alfred Stieglitz in New York. It was then added to the collection of the Downtown Gallery in New York before being acquired by Mr. and Mrs. Denman of Bellevue, Washington.

Marian studies language, cognition, the brain, and the consequences of knowing more than one language for linguistic, cognitive, and neural architectures.  Biography  Viorica Marian was born in Chisinau, Moldova, in a family of public health physicians. Her mother was an epidemiologist and her father taught at the medical university; her brother is a lawyer in Stockholm, Sweden. Marian grew up speaking Romanian and Russian and studied English in school. She first came to the United States as part of a high school delegation, returning a year later to attend college. She received a bachelor's degree in Psychology from the University of Alaska Anchorage, a master's degree in Cognitive and Developmental Psychology from Emory University, and a PhD and second master's degree in Human Experimental Psychology from Cornell University. Viorica Marian was the last graduate student and mentee of American psychologist Ulric Neisser, widely regarded as the “Father of Cognitive Psychology.” While at Cornell, Marian married Dutch computer scientist Dr. Aswin Aalt van den Berg, together they have three daughters. Since 2000, Marian has been on the faculty at Northwestern University, as Assistant Professor, Associate Professor, and Full Professor. She currently holds the Ralph and Jean Sundin Endowed Chair in Communication Sciences and Disorders. Marian served as Department Chair of the Roxelyn and Richard Pepper Department of Communication Sciences and Disorders between 2011-2014. She resides in Evanston, Illinois. At the University of Alaska, Marian studied with Alaska's only cognitive psychologist at the time, Dr. Robert Madigan. At Emory, she was influenced by psychologists Philippe Rochat, Robyn Fivush, Eugene Winograd, Carolyn Mervis, John Pani, Michael Tomasello, Frans de Waal, and others. At Cornell, Marian was trained in eye-tracking by Michael Spivey, and in functional neuroimaging by Joy Hirsch, and was also influenced by Stephen Ceci, Urie Bronfenbrenner, Frank Keil, Joan Sereno, Daryl Bem, David Field, Carol Krumhansl, Thomas Gilovich, Shimon Edelman, James Cutting, and others.  Research and contributions to science  Viorica Marian's research areas include Psycholinguistics, Neurolinguistics, Cognitive Science, Language and Cognition, Linguistic and Cultural Diversity, Communication Sciences and Disorders, Bilingualism, and Multilingualism. She studies language processing, language and memory, language learning, language development, audio-visual integration, bilingual assessment, neurolinguistics of bilingualism, and computational models of bilingual language processing. Marian uses multiple approaches, including eye-tracking, EEG, fMRI, mouse- tracking, computational modeling, and cognitive tests to understand how bilingualism and multilingualism change human function. Funding for her research comes from the National Institutes of Health, the National Science Foundation, private foundations, and Northwestern University. Parallel activation of both languages in bilinguals. Marian's research revealed that bilinguals activate both languages in parallel during spoken language comprehension. The traditional account of bilingual spoken language processing was the Language Switch Hypothesis, which posited that bilinguals turn off the non-target language during target language processing. Using eye-tracking, Marian demonstrated that bilinguals do not turn off the non-target language, and instead process the two languages in parallel and co-activate words from both languages as speech unfolds. For example, she showed that when Russian- English bilinguals were asked to pick up a marker, they also made eye movements to a stamp, because the Russian word for stamp (marka) shared phonological form with the target English word and became co-activated. This research showed, for the first time, that, as words unfold, phonological input gets mapped onto both of a bilingual's languages. Marian has since extended these findings to Spanish-English, German-English and even ASL-English bilinguals, the latter showing that co-activation of two languages can take place across modalities and relies not only on bottom-up, but also on top-down and lateral processes. This work yields strong support for a dynamic bilingual language system that accommodates a high degree of interactivity between and within languages. Co-activation of two languages has since been replicated in many laboratories around the world and as a result of this work, the view that bilinguals co-activate both languages in parallel during comprehension has become widely accepted among language scientists. Language-dependent memory. Marian's contribution to the study of language and memory focused on the effects of language on cognitive processes in bilinguals. Building on the encoding specificity principle, Marian demonstrated that the language one speaks influences memory retrieval, a hypothesis that has since become known as Language-Dependent Memory. Psychologists have studied context-dependent memory in a number of domains, including environmental-context dependent memory, mood-dependent memory, and mental reinstatement of context. Marian showed that linguistic context can lead to similar effects and that memories became more accessible when the language at retrieval matched the language at encoding. For example, she found that bilinguals who learned a second language later in life were more likely to remember events that happened in their childhood when speaking their first language and more likely to remember events that happened later in life when speaking their second language. Similarly, her research revealed that bilinguals answered questions about everyday facts and information differently in their two languages depending on the language in which that information was learned; and that they differed in self-construal and emotion across languages. This work contributed to understanding how multiple cognitive perspectives and mental models co-exist within one mind and the role language may play in mediating these processes. Language learning. Marian's research has contributed to demonstrating a bilingual advantage in novel language learning. She and her students showed that bilinguals outperform monolinguals at learning a new language and used eye tracking and mouse tracking trajectories to demonstrate that bilinguals were better at controlling interference from the native language when using a newly learned language. Cognitive consequences of bilingualism. A prominent discovery in the field of bilingualism is that bilingualism may change performance on certain cognitive control tasks. This work has provided a framework for studying cognitive repercussions of being bilingual. Marian and her students contributed to this area by showing a link between lexical co- activation in spoken comprehension, subsequent linguistic inhibition, and non- linguistic inhibitory control in bilinguals. Her research group also demonstrated that the impact of bilingualism is not limited to language processing, but also influences visual search and changes how speakers of different languages focus their attention. For example, English and Spanish speakers look at different objects when searching for the same item (e.g., clock) in identical visual displays. Whereas English speakers searching for the clock also look at a cloud, Spanish-English bilinguals searching for the clock look at both a cloud and a gift, because the Spanish names for gift (regalo) and clock (reloj) overlap phonologically. These differences in looking patterns emerge despite an absence of direct linguistic input, suggesting that peoples’ lifelong experience with language can influence visual search. Neurological consequences of bilingualism. Marian's neuroimaging work examined overlap and differences in language networks across bilinguals’ two languages during language processing. She showed that bilingual experience changes not only linguistic and cognitive processing, but also neural organization and function. Language research tools. Marian's lab has developed various research tools that are widely used by the language science community and are freely available from Marian's Bilingualism and Psycholinguistics Research Group website. The Language Experience and Proficiency Questionnaire has been translated into over twenty languages and used in hundreds of studies worldwide; the Cross-Linguistics Easy-Access Resource for Phonological and Orthographic Neighborhood Densities database is currently the most extensive multilingual database of lexical neighborhoods available online; and the Bilingual Language Interaction Network for Comprehension of Speech provides the only existing dynamic self-organizing computational model of bilingual spoken language comprehension.  Other  Marian teaches courses on linguistic and cultural diversity at Northwestern University and is an advocate for increased representation of individuals from linguistically, culturally, racially, and otherwise diverse backgrounds in science and education. Marian received the University of Alaska Alumni of Achievement Award and the Clarence Simon Award for Outstanding Teaching and Mentoring. Marian graduated college and started her PhD studies at the age of 19.

It is the first instalment in the Fallen film series. The film stars Gerard Butler, Aaron Eckhart, Morgan Freeman, Angela Bassett, Robert Forster, Cole Hauser, Ashley Judd, Melissa Leo, Dylan McDermott, Radha Mitchell, and Rick Yune. The plot depicts a North Korean-led guerrilla assault on the White House, and focuses on disgraced United States Secret Service agent Mike Banning's efforts to rescue the US President, Benjamin Asher. The film was released in the United States on March 22, 2013, by FilmDistrict. It earned $170 million against a $70 million production budget. The film received mixed reviews from critics, who praised Fuqua's direction and Butler's performance, but criticized the violence and screenplay. Olympus Has Fallen was one of two films released in 2013 that depicted a terrorist attack on the White House; the other was White House Down. A sequel, titled London Has Fallen, was released on March 4, 2016, with the principal cast members reprising their roles. Another sequel, Angel Has Fallen, was released on August 23, 2019. Plot Former U.S. Army Ranger and US Army Special Forces soldier Mike Banning (Gerard Butler) is a Secret Service agent assigned to be the chief of the U.S. presidential detail, maintaining a personal, friendly relationship with President Benjamin Asher (Aaron Eckhart), First Lady Margaret (Ashley Judd), and their son Connor (Finley Jacobsen). On a snowy Christmas drive from Camp David to a campaign fundraiser, the car transporting the First Family spins out of control on an icy bridge. Banning pulls Asher from the vehicle, but fails to save Margaret as she falls to her death. Eighteen months later, Banning works at the Treasury Department, having been removed from the presidential detail. During Asher's meeting with South Korean Prime Minister Lee Tae-Woo (Keong Sim) at the White House, the Koreans for United Freedom (KUF), a North Korean terrorist group led by Kang Yeonsak (Rick Yune), mounts an air attack (with an AC-130 gunship) and hundreds of ground assault mercenaries to capture the building, killing most of the White House defending workforce. Aided by rogue members of the prime minister's own detail, including former Secret Service agent-turned-private contractor Dave Forbes (Dylan McDermott), they hold Asher and several top officials hostage in the PEOC, where Lee is executed on live video. Before being killed, agent Roma (Cole Hauser) alerts Secret Service Director Lynne Jacobs (Angela Bassett) that \\"Olympus has fallen.\\" Banning joins the White House's defenders during KUF's initial assault. He falls back into the White House, disabling internal surveillance and gaining access to Asher's satellite ear phone, which he uses to maintain contact with Jacobs and Speaker of the House Allan Trumbull (Morgan Freeman), now acting president, in the Pentagon's emergency briefing room. Kang uses Asher's hostage status to force Trumbull to withdraw the Seventh Fleet and U.S. forces from the Korean Peninsula, thus removing American opposition of a third Korean War, and seeks to detonate the American nuclear arsenal, turning the United States into an irradiated wasteland in revenge for his mother's death. To do this, he requires access codes to the Cerberus system, held only by Asher, Secretary of Defense Ruth McMillan (Melissa Leo), and Chairman of the Joint Chiefs Admiral Joseph Hoenig (James Ingersoll), all of whom are inside the PEOC. Asher orders McMillan and Hoenig to reveal their codes to save their lives, certain that he will not give up his own code. Authorized to proceed, Banning's first act is to save Connor, whom Kang plans to use to force Asher to reveal his Cerberus code. Banning finds Connor hiding in the building's walls and sneaks him to safety. On reconnaissance, Banning kills several of the terrorists, including Forbes. Army Chief of Staff General Edward Clegg (Robert Forster) convinces Trumbull to order an aerial SEAL assault on the White House. The KUF discovers the assault force and activates the advanced Hydra 6 anti-aircraft system. Kang retaliates by executing Vice President Charlie Rodriguez (Phil Austin). After Banning disables Kang's communications, Kang tries to execute McMillan outside the White House in front of the media, but Banning rescues her. Banning takes out most of KUF as they retreat back to the bunker. With the KUF dwindling, Kang fakes his and Asher's death by sacrificing several of his commandos and the remaining hostages in a helicopter explosion however Banning sees through the ruse. Having two of the codes to Cerberus already, he eventually cracks Asher's code using a brute-force attack and activates the system. As Kang and his remaining men in the KUF attempt to escape, Banning ambushes and kills all of them except Kang. After Asher is shot, Banning confronts and engages in hand-to-hand combat with Kang. Asher momentarily distracts Kang, thus helping Banning in killing him. After Asher informs him of Cerberus, Banning disables it with the assistance of Trumbull and his staff. Banning escorts Asher out of the White House as the latter receives medical attention. Afterwards, Banning is reappointed to the head of the president's security detail as Asher speaks to everyone of the aftermath of the attack.

The rest of the characters were cast throughout June and July. In 2012, Millennium Films competed against Sony Pictures, which was producing White House Down (also about a takeover of the White House) to complete casting and to begin filming. Filming began in Shreveport, Louisiana, in mid-July 2012. Because Olympus Has Fallen was filmed so far from its actual setting of Washington, D.C., the entire production relied heavily upon visual effects, particularly computer-generated imagery. For example, computers were used to create nearly all of the opening sequence in which the First Lady is killed in a car accident, with chroma key greenscreen technology used to composite the actors into the computer- generated snowy scenery. For scenes where actors walked in or out of the White House, a first-floor façade and entrance were built; computers added the second floor, roof, and downtown D.C. cityscape. Action scenes with the White House in the background were filmed in open fields and the White House and D.C. were added in post-production.Ian Failes, \\"How VFX saved Washington: Olympus Has Fallen\\". Fxguide. 25 March 2013. Score The score was composed by Trevor Morris whose past projects included The Tudors and The Borgias. The score was recorded at Trevor Morris Studios in Santa Monica with the Bratislava Slovak National Orchestra. The record was released on March 15, 2013 via Relativity Music Group label. All music composed by Trevor Morris Release Olympus Has Fallen was released in the United States on , 2013. It was initially scheduled for an , 2013 release, but moved to avoid competition with The Heat, which was to open at the same time (its release was later pushed back to June 28). FilmDistrict distributed the film. The film's trailer was criticized for using the U.S. Emergency Alert System, and several cable companies were fined by the Federal Communications Commission for airing the ad. Olympus Has Fallen grossed $98.9 million in the U.S. and Canada and $71.3 million in other territories, for a worldwide total of $170.2 million against a budget of $70 million. In its first weekend, the film earned $30.5 million finishing second at the box office, and exceeded predictions of $23 million. The film was released on DVD and Blu-ray on August 13, 2013, in the U.S. It earned $38.2 million in video rental sales in the U.S.  Dispute as to Authorship  There is contemporaneous evidence that suggests that Creighton Rothenberger and Katrin Benedikt were not the sole authors of Olympus has Fallen, but in fact Mr. Rothenberger's former partner, John S. Green, a lawyer in Pennsylvania and a fellow University of Pennsylvania alumnus with Rothenberger, was the source of the movie's characters and material. In 2013, Rothenberger sued Green in federal district court in California, seeking a declaration that he was sole author. Green counterclaimed that he was the source of substantial material in the 41-page treatment that was registered with the WGA in the year 2002. The project languished for several years, and the partners began working on it again in 2009. In 2012, the screenplay was completed and then sold, but Rothenberger failed to disclose that Green had been a co-author (violation of copyright law). The California federal case between Rothenberger and Green was settled as to Olympus has Fallen for $175,000, the public later discovered in an unrelated Pennsylvania state court lawsuit involving the property sharing agreement in a divorce between Green and his ex-spouse. See  Reception  Review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes gives the film a rating of 49% based on 192 reviews and a weighted average rating of 5.39/10. The site's critical consensus reads, \\"It's far from original, but Olympus Has Fallen benefits from Antoine Fuqua's tense direction and a strong performance from Gerard Butler—which might be just enough for action junkies\\". Metacritic assigns the film a weighted average score of 41 out of 100 based on 30 critics, indicating \\"mixed or average reviews\\". Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film a grade of \\"A–\\" on an A+ to F scale. Richard Roeper compared Olympus Has Fallen with the Die Hard series for sharing the same style and momentum, calling it as \\"just too much of a pale Die Hard ripoff.\\" He gave the film a C. David Edelstein was much more negative about the film. While praising Butler's role as a \\"solid\\" character, Edelstein criticized the script and the violence of the film, writing \\"Olympus Has Fallen is a disgusting piece of work, but it certainly hits its marks – it makes you sick with suspense.\\" Sequel Gerard Butler, Morgan Freeman, Aaron Eckhart, Angela Bassett and Radha Mitchell returned for a sequel titled London Has Fallen revolving around a major terrorist strike on London during the funeral of the British Prime Minister. Production was scheduled to begin in May 2014 in London, with Creighton Rothenberger and Katrin Benedikt returning to pen the script. Director Antoine Fuqua, however, did not return due to his commitments on The Equalizer. On May 1, 2014, it was announced that Focus Features had acquired distribution rights to the sequel and would release it on October 2, 2015, though this was later pushed back to January 22, 2016. However, the film's release was delayed to March 4, 2016. On August 18, 2014, it was announced that Charlie Countryman director Fredrik Bond would take over direction from Fuqua, but Bond left the film on September 18, just six weeks before shooting was set to begin. However, on September 28, 2014, it was announced that Babak Najafi would take over direction of the sequel. On October 10, 2014, it was announced that Jackie Earle Haley would join London Has Fallen as a Deputy Chief Mason. Filming for the sequel began on October 24, 2014. The film was released on March 4, 2016.

Debuted at the 2012 Paris Motor Show, sales of the P1 began in the United Kingdom in October 2013 and all 375 units were sold out by November. Production ended in early December 2015. The United States accounted for 34% of the units and Europe for 26%. It is considered by the automotive press to be the successor to the McLaren F1, utilising hybrid power and Formula One technology, but does not have the same three-seat layout. It was later confirmed that the Speedtail served as the actual successor to the McLaren F1. The P1 has a mid-engine, rear wheel drive design that used a carbon fibre monocoque and roof structure safety cage concept called MonoCage, which is a development of the MonoCell first used in the MP4-12C and then in subsequent models. Its main competitors are the LaFerrari and the 918 Spyder. They are all similar in specifications and performance, and in a race around Silverstone circuit they were all within half a second of each other, the P1 finishing first at 58.24 seconds and the LaFerrari finishing last at 58.58 seconds; the 918 was in-between with 58.46 seconds. Parts of the car were inspired by a sailfish that Frank Stephenson saw when on holiday in Miami. 58 units of the track-oriented P1 GTR and 5 units of its road legal counterpart, the P1 LM were produced after the initial run of 375 cars. 13 experimental Prototype 'XP', 5 Validation Prototypes 'VP' and 3 Pre-Production 'PP' cars were produced by McLaren before the production of the P1 started, a number of which have been refurbished, modified and sold to customers.  Specifications  McLaren P1 in Race Mode while driving. The P1 features a twin-turbocharged V8 engine. McLaren's Chris Goodwin explains the P1 Drivetrain The twin turbos boost the petrol engine at to deliver at 7,500 rpm and of torque at 4,000 rpm, combined with an in-house-developed electric motor producing and of torque. The electric motor and the petrol engine in the P1, produce a combined power output of and of torque. The electric motor can be deployed manually by the driver or left in automatic mode, whereby the car's ECUs 'torque fill' the gaps in the petrol engine's output, which is considered turbo lag. This gives the powertrain an effective powerband of almost 7,000 rpm. The car has rear-wheel-drive layout and is equipped with a 7-speed dual-clutch transmission developed by Graziano Trasmissioni. Power for the electric motor is stored in a 324-cell lithium-ion high-density battery pack located behind the cabin, developed by Johnson Matthey Battery Systems. The battery can be charged by the engine or through a plug-in equipment and can be fully charged in two hours. The car can be operated using either the petrol engine, the electric motor or with a combination of the two. The P1 has an all-electric range of at least on the combined European drive cycle. Under the EPA cycle, the range in EV mode is . During EV mode the P1 has a petrol consumption of 4.8g/100 mile, and as a result, EPA's all-electric range is rated as zero. The total range is . The P1 combined fuel economy in EV mode was rated by the EPA at 18 MPGe (13 L petrol equivalent/100 km; 22 mpg-imp petrol equivalent), with an energy consumption of 25 kW-hrs/100 mi and petrol consumption of 4.8 gal-US/100 mi. The combined fuel economy when running only with petrol is , for city driving, and in highway. pp. 35 The P1 has Formula 1 derived features such as the Instant Power Assist System (IPAS), which gives an instant boost in acceleration via the electric motor, a Drag Reduction System (DRS) which operates the car's rear wing, thereby increasing straight line speed, and a KERS. Both of these features (IPAS, DRS) are operated via two buttons on the steering wheel. It also generates a downforce of 600 kg at and it boasts of a drag coefficient of only . According to McLaren the P1 accelerates from in 2.8 seconds, in 6.8 seconds, and in 16.5 seconds, making it a full 5.5 seconds faster than the F1, and a standing quarter mile is claimed in 9.8 seconds at . Autocar tested mph in 2.8 seconds, mph in 6.9 seconds, the standing quarter mile in 10.2 seconds at , and the standing kilometre in 18.2 seconds at .Autocar road test No 5164 The P1 is electronically limited to a top speed of . The P1 has a dry weight of , giving it a power-to-weight ratio of 656 PS/tonne. It has a kerb weight of which translates to 601 PS/ tonne. The P1 also features bespoke Pirelli P-Zero Corsa tyres and specially developed carbon-ceramic rotor, caliper and brake pads from Akebono. According to McLaren it takes 6.2 seconds to brake from to standstill, during which the car will cover 246 metres. From , it will cover 30.2 metres.  Production and sales  The production version of the McLaren P1 was unveiled at the 2013 Geneva Motor Show. Production was strictly limited to 375 units which, according to McLaren, is to maintain exclusivity. In August 2013 McLaren announced that the production allocation destined to the Americas, Asia-Pacific and the Middle East was sold out. The cars destined for Europe were sold out by mid November 2013. The United States accounted for 34% of the limited production run, and Europe for 26%. After some delays, production began in October 2013. Hand-assembled by a team of 61 engineers, at a production rate of one car per day McLaren production was planned for fifty cars by the end of 2013. The first delivery to a retail customer took place at the company's headquarters in Woking, England, in October 2013, with 12 units manufactured by mid November 2013. The first P1 delivery in the U.S. occurred in May 2014. The production run ended in December 2015. According to JATO Dynamics, only twenty units had been registered worldwide during the first nine months of 2014.

Variants  = P1 GTR (2015-2016) = McLaren P1 GTR at the 2016 Goodwood Festival of Speed Celebrating 20 years since their victory in the 1995 24 Hours of Le Mans, McLaren announced that they would resurrect the GTR name by launching a track-only version of the P1, the P1 GTR. The P1 GTR was initially only available to P1 owners. The concept car made its debut at the 2014 Pebble Beach Concours d'Elegance in August 2014. The P1 GTR production model was officially unveiled at the 2015 Geneva Motor Show. This price includes a worldwide owners track day series; later cars were offered for less money, for those P1 owners who had no interest in the track series but still wanted to purchase the GTR variant. In total 58 cars were made. The P1 GTR went into production in 2015, after all the 375 standard P1s had been built, as a homage to its race-winning ancestor, the McLaren F1 GTR and were built, maintained and run by McLaren Special Operations. The P1 GTR's hybrid engine is rated at , representing an increase over the standard production P1, although McLaren did not disclose whether the power increase was from electrical boost or tuning the twin-turbocharged 3.8-litre V8. Performance figures remain unconfirmed. The weight of the P1 GTR was reduced by , achieving a power-to-weight ratio of per . This equates to a weight-to-power ratio of per horsepower. The car also featured slick tyres, and had greater levels of performance, grip, aerodynamics and downforce in comparison to the road car. Featuring a new fixed ride height on race-prepared suspension, a fixed rear wing capable of using DRS, and a new exclusively designed exhaust made of titanium and inconel. Due to its fixed rear wing, the GTR generates 10% more downforce than the road legal P1. The P1 GTR has a kerb weight of which includes the weight of the batteries. The P1 GTR can accelerate from 0-97 km/h (60 mph) in under 2.8 seconds, and will go on to reach a limited top speed of . Additionally, the P1 GTR will brake from to 0 in , and can corner at 1.54 G long with pulling a lateral acceleration of 2.5 g on the skidpad. In late 2015, historic racing team and McLaren F1 specialists Lanzante started undergoing road conversions of P1 GTRs for owners who wanted to drive their cars on the road. Thus far, 27 P1 GTRs have been converted for road use by Lanzante. The road legal version of the P1 GTR has a claimed top speed of 225 mph and a 0-60 mph time of 2.4 seconds. = P1 LM (2016-2017) = The P1 LM at the 2016 Goodwood Festival of Speed With the production run of the P1 GTR complete, and prompted by their efforts in converting track-only P1 GTRs to road-legal specification, Lanzante Motorsport commissioned McLaren Special Operations' Bespoke division to build a further total of 6 new P1 GTRs for them to develop into road-legal P1 LM variants. Of this production run, five P1 LMs were sold and the sixth, the prototype P1 LM codenamed 'XP1 LM', was retained and is now being used for development and testing of future models. In order to convert the cars into the P1 LM specification, Lanzante Motorsport made changes to the drivetrain hardware (to increase power output), employed a modified rear wing and larger front splitter along with dive planes (to improve downforce), removed the air-jack system and installed Inconel catalytic converter pipes and exhaust headers, lightweight fabricated charge coolers, Lexan windows, lighter seats (similar to those used in the F1 GTR) and a titanium exhaust system, bolts and fixings (to save weight). The result is a weight reduction of as compared to the McLaren P1 GTR as well as a 40 percent increase in downforce. The P1 LM also features a larger twin-turbocharged V8 engine than the P1 and P1 GTR at with an 8,500 rpm red line. The P1 LM has a total power output of and of torque, with being delivered at 7,250 rpm and an additional from its electric motor. The top speed is limited to . The tyre specifications are 275/30/19 for the front tyres and 335/30/20 for the rear tyres. At the 2016 Goodwood Festival of Speed, the prototype P1 LM, 'XP1 LM', set the fastest ever time for a road car up the Goodwood hillclimb, with a time of 47.07 seconds, driven by Kenny Bräck. On 27 April 2017, the prototype P1 LM, XP1 LM, continued its success on track, beating the road car lap record time at the Nürburgring Nordschleife, with a time of 6:43.22 using road legal Pirelli P Zero Trofeo R tyres but without a front number plate required for a car to be road legal. This lap time was once again set by Kenny Bräck, and announced on 26 May 2017.  One- off specials  = P1 GT = At the 2018 Goodwood Festival of Speed, Lanzante Motorsport, who had previously modified McLaren P1 GTRs to road legal specifications and developed the P1 LM, introduced a one-off special based on the P1 GTR. The new car called the P1 GT, is commissioned by a customer from the Middle East and is inspired by the McLaren F1 GT homologation special from the 1990s, including more aggressive body work than the standard car. Exterior modifications include a longer rear section, a larger rear wing, a longer front splitter, vented front fenders, removal of front canards, quad exhaust system in place of the original dual outlet design and a modified rear diffuser. The interior features fixed sports seats and Alcantara upholstery in tan and green colour along with a racing steering wheel and carbon fibre bits while the exterior features Silverstone green bodywork paying homage to the original homologation special. Power train modifications and performance figures remain unknown but are likely to have been increased as compared to the standard car owing to the extensive modifications.  Lap records  McLaren announced a sub-seven minute lap of the Nürburgring Nordschleife, which equates to an average speed in excess of , but did not publish the exact time. However, the P1 LM, which wasn't road legal during the run, beat the road car's record time at the Nordschleife with a time of 6:43.22.

The high altitude Afro-alpine Festuca grassland, or ‘Guassa” grass gives the area its name.  Location  GCCA lies at a latitude of 10° 15′ – 10° 27′ N and longitude of 39° 45′ – 39° 49′ E. The area is part of the Menz-Gera Administrative District in the North Shoa Administrative Zone of the regional state of Amhara Region. The district capital is the town of Mehal Meda located 20 km from the Guassa Area.  The Qero System  The Guassa Area originated as a community-based natural resource management system known as “Qero” over 400 years ago.Zelealem Tefera Ashenafi and Leader-Williams, N. (2006) The Resilient Nature of Common Property Resource Management System: Case study Central Highlands of Ethiopia. Paper Presented on the 12 International Conference of International Association for the Study of Common Property Resources. Bali, Indonesia. http://himaldoc.icimod.org/record/12345 It is one of the oldest known conservation areas in Sub-Saharan Africa. The Qero system is organized by two formally elected chiefs who oversee the beneficiary communities to ensure equitable resource distribution, and enforce the bylaws protecting the common property resources. Based on traditional tenure patterns, rules of protection and utilization as well as enforcement are essential aspects of the Qero system. Further organization of the user community into parishes gave the Guassa area the status of consecrated land, under the protective patronage of the parish, which reinforced the Qero system with the prestige, power, and authority of another important local level institution. In the process, the Guassa common property resources became a kind of sacred entity. Following the 1974 popular revolution, the government nationalized all rural land in the country, disbanded all local level land tenure and common property natural resource management institutions. This agrarian reform destroyed the functionality of the Qero system and the Guassa area was turned into an open access resource, which resulted in extreme decline of natural resources in the area.  The People of Guassa  The population of the Menz Gera Administrative District is about 111,000. The population is predominantly Amhara, one of the largest cultural ethnic groups in the country. Their language is Amharic, the official language of Ethiopia, which is a Semitic language descended from Ge’ez, the ancient liturgical language of Ethiopia now only used in the Ethiopian Orthodox Church to which most people belong.  Climate  Annual rainfall for Guassa averages 1,200 mm to 1,600 mm. The area is characterized by mild days and cold nights and is malaria free. In the driest months (December through February) the daytime temperature can rise to while at night it can fall to . There is frequent frost and fog in the dry season. The temperature variation is less in the wet season with a daytime temperature of and a nighttime temperature of . Guassa can be visited any time of the year, although persistent rainfall in July and August make that season least favorable.  Habitat  The Guassa Area ranges in altitude from 3,200 to 3,700 meters above sea level. The rugged mountain plateau is crosscut by gorges and river valleys running westwards. The area forms the watershed between the Nile and Awash River systems and thus performs an important hydrological function and catchment area. The eastern edge of the Guassa Area falls away abruptly as cliffs drop into the Great Rift Valley. Just 100 km away, the land melts into the Awash plain forming the floor of the Great Rift Valley.  Fauna  The Guassa area harbors nine (23%) of the endemic mammals of Ethiopia, including the Ethiopian wolf, the Gelada and the Ethiopian Highland hare. The Ethiopian wolf is legally protected and with a total world population of less than 450 is the most endangered canid in the world. With six packs of wolves, the Guassa area is a key population of the species. The gelada is the only living member of the once widespread genus Theropithecus and is only found in the highlands of northern Ethiopia. They live in large groups reaching up to 400 individuals where the spectacular males guard harems of females. Other mammals of the area include klipspringers, jackals, leopards, spotted hyenas, civets and servals.  Flora  Guassa supports important and endemic plant species including Guassa grass, giant lobelia, Erica moorlands, Helichrysum and Alchemilla species. The Afro-montane vegetation of the Guassa Area varies with altitude, and is a key attraction of the area. Other common plant species found in the area include Carex monostachya, Carex fischeri and Kniphofia foliosa of the family Asphodelaceae. Climbing in altitude, Euryops-Alchemilla shrubland occurs over 3,200 meters on flat, gentle slopes and well-drained areas. The shrubby vegetation of Euryops pinifolius (Compositae family is extensively used as firewood by the communities living adjacent to the Guassa Area. Above 3,200 meters, Euryops- Festuca grassland is usually interspersed with scattered structures similar to Mima mounds that can reach a height of 1.5 meters and a diameter of 5 to 10 meters. These mounds consist of highly organic and deep soil. They are made by rodents, the most important of which is the common mole rat. As the altitude increases, the vegetation changes abruptly to Helichrysum-Festuca type of grassland followed by Erica moorland. The torch lily or red-hot poker (Kniphofia spp.) covers entire hillsides with its flame-colored flowers between June and November. The palm-like giant lobelia (Lobelia rhynchopetalum) is most spectacular and reaches up to 12 meters in height.  Avifauna  114 bird species have been recorded in the Guassa Area: 12% of the 862 species of birds in Ethiopia. The area is also home to a multitude of birds of prey and serves as a wintering ground for 38 species of Palearctic and intra-African migratory birds. Endemic birds include: Ankober serin (Serinus ankoberensis), Abyssinian catbird (Parophasma galinieri), Abyssinian longclaw (Macronyx flavicollis), blue-winged goose (Cyanochen cyanoptera), Ethiopian/black-headed siskin (Serinus nigriceps), black-winged lovebird (Agapornis taranta), Rouget's rail (Rougetius rougetii), spot-breasted plover (Vanellus melanocephalus), thick-billed raven (Corvus crassirostris), wattled ibis (Bostrychia carunculata), white-collared pigeon (Columba albitorques) and white-winged cliff chat (Myrmecocichla semirufa).

He published works concerning Roman and German law, Canon law and Church History. Biography A Lutheran, Sohm studied Law in Rostock,See entries of Rudolph Sohm in Rostock Matrikelportal Berlin, Heidelberg and Munich between 1860 and 1864. His doctoral dissertation in 1864 at the University of Rostock was on Roman Law; he then worked on German legal history and devoted himself to ecclesiastical law. He lectured in German Law and Commercial Law at the University of Göttingen from 1866 to 1870, before being appointed professor at that university in 1870. He was professor in Canon Law and German Law at the University of Freiburg im Breisgau 1870 to 1872, and at the University of Strasbourg from 1872 to 1887, and was appointed Rector in 1882. From 1887 until his death in 1917 he was professor of Canon Law and German Law in the Faculty of Law at the University of Leipzig.Sohm on the University of Leipzig website In 1892 he published the first volume of his great work Kirchenrecht (Canon Law).Rudolf Sohm, Kirchenrecht. Leipzig: Duncher & Humblot, 1892. The second volume was published posthumously in 1923. In this work Sohm argued that the Early Church had no legal constitution. He stated that \\"ecclesiastical law stands in contradiction to the nature of Ecclesia.\\" The Early Church, he argued, was ruled not by legal concepts but by a power he called \\"charisma\\" (from the Greek 'charis'), which is \\"a gift of grace\\" bestowed by the Holy Spirit. In his work Sohm explored how the charismatically based Jesus movement of the Early Church changed into the legalistic bureaucracy of Roman Catholicism. The sociologist Max Weber derived his concept 'charismatic authority' from Sohm's 'charismatic organization,' a term Sohm had coined in Kirchenrecht to describe the social organization of primitive Christianity. Kirchenrecht was immediately recognized in Germany as an epoch-making work. It also stimulated a debate between Sohm and leading theologians and religion scholars which lasted more than twenty years and stimulated a rich polemical literature.Smith, David Norman. \\"Faith, Reason, and Charisma: Rudolf Sohm, Max Weber, and the Theology of Grace,\\" Sociological Inquiry, 68:1 pp. 32-60, 1998, p. 37. Sohm was one of the committee of 22 members, comprising not only jurists but also representatives of financial interests and of the various ideological currents of the time, who compiled a second draft of the Bürgerliches Gesetzbuch (German Civil Code) which was accepted by the Reichstag in 1896.

History =1970s and 1980s= Company founders Mark Penn and Douglas Schoen met at the Horace Mann prep school, where they were both students, and they later attended Harvard University together. In 1974, Schoen brought Penn into Hugh Carey's campaign for New York governor and in 1977, they established the firm. In 1977, Penn and Schoen were hired by consultant David Garth to carry out polling for Ed Koch's campaign for mayor of New York City. The company introduced overnight tracking polls and computer analysis of results, which informed the campaign's media strategy and helped Koch win the election. In the 1980s, they first began working with international clients, including Israeli prime minister Menachem Begin. According to the New York Times, the firm's use of computerized polling analysis and specialized personnel for direct-mail were key innovations in political campaigns of the period. =1990s and 2000s= Michael Berland joined the company in 1990 and it became known as Penn, Schoen & Berland Associates. During the 1990s, the company increasingly focused on corporate clients, but in 1995, Schoen and Penn began working with Bill Clinton, using their experience from the corporate world and previous political clients to advise on his day-to-day communications and his 1996 reelection campaign. In November 2001, Penn Schoen Berland was acquired by the London-based media and communications company WPP Group plc. Later that year, the company founded its media and entertainment practice. The company then became a division of Burson-Marsteller and part of the Young & Rubicam group of companies. In July 2012, Mark Penn left both Burson-Marsteller and Penn Schoen Berland Company chairman Donald A. Baer led Penn Schoen Berland following Penn's departure. In October 2012, Burson-Marsteller executive vice president Jay Leveton was named PSB's interim CEO. In December 2019, Peter Horst was named PSB's CEO. In May 2020, PSB rebranded as PSB Insights, reflecting a portfolio of comprehensive capabilities spanning behavioral and social analytics, deep marketing sciences, and all forms of qualitative and quantitative research. Corporate overview PSB is a global insights and analytics consultancy. For more than 40 years, PSB has provided actionable insights and guidance for corporate, government and public sector clients in over 100 countries. With deep expertise across qualitative and quantitative research and social and predictive analytics, PSB brings an integrative approach to helping clients solve their most complex challenges and win in highly competitive situations. PSB is a member of the BCW Group of companies, which is part of WPP(NYSE:WPP), a creative transformation company. The firm has American offices in New York City, Washington, Denver, Seattle, and Los Angeles and international offices in London and Dubai. Worldwide, PSB has more than 200 consultants. Campaigns and elections Through its work on various political campaigns, the company has helped more than 25 political leaders to be elected in Asia, Europe, Latin America, and the U.S. =Early campaigns= Early political campaigns on which Penn and Schoen worked include Hugh Carey's New York gubernatorial campaign in 1974 and Ed Koch's New York mayoral campaign in 1977, for which the company supervised the direct-mail campaign and polling. Initially, Penn and Schoen manually input data from surveys onto punch cards, which was labor-intensive and subject to errors. For Koch's campaign, Penn built and programmed a computer to process the survey results, allowing them to analyze polling data much more quickly. The company also pioneered the use of overnight tracking polls, the results of which helped Koch to win the election. =Bill Clinton= PSB was hired by the Clinton administration in 1995 to help change the White House political strategy leading up to the 1996 election the company helped Bill Clinton to develop his \\"new Democrat\\" language and policies. For example, the term \\"bridge to the 21st century\\" were developed with help from Penn, who advised Clinton to begin using such market-tested phrases. In 1996, the company worked on Clinton's successful re-election campaign, helping him to win on an updated platform. For the firm's work on the 1996 election, Time magazine dubbed Penn and Schoen \\"Masters of the Message\\" in an article focused on the campaign and their influence. PSB continued to provide polling and advice during Clinton's second term. One notable PSB poll led directly to the policy of placing Social Security first in priorities for spending the budget surplus of 1997. In Clinton's 1998 State of the Union address, he called for Congress to focus first on Social Security in allocating the surplus funds. =Michael Bloomberg= In 2001 and 2005, PSB provided polling for Michael Bloomberg's New York mayoral campaigns. In the 2001 campaign, the firm carried out polling to gather information about New Yorkers' opinions. PSB was hired again by Bloomberg for his re-election campaign in 2005. The firm provided \\"voter-list development\\" and created \\"the most sophisticated database ever developed for a municipal election\\", according to The New York Post. =Tony Blair= Penn was hired by then-Prime Minister Tony Blair in 2005 to provide advice for the upcoming UK general election. He became part of the Labour Party's election team, working on strategy to gain voters who would traditionally have voted for the Conservative Party. The strategy helped Labour, with Blair in leadership, to win a third term for the first time in the party's history. =Hillary Clinton= PSB first worked with Hillary Clinton on her successful campaign in 2000 to become New York's junior senator. In 2007 and 2008, PSB provided Clinton with polling, direct mail, and other services for the Democratic presidential nomination. As part of services provided by the firm, Penn became Clinton's communications adviser, employing a team of 20 employees to carry out the routine campaign work. In April 2008, it was disclosed that, in his role as chief executive of Burson-Marsteller, Penn had met with Colombian government representatives to discuss promoting a free-trade agreement opposed by Clinton. Penn stepped down from his role as chief strategist but he and PSB continued to poll and provide advice for the campaign. =Venezuela= PSB organized polling during the Venezuelan recall referendum of 2004 of President Hugo Chávez and released poll results on election day, predicting that 59 percent of voters were in favor of recalling Chávez. The following day, the referendum results were almost the exact opposite of the poll results: the results showed that 58 percent opposed recalling the president. Schoen stated that he believed the referendum \\"was a massive fraud\\" and Penn noted that PSB's two previous exit polls in Venezuela had correctly predicted the final results. The results of the referendum were endorsed by César Gaviria, secretary general of the Organization of American States, and former U.S. president Jimmy Carter, who monitored the vote. Leaders of the opposition refused to accept the results, citing PSB's exit poll as proof of fraud. The 20,000 responses in the exit poll produced a large amount of data, leading to an extremely low sampling error. According to the Center for Economic and Policy Research, because the chance of sample error in the exit poll was so low and observers did not find any signs of fraud, it may have been the survey's methodology that led to the discrepancy in results. PSB was criticized in the press for how the poll was carried out because the company used members of a Venezuelan group called Súmate for fieldwork. The group had been involved in organizing the recall and were considered anti- Chávez by the Venezuelan government. In a paper published in academic journal Latin American Perspectives, Daniel Hellinger stated that the results of the poll \\"were very likely skewed by overrepresentation of voters in areas where [Súmate] volunteers were willing to conduct their interviews.\\"> However, at the time, the company stated that the issues were with the voting, not the exit poll. Following the exit poll, Penn replaced Schoen as PSB's representative for Venezuela. =Other campaigns and elections= In 1999, the firm carried out polls in Serbia, commissioned by the National Democratic Institute of Washington in support of Slobodan Milošević's democratic opponents. The polls found that the majority of voters disapproved of Milosevic's performance and wanted him to resign, supporting the view held in the U.S. that he was unlikely to win re-election. In 2004, PSB organized an exit poll in Ukraine for the presidential election. The poll was commissioned by the Ukrainian ICTV television channel. The firm also conducted polling in Italy in 2006, on behalf of Silvio Berlusconi's Forza Italia party. Berlusconi stated that in final polls before the election he was tied with opposition leader Romano Prodi, although polls carried out by other firms had shown that Prodi would win by approximately 5 percent. In the final results, Prodi won by less than 0.1 percent of the vote. PSB's South Asia office, led by former CEO of Genesis Burson-Marsteller (GBM) and Asia Pacific Board Member of Burson- Marsteller (B-M) Ashwani Singla, was appointed as the pollster for the 2014 Lok Sabha elections by the Bharatiya Janta Party (BJP). The firm carried out three waves of polling, including over three hundred thousand interviews, to generate campaign strategy to win the mandate of the people of India to form the government. BJP scored an unprecedented victory, securing a single party majority not seen for the last three decades in election history. Corporate work PSB's corporate work has focused on leveraging the experience gained in political campaigns to guide its research, advice, and communications for numerous Fortune 500 companies. The company's major corporate clients have included AT&T;, Ford, McDonald’s, Citibank, Facebook and Microsoft. =Notable corporate work= In 1993, PSB advised AT&T; and analyzed its advertising strategy in order to help refocus the phone company and to compete with MCI Inc.. The research by PSB, including polling data on lifestyle and behavior, found that AT&T;'s strategies had previously not included niche groups such as immigrants making calls to their home country. Following PSB's advice, AT&T; used niche-market details in commercials and specially targeted offers to gain these customers. Microsoft has been a client of PSB since the 1990s. Penn advised Bill Gates on the campaign to prevent Microsoft from being broken up, which was mandated by the 2000 court decision in the anti-trust case brought by the U.S. Justice Department. The company also provided key research into consumer opinions about Microsoft following the court case. PSB has been a strategic partner of Microsoft's for over 20 years. It works closely with a range of business units and research teams, helping Microsoft with product development and marketing, strategic communications, brand measurement, and advertising testing. More recently, PSB has been named Microsoft's vendor of record for social listening and behavioral analysis. In 2004, PSB carried out research for McDonald's in the UK when the fast food company was concerned about negative public opinion following the release of the film Super Size Me. PSB's surveys of consumers and stakeholder groups found that food quality was a high priority among these audiences. The results led to the initiation of an advertising campaign focusing on food quality. From the early 1990s, PSB has conducted surveys of fans for Major League Baseball. According to MLB commissioner Bud Selig, the research led to changes in the structure of the sport including expansion of playoffs and interleague play. In 1997, while MLB was deciding whether to pursue geographic realignment of teams, PSB carried out research including surveys and focus groups of fans. The company found that a majority of fans were in favor of such realignment. The company conducted research for Ford in 2009 and 2010, focused on its in-car electronics. A 2009 PSB poll to support Ford's sales case for built-in electronics found that 93 percent of those surveyed agree with the idea of a nationwide ban on texting while driving. In 2010, Ford introduced technology to allow parents to prevent teenage drivers listening to explicit radio content based on PSB survey data. In 2015, Ford was preparing to introduce a redesigned F-150 truck, featuring an aluminum body. PSB conducted research to determine the most effective messages to promote the new F-150, while neutralizing any potential attacks about its durability and safety. By describing the materials as “military-grade aluminum alloys” and emphasizing that the same materials are used by the US Military in their advanced attack vehicles, Ford was able to position their #1 selling vehicle as the toughest truck on the market.(2019), https://corporate.ford.com/articles/products/f-150-body-of-work.html, Ford Since 2013, PSB has partnered with Facebook on numerous research challenges including brand positioning, reputation strategy, crisis management, messaging and communication strategy, concept testing and naming, brand tracking, and cognitive testing. PSB works closely with multiple Facebook teams spanning the Facebook Inc. brand and its family of products including Facebook (mobile and browser), Messenger, and Oculus. The work has helped shape many Facebook offerings including News Feed, Watch, Messenger, Marketplace, Portal, Groups, Mentorship, Dating, and News. Entertainment and media The company's entertainment and media practice was founded in 2001 and provides research for magazine publishers, film studios, and video game publishers, including marketing positioning, test screenings, focus groups, creative advertising testing, and box office tracking. In 2012, PSB expanded this area of its business with the acquisition of First Movies International, an entertainment market research company. Major entertainment and media clients of PSB include Disney, Paramount Pictures, and Condé Nast, for whom the company carried out research to decide on a name for its former business magazine, Condé Nast Portfolio. Public Research =Aspen Institute studies= PSB has also conducted studies for the Aspen Institute and the related Aspen Ideas Festival. Partnering with Time magazine and the Aspen Institute in 2011, PSB polled Americans on their opinions of the decade following the September 11th terrorist attacks. The following year, the company conducted polls on Americans' attitudes towards the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act which was commissioned by The Atlantic and the Aspen Institute. =Global Corporate Reputation Index= In 2012, the company released its \\"Global Corporate Reputation Index\\" at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland. The index listed the top 25 consumer companies by reputation. The research for the index was conducted in partnership with Burson-Marsteller, Landor Associates, and Brand Asset Consulting, and consisted of 40,000 interviews in 6 countries, focusing on the qualities associated with nearly 6,000 companies. =Arab Youth Survey= For 11 years, ASDA’A, BCW and PSB have presented evidence-based insights into the attitudes of Arab youth via its Arab Youth Survey, providing public and private sector organisations with data and analysis to make effective decisions and policies. It is the largest survey of its kind, conducted in 15 Arab states and territories with 3,300 face-to-face interviews with young Arabs ages 18–24.(2020), https://www.arabyouthsurvey.com/, Arab Youth Survey Selected awards Mark Penn was named Pollster of the year in 1996 and 2000 by the American Association of Political Consultants, for the company's political polling. PSB received a Telly Award in 2008 for its work on Dominion's \\"Every Day\\" Campaign, a Pollie Award in 2009 for Television Advertising for its \\"3AM\\" commercial for Hillary Clinton's presidential campaign, and a Reed Award in 2011 for Best Radio Ad from Campaigns and Elections magazine for work done for the National Association of Convenience Stores.

He rose to be a respected and tactical leader of the Cree Nation in the latter part of the 19th century. At the onset of his leadership, the plains buffalo herds were abundant in the northern plains and parklands, providing greatly to the social, environmental, and economical balance vital to the survival of the Cree. By the 1860s, the buffalo were rapidly disappearing and with the arrival of the European settlers this balance became altered. Chief Ahtahkakoop understood that the ways of living that his band was used to needed to change in order for it and its future generations to survive. Together with his friend and fellow Chief, Mistāwasis (\\"Big Child\\"), he signed the 1876 Treaty 6 as the second signatory chief at Fort Carlton, Saskatchewan. By signing this treaty he agreed to relocate his band to a 67 square miles reserve at Sandy Lake, 45 miles northwest of present-day Prince Albert, Saskatchewan. Early life Ahtahkakoop was born about 1816 in the Saskatchewan River country. Ahtahkakoop John Chatelain was born to a French/French-Metis father, Antoine Chatelain, and to a lady of Metis origin, Okimawinotook. He was one of five brothers. The remainder being named: Masuskapoe Chatelain, Sasakamoose Jacob Chatelain, Ahenakew David Chatelain, and Nāpēskis Chatelain. Ahtahkakoop's own descendants, and that of his brothers, are thought to be quite extensive although not completely compiled. Canadian buffaloes grazing. Ahathkakoop was brought up with the traditional values and way of life of the Plains Cree peoples. Thus, Ahtahkakoop was raised in a hunter-gatherer society. Every summer his family, in addition to other band members, would travel from their camps to the prairie grassland. Here they would hunt buffalo, and gather roots, herbs, and berries. The buffalo were especially important to the survival of Ahtahkakoop's people. Buffalo not only provided food but also their hides, which were used for a variety of purposes; from tipi covers and clothing to storage bags and cooking vessels. During the winter his people would separate back into their family groups and move to the parklands. Throughout the winter, in addition to buffalo, his family would hunt elk, moose, and deer. Once the weather began to warm towards the end of winter, birds such as geese and ducks would return to these lands, which would also be hunted. During this time sap from maple and birch trees would be gathered and turned into syrup and sugar. Spirituality was also an important aspect of life for the Plains Cree. From a young age Ahtahkakoop would have been familiar with the stories of the Creator (māmawiwiyohtāwīmaw), his spirit helpers, and their place on Mother Earth. He also learnt about the various ceremonies, prayers, and songs involved in said ceremonies. When he was old enough Ahtahkakoop would have taken part in these ceremonies, such as being able to smudge and purify himself, pipe ceremonies, and sweat lodges. A very significant ritual that Ahtahkakoop would have taken part in during his early life was his vision quest. Around the age of 14, Ahtahkakoop would have left his family to seclude himself in the hills or forests around his camp. There, without food or water, he fasted in hopes of receiving a vision from the Creator. This ritual was an important part of puberty and a rite of passage.  Ahtahkakoop the Chief  Throughout his adult life Ahtahkakoop was noted for his leadership skills. Even when he was still a young-adult, others noticed his knack for taking on responsibility and effectively leading his people. He often knew the best places to set up camps and where to hunt for buffalo, in addition to his impressive hunting skills. Most notable were his skills as a warrior. Many stories were told about his great war feats against other tribesmen. In many, such as a clash with the Blackfoot warriors, he was outnumbered yet was still able to lead his party to victory while keeping his men unscathed. This not only showed others his potential as an impressive leader, but also how the spirits favoured him and how powerful his spirit helpers were. Although there is no certain date, it is believed that Ahtahkakoop was recognized as a chief no later than some time in the 1850s (although potentially earlier). Ahtahkakoop's band was part of the Fort People (wāskaahikaniyiniwak), so called for their close proximity to Fort Carlton. The territory of the Fort People spanned north, west, and south-west of Fort Carlton, although Ahtahkakoop's typical hunting grounds were located north of the Bad Hill (maci-waciy), north-west of modern-day Rosetown. The other major chief of the Fort People at this time was Mistawasis. Ahtahkakoop and Mistawasis were close allies and friends throughout their lives, often camping near one another and spending their summers hunting with each other's peoples. Their families were also closely linked. Ahtahkakoop's eldest son Kā-miyo-ahcahkwēw (Good Spirit) married Mistawasis' daughter Judique, and Ahtahkakoop's daughter Isabella married Mistawasis' eldest son Wēyatōkwapew (Lively Man). The two men also worked closely together when hunting and trapping for the Hudson's Bay Company, who recognised both of these men as prominent chiefs. As a recognized chief, and a man of high rank, it was appropriate for Ahtahkakoop to take on multiple wives. He is known to have had at least three wives, one of which, named Mary, was the daughter of Nātowēw (although the names of the other women are unknown). These women would have been important in sharing the workload of the band as a whole in addition to organizing family matters. The women were all likely from other prominent bands, as interband marriages were pivotal in creating ties and alliances.  John Hines  Fort Carlton, 1872. In the summer of 1874, Ahtahkakoop and his band traveled to Fort Carlton to pick up supplies before heading out to hunt buffalo. While at the stop in Carlton he met the young missionary, John Hines, only in passing. However, Ahtahkakoop had been hoping to meet someone that could help his people transition and adapt to the changing world around them. The two men parted ways, with Ahtahkakoop leaving for the hunt and Hines setting out to build a new home for himself. However, when Ahtahkakoop heard that Hines was living nearby at a site on Whitefish Lake he decided to pay Hines a visit. During this visit Ahtahkakoop suggested to Hines that he should join them and move his settlement to Sandy Lake (yēkawiskāwikamāw) to be a minister there. In October of the same year, Hines moved his settlement to Sandy Lake, camping on Ahtahkakoop's land, which was much more appropriate for cultivation than his previous settlement sites. This was not Ahtahkakoop's first encounter with missionaries. Prior to his encounter with Hines, Roman Catholic priests had visited Ahtahkakoop and his people. Ahtahkakoop had allowed for these priests to baptize his children. Ahtahkakoop had yet to be converted and baptized when Hines arrived at his camp. He was baptized 20 May 1877 along with his wife, who had been cautious about converting under the Church of England due to the fact that this church differed from that of her children. Ahtahkakoop not only introduced Hines and his religious teachings to his own people but also other bands, such as that of Mistawasis and Okinomotayew of Stony Lake. He stated that it was neither the work of Hines nor his own work that led to the spread of Christianity, but that rather people converted of their own accord. Ahtahkakoop was under the impression that the previous missionaries under the Roman Catholic Church that visited his people would send somebody to educate his children, and others in his band, which they had stated they would. However, he was underwhelmed by these missionaries and was therefore excited for Hines to start educating his children and others at his camp. Therefore, Hines established a day school at Ahtahkakoop's site. He later set up additional day schools at other camps, one of which at Stony Lake which was run by one of Hine's previous pupils that had been taught at the school at Sandy Lake. Ahtahkakoop was not only concerned about religious and practical teachings that Hines could provide but also agricultural teaching. Ahtahkakoop was aware of the changing economic world around him. With the drastic decrease in buffalo populations, which the Cree people had been so reliant on, Ahtahkakoop decided that turning to agriculture would provide the best and most stable economic income for the band. Therefore, Hines taught Ahtahkakoop and his people various agricultural tools, such as how to sow grain and plant gardens. At any given time, Ahtahkakoop's land had anywhere between 20 and 120 acres of land in use for agricultural purposes. In later years the Government of Canada praised Ahtahkakoop and Hines on their agricultural efforts.  Treaty 6  Engraved treaty medal presented to all chiefs that signed Treaty 6. On August 15, 1876, Ahtahkakoop, along with various other chiefs and officials met at Fort Carlton. On August 18, negotiations began and by August 23 Treaty Six had been signed first by Mistawasis, followed by Ahtahkakoop and 11 other chiefs, overseen by Lieutenant-Governor Alexander Morris. Each chief was presented with a medal and flag, and as head chiefs Ahtahkakoop and Mistawasis were presented with the chief's government uniform which included a gold-trimmed scarlet coat, a felt top hat, pants, a shirt, and a handkerchief. They were told that by accepting this uniform they became representatives on the kingdom and the Queen. Ahtahkakoop, aware of the many changes that were taking place in the world around him (especially with the decline of the buffalo and increase of settler populations), saw the need to learn and embrace a new way of life. Ahtahkakoop was concerned not only for his own people, but all future generations to come, and so he saw the signing of the treaty and upholding of treaty terms as vital in the success of his people. Some other chiefs were not so quick to seek help from the government. Chiefs Poundmaker, Badger, and Young Chipewyan spoke out against signing the treaty and the dividing of land that would come along with it. However, after hearing speeches from Ahtahkakoop and Mistawasis were swayed by their opinions on why the treaty was important for the success of their people. Lieutenant-Governor Alexander Morris As a chief, Ahtahkakoop signed on behalf of all of his people who wished to peacefully share the land with settlers and the government. Therefore, Ahtahkakoop and his fellow chiefs bargained hard in order to receive as much help as possible for his people. Despite the fact the Ahtahkakoop and his people had already started to transition into relying on agriculture for food and income, he recognized that there needed to be some sort of safety net in place for his people in case times got tough. Therefore, a key part of the treaty was the inclusion of the famine clause and the medicine chest; resources that would be kept with and Indian Agent on each reserve in the case of famine and medical emergencies such as the outbreak of disease (such as smallpox and tuberculosis). The chiefs also asked for further support as they transitioned to an agricultural based life, such as more supplies and oxen to help ease this transition. Despite the best intentions of Ahtahkakoop, there were misunderstandings in regards to the way in which the terms of the treaty would be upheld, due to differences in traditions between the Cree and the European settlers. Ahtahkakoop and the other chiefs understood that everything that was said and promised orally during the negotiations would be legitimate due to the fact that there was a sacred pipe present during the negotiations. However, the government officials understood that only what was written down in the treaty was legitimate, and because of the use of interpreters there was a miscommunication on both sides as to what was and was not included as part of the treaty. It is likely that when Morris arrived at Fort Carlton a significant portion of Treaty 6 was already written out. However, Ahtahkakoop and the other chiefs did successfully persuade Morris to include additional terms to the treaty. This was satisfactory to Ahtahkakoop, who knew that it was not possible to come to an agreement on every single issue that was presented by himself and the other chiefs.  North-West Rebellion  North-West Mounted Police on patrol during the North- West rebellion. On March 20, 1885, Ahtahkakoop was met with a messenger from Fort Carlton at his door. He was informed by this messenger that the Métis had stolen arms and ammunition from storage, and had taken men as prisoners. Ahtahkakoop quickly got ready, picked up Mistawasis, and started his journey towards the fort. Upon their arrival at Fort Carlton the chiefs were met by many men, many of whom were from Prince Albert, that had shown up to help defend the fort. They were told that Louis Riel had gained power by creating his own provisional government, had organised a rebellion, and that he and Gabriel Dumont were demanding that the fort be turned over to them. Riel claimed that his actions were justified, as he believed that the government had failed to help the Métis in times of need. Ahtahkakoop and Mistawasis were both questioned as to where their loyalties lay. Both men were set on honouring the treaty that they had signed together less than 10 years earlier. They stated that instead they would stay neutral during the events. Both men by this time were close to the age of 70, and despite their impressive past as warriors, they were doubtful that they would be much help on the battlefield. Therefore, they told officials that if they were unable to stop Riel and his men via force, they would take their people to Prince Albert to keep them safe. Happy with the men's promises to remain loyal, officials stated that they would provide protection and supplies to their people in the case of evacuation. Despite being asked multiple times by Riel to join his forces, the men stayed true to their words and remained neutral throughout this troubled time.  Legacy  Ahtahkakoop died 4 December 1896 at the age of about 80 years, struck by what is believed to have been a heart attack while out on a walk with his grandson Pacī (James Starblanket). He was buried on the reserve that was named after him.\\"Ahtahkakoop\\" in the Encyclopedia of Saskatchewan In 1993 a high school named after him was built on the Ahtahkakoop Reserve. The building of this school not only honours him but also other band members, which can be seen in the school's Hall of Achievement which displays the accomplishments of the Cree peoples.

In the film, a divorced US Capitol Police officer named John Cale attempts rescuing both his daughter Emily and the President of the United States James Sawyer when a massively destructive terrorist assault occurs in the White House. The film stars Channing Tatum, Jamie Foxx, Maggie Gyllenhaal, Joey King, Jason Clarke, Richard Jenkins, and James Woods. Released on June 28, 2013 by Sony Pictures, White House Down received mixed reviews from critics toward the screenwriting and the clichéd storyline, although the performances and action sequences were praised. The film was a box office bomb, grossing over $205 million worldwide against budget of $150 million. White House Down was one of two films released in 2013 that dealt with a terrorist attack on the White House; the other, Olympus Has Fallen, was released three months earlier. Plot U.S. President James Sawyer (Jamie Foxx) makes a controversial proposal to remove military forces from the Middle East. Divorced veteran John Cale (Channing Tatum) works as a Capitol Police officer assigned to Speaker of the House Eli Raphelson (Richard Jenkins), whose nephew he saved while serving in Afghanistan. Cale hopes to impress his daughter Emily (Joey King) by interviewing for the Secret Service Presidential Detail, getting tickets for them to tour the White House. His interviewer, Deputy Special Agent-in-Charge Carol Finnerty (Maggie Gyllenhaal), a college acquaintance, deems him unqualified for the job. Meanwhile, a bomb is detonated in the United States Capitol, collapsing the rotunda and sending Washington, D.C. into lockdown. Finnerty escorts Raphelson to an underground command center in the Pentagon, while Vice President Alvin Hammond (Michael Murphy) is taken aboard Air Force One. A team of mercenaries led by ex-Delta Force operative Emil Stenz (Jason Clarke) infiltrate the White House disguised as video technicians and overwhelm the Secret Service, seizing the building. The tour group is taken hostage in the Blue Room by white nationalist Carl Killick (Kevin Rankin), but Cale escapes to search for Emily, separated during the tour. Retiring Head of the Presidential Detail Special Agent-in-Charge Martin Walker (James Woods) brings Sawyer to the PEOC beneath the Library. Inside, Walker kills Sawyer's detail, revealing himself as the leader of the attack, apparently seeking vengeance against Sawyer for his Marine son, who was killed in a botched mission in Iran the year prior. Cale kills a mercenary, taking his weapon and radio, and rescues Sawyer after overhearing Walker. Walker brings in ex-NSA analyst Skip Tyler (Jimmi Simpson) to hack the PEOC's defense system, but requires Sawyer to activate the nuclear football. Killick catches Emily filming the intruders on her phone and takes her hostage. Cale and Sawyer contact the command structure via scrambler in the residence, whereas Finnerty is using Emily's YouTube video to discover the mercenaries' identities. Cale and Sawyer try to escape via a secret tunnel but find the exit rigged with explosives. They escape in the presidential limo but are chased by Stenz and fall into the White House pool. With Sawyer and Cale presumed dead in an explosion in the cabana, the Twenty-fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution is invoked; Hammond is sworn in as president. Cale and Sawyer, still alive, learn Hammond has ordered an aerial incursion to re- acquire the White House, but the mercenaries shoot down the helicopters. Learning Emily's identity from the video, Stenz takes her to Walker in the Oval Office. Hacking into NORAD, Tyler launches a missile at Air Force One from Piketon, Ohio, killing Hammond and everyone on board. Raphelson is sworn in as president and orders an air strike on the White House. Sawyer surrenders himself to save Emily. Walker, blaming Iran for his son's death, demands Sawyer use the football to launch nuclear missiles against various Iranian cities. Sawyer refuses, while Cale sets fire to several rooms as a diversion. Tyler inadvertently triggers the tunnel explosives and is vaporized. Killing most of the mercenaries and freeing the hostages, Cale blows Stenz up with a grenade belt. Sawyer attacks Walker, but in the fight Walker uses Sawyer's handprint to activate the football and shoots Sawyer, much to Emily's fury. Before Walker can finally launch the missiles, Cale crashes a reinforced Chevrolet Suburban into the Oval Office and kills him with the car's rotary cannon. Emily runs outside and waves off the incoming fighter planes with a presidential flag, calling off the air strike. Sawyer survives thanks to a pocket watch that stopped Walker's bullet. With Finnerty's help Cale realizes that Raphelson was Walker's accomplice, having acted at the behest of the corrupt military–industrial complex. Believing Sawyer dead and that Cale has no proof, Raphelson is tricked into confessing and arrested for treason. Sawyer names Cale his new special agent and takes him and Emily on an aerial tour of DC on Marine One, aboard which he receives word that France, Russia, China, Israel and Iran have agreed to his peace deal after learning of the events at the White House, calling for an end to all wars.

Production White House Down is directed by Roland Emmerich and based on a screenplay by James Vanderbilt, who is also one of the film's producers. Sony Pictures purchased Vanderbilt's spec script in March 2012 for , in what The Hollywood Reporter called \\"one of the biggest spec sales in quite a while\\". The journal said the script was similar \\"tonally and thematically\\" to the films Die Hard and Air Force One. In the following April, Sony hired Roland Emmerich as director. Emmerich began filming in July 2012 at the La Cité Du Cinéma in Montreal, Quebec, Canada. Cinematographer Anna Foerster shot the film with Arri Alexa Plus digital cameras. In 2012, Sony competed with Millennium Films, who were producing Olympus Has Fallen (also about a takeover of the White House) to complete casting and to begin filming. Release White House Down was originally scheduled for a November 1, 2013 release, but was moved up to a June 28, 2013 release. The film was released on DVD and Blu-ray Disc on November 5, 2013. Reception =Critical response= On review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes the film holds an approval rating of 51% based on 199 reviews, with a weighted average of 5.4/10.

Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of \\"A-\\" on an A+ to F scale. Roth Cornet of IGN gives it a 6.5/10, concluding: \\"White House Down is a pretty silly rehashing of previously tread action movie territory, but if you're willing to laugh along with (or even at) it, it can be a highly entertaining experience.\\" Andrew Chan of the Film Critics Circle of Australia writes, \\"I am not entirely sure, whether I should be happy or sad that I laughed when someone got shot or bombed, but such is the manner of how the film is played out.\\" =Box office= White House Down grossed $73.1 million in the United States, and $132.3 million internationally, for a total gross of $205.4 million, against a budget of $150 million. The film made $24.8 million in North American during its opening weekend, coming in below expectations and finishing fourth at the box office.

The release of the album coincided with Pete Waterman Presents The Hit Factory Live, a concert that was due to take place in London’s Hyde Park on 11 July 2012 and featuring the classic artists from the 'Hit Factory' era together on one bill. Both Kylie Minogue and Jason Donovan were due to perform their million selling duet 'Especially for You' alongside Rick Astley, Sinitta, Bananarama and Hazell Dean but the concert was ultimately cancelled due to poor weather conditions.

The boy ran his arcade from his father's auto parts store in East Los Angeles during mid-2011. Mullick was inspired to make the documentary after unexpectedly coming across the arcade while getting a door-handle for his car. Mullick became Caine's first customer, purchasing a $2 Fun Pass, and decided to make a film about Caine's Arcade after witnessing the level of commitment, work, and thought Caine had put into the arcade. After learning he had been Caine's first and only customer, Mullick arranged for a surprise flash mob of customers using social media to come play Caine's Arcade, which was included as part of the movie. The film, on its release to YouTube, soon became a viral video. Numerous people donated money towards a college fund Mullick established for Caine. Subsequently, schools around the world have recreated similar cardboard arcades, and the positive response inspired Mullick and team to start the Imagination Foundation, a non-profit aimed at fostering creativity and entrepreneurship in more adults across the world. Background Before 2011, Caine had spent weekends with his father George Monroy at the store, during which he had tried selling goods, including yard signs for supporting sports teams and snacks and drinks from vending machines. He found little success; Monroy's store was in an industrial area of East Los Angeles with little foot traffic, and his store was more a physical warehouse for sales made over the Internet. In summer 2011, Caine found many of the discarded boxes from the store and asked for his father's permission to create the arcade in the front, which George supported. Caine built and designed all the games himself, creating a ticket and prize redemption system, originally using some of his old toys such as Hot Wheels cars and then into items bought at dollar stores as prizes. Caine would operate the arcade \\"machines\\", retrieving balls and dispensing tickets to the player. During a family vacation to Palm Springs, Caine had asked for a t-shirt, with \\"Caine's Arcade\\" on one side and \\"Staff\\" on the other to be made for him, despite not knowing what \\"staff\\" meant at the time but knowing that he had seen that word used in other places. Because of the store's location along an industrial street, Caine's arcade had no customers until Mullick, who needed a new door handle for his '96 Corolla, went to George's shop. While there, he saw the arcade and asked Caine about it. Mullick was particularly impressed with some of the basic business fundamentals that Caine implemented, such as offering a $2 \\"Fun Pass\\" that offered 500 plays of the games, compared to the four plays one would receive for one dollar. Mullick proceed to buy a fun pass and play the games, unaware that he was Caine's first customer, only learning this after speaking later with George, who had said that even one customer made Caine happy. Documentary After playing Caine's Arcade, Mullick returned a few weeks later to ask Caine's father George Monroy for permission to make a short film about Caine's Arcade to premiere at DIY Days at UCLA at the end of October. Caine's father approved of the idea, and shared that Mullick had been Caine's first and only customer. After learning he was Caine's first customer, Mullick decided to organize a surprise flash mob of customers for Caine as part of the film. The flashmob was set for October 2, 2011, and spread via Facebook and Reddit. On the day of the flashmob, George arranged to take Caine out for pizza in the afternoon, giving the crowd of over one-hundred time to gather and construct signs. When Caine returned, the crowd cheered \\"We Came to Play\\" - Caine was surprised and elated when he realized the crowd was there for him, saying that at first he thought he was \\"dreaming\\", but then he realized \\"it was real life- they were really playing the games.\\" Mullick worked to prepare a 14-minute rough cut of the documentary, which premiered at UCLA's DIY Days event at the end of October, 2011. Caine was in attendance, and set up his arcade. The film includes an original song 'Caine's Arcade\\" by local songwriter Juli Crockett and a song from actor Ryan Gosling's band Dead Man's Bones. Mullick released the final 11-minute documentary to the video site Vimeo and YouTube on April 9, 2012, and shared links on popular sites including Reddit and Boing Boing. The documentary soon propagated in viral video fashion, with over 1 million views the first day, and more than 5 million views within the first five days. In addition to numerous responses, several emotional video responses were received, as the film \\"made grown men cry.\\" Mullick is exploring making the short documentary into a feature film after completing other projects related the short film's success and influence; Mullick has stated that he has received offers from film publishers to create the feature-length film. Impact Following the release of the documentary, Caine was invited to speak at the USC Marshall School of Business, the youngest entrepreneur to speak there. Caine was also the youngest speaker at the Cannes Lions International Advertising Festival. The Massachusetts Institute of Technology invited Caine to participate in a summer program, while the University of California Los Angeles has offered to help design a course curriculum for Caine when he is ready to attend college. Business journals such as Forbes and Fast Company have highlighted the factors that made Caine's arcade work that can be applied to any developing business, such as Caine's perseverance and optimism. The arcade was temporarily displayed in the Exploratorium in San Francisco. Caine continued to operate the arcade on Saturdays to a steady stream of guests for 18 months after the documentary's release, eventually \\"retiring\\" from running his arcade on his 11th birthday. While open, nearby businesses and local musicians worked to create a street fair-like environment around the arcade on the days that it is open. Caine was offered a full-scholarship to attend Colorado State University after Mullick and Caine spoke in Denver at the 2013 Colorado Innovation Network Summit. Mullick established a college fund for Caine to which viewers could contribute, with an initial goal of $25,000, but this was quickly surpassed, raising over $60,000 on the first day, and exceeded $170,000 a week following. The total fund has raised over $240,000, with an ultimate goal of $250,000. With a matching grant from the Goldhirsh Foundation, Mullick started the Imagination Foundation, a non-profit with a mission to find, foster, and fund creativity and entrepreneurship in children. Mullick had not originally planned on this, though had been working in non-profit foundations before, but after three days of the video's release and the donations to Caine's college fund, he began working out the mission statement for the Imagination Foundation. Mullick launched the non-profit by making a follow up film, \\"Caine's Arcade 2\\" \\\\- which launched the Imagination Foundation and a Global Cardboard Challenge, culminating in a Day of Play (celebrating the anniversary of the surprise flashmob from Caine's Arcade); as of 2017, over 750,000 kids in 80 countries have taken part in the Global Cardboard Challenge. Mullick has become an inspirational speaker, sharing the story to educators and business leaders around the world.http://nirvan.com/speaking Mullick began receiving positive feedback from parents and teachers shortly after the release of the video, including photos and videos of cardboard arcade games created by children inspired by Caine's Arcade; one such clip included actor-musician Jack Black and his children. From this, Mullick and team worked with volunteer teachers to create an open-ended curriculum allowing students to create something that they enjoy in the same manner that Caine approached his arcade with. In September 2012, nearing the first anniversary of the surprise flash mob event, Mullick released a second video, Caine's Arcade 2, which primarily was a montage of these video clips. As a means of launching the Imagination Foundation, Mullick arranged the Global Cardboard Challenge, to encourage creativity with cardboard - 3 weeks after the follow-up film, volunteers organized over 270 Cardboard Challenge events across 41 countries, including one at Caine's Arcade in Boyle Heights. The event was popular, and became an annual event, with initial sponsorship from Mattress Firm, who learned of the story after Mullick and Caine spoke at a Mattress Firm event.https://www.thestreet.com/story/11996355/2/mattress-firm-announces- national-sponsorship-of-imagination-foundation8217s-2013-global-cardboard- challenge.html Two years after its opening, Caine 'retired' from running his arcade, partially as he was entering junior high school, but also to start a new business of a bicycle shop to help repair and remake existing bicycles. The Imagination.org and the Global Cardboard Challenge have continued to grow, adding Imagination Chapters in 2014 and an Inventors Challenge in 2016.

Made at Théâtre de l'Odéon, Paris, on Friday, April 10th, 2009 after the performance of \\"John Gabriel Borkman\\" Thomas Ostermeier (born 3 September 1968, Soltau, West Germany) is a German theatre director. He currently mainly works for the Schaubühne. Biography Ostermeier began his theatrical career in 1990 acting under director Einar Schleef, one of his major inspirations, in his Faust project at Berlin's Hochschule für Künste. After the Faust project concluded in 1991, Ostermeier began studying directing at the Ernst Busch Academy of Dramatic Arts in Berlin where in 1992 he met his mentor Manfred Karge. From 1993 to 1994 Ostermeier acted as Karge's assistant director and also acted in Weimar and at the Berliner Ensemble. In 1996 Ostermier was asked to take over as artistic director for the Barracke at the Deutsches Theater, an offer he attributes to his production of a play by the Russian symbolist Alexander Blok at Ernst Busch, which was seen by the Barracke's then chief dramaturg.ShafeCarlson Ostermeier brought dramaturg Jens Hillje and designer Stefan Schmidke, both of whom he continues to work with, to the Barracke. The three created a five-year programme aiming to mirror reality and dealing with the themes of sex, drugs, and criminality. During his time at the Barracke from 1996 to 1999, Ostermeier began developing the aesthetic he is known for today. Early in his career Ostermeier identified the major problem of German theatre as too much decoration and celebration of celebrity. He rebelled against this aesthetic, embracing the “intimate and violent” psychological realism emerging among young British playwrights like Sarah Kane and Mark Ravenhill. These British playwrights were inspired by their difficult social situations, making their plays more interesting and inspiring for Ostermeier than the work of their German counterparts.Carlson Ostermeier was responsible for bringing these new in-yer-face dramas to Germany, thus giving the playwrights international attention, and inspiring young German dramatists, such as Marius von Mayenburg, to create similar dramas.Shafe The 1998 production of Ravenhill's Shopping and Fucking won Ostermeier international attention and an invitation to the Berliner Theatertreffen as well as recognition as the enfant terrible of German theatre.schaubühne.de Ostermeier became known for his genre of Capitalist realism, which he is still known for today. This aesthetic forces his audience to watch the gritty violence of reality caused by a ruthless capitalist system. This form of realism “seeks revenge on the blindness, and stupidity of the world.Carlson” Ostermeier seeks to challenge his audience by problematizing the modern societal values of Germany and Europe. His realist aesthetic is indicative of his own left wing political beliefs, which starkly criticize Western capitalism and the values of modern European society. In 1997 Ostermeier began applying his realist aesthetic onto classic plays, the most notable being Henrik Ibsen's A Doll's House. The production marked the beginning of a longstanding collaboration between Ostermeier and designer Jan Pappelbaum. As well as marking the start of Ostermeier's revivals of pieces of classic theatre with reimagined endings, Nora met with international success. It toured around Europe and in 2004 travelled to New York. This new approach to classical pieces was applied to Hedda Gabler (2006) - winner of both the Nestroy and Politika prize at the Belgrade BITEF as well as audience award at Theatergemeinde Berlin- and numerous other plays, including 2008's production of William Shakespeare's Hamlet, gaining Ostermeier international recognition as one of German's leading young directors. Additionally, these interpretations of classics focused his aesthetic specifically on to the theme of the loss of utopia, while maintaining the intimacy and violence present in his earlier works.Carlsonschaubühne.de In 1999, at only thirty-two years old, Ostermeier left the Barracke to become a resident director and member of the artistic direction at Berlin's Schaubühne, making him one of the youngest successful directors in Germany.schaubühne.de Known for making outlandish statements about the older generation of German theatre directors, Ostermeier found himself in trouble at Wien Festwochen 2001. A comment made by Ostermeier stating directors over forty were “no longer in contact with the developing culture and should give up directing,” was taken personally by the esteemed fifty-three-year-old theatre and Festwochen director Luc Bondy. The dispute took the form of a bitter confrontation through the local media and marked Ostermeier's final invitation to the Vienna event.Carlson Now himself over forty, Ostermeier continues to make theatre and tour with productions across the globe. As a polyglot, fluent in German, French and English, Ostermeier was appointed Officier des Arts et des Lettres in 2009 by the French ministry of culture. In 2010 he became the president of the German-French Council of Culture. His 2008 production of Hamlet has won numerous international awards including Best International Production of 2011, and in 2011 Ostermeier received a Golden Lion at the Venice Biennale for his work.schaubühne.de Newsweek calls him: \\"Germany’s best-known stage director and, at least according to the leading European theater scholar Peter Boenisch, its most important\\".Newsweek, 12.04.16http://www.newsweek.com/german-theater-thomas- ostermeier-takes-far-right-527910 Despite his success Ostermeier still remains true to the gritty, in-yer-face realism he became known for during his time at the Barracke. During the pandemic, Ostermeier accepted to participate in some online events. In one of the dialogues, he was asked by theatre critic Octavian Saiu what he fears the most in this sanitary crisis. He replied that he fears his own death. He added that everyone, regardless of their age, should have the right to live, and everything should be done to protect it.

Vig served as the Vice Chairman from January 2012 until August 2012. He then served as Chairman from August 2012 to January 2020. The Shakopee Mdewakanton Sioux Community is the most influential Native American tribe in Minnesota and the single-largest benefactor for Indian Country nationally. Vig was the youngest of his family's nine children. His grandmother, Minnie Otherday, was a descendant of John Otherday, who saved many settlers and U.S. government employees during the Dakota War of 1862. Vig was raised in Eden Prairie, Minnesota. He moved to the region around Prior Lake in 1969 when his parents became some of the founders of the Shakopee Mdewakanton Sioux Community. His father died from cancer when he was nine years old. He began a career in construction, specifically masonry, once he graduated from high school. Vig married his wife, Donna Vig, a social worker, in 1981; they have five children - four sons and one daughter. Vig first worked for the Shakopee Mdewakanton Sioux Community in 1992 as a project manager for the tribe's new Mystic Lake Casino, where he oversaw just three employees at the time. He became Vice President at the casino within just three years and supervised more than 800 casino employees. He served on the Shakopee Mdewakanton Sioux's board of gambling directors for seven terms. The Shakopee Mdewakanton Sioux Community now employs 4,100 people, making the tribe the largest employer in Scott County, Minnesota. Charlie Vig was elected Vice Chairman of the Shakopee Mdewakanton Sioux Community in January 2012. He succeeded outgoing Vice Chairman Glynn Crooks, who had served in the office for the prior sixteen years. Chairman Stanley Crooks died in office of a respiratory and lung ailment on August 25, 2012. According to Shakopee Mdewakanton Sioux, the vice chairman becomes chairman in the instance of a death, so Vig became chairman. The tribe's treasurer and secretary, Keith B. Anderson, became the new Vice Chairman. Vig noted that Crooks' death was a shock, but not entirely unexpected, \\"The chairman's health had been failing for a while, and this wasn't totally unexpected...One of the reasons I stepped up is because most of the people knew the chairman might not make it to his next term. They had the confidence in me to follow through. As chairman for the remaining three years of Crooks' term, Vig continued Shakopee Mdewakanton Sioux Community's commitment to charitable donations. The SMSC has donated nearly $272 million to organizations and causes between 1992 and 2013, including more than $29 million in 2012. The tribe has donated more than $350 million to organizations and causes, and is one of the largest charitable givers in Minnesota. In 2015, the tribe launched Seeds of Native Health, a five-year, $11 million campaign that represents the single-largest coordinated philanthropic effort in American history focused on improving Native American nutrition. In 2019, the Shakopee Mdewakanton Sioux Community created Understand Native Minnesota, a three-year, $5 million strategic initiative and philanthropic campaign to improve the Native American narrative in Minnesota schools. Another marker of Chairman Vig’s time in office was his commitment to building relationships on behalf of the Shakopee Mdewakanton Sioux Community Under his tenure, the tribe constructed a jointly owned water treatment facility with the City of Prior Lake; partnered with the City of Prior Lake on the multimillion-dollar expansion of County Road 83; and contributed more than $30 million in infrastructure improvements that benefit the region. The former Chairman also worked with other Sioux tribes to preserve and protect Pe’ Sla, a sacred site in the heart of the Black Hills in South Dakota. In 2020, Chairman Vig retired from public service to spend more time with family. The Scott County board of commissioners and the Prior Lake and Shakopee city councils declared January 27 to be Chairman Charlie Vig Day in honor of his impact.

The incident was the first on the island of Great Britain in which two female police officers were killed on duty. Greater Manchester's chief constable Peter Fahy called the attack \\"cold-blooded murder\\" and British prime minister David Cameron described it as a \\"despicable act...of pure evil\\". On 12 February 2013, Cregan changed his plea to guilty in relation to the murder of the two police officers. Three months later he admitted to carrying out two separate murders in 2012, which were linked to a gangland feud in Manchester. Cregan was sentenced to a term of whole life imprisonment at Preston Crown Court on 13 June 2013. Incident Fiona Bone, 32, and Nicola Hughes, 23, were on routine patrol on 18 September 2012 when they were sent to Abbey Gardens in the village of Mottram in Longdendale in Greater Manchester, at about 11 am, following a report of a burglary. This was the result of a 999 emergency telephone call from a member of the public, which was later found to be the work of Dale Cregan, who had led the officers into a trap. After arriving at the house where the burglary had been reported the officers came under attack, with 32 gunshots being fired from a Glock pistol within 31 seconds, and one M75 hand grenade being used. One officer died at the scene while the other was badly wounded and died later in hospital. Suspect Dale Cregan was born at Tameside General Hospital on 6 June 1983 to Paul Cregan, a tool setter from Manchester, and Anita Marie Cregan. He is one of three siblings. Cregan's older brother Dean was born two years earlier and a younger sister followed, before his father left the family and eventually married a former policewoman with Greater Manchester Police (GMP). Cregan attended the now-defunct Littlemoss High School in Droylsden, Greater Manchester, where he began dealing cannabis and reportedly developed a 'bad fetish' for knives. He spent eighteen months living with his sister in Tenerife. Upon his return, Cregan began collecting firearms until he possessed around ten weapons, including machine guns. By the age of 22, Cregan had begun dealing cocaine, claiming £20,000 a week in profits but always giving his official job as a 'plasterer'. Cregan is known as 'One Eye' due to his missing left eye, which is believed to have been carved out with a knife under circumstances unknown; he has told friends it was the result of a brawl in Thailand. During his 17-week trial, Cregan had to take out his false eye as he left and returned from court to ensure officers could check he was not hiding anything in the empty socket. =Arrest of killer= Cregan was arrested by police after walking into a police station in Hyde an hour after Hughes and Bone were killed. Cregan was wanted in connection with the murders of Mark Short, 23, who was shot dead in the Cotton Tree pub in Droylsden on 25 May 2012, and of his father David Short, 46, who was killed in a gun and grenade attack at his home on Folkestone Road East in Clayton on 10 August 2012. Cregan was on bail after being arrested in June 2012 for questioning over the murder of Mark Short. Greater Manchester Police chief constable Peter Fahy defended the decision to grant bail, saying \\"It is absolutely normal in complex crime inquiries that when people are arrested there are occasions where there is insufficient evidence available for them to be charged.\\" Cregan was later charged with the murders of Hughes, Bone and the Shorts, as well as four separate counts of attempted murder. On 21 September 2012 Cregan appeared before magistrates and was remanded in custody. He appeared at Manchester crown court via video-link from Strangeways Prison, Manchester, on 24 September and he was further remanded. The case was adjourned until 5 November 2012, and on that date Cregan appeared via video-link at Liverpool Crown Court for a plea and case management hearing. Cregan pleaded not guilty to the murders of Hughes and Bone. In February 2013 it was revealed Cregan had celebrated the night before with 'beer and cigars' since he 'knew it was his last night of freedom.' He walked into a police station after the murders, saying he had 'done two coppers' because police were 'hounding my family'. While Cregan stated that his only regret was that he killed female officers,Dale Cregan 'ordered beer and cigars' before PC murders BBC News, 8 February 2013. this was deemed \\"nonsense\\" by Chief Superintendent Nick Adderley, the divisional commander, who points out that Cregan had plenty of time to see that it was petite female officers approaching the door of the house. On 12 February 2013, Cregan admitted in court that he had killed the officers. Reactions The deaths of Hughes and Bone were met with shock and condemnation in the United Kingdom and other countries. The following day, a moment of silence was held by all of Greater Manchester Police at 11 am in remembrance of Hughes and Bone, and the Union Flag at the force's headquarters was lowered to fly at half-mast. British prime minister David Cameron described the attack as \\"a shocking reminder of the debt we owe to those who put themselves in danger to keep us safe and secure\\". Chief Constable of Greater Manchester Police Peter Fahy described the officers as \\"two very brave and courageous colleagues who exemplified the very best of British policing\\". Manchester City Football Club lowered the flags outside their stadium to half- mast and sent flowers of condolence to nearby Tameside. They and the team they played against wore black armbands for one match and had a minute of silence. Manchester United Football Club players wore black armbands in their match against Galatasaray on 19 September 2012. Then manager Sir Alex Ferguson attended the funerals, and said in a statement that the club was \\"deeply saddened by the tragic loss of two young policewomen protecting our community.\\" The deaths briefly renewed the debate about whether British police officers should be armed. Funerals The funeral services of Hughes and Bone were held at Manchester Cathedral on consecutive days. The service for PC Hughes was held on Wednesday 3 October with the service broadcast to the outside crowds on a screen with an audio feed. The service for PC Bone was held on 4 October with, at the request of the deceased's family, only an audio feed available for the crowds outside the cathedral. Much of Manchester city centre came to a standstill and the services were attended by officers from around the country. A memorial to the two officers is to be placed in Mottram Parish Church. Trial and subsequent events The trial of Cregan began on 4 February 2013 at Preston Crown Court, where he stood with nine co-accused charged with murder and attempted murder. Cregan had earlier pleaded not guilty to the murders of PC Nicola Hughes and PC Fiona Bone, and the murders of Mark Short and David Short, in an appearance by video link at Liverpool Crown Court. Cregan changed his plea to guilty for the murders of the two police officers on 12 February 2013, and pleaded guilty on 22 May 2013 to the murders of father and son David and Mark Short. The killings of David and Mark Short were the culmination of a decade-long feud between two criminal families in Manchester, the Shorts and the Atkinsons, with whom Cregan was friendly. The deaths of Fiona Bone, Nicola Hughes and David Short were the first times that hand grenades had been used as a murder weapon in Britain. On 13 June 2013, Cregan was cleared of the attempted murder of Sharon Hark. On the same day, he was sentenced to life imprisonment for the four murders with a whole life order. In August 2013 it was reported that Cregan was on hunger strike at HM Prison Full Sutton. He was moved to Ashworth Hospital in September 2013. He was transferred back to Manchester in March 2018 from Ashworth, where it was reported he had boasted about his workout regime and access to snooker and tennis.

As part of the AAU, the MAC formed basketball, swimming, track, baseball, and other teams, which competed throughout the United States. The MAC was housed in nine different buildings before establishing its present clubhouse in 1917. In that year the club constructed the 12-story (13?) building, designed by Armand Koch with its exterior in Neoclassical style, resembling a column with the bottom three stories (the column's base) sheathed in stone veneer, the middle stories plain brick, and the top two in stone veneer - the column's capital.

During the second world war, an American crew of B-Movies took refuge in Lisbon. In 1943, producer Valerie Lewton married with a Portuguese actor that translated to her Branquinho da Fonseca's short story \\"The Baron\\". The dictator heard about the movie and ordered that the film was destroyed. The crew was repatriated. The Portuguese actors were deported to Tarrafal's Concentration camp. They died tortured in the \\"skillet\\", a cubicle where humans were roasted. In 2005, 2 reels and the screenplay were found in the archives of Barreiro's kino-club. For the next 5 years the film was restored and reshot. In 2011, was shown for the first time.

One could say that it is modern precisely in its anti-modernity. It is almost impossible to describe this film without relying on comparisons: The Baron looks and feels like a weird re-enactment of a 1930s horror film through the arty lens of a very talented modern director – something along the lines of Almereyda's \\"Nadja\\", Merhige's \\"Begotten\\" and Maddin's \\"Dracula: Pages from a Virgin's Diary\\". There are also droning soundscapes and grotesquely nightmarish non- sequitur situations in which humor and horror are disquietingly close reminiscent of David Lynch. (...)\\" Eurico de Barros: *“Signed by the most persistently individualistic portuguese filmmaker, The Baron is the metamorphosis of a literary work from the 1940s into a oniric phantasmagoria, surreal and cinephile to the core. “ Jorge Mourinha in The FLICKERING WALL: *\\"For cult Portuguese veteran Edgar Pêra, this adaptation of writer Branquinho da Fonseca's 1942 novella about a big city bureaucrat caught in the seductive wave of a decadent country aristocrat was a long-gestating project, following on his 2007 little-seen filming of the writer's sole novel, Rio Turvo. On paper, O Barão seems to have little to do with mr. Pêra's surreal cyber-DIY aesthetics, until one realises that he uses it as an unexpectedly accessible synthesis, both stylistic and thematic, of his 30-year directorial career on the fringes of mainstream film-making. His explorations of Portuguese history and character are visible in the parable of the Baron as a metaphor for an old, parochial country, corrupt, debauched, hypocritical; his fascination with genre cinema, B-movies and trash eccentricity comes through in Luís Branquinho's dazzling high-contrast black-and-white cinematography and the director's decision to film the story as a throwback to 1930s Universal and 1950s cheap B-series horror movies as helmed by an epileptic Guy Maddin, with mr. Pêra's regular accomplice Nuno Melo channeling Bela Lugosi and Klaus Kinski in his portrayal of the Baron. The result is the director's most accessible fiction yet, playfully described on the press notes as a \\"2D movie\\", although it never fully abandons mr. Pêra's playful, often impenetrable way with narrative and insistence on highly baroque visuals (the creativity of the English subtitling is wondrous and yet over the top). Yet O Barão is also an unapologetically romantic tale of love and regret (as indeed most classic horror movies) and the director's most sincere work yet.\\" Bruno Ramos e Rui Brazuna: *“The imaginary of Branquinho da Fonseca is transmuted in a way never seen before.” Gerwin Tamsma, Roterdam Film Festival programmer: *'They don't make them like this any more' is the initial, paradoxical thought that crops up whilst watching the magnificent The Baron. Perhaps Edgar Pera's most ambitious film so far comes across like an apparition from the last century, and makes no bones about it. Whether this is true or not, The Baron announces itself as an attempt to remake a film destroyed by Portuguese dictator Salazar's political police before it could be finished. This point of departure is vaguely reminiscent of A Short Film About the Indo Nacional and Indepencia by Raya Martin from the Philippines, who tries to use his films to give his country a film history it doesn't have. Or perhaps even wishes to add an essential, missing element to prevent history from being perverted forever by the cruel consequences of dictatorship, poverty and censorship.'

He is believed to have been the earliest leader and founder of the Akwamu kingdom, which he led from around 1480 to around 1500, possibly later. While serving as the Akwamu Chief, Agyen Kokobo ruled the state with his mother as the queen mother. Even today, rulers of the Akwamu kingdom still claim to be descendants of Agyen Kokobo; in the 1960s, one man claimed to be his 28th descendant. Biography Agyen Kokobo was a direct descendant of the last king of Kumbu. He was also the nephew of Ofori Besie and Kuruko Booman. The princess Ampranso Akomaso from Dwenemu was brought to Agyen Kokobo to start the royal line. He belonged to the matriarchal clan known as \\"the Abrade\\". Within this clan, the authority of the chief's mother was more dominant than that of the male chief himself, as they believed in the proverb, \\"Homes are made by the wisdom of women\\". This clan was the \\"Paramount Stool (throne) of the Akwamu State\\". He is known for bringing a group of traders from the forests near the Portuguese fort of Elmina Castle to Kumkunso (now Twifo-Heman), around 1500, where a city was then established. The prosperity of the new establishment is attributed to gold trading, which was further accentuated by early European arrival on the coast. Agyen Kokobo ruled with his mother, the queen mother of the Akamawu state; the major contribution which the Akwamu brought to the Akan was military organization. He was succeeded by Ofusu Kwabi, who was known for the killing of Ahweaben, the Nzima chief, while in battle in 1515. Still later in the century, under Adow, the clan moved slowly across the inland part of the country, because of conflicts with their Akan neighbours.

AATC also operates a temporary A-10A Thunderbolt II OT detachment at Davis–Monthan AFB, with the support of the 917th Wing, Barksdale AFB, Louisiana and the host 355th Wing at Davis–Monthan. The unit also is tasked and accomplishes testing on a wide variety of other Air Reserve Command aircraft, including F-16 Block 40/42, B-52, F-15A/B, HH-60, HC-130 and electronic combat systems for those aircraft. AATC has also conducted testing in support of Air Mobility Command on C-130, C-5, KC-10 and KC-135 aircraft. AATC is uniquely postured to take advantage of modernization efforts that are funded by the National Guard and Reserve Equipment Account (NGREA) which is unprogrammed funding suited to near-term improvements. AATC efforts exploiting NGREA resources complement long-range AF programs and have enabled transformational modernization efforts such as Night Vision Devices for fighter aircraft (first fielded in the ARC), Situational Awareness Data Link (SADL), a low-cost datalink complementing AF network enabled operations, and Litening Targeting Pods, which greatly increased the number of precision strike aircraft in the AF inventory and revolutionized how the AF delivers joint fires and conducts non-traditional intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance.

The story tells of Cassidy's struggle and subsequent triumph over alcohol. Cassidy lost a fight to Jorge Ahumada on the undercard of the second Muhammad Ali-Joe Frazier fight at Madison Square Garden. The Irish light heavyweight spent more time drinking than training for that fight, the biggest of his career. Cassidy turned the biggest loss of his career into a victory by quitting the bottle. He has not had a drink since April 1974. That night at the Garden is the basis for the play. The play was written by Cassidy's older son, Bobby Cassidy Jr. There have been four productions of Kid Shamrock since 2007. Description The calling card of the play is its authenticity. Numerous professional boxers have been cast throughout the production. Seamus McDonagh, who fought Evander Holyfield in 1990, has held the title role since the play's debut in 2007. Other professional boxers who have appeared in the play include, John Duddy, Mark McPherson, Tommy Rainone, Olympic gold medalist and WBA welterweight champion Mark Breland, WBO junior welterweight champion Christopher Algieri and five- time world champion Junior Jones. Cassidy Sr. serves as the play's narrator. The referee for the play's boxing scenes have always been real referees. Wayne Kelly, who officiated more than 50 world title fights, held the role of referee until his passing in 2012. Ian McGrady understudied Wayne Kelly at the Atlantic Theater II production, and carried the dual roles of \\"Referee\\" and \\"Bartender\\" to the TADA Theater production. Arthur Mercante Jr., himself a ref in dozens of title fights, took over the role in August 2012. Michael Bentt, the former WBO heavyweight champion, has been the play's director for the last two productions. Bentt starred as Sonny Liston opposite Will Smith in the 2001 film, \\"Ali.\\" The last two runs of Kid Shamrock have been executive produced by David Schuster. In August 2012, Schuster and boxing promoter Bob Duffy teamed to produce, \\"Shamrock in the Park,\\" an outdoor presentation of the play that was followed by a nine-bout professional boxing card. Professional boxer Richie Neves acted in the play and later that evening won a six-round decision on the boxing card.

There are picnic tables and restrooms, but alcohol is not allowed in the park. The origins of the park date back to Spanish missionaries, who worked with mission Indians to create a water system sourced by the San Antonio River. The San Antonio Conservation Society (SACS) purchased much of this acreage in 1957 to preserve the area's environment. Because the San Antonio River Authority planned to reconfigure the river channel, SACS joined local land owners in filing a successful water rights and water flow lawsuit against the Authority. In 1975, SACS deeded the property to the City of San Antonio with the stipulation that it be used as a public park.

He released a solo album in 2001 and is releasing a second album in late February 2017. He worked with several other bands and artists, including Chris Caffery and BLAZE. Biography Nick was born in Camden, New Jersey, the son of a US Navy Father, and studied architecture before pursuing a career in music. He grew up listening to his Mother's collection of soul, Motown and 60s and 70s British rock records. He began playing bass at age 13 to differentiate from his brother and others in his neighborhood who had opted for the guitar. He took bass guitar lessons in his youth. At the age of 19, he became a member of the heavy metal band Deadly Blessing from Turnersville, New Jersey, with which he wrote and recorded songs for their first album, titled Ascend from the Cauldron, published by New Renaissance Records in 1988. Two years later, he decided to leave the band and moved to New York City, where he changed his stage name to Nick Douglas and had brief experiences with a few New York area bands. In the summer of 1990, Douglas auditioned for the German hard rock singer Doro Pesch and was chosen among many candidates. Doro is the former singer of the German heavy metal band Warlock, which dissolved in 1989, and went on to become a successful solo artist. Douglas is the bassist of Doro's band since then and recorded several albums with her, and has toured Europe and all over the world. Nick Douglas has also worked with other bands and musicians. He was in the line-up of Blaze Bayley's band BLAZE for the tours of 2004 and 2005, along with other members of Doro's band Oliver Palotai and Luca Princiotta. In 2005, he was the bass player for Chris Caffery, on his Faces tour and at the end of 2005, he reunited his first band Deadly Blessing, which had been inactive for a long time, for some live performances and the release of an album containing rare and previously unreleased material. At the end of the 1990s, Douglas began writing and recording songs that eventually made the album, Through the Pane. The album was released independently in 2001 and released in Europe at the end of 2006 on Painkiller Records. Douglas played bass on a track on Chris Caffery third solo album Pins and Needles in 2007 and went on tour with both Caffery and Doro. He also started to record a new solo album, to which he devoted himself to during the short breaks between tours. He also played with New York and Pennsylvania based acts like Mike Rocket and the Stars, EBE and the cover band American Tabloid, featuring also the drummer of Doro's band Johnny Dee. He is also the bassist and lead singer of the Nick Douglas band, which features current and former members of Doro's touring band, and performs his own music. Douglas composes and records music in his home studio and licensed some of his compositions to movie and TV companies. Nick’s second solo album, Regenerations, was released February and March 2017 in Europe and The US respectively on the German label, Metalville. It went to #4 on the Metal Contraband “most added to radio” charts in North America. Equipment Douglas endorses Warwick basses and amplifiers and usually uses a Katana model on stage and in the studio. He also uses DR Strings and InTune Picks.

Proposed by Virginia Lieutenant Governor Sir William Gooch, the law was far-reaching in impact in part because it gave warehouses the power to destroy substandard crops and issue bills of exchange that served as currency Richmond during the Colonial Period. The law centralized the inspection of tobacco at 40 locations described in the law. The 1730 warehouse law built on prior laws. The warehouse act of 1712 provided for the regulation of public warehouses. This warehouse act was amended in 1720 giving the county courts the authority to order warehouses inconvenient to the landings discontinued.  Public warehouses  The book Tobacco in Colonial Virginia (\\"The Sovereign Remedy\\") by Melvin Herndon describes operation of the public warehouses as follows: > In 1730 the most comprehensive inspection bill ever introduced, passed the > General Assembly. The common knowledge that the past and present inspection > laws had failed to prevent the importation of unmarketable tobacco, plus a > long depression, had changed the attitude of many of the influential > planters and merchants. Nevertheless, the act did meet with opposition from > some of the English customs officials and a few of the large planters. Soon > after the passage of this new inspection law a prominent planter wrote > complainingly to a London merchant, \\"This Tobo hath passed the Inspection of > our new law, every hogshead was cased and viewed by which means the tobacco > was very much tumbled and made something less sightly than it was before and > it causes a great deal of extraordinary trouble\\". There were complaints that > the new law destroyed tobacco that used to bring good money. Still another > planter complained that the planter's name and evidence on the hogshead had > much more effect on the price of the tobacco than the inspector's brand. > While some of the planters expressed their disapproval of the new inspection > law verbally, others resorted to violence. During the first year some > villains burned two inspection houses, one in Lancaster County and another > in Northumberland. The inspection law passed in 1730 was frequently amended > during the colonial period, but there were no changes in its essential > features. The act provided that no tobacco was to be shipped except in > hogsheads, cases, or casks, without having first passed an inspection at one > of the legally established inspection warehouses; thus the shipment of bulk > tobacco was prohibited. Two inspectors were employed at each warehouse, and > a third was summoned in case of a dispute between the two regular > inspectors. These officials were bonded and were forbidden under heavy > penalties to pass bad tobacco, engage in the tobacco trade, or to take > rewards. Tobacco offered in payment of debts, public or private, had to be > inspected under the same conditions as that to be exported. The inspectors > were required to open the hogshead, extract and carefully examine two > samplings; all trash and unsound tobacco was to be burned in the warehouse > kiln in the presence and with the consent of the owner. If the owner refused > consent the entire hogshead was to be destroyed. After the tobacco was > sorted, the good tobacco was repacked in the hogshead and the planter's > distinguishing mark, net weight, tare (weight of the hogshead), and name of > inspection warehouse were stamped on the hogshead. Inspection locations The law dictated that public warehouses should be set up at the following locations: > XLIII.

Plot summary  Rapp is introduced while he is performing a covert operation in Iran and he discovers a possible terrorist attack planned for the nation's capital to happen in the near future. Meanwhile, in Washington, D.C., Anna Reilly is starting her first day as a White House correspondent for NBC. It also happens to be the day where the terrorist, using a secret entrance, takes over the White House and holds it hostage. The president, who barely escaped the hostage situation, remains trapped in the unfinished bomb shelter. With the vice president using this opportunity as commander in chief to glorify his political career by being lenient towards the terrorist demands, Rapp must find a way to fight the terrorists from the inside of the White House. It is here where he saves Anna Reilly from being raped by one of the terrorists and their relationship, which will be seen throughout the later books, begins. Several Navy SEALs sneak into the White House, eliminate the terrorists, and save the hostages and the president. The leader of the terrorist group manages to escape the White House while detonating his strategically placed explosives. He is later found in South America only to be killed by Rapp. Critical reaction The Houston Chronicle said \\"Flynn keeps the action moving\\".

In 1943, an important Kurdish party was established in Iran – the Committee of Kurdish Youth (Komala-i-Zhian-i-Kurd) – and in 1945 the movement transformed into the Kurdish Democratic Party of Iran (KDPI).University of Arkansas. Political Science department. Iran/Kurds (1943-present). Retrieved 09 September 2012. Both parties challenged the central Iranian government after World War II.The separatist conflict escalated in 1945, fuelled by Soviet Union support to the Kurds, and eventually leading to the Iran crisis of 1946, which included an attempt of KDPI to establish the independent Republic of Mahabad in Iranian Kurdistan.The Kurdish Warrior Tradition and the Importance of the Peshmerga. p.27-28. The attempt failed, with the military victory of the Iranian forces and the Republic was abolished, with its leaders executed. Some 1,000 died during the crisis. In the aftermath of Mahabad’s collapse, the KDP‐I \\"effectively ceased to exist\\", with an exception of a handful of exiles in Iraq.McDowall. The modern history of the Kurds. Third Edition 2007. p. 252–253. The party’s urban supporters essentially disappeared into obscurity and, for the next 15 years, there was virtually no Kurdish political activity. The absence of a local Kurdish armed force in Iran, and of a large urban population ready to be mobilized against the central government, left Iranian Kurds waiting for an external shock to provide an opportunity, much as the Second World War had. Revival of KDPI and Kurdish battle of 1967 The shock for the Iranian Kurdish national movement came with the eruption of the First Iraqi–Kurdish War in neighboring Iraq in 1961. When the 1958–1961 rapprochement in Iraq collapsed, the KDP‐Iran supported Iraqi Kurds; in the process, the leadership and subsequent social orientation of both Iran's and Iraq's Kurdish Democratic Parties turned conservative. Facing a newly consolidated Iraqi government by 1965, Mulla Mustafa turned against his former military allies and KDP‐I supporters and came to an agreement with the Shah, that called for him to \\"restrain\\" KDP‐I activities against the Iranian government. Mullah Mustafa went further, \\"subordinating the struggle in Iran to that in Iraq\\" and \\"warning that KDP‐Iran militants would not be tolerated in Iraqi Kurdistan\\". The result of this was that the conservative leadership of the KDP‐Iran was ousted and new, mostly former Iranian Tudeh (Communist) Party leaders took over the party's leadership. They formed a Revolutionary Committee and declared their support for sporadic peasant uprisings against the National Police around Mahabad and Urumiya. Lacking a significant social base, this new leadership was quickly crushed: even though the KDPI's forces managed to inflict serious losses on the Iranian army, they failed due to lack of logistical support. Within months, eight of the eleven members of the Revolutionary Committee had been murdered by Iranian soldiers, and the movement lasted less than eighteen months. Over 40 KDPI party members were killed and their bodies handed over by Mullah Mustafa's men to the Iranian authorities. Aftermath The surviving KDPI elements re-consolidated following the defeat, with bitterness against the betrayal of Mullah Mustafa. From March 1970, a new \\"Provisional Central Committee\\" began to prepare a new part program, approved at the third KDPI party conference in Baghdad in June 1971. During the third conference a new party secretary-general was elected – Abd al-Rahman Qasimlu. Under his guidance, the Third Congress in 1973 adopted the slogan \\"Democracy for Iran, autonomy for Kurdistan\\", committing for the armed struggle. Over the next years, KDPI found itself in-line with other opponents of the government, cooperating with some of the Marxist as well as Islamic parties. The game changed with the Islamic Revolution of 1979, which failed to provide the Kurdish demands for autonomy, but on the contrary faced those with an even harsher bitterness than the previous monarch regime. The conflict between the new Iranian government and the KDPI and its allies gradually escalated, until reaching a point of no-return in March 1979. The outbreaking rebellion was led by the KDPI and its allies in Iranian Kurdistan, becoming the most violent uprising against the new Iranian government, following the Islamic Revolution of February 1979. The Kurdish rebellion was defeated in December 1982, with 10,000 killed and 200,000 displaced. Though defeated, the KDPI turned to open fighting once again between 1989 and 1996, as an insurrection by the KDPI took place in Iranian Kurdistan, due to the assassination of its exiled leader Ghassemlou in July 1989 by Iranian negotiators. The KDPI insurrection ended in 1996, when the KDPI announced a unilateral cease fire, having been subdued by targeted assassinations of its leaders and a crackdown on its supporters in Iran. Since the Iranian elections on 1997, a more moderate government eased the crackdown on KDPI as well. KDPI has retained a low level political activity in exile through the late 1990s and early 2000s, signing a cooperation agreement with Komala in 2012.

It is the second book in his untitled animal trilogy, following The Dangerous World of Butterflies in 2009 and preceding No Animals Were Harmed in 2011. The book explores the lives of those that either own exotic animals or have been captured for illegally smuggling them, with a strong focus on Travis, the chimpanzee who attacked Charla Nash in 2009.  Overview  Peter Laufer asks himself what animals are being smuggled and why they are being smuggled. He attempts to find a connection to the underworld of international animal smuggling and talks to the hunters, traders, breeders, and customers who contribute to the world of animal smuggling. In addition, he talks to those that have legally obtained permits to own exotic animals, such as a young Bengal tiger, and talks to those that work with animals about why Travis the chimpanzee would attack humans in the first place.
