Although they shared the same surname, the Oyamas were not related, but in fact young Mas Oyama changed his Korean birth name, Choi Young-Eui, because the Oyama family let him stay with them from time to time. Mas Oyama and Karate Training S. Oyama started practicing karate at the age of twelve under Mas Oyama at his dojo that was referred to as Oyama Dojo and his contact style Oyama Karate. He received his black belt when he was seventeen. A typical karate class 'was usually four hours long with the last two hours being fighting.' He was one of the senior Kyokushin karateka who sparred with Mas Oyama in his younger days, and he saw the latter's first bout with a bull in Japan. S. Oyama would go on to consummate the 100-man kumite on Sept. 17, 1966. He reminisced: ‚ÄòOne-hundred kumite is the hardest thing I ever did in my life. It is probably the hardest thing anyone can do in the karate world. You don‚Äôt beat the 65th man with your body. That‚Äôs all gone by then.

Move to America Richard Bernard, a representative for Kyokushin in New York, requested a Japanese instructor, and Mas Oyama chose S. Oyama. Over the years, S. Oyama greatly contributed to establishing Kyokushin as one of the preeminent karate styles practiced across the globe. Many tournament champions of Kyokushin, including world champions such as Makoto Nakamura (World Full Contact Karate Open Championship winner in 1979 and 1983) and Shokei Matsui (winner in 1987) were sent to S.

The duke promised to build an Orthodox church in Jelgava (then known as Mitau), his capital, but his premature death prevented this. Anna was sent to Jelgava in 1712 and ruled there with the advice of Pyotr Bestuzhev-Ryumin, who directed a wooden church be constructed in 1726. In 1774, a stone church designed by Francesco Bartolomeo Rastrelli replaced this building. The Cathedral was built between 1890‚Äì1892, with the financial support of Tsar Alexander III of Russia, on designs made by architect Nikolai Chagin, of Vilnius. The cathedral was destroyed in August 1944 amidst World War II, and remained in ruins during the Soviet period.

The theater ran promotions wherein patrons could collect dinnerware, one piece at a time, on a weekly basis. Management changed in the mid-1960s, when the Lyric Photoplay Film Society, under Edward Millington Stout III, took over. In 1966 the Society installed a Wurlitzer theater organ of 3 manuals and 16 ranks, which had originally been the organ at the State Lake Theater in Chicago. The first show utilizing the \\"new\\" organ took place on October 7, 1966, screening The Lost World and featuring Tom Hazelton on the console. The theater then began showing an eclectic assortment of films, including foreign films, re-runs of three- dimensional films and silent films (for which the organ was utilized). Lyn Larsen was staff organist for the next two years, 1967 through 1968. Bob Vaughn began as organist in 1968, and remained the organist at the Avenue until it closed.

Background  In the year A.D. 363 the Roman Emperor Julian, hoping to avenge Roman defeats under his predecessor Constantius II and to establish his fame by accomplishing what had never been done by a Roman before - the subjection of the east - invaded the dominions of Shapur II, king of Persia.Edward Gibbon, The Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire, (The Modern Library,1932), ch. XXIV., pp. 798, 799. Assembling his strength at Carrhae in the Roman province of Mesopotamia, Julian divided his forces. While a part of the army (30,000 men, according to Ammianus Marcellinus) was dispatched north- east under his cousin Procopius and Count Sebastian to enlist the aid of Arshak II of Armenia for a march down the Tigris to Ctesiphon; Julian himself, with a larger force (65,000), penetrated Assyria to the south, proceeding along the Euphrates from Callinicum with the same ultimate destination. He crossed the frontier at Circesium, where it had been established by the peace of Diocletian, leaving a numerous detachment to secure his rear (10,000).Gibbon, pp. 806-8 Caught off guard by the force and direction of Julian's invasion, Shapur had failed to assemble forces in time for the defence of Assyria, and the former, in his course through the province, experienced a purely nominal resistance. Cavalry harried his wings, and the dykes and canals were released by the enemy to flood the country. However, these obstacles were surmounted; Anah capitulated; Macepracta was subdued; Pirisabora was reduced and sacked, and Julian promptly arrived under the walls of Maiozamalcha, a strongly fortified place 11 miles from the Persian capital of Ctesiphon.Gibbon, pp. 821, and 810-13 The siege The formidable defenses and strong garrison of the fortress of Maiozamalcha, determined Julian to effect its capture. A train of catapults and siege engines had attended the emperor's march through Assyria, and Julian employed them in vain against the impregnable fortifications; the frontal assault turned out to be a distraction from his real device. While the assault on the walls was repelled by a vigorous Persian defense, a mine was surreptitiously built under the very feet of defenders thanks to Julian's engineers, by means of which three cohorts, or 1,500 of the elite of the Roman soldiers, crept into the heart of the city. The city was instantly captured from the inside out with no mercy shown towards the astonished defenders or populace, who before its fall had - in insolent assurance - insulted Julian's arms and ally, the renegade prince of the Persian royal house, Hormisdas (or Hormizd).Gibbon, pp. 813, 814. Aftermath Obsidional crowns were conferred on the bravest of the troops, in accordance with ancient practice.Gibbon, p. 816 The adjacent palaces and gardens of the Persian monarchy were despoiled and burnt;Gibbon, p. 814 and the capital, Ctesiphon, was exposed to Julian's hostile intents. Ultimately, the siege of that city was unsuccessful, though Julian crossed the Tigris and defeated the Persians in the field before retiring from before the adamant walls of the capital of the Sassanids. The lateness of the season, the revived forces of Shapur, and the treacherous advice of a captive Persian, by which the baggage and the river fleet were burnt, contributed to render Julian's position untenable, the northern army having failed to join him due to Tiran's resentment,Gibbon, p. 820 and the expedition ended in disaster after Julian's death on the battlefield.

The rule is sometimes referred to as the Faith Cap on admissions. However, as the open places are just as accessible to faith applicants as non-faith applicants, in practice the rule does not explicitly prevent such schools from having more than 50% of students with a faith affiliation. The 50% Rule applies only to new academies, established under the Free School programme, not to maintained schools that have converted to academy status.  Rationale  David Laws, Schools Minister at the time the 50% Rule was introduced, described the motivation behind it in a Parliamentary debate. He said: \\"Where the Government fund new Church or faith school provision, it is right that such new schools cater for local demand in the faith, but the needs of children in the broader local community must not be overlooked. We want all local children to have the same opportunity to access high-quality state-funded education. The fact that it is state funded is the point.\\" He went on to talk about the principle of parental choice, saying there are \\"two competing rights in a state-funded school system: people‚Äôs right to choose to have their children educated in the way that they wish, and the right of [other] taxpayers who live near state-funded schools to have some ability to access them despite the over-representation of people from the faith that the system allows.\\"  History  The 50% Rule was introduced by the 2010 Coalition Government formed from the Conservative Party and the Liberal Democrats. In the run up to the 2010 general election, the Liberal Democrat manifesto had stated that \\"We will ensure that all faith schools develop an inclusive admissions policy.\\" This aim was reflected in the Coalition Agreement as follows: \\"We will ensure that all new Academies follow an inclusive admissions policy. We will work with faith groups to enable more faith schools and facilitate inclusive admissions policies in as many of these schools as possible.\\" The 50% Rule was first applied following the Academies Act 2010, via a condition to the Funding Agreements for all new faith academies established under the Free School programme. It was later documented within the 2014 Schools Admissions Code. The Education Secretary, Michael Gove, suggested that the rule should also be \\"voluntarily\\" applied to other types of new faith school. The Catholic Education Service lobbied for removal of the 50% Rule, saying that they would not open any Free schools while it was in place. In April 2014, the issue was aired in the House of Commons in a debate led by Damian Hinds MP. The Coalition Government was replaced by a Conservative Government in the 2015 general election. The Schools Minister with responsibility for Free Schools, Lord Nash, told campaigners that there were no plans to review the 50% Rule. However, the following year, Nick Timothy, the newly appointed director of the New Schools Network, responsible for encouraging and supporting the establishment of Free Schools, spoke out in favour of ending it. When Theresa May became Prime Minister in 2016, Nick Timothy became her Joint Chief of Staff, and was credited as responsible when later the same year a national consultation by the Department for Education asked for people's views on removing the 50% Rule, to enable new faith academies to select up to 100% of pupils based on their faith. The move was opposed by individuals and groups campaigning for inclusive admissions, including the Accord Coalition, Humanists UK and the National Secular Society as well as other commentators. The results of the consultation were seen as a foregone conclusion by the Catholic Education Service, which wrote in its 2016 annual report: \\"After a CES coordinated campaign which put pressure on Government officials, parliamentarians and Downing Street special advisers, the Prime Minister announced the removal of the 50% cap on faith-based admission for new Free Schools. This announcement means that Catholic dioceses will be able to open new Catholic schools for the first time in six years.\\" However, in April 2017, before the results of the consultation were published, Theresa May called a snap General Election, with Nick Timothy as a senior advisor for her campaign. Their Conservative manifesto included a pledge to \\"replace the unfair and ineffective inclusivity rules that prevent the establishment of new Roman Catholic schools.\\" When the election resulted in a hung parliament, Nick Timothy resigned, and the future of many of the manifesto policies was thrown into doubt. This resulted in speculation as to whether the 50% Rule would be repealed or not, and associated lobbying and campaigning on both sides of the debate. Nevertheless, eight months after the consultation report was expected to be published, the Government said it was \\"still considering how best to progress the policy proposals ... in light of the responses to the consultation.\\" In January 2018, a Cabinet reshuffle resulted in the incumbent Education Secretary, Justine Greening, being replaced by Damian Hinds, whose record of supporting the Catholic Education Service's position on the 50% Rule fuelled speculation that he planned to implement the Government's manifesto pledge to remove it. The following month, he confirmed that was his intention. However, in May 2018 it was announced that the 50% cap would remain in place. Instead the Government said it would provide financial support for local authorities that want to work with faith groups to create new voluntary aided schools.  Application and Interpretation  Catholic Free Schools The Catholic Education Service refused to support the establishment of new faith academies under the 50% Rule because they interpreted it as forcing schools \\"to turn pupils away because they were Catholics while admitting others because they were not\\". They said that this would be against Canon Law, although campaigners for inclusive admissions argued that their claim was \\"disingenuous and politically motivated\\". The chairperson of the CES has said: ‚ÄúThe Church of England runs schools for the wider community ..... Ours are different. They are for the Catholic community.‚Äù One Catholic Free School was established, St Michael's in Camborne, as a conversion from the private sector. It originally received \\"one off\\" approval from church officials, but this was later withdrawn and, after it failed to thrive, the school was eventually absorbed into a community academy. While it was operating as a Catholic free school it was found to misinterpret the 50% Rule, because its oversubscription criteria prioritised 50% of places for \\"non-Catholics\\" rather than allocating them \\"without reference to faith\\". This was judged to be a breach of the Admissions Code, a judgement which confirmed that places allocated \\"without reference to faith\\" should be just as accessible to Catholics (or other faith groups) as to those without a faith affiliation. Another Free School, Trinity Academy in Brixton, opened without a formal Catholic designation (for which it would have needed the support of the church authorities), but with a Catholic ethos, and oversubscription criteria that allocated 100% of places without reference to faith. The school's founder has spoken out against the Catholic Education Service's position on the 50% rule, describing it as \\"stubborn\\" and a missed opportunity for evangelism. When St Richard Reynolds Catholic High School and Primary School were established in the London Borough of Richmond Upon Thames in 2013, campaign groups accused the local authority of helping the Catholic church to avoid the 50% Rule, by providing financial and political support for them to be set up as Voluntary Aided schools rather than Free Schools, and setting a legal precedent for interpretation of 2011 Education Act. The Education Secretary suggested that the school should \\"voluntarily\\" adhere to the 50% rule. In the end, the diocesan authorities did provide 10 open places in the primary school, however, like St. Michaels in Camborne, they were also required by the Schools' Adjudicator to modify the wording of their policy to ensure that Catholic children could access the open places. Church of England Free Schools The Church of England (CE) is establishing large numbers of new schools under the Free School programme. The Archbishop of Canterbury, Justin Welby, has said that the Church of England is moving away from selecting pupils based on religion. Responding to the proposal to remove the 50% Rule, their Chief Education Officer stated that ‚ÄúOur schools are not faith schools for the faithful, they are church schools for the community.‚Äù However, campaign groups have said that the admissions authorities for CE schools frequently do not follow this advice. Some Church of England free schools go beyond what is required by the 50% Rule and have oversubscription criteria which allocate 100% of places without reference to faith, in line with many of their established Voluntary Controlled schools. One school's interpretation of the 50% Rule was judged to be unreasonable, because it designated Church of England primary schools, which themselves had faith-based admissions criteria, as feeder schools for the 50% of places that were being allocated without reference to faith. Following the Government's consultation on removal of the 50% Rule, one proposed CE Free School apparently published plans for oversubscription criteria that selected only 25% of places without reference to faith, prompting criticism that people were \\"jumping the gun\\" in assuming the change would go ahead. However, the school later said the policy description on their website had been incorrect. Other Faith Free Schools The Free School programme has resulted in the establishment of many new schools with several faith designations, including other Christian denominations, Jewish, Hindu, Sikh and Muslim, all of which are subject to the 50% Rule. Some senior members of the Jewish community have publicly supported the removal of the 50% Rule.  Impact  The Government's 2016 consultation document \\"Schools that Work for Everyone\\", which was proposing removal of the 50% Rule, said that \\"in open free schools designated for minority faiths in the English school system (Islam, Judaism, Sikhism and Hinduism) the intake has been predominantly of pupils from similar ethnic backgrounds\\". They contrasted this with Voluntary Aided Catholic schools which they said have higher levels of diversity on average, despite not being subject to the 50% Rule. The same document said \\"‚ÄúOther Christian‚Äù free schools have nearly a fifth of pupils of Asian origin and nearly a tenth from black ethnic families, with just 55% of White ethnic origin\\". In response to the consultation, a campaign group in favour of retaining the 50% Rule published analysis indicating that schools subject to the rule are more ethnically diverse than those that aren't, concluding that \\"if the 50% cap was rolled out across all state-funded secondary schools then .. whilst there would be little difference for the minority faith schools, tens or even hundreds of thousands of non- white pupils would gain access to Christian schools when they haven‚Äôt had access before.\\" References Education policy in the United Kingdom Education in England History of education in England ","title":"The 50% Rule"},{"id":"55076674","text":"Radiant House is an architecturally notable building in Mortimer Street, in the City of Westminster, London.

She was the only daughter of Peter II of Courtenay and of Agnes of Nevers, born from the Capetian House of Courtenay, she was married to Herv√© IV of Donzy and then to Guigues IV of Forez. Life Arms of the Capetian House of Courtenay By his marriage to Agnes of Nevers, Peter II of Courtenay, a cousin of King Philip II Augustus, became Count of Nevers, Auxerre and Tonnerre in 1184. Four years later, the couple became the parents of a daughter, Matilda. In 1198, Matilda's father was caught up in a dispute with Herv√© IV of Donzy which concerned the possession of the ch√¢teau de Gien. Herv√© succeeded in defeating his opponent at Cosne-sur-Loire and captured him. Through the mediation of Philip II Augustus, the parties came to an agreement in 1199. To recover his freedom, Peter had to give his daughter Matilda in marriage to Herv√© de Donzy and cede him the county of Nevers. The marriage was closed in October 1199, probably on the 20th. It was agreed that the counties of Auxerre and Tonnerre would become the property of Herv√© at the death of Peter II. In 1209, Herv√© and Matilda founded the monastery of Bellary and the Abbey of Notre-Dame de l'√âpeau in 1211, a year before obtaining Pope Innocent III's consent to the marriage held in 1205 and was only granted in 1212. They richly endowed their religious establishments. Rule In 1216, at his son's home in Druyes, Peter II received a delegation of barons who had come to offer him the crown of the Latin Empire of Constantinople.Chisholm, Hugh, ed. (1911). \\"Peter of Courtenay\\". Encyclop√¶dia Britannica. 21 (11th ed.). Cambridge University Press. pp. 293‚Äì294. He accepted and was consecrated emperor at the Basilica of Saint Lawrence outside the Walls, in Rome by Pope Honorius III on 9 April 1217. His reign, however, was short lived. He was ambushed by the Greeks in Albania and died in prison during the winter of 1218‚Äì1219, having never reached Constantinople. Pursuant to the agreement between Peter II and Herv√©, Matilda, as his only heiress, inherited the counties of Auxerre and Tonnerre. Herv√©, who was on the Fifth Crusade, returned to Europe immediately on the news, and was successful in getting Peter's counties under his control. Two years later, Matilda and Herv√©'s daughter Agnes was married to Guy IV de Ch√¢tillon, Count of Saint-Pol. Herv√© de Donzy died on 22 January 1223, at Saint-Aignan. His death has been attributed to poison. Four years later, Matilda married Guigues IV of Forez. Very popular because of her generosity, she signed a charter of postage to the deputies sent by Auxerre on August 15, 1223 at Ch√¢teau de Druyes. The charter granted freedoms and enfranchisement to the inhabitants of Auxerre and marked the birth of their commune; it was confirmed by Pierre de Courtenay in 1188. She founded the abbey of Notre-Dame of the Reconfort of Saizy for Cistercian nuns in 1235 and increased its allocation in 1244. In 1257, she confirmed that Ch√¢teau de Druyes, where she frequently resided, became the property of Reigny Abbey. That same year she exchanged her mill at Pont-Cizeau with the monks of the Abbey of Saint-Martin de Nevers, with a rent of 100 sous.

The school serves the Cariboo region of British Columbia. History In the 1950s, three Seventh-day Adventists opened two logging operations in the Cariboo region of British Columbia, drawing Adventist loggers and mill workers to the area. One-room schools were started in various logging camps around Williams Lake. These schools moved from camp to camp with workers and their families, most of whom were Adventist. A Seventh-day Adventist Church opened in 1956 in Williams Lake, including a one- room Adventist school in the church building. In 1958, a school building was constructed in town on the corner of 7th and Pinchbeck, with one classroom being used. Classes were offered there for the 1959-60 school year and it opened permanently in 1961. The school added a classroom in 1962. In 1968, a third classroom was opened. The school expanded to four classrooms in the following year with the addition of a grade 10 program. The school soon ran out of room and the school moved to a property located on the south shore of Williams Lake. The new school opened on January 31, 1971 with the name, Cariboo Adventist Junior Academy. The school was initially designed as an open school concept without walls. The school continued to expand quickly: in 1977, an addition was completed which added a basement gym, a woodworking shop, and a home economics room. In 1979, the school completed another expansion to grade 12, at which point the school was renamed Cariboo Adventist Academy. Around this time, the school gym was converted into an industrial arts centre. In 1987, another school building was opened, which contained a new gymnasium, a science lab, and classrooms for high school. Cariboo Adventist Academy has continued to operate in these same school buildings with enrolment spanning between 80-160 students over the years. Academics Cariboo Adventist Academy follows the curriculum established by the British Columbia Ministry of Education, and upon completion of Grade 12, its graduates receive the Dogwood Diploma which is awarded by the same. The school is accredited by the Board of Regents of the General Conference of Seventh-day Adventists, and is classified as a Group 1 school under the BC Independent Schools Act. Cariboo Adventist Academy is a member of the Federation of Independent School Associations in British Columbia, belonging to the Associate Member Group. The school is divided into an elementary division which runs from grades K-7, and a high school division which runs from grades 8-12. CAA offers courses in Bible, English, Mathematics, Science, Biology, Chemistry, Physics, Socials, Physical education, French, and Music. Students have the option to take elective courses offered through West Coast Adventist School or through GROW. Athletics CAA is a member of the Canadian Adventist School Athletics association and competes in volleyball and flag football tournaments organized by CASA each year in Burnaby, Abbotsford, and Kelowna. Cariboo also participates in volleyball tournaments hosted by Burman University. At the junior level, CAA also competes locally in volleyball, floor hockey, and basketball, hosting the annual tournaments for volleyball and basketball. Historically, CAA also had a gymnastics team which travelled around the province putting on gymnastics routines while promoting a drug-free lifestyle. Extracurriculars In the 1970s, the younger students at CAA participated in a choir known as the Royalaires, that would tour around the Cariboo region. By the 1980s, CAA had an award-winning band and choir that would go on frequent tours around British Columbia and Alberta. Today, the band program is still active. Students at Cariboo Adventist Academy have also participated in mission trips. In the school's first mission trip in 1979, students went to Corozal Town, Belize, where they built a service building at a church school. Later in the 1990s, CAA students went on multiple mission trips to Mexico, where they helped build an orphanage.

The park specializes in the conservation and promotion of Swiss fauna, particularly small animals and birds of prey. The zoo also has a care center for wild animals.  General  The park is located on 3 hectares of land (30,000 m2) and is the home of approximately 300 animals. La Garenne welcomes approximately 90,000 visitors every year; between 250 and 100 visitors daily, with 3000 on peak days. The park is a member of the ZooSchweiz and WAZA. The park is the propriety of the Fondation La Garenne, a not for profit organization that manages the park and its inhabitants. This foundation gets most of its financing from its affiliate association, the Association des Amis de la Garenne. The goal of the association is to realize the objectives of the zoo through monetary and moral support. The foundation receives funds from membership contribution, one-time donations, sponsorships from societies and government, and charitable giving from inheritances of private individuals.  Organization of the park  In 2014, the park relocated on new land and it reopened in 2016. The new park La Garenne possess the biggest aviary in Europe, with a height of 28 m at its highest point. Visitors can walk among rock walls where the birds build their nests. The new entrance pavilion of the park was created by LOCALARCHITECTURE. It is a long building with large triangular windows giving a view on to the park. The pavilion is built entirely of wood and has a green roof covered with local alpine plant species. Many service are offered inside the pavilion, including a gift shop, restaurant and reception area. Since its creation, La Garenne has been an important actor in the care and rehabilitation of wild animals found by people in the area. Its care center is still in operation, and more than 1600 animals of many species have been released to the wild after care in the center. Every year approximately 450 animals are brought to the center. Of that number, 40% will be released in the wild. Some animals will get a home in other zoos. Handicapped animals are often kept in the zoo for reproduction. Another important part of the mission of La Garenne is the education of the public on the subject of the environment and the local fauna. There is a classroom for school children and groups. Inside the aviary in La Garenne  Mission of the foundation  The Fondation La Garenne has a general mission on four planes that it has retained since its creation: * Retrieving and caring for wild animals in difficulty * Participating in the survival and the reintroduction of vulnerable species * Proposing education services on the subject of the environment * Showing the Swiss fauna to the public  Some species (among others)  Mammals: wolf, lynx, fox, Saas sheep, Alpine ibex, goat, wild boar, mangalia, groundhog, coypu, beaver and racoon. Birds: bearded vulture, little owl, woodpeckers, waterfowl, ducks, kestrel, passerines, barn owl, Eurasian eagle-owl, griffon vulture and northern bald ibis. Reptiles and amphibians: European pond turtle, common toad, Alpine newt, black salamander and common frog. There is also an anthill to observe the insects at work and the park also has a great diversity of flora species from the area.  History  The Zoo La Garenne was founded in 1952 by Erwin Meier with the idea to promote and help the conservation of the fauna of Switzerland, and also as a place to care for hurt or handicapped animals, as well abandoned pets. The park was first built on 6,100 m2 of land. The park opened its doors to the public in 1962. The Association des Amis de la Garenne was created in 1975 to give financial support to the project. After years of educating the public about the ecology of the area and its conservation efforts to the fauna of Switzerland, the zoo was recognized in 1977 for its public utility. In 2004, the foundation of the park started to reflect on the sustainability of the park: the infrastructure was old, the financing was insufficient, and the public was not as interested as it once was. Many ideas were put on the table, but opposition from the public forced the foundation to rethink its ideas many times. The idea of creating a bigger park was proposed, and the opposition ended. New construction started in April 2014. The project was launched on new land at a cost of 14.5 million Swiss francs. In 2016, after two years of construction, the park reopened in its new form on 3 hectares. The zoo is now more akin to a wildlife park, with enclosures instead of cages, where visitors can see the fauna from a few meters away and can be inside the aviary. During its reconstruction, the zoo decided to keep only local animals as much as possible and had to find new homes for many of its exotic inhabitants, approximately 30 animals. The park now concentrates its efforts on the promotion and conservation of uniquely Swiss species.  Conservation of the bearded vulture  Bearded vultures in La Garenne La Garenne was one of the first animal park in Switzerland to enter the program for the reproduction and rehabilitation of the bearded vulture in the Alps. The zoo was part of the program for the rehabilitation of the bird in the Alps since its inception. The first bearded vulture was born in La Garenne in 1986. One of the females born in La Garenne was released into the wild in 1989. Since then, many birds born in the park have been released in many habitats in Europe. At the venerable age of 46 years, the male bearded vulture of La Garenne, Athos, died from an infection, worsened by his old age. He fathered more than 25 birds. Athos came to La Garenne in 1972 and has fathered 13 bearded vultures released in the Alps. The body of Athos was preserved at the Mus√©e Cantonnal de zoologie √† Lausanne, and the naturalized bird was loaned to La Garenne. Athos is one of the oldest bearded vultures ever recorded in the world. The mother of the first bearded vulture to be born in the wild in the Alps in 1997 was from La Garenne. A new 22-year-old male, Helios, came to the park in 2016 to take the place of Athos alongside Athia, the 26-year-old female.

Education Surani was educated at Plymouth University (BSc), the University of Strathclyde (MSc) and the University of Cambridge (PhD) where his research was supervised by Robert Edwards, who later won the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine. One or more of the preceding sentences incorporates text from the royalsociety.org website where: Career and research Surani co-discovered mammalian genomic imprinting with Davor Solter in 1984, and subsequently examined its mechanism and the functions of imprinted genes. He later established the genetic basis for germ cell specification, using a single-cell analysis in mice. This genetic network also initiates the unique resetting of the germline epigenome, including comprehensive erasure of DNA methylation towards re-establishing full genomic potency. Epigenetic modifications and re-establishments of imprints then generate functional differences between parental genomes whilst aberrant imprints contribute to human disease. Surani's research is identifying key regulators of human germ line development and epigenome reprogramming, revealing differences between humans and mice attributable to their divergent pluripotent states and early postimplantation development. He is also investigating transposable elements, host defence mechanisms, noncoding RNAs, and the potential for transgenerational epigenetic inheritance in mammals. Awards and honours Surani has received several awards for his work including the Royal Medal (2010), the Gabor Medal (2001) and the Mendel Lectures (2010). He received the Canada Gairdner International Award, with Davor Solter, \\"For the discovery of mammalian genomic imprinting that causes parent-of-origin specific gene expression and its consequences for development and disease.\\" He won the Rosenstiel Award in 2006, with Solter and Mary Lyon, for \\"pioneering work on epigenetic gene regulation in mammalian embryos\\".

Eden Savill, was an Englishman who had a short but successful career in South Australia as a racehorse owner and trainer, culminating in his horse winning the 1882 Melbourne Cup. History Savill was born in Tinwell, Rutland, the only son of George Savill of Ingethorpe House, Stamford, Lincolnshire. He arrived in Adelaide sometime before 1871, when he was, as \\"Cerberus\\", drawing political cartoons for The Portonian, a weekly satirical newspaper, and was also exhibiting his artwork. He married and had a home at a property at Campbelltown. He was a member of the Adelaide Racing Club and acted as starter in 1874. He joined the rival South Australian Jockey Club after its re- formation in 1875. His horse The Buck raced in the Selling Hurdles of New Years Day 1877 With no other qualifications apart from long experience with horses he set himself up as a trainer of thoroughbreds, with considerable success: Wild Irishman, a brown gelding jumper he purchased from Hutchinson, performed credibly without placing and was sold to H. E. Downer. He trained A. R. Malcom's jumper Unknown, grey gelding Sheet Anchor for J. L. Stirling and flat-racer Nelly for George Church. Around 1878 he took over Gabriel Bennett's lease of Charles Brown Fisher's (1818-1908) Lockleys training stable, just off the Henley Beach Road, and with the assistance of Tom Jordan (c. 1825‚Äì1906) made it the most influential training stable in Adelaide. For a time he handled William Pile's stable, but lost that valuable business early in 1880 after the Newmarket incident and Savill's legal tussle with the S.A.J.C. committee, (see below) of which Pile was a member. In May 1881 Pile sold up and Savill purchased his The Assyrian (previously Rothschild). He also trained horses for W. B. Rounsevell, M. C. Jacobs, C. Leslie Macdonald, J. Crozier and Tom Barnfield. Among his successes were: :Device, won the 1878 S.A.J.C. St. Leger Stakes ridden by McMahon; and the S.A.J.C. Accession Winter Handicap followed by the Queen's Guineas (both wins with Tom Hales in the saddle), and subsequently sold to Seth Ferry. :St. Barb won the 1880 A.R.C. New Years Gift and the Newmarket Handicap at Morphettville (held over from Christmas due to bad weather) :The Wandering Jew in 1879 won the SAJC Flying Handicap and Spring Handicap, and later sold to W. A. Long of Sydney :Pawnbroker won the 1879 Newmarket Guineas and S.A.J.C. Spring Derby :Banter won the Adelaide Cup of 1879 and the (Queen's) Birthday Cup of 1880 :First Water won the 1880 Adelaide Cup :Sir Charles won the Flying Handicap at the 1880 Christmas meeting :The Israelite won the 1881 South Australian Stakes :Henrietta, her daughter, won the 1881 A.R.C. Trial Handicap :Footstep won the 1882 A.R.C. City Handicap :The Assyrian was bought by Savill from William Pile in May 1881 for ¬£236. Two months later, with 8 st. 6 lb. and 9 st. 1 lb., he won the principal handicaps at the A.R.C. Winter Meeting. He was entered for the 1882 Melbourne Cup with little chance of success, but last-minute rain turned the track to a quagmire, which suited the heavyweight horse admirably and he came home a winner. In all, Savill won 111 races, with total prizemoney ¬£12,252 10s., not to mention whatever he made on wagers, and \\"it seldom occurred that a Lockleys horse surprised his trainer by winning\\". Return to England Shortly after his 1882 triumph with The Assyrian, Savill and family left for England, and lived in St. Martins, Stamford, Lincolnshire. The eldest daughter married the son of a war hero; the youngest married an Earl. He was involved in thoroughbred racing in England, and had a horse named Ringmaster who won some good races. In May 1909 he was committed for trial at the Meath Assizes charged with feloniously shooting at one Charles Fortescue Uniacke at Dunboyne, near Dublin on 19 May 1909. He had been summoned to Uniacke's house \\"The Villa\\" by his wife, promising that she would be alone. (This was not a romantic tryst: Savile had apparently written to her father and cousin letters containing some accusation.) He entered the drawing room and her husband appeared. A scuffle ensued between them and Savile drew his revolver, which went off harmlessly, though whether deliberate or accidental is unknown. His death in 1920 went unremarked in the Australian press. Others who sailed to the Colonies, made a fortune and promptly returned to England with their new- found wealth, met a similar fate. Personality Savill was a handsome and immaculately groomed man who dressed well, and was seldom seen out-of-doors without kid gloves. He had the unfortunate habit of speaking his mind in a most candid and impartial fashion, which brought him into collision with many associates, :He had harsh words with John Crozier, who was acting as steward at a \\"Newmarket\\" race meeting conducted privately by Simeon Barnard at Morphettville on 27 December 1879. Savill apologized, but Crozier made an official complaint to the SAJC. In a series of events strongly reminiscent of the 1889 Seth Ferry ‚Äî Tattersalls confrontation, the club committee convened a special meeting at which Savill was not present, and imposed on him a twelve months' ban from the course. Savill engaged prominent lawyers J. W. Downer Q.C. and C. Mann Q.C. to sue certain committee members (R. C. Baker MLC, E. M. Bagot and others), but not including Rounsevell and some others. He won the case, with costs, which would have been substantial, and continued racing at Morphettville. but was popular with the public, who appreciated his honest and straightforward dealings as an owner and trainer. Other interests He joined the Adelaide Coursing Club and in 1875, 1876 served as Secretary. The club held its meetings at Corryton Park, the property of W. B. Rounsevell at Morphettville. He was a poultry fancier, exhibited at the Adelaide Show, and later served as judge. Family John Eden Savill (c. 1847‚Äì1920) married Isabella Sarah Charlotte Macdonald (23 October 1854 ‚Äì ) on 4 September 1872. She was a sister of C. Leslie Macdonald.

It was first released in 1996 by The Music Corporation and was later re-issued by Cherry Red in 2000. Compiled by John Haxby, The Genesis of Slade is the complete collection of 25 pre-Slade recordings ranging from 1964 to 1966. It features studio recordings by The Vendors (tracks 1-4), Steve Brett & the Mavericks (track 5-11), The 'N Betweens (Mk. 1) (tracks 12-19) and The 'N Betweens (Mk. 2) (tracks 20-25). Recordings The first four tracks were recorded by The Vendors in June 1964, featuring Dave Hill on guitar and Don Powell on drums. They appeared on a privately pressed extended play. The seven tracks by Steve Brett & The Mavericks were recorded in 1965 and featured Noddy Holder on guitar and backing vocals. Six of the songs were featured across three singles, released by Columbia, while \\"Hurting Inside\\" was unreleased at the time. The 'N Betweens (Mk. 1) recorded eight tracks in 1965, featuring Hill and Powell. Four were pressed onto a private acetate and the other four were released extended play by Barclay. The 'N Betweens (Mk. 2) was made up of the four members that would later form Slade. All six songs were recorded in 1966. \\"Security\\" was released as a promotional single in America by Highland Records, while \\"You Better Run\\" was released as a UK single by Columbia. The compilation's last three tracks were recorded by the band with Kim Fowley, but were unreleased at the time. One omission from the pre-Slade recordings is the 1967 unreleased recording \\"Delighted to See You\\". Produced by Norman Smith, the song first surfaced on the 1994 various artists compilation Psychedelia at Abbey Road - 1965 to 1969. The compilation's Cherry Red re-issue accidentally omitted \\"Hurting Inside\\", although it was listed as a track on the album. Track listing Critical reception Richie Unterberger of AllMusic said: \\"The idea behind this compilation is one that's extremely useful to Slade fans trying to track down rarities recorded by groups in which the members played prior to Ambrose Slade's formation in the late '60s. This 24-track CD includes all of them. Still, the overused clich√© \\"of historical interest only\\" applies here, although some of the 'N Betweens tracks are fairly decent. The Vendors' EP is dominated by just-professional oldies covers. The Steve Brett & the Mavericks singles are pretty limp and corny mainstream pop/rockers heavily influenced by Elvis Presley ballads and sub-Elvis British crooners like Adam Faith. The first lineup of the 'N Betweens boasted a far tougher R&B-rock; British Invasion sound, but most of the tunes here are far below the standards of the Yardbirds, the Pretty Things, and the like. Best of all on the disc, though not great by any means, are the two 1966 singles by the 'N Betweens' second lineup, which are fair but not very imaginative period British soul- blues-rock.\\" In 2000, Record Collector said: \\"Like most acts who hit it big in the early 70s, the members of Slade had flailed around in the soft white underbelly of the mid-60s British music scene before finally discovering their own voice. This reissued collection assembles 25 tracks cut by three pre-Slade acts to provide what is, undoubtedly, an essential document for Slade obsessives. Unfortunately, it's far from essential for the rest of us.\\"Record Collector - September 2000 - Album Reviews Personnel ;The Vendors *John Howells - vocals *Mick Marson - rhythm guitar *Dave Hill - lead guitar *Billy Diffey - bass *Don Powell - drums ;Steve Brett & the Mavericks *Steve Brett - vocals, guitar *Phil Burnell - rhythm guitar *Noddy Holder - guitar, backing vocals *Terry Taylor - saxophone *Pete Bickley - bass *Gerry Kibble - drums ;The 'N Betweens (Mk. 1) *John Howells - vocals *Mick Marson - rhythm guitar *Dave Hill - lead guitar *Dave 'Cass' Jones - bass *Don Powell - drums ;The 'N Betweens (Mk. 2) *Noddy Holder - vocals, guitar *Dave Hill - lead guitar *Jim Lea - bass *Don Powell - drums ;The Genesis of Slade *John Haxby - compiled by, sleeve *John Howells - liner notes *David Johnston, Max Howarth - remastering References 1996 compilation albums Slade compilation albums Cherry Red Records compilation albums ","title":"The Genesis of Slade"},{"id":"55077431","text":"North General Hospital was in East Harlem, New York City, U.S., 1979‚Äì2010.

In the first, scores of 7 and 25 for the Cambridge University team against the Cambridge Town Club were enough for the university team to want to take a second look at him, and he was duly picked for the MCC team to play against the university, a frequent ploy in university cricket at the time, but then failed to score in his only innings.

The English title page reads, This has led to the supposition that William Ames was the author of The Light upon the Candlestick, but the wording means that The Light upon the Candlestick agrees in principal with the work The Mysteries of the Kingdom of God by William Ames. As the title page says it was printed for the Author, it is likely that the tract was printed for the Author of The Mysteries of the Kingdom of God, William Ames, to support his position ‚Äúagainst several Professors‚Äù of the Collegiants with whom he was in disagreement. In the mid- seventeenth century there was a Quaker community in Holland seeking sanctuary from persecution in England. There they came into contact with the radical Protestant sect of the Collegiants. William Ames was a Quaker minister who, after being imprisoned for his beliefs in Ireland, moved to Amsterdam, where he preached with John Stubbs.Sewel, p. 108 William Ames zealously preached to the Collegiants and they were initially in accord although later they fell out.Sewel, Preface Adam Boreel was a Dutch theologian and Hebrew scholar, a leader of the Collegiants and a friend of Baruch Spinoza; Peter Balling was a member of the Collegiants; Benjamin Furly, associated with John Locke, George Fox and William Penn, was an English Quaker merchant then living in Rotterdam. Contents The Light upon the Candlestick proposes that God is the origin of all Knowledge. We can only be aware of God‚Äôs working in the world because we have a prior knowledge of God. One can become aware of the Light of God only by seeking inward. Following this Inward light will result in Union with God.Rufus M.

Roberts lives and works in Corrales, New Mexico. Her work is in the permanent collection of several museums in the United States.  Early life and education  Holly Roberts was born in Boulder, Colorado. At the age of two, her family moved to Santa Fe, New Mexico where she spent the remainder of her early years. When she was sixteen she graduated early from high school and started her college career, taking six years in six different schools to complete her undergraduate education. She spent her freshman year at Western State College, then moved to the University of California Santa Barbara for her sophomore year. Next she attended Instituto Allende and the Bellas Artes in San Miguel de Allende, then transitioned to the University of New Mexico‚Äôs (UNM) Andean Center in Quito, Ecuador. Her time in Ecuador and Mexico ignited her interest in printmaking. She finished her undergraduate education by graduating from UNM with a Bachelor of Fine Arts with a minor in Spanish. After receiving her BFA, Roberts was hired by the Tamarind Institute, as curator of prints. There she was able to continue her printmaking while simultaneously attending painting classes at the University of New Mexico. After four years at Tamarind, in 1978 Roberts moved to Tempe, Arizona to attend graduate school at Arizona State University on a full scholarship. When Roberts finished her MFA, she and her partner, Robert Wilson, moved to Zuni, New Mexico so Wilson could pay back his medical school student loans working for the Indian Health Service. She and Wilson stayed in Zuni for eight years where their two daughters were born (in Gallup). In 1991 the family moved to Chicago, Illinois so that Wilson could complete his post doctoral work in sports medicine. Roberts and her family stayed for a year before returning to New Mexico where they settled in Corrales.  Influences and themes  ‚ÄúThe Content of Holly Roberts‚Äô images comes from two broad sources. First is her nearly lifelong experience of living in the American Southwest, from an attachment not only to the colors of the landscape and its active outdoor lifestyle, but to the ubiquitous influence of Native American, Mexican and Hispanic peoples indigenous to the area. The second source, which gets closer to the meaning of her work, is a conceptualization of human emotions, cultural history and interpersonal relationships. The images that include horses, deer, birds and other animals frequently reflect the emotional concerns of the other works.‚Äù Her painted photographs have a psychological overtone. Her technique from the mid 80‚Äôs to 2003 was to develop her own black and white photographs, cut and glue them to a surface and then paint directly on them with oil paint. This created an eerie combination of the made-up world of the painted elements with the occasional reveal of the photograph. It was this process and style that gained her widespread recognition, mostly from the photographic corner of the world, ‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt even think of myself as a photographer until I began to get all these awards in photography. I guess the photo world thought I was really great because I was so abusive to photography‚Äù In 2004 Roberts flipped her process and, with the use of digital images and acrylic paint, began putting the photographic images on top of the paint. She explains, ‚ÄúI found that when the images that made the completed piece were made from photographs that came from disparate sources, but still related in some way, the images were much more powerful than just using the photograph directly as it was.‚Äù ‚ÄúIn her photo-painting hybrids Roberts synchronizes the abstract and imaginary with the literal and everyday.‚Äù Around 2006, she began painting an \\"abstract dreamlike landscape\\" before adding her photographic work. ‚ÄúThe American Southwest continues to inspire and inform Robert‚Äôs work. Guided by her imagination and emotional responses to the landscape, Roberts breathes additional life and narrative into her photographs, turning clouds, birds, snakes, gravel and trees into compelling works of art. Her finished pieces are deeply layered, both in a physical sense and in the stories woven by her intentional choice of characters, scenery, color palette, and title. Roberts masterfully brings together ideas of mortality and birth, longing and comfort, spirituality and humanity, disguised by humor or through a lighthearted aesthetic. The artist‚Äôs use of allegory and characters [...] fuse together elements of spirituality and humanity.‚Äù The imagery childlike and primitive, but the themes of her work are deal with issues that adults face every day. ‚ÄúRoberts is clearly drawn in a more general sense to primitive art [...] her striving for simplicity within the images and her use of figures internally charged with meaning but freed from an enveloping environment are other aspects of this borrowing‚Äù  Career  In 1973 Holly Roberts worked at Tamarind Institute for four years as a curator. After receiving her MFA from Arizona State University, she and her husband lived on the Zuni Indian Reservation where Roberts worked on her painted photographs and had two daughters, Ramey and Teal. She exhibited her work, and began to establish a name for herself when the Friends of Photography published a monograph of her work for their untitled series (#50). In 1991, she and her family moved to Chicago, where she set up a studio and continued to work, exhibiting her work widely. Upon returning to New Mexico the following year, she continued her studio practice while raising, with her husband, their two daughters. Along with making and exhibiting her art work, Roberts has developed an extensive workshop practice, teaching anywhere from 4-10 workshops a year in different locations at schools and universities around the country, among them Anderson Ranch Art Center in Snowmass, Colorado, Penland School of Arts and Crafts in Penland, North Carolina and Arrowmont School of Arts and Crafts in Gatlinburg, Tennessee.

From Bay and Newnan, the tracks ran North on Newnan to Adams and hence to Broad Street at about the intersection of the current Adams and Myrtle Streets. The little car line was bought out by Henry Plant's much larger Jacksonville Street Railway in 1886 and much of its route east of Broad Street was taken up and a new route was laid up Broad from Bay to Monroe.

Projections suggest that by 2036 the percentage of older employees will increase to 30 percent and equate to 13 percent of the total labour force. Voluntary work undertaken by older persons is recognised as providing both a significant direct economic contribution as well as an indirect contribution where, for example, the provision of child care by a grandparent, enables a parent to return to paid work.Office for Senior Citizens, 2014 Report on the Positive Ageing Strategy, April 2015 Two areas where older persons have faced challenges are finding employment in the first instance and access to training both to upskill and refresh capabilities.

The larvae damage trees and other plants by feeding on their roots. They are mostly active during dusk and at night. They are good burrowers and hide at the base of oak trees and other food sources. The female is larger than the male, with an ovipositor used to deposit eggs. When the female is laying eggs, she \\"shivers\\" and eggs are laid through the ovipositor, positioned down into the soil or under litter, usually in groups of threes and twos, but sometimes ones or fours. After the eggs are laid, the female moves her ovipositor up and down to fill the hole she created. When freshly laid, the eggs are pure white, glistening with moisture, but, after a while, they usually change to a deep yellow. Within a few days, the deep yellow eggs turn to a light washed pink. As the larvae develop inside, the eggs turn ivory in color. The eggs are the size of small grains of rice. When the larvae are hatching, they chew through one of the elongated, pointed sides of the egg. The larvae's heads are adapted for digging into the soil, and they have strong black mandibles for chewing roots. Larvae tunnel downward to feed on the living roots of a variety of trees and shrubs. At first, they may feed on bark, but then proceed to hollow out small roots. Pupation occurs in spring, about 10 cm under the ground. The life cycle is probably three years. The male flies more often than the female. Males are also attracted to lights.

His father worked for the Finkbine lumber company, moved to D'Lo, Mississippi, and was a founder of the D'Lo Methodist Church. Thomas attended the D‚ÄôLo Methodist church, which was across the street from where he lived. It was there that he got his religious calling. He got his preacher‚Äôs license when he was sixteen. He worked his way through Millsaps College, a small but recognized institution in Jackson, Mississippi, where he graduated with honors in 1912. His quote in the Millsaps 1912 yearbook reads \\"To do good rather than be conspicuous.\\" Thomas' ministry began in Danville, Mississippi as he simultaneously served many churches as a rural circuit-rider. He married Martha Ellen Fondren, a member of one of his congregations, on February 18, 1913 when they were both 21 years old.

He said that, when signing up as a navy chaplain, he was asked whether he wanted to be in the regular navy or the reserve and he chose the former. When World War I was over, he planned to return to civilian ministry but was informed that, as a member of the regular navy, he was obliged to remain aboard the transport as it brought soldiers back, so he crossed the Atlantic a total of 28 times.Thomas, W.N., Jr., Oral interview Thomas soon found that he loved the navy, its people and all of his subsequent assignments. His first shore duty, from September 1919 to February 1922, was at the US Public Service Hospital, Fort Lyon, Colorado, which had formerly served as a tuberculosis hospital. Many of the patients there had been gassed in the war. He was commissioned as a lieutenant on November 3, 1920. He then served aboard from February 1922 to July 1924. Thomas' first tour at the Naval Academy was as assistant chaplain from 1924 to 1927 under Chaplain Sidney K. Evans, who later became Chief of Chaplains from 1929 to 1935. In addition to regular duties, he held services on the USS Reina Mercedes that was docked at the Academy and used as a disciplinary barracks.Thomas, Martha Ellen Fondren, Oral history transcript, interviewed by H. Lawrence Martin (oral history program, Corps, USN, February 19‚Äì20, 1981), p.15-17. He was promoted to lieutenant commander November 2, 1924 and then commander November 3, 1924. He then served a two-year tour from October 1927 to October 1929 aboard the for a State Department goodwill tour of Europe and Africa. It had been said that \\"He had prayed over and for more foreign dignitaries, of every shape, dress, nationality and race than any other Navy Chaplain.\\" Young, Merle N., The Rich Years of Chaplain N. Thomas, The Chaplain, A journal for Chaplains, Vol.26, No. 6 Nov-Dec 1969 p. 25. His next tour was as the chaplain of the 14th Naval District at Pearl Harbor, Hawaii, from November 1929 to July 1932. His final sea duty, from July 1932 to May 1933, was aboard the during the Great Depression.  Senior Chaplain of the United States Naval Academy  Chaplain Thomas in pulpit at USNA Chapel 1940 The highlight of Thomas‚Äô career was at the Naval Academy as Command Chaplain from June 1933 to June 1945 when so many became acquainted with him as midshipmen, instructors, administrative staff and students at the Naval Postgraduate School. His twelve-year tenure at the Academy was unprecedented. For many years the authorship of The Midshipman Prayer was unknown. In 1938 Thomas wrote the prayer at the request of some Midshipmen. It is said to encompass much of his theology and his ideal of a Naval Officer.Martin, P. 6Duncan, Henry C. \\"A Tribute to William Nathaniel Thomas,\\" Navy Chaplain's Bulletin, Spring 1971 p.6. He never sought credit for the prayer. It has been used at Divine Service in the Naval Academy Chapel ever since. A bronze plaque of the prayer resides in the chapel. While at the academy, he performed 800 weddings and 700 baptisms. At graduation time he often had services 30 minutes apart as he alternated between the upper and lower chapels.Drury, Clifford Merrill, The History of the Chaplain's Corps USN, two vols. (Washington, D.C.: Bureau of Naval Personnel, 1949) 2:222. His duties included the Academy's Christian Association. He also addressed many civic associations, graduations, and regularly entertained midshipmen in their home as Command Chaplain. He oversaw the enlargement of the Academy Chapel, referred to as the ‚ÄúCathedral of the Navy.‚Äù The nave was extended by a thousand seats converting the design of the Chapel from a Greek to a Latin cross with 2500 seats. He replaced the cannons with anchors on the Chapel entrance believing \\"that religion should be the anchor of a naval officer's life\\".Duncan, p.6. A new pulpit was created and a votive ship installed. The completed Chapel was re-dedicated on April 28, 1940 with Thomas presiding.Drury, 2:102. He was instrumental in bringing the Jewish clergy to the Academy.Einstein, Seymour, Pride Without Prejudice, Shipmate, November 1988, p. 15. He brought to the pulpit of the Academy some of the finest ministers in America: Dean Luther Weigle, Peter Marshall and Ralph Sockman.Thomas, Martha Ellen Fondren, p.35, 40-42. On December 7, 1941 Peter Marshall, visiting minister from the New York Presbyterian Church of Washington, D.C. asked Thomas if he might change his announced topic. Peter Marshall then delivered a most famous sermon, \\"Rendezvous in Samarra\\" Marshall, Peter J. Dr.-Editor, The Wartime Sermons of Dr. Peter Marshall, Clarin Call Marketing, Inc. Copyright 2005. . about death and immortality to the assembled regiment of Midshipmen. After chapel all were to learn of the attack on Pearl Harbor.Marshall, Catherine Man Called Peter, The Story of Peter Marshall. Copyright 1951. McGraw-Hill Book Co, Inc. p. 230-231. Thomas had served on board three ships that were at Pearl Harbor: the the and the . Before his sermons, Thomas would honor the members of the Naval Academy graduates who had died in service.Anderson, Alister C., Oral interview by Richard K. Templeton, July 14, 2016 in Frederick, Maryland. In 1943 he received an honorary Doctor of Divinity from American University in Washington, D.C.  After the war  He was one of 39 chaplains to serve in both World War I and World War II.Martin, P. 15 Thomas would have preferred remaining at the Naval Academy but became the seventh chief of chaplains in Washington, D.C., on July 1, 1945. He held commission Number One as rear admiral of the upper half in the Chaplain Corps but preferred to be addressed as \\"Chaplain\\", maintaining that \\"the title of admiral properly belonged to a lord of the sea.\\" He much preferred his professional life, being first a minister and second a naval officer, to an administrative position. After the surrender of Japan, President Truman asked Thomas and the Army Chief of Chaplains, Luther D. Miller, to conduct a service of thanksgiving at the White House.Drury, Vol.2 p. 212-213 At the end of the War, Beginning with a Corps of 2811 chaplains, Thomas effectively oversaw the demobilization and discharge of chaplains. He had \\"civil readjustment\\" chaplains assigned to centers so chaplain dischargees could talk with a chaplain before leaving the service. He oversaw the creation of many chapels, many at closed naval installations, with the support of the Chief of Naval Operations and President Truman with the three major faith groups represented. These were available to church groups in the local civilian community.Young, Merle N., p. 26. Thomas brought completion to the first historical volumes of the Chaplain Corps.Drury, Vol.1:iv. District chaplains were given added prominence and the first District Chaplains Conference was held in 1946.Drury, Vol. 2:101. Under the leadership of Thomas, the first official manual ever issued for the use of the Chaplain Corps was issued was in August 1947.Drury, Vol. 2:153-54. He helped formalize post-graduate studies for chaplains. It is thought that the circuit riding chaplaincy ministry on destroyers was based on Thomas having been a circuit rider in Mississippi.Drury Vol.2:89. In January 1947 Thomas was awarded the Legion of Merit.Drury, Vol. 2:116. In 1952 Thomas wrote the Dedication in Memorial Hall in Bancroft Hall of the US Naval Academy that was placed beneath the \\"Dont Give up the Ship\\" flag.  Retirement  Thomas retired from active duty in 1949. Upon retirement he and Mrs. Thomas moved to Lake Junaluska Methodist Assembly near Waynesville, North Carolina, where he resided until his death. He served as dean of the Memorial Chapel at Lake Junaluska. He preached in many of the local churches. When asked if he had any difficulties serving the different denominations, he said, \\"Not at all. I dehydrated the Baptists, thawed out the Presbyterians and quieted down the shouting Methodists.\\"Alford, Dorothy \\"Thomas was Chief of Chaplains.\\" The Meteor, Copiah County, Mississippi, Jan. 29, 1975, p.A3. He was active in civic affairs and belonged to a large number of both military and civilian organizations. Frequently in demand as a speaker, his most popular speech was \\"The Definition of a Gentleman.\\" He pursued his lifelong interests in golf, reading, gardening, woodworking, and performing weddings. He said, \\"He would prefer to tee off on the golf course than to do it at people.\\" Martin, p.14. He suffered two strokes in his last days and died April 26, 1971 at the age of 79.  Personal life  Thomas was married to Martha Ellen Fondren (1892‚Äì1990) on February 18, 1913. They had two children both of whom served in the US Navy. William Nathaniel Thomas Jr. (1919‚Äì2013) was a 1942 medical graduate from University of Virginia, Charlottesville. In October 1943 he received his naval commission, attained the rank of lieutenant in the medical corps and was wounded on Okinawa as a battalion surgeon with the first Marine Division. After the war he became a radiologist in Annapolis, Maryland. John Edward Thomas (1930‚Äì1993) graduated from University of Virginia, Charlottesville, with a degree in psychology. He entered the navy in 1952 and served for three years during the Korean War. He attained the rank of lieutenant junior grade and was an executive ship officer.  Death  Thomas had requested a simple funeral. There was a memorial service at the United States Naval Academy Chapel in Annapolis. He is buried on Chaplains Hill at Arlington National Cemetery, Virginia, where he was joined by his wife in 1990. He is to have said, \\"A Chaplain's personal life is his most effective sermon.\\"Navy Chaplains Bulletin Spring, 1971 Bureau of Naval Personnel, cover.

However, in another holiday in the summer, he went to Croatia again but stayed there much longer than expected (he was supposed to have been back by 18 June) without informing the Gor Mahia board about the situation; he was relieved of his duties in June 2013 after he returned. In his defense, Logaru≈°iƒá demurred that he did not have a work permit and lived in Nairobi on a tourist visa. Secondly, he raised issue about his evident lack of formal contract with the Nairobi-based team. Female fans criticized the board for his dismissal shortly after as well. Simba After leaving Kenya, he was offered a relatively high salary from Simba SC to coach them and took the offer. When he got Simba SC good results, the Tanzanian outfit bought him a house overlooking the beachfront. Unfortunately, he could not speak Swahili which hindered him from communicating fluently with the Tanzanian press. Half a year later, his contract was cancelled. Logaru≈°iƒá demanded 3.6 million Tanzanian shillings from Simba SC as requital for the club unprocedurally cancelling his contract.

His brother, Casimir Pierre P√©rier, served as Prime Minister of France. Joseph P√©rier was extremely wealthy, perhaps the richest man in France, mainly from his coal mining interests. He served in the Chamber of Deputies for 16 years during the July Monarchy. Family Andr√© Jean Joseph P√©rier was born on 28 November 1786 in Grenoble, Is√®re. His parents were Claude P√©rier (1742‚Äì1802) and Marie-Charlotte Pascal (1749‚Äì1821). Claude P√©rier was a fabric manufacturer from Grenoble who became a wealthy banker and one of the fifteen founding regents of the Bank of France. Joseph P√©rier was the ninth son of Claude P√©rier, and his twelfth child. One of his brothers was Casimir Pierre P√©rier, a banker in Paris who became prime minister of France. In 1795 Claude P√©rier obtained 27.5 deniers of the Anzin Mining Company during a financial reorganization. When he died in 1801 his shares were divided between his eight sons and two daughters. In 1805 Scipion P√©rier became director of the mining company, and Casimir P√©rier became assistant director. In 1809 Joseph P√©rier married Agla√© de Clavel de Kergoman (1790‚Äì1848) in Paris. Their children were Edmond (1811‚Äì76), Mathilde (1815‚Äì77), Laure (1816‚Äì27), Camille (1819‚Äì98), Octavie (1824‚Äì1904), Gabrielle (1828‚Äì77) and Arthur (1832‚Äì99). First French Empire In 1811 Joseph P√©rier was named auditor to the Conseil d'Etat (France), and in that role was placed in charge of the Ponts-et-Chauss√©es (Bridges & Roads). Also in 1811 he was sent as sub-prefect to Oldenburg. At the start of Napoleon's German campaign of 1813 he was attached to Pierre Antoine No√´l Bruno, comte Daru, Intendant General of the Grande Arm√©e. After the capture of Dresden and the entry of the French army into Silesia he was chosen as Intendant of the Crossen Circle, and later as Receiver-General of the Grande Arm√©e. He returned to France after the Battle of Leipzig, and was sent to Lille under Senator Jacques-Pierre Orillard de Villemanzy, extraordinary commissioner of the 16th military division. He did not return to Paris until after the Bourbon Restoration. Business career After the Bourbon Restoration, Joseph P√©rier was for some years receiver of finances of the 4th arrondissement of Paris, then retired to private life. In 1825 he became the partner of his brother Casimir P√©rier in the P√©rier fr√®res banking house of Paris, of which he later became the sole head. This bank had been created by Claude P√©rier in 1801. He was a regent of the Bank of France in the 11th seat from 1833 to his death. The Bank of France had in theory five regents chosen from the merchants and manufacturers and seven from the bankers, as well as three censors with an advisory role selected from the Paris merchants. In practice, the distinctions were blurred, since the merchants and manufacturers often engaged in banking, while P√©rier and others designated as \\"bankers\\" were primarily industrialists. A biographer said of him, \\"He is a man endowed with a precious quality, he counts a bag of a thousand francs faster than one of the boys of the Bank; so he is a regent!\\". Grenoble was one of the first cities to obtain a branch of the Bank of France, in 1840, due to the combined efforts of Alphonse and Joseph P√©rier. Chauffour mine at Anzin around 1840 When Scipion P√©rier died in 1821, Casimir P√©rier became director of the Anzin mines and Joseph P√©rier became assistant director. Joseph became director after Casimir died in 1832, and Casimir's son Auguste became assistant director. The P√©riers held a large block of shares in the company, and their bank managed the company's finances, including investments, changes in shoreholdings and loans to shareholders. The machine shops of Jacques P√©rier at Chaillot supplied steam engines and equipment for mining from 1818. Joseph P√©rier was concerned that productivity might suffer if the mines supervisory staff became too close to the workers. In 1826 he asked the general agent of the Anzin company \\"to arrange a kind of police that would inform him if the director, the under-director and the master foremen were doing their job.\\" The census of 1842 shows that P√©rier may have been the most wealthy property-owner in France, paying 56,503 francs, mostly for the Anzin mines . The Joseph P√©rier mine was opened in 1841, and reached coal at . By 1867 it had reached a depth of . Joseph succeeded Casimir P√©rier as a member of the Paris Chamber of Commerce and participated in the Society for the Encouragement of National Industry. The Association pour la d√©fense du Travail national was formed to oppose the lowering of tariffs. In 1845 it was joined by the committee of metallurgists. The council included Antoine Odier (President), Auguste Mimerel (Vice-President), Joseph P√©rier (Treasurer) and Louis-Martin Lebeuf (Secretary). Members included Henri Barbet, L√©on Talabot and Eug√®ne Schneider. Political career During the July Revolution of 1830 Joseph P√©rier played a leading role in quieting a crowd that was on the point of attacking some disarmed soldiers who had taken refuge in the Foreign Ministry. He was a member of the General Council of the Seine department. In 1832, the General Council of the Seine department appointed him member of the commission charged with examining various projects of the entrep√¥t r√©el (public warehouse) in Paris. On 7 June 1832 he was appointed a member of the Superior Council of Commerce. During the July Monarchy Joseph P√©rier was elected on 15 November 1832 as deputy for √âpernay, the 4th district of the Marne department, as a member of the conservative majority. He replaced Joseph Dominique, baron Louis, who had chosen to run for another district. He was reelected on 21 June 1834. He supported Fran√ßois Guizot in his opposition to the ministry of Louis-Mathieu Mol√©. Joseph P√©rier was reelected on 4 November 1837 and 2 March 1839, still with the government majority. He was reelected on 9 July 1842, sitting with the constitutional opposition, and reelected on 1 August 1846. He left office on 24 February 1848 when the chamber of deputies was dissolved with the French Revolution of 1848. After leaving office Joseph P√©rier was appointed vice-president of the central committee of primary education. He was in turn supervisor of the Caisse d'Amortissement and of the Depots et Consignations. Joseph P√©rier was named censor of the Soci√©t√© G√©n√©rale in 1864, and was asked to join the board in January 1868. He died on 18 December 1868 in Paris.

In 1909, Buchanan Steamers ordered a passenger steamer from Glasgow shipbuilders A. & J. Inglis. While Inglis sub- contracted the construction of the hull to Napier and Miller, they built and installed the engine and boiler for the ship themselves. She was launched on 14 April 1910 and entered service that summer, however on her first regular trip from Glasgow to Rothesay she listed heavily to port almost submerging the port paddle wheel and lifting the starboard wheel almost clear of the water. After repeating the same list on two or three subsequent journeys she was withdrawn from service, the design flaw was remedied by extensively re- building her hull bottom to give it a wider shape, and she was then returned to service in 1911. Like other Clyde steamers, in 1917, she was requisitioned by the Admiralty to serve as a minesweeper during the first World War, based out of Grimsby. Before entering Naval service she was modified, with the most significant change being to bring her bridge forward in front of her funnel. When Eagle III returned to the Clyde in 1919 her owners had merged with a competitor to form Williamson-Buchanan Steamers and she resumed regular sailings from Glasgow to Rothesay and Loch Striven. A decade and a half later, in 1935, Eagle and the rest of the Williamson-Buchanan fleet passed into the ownership of the Caledonian Steam Packet Company. With the outbreak of the second world war, in October 1939, she and other Clyde steamers like the PS Waverley were requisitioned again by the Admiralty for minesweeping duties. Renamed HMS Oriole to avoid confusion with the pre-existing ship called , she was modified again for war service with her main saloon being reduced in size to allow the installation of minesweeping gear at her stern, and an anti- aircraft gun being installed on her foredeck. In 1940 Oriole and the other active members of her minesweeper flotilla were ordered away from their regular duties patrolling the coast from their base at Harwich to take part in the Dunkirk evacuation. Arriving at La Panne beach, seeing the difficulty troops were having getting from the shallow beach to the ships, the captain of the Oriole Lieutenant E. L. Davies decided to beach the ship. This allowed the Oriole to act as a temporary pier speeding up the process of getting troops onto other ships and smaller boats. The Oriole stayed beached for ten hours open to attack from enemy positions on the beach and from the air, but left at dusk as the tide rose lifting her off the beach, returning to Harwich relatively unscathed. She made four more trips, and was finally credited with landing 2587 troops. In recognition of his actions, Lieutenant Davies was awarded the Distinguished Service Cross. After the war, Eagle returned to the Clyde but due to the cost of renovating her for a return to passenger service it was decided to scrap her and she was broken up in 1946 at the Smith & Houston yard in Port Glasgow.

Early life  Frederick Dent Ray was born in Southwark, London, England on June 20, 1879. He was the son of Charles Adolphus Hopson Ray (1847-1913) and Sarah Newport (1848-1919). In 1908, he was married in Berkshire to Annie Beatrice Burt (b.1855) and they remained childless.  Aboard Titanic  Aged 32, Ray boarded the RMS Titanic on April 10, 1912 as a first-class saloon steward for a monthly wage of ¬£3 15c after being redirected from the ship RMS Olympic. On Sunday 14, 1912 his shift ended in 9 pm and he went to room 3 on E-deck where he slept with 27 others. Awaken by the collision, he first thought it was a problem in the engine room, and began to drift back to sleep when 2 stewards arrived to tell people to prepare and go to the lifeboats. After assisting recalcitrant passengers into Lifeboats 9 and 11, Mr. Ray boarded the half-full Lifeboat 13. As the boat was lowered into the water, a wrapped infant was tossed down to Ray, who caught the child and brought it to safety. Ray survived the sinking and made it to the ship RMS Carpathia. He returned home to his wife, who was in North Wales for recuperation from ill health.  Later life  Frederick's wife Anna died in 1952. He was remarried a few months later to Rose Mary Ray, n√©e Lawrence (b. 4 December 1890). They spent some time in Maidstone, Kent, before settling in Billericay, Wessex, where he would spend the rest of his life.  Death  Frederick died in Basildon Hospital on 15 January 1977 following complications from fracturing his hip and was later cremated. Aged 97 years, 6 months and 26 days, he became the longest living among the surviving crew and his death left only two remaining crewmen, Frank Prentice and Sidney Daniels.

At this now collapsed deep ancient karst cavity remarkably well preserved Neanderthal fossils were recovered, that might be skeletal remains of deliberate burials. According to the current excavation team at the site, the correct name of the location is \\"Regourdou\\". \\"Le R√©gourdou\\" is considered a misnomer and should be avoided. History The site of Regourdou was discovered by chance in 1954 by its owner, Roger Constant. He had seen water being swallowed through a hole into the ground of his farmyard and chose to enlarge it in the hope of discovering another entry to the nearby cave of Lascaux. This cave complex had been discovered in September 1940, after a storm had uprooted a tree that lay above the entrance, thereby causing the collapse of parts of its vault, opening the current artificial entrance. Constant, having noticed a similar collapse in front of his house, considered the event to be related to the Lascaux cave. He started to dig on his own without official approval, found numerous stone tools and on 22 September 1957, he excavated a Neanderthal mandible. Constant immediately contacted Fran√ßois Bordes, director of the Aquitaine prehistoric antiquities. Bernard Vandermeersch and Eug√®ne Bonifay undertook official excavations from 1961 to 1964 and, among Mousterian artefacts, such as Quina scrapers discovered underneath an stone slab, what was interpreted as a Neanderthal burial and a brown bear burial. However, like with all other Neanderthal alleged burials, this has been vehemently questioned among experts. Renewed excavations in 2008 and 2011 lead to the discovery of many more fossils, like the pelvic remains of Le Regourdou.  Site  The collapsed cavity Apart from a Neanderthal skeleton discovered in 1957, excavator Eug√®ne Bonifay found a large number of brown bear bones, several pits and stone platforms that contained bear bones. These were interpreted as evidence of a Middle Palaeolithic bear cult.Bonifay, E. (1965) - ¬´ Un ensemble rituel moust√©rien √† la grotte du R√©gourdou (Montignac, Dordogne) ¬ª, in : Actes du IV√®me Congr√®s de l'UISPP, Rome, vol. II, pp. 136-140.Pastoureau, M., L'Ours. Histoire d'un roi d√©chu, √âditions du Seuil, ‚Äì . This interpretation, however, was seriously debated given that repeated occupation of the cave by bears followed natural taphonomic phenomena, that reasonably explain the large number of bones.Cavanhi√©, N. (2007) - √âtude arch√©ozoologique et taphonomique des grands carnivores du site pal√©olithique moyen de R√©gourdou (Montignac, Dordogne), Universit√© de Toulouse II le Mirail, M√©moire de Master 2. The first Neanderthal (Regourdou 1), found at the site is a young adult, that initially preserved the mandible, part of the upper limbs and the sternum. Regourdou 1 has been interpreted as an intentional burial. However, it is difficult to reconcile this with the fact that it has no head and no lower limbs. According to a 2008 publication a great number of skeletal elements were discovered, all in remarkably good condition. These are the right and left coxal, the right femur, the left tibia, the right patella, the left fibula, the right navicular, the bones of the hands and the posterior arch of the lumbar vertebra. Regourdou 1 is often used for Neanderthal comparison studies, as it is the most robust Neanderthal skeleton ever found. Chronostratigraphic comparison to other sites and biostratigraphy suggest an age of Oxygen Isotope Stage 5 or early Oxygen Isotope Stage 4 (c. 70,000 years BP) for the Mousterian sediment, that contains the burial. A second individual (Regourdou 2) may be represented by one or more foot bones. Shaft cave The shaft cave is the second site that Roger Constant explored. He started digging there in 1970, a few metres from the main site. He used a crane and wagons to extract dirt from the earth down to a depth of 35 metres. He dug there all his life, hoping to reach the cave of Lascaux.

The historian Amy Louise Wood argues that the cultural power of lynching, and of white supremacy, \\"rested on spectacle...which produced and disseminated images of white power and black degradation, of white unity and black criminality, that served to instill and perpetuate a sense of racial supremacy in their white spectators.\\" An effervescence of lynchings occurred throughout the United States from the Civil War through the 1940s. In 1919, the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP) published a report on incidents of lynchings in the United States. The NAACP report found that one-hundred and fourteen \\"colored\\" persons were lynched in 1893; down from one-hundred and fifty-five lynchings the previous year (1892), though still one of the highest years of reported lynchings on record.  Lynching  On the afternoon of 2 June 1893, Samuel J. Bush was taken by train to Decatur, Illinois and imprisoned for the alleged assault of Minnie Cameron Vest. Upon his imprisonment, Samuel J. Bush hired Wilson B. Woodford, the only black lawyer in town, to represent him at various pre-trial hearings and, short of any plea deal, at his trial. On Saturday, 3 June 1893 a headline on the front page of the Chicago Daily Tribune read: \\"Lynching Threatened at Decatur: Mob Expected from Mount Zion to Hang the Negro, Sam J. Bush.\\" Despite the clamor of an impending lynching, no attempt was made to move Samuel J. Bush, or to disperse the large crowd assembled across the street from the jail. While in prison, Samuel J. Bush penned letters to his sisters, and to a cousin, Louis Collins, which were published in the Decatur Daily Republican. Samuel J. Bush wrote: \\"Now is the time of need ... Send the money to this Lawyer & he will clear me, if not I expect to be Linched.\\" By 6pm, a crowd of near five hundred people had assembled near the jailhouse. Despite the rain, the number ballooned to one-thousand by early morning; a nearby salon and tobacco store remained open all night. Around 2am, a group of Mount Zion vigilantes stormed the Macon County jail. Having been refused entry, the group led by Charles B. Britton, William Vest, and Thomas Atterbury, smashed down the jail door. Earlier that day, Deputy Sheriff Henry Midkiff locked twelve guards in the cellblock and hired four officers to supplement his force; Midkiff refused to surrender the jailhouse keys to the Mount Zion mob. William W. Mason, the Chief of Police, appealed to the mob, asking they see reason and respect the law. His pleas fell on deaf ears: \\"he was grabbed, kicked in the stomach, and thrown down the stairs.\\" The guards in the cellblock made no efforts to resist the white mob. The prisoner, Samuel J. Bush, attempted to conceal himself inside a mattress, but was found, dragged naked outside, and brought to a telephone pole at the corner of Wood and Water streets, in front of the Brunswick hotel. William Vest forced Samuel J. Bush's head through a noose and asked if he had any last words. Bush tried to speak, but the rope was too tight; Vest loosened the noose and Samuel J. Bush said he wanted to pray. He took to his knees and addressed the mob, proclaiming his innocence and then told the assembled mob that he \\"hoped to see them again in heaven.\\" Bush then asked God to \\"mercifully receive his soul in the land beyond trouble.\\" On Sunday morning, 4 June 1893, all three Decatur newspapers carried \\"An Open Letter to Decatur's Colored Citizens\\" in which Wilson B. Woodford condemned \\"the lawless mob of maddened men\\" who had murdered Samuel J. Bush. Woodford argued that the lynching was not an isolated incident, but rather part of the dominant strategy of racial repression. Denouncing the \\"daily occurrences of such depredations upon the race throughout the country,\\" Woodford reminded blacks of \\"the littleness in which the lives and property of the race are held.\\" Woodford proposed that they \\"devise ways and means to assist in bringing to justice . . . the cowardly mob of human fiends,\\" at the \\"indignation meeting.\\" Quoting the Scottish poet Robert Burns, Woodford concluded: \\"Let every negro with one spark of love for his race and its future, who believe 'a man's a man for all that and a' that,' and who, above all, loves its country and its laws,\\" attend the Indignation Meeting.  Reaction & aftermath  On Monday, 5 June 1893, one-hundred and fifty men answered Wilson B. Woodward's clarion call against the dangers of lynching and the necessity for black mobilization. Governor John P. Altgeld, in a proclamation published in the Chicago Daily Tribune on 4 June 1893, forcefully condemned the lynching of Samuel J. Bush, writing: \\"I hereby denounce this cowardly and diabolical act as not only a murder under our laws, but as a disgrace to our civilization and a blot upon the fair fame [sic] of our state. The prisoner was accused of the crime of rape, but stoutly protested his innocence. He was already in the custody of the law, and no matter with what crime he was charged, and no matter whether he was guilty or innocent, he was entitled to a trial, a fair trial according to law. It must never be said that the laws of our great and proud State do not afford protection to all without regard to color or condition. I therefore call upon all officers of the law and especially of Macon County, as well as on all good citizens who respect law and cherish the honor of this State, to do all in their power to bring the leaders of this great crime to justice. I hereby offer a reward of two hundred dollars ($200) each for the apprehension and conviction of every man who helped to break the doors of the jail, overpower the officers, and drag out the prisoner, or who assisted in killing him.\\" Mr. Miles, the State's Attorney of Macon County, stated: \\"[we will] at once commence vigorous prosecutions against those who participated in the lynching of the prisoner Bush...The Officers were not to blame at all, as they were overpowered by the mob, who were strong numerically and well equipped with arms.\\" Decatur Marshall and Chief of Police William W. Mason, was cited as attempting to prevent the lynching. However, his Deputy Sheriff, Henry Midkiff's, efforts were not mentioned by the Decatur Daily Review. In the spring of 2016, students at Mount Zion High School created an exhibit on the Jim Crow era in the basement of the African-American Genealogical Society and Museum, located in Decatur. In remembrance of the Jim Crow era, students crafted an exhibit on lynchings, including the first lynching in Macon County.

The Statement expresses support for an opposite-sex definition of marriage, for faithfulness within marriage, for chastity outside marriage, and for a link between biological sex and \\"self-conception as male and female.\\" The Statement sets forth the signatories' opposition to LGBT sexuality, same-sex marriage, polygamy, polyamory, adultery, and fornication. It was criticized by egalitarian Christians and LGBT campaigners, as well as by several conservative religious figures. History The statement was drafted in late August 2017, during the annual conference of the Ethics and Religious Liberty Commission of the Southern Baptist Convention, at the Gaylord Opryland Resort & Convention Center in Nashville, Tennessee. The statement was published online on August 29, 2017. It was signed by more than 150 evangelical Christian leaders. Contents The Statement includes a preamble and 14 articles. The opening paragraph reads, \\"Evangelical Christians at the dawn of the twenty-first century find themselves living in a period of historic transition. As Western culture has become increasingly post-Christian, it has embarked upon a massive revision of what it means to be a human being.\\" The Statement presents a complementarian view of gender and a traditionalist view of sexuality. The Nashville Statement: :* Affirms that God designed marriage as a lifelong union between male and female, and that marriage \\"is meant to signify the covenant love between Christ and his bride the church\\"; :* Denies that differences between men and women render the sexes \\"unequal in dignity or worth\\"; :* Denies \\"that adopting a homosexual or transgender self-conception is consistent with God's holy purposes in creation and redemption.\\"(art. VII b) :* Denies \\"that the approval of homosexual immorality or transgenderism is a matter of moral indifference about which otherwise faithful Christians should agree to disagree.\\"(art.

Dutch version  SGP leader Kees van der Staaij is considered the Statement's most prominent supporter. The Dutch municipality of Wormerland flies the rainbow flag on January 9, 2019, in solidarity with the LGBT community after the publication of the Dutch version of the Nashville Statement. On January 4, 2019, a Dutch version of the Nashville Statement was published; its publication subsequently drew much controversy. It was signed by 200 leaders from the Netherlands' orthodox-Protestant communities (including Member of Parliament and Reformed Political Party leader Kees van der Staaij). Its structure and content were very similar to the original statement, but a 'pastoral chapter' had been added, stressing that LGBT individuals were entitled to pastoral care, and recognizing that in the past religious communities had failed to show sufficient compassion towards them. The Dutch statement received some support in orthodox Protestant circles (although even there too, objections were raised), but was widely criticized by most religious leaders, politicians and human rights organizations. It was also widely discussed in the Dutch media. The Public Prosecution Service indicated it would evaluate whether the publication was punishable under criminal law. In the days following the publication, numerous town halls, churches and universities throughout the Netherlands flew the rainbow flag in a show of solidarity with the LGBT community.

Malthus wrote Principles of Political Economy as a rebuttal to David Ricardo's On the Principles of Political Economy and Taxation. While the main focus of their work is to explain economic depressions in Europe and the reasons why they occur, Malthus uses his scholarship to explore price determination and the value of goods.  Summary of Principles of Political Economy  In Principles of Political Economy, Malthus' rebuts David Ricardo's work, particularly rejecting idea developed by Jean Baptiste Say that theorizes that supply generates its own demand, known as Say's Law. Say's Law emphasizes the idea that there is no tendency towards a depression because as supply increases, people will naturally demand more. Say believes that an overflow of supply of certain goods will trigger a lack of supply of another type of good. This will create a new balance in the economy. Malthus claims that supply does not generate its own demand and that oversupply can lead the economy to recession. Malthus understands production and demand to exist independent of each other. Both are determined by their own factors. From this Malthus generates the idea of \\"effective demand,\\" which later becomes popular in Keynesian economics. \\"Effective demand\\" iterates that consumers purchase more or less of a good depending on the price a firm charges for it. Malthus' idea suggests that the amount of goods supplied may be a result of the demand. Furthermore, Malthus argues that the economy tends to move towards recessions because productivity often grows more quickly than demand. Malthus suggests increasing government spending and private investment on luxuries to cure recessions. This idea firmly goes against the notion that Ricardo and Say hold that the economy will fix itself through demand.  Second edition  A second edition of Malthus' Principles of Political Economy was published in 1836. After the first version's publication, Adam Smith develops the idea that an object's inherent value is related to the labor that went into its creation. Additionally, Smith creates the notion that a good's price also moves in the direction of the price of other commodities. After careful contemplation, Malthus adopts Smith's theory of value. This new thought process goes against his previous belief that there is no accurate way to measure an object's value. Although this new conclusion would only call for revision of the sixth and seventh sections of his second chapter, Malthus uses this new revelation as an excuse to re-examine his whole book. For the most part, his additions simply clarify sections and omit ideas more clear in other sections. He does not alter any of his main ideas in his book. Malthus died before he was able to publish the new edition, but it is believed he made all his intended alterations. His work was later collected and published in 1836.  Responses and critiques of his work  Malthus' book received mixed feedback from other economists of the time. Twentieth century British economist John Maynard Keynes is considered an admirer of Malthus' work. In fact, he is even quoted in saying, ‚ÄúIf only Malthus, instead of Ricardo, had been the parent stem from which nineteenth- century economics proceeded, what a much wiser and richer place the world would be today!‚Äù Many of Keynes' ideas that became the basis of Keynesian economics are influenced by Principles of Political Economy. Although Malthus fails to connect long-run supply and demand curve as setting the natural price of an item, Malthus is one of the first to describe the natural price of an item. Keynes utilizes this idea and also draws on Malthus' concept of government spending during times of economic crisis. Keynes cites this chapter of Malthus' book as \\"a masterly exposition of the conditions which determine the optimum of saving in the actual economic system in which we live.\\" However, Keynes also critiques Thomas Malthus. He faults Malthus' work for being \\"unable to explain clearly (apart from an appeal to the facts of common observation) how and why effective demand could be deficient or excessive.\\" John Stuart Mill, a nineteenth-century British economist, also criticizes Malthus' Principles of Political Economy. He calls Malthus' work \\"a more mischievous doctrine,\\" and mocks Malthus for believing that government intervention is an appropriate solution to recessions. Mill takes the approach that the government is too corrupt and that a moral individual would not accept its help. Furthermore, he emphasizes that Say's Law is accurate and justified in economic studies. William Blake, another economist of the time, takes the opposite opinion of Mill. Blake applauds Malthus' idea of government expenditure in order to stimulate the economy. Without Malthus' suggested government intervention, Blake believes the economy would remain stuck in a depression.  Impact  Malthus' work did not spark many economic debates at the time of its publication. In fact, many denied Malthus' ideas on recessions. Say's Law remained the more commonly accepted theory at the time due to its popularity. Malthus' book does not attract much attention until the Great Depression occurs and it becomes evident that depressions are real. After this, economists such as John Maynard Keynes begin to look more deeply into Malthus' ideas and utilize them in their own work.

By Guillaume Coustou the Younger. From Paris, France. The Victoria and Albert Museum, London Marguerite Lecomte, sometimes Le Comte, n√©e Josset (April 15, 1717 ‚Äì January 22, 1800) was a French amateur engraver and pastel artist.  Biography  Marguerite Josset, born on 15 April 1717 in Paris, was the daughter of Denis Josset and Marguerite Noiseux, both butchers. She was baptised on 18 April 1717 at Saint- Nicolas-des-Champs (3rd arrondissement). Although nothing is known about her childhood, at 18 years old, she married Jacques Roger Lecomte, a 33-year-old prosecutor at the Grand Ch√¢telet. Born 27 February 1707 at Sainte-Croix parish, Mantes-la-Jolie, he was the son of Guillaume Lecomte, a drapery merchant, and Catherine Genevi√®ve Boudet. Jacques Roger's mother opposed their marriage and was required to make him a ‚Äúrespectful summons‚Äù (an act by which, according to French legislation still in force at the beginning of the twentieth century, a child of legal age up to a certain age required their parents to give their consent to the marriage) in front of the same lawyer, so that she would give her consent. The couple settled at the home of Jacques Lecomte ‚Äì Saint-Honor√© cloister in Paris (now Rue Saint-Honor√©, near the Palais-Royal). Their son, Louis Victoire, was born 24 December 1739 in Paris, and was baptised at the Church of Saint-Eustache (Paris). Their parents lived on rue des Vieilles-√âtuves (now Rue Sauval in the 1st arrondissement). In February 1746, at a business meeting between Jacques Lecomte and Claude Watelet, poet and member of the French Academy, Watelet met Marguerite Lecomte. Watelet gave aquatint lessons to Marguerite Lecomte, who was a pastel artist and who was the same age as him. They fell in love and began a relationship that lasted 40 years. This seems to have been a peaceful change in their relationship and they formed a m√©nage √† trois with Jacques Lecomte.  Marguerite Lecomte and the Moulin-Joly  The trio moved to the Moulin-Joly in Colombes. The Lecomtes had bought the property on 11 August 1750 through Antoine Quinquet, a Parisian lawyer, but it was Claude Watelet who paid for the purchase and the major repairs. Very shortly, an entourage of artists settled at Moulin-Joly, soon followed by a crowd of uninvited people.  The journey to Italy  Marguerite accompanied Claude Watelet on his journey to Italy from 1763-1764 while Jacques Lecomte, who was still a prosecutor at the Grand Chatelet, stayed in Paris. They left in September 1763, along with Father Francois Copette, a friend and Watelet's former private tutor. In Italy, Marguerite began a friendship with Princess Borghese (n√©e Agnese Colonna, 1702-1780) and Cardinal Alexandre Albani (1692-1779). In 1764, she did a portrait of the latter. She was appointed member of the Academies of Rome, Florence, Parma and Bologna. According to Watelet, she had ‚Äúthe fortunate talent of pleasing without having to think about it/A good heart, a sense of right and the gift of being a friend/An honest and free spirit embellishing those traits/Finally, the grace to united reason/Le Comte, it is for you that nature has made/And that art cannot render, in engraving your portrait.‚Äù Some claimed, however, that she had been accepted to these academies thanks only to Watelet's works which she had simply signed. The journey was described by Louis Subleyras in his ‚ÄúNella venuta in Roma di madama Le Comte e dei signori Watelet e Copette‚Äù. This work notably included illustrations by Hubert Robert and Franz Edmund Weirotter who were residents at the Moulin-Joly. The latter most notably engraved \\"Mme Le Comte et M. Watelet admirent l'Apollon du Vatican\\" et \\"Mme Le Comte et M. Watelet arrivent √† Rome accompagn√©s de Minerve, du Temps et de l'Amour\\". Hubert Robert gave a series of twelve pieces to Marguerite Lecomte: ‚ÄúLes Soir√©es de Rome‚Äù (1763-1764) which combined a pleasant composition with a picturesque execution.  The butterflies  On her return from Italy in 1765, Marguerite Lecomte printed ‚ÄúSuite de papillons‚Äù, a series of 25 butterflies on 12 boards. She then painted them with pastel before offering them to her friends. On 20 June 2006, a complete copy of her work (17 cm x 22 cm), bound in calf skin, with a decorated golden spine and a red cover, was sold for 10 000 ‚Ç¨. Apart from this, there is only one other known copy, which resides in the Biblioth√®que nationale. Watelet was given an apartment at the Louvre by the King, where the trio moved in. They still kept the Moulin-Joly as a country residence where they hosted Louis XVI and Marie-Antoinette of Austria in 1774.  The end of a great love  On 20 July 1785, Watelet offered Marguerite a superb manuscript collection of 50 fables, composed by himself and written by Fyot le Jeune, a well-known calligrapher of the period. This was to be is last gift. After 40 years of living together, Claude Watelet died on January 12, 1786 at the Louvre, at 11pm, in the pavilion of the colonnade, at the left of the courtyard. Shortly after, Jacques and Marguerite sold the Moulin-Joly. Jacques Roger died on January 2, 1789, at the Louvre. Marguerite died on January 22, 1800, in Paris, rue Neuve Saint-Paul (now Rue Charles V, in the 4th arrondissement). Upon Watelet's death her husband requested the return of a number of portraits of his wife, including a marble bust, an oil painting, and two pastels. Some sources have claimed that she herself was a pastel artists, but others discount this. Lecomte died in Paris.Profile at the Dictionary of Pastellists Before 1800.

Roger Allam and John Jencks at the 2016 Dinard British Film Festival Plot Edward \\"Ted\\" Wallace (Roger Allam) is an aging, jaded writer and former poet. Having not written a poem since 1987, he is stuck writing reviews of small- time plays, wallowing in his bath, and compulsively drinking. After a dispute at a poorly performed play leads to him being fired from his position as a critic, Ted runs into his goddaughter Jane, who lavishly pays him to investigate a series of miracles occurring at her family's manor in light of her unexplained apparent recovery from leukaemia. At the manor, owned by his former friend Lord Michael Logan, Ted becomes acquainted with his sixteen- year-old godson, David, who displays an unusual amount of fascination with both sex and nature. Also at the manor is David's brother Simon, Michael's angina-afflicted friend Oliver, who hopes to obtain funding for his upcoming play, and Valerie Richmond, a wealthy Frenchwoman who seeks to purchase one of the manor's horses, Lilac, for her socially awkward daughter Clara, who is accompanying her. For the next few days, Ted becomes acquainted with the manor's residents, encountering conflict between his abrasive attitude and the others' perky optimism, while David converses with Ted about both his interests and his ambitions of becoming a fellow poet. One day, Lilac mysteriously falls ill of what appears to be ragwort poisoning, something which strikes Michael and Simon as odd since ragwort doesn't grow in the area. While Michael and company despair over the possibility of having to euthanise Lilac, Ted learns from various members of his godfamily that the miracles he was sent to investigate were performed by David himself. According to this account, David had healed his mother from a severe asthma attack simply by touching her when Simon's CPR seemed ineffective, and cured Jane's leukemia over the course of a few days through the same method. The following day, David appears to perform more miracles by curing Lilac's ragwort poisoning and Oliver's angina, leading Valerie to pursue him in hopes of improving Clara's appearance. David, however, has gone missing, leading to a widespread search across the manor's grounds. Ted eventually sights David and Clara running into the woods afterwards and gives chase, only to find Clara performing fellatio on David. A bewildered Ted simply chooses to observe them as an ejaculating David tries to coerce Clara into swallowing his semen; Simon then discovers the pair and interrupts them, leading a panicked Clara to bite David's penis. After Simon takes Clara back to the manor, Ted comes out of hiding and drives a bleeding David to the hospital. On the way back, David explains to Ted that he believes his healing powers come from his moral purity and a spiritual connection with nature, channelled though his hands and especially his bodily fluids; Ted rebukes all of this as blind delusion, leading a heartbroken David to abandon him. Once Ted returns to the manor, he is confronted by Michael's ex-fianc√©e Rebecca, who bears a grudge against Ted for him publicly humiliating Michael on live television many years prior; Rebecca insults Ted and rebukes him for his interventions in Michael's family's life, leaving Ted to sulk alone in his room for the rest of the night. However, he comes to an unexpected realisation when he accidentally knocks over and smashes his whisky bottle. The following evening, the manor's residents agree to publicly announce David's miraculous healing abilities, only for Ted to refute all of them as mere coincidence. Ted explains that the breaking of his whisky bottle led him to realise that Lilac's poisoning was actually a hangover from drinking the contents of a bottle he dropped in an outdoor bucket from earlier in the film, that Simon's CPR had proved effective in rescuing his mother during her asthma attack, and that Jane's recovery from leukemia was actually a natural quieting of its symptoms. Ted further reveals David's confidence in his semen's abilities, and that this led him to have morally dubious sex with Jane, Lilac, and Oliver. Ted's acidic lecture both disgusts and angers the residents of the manor and leads an eavesdropping David to attempt suicide by burying himself alive. However, the others discover David's absence and rescue him, before Ted is forced to deliver the unfortunate news that Jane's leukemia has killed her. Some time passes, and the group has moved on from the events of that night. At Jane's funeral, David explains to Ted that his new \\"normal\\" life is one of hard work, and Ted's experiences from the summer at Michael's manor have reignited his sense of wonder; having written five new poems for the first time in nearly 30 years and preparing to write a sixth, a solitary Ted ushers a toast \\"to miracles.\\" Cast References External links 2017 films Films based on British novels Films about poets British films British comedy films Zoophilia in culture ","title":"The Hippopotamus (film)"},{"id":"55081129","text":"Wang Dongming (; born July 1961 in Anhui, China) is Research Director (Directeur de Recherche) at the French National Center for Scientific Research (Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique, CNRS).

He was elected Member of the Academia Europaea in 2017. Wang worked on algorithmic elimination theory, geometric reasoning and knowledge management, and applications of symbolic computation to qualitative analysis of differential equations. In 1993 he proposed an elimination method for triangular decomposition of polynomial systems, which has been referred to as Wang's method and compared with other three methods. Later on he introduced the concepts of regular systems and simple systems and devised algorithms for regular and simple triangular decompositions. He also developed a package, called Epsilon, which implements his methods. Wang popularized the use of methods and tools of computer algebra for symbolic analysis of stability and bifurcation of differential and biological systems. He constructed a class of cubic differential systems with six small-amplitude limit cycles and rediscovered the incompleteness of Kukles' center conditions of 1944, which stimulated the study of Kukles' system in hundred papers. Since 2004 he has been involved in research projects on geometric knowledge management and discovery.

It was assigned to the southern sector of the Soviet-German front, at first in 56th Army, and it would remain on this sector for the duration of the war. After assisting in the first liberation of Rostov-on-the-Don in late 1941, but in 1942 it retreated into the Caucasus region, and fought to hold the Axis forces from reaching the coast of the Black Sea. Following the retreat of the Germans and Romanians in the wake of their defeat at Stalingrad, the 353rd took part in the offensives that freed Ukraine in 1943 and 1944, winning a battle honor for the liberation of Dneprodzerzhinsk in October, 1943. In the summer of 1944 it participated in the offensive that finally drove Romania out of the Axis, and then advanced into the Balkan states. Shortly thereafter it was assigned to 37th Army, which was detached from the active army to garrison the southern Balkans, and the division remained on this quiet front for the duration of the war. Formation The division began forming on August 27, 1941, at Krasnodar in the North Caucasus Military District.Walter S. Dunn, Jr., Stalin's Keys to Victory, Stackpole Books, Mechanicsburg, PA, 2006, p. 79 Its order of battle was as follows: * 1145th Rifle Regiment * 1147th Rifle Regiment * 1149th Rifle Regiment * 902nd Artillery RegimentCharles C. Sharp, \\"Red Tide\\", Soviet Rifle Divisions Formed From June to December 1941, Soviet Order of Battle World War II, Vol. IX, Nafziger, 1996, p. 89 Col. Grigory Filippovich Panchenko was assigned to command of the division on the day it began forming, and he continued in command until May 7, 1942. The division was one of the first assigned to the 56th Army, which was itself forming east of Rostov, in Southern Front. It first went into battle in late November, taking part in the first liberation of Rostov, one of the key initial setbacks for the German invaders. In late December the division was transferred to 18th Army, in the same Front.Combat Composition of the Soviet Army, 1942, p. 12 Battle of the Caucasus On May 8, 1942, Kombrig Fyodor Samuilovich Kolchuk took command of the 353rd. As his pre-war rank suggests, this officer had been caught up and \\"repressed\\" during the Great Purge of the Red Army in 1937-38. Kolchuk would be promoted to the rank of Major General on November 17, and would hold this command until May 30, 1944. When the German summer offensive began in late June, the division was still in 18th Army of Southern Front. The attack on the southern sector began on July 7, and the 353rd was in the northern half of its Front's sector, in the first echelon along the east bank of the Mius River, alongside the 383rd and 395th Rifle Divisions, with only one division and the 64th Tank Brigade in reserve. The weight of the attack by German Army Group A soon forced Southern Front into a precarious retreat into the Caucasus Mountains. By July 25 the division had been reassigned to 12th Army and was helping to defend the 40km sector from Kiziterinka eastward to Belianin, between 20 and 50km southeast and east of Rostov, facing the III Panzer Corps. By August 1 it was back in 18th Army, as part of the Coastal Operational Group in North Caucasus Front.David M. Glantz, To the Gates of Stalingrad, University Press of Kansas, Lawrence, KS, 2009, pp. 112, 177-78, 401, 414 On September 23, the German 17th Army began an offensive (Operation Attika) through the high passes of the Caucasus mountains towards the Black Sea port of Tuapse. At this time the 353rd was back in 56th Army, which was part of the Black Sea Group of Forces. The attack made fairly slow progress through this difficult terrain, but by October 10 the division had been pushed back to the vicinity of the town of Anastaskevskaia, south of the enemy penetration. A renewal of the offensive on October 21 smashed the 408th Rifle Division and forced its remnants to break out and join the 353rd and 383rd Rifle Divisions; by this point 17th Army's leading troops were just 30km from their goal. The situation demanded a counterstrike, and at dawn on October 23 the division assaulted the defenses of the 101st J√§ger Division and Group Lanz south of Mount Semashkho. After difficult fighting, by day's end the 353rd had captured the mountain and encircled part of the j√§ger division's forces. The complex fighting in this region went on until early November until it was brought to a halt by attrition, exhaustion, and the onset of winter weather. By this time, the division was back again in 18th Army.Glantz, Armageddon in Stalingrad, University Press of Kansas, Lawrence, KS, 2009, pp. 562-63, 572-73, 606 Into Ukraine In March, 1943, after the retreat of the Axis forces from the Caucasus mountains, the 353rd was shifted to the 37th Army, still in North Caucasus Front, and then into the Reserve of the Supreme High Command in 46th Army. It would remain in this Army until August, 1944, in Southwestern Front until October, 1943, and then its successor, the 3rd Ukrainian Front.Sharp, \\"Red Tide\\", p. 90 It took part in the Donbass Strategic Offensive and the following Battle of the Dniepr, and earned a battle honor for its part in the liberation of the west-bank city of Dneprodzerzhinsk: At this time the division was in the 6th Guards Rifle Corps,Combat Composition of the Soviet Army, 1943, p. 281 and was noted as being made up of about 40% Russians and 60% Uzbeks, Tajiks and Turkmens.Glantz, Colossus Reborn, University Press of Kansas, Lawrence, KS, 2007, p. 594 On February 26, 1944, the 353rd was decorated for its role in the liberation of the Ukrainian city of Kryvyi Rih with the Order of the Red Banner. During March, 6th Guards Corps left 46th Army, and the division was under direct Army command on April 1,Combat Composition of the Soviet Army, 1944, p. 109 serving as the Army's reserve. As it closed on the east bank of the Dniestr River in mid-April, the Army was ordered to attack the two German strongpoints of Chebruchi and Raskaetsy. The assault on the former collapsed almost immediately, but the attack by the 34th Rifle Corps, soon reinforced by the 353rd, in three days of heavy fighting, advanced 2 - 5km deep in an 8km wide sector south of Raskaetsy, threatening to envelop the town from the south. However, the German XXIX Army Corps reinforced the defenses at Chebruchi, allowing the 76th Infantry Division to shift most of its forces to its left wing and halt the Soviet advance. 46th Army played little subsequent role in the First Jassy-Kishinev Offensive,Glantz, Red Storm Over the Balkans, University Press of Kansas, Lawrence, KS, 2007, pp. 113, 157 but as of May 1 the 353rd was officially incorporated into 34th Corps, where it would remain into the postwar.Combat Composition of the Soviet Army, 1944, p. 139 At the end of May, General Kolchuk was reassigned to command of the 37th Rifle Corps, which he would hold for the duration. Col. Aleksey Ivanovich Melnikov took command of the division on June 1, but held it for less than three weeks before being replaced by Col. Pavel Ionovich Kuznetzov on June 19, who would continue at this post until November 8. Into the Balkans From May through most of August the division remained in much the same positions while the 2nd and 3rd Ukrainian Fronts prepared for a new offensive. 46th Army's front now ran from the western outskirts of Talmazy all the way to the Black Sea coast. In the last days before the assault, 34th Rifle Corps concentrated its 353rd and 394th Rifle Divisions in the bridgehead over the Dniestr at Purcari, while the 236th Rifle Division formed the Army's reserve. The offensive opened at dawn on August 20, and during that day the 353rd finally captured the stubborn strongpoint at Raskaetsy. Overall, 46th Army achieved all of its first-day objectives. On the second day the division led the advance of its Corps as the German Sixth and Romanian Third Armies were being split apart by the Front's advance. By the 23rd, 46th Army was in the process of encircling the Romanian forces, and the division had advanced as far as Plakhtiivka.Soviet General Staff, The Iasi-Kishinev Operation, ed. and trans. R.W. Harrison, Helion & Co., Ltd., Solihull, UK, 2017, pp. 83-84, 101, 107, 122 As the offensive continued, 34th Rifle Corps was temporarily transferred to 57th Army, before coming under direct command of 3rd Ukrainian Front from September to November as the advance into Romania and Hungary went on. On November 9 the division saw its final change of command with the appointment of Col. Yeremei Zakharovich Karamanov. In the same month the Corps was reassigned to 37th Army, and in December that Army became a separate army directly under command of the STAVKA, serving as a garrison for the southern Balkans for the duration of the war.Sharp, \\"Red Tide\\", p. 90 Postwar At the end of the war in Europe, the division carried the full title of 353rd Rifle, Dneprodzerzhinsk, Order of the Red Banner Division ().

Seaman was an active participant in the women's suffrage movement and worked tirelessly to see the change that she wanted in the United States. In 1995 Seaman died of breast cancer, however, her legacy lies within her novels, and efforts to increase public awareness of breast cancer and women's health. Early life Sylvia B. Seaman, originally known as Sylvia Bernstein, was born in Manhattan on the 8th of November in 1900. In 1915 Seaman marched in her first women's suffrage march, prompting heavy participation in women's activism from her teenage years forward. Soon after becoming involved in the women's rights movement, Seaman was arrested for wearing riding breeches in public. This act was seen as \\"unbecoming\\" of a lady and was not tolerated at this point in the twentieth century. Seaman was attending Cornell University when the 20th Amendment passed, where she gained the qualifications to teach High School English, which she did for several years following graduation. Also around that time she married William Seaman.\\"Sharing StoriesInspiring Change\\" Jewish Women's Archive. She went on to write articles for magazines and newspapers with her roommate, Frances Schwartz, under the pseudonym of Francis Sylvin. Seaman believed that she needed to publish under a male alias in order for her works to be taken more seriously. Life as an author and activist Outside of the articles they wrote together, Sylvia and Frances wrote two novels under the name Francis Sylvin, their 1943 novel Rusty Carrousel and their 1952 novel Miracle Father Rusty Carousel told the story of Stephanie Camill, a Cornell graduate working half-heartedly as a public school teacher. She craves love and marriage and the novel tells the story of her jumping from relationship to relationship unable to find a husband. With both Seaman and Schwartz being ex-school teachers themselves, the novel was able to give people a comprehensive view of what the New York City public school system was like. It shows how a teacher can be moved from school to school, and what hardships the system can place on a teacher. Their 1952 novel Miracle Father told the story of a couple producing a child through Artificial Insemination. When the novel was republished in 1968, it was retitled as Test- Tube Father. In 1955 Seaman underwent a radical mastectomy due to a mass found in her breast. This milestone in her life turned her to a path of education and awareness about breast cancer and its severity. In 1965, Seaman published a controversial novel called What Every Woman Should Know About Breast Cancer, in which she explains ways of how a radical mastectomy could be avoided. Seaman then devoted herself to educating other women on the importance of self-checks and mammograms for the rest of her career. In an interview with Irene Davall, a prominent feminist leader in the 1970s, Seaman stated, \\"It may be in time that they don't have to do many radicals, especially if mammograms should become more popular.\\" Davall, Irene, host. \\"Voices of Restless Women.\\" Irene Davall Papers, 1971‚Äì1987, performance by Sylvia S. Seaman, season 1, episode 8, 1974‚Äì1976. Ultimately, she believed strongly in women's activism and educating the public on women's health issues that were rarely talked about at the time. In addition to continuing to tell her story and educate the public about breast cancer, Seaman spoke out about several other controversial issues within the realm of women's health and sexuality. Often she spoke out about abortion and its importance, along with lesbianism and other sexual orientations that were highly avoided within the media. Seaman continued to interview on radio shows and for newspapers until she was in her late seventies, and continued to write articles in newspapers about newly controversial topics that came up within the women's rights movement. How to be a Jewish Grandmother was the last novel written by Seaman and was published in 1979. Meant to be lighter and more humorous, the novel was a collection of anecdotes and advice that described what it meant to be a woman, to be Jewish, and to be a grandmother with every topic being fair game for discussion. The topics ranged from her drinking habits, to daughter-in-laws, and even to vasectomies. It expressed the shift that America had undergone in her lifetime, how it was still changing and how bewildered she was by those changes.  Family  Sylvia Seaman wasn't the only activist in her family, most notably her Daughter-in-law Barbara Seaman was a large player in the women's health movement, and was the one who convinced her to write on her experience of having a mastectomy. Her son Gideon also worked with Barbara to write a book called Women and the Crisis in Sex Hormones Which talks about the dangers of Hormonal contraceptives for women and alternatives to hormonal contraceptives, along with menopause and how hormones relate to it.Natalie Shainess.

He attended Airdrie Academy, Glasgow University and a teacher training college where he qualified as a teacher with a Diploma of Education. Kellow graduated from Glasgow University as a Master of Arts with Honours in English and History. Additionally, Kellow also gained a Dipl√¥me d'√©tudes en langue fran√ßaise illustrating his improved linguistic skills after studying in France, Italy and Norway. Commencing his teaching career in 1904, Kellow taught at Calderbank Public School, then Airdrie Academy before being appointed Head of English at Allan Glen's School in Glasgow. In 1912, Kellow was offered a number of lucrative positions. He had to decide between an inspectorship with the Scottish Education Department, a position as a principal in India, and the headship of a private school in Australia. Kellow chose the latter. His fiance√© Mary Hope agreed to bring their scheduled wedding date forward so they could travel to Australia together after their wedding and settle in Rockhampton, Queensland, to take up the post as headmaster of the Rockhampton Boys Grammar School.

Kellow and his wife were officially welcomed to the school on 15 July 1912 at the annual reunion of past Rockhampton Grammar School students.Boys' Grammar School, The Morning Bulletin, 17 July 1912. During his tenure, Kellow developed considerable influence. It was Kellow who persuaded the trustees of the school in 1913 to allow Jack Fryer another year of study after he was unsuccessful in gaining a university scholarship. Fryer was eventually won the scholarship and was accepted into the University of Queensland. Kellow had interactions with a number of notable people, including British book publisher George G. Harrap who stayed in Rockhampton for two weeks at Kellow's invitation while Harrap was visiting Sydney in 1924.Harrap, George G., Some Memories, p.80-82, 1935. Accessed 29 August 2017. Kellow's works had been earlier published through Harrap's publishing house, although the two had met while Kellow was teaching at Allen Glen's School in Glasgow. Kellow's interactions with other dignitaries are recalled in Lorna McDonald's book about his life The Moving Mind, including Shakespearean actor Allan Wilkie, Queensland Governor Matthew Nathan, Governor-Generals Lord Munro Ferguson and Lord Forster, Japanese consul Iemasa Tokugawa, cricketer Don Bradman, swimmer Noel Ryan and local political figure Frank Forde. During their time in Rockhampton, the Kellow and his wife had three children Mary, Hope and Harry. Writing While attending the University of Glasgow, Kellow had the opportunity to learn from and be influenced by notable figures such as Sir Henry Jones who later described Kellow as a distinguished student due to the excellence of his written essays; and Walter Raleigh who said that he bore witness to Kellow's great ability and \\"unflagging energy of mind\\". Kellow's first work was A Practical Training in English, an English text book Kellow had written in 1909 using his training in literary appreciation.Record: A practical training in English, National Library of Australia catalogue. Accessed 29 August 2017. It was described by the secretary of the English Association as the best English text book of its kind they had ever seen. Following the completion of A Practical Training in English, Kellow was invited by the general editor of George G. Harrap and Co.'s \\"Poetry and Life\\" series to critique the works of Scotland's Robert Burns. As a result, Burns and his Poetry was published in 1911.Record: Burns and his poetry, National Library of Australia catalogue. Accessed 29 August 2017. Burns and his Poetry was quickly followed by Kellow's anthology A Treasury of Scottish Verse published in 1912, which was a collection of poems from the 14th to the 19th centuries which Kellow analysed.Record: A Treasury of Scottish verse, selected by H. A. Kellow, National Library of Australia catalogue. Accessed 29 August 2017. The preface to A Treasury of Scottish Verse was written in the Bay of Biscay while Kellow and his wife were en route to Australia. After a 15-year break from writing, Kellow seemed to have his interest in poetry and literature re-ignited. In his 1981 biography, The Moving Mind, historian Lorna McDonald suggests it may have been due to a combination of three events of 1924 consisting of Jeremiah Joseph Stable publishing The Bond of Poetry, Nettie Palmer publishing Modern Australian Literature and the visit from George Harrap which likely would have led to discussions about literature potentially planting the idea for Kellow to publish another work. Whatever the reason behind it, Kellow finally published what was arguably his best known work, Queensland Poets in 1930. Queensland Poets was, as the title suggests, a detailed analysis of the work of Queensland poets which received favourable reviews from newspaper critics.Poetry in the North, The Age, 27 September 1930.

After living at Darlinghurst, Mary bought a house in Eastwood in 1950. She died in 1972. After her cremation, her ashes were brought back to Rockhampton where they were interred in her husband's grave at the North Rockhampton Cemetery. Even after moving with her mother to Sydney, Kellow's daughter Mary continued to have an interest in the Rockhampton Grammar School, presenting the Mary Kellow Cup at the school's sports carnivals, and presenting the Mary Kellow Champion of Champions Cup at the Rockhampton Eisteddfod. While living in Sydney, she enjoyed partaking in artistic activities particularly painting and music. She was an invited guest to the launch of her father's biography in Rockhampton in 1981 and had expressed her interest in returning to the city following her last visit in 1965. However, she died suddenly on 10 February 1981 after being involved in a minor car accident several days earlier. Her brother Harry claimed she had encountered an aggressive insurance assessor who had caused Mary considerable distress. Due to her exceptional linguistic skills, Kellow's daughter Hope received a glowing recommendation in 1941 from Frank Forde for a wartime position with the Commonwealth Censorship Department. She commenced work for the Foreign Languages Section of the Army in 1942, which she finished in 1945 at the end of World War II. She then obtained a permanent position of Australian Secretary to the Finnish Legation in Sydney in September 1949, a position she held until her death from cancer in 1965. Upon her reaching 15 years of service to the Finnish Legation in 1964, charge d'affaires Olavi Wanne presented Hope Kellow with the Cross of Merit of the Order of the Lion of Finland. Kellow's son Harry married Barbara Sams in 1948 while he was a medical resident at the hospital in Maitland, New South Wales. He was then a clinical assistant of obstetrics at St George Hospital before he established a private practice in Roseville Chase on Sydney's North Shore. Harry and Barbara had two children, Roslyn and John who pursued law and medical careers respectively. Kellow's grandson John Kellow is currently an associate professor and Head of Discipline of Medicine at the University of Sydney's Northern Clinical School, and a gastroenterologist and director of the neurogastroenterology unit at the Royal North Shore Hospital in Sydney.

The Romans repelled a Sasanian attack while sustaining minimal losses.Ammianus Marcellinus, Res Gestae, book 25, 1.19. However, the army's lack of supplies continued to threaten the army, and soon afterwards the emperor Julian was killed at the Battle of Samarra.  Background  After defeating the Persians in battle on the banks of the Tigris and surrounding the capital, Ctesiphon, Julian soon became convinced of his inability to take the city. The apparent impregnability of Ctesiphon, along with his desire to defeat Shapur the Persian king in battle, resolved Julian to abandon the siege. The river fleet which had accompanied the march of the army was abandoned to the flames, and Julian, relying on the fertility of the country for provisions for the troops, ordered the baggage train to be burnt, only 20 days' supplies being preserved. The army then proceeded inland, guided by native captives, who however took care to supply the emperor with misinformation and faulty councils, while Shapur fired the country, harassed the enemies' scouts, and dexterously eluded his main army. Incapable of forcing a battle, Julian fell back on the Tigris, resolved on a retreat north- westwards to the Roman province of Corduene, before his scanty and rotting provisions should run out.Edward Gibbon, The Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire, (The Modern Library, 1932), chap. XXIV., pp. 821-24  The Battle  The Persians, who had by now assembled a very numerous army, now closed upon the rear of the Romans. Julian's march was continually harassed, and the fighting at Maranga reached the proportions of a battle. Although the Persians were rebuffed and Julian's retreat was enabled to proceed, the losses were considerable on his side as well, and the retardation of his march contributed to weakening the army whose provisions were on the verge of giving out.Gibbon, p. 825  Aftermath  The subsequent death of Julian in the action of Samarra, which was similarly a tactical success for the Romans, contributed to lower the morale of the troops, and the emperor Jovian, whom they elected in the camp as Julian's successor, was brought by the threat of famine and the Persian army to conclude a disgraceful peace with Shapur II, conceding all the gains of the treaty of Diocletian (A.D. 298), and important border fortresses such as Nisibis and Singara, as well.Gibbon, p. 833 References Battles of the Roman‚ÄìSasanian Wars 360s in the Roman Empire 4th-century conflicts 4th century in Iran Julian (emperor) Julian's Persian War ","title":"Battle of Maranga"},{"id":"55081586","text":"Mr. Aiello () is a Canadian drama film, directed by Paul Tana and released in 1998.\\"Sweet 16: The 16th Rendez-vous de Cinema Quebecois embraces the province's multicultural character for the first time\\".

Many of his pupils were early students of Harvard College, including the minister Cotton Mather. From 1672 to 1700, the Cambridge Grammar School sent more students to Harvard than any other school. Early life Corlet was the son of Henry Corlet, a London wax chandler. He was an exhibitioner at Christ's Hospital. He began studying at Lincoln College, Oxford in March 1626-27 at the age of 17 and was awarded his B.A. in or circa 1631. He was ordained as a deacon in 1633. He was awarded an M.A. from Pembroke College, Cambridge in 1638. He worked as a schoolmaster in Framlingham and the Halstead Grammar School in Essex. Career It is not known when Corlet emigrated to the Massachusetts Bay Colony but he was schoolmaster of the Cambridge Grammar School by 1642 and was the first schoolmaster who was paid in part with public funds. Corlet was mentioned in New England's First Fruits, a pamphlet written in 1642 and published in England in 1643 to promote the colony and Harvard. The authors wrote: > And by the side of the Colledge a faire Grammar Schoole, for the training up > of young Scholars, and fitting of them for Academicall Learning, that still > as they are judged ripe, they may be received into the Colledge of this > Schoole: Master Corlet is the Mr., who hath very well approved himselfe for > his abilities, dexterity and painfulnesse in teaching and education of the > youth under him Cotton Mather In his Magnalia Christi Americana, Mather wrote of Corlet: > ...that memorable old school-master in Cambridge, from whose education our > colledge and country has received so many of its worthy men, that he is > himself worthy to have his name celebrated in no less a paragraph of our > church history... Corlet helped Mather manage his stammer, a stammer which Mather thought threatened to prevent him from becoming a preacher like his father and grandfather.Levy, Babette. \\"Chapter 10: The Angel of Bethesda.\\" Cotton Mather, by Babette M. Levy, Twayne Publishers, 1979. Twayne's United States Authors Series 328. Corlet advised Mather to speak in \\"a very Deliberate way of Speaking; a Drawling that shall be little short of Singing\\". This has been cited as an early example of speech-language pathology in America. Corlet also taught a number of Native American students at his school, including possibly Caleb Cheeshahteaumuck and Joel Iacoomes, both of whom went on to Harvard. Later life and death Corlet taught at the school until his death in 1687. He was the subject of a blank verse elegy by Nehemiah Walter (1663‚Äì1750), who was frequently employed by Corlet to run the school when he was absent. Corlet married Barbara Cutter around 1643. He was made a freeman in 1645. His son Ammi Ruhamah Corlet graduated from Harvard in 1670 and died of smallpox on February 1, 1679.

The Cabaret de L'Enfer was the counterpart to The Cabaret du Ciel (The Cabaret of Heaven), another cabaret which shared the same address on the Boulevard de Clichy. Antonin Alexander was the creator, director, and host of the twin ventures. Jules Claretie, who wrote that future historians of the mores of the Belle Epoque \\"could not silently pass by these cabarets\\", described them as \\"putting Dante's poem within walking distance\\". For Georges Renault and Henri Ch√¢teau, \\"Le Ciel and L'Enfer, gaping wide-open all in a row\\" was worthy of the label \\"spectacular\\". The fl√¢neurs of Paris entered through the monumental jaws of Leviathan, devourer of the damned. The intimidating fa√ßade was \\"a stucco ode to female nudity being devoured by infernal flames\\".  The Cabaret de l'Enfer, the Cabaret du Ciel, and the Cabaret du N√©ant  Cabaret de l'Enfer and Cabaret du Ciel (Cabaret of Hell and Cabaret of Heaven) Situated at the foot of the hill of Montmartre, in the 18th arrondisement of Paris, The Cabaret de l'Enfer was a precursor to theme restaurants, whose ambience was its main attraction, and only occasionally hosted caf√© singers. In 1895, three years after opening at 34 Boulevard de Clichy, Antonin moved the establishment down the street to number 53, where it remained for more than half a century. Meanwhile, the original location was purchased by a competitor, the illusionist Dorville, and his administrator, Roger, who opened a \\"cabaret macabre\\", the Cabaret du N√©ant (Cabaret of the Void), which specialized in more sinister \\"invocations of what lies beyond the grave\\", while the Cabaret du Ciel (Cabaret of Heaven) joyfully proposed \\"mystical illusions\\" and the Cabaret of Hell, \\"magic tricks\\".  The styles of the three \\"Cabarets of the Beyond\\"  Cabaret de l'Enfer and Cabaret du Ciel with horse carriage at the front of the caf√© According to Jules Claretie, the spectacles offered by the Cabarets of Ciel and Enfer \\"did not differ in essence from the attractions seen at the f√™te de Neuilly...They used the same illusionist tricks produced by combinations of mirrors and the play of light. But an organ added mysterious music to these rapid tableaux\\". The atmosphere was jovial, and Antonin, a former literature professor, maintained its geniality, setting the tone with humorous, costumed discourses delivered either as Saint Peter or Mephistopheles. The doorman of the cabaret of Hell, dressed as the Devil, greeted customers by telling them \\"Enter and be damned!\\". Once inside, the patrons were served by waiters dressed in devil suits. In 1899, a visitor reported that, in the jargon used inside the caf√©, an order of \\"three black coffees spiked with cognac\\" was relayed to the bar as: \\"Three seething bumpers of molten sins, with a dash of brimstone intensifier!\\". Facade of cabarets Le Ciel and L'Enfer, 1909 The mood was different at the Cabaret du N√©ant, \\"where a sinister irony was expressed, not with angels and devils, but with people, mortals, death\\". In their 1897 book, Montmartre, Renault and Ch√¢teau emphasize this critical difference: \\"if the Ciel and Enfer of the lovable M. Antonin merit a visit, this is not true of the N√©ant, which is frequented by hysterical and neurotic persons; M. Dorville is the founder and owner of this cabaret of Death where, by aid of mirrors, the customer is made to witness the decomposition of bodies, where the tables are coffins, the diners are the dead, the waiters are the undertakers, and so on and so forth\\".  The Cabaret of Hell and Surrealism  The Surrealists, led by Andr√© Breton, occasionally met at the Cabaret de l'Enfer. Breton's studio occupied the fourth floor above the cabaret. It was in this studio that he and Robert Desnos organized the famous sessions of semi-sleep and automatic writing of the 1920s.  After 1950: Monoprix and other items of interest  Cabaret de l'Enfer entrance detail A few years after the Liberation of Paris, the Monoprix supermarket that had neighbored the Cabaret de L'Enfer since 1934 bought both caf√©s, gutted them, expanded, and replaced the two fa√ßades with their own front entrance. The Monoprix currently occupies the length of the ground floor between the corner with Rue Pierre-Fontaine and number 51. The entrance stands where the Cabaret de l'Enfer used to be. The lengthy spree of serial killer Guy Georges, whose multiple rapes, aggression with knives, tortures, and murders terrorized Parisians for seven years, ended in April 1998 when Captain Bernard Basdevant identified and neutralized the criminal at the spot where the Cabaret de l'Enfer once stood. It was inside the Monoprix that Georges first confessed to be \\"the killer of East Paris\\".

Transport systems were unavailable through parts of the city as trains and roadways were shut. Power was shut off from various parts of the city to prevent electrocution. The International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies (IFRC) called the South Asian floods one of the worst regional humanitarian crises in years. This event can be compared with the 2005 floods in Mumbai, which recorded 944 mm (37.17 inches) of rainfall within 24 hours on 26 July. The extreme rainfall on 29 August 2017 was forecasted by the Indian Meteorological Department (IMD), five to six days in advance. However, the government failed to respond quickly, leading to the crisis. Recent research indicates that these floods could be attributed to climate change. Climate change has led to huge fluctuations in the monsoon winds carrying the moisture from the Arabian Sea, resulting in heavy rainfall over central India, lasting for two to three days.

The mountain range lies to the east of the Himalayas and to the west of the Hengduan Mountains. The mountains are geographically a southern extension of the eastern Transhimalayas. Physical geography and climate The Kangri Garpo stretch for approximately from west to east. They lie at the eastern end of the Himalayan Range and were formed at the same time during the Indian subcontinent's collision with Eurasia. The Kangri Garpo are geologically related to the Himalayas, but are separated by the Yarlung Tsangpo's Grand Canyon. The eastern anchor of the Himalayas, Namcha Barwa, rises above the western Kangri Garpo just beyond the Yarlung Tsangpo. To the north, the Kangri Garpo are separated from the Nyenchen Tanglha by the Parlung Tsangpo River. To the northeast, the Kangri Garpo are connected with the Baxoila Range, sometimes considered the westernmost component range of the Hengduan Mountains. Further east, the Kangri Garpo are separated from the Baxoila by the Zay√º River. To the south, the Kangri Garpo transition to the Indian Mishmi Hills, also known in China as the Qilinggong Mountains (Á•ÅÁÅµÂÖ¨Â±±). The distinction between the Kangri Garpo and the Mishmi Hills is not well defined, and may only represent a difference of cultures on either on either side of the McMahon Line. The highest peak of the Kangri Garpo, Bairiga or Ruoni, rises in the central portion of the range to an elevation of above sea level. Other notable peaks include Gemsongu at , Kone Kangri at , Yuhe Kangri at , and Gheni at . The Kangri Garpo form a high-altitude barrier at the northeasternmost limit of the Indian subcontinent. The mountains here are in the direct path of the northeast-moving South Asian monsoon which leads to Kangri Garpo being the wettest location on the Tibetan Plateau. This also leads to one of the highest concentrations of glaciers in the region. Notable glaciers include the scenic Midiu Glacier, the Ata Glacier (the lowest glacier in Tibet reaching an elevation of ), and the -long Lhagu Glacier. Due to the heavy precipitation in the area, the Kangri Garpo support dense forests including the Northeastern Himalayan subalpine conifer forests at middle altitudes and Eastern Himalayan broadleaf forests at lower altitudes. At higher altitudes, the mountains are covered by Eastern Himalayan alpine shrub and meadows. Human geography The Kangri Garpo lie in the southeast part of Tibet, at the junction between Kham to the east, √ú-Tsang to the west, and South Asian hill tribes to the south. The Tibetan Poyul Kingdom enjoyed relative independence on the Kangri Garpo's northern slopes until the early 20th century. Today, the western Kangri Garpo are under the administration of Bom√™ County to the north and M√™dog County to the south. The bulk of the eastern Kangri Garpo are part of Zay√º County while a small portion of the north-central Kangri Garpo are part of Baxoi County. All these counties are part of Nyingchi Prefecture, except for Baxoi which is part of Qamdo Prefecture. To the south of the Kangri Garpo are the Mishmi Hills which lie primarily in Arunachal Pradesh, India but are also claimed by China. The McMahon Line passes just south of the Kangri Garpo. The only significant towns in the mountain range are Zhamo in the north, Rawu in the northeast, and Zay√º in the southeast. The only vehicular road to cross the Kangri Garpo is the road to M√™dog via Galong Pass in the western part of the mountains that was completed in 2013. The northern portion of the Kangri Garpo are skirted by China National Highway 318 and have become a popular scenic destination for Chinese tourists. Access to this region of Tibet, however, is often restricted for foreigners.

Flying aircraft on display N2S/PT-17 Stearman History N1387V (s/n 75-8291), an N2S-5 Boeing-Stearman Model 75, was manufactured in 1943 at the Boeing plant in Wichita, Kansas. It was purchased by the U.S. Government to be operated as a trainer by the Navy at Corpus Christi, Texas. After World War II it was sold as surplus and was modified with a larger 450 hp engine for use in crop dusting. It was sold again in the early 1980s and flown as a sport and recreational aircraft. While en route to California the aircraft crashed in the Oquirrh Mountains. The Commemorative Air Force purchased the salvage rights. After significant restoration work at Twin Falls, Idaho, N1387V flew again August 17, 1988. Since then it has been part of the Utah Wing and appears at local airshows and provides rides to the public. In December, 2015 N1387V underwent a wing restoration with old fabric removed, minor repairs performed, and completed new fabric and paint. N1387V flew during the 2016 season.

Unlike most other EF-mount lenses, it does not provide autofocus. Overview The TS-E 135 mm 4L MACRO provides four degrees of freedom, allowing ¬±10¬∞ tilt with respect to the film or sensor plane and ¬±12 mm shift with respect to the center of the image area; each movement can be rotated ¬±90¬∞ about the lens axis. Shifting allows adjusting the position of the subject in the image area without moving the camera back; it is often used to avoid convergence of parallel lines, such as when photographing a tall building. Tilting the lens relies on the Scheimpflug principle to rotate the plane of focus away from parallel to the image plane; this can be used either to have all parts of an inclined subject sharply rendered, or to restrict sharpness to a small part of a scene. Tilting the lens results in a wedge- shaped depth of field that may be a better fit to some scenes than the depth of field between two parallel planes that results without tilt. Unlike most view cameras, the shift mechanism allows shifts along only one axis, and the tilt mechanism allows tilts about only one axis; however, the rotation of the mechanisms allows the orientations of the axes to be changed, providing, in effect, combined tilt and swing, and combined rise/fall and lateral shift. The TS-E 135 mm 4L MACRO was the first lens from Canon which combined Macro and tilt-shift. It was announced together with a series of lenses, the TS-E 50 mm 2.8L MACRO and the TS-E 90 mm f/2.8L MACRO, which introduced the same features.

He is the creator of the Web series platform when he introduced the first internet episodic website The Spot.  Early life  Born in Long Island, New York, Zakarin began making full length video movies at the age of 15. He wrote and directed his first feature film: \\"The Gifted‚Äù in 1989, premiered at the Cannes Film Festival. He also made Creating Rem Lezar, a straight-to-video children's musical fantasy. Shortly after, Zakarin packed up his van and moved to Los Angeles to begin his Hollywood career at the age of 26.  Career  In 1995, while directing commercials and early interactive television tests for Fattal & Collins advertising agency, Zakarin became fascinated by the Internet. He spent time in chat rooms and quickly recognized an untapped entertainment platform. In response, he joined with Troy Bolotnick, Rich Tackenberg, and Laurie Plaksin, (who also starred as the shows main character Tara Hartwick) to create The Spot, the first interactive entertainment web series that combined online diary entries, photos, video, and groundbreaking interactive techniques to create a new storytelling format known as ‚ÄúThe Web Series‚Äù. Zakarin convinced his employer Russ Collins to back his novel idea, and the site premiered early in June 1995, running through the early summer of 1997. ‚ÄúThe Spot‚Äù was the first winner of Infoseek's \\"Cool Site of the Year\\" (TheWebby Award) for 1995. ‚ÄúThe Spot‚Äù was an early influencer of the Internet dot-com boom that followed. Although it attracted revenue with integrated ad campaigns for blue chip sponsors such as K-Swiss, Activision, and Toyota. Many of the expectations of those involved in the early days of online entertainment proved to be premature. Zakarin and his team left the site about a year after its launch due to creative and business differences. Zakarin and company launched a new company, LightSpeed Media Inc., which created interactive websites for media companies such as Playboy and the first website for Activision. Next, the team created GrapeJam.com, that featured live improvisational activities and streamed radio broadcasts. GrapeJam.com was nominated for the Webby for best comedy website. People Magazine called Zakarin \\"King of the sit.com‚Äù. Several high-profile media pioneers, such as Spider-Man creator Stan Lee and television programmer Brandon Tartikoff, were attracted to the new storytelling format. Tartikoff lead Zakarin to Ted Leonsis of America Online (AOL) which purchased LightSpeed Media Inc. Zakarin and Tartikoff, built, with the original creative team of \\"The Spot,‚Äù \\"Entertainment Asylum\\" for Aol's Leonsis, Charlie Fink, and Danny Krifcher. After the stock market dot-com bubble exploded, Zakarin turned back to more traditional media and began producing, directing, and representing movies for a company he co-founded with Rich Tackenberg called Creative Light Media. Creative Light Media operated from 1998 until 2006, distributing and producing independent films, some of which Zakarin produced, wrote, and directed. It also produced several critically well received documentaries for theatrical, video, and cable release, including: Mind Meld, featuring William Shatner and Leonard Nimoy discussing their Star Trek characters and experiences. The Miramax release, Comic Book: The Movie starring Mark Hamill, Roger Rose, Billy West and Jess Harnell, and featuring cameo appearances by Hugh Hefner, Kevin Smith, Stan Lee and dozens of other pop culture icons and innovators. ‚ÄúComic Book: The Movie‚Äù won Variety's 2004 DVD Exclusive Award in the Best Live Action category.

The conservation area is owned and maintained by the Ausable Bayfield Conservation Authority (ABCA). The former \\"Ausable River Conservation Authority\\" was Ontario's first conservation authority, created in 1946. The Bayfield River watershed and smaller streams were added in 1971. Local municipalities and the Province of Ontario formed \\"Ausable Bayfield Conservation Authority\\" (ABCA) to prevent the loss of important local ecosystems, to protect life and property through flood management, and to build a healthier natural environment on a watershed scale. Rock Glen Conservation Area is situated in a transition zone between the Carolinian forest zone to the south, and the Great Lakes (St. Lawrence Zone to the north), in Lambton Shores, Ontario, Canada. On the conservation area grounds is the Arkona Lions Museum and Information Centre; which houses a collection of Devonian period fossils and Aboriginal artifacts found in the local area.  History  Civilization around Rock Glen dates back to the time when Paleolithic or Early First Nations peoples used the nearby hills to hunt the barren ground for caribou some 10,000-years-ago.Many of their hunting arrows and tools can be seen on display at the \\"Arkona Lions Museum\\" located on the conservation grounds. Succeeding the Paleolithic humans at the end of the Pleistocene were the Archaic First Nations who had adapted to a much milder climate some 6,000-years-ago. The museum at the conservation area displays \\"fluted points\\" associated with the Pleistocene people and many Clovis Point Meadow Cache Blades from the Archaic aboriginal peoples. This area features some of the best Devonian Period fossils in North America. It is home to a 350 million year old fossil deposit. Erosion by water has exposed a geological formation called the \\"Hungry Hollow Formation\\" and washed out many of the different fossils contained there. The most commonly found fossils are brachiopods, horn corals (Heliophyllum halli), and crinoid stem sections; which are remains of the marine life of the Devonian period. Trilobites have also been found.Johnson, Lorraine. The natural treasures of Carolinian Canada: discovering the rich natural diversity of Ontarios Southwestern heartland. Toronto, J. Lorimer & Co., 2007. When the pioneer settlers arrived in the area in the mid-1800s, they built some grist mills within the present-day conservation area, one of which was powered by an 11-metre overshot wheel. The mill pond, although dry, can still be seen immediately upstream and southwest of Rock Glen Falls. Part of the mill foundation has a platform that affords visitors an excellent view of the waterfalls. In 1907, the Rock Glen Power Company constructed a small hydro-electric dam on the Ausable River at Rock Glen. Following the formation of Ontario Hydro, the Rock Glen dam ceased operation shortly after the Second World War. In response to complaints from anglers that fish were unable to travel upstream to spawn, a Canadian Army demolition squad blew up the dam with dynamite. Parts of the old dam can still be seen in the bottom of the Ausable River.

Some of these native trees are: sycamore, sassafras, cucumber magnolia, tulip-tree, black walnut, maple, oak, ash, pine, and pawpaw.https://caroliniancanada.ca/legacy/Publications/LC_Final_Factsheet_070425.pdf Wildflowers are abundant, with more than 50-types found within the boundaries of the Conservation Area. Small mammals and songbirds are common. There are also examples of extinct animal life along the walls of the Ausable Gorge, small sea creatures that lived 350 million years ago. Fossils of some of these ancient animals include: brachiopods, horn corals, sponge coral, crinoids or gastropods. The park is home to the eastern coyote, wood duck, deer, muskrat, and common garter snake.

The museum also has a large collection of fossils and artifacts found on or near the conservation grounds, and holds presentations and guided tours there for visitors and schools. The grounds also has many stairs, boardwalks and bridges allowing visitors to safely explore the steep sides of the glen and the 10.7-metre high waterfall just upstream of the Ausable River. Many of fossils found in the exposed beds there date back 350-Million-Years; some of which include crinoids, brachiopods and trilobites, which the conservation park allows visitors to take one fossil if visibility seen without digging. There are also public washrooms, two picnic pavilions available for reservation, playground equipment by the pavilions, the lookouts located at different parts of the conservation area, and many trails for hiking.

History  Haerfest was founded in 2011 by brothers Tim and Dan Joo. The brand first began with its series of tailored leather backpacks. It came to the brothers‚Äô attention that most backpacks available in the market were either academic or sporty in design. This presented them a unique opportunity as there was a need for a tailored backpack that was not only functional but stylish. Opening Ceremony recognized the potential behind the idea presented by Haerfest. It placed an order for the first Haerfest collection. After its initial launch, Haerfest made significant leeway in the fashion world, both at home and abroad. It soon made a name by establishing its signature interpretation of the familiar. Haerfest steadily grew over the years. From its initial line of tailored backpacks, the company expanded to produce a whole range of leather accessories. They currently produce men‚Äôs bags, women‚Äôs bags, as well as small leather accessories. At the same time, it also expanded its distribution line, starting with one store in New York the brand is now carried globally. Haerfest bags are now available in major cities including New York, Los Angeles, Portland, Seattle, Chicago, San Francisco, Beijing, Shanghai, Hong Kong, Paris, London, Finland, Sweden, Canada, Saudi Arabia, Taiwan, Japan, and Seoul.  Signature style  Haerfest is made distinct by its signature ring and stud. This was designed to make the product unique and functional. In most bags, the straps are sewn into the seams of the bags. However, Haerfest‚Äôs single strap system breaks new ground by introducing its ring and stud system, enhancing the owner‚Äôs freedom of movement.  Awards and Recognition  The brand has since won a number of awards since its establishment. * CFDA Incubator Program - Awarded acceptance into the CFDA Fashion Incubator business development program 2016 ‚Äì 2017 * DENYC - Awarded first prize of the Design Entrepreneurs NYC competition of 2016 by the Fashion Institute of Technology (FIT) and the New York City Economic Development Corporation (NYCEDC)  References  Luxury brands High fashion brands American brands Companies based in New York City ","title":"Haerfest (fashion brand)"},{"id":"55082836","text":"Carlos Fonseca Su√°rez (born 1987, in San Jos√©, Costa Rica) is a Costa Rican- Puerto Rican writer and academic.

Early life  Thomas Charles Anderson was born to a poor family in the Irish Channel neighborhood of New Orleans. There are conflicting details about the date of his birth, and of his full name. It is thought he was born on November 22, 1858, and that his real name was Thomas Charles Anderson, but it is not known for sure. It is also thought that his father was Scottish and that his mother was from Ireland, but the details remain sketchy and not much is known about his early life. As a young boy he hawked the Daily Picayune newspaper, helping police catch petty thieves, and acting as a ‚Äústool pigeon‚Äù for the police. He also delivered cocaine and opium to various brothels around the city, marking his first association with both the police and with the demi-monde, which would serve him greatly later on in life. Although he didn't have much formal education, he had a keen eye and was known to be good with numbers which helped him gain employment as a bookkeeper with the Insurance Oil Company, and later with the Louisiana Lottery Company. In 1880, he married one Emma Schwartz, a Dutch Immigrant from the Irish Channel. They bought a house on St. Louis Street, and soon had a child by the name of Irene, but the tranquility of married life did not last long for Emma died of Typhoid the following year, and he had Irene placed in the St. Vincent's Infant Asylum. Through his work in the Louisiana Lottery Company, he began to cultivate political connections around this time. He donated to various political parties, and attended various charity events put on by the influential Men's Clubs in New Orleans. These new found political connections, and his already strong relationship with the Police Department allowed him to open up his first restaurant and bar, the Astoria Club, on North Rampart Street in 1882. The Astoria Club became a place where the local bigwigs he had come to know and the more underworld types of New Orleans could associate and discuss ‚Äúpay-offs,‚Äù and other payments for the protection they provided.  Storyville era  In 1897, he opened up another restaurant and bar with a man named Billy Struve, a young police reporter from the New Orleans Daily who became a life-time associate, the establishment was called the Fair Play Saloon, and it was located at the corner of Basin and Customhouse Streets. It was his first foray in the area that would become known as Storyville, a year before it would become the country's first legal red light district. It is curious that he opened the Fair Play a year before the law was enacted. It seems possible he had some inside knowledge from his connections to the political establishment of New Orleans. Nonetheless, with the passing of legislation creating Storyville, Tom Anderson was in perfect position to reap the benefits and the rewards, and was on his way to running and profiting from what would become known as ‚ÄúAnderson County,‚Äù and on his way to becoming the political boss of the Fourth Ward in New Orleans, Louisiana. A year later he changed the name of his restaurant and saloon from the Free Play Saloon to the Arlington Annex. He seems to have taken an interest and became business partners with one Josie Arlington, the notorious madam who had run a brothel at 172 Customhouse Street just around the corner from his Fair Play Saloon. It is said he married a woman by the name of Catherine Turnbull in 1894, and that it ended in divorce, but it is not known for sure. Through the years, Tom Anderson become associated with many woman of the demi-monde, there was also one Hilma Burt who it is said he helped finance her purchase of Flo Meeker's Place, as stated by Jelly Roll Morton: \\"Hilma Burt's was on the corner of Customhouse and Basin streets, next door to Tom Anderson's saloon ‚Äì Tom Anderson was the King of the District and ran the Louisiana Legislature and Hilma Burt was supposed to be his ‚Äúold lady.‚Äù Hers was no doubt one of the best paying places in the city and I thought I had a very bad night when I made under a hundred dollars.\\" It is not known if his association with Josie Arlington, the notorious Madam, was in much the same way as his association with Hilda Burt, but one can only assume that the relationship between them was along the same lines. In 1910, he met Gertrude Dix, an attractive and cultured 29-year-old woman, and she became the de facto manager for many of his properties and businesses, and his partner for most the remainder of his life. He branched out into various other businesses, trying his hand at boxing, becoming a manager of Andy Bowen, the light weight champion of the South, giving away free tickets to all his friends and associates, and he got involved with the Record Oil Refining Company, later called the Liberty Oil Company, even sponsoring a race horse through the company at the Fair Grounds Race Course in New Orleans, with the best seats in the house reserved for all his political friends. He also expanded the number of establishment's that he owned, opening up the Stag at 714 Gravier Street, and the Arlington at 114 North Rampart Street. Then in 1904, Tom Anderson went even further, seeking to legitimize himself by getting elected to the State Legislator in Baton Rouge, and although the opposition was fierce especially from the more conservative factions in the city, he won election on the Republican ticket, serving for 16 years as a member of the influential House and Ways committee, and also on the Committee on the Affairs of the city of New Orleans, but through all his success the winds of change were blowing.  Death and legacy  Because in 1917 the axe fell on the first legal red light district in the United States. In August of that year, Secretary of the Navy Josephus Daniels ordered that Storyville be closed down for good. Tom Anderson, now in his sixties, was still the owner and operator of his restaurant and bar on North Rampart Street, but the flush times had come to an end. But even that got him in trouble with the law around the year 1920. He was charged with operating a ‚Äúlewd establishment‚Äù within in ten miles of a military base, and having forty ‚Äúknown prostitutes‚Äù working on any given night. He denied all charges, saying that he had been in the restaurant business since 1892, and had a lawful license to run his establishment. Ending in mistrial, the story was in all the newspapers, but those would be the last headlines for Tom Anderson, and the last of his known associations with prostitution and the saloon business. In 1928, he suffered a serious illness, and began to feel remorse and repentance on the life he had led before, attending Church regularly and giving money to charity, and even marrying his long time partner Gertrude Dix, before passing away in 1931. But even in his death the problems of his old life never went away. In his will he had given all his money and assets to his newly married wife, a sum of 120,000 dollars, but his daughter from his first wife, one Irene Desla, who married George Desla a former manager of his Rampart Street establishment, questioned the will on the grounds of the state concubinage law, saying that Tom and Gertrude had never been legally married. Gertrude eventually settled with his daughter giving her half of the estate, and living out her days in an elegant house in the French Quarter of New Orleans until she died in 1961. At the time of his death the newspapers reported that he was a respected and distinguished citizen without a passable mention of his past life, as the unofficial mayor and political boss of Storyville. A man famed for his hospitality and for his ability to cultivate and bring together the denizens of the Fourth Ward, much for his own gain and much for his own pleasure, as Jelly Roll Morton said it best: \\"I'm telling you this tenderloin district was something that nobody has ever seen before, or since. . . They had everything in the District from the highest class to the lowest. . .\\" and Tom Anderson, the unofficial mayor of Storyville, had a hand in it all, as he sat in his Saloon at the corner of Customhouse and Basin, entertaining his friends and helping out strangers, running his businesses, and controlling all the vice that came through the district they once called \\"Anderson County.\\"  References  1858 births 1931 deaths American political bosses Politicians from New Orleans Louisiana Republicans ","title":"Thomas C.

Geography The Northeastern Congolian lowland forests lie in the northeastern basin of the Congo River. The ecoregion is mostly in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, with a portion extending into the southern Central African Republic. It is the easternmost portion of the Guineo-Congolian region, a belt of tropical rain forests that extends through western and central Africa. The Ituri Rainforest is in the ecoregion. The ecoregion is lies north and east of Congo River, and other rainforest ecoregions bound it on the west and southwest. It is bounded on the north by the Northern Congolian forest-savanna mosaic, and on the southeast by the Southern Congolian forest-savanna mosaic. The Albertine Rift mountains bound the Congo Basin on the east, and are home to the neighboring Albertine Rift montane forests ecoregion above 1500 meters elevation. Climate The climate is humid and tropical. Average annual rainfall ranges from 1,500 mm to 2,000 mm, and is generally lower in the east. There is a distinct dry season from January to March. Flora The predominant plant community is lowland moist forest. The forests are principally evergreen, with areas of semi-evergreen forest where some trees lose their leaves during the winter dry season. The forests are mostly a mix of species, although there are some single-species stands, notably Gilbertiodendron dewevrei. Transitional submontane forest is found at the eastern edge of the ecoregion on the lower slopes of the Albertine Rift mountains, and drier transitional forest is found along the ecoregion's northern edge. Fauna 16 mammals are endemic to the ecoregion, including the okapi, giant genet, aquatic genet, mountain shrew, African foggy shrew, Congo shrew, fuscous shrew (Crocidura polia), owl-faced monkey, L'Hoest's monkey, pied bat, Allen's striped bat, Misonne's soft-furred mouse, and Verschuren's swamp rat. It is important habitat for the eastern lowland gorilla. Endemic birds include Neumann's coucal (Centropus neumanni) and golden-naped weaver (Ploceus aureonucha). Nahan's francolin, Ituri batis, Turner's eremomela, Congo peacock, Sassi's greenbul, Bedford's paradise- flycatcher, and Chapin's mountain-babbler are considered near-endemic. There are five endemic reptiles, including the Zaire dwarf gecko. There are seven endemic amphibians, including the olive shovelnose (Hemisus olivaceus), Kigulube reed frog (Hyperolius diaphanus), Kunungu reed frog (H. schoutendeni), Mertens' running frog (Kassina mertensi), Buta River frog (Phrynobatrachus gastoni), Christy's grassland frog (Ptychadena christyi), and Pangi Territory frog (Amietia chapini). People The eastern edge of the ecoregion along the Albertine Rift is the most densely-populated. The central part of the ecoregion, including the Ituri Forest, is sparsely populated, and is home to the Mbuti people, an indigenous pygmy people who live by hunting and gathering in the forest. Protected areas A 2017 assessment found that 54,712 km¬≤, or 11%, of the ecoregion is in protected areas. 34% of the unprotected area is still forested.Eric Dinerstein, David Olson, et al. (2017).

It was published by Shadow Mountain Publishing on January 1, 2012. It is the sequel to the 2007 novel The Candy Shop War. Plot summary Magical enforcers Ziggy and Victor Battiato, inform Nate, Summer, Trevor, and Pigeon of the disappearances of fellow enforcer John Dart and magician Mozag and direct the group to investigate the Arcadeland arcade. After visiting the arcade, the friends resolve to earn enough tickets to obtain the magical hand stamps, which grant membership into four exclusive clubs. Nate receives his stamp from the owner of Arcadeland, magician Jonas White, who reveals that he is using the clubs to hunt for a powerful artifact named Uweya. Lindy Stott, who is unaware that she is actually Jonas' sister, Belinda White, also earns a stamp, to the dismay of her adoptive guardian Sebastian Stott. Summer gets a Tank stamp, which grants increased endurance, Pigeon joins the Subs, allowing him to breathe underwater, Trevor becomes a Racer, allowing him to move at inhuman speed, and Nate and Lindy join the Jets, who can fly. To ensure their obedience, Jonas creates a simulacrum, a voodoo doll-like facsimile, of each club member. Jonas‚Äô first task pits the Jets against the Subs in a race to retrieve the Gate to Uweya from a recluse known as the Hermit. Nate and Lindy force the Hermit to hand over the Gate, which takes the form of a stone block, explaining that they were helping Jonas only to save their friends. Pigeon and the other defeated Subs are secretly imprisoned by Jonas under Arcadeland, whereafter he discovers that Dart and Mozag are also held prisoner. Jonas‚Äô second task pits the Racers against the Tanks to retrieve a guidestone from the Graywater family. The Tanks overpower the Graywaters and seize the guidestone. Instead of returning to Arcadeland with the other Racers, Trevor takes refuge in Mr. Stott's apartment, where he is safe from Jonas‚Äô magic. The Jets triumph over the Tanks in the third task to use the guidestone to retrieve a small idol called the Protector. Leaving Lindy to return to Arcadeland, Nate heads to Stott's apartment to plan his next move. Summer also flees there to avoid imprisonment with the other Tanks. Meanwhile, Trevor and Victor are captured in a failed rescue mission to Arcadeland, though Victor manages to transmit the location of the source of Jonas‚Äô magical power to Ziggy, who informs Nate. Nate then visits the Hermit a second time and is given his charm, which will protect him against Jonas‚Äô magic. Upon his return home, he is confronted by Lindy, who tells him that Jonas revealed the truth about her identity to her. The next morning, Jonas‚Äô henchmen drive the Jets up to Mt. Diablo, where they descend into an underground chamber. They use the Gate and Protecto bypass the first layers of defenses guarding Uweya. Jonas paralyzes the Jets using his simulacra, though Nate is granted immunity by the Hermit's charm. Nate navigates the final set of defenses and encounters two members of the Graywater family, who tell him that Uweya is a globe that can affect physical objects on the real Earth. Nate uses Uweya to destroy Jonas' power source, then destroys Uweya itself to prevent it from being misused. With Jonas attenuated, his prisoners are freed and he and his henchmen are taken into custody. Stott requests Nate to support Lindy as she processes her identity and reveals that there is a third White sibling, Camilla, whom Mozag is keeping an eye on.

C. F. Moodie, was a South African writer, historian and linguist who published a newspaper The Portonian in Port Adelaide, South Australia, from 1871 to 1879. History Moodie was born near Stellenbosch, South Africa, the sixth son of public servant Donald Moodie, R.N. (1794‚Äì1861) and his wife Eliza Sophia Moodie, n√©e Pigot (1804 ‚Äì 26 October 1881). When quite young, his father was appointed the Colony of Natal's first Colonial Secretary after the imposition of British rule, and the family moved accordingly. The boy's formal education was sporadic, partly owing to the paucity of teaching in the new Colony, but also on account of his impulsive nature. Most of his education must have come from his mother, whom he adored: a cultured and talented woman who, among other attributes was a fine chess player, and taught her children to play at a high standard. His nomadic nature took him over much of the Colony, where he fraternised with vagrants of many races, gaining a working knowledge of a variety of languages and dialects. He was a particular admirer of the Zulu race, and his vernacular Zulu was said to be indistinguishable from that of a native speaker. He was a fine athlete, and a decent shot with a rifle, and enjoyed quoit playing, wrestling and other sports. South Australia Moodie came to South Australia from South Africa around 1869, and soon found employment with the Customs Department at Port Adelaide. In 1870 he was nominated for the Humane Society's medal when he dived into the river fully clothed to rescue a young man who had fallen overboard from the Coonatto. The story that he was subsequently sacked because his tally-book was spoiled by the immersion gained credence with repetition. Moodie founded the weekly newspaper The Portonian (1871 ‚Äì May 1879) as a forum for news about Port Adelaide, but much of the paper's content was devoted to criticising the Parliament, the Governor and just about any other authority figure. His racy, vigorous style of writing won for the paper a large and loyal circulation. He employed a talented cartoonist in \\"Cerberus\\" (John Eden Savill, better known as a racehorse owner), and journalist Spencer Skipper, who later, as \\"Hugh Kalyptus\\", gained fame for his satirical column \\"Echoes and Re-Echoes\\". Moodie himself was a brilliant writer and well regarded as a poet. He contributed news items from South Africa, in particular the Anglo- Zulu War early in 1879. Portonian ceased without notice in May 1879. Moodie was not one to settle down however, and publication of The Portonian in the last years became intermittent and ceased entirely in May 1879 without announcement or apology. Savill's political cartoons had almost completely disappeared; in their place were works by W. Wyburd and W. Pyndar Willis. The Portonian was printed by Webb, Vardon & Pritchard, and the artwork lithographed by the firm of Penman & Galbraith. :Other satiric newspapers of the period in Adelaide were: :*F. S. Carroll's The Lantern; :*H. C. Evans's Quiz (became Quiz and the Lantern) :*J. C. F. Johnson's Adelaide Punch :*H. A. Grainger's Australian Star Moodie was an excellent swimmer, and on one occasion in 1880 outlasted the renowned \\"Professor\\" Frederick Cavill (1839‚Äì1927) in a swim from the Semaphore to Glenelg, a distance of . Cavill was accompanied by a friend in a rowboat, and Moodie by his Zulu friend UgendeUgende was later well-known in Broken Hill as \\"James Thompson\\" in a catamaran. Moodie, older, \\"blue-blooded and scarlet-faced\\" and somewhat corpulent, kept up with his rival and continued for several miles after Cavill was forced to retire due to eye inflammation, but did not complete the distance. Cavill did complete the distance (in the other direction) a week later. Persistent rumours that Moodie had cheated by touching the bottom and so dishonestly propelling himself were rebuffed by referees who had accompanied the pair in another boat. He took offence at an article in the Williamstown Advertiser of Williamstown, Victoria on 15 May 1880 in which Queen Victoria was called an \\"obese, not overburdened with brains, old woman\\". He and Ugende took a steamer to Melbourne with the avowed intent of giving Alfred Thomas Clark, the paper's prominent co-owner, a caning. He was convicted of assault and fined ¬£3. Not having sufficient funds for the return passage, the pair walked back to Adelaide, taking 17 days, crossing the Ninety Mile Desert in five. The cane was sent by some sympathisers to Walsh Bros., where it was suitably mounted, and engraved: > With this cane Mr. D.C. F. Moodie thrashed A. T. Clark, M.P., for insulting > Her Majesty Queen Victoria. Presented by a few Melbourne gentlemen, June, > 1880. On his return he found that solicitor Alfred Knight Whitby had given advice to Mrs. Moodie regarding separation from her husband. Moodie promptly sought out the lawyer at Aldridge's Prince Alfred Hotel and in front of witnesses knocked him to the floor. For this assault he was fined ¬£5. He wrote lyrics, to which Jules Meilhan BA ( ‚Äì1882) composed the music, for a patriotic cantata which was performed at the opening of the Adelaide Exhibition of 1881 (not to be confused with the Jubilee Cantata, or Victoria Cantata, written (words and music) by Carl Puttmann for the Adelaide Jubilee International Exhibition of 1887). Genial and sociable but erratic, \\"Zulu\\" Moodie as he had been dubbed seemed to be continually in the public eye: he put himself forward as candidate for the seat of Encounter Bay, but was hissed down; he offered to lead a contingent to fight in the Transvaal, then to organise a South Australian Guerrilla Force; he wrote \\"Letters to the Editor\\" on subjects as diverse as decoding the Biblical 666 and the ban on ostrich farming. He was in the forefront in organising a Literary Society, then after being elected Secretary, claimed to have lost the minute book and resigned. Return to Africa In 1883 he made a brief return to South Africa, then around September 1883 returned for good. Around 1889 or 1890 he founded a newspaper The South African Rambler, which may not have survived its first issue. He died at sea aboard a steamer off the island of Tenerife, perhaps en route between Cape Town and London. Bibliography included a poem by his brother John Bell Moodie.  > . . . His most notable performance, \\"The Wars and Battlefields of South > Africa\\", will be of abiding value and interest. It is a pictorial history of > the picturesque epochs of South Africa. It contains a good deal of matter, > Chief Dunn's chapters for instance, that can be found nowhere else. Family Moodie came from a large and influential family, descendants of Major James Moodie (1757‚Äì1820), Laird Of Melsetter.

She was laid down on 7 December 2015 and was launched six months later on 4 July 2016. A series of builder's sea trials commenced soon after and, during November 2017, the ship formed a \\"sistership bond\\" with the Republic of Korea Navy frigate ROKS Daegu (FFG-818). Following the completion of builder's sea trials, Tidesurge departed Opko en route for her delivery to the United Kingdom. During her journey, she made stopovers at United States Fleet Activities Sasebo in Japan and Pearl Harbour, Hawaii. She then transited the Panama Canal into the Atlantic Ocean, anchoring off Antigua before continuing her transit to Falmouth, England. She arrived in Falmouth on 27 March 2018 and underwent UK customisation work, including the fitting of self-defence weaponry, communications systems and armour, in the A&P; Falmouth shipyard.

Operational history On 9 May 2019, Tidesurge joined two other RFA ships, and Tideforce, to assist with the latter's sea trials. The maneuvers involved the first \\"Tide-to-Tide\\" RAS in history. Two months later, Tidesurge assisted with the seizure of an Iranian oil tanker, named Grace I, which was believed to be heading to Syria. Royal Marines from 42 Commando fast-roped onto the oil tanker via a Wildcat helicopter which launched from Tidesurge. The oil tanker was impounded in Gibraltar, an act which was condemned by Iran as an \\"act of piracy\\", before later being released. Between entering service and August, Tidesurge had seen a \\"surge in demand\\", operating in the Norwegian Sea, North Sea, Atlantic Ocean and the Arctic Circle, including with an 814 Naval Air Squadron Merlin helicopter on board. In October 2019, Tidesurge participated in Flag Officer Sea Training (FOST) before joining Exercise Joint Warrior, a large-scale NATO military exercise in Scotland.

The Foundation was created in 1973, when the writer decided to give his private library and he created the Josep Pla Library Private Foundation, governed by a Board that deals with its conservation and to facilitate access to the interested public. thumb The Josep Pla Foundation The Josep Pla Foundation is part of the Espais Escritus, an association related with the Catalan literary heritage.  The building  The Josep Pla Foundation is located in the 49 and 51 of Carrer Nou. The first one, is the birthplace of the writer and the one that hosts the permanent exhibition Josep Pla (1897-1981).

The obverse features a head of Neptune, while the reverse depicts the triumph of Gaius Plautius Decianus after his capture of Privernum.Crawford, Roman Republican Coinage, pp. 444, 445. The gens Plautia, sometimes written Plotia, was a plebeian family at ancient Rome. Members of this gens first appear in history in the middle of the fourth century BC, when Gaius Plautius Proculus obtained the consulship soon after that magistracy was opened to the plebeian order by the lex Licinia Sextia. Little is heard of the Plautii from the period of the Samnite Wars down to the late second century BC, but from then to imperial times they regularly held the consulship and other offices of importance.Dictionary of Greek and Roman Biography and Mythology, vol. III, p. 405 (\\"Plautia Gens\\"). In the first century AD, the emperor Claudius, whose first wife was a member of this family, granted patrician status to one branch of the Plautii. Origin The Plautii of the later Republic claimed descent from Leucon, the son of Neptune and Themisto, the daughter of Hypseus, King of the Lapiths.Hyginus, Fabulae, 157. The coins minted by Publius Plautius Hypsaeus depict Neptune and Leucon. The nomen Plautius is derived from the common Latin surname Plautus, flat-footed.Chase, pp. 109, 110. Chase classifies the name among those gentilicia that were either native to Rome, or which occurred there and cannot be shown to have originated anywhere else.Chase, pp. 129‚Äì132. However, other scholars have suggested that they may have come from Privernum, a city of southern Latium.Terrenato, \\"Private Vis, Public Virtus\\", pp. 44 ff. Several of the early Plautii appearing in the Fasti consulares carried on war against the Privernates. Praenomina The earlier Plautii mainly used the praenomina Lucius and Gaius, and occasionally Publius and Marcus. The later Plautii employed different names; the Laterani seem to have used only Aulus and Quintus, while the Silvani used Marcus and Tiberius. Branches and cognomina The only distinct family of the Plautii during the middle Republic bore the surname Venno or Venox, a hunter. Frontinus describes a story, in which Gaius Plautius, censor in 312 BC, obtained the surname Venox by discovering the springs that fed the Aqua Appia, Rome's first aqueduct.Frontinus, De Aquaeductu, i. 5. However, Venno occurs before this, and appears more often in the fasti. The first of this family to obtain the consulship bore the additional surname Hypsaeus, later spelled Ypsaeus on coins, which was evidently a personal cognomen, as it does not appear again for over a century, when this name replaces the older Venno.Dictionary of Greek and Roman Biography and Mythology, vol. II, pp. 540, 541 (\\"Hypsaeus\\"), vol. III, p. 1237 (\\"Venno\\"). Proculus, which occurs as the surname of the first Plautius to obtain the consulship, also seems to have been a personal surname; it is not apparent whether this Plautius was part of the same family as the Vennones. Proculus was an old praenomen, which the Roman antiquarians supposed to have been given to a child born when his father was far from home, although morphologically it seems to be a diminutive of Proca, a name occurring in Roman mythology as one of the Kings of Alba Longa.Chase, p. 145. Two families of Plautii were entangled in the affairs of the imperial family during the first century. The earlier of these, which first appears in the later years of the Republic, and flourished until the time of Nero, bore the surname Lateranus, at least in its later generations; this surname was probably inherited through a female line, and did not apply to the earlier members. This was the family of Aulus Plautius, the first Roman governor of Britain. The other family bore the cognomen Silvanus, originally referring to one who dwells in the forest. The imperial Plautii of the late second century may have been descended from one of these families through marriage, but were apparently descended from the Titii in the male line, and used Plautius because of its greater dignity. Many of the Plautii bore no surname; these seem to have used the alternative spelling, Plotius, more than the others.

History Skipper was born in South Australia a son of solicitor and artist John Michael Skipper (18 June 1815 ‚Äì 7 December 1883) and his wife Frances Amelia Skipper, n√©e Thomas (c. 1818 ‚Äì 27 February 1855), whose father was Robert Thomas, founding editor of the South Australian Register. His parents both emigrated to South Australia aboard and married at the end of 1839. Around January 1837 his father painted the scene of the Proclamation of South Australia, to which he had been a witness. It shows The Old Gum Tree and Gouger's tent and hut, supporting the conventional view that the bent tree is the genuine site of the ceremony. He was educated at John Lorenzo Young's Adelaide Educational Institution and studied for the Law. He was an occasional contributor to the E. R. Mitford's satirical magazine Pasquin (1867‚Äì1870), using the nom de plume \\"Unowho\\". He worked for The Portonian from 1871 to 1879 alongside John Eden Savill, better known as a racehorse owner. He joined the literary staff of The Register, and after the death of shipping reporter Richard Jagoe in 1894, he was appointed to that position, which he held until a few weeks before his death. An avid member of the Volunteer Force, he was also the unofficial reporter on the peacetime activities of South Australia's militia. He also served as the paper's arts critic. Skipper was associated with John Howard Clark, whose clever satirical column \\"Echoes from the Bush by Geoffry Crabthorn\\", which ran from 1867 to 1878, he emulated in \\"Echoes and Re-Echoes\\" in The Evening Journal and The Adelaide Observer under the nom de plume \\"Hugh Kalyptus\\" from 1882 to 1903. That pen name was from 1910 occasionally used by Adam Cairns McCay of the Sydney Sun. Skipper's memory was kept alive by his son M. G. Skipper of The Bulletin, but his adulation was undeserved according to one critic, who found his humour \\"amateurish, very thin and quite dull.

It is a registered charity. Professor Colin Leys was involved in its foundation. Research It has produced several reports on the Private finance initiative in the English NHS. It says PFI companies had made pre-tax profits of ¬£831m in the past six years which could have been spent on patient care. It warned councillors in Newham that NHS sustainability and transformation plans were untested. Its scrutiny of the role of markets and competition in the NHS found that information about quality and safety in private hospitals was not available in the same way as with NHS providers so it was not possible to compare the two. Only seven contracts with private providers had been terminated by clinical commissioning groups due to failings, though 16% of their care budget is spent in the private sector and there are some 15,000 contracts with private providers. It has also reported on Social care in England It claims that ‚Äúthe quality of care in adult social care has declined over the past two decades as a result of privatisation‚Äù. The CHPI estimates that ¬£1.5bn annually, (that is 10% of the care home industry‚Äôs ¬£15bn income), ‚Äúleaks‚Äù and often enriches owners or other firms linked closely to owners. The ¬£1.5bn is shown as rent, profit, directors‚Äô fees and debt repayments, instead of going to the care of residents. It is the same amount of money the government promised to give to social care, because of worries about the large cuts to the social care since 2010 when austerity started. The CHPI stated, ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs very difficult to find out where the ¬£15bn ends up.‚Äù Vivek Kotecha, CHPI research manager who did the above research stated, ‚ÄúSome of the largest care home businesses are extracting a lot of profit disguised as rent and loan repayment costs. This makes it hard for local authorities and individuals to know how much extra funding the industry actually needs and how financially sustainable it really is.‚Äù The CHPI cautioned that a large increase in public funds for the sector could just produce bigger profits for operators, since many firms lack financial transparency.Care home operators accused of extracting 'disguised' profits The Guardian In July 2019 it produced a study on Conflicts of Interest between the NHS and the Private Hospital sector in England. It found that more than 600 NHS doctors owned either shares or equipment or both in the private hospitals to which they referred patients. Most of the shareholding was in HCA Healthcare. In October 2019 it produced an analysis of expenditure on private providers of NHS services in England. It concluded that rather than the 7% of NHS expenditure which the government say was spent in this way in 2018-9, a fairer analysis would produce a figure of 26% - an increase of 20% over the previous year.

After education at a school in Chelsea, he apprenticed himself to a seedsman and market-gardener in Brompton. At the end of a year he left in order to study music, but finally decided on painting, and worked for some years under John Absolon, a member of the New Water Colour Society (now the Royal Institute of Painters in Water Colours). He was himself elected an associate of the society in 1847 and a member in 1849. He resigned his membership in 1853, and on 12 February 1855 was elected an associate of the Old Water Colour Society (now the Royal Watercolour Society); he became a full member on 14 June 1858 and an honorary retired member in 1897. A friend of John Linnell, Samuel Palmer, and John and Cornelius Varley, Davidson soon established a high reputation. He exhibited from 1844 to 1902 at the Old Water Colour Society (where over 800 of his works appeared), at the New Water Colour Society, the Royal Academy, the British Institution, the Royal Society of British Artists, and elsewhere. His subjects were chiefly typical English landscapes; he also worked a good deal in Wales. His Haymaking at Priory Park, Near Reigate was bought by Prince Albert as a Christmas present for Queen Victoria in 1856. On 8 December 1842 he married Ann Topham, a sister of the watercolour painter Francis William Topham.

Near the mouth of the glen, at Tower o' Ess, the Water of Tanar flows into the River Dee. This flows through Deeside into the North Sea at Aberdeen. Glen Tanar contains the third largest area of Caledonian Forest in Scotland, and is of national and European importance.Glen Tanar SSSI Site Management Statement. p. 1. 42 km2 of the glen is designated by NatureScot as a national nature reserve (NNR). Most of the area remains under private ownership as part of the Glen Tanar Estate. However 182 ha is owned by NatureScot, being designated as the \\"Strict Reserve Zone\\" of the NNR.Glen Tanar SSSI Site Management Statement. p. 4. Glen Tanar lies within the Cairngorms National Park, and is also designated as a Site of Special Scientific Interest (SSSI), a Special Protection Area (SPA), and a Special Area of Conservation. The NNR is designated a Category IV protected area by the International Union for Conservation of Nature. Glen Tanar provides the eastern walking route to Mount Keen, Scotland's most easterly Munro. Starting at the car park at the end of the public road, walkers follow the glen through the native Caledonian Forest into open moorland before crossing the river to begin the ascent. Flora and fauna Glen Tanar, along with the side glens formed by the Water of Gairney and the Water of Allachy, comprises the third largest area of Caledonian Forest in Scotland, which grows from the valley floor up to an altitude of 450 metres. As a Caledonian Forest, the predominant tree species is Scots pine, although broad-leaved tree species including birch, alder, rowan, holly, aspen and oak are also present. Juniper grows at the boundary between the forest and the open moorland above, and areas of blaeberry, heather and feather mosses can also be found. the woodland floor provides a habitat for many of the species typically found in the Caledonian Forest, including twinflower, creeping lady's-tresses, toothed wintergreen and intermediate wintergreen. Invertebrate species at Glen Tanar are representative of the Caledonian Forest. Of particular note are the rare false blister beetle, the hoverfly Callicera rufa, the bumblebee robberfly and the green hairstreak butterfly. Glen Tanar is an important site for birds, reflected in its SPA designation, which notes the breeding presence of four particular species: capercaillie, Scottish crossbill, osprey and golden eagle. The capercaillie population here is of national importance. In early 2019 visitors were asked to stay away from certain parts of the estate in order to avoid disturbing a particularly aggressive lekking capercaillie. Glen Tanar is also noted for black grouse, hen harrier, golden plover and merlin, and is probably the most important site for the Scottish crossbill, a species endemic to Scotland. Mammal species at Glen Tanar include red squirrel, Scottish wildcat and otter, and the river system is important for atlantic salmon.Glen Tanar SSSI Site Management Statement. p. 2. History Glen Tanar was historically part of the lands of the Marquis of Huntly. In 1865 the estate was bought by William Cunliffe Brooks, an English barrister and merchant banker who in 1869 was elected as Conservative MP for East Cheshire. Brooks had a major influence on the estate, building a large house, cottages for estate workers, a school, stables, and kennels, as well as constructing several bridges and landscaping the gardens. He also installed numerous carved stones and memorials in the surrounding countryside, many of which make playful references to his name or celebrate the virtues of drinking water rather than alcohol.Fouin, F L P (2009) 'Glen Tanar - valley of echoes and hidden treasures' (Leopard Press, Aberdeen) In 1905 the estate was bought by George Coats, owner of the Paisley based thread manufacturer J & P Coats Ltd. In 1916 Coats was raised to the peerage as Baron Glentanar, and the estate remains in the ownership of his descendants. Timber has been extracted from the woodlands at Glen Tanar for at least 250 years, with the earliest record of a sawmill dating from 1732. The rate of felling increased during the Victorian period, and this, combined with an increase in deer and livestock numbers on the estate, hampered the natural regeneration of the forest. The forest avoided the heavily felling that affected other woods on Deeside woods during the Great War, and in 1937 deer fencing was erected to allow natural regeneration of the forest.Glen Tanar SSSI Site Management Statement. p. 3. During the 1950s and 60s some areas were planted with non-native conifers, but these are now being gradually removed. Seasonal grazing of cattle ceased in the 1990s,Glen Tanar SSSI Site Management Statement. p. 4. and a section of the deer fence was removed in 1996. The forest is now allowed to regenerate naturally, with deer numbers being controlled by culling. The reduction in pressure on the forestry has also allowed trees to spread onto areas of the adjoining moorland.

Three examples were completed. Design and development Bourgois-S√©n√©maud AT.1 photo from Aero Digest December 1929 Bernard Bourgois was a well-known French coachbuilder who became interested in light aircraft construction in the later 1920s and turned to the established aircraft designer S√©n√©maud to realise his ideas. The result was the Bourgois- S√©n√©maud AT, an attractive aircraft of clean design, high build quality and comfort. Its parasol wing was in two symmetric parts and had a trapezoidal plan with gentle taper and squared-off tips. It tapered strongly in thickness, particularly on the underside, increasing the dihedral to about 2.5¬∞ at mean thickness. Each half-wing had two spruce box spars and was covered with stressed plywood. The ailerons were unusually narrow and long, filling the whole trailing edge. In addition to their usual differential action, they could be used together as flaps to alter the camber. The wing was held high above the fuselage on pairs of parallel struts, without wire bracing, from the principal fuselage frames at mid-fuselage to the wing spars at about 45% span. The centre-section was joined by a cabane of three inverted V-struts from the upper fuselage, one vertical and one backward-leaning to the forward spar and the other, vertical, to the rear. The first AT, known as the AT.35 was powered by a nose-mounted , three-cylinder Anzani 3A2 radial engine. The fuselage was built around a triangular section girder which provided a backbone on which transverse frames were mounted to define the ovoid section, ply-skinned exterior. There were two tandem seats in open cockpits with windscreens, the passenger placed below the wing at the centre of gravity and the pilot behind just under the trailing edge. Two starboard-side doors eased access. The fuselage tapered both in plan and particularly in profile, allowing the AT's large-area, short-span tailplane to be attached to the top of the internal girder. Its separate elevators were narrow and constant-chord. Like the tailplane, the fin had a swept leading edge and squared-off top. It carried a narrow-chord rudder which ran down to the keel, working in the gap between the elevators. The control surfaces were unbalanced. Its undercarriage was fixed and conventional, with a track of . Each main wheel was mounted on a hinged steel cranked axle and a backward-reaching drag strut, both from the central fuselage underside. A longer, telescopic strut to mid-fuselage containing rubber rings acted as a shock absorber, though oleo struts could be fitted instead. There was a spring-steel tailskid. The AT.35 first flew in 1928 and was displayed at the Paris Salon in mid-summer. By the following spring the Anzani engine had been replaced by a Salmson 9Ad nine-cylinder radial and the aircraft consequentially redesignated as the AT.40 or as the AT.1. Deckert flew it for the first time on 18 April 1929; it was about heavier than the AT.35 but some faster. Operational history The AT.1 had completed its certification by September 1929. In April 1930 Deckert gave an aerobatic display at Orly. In May it was flown from there by its new owner Robert David to his home in Marseille, a trip which took 7 hr 15 min including a stop at Dijon. At the end of October 1930 he advertised it for sale, having flown a total of 35 hr. It went to the Provencale aero club but by May 1932 they, too, had put it up for sale. Two more AT.1s were built but their histories are not known; only one Bourgois appears on reconstructed French civil aircraft registers, Robert David's F-AJIM, noted as a Bourgois-Senemaud 10, c/n.3 Variants ;AT.35: Original aircraft with Anzani engine.

The residents abandoned the partly Ciskei government-owned Ciskei Transport Corporation (CTC) buses for taxis and trains. On 4 August 1983, the Ciskei police tried to prevent residents from taking the train at Egerton train station in Mdantsane. After hesitating, the crowd advanced a few paces. However, as the police drew their guns, the people stopped. Without warning, the police fired into the crowd killing 11 and injuring 36 commuters, leading to what is now known as the Egerton railway station bus boycott massacre, the Mdantsane bus boycott massacre, the Egerton massacre, and similar terms. Background The Egerton massacre occurred in the then Ciskei township of Mdantsane 20 kilometres outside East London. An attitude survey run by the white apartheid South African government conducted in Mdantsane in July 1981 found that 70% of all the working class respondents identified transport as their most serious problem. 80% of Mdantsane's workers used buses to go to work while 15% used the trains and 5% went to work by car. The bus company, which catered for commuters travelling between East London and Mdantsane, was Ciskei Transport Corporation (CTC). The company was co-owned by the Ciskei State and the Economic Development Corporation. In 1980, the South African Allied Workers Union (SAAWU) held meetings around Mdantsane to hear workers' grievances around transport services. SAAWU drew up four demands from the workers in Mdantsane: *1) The provision of bus shelters *2) The provision of tickets that could only be invalidated by the ticket clippers *3) Students and pensioners should pay half price *4) Cushions should be put on the cold wooden benches. These demands were ignored by the Ciskei Transport Corporation. This increased tension between the bus company and commuters. Bus boycott On 13 July 1983, the Ciskei Transport Corporation introduced an 11% (50 cent) bus fare increase on the route between East London and Mdantsane. The issue had been discussed amongst the organised workers and members of the political organisations in the preceding weeks. A meeting with 1000 people was held in a church hall in Duncan Village on 10 July 1983. A committee of ten workers known as the \\"Committee of Ten\\" was elected to represent the community's interests to the CTC. The Committee of Ten tried to meet CTC management on Monday 11 July. The CTC refused on the grounds that they had already talked to community leaders two months before the increases were announced. A second mass meeting was held on 12 July in Duncan Village. About 3000 people attended. The CTC responses were unanimously rejected and a decision was taken to boycott the buses. On 18 July, the bus boycott began. The commuters initially walked to work in large groups, from Mdantsane across the Ciskei border to East London, a distance of about twenty kilometres. On its second day, the boycott attracted over 80% of the bus commuters. The number of police soon increased as reinforcements were brought in, and they became more brutal. This made walking in large numbers on the open road too dangerous. People began to use the trains. The railway, which formed Ciskei's border with the rest of South Africa, was run by the South African Transport Services and located on the outskirts of Mdantsane. The train fares were marginally lower than the bus fares and provided a space for commuters to discuss issues affecting the community. The train fares increased on 1 August 1983 but the commuters continued to use trains. The bus boycott received a negative response from the Ciskei government. Security forces and vigilantes set up roadblocks in Mdantsane, and there were reports of commuters being hauled out of taxis and ordered onto buses. On 22 July 1983, five people were shot and wounded by Ciskei security forces at the Fort Jackson railway station. On 30 July, a man was attacked and killed by vigilantes while walking near the Mdantsane stadium, which was used by vigilantes as a base. On 3 August, a state of emergency was declared in Mdantsane and a night curfew imposed. Meetings of more than four people were banned and people were prohibited from walking in groups larger than four. The massacre The Ciskei government police and soldiers formed an armed human blockade at the Fort Jackson, Mount Ruth and Ergeton stations to prevent commuters from catching the train on 4 August 1983. The commuters moved a few paces forward. The police drew their guns and the people stopped. Without warning the police fired into the crowd. 11 people lost their lives and 36 were injured. The soldiers prevented people from going into the hospital's casualty ward to find the dead. The Ciskei government intensified its security measures, arresting 700 people in a week. By the end of August 1983, over 1000 people were in jail.  Aftermath The massacre led to banning of the South African Allied Workers Union. Eleven out of twelve schools in Mdantsane were closed in protest against the massacre. On 24 September 2013,former South African deputy president Kgalema Motlanthe unveiled the upgraded Egerton Bus Boycott Massacre Memorial Site. The boycott lasted until 15 March 1985, when it was called off at a mass meeting held by the Committee of Ten.

With its creation, the birth of such a medium of communication in the country takes place. It is part of the Sistema Nacional de Televisi√≥n (SNT) and is also its base station. History Its beginnings On September 29, 1965, Channel 9 TV Cerro Cor√°, of Asunci√≥n, Paraguay, began its official transmissions, after successive stages of testing. Its first program was the inauguration of its transmitting plant. The broadcast began at 19:00 hours and was narrated by the speaker Ricardo Sanabria, who in that way became the first speaker whose voice was heard in the few existing television sets. On the night of the inauguration, a documentary on the benefits of television, reported by Rodolfo Schaerer Peralta, was issued. The antenna, the transmitter and a corridor that served as a temporary study, were on the roof of the building of the Institute of Social Security, or IPS, on the corner of Pettirossi and Constituci√≥n. Argentinean technicians trained the Paraguayan personnel. Carlos Mor√≠nigo and Edith Victoria Ruiz D√≠az, with only 16 years, were the first announcers in off (camera) to which Carmen Diaz Fares de Sanabria, Pablo R. Ben√≠tez, Vidalia Cristaldo de Delgado and Edgar Von Lucken soon joined. In the first live commercial appeared Edith Victoria, on the roof of the building, who soon joined the reader of the first 5-minute newscast, Nelson Garc√≠a Ram√≠rez. Edith was also a pioneer in children's television programs. It used a corridor of one meter of width by five meters of length, located at the end of the stairs that took to the roof. The first program of horoscopes was carried out by a Paraguayan astrologer, who was raised after his first broadcast, because of the difficulties the driver had to speak on camera. He was replaced by Argentine coach H√©ctor Moyano, who said that he had done astrology studies in Buenos Aires and that he performed with the name \\"Karim Gestal\\". In April 1966, the first formal study was enabled in an office room on the 7th floor. To the initial five-minute news produced by the Canal, where only news was read on camera, others were added that used support films: \\"Sucesos Paraguayos\\", produced by Prisciliano Sandoval and \\"Paraguay al d√≠a\\" by Alfredo Lacasa Arellano. Foreign series occupied the programming broadcast in nocturnal hours: Bat Masterson, Los Acuanautas, Lassie and Los Flintstones. Then came the national programs and the first idols of Paraguayan television. Edith Victoria and her sister Dorita Rudy were conducting the successful \\"Tele Nueve Club\\", where an infant Manuel Cuenca was working as an assistant, only 9 years old. The first stars were born as Carmen Maida, Felicita Matosh, Sarita Rivas Crovato, Charles Gonz√°lez Paliza. The first sports program was in charge of Jaime Arditi. They were famous \\"The Show of Jacinto Herrera\\"; The \\"Jueves de Gala\\", with Mercedes Jan√© and Mario Prono, \\"Looking for the letter\\", with Carmen Maida and Rodolfo Schaerer Peralta. After the news broadcast on the channel's roof terrace, a longer one was broadcast from the first formal study of Channel 9. They led H√©ctor Vel√°zquez and Susana Ib√°√±ez Rojas. Some news was filmed in 16mm mute film, in black and white and were reported on the images, live, from the studio. He entered as editor V√≠ctor Bobouth Ch√°vez, who years later conducted the \\"Noticiero del Mediod√≠a\\", next to Flora Gim√©nez. Transmission Schedule The transmission started at 17:00. He then moved at 12:00 under the leadership of brothers Arturo and Humberto Rubin, and his wife, Gloria Godoy. Also was Armando Rubin, pioneer of the teleteatros, live. Videotape In 1966 comes the first professional team of videotape, starting to broadcast Argentine soap operas, among them the popular \\"Simply Maria\\". Although it could already be recorded locally, the equipment of video tape was of great size, weight and electrical requirements, without being able to move of the study. Argentine telenovelas, (Desperately Living and Simply Maria) were already on the air in 1967. Microwave connection With the arrival of the first microwave equipment, national programs were broadcast from abroad, both live and recorded, with their subsequent broadcast. First Paraguayan telenovela American series, Argentine, Mexican and Brazilian telenovelas were transmitted. The first live teleteatro was \\"Una noche en familia\\", which was broadcast in central hours in 1966. They were Mario Prono, Mercedes and Stella Maris Jan√© and Luis D'Oliveira, with twelve years of age. In 1967, the Uruguayan Nelson Nelson directed several teletreatros live, in hours of the noon. They had the performance of Armando Rubin, Carla Fabri, Zuny Joy, Patricia Blasco, Juan Angel G√≥mez and others. In 1978, the first telenovela was recorded in video \\"Magdalena de la Calle\\". It was recorded in natural settings such as the Ricardo Brugada Neighborhood (La Chacarita) and the Yguaz√∫ Restaurant in Asunci√≥n, in black and white.

Bernard was the son of Laurent Bernard, a butcher, and grandson of Pierre Bernard, a restaurant owner. His mother‚Äôs family traded faience. He trained as a chef by working in the kitchen of Vivian Jacquinot‚Äôs restaurant in Lons-le-Saunier. He then moved to Turin to work in the kitchen of his uncle, before serving as a kitchen aid in a renowned hotel in Genoa, where he was spotted and hired by the governor of the city. He also traveled to Rome, Paris and Russia, where he met fellow chef Urbain Dubois. His long and successful career at the service of kings and princes make him the greatest connoisseur of European crowned heads‚Äô favoured tastes and cuisines. After working for the general Count Krasinski, governor of Warsaw, in the early 1850s, he worked in the kitchen of the French Foreign Affairs Ministry. Bernard was later appointed personal chef to King William I of Prussia, later Kaiser, for whom he had cooked during a state visit to Lyon. He was most notably in charge of the King‚Äôs coronation banquet at K√∂nigsberg Castle in January 1861. Nonetheless, as he remained ‚ÄúFran√ßais de coeur‚Äù, when the war broke out between Prussia and France in 1870, Bernard left his position to return to his native land of Jura, where he established his final residency in the Ch√¢teau des Buvettes. Bernard was a precursor in introducing service √† la russe in France in the second half of the nineteenth century. In contrast to service √† la fran√ßaise, where the meals were prepared and laid on the table before hand, service √† la russe introduced a new manner of dining which involved courses being prepared, carved and plated in the kitchen and sent out sequentially whilst still hot. Bernard also wrote together with friend and fellow chef, Urbain Dubois, who he had met in Russia, the nineteenth century classic La Cuisine classique, √©tudes pratiques, raisonn√©es et d√©monstratives de l'√©cole fran√ßaise appliqu√©e au service √† la Russe (1856)[http://gallica.bnf.fr/services/engine/search/sru?operation=searchRetrieve&version;=1.2&collapsing;=disabled&rk;=21459;2&query;=%28dc.title%20all%20%22La%20cuisine%20classique%22%29%20and%20dc.relation%20all%20%22cb303595296%22# , which was reedited a dozen times up until the beginning of the twentieth century.

To this end, searx does not share users' IP addresses or search history with the search engines from which it gathers results. Tracking cookies served by the search engines are blocked, preventing user-profiling-based results modification. By default, searx queries are submitted via HTTP POST, to prevent users' query keywords from appearing in webserver logs. searx was inspired by the Seeks project, though it does not implement Seeks' peer-to- peer user-sourced results ranking. Each search result is given as a direct link to the respective site, rather than a tracked redirect link as used by Google. In addition, when available, these direct links are accompanied by \\"cached\\" and/or \\"proxied\\" links that allow viewing results pages without actually visiting the sites in question. The \\"cached\\" links point to saved versions of a page on archive.org, while the \\"proxied\\" links allow viewing the current live page via a searx-based web proxy. In addition to the general search, the engine also features tabs to search within specific domains: files, images, IT, maps, music, news, science, social media, and videos. There are many public user-run searx instances, some of which are available as Tor hidden services. \\"Meta-searx\\" sites query a different random instance with each search. A public API is available for searx, as well as Firefox search provider plugins.  Search engines and other settings  Across all categories, searx can fetch search results from about 82 different engines. This includes major search engines and site-specific searches like Bing, Google, Reddit, Wikipedia, Yahoo, and Yandex. The engines used for each search category can be set via a \\"preferences\\" interface, and these settings will be saved in a cookie in the user's browser, rather than on the server side, since for privacy reasons, searx does not implement a user login model. Other settings such as the search interface language and the search results language (over 20 languages are available) can be set the same way. In addition to the preferences cookie, it is possible on each query to modify the engines used, search categories selected, and/or languages to search in by specifying one or more of the following textual search operators before the search keywords. * \`!category\` ‚Äî Search the specified category instead of the default ones. * \`?category\` ‚Äî Search the specified category in addition to the default ones. * \`!engine\` ‚Äî Search the specified engine instead of the default ones. * \`?engine\` ‚Äî Search the specified engine in addition to the default ones. * \`:language\` ‚Äî Search for results in the specified language instead of the default one. The \`!\` and \`?\` operators can be specified more than once to select multiple categories or engines, for example \`!google !deviantart ?images :japanese cow\`.  Instances  Any user may run their own instance of searx, which can be done to maximize privacy, to avoid congestion on public instances, to preserve customized settings even if browser cookies are cleared, to allow auditing of the source code being run, etc. Users may include their searx instances on the editable list of all public instances, or keep them private. It is also possible to add custom search engines to a self- hosted instance that are not available on the public instances. Another reason to use different searx instances, and/or to run one's own, is that as of 2019, Google has begun to block some instances, including some of the IP addresses used by searx.me (former instance run by the developer), from querying it, resulting in a \\"google (unexpected crash: CAPTCHA required)\\" error.

The newspaper is bilingual in character though principally written in Spanish with some articles in Basque. Deia is the main product of the Editorial Iparraguirre S.A. (EISA). Although their initial objective was to cover news in the whole of Pa√≠s Vasco, they actually have as their tag line Noticias de Bizkaia, as their principle market is in Vizcaya, where they are the second largest newspaper in the city.'Deia' (88.000) lectores diarios - 15 de abril de 2012 Deia is part of the newspaper group Grupo Noticias, which includes several other Spanish newspapers including Diario de Noticias in Navarra, Noticias de Gipuzkoa in Guip√∫zcoa and Noticias de √Ålava en √Ålava.  History  Deia, together with other publications by their publishing company, was created by the Partido Nacionalista Vasco with the objective of providing news for moderates in Basque nationalist movement. Among its early the promoters and founders were nationalists like Mitxel Unzueta, Luzio Aginagalde, Luis Mar√≠a Retolaza and Eli Gald√≥s. The first edition was published on 8 June 1977, with Ignacio Iriarte Areso serving as their first director. Their first sub-editors were Alfonso Ventura, Mart√≠n Ugalde, and F√©lix Garc√≠a Olano. Manuel Igarreta and Fernando M√∫gica served as the first editors-in-chief.La prensa escrita en Euskadi , Hiru.com The first edition was published with extraordinary speed, only three months after the founding of their parent organization Editorial Iparraguirre. Founded on 21 March 1977 with an initial capital investment of 40 million pesetas, they started with 25 founding members in their organization. Months later, they increased their initial capital through a series of popular subscription offers and by adding 600 shareholders. Two conditions assisted in the speed of their launch. The first was the first democratic elections in Spain, which were scheduled to be held on 15 June 1977. The second was that two other Basque nationalist societies, \\"Orain\\" and \\"Ardatza\\", were already working to create left leaning nationalist newspapers. Deia wanted to and did become the first Basque nationalist newspaper published inpost-Franco Spain. Among Deia's founding principles were the highlighting of timely and accurate information as well as focusing on news about individual and collective human rights, promoting solidarity of Basque society, defending Basque tradition, culture, language, politics, social life and family, alongside the promotion of the coexistence of its inhabitants within democratic institutions. Although at an early stage Deia assumed the daily role of unifying of all current opinions that opposed the dictatorship, their lack of definition made the daily newspaper seek a closer identification with the moderate Basque nationalists, represented publicly by the Partido Nacionalista Vasco.

It is included in the Inventory of the Architectural Heritage of Catalonia.  Description  Ca la Pruna is built on a rocky base and, therefore, adapted to the unevenness of the terrain. The building consists of ground floor, two upper floors and roof tile.  History  \\"Ca la Pruna\\" is the current name of Mas Illa, one of the most important houses in the medieval and modern history of Pals. The members of the Illa family appear documented in the early 15th century, linked to the cultivation and commercialization of rice. In fact, old documents reveal the existence of a rice mill on the ground floor of the farmhouse. The building was burned during the First Carlist War (1833) and significantly altered by the restoration of the 1970s. In spite of this, remains of low-medieval walls and different enlargements of the 16th-18th centuries are still visible. The building was purchased by three neighbors of Pals (Antoni Vila Casas, Francesc Jover and Xavier Millet Tusell) who donated it to the municipality as a Culture House.  Ca la Pruna - Culture Museum  Once the building was acquired by the Town Hall of Pals, the Ca la Pruna Culture Museum was created as a cultural center where several activities are organized. Currently, it offers the permanent exhibition \\"Viure a pag√®s\\", which shows a selection of the pieces related with the countryside. In this way, the exhibition contains a wide variety of farm tools, measures and weights, and it explains the use that was given to animals, the rooms of a Catalan farmhouse, etc. In addition, in summer, it hosts various exhibitions of painting, sculpture, ceramics ... and during the winter different cultural activities are organized such as conferences, courses, cinema, meetings of other social entities.

Early life Henry Church was born on 3 January 1880, in Brooklyn, New York. He came from an old New England family, one of his ancestors having come to America on the Mayflower. His father James A. Church was a pharmacist at the family firm of Church and Dwight, which owned exclusive rights to the sale of bicarbonate of soda in the United States, marketing it as \\"baking soda\\" under the brand name Arm & Hammer.Claire Paulhan, \\"Henry Church and the literary magazine Mesures\\", in C. Benfey and K. Remmler, eds., Artists, Intellectuals, and World War II, U. Massachusetts Press, 2006, p. 89 ff. Henry Church would inherit money, estimated at US $90 million in today's dollars, which would later enable him to quit the family business and dedicate himself to writing and patronage of the arts. Young adulthood Church first went to Europe in 1901 to study, living in Munich, Geneva and Paris. He returned to the U.S. in 1905. He then married and had a daughter. He returned to Europe again in 1910, living in Paris until 1912. On his third return to Europe in 1921 he was accompanied by his second wife Barbara, who was born in Bavaria and whose father was a wealthy coal merchant. Henry and Barbara settled into a large villa in Ville-d'Avray, a posh suburb of Paris¬´Church et Barbara Church recevaient magnifiquement dans leur villa augment√©e d‚Äôune vigne en serre o√π volaient des mouches √† miel, quelque part dans le d√©partement de Seine-et- Oise. Sans que personne ne f√ªt malade chez eux, ils avaient des infirmi√®res au lieu de domestiques, et c‚Äô√©tait un sentiment bien agr√©able pour les visiteurs de voir ces infirmi√®res en nombre, prendre soin d‚Äôeux d√©j√† sur le gravier lorsqu‚Äôarrivaient les voitures. Enfin se faire servir des ap√©ritifs par des infirmi√®res est quelque chose d‚Äôunique. Church et Barbara Church r√©alisaient l‚Äôunique¬ª , Voyage de Saint-Gall √† Ouchy in Cahiers du Sud, April 1943., which was composed of three older houses reconstructed and redesigned by the modernist architect Le Corbusier. They dabbled in art collecting and literary patronage, including the publication of Church's own work, written in French. However, Church soon felt he was being taken advantage of, and eventually he hired a financial advisor to help structure his further patronage of the arts. 1930s In the 1930s, Henry met the influential Paris editor Jean Paulhan, who at that time was the editor in chief of the Nouvelle Revue Fran√ßaise (NRF). Church enabled Paulhan to found his own literary journal, Mesures, a quarterly that ran from 1935 to 1940. Church officially edited Mesures (to avoid giving Paulhan the appearance of a conflict with the NRF), but Paulhan secretly recommended all the contributions and directed the editorial work. Church nonetheless had an active role in the selection committee.Jean Paulhan wrote a posthumous homage to Church, \\"L'Ecole de la Modestie\\", published in the April 1948 special reissue of Mesures that was produced in memory of Church.The staff and contributors of Mesures are profiled on the French website revues-litteraires.com, and the table of contents for each issue is given. Mesures did not sell well, and in 1938 Church noted in a letter to Paulhan that each issue cost 30,000 francs to produce but produced an income of only 1,000 francs. Henri Michaux, a member of the journal's selection committee, wrote to Paulhan in 1939: > Why don't you finally lay out the truth for Mr. Church, who claims to be > seeking it? Tell him the reason his magazine doesn't sell is that it's > boring. There are never any surprizes. And if for once someone submits > something amusing, even something uniquely amusing, you see the result [i.e. > rejection by Church]. But in spite of this criticism Paulhan was proud of the journal and for example in 1937, its third year, he wrote in a letter: > It seems to me that I can be proud of Mesures; it is the handsomest magazine > in Europe. Maybe its positions are a little inflexible, but they are never > low. Maybe it is a bit esoteric, but no review of pure literature can avoid > being so from time to time. The truth is that the journals and little > magazines of Geneva, Brussels, London, and New York often say that Mesures > does honor to France; the French press, however, says this sort of thing > more seldom. Later life On July 11, 1939, the Churches left France for America in order to flee World War II. They took up residence in the Plaza hotel in New York. Mesures continued to publish, with Henry's support, until the German invasion closed the printing press they had been using. The last issue came out in April 1940. Church also subsidized some of the contributors to Mesures during the war years, for as long as money continued to circulate between the U.S. and occupied France. Church and Wallace Stevens then tried to persuade Paulhan to move to the United States, discussing the possibility of Church funding a chair in poetry at Harvard University to which they proposed to nominate Paulhan. The plan was never realized, however.Andrew Goldstone, \\"Fictions of Autonomy: Modernism from Wilde to de Man\\", Oxford University Press, 2013, p. 167. Church then contributed to the Creative Arts Program at Princeton University. One of his contributions was to fund a series of lectures, at which Wallace Stevens read a piece which gave rise to his long poem \\"Notes Towards a Supreme Fiction\\" (1942), which is dedicated to Church. Although Church wrote poetry himself, he never shared it with Stevens. The Churches returned to Paris in 1946, finding their villa in bad condition after having been occupied by German troops. They returned to New York in early 1947, where Henry died unexpectedly on Good Friday (that year April 4), of a heart attack. His death prompted Wallace Stevens to write the poem \\"The Owl in the Sarcophagus\\".

He set the wordless works for choir a cappella. The songs were published in 1920 and first performed in 1921.  History  Delius composed the songs at Grez-sur-Loing in 1917. He set them for six-part choir, SATTBB, without words, but vocalises on the syllable \\"uh\\". The first song is marked \\"slow but not dragging\\", the other which features a solo tenor is marked \\"gaily, but not quick\\". A reviewer noted that especially the first song is an example of his \\"chromatic harmonic language\\". The wordless pieces have been described as among the composer's \\"most transcendently ecstatic moments ... as if no words could adequately convey the peculiar fullness of the moment\\". Only the title serves as a program for the \\"gratuitous blithesomeness of these two brief yet beguiling choral pieces\\". The songs were premiered in London by Charles Kennedy Scott and his Oriana Madrigal Society in London on 28 June 1921. They were first published in London by Winthrop Rogers in 1920, printed again by Boosey & Hawkes, after 1930. They appear in volume 17 of the Collected edition of the composer's works. The music was arranged for string orchestra by Eric Fenby in 1932, titles Two Aquarelles. The songs were chosen by the BBC Singers to celebrate their 70th anniversary, recorded at London's St Paul's Church, Knightsbridge, in 1994, conducted by Simon Joly. The Birmingham Conservatoire Chamber Choir, conducted by Paul Spicer, recorded them in 2017 on an album Partsongs by John Ireland and Frederick Delius, in memory of the composer's 150th anniversary of birth.

The name Bie≈Ñczyce comes from a village of same name that is now a part of the district. According to the Central Statistical Office data, the district's area is and 42 633 people inhabit Bie≈Ñczyce.  History  The name Bie≈Ñczyce comes from the owner of the village named Bie≈Ñ (Benedykt). It is mentioned for the first time in documents in 1224. The village belonged first to the Church of St Michael the Archangel and St Stanislaus Bishop, and from 1317 to the Church of St. Florian. In 1391, the first mill on D≈Çubnia River was built in the village. The other mill from 1449 was being powered by the existing millrace to the 21st century. In the second half of the 15th century, a manor house with a farm was built in the village (today, at Kacze≈Ñcowa Street, a manor house and an outbuilding from the beginning of the 20th century have been preserved in the neighborhood of the pond). Later, the village of Bie≈Ñczyce constituted the property of the canons of the Wawel Cathedral. After the Second Partition of Poland, the village was confiscated by the partitioning Austrian powers. In the 19th century, the Austrians led the road, and followingly, a railway line constructed from 1899 until 1900, that ran through Bie≈Ñczyce to Kocmyrz√≥w. The existence of the railway line is still evident to the preserved remains of tracks, the remains of two railway bridges over the D≈Çubnia River and its mill and the preserved building of the railway station Bie≈Ñczyce. The village belonged to the parish in Raciborowice. There was a small chapel in Bie≈Ñczyce, a branch of the parish church. One of the recognizable inhabitants of the village was Franciszek Ptak, a rich peasant and innkeeper, politician of the Polish People's Party and member of the Diet of Galicia and Lodomeria, who co-financed the construction of \\"Falcon\\" Polish Gymnastic Society House and the public school in Bie≈Ñczyce in the first decade of the 20th century. In 1949, the construction of the city of Nowa Huta began in the eastern part of the village. In 1951, the village was attached together with the new city to Krak√≥w as one of the Nowa Huta estates. In the years 1967‚Äì1977 a modern temple of Our Lady Queen of Poland was established, called the Ark of the Lord. It was the first church built within one of the housing estates of Nowa Huta, not on its outskirts ‚Äì mainly thanks to the efforts of Bishop Karol Wojty≈Ça and residents.Tygodnik Powszechny, 2010, issue 37, pp. 30‚Äì31.

It is also the name of the surrounding area. History and etymology Dao Khanong roughly translates as 'swaggering star'. It is named after the Khlong (canal) Dao Khanong, which runs through the area and is regarded as the right tributary of Chao Phraya River, which connects the Chao Phraya River with Khlong Bang Khun Thian in the Bang Khun Thian, Chom Thong and Rat Burana areas. Khlong Dao Khanong is regarded as one of the most bustling water transport routes in Bangkok, because it is a tourist route. There are several theories about the area's name. All believe that it originates from the Mon people and Mon language, because of the numerous Mon population in the area. There are many buildings and neighbourhoods that have Mon roots, such as Wat Nang Nong, or tambon Song Khanong in Phra Pradaeng District, Samut Prakan Province (across the Chao Phraya River). In addition, there is a legend about two crocodiles fighting in this area, hence the name Dang Khanong ['crocodiles's swagger'], later distorted to Dao Khanong. Dao Khanong was mentioned in \\"Nirat Mueang Klaeng\\" (‡∏ô‡∏¥‡∏£‡∏≤‡∏®‡πÄ‡∏°‡∏∑‡∏≠‡∏á‡πÅ‡∏Å‡∏•‡∏á), the travelogue poetry by the poet Sunthorn Phu in the early- Rattanakosin period.

Overview The area is renowned for its fossils, with The Etches Collection in the village of Kimmeridge displaying fossils found locally by Steve Etches over a 30-year period, especially on the Kimmeridge Ledges when exposed at low tide. The Kimmeridge Ledges form part of the Jurassic Coast, a World Heritage Site. The coast is also part of a Site of Special Scientific Interest, and the whole area is part of the Dorset Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty, with a rich sea life. Kimmeridge is the type locality for Kimmeridge clay, the geological formation that covers most of the area. Within the clay are bands of bituminous shale. St Alban's Head can be viewed to the southeast. Forming the cliffs above the Kimmeridge Ledges are (west to east) Hen Cliff, Cuddle, Clavell's Hard, and Rope Lake Head. To the north is Smedmore House and to the northeast is imposing hill Swyre Head. Geology The geology of the area around Kimmeridge Ledges is important as part of the Jurassic Coast World Heritage Site. It comprises bedrock formed in the Late Jurassic epoch, overlain in many places by superficial Quaternary head deposits. Kimmeridge gives its name to the Kimmeridgian, the division of the Jurassic period in which the beds were laid down, because of the quality of the cliffs and the fossils they yield. Kimmeridge is also the type locality for the Jurassic age Kimmeridge Clay formation, which is well represented in southern England, and provides one of the source rocks for hydrocarbons found in the Wessex and North Sea Basins.

It opened on 10 August 1847 and served nearby Thorp Arch as well as Boston Spa. The station closed to passengers on 6 January 1964 and completely on 10 August 1964.  Location and facilities  Thorp Arch station was located north of the level crossing with Church Causeway between the villages of Thorp Arch and Walton. The station building was designed by George Townsend Andrews in the Gothic revival style. The two- storey stationmaster's house is immediately adjacent. The size of the building and its representative appearance are due to the popularity of nearby Boston Spa, and the latter was the reason for the station called Thorp Arch (Boston Spa) until 1961. There were two side platforms. North of station was the goods yard with a long loop serving a cattle dock, a short siding through the goods shed, and another siding with an end dock. From the latter, two sidings branched off to the coal drops. The signal box stood on the up side south of the level crossing.  Serving the Royal Ordnance Factory  Construction of the Thorp Arch Royal Ordnance Factory began in February 1940. Initially, all building materials were delivered to Thorp Arch station. On 24 June 1940 new sidings were opened nearer to the factory. The platforms of Thorp Arch station were extended in June 1941 on order to cope with the increasing passenger traffic. Later, a railway loop with four stations was built around the factory, which joined the Harrogate‚ÄìChurch Fenton line by means of two junctions south of Thorp Arch station.  Current situation  The station building with the stationmaster's house and the down platform are still existing, the building has only undergone few external alterations and is used as private residence. The up platform is demolished. The goods shed is also preserved, and remains of the coal drops are still in place. The station building and the goods shed (mistakenly referred to as \\"engine shed\\") were listed as Grade II in February 1988.

Clennell married a British man in 1990 and received indefinite leave to remain status. However, as she spent extended periods in Singapore with her husband, and later alone caring for her parents, her status was revoked. Clennell's applications for a new visa were rejected and in January 2017, Clennell was detained for one month and then deported to Singapore. Campaigners took up her case as symbolic of the wider problems with the Home Office's immigration crackdown and agitated for her to be allowed to return. In August 2017, the Home Office approved a new visa for Clennell and allowed her to return to the UK. Background Clennell was born in Singapore (then a part of Malaysia) in 1964. Her father, a former soldier who had served alongside the British Army following the Second World War, inspired in her a strong attachment to the United Kingdom, and in 1988 she moved to the UK and worked as a hotel receptionist in Lancaster Gate, London. There she met John Clennell, whom she married in 1990. The couple moved to Ouston, County Durham, and had two children. As the spouse of a British citizen, Clennell was entitled to indefinite leave to remain. However, this status is voided if the holder spends more than two years outside the country. The Clennells moved to Singapore in 1992 after John got a job in the country, and Irene remained to care for her dying mother after her husband and sons left. After returning to the UK for a time, she travelled back to Singapore in 2001 to deal with her old flat in the country. On return, Clennell was given only a visitor visa, and her applications to renew her permanent status were denied. Clennell was therefore forced to leave the UK in 2005. Subsequent applications for residency were also denied, and in 2007, despite holding a valid visitor visa, Clennell was stopped at the UK border and forced to return to Singapore without seeing her family. Clennell remained in Singapore to care for her father, who had cancer, and then lived for several years in India. A 2012 application for leave to remain was denied because Clennell could not provide sufficient proof of contact with her family, but with a new visitor visa, Clennell was allowed to re-enter the UK in 2013. She became the primary carer for her husband, who was ill and had recently had to give up his job, but as he could not make the recently-introduced ¬£18,600 earning threshold for a spousal visa, her application was once again denied. 2017 deportation and return While her application was processed, Clennell was given leave to remain, incumbent on signing in regularly at the immigration reporting centre at Middlesbrough. On one routine visit on 19 January 2017, Clennell was detained and taken to Dungavel Immigration Removal Centre in Scotland. On 26 February, Clennell was taken from Dungavel and put on a flight to Singapore, with only the clothes she was wearing when she was detained and ¬£12 in cash. Clennell's case was reported worldwide, and opposition politicians came to her defence. The Shadow Home Secretary Diane Abbott described Clennell's treatment as \\"brutal and unfair\\", noting that women are traditionally expected to care for relatives and are disproportionately caught out in such cases. Brian Paddick, the Liberal Democrat Home Affairs spokesperson, said \\"this case highlights the complete irrationality and inhumanity of our immigration system\\" and his successor Ed Davey, told BuzzFeed UK that: \\"The Home Office's immigration arm is plagued by errors, delays, and poor decision-making. Cases like that of Irene's remind us of the real human damage caused by this incompetence.\\" The Home Office did not comment on Clennell's case, but said, \\"We expect those with no legal right to remain in the country to leave\\". Clennell's case also captured public interest: a survey by YouGov found that 63% of those questioned thought the government was wrong to deport Clennell, versus 17% who thought it was right. A GoFundMe crowdfunding campaign raised ¬£50,000 for her legal expenses. With these funds, Clennell was able to hire a lawyer ‚Äì her previous failed attempts had been made without legal help, which had led to errors that hindered her applications ‚Äì and applied again for a spousal visa. This time, Clennell was successful, and she was able to return to the UK on 30 August 2017.

Ambedkarites and Buddhists refer to her as Mai or Maisaheb, which stands for 'Mother' in Marathi language. In B. R. Ambedkar's various movements, during the writing of the books, Indian Constitution and Hindu code bills and Buddhist mass conversion, she helped him from time to time. Babasaheb Ambedkar credited her in preface of his book The Buddha and His Dhamma for extending his life for eight-ten years. Early life and education Savita Ambedkar was born on 27 January 1909 in Bombay in a Marathi Brahmin family. Her birth name was \\"Sharada Kabir\\". Her mother's name was Janaki and father name was Krishnarao Vinayak Kabir. Her family were a resident of Doors village, located in Rajapur tehsil of Ratnagiri district, Maharashtra. Later, her father came from Ratnagiri to Bombay. On the Sir Rao Bahadur C. K. Bole Road, near the pigeon in the west of Dadar The Kabir family had rented a house in Sahru's house in Matruchaya. Savita Ambedkar was a brilliant student. Her early education was completed in Pune. After that, around 1937 she did MBBS from Grant Medical College, Bombay. When her studies were completed, she was appointed as the first class medical officer in a major hospital in Gujarat. But after a few months of illness, she left her job and returned home. Her six of eight siblings had inter-caste marriages. Those days it was an extraordinary thing for Marathi Brahmin. Savita said, \\"Our family did not oppose inter-caste marriages, because the whole family was educated and progressive.\\" Career and meeting with Ambedkar  Maisaheb and Babasaheb At Bombay's Vile Parle, lived a doctor named S.M. Rao who had close links with B. R. Ambedkar. When Ambedkar came from Delhi to Bombay, he often used to visit the doctor. Sharda Kabir also used to visit Dr. Rao's house as she had a family relation with him. One day Babasaheb Ambedkar had come from Delhi and Dr. Sharada Kabir was also present at that time. Dr. Rao formalised his identity by saying, \\"This girl of my daughters friend is very clever, while being MBBS, Dr. Malavankar is working as a junior for a well-known doctor .... etc.\\" Babasaheb was then the Labor Minister in the Viceroy's Executive Council. Until that time Dr. Sharda did not know much about Dr. Ambedkar, except that he is in Viceroy Council member. Dr. Sharada was impressed with Dr. Ambedkar's stunning personality. In his first meeting, she realised that Dr. Ambedkar was an extraordinary and great figure, In this first meeting, Ambedkar inquired about Kabir with apathy. The reason for this was that they were working on the advancement of women. Ambedkar congratulated them. There was also discussion about Buddhism in this meeting. His second meeting took place in the Advice Room of Dr. Mavalankar. Ambedkar had blood pressure, blood sugar and joint pain at that time. In 1947, during the writing of the Indian Constitution, Bhimrao Ambedkar got health related problems due to diabetes and high blood pressure. He did not sleep. having neuropathic pain in the legs, Insulin and some homoeopathic medicines could provide relief to some extent. He went to Bombay for treatment. At the same time, Dr. Sharada came closer to Ambedkar during treatment. Ambedkar's first wife, Ramabai Ambedkar, died in 1935 after a long illness. In this way, the rounds of meetings continued. Later correspondence also happened. And Ambedkar had a good life. There was talk of literature, society, religion etc. Sometimes they also debated. Ambedkar used to listen to Savita's arguments carefully and then respond. In 1947, Ambedkar started worrying about his health. There must be someone to take care of their health. In a letter to Dadasaheb Gaikwad on 16 March 1948, Ambedkar wrote, \\"To keep a woman nurse or to take care of the house for service, there will be doubts in people's mind, so marriage is a better way.\\" After the death of Yashwant's mother (Ramabai), I had decided not to marry, but in today's situation, I will have to give up my decision.\\" Ambedkar took medical service from doctor Sharda Kabir for nature reasons. And both of them decided to get married. Marriage B.R. Ambedkar and Savita Ambedkar in 1948 On 15 April 1948 Sharda Kabir married Bhimrao Ambedkar. She was 39 and he was 57. After their marriage, she was popularly called \\"Mai\\" (mother) by his followers. As registrar for marriage, Rameshwar Dayal, Deputy Commissioner, was called in Delhi. This marriage was completed as a Civil Marriage under the Civil Marriage Act. Among those who attended this occasion were Rai Sahab Puran Chand, Mr Macy (Private Secretary), Neelkanth, Ramkrishna Chandiwala, Estate Officer Meshram, nephew of Chitre, his wife, Sharda Kabir's brother. Also Home Secretary Banerjee On 28 November 1948, the newly married couple, the then governor-general of India, C. Rajagopalachari, invited them for the Sneh Bhoj and greeted them. After marriage Sharda adopted the name 'Savita'. But Ambedkar used to call her \\"ShƒÅr≈´\\" in old name, which was a word of \\"ShƒÅradƒÅ\\". After marriage, Savita started serving husband. Ambedkar's health was steadily getting worse. She continued her care with full devotion till the last of Ambedkar's service. Ambedkar mentioned the help he received from wife in a book written on 15 March 1956, in a book The Buddha and His Dhamma. In this preface, he mentioned that Savita Ambedkar increased his age by 8‚Äì10 years. After Ambedkar's death, his close friends and followers removed this role from this book. Its address dates back to 1980 AD. When the Bengali Buddhist author Bhagwan Das published his preface as a \\"rare preface\\". Conversion to Buddhism Babasaheb with Mai, holding a statue of the Buddha, during the Dhamma Diksha ceremony in Nagpur on 14 October 1956 Ambedkar receiving the Five Precepts from Mahasthavir Chandramani on 14 October 1956. In the photograph (from right to left): Savita Ambedkar, B. R. Ambedkar, Wali Sinha and bhikkhu Chandramani. On Ashok Vijaya Dashami (The Day on which Buddhism was accepted by Emperor Ashoka the Great) 14 October 1956, Savita Ambedkar accepted Buddhism along with her husband Bhimrao Ambedkar in Deekshabhoomi, Nagpur. She was given the initiation of Buddha's Dhamma by the Burmese Bhikkhu Mahastavir Chandramani giving Three Jewels and Five precepts. After this, B. R. Ambedkar himself initiated Buddhism by giving 500,000 followers of Three Jewels, Five precepts and twenty-two pledges. This oath took place at 9 a.m.. Savita Ambedkar became the first woman to accept Buddhism of this conversion movement. Allegations and contradictions  Many People from Delhi came to meet B. R. Ambedkar at 26, Alipur Road, where Ambedkar was in residence. It wasn't possible that everyone should get a glimpse Ambedkar as he was sick. While on Savita Ambedkar was besides as wife and his doctor she had dual responsibilities. After the death of Babasaheb Ambedkar, some Ambedkarites blamed Savita Ambedkar for killing him. She separated from the Ambedkarite movement by describing her as a Brahmin. She took herself up to his farmhouse in Mehrauli in Delhi. Till 1972, she was living in Delhi. The then Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru formed a committee to investigate the matter, and that committee released her from the charges after the investigation. After the demise of Babasaheb, PM Jawaharlal Nehru, PM Indira Gandhi and President Sarvepalli Radhakrishnan decided to take Maisaheb to Rajya Sabha. With the support of the Congress party, she was going to be a member of the Rajya Sabha, but she would have betrayed the husband's principle, so she humbly refused the proposals thrice.  Repatriation with the Dalit movement  Ambedkar with Arun Kamble, Republican Party of India leader Ramdas Athavale and Gangadhar Gadhe brought her back to the mainstream Ambedkarite movement. The young activists of Dalit Panthers movement treated Mai with respect. She played an important role in the movement about the book \\"Riddles in Hinduism\\". Her role earned her respect and got rid of the misunderstanding of dalits. Later on, she was separated from him as she grew older. Babasaheb Ambedkar was given the 'Bharat Ratna', the highest civilian award, it was accepted by Savita Ambedkar honoured by the then President Ramaswamy Venkataraman on 14 April 1990. It was his legendary birth anniversary. This award ceremony was held at the Darbar Hall / Ashok Hall of Rashtrapati Bhavan. Death Savita Ambedkar became lonely after her husband's death. Later, she rejoined the Dalit movement for some time. On 19 April 2003, she suffered difficulties in breathing, and was admitted to J.J. hospital. She died on 29 May 2003 at the age of 94 at J.J. Hospital in Mumbai.  Writings  She wrote a memorable and autobiographical Marathi book titled \\"Dr. Ambedkaranchya Sahwasat\\" (English: In companionship with Dr. Ambedkar). She also contributed to Dr. Babasaheb Ambedkar film. Mrinal Kulkarni played the role of her in this film.

Dark advertising allows a publisher to send different adverts to different target audience groups where it would be disadvantageous for the audience of one target group to see the adverts intended for another. This increases the success rate of the publisher's advertising campaign. This form of advertising is commonly found on online social media platforms that make target group identification possible. Groups can be identified using age based targeting, geotargeting, behavioural targeting and more recently psychographic targeting, among others. History In July 2012, the social network Facebook added the ability to create unpublished posts. These could be sponsored, citing \\"page posts usually contain information that are relevant to only a segment of the page's audience\\". The term \\"Dark Advertising\\" was coined by marketing professionals shortly after and has been used in the media ever since. It was reported that the Donald Trump presidential campaign used dark advertising during the 2016 United States presidential election to dissuade African Americans from voting. In May 2017 a group of activists formed the Who Targets Me project, collecting data on how political campaigns used dark advertising during the 2017 United Kingdom general election and calling for an end to dark advertising on Facebook. On 22 September 2017, Mark Zuckerberg, CEO of Facebook announced that Facebook was ending dark advertising Companies Like HubSpot, Hootsuite, BrandTotal & HIcentrik are doing exceptionally well when it comes to educating about dark marketing & advertising.  Effects  Melanie Dempsey and Andrew Mitchell, authors of the Journal of Consumer Research, conducted an experiment with pens to prove the psychological effects of producers advertisements. After showing a group media of a specific pen brand associated with positive images, the group was asked to choose a pen. Knowing that the pen brand was not as good as other brands, 70-80% of the group chose the brand due to its positive association. These psychological effects are forced upon consumers by producers and advertisers. This is seen due to companies tricking their consumers into \\"placing a greater importance on extrinsic values is associated with higher levels of prejudice, ... and weak (or absent) concern about human rights.\\" These occurrences are now showing up in large scale topics, such as the presidential election. Large scale companies are able to pay for advertisements of their choosing, causing major waves in political elections. These advertisements play a large role in who is elected, due to association of those who see the advertisements.  References  External links * Tech Giants Now Share Details on Political Ads.

From both father and mother, she inherited marked characteristics. They were devoutly religious and possessed a robust humanitarianism, which bore fruit while they lived and left its impress on their daughters. The mother's family was devoted to literature and scientific investigation. One of her brothers was the first man to construct a galvanic battery to control electricity, before Morse took up the invention. For years the effort of his inventive genius was unknown, at the end of the 19th century it was chronicled in electrical literature. The family moved to northern Ohio in 1835, and settled in Mentor, Ohio. Amy was educated in the Western Reserve Seminary and in Oberlin College, Ohio. Career Since the age of fifteen Jane Amy McKinney was engaged in educational and philanthropic work almost continuously. In Iowa she was actively engaged in temperance work and in the advocacy of woman suffrage. She served a term of four years by election of the legislature as trustee of the hospital for the insane in Independence, Iowa. She was president of the Cook County Equal Suffrage Association. Susan B. Anthony helped McKinney to organize the Winnesheik County Woman Suffrage Association in 1875. McKinney was a skilled legislative lobbyist. She did kindergarten work and was supervisor of the Chicago Kindergarten Training School. Personal life Jane Amy married James P. McKinney (1827-1903) in 1856 and went with her husband to Decorah, Iowa, where her home was until 1888 when she moved to Chicago, Illinois. They had one daughter, Mabel McKinney Smith (1867-1968).

She is the only Indian woman to win shotgun Silver Medal at the International Shooting Sport Federation (ISSF) World Cup. She was born in Johri village of Uttar Pradesh.  Early life  Tomar learned shooting at a range set up in her village in 1998. Tomar was initially discouraged by the expectations of the society around her, which expected her to get married and become a housewife. She felt that she could not enter this field unless an elder from her family went into shooting. Initially, Tomar was afraid to go shooting range without her mother, who encouraged and accompanied her to the range. Tomar's mother, Prakashi Tomar, started shooting and participating in events, soon becoming an award-winning shooter, the second- oldest woman shooter in India, also known as Revolver Dadi. Prakashi and her sister-in-law Chandro Tomar's participation allowed Tomar to enter shooting competitions. Tomar started shooting in 2001 at the 10m range in the village. Tomar is still a proponent of equality across genders in Indian villages, and has led to many young girls taking up shooting in her hometown. Tomar has seven siblings. Her sister Rekha is also a shooter. Prakashi also runs a shooting range in the village where many girls come to learn shooting.  Career  Seema Tomar started with shooting the air rifle in 2004, but later switched to the shotgun event. She currently specializes in Trap shooting. 2010 was a milestone in Seema Tomar's career when she won a Silver Medal in 2010 ISSF World Cup. In 2014, Tomar won two golds at the Asian Shotgun Championships held in the United Arab Emirates in November 2014.

Structure NDH-2 structure colored by domains The structure/fold from these proteins may be divided into three domains: first dinucleotide binding domain (green in the figure), second dinucleotide binding domain (orange in the figure) and C-terminal domain (blue in the figure). The first domain is responsible for the noncovalent binding of FAD, while the second dinucleotide binding domain binds NADH. Both these domain are structurally organized in Rossmann folds, with the characteristic GxGxxG motif present. The third domain, C-terminal, is responsible for the protein-membrane interaction. Upon expression of a C-terminal truncated version of NDH-2, it was observed an intracellular delocalization from the membrane to the cytoplasm.Y. Feng, W. Li, J. Li, J. Wang, J. Ge, D. Xu, Y. Liu, K.

Depending on the organism, the reduced quinone changes between menaquinone, ubiquinone or plastoquinone. The mechanism of the reaction may be divided in two half-reactions: 1stHR and 2ndHR. In the 1stHR, 2 electrons and 1 proton from NADH are transferred (simultaneously with an additional proton from the bulk) to the prosthetic group (FAD), giving rise to its protonated form FADH2. In this phase, an Enzyme-Substrate complex is established, characterized by the appearance of a \\"Charge-transfer complex\\". Na 2stHR, the quinone binds and the 2 electrons and one of the FAD protons are transferred for this second substrate (again, with an additional proton from the bulk), forming the product quinol. It is now accepted that the overall mechanism occurs by a ternary complex (simultaneous binding of both substrates to the enzyme), instead of the previously proposed ping-pong mechanism. Phylogenetic Distribution The presence of NDH-2 in organisms which genome as already been fully sequenced was studied by Bioinformatics.B.C. Marreiros, F. V Sena, F.M. Sousa, A.P. Batista, M.M.

In this study, NDH-2 were identified in 83% of Eukaryotes, 60% of Bacterias and in 32% of Archaeas. It was also observed the absence of NDH-2 in phyla composed of anaerobic organisms. Despite being considered absent (hence being considered as drug targets), in this same study, the presence of a gene coding for a NDH-2 homolog was observed in the human genome.

History Most of the population are early immigrants from Mid-Travancore (‡¥Æ‡¥ß‡µç‡¥Ø‡¥§‡¥ø‡¥∞‡µÅ‡¥µ‡¥ø‡¥§‡¥æ‡¥Ç‡¥ï‡µÇ‡¥∞‡µç‚Äç) especially in the Kottayam district in central Wayanad. People also immigrated from Malappuram and Mysuru (‡≤Æ‡≥à‡≤∏‡≥Ç‡≤∞‡≥Å) Karnataka districts to live here. There are some historical ruins in the area. The oldest are found in nearby Kallambalam and believed to date to Tipu's release. Transportation Kayakkunn's main transportation routes are the Sultan Battery State Highway from Mananthavady or Kalpetta. The Periya ghat road connects Mananthavady to Kannur and Thalassery. The Thamarassery mountain road (NH-212) connects Calicut with Kalpetta. The Kuttiady mountain road connects Vatakara with Kalpetta and Mananthavady. The Palchuram mountain road connects Kannur and Iritty with Mananthavady. The road from Bangalore, Mysore, Gudaloor-Nilgiris, Nilambur, and Ooty is also connected to Wayanad through Sultan battery, Nadavayal-Changanacherry K.S.R.T.C. There is a daily bus which travels the Sultan Battery highway to connect with the Bangalore‚ÄìOoty interstate road. A Pala‚ÄìPathanamthitta‚ÄìPulpally bus also travels along this route. The nearest railway stations are at Mysore, Calicut, and Cannanoor.

Although the team is now a local Yorkshire team, prior to Hackenthorpe being incorporated into Sheffield in the 1930s, the village and team was located in Derbyshire county. Hackenthorpe Cricket Club 1910 program History The Cricket club was started due to the efforts of local businessman James Hounsfield that resided at Hackenthorpe Hall. Mr Hounsfield originally gave the club a free 40-year lease on the cricket ground that today is found next to Rainbow Forge school. A pavilion was built which contained an oak chest in which bats and other equipment were stored. The players arranged a set one night per week practice. Many local families in the village were associated with the cricket club, including the Hounsfields themselves, Havenhands and Staniforths. In the early years the team relied on horse and wagon to get the players around the county for matches. Local driver John Hempsell arranged to pick up the players from either of the villages inns, the Bluebell or the Sportsman Inn. One of the first recorded games took place on 12 May 1888 and involved a H.B Lund, who was schoolmaster at Hackenthorpe Infants School scoring at Shirecliffe Hall. The score for this match was Hackenthorpe 10 for 60, Shirecliffe Hall 10 for 43. The first home match recorded was played against Collegiate. This match ended with Hackenthorpe winning by 21 runs. The Hackenthorpe team recorded on 12 May 1888 consisted of: *Thomas Hounsfield *J. Hounsfield *F. Rippon *J. Frith *M. Helliwell *T. Booth *W. Henshaw *A. Booth *A. Renshaw *H. Barker and *T. WostenholmHistory of Beighton by T.L. Platts The Hackenthorpe Miner's Welfare was started in 1925 when funds were granted from the Miners' Welfare Central Fund. A new cricket pitch was laid in nearby Beighton in 1926 and the Miners' Welfare Cricket Club formed in 1928 when twelve pounds was offered to the Hackenthorpe Cricket Club. On 6 July 1929 the official opening of the new committee was performed. The first secretary of the Miners Welfare was Frederick Lambert Jr. who was then followed by Herbert Staniforth. In 1927 Tommy Harrison took over and would remain secretary for thirty years. The team would then go on to win the Norton and District Trophy in 1938. With the outbreak of World War II, the team disbanded in 1939 and then reformed in 1946.

A spread is a particular kind of species of infinite sequences defined via finite decidable properties. In modern terminology, a spread is an inhabited closed set of sequences. The notion of spread was first proposed by L. E. J. Brouwer (1918B), and was used to define the real numbers (also called the continuum). As Brouwer's ideas were developed, the use of spreads became common in intuitionistic mathematics, especially when dealing with choice sequences and the foundations of intuitionistic analysis (Dumett 77, Troelstra 77). Simple examples of spreads are: *the set of sequences of even numbers; *the set of sequences of the integers 1‚Äì6; *the set of sequences of valid terminal commands. Spreads are defined via a spread function which performs a (decidable) \\"check\\" on finite sequences. The notion of a spread and its spread function are interchangeable in the literature; both are treated as one and the same. If all the finite initial parts of an infinite sequence satisfy a spread function's \\"check\\", then we can say that the infinite sequence is admissible to the spread. Graph theoretically, one may think of a spread as a rooted, directed tree with numerical vertex labels. Formal definition This article uses \\\\langle to denote the beginning of a sequence and \\\\rangle to denote the end of a sequence. A spread function s is a function that maps finite sequences to either 0 [i.e. the finite sequence is admissible to the spread] or 1 [i.e. the finite sequence is inadmissible to the spread], and satisfies the following properties: *Given any finite sequence \\\\langle x_1,x_2,\\\\ldots,x_i\\\\rangle either s(\\\\langle x_1,x_2,\\\\ldots,x_i\\\\rangle)=0 or s(\\\\langle x_1,x_2,\\\\ldots,x_i\\\\rangle)=1 (the property s \\"tests\\" for must be decidable). *Given the empty sequence (the sequence with no elements represented by \\\\langle\\\\rangle), s(\\\\langle\\\\rangle)=0 (the empty sequence is in every spread). *Given any finite sequence \\\\langle x_1,x_2,\\\\ldots,x_i\\\\rangle such that s(\\\\langle x_1,x_2,\\\\ldots,x_i\\\\rangle)=0 then there must exist some k such that s(\\\\langle x_1, x_2, \\\\ldots, x_i, k \\\\rangle) = 0 (every finite sequence in the spread can be extended to another finite sequence in the spread by adding an extra element to the end of the sequence) Given an infinite sequence \\\\langle x_1,x_2,\\\\ldots\\\\rangle, we say that the finite sequence \\\\langle y_1,y_2,\\\\ldots,y_i\\\\rangle is an initial segment of \\\\langle x_1,x_2,\\\\ldots\\\\rangle iff x_1=y_1 and x_2=y_2 and ... and x_i=y_i. Thus we say that an infinite sequence \\\\langle x_1,x_2,\\\\ldots\\\\rangle is admissible to a spread defined by spread function s iff every initial segment of \\\\langle x_1,x_2,\\\\ldots\\\\rangle is admissible to s. Fans A special type of spread that is of particular interest in the Intuitionistic foundations of mathematics is a finitary spread; also known as a fan. The main use of fans is in the fan theorem, a result used in the derivation of the uniform continuity theorem. Informally; a spread function s defines a fan iff given a finite sequence admissible to the spread, there are only finitely many possible values that we can add to the end of this sequence such that our new extended finite sequence is admissible to the spread. Alternatively, we can say that there is an upper bound on the value for each element of any sequence admissible to the spread. Formally; a spread function s defines a fan iff given any sequence admissible to the spread \\\\langle x_1,x_2,\\\\ldots,x_i\\\\rangle, then there exists some k such that, given any j>k then s(\\\\langle x_1,x_2,\\\\ldots,x_i,j\\\\rangle)=1 (i.e. given a sequence admissible to the fan, we have only finitely many possible extensions that are also admissible to the fan, and we know the maximal element we may append to our admissible sequence such that the extension remains admissible). Some examples of fans are: *the set of sequences of legal chess moves; *the set of infinite binary sequences; *the set of sequences of letters. Commonly used spreads/fans This section provides the definition of 2 spreads commonly used in the literature. The universal spread (the continuum) Given any finite sequence \\\\langle x_1,x_2,\\\\ldots,x_i\\\\rangle, we have s(\\\\langle x_1,x_2,\\\\ldots,x_i\\\\rangle)=0. In other words, this is the spread containing all possible sequences. This spread is often used to represent the collection of all choice sequences. The binary spread Given any finite sequence \\\\langle x_1,x_2,\\\\ldots,x_i\\\\rangle, if all of our elements (x_1,x_2,\\\\ldots,x_i) are 0 or 1 then s(\\\\langle x_1,x_2,\\\\ldots,x_i\\\\rangle)=0, otherwise s(\\\\langle x_1,x_2,\\\\ldots,x_i\\\\rangle)=1. In other words, this is the spread containing all binary sequences. Dressed Spreads A key use of spreads in the foundations of intuitionisitic analysis is the use of spreads of natural numbers (or integers) to represent reals. This is achieved via the concept of a dressed spread, which we outline below. A dressed spread is a pair of objects; a spread s, and some function f acting on finite sequences. An example of a dressed spread is the spread of integers such that s(\\\\langle x_1,x_2,\\\\ldots,x_i\\\\rangle)=0 iff \\\\forall y_{0, and the function f(\\\\langle x_1,x_2,\\\\ldots,x_i\\\\rangle)=x_i * 2^{2-i} (the dressed spread representing the real numbers).

At one atmosphere pressure the gas condenses to a liquid at 3.1¬∞C and freezes at ‚àí96.4. Alternate names are difluorophosphoryl chloride or phosphoryl chloride difluoride. Properties The critical temperature of POF2Cl is 150.6 at a critical pressure of 43.4 atmospheres. The density of the liquid at 0¬∞ is 1.6555 g/cm3. The shape of the molecules in POF2Cl is tetrahedral. The P-O distance is 1.426 √Ö, Both P-F distances are 1.514 √Ö, and the P-Cl distance is 1.940 √Ö. ‚à†OPF is 114.09¬∞, ‚à†FPF 101.2¬∞‚à†OPCl 118.85¬∞ and ‚à†FPCl is 103.22¬∞. In the solid form, there are two inequivalent molecular positions. The O atom from one is close to the chlorine atom on the other position aligned roughly on the c-axis. Along the b-axis there is a zigzag of O atoms close to a P atom in the other position. The density of the solid is as calculated from crystal data is 2.177. The NMR shift for 31P from H3PO4 is 15 ppm. The NMR spectrum show a triplet line at this shift. When mixed with HCl, exchange of halogen atoms between molecules is catalysed, and POCl3, POCl2F, and POF3 end up in the mixture. HCl can end up in the product due to the starting materials, or contamination by water, and must be removed if POF2F is to be stored. Production Phosphoric chloride difluoride can be made by the reaction of liquid phosphorus pentachloride with phosphorodifluoridic acid HPO2F2 or diphosphoridic tetrafluoride P2O3F4. This reaction takes place at room temperature up to 60¬∞C. The POF2Cl bubbles off as a gas, and can be condensed by cooling with dry ice-acetone mixture. Another starting point is from potassium difluorphosphate KPO2F2. Other less efficient methods involve fluornating POCl3 using fluoride salts like SbF3 or NaF. But a mixture of fluorides results from these reactions. An even cheaper source is NaCl, CaF2 and P4O10 mixture heated to 500¬∞. Industrial scale manufacture is possible with a HF reaction with POCl3.

Funk was born in 1866 in Edina, Missouri, daughter of Thomas W. and Rachel M. Funk of Kirksville, Missouri Funk was a graduate of the State Normal School at Kirksville, Missouri, graduating in the class of her future husband, James M. Simpson in June 1886. Career Kate Funk Simpson was the principal of a High School in Deer Lodge, Montana. For eight years she was the president of Spokane Young Women's Christian Association; for 15 years she was a member of the Spokane City Charities Commission and of the Spokane School Board. She was also a member of Sorosis and Service Star League. Personal life and family On July 1, 1886, Kate Funk married James Mitchell Simpson (1860-1937), and they had one son, James C. James M. Simpson, actively engaged in the practice of law in Spokane since 1902, had a large business. He was born in Knox County, Missouri, on January 1, 1860, the son of Benjamin and Perlina Simpson, being pioneers of that county. He entered the public schools there when a boy of six years and after completing the course of study therein prescribed, attended the State Normal School at Kirksville, Missouri, from which institution he graduated in the full course of our years in June 1886. Simpson first went west in 1882, locating at Deer Lodge, Montana, remaining west but a short time, when he returned to Missouri to complete his education and again went west to Deer Lodge, Montana, where he engaged in educational work until 1904, having charge of the public schools of that place. He devoted the hours that are usually termed leisure to the study of law and was admitted to the bar of that state in June 1893. Simpson continued his educational work for a time after his admission to the bar, but then devoted entirely to the law. In 1901 he became prosecuting county Attorney of Powell County, Montana, serving in that capacity, for nearly two years. In 1902, he resigned and moved to Spokane, where he continued in the practice of the law. Simpson was identified with three of the leading fraternal organizations. Holding membership in the Masonic fraternity, he attained high rank and was a member of El Katif Temple of the Mystic Shrine. He also belonged to Imperial Lodge, No. 134, I. O. O.

In 2017, more of her poems in English translation were published by Vagabond Press as part of Poems of Kim Yideum, Kim Haengsook & Kim Min Jeong. Kim‚Äôs poems are known for their grotesque and provocative motifs. Her narrators are often schizophrenic or have multiple personalities, disrupting the existing world order. Many of her poems feature single mothers, prostitutes, people with disabilities, divorced women, queers, mental patients, beggars, the elderly poor, and other minority groups. She observes the order governing their marginalized world and seeks new artistic possibilities through it. She condemns unreasonable social conventions using language that might be described as hysterical, destructive, vengeful, and rebellious.

He currently resides in the United Kingdom. Alluri was raised in India, hearing local classical music, Bollywood and Tollywood music, and some Western popular music as a child, although he had no exposure to rock until his teens, at which point he began playing guitar. He relocated to the UK first as a student and then again in 2015 to record the album Man of Truth at Brighton Electric Studios. Alluri cites The Smiths, Joy Division, David Bowie, The Doves, and Nick Cave as influences on his work. Following the positive critical reception of Man of Truth, Alluri worked with the Grammy winning producer Tommaso Colliva (Muse, Jesus And Mary Chain, Franz Ferdinand) on the single Evari Kosam (For Who's Sake), his first recording to feature vocals performed in his native tongue, Telugu. His 2018 single Don't Lose Touch was recorded with Glen Matlock of the Sex Pistols after Matlock saw and tweeted a video of Alluri's live Telugu language cover version of Anarchy in the UK. When asked by Indian press as to what got him working with Alluri, Matlock said, \\"I think he's got (it) all. I find him interesting.\\" Matlock produced the single, working with Alluri and Tommaso Colliva in Italy. In interviews supporting the release of his 2018 Telugu language album O Katha: Tales of This Telugu Man, Alluri has stated that following the release of his 2015 album he experienced an identity crisis. Feeling he couldn't truly share his English language songs with his friends and family in India, he began to write songs in Telugu to re-inforce that aspect of his identity, with the songs reportedly coming to him in a creative burst. On writing Telugu language songs, Alluri has said, \\"When the British came to India they heard Telugu and called it 'the Italian of the east', because all words end with a vowel, not a consonant. These new songs, melodically, they‚Äôre influenced so much by the language\\". Alluri recorded the album in Italy working again with Muse producer/mixer Tommaso Colliva along with Italian musician Massimo Martelotta, of the cinematic Italo-funk band Calibro 35. Alluri has made several notable live appearances in 2018 at events such as a stadium concert in Hyderabad, Talinn Music Week, and a show with Glen Matlock at the Hard Rock Cafe in Mumbai. He has stated he has renewed his focus on songwriting and is working with producer Adrian Hall (Shakira, Depeche Mode, Anna Calvi) on new English language songs to eventually form a series of EPs and his third album.  Critical reception  Alluri's debut album Man of Truth received favourable UK reviews and coverage in 2016 from notable sources including Q magazine, and the NME, alongside features articles in major papers, and favourable reviews and interviews appearing on various music websites. In India, he has been praised in many of the country's largest newspapers for making authentic cross-cultural indie music, with feature articles and interviews having been published in media including The Times of India, The Hindu, The New Indian Express and the Deccan Chronicle.

The company consisted of 160 men under French command, 146 of whom were Spanish republicans including many anarchists, and French soldiers. All had fought during the liberation of French North Africa, and later participated in the Liberation of France. The 9th Company's most notable military accomplishment was its important role in the Liberation of Paris. Men of La Nueve were among the first to enter the French capital on the evening of 24 August 1944, with half-tracks bearing the names of the Spanish Civil War battles of Teruel and Guadalajara, and accompanied by engineering personnel and three tanks, Montmirail, Champaubert and Romilly, from the 501e R√©giment de chars de combat.  Origins  After the victory of the Nationalist faction of General Francisco Franco in the Spanish Civil War, many thousands of refugees, many of whom were exiled Spanish Republicans had fled from Spain to Metropolitan France or French North Africa. On the eve of the Second World War, France compelled male foreigners between 20 and 48 years old and entitled to the right of asylum‚Äîincluding Spanish republican exiles‚Äîto serve in the French Army, or to work in agriculture or industry, or on French defensive works. The military options included enrolling in the French Foreign Legion or the Marching Regiments of Foreign Volunteers; as the Foreign Legion was associated with the Francoist Spanish Legion, most opted for the Foreign Volunteers. Returning to Spain was not a safe option. On 22 June 1940, Nazi Germany imposed an armistice on France; part remained under control of the French Vichy government until Germany took over the whole country in November 1942. Following Operation Torch, the Allied invasion of North Africa, on 8 November 1942, the Free French authorities based in Algeria created the Corps Franc D'Afrique. This was a regular division intended for non-French combatants, and was primarily made up of Spaniards, including Captain Miguel Buiza, the former head of the Spanish Republican Navy. The Spanish soldiers entered combat against the remains of the Afrika Corps, made up of German and Italian troops, in December 1942 in Tunisia. Fighting continued throughout the first half of 1943, until the conquest of the port city of Bizerte on 7 May, which marked the end of fighting in North Africa.  Formation of the 9th Company  The choice was then given to the Spanish servicemen to be incorporated into either the 2nd Armored Division (Division Leclerc) or the forces of General Giraud, which had recently switched sides to join the Free French Forces. Given the formerly pro-Vichy sympathies of the latter, the majority chose to join Leclerc's unit. The Division Leclerc, under the command of General Philippe Leclerc, had been established in May 1943 in Chad as the 2nd Free French Division. In August of that year, after the fusion of the Free French Forces and the Army of Africa, it was rechristened the 2nd Armored Division. In the first half of 1943, it consisted of 16,000 men, of which 2,000 were Spanish. As Spanish soldiers were particularly numerous in the 9th Company, it became known as La Nueve or La Espa√±ola. Tricolor flag of the Second Spanish Republic. Amado Granell in 1936. La Nueve was placed under command of a Frenchman, Captain Raymond Dronne, with the Spaniard Amado Granell serving as his lieutenant. The majority were socialists, communists, anarchists or unaffiliated men hostile to Franco, while others were deserters of concentration camps for Spanish refugees in Algeria and Morocco. While still fully integrated soldiers in the French Army, they were permitted to wear the tricolor Republican flag on their uniforms. As it was composed almost entirely of Spanish soldiers, Spanish was used as the common language within the company and the officers also came from the Spanish ranks. In September 1943, the company, as part of the greater 2nd Division, was transferred to Rabat, in Morocco, where the division received American supplies: 160 M4 Sherman tanks, 280 armored M3 half-tracks and M8 Greyhounds, Dodge, GMC, Brockway, and Diamond trucks and a number of jeeps. The Spanish soldiers gave their vehicles original names, for the most part honoring events from the Spanish Civil War. The command unit's jeep was christened \\"Mort aux cons\\" (French for \\"death to dopes\\"), and its half-track, \\"Les Cosaques\\" (French for \\"the Cossacks\\"). The 1st combat section called their vehicles \\"Don Quichotte\\" (French for \\"Don Quixote\\"), \\"Cap Serrat\\", \\"Madrid\\" \\"Guernica\\", and \\"Les Pingouins\\" (French for \\"the penguins\\"), after the nickname \\"Espingouins\\", given by French soldiers to the Spanish servicemen (the name \\"Buenaventura Durruti\\", proposed by the anarchists, had been refused by the French superior officers). The 2nd combat section gave their half-tracks the names \\"R√©sistance\\", \\"Teruel\\", \\"Espa√±a Ca√±i\\" (later \\"Lib√©ration\\"), \\"Nous Voil√†\\" (French for \\"Here we are\\") and \\"Ebro\\". The 3rd combat section named their half-tracks \\"Tunisie\\", \\"Brunete\\", \\"Amiral Buiza\\", \\"Guadalajara\\", \\"El Canguro\\" (Spanish for \\"The Kangaroo\\") and \\"Santander\\"; also used were the names \\"Catapulte\\" (French for \\"catapult\\"), \\"Belchite\\", and \\"Rescousse\\" (French for \\"rescue\\") for the towing half-track. The crew members of Spanish origin were also authorized to paint the flag of the Second Spanish Republic on their armored vehicles.  Operations: From Normandy to Berchtesgaden  The 2nd Armored Division was transferred from Morocco to Great Britain, only arriving in Normandy at the beginning of August 1944. The 9th Company landed on Utah Beach during the night of 31 July ‚Äì 1 August 1944. The 2nd Armored Division was at that point integrated into the Third United States Army, led by General George Patton. La Nueve engaged in combat against German units on the outskirts of Ch√¢teau-Gontier and Alen√ßon, and from 13 to 18 August, fought in the vanguard of the division at √âcouch√©. The 2nd Armored Division was attacked by the Waffen-SS, Adolf Hitler and Das Reich divisions, the 9th and 116th Panzer divisions and the 3rd Parachute Division, with fighting lasting until the arrival of the 2nd British Army in reinforcement. The company's anarchists revealed their courageous character during this battle, as one mortar unit carried out a coup de main attack 3 km behind German lines on 14 August, taking 130 German prisoners, capturing 13 vehicles and liberating 8 Americans. The city of Paris revolted against the German occupation on 20 August 1944. General Charles de Gaulle urged the Supreme Allied Command to allow the French troops to support the insurrection, backing Leclerc, who wanted to take advantage of the rebellion led by the French Resistance to quickly liberate Paris. On 23 August 1944, La Nueve set off towards Paris with the rest of the division. Around 8:00 pm on 24 August, accompanied by a squadron of tanks from the 501e R√©giment de chars de combat, the 9th Company entered Paris through the Port d'Italie. At 9:22 pm, the section led by Amado Granell was the first to reach the H√¥tel de Ville, and the half-track \\"Ebro\\" fired the first shots against a group of German machine guns. Subsequently, Lieutenant Granell, ex- superior officer of the Spanish Republican Army, was the first \\"French\\" officer to be received by the National Council of the Resistance within City Hall. While awaiting the surrender of the German General Dietrich von Choltitz, Governor of Paris, La Nueve was sent to occupy the Chamber of Deputies, the H√¥tel Majestic (headquarters of the German military high command in France) and the Place de la Concorde. In the afternoon of 25 August, at 3:30 pm, the German garrison surrendered, and General von Choltitz was held prisoner by Spanish soldiers until being handed over to a French officer. 2nd Armored Division parade along the Champs-√âlys√©es after the Liberation of Paris The next day, Allied troops entered Paris in triumph. The Spanish soldiers participated in the victory parade, with four half-tracks chosen to form General De Gaulle's escort along the Champs-Elys√©es. They paraded under the flag of the Second Spanish Republic, and a giant banner sporting the same colours was used for several minutes during the opening of the parade. The 9th Company was then stationed in the Bois de Boulogne from 27 August to 9 September, before heading off to combat once more. On 12 September, the company distinguished itself in the capture of Andelot, during which 300 German soldiers were taken prisoner. On 15 September, the men of La Nueve crossed the Moselle river at Ch√¢tel-sur-Moselle and established a bridgehead against the German lines. The company's merit did not go unnoticed, with General De Gaulle personally awarding medals to the soldiers in the city of Nancy on 26 September. Captain Raymond Dronne, Canarian sub-lieutenant Miguel Campos, Catalan sergeant Ferm√≠n Pujol and the Galician corporal Cari√±o L√≥pez all received the M√©daille militaire and Croix de guerre 1939‚Äì1945. Combat in Alsace began in November 1944, and La Nueve entered into Strasbourg, the last big French city under occupation, on 23 November. On 1 January 1945, Captain Raymond Dronne paid his respects to his troops in a letter: The 2nd Armored Division were relieved of active duty at the end of February for fifty days of rest, in the Ch√¢teauroux region. At the end of April they resumed combat, fighting until the capture of the Eagle's Nest, on 5 May in Berchtesgaden. By this time, the losses suffered by La Nueve had reached 35 dead and 97 wounded. No more than 16 Spaniards were left active in La Nueve, with many having been assigned to other units in the French army. At the end of the war, a few followed Leclerc to Indochina, several left with armoured vehicles in the direction of Francoist Spain, while others returned to civilian life. Many refused the French citizenship offered to them for having fought within the French army, feeling \\"betrayed\\" by the Allies who did not take up the cause against fascism in Spain. More than fifty members of the company received the Croix de Guerre.  Aftermath and tributes  The role of these Spanish soldiers was quickly forgotten, or omitted for political reasons. This has been changing in the 21st century, however, as their role in the liberation of France, especially of Paris, has been highlighted by a series of commemorations. On 25 August 2004, the City of Paris officially paid homage to the Spaniards of La Nueve. A plaque, with the inscription \\"Aux r√©publicains espagnols, composante principale de la colonne Dronne\\" (\\"to the Spanish republicans, principal component of the Dronne column\\") was inaugurated on the Quai Henri IV, in the presence of then-mayor Bertrand Delano√´, then-president of the Spanish Senate, Francisco Javier Rojo, the Spanish ambassador to France at the time, Francisco Villar, and two of the surviving members of the company, Luis Royo Iba√±ez and . A similar plaque was placed in the Square Gustave-Mesureur, Place Pinel (13th Arrondissement) and another at the centre of the Place Nationale (also in the 13th). On 24 February 2010, veterans of La Nueve Luis Royo Iba√±ez, Manuel Fern√°ndez and Rafael G√≥mez were awarded the M√©daille Grand Vermeil, the highest such award granted by the City of Paris. In 2014, the association 24 Ao√ªt 1944 (\\"24 August 1944\\") organized a series of marches following the route of La Nueve through Paris in commemoration of the 70th anniversary of its liberation. Also in attendance was Rafael G√≥mez, who, as of 20 April 2017, was the last remaining veteran of La Nueve still alive. In March 2015, in Paris, the garden of the H√¥tel de Ville was renamed the Jardin des Combattants de la Nueve (French for \\"Garden of the Soldiers of La Nueve\\"). A ceremony was due to take place in the presence of the King and Queen of Spain, Felipe VI and Letizia, as well as the Mayor of Paris, Anne Hidalgo; however, the crash of Germanwings Flight 9525, where 51 Spanish citizens lost their lives, cut short the royal visit, and the ceremony was rescheduled for 3 June 2015. In a ceremony in April 2017, the Mayors of Madrid and Paris, Manuela Carmena and Anne Hidalgo, officially renamed a municipal park in the Pueblo Nuevo neighborhood of Madrid as the Jard√≠n de los Combatientes de La Nueve (Spanish for \\"Garden of the Soldiers of La Nueve\\"). The last surviving member of La Nueve, Rafael G√≥mez Nieto, died in Strasbourg on March 31, 2020, at the age of 99, a victim of the COVID-19 pandemic.

Education and career Torpey received his bachelor of arts degree from Amherst College in 1981 in political science, before completing his Ph.D. in sociology at University of California, Berkeley in 1992. At Berkeley, Torpey wrote his dissertation under the guidance of Jerome Karabel, Robert Bellah, and Martin Jay, which later became the foundation of his first book Intellectuals, Socialism, and Dissent: The East German Opposition and its Legacy. Torpey has held permanent teaching positions at the University of California, Irvine, the University of British Columbia, and at the Graduate Center, CUNY. In 2010, Torpey was the Fulbright Distinguished Chair in American Studies at the Karl-Franzens-University in Graz, Austria. In addition to teaching, Torpey also sits on the editorial boards of the journals Theory and Society and Journal of Human Rights. Work Torpey has written extensively on the role of the state in shaping modern social life. In Intellectuals, Socialism, and Dissent, Torpey examined the role of intellectuals within the German Democratic Republic, their role in the Republic's eventual collapse, as well as their aspirations for reform. Torpey has also received significant attention for his book The Invention of the Passport: Surveillance, Citizenship, and the State, which examines the institution of the modern passport. In The Invention of the Passport, Torpey borrows from sociologist Max Weber, arguing that states hold a ‚Äúmonopolization of the legitimate means of movement‚Äù and that the passport functions as a way of displacing and amplifying their administrative power. Torpey's most recent scholarship focuses on religion in modern society. Alongside Christian Joppke, Torpey has written on the legal and cultural integration of Islam into Western liberal democracies, comparing the United States, Germany, France, and Canada. He has also been a contributor to the axial age debate.

It was also under development for the treatment of age-related sensorineural hearing loss, but development for this indication was terminated due to insufficient effectiveness. As of July 2018, BIIB-104 is in phase II clinical trials for cognitive symptoms in schizophrenia. BIIB-104 belongs to the biarylpropylsulfonamide group of AMPAR PAMs, which also includes LY-404187, LY-503430, and mibampator (LY-451395) among others. It is described as a \\"high-impact\\" AMPAR PAM, unlike so-called \\"low-impact\\" AMPAR PAMs like CX-516 and its cogener farampator (CX-691, ORG-24448). In animals, low doses of BIIB-104 have been found to enhance cognition and memory, whereas higher doses produce motor coordination disruptions and convulsions. The same effects, as well as neurotoxicity at higher doses, have been observed with orthosteric and other high-impact allosteric AMPAR activators. In healthy volunteers, BIIB-104 has been found to significantly reduce ketamine-induced deficits in verbal learning and working memory without attenuating ketamine- induced psychotomimetic effects. It was able to complete reverse ketamine- induced impairments in spatial working memory in the participants. In addition to its actions on the AMPAR, BIIB-104 has been reported to act as a GlyT1 glycine transporter blocker. As such, it is also a glycine reuptake inhibitor, and may act indirectly to activate the glycine receptor and the glycine co- agonist site of the NMDA receptor by increasing extracellular levels of glycine.
