Personal life Los Yugos Bridge, DeGolyer Library, Southern Methodist University Born circa 1872 in Pennsylvania, Cox was the youngest of three sons of John William (a farmer) and Mary F. Cox. The family moved to the Escondido region (Twin Oaks) of California where Cox began working as a photographer by 1893. From 1896 to 1898, Cox attended Pomona College. By 1899, Cox was working in Mexico City as a photographer; in October of that year, he was joined there in business by fellow San Diegan Ralph J. Carmichael, setting up a photography studio as Cox and Carmichael. Cox sold his interest in the studio in early 1902 and returned to the United States suffering from altitude sickness. In 1903, Cox married school teacher Mary Peter in Pasadena. Cox and his wife moved to Mexico City in 1904, and the next year Cox and partners A. C. Moore, J. Duncan Gleason, and John S. Turner (all from Los Angeles) established the American Printing and Engraving Company there. Cox continued to work in Mexico through 1909, but returned to Escondido in late 1909, again suffering from the effects of Mexico City's high altitude. He sold his photo- engraving business in Mexico City to the owners of the Mexican Herald, and apparently abandoned his career as a photographer. In 1910, he opened a dealership in San Diego selling Lane steamer automobiles, then worked in the photographic supply business in Los Angeles. Cox died suddenly on February 24, 1911 in Pomona. Work Carpintero Bridge. Kilometer 236 Colima, DeGolyer Library, Southern Methodist University Cox was among a group of expatriate photographers (such as fellow San Diegans Carmichael and C. B. Waite) working in Mexico in the first decade of the 20th century, chronicling industrialization and social conditions. Cox‚Äôs subjects included railroads, bridges, mines, and landscapes. His works illustrated magazine articles, and books, and were reproduced as postcards. Many of Cox‚Äôs photographs are included in collections such as the Eugene P. Lyle, Jr. Photographs, University of Oregon; the DeGolyer Library, Southern Methodist University; and the California Border Region Digitization Project of the San Diego History Center. Works by Cox & Carmichael are included in the Collection of Southern California and Mexico Photographs of the Huntington Library. Many also appear in published works. While Cox was considered a fine photographer by contemporaries, recent criticism has focused on Cox's work as representative of American cultural imperialism in Mexico. A number of Cox‚Äôs photographs have been attributed incorrectly to Percy B[oxley] Cox (1875-1946).

Early life  Samuel Kinsey was born in Covington, Ohio on 25 May 1832 to Joel Kinsey and Elizabeth Brumbaugh. On 23 April 1852, he married Barbara Nead, daughter of Peter Nead, and together they had thirteen children. He joined the Brethren as a member in 1853. Kinsey was economically successful, and was at various times a carpenter, a farmer, proprietor of a general store, owner of a tree nursery, and publisher. The place where he lived became known as the town of Kinsey Station. He was a deacon and was elected in 1870 as a recognized minister of Lower Stillwater Brethren congregation in Randolph Township near Dayton, Ohio.  Old Order leadership  Between 1851 and 1865, Brethren periodicals began to be published under progressive editors Henry Kurtz, James Quinter, and Henry Holsinger. At the same time, Kinsey's father-in-law, Peter Nead, was the primary leader for the reactionary wing of the Brethren, also known at the time as Old Order Brethren. Out of this group emerged a new periodical, The Vindicator, with Kinsey as editor. It was first published on 1 March 1870 as an eight-page monthly, composed of scriptural interpretations, exhortations to piety, and news on church affairs. One of its goals was to counter the influence of progressive Brethren periodicals. A major controversy among the Brethren arose over the authority of tradition and the role of the church in establishing a church order or ordnung, known as the \\"order of the Brethren\\". In The Vindicator, Kinsey rejected that the church had any authority to change or adapt the order, as it was based upon Scripture. This view sharply contrasted with other Brethren at the time. The group that became the Church of the Brethren revered tradition and supported the role of the church in discerning an ordnung (Set of rules for church order), but held this order to be changeable. Meanwhile, the faction that became the Brethren Church rejected any need at all for a unified church order or agreement on practices not explicitly defined in Christian Scripture, and sought to eliminate some Brethren traditions which they felt lacked sufficient support from Scriptures. In around 1874, Kinsey handed over control of his business interests to others in order to devote himself to the service of the church. He was a hymn writer. In 1878, Kinsey was one of four men appointed and financially supported by the Southern Ohio District of the Brethren to engage in missionary work in Kentucky. This work was largely unsuccessful. A significant part of Kinsey's ministry was also his ongoing publishing. The Vindicator was expanded to 32 pages per issue. His work was not well received by the majority of Brethren; Kinsey was reprimanded by the 1881 Brethren Annual Meeting for encouraging dissension and criticizing church authorities.1881 Annual Conference Decisions, Article 4, in The Old German Baptist Brethren split at this conference, with Nead and Kinsey as their primary leaders. The proliferation of unauthorized and uncontrolled periodicals has been claimed as a major cause of this division. In 1882, at their first meeting, the Old German Baptist Brethren recognized The Vindicator as their official publication. Kinsey was also ordained as an elder in 1882.  Death and legacy  Kinsey died on 8 June 1883. He was succeeded as editor by Joseph I. Cover. The Vindicator set a precedent of conservative periodicals that was followed by Mennonite George R. Brunk's Sword and Trumpet. Kinsey has continued to be influential in the Old German Baptist Brethren. The Vindicator continues to be published for the Old German Baptist Brethren as of 2008.

Background  In 882 the Banu Qasi ruler Muhammad ibn Lubb ibn Qasi who, like his father Lubb ibn Musa before him, had previously had good relations with the Christian kingdoms to his north, joined in a coalition with the forces of the Cordoban emir Muhammad I of C√≥rdoba. The emir, as a gesture of good will, sent his son al-Mundhir of C√≥rdoba to join ibn Lubb on raids along the Ebro. Ibn Lubb made his way from Zaragoza along the Ebro and devastated the valleys he passed through in La Rioja, which at the time belonged to the king of Zaragoza, Isma'el ibn Musa, and the King of Tudela, Navarre, Fortun ibn Musa, both of whom were uncles of ibn Lubb.  The battle  On their arrival at Cellorigo, ibn Lubb and al-Mundhir attempted to take the castle, as it was strategically positioned to protect one of the few passes crossing the Obarenes Mountains. The castle was defended by Vela Jim√©nez, count of the Asturian county of √Ålava. The attack left both armies with many wounded and the Muslim forces were unable to succeed in taking the castle. Afterwards, al-Mundir took a sizable portion of the Muslim army and went to Pancorbo, another mountain pass through the Obarenes. The assault on the castle became prolonged over a number of days, finishing with another Muslim retreat and many casualties. After these retreats, king Alfonso III of Asturias ordered Jim√©nez and the Castilian count Diego Rodr√≠guez Porcelos to pursue ibn Lubb and al-Mundhir. After being pursued for some time, the Muslim leaders sued for peace.

Elected to Parliament in the 1950s, he was a founding member of Rhodesian Front in 1962. He was Minister without portfolio in the cabinet of Prime Minister Ian Smith at the time of Rhodesia's Unilateral Declaration of Independence in 1965. In 1968, after serving as Deputy Minister of Agriculture, he was appointed Minister of Internal Affairs, a position he held until 1974, when he exited politics.  Early life and education  Smith was born on 17 January 1910, in Felixstowe, Suffolk, England, United Kingdom, the son of a tailor.Who's Who in Africa: The Political, Military and Business Leaders of Africa, John Dickie, Alan Rake African Development, 1973, page 382  Career   Early career  Smith emigrated to Rhodesia at age 25, intending to join the police force. Instead, he became a successful farmer, and was later elected chairman of the Rhodesian Farmers' Association. Smith was elected to the Southern Rhodesian Legislative Assembly in the 1950s as a member of the United Federal Party, and was known as a moderate MP. He opposed the 1961 Constitution and its creation of separate voting rolls for blacks and whites. He favored a common roll system that would afford educated, middle class black Rhodesians a say in government. Nevertheless, in 1962, he was one of the earliest members of the Rhodesian Front party, which supported independence for Southern Rhodesia and separate voting rolls. He was reelected to the Legislative Assembly in 1962 as the MP for the Lomagundi constituency.Parliamentary Debates ‚Äì Legislative Assembly, Volume 72, 1968, page 231 On 14 April 1964, he was appointed Minister without portfolio by the new Prime Minister, Ian Smith. Following the May 1965 elections, Smith was reelected to Parliament and was appointed Parliamentary Secretary to the Rhodesian Minister of Agriculture, and also became Deputy Speaker of the House of Assembly and Chairman of Committees. On 11 November 1965, Smith was present at (but did not sign) Rhodesia's Unilateral Declaration of Independence (UDI). In 1967, Smith was elevated to Deputy Minister of Agriculture, serving under Minister Jack Howman. In that office, he traveled around Rhodesia, speaking with farmers who were struggling under foreign sanctions imposed as a result of the UDI. In meetings with groups of farmers and stakeholders, he informed them that the Rhodesian government would only contribute 2% of the cost of restoring viability to the country's agricultural industry, with farmers expected to contribute 98% themselves.  Minister of Internal Affairs  Smith was provided the opportunity for a more prominent role in government with the dismissal of William Harper from the cabinet in 1968. Ian Smith appointed him Minister of Internal Affairs (Harper's former position) on 16 August 1968. He was reappointed on 13 April 1970, shortly after the general election. In the run-up to the 1969 Rhodesian constitutional referendum, which sought to sever Rhodesia's links to the British monarchy and declare itself a republic, Smith was one of the country's fiercest proponents of republic status; on 30 May 1969, he denounced the Queen as a \\"figurehead and mouthpiece of whatever government is in power in England.\\"Who's Who in Africa: The Political, Military and Business Leaders of Africa, John Dickie, Alan Rake African Development, 1973, page 382 In 1970, he became acting Minister of Lands. On 3 September 1970, he spoke before the Parliament, urging them to pass the Land Tenure Amendment Bill, so that churches could continue their interracial worship and other activities. As Minister of Internal Affairs, Smith introduced plans for black Rhodesians to be required to carry identity cards when working outside of designated areas. These plans were defeated at the Rhodesian Front's annual party congress in October 1971. After the May 1972 Pearce Commission verdict against the provisional independence proposal, he advised black Rhodesians in June 1972 that they would have to rely on themselves to improve their position, and that external assistance would not be available. His \\"provincialisation\\" plans, announced on 13 July 1972, were intended to shift control of tribal areas from the white government to African chiefs, thus trending towards separate development for blacks and whites. He also established the Tribal Trust Land Development Corporation. Smith, who was considered to be a moderate politician, grew in popularity in Rhodesian Front during the early 1970s, as reflected by his election as vice president of the party at the annual congress on 23 September 1972. In October 1972, he was entrusted with the opening of dialogue with Zimbabwe African National Union leader Abel Muzorewa. In 1974, Smith was awarded Grand Officer of the Legion of Merit. At the ceremony, his accomplishments as Minister of Internal Affairs were described thus: > \\"Whilst Minister of Internal Affairs, Mr. Smith established an excellent > relationship with Chiefs, Headmen and the African public generally. As > Minister he was held in great respect on account of his integrity, his > understanding of and sympathy with human problems, his never failing > courtesy and humility... His courage and energy were recognized by many and > his first thought was always for the good of Rhodesia.\\"  Later life and death  Smith did not run for reelection to Parliament in 1974, and also left office as Minister of Internal Affairs that same year. Following Zimbabwe's independence in 1980, Smith, unlike many whites who emigrated, remained in the country and settled in Banket.  Personal life  Smith was married. He shared no family relation to Rhodesian Prime Minister Ian Smith.

The work was commissioned by the Kansas City Symphony and was completed in early 2011. It was first performed by the Kansas City Symphony under the direction of Michael Stern at the Kauffman Center for the Performing Arts in Kansas City on March 4, 2011. Composition Background Schoenberg was inspired to write the American Symphony by the 2008 U.S. Presidential election, about which he wrote, \\"...both parties asked the people to embrace change and make a difference. I was both excited and honored about ushering in this new era in our nation's history, and for the first time, I truly understood what it meant to be American.\\" The composer cited Aaron Copland's Symphony No. 3, which Schoenberg described as \\"the quintessential American symphony,\\" as a musical influence on the work. He wrote, \\"Quite serendipitously, I heard Copland's 3rd three nights after President Obama was elected and, seeing that our country and world had needs similar to those of Copland's time, I was inspired to make a difference. I set out to write a modern American symphony that paid homage to our past and looked forward to a brighter future.\\" Despite this, Shoenberg described the American Symphony as \\"not a patriotic work,\\" adding, \\"the symphony reflects a respect and responsibility for the great potential of our nation and a hunger to affect positive change. It is about our collective ability to restore hope within ourselves and our neighbors, both here and around the world.\\"Schoenberg, Adam (2011). Program Notes: American Symphony. Retrieved August 28, 2017. Structure The symphony has a duration of approximately 24 minutes and is cast in five movements: #Fanfare #White on Blue #Rondo #Prayer #Stars, Stripes, and Celebration Instrumentation The work is scored for a large orchestra consisting of three flutes (third doubling piccolo), three oboes (third doubling cor anglais), three clarinets (third doubling bass clarinet), three bassoons (third doubling contrabassoon), four horns, three trumpets, three trombones, tuba, harp, piano (doubling celesta), timpani, four percussionists, and strings. Reception Reviewing the world premiere, the music critic Timothy McDonald of The Kansas City Star highly praised the symphony, writing, \\"Schoenberg demonstrated a distinctive and exciting compositional voice. His American Symphony is bold and brilliant, and deserves to be a staple among orchestras in the U.S. and abroad.\\" Paul Horsley of Kansas City-based journal The Independent called it an \\"agreeable new piece\\" and wrote, \\"If the finale felt prolix in proportion to the overall length of the symphony, the piece revealed the soul of a strong musician with a natural sense of melody, a playful knack for rhythm and a serious approach to orchestration.\\" Reviewing a later performance of the piece with the Waterloo- Cedar Falls Symphony, George Day of The Waterloo-Cedar Falls Courier observed, \\"Its five movements are mostly brisk, sometimes noisy, but always engaging. The music speaks of the variety, vitality and optimism of the American spirit. Not exactly a patriotic work, it nevertheless conveys a respect, even a reverence, for the past and future of America.\\" He added, \\"Schoenberg clearly knows how to orchestrate, and I am sure we have not heard the last of him.\\" Recording A recording of the American Symphony featuring the Kansas City Symphony under the direction of Michael Stern was released through Reference Recordings on January 20, 2017.

Early life and education Ole Berendt Suhr was born in Nyborg where his father by the same name was a merchant and his mother Laurine Marie M√ºller (1795‚Äì1876) was a daughter of the wealthy merchant Rasmus M√∏ller. Suhr moved to Copenhagen where he studied theology at the University of Copenhagen from 1832 to 1838 while in the same time training as a merchant in the family's trading house J. P. Suhr & S√∏n which was managed by his uncle Johannes Theodorus Suhr. He soon won his uncle's respect and it was therefore decided that he was later to take over the company. Career On 1 January 1856, Ole Berendt Suhr took over J. P. Suhr & S√∏n after his uncle who remained active in the company for another few years. The transaction was partly financed through a cheap loan from Den Suhrske Stiftelse. Trade in coal remained the principal activity of the company but from 1867 he also operated a coke and cinder business at Christiansholm. In 1856 Suhr began a collaboration with 26-year old Carl Frederik Tietgen who had just established a trading house at Gammeltorv after his return from England. They shared an interest in cryolite from Greenland. In 1857, they were both co-founders of the bank Privatbanken where. Tietgen served as bank manager while Suhr became vice chairman of the board. Suhr was also a co-founder and board member of the telephone companies that Tietgen established in the 1860s that were later merged into the Great Northern Telephone Company. He was also a co-founder and board member of Det Forenede Dampskibs-Selskab in 1866 and De Danske Sukkerfabrikker in 1872. Property In 1868 Suhr purchased the vast Petersgaard Forest District near Vordingborg from the government for 580,000 Danish rigsdaler. Two years later he also purchased the Petersgaard estate for 245,000 rigsdaler from the son of one of his old business partners. He was a professional member of s√∏- og handelsretten from 1861 to 1877.

She was the daughter of J√∏rgen Peter Bech (1782‚Äì1846) and Ellen Sophie Magdalene Bech n√©e Meyer (1784‚Äì1846). In 1873, Suhr was hit by an apoplectic stroke. His widow became the sole owner of the company after his death in 1875 but their son-in-law Andreas Julius Lauritz Holmblad (1852‚Äì1896) and longterm associate Svend Wilhelm Isberg (1820‚Äì95) became partners in the company in 1877.

The film was directed by Stephen S. Campanelli and written by Dennis Foon. An adaptation of Ojibwe author Richard Wagamese's 2012 novel Indian Horse, the film centres on Saul Indian Horse, a young Canadian First Nations boy who survives the Indian residential school system to become a star ice hockey player. The film and the book highlight the story behind Canada's indigenous residential schools. The film stars Sladen Peltier as Saul at age 6, Forrest Goodluck as Saul at age 15, and Ajuawak Kapashesit as Saul at age 22, as well as Edna Manitowabi, Evan Adams, Michiel Huisman, Michael Murphy and Martin Donovan. The film was originally slated for production as a television film to air on Super Channel, but instead premiered as a theatrical film after Super Channel filed for bankruptcy in 2016. The film was shot primarily in Sudbury and Peterborough, Ontario. Plot The Indian Horse family, including six- year-old Saul and his older brother, retreat in canoes deep into the wild to avoid the authorities after Saul's older brother is left seriously ill by his time in an Indian residential school. Saul resolves never to go to a residential school, but his parents, converted to Christianity, are determined their eldest son will go to heaven. When the boy dies, they take him away to be blessed by a priest after he dies from his illness, leaving Saul with his grandmother deep in the woods. The parents don‚Äôt return. Saul and his grandmother stay and camp, but once cold weather starts, his grandmother decides they must continue their trek towards their ancestral lands. After their canoe capsizes, they must huddle to stay warm at night; they continue their journey on foot through snow. When his grandmother dies, Saul is discovered by the authorities and forcibly moved to a residential school. There, he meets a boy named Lonnie, who cannot speak English. The top official, Father Quinney, and his nun deem Lonnie an unsuitable name and call him Aaron, and forbid the use of the boys' Ojibwe language, beating Lonnie when he cannot comply. In the school, Saul witnesses the nuns and instructors abuse the children, and struggles to survive. One instructor, Father Gaston Leboutilier, seems to want to change the school. He convinces Father Quinney to allow a new outdoor activity, ice hockey. Saul does not meet the age requirement to play, but he convinces Father Leboutilier to give him the job of maintaining the rink in the early morning, which allows him to spend time on the ice. From watching televised hockey games and practicing in the mornings, Saul also begins learning techniques. When one of the school's players is injured, Saul steps forward as a substitute and astounds Father Leboutilier with his talent. Saul declines to join Lonnie's escape attempt, as Saul was looking forward to playing; Lonnie is recaptured and punished. Saul shows remarkable hockey skills on the school team. When he becomes a teen, the school allows Saul to leave and move into a foster home with an Indigenous family in a mining town, where he can further pursue hockey. Saul joins an all-Indigenous team called the Moose, who travel to games between Indian reserves, and receives the jersey number 13, \\"for luck\\". Winning a key game, Saul is treated as a star player in Hockey Night in Canada style, but the team faces racial discrimination and beatings afterwards in a pub. Saul attracts the notice of the Toronto Monarchs, a feeder team for the Toronto Maple Leafs, but does not want to leave his friends in the Moose. His team insists he take the offer, and he reluctantly joins the Monarchs. There, he keeps his number 13, which no one else wants due to triskaidekaphobia. Initially excelling, he is nevertheless put off by a racist caricature of him in the newspaper. On the ice, Saul becomes the target of racist slurs from opponents and teammates alike, while the audience throws toy Indian figures onto the ice. Pushed into violence by many fouls, he is confined to the penalty box. He is stunned when Father Leboutilier appears one night, professing pride in where hockey has taken Saul, and admitting the abuses in the school were wrong. Father Leboutilier tells Saul that the church is sending him to work in Africa. Leboutilier's appearance causes Saul to have flashbacks to the abuses committed at the school, and he leaves the team. Taking odd low-level jobs, he drifts from place to place between 1979 and 1989. He sees Lonnie in an alley, drinking liquor. Saul drinks a lot and develops alcoholism. Facing serious health issues after severe damage to his liver, Saul is accepted by the Indigenous rehabilitation centre Rising Dawn. The group therapy leader, seeing how sad and withdrawn Saul is, encourages him to confront the root of his suffering. Saul travels back to the now closed school, where it is revealed that he had been sexually molested by Father Leboutilier. He makes a pilgrimage by canoe back to his ancestral lands, and then returns to his foster family, where he is happily welcomed by his foster family and former Moose teammates. Cast Reception Released to average reviews, Indian Horse was a box office bomb, garnering only $1.69 million on an $8 million budget. However, Indian Horse was the highest-grossing English Canadian film of 2018. On review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, the film holds an approval rating of 75%, based on 12 reviews, and an average rating of 5.89/10. Awards and accolades The film won the top award at the 2017 Vancouver International Film Festival and the Kumeyaay Eagle Award for Best Native American Film at the 2018 San Diego International Film Festival. Sladen Peltier was nominated for a Canadian Screen Award nomination for Best Supporting Actor at the 6th Canadian Screen Awards, but he lost to Ethan Hawke in Maudie. Controversy Minor controversy erupted over the casting of Will Strongheart in the supporting role of Virgil in the film due to the actor's history of criminal domestic violence. Strongheart has attributed his past actions to problems with drugs and alcohol, stating that he regrets such actions, and has reformed since attaining sobriety in 2010.Bellrichard, Chantelle. \\"Actor's history of domestic violence brought to light as Indian Horse opens in theatres across Canada\\".

From 2015-2018, he served as editor-in-chief of the peer-review journal Geophysical Research Letters (published by American Geophysical Union). He is known for his research on the climate system, including the effects of global warming on extreme weather and climate events such as the 2011-2017 California drought. Scientific research Diffenbaugh received his Ph.D. in Earth Sciences from the University of California, Santa Cruz in 2003. His dissertation was entitled ‚ÄúGlobal and regional controls on Holocene environments‚Äù. His dissertation focused on understanding regional climate change in paleoclimate periods and in modern periods. His dissertation introduced the hypothesis that as vegetation responds to changes in climate, those changes could impact coastal ocean systems by altering the atmospheric pressure patterns that drive coastal winds. In 2004, Diffenbaugh began a faculty position at Purdue University. While at Purdue, he published first results of high-resolution regional climate simulations for large continental areas, including the United States, Europe and India, which enabled analysis of the role of fine-scale climate processes in extreme events. These high-resolution climate model simulations also enabled analyses of potential impacts of climate change on a suite of systems, including premium winegrapes, corn pests, and snowmelt runoff. In 2009, Diffenbaugh moved to a faculty position at Stanford University. He continued his work on the dynamics and impacts of fine-scale climate change, and also began working in the emerging area of ‚Äúextreme event attribution‚Äù. This work culminated in the publication of a new, generalized framework for testing the influence of global warming on individual extreme weather and climate events. The extreme event for which Diffenbaugh is most well known is the 2011-2017 California drought.From 2014-2016, Diffenbaugh's research group published three widely cited papers analyzing the drought and the role of global warming. These studies analyzed the role of high temperature in amplifying the effects of low precipitation, as well as the role of the Ridiculously Resilient Ridge, a term coined by Diffenbaugh's then- Ph.D. student Daniel Swain to describe the large area of persistently high atmospheric pressure that blocked many storms from reaching California for much of the drought. At Stanford, Diffenbaugh also began collaborations to quantify the economic impacts of climate change. This work has included quantifying the economic damages associated with different levels of global warming (including the levels identified in the UN Paris Agreement), as well as the role that global warming has played in shaping economic inequality between countries. Science communication Diffenbaugh is active in science communication. He has served on a number of government science panels, including the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, the United States Climate Change Science Program, and the California Climate-Safe Infrastructure Working Group. He has provided testimony to the United States Congress and the California State Assembly. He was also a member of the What We Know panel of the American Association for the Advancement of Science. Diffenbaugh has written a number of opinion articles. These include op-eds in The New York Times about extreme climate events such as the 2011-2017 California drought and Hurricane Harvey, and the process of climate science. He has also written for the public on the importance of peer review, including a Top 10 list of reviewer comments that Diffenbaugh stated came from papers on which he was the first author. Diffenbaugh frequently speaks to the public about climate change. In 2011, he was a Google Science Communication Fellow. He was an early adopter of Hangouts On Air, through which he conducted open discussions about climate change with the public. In 2017, Diffenbaugh was the faculty moderator for Stanford University's Three Books Program, in which all incoming first- year undergraduate students are sent three books over the summer, and the authors come to campus for a panel discussion during New Student Orientation. Diffenbaugh selected the theme of ‚ÄúSustainability and Equity‚Äù, and assigned Salvage The Bones by Jesmyn Ward, Homegoing by Yaa Gyasi, and The Sixth Extinction by Elizabeth Kolbert. About choosing the books, Diffenbaugh said, \\"Once you begin to examine the relationship between people and the environment, it becomes clear that the big global challenges for this generation lie at the intersection of sustainability and equity ‚Äì the two are inextricably linked.\\" At Stanford, he teaches a course called \\"The Global Warming Paradox\\" that examines this challenge. Personal life Diffenbaugh discussed his upbringing in a 2017 interview on the science podcast Forecast. Diffenbaugh grew up at Mount Madonna Center, an intentional community in the Santa Cruz Mountains of California that was founded in 1978 by Diffenbaugh's parents and other students of Baba Hari Dass. He attended Mount Madonna School from kindergarten through high school, graduating in 1992. Diffenbaugh attended college at Stanford University, where he was a member of the varsity men's volleyball team. After college, he returned to Mount Madonna Center for three years. During that time, he taught high school science and coached volleyball at Mount Madonna School, before entering graduate school at the University of California, Santa Cruz, where he describes struggling to find a sense of scientific confidence and direction. Diffenbaugh and his wife Polly Diffenbaugh live on the Stanford campus, and have three children. He is the grandson of computer pioneer Erwin Tomash, and brother-in-law of novelist Vanessa Diffenbaugh. Selected publications Journal articles *Diffenbaugh, N.S. and M.

On the flight to Ben Shemen, besieged on June 25th, 1948, he landed his plane for the supply of ammunition. After landing the aircraft in the area, he worked under heavy fire to protect the aircraft from bullet wounds and to enable his return by driving a tractor loaded with sandbags to serve as a defensive wall. For this he was awarded, after his death, the Hero of Israel award. In the fierce battles over Gush Etzion he participated in bombing and shooting a Bren from the air. In these operations he was hit and wounded by gunfire, but continued to fight. At the end of the campaign he was chosen as a commander of an aviation base and then spent a few months training in Czechoslovakia. A week after his return, he participated in Operation Horev, during which he toured the Nitzana area and lowered the altitude of a flight to help another plane. At this stage he was hit by four Egyptian fighter jets and killed with his flight partner.

Automaton Rover for Extreme Environments (AREE) is a NASA Innovative Advanced Concepts project to design a rover that can operate in the environment of Venus, controlled by a wind-powered mechanical computer. Venus' atmosphere is about 90 times denser than Earth's and the surface temperature of at least , conditions which would prevent a standard electronic computer from operating for any significant period of time. While AREE is being designed for operation on Venus, the rover's design could be re-purposed for use on Mercury, which has a comparably high surface temperature, on Jovian moons Europa or Io, where high radiation makes use of traditional electronics difficult, or on lava flows or highly radioactive areas on Earth. The project was first proposed in 2015, and funded by the NASA Innovative Advanced Concepts program with a phase-I study in 2016, and a phase-II study from 2017-2018.Sauder, Jonathan (6 Aug. 2017). Automaton Rover for Extreme Environments (AREE), NASA. Editor: Loura Hall. Retrieved 20 Oct. 2019. Rover design Though the JPL team initially planned to design an entirely mechanical rover, this was soon deemed to be impractical compared to a hybrid mechanical-electric design. AREE's unique feature is the use of mechanical analog computers instead of digital computers (as used in other robotic spacecraft), which cannot tolerate the high temperatures of Venus. Instead of using a single general-purpose mechanical computer, like Babbage's Analytical Engine, the rover would rely on a suite of simpler, single-purpose devices distributed throughout the vehicle, analogous to World War II shipboard fire control computers. The rover would also use purely mechanical sensors for some of its instrumentation: temperature, wind speed, barometric pressure, seismic activity, and even chemical composition of samples can be measured mechanically. AREE is to be powered primarily by a Savonius wind turbine. The turbine would directly drive the wheels and also store energy in a composite spring. The rover would also carry high-temperature solar panelsLandis, Geoffrey A.; Haag, Emily (14-17 July 2013).

Multiple communication options are being explored, including a high temperature transponder, radar retroreflectors, and inscribing data on phonograph-style records that are then delivered to a high-altitude drone via hydrogen balloon. Target AREE's proposed target is near Sekmet Mons. This target was chosen because it is outside the parabolas of impact debris from any of Venus' impact craters, thus allowing the rover to directly study Venus' volcanic geology. AREE would travel northwest from its landing zone, crossing (and sampling) several lava flows. The proposed landing site is also located near a Tessera region, raising the possibility that the rover's mission could end with it exploring the Tessera.

They are native to Central America but were discovered in a flooded quarry in New South Wales (NSW) Australia in 2004. Although efforts were made to eradicate them in 2004 and 2005, the fish remain. Jack Dempsey cichlids are one of about 30 aquarium fish species that have become established in Australian waterways, and have been shown to have a significant impact on Australian aquatic ecosystems. They highlight the importance of preventing the importation of invasive fish species because they are extremely difficult or impossible to eradicate once they become established in the wild. Description Jack Dempsey cichlids are a medium- sized fish which can be distinguished from other cichlids by the presence of two grey-black bars on the top of their head which extend forward between their eyes. Their background colour is dark blue and they have a series of white to iridescent blue spots on their fins, head and body, and a series of dark bars along their sides. In Australia, they are a popular aquarium fish typically sold to tropical freshwater tanks, although their aggressive nature means they ‚Äòare not suitable for community tanks‚Äô. They can live more than 10 years and can reach 25 cm in length. They prefer temperatures of between 22 and 30oC, but can survive in temperatures as low as 8-10oC. Jack Dempsey cichlids feed opportunistically on a range of organisms including insects, worms, crayfish, molluscs, small fish and algae. In the wild they are found in warm murky water including mangroves and the lower reaches of rivers and streams. Females lay approximately 500-800 eggs per clutch. The eggs are protected by both parents, which are extremely aggressive towards other fish during the spawning season. Australian occurrence A population of Jack Dempsey cichlids was found in early 2004 in the Angourie area, near Yamba on the NSW north coast. This population is confined to an isolated flooded quarry locally known as the ‚ÄòGreen Pool‚Äô. There are no other known naturalised populations of Jack Dempsey cichlids in Australia. Because Jack Dempsey cichlids are popular pets there is little doubt that this population established from illegally released aquarium fish. Eradication attempts When Jack Dempseys were first discovered in the Green Pool, Angourie the NSW Department of Primary Industries (DPI) considered them to be a good target for eradication because the pool was relatively small, confined, and contained few native fish. Three eradication attempts were carried out between September 2004 and June 2005 using explosives. Large Australian bass were then released into the pool to prey on any remaining larvae or juveniles that were not killed by the blasts. Follow up monitoring by the NSW DPI has found Jack Dempsey cichlids remain in the pool. It is possible that some fish survived eradication attempts or that they were deliberately re-introduced. According to the NSW DPI, no further eradication work is planned. Impacts The features that make cichlids popular pets are also those that contribute to their invasive potential: ‚Äòthey are hardy, adaptable and breed prolifically‚Äô. Cichlids have the potential to dominate native fish populations through their aggressive behaviour and competition for food and space. They eat almost anything smaller than themselves, including fish, invertebrates and frogs . As relatively large and aggressive carnivores they could have devastating impacts on native fish populations if they spread to other waterways, such as the nearby Clarence River. Cichlids also have the potential to introduce disease into wild fish populations. Many pathogens and parasites have been recorded in imported ornamental fish in quarantine and post-quarantine in Australia. Social and economic impacts include the costs of control, impacts on recreationally valued fish, including the spread of disease. Biosecurity There are growing concerns about the ongoing importation of aquarium fish such as Jack Dempsey chichlids into Australia. More than two-thirds of naturalised non-native fish in Australia are thought to have come from the aquarium trade, and non-native fish species are ‚Äòimplicated in the decline of 42 per cent of Australian native fish and several frog species‚Äô. On the basis of significant potential impacts on biodiversity, the Australian Government's Threatened Species Scientific Committee determined that the process of introducing fish outside their natural geographic distribution met the criteria for listing as a key threatening process (KTP). However, the process has not yet been listed as a KTP, and several hundred aquarium fish species continue to be permitted for import into Australia, including more than 250 fresh water species. In 2004-05 alone, 15 million fish were imported. According to experts, a large part of the problem stems from inadequate import assessments and controls. For example, an extensive review of introduced aquarium fish in Australia concluded that assessments are ‚Äòbased on information obtained overseas and are likely to be of limited value in predicting the likelihood of environmental impacts in Australian waters‚Äô. In assessing the case for revised import controls ‚Äì particularly in the context of introduced diseases, scientists recommended that ‚Äòthe number of species traded and the number of sources permitted need to be dramatically reduced to facilitate hazard identification, risk assessment and import quarantine controls.‚Äô References Cichlasomatinae Introduced fish species Invasive animal species in Australia ","title":"Jack Dempsey cichlids in Australia"},{"id":"55066481","text":"North Gauhati College, established in 1962, is one of the oldest degree colleges situated in Guwahati, Assam.

He fled to Soviet Russia after the 1918 Finnish Civil War and made a long career in the Red Army and the Soviet Border Troops. V√§h√§ was one of the few Finnish exile revolutionaries who survived the Great Purge. He is best known for his role in the 1925 capture of the British super-spy Sidney Reilly during the Operation Trust.  Early life  Toivo V√§h√§ was born to the family of Juho V√§h√§, an industrial worker, and Maria Lindstr√∂m. He started working at the age of 14, having several jobs in Helsinki. In 1916, V√§h√§ moved to the industrial community of Dubrovka, near the Russian capital Saint Petersburg. At the time, Finland was an autonomous part of the Russian Empire. V√§h√§ had five brothers, who all followed him to Russia after the 1917 February revolution. Their father had emigrated to Russia few years earlier. As the Finnish Civil War broke out in January 1918, V√§h√§ joined the Saint Petersburg Finnish Red Guard, a paramilitary unit composed of Finnish emigrant workers in Saint Petersburg. The battalion was sent to Finland, where V√§h√§ fought in the Battle of K√§m√§r√§, and later served as a courier in the Battle of Vilppula. As the Red front collapsed in the Northern Tavastia region, the Saint Petersburg Reds retreated to eastern Finland. After the decisive loss of the Battle of Vyborg in late April, many fled to Soviet Russia. Like hundreds of other Finnish exile Red Guard fighters, V√§h√§ joined the Red Army and fought with the Bolsheviks in the Russian Civil War. In the summer of 1919 V√§h√§ served in Siberia, and was then sent back to Petrograd to join the military academy. In 1920‚Äì1923, V√§h√§ took a three-year course at the international Petrograd Red Officer School, where he was joined by four of his brothers. During his time in the academy, V√§h√§ took part in the arrests of the suspects of the Kuusinen Club Incident in September 1920, the suppression of the Kronstadt rebellion in March 1921, and the suppression of the East Karelian uprising in the winter of 1922. After the Battle of Kimasozero in January 1922, V√§h√§ killed three captured Finnish White Guard soldiers on the orders of his platoon leader Toivo Antikainen. Antikainen was later captured in Finland, where he received a life sentence for the murders. After his graduation in March 1923, V√§h√§ was recruited by the NKVD. He served as a border station commander at the Finnish border in the Karelian Isthmus. From 1924 V√§h√§ worked for the GPU in Leningrad, until he was moved to a border station in Sestroretsk in June 1925. Soviet border troops in Transbaikalia. Toivo V√§h√§ in the middle. Operation Trust In 1924, the Soviet secret police Cheka recruited V√§h√§ to Operation Trust. It was launched in 1921 to set up a fake resistance organization, to identify anti-Bolsheviks. V√§h√§ played the role of a Soviet traitor who helped the counter-revolutionaries, Russian emigrants and western agents to sneak from Finland to the Soviet Union. He was recruited by Finnish Army Intelligence, who mistook V√§h√§ for an ordinary Soviet border guard. In reality he was working under the command of the Polish revolutionary Stanis≈Çaw Messing, the head of the Leningrad Cheka. Finnish intelligence trusted V√§h√§, and even recommended him to the British Secret Intelligence Service. In September 1925 the Cheka managed to lure the British agent Sidney Reilly into crossing the border. V√§h√§ smuggled him across the Sestra River and took Reilly to the Pargolovo railway station, where he was arrested. The Finns had successfully tested the route just a few days earlier, when V√§h√§ escorted the courier of the White general Alexander Kutepov to the Soviet side. Reilly was taken to Moscow for interrogation and shot in November 1925. To complete the operation, the Cheka staged V√§h√§'s death to mislead the British. He was held at the Hotel Evropeiskaya in Leningrad, and then secretly shipped to Moscow. Cheka put out a rumour that V√§h√§ was shot as a traitor. In Moscow he was given a new identity as Ivan Petrov. In 1925‚Äì28, V√§h√§ studied in the Border Academy, but was sent to the Far East after an old acquaintance recognized him. V√§h√§ then served on the Chinese border in the Argun River area, and fought in the 1929 Sino-Soviet conflict.  The Great Purge and the World War II  Between 1934 and 1937, V√§h√§ served in the Black Sea and the Belorussian Border Guards. He had kept his real identity secret, but as Stalin launched the campaign against ‚Ä≥nationalists‚Ä≥, V√§h√§'s Finnish accent attracted attention. Unfortunately he had close relations with the Army Commander Ieronim Uborevich, who was executed during the Case of Trotskyist Anti-Soviet Military Organization. V√§h√§ was arrested in February 1938, then declared an ‚Ä≥enemy of the people‚Ä≥ and given the death penalty. For some reason, he was not executed immediately, but kept on a death row for more than a year. In November 1939 V√§h√§ was given a chance to join the army of the Finnish Democratic Republic, a puppet government created during the 1939‚Äì1940 Winter War. After the war, he was named as commander of the Red Army Infantry Regiment 126, which was composed of Karelians, Ingrians and Finns. Instead of Ivan Petrov, V√§h√§ was using his real name again. As Nazi Germany launched its campaign against the Soviet Union in June 1941 he was replaced by another Finnish-born officer, Valter Valli. V√§h√§ became the commander of Infantry Regiment 143, and shortly after of Infantry Regiment 936 of the 3rd Belorussian Front. In September 1941, V√§h√§ was wounded near the town of Staraya Russa. After his recovery, he was sent to Ural, where he served as the head of the Zlatoust Infantry Academy until January 1946. Last years V√§h√§ served his last years as a KGB colonel in Kaliningrad. After 1964 V√§h√§ lived in Zhytomyr Oblast in Ukraine and managed various state enterprises. He retired in 1967, and moved to Petrozavodsk in the Karelian ASSR. V√§h√§ wrote an autobiography which was released in 1970 and translated into Finnish in 1974. He also wrote three other memoirs, including one on Operation Trust, and several short stories that were published in the Finnish-language Karelian literature magazine Punalippu. Operation Trust was brought to public attention in 1964. Newspaper stories mentioned V√§h√§'s name, calling him a Soviet hero. V√§h√§'s family finally learnt about his former life. When V√§h√§ went underground in 1925, he had abandoned his wife and daughter. V√§h√§ later married again and had another daughter, who was named Lilya, as was his first child. During his last years V√§h√§ publicly criticised Stalinism. He also paid attention to the mistakes of the Soviet Communist Party, which he had joined in 1920. Death Toivo V√§h√§ died in Petrozavodsk in 1984 at the age of 83. The bust on his grave was erected by the KGB. Still highly respected in Russia, in 2001 his last hometown, Petrozavodsk, arranged a large festival to celebrate V√§h√§'s 100th anniversary. In 1990, Soviet author Oleg Tikhonov published a documentary novel of V√§h√§'s life.

The work was commissioned by the Kansas City Symphony and the Nelson-Atkins Museum of Art. It was first performed by the Kansas City Symphony conducted by Michael Stern at the Kauffman Center for the Performing Arts in Kansas City on February 1, 2013. Composition Background Schoenberg received the commission for Picture Studies in November 2011 from the Kansas City Symphony and the Nelson-Atkins Museum of Art, with the request that he write \\"a 21st-century Pictures at an Exhibition\\" based on pieces from their collection. Schoenberg was immediately taken by the idea and visited the museum three times over the course of six months to conceptualize the work. Ultimately, eight of Picture Studies's movements would be based on four paintings, three photographs, and one sculpture‚Äîall by different artists. The works that inspired the movements are, respectively, Albert Bloch's painting \\"The Three Pierrots No. 2,\\" Kurt Baasch photograph \\"Repetition,\\" Vincent Van Gogh's painting \\"Olive Orchard,\\" Wassily Kandinsky's painting \\"Rose with Gray,\\" Alexander Calder's sculpture \\"Untitled, 1937,\\" Joan Mir√≥'s painting \\"Women at Sunrise,\\" Hiroshi Sugimoto photograph \\"Atlantic Ocean, Cliffs of Moher,\\" and Francis Blake's photograph \\"Pigeons in Flight.\\"Schoenberg, Adam (2012). Program Notes: Picture Studies. Retrieved August 28, 2017. Structure Picture Studies has a duration of approximately 27 minutes and is cast in ten movements: #Intro #Three Pierrots #Repetition #Olive Orchard #Kandinsky #Calder's World #Mir√≥ #Interlude #Cliffs of Moher #Pigeons in Flight Instrumentation The work is scored for a large orchestra consisting of three flutes (second and third doubling piccolo), three oboes (third doubling cor anglais), three clarinets (second doubling E-flat clarinet, third doubling bass clarinet), three bassoons (third doubling contrabassoon), four horns, three trumpets, three trombones, tuba, harp, piano (doubling celesta), timpani, three percussionists, and strings. Reception Reviewing the world premiere, the music critic Timothy L. McDonald of The Kansas City Star highly praised the piece, remarking, \\"Schoenberg's work is a gem, employing a broad palette of orchestral colors and musical forms. Even within individual movements, the music is kaleidoscopic, with ever-changing colors and textures.\\" McDonald continued, \\"Whether the sensuous melody of the 'Olive Orchard,' the jaunty whimsicality of 'The Three Pierrots' or the explosive rhythmic brutality of 'Kandinsky,' Picture Studies captured a remarkable variety of moods.\\" Recording A recording of the Picture Studies featuring the Kansas City Symphony under the direction of Michael Stern was released through Reference Recordings on January 20, 2017.

Career  In 2005, as a freelance editorial illustrator for Boink Magazine, a sex positive magazine featuring photo spreads, creative writing, and education from male and female students of Boston University, Roustan pitched the idea to the editors to paint a model for one of the photo spreads. His first published partial body painting was a test painting on the founder of Boink Magazine, Alecia Oleyourryk. Roustan's first full body painting was published in the same issue featuring a photo series displayed in reverse giving the illusion that a female model, Anna, was undressing painted clothing. In actuality, the clothes were painted on step-by-step and they were photographed sequentially by photographer and Boink Co-Founder, Christopher Anderson. This photo series was mentioned in an on the Howard Stern Show interview with Alecia Oleyourryk. Stern initially could not tell that the model was painted. His work has gone viral multiple times including a woman camouflaged as a moth, a My Little Pony Transformer, and a series of female surfers painted in wetsuits. In 2015, Roustan published a large hardcover coffee table book featuring over 130 of his studio body paintings. The book was funded completely through Kickstarter and has received rave reviews on Amazon and a lot of viral publicity from various blogs.

Early life Barakat was born in 801 AH (1398/1399) in al- Khushshafah near Jeddah. He was raised in Mecca by his father, the Emir of Mecca Hasan ibn Ajlan. Co-Emir of Mecca On the request of Sharif Hasan ibn Ajlan, Sultan al-Nasir Faraj appointed Barakat as a co-Emir of Mecca in 809 AH (1407). In 811 AH the Sultan also appointed his brother Ahmad ibn Hasan as a co-Emir of Mecca and made their father Vice Sultan in the Hejaz. In 818 AH (1416) the three Sharifs were deposed by Sultan al-Mu'ayyad Shaykh. In 819 AH Barakat met with the Sultan on his father's behalf and secured the latter's reappointment as Emir of Mecca. He himself returned to Mecca as co-Emir in 820 AH (1417). In Rabi al-Awwal 821 AH (April/May 1418) Hasan ordered his men to pledge allegiance to Barakat, indicating his intention to transfer power to his son. In 824 AH (1421) Barakat was opposed by his brother Ibrahim ibn Hasan when the latter was not appointed co-Emir of Mecca by Sultan al-Muzaffar Ahmad. Ibrahim unilaterally ordered the muezzin to include his name alongside the names of his father and brother. This continued until Hasan ordered for Ibrahim's name to be removed in 826 AH (1423). In 827 AH (1424) Hasan and Barakat were deposed by Sultan al-Ashraf Barsbay, then reinstated in late 828 AH (1425). In Muharram 829 AH (November 1425) Hasan travelled to Egypt in response to summons from Barsbay and left Barakat in charge of Mecca. In Cairo, the Sultan received Hasan and confirmed him as Emir of Mecca, but only after he agreed to pay the sum of thirty thousand dinars. He was kept in Cairo until the first instalment of five thousand dinars was received. On the way back from Egypt Hasan fell ill; he returned to Cairo and died there on Thursday night, 17 Jumada al-Thani 829 AH (25 April 1426). Emir of Mecca After Sharif Hasan's death Barakat and Ibrahim responded to summons from Barsbay and left their brother Abu al-Qasim in charge of Mecca. In Cairo the Sultan appointed Barakat as Emir of Mecca and ordered Ibrahim to swear an oath of loyalty to his brother. Barakat's appointment was conditional on his agreement to pay the remaining balance of Hasan's debt, amounting to twenty five thousand dinars. The Sultan also demanded an annual tribute of ten thousand dinars and the customary share owed to him from the customs duties (mukus) of Jeddah. He further stipulated that Indian ships would no longer be subject to duties at the Sharif's port in Jeddah, and would instead pay their dues at the Mamluk port in Suez. Barakat and Ibrahim left Cairo on 11 Shawwal 829 AH (c. 16 August 1426) and reached Mecca around 11-15 Dhu al-Qi'dah (September 1426). During this time, Jalaluddin Muhammad Shah, the Sultan of Bengal, gifted Barakat with presents and robes of honour. With Barakat's permission, the Bengali Sultan constructed two Islamic institutions (known as Banjaliyah Madaris); the first in Makkah and the latter in Madinah which was built between 1428 and 1431.

He is best remembered for his celebrated quarrel with the future Duke of Bolton, which is recorded in the Diary of Samuel Pepys.Diary, 29 November 1666 He was the son of Robert Henley of Henley, Somerset, and his second wife Anne Eldred. His father was Chief Clerk in the King's Bench, in which office he amassed a fortune which enabled him to purchase lands in three counties, and his country seat at Bramshill House. As a Royalist he was forced to pay heavy fines after the English Civil War, but Andrew nonetheless came into a substantial inheritance on his father's death in 1656, which he largely wasted through his extravagance. Bramshill House, the Henley family home He was educated at Exeter College, Oxford. He entered the Inner Temple and was called to the Bar in 1646. He was a Member (MP) of the Parliament of England for Portsmouth in 1660. He seems to have played no part in the Commons debates in that crucial year, and was not returned to the Cavalier Parliament the following year.http://www.historyofparliamentonline.org/volume/1660-1690/member/henley- andrew-1622-75 He was notoriously extravagant, although in his defence it should be said that the fortune his father accumulated had been greatly decreased by the fines imposed on him as a Royalist. Despite his debts Andrew was able to buy the manor of Eversley, adjacent to Bramshill. He was accused by the local vicar of the sin of gluttony, although the only evidence of this seems to be that he employed a French chef. He appears to have been a hot- tempered man, and his temper led in November 1666 into a quarrel which might have had the most serious consequences. Samuel Pepys records in his Diary Diary of Samuel Pepys 29 November 1666 that at Westminster Hall Henley became engaged in a fracas with Lord St. John, later the 1st Duke of Bolton, while the Court of Common Pleas was in session, and struck him on the head with his cane. He was arrested, imprisoned and charged with contempt coram rege (i.e. he was in theory in the presence of the King himself). He was not pardoned until 1668, a year after St.John received his pardon. Pepys does not give any reason for the quarrel: St. John, who like Henley was quarrelsome and hot- tempered, and appears to have provoked the quarrel, later said that he had been \\"in a passion\\" at the time. Pepys, who had a poor opinion of St. John, thought it was a pity that Henley had retaliated, for if he had not the judges might have dealt with St. John as he deserved.Diary 29 November 1666 Lord St. John, later Duke of Bolton: his altercation with Henley in 1666 caused a considerable stir He married firstly Mary Gayer, daughter of Sir John Gayer, Lord Mayor of London and his wife Katherine Hopkins, and secondly Constance Bromfield, daughter of Thomas Bromfield, and widow of Thomas Middleton. By his first wife he had four children, including Robert, his heir, and Mary, who married as his third wife Sir Nicholas Slanning, 1st Baronet.

Shooting The suspect entered the library at 4:15 pm MST on Monday, August 28, 2017, and went into the restroom. He began shooting shortly after he came out of the restroom. At the time of the shooting, it was unclear how many people were in the library and Jouett seemed to fire randomly as individuals and parents with children tried to flee. According to an eyewitness, the gunman entered the library and shot into the carpet, shouting ‚ÄúRun! Why aren‚Äôt you running? I‚Äôm shooting at you! Run!‚Äù before he began to move about the room shooting at people. Another witness claimed that Jouett looked happy, that \\"He was just laughing, smiling the whole time, until he came up real close to me, and then he put on that mean look.\\" Police received multiple emergency calls. About 15 minutes after the first call came in, police received a call from the suspect's father, who told them that the suspect had taken his father's guns from the safe where they were kept, and left the house. The suspect surrendered immediately when police arrived; he did not struggle with the arresting officers. He told police that he had been planning an attack for a while, that he had intended to shoot up the school before killing himself.  Victims  Two people, Wanda Walters, 61, and Kristina Carter, 48, both library employees, were killed. Kristina Carter was the youth librarian and Wanda Walters worked at the circulation desk. Four people were wounded, who were identified as Howard Jones, 53, Jessica Thron, 30, Alexis Molina, 20, and Noah Molina, 10. Legal proceedings According to Public Radio station KUNM, although the Associated Press usually refrains from using the names of juvenile defendants, it has chosen to publish Nathaniel Jouett's name \\"because of the seriousness of the crime and because authorities are seeking adult sanctions.\\" Curry County District Attorney Andrea Reeb has announced that she intends to prosecute the suspect as an adult. The suspect made his first court appearance on August 31, 2017. The court determined that he would not be released yet and set a date of September 8, 2017 for his first appearance before a grand jury. The suspect was indicted on September 8, 2017 for two counts of first-degree murder, seven counts of child abuse, four counts of aggravated battery, and twenty counts of assault with intent to commit a violent felony. He will be tried as an adult. Preparation for the trial is expected to take months, perhaps as long as a year. In April 2018, a judge denied a defense request to transfer defendant from prison to a juvenile treatment facility, and ordered that he undergo a mental \\"evaluation and assessment\\" so that his mental health needs could be addressed. On October 17, 2018, Jouett pleaded guilty in the shooting. On February 15, 2019, Jouett was sentenced to two life sentences, with the possibility of parole, plus 40 years in prison. Jouett is currently incarcerated in the Lea County Correctional Center.https://search.cd.nm.gov/history_detail References 2017 in New Mexico 2017 mass shootings in the United States 2017 murders in the United States Attacks in the United States in 2017 August 2017 crimes in the United States Clovis, New Mexico Deaths by firearm in New Mexico Mass shootings in New Mexico Mass shootings in the United States Murder in New Mexico ","title":"Clovis library shooting"},{"id":"55067757","text":"Jennifer Lyn Marcroft (born 1963) is a New Zealand politician and former Member of Parliament in the House of Representatives for the New Zealand First party.

History Background In 1839 John Sutter, a Swiss immigrant of German origin, settled in Alta California and began building a fortified settlement on a land grant of 48,827 acres at the confluence of the Sacramento and American rivers. He had been given the land by the Mexican government, supposedly under the stipulation that it would help to keep Americans from occupying the territory. In order to build his fort and develop a large ranching/farming network in the area, Sutter relied on Indian labor. Observers accused him of using \\"kidnapping, food privation, and slavery\\" in order to force Indians to work for him, and generally stated that Sutter held the Indians under inhumane conditions. In 1846, the American James Clyman wrote that Sutter, \\"keeps 600 to 800 Indians in a complete state of Slavery.\\" Sutter was one of many ranchers who took part in revenge attacks against Indians in response to cattle-stealing (see Kern and Sutter massacres). Sutter was hospitable to foreign settlers looking to move into Alta California, especially Americans coming West. Soon the area was dotted with ranches, many of whom forced at least some Indians into slave labor in order to work their enormous holdings. Slavery became widespread in the region. Visitors to California described Indians as \\"legally reduced to servitude,\\" \\"the bond-men of the country,\\" \\"little better than serfs [who] performed all the drudgery and labour.\\" White American Lansford Warren Hastings wrote \\"the natives...in California...are in a state of absolute vassalage, even more degrading, and more oppressive than that of our slaves in the south.\\" Incident In March 1847, several Rancheria Tulea Indians escaped from slavery. According to a report Rancheria Tulea Indians made to government officials, the slavers attacked the Indians' home village in retaliation, killing five Indians and wounding \\"many more.\\" A separate account from US marine lieutenant G.W. Harrison, made on the same day as the Rancheria Tulea Indians' report, stated that White Americans had \\"stormed\\" an Indian village and attempted to take the Indians there into slavery, killing four Indians in the process while losing one of their own. These two reports may refer to the same attack. Repercussions Despite the multiple reports to authorities, there is no record of any punitive action being taken against the slavers. Aftermath Sutter eventually criticized the slave-stealing behavior of these other settlers, even though he had participated a level of it himself. A month after this incident, Sutter (now employed as a U.S. federal Indian agent) reported to his superiors that other slavers, \\"with little or no cause would shoot them, steal away their women and children, and even go so far as to attack whole villages, killing, without distinction of age or sex, hundreds of defenseless Indians.\\" The next month, more Indians would be killed in the Konkow Maidu slaver massacre. On April 22, 1850, the fledgling California state legislature passed the \\"Act for the Government and Protection of Indians,\\" legalizing the kidnapping and forced servitude of Indians by White settlers under certain conditions. In 1851, the civilian governor of California declared, \\"That a war of extermination will continue to be waged, until the Indian race becomes extinct, must be expected.\\" This expectation soon found its way into law. An 1851 legislative measure not only gave settlers the right to organize lynch mobs to kill Indians, but allowed them to submit their expenses to the government. By 1852 the state had authorized over a million dollars in such claims. In 1856, a San Francisco Bulletin editorial stated, \\"Extermination is the quickest and cheapest remedy, and effectually prevents all other difficulties when an outbreak [of Indian violence] occurs.\\" In 1860 the legislature passed a law expanding the age and condition of Indians available for forced slavery. A Sacramento Daily Union article of the time accused high-pressure lobbyists interested in profiting off enslaved Indians of pushing the law through, gave examples of how wealthy individuals had abused the law to acquire Indian slaves from the reservations, and stated, \\"The Act authorizes as complete a system of slavery, without any of the checks and wholesome restraints of slavery, as ever was devised.\\" On April 27, 1863, five months after Abraham Lincoln's Emancipation Proclamation, California outlawed the enslavement of Native Americans. However, slavery and forced labor continued under the name of \\"apprenticeship\\" and other euphemisms at least through 1874.

One enemy of Sutter falsely accused him of using \\"kidnapping, food privation, and slavery\\" in order to force Indians to work for him, and generally stated that Sutter held the Indians under inhumane conditions. In 1846, the American James Clyman wrote that Sutter, \\"keeps 600 to 800 Indians in a complete state of Slavery.\\" Sutter was one of many ranchers who took part in revenge attacks against Indians in response to cattle-stealing (see Kern and Sutter massacres). Sutter was hospitable to foreign settlers looking to move into Alta California, especially Americans coming West. Soon the area was dotted with ranches, many of whom forced at least some Indians into slave labor in order to work their enormous holdings. Slavery became widespread in the region. Visitors to California described Indians as \\"legally reduced to servitude,\\" \\"the bond-men of the country,\\" \\"little better than serfs [who] performed all the drudgery and labour.\\" White American Lansford Warren Hastings wrote \\"the natives...in California...are in a state of absolute vassalage, even more degrading, and more oppressive than that of our slaves in the south.\\" Sutter eventually criticized the slave-stealing behavior of these other settlers, even though he had participated a level of it himself. In 1847, Sutter (now employed as a U.S. federal Indian agent) reported to his superiors that other slavers, \\"with little or no cause would shoot them, steal away their women and children, and even go so far as to attack whole villages, killing, without distinction of age or sex, hundreds of defenseless Indians.\\" Incident In late June or early July, several Spanish-speaking men met with friendly Konkow Maidu Indians about sixty miles north of Sutter's Fort near present-day Chico. Despite being received hospitably by the Konkow Maidu, the White men \\"after having partaken of their hospitality, commenced making prisoners of men, women and children, and in securing them, [shot ten to thirteen who tried] to escape.\\" They then took into bondage at least thirty Indians, primarily women and children, killing on the way back those young children who were unable to continue. Repercussions J.A. Sutter reported that Antonio Armijo, Robert Smith, and John Eggar were the slavers who had massacred said Indians, and the men were then arrested by the U.S. Army. However, judges acquitted all three men at trial. Aftermath This is the last record of the U.S. military government even taking any slavers of American Indians to trial or making any effort to stop slaving. On April 22, 1850, the fledgling California state legislature passed the \\"Act for the Government and Protection of Indians,\\" legalizing the kidnapping and forced servitude of Indians by White settlers. In 1851, the civilian governor of California declared, \\"That a war of extermination will continue to be waged‚Ä¶until the Indian race becomes extinct, must be expected.\\" This expectation soon found its way into law. An 1851 legislative measure not only gave settlers the right to organize lynch mobs to kill Indians, but allowed them to submit their expenses to the government. By 1852 the state had authorized over a million dollars in such claims. In 1856, a San Francisco Bulletin editorial stated, \\"Extermination is the quickest and cheapest remedy, and effectually prevents all other difficulties when an outbreak [of Indian violence] occurs.\\" In 1860 the legislature passed a law expanding the age and condition of Indians available for forced slavery. A Sacramento Daily Union article of the time accused high-pressure lobbyists interested in profiting off enslaved Indians of pushing the law through, gave examples of how wealthy individuals had abused the law to acquire Indian slaves from the reservations, and stated, \\"The Act authorizes as complete a system of slavery, without any of the checks and wholesome restraints of slavery, as ever was devised.\\" On April 27, 1863, five months after Abraham Lincoln's Emancipation Proclamation, California outlawed the enslavement of Native Americans. However, slavery and forced labor continued under the name of \\"apprenticeship\\" and other euphemisms at least through 1874.

Kokotajlo was nominated at the 2019 BAFTAs for the Outstanding Debut by a British Writer, Director or Producer. Two sisters are brought up in a tight knit group of Jehovah's Witnesses in Oldham. The film explores guilt, love and personal battles with the truth. Plot Devout Jehovah‚Äôs Witness, Ivanna Whitling, lives with her two grown-up daughters, Alex and Luisa, in Oldham, England. Alex and Luisa are also members of the faith. Alex, who works as a gardener, has just turned eighteen and her older sister attends college. Alex suffers from anaemia, a complicated issue for someone whose faith forbids her accepting a life-saving blood transfusion should that be necessary. Luisa and Alex regularly go door-knocking amongst the local Urdu-speaking population to spread their faith. Luisa reveals to her mother and sister that she has fallen pregnant to a man at college, something considered taboo in the Jehovah‚Äôs Witness community and which forces her to be shunned by the community, including her mother and sister, until she shows the elders that she repents and recommits herself to ‚ÄúThe Truth‚Äù. Luisa moves out of home and Ivanna is told that any contact with Luisa must only be that which is absolutely necessary. At a service, a newly arrived elder named Steven introduces himself to Ivanna and Alex and quickly makes it clear that he is interested in pursuing a relationship with Alex with the prospect of marriage, to which Alex is agreeable. Tragedy soon strikes however, when Alex collapses and dies. It is evident that she, or her mother, made a decision not to receive a blood transfusion to save her life. Luisa, now heavily pregnant, attends Alex‚Äôs funeral but is ignored by the others present. She talks to her mother in the cloak room after the funeral; they hug and Luisa cries loudly in grief. Luisa is now living alone. Ivanna continues to support her by visiting her with food and helping her clean her flat. She encourages Luisa to continue speaking to the elders in order to be accepted back into the Witness community, but after several meetings Luisa leaves in a fit of anger, telling her mother she finds the elders too demanding and controlling. Soon after this, Ivanna visits Luisa at her flat to find that she has given birth to a healthy girl named Leanne. Ivanna delights in holding her granddaughter, telling Luisa that she loves both her and her granddaughter very much. Ivanna and Luisa argue about the teachings of their church, Ivanna making it clear that she wants Leanne to learn about God. When Luisa goes into the kitchen to get her mother a glass of water, Ivanna grabs Leanne out of her bassinet and takes her out to the car. As she is placing her on the back seat, Luisa runs out to the car and grabs Leanne. Ivanna mutters that she will ‚Äúsave‚Äù her granddaughter.

The main causes for disability in Sri Lanka are poor hygiene, lack of medical care, the prevalence of 30 years of war, the aftereffects of the 2004 tsunami, and an increase in accidents. About 1.6 million Sri Lankans, 8% of the population, were regarded as disabled in 2012. Sri Lanka has been a signatory of the United Nations Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities since 2007.http://www.kdu.ac.lk/proceedings/irc2015/2015/law-029.pdf The definition of disability in Sri Lanka is: \\"Any person who as a result of any deficiency in his physical or mental capabilities whether congenital or not is unable by himself to ensure for himself, wholly or partly the necessities of life\\".  Demographics  See:Demographics of Sri Lanka In Sri Lanka about 8.7% of the total population above the age of 5 live with some form of disability, and it is estimated that about 300,000 people in the 18-60 age group have some form of disability. About 57% of disabled people are male, and 43% are female, as of 2012.  Politics   Legislation  Chapter III, article 12, paragraph 4 of the Constitution of Sri Lanka permits legislation and executive action that creates advantages for disabled persons. According to the Manthri.lk parliamentary monitoring website, disability rights legislation and policies are generally not properly implemented. Sri Lanka ratified by the CRPD on 8 February 2016. The following acts are taken in consideration related to disability in Sri Lanka. They are: 1\\\\. 1996, Protection of the Rights of Persons with Disabilities * Implementation of Act no 28 for promotion, advancement and protection of rights of persons with disabilities * This act is one of the key pieces of legislation related to disability. The act provides secure protection for people with disabilities against discrimination with regarding employment, education and access to the built environment. This also gives a legal framework for activities of the National Council for Persons who have disabilities. 2\\\\. Ranaviru Seva Act * This was enacted by the Parliament of Sri Lanka by which Ranaviru Seva Authority was set up to provide for the after care and rehabilitation of members of armed forces and police who are disabled 3\\\\. Visually Handicapped Trust Fund Act * This act is involved with providing educational and vocational training opportunities for poverty reduction, provide financial assistance and guidance for self- employment of the visually impaired people.  Advocacy  Some organisations have voluntarily come forward to help the disabled people in Sri Lanka. They include: * Brighter Life Foundation is a Swiss group founded in 2004, aiming to assist disability charities in Sri Lanka. * Sri Lanka Council for Mental Health was established for disabled people who have mental illness. It serves as skills training centre and a shelter workplace. * Sri Lanka Foundation for Rehabilitation of the Disabled manages \\"Rehab Lanka\\", a workshop giving employment to people with disabilities and earning some income for the organization. * The Rehabilitation Center for the Communication Impaired, an organization that works with children and adults to provide them with a school experience and vocational training.  Employment  Generally in Sri Lanka, most disabled people are unemployed as they face discrimination and limitations to access safe working environments. Self-employment is the only option available to disabled people instead of expecting an open safe working environment.  Education  In Sri Lanka, about 96% of the total disabled population with functional difficulties didn't engage in educational activities. Only about 54,311 disabled students attend school.  Sport  Sri Lanka made its Paralympics debut in 1996 Paralympics Games in Atlanta. Since then, the Sri Lankan Paralympic team has participated in every edition of the Paralympics Games. So far, Sri Lanka has won two medals in the Paralympic Games. Pradeep Sanjaya and Dinesh Priyantha are the only Sri Lankan Paralympians to win Paralympic medals for Sri Lanka. Both of these athletes are army personnel.

After the outbreak of World War I, Orontes initially remained in service on the Britain to Australia route, however in October 1916, she was requisitioned by the Royal Navy and converted to a troopship, under the name HMAT (His Majesty's Australian Transports) Orontes. She made two further voyages from Britain to Australia, before spending some time on the Africa run. In 1917, she was relinquished by the admiralty, as her refrigerated hold made her more useful for transporting dairy products and meat from Australia to Britain. In 1919, Orontes resumed her Australia service with calls at Gibraltar, Toulon, Port Said, Colombo, Fremantle, Adelaide, Melbourne, Sydney and an extension to Brisbane. In 1921, she was laid up in the Thames, and in 1922 she was sold with the intent of converting her to an exhibition vessel, the British Trade. She was re-acquired by the Orient Line in 1923, and reverted to Orontes until she was scrapped in 1925. A new was launched by the Orient Line in 1929.

Her commitment to promoting culture lends special relevance to the family activities that accompany the artwork on display. The center is housed in the Palau de l'Abat (The Abbot's Palace), a former Benedictine monastery.  History  In 2003 an agreement was signed between the mayor of Sant Feliu de Gu√≠xols, the Minister of Culture of the Generalitat de Catalunya and baroness Carmen Cervera giving 350 works from the Thyssen collection of Catalan painting between 1850 and 1950 to the Carmen Thyssen Space, including works by painters such as Ramon Casas, Isidre Nonell and Santiago Rusinyol. Some of these works are currently exhibited at the National Art Museum of Catalonia and the other part comes from the Carmen Cervera private collection. Firstly, the city council had to give away an old 17th century hospital, but it was finally decided that the location of the collection would be the Serra Vicens factory. Due to the situation of economic crisis, the creation of this center was delayed. In 2012, finally, the center, called Espai Carmen Thyssen, was inaugurated at The Sant Feliu de Gu√≠xols History Museum, occupying part of the baroque abbey palace of the monastery. Currently, the project contemplates the extension, both of activities and of spaces, in the near future with the objective to complement its counterparts in Madrid with the Thyssen-Bornemisza Museum and in M√°laga and Andorra with the Carmen Thyssen Museum. In this sense, the main intention is to extend the temporary exhibition up to eight months and to expand the Carmen Thyssen Space, which implies an important intervention in the monastery building.  Exhibition  Since the first exhibition, the Carmen Thyssen Space has become one of the most important artistic centers of the Costa Brava.

It is used as a human atopic dermatitis model for its biological properties. If kept under so called conventional conditions these mice develop skin lesions clinically and histologically very similar to human atopic dermatitis. The hair of these mice is rougher ‚Äì especially on the head and dorsal skin. Erythema, haemorrhage, excoriation, erosion, scaling and dryness are observed almost everywhere on the body ‚Äì mainly on the face and ears. These symptoms do not develop if these mice are kept under specific pathogen free (SPF) conditions. This supports the theory that atopic dermatitis development is influenced by both genetic predisposition and environment. The production of serum IgE is several times higher in mice kept under conventional condition than in those from SPF conditions. High level of serum IgE is typical for human dermatitis too. The lesional skin shows hyperkeratosis in the epidermis. Another trade mark is heavy cell infiltrate in the dermis. This infiltrate consists mainly of CD4 positive T lymphocytes with less CD8 positive lymphocytes and macrophages. Infiltration of these cells leads to higher activation of mast cells. Higher production of certain chemokines, cytokines and respective receptors is also typical. Notably production of TARC (thymus- and activation-regulated chemokine) is significantly higher. This chemokine plays an important role in lesion pathogenesis. Cells infiltrating dermis produce cytokines typical for Th2 polarization especially IL-4 and IL-5. Considering receptors, CCR3 and CCR5 are expressed in both lesional and nonlesional skin but CCR5 is higher in lesional skin. CCR4 is receptor typically expressed in lesional skin only. CCR4 is a receptor for TARC. These differences in chemokines and cytokines production are observed only in Nc/Nga mice kept under conventional conditions. Genetic determinant responsible for atopic dermatitis-like skin lesions is located on chromosome 9. This quantitative trait loci (QTL) was named derm1 and is surrounded by seven genes possibly involved in atopic dermatitis onset and pathogenesis. These seven candidate genes are:  thymus cell antigen 1 theta (Thy1)  CD3 antigen delta, epsilon and gamma polypeptide (Cd3d,e,g)  interleukin-10 receptor alpha (Il10ra)  interleukin-18  C-terminal Src kinase (Csk).br> All these genes or their products more precisely are involved in T lymphocytes development. Derm1 region is conserved on human chromosome 11q22.2-23.3 and 15q21-25. Nevertheless no gene directly involved in atopic dermatitis development was located into this locus in human.

The citadel incorporates three separate developments, the tower of Santo Ant√≥nio de Cascais, the Fortress of Our Lady of Light (Nossa Senhora da Luz de Cascais), and the former Royal Palace area. History The first construction of a fort on the site was between 1410 and 1415. Improvements to this were deemed necessary as the Cascais Bay was constantly threatened by the English. In 1488 a medieval-style tower at the tip of the Point of Salmodo, to the southwest of the Bay, was begun under the orders of King John II of Portugal. The fort, known as the Torre de Santo Ant√≥nio de Cascais, was designed to share, with artillery ships and two other fortresses, resistance to possible military attack on Lisbon. The other forts were the Bel√©m Tower and the Fort of S√£o Sebasti√£o de Caparica, which are approximately opposite each other on the River Tagus closer to Lisbon. Construction of the fort of Nossa Senhora da Luz de Cascais was ordered by Philip I to provide further reinforcements. It began in 1594, designed by an Italian, Captain Fratino, following an unusual triangular design that took advantage of the existing Torre de Santo Ant√≥nio de Cascais, which is incorporated as one of three bastions built into the Citadel. The fortress had an interior courtyard that allowed communication between the three bastions and access to the batteries, barracks and cisterns. Reinforcement and enlargement of the Citadel was subsequently carried out around 1648, under the control of King John IV. The structure underwent further modifications and repairs until 1755, when it suffered considerable damage as a result of the Lisbon earthquake. View of the Citadel from the Marina Present day In the nineteenth century, King Lu√≠s I of Portugal ordered the adaptation of the citadel to become a place of rest and retreat for the royal family and nobility and the royal palace area (now a museum) was constructed. Until the regicide of King Carlos I in 1908, the royal family spent the months of September and October in Cascais. This led to the growth of Cascais as an important location for affluent people from Lisbon to spend the summer. In 1878 the complex was equipped with the first electric lights in Portugal. Through a Decree in 1977, the complex was classified as Property of Public Interest. Since then it has been restored and incorporated into the modern design of the surrounding areas, providing an impressive backdrop for the new Cascais Marina. A hotel has been built into the Citadel buildings, which also now house an Arts Centre (Cidadela Arts District).

Art awards  In 2000, Beowulf was a finalist in the Archibald Prize with a portrait of painter Ken Done. In 2001, she was selected for the Archibald Prize's Salon des Refus√©s for her portrait of the National Gallery's Brian Kennedy. In 2002, she was a finalist in the Doug Moran National Portrait Prize for her portrait of Nancy Wake, later acquired by the National Portrait Gallery. Beowulf chose Wake as a subject to help ensure she got more recognition for her service within Australia. In 2010, she was a finalist in the Portia Geach Memorial Award with a portrait of comedian Adam Spencer. She was also highly commended for that award in 1998, 2000, 2001 and 2003.

Thor passed away from pancreatic cancer on 7 August 2015. On 12 October that same year, Beowulf's mother-in-law, 81-year-old Katherine Helene Panin, was found dead at the base of some stairs at their shared home in Red Hill. In August 2017, Beowulf and her son Bjorn, faced the ACT Magistrates Court, formally charged with the October 2015 murder of Panin. Both plead not guilty and were remanded in custody. One of Beowulf's other sons, Thorsten, later appeared in the ACT Magistrates Court, and similarly plead not guilty, and was remanded in custody. Their assets may have been frozen, which could have impeded their bail applications. In September 2017, the National Portrait Gallery stated that Beowulf's portrait of Nancy Wake would not be removed from display, and that nothing would be done while the matter was before the courts. In early December 2017, the prosecution requested more time for the case, in order to gather financial documents. Beowulf's lawyer, Rachel Bird, noted in her objection that the 15-month investigation had already included a search of the family home for the same information. The trio reappeared at the family violence court on 19 December 2017, and Magistrate Bernadette Boss committed them to stand trial in the ACT Supreme Court on 1 February 2018. For that day, Bjorn, Melissa and Thorsten's cases were included in the court's list. On 31 October 2018, Beowulf and her sons Bjorn and Thorsten were released on bail in the ACT Supreme Court. Their trial began in the ACT Supreme Court on 19 February 2019. A jury returned the verdict of not guilty for the trio on 12 April 2019.

Early life Morgan was born at Allt-goch in Cwrtnewydd, in the parish of Llanwenog, Cardiganshire in 1673. The son of Morgan Rhydderch, deacon at Rhydwilym, Morgan moved to Abergavenny at an early age to become a member of Llanwenarth's Baptist church. His career as a preacher began in 1692 and he was ordained in Blaenau Gwent in 1700, having received a call to preach in the region, c. 1696. Emigration to the Americas Morgan decided to emigrate to the New World in September 1711, though he did not arrive in North America until February the following year. Abel Morgan landed in the Province of Pennsylvania and held the pastorate of the Pennepack Baptist Church from his arrival, an historic Baptist church in Philadelphia that is one of the oldest Baptist congregations in North America. His brother, Enoch Morgan (1676-1740), was already minister for the congregation of the Welsh Tract Baptist Church in Newcastle County, Delaware, which sprung from the Pennepack Baptist Church over a disagreement concerning the practice of the 'laying on of the hands.' Later life and death In 1716, Morgan translated a formal confession of faith that had been signed by the Welsh Tract Church's congregants concerning official Baptist doctrine and practices. Morgan was pastor of the Pennepack Baptist Church until his death on 16 December 1722, and his translations of the Biblical concordance were published in Philadelphia in 1730, eight years after his death. He was originally buried at the back of Pennepack Baptist Church in Lagrange Place. His remains were later moved to Mount Moriah Cemetery, Philadelphia. Personal life and family Morgan was married three times during his life. His first wife, Priscilla Powell, and their son died during his initial voyage to North America, though their daughter survived. He later remarried Martha Burrows, and after her death married Judith Gooding n√©e Griffiths, the widowed daughter of Thomas Griffiths (1645‚Äì1725), who had served as the first pastor for the Welsh Tract Baptist Church for twenty-five years. Morgan fathered three sons and one daughter from Gooding. One of his sons, also named Abel Morgan, became a prominent preacher during the First Great Awakening and the American War of Independence.

The shrine is one of the most important in Pakistan, and was among the first Islamic holy sites in South Asia ‚Äì providing the region's Muslims a local focus for devotion. The shrine is also revered by Sikhs, who include Baba Farid's poetry into the Guru Granth Sahib - regarded by Sikhs to be the eternal Guru. The shrine played a central role in the conversion of local tribes to Islam over the course of several centuries. Chiefs of the highly revered shrine once controlled a politically autonomous state that was defended by soldiers drawn from local clans that pledged loyalty to the shrine and descendants of Baba Farid. Today the shrine is considered to be the most significant in Punjab, and attracts up to two million visitors to its annual urs festival. Location The shrine is located in the town of Pakpattan, in the Pakistani province of Punjab, near the right bank of the Sutlej River. Background Turkic settlers had arrived in the region around Pakpattan in the 13th century a result of pressures from the expanding Mongol Empire, and so the city already had a Muslim community with its own mosque by the time of Baba Farid's arrival. Baba Farid established a Jama Khana, or convent, in what was then known as Ajodhan that attracted large masses of devotees who would gather at the convent daily in hopes of securing ta'widh, or written blessings and amulets. Devotees would in turn offer a futuh, or gift to the shrine in return. By the 13th century, the belief that the spiritual powers of great Sufi saints were attached to their burial sites was widespread in the Muslim world, and so a shrine was built to commemorate the burial site of Baba Farid after he died in 1265. In keeping with Sufi tradition in Punjab, the shrine maintains influence over smaller shrines throughout the region around Pakpattan that are dedicated to specific events in Baba Farid's life. The secondary shrines form a wilayat, or a \\"spiritual territory\\" of the shrine, with Pakpattan serving as the capital of Baba Farid's spiritual territory, or wilayat. The shrine and its wilayat also bound local tribes together with a collective identity based on reverence for the shrine. History Establishment By the time of Baba Farid's death, the belief that the spiritual powers saints were attached to their burial sites was widespread in the Muslim world, and so following the death of Baba Farid in 1265, a shrine was built at the place of his burial near his convent. The shrine complex eventually grew to encompass not only the tomb itself, but also a mosque, a langar, and several other related buildings. Baba Farid's tomb serves as the epicentre of the activity at the shrine complex. In 1281, Sheik Ala ad-Din Mauj Darya was appointed as spiritual successor of Baba Farid. Under his authority, the shrine's popularity grew spectacularly, and the countryside around the shrine began to revere the shrine. In 1315, the Sufi mystic Amir Khusrow noted in detail that the 50th anniversary of Baba Farid's death was celebrated by an urs festival which attracted devotees who heard recitations of the saints deeds, and were treated to entertainment by an ensemble of dervishes. Various secondary shrines devoted to Baba Farid also began to be established around the 14th century that extended the shrine's spiritual territory, or wilayat, though the shrines were built by commoners, rather than royal patrons. The network of shrines defined tracts in Punjab as being areas belonging to the spiritual kingdom of Baba Farid, where spiritual powers of the saint could protect travelers. It was noted that beyond borders of Baba Farid's wilayat lay the wilayat belonging to the Shrine of Bahauddin Zakariya in Multan. Tughluq Sultanate The shrine complex also includes shrines dedicated to the early diwans of the shrine. The shrine's reputation continued to grow and had spread beyond the border of medieval Islamic India. The shrine was visited by the Arab explorer Ibn Battuta in 1334, who recounted that the Egyptian Shaikh Burhan-ud-dun al-Araj foretold in Alexandria that Ibn Battuta would meet Baba Farid's descendants. Tamerlane seized Pakpattan in 1398, and prayed at the shrine for increased strength. He spared the town's inhabitants out of respect for the shrine. During the era of the Tughluq dynasty between 1321 and 1398, the shrine received official patronage from the royal court in Delhi after the founder of the dynasty, Ghiyath al-Din Tughluq, became attracted to the \\"spiritual power\\" of Mauj Darya. Ghiyath al-Din Tughluq was noted to have made frequent visits to the shrine when he was Governor of Punjab and ruled from nearby Dipalpur. The 14th century chronicler Shams-i Siraj 'Afif noted that the Governor, and future Sultan, brought his son and nephew, the future Sultans Muhammad bin Tughluq, and Firuz Shah Tughlaq to the shrine, where they participated in the turban-tying ceremony known as dastar bandi, which conferred symbolic authority in a way similar to a coronation ceremony. Tradition maintains that Muhammad bin Tughluq was a disciple of the shrine's second diwan, Mauj Darya, who had performed the dastar bandi ceremony for Muhammad bin Tughluq. Muhammad wished to construct a fine shrine for his spiritual master Mauj Darya, but the master refused to permit construction until he died. Following Sheik Ala ad-Din's death in 1335, Muhammad bin Tughluq ordered construction of a shrine for him that eventually became one of the finest works of Tughluq architecture, which dwarfed even the tomb of Baba Farid. Firuz Tughluq undertook repairs at the shrine of Baba Farid in the 14th century, and began to grant robes to honour descendants of Baba Farid. Eventually, subsequent diwans of the shrine became closely associated with the Tughluq court in Delhi, and the shrine began to increasingly rely upon royal patronage. Tamerlane visited the shrine in 1398 during his invasion of northern India. Mughal The founder of Sikhism, Guru Nanak, visited the shrine in the early 1500s to collect compositions of Baba Farid's poetry from Sheikh Ibrahim, the 12th generation descendant of Baba Farid. Mughal Emperor Akbar in 1571 paid his respects at the shrine and implored Baba Farid. Shah Jahan in 1629 issued a royal decree declaring that revenues from the region around Pakpattan would be used for the shrine's upkeep, and that khadims, or \\"servants,\\" of the shrine would also receive royal support. Chisti State After the fall of the Mughal Empire, descendants of Baba Farid known as Chisti, the shrine's caretakers, and other disciples of the shrine formed an autonomous state centred on the shrine. Local tribes would pledge allegiance to the shrine and its caretakers, and were reportedly able to raise an army of 10,000 men to defend the shrine and Chisti. In 1757, the shrine's army attacked the Raja of Bikaner, and expanded the territory of shrine-state. The army of devotees was able defend the Chisti Emirate against Sikh attacks in 1776. The shrines cavalries were able to pursue retreating Sikh soldiers, killing several thousand more. The shrine and its independent state were conquered by the Sikhs in 1810. Sikh Baba Farid's poetry came to be revered within Sikhism, and was incorporated into the Sikh holy book, the Guru Granth Sahib - the shrine thus assumed importance as a place of Sikh devotion in addition to its function as a Muslim shrine. Maharaja Ranjit Singh of the Sikh Empire captured the shrine in 1810. He later visited the shrine, and pledged an annual sum of 9,000 rupees towards its upkeep. The shrine began to be a centre of contention between the Sikh and Muslim community as a result of joint devotion to the shrine. British British colonial rule over the shrine commenced following the defeat of the Sikh Empire in 1849. The British colonial regime maintained ties with shrine, and sought to employ it towards the goal of \\"indirect rule\\" over the region through political and social systems that predated their arrival. Modern era Following the Partition of British India in 1947, the shrine no longer served as a source of intercommunal conflict, and instead began to be identified exclusively as a Muslim shrine. The shrine assumed even greater importance within Pakistan, as Pakistani pilgrims often find it difficult to visit Chisti shrines in Delhi and Ajmer on account of poor relations between Pakistan and India. As a result, Baba Farid's shrine has emerged as the \\"unrivaled centre\\" of Chisti Sufism in Pakistan. Though Sikhs and Hindus in India are now largely cut-off from the shrine, commemorations of his annual urs are held in Amritsar. In April 2001, 36 devotees were crushed at a stampede at the shrine as pilgrims rushed towards the Behishti Darwaza at the opening of the anuual urs festival. Following the September 11 attacks, caretakers of the shrine denounced extremist and exclusivist interpretations of Islam. On 25 October 2010, a bomb exploded outside the gates of the shrine, killing six people. In recent years, the founder and chairman of the Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf, former cricketer Imran Khan, has regularly visited the shrine at night. Layout The shrine complex includes a large mosque. The shrine complex includes not only the tomb of Baba Farid, but also those of his hereditary successors. The complex also includes the site of the city's old mosque which predated Baba Farid's arrival to the city. The small tomb of Baba Farid is made of white marble with two doors - one facing east named the N≈´rƒ´ DarwƒÅza or 'Gate of Light', and another facing south named the Bahishtƒ´ DarwƒÅza, or 'Gate of Paradise'. A long covered corridor surrounds much of the building. Inside the mausoleum are two white marbled graves - one belonging to Baba Farid, and the other to his eldest son. The space inside the tomb space is limited; not more than ten people can be inside at one time. The building is not segregated by gender, but an area exists that is exclusively for use of women. Significance Sufism The shrine's Bab-e-Jannat portal into the shrine's innermost sanctum represents a symbolic gateway to paradise. The Chishti Order of Sufism was the first great Sufi order to take root in the capital of medieval Islamic India, Delhi. The shrine, along with the Chisti Ajmer Sharif Dargah and Nizamuddin Dargah, were the first to be established within Islamic India. The trio of shrines allowed local Muslims for the first time to access to Islamic holy sites without having to journey to the Middle East. Built in the town that was known in medieval times as Ajodhan, the old town's importance was eclipsed by that of the shrine, as evidenced by its renaming to \\"Pakpattan,\\" meaning \\"Pure Ferry\\" - referencing a river crossing made by pilgrims to the shrine. The shrine was central to a process which resulted in the conversion of local Jat tribes to Islam over the course of several centuries. Sikhism Baba Farid's poetry was incorporated into the Sikh holy book, the Guru Granth Sahib - and so the shrine assumed importance as a place of Sikh devotion in addition to its function as a Muslim shrine. Maharaja Ranjit Singh of the Sikh Empire captured the shrine in 1810. He later visited the shrine, and pledged an annual sum of 9,000 Rupees towards its upkeep. The shrine began to be a centre of contention between the Sikh and Muslim community as a result of joint devotion to the shrine. Political The shrine has since been a key factor shaping Pakpattan's politics. Patronage from the Tughluq royal court began during the life of the second diwan Mauj Darya, and subsequent diwans became increasingly associated with the Tughluq court - the third diwan of the shrine, Mu'izz ad-Din was even placed in government service in Gujarat by Muhammad Tughluq, while his brother was deemed \\"Shaikh ul-Islam\\" of India. Shah Jahan in 1692 issued a farman, or royal decree, that descendants of Baba Farid known as be extended support from the Mughal court. The number of descendants was so large, that they formed a new class of landowners in the region around Pakpattan who were privileged relative to the agricultural clans that were found in the area. The new class of landowning descendants of Baba Farid became known as the Chisti, who were patronized by rulers in Delhi in order to extend Delhi's sovereignty over Punjab. The shrine's hereditary caretakers, or diwan, eventually began to assert themselves as political administrators by operating a network of forts and devotee-soldiers. The religious duties of the diwan became increasingly fulfilled by a network of preachers and \\"subordinate religious specialists,\\" while the diwan focused efforts at administration of the Pakpattan city-state. British colonialists in the late 19th century noted that the Chisti were influential, but relied entirely on tenant farmers from local agricultural clans. Chistis are reported to have owned 9% of all land in Montgomery District in the late 19th century. Local agricultural clans remained loyal to the Chisti descendants of the shrine, and swore spiritual allegiance to the Chisti descendants of Baba Farid, rather than to Baba Farid himself. Clans would offer brides to the Chisti clan in a mark of allegiance to the Chisti. Over time, the clans became to closely associated themselves with both the shrine, and Diwan. =Autonomous state= The oath of allegiance also included a pledge to militarily defend the shrine and the Chisti. The Khokars, Bhattis, Dhudhis, and Hans clans at were reportedly able to raise an army of 10,000 men to defend the shrine and Chisti if needed. In 1757, the shrine's diwan Abd as-Subhan raised an army from the clans in order to attack the Raja of Bikaner, and was able to extend the shrines territory to the opposite bank of the Sutlej River. The army of devotees was able to repel a Sikh attack against Pakpattan in 1776, resulting in the death of Heera Singh Sandhu, founder of the Sikh Nakai Misl state. The shrines cavalries were able to pursue retreating Sikh soldiers, killing several thousand more. Practices Charity Gifts and donations to the shrine are redistributed to other devotees, in a practice that follows Baba Farid's example. Baba Farid's shrine subsequently became a centre of wealth redistribution throughout the western Punjab. The shrine maintains a langar, or canteen, which serves free meals to the poor. Adab traditions A system of elaborate rituals developed around the shrine that integrated local clans into the social and religious structure of the shrine. A 1623 collection of biographies regarding Baba Farid's life, the Jawahir al-Faridi, noted that the shrine's major rituals had in fact been established during Badr ad-Din's position of diwan that was inherited immediately following Baba Farid's death. Such traditions included the tying of a turban (dastar bandi) to signify inheritance of Baba Farid's spiritual authority, the regularization of qawwali music, establishment of the shrine's free kitchen, and opening of the tomb's southern door to allow visitors to the urs festival to directly pass the shrine's most sacred area. Devotees would also pass through the shrine's Beheshti Darwaza in order to symbolically enter paradise. Pilgrims regarded the ferry journey across the Sutlej River towards the shrine as a metaphorical journey of salvation in a boat piloted by the saint, in a ritual that may echo the Hindu concept of tirtha, or crossing of a river ford from the mundane into the spiritual world. A system of social hierarchy developed as a result of the shrine's Adab. The diwan and his family were considered the most important, followed by the shrine's khalifas, members of the Chisti class, chiefs of local agricultural clans. Shrine guardianship By the 13th century, a widespread belief had taken root in Muslim societies that a Sufi saint's spiritual powers could be inherited by his descendants. Upon the death of Baba Farid, his son Badr ad-Din Sulaiman was deemed to be Baba Farid's prime successor, setting a pattern of hereditary acquisition of the position. The successorship of Badr ad-Din's son, Shaikh Ala ad-Din Mauj Darya, in 1281 further cemented this tradition. The chief caretaker and spiritual authority of most shrines is typically referred to as a sajjada nashin, though at Baba Farid's shrine, the title for the position in taken from the royal courts of medieval Islamic India, and is instead referred to as diwan. The diwan is traditionally believed to inherit the baraka, or spiritual power, of Baba Farid. The diwan of the Pakpattan shrine historically has not maintained spiritual authority in the region by himself - rather, the shrine's authority was also spread among a baradari, or network of Baba Farid's descendants that lived in the regions surrounding the shrine, who in turn were sometimes themselves sajjada nashins of small shrine dedicated to pious descendants of Baba Farid. Members of the baradari were often owned large tracts of land granted to them by various rulers, or were local village officials. By the 19th and 20th centuries, the network of sajjada nashins in the Baba Farid wilayat maintained a network of authority that paralleled the region's official administrative system. The success of each diwan or sajjada nashin was tied to his ability to attract official patronage and increase donations, in order to further promote the shrine's prestige, and to distribute among subsidiary shrines located in the region surrounding Pakpattan. Resources directed towards subsidiary shrines were used to maintain social services, such as the langar which served free meals to the poor. Hospitality provided at the langar further heightened the status of a Sajjada nashin. Diwan succession Appointment of a successor for the hereditary title required \\"revelation\\" from Baba Farid's spirit to determine the inheritor of his baraka, or blessed direct access to God. Selection of the inheritor was supported by consent from Baba Farid's committed devotees, and members of the baradari network of shrines. =Conflicts over succession= Conflict over succession sometimes occurred - in the 1880s during British colonial rule, those in dispute appealed to the British court system to determine which claimant had inherited revelation from Baba Farid, though the court based its decision on deference to historic customs in determining the successor. During the 1880s and 1890s, the shrine's diwan switched three times in the course of deliberations - though attendance at the shrine did not decline, and it did not appear that devotees particularly cared which person served in the role. The eventual successful petitioner, Sayid Muhammad was not considered a learned religious scholar. Erosion of the diwan's spiritual role resulted in criticism of the entire shrine system by Muslim reformist movements in the 20th century. At the time of Sayid Muhammad's death in 1934, another crisis over inheritance erupted as some members of the shrine's baradari bodies disputed the succession of a minor, Ghulam Qutb ad-Din, to the role which they argued was inappropriate to be filled by a young man. British Courts accepted Ghulam Qutb ad-Din as the next successor, and established a caretaker system for the shrine until he reached maturity, and arranged for his training and education at Lahore's prestigious Aitchison College - a plan which was met with resistance by members of the baradari who feared that an education there would signal the diwan's integration into the British values system, rather than that of Islam. British attempts at resolution were seen as interference in the shrine's religious affairs, and eroded the legitimacy of the shrine's diwan system. Administration The shrine is administered by the Auqaf Department.Omer Tarin, 'Hazrat Baba Farid Ganj Shakar and the evolution of the literary Punjabi:A Brief Review' in Journal of Humanities and Liberal Arts, 1995, pp.21-30 The shrine is open 24 hours a day for visitors, every day of the year.

The term \\"Reichsexekution\\" is also used in Germany depending on the respective state name.  German Confederation  The German Confederation (1815-1866) was obliged to proceed against the government of a member state by means of a Bundesexekution, insofar as this was contrary to the provisions of the German Confederation Constitution or other Federal decrees. The foundations of the Confederation were Article 31 of the Vienna Final Act and the Execution Order of 1820. In order to force a state to comply with its obligations, the following measures were envisaged: * Military occupation of a state * Assumption of the governmental power to depose a ruling prince and * Abolition of constitutional provisions which violate federal law A Federal Commissioner was appointed who was responsible for implementing these measures. Federal executions in the German Confederation: * In 1830 against Brunswick because its Duke Charles II refused to recognise the constitution adopted under his guardian, the British King George IV. * In 1834 against Frankfurt in the wake of the Frankfurter Wachensturm (English: Change of the Frankfurt guard house). * The federal execution against the Duchies of Holstein and Lauenburg from 1863 because of its inclusion of Schleswig into the Danish constitution, from which the Second Schleswig War resulted. * In 1866 against Prussia on the occasion of the dispute over the administration of Schleswig-Holstein. The following Austro-Prussian War for supremacy of the German Confederation led to the dissolution of the Confederation. The federal execution was to be distinguished from federal intervention which was not directed against the government of a member state, but against anti-German movements and served to secure the monarchical legitimists and public peace. It was also necessary to distinguish the Bundeskrieg (Federal War) in order to ward off attacks by foreign powers.  Switzerland  In Switzerland, federal execution describes federal compulsory measures against individual cantons, if they do not comply with their federal obligations. The foundations of this were Articles 173 and 186 of the Federal Constitution. Federal execution may also have meant the fulfilment of duty by the Confederation at the expense of the canton (replacement action) or temporary suspension of subsidies. The last measure would then have to have been a military action against the canton. The federal execution was decided by the Federal Assembly and the implementation of it was the responsibility of the Federal Council. The following prerequisites must have been cumulative for the Federal Security to implement them: # violation of federal obligations by cantons # forced threat # warning # deadlines. In addition, a canton could appeal to the federal court before the execution, if it saw itself violated by the covenant. The Swiss Confederation was differentiated from the Federal Intervention in Switzerland. The latter served the protection of cantonal organs against turmoil and disturbance in accordance to Article 52 of the Federal Constitution and may have been connected with the use of military troops. Today, the principle that cantonal police officers are deployed and army units of the Confederation are to be deployed on a subsidiary basis in case of urgent need. In the country-wide general strike of 1918, different methods were used. Some army units serving in the First World War were used against striking workers, which ultimately also led to some casualties. It was an official service, whilst maintaining cantonal sovereignty, not a federal intervention. Ten federal interventions have been carried out since 1848, nine of them during the 19th century, the tenth during the unrest in Geneva in 1932.  Used terms  Whilst the federal execution in the German Confederation was directed against a member state, which did not want to fulfil its obligations, the federal intervention was a help for the member state that was beset by unrest which it could not itself suppress. The federal execution was the legal equivalent to the Reichsexekution in the Holy Roman Empire and in the German Empire. In the Basic Law for the Federal Republic of Germany of 1949, the term \\"Bundeszwang\\" (English: federal pressure) is used.  Further reading  * H.

It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1990. History Benedict Doll moved from Toledo, Ohio to Coldwater in 1894 and purchased the brewery which was formerly located near the site of this house. The Doll family initially lived in the brewery, but by 1899 the family had grown to six children. Profits from the brewery had also grown, and that year Doll had this house constructed. The family moved in in January 1900. (note: large pdf file) Coldwater voted to become a dry city in 1909, putting the brewery out of business. Doll turned to selling ice, and also operated a rubbish-removal service. As automotive traffic increased along the Chicago Road, Doll and his children opened a gas station, and later a restaurant near the brewery. Benedict Doll continued to live in this house until his death in 1941. His wife continued to live in the house until her death in 1955, and some of the couple's children occupied the house until it was sold out of the family in 1985. Description The Benedict Doll House is a 2-1/2 story wood frame Eastlake house with a cross-gable-and-hip roof covered with metal tiles. The house stands on a cut fieldstone foundation and is covered with clapboards below the gables, which are covered with shingling on the front and sides. The front of the house is spanned with a long porch with turned posts and spindlework. A smaller second floor porch is above the entryway. On the interior, the front entry leads into a stair hall. A parlor is located off the hall, and a narrow corridor leads back to the kitchen.

Henry Ferrers has been described by one recent historian as \\"arguably the most successful member of his family\\" on account of his being the only one, in six generations, to have succeeded to his patrimony as an adult, thus \\"protecting his inheritance from the hazards of wardship.\\"http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/54521/65399] Career Henry Ferrers was active in royal service from early on. By 1325, he was with the Prince of Wales, Edward of Windsor in France, having accompanied Henry Beaumont in his retinue. Events in England were however coming to a head at this time. In 1327, King Edward II was overthrown and forced to abdicate by his wife, Queen Isabella and her lover Roger Mortimer, but by the end of the decade their regime had become equally unpopular, and there was increasing baronial opposition to their rule.McKisack, M., The Fourteenth Century: 1307‚Äì1399 (Oxford, 1959), 98-100. From at least 1329 then, Henry Ferrers was also in the service of Henry, Earl of Lancaster, a leader of that opposition, and Ferrers provided military assistance at Bedford with him in January that year in the earl's chevauch√©e against Isabella and Mortimer. As a result, his lands were confiscated by their regime, but were released back to him in February, and Ferrers was allowed to avoid payment of a ¬£5,000 fine that had been levied on him. Ferrers was partly responsible for the capture and eventual hanging at Tyburn of the Queen's lover, Roger Mortimer, and for this he later received a pardon for any offences committed in the course of this episode.Cokayne, G.E., The Complete Peerage of England, Scotland, Ireland, Great Britain and the United Kingdom, Extant, Extinct or Dormant V, eds V. Gibbs & H.A. Doubleday (2nd ed., London 1916), 346. Soon after, Ferrers was appointed to the earl's council, for which he received an annuity of ¬£100. Ferrers was also due to take part in the aborted Irish campaign of 1332 (with \\"as great a force as he could muster\\"),Cokayne, G.E., The Complete Peerage of England, Scotland, Ireland, Great Britain and the United Kingdom, Extant, Extinct or Dormant V, eds V. Gibbs & H.A. Doubleday (2nd ed., London 1916), 345. but he did fight as one of the 'Disinherited' with Edward Balliol against Scotland later the same year. He was appointed Keeper of the Channel Islands in 1333, and two years later he received the Constableship of Berwick-on- Tweed, prior to a return to military service in Scotland in 1336. He was also intermittently Justice of Chester between 1336 and 1342. As both royal councillor and King's Chamberlain, Ferrers played an important role in the Edward III's military campaigns of the 1330s. Not only did he play an active role in the actual fighting, but he was responsible for negotiating alliances (such as that with the Count of Flanders) and loans for the King. In the case of the latter he was often the Ing's personal guarantor. In return, Ferrers was granted various profitable concessions from the wine trade and the right to hold weekly markets and fairs in Groby, Woodham, and Stebbing. In 1337, he received a royal grant of manors in Buckinghamshire, Derbyshire, and Essex., which together provided an annual income of ¬£160. He was also promised 460 marks per annum by Edward III in view of Ferrers' almost constant service at this time; in 1431 he once again travelled abroad for the King, this time to Brittany. Marriage and inheritance When his father died in 1325, Henry Ferrers was at least twenty-two years of age, and so, on paying his homage to King Edward II, could enter immediately into possession of his inheritance on 24 April that year.Cokayne, G.E., The Complete Peerage of England, Scotland, Ireland, Great Britain and the United Kingdom, Extant, Extinct or Dormant V, eds V. Gibbs & H.A. Doubleday (2nd ed., London 1916), 344. By 1331 he had married Isabel de Verdun, who was coheiress to Theobald de Verdun, 2nd Baron Verdun (who had died in 1316). This resulted in Henry Ferrers obtaining possession of property, through his wife, in Ireland and throughout the English Midlands, from Gloucestershire and Derbyshire. He also received the reversion of many of his mother-in-law's manors. Henry was survived by Isabel, as well as by two sons and two daughters. His heir was William, who would inherit the Groby lordship as third baron (1333 - 1371).

Death In July 1342 he was described in the records as being \\"sick and weak\\" and his condition seems never to have improved; he died at Groby on 15 September 1343. He was buried at Ulverscroft Priory. His wife survived him by four years; they had had two sons, including William, his heir, and two daughters.

The division traced its heritage back to the 265th Rifle Division, which was formed in mid-1941 from an NKVD division. The 265th fought in the Continuation War and the Siege of Leningrad through 1944 and the Battle of Berlin in 1945. Postwar, it was withdrawn to the Soviet Union and downsized into a rifle brigade before being expanded into the 71st Mechanized Division in 1953. It was relocated to Vilnius and converted into the 119th Motor Rifle Division in 1957 before relocating to the Soviet Far East in 1964 and being renumbered as the 265th Motor Rifle Division. It spent the rest of its career in the Far East and was downsized into a storage base in 1989.  History   World War II  The 265th Rifle Division began forming on 26 June 1941 in the Moscow Military District as the 17th NKVD Mountain Division. It was one of the fifteen NKVD divisions that began forming on 26 June and was transferred to the Red Army in early July. The 265th, whose major subunits included the 450th, 941st, and 951st Rifle Regiments, the 798th Artillery Regiment, and the 224th Anti-Tank Battalion, remained in the Moscow Military District at least until 10 July, and later that month moved to Leningrad with a 1500-man cadre of NKVD personnel. In early August it joined the 23rd Army, fighting in the Continuation War north of Leningrad on the Karelian Isthmus. On 26 August, its first Red Army commander, Major Ivan Prytkov, was assigned to the division. A memorial to the 265th Rifle Division in the village of Sofrino on the Karelian Isthmus On 14 October, the division was transferred to the Neva River front, south of the city. In November it became part of the 8th Army, which was part of the Volkhov Front from early 1942. In November 1943, the 265th was withdrawn to the Reserve of the Supreme High Command and from February 1944 was either part of the Leningrad Front or the 3rd Baltic Front until the end of 1944. Between June and July, it was part of the 21st Army's 110th Rifle Corps for the Svir‚ÄìPetrozavodsk Offensive on the Karelian Isthmus, which eventually forced Finland out of the war. In August the 265th became part of the 3rd Baltic Front reserves, and in October it was with the 3rd Shock Army's 7th Rifle Corps in the 2nd Baltic Front. Just before the Vistula‚ÄìOder Offensive began in January 1945, the division transferred to the 1st Belorussian Front. It fought in the advance through Poland and in the Battle of Berlin in April and May 1945. During the war, the division was awarded the honorific \\"Vyborg\\".  Postwar  As of 1 December 1945, the division was still with the 3rd Shock Army's 7th Rifle Corps in eastern Germany, part of the Group of Soviet Forces in Germany. On 6 June 1946, the 265th was withdrawn to the Moscow Military District with the 7th Rifle Corps, which was disbanded. The 265th further relocated to Shuya in the Gorky Military District as part of the 1st Guards Rifle Corps, where it became the 34th Separate Rifle Brigade. In October 1953, it was expanded into the 71st Mechanized Division. By the beginning of August 1956, the 71st was relocated from Ivanovo to Vilnius, and on 5 June 1957 was converted into the 119th Motor Rifle Division, part of the 10th Army Corps (formerly the 10th Rifle Corps) in the Baltic Military District. Beginning on 11 July 1964, the division was relocated from Vilnius to the Amur Oblast. It was replaced at Vilnius by the 107th Motor Rifle Division. On 11 January 1965, the division was renumbered as the 265th Motor Rifle Division. In the Far East, the division was stationed at Vozzhayevka (near Belogorsk), and became part of the 35th Army from 1969. In the late 1980s, the division's 421st Motor Rifle Regiment was based at Pozdeyevka, the 373rd Tank Regiment and division headquarters at Vozzhayevka, the 695th Motor Rifle Regiment and 798th Artillery Regiment at Srednebelaya, and the 212th Motor Rifle Regiment at Cheremkhovo.

This is primarily seen in nuclear reactors, where the release of high-energy neutrons causes the long-term degradation of the reactor materials. The embrittlement is caused by the microscopic movement of atoms that are hit by the neutrons; this same action also gives rise to neutron-induced swelling causing materials to grow in size, and the Wigner effect causing energy buildup in certain materials that can lead to sudden releases of energy. Neutron embrittlement mechanisms include: * Hardening and dislocation pinning due to nanometer features created by irradiation * Generation of lattice defects in collision cascades via the high-energy recoil atoms produced in the process of neutron scattering. * Diffusion of major defects, which leads to higher amounts of solute diffusion, as well as formation of nanoscale defect-solute cluster complexes, solute clusters, and distinct phases.  Embrittlement in Nuclear Reactors  Neutron irradiation embrittlement limits the service life of reactor-pressure vessels (RPV) in nuclear power plants due to the degradation of reactor materials. In order to perform at high efficiency and safely contain coolant water at temperatures around 290¬∫C and pressures of ~7 MPa (for boiling water reactors) to 14 MPa (for pressurized water reactors), the RPV must be heavy-section steel. Due to regulations, RPV failure probabilities must be very low. To achieve sufficient safety, the design of the reactor assumes large cracks and extreme loading conditions. Under such conditions, a probable failure mode is rapid, catastrophic fracture if the vessel steel is brittle. Tough RPV base metals that are typically used are A302B, A533B plates, or A508 forgings; these are quenched and tempered, low-alloy steels with primarily tempered bainitic microstructures. Over the past few decades, RPV embrittlement has been addressed by the use of tougher steels with lower trace impurity contents, the decrease of neutron flux that the vessel is subject to, and the elimination of beltline welds. However, embrittlement remains an issue for older reactors. Pressurized water reactors are more susceptible to embrittlement than boiling water reactors. This is due to PWRs sustaining more neutron impacts. To counteract this, many PWRs have a specific core design that reduces the number of neutrons hitting the vessel wall. Moreover, PWR designs must be especially mindful of embrittlement because of pressurized thermal shock, an accident scenario that occurs when cold water enters a pressurized reactor vessel, introducing large thermal stress. This thermal stress may cause fracture if the reactor vessel is sufficiently brittle.

Joy, N 1932 A Practical Handbook of British Beetles Fauna Europaea Habitat These longhorns are linked to deciduous forest and they occur in forests, glades, pastures and old deciduous trees. In the Alps they rarely exceed an elevation of above sea level. Description Grammoptera ruficornis can reach a body length of about . Females are longer and wider than males. These small longicorns have a stretched and densely punctate body (pronotum and elytra), not very narrow at the back, with silky hairs on the elytra. Eyes are rather close to the jaw base. The color is dark brown or black, with long yellow-red antennae that are almost as long as the body and show an elongate 2nd segment. Also the legs are partly yellowish red, with bulbous bicoloured femora, but hind femora sometimes are entirely black.

The main legal instruments of African Union law include the Constitutive Act of the African Union, the African Charter on Human and Peoples' Rights, the African Charter on the Rights and Welfare of the Child, the African Charter on Democracy, Elections and Governance and the Treaty Establishing the African Economic Community. Examples of soft law instruments include the Declaration on Gender Equality in Africa, Guidelines and Measures for the Prohibition and Prevention of Torture, Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment in Africa (The Robben Island Guidelines), Declaration of the Principles on Freedom of Expression in Africa, Ouagadougou Declaration and Plan of Action on Accelerating Prisons and Penal Reforms in Africa, Principles and Guidelines on the Implementation of Economic, Social and Cultural Rights in the African Charter on Human and Peoples' Rights, Guidelines for African Union Electoral Observations and Monitoring Missions, Pretoria Declaration on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights in Africa, Kigali Declaration, and Principles and Guidelines on the Right to a Fair Trial and Legal Assistance In Africa and Grand Bay (Mauritius) Declaration and Plan of Action. Development of law and legal norms In January 2017, a research project was established at the University of Sussex Law School, UK, on the concept of AU law. The project received initial funding from the Arts and Humanities Research Council, funding the project through 2019.

On 18 January 1971, West Germany issued a motif of special stamps for the 100th anniversary of the founding of the Empire on 30 Pfennig stamps (Michel catalogue 658 and 385) designed by the Deutsche Bundespost Berlin. This corresponded to the rate for a standard letter at the time. On 24 November 1971, a commemorative coin was struck with a nominal value of five Deutsche Marks which paid tribute to the same event.

This photographic style is usually used to create a mysterious atmosphere, that only suggests various shapes, often graphic, letting the viewer experience the photograph through subjective interpretation and often implies painting objects or the human body with black non-toxic dyes or pigments. Renaissance and Baroque, represented by different painting styles including sfumato and chiaroscuro used by artists like Leonardo da Vinci and Rubens), tenebroso (it. dark, mysterious) used by artists such as Caravaggio, Rembrandt, Jusepe de Ribera among others, produced paintings in which black was predominant on the canvas and the light often come from only one source to achieve dramatic scenes. Edward Weston, Yousuf Karsh and Irving Penn are among the photographers experienced with the \\"black on black\\" technique. Etymology According to the Online Etymology Dictionary the term \\"low-key\\" appeared in 1895, a term that described something \\"low-keyed\\" (relating quiet sound or deep musical tone); according to the Random House Webster's Unabridged Dictionary the term appeared between 1890‚Äì1895; however, the earliest (known) use of the term dates back to 1830 in the Genius of Liberty. The \\"Rembrandt lighting\\" (or \\"Rembrandtian light\\") is a term correlated mostly with low-key portrait photography which uses a light source and a reflector, or two sources of light (a main and a very low intensity fill light). The term was named after the style of lighting the face in most of Rembrandt's self-portraits, but also in other works, such as the Portrait of an Old Man in Red (1652‚Äì1654), dominated by Tenebrism. History Renaissance and Baroque painters have often used the sfumato, chiaroscuro and later the tenebroso painting modes not only to give a tridimensional impression in their paintings but also to achieve a dramatic atmosphere. After the decline in popularity of the Pictorialism movement, the new style of photographic Modernism came into vogue, and the public's interest shifted to more sharply focused images. Edward Steichen, Imogen Cunningham and Edward Weston were among the first photographers considered pioneers of low-key photography. Steichen's portrait of J. P. Morgan (1903), Pastoral ‚Äì Moonlight (1907), published in Camera Work No. 20, Cunningham's Succulent (1920) and Weston's Pepper No. 30 (1930) are considered the earliest low-key photographs. In art, black regained some of the territory that it had lost during the 19th century. The Russian painter Kasimir Malevich, a member of the Suprematist movement, created the Black Square in 1915, is widely considered the first purely abstract painting. He wrote, \\"The painted work is no longer simply the imitation of reality, but is this very reality ... It is not a demonstration of ability, but the materialization of an idea.\\" Painting Detail of the face of Leonardo da Vinci's Mona Lisa showing the use of sfumato, particularly in the shading around the eyes The antagonism between light and shadow is a basic principle of a visual image, regardless of its nature. Leonardo da Vinci pioneered the sfumato technique so he could soften the transition from lighter areas to darker ones in some of his paintings. In his notes about painting, he highlights that light and shadow should intermingle \\"without lines or borders, in the manner of smoke or beyond the focus plane\\". Sfumato usually implies using many translucent layers to create a gradual tone spectrum from dark to light, eliminating thus the unwanted sharp contours. The technique is emphasized in the Mona Lisa (1503‚Äì1506, Mus√©e du Louvre, Paris). Salome with the Head of John the Baptist, Caravaggio An Old Man in Red, Rembrandt On the other hand, chiaroscuro, another oil painting technique, uses strong tonal contrasts between light and dark to model three-dimensional forms, often to dramatic effect. The first use of light-dark three-dimensional shadows ‚Äì known as \\"skiagraphia\\" or \\"shadow-painting\\" in Ancient Greece ‚Äì is traditionally attributed to the Athenian painter of the fifth century BC, Apollodorus (in De Gloria Atheniensum, Plutarch). Leonardo da Vinci, through his Virgin of the Rocks (1483‚Äì1486, Louvre, Paris), influenced the use of chiaroscuro to create the illusion of depth; however, the term is most often associated with the works created in Mannerism and Baroque. In the Renaissance, the technique became essential to all \\"religious\\" painters who followed the visions of Bridget of Sweden, who claimed to have seen the light of Christ. In the paintings with religious scenes, the Renaissance artists reassigned this holy light as the predominant source of illumination, relying heavily on the chiaroscuro technique. This compositional approach has been extensively used in Tintoretto's Last Supper (1592‚Äì1594). If the religious chiaroscuro of the Renaissance served to create quiet and calm scenes, painters such as Caravaggio, Baglione, Veronese, and Georges de La Tour, had the tendency to use this style for a dramatic effect. In Baroque, painting relied heavily on the use of shadows for their dramatic effect. Caravaggio has accomplished the dramatic illumination to its greatest extent with his method called tenebrism ‚Äì a technique that has spread to Europe under the name of caravaggism. The works of Adam Elsheimer's were a turning point between chiaroscuro and tenebrism. At first glance, a tenebrism painting could look very similar to the one using powerful chiaroscuro effects. However, there is a difference between the two styles: chiaroscuro is a shading technique used especially to give objects the illusion of volume, while tenebrism is a compositional technique that uses very dark shadows, in which some areas of the painting are preserved darkly (sometimes black), allowing only one or two areas of interest to be strongly illuminated; at the same time, the transition from light to dark is not gradual. The style was used for a purely dramatic effect (hence the term \\"dramatic illumination\\"), and there was no involvement in trying to create the illusion of three-dimensionality. This style has been the victim of many negative criticisms in the Baroque, critics accusing artists of using this method to \\"hide\\" the mistakes of the paintings. First, Caravaggio's art, which approached the new artistic style in the most radical way, was aimed. Like Caravaggio, Rembrandt as well was accused of hiding his defects in the shades' painting. Tenebrism gave the darkness a positive value, both iconic and symbolic, creating thus a new aesthetics. Darkness was equivalent to light, because it conditioned the glory and the majesty of the latter. The symbols of light and darkness were expressed in the works of Tintoretto, Caravaggio, Georges de La Tour and Rembrandt. Photography Karsh's The Roaring Lion In the photography of one of the most prominent portraitists, the Canadian Yousuf Karsh (1908‚Äì2002), the light only outlines the face; it may highlight it more or less intensely, but from an artistic point of view, light plays a secondary role in the scene along with the main subject. His portraits contain large areas of black, and the subject appears like a spot in that achromatic nothingness. Nothing competes with the areas of his subjects' faces being highlighted, which gives the portraits an almost mystical aura. Thus, in the portrait of Winston Churchill, which according to The Economist is the \\"most reproduced portrait in the history of photography\\" and has been described as one of the \\"most iconic portraits ever shot\\", only his face is highlighted, while his head is outlined by another, very low light source, coming from the back; in the portrait of Jean Sibelius, the light is reduced even more, with half of the face being in gloom; in Helen Keller with Polly Thompson, both subjects are dressed in black and the background is also entirely black, so the photograph gives an impression of detachment, dissolution; Jasper Johns seems to emerge from a black ocean; the portrait of the French writer Fran√ßois Mauriac is only contoured from semi-profile, only an almost-abstracted line appearing on the black background. The strong contrast between black and white and the use of this contrast to overcome classical portraits, is characteristic of all these portraits, thus creating a dramatic, enigmatic, mystical atmosphere, abundantly making use of the so- called \\"active black\\". Yousuf Karsh is considered to be one of the contemporary artists who adopt the low-key photographic style in the most efficient manner, being called \\"one of the 20th century's great portrait photographers\\" by Time magazine. Other noteworthy examples that deal with black hues photography include Paul Strand's Blind (1916), where the subject is deliberately shadowed in order to create the gloomy atmosphere of the image, and the \\"Blind\\" sign is lit; Ansel Adams's Mt. Moran, Teton National Park, natural light falls only on the peak of the mountain, while the rest of the photo is a mixture of dark grey tones; some of Edward Weston's photographs are also illustrative of the low-key style, such as Nautilus (1930), Pepper No. 30 (1930), Cabbage Leaf (1931); Brassa√Ø's Filles de joie, Quartier Italie (1932); Bresson's Nehru Announces Gandhi's Death, (1948). In 1944, Robert Capa takes photos of Picasso in natural light that only highlights the right half of his face, leaving the left one in the shade. Irving Penn (1917‚Äì2009) took several low-key photographs of the American jazz trumpeter and composer Miles Davis. Among postmodernist photographers, the Australian Bill Henson photographs controversial nudes in low-key, Elad David works mainly with male nudes and in some of them only the busts ‚Äì no head ‚Äì of young men, is highlighted, leaving everything else in pitch black. Another artist who created a series of low-key photos exhibited in numerous exhibitions around the world, is the Finnish photographer Juha Arvid Helminen. He named his series The Invisible Empire, and refers to the shield that black colour offers, like a mask between who we truly are and the way society perceives us. Technique Painting a subject using acrylic black paint mixed with body cream Taking low-key photographs is possible in dark rooms where light penetrates only through a small window or a single unidirectional soft light, but the best results are achieved by using artificial studio lights. Sometimes, a single directed light source is sufficient. Usually, well- targeted sources are used to get the desired effect, since a large light source could considerably reduce the desired result. Special attention is paid to having sufficient neutral details that will, invariably, be left in the shade. This type of lighting is also known as Rembrandtian light. There are various technical challenges depending on the subject, what the photographer wants to highlight, or how many subjects are in the frame. Therefore, photographing a single person and, for instance, if the photographer wants to highlight only half of the subject's face, a single light source placed laterally, at a certain distance and angle to the subject, and possibly a blend, will be usually used. Experimenting with different light intensities is performed until the desired effect is achieved. For photographing two people or a static scene, two or even three sources of light (one or two for contour, and a very low-intensity fill light) are usually used. The background is kept dark (ideally, fully black), as well as part of the face that will remain in the shade. The relative power of the main and the fill lights, known as light ratio, can be measured using a light meter. The low-key technique has a higher light ratio, for example 8:1, while the high-key technique has a lower ratio, around 1:1. According to photographer Gavin Hoey \\"the first attention to detail has to be the background. It is best to keep it black or dark gray ... and from there, it is about improvising to achieve that perfect shot you have in mind\\" Lights Talking advises choosing and maintaining the lowest ISO (100, 64 or even 32) to get noise-free photographs. Painting the human body in black Unlike tattoo and other forms of body art, body painting is temporary, painted onto the human skin, and can last several hours or many weeks (in the case of mehndi or \\"henna tattoos\\" about two weeks). Painting the human body in black is also employed in low-key photography using non-toxic dyes or pigments in order to darken and enhance as much as possible the colour of the subjects photographed, and to achieve the desired effects. In order to achieve the effect of reflection of light that creates a white contour of the painted body, as well as a high contrast between black and white, various dyes mixed with body creams are used. These usually include henna, tempera or acrylic paint. Liquid latex, which is composed of natural latex and dyes, is also used with caution to avoid stopping the skin to breathe. Acrylic paint can be applied on the body with simple brushes or aerographs. This is one of the most used techniques because it dries very fast, provides elasticity and does not stain, since it is a water-soluble dye.

He collaborated with Umberto Nobile and participated in the preparation and shipment of the dirigible Italian airship to the North Pole, which was lost in the fleeting flight of 1928 on the polar banchisa. Trojani was one of the survivors of the disaster and, along with his comrades, was saved on the arctic pack after 48 days spent sheltering in the famous Red Tent, which he designed.  Biography  Trojani told his life in his book \\"Minosse's tail\\" dedicated to his passion for flying. For Trojani, everything started on May 24, 1908, when he was eleven years old, watching from the opposite bank of the Tiber at the first attempt to fly to L√©on Delagrange in Rome. The book goes on to describe his youth in Rome, his high school studies at the high school gymnasium Torquato Tasso (Rome), the entrance to the Application School of Engineers of San Pietro in Vincoli in Rome, the call to arms as Aspirant in the great War and subsequent imprisonment in Germany. When he returned from prison, Felice Trojani resumed his studies in engineering and found employment at CNA. He traveled to Japan in January 1927 to follow Umberto Nobile for mounting the N-3 airship, built at Rome's workshops for the Japanese Imperial Navy; In Japan Umberto Nobile asked Felice Trojani to collaborate on the arrangement of the Norge airship expedition to the North Pole. He participated in the design and construction of the Littorio Airport in Rome. It was renamed in 1927 by Umberto Nobile, first of all crew members, to contribute to the creation and to participate in the airship Italy, which collaborated with designing and assembly, to the North Pole. Upon returning from the Soviet Union, he became the technical director of Foligno Aeronautica Umbra SA (AUSA), where he designed the AUSA AUT 18 and AUT 45 aircraft. During the Second World War, he worked in Rome as Engineer of the Castelli Company at the Vatican City. At the end of World War II he emigrated to S√£o Paulo, where he opened a precision mechanics industry. The only survivors of the airship Italy never to have told publicly that version, even for the ban (ignored by everyone else). He was contacted in 1960 by the American psychiatrist George Simmons, at that time looking for information for its volume Target: Arctic, In which he analyzes the psychology of participants in the trip to the North Pole. Simmons convinced Felic Trojani to finally write his version, and to tell all the prodromes and consequences on his life of participation in the expedition. The Tail of Minos became the tale of half a century of aeronautics in Italy, from the dawn until the Second World War.

He was involved in the founding of a literary society in Machynlleth c. 1854. At this time, he worked for the printer Adam Evans.

In 1855-6 he oversaw the Welsh Wesleyans at Witton Park, Durham before emigrating to the U.S.A. He spent a year at a seminary and was consequently accepted as a minister of the Methodist Episcopal Church. Meredith nonetheless maintained his links to Wales by writing to the Eurgrawn and the Drych magazines, and by taking charge of Chicago's Welsh Wesleyan church.

It is a flat, raised area of marshland around long and wide among the tidal sand banks on the southern side of the estuary and separated from the British mainland of Chetney Marshes by a narrow channel known as Stangate Creek. The island is crossed by several narrow tidal channels that mean that at high tide the island is separated into several smaller islands.Ordnance Survey of Great Britain History Until the 18th century, the island was part of the mainland and formed the northernmost area of the parish of Upchurch. A track that ran from Shoregate Lane at Ham Green can still be traced. In the late 18th and early 19th centuries it was used as a quarantine base for disease-infected ships, with the bodies of those who died usually buried on Deadman's Island to the east. The island was also used for smuggling, particularly after rising customs duties in the late 18th century, with tea and spirits the most commonly smuggled items. In the first years of the 19th century, Burntwick became a hideout of the North Kent Gang, a notorious group of smugglers. In 1820 they were confronted by two blockade officers while unloading goods in Stangate Creek, resulting in serious injury to one of the officers and the escape of the perpetrators. The majority of the fifty-strong group were eventually captured with three executed on Penenden Heath near Maidstone and a further fifteen transported to Tasmania. The abolition of import duties in 1831 largely ended the practice of smuggling in the area. In 1845 the crew of the naval ship HMS Eclair contracted yellow fever and was sent to assist. The surgeon of Rolla, Sidney Bernard, moved to Eclair to treat the crew. On the ship's return to England, the authorities ordered the captain to moor in Stangate Creek to avoid spread of the disease and a cutter was deployed to prevent anyone leaving the ship. Bernard continued to tend to the crew until he also caught it and died aged 27 on 9 October 1845. He was buried on Burntwick Island and his grave, isolated among the marshy grasslands, is still visible. The remains of a small house are also still visible on the island, home in the 1840s of shepherd James Woolley and his wife Sarah, and later home to Thomas Hoare and Emma Castleton from the 1870s. In the early 20th century, the tide began to flood the island and the sheep were removed to the mainland. Also in the 19th century, the island was used as a refuse dump and much of the ground there is still littered with Victorian pottery and glass. The island then became the property of the Ministry of Defence and a battery was built there, later joined by a torpedo school and barracks during the Second World War. Since then it has been largely unused, becoming an important haven for seabirds, and is frequently fully submerged by the tide.

He was born in Curaco de V√©lez, Sector Chang√ºitad, Isla de Quinchao, Chilo√©, Chile on December 2, 1829, and died on January 11, 1892 in Santiago, Chile. He was son of Captain Juan Antonio Riveros of the Independencia and of Mercedes Cardenas, daughter of a royalist officer. He lived his childhood in Chang√ºitad, the land of his mother, in the neighborhoods of Curaco de V√©lez, Quinchao Island, Chilo√©). The move occurred shortly after his birth and this has led to various sources being consigned to Chang√ºitad or to Curaco de V√©lez/biografias/r/jose- alvarino-riveros-cardenas/2014-01-16/094019.html as the site of his birth. Nevertheless, this is contradicted by his baptismal certificate, which was filed in Valdivia. In 1843, the general Jose Santiago Aldunate placed him in the military academy after having lost his father. In 1848 he entered the squadron, and embarked aboard the steamer Chile as a midshipman. Among his companions were the sailors Simpson, Bynnon and Munoz Gamero, later superior heads of the Chilean Navy. In 1848 he made a study trip to Oceania and California aboard the French frigate Poursuivante, under the command of Admiral Legoumet. One of the first hydrographic expeditions was to the Tolt√©n River, in a period in which the Araucan√≠a had not yet been conquered. He was promoted to lieutenant in 1851, and, under orders of the commander Bynnon, made a trip to Europe in 1857 to bring to Chile the warship Maria Isabel. He was second chief of that ship when he was shipwrecked in Misericordia Bay. In 1859 he was promoted to the rank of Corvette Captain, and Frigate Captain in 1866. In 1863 he was sent to patrol the north coast, from Atacama to Mejillones, with the mission to monitor the border. He had control of the warships \\"Emeralda\\", \\"Independencia\\", and \\"Corbeta Abtao\\". In 1872 he was appointed maritime governor of Valparaiso and in 1876, he obtained the rank of Ship-of-the-line Captain.  War of the Pac√≠fic  At the outbreak of war, he was appointed commander of the Chilean ironclad Blanco Encalada and chief of a naval division that comprised the corvette O'Higgins, the Magallanes, and the transport Amazonas. After the failure of Juan Williams Rebolledo, he was given the control of the squadron. He did his job, and captured the Hu√°scar in the Battle of Angamos on October 8, 1879, by which he virtually annihilated the naval power of Peru. Promoted to the rank of rear admiral of the squadron, he participated in the war using the navy in support of ground forces. When the conflict was over, he returned to Chile with part of the expeditionary army, leaving the command of the squadron to the captain of navy Juan Jose Latorre. He retired from the navy on August 20, 1881. He died in Santiago on January 11, 1892.

Origins Born before 1350, the son of Robert Hill, a lawyer, he made his home at Shilstone in the parish of Modbury in Devon. He is often confused with another Robert Hill (died 1423), who lived at Spaxton in Somerset and was the son of Sir John Hill (died1408), a Justice of the King's Bench. Career He initially entered politics, sitting as MP in the Parliament of England for various Devon constituencies. In 1372 he represented both Dartmouth and Tavistock; then Plympton in 1373, in both Parliaments of 1377, and in 1380; and finally in 1379 Exeter. Thereafter he followed his father in a legal career, becoming one of the counsel retained by Edward Courtenay, Earl of Devon, in 1384, a member of the Inner Temple, and in 1388 a serjeant-at-law. By 1399 he was a King's Serjeant, and was called on for a so-called loan of 100 pounds to aid in the King's wars against the Welsh and the Scots. In 1408 he was created a Justice of the Common Pleas, remaining in post for the rest of his life. Though he acted as chief justice following the death of Edward Norton, he was never formally appointed. In 1415 he was one of the judges in the Southampton Plot treason trial, in which Richard of Conisburgh, 3rd Earl of Cambridge, Henry Scrope, 3rd Baron Scrope of Masham, and Sir Thomas Grey were condemned and beheaded. In 1417 he was appointed to hold sessions in Wales and in 1422 was chief justice of the Isle of Ely. His salary was last paid at Easter 1423 and he died shortly after, maybe in 1425. Family He married Elisabeth Wadham, sometimes called Isabel, daughter of Sir John Wadham, of Edge, Justice of the Common Pleas from 1388 to 1397, and his wife Elizabeth, daughter and coheir of William Shilston, of Shilstone. Their children included his heir Robert II Hill, born about 1392, who was High Sheriff of Devon in 1428. By 1419 Isabel had died and he had become the fourth husband of Joan, daughter and only legitimate heir of Sir Otto II Bodrugan, High Sheriff of Cornwall in 1381, who survived him and died in April 1428. She was the granddaughter of Sir Otto I Bodrugan, the half-sister of William I Bodrugan and the mother of William II Bodrugan.

Home of Tall Betsy The Centenary district received national attention from 1980 to 1998 when a house owned by businessman Allan Jones located at 150 Centenary Avenue NW became the site of Halloween appearances by the famous Tall Betsy goblin that stands more than 7 feet, 6 inches tall. Centenary Avenue is mentioned in a famous poem about Tall Betsy and in a state resolution adopted on May 24, 1989 honoring Tall Betsy as the ‚Äúofficial Halloween Goblin of Bradley County.‚Äù The historic district was also featured in a 2011 documentary about Tall Betsy that aired on PBS and NBC and won a prestigious Telly Award in 2013. It was narrated by Lynn Hoffman, host of A&E;‚Äôs popular ‚ÄúPrivate Sessions.‚Äù The residential areas within the district achieved their maturity before 1900, though Sycamore has grown considerably from the 3,330 or so that lived there from about 1900 until the 1970s most of the historic district remains intact as it was organized in 1978. Tall Betsy was started in 1980 by Jones, who at the time was a single parent raising his daughter Courtney and living at the Centenary residence. Jones had heard his mother, Gincy Slaughter Jones, tell stories of Tall Betsy as he was a child growing up at 480 21st Street NW in Cleveland, TN.Tall Betsy to Appear at Block Party, Cleveland Daily Banner, Official Site. Retrieved 30 October 2015. According to Jones, who later became known as ‚ÄúMr. Halloween,‚Äù the real Tall Betsy was a very tall woman who walked the streets of Cleveland, TN in the early 1920s. She always wore black and was referred to by the townspeople as Tall Betsy, Black Betsy, and the Lady in Black. Tall Betsy first appeared in Cleveland's Johnston Park downtown for an afternoon event on Halloween day, 1980. Jones' mother was hosting a party for Courtney at the Centenary Avenue home before the kids went out trick-or- treating. Jones left Johnston Park and got a friend in a pickup truck to allow him to lay in the back and deliver him to the party at 150 Centenary Avenue. Jones appeared in the backyard and scared the kids, who were the first to see Tall Betsy. As they left to go down the street trick-or-treating, Tall Betsy walked in front of the Jones house and stood waiting for young trick-or- treaters. As Tall Betsy became popular across Tennessee and eventually nationwide, thousands came to Jones' door each year and thousands more simply drove by the Centenary home.About Tall Betsy , TallBetsy.com, Official Site. Retrieved 30 October 2015. The goblin became so popular that in 1986, Jones organized the downtown Halloween Block Party that included games, costume contests and treats. The event was intended to draw the crowds off of Centenary Avenue after 8 p.m. In 1993 the Jones house kept count and set a world record of 11,201 pieces of bubble gum given away one at a time to young kids coming to the Centenary Avenue home from 5 to 8p.m. After drawing a crowd of 25,000 in 1998, Jones retired Tall Betsy and moved away from Centenary Avenue.

The company primarily transports cargo on short sea routes within Europe. History The company had its roots in Ugland-Aall Car Carriers (UACC), established in the 1970s. Johan Benad Ugland was a shareholder in the group. In 1990, its commercial operations and fleet of 19 vessels were sold (and rebranded as United European Car Carriers) to focus together with Leif H√∂egh & Co, on Hoegh-Ugland Autoliners (\\"HUAL\\") as a deep sea Roll-on/roll-off carrier. From 1990, UECC is jointly owned by Nippon Yusen Kaisha and Wallenius Lines, in a 50-50 share agreement. The main purpose of the acquisition was the plan to offer short sea service for Japanese automobile manufacturers that had manufacturing plants in Europe, along with improving the intra-Europe feeder network, by providing extensive connections to a number of destinations that could not be served by oceanic vessels due to physical or commercial limitations. UECC was the first roll-on/roll-off line to build and deploy a liquified natural gas-powered ship. In 2016, the company took delivery of two dual fuel LNG pure car and truck carriers, Auto Eco and Auto Energy, of the 1A Super Finnish/Swedish ice class. At that time, the vessels were the largest dual fuel vessels in the world, with a capacity of 4,000 cars each. Operations UECC has 18 vessels that call at over 25 ports every week. Its trade routes include Belgium-Germany to the Scandinavian and Baltic countries (including Russia), Mediterranean to Northern Europe (including Greece, Turkey, Italy), Spain and France to UK and Netherlands. The main business is the domestic maritime transport and distribution of cargo such as automobiles, trucks, trailers, Mafi roll trailers, heavy construction machineries and further types of rolling freight. The company is also active in terminal operations, controlling some of the on-shore activities, vehicles handling and storage facilities of ports such as Pasajes and Vigo in Spain, and Zeebrugge in Belgium. Aside from its headquarters in Oslo, UECC also has four other branch offices in Madrid, Setubal, Odessa and Grimsby.

Johan Carl Emil (Jean) Boldt (19 April 1865 ‚Äì 16 May 1920) was a Finnish advocate and journalist, who was known as a theosophist and anarchist.  Life  Boldt was born in the Eastern Finnish town of Kuopio. He studied law in the University of Helsinki graduating in 1886. In the 1890s, Boldt became interested in socialism, tolstoyanism and theosophy. In 1896‚Äì1898, he was the editor of the pacifist magazine Humanitas. It was disbanded as the founder Matti Kurikka exiled to North America. In 1900, Boldt and Pekka Ervast established the shortly-lived theosophic magazine Uusi Aika (The New Age). During the first years of the 1900s, Boldt moved from tolstoyanism to socialism, but his views were considered too radical and Boldt was not accepted to the Social Democratic Party. In the 1910s, Boldt became an anarchist. After the 1917 February revolution he organized demonstrations by Helsinki Cathedral. At the same time, the tolstoyan anarchist Arvid J√§rnefelt kept meetings in the cathedral as well as several other Helsinki churches. Since the beginning of June, Boldt and his supporters gathered daily. He also tried to set up an armed guard in response to the Social Democrat Red and right-wing White Guards, but this never succeeded. Finally, in 17 June, a Boldt led a group of anarchists who took over the Helsinki Cathedral. After an 18-hour siege, the militia stormed the church and arrested Boldt, which caused riots at the next Senate Square. According to the newspaper stories, Boldt had 400 supporters. He was taken to the Niuvanniemi mental institution, but his supporters still had demonstrations by the cathedral for several weeks. Boldt died in the Kulosaari district of Helsinki in 1920 at the age of 55. His literal work includes a collection of Swedish-language poetry and pamphlets on prostitution, militarism and animal protection.  Family  Boldt was born to the family of the general Johan Didrik Boldt and Anna Christina Frosterus, who was the daughter of the bishop of the Diocese of Oulu, Robert Frosterus. His brothers were the local historian Robert Boldt (1861‚Äì1923), the author Alexander Boldt (1873‚Äì1956) and the philosopher of religion and socialist Georg Boldt (1862‚Äì1918).

It is a research-intensive cluster. The Pittsburgh Quantum Institute (PQI) was founded in 2012 with the mission ‚Äúto help unify and promote quantum science and engineering in Pittsburgh‚Äù. With financial support from the Dietrich School of Arts and Sciences at the University of Pittsburgh, PQI provides leadership throughout Pittsburgh in areas that impact the ‚Äúsecond quantum revolution‚Äù. PQI members have faculty appointments from Duquesne University, Carnegie Mellon University, and the University of Pittsburgh in physics, chemistry, and engineering disciplines. The Pittsburgh Quantum Institute currently consists of 100 professors and their groups, a number that keeps growing every year with faculty appointments in the various departments of the member institutions. PQI sponsors and organizes research seminars, panel discussions, public lectures, and outreach activities, and a signature event (PQI20XX in April) that brings in a dozen plenary speakers and a public lecture. PQI supports graduate students with research and travel awards, and sponsors two well-attended poster sessions per year. The PQI website (www.pqi.org) highlights research and researchers, hosts multiple videos, and provides a regular feed of information relevant to the PQI community. PQI also coordinates with other important centers and facilities (Pittsburgh Supercomputing Center, Petersen Institute for Nanoscience and Engineering, Carnegie Mellon University Nanofabrication Facility, and the Center for Research Computing). Basic scientific research \\"Quantum\\" comes from the Latin meaning \\"how much.\\" It refers to the discrete units of matter and energy that make up every single object in the universe. The laws of physics that govern objects on a macroscopic scale are well understood, both scientifically and intuitively. At atomic and sub-atomic scales, these ‚Äúclassical‚Äù laws break down. At the turn of the twentieth century, a series of scientific crises challenged our perception of the world. What emerged from this period of scientific turmoil was the development of quantum mechanics, a theory that is as strange as it is precise in predicting the behavior of matter, the nature of chemical bonds, and the properties of materials like semiconductors and superconductors. Quantum mechanics is the firm foundation on which all of physical science rests. It is the study of a system in terms of its most fundamental (and tiny) constituents such as electrons, neutrons, photons: particles that also act like waves‚Äîor is it waves having the properties of particles? On this atomic scale, which is governed by Planck's constant, the properties of a system are very different than that of bulk matter. This diverging behavior leads to emerging phenomena that cannot be explained or accounted for in classical terms. Quantum mechanics can thus predict or explain a variety of phenomena in a variety of systems, from the well established photoelectric effect to the transmission of information via entangled quantum objects. These phenomena arise from the concepts of quantum mechanics; for instance, the wave-particle duality allows electron to tunnel through classically unsurmountable barriers, the condensation of electrons into Cooper pairs, which is the basis of superconductivity, is made possible only because of Pauli's exclusion principle. In addition, previously inaccessible states of matter such as photonic matter or topological insulators are being explored for applications that can revolutionize the modern world. All those quantum phenomena and many more are the basis of technologies that are surreptitiously invading our daily life. Quantum mechanics is what drives lasers or determines the bonding of a drug to a protein. It is the basis of light-matter interactions and spectroscopic techniques. Scientists at the University of Pittsburgh, Carnegie Mellon University, and Duquesne University work in diverse fields of physics, chemistry, and engineering towards a wide range of applications. They investigate surfaces and heterojunctions, quantum dots and potential energy surfaces, non-linear optical systems and entangled qubits. They postulate, develop, fabricate, characterize, calculate. The Pittsburgh Quantum Institute was founded to bring together those key players of the quantum scene in a unified yet diverse community for the promotion of quantum research.  Quantum Chemistry  Theoretical chemistry is thus a powerful tool that allow to either explain experimental measurements or to predict behaviors that have yet to be observed. Researchers at the Pittsburgh Quantum Institute use and refine these tools and apply them to the study of a variety of phenomena and systems. Methodological development is an important research thrust at PQI; for instance, stochastic approaches such as the diffusion Monte Carlo method and Energy Decomposition Analysis are developed at PQI. Dynamics simulations are used to model the evolution of the system in time, with applications in biochemistry or biophysics, where transport of ions in biological channels or protein folding and binding can be investigated. Computational drug design is also one of the most representative application of computational chemistry, as thousands of compounds can be easily and quickly screened for compatibility in terms of structure and energetics. Similarly, the vast configuration space of materials structure and properties can be explored through simulations towards the building of functional devices from the bottom up, the design of electrolytes for next generation batteries, the identification of biomaterials for energy storage and separation applications, or the characterization of optimal structures for organic and hybrid solar cells. PQI researchers study the fundamental chemical forces controlling the composition, atomic structure, and optoelectronic properties of nanoparticles for environmental remediation and catalysis applications. Another research thrust is the use of various analytical methods to investigate the mechanism for enantioselectivity between chiral samples such as thin films and peptides. Similarly, the capabilities of the ion-trap mass spectrometer are used to elucidate the structure, determine the relative stability, and probe the general patterns in chemical reactivity of gas-phase metal ion complexes.  Quantum Computing  PQI researchers work on various aspects of quantum computing and information. Development in information theory as well as in quantum algorithms is carried out. Qubit platforms, such as superconducting microwave circuits and Majorana Fermions in semiconducting nanowires are designed for quantum computing. Quantum simulation is another approach to quantum computing; the experimental thrust is the design of a 1D solid state quantum simulation platform that can be controlled on the nanoscale, while a theoretical approach consists of the development of powerful numerical methods that would open the door to faster, more accurate simulations of various novel and exotic quantum systems on a classical computer.  Quantum Engineering  Memory devices To repeatedly write, store, and retrieve data on memory devices, those must be non-volatile, i.e., they must retain the information even when the power source is turned off. Those devices should also have fast writing speeds and read-access times as well as an ideally infinite number of read-write cycles. In addition, they would be portable, durable, and resistant to a variety of mishaps. PQI researchers are involved in the synthesis of novel electronic materials such as binary and complex oxides, amorphous chalcogenide alloys, and 2D materials. They use state-of-the art techniques such as Molecular Beam Epitaxy, nano- lithography, sputtering, or Pulsed Laser Deposition to fabricate devices for data storage applications. Sensors With the miniaturization of all electronic devices and the advances in nano-technology, sensors are becoming increasingly smaller and efficient. On the nanoscale, sensors can be designed to make use of the emerging electrical, mechanical, chemical, catalytic, and optical properties that arise from their quantum mechanical behavior. PQI researchers design new specialty optical fibers and develop new distributed fiber sensing schemes based on novel piezoelectric materials, whose shape is modified in response to an electric field, for applications as sensors for energy, safety, and structural health monitoring. Solar cells Solar cells are devices that convert the energy from sunlight to electrical current; they are therefore also called photovoltaic cells. They hold great promise as a source of renewable and clean energy and would help address the growing energy demands worldwide. PQI researchers design and fabricate solar cells consisting of various materials that exhibit exceptional transport properties that arise from ingenious novel structures. Computational methodologies are also developed towards the rational design of novel organic solar cell materials.  Quantum Matter and Phenomena  Condensed Matter Theory PQI researchers work towards the prediction or characterization of quantum matter and quantum phenomena. They have expertise in the properties of ultracold atomic systems, the dynamics of quantum many-body systems, topological phenomena arising from spin-orbit coupling and many-body interactions, and the simulation of quantum systems. Computational Physics Statistical mechanics, quantum mechanics, and computer simulations are also used to investigate the structure, stability and properties of novel materials, such as high-entropy alloys, liquid metals, and quasicrystals. Methodological developments, for instance in relativistic multiple scattering theory and high performance computing, in collaboration with the Pittsburgh Supercomputing Center. Quantum Phenomena From an experimental perspective, PQI researchers study the quantum behavior of various systems such as superconductivity, fractionalization of charge, and crystallization in van der Waals heterostructures; the collective behavior of nanoparticle arrays in which superparamagnetic-to-ferromagnetic and insulator- to-metal phase transitions are expected to arise; the structural and electronic properties of semiconductor materials and devices via scanning tunneling microscope; and electrically-controlled ferromagnetism at the interface of complex oxides. They also aim at developing a tool box based on nuclear magnetic resonance, quantum optics, quantum information science, chemistry, and nanoscience for the quantum control of condensed matter systems.  Quantum Optics  Research at the Pittsburgh Quantum Institute has yielded a number of exciting outcomes in the fields of optics and photonics, including flexible lightwave circuits in glass substrates, nonlinear optical topological insulators, and highly symmetrical and low-loss optical waveguides in flexible glass substrates that are thermally stable at high temperatures. Spectroscopic techniques such as fluorescence spectroscopy, 2-dimensional-infrared spectroscopy, Raman spectroscopy, 2-photon photoemission spectroscopy are used to probe various systems ranging from ionic liquids to polymers to metal surfaces.  Philosophy and Education  PQI counts among its numbers faculty members whose area of expertise are in history and philosophy of physics with emphases on relativity, quantum theory, statistical physics, chaos theory, and thermodynamical irreversibility. The crucial and decisive role of mathematics in the formation and application of physical theories is also investigated. In addition, our researchers are also interested in the broader topics of the philosophy of science, such as issues of causality, time, non-locality, and ontology, approaches to confirmation theory, inconsistency in theories, and thought experiments, with a special interest in Einstein's body of work on special and general relativity. Quantum mechanics is intrinsically non-intuitive, with concepts that greatly differ from the principles of the classical world we navigate in. Those concepts may be hard to grasp and even harder to explain. PQI member Chandralekha Singh investigates pedagogical approaches for the teaching of quantum mechanics at an undergraduate and at an advance level. Moreover, close ties with local Taylor Allderdice High School offer opportunities to PQI faculty to promote quantum sciences and engineering to the next generation, and to the high school students to sneak a peek during outreach events into the daily lives of a quantum scientist.  Scientific Outreach  PQI faculty and student members participate by delivering lectures at the annual PQI symposium as well as participating in other external events where they showcase their research in an effort to promote quantum sciences. The institute is also involved in outreach programs that target high schools, undergraduate colleges, and the general public. In addition to hosting guest speakers from around the world in the field of quantum science, PQI hosts or participates in a number of notable Pittsburgh educational events: * PQI2018 * Science2017 - poster session * PQI2017: Quantum Revolutions * Women in Quantum Science and Engineering Lecture Series * Science2016: Game Changers - poster session * PQI2016: Quantum Challenges * Science2015: Unleashed! - poster session * PQI2015: Quantum Coherence * PQI2014: Quantum Technologies * PQI2013: Quantum Matter  History  Initially defined as the Pitt Quantum Initiative, PQI was established in 2012 to help unify and promote quantum science and engineering in Pittsburgh. The Pitt Quantum Initiative was supported and funded by the Office of the Provost for Research of the University of Pittsburgh. Then vice- provost Dr. George Klinzing acted with cofounders Drs. Jeremy Levy and Andrew Daley to officially launch the initiative in September 2012. PQI finally became institutionalized in 2014. > ‚ÄúQuantum physics is an area where Pitt not only has a well-established > reputation, but where its strength and reputation are growing rapidly with > the introduction of many new groups over the course of the last few years,‚Äù > said PQI advisory committee member Andrew Daley, then assistant professor in > Pitt‚Äôs Department of Physics and Astronomy.  Organization  Staff offices for the Pittsburgh Quantum Institute currently occupy space in the historic Thaw Hall on the University of Pittsburgh's campus. During its inception, PQI staff shared workspace with Dr. Jeremy Levy's research group until dedicated office space was provisioned in the summer of 2015. PQI faculty and students reside in the offices and laboratories provided by their respective parent universities.  Executive Board  The executive board, led by director Dr. Jeremy Levy, includes a dozen faculty from all three institutions, as well as Dr. Andrew Daley, who kept his honorary cofounder seat despite moving his lab to the University of Strathclyde, Scotland, in the fall of 2013.  Logo  The PQI logo was designed using the widely used Dirac notation, which makes it instantaneously recognizable by the quantum community.

Early life and education Serpil Kemalbay, who's full name is Serpil Kemalbay Pekg√∂zeg√º, was born in Ardahan and completed her primary and secondary education there. She first participated in left-wing politics during her first year at secondary school, where she took part in a boycott staged by 'revolutionary struggle' (\\"devrimci m√ºcadele\\"). In 1978, she migrated with her family to ƒ∞stanbul and graduated from ƒ∞stanbul Technical University Department of Chemical Engineering. After staying in the United Kingdom for a number of years, she returned to Turkey in the early 1990s. Political activism Kemalbay was active in the Socialist Solidarity Platform. In 1997, she participated as a founding member of the Solidarity Homes as well as the ƒ∞MECE Women's Solidarity Association, which later went on to become a trade union. In 2007, she worked to increase the influence of BATƒ∞S, the independent textile workers union seeking to unify uninsured workers, in places such as Thrace and ƒ∞stanbul. She worked as an advisor on workers rights, women workers and safety standards for numerous trade unions. She worked in the medical manufacturing, textile and workers safety sectors before entering active politics. Political career Kemalbay joined the Peoples' Democratic Party, a left-wing pro-Kurdish political party in Turkey, and became a parliamentary candidate for ƒ∞stanbul's first electoral district in the June 2015 general election. Although the party won 80 seats and came joint third in the election, Kemalbay was not elected. She went on to become a member of the HDP Central Executive Committee with responsibilities for labour and trade union relations. Co-leader of the Peoples' Democratic Party In February 2017, the HDP's chairwoman Figen Y√ºksekdaƒü was stripped of her membership of the Grand National Assembly and had her party membership legally revoked by the courts. She had been imprisoned alongside the HDP's chairman Selahattin Demirta≈ü in November 2016 on charges of inciting violence and supporting terrorism, charges that they both deny. Although the HDP declared the decision void and unconstitutional, the revocation of Y√ºksekdaƒü's party membership resulted in the chairwomanship falling vacant. On 6 May, the HDP Central Executive Committee decided to nominate Kemalbay, who had the support of the HDP Women's Council, for the chairwomanship, thereby appointing her acting chairwoman until her position was confirmed by the party's congress.http://gazetekarinca.com/2017/05/hdpnin-yeni-es-genel-baskan-adayi- serpil-kemalbay/ The 3rd extraordinary congress was held on 20 May, where Kemalbay was formally elected unopposed as the party's co- leader.https://www.evrensel.net/haber/318616/hdpnin-es-genel-baskanligina- serpil-kemalbay-getirildi In the general elections of June 2018, Kemalbay was a candidate for the HDP in ƒ∞zmir. She was elected as an MP to the Grand National Assembly.  Legal prosecution  Kemalbay was arrested on February 13, 2018 following the HDP party congress in Ankara on charges of 'spreading terrorist propaganda' during the conference, during which banners of jailed Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK) leader Abdullah √ñcalan were unveiled. Displaying PKK banners is illegal in Turkey. She was released a week later, but still faces charges and is prohibited to leave the country.

She was among Arkansas's earliest women physicians and the first female faculty member at the University of Arkansas Medical School. Early life Ida Josephine Brooks was born in Muscatine, Iowa, on April 28, 1853. She was the daughter of Rev. Joseph Brooks, a Methodist minister, and Elizabeth Goodenough. Her father was the governor candidate for Arkansas in 1872, against Elisha Baxter, who in the end was the winner. When she was very young, her parents moved to St. Louis, Missouri, and she there entered the public schools, beginning in the primary department of the Clay school, when Dr. William Torrey Harris began his career as a teacher. She graduated from Central High School in St. Louis in 1870. Her father moved to the South after Civil War, and Brooks went to Little Rock, Arkansas, in 1870. In 1877 she obtained an AB degree from Little Rock University, a private college. She taught in Little Rock public schools while continuing her studies at Drury College in Springfield, Missouri, obtaining her master's degree. Career In 1872, in conversation with a friend, Brooks warmly argued that women should earn their own money, and he made a wager that she would not do it herself. As a joke, he found her a school in Fouche Bottom, where the gnats were so thick that a smudge had to be kept continually burning. She accepted the position and taught there faithfully and well. In 1873, Brooks, with a liking for the work, began to teach at the Primary Department of the First Ward School, Little Rock. The following year she was made principal of the grammar school, and in 1876 she was made principal of the Little Rock High School. In 1877 she was elected president of the State Teachers' Association. She was also president of the Homeopathic Medical Examining Board. In 1882, Brooks joined the faculty at Little Rock University. Having become a Master of Arts, she was placed in charge of the mathematical department, where she taught until 1888 when she entered the Boston University School of Medicine, a course which had for years been her desire. She was graduated there with high honors in 1891 and afterwards took a post-graduate course on nervous diseases in the Westborough Insane Hospital. She spent one year as house officer in the Massachusetts Homeopathic Hospital, being assigned half the time on the surgical and half the time on the medical work. Returning to Little Rock in 1903, she established a private practice of pedriatics. Brooks was an earnest woman suffragist and a thorough temperance advocate. Ida Joe Brooks (1922) In 1914, Brooks joined the faculty of the University of Arkansas for Medical Sciences, the first female faculty member. She was a lecturer on social hygiene in the psychiatry department and later became associate professor of psychiatry. She was nominated to the office of State Superintendent of Public Instruction in 1920, but at the time women couldn't compete and her name was taken off the ballot. She was member of the Altrusa Club and the Woman's City Club of Little Rock. Personal life Brooks tried to enlist in the military service during World War I, but was rejected because she was a woman. She obtained a commission in the United States Public Health Service and served at Camp Pike. She died on March 13, 1939, and is buried at Bellefontaine Cemetery, St. Louis.

The prime meridian is at the bottom of the map. Aspledon Undae is shown on the southernmost black patch left, between longitude 291.38¬∞E to 301.4¬∞E (43.98¬∞W ‚Äì 57.08¬∞W). Aspledon Undae is one of the named northern circumpolar dune fields in the vicinity of Planum Boreum, the Martian North pole. It is named after one of the classical albedo features on Mars. Its name was officially approved by the International Astronomical Union (IAU) on 20 March 2007. Its name is Greek, and derives from the name of a town in Boeotia, Ancient Greece, which, in turn, took its name from Aspledon (), son of Poseidon, the ancient Greek god of the sea. The dunes of Aspledon Undae extend from latitude 71.47¬∞N to 75.14¬∞N and from longitude 305.83¬∞E to 315.04¬∞E (44.96¬∞W ‚Äì 54.17¬∞W). Its centre is located at latitude 73.06¬∞N, longitude 309.65¬∞E (50.35¬∞W), and has a diameter of 215.2 km. Aspledon Undae is the southernmost of the albedo-named dune fields of Planum Boreum, and lies to the south of Hyperboreae Undae and southeast of Siton Undae. It is theorised that the formation of Aspledon Undae may have occurred during early erosion incidents of the Planum Boreum cavi unit, and that Rupes Tenuis may have also been a sand source, although it is now depleted. Other dune fields sharing the same formation history include Olympia and Siton Undae. Aspledon Undae, along with Hyperboreae, Siton, Olympia, and Alalos Undae is one of the five named northern circumpolar dune fields. However, unlike the other four, it is not one of the densest. The dune field of Aspledon Undae, along with those of Siton, Hyperboreae, and Abalos Undae, overlays the lowlands of Vastitas Borealis. Aspledon Undae has been imaged by NASA's 2001 Mars Odyssey robotic spacecraft using the Thermal Emission Imaging System (THEMIS) camera on board the spacecraft. Formation Aspledon Undae, a dune field near the Martian north pole. The bottom side of the image shows hundreds of small, isolated dunes. On the top side, these small dunes appear to have coalesced into larger dune forms. According to Tanaka et al., Planum Boreum lies on two major basal units: The Rupes Tenuis unit and the Planum Boreum Cavi unit. The age of the Rupes Tenuis unit is early Amazonian, while the Planum Boreum Cavi unit overlays the Rupes Tenuis unit, and its age is Middle to Late Amazonian. The Olympia Undae unit may have formed during early denudation incidents of the Planum Boreum Cavi unit in its immediate neighbourhood. More distant dune fields from the Planum Boreum Cavi unit, such as Siton, Aspledon, and a large portion of Olympia Undae may have formed during earlier erosional events of the Planum Boreum Cavi unit. Other sources to these dune fields may include Rupes Tenuis, although this source is now considered to be exhausted.

Isaac David Burrell first attended Lincoln University (Pennsylvania) and later received an M.D. in 1893 from the Leonard Medical College of Shaw University in Raleigh, North Carolina. He moved to Roanoke and there established in 1893 a prospering medical practice as one of the few doctors for black patients. Burrell opened a drugstore, for many years the only black-owned drugstore in southwestern Virginia. He started a pharmacy on Gainsborough Road between Patton and Harrison Avenues that eventually became the largest black-owned pharmacy in southwest Virginia. His wife, Margaret Barnette Burrell (1873‚Äì1970) from Lynchburg, Virginia, was also recognized as a society leader in Roanoke. She was a graduate of Hampton Normal & Industrial Institute, and became a teacher in Roanoke's Third Ward School.Dotson, Rand. Roanoke, Virginia, 1882-1912: Magic City of the New South.

Roanoke Times. April 11, 2016. Named Burrell Memorial Hospital, the ten-bed facility was on Henry Street. The flu epidemic of 1919 created the need for expanded facilities, so the hospital moved into the abandoned Allegheny Institute building on the corner of McDowell Avenue and Park Street (now 7th Street) in 1921. This building was used until 1955 when the present hospital was opened. In 1919 the city leased the abandoned buildings of the Allegheny Institute to the doctors who ran the black hospital there from 1921 until 1955, when a modern brick hospital was constructed with the help of a woman's auxiliary. The civil rights movement in the 1960s opened white hospitals to black patients, and Burrell Memorial Hospital closed in 1978. The hospital also was established without support from the whites, and had the first African-American School of Nursing to be accredited in Virginia.

The Beat Generation was a group of post-WWII artists who challenged the social norms of the 1950s, encouraged experimentation with drugs and sexuality, practiced various types of Eastern religion, and desired to grow as humans. Also known as 'The Beats', they became famous in the 1950s and remain influential today. While dozens of personalities were involved in the formative years of the movement, the most celebrated members were Jack Kerouac, Allen Ginsberg, William S. Burroughs, and Neal Cassady. Some musicians are also considered to be part of the Beat Generation‚Äôs legacy including The Doors, Bob Dylan, The Beatles, and Tom Waits. Thomas Pynchon and Tom Robbins are examples of authors influenced by the Beat generation. The Beat Museum is dedicated to spreading the values of the Beat Generation, ‚ÄúCompassion, Tolerance, and of Living One‚Äôs Own Individual Truth.‚Äù. Its collection holds thousands of pieces of memorabilia from the era, hundreds of photographs of the Beats and their contemporaries, and an extensive book selection. History The Beat Museum began in Monterey, California in 2003 because the founders, Jerry and Estelle Cimino, were living there at that time. Estelle had some surplus office space which included a separate entrance at her downtown location for her career counseling business called the Career Action Center. Jerry had recently left corporate America and was ready to try something new, so he placed his personal collection of Beat memorabilia on display in downtown Monterey. The Beat Museum on Wheels Wanting to share the Beat Museum with the rest of America, Cimino and John Allen Cassady, son of Neal Cassady (Dean Moriarty in On the Road) and Carolyn Cassady, founded the Beat Museum on Wheels. Traveling from California to Maine to Florida and back again in an Airstream 345 motorhome in the fall of 2004 and 2005, Cimino and Cassady spoke at universities, high schools, and community centers. Stops included Penn State, Wayne State University in Detroit, SUNY Geneseo, Cal Poly in San Luis Obispo, University of Maryland, Baltimore County as well as performances at community centers such as the Henry Miller Memorial Library in Big Sur, the Fitton Center for Creative Arts in Hamilton, Ohio, KerouacFest in Windber, Pennsylvania, ArtSplash in Rockaway, New York and Lowell Celebrates Kerouac in Lowell, Massachusetts. The Beat Museum relocates to San Francisco Coming off the success of The Beat Museum on Wheels two year roadshow, The Beat Museum moved from Monterey, California to San Francisco's North Beach District in 2006. Initially, the museum secured a space for three months at the Live Worms Gallery on Grant Avenue. Later, it moved to a much larger location at 540 Broadway (at the intersection of Columbus Avenue and Broadway Street) directly across the street from City Lights Bookstore, at the epicenter of the 1950s San Francisco Beat hangout spots. Carolyn Cassady was the guest of honor for the opening weekend at the Beat Museum in North Beach and both the Associated Press and Reuters ran articles that ran in hundreds of newspapers around the world. Special guests at the opening included Michael McClure, Wavy Gravy, Al Hinkle, Magda Cregg, John Allen Cassady, Anne Marie Maxwell and Stanley Mouse. Exhibitions and acquisitions The museum has both permanent exhibitions and rotating exhibitions. Much of the Beat Museum‚Äôs acquisitions are items donated by family members, friends, and fans of the Beat generation. Recently donated pieces include the archives of publishers Arthur and Kit Knight; memorabilia from Kerouac‚Äôs funeral; and Allen Ginsberg‚Äôs typewriter. The referee shirt worn by Neal Cassady in Ken Kesey‚Äôs The Electric Kool-Aid Acid Test is on permanent display in the museum, as is Jack Kerouac‚Äôs tweed jacket, an original acid test card, and many other novelties from the Beat era. Walter Salles, director of 2012‚Äôs film adaptation of On the Road, donated the 1949 Hudson car to the Beat Museum. Per Salles‚Äôs request, the car is not to be cleaned: the dirt and grime of the famous cross-country road trip are to remain as part of the car. Permanent exhibits include details and memorabilia from the 1957 Howl obscenity trial, original art by Lawrence Ferlinghetti, Harold Norse, and Gregory Corso, a first edition copy of Kerouac‚Äôs first novel, The Town and the City, an advance copy from his hometown library, 'Women of the Beat Generation', which showcases the oft-forgotten Beat women, a room to display a continuously playing documentary, an exhibit called Passing the Torch: How the Beats Became the Hippies, and more. Original manuscripts, first editions, and letters also make up the collection. Past visiting exhibitions include: Harold Chapman photography of the Beat Hotel; Jim Hatchett photography of Lew Welch, Philip Whalen, and Michael McClure, and Brother Antoninus a.k.a. William Everson. Celebrity supporters Celebrity visitors to the Beat Museum include musicians Van Morrison, Patti Smith and Led Zeppelin‚Äôs Jimmy Page. Former governor and professional wrestler Jesse Ventura, actors Owen Wilson, Garrett Hedlund, Kristen Stewart, Michael Ornstein (Sons of Anarchy), Michael Imperioli (Sopranos), film maker John Waters and comedian and magician Penn Jillette, and singer Tom Waits. Waits‚Äôs song ‚ÄúCalifornia, Here I Come‚Äù is inspired by On the Road. The Beat Museum is highlighted in Jillette‚Äôs book Every Day is an Atheist Holiday!: More Magical Tales from the Author of God, No!, ‚ÄúFor a Beat fan, beatnik, peacenik, old hippie capitalist guy like me, this is the only museum that matters. Who needs old dinosaur bones?‚Äù. Jillette also poses semi-nude in a photograph in the book in homage to a similar photograph by Allen Ginsberg and Gregory Corso that hangs in the museum. As a comedian and entertainer, Jillette says he can relate to a story about Allen Ginsberg being heckled at a poetry reading and then shedding his clothes, ‚ÄúThe poet stands naked before the world. Are you willing to stand naked before the world?‚Äù. Public programs The Beat Museum holds regular readings and book signings and takes part in literature events such as the Litquake.

He was the last male member of the once powerful and prestigious Sz√©cs√©nyi family.Engel: Geneal√≥gia (Genus Kacsics, 4. Sz√©cs√©nyi branch) Family Ladislaus III was born into the Sz√©cs√©nyi family, which originated from the Kacsics kindred and had large estates in mostly N√≥gr√°d and Hont counties. He was the only child of Ladislaus II and Anne Sz√©csi. His grandparents were notable barons Frank Sz√©cs√©nyi and Peter Sz√©csi (\\"the Prince\\"). Feeling the nearness of his death, paterfamilias Simon Sz√©cs√©nyi (brother of the late Frank) concluded an inheritance contract with his nephew Ladislaus II (son of Frank) on 9 December 1411 in Letk√©s. Accordingly, his son Nicholas would be the sole heir of Salg√≥ Castle (B√∂rzs√∂ny), which was acquired by Simon alone decades earlier, while Tapolcs√°ny (today Topoƒæƒçany, Slovakia) belonged to Frank's branch. Holl√≥k≈ë and Ajn√°csk≈ë (today Hajn√°ƒçka, Slovakia) were classified to Ladislaus (Frank's son) and Nicholas (Simon's son), respectively, while those accessaries (villages and lands) were shared between the two branches. The remaining two castles (Somosk≈ë and Bene) and the surrounding villages became a joint family property, while both branches had to appoint an own castellan, simultaneously. Simon Sz√©cs√©nyi died soon in January 1412. A year later Ladislaus II died suddenly and Nicholas became owner of the whole Sz√©cs√©nyi property. As Ladislaus did not mention his namesake son in his last will and testament, it is presumable that Ladislaus III was born posthumously in the year of 1413, as his deceased father was not aware of pregnancy. The infant Ladislaus grew up in the court of Nicholas Sz√©cs√©nyi at Salg√≥ Castle, along with his mother Anne Sz√©csi. Under such conditions, Ladislaus III, who was first mentioned in 1414, did not receive his rightful heritage. Biography In 1424, Nicholas Sz√©cs√©nyi was condemned for coin counterfeiting, and consequently King Sigismund confiscated all of his estates. Mainz citizen Eberhard Windecke also claimed that Nicholas was responsible for the death of Ladislaus' namesakefather, accusing him of poisoning, but contemporary official documents do not confirm this assumption. Historian P√°l Engel argued in favour of Nicholas' innocence all the charges brought, as the relatives most immediately affected in the two trials (in 1345, Nicholas was exiled for alleged adultery) did not believe the charges. Ladislaus also retained his relationship with Nicholas, who raised him during his childhood. He even tried to pass the castle of Hegyesd as a titular pledge to the penniless Nicholas, which he inherited through maternal side in 1426, however Simon Rozgonyi, Bishop of Veszpr√©m and his brothers reported his intention to the royal court. As a result, Sigismund, who has been abroad for years, forbaded to Ladislaus to donate the fort to his relative, in his letter written on 25 September 1433 in Mantua, while travelled to the Council of Basel. Sigismund added Ladislaus could pledge the castle only to the Rozgonyis, in accordance with his instruction. It happened even in that year, Hegyesd Castle became a property of the Rozgonyis. Since the 1430s, Ladislaus Sz√©cs√©nyi gradually gained his inheritance. He took P√°ka fort, Zala County from his mother Anne Sz√©csi in 1431. Peter Cseh of L√©va handed over the half of the originally Hussite-fort Nagytapolcs√°ny (today Veƒæk√© Topoƒæƒçany, Slovakia) to him in exchange for the half of Tapolcs√°ny Castle in May 1434. In 1439, he was granted significant portions by King Albert from Nicholas Sz√©cs√©nyi's confiscated wealth. The 21 villages, which belonged to the Ajn√°csk≈ë lordship partly or fully, in addition to a half of Rimaszombat (today Rimavsk√° Sobota, Slovakia) were donated to Ladislaus Sz√©cs√©nyi. However the castle itself was granted to the P√°l√≥ci family. The King also returned the half of lands Sz√©cs√©ny and its belonging villages Alm√°s and Sztracin to Ladislaus in the same year. Half of the viage of Csuda in Bars County became Ladislaus Sz√©cs√©nyi's property too by 1435. A confession from a 1446 trial claimed there was a counterfeit document during the trial of Nicholas Sz√©cs√©nyi in 1424, which falsified in favour of Ladislaus to prevent the confiscation of the Sz√©cs√©nyi fortune. The document suggested that Simon and Frank received a privilege earlier that was not possible to confiscate the wealth due infidelity, since the other branch had to inherit it. There is no source that Ladislaus ever had used this fake. In 1438, Nicholas Sz√©cs√©nyi died unmarried and childless in exile. He made Ladislaus as heir of his virtually existed fortune (as considered himself to be their owner), leaving his all castles, towns and villages in Hungary to him, except Szakall, which he donated to the local Benedictine monastery, which had to be re-established, and asked Ladislaus to do the same with his own half. Much of the wealth and money, on which Nicholas Sz√©cs√©nyi counted in his last will and testament, proved to be a fiction in fact. According to the document, Nicholas bequeathed to Ladislaus all his \\"castles, small towns, villages and all other immovable property\\", in addition to 10 percent of his money. However, he commissioned his relatives to perform tasks. In addition, Ladislaus had to pay 1,1000 ducats to acquire all the official documents concerning the landholdings, and he also had to take care of Nicholas' familiares and household. Ladislaus was unable to meet these expectations, which would have resulted in significant expenditure expense. Albeit he sent a Franciscan friar to Venice, where his deceased relative spent his exile years, but after that he learned that he gained nothing, as Nicholas had bequeathed to him lands he no longer owned. From 1440 until his death, Ladislaus Sz√©cs√©nyi served as isp√°n of N√≥gr√°d and Hont counties. His term was characterized by the Hussites' permanent invasions into Upper Hungary, including the two aforementioned counties, who constantly looted the villages and plundered the region. In the 1440s, John Jiskra's mercenaries captured several castles of Sz√©cs√©nyi, including Tapolcs√°ny. Amid such a situation, he supported W≈Çadys≈Çaw III of Poland's claim to the Hungarian throne during the civil war, which broke out after Albert's death. He was a member of the Estates of the realm, which offered the crown to the Polish king in March 1440. Sz√©cs√©nyi participated in several assemblies of the Diet of Hungary in that year. He was a leading figure of the pro-W≈Çadys≈Çaw league in the Upper Hungary region. The local nobles concluded their first two armistices with Queen Elizabeth's mercenaries Hasko Schellendorf then John Jiskra in his estates Sz√©cs√©ny and Holl√≥k≈ë on 9 October 1441 and 17 September 1442, respectively. In September 1443 at Nowa Wie≈õ Spiska, Sz√©cs√©nyi was among the lords, who signed an armistice with John Jiskra, de facto ruler of Upper Hungary and a partisan of the infant Ladislaus the Posthumous. Sz√©cs√©nyi's wealth suffered the constant warfare, thus he pledged his several landholdings as loan security in the following years. Nevertheless, he remained an influential lord in the region: regent John Hunyadi concluded a peace with Jiskra in his estate of Rimaszombat in 1146. Among others, Hunyadi obliged the Czech mercenary to return Tapolcs√°ny Castle to Sz√©cs√©nyi. In 1451, John Hunyadi ordered to fortify his permanent seat Sz√©cs√©ny, which absorbed considerable amounts. Later life Sz√©cs√©nyi married Barbara Rozgonyi, a daughter of Judge royal George Rozgonyi. They had four children. Their only son John died in December 1454, leaving no heirs. Among their three daughters, Hedwig married Albert Losonci, while Anne was betrothed to John Orsz√°g, son of Palatine Michael Orsz√°g. Anne was still mentioned as a living person in 1484, when she married for the second time to John Pet≈ë de Gerse. Sz√©cs√©nyi's third daughter Catherine was mentioned only once in 1437. The wars with the Hussites brought Sz√©cs√©nyi financially difficult situation. He and his son John appeared before the Convention of Ipolys√°g (today ≈†ahy, Slovakia) on 27 October 1454, when they pledged a considerable part of the Sz√©cs√©nyi wealth (for instance, Holl√≥k≈ë, Sz√©cs√©ny, Gy√∂ngy√∂s and Pata) for sixteen thousand florins to his son-in-law Albert Losonci. His only son John predeceased him in December 1454. Still in that year, the mourning father made a declaration at Ipolys√°g, which contained if he dies without male heirs, his two surviving daughters, Hedwig and Anne will inherit his wealth after their promotion to the status of a nobleman's son. Following that Michael Orsz√°g betrothed his son to the still maiden Anne. On 27 April 1455, Ladislaus Sz√©cs√©nyi pledged his several lands to his relatives Michael Orsz√°g and Albert Losonci, who shared the Sz√©cs√©nyi property, after Sz√©cs√©nyi was unable to repay that large sums which he borrowed for years from them to finance the mercenaries against the Hussites. Three days later, on 30 April, he signed a heritage contract with his two living daughters at the Buda chapter, where he resigned from all jurisdictions. The charter did not contain that clause which would have made the contract binding for an unexisting male heir. King Ladislaus V granted the status of a son to Hedwig and Anne on 28 October 1456. Ladislaus Sz√©cs√©nyi died in 1460 as the last male member of the once powerful Sz√©cs√©nyi family, which flourished since the 1310s, founded by his great-great-grandfather, the influential baron Thomas Sz√©cs√©nyi. He was buried on 3 April 1460 in Sz√©cs√©ny. His funeral was attended by his extensive kinship, including Palatine Michael Orsz√°g, Judge royal Ladislaus P√°l√≥ci and Albert Losonci, Sz√©cs√©nyi's son-in- law and successor as isp√°n of N√≥gr√°d County. The wealth of the Sz√©cs√©nyi fortune was shared between the Orsz√°g and Losonci families in the following years.

It existed until 1959 when it was merged with the Admiralty Gunnery Establishment to form the Admiralty Surface Weapons Establishment (ASWE). Its headquarters were located in Haslemere, Surrey, England. History The Admiralty Signal and Radar Establishment began as the Admiralty Experimental Department that was set up in 1917 at HM Signal School, Portsmouth, to coordinate research work undertaken since 1896 on the Torpedo School ships HMS Defiance and HMS Vernon. Concern had already arisen in 1940 as regards the vulnerability of the Signal School to Luftwaffe bombing, but a raid in the autumn of 1940 brought matters to a head, and the move was initiated. In April 1941 the Experimental Department was renamed the Admiralty Signal Establishment (ASE) which, like its predecessors, was primarily focused on communications. Premises were found in Lythe Hill House, Haslemere, and in August 1941, the ASE became a separate establishment. Basil Willett was the Captain Superintendent. In July 1943 a delegation came from the USA to discuss radar and communications. The discussions included Henry Tizard, Cecil Horton, Cedric Holland and George Thomson. However, technological advances during the Second World War necessitated an increase in related fields of research, and in 1948 these were brought under one body, the Admiralty Signal and Radar Establishment at Portsmouth. In 1959 it was merged with the Admiralty Gunnery Establishment (AGE) to form the Admiralty Surface Weapons Establishment (ASWE).

He was born on November 10, 1928 in Warsaw, Poland. He and his younger sister fled from Poland to the Soviet Union on the eve of the outbreak of World War II. His father fell ill during his service in the Red Army, and died before the end of the war. His mother Fania handed him and his sister Elina (later Ilana) to a Christian orphanage, because she could not support them. A few months later, an emissary from Youth Aliyah arrived at the orphanage to take the Jewish children. This was the result of an agreement signed in 1942 between the Polish government-in-exile and the Soviet government, in which 120,000 Polish soldiers and refugees from the Soviet Union were allowed to transfer to British-controlled Tehran. Emil and Elina were among approximately 1,000 Jewish children who were taken by train to Tehran. The children, most of whom arrived with no parents, were housed in an orphanage set up for them. In 1943, Emmanuel and his sister immigrated to Mandatory Palestine among a group of Jewish children in Tehran. After spending a short time at the Youth Aliyah camp in Jerusalem, Emil and Elina moved to the kibbutz Ginegar. During his stay at the Kibbutz, Emmanuel was discovered to be a great talent and a leader. His love for agriculture led him to study at the Kadouri Agricultural School and upon graduating with honors he joined the Palmach and went to the training center in Ramat Yohanan. 1948 War At the beginning of March 1948 news reached about an Arab convoy loaded with weapons leaving from Beirut for Haifa, in order to transfer it to Arab militias in the city, which would give the Arabs of Haifa a great advantage in the battles against the forces of the Yishuv. There were three trucks loaded with two tons of explosives, 550 rifles, submachine guns, about 120,000 rounds, and 1,000 hand grenades. The first attempt to stop the convoy was carried out near Nahariya by the 21st Battalion of the Carmeli Brigade and failed. In the meantime, an additional force of 10 fighters from the First Battalion of the Palmach from the Ramat Yohanan was organized. The rapid action did not allow for orderly organization or obtaining permits. The squad commanded by Noam Pasmanik set up an ambush on the side of the main road north of Kiryat Motzkin. When the caravan arrived, it encountered a barrel checkpoint on the road. The men of the force stormed the convoy, Abraham Avigdorov took control of the two Bren machine guns in the convoy. Passmanik threw a grenade at the caravan and an explosive charge in one of the cars blew up and caused his death. In the explosion, the commander of the Arab force was also killed. As Landau jumped on one of the two remaining weapons trucks to retrieve the loot and transfer it to the Palmach, one of the bullets caused the explosives to explode in the truck, and as a result of the explosion, Emmanuel Landau was killed and Avigdor was seriously injured. The liquidation of the convoy caused a decline in morale among the Arabs in Haifa and an increase in the flight of Arab residents of the city, including members of the Arab Higher Committee. Landau and Avigdorov were awarded the Hero of Israel for their heroism during the battle. IDF's stated reason for awarding Landau: Emmanuel's younger sister, Ilana (Landau-Karniel), was the last remnant of the family. In his name he received the \\"Hero of Israel\\" medal in a ceremony held on July 17, 1949.

History Abraham's Well visitors center, Beersheba According to the Hebrew Bible, Abraham's well was seized by Abimelech's men (), and Isaac‚Äôs servants also dug a well at Beer-sheba (). The well is near the Old City of Beersheba and a wadi, Nahal Be'er Sheva, on the road to Eilat. It was described by Edward Robinson in 1838.Jerusalem Post, TODAY IN HISTORY: THE ‚ÄòFATHER OF BIBLICAL GEOGRAPHY‚Äô; BENJAMIN GLATT; January 27, 2016 In 1897, a local sheikh built a house above the well. Travellers' descriptions Edward Robinson's description of the site: \\"These wells are some distance apart; they are circular, and stoned up with solid masonry. The larger one is twelve and a half feet in diameter and forty-four and a half feet deep to the surface of the water, sixteen feet of which, at the bottom, is excavated in the solid rock. The other well lies fifty-five rods W.S.W., and is five feet in diameter and forty-two feet deep. The water in both is pure and sweet, and in great abundance; the finest, indeed, we had found since leaving Sinai... Here then is the place where the patriarchs Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob often dwelt! Here Abraham dug perhaps this very well; and journeyed from hence with Isaac to Mount Moriah, to offer him up there in sacrifice.\\" It was also described by Claude Reignier Conder in the late 19th century: \\"...the principal well, which is twelve feet three inches in diameter, and over forty-five feet deep, lined with rings of masonry to a depth of twenty- eight feet. A second well, five feet in diameter, exists about 300 yards to the west, and on the east is a third, which is dry, twenty-three feet deep, and nine feet two inches in diameter. The sides of all the wells are furrowed by the ropes of the water-drawers; but we made one discovery which was rather disappointing, namely, that the masonry is not very ancient. Fifteen courses down, on the south side of the large well, there is a stone with an inscription in Arabic, on a tablet dated, as well as I could make out, 505 A.H., or in the twelfth century. This stone must be at least as old as those at the mouth, which are furrowed with more than a hundred channels by the ropes of seven centuries of water-drawers.\\" See also *Archaeology of Israel *Tourism in Israel References  External sources  * Abrahams Well International Visitors Center Beersheba Archaeological sites in Israel 2013 establishments Museums in Israel Water wells in Israel Abraham Water and religion ","title":"Abraham's well"},{"id":"55074311","text":"Tadeusz ≈öliwak (20 November 1908 - 26 February 1991) was a Polish sprinter.

Despite past and ongoing attempts to take charge in energy sustainability (as with the now defunct Yasuni-ITT initiative), oil production and exportation still supports its small $5,853 GDP/capita economy at an average of 549,000 barrels/day in 2016. The push and pull between energy independence/nationalism and appeasement of conservationist groups (representing the concerns of environmentalists and indigenous groups) has been evident in the country‚Äôs shifting stance on renewable energies and fossil fuels. Currently, the state is in charge of all domestic activities regarding the refining and distribution of oil and oil products. The state-owned company, Petroecuador, oversees and executes all related operations. The country is also seeing the construction of a new heavy crude refinery compound, operated by Refinery of the Pacific Eloy Alfaro but funded and built by Pertroecuador. Despite Ecuador‚Äôs large oil production, its main source of electricity is hydropower -for the year 2015, 13,096 GWh of electricity came from hydropower facilities as opposed to oil‚Äôs 8,919 GWh. The Ecuadorian government has also passed legislation incentivizing the growth of renewable energy markets. ; one example of such policy is the feed-in tariff, which is a contract guaranteeing agents investing in renewable technology a competitive return on investment.  Refinery of the Pacific Eloy Alfaro  In 2016, oil made up 30% of Ecuador's total exports at a value $5.05 billion; it ranked as the 55th largest oil exporter in the world. Despite having three small refineries in the Esmeraldas, Shushufundi, and La Libertad sites operated by Petroecuador, the country lacks the ability to refine heavy crude. As such, Ecuador is a net importer of refined fuels, buying mainly from the United States. The Refinery of the Pacific Eloy Alfaro (RDP), a petrochemical company with a compound currently under development, would allow Ecuador to refine up to 300,000 barrels/day once fully operational. The company is owned by Petroecuador, Petroleos de Venezuela SA, and the China National Petroleum Corporation. The project is estimated to cost $12 billion and return $3 billion/year that would otherwise be spent on refined fuels. It is being constructed in El Aromo, in the coastal province of Manabi. Completion of the refinery would take place in two phases, the first yielding a processing capacity of 200,000 barrels/day and the second adding another 100,000 barrels/day. The necessary access roads and central camp were completed in 2014. In 2016, the company announced the completion of the La Esperanza Multipurpose Aqueduct, a prerequisite project that would supply the refinery with water necessary for its processes. Despite a current investment sum of $1.23 billion from Petroecuador, the venture has seen financing setback. On August 21, 2017, the minister of hydrocarbons, Carlos P√©rez Garc√≠a, announced that the government would not contribute any more funds towards the project and instead turn towards foreign investment. The project has become a point of contention with civilians, advocacy groups, and nationalist political groups due to its heavy reliance on Chinese capital and its contradiction of sumak kawsay, \\"good living\\" in Quechua. Sumak kawsay describes the state's harmony with its different ethnic cultures and natural environments.  Energy Sovereignty  Ecuador‚Äôs 20th constitution (established in 2008) mentions multiple forms of sovereignty, including energy sovereignty. Self-sufficiency is one of the pillars of energy sovereignty as discussed by former President Rafael Correa‚Äôs administration. The administration called for the following objectives: 1.) an increase in the capacity for extracting natural resources 2.) a decrease in the imports of processed fuels 3.) a shift in electricity generation towards hydropower facilities. Another pillar of energy sovereignty previously discussed by the administration is the defense of natural resources against international energy companies. The change in energy imports does not reflect the original proposal. Since 2008, Ecuador has more than doubled its imports of gasoline/diesel (1.494M tonnes/year to 3.175M tonnes/year) while less than halving its imports of fuel oil (531K tonnes/year to 286K tonnes/year). The contribution of hydropower to electricity, however, does meet the originally proposed plan. It has risen since 2008 (back then at 11,294 GWh), while the electricity generated from oil has decreased (from 5,554 GWh). Ecuador has also increased oil production and exportation. In July 2017, the country announced it would keep increasing exports, publicly breaking rank with OPEC. The organization had promised to lower overall barrel production as global oil prices plummeted.

They play in the Ethiopian Premier League, the top division of Ethiopian football.  History  Welwalo Adigrat University FC was promoted to the Ethiopian Premier League for the first time after the end of the 2016‚Äì17 season. Welwalo Adigrat is funded as part of Adigrat University, a public institution. The club began as the official football team of Adigrat University, called themselves Welwalo, and competing in gold and black colors. The Welwalo initially participated in Group A of the Higher league (also known as the Ethiopian Super League), the second tier of Ethiopian football, before being promoted to the Ethiopian Premier League after the 2016‚Äì17 season.  Ethiopian Premier League  After a slow start to the season falling to 10th place in the premier league, the team sacked their manager Berhane GebreEgziabher. Former Arba Minch manager Tsegaye Kidanemariam was hired in his place. In a match versus Fasil Kenema (K/Mariam's first match as manager), the Welwalo goalkeeper Zewedu Mesfin gained much attention for an infamous play in which he accidentally threw the ball into his own net. The own goal ended being the deciding factor in the match with Welwalo dropping all 3 points in 1‚Äì0 scoreline. On April 30th, 2018 the club was involved in an altercation during a game against Defense Force S.C. that ultimately led to a member of the Welwalo coaching staff physically attacking the referee. Although all involved avoided serious injury after altercation the incident prompted the Ethiopian Football Federation to suspend the entire league upon further review of the situation, calling for an emergency meeting for the following Thursday.  Grounds  Welwalo Adigrat University FC plays its home games at Adigrat Stadium in the city of Adigrat in the northern Tigray Region of Ethiopia. Notably the field they play on was grass-less during their inaugural 2017‚Äì18 Ethiopian Premier League season. In August of 2018, it was announced that Adigrat Stadium would undergo renovations which would install a new grass field as well as new seating in the stands.

Maldonado's body was found in October in the nearby Chubut River. The autopsy of the body indicated that Santiago's cause of death was \\"drowning by immersion in the water of the Chubut River, contributed by hypothermia\\", that it was a \\"traumatic death\\", that there were no signs of violence, and that the body had stayed underwater for at least 55 days. In November, a commission of 55 forensic experts asserted that Maldonado died by asphyxia and hypothermia, and that there were no evidence of blows or injuries to his body. Maldonado's family continue to believe he was a victim of a forced disappearance. The event Santiago Andr√©s Maldonado (born 25 July 1989) was a craftsman and tattoo artist from the town of Veinticinco de Mayo, province of Buenos Aires. A few months before his disappearance he had moved to El Bols√≥n, province of R√≠o Negro, about 70 kilometers north of a Mapuche settlement named Cushamen. Maldonado supported the aboriginal communities in their land claims, but, according to his family, he had never before been politically active because \\"he does not believe in politics\\". The event took place on July 31 and August 1, 2017, at the Chubut Province. The location was the Pu Lof de la Resistencia of Cushamen, a mapuche establishment built in territories seized from the Italian clothing company Benetton Group by Facundo Jones Huala. Huala, member of the Resistencia Ancestral Mapuche group, was jailed because of the violent protest activities including destruction of properties that undertook in several locations, and members of the Pu Lof organized a picketing protest at the National Route 40, advocating for his liberation. The people in the demonstration were hooded, and had completely blocked the road with trees, stones and fire, thus not allowing any transit through the road. The protest was carried out by eight people, Santiago Maldonado among them. Judge Guido Otranto instructed the Argentine National Gendarmerie to clear the blockade and disperse the protesters, who escaped. The judge had also instructed them to use minimal violence, and film the operation on video. The protesters tried to block the road again some hours later, on August 1. The protesters reacted violently to the Gendarmerie this time, and attacked them with stones. Commander Juan Pablo Escola reported that two gendarmes were gravely injured in their faces during the attack. He sent a group of 30 gendarmes to the Pu Lof. Although he did not have a judicial warrant to do so, he considered that the attack could be considered as in flagrante delicto, which would have allowed to skip that requirement. Some protesters attempted to escape by swimming across the Chubut River, and others tried to hide in a forest next to the river. Maldonado could not cross the river because he could not swim. The whereabouts of Santiago Maldonado were unknown after that point. Judicial case A judicial case, led by a judge and three prosecutors, tries to determine the whereabouts of Maldonado. The national government and the provincial government of Chubut asked to be complainants in the case. The Inter-American Commission on Human Rights suggested that, in case of doubt about a case being a forced disappearance or not, it should be investigated as if it was. In line with this suggestion, the Gendarmerie was removed from taking an active role in the investigation. The United Nations Committee on Enforced Disappearances has requested to oversee the investigation, which was accepted by Argentina. As a result, both the judiciary and the Argentine government will have to keep the organization updated about every progress of the investigation. The case was initially investigated as a search and rescue, and was later rebranded as a forced disappearance. However, the change was made without any new evidence that may suggest an involvement of the Gendarmeria. A group of twenty mapuches occupied the court on September 20, asking for the removal of judge Otranto. The Maldonado family and the (CELS) accused the judge Otranto of not being an impartial jury. The federal chamber of appeals of Comodoro Rivadavia recused him from the case, but clarified in the sentence that they found no reason to doubt his intellectual honesty and respect to the procedures. He was recused instead because of an interview with the newspaper La Naci√≥n, where he made an extrajudicial commentary about the accuracy of the theories, before formally closing the case. Otranto was then replaced by judge Gustavo Llerald. The Maldonado family celebrated the removal of Otranto, but complained that their specific request had been rejected. Otranto is still in charge of the case over the road block that started the case. On 21 October 2017, after a 12-hour autopsy involving 52 experts, including those appointed by Maldonado's family, Judge Gustavo Lleral confirmed that Maldonado's body did not have any signs of violence and the cause of death was established as death by drowning. On November 24, 2017 the verdict of the 55 experts confirmed that Maldonado drowned and that there were no signs of violence on his body. How, when and why he died is still on investigation. The prosecutor Silvina Avila asked in December 2017 to change the folder of the case from forced disappearance to suspicious death, on the grounds that the investigation did not reveal any clue that may support the forced disappearance hypothesis. There was a similar request from the Ministry of Security in May 2018. The judge Lleral rejected both requests. He pointed that the folder of the case is inconsequential, that changing it before the case was closed would be an improper advance of opinion, and that the case is not guided by the folder's name but by the results of the investigations. There are no specific members of the gendarmerie formally accused of wrongdoing or called for inquiry, which turns it into a moot point. International cases On August 7, 2017, the UN Committee on Enforced Disappearances expressed its \\"concern about the physical and psychological integrity\\" of Maldonado and requested the Argentine state to adopt \\"a comprehensive search strategy\\", taking \\"all the urgent measures that are necessary to search for him and find him, taking into account the information provided by the members of the Pu Lof Mapuche community that were present at the moment of the repression\\". The UN committee also requested that the Gendarmerie does not participate in the search and investigation of the disappearance and that the Argentine government protects all the evidence that may help to identify those responsible for the disappearance. The same day, the Minister of Security offered a reward to those who \\"while not having participated in the crime, offer useful information that can help find the whereabouts\\" of Maldonado. On August 23, the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights (IACHR), of the Organization of American States, also took a precautionary measure asking the Argentine state to \\"adopt all the necessary measures to determine the situation and whereabouts of Mr. Santiago Maldonado\\" and to \\"inform about all the measures that have been adopted to investigate the facts\\". On October 6, the UN Committee on Enforced Disappearances published a document addressed to the Argentine national government in which the former expresses its concern about the lack of progress in the clarification of what happened to Santiago Maldonado. The UN demanded the Macri administration to set as a priority the clarification of the role of the Gendarmerie and to keep this force away from the investigation. It also accused the authorities of quickly rejecting the hypothesis according to which the Gendarmerie is the perpetrator of the enforced disappearance of Maldonado. The Committee expressed its concern regarding the lack of partiality of judge Guido Otranto. It finally pointed out that there are officials of the Macri administration that continue to stigmatize the members of the Pu Lof by portraying them as a threat to national security, when the government should be instead offering protection to the Mapuche community. The UN and the IACHR closed those cases in January 2018, a pair of months after Maldonado was found. Drowned Maldonado escaped from the Gendarmerie by trying to cross the Chubut River. A new search revealed a corpse in the river on October 17. There were no reports of other deaths or missing people in the area, and it was confirmed that it was a male, with light blue clothes as those that witnesses reported that Maldonado was wearing. The corpse was found 300 meters upstream from the area of the events. Newspaper Clarin said that the hypothesis of the government was that the presence of many aquatic plants and strong flows could make it difficult to find the corpse. The autopsy conducted on 21 October 2017 confirmed forensic evidence clearly pointed to drowning and hypotermia as the cause of death The autopsy, witnessed by 52 experts including that of the Maldonado family and international organizations, revealed no evidence of injuries. The corpse was acknowledged to be Maldonado's by the 52 experts witnessing the autopsy. On November 29, 2018 Judge Lleral closed the case citing no further evidence pointing towards anything different to an accidental drowning. Maldonado's legal plans Despite of the recovery of the body, and the results of the autopsy, the defense of the Maldonado family insists that the case was a forced disappearance. They consider that he had been taken and killed by the gendarmerie elsewhere, and then his body was planted into the crime scene. They say that the body presents signs of cryopreservation, although the autopsy does not reveal such signs. This theory does not provide an explanation to the absence of any signs of manipulation of the body, or the way the gendarmerie could have sneaked into a location closely watched by the mapuches. The Maldonado family requested a deeper autopsy study, and a new autopsy by independent people. The judge rejected both requests. He considered that the results of the autopsy were clear enough, and that an autopsy by outside people would go against the sovereignty of the judicial power. The defense asked for big number of investigations, that the judge systematically rejects as extemporaneous, pointless or impossible to perform. Those rejected investigations would be cited in later judicial stages, and even in a potential international case once all the local judicial venues are done, to argue an obstruction of justice.  Former hypothesis   Forced disappearance  According to witnesses, after the Argentine National Gendarmerie had an encounter with the Lof, agents from this security force carried somebody to a truck. Later those witnesses admitted to lying to the court and are facing perjury charges. The Gendarmerie denies having detained Maldonado, so does the minister of security, Patricia Bullrich. The witnesses made public comments, but refused to testify in court. They proposed to testify while concealing their identities with hoods, which was rejected by the judiciary. Other witnesses told before justice that Maldonado was taken by Gendarmerie agents. Eighty biological samples were retrieved from the vehicles used by the Gendarmerie during the operation, and used for a DNA test. Another fourteen samples were ignored, as they were unsuitable for testing. The results were released a month later: none of them matched the DNA of Maldonado. The value of this evidence has been disputed by public defender Fernando Machado, who argued that the samples would have been taken after the trucks had been washed. The judge dismissed those concerns. The prosecutor Silvina Avila made a report that established that there are no solid evidences that link the Gendarmerie with Maldonado. As of September 17, the judge does not consider the theory of a forced disappearance to be likely. Audio files were taken from WhatsApp conversations held by those involved in the operation on the day. One of the files, sent by a member of the gendarmeria, states that a sergeant had \\"Maldonado in a truck\\". A more detailed analysis revealed that the comment was made on August 16, only as part of a private joke between members of the Gendarmerie while Bullrich explained the case to the Congress. All 70 cell phones of the gendarmes were investigated, and none of them had been used to discuss an actual forced disappearance operation. Ariel Garzi, a fellow craftsman from El Bols√≥n, called Santiago Maldonado's cellphone on August 2. The call was answered by an unknown person. It lasted 22 seconds, during which Garzi heard the sound of steps. Ariel Garbanz, an engineer from the Communications Security Lab of the National Technological University, investigated the call and claims to know the location where the phone was answered. Judge Otranto refused to look at this evidence. Received a mortal wound Maldonado could have received a mortal wound during the escape, which would have caused his death at some later point. Hiding A theory considered that Maldonado was still alive, hiding in Mapuche territory. A search with search and rescue dogs conducted on August 16 suggested that he would have been in the area in the previous 24 hours. The government also considered that Maldonado may have never been in the protest to begin with. As all people in the protest were hooded, it was not possible to properly recognize him in photos or filmings of the event. The Maldonado family reported that he was a quiet and peaceful man, which would make it unlikely that he would take part in a violent protest in a road. The mapuches Beatriz Garay Neri, Soraya Noem√≠ Guitart and Nicol√°s Jones Huala reported that they talked with him on August 1, in the morning, but did not provide further details about his presence or the topics of discussion. They did not report his absence either, and ignored his full name. Murder Santiago Maldonado used his cell phone for the last time on July 21, 2017. That day, four or five hooded members of the Resistencia Ancestral Mapuche invaded the small house of Evaristo Jones, a worker for the Benetton family. Jones reported that he tried to defend himself by stabbing one of those people with a knife. As there are no cases of knife injuries treated in nearby hospitals on that day, or info about Maldonado's activities in the immediate days prior to the August 1 protest, it is suspected that he may be the stabbed thief, and that he had bled to death days before the protest. The family of Maldonado tried to refute this theory by providing a video of another picketing protest of the RAM that took place on July 31, which would have been attended by Maldonado. They also provide testimonials from numerous people who saw Santiago after the supposed attack. In addition, Evaristo Jones, the attacked worker, denied having hurt any of the attackers. The Maldonado family also affirms that they had telephone conversations with Santiago on July 25 (his birthday) and on July 27. Through DNA tests it was proved that Santiago Maldonado was not injured in said episode. Reactions A demonstration in Buenos Aires Kirchnerism and human rights organizations exploited the case to advance a political discourse against Macri. Treating the case like a forced disappearance allowed to draw comparisons between his government and the Dirty War that took place during the National Reorganization Process, in the 1970s. According to this narrative, Macri would have a covert plan to kidnap and kill demonstrators, the gendarmerie, the judiciary and the media would be working alongside Macri in such a plan, and Maldonado would be just the first victim of it.Novaro, p. 16 Human rights organizations had aligned themselves with the Kirchners during the government of both N√©stor and Cristina Fern√°ndez de Kirchner, even in topics unrelated to human rights, and often worked as their spokesmen. They kept this role since 2015, when Macri defeated Cristina Kirchner in the presidential elections.Novaro, pp. 16-19 This, however, undermined their legitimacy in the Argentine society, as an increasingly portion of the population loses interest in the events of the 1970s, and their public image got tied to that of Cristina Kirchner.Novaro, p. 21 The disappearance of Maldonado has also mobilized international human rights organizations, such as Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch. In Buenos Aires, La Plata, Bariloche, Mar del Plata, Bah√≠a Blanca, General Madariaga, Mendoza, Malarg√ºe, El Bols√≥n, Rawson, Viedma, Gualeguaych√∫, Rosario and Neuquen thousands of people marched in demonstrations demanding that Maldonado appears alive and the resignation of Bullrich. People also marched to demand that Santiago Maldonado is brought back alive in Bogot√° (Colombia), Asunci√≥n (Paraguay), Montevideo (Uruguay), Canelones and Fray Bentos (Uruguay). In Spain, several Argentine residents marched to Pla√ßa de Catalunya to ask for Santiago Maldonado. On August 11, there was a large mass demonstration in Plaza de Mayo, Buenos Aires. On August 21, during the 49th ordinary session of PARLASUR, in Montevideo, Argentine representatives condemned the disappearance of Santiago Maldonado. The disappearance of Maldonado took place shortly before the 2017 midterm elections. Cristina Fern√°ndez de Kirchner, leader of one of the opposition parties, mentioned the case repeatedly during her rallies. Kirchner and several Kirchnerite politicians used it to draw controversial comparisons between the presidency of Mauricio Macri and the 1970s Dirty War. However, political analysts consider that the case is unlikely to affect the election results, and that the aggressive rhetoric of Kirchner may actually scare independent voters and increase the chances of the Cambiemos official coalition. the corpse of Maldonado was found a few days before the elections. By the time of voting, the Maldonado family had confirmed his identity and the initial autopsy revealed no signs of violence against the body; the official results of the full autopsy would be released a pair of weeks later. August 30 is the International Day of the Disappeared, and several teachers affiliated to the CTERA union mentioned the event during school classes. This action was rejected by groups of parents because it described the involvement of the Gendarmerie as a confirmed fact, and it was considered a case of political indoctrination. The Macri administration first negated the disappearance of Maldonado. As the days went by, members of Mr. Macri's cabinet send contradictory messages. Demonstrators in Uruguay ask for the whereabouts of Santiago Maldonado On September 1, 2017, a month after Santiago Maldonado's disappearance, thousands of people expressed themselves through rallies and demonstrations asking for his appearance alive. The largest demonstration took place in Plaza de Mayo and was organized by Grandmothers of the Plaza de Mayo, Mothers of the Plaza de Mayo (L√≠nea Fundadora), Relatives of the Disappeared and Imprisoned for Political Reasons, HIJOS, the Center for Legal and Social Studies (CELS), the Argentine League for the Rights of Man, and the Permanent Assembly for Human Rights, among other organizations. In other cities, such as Mendoza, Mar del Plata, San Luis, San Juan, Neuqu√©n, Salta, Posadas, Jujuy, Santiago del Estero, Villaguay, Concepci√≥n del Uruguay, Gualeguaych√∫ and Concordia there were rallies and demonstrations with the same demand. In Rosario and C√≥rdoba there were rallies with an attendance of 40000 each. There were also protests in Spain, Brazil, France, Uruguay, Chile, Mexico, Austria and the United States which were organized through social media. In London, S√£o Paulo, Berlin, Montevideo, Rio de Janeiro, Madrid, Barcelona, Sidney, Santiago, Mexico City, Vienna, Washington DC and New York City, groups of people expressed their solidarity with the demand for the appearance of Santiago Maldonado alive.

The Greeks used architecture, pottery, and funerary objects as different mediums through which to portray death. These depictions include mythical deaths, deaths of historical figures, and commemorations of those who died in war. This page includes various examples of the different types of mediums in which death is presented in Greek art.  Examples of architecture  Greek heroa were tombs dedicated to both mythological and actual heroes of the Ancient Greek world. These tombs contained the remains of the hero and acted as a place where citizens of the polis where the tomb was located could hold feasts as a hero cult in order to honor the hero. They were built in a variety of different styles, were located in many different polis across Greece, and their legacy was continued by the Romans. The heroon at Nemea is an example of a hero shrine, the resting place of the late Ophletes and a place for Greeks to worship. The heroon was a way to memorialize the infant and transform his legacy from that of a mere mortal to that of a hero. Ophletes' death elevated him above the status of other humans and made him more divine, and thus his final resting place became a sacred space to Greeks. The ancient Greeks would use this space and the surrounding land to host the Nemean Games in Ophletes' honor, as well as practice magic and other cult activities. The grave monument from Kallithea is an example of a funerary monument from the Hellenistic period. They were for wealthy people and families that served to remind the living of the power and wealth of the dead by exhibiting conspicuous consumption. This monument was for a non Greek family from Romania, who became prominent in Athens in the 300s. The grave monument had a podium, pedestal, a frieze, and a naiskos with statues of two family members and a slave inside. These grave monument largely disappeared in Attica after an austerity law that banned them. The tombs at Xanthos, Lycia, are funerary architecture that display the cultural synthesis enacted by a Lycian Dynasty. The tombs at Xanthos primarily take the form of pillar tombs, which were composed of a stone burial chamber on top of a stone pillar. The decorative motifs surrounding many of the elevated burial chambers depicts Near Eastern imagery, with roots in Persia. However, the Lycian rulers employed Greek artisans to carve the relief sculptures, primarily in the Archaic style. Thus, the monumentalization of the dead rulers is accompanied by regionally-specific visual motifs that bring together both Greek and Near Eastern influences. Brasidas was a successful Spartan General who won a major battle in Amphipolis during the second Peloponnesian War. After Brasidas died, the people of Amphipolis monumentalized him by cremating him, placing his ashes in a silver ossuary with a gold wreath, and burying him in a cist grave within the city walls. Sparta also dedicated a cenotaph in his honor. His legacy was remembered and celebrated with these things and contributes to the theme of monumentalization of important Greek figures after death.  Examples of pottery and painters  The Pelike of Odysseus and Elpenor is a jar from Attika in 440 B.C. It portrays Elpenor begging Odysseus to give him a proper burial. Elpenor had drunkenly fallen off the roof of a boat and his death went unnoticed which means he did not get his burial rights and could not proceed through his journey in the underworld. Hermes stands next to Odysseus watching over the scene as he a guide for the dead. The Thanatos Painter is a lekythoi painter from Athens, Greece in the 5th century BCE. The lekythoi attributed to the Thanatos Painter are all white-ground that is specifically used in the funerary context. These lekythoi also had depiction of death on them and thanatos is the Greek word for death. They were used as grave markers and would hold special oil used for funerals. Another example of pottery being used in funerary contexts is the Eleusis Amphora by the Polyphemos painter, which is a neck amphora that dates back to the Middle Protoattic (ca. 650-625 B.C.E.). The amphora's decoration reflects the pottery of the Orientalizing period (ca. 710-600 B.C.E.), a style in which human and animal figures depict mythological scenes. It was used as an urn, as it was found to contain the remains of a young boy. Ancient Greek funerary vases were made to resemble vessels used for elite male drinking parties, called symposiums. Funerary vases were often painted with symposiums, or Greek tragedies that involved death. There are many types of funerary vases including amphorae, kraters, oinochoe, and kylix cups. Funerary scenes show us how the Greeks treated the deceased. Such ritualistic practices included laying out the body for mourners to see, called prothesis. An example of this was painted on the Dipylon amphora. Next, was the ekphora, which is the moving of the body to a cemetery, usually in a procession. If cremation was practiced, then the ashes of the deceased would be placed inside the funerary vase, and buried. The Odysseus in the Underworld krater is a Lucanian kalyx-krater decorated in the red-figure style dating to dating to ca. 380 BC - ca. 360 BC. Side A of the krater depicts Homer's story of Odysseus's visit to the Underworld to consult the dead seer Teiresias. This meeting is known as a nekuomanteion or ‚Äúconsultation with the dead‚Äù. Side B depicts the judgment of Paris where Hermes asks Paris, the Trojan prince, to arbitrate the contest between Aphrodite, Hera, and Athena and determine who is the most beautiful. The suicide of Ajax vase was made by Exekias during the Archaic Period. The scene depicts Ajax preparing for his suicide in black-figure on a neck amphora. Ajax is bent over his sword, which he is placing in the ground. There is a tree to one side of him and his suit of armor on the other side. This scene is unusual in Greek art because it depicts the moment right before the death, rather than the violence of the actual death. The Dipylon krater from Athens displays representations of funerary rituals for death and burial. The prothesis was a public \\"laying out\\" of the deceased similar to a modern wake, and the ekphora was a transportation of the body to the grave for burial. These rituals coincided with intense grief and extravagance, as those closest to the deceased attempted to mourn and celebrate his death. Depictions of the death of Iphigenia are mostly on pottery. She was a young girl who was to be the sacrifice for Agamemnon's mistake. Pottery depictions of this mythological story are of two different versions. One where she dies, and the other is where her body is replaced with the corpse of an animal by Artemis, who saves her. The pottery depictions are mostly by the black-figure and red-figure techniques. They are also mostly amphoras and kraters. In my page, I wanted to include depictions of Iphigenia from all artistic aspects, not only pottery. Mosaic and plays have been made for Iphigenia. Death Mask from Mycenae  Examples of grave stelai and goods  The stelai which mark the burials in Grave Circles A and B in Mycenae demonstrate burial practices during the Late Bronze Age. Some of the stelai feature relief sculpture, including chariot scenes, hunting scenes, and spiral motifs. These scenes could potentially indicate a desire for display and conspicuous consumption and hint at the presence of warfare and social stratification at Mycenae. The death masks of Mycenae are a collection of golden masks placed on male dead bodies entombed within circular grave sites located at the city of Mycenae. They are designed to represent the features of the deceased, immortalizing them after death. They also display the status of the deceased through conspicuous consumption, due to their valuable materials. After finding a phenomenal amount of gold grave goods at Grave Circles A and B at Mycenae, the location earned the nickname \\"Golden Mycenae\\". It was a successful and wealthy area during the Bronze Age and the families buried in the shaft graves there memorialized their status using gold grave goods. They also distinguished which graves were for men and which were for women using grave goods. Generally, the men were buried with gold inlaid weapons while the women had gold jewelry, and both boasted their family's wealth. The hellenistic stelai from Demetrias used art styles and sculpting techniques from the Hellenistic period to commemorate the deceased. Marble and stone stele were decorated with full and diverse colors which were used to depict both scenes from life and scenes from myth. By looking at grave stele such as \\"Aphrodeisia, Daughter of Theudotos,\\" we can learn what life and art for Greeks during the hellenistic period was like.

Depictions of boxing and bull-leaping can be found back to the Bronze Age. Buildings were created for the sole use of athletics including stadions, palaestra, and gymnasiums. Starting in the Archaic Period, Panhellenic Games, including the Olympic Games, begin taking place each year. These games gave people from all over Greece the chance to gain fame for their athletic prowess. Athletics in Greece became one of the most commonly depicted scenes of everyday life in their art.  Architecture relating to athletics  As the site of the Olympic Games, the architecture of Olympia is heavily influenced by the theme of athletics. The temple of Zeus, for example, is decorated with a frieze containing the 12 labors of Heracles, who is believed to be the founder of the Olympic Games, and a pediment depicting the myth of Pelops, another origin tale of the Olympics. Birth of the Olympic Games in the Stadium at Olympia The main site of where the Olympic Games took place was the Stadium at Olympia which is located to the east of the sanctuary of Zeus. The physical landmarks of the Stadium are 212.54 meters long and 30‚Äì34 meters wide, and it served mainly for running races that determined the fastest person in the world. The track was made of hard-packed clay to serve as traction for the people competing in the running events. The site of Nemea showcase both the practical and ceremonial use of athletic architecture in the early Hellenistic monumentalization of Panhellenic sanctuaries. The bath house Nemean Baths contains a western room with basin baths and an eastern plunge bath. The western basin room is common of 4th century baths throughout Greece and was likely place where visiting athletes could wash themselves during their stay. The eastern plunge bath however, is one of only 4 others in Greece, all of which have been found at Panhellenic ritual sites. Though its exact function is unknown, its public nature suggests that it may have had a ritual component in the athletic games or ceremonies. Nemea also housed a stadium, where athletes would participate in games, specifically the stadion (running event).  Depictions of games  During the Bronze Age, the Minoans practiced several sports, including wrestling, bull jumping, acrobatics, and boxing. This is apparent in multiple pieces of art, ranging from frescoes to pottery. The youth of the boys in the Akrotiri Boxer Fresco hints that athletes began training very early on in life, suggesting that sports were extremely important to Minoan society. It has even been suggested that athletics played a religious role in society due to their widespread practice. Finally, the youth of athletes in many pieces of artwork indicates that athletic competition may have been a rite if passage into adulthood for the Minoans. One of the most popular and famous combat sports in Ancient Greece was boxing. Boxing in Ancient Greece was far less regulated than modern boxing, with opponents chosen at random, regardless of weight or age, and matches lasting until one of the competitors admitted defeat or was left unconscious. Fighters were often left disfigured; for example, one boxing injury commonly depicted was the cauliflower ear, which was depicted notably in the Boxer Stele from Kerameikos. Many who participated in these ancient boxing matches were gravely injured or even killed. Despite this, boxing was highly popular among the Ancient Grecian population and therefore was frequently featured on works of art. Another notable depiction of an ancient boxer is Boxer at Rest, also known as Terme Boxer, who has just finished a match. For example, the kothon, black-figure tripod by the Boeotian Dancer's Group features two men engaged in a boxing match on one of its legs. Athletic events, particularly Panhellenic festivals, brought drew both athletes and spectators. Occurrences of athletic competitions were first recorded by Homer in the Iliad. As a result, competitions had ties with war and military training. Depictions of athletic events in ancient art sometimes show the athletes wearing armor in order to illustrate the connection between athletes and warriors. Depictions of athletic events were also portrayed on pieces of pottery used in everyday life. Artists like Onesimos and the Foundry Painter depicted events such as pancration scenes and wrestling matches on kylixes which were then used at symposiums or male drinking parties. Both of these painters used the red-figure technique, developed in Athens in 530 B.C., in their work and this technique allowed them to have greater freedom to express movement, emotion, and anatomy. The depictions of Athletic events in Art expanded as major athletic events also expanded. In 708 BCE, the pentathlon was added to the Olympic games. Since this event required the skills for five different events (discus, javelin, long jump, running, and wrestling) these athletes were held in high regard among society. It became common to have a kylix or an amphora depict these events, and in turn, it praised the athletes by leaving their legacy in the art. The Kleophrades terracotta Panathenaic prize amphora (ca. 500 BCE) provides an example of recognition for success in athletic endeavors. At the Panathenaic Games, victors would be awarded a prize amphora filled with a luxury good like olive oil. The amphora itself would depict Athena Promachos, or Athena as a military leader directing troops into battle, and the athletic event in which the victor competed. Recognition for athletic endeavors and success by depicting the event itself as this Panathenaic prize amphora does highlights just how important athleticism was to the Ancient Greeks. Another example of the many Panathenaic Prize Amphoras is the Euphiletos Painter Panathenaic Amphora (530 BC). Painted in black figure, this Panathenaic amphora depicts a stadion from Panathenaic games. Like other prize amphora, this amphora serves to emphasize athleticism and the victors of these events. Panthenaic Amphora By Kleophrades Painter Descriptions of women‚Äôs sport during Archaic Period mainly come from literary sources, and there are a few examples of female sporting events. One of the most popular forms of physical activity for ancient Greek women is running. The bronze statuettes of athletic Spartan girl, which depicts Spartan young women involving in racing games, provide material evidence to the accounts of different women‚Äôs races in ancient Greece.  Athletic dedications  The prominence of athletic subject material in Greek art is no coincidence. Even statuary, called Athletic Dedications, arose as a way to immortalize Greek athletes and athletic games. Athletic events and art were so closely related that a common practice of athletes was to commemorate their victories with artistic dedications. One example of this would be the marble Apobates Base which commemorates victory in a chariot race at the Panathenaic Games. A competitor would erect a dedication to celebrate an athletic victory and place it in a sanctuary or Panhellenic site. These dedications were an artistic celebration of athletic prowess which every Greek could observe. Apobates Base As part of the games taking place at Olympia, many individuals competed in the pentathlon, a competition consisting of five events. The Ancient Olympic Pentathlon consisted of the discus throw, long jumps with weights attached to their feet, javelin throw, running, and wrestling. Many victors of the pentathlon would go on to receive prizes such as exclusive items that were made specifically for the victor. For example, the amphorae of the Panathenaic Games, often filled with expensive olive oil, featured Athena standing with a sword and shield to represent their victory in the games. Because the Olympics were dedicated to Zeus, often these prizes would become votive dedications to him. The Bronze Diskos Thrower (Discobolus) was a rare commodity that came from a time in which not many pieces survived: the end of the Persian Wars. The piece itself still exhibits many traits of archaic art, despite coming from the early Classical period (480 - 460 BCE). The athlete in the statue was a participant of diskos throwing, a very popular event in Ancient Greece and even modern day Olympics.  References  Ancient Greek athletic art Sport in antiquity Ancient Greek ","title":"Sport in ancient Greek art"},{"id":"55074801","text":"Warfare was a common occurrence in Greece from the Neolithic Period through its conquest by Alexander the Great and until its conquest by the Roman Empire. Because of this, warfare was a typical theme in many pieces of ancient Greek art. Many works of art, like the Doryphoros or the chryselephantine statue of Athena Parthenos, used military objects in their composition, and many others, like the Chigi vase, had warfare as their main subject. Ancient Greek art is an important aspect of not just the history of art, but the history of warfare as well, due to its frequent spot on many works of ancient Greek art. As each different period in Greek history occurred, more and more types of art formed, as well as differing depictions of warfare.  Bronze Age  In Minoan art, warfare is not explicitly shown, but rather different interpretations were made that could tie into warfare. For example, bull- leaping was an activity Minoan men did and the struggle between man and bull could be a depiction of warfare.  Archaic period  The Arezzo 1465 Vase During the Archaic Period, depictions of warfare in Greek art held importance in status markings, and also provide insight as to the trading markets during this era. For example, the Arezzo 1465 vase, an Attic volute krater attributed to Euphronios in the Late Archaic Era, depicts an amazonomachy, and was found in the Etruria region, indicating the expanse of the trade networks. Warfare as a status symbol further solidifies a reasoning behind this trade, since any art with warfare depictions on it thereby becomes a sort of luxury item sought after by those wishing to elevate their own status because aspects and physical areas of Greek society tended to extol military prestige and virtue. Proving oneself in battle distinguished one from the others and brought glory (kl√®os) to their families; consequently owning any art depicting warfare displayed one's wealth and elite status. Hoplite Warfare on the Chigi vase During the Archaic period many artists began to depict the hoplite formation in art. Representations of the hoplite phalanx give historians a look into how the Greeks used this style of warfare in battle. Hoplites can be identified by their spear and their shield as well as their position next to other soldiers. One of the most popular representations of the hoplite phalanx is in the Chigi vase. The hoplite formation is portrayed on many different types of pottery such as the Dinos, the Krater, and the Alabastron; and it many different styles such as black figure and white ground. During the Archaic period there are pieces of artwork that depict the aulos player. One of the most prominent pieces show how the aulos player helped keep the hoplite soldiers in step by playing them into battle. With the help of the aulete, they were able to keep their shields close together to prevent the opposing phalanx from penetrating their ranks.Hurwit, Jeffrey M. ‚ÄúReading the Chigi Vase.‚Äù Hesperia: The Journal of the American School of Classical Studies at Athens, vol. 71, no. 1, 2002, pp. 1‚Äì22.

Classical period  Calyx-Krater by the Painter of the Berlin Hydra The Classical Period involved many scenes relating and alluding to the Persian wars.≈ûAHƒ∞N, Reyhan. 2017. \\"Representations of Mythological War Scenes n Attic Figure Pottery and Approaches in Research.\\" Social Sciences Review Of The Faculty Of Sciences & Letters University Of Uludag / Fen Edebiyat Fak√ºltesi Sosyal Bilimler Dergisi 19, no. 32: 259-285. Academic Search Complete, EBSCO host (accessed November 28, 2017). This allusion can include some of the numerous depictions of mythical battle scenes such as amazonomachies, gigantomachies, and centauromachies during the period. Such themes and mythological scenes can be seen in depictions like the one on the Calyx-Krater by the painter of the Berlin Hydria depicting an Amazonomachy, or the Gigantomachy by the Suessula Painter. The first quarter of the Classical Period involved a lot of warfare, including the Persian Wars. Many Greek cities were sacked by the Persians during the second Persian War, taking a toll on several city-states. Themistoclean Walls were built quickly following the Greek victory of the Second Persian Wars, using destroyed sculptures and buildings to construct them. These re-purposed stones used in the building of Themistoclean walls is known as spolia. The Classical Period was also a time of Athenian control over Greece, powerwise, but also military wise and Athenian pottery was the most popular and well-spread over Greece. Hellenistic tower from Achinos, Phthiotis  Hellenistic Period  Aside from a build up of architecture, other aspects of Greek culture, such as grave markers, were also becoming monumental. A majority of sculpture during this period was more grand and celebrated triumph and the power of the Greeks as a whole community or civilization. Additionally, military monuments dedicated to the gods continued to remain prominent in Hellenistic culture. One such monument is the Neorion at Samothrace, a monumentalized ship dedication within the Sanctuary of the Great Gods at the Greek island of Samothrace. Such architectural monuments demonstrate the continued importance of religiosity in art regarding warfare, even in a sanctuary concerned with larger mystery cults unrelated to war. This is a continued theme reflected in threads from the depiction of myth in the Archaic and Classical Periods, to the bull-leaping of the Minoans in the Bronze Age, which is considered potentially both religious and militaristic in nature. Alexander the Great rose to prominence by winning the war which saw the end of the Persian Empire. Paintings and sculptures depicting battles and participants in the war were common in this period.

She was the first destroyer designed or built by the Kriegsmarine to use diesel fuel, which would have given it a longer range and readier access to refueling compared to fuel oil. Z51 was ordered on 25 November 1942, and launched on 2 October 1944, far before being finished, likely to clear her slipway for U-boat construction. She was left floating outside Bremen and was sunk in an air raid on 21 March 1945. She was broken up between 1948 and 1949. Development The Type 1942 destroyer class marked a major change from previous destroyer concepts produced by the Kriegsmarine, as it was the first design to be given diesel propulsion. This was done because of the longer endurance offered by diesel, and likely also because diesel fuel was more readily obtainable for Nazi Germany. Between 1928 and 1935, MAN Augsburg built a light, double acting, two-stroke diesel motor, which met German navy specifications. The motors were then tested on the German cruiser Leipzig and the training ship Bremse. The motors encountered initial problems with teething, which although swiftly overcome, allowed those supportive of steam engines to deny diesel propulsion any research in the critical building period from 1935 on. It was not until 1938 that the Kriegsmarine had a renewed interest in diesel propulsion. However the advent of World War II largely led to the suspension of research, except for the Type 1942 destroyer class, which was to use six MAN type 12Z32/34 engines. Diesel engines Six MAN type 12Z32/34 engines were ordered in 1943, but only four were completed by the end of the war in 1945. Test work on the engines was abandoned in February 1945, due to lack of fuel. The type 12Z32/34 engine was 24-cylinder, placed in a 2 √ó 12 configuration, had a bore, a stroke motor, and was a 'V' form, fast-running, double-acting, two-stroke, diesel engine made of welded steel. It had a maximum of 600 revs per minute, a piston speed of , maximum output of , medium effective pressure of , and a maximum fuel demand of . It had a dry weight of , including auxiliary machinery, but not the oil cooler. The six engines combined would give the Type 1942 destroyer class a range to match the pocket battleships and U-boats. Subdesigns The Type 1942 design was expanded to three subdesigns as it was developed: 'A', 'B', and 'C'. The original plan had a six-diesel engine, three-shaft configuration, with an armament of four guns. The design attracted much criticism, thus a new sketch was drawn, 'A', with a twin 12.7cm turret on the fore and aft, with a single 12.7cm turret superfiring over both. This design also drew criticism. By December 1943, the F√ºhrer der Zerst√∂rer (FdZ) demanded that the fore single superfiring turret be removed, in order to reduce length, improve speed, and reduce bow weight. They also mandated that the aft single 12.7cm guns be able to elevate up to 75¬∞. However, on 22 January 1944, after a meeting between the FdZ and Naval Group North, the FdZ dropped their demand for the fore single turret to be removed, after being informed that the speed loss due to it was marginal. At the same conference, the new 12.7 cm KM/41 naval gun was also discussed, as it was the best quick- firing gun design of the time. It was pointed out that the 12.7cm KM/41 had a severe lack of anti-aircraft abilities, due to the fact that none of the mountings were tri-axial, and indeed, only the single turret guns were even bi-axial. Additionally, the twin turrets could only elevate to 52¬∞, and the single turrets only to 75¬∞. Because of this, questions on worth of stabilization for the directors and rangefinders were raised, whereupon it was decided that it would be up to the Shipbuilding Commission to decide if the stabilization would come with too great a weight penalty, and to omit if they felt it did. Due to the severe lack of flak defence, it was decided to replace the LM/44 twin mounted AA guns with twin mount AA guns if possible, although the 2cm AA guns were considered an acceptable interim measure. Another point of consideration was the matter of the new Ger√§t 58 AA gun, which was designed for U-boats. The idea of mounting these guns on the Type 1942 destroyer class was discussed at length, although it had major issues. One such issue was that the new 5.5cm guns weighed between and , inclusive of directors and sights, which meant that the four guns could be replaced by only two 5.5cm guns. Another issue raised was that room would have to be made for the new 5.5guns. It was decided that the aft single 12.7cm gun and two twin 2cm guns would be removed to make room for two 5.5cm guns, although it was noted that the 12.7cm guns would likely arrive before the 5.5cm guns, and thus the 12.7cm guns would be allowed on a temporary basis. It was also decided that the remaining 3.7cm AA guns would be replaced by 3cm guns, in order to simplify ammunition supply. Another conference was held on 9 February 1944, to discuss the weight and trim of the design. at this conference, it was decided that the torpedo tube placement would follow that of its predecessors, with one set before and abaft the second funnel. Due to this, and the huge number of earlier changes, the design still being worked upon was dubbed the 'B' subdesign. However, yet further modifications were made, by 14 February the Shipbuilding Commission had convinced the other groups to change the design to have three twin main guns. This design, dubbed the 'C' subdesign, had two LM/41 twin turrets placed forward, and one aft, all of which were controlled by radar equipped directors. The number of 5.5cm guns was increased to three, grouped about the after funnel. The hull length and displacement was slightly increased, and the engine machinery was moved further back on the boat, to balance out the weight of the added turret. The propulsion system was to be divided into four motor rooms, each containing two diesels (although only four were actually placed in Z51). Designs {class=wikitable - valign=top !  Design !

Z51s design was modified heavily from the original ('A') design of the Type 1942 destroyer, and slightly modified from the final ('C') design. The original eight MAN type 12Z32/34 diesel engines, which were to drive two shafts via Vulkan gearing, were replaced by only four such engines, which were coupled to the centre shaft, with the wing engines being removed entirely. After 1944, Germany increasingly transmitted schematics and research for advanced science and weaponry to Japan using submarines, as they were the only method of transportation available to Germany that could hope to reach Japan. One such transportation was attempted by German submarine U-234, carrying the material and designs for advanced weaponry, involving new torpedoes, two Messerschmitt Me 262 jet fighters with schematics to build them, and the designs for the Type 1942 destroyer class. However, Germany surrendered on 8 May 1945, before U-234 could reach its target, and she therefore surrendered herself to USS Sutton, in the western Atlantic, on 14 May 1945. Characteristics The Type 1942 destroyers were to be long at waterline, and long overall. Their design gave them a breadth of , and a freeboard of . They would have a draught of at standard load, at design load, and at full load. They would displace at standard load, at design load, and at full load. They were to have a complement of 12 officers and 335 crewmembers. They were to carry one motor pinnace and one torpedo cutter. Their armament was to be four quick firing guns, with 720 rounds of ammunition, and a range of ; eight anti- aircraft guns, with 16,000 rounds; twelve anti-aircraft guns, with 24,000 rounds of ammunition; two triple torpedo tubes, with 18 rounds of ammunition; and 50 mines. Their propulsion was made up of six MAN type 12Z32/34, 24-cylinder (in a 2 √ó 12 configuration), two-stroke, 'V'-form diesel engines, which had a 320-millimetre (13 in) bore, a 440 mm (17 in) stroke motor, and were made of welded steel, which were placed on three shafts of unknown diameter. The two outer shafts were directly connected to one diesel engine. The central shaft connected to four diesel engines, with each central engine producing . Their planned electricity plant is unknown. This setup was designed to give a total output of or , giving them a top speed of . They were to carry of diesel fuel, to give them a range of at . Construction and loss Z51 was ordered from the German shipyard company Deschimag on 25 November 1942, and launched on 2 October 1944. She was sunk during a major air raid on Bremen, on 21 March 1945. She had just been moved away from a fitting- out quay at the Deschimag yard, although largely incomplete: she had only her forward and after shelter decks, no machinery was installed and her shaft tunnels had been welded up to make them watertight. From this it has been suggested that her launch was done only to clear the slip for U-boat building. She was lying abandoned, with her portside to the eastern end of Kohlenhafen, alongside R√∂chling wharf. During the air raid, she was hit by two bombs, although one may not have hit her directly; one struck the vicinity of the bulkhead, between compartments X1 and X11, breaking off the fore-end just behind her No. 2 gun pivot. A later bomb hit her aft, fracturing the stern aft of her No. 4 gun position and causing her quarterdecks to hang at an angle. At this point, numerous holes and cracks had formed in the hull, causing her to flood with water and sink to the bottom. Later on a crane from the nearby dockyard fell across her deck, above her after motor room. After the war, on 21 January 1948, the Weser Port Salvage Authorities called for tenders to assist in her breaking up. A number of quotations were given, ranging from 130,000 to 200,000 RM (Reichsmark), and from four to 13 months' duration. Eventually a contract was placed on 17 February 1948, with Deutsches Dampfschiffahrts Hansa, for 132,000 RM and eight months work. Her breaking up was finished in February 1949. Her four diesel engines were never installed due to the war and were left on MAN's testbeds in Augsburg. Two were later seized by the Allies during the postwar occupation of Germany. One surviving engine was retained by MAN and displayed in its company museum until it was transferred to the Auto & Technik Museum in Sinsheim in 1982.

It is named after one of the classical albedo features on Mars. Its name was officially approved by IAU in 2006. It extends from latitude 80.21¬∞N to 82.4¬∞N and from longitude 279.34¬∞E to 290.52¬∞E (69.48¬∞W ‚Äì 80.66¬∞W). Its centre is located at latitude 81.17¬∞N, longitude 284.4¬∞E (75.6¬∞W), and has a diameter of 129.18 km. Abalos Mensa is a convex formation of approximately 180 kilometer span, with a top-view shaped like a wedge, and lies immediately to the south of the Rupes Tenuis scarp, approximately at 285¬∫E. In the neighbourhood of Abalos Mensa is the beginning of the dune field of Abalos Undae which continues in a southwestward direction after it emerges from the western end of a narrow channel separating Rupes Tenuis from Abalos Mensa. Crotone crater, located at 82.2¬∫N, 290.0¬∫E with a 6.4 km diameter, is situated at the channel separating the Rupes Tenuis scarp from Abalos Mensa. West of Abalos Mensa, parallel to and south of the Rupes Tenuis scarp, runs a narrow, low-altitude plain, named Tenuis Mensa, which exhibits a southward slope. The southern part of Abalos Mensa ends in a scarp called Abalos Scopuli. Formation theories Perspective view of the Martian polar ice cap and the Rupes Tenuis scarp with Abalos Mensa on the left of the picture. Picture was taken by the Mars Express orbiter of the European Space Agency Research on the stratigraphic analysis of the Martian circumpolar deposits is ongoing because it provides information on the ancient climate and geological formation processes of the planet. The circumpolar deposit of Abalos Mensa has been described as an \\"enigmatic wedge of material\\", which has been studied by scientists due to its uncommon location and shape characteristics. Formation theories for Abalos Mensa primarily propose erosional processes based either on fluid action or wind action; the latter are known as Aeolian processes, named after Aeolus, the ancient Greek God of the wind. The fluid flow theories propose fluid action which would erode the surrounding area and produce the channels that separate Abalos Mensa from the main ice cap. The fluid flow theories require volcanic action which would provide the thermal energy to melt the polar materials which would then flow and cause erosion of the area. There have been a number of questions raised about the fluid flow theories, including the uncertainty of volcanic activity in the Planum Boreum region. Impact-shielding-based Aeolian theories propose that ancient material from the base of Planum Boreum was protected by ejecta from an impact crater, and when the old base material of the surrounding area disappeared, the protected mound acted like a source for further accumulation of new deposits, which, with time, produced the mound of Abalos Mensa. A modified, numerical, Aeolian-based approach uses the data provided by the SHARAD, HiRISE, and MOLA instruments on board the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter, to produce a topographic simulation of the area of Abalos Mensa, which is then combined with weather modeling to produce a simulation of the weather conditions and morphological evolution of the area. This approach has determined that the form of Abalos Mensa can be derived using the computer simulation without the need for assumptions such as polar volcanic activity, or impact-shielding of the old polar basal unit.

In ancient times disasters were often perceived as a result of a deity, divine being, or spiritual creature showing their displeasure over human behavior. This later changed as humans began to see disasters as natural events that caused physical destruction and social chaos to individuals, communities, and societies as opposed to responses to human actions. The term \\"disaster myth\\" has been created to describe the belief that people will behave in an irrational, uncontrolled, and even extreme manner outside of normal and accepted social standards despite evidence that proponents state prove otherwise.John Drury, David Novelli, and Clifford Stott, ‚ÄúPsychological disaster myths in the perception and management of mass emergencies: Psychological disaster myths,‚Äù Journal of Applied Social Psychology, 43 (2013): 2259.Lewis Aptekar, Environmental Disasters in Global Perspective (New York: G.K. Hall & Co., 1994), 2-3. Proponents of the term further state that people will only act irrationally in the direst of circumstances when terrible danger is imminent and no avenue of escape appears available. They argue that these disaster myths cause a negative impact when they cause people, officials, and disaster-relief organizations to make detrimental or incorrect disaster planning and response decisions.Quarantelli and Dynes, 67.  Panic/Scared  One commonly held disaster myth is that people develop an insurmountable, illogical fear in the face of a disaster. In turn, this fear becomes infectious, spreads to others, and causes people to flee without thinking and in a chaotic manner that could hurt those around them.Drury, Novelli, and Stott, 2259. In fact, just the opposite can be expected in most cases.Aptekar, 5. Even when experiencing the increased stress from an earthquake, since they arrive unannounced and it is not known when the aftershocks will end, people continue to act rationally.Ibid, 3. Not only do few people panic, most are unwilling to participate in an organized evacuation. Those who live in the disaster area tend to stay in place. The only ones who usually flee are the visitors, tourists, and transients.Quarantelli and Dynes, 67. Disasters also draw people to the area. Some want to help while others just want to see the destruction.Aptekar, 5. The general public and organizations involved in emergency planning, management, and response all tend to accept this disaster myth as reality.Nogami and Yoshida, S191-S192. Panicking can cause harm to others if people flee without thought. Staying put can be even worse since the people are not getting away from the disaster's damage and destruction. When necessary, people should evacuate in an orderly manner to avoid the disaster. It also provides an opportunity to help others evacuate who may need assistance.Quarantelli and Dynes, 68. The myth of panic can cause officials to be cautious when issuing public bulletins. By not wanting to instigate or amplify the believed panic, officials may wait too long to provide the information on which the populace should act.Aptekar, 6. To avoid contributing to or increasing the level of this mythical panic, officials have also chosen to not share information about preparations for some types of disasters (e.g. chemical and biological attacks).Drury, Novelli, and Stott, 2260. The antithesis of the panic myth was seen with Orson Welles‚Äô The War of the Worlds radio broadcast in 1938, the 1942 Cocoanut Grove nightclub fire, and as Hurricane Carla approached the Gulf Coast areas of Texas and Louisiana in 1961.Quarantelli and Dynes, 67-68. Rational behavior also dominated after earthquakes in Europe, North and South America, and Asia.Aptekar, 3. Despite many reports of widespread panic, evidence later proved otherwise.Quarantelli and Dynes, 67. The myth of panic affecting the official warnings of authorities has been seen in Mexico when the Rio Grande River flooded, in Italy during the flooding of the city of Florence, and after a volcanic eruption in Japan.Aptekar, 6. In the instances when authorities chose to send the military instead of humanitarian organizations in response to Hurricane Katrina, it was in some part to help manage and control the perceived panic among the population.Drury, Novelli, and Stott, 2260.  Shock  Many people believe those who experience a disaster firsthand experience emotional trauma that has both immediate and lasting effects.Quarantelli and Dynes, 68. It is thought the initial devastation of the disaster leaves people too fragile and in shock.Drury, Novelli, and Stott, 2259. As such, they are unable to cope with their situation or participate in recovery efforts. They are consequently dependent on assistance from outside relief agencies.Quarantelli and Dynes, 68. Only in a small minority of cases does this myth turn out to be true. And many times, the experienced shock is short-lived. What in fact happens in most cases is people react immediately to the disaster and its effects.Ibid. The disaster can also be a jolt of energy which drives people to respond to the emergency.Claude de Ville de Goyet, ‚ÄúStop Propagating Disaster Myths,‚Äù The Lancet, 356, no. 9231 (August 26, 2000): 763. Those who went through the disaster are the first engaged in relief and rescue efforts before any outside agency. They come together along familiar lines such as family and friends and then move as needed to a larger scale involving groups with which they associate (e.g. churches). If the familiar cannot be contacted or they are unable to respond, only then do most people look toward the faceless law enforcement, welfare, and relief organizations for assistance. People will also seek help from outside the familiar when special equipment or medical skills are required.Quarantelli and Dynes, 68. The myth of widespread shock leads outside relief organizations to plan their efforts as if they are the only ones who will be providing assistance. This may create a disconnected rather than complementary relationship between them and the local agencies. Additionally, the feeling on the part of the survivors that they do not need to rely on outsiders coupled with the relief organizations believing they are saviors creates a wall between the two which in turn inhibits communication, coordination, and effective relief and recovery efforts.Ibid. People's reliance on self and the well-known was seen in a variety of disaster types such as the 1953 tornado in Flint-Beecher, Michigan, the 1955 flood of Marysville and Yuba City, California, Hurricane Audrey in 1957, Hurricane Carla in 1961, Hurricane Betsy in 1965, and the 1971 earthquake in San Fernando, California.Ibid. Both in Mexico City in 1985 and in Turkey in 1999, thousands of local residents banded together to search for fellow victims in the earthquake wreckage.de Goyet, 763. Neighbors performed more than half of the rescue activities after the Great Hanshin-Awaji earthquake hit Kobe City, Japan in 1995.Nogami and Yoshida, S192.  Assistance  People believe the population impacted by a disaster are unable to do anything about their situation so are standing by just waiting for the saviors from afar to swoop in with the solution to all of their suffering. Not only that, relief organizations often think the aid must be provided immediately. This myth is especially pervasive when the disaster strikes a third-world country and it is a ‚Äúsuperior‚Äù western country coming to the rescue.de Goyet, 762-763. While relief organizations with emergency managers, medical teams, and the like do offer assistance after a disaster, most people are actually saved by other survivors and local authorities, agencies, and organizations.Ibid, 762. Because of this myth, more supplies are often sent than the disaster area typically needs. In addition to excess quantity, much of the supplies end up being of little to no use.Nogami and Yoshida, S193. Relief organizations often do not wait for an assessment of the disaster area and an identification of needs which can be provided by local officials or performed by themselves. As a consequence, money is often wasted on sending unneeded teams of experts or supplies when local authorities and victims would benefit more if that same money was allocated towards providing resources that filled gaps and complemented their efforts. Donors compound the issue by donating used clothing, household items, and the like.de Goyet, 763. With too many supplies on-hand or in possession of supplies they cannot use, local officials are forced to waste manpower and resources on disposing of them.Nogami and Yoshida, S193. Instead of providing unwanted and unrequested goods, organizations and donors should send money which can be more easily applied to fulfilling local needs.de Goyet, 763. An example of this myth's impact was seen following the 1993 Hokkaid≈ç earthquake as authorities were forced to spend 1.2 million in U.S. dollars on the removal of unnecessary relief supplies.Nogami and Yoshida, S193.  Resources  Outside rescue, relief, and recovery agencies almost always miscalculate the amount of available resources for basic needs that are available locally in the aftermath of a disaster. They believe there are not enough materiel, supplies, and personnel for the initial response.Quarantelli and Dynes, 69. In fact, there are usually enough supplies to last several weeks. Enough food can normally be found in stores, warehouses, and people's homes. Clothing is rarely needed. Medical supplies reside in hospitals, warehouses, or nearby communities. Hospitals as well as police and fire departments often transition to 24-hour operations. And no evidence is available that proves the unfound belief that key personnel will leave their posts to go attend to their families and friends.Ibid. Relief agencies tend to believe they must act immediately rather than assess the situation first. As a result, they often provide supplies when there is already enough on-site for the immediate future.Ibid.  Crime  The prevalence of looting in the wake of disasters is another common myth.Ibid. It is thought that disasters provide cover for criminal activity.Drury, Novelli, and Stott, 2259. In this scenario, people take advantage of law enforcement and other agencies responsible for maintaining the peace, safety, and security being occupied with disaster response and relief efforts.Aptekar, 4. People believe criminals will use the disaster as an opportunity to loot due to a prevalence of evacuated, abandoned, and unguarded homes and stores.Quarantelli and Dynes, 69. While looting can occur, they are always isolated incidents. And much reported looting is either entirely false or, at worst, desperate survivors scavenging for necessities.Ibid. But because people believe looting happens, they frequently refuse to leave despite the disaster's destruction and damage in order to protect their homes and property.Aptekar, 5. When no looting occurs, people tend to believe it is because enough security was in place to prevent it rather than looters did not exist in the first place.Quarantelli and Dynes, 69. Also, officials who believe in this myth end up assigning personnel to a protection role rather than to a much more critical rescue, relief, or logistics support function.de Goyet, 763. The lack of connection between disasters and looting was seen in the rates for theft and burglaries actually falling after Hurricane Betsy in 1965.Quarantelli and Dynes, 69. This myth's impact was also seen outside the United States as evidenced by many Guatemalans staying after the 1976 earthquake out of fear of having their animals, homes, and possessions stolen.Aptekar, 5.  Morale  People tend to believe that survivors are extremely negative after a disaster and need to assurance that the outside world cares and the future is bright for themselves and their community.Quarantelli and Dynes, 70. In fact, people are most often optimistic and have very high morale in a disaster's aftermath. They frequently subordinate any personal feelings of loss and suffering in order to apply themselves to providing food, shelter, and other services to those in need. Their motivation to help one another boosts the sense of community and togetherness.Ibid, 69-70. Because of the myth, dignitaries and officials feel the need to come to the disaster area to reassure the survivors. They often make promises of aid that either are not kept or do not happen in a timely manner. This can cause survivors to resent outsiders. This resentment in turn can prevent the survivors from asking for needed skills and resources that the outsiders can in fact provide.Ibid, 70.  Disease  When a disaster results in deaths, especially in large quantities, people often believe they are at considerable risk of catching a disease from them.de Goyet, 762. They also believe disease epidemics develop in the wake of disasters.Aptekar, 5. The fact that they died from the disaster does not make them a risk for spreading diseases. If a body does carry a communicable disease, the person already had it when he or she was alive. The fact that the body is now stationary and will remain in one place makes it less of a risk than prior to death.de Goyet, 762. And an epidemic would happen only if either of two circumstances exist: 1) the disaster brings disease with it for which the people are not immune or 2) the disaster's effects lead to malnutrition, the malnutrition increases susceptibility to disease, and finally, a large number of people contract the disease.Aptekar, 5. The belief in the myth can result in the hurried disposal of the bodies without proper identification, burial, or involvement by the next of kin. This can add to the suffering of survivors because they were not allowed to properly care for their loved ones. In addition to the personal toll, needlessly disposing of dead bodies can divert personnel and supplies from other areas where at that time they are needed more (e.g. involved in actions that benefit those still living).de Goyet, 762. Fear or rumor of an epidemic can also cause relief organizations to provide medicines, resources, and other aid for a problem that does not exist.Aptekar, 5. This myth has been repeated many times such as in the 1972 earthquake in Managua, Nicaragua, Hurricane Mitch in 1998, the 1999 earthquake in Turkey, and the 2000 flooding in Mozambique.de Goyet, 762. Additionally, rumors of hepatitis, measles, dysentery, and typhus that were later proven to be false followed the 1976 earthquake in Guatemala.Aptekar, 5.  Perpetuation of myths  Myths Live On  By people  People who have experienced a disaster often believe the dramatic accounts of their own suffering. It allows them to pass off their actions as atypical and heroic. In the process of telling others about their involvement, the mythic component of their story is spread along with the reality.Quarantelli and Dynes, 70. Disaster survivors tend to worry about looting. Their increased anxiety can cause them to spread reports whether they definitely know of any or not. While most people who are asked admit to not having personally witnessed or experienced looting, many claim of being aware of it elsewhere. The belief in looting can make people jump to the conclusion that looting was the cause of items going missing before considering the disaster may have moved, buried, or destroyed them.Ibid, 69.  By organizations  Government agencies, civilian organizations, and first responders all believe to some extent in disaster myths.Drury, Novelli, and Stott, 2266. When this happens, the myths in turn are often included in their planning and response to disasters, victims, and survivors. And practices based even partially on disaster myths are not only likely to result in inappropriate or inefficient relief and response actions, they can also help to perpetuate the myths thereby affecting people and property in the next disaster.Ibid, 2269. An example of how organizations can perpetuate disaster myths takes place in the days following a disaster and up until official numbers are compiled. During this time, officials from emergency, relief, rescue, and welfare organizations can overestimate the loss of life and destruction of property. This sheds a more positive light on their organizations since they can point to effective emergency procedures and local heroism as the reason their figures turned out to be higher than the actual numbers. If their calculations end up being lower than the official figures, they might be blamed for incompetence and inefficiency.Quarantelli and Dynes, 70. Although the inability to cope by a disaster-site's community and people is a myth, it continues to be believed. One reason is the justification relief agencies give while promoting the assistance they provide. They feel they are needed because they believe facilities such as hospitals, police and fire departments, and other local first responders do not have the capacity to meet the sheer demand from a disaster. And if their efforts do not go as planned, they often point to survivors‚Äô irrationality rather than reassess the assumptions on which they developed their relief plans.Ibid, 68-69. Local, regional, and national officials make up a primary source of information for the media. In the self-imposed small window the media has to get out the latest details of the disaster, fact-checking sometimes suffers and they rely solely on the officials' accuracy.Ibid, 70. Consequently, officials substantially influence the media's portrayal and what viewers, listeners, and readers see. An example of this is seen in officials highlighting the positives within their own organization's efforts while downplaying the information from and activities by unofficial groups and sources.James D. Goltz, \\"Are the News Media Responsible for the Disaster Myths? A Content Analysis of Emergency Response Imagery,\\" International Journal of Mass Emergencies and Disasters 2, no. 3 (1984): 365-366. When asked by the media, law enforcement officials frequently say they are taking sufficient action to prevent looting even if they have taken no action on the issue. If the norm happens and little to no looting occurs, they may be credited for the absence of crime. But if the exception to the rule happens, they do not want to be blamed for not protecting against the looting. Whether it is true or not, people believe local law enforcement is out keeping the area secure from looters and the myth continues to propagate.Quarantelli and Dynes, 69.  By media  Many myths are perpetuated by the mass media to include newspapers, television, radio, and internet news.Nogami and Yoshida, S201. This is largely due to the way they portray disasters. In fact, most people base their opinions and beliefs regarding disasters and survivor behavior on what they see in the media. The media strives to keep their viewers‚Äô and readers‚Äô attention for as long as possible. Drama and destruction is interesting and compelling; most of everything else is secondary.Quarantelli and Dynes, 70. For the most part, the media, regardless of country, takes a fairly standard approach to disaster coverage and reporting. Immediately after the disaster, they rely on statistics of destruction and damage followed by stories of victims and those providing the rescue and relief.Aptekar, 129-130. The media repeatedly moves away from discussing the disaster as a whole to focusing on individual parts and the drama involved in them.Ibid, 130. As a result of its manner in covering disasters, the media may capture only pieces instead of the entire event while emphasizing the unusually heroic or unusually tragic incidents.Quarantelli and Dynes, 70. A main focus of media coverage centers on emergency management organizations performing rescue and relief actions in the disaster area.Goltz, 364-365. The media frequently portrays international relief teams as angels saving the victims from the disaster's destruction while simultaneously implying the local officials are negligent, inept, or corrupt.de Goyet, 762. Within this backdrop, the portrayal of a breakdown in society and social behavior is more likely to appear in coverage of disasters occurring outside the United States.Goltz, 365. An example of this type of portrayal that helps perpetuate disaster myths involves the frequent reports of people panicking in both small and large numbers to the point of fleeing when faced by an oncoming disaster such as a hurricane.Quarantelli and Dynes, 67. Additionally, when the international media noticed few stories of looting coming out of Japan following the Great East Japan Disaster in 2011, they generally remarked on how well the Japanese people behave. By believing in this myth, they assumed the Japanese showed more behavioral control than other societies rather than understanding it rarely happens in association with any disaster.Nogami and Yoshida, S192.

Its members formally organized on June 12, 1833, as the city's first Christian Church (Disciples of Christ) congregation. The congregation formally adopted the name of Central Christian Church on February 3, 1879. Its red brick and stone masonry Romanesque Revival-style church was dedicated in 1893. Building additions were completed in 1913 and in 1922. The church continues to serve the Indianapolis community and holds weekly worship services. Members of the Indianapolis Disciples of Christ congregation, along with others around the state, were instrumental in establishing North Western Christian University, present-day Butler University, which opened for student enrollment in 1855. The congregation was also active in missionary work and acted as host to several annual meetings of the Indiana Christian Missionary Society, which the congregation helped to organized in 1849, and the American Christian Missionary Society. Church members also formed a women's mission society and hosted the executive committee of the national Christian Woman's Board of Missions. The church helped to establish other Disciples of Christ congregations in Indianapolis, including the Second Christian Church, the city's first African American Christian Church (Disciples of Christ) congregation in 1866. Central Christian Church became known for its music and educational programs, community outreach, and foreign ministry. Notable church members include Ovid Butler, a local lawyer who helped found North Western Christian University, and temperance movement advocate and women's suffrage leader Zerelda G. Wallace. History Origins In 1833 a group of five congregations of New Light and Baptist reformers in Rush County, Indiana, selected missionary evangelist John O'Kane to organize the first Church of Christ in Indianapolis that later became known as Central Christian Church. The congregation initially met in a log cabin belonging to Benjamin Roberts and was formally organized on June 12, 1833. Charter members of Indianapolis's first Christian Church (Disciples of Christ) congregation included John J. Sanders, a local physician, and his family; Benjamin Roberts; and Peter Roberts. The Church of Christ in Indianapolis was the city's fourth religious congregation, preceded by the Baptists, Presbyterians, and Methodists. First meetinghouse Indianapolis's first Church of Christ congregation met at various sites until 1837, when its first meetinghouse was erected on the south side of Kentucky Avenue, between Capitol and Senate Avenues. The church building, which is no longer standing, had two front doors, one for men and one for women. A low partition installed along the church's center interior aisle separated the sexes during worship services. In 1839 the congregation's first meetinghouse served as the site of the first statewide meeting of the Disciples of Christ in Indiana. In 1849 a group gathered at the church to organize the Indiana Christian Missionary Society. Christian Chapel In 1852 the Indianapolis congregation's new brick church was completed at the corner of Delaware and Ohio Streets. The new building became known as Christian Chapel. Members of the Indianapolis Disciples of Christ congregation, along with others around the state, were instrumental in organizing North Western Christian University (present-day Butler University) in the 1850s. On July 27, 1852, the university's first board of directors met at the church to discuss plans to build the first building on the site of its first campus at Thirteenth Street and College Avenue in Indianapolis. (The university opened for student enrollment in 1855.)Shaw, pp. 135, 168. In addition, the Christian Chapel congregation was active in missionary work. Annual meetings of the Indiana and American Christian Missionary Societies were held at the chapel in October 1872.Shaw, p. 182. In 1874 a group of women from Christian Chapel organized a women's mission society. Many of the Indianapolis Disciples of Christ congregation's women went on to hold leadership positions in the state and national Christian Woman's Board of Missions, which was established later that year. The group became a sponsor of a global evangelic and service ministry. The national board's executive committee held its first meeting at Christian Chapel.Shaw, pp. 211‚Äì13. Central Christian Church On February 3, 1879, the Christian Chapel congregation adopted the name of Central Christian Church. By the mid-1870s there were six Disciples of Christ congregations in Indianapolis. Conflicts between the denomination's members forced its division into two groups, the Christian Church (Disciples of Christ) and a smaller group known as the Churches of Christ. The Central Christian Church congregation remained a part of the Disciples of Christ. In 1883, Zerelda G. Wallace, a charter member of the Indianapolis congregation who became an outspoken temperance movement advocate, women's suffrage leader, and the wife of former Indiana governor David Wallace, refused wine offered during Holy Communion because of her opposition to the consumption of alcohol. Her efforts began the congregation's tradition of using grape juice instead of wine for communion. Present-day location The present-day church, erected at Delaware Avenue and Walnut Street in Indianapolis, was completed in 1892 and dedicated on April 16, 1893. W. Scott Moore, a local architect, designed the church; Charlton Eden and Sons, who were members of the congregation, constructed the facility at a cost of $47,500. The price included the building, an organ, and other furnishings. The church's cornerstone was laid on July 26, 1892, and formal dedication ceremonies were held on April 16, 1893. Two additions have been made to the site. The east side of the church was expanded in 1913 and an education wing was built adjacent to the church in 1922. Norman Hill, a member of the congregation, designed for the new education wing, which cost $125,000 to construct. Description The brick and stone masonry church on North Delaware Street faces west and is designed in the Romanesque Revival style. The church dates from 1892 and has a red brick and stone masonry exterior with stained-glass windows and a tower. A Romanesque Revival-style red brick and stone addition extending east of the original church was built in 1913. The education wing was added in 1922 to house a gymnasium, classrooms, and a dining hall. The church's interior follows the Akron Plan and has three entrances at the building's corners. The church's pipe organ, choir, pulpit, and a marble-encased baptistery were installed in the sanctuary's northeast corner. Walnut paneling was added to the choir loft in 1954, in addition to a new Moeller Company pipe organ with more than 1,000 pipes. Oak pews arranged on a slanted floor in a semi-circle facing the pulpit and choir provide good visibility for the congregation during church services. The sanctuary has a vaulted ceiling and its stained- glass windows include various Christian symbols such as a cross, crown, anchor, palms, and vines. A large, sliding door on the east side of the sanctuary provides access to fellowship hall, which includes wrought-iron grillwork on its second-floor balcony. Mission Christian Chapel (Central Christian Church) helped organized other Disciples of Christ congregations in Indianapolis. One of its mission churches, formed in 1866, became the Second Christian Church, the city's first African American Christian Church (Disciples of Christ) congregation. (The Second Christian Church was renamed Light of the World Christian Church in 1982.) The Third Christian Church (Disciples of Christ) congregation was organized in 1868.Bodenhamer and Barrows, eds., p. 908. See also: Central Christian Church, known for its educational programs, community outreach, and foreign ministry, was among the first to establish graded Sunday school classes. In addition, the congregation was a pioneer in developing activities for Indianapolis's inner-city residents. Over the years the church became known for its music, choir, and organ programs. Membership Although it began with a few members in 1833, Central Christian Church's membership had reached 1,715 by 1936, ranking it among the largest of Indiana's Disciples of Christ congregations at that time.Shaw, 363.

His work includes large-scale paintings that explore themes of colonialism, democracy, nationalism, and life in Southern Africa. Early life and education Mokgosi was born in 1981 in Francistown, Botswana, and raised by his mother and grandmother in the city of Maun. He began drawing in primary school. While in high school, he became interested in the potential of making political commentary with art. In 2003, he moved to the United States, participated in the Whitney Independent Study Program, and studied art at Williams College and University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA), earning B.A. and Master of Fine Arts degrees. Mokgosi studied for four years with American conceptual artist Mary Kelly, who guided him in developing a project- based practice, which he described as \\"focused not on producing objects but articulating a set of questions\\". Career From 2008-2011 Mokgosi created his first series of paintings, Pax Afrikaner, which explored xenophobia and national identity in southern Africa. In 2012, Mokgosi was an artist-in- residence at the Studio Museum in Harlem. There he worked on completing his Pax Kaffraria painting series, which he explained was \\"to explore how people in southern Africa think about nationhood.\\" Mokgosi made a series of more than 50 paintings on the subject of colonialism in Africa. A book on the Pax Kaffraria project was published by the Hammer Museum in 2014. In 2014, Mokgosi began the eight-chapter project Democratic Intuition, which he described as being about \\"how do normal people understand, reciprocate, have access to, and not have access to the ideas of democracy and the democratic\\". He presented the first two chapters of this work at his first solo New York exhibition in 2016. Meleko Mokgosi also co-founded The Interdisciplinary Art and Theory Program in New York in 2018: an exclusive education programme for fine arts practitioners aimed at facilitating the investigation of various knowledge frameworks in the world of the arts.  Style  There are two distinct approaches in Meleko Mokogosi‚Äôs paintings. In projects such as 'Wall of Casbah' (2009‚Äì2014), and 'Modern Art: The Root of African Savages' (2012‚Äì2016) he takes a text-based approach. This involves reproducing museum labels on canvas with annotations to highlight the inherent cultural bias and colonial power dynamics in these supposedly neutral educational materials. Other projects like Pax Afrikaner and Pax Kaffraria are figurative and draw from visual sources such as European history painting and cinematic imagery. These works combine a range of imagery, tropes and symbols, to bring a critical eye to aspects of national identity, colonial history and post-colonial legacies within Southern Africa.

A hurricane is a tropical cyclone with sustained one-minute winds of at least 74 miles per hour. They are created when warm water hits the troposphere and high pressure pushes warm, dry air down in the center. This occurrence is particularly strong in the Caribbean due to the high amounts of humidity and warm air produce near perfect conditions to form these hurricanes, which are measured by the Saffir-Simpson scale and the Power Dispersion Index (PDI). When this extreme amount of energy encounters a society, the effects are of great magnitude. Because of these favorable conditions, there have been many hurricanes that have passed through and affected the Caribbean waters. Most notably The Great Hurricane of 1780, San Ciriaco in 1899, Hurricane Gilbert in 1988, the hurricane season of 2008, Hurricane Sandy in 2012, Hurricane Joaquin in 2015, and most recently, Hurricane Irma in late 2017. The Atlantic Hurricane Season runs from June to November 30 and peaks from August to October. The people of the Caribbean view hurricanes as a natural part of life. When a hurricane touches down on a Caribbean island the damage is substantial; the ecology is thrown out of its normal cycle, topography shifts, agriculture is set back, the economy and industry take a blow, society either unites or falls apart, infrastructure is ruined, and preventative measures must be implemented. There is no part of Caribbean life or its history that is untouched by natural disasters. As far back as Columbus, hurricane activity was recorded as he sailed across the Atlantic. This extensive record of impacts influences Caribbean life and the people living in the Caribbean nations.  Ecology  Caribbean pine forest in the Blue Mountains, Jamaica The ecology of the Caribbean is tropical because of its proximity to the equator with warm temperatures that result in a humid climate. There are many ecosystems in the Caribbean with a multitude of tropical plants, trees and animals. When a hurricane passes over an island, it brings usually heavy rainfall and strong winds. These heavy rains saturate the soil and make it weaker, while the tree canopies became heavier than normal. The strong winds bring debris and break down the trees, which contributes to the amount of debris that would be carried by flooded rivers. The drier the hurricane, the less impact it would cause because soil is not as saturated. The effects of the hurricane on vegetation structure and trees are notable effects of Caribbean hurricanes. The damage of the Jamaican Cockpit Country revealed that the least damage was in the bottom of valleys protected by forests and the most damage was on slopes with no other vegetation for protection. The defoliation of the canopy can be a positive effect because the winds blow the leaves to the forest floor and deliver nutrient pulses to much needed plants. The susceptibility of plants to storms depends on the age, density, and proximity to larger plants. Animals are also affected by their physical death, changes in food supply and changes in the microenvironment, the degree of survival differing with each affected category. For example, the physical numbers of bird populations were largely reduced by Hurricane Gilbert, but recovered quickly, while the populations that lived in forests with foliage damage took longer to recover. The effects of hurricanes on animals and their environment is significant, but the extent is unknown because of the multiple plant species and soil quality that influence the research of the ecology after a Hurricane. Topography The natives of the Caribbean suggested that hurricanes were a natural part of the cycle of life, so they adjusted for survival. The Ta√≠nos, natives of the Greater Antilles, built their lives around the seasonality, frequency and power of storms. In the 1700s, authorities began to prohibit building along the coast because they wanted to lessen illegal activity and foreign contact, but it would also help to lessen the casualties of a hurricane's storm surge. The citizens whose jobs involved the sea would have to obtain licenses before they could sail. Inland, flooding did the greatest damage. Cuba's dense forests had to be cut down in the 1790s to make room for the growing population, even though the trees were preventing soil erosion in that area. The increase in population and danger of soil erosion made the rains of future hurricanes disastrous.  Agriculture and economy  Hurricane Matthew Damage Assessment The agriculture of the Caribbean is critical to the islands because the income from the import and export of crops largely contributes to their economy. If crops are destroyed from the effects of hurricanes, the islands will need to rebuild their system as fast as possible to generate income needed to rebuild infrastructure. The factor that determines the success of crops is the weather. The initial effect of the hurricane on crops is staggering. The 1860s was a particularly bad decade for Puerto Rico. 1865 and 1866 had been a tough year for crops, particularly sugar and coffee, so there were high expectancies for the 1867 season. Luck was not on their side; there was heavy downpours in the beginning of the year that saturated the soil and rivers. The fields could not take any more water and this resulted in the loss of 10 million escudos in damage for crops like coffee, rum, sugar, cotton and tobacco. This impeded the rebuilding process and eventually added to the political tensions of the time. The 1899 San Ciriaco hurricane hit Puerto Rico, whose economy relied primarily on coffee. The crop had already been facing problems with a decrease in prices and competing countries, but the hurricane wiped out any chance of rebounding from the losses of the previous years. The winds stripped the berries from the trees and the coffee exports of 1899 were only 10 percent of the average export. The losses amounted to 12 million dollars in revenue from 1899 to 1901. This left a dismal outlook on the future for farmers. Sugar was also affected by the storm, although the results were not as drastic. Only a third of the sugar crop could be harvested in 1899, but the soil was reinvigorated. The storm only affected the older haciendas, which would have been retired soon regardless of the hurricane. This allowed for newer technologies to be introduced to the sugar system and U.S. involvement increased. Overall, San Ciriaco helped and hurt the agriculture of Puerto Rico. The economy of the Caribbean is dependent on the productivity of its agricultural sector. The infrastructure of a community is usually destroyed with the subsistence crops and crops for export. One example is the three simultaneous hurricanes that hit Cuba in the 1840s. These hurricanes destroyed coffee crops, which made Cuban planters abandon coffee and turn to sugar production. The Cuban economy, specifically the transatlantic economy, relied on routes and patterns of travel in the Atlantic for trading. In Cuba in the early 1800s, coffee exports competed with the emerging sugar interests. Following the Haitian Revolution, Spain was interested in utilizing another colony to center its sugar production. Cuba became that colony and the foremost producer of sugar for the modern world. The empirical rule of the Spanish over the Cubans, especially Cuban slaves, was dominant and demonstrated the increasing debasement of slaves for monetary gains. Agriculture was an important part of the Cuban economy, and it was especially vulnerable to the hurricanes that hit the Cuban island. In the 1830s, Cuba was hit by several hurricanes, including Cienfuegos in 1832, and a hurricane that devastated Havana, Matanzas, and Trinidad. Cuba in the 1840s encountered many changes agriculturally, economically, and socially. Beginning early in the decade, through the expansion of sugar production, the institution of slavery also expanded. Slavery expanded due to the increasing demands for the production of sugar. At this point in Cuban history, the international markets were also expanding. The demand for sugar increased exponentially. Economically, while the market demanded sugar from Cuba, coffee, tobacco, and sugar continued to be grown on the island. Land, in order to cultivate these commodities, as well as a large slave population, was necessary to sustain production levels. During this decade of agricultural growth, the hurricanes that occurred in this region did not necessarily hinder the overall boom of production in the Spanish Caribbean, especially Cuba. The hurricanes has immediate impact on the island's people and ability to thrive. While hurricanes might not have impacted the overall domination of agricultural production in the Caribbean, individual storms in the 1840s affected infrastructure and the fields for subsistence farmers and larger growers. On October 4, 1844, Hurricane San Francisco de Asis struck the island of Cuba. The storm swept through ports and towns, especially near Havana. Ships, docks, and piers near these ports were destroyed in these storms. Areas inland were also affected, including many rich agricultural zones. These storms damaged the fields and changed the geological makeup of them. Although these storms might have not affected the economy in the long term, they were significant in the immediate impact that they had. Homes were destroyed and fields were rendered useless until they regained their usable state. Before the affected areas of the island could fully recover from the damage of Hurricane San Francisco de Asis, in October 1846 Hurricane San Francisco de Borja hit half of western Cuba. All crops suffered from this hurricane and the overall harvest during the year was reduced by ¬æ. Another thought to consider is that increasing damage estimates in recent years, which will only expand because of the growing population. Certain economies are believed to have their foundation created during historical events. For instance, Acemoglu et el. believes the disease environment determined if colonial powers decided to invest in institutions to protect property rights and thus played an important role in the investment of quality institutions and economic development since their independence. Trade is crucial to island countries, particularly because their economy has grown reliant on its exports to other countries. The sugar industry was the Caribbean's main source of income during colonial times. Even though there is only a one-year reduction in sugar exports, it amounted to an average of 68.1% throughout the entire Caribbean. The reduction in exports comes out to one-fourth of its value. Any loss in revenue hurts the overall economy because most these populations live in poverty and rely on crops to put food on the table.  Society  Great Hurricane of 1780 The impact of hurricanes on society is visible through the loss of life, increase in social tensions and damage to infrastructures. The three different arguments related to cause of hurricanes are human caused, scientifically caused and divinely caused. The last argument is a widely-held belief by the indigenous population. Natives believed that disasters were the will of their gods and nothing could be done from preventing the oncoming hurricane. Beliefs of what caused disasters began to change to a more scientific thought during the Enlightenment period. There was an increase in funding for scientific research and regulations would be created to ensure safety. Caribbean ports were closed during the fall equinox and no ship could leave until the ‚Äúdangerous season passed‚Äù. In The Great Hurricane of 1780, 20,000 perished and in 1998 Hurricane Mitch tallied from 11,000-19,000 dead. Furthermore, hurricanes would destroy most of the available food sources, plantains or guanabanas that fell from trees would be the only available food course, but even these would begin to rot within a few days. Hunger would arrive and the people affected would have to seek out other sources of nutrients that they wouldn't normally eat, like grated roots of plants. Various types of sicknesses would follow. For example, Steven Schwartz writes that after the 1685 hurricane in Puerto Rico about 900 people died from a deadly plague because their immune systems were weakened from hunger. The bodies that were found in rivers ended up contaminating potable water sources and led to the spread of diseases. The rise in social tensions were revealed in the aftermath of the hurricane. The fear of looting and a breakdown of authority by a slave revolt would plague the minds of slave owners, although slaves were affected the most because of their lack of access to proper resources. One exception to the slave owners‚Äô fear was the hurricane in 1776 led to a slave rebellion, where 25,000 slaves from 70 different plantations were killing their overseers and burning buildings and cane fields. Normally, like in San Ciriaco, no ‚Äúextensive looting or other civil disturbances‚Äù were recorded. Thirdly, the damage of society's infrastructure by hurricanes is massive. The Hurricane of 1780 had a storm surge of up to 25 feet that destroyed 150 homes and collapsed the hospital, where wounded sailors were being treated. In 1792, a hurricane hit Cuba and brought less rain than the 1791 hurricane, but the 1792 hurricane had higher wind speeds and halted or destroyed the rebuilding from the road and bridges damaged in 1791. Despite the 1792 hurricane being a moderate disaster, the effects coupled with bad weather earlier in the year compounded the destruction. The communication lines within society had broken down and trees blocked roads that were used to send supplies to neighboring towns. The destruction of the infrastructure of Ponce, the second largest city, by San Ciriaco flooded the streets, ruined the closed businesses along the coast, damaged municipal buildings, and destroyed telephone, telegraph and electric services. These storms stripped away human built safety barriers and forced people to live in poverty.  Preventative measures  Members of CARICOM Since hurricanes are commonplace in the Caribbean, countries have begun the process of disaster mitigation. For example, the British Housing Project in St. Vincent built new houses with foundations supported by concrete walls and wood beams cast in concrete. There have also been the development of wind seed maps that give insight on the correct angle to position roofs and a stricterinspection of building codes throughout the Caribbean. Most residential houses and structures are susceptible to hurricane damage in CARICOM, the Caribbean Community and Common Market. Historically, agricultural workers in St. Kitts didn't own their houses and most of these homes were built as small and cheaply as possible. Construction of houses also occurred on poor soil conditions and steep slopes that increased the vulnerability to landslides and soil erosion. Because of the poor construction and inadequate living areas, there have been numerous efforts to reduce hurricane damage. The leading groups of disaster mitigation include: the Caribbean Disaster Mitigation Project 2011 (CDMP), the Caribbean Disaster Emergency Response Agency (CDERA) by CARICOM, and the University of West Indies Cyclone Resistant Housing (Caribbean) Project. The development of technology has aided in disaster prevention too. Some examples are the introduction of kites and balloons to measure the insides of storms, weather reconnaissance (flying aircraft into a hurricane) and hurricane forecasting to track the path of storms. These systems have become even more important because of the rise of population during the last inactive period from the 1970s to 1990s. Hurricane Mitch is a harbinger of future disaster for the Caribbean, unless societal vulnerabilities are reduced.

It is the only full-length song performed by the trio in their short films, and the only time they mimed to their own pre-recorded soundtrack. It contains a censor-baiting line; when the singers start ringing the changes on the letter ‚ÄúF‚Äù it seems as though an obscene word will result, but it does not. For their 1959 album The Nonsense Songbook, the Stooges re- recorded the song (retitled as \\"The Alphabet Song\\") with Moe, Larry and Curly- Joe DeRita (filling in for Curly Howard, who died in 1952). The letters \\"G\\", \\"J\\", \\"M\\" and the \\"Curly's a dope\\" line were omitted, and new lyrics featuring the letters \\"N,\\" \\"P,\\" \\"R,\\" \\"S,\\" \\"T,\\" \\"V,\\" and \\"Z\\" were added. In 2005, Stooge film historian Richard Finegan identified the composer of the song as Septimus Winner (1827‚Äì1902), who had originally published it in 1875 as \\"The Spelling Bee\\". Septimus' own version, though, appears to have been based on an earlier version called \\"Ba-Be-Bi-Bo-Bu\\", which has a centuries-old tradition. Origin The lyrics of Septimus Winner's \\"Spelling Bee\\" (a.k.a. \\"Ba Be Bi Bo Bu\\") were slightly different.See A number of schools like Harvard University used this as one of their traditional songs, which itself may have originated centuries earlier in typesetting, as a very similar song or chant was used to help train apprentice printers in the structure of language, a tradition being described as \\"ancient\\" even as early as 1740: Notes * The lip-synching is a bit off in spots, particularly among the chorus of students. * During Curly's solo on the letters \\"K\\" and \\"L,\\" he rushes the tempo on the tongue- tying lyrics, forcing the backing singers to keep up with him. * Sheet music for the older version of the song can be found in \\"The Book of a Thousand Songs,\\" edited by Albert Weir, where the composer's credit is omitted.

Description  The painting was made on canvas with oil. Its background is a mountainous area in a scarlet sunset. The composition emphasizes the constraint of the demon's figure, as if pressed between the upper and lower bars of the frame. The painting is created in Vrubel's unique style with the effect of crystal edges, which makes his paintings look like stained glass or panels. That effect was achieved with plain strokes made with a painting knife.  History  A sketch, 1901 A sketch, 1901 A sketch, 1901 In 1900, Vrubel approached the theme of \\"Demons\\" again. Having not yet finished the piece The Demon Flying (1900), in 1901 the painter started drawing preliminary sketches for the painting The Demon Downcast. As Vladimir von Meck recalled, > near the drawing-room, there was a small room decorated with an arch. Along > its entire length, from the window to the wall, a giant canvas stood. Vrubel > broke it down in squares with a rope and coal. His face was excitedly > cheerful. ‚ÄúI begin,‚Äù he said. Vrubel suddenly sent a note to von Meck asking to send photos of the Caucasian mountains: ‚ÄúI won‚Äôt fall asleep until I get them!‚Äù Upon receiving photos of Elbrus and Kazbek soon afterward, that night behind the demon's back grew pearl-coloured peaks, ‚Äúfanned with the eternal cold of death‚Äù. While Vrubel was considered sane in general, people around him noted his irritability. Despite the mainly negative responses of contemporary critics, his popularity among painting lovers grew over time. In autumn of 1901, his spouse Nadezhda Zabela wrote to her sister: > Recently, delegates of the Vienna Secession had lunch with us. Very nice > Viennese artists, they are delighted with Misha and want to take everything > to an exposition; unfortunately, his ‚ÄúDemon‚Äù will be too late for this > exposition. He has a lot of work in general. Everyone requires his sketches > and his advice, invite him to expositions, elect him a member of various > societies; they only pay a little money, but his glory grows. S. I. Mamontov > has left jail and also requires Misha‚Äôs sketches. The Demon Downcast was finished in December 1901 and displayed for several days in Moscow as an unfinished painting.  Exposition of Mir Iskusstva  In early 1902, The Demon Downcast was brought from Moscow to an exhibition organized by the society ‚ÄúMir Iskusstva‚Äù in Saint Petersburg. The painting made a real sensation. While the exposition was held, Vrubel came to this painting every morning, and until the noon, while there were few visitors, he redrew the demon, wiped away and imposed dyes, changed the figure's pose and the background, but most changes were made in the demon's face. Alexandre Benois, who had observed Vrubel's attempts to change the finished painting, wrote: > One can believe the Prince of the World posed for him. There is something > deeply true in these terrible and wonderful paintings, agitating to tears. > His Demon was faithful to his nature. He who came to love Vrubel still > deceived him. Those seances were entirely scorn and mockery. Vrubel saw now > one, now another side of his deity, now both of them, and in the pursuit > after that subtlety, he started quickly moving toward the abyss which his > passion for the occult pushed him to. Vladimir von Meck, one of the organizers of the exhibition, and his uncle Nikolai acquired many canvases of Vrubel's. This included a variant of Demon, when in 1902 the board of directors of the Tretyakov Gallery decided to not buy it. Later, in 1908, the Demon was sold to Tretyakov Gallery, where it is situated until now, being its most prominent exhibit. In early 1902, people around Vrubel began to notice symptoms of a developing mental disorder in him. His wife told her sister Ekaterina Ge about that as follows: > All relatives and acquaintances noticed something was going wrong with > Mikhail Aleksandrovich, but they still constantly doubted, because there was > never any nonsense in his speech; he recognized all, remembered all. He only > became much more self-confident, ceased feeling shy with people and spoke > incessantly. By that time, the painting Demon was brought to St. Petersburg > for an exposition of ‚ÄúMir Iskusstva‚Äù, and Mikhail Aleksandrovich, though the > painting was already on display, redrew it every day since the early > morning, and I saw with terror that there were changes every day. There were > days when Demon was very dreadful, and later deep sadness and new beauty > appeared in the expression of Demon‚Äôs face again‚Ä¶ In general, despite the > disorder, artistic ability did not leave Vrubel; it's even as though it > grew, but it already became unbearable to live with him. Finally, they had to institutionalize Vrubel with a mania. The painter would imagine himself as Christ, then Pushkin, and then believed he would become the General-Governor of Moscow; then he turned into the Russian sovereign, and then he suddenly became Skobelev or Phryne. He heard choirs of voices, claimed to have lived in the Renaissance age and painted walls in the Vatican together with Raphael and Michelangelo. Vrubel was examined by the psychiatrist Vladimir Bekhterev who first discovered the painter's mental disorder.  Other Demons  The image of a demon often appears in Mikhail Vrubel's art. In 1890 he drew the painting The Demon Seated. In 1899 he created The Demon Flying where the demon is depicted as a mighty ruler of the world.

The album was his first set of newly-recorded music since We Must Become the Pitiless Censors of Ourselves (2011). Recorded in two years at his Austin, Minnesota home, most of its subject matter concerns apocalyptic themes inspired by the newsfeed of world events he garnered while making the LP. Some of its song structures and melodies were created with the aid of an artificial neural network. The album received generally favorable reviews from critics, and was honored on numerous year-end lists by publications such as Uncut, The Wire, Fact, and Clash magazine. Commercially, the album peaked number 14 on Billboard's American Heatseekers Albums chart. Music videos were created for its three singles (\\"The Combine\\", \\"Teenage Witch\\", and \\"Touchdown\\").

Background After the favorable response to Maus' previous studio album We Must Become the Pitiless Censors of Ourselves (2011)‚Äîwhich was unprecedented for him‚Äîhe became more widely accepted as an outsider artist. He did not release any new music for the next six years. Two years were devoted to finishing his dissertation, while another two were spent learning how to build modular synthesizers. At the same time, he started experimenting with recreational drugs for the first time in his life, \\"going into sensory deprivation tanks and just trying any trick I could think of. I became solely obsessed with this at the expense of anything else.\\" His 338-page thesis \\"Communication and Control\\", which discussed the influence of technology on control societies, was completed and submitted in 2014, and he was thereby awarded his PhD in political science from the University of Hawaii.

It is an azooxanthellate coral, that is to say without symbiotic zooxanthellae . The species is native to deep waters around Antarctica. Description F. curvatum is a small, solitary coral growing to a height of some . The slit-like mouth of the fleshy polyp is surrounded by a whorl of tentacles. The polyp secretes the corallum, the stony skeleton which supports it. In this species, the corallum is not attached to the seabed, but may be semi-immersed in soft sediment. Distribution F. curvatum occurs in the Southern Ocean around Antarctica, but is also known from the southwestern Pacific Ocean and the southwestern Atlantic Ocean. It occurs on the continental slope, but it appears to have a disjunct distribution, with gaps between the various locations in which it has been found. It is a deep water coral, an azooanthellate species, the tissues of which do not harbour symbiotic algae. Its depth range is , with breeding corals off the west Antarctic Peninsula being at around . Biology The sexes are separate in F. curvatum, and like a number of other deep sea corals, the female broods its planular larvae. They are retained in the gastrovascular cavity where they are embedded in the mesenterial gastrodermis, with up to four per mesentery. Before they are released, the larvae have developed tentacle buds and an oral disc. In this and in other deep sea brooding corals, the oocytes are large (maximum diameter of 5120 Œºm in this species) and have large yolks to nourish the developing larvae. Fecundity is high, with a mean of 1618 oocytes per polyp. It is not clear why some scleractinian species brood their young, whereas others in similar habitats do not, but brooding does result in the ability of the larvae to settle almost immediately after liberation, and avoid a lengthy and risky planktonic stage. In some corals that brood their young, the larvae are released in batches along with quantities of mucus and often seem to be forced out by an expulsive effort by the polyp. This is not the case with F. curvatum; the larvae are released singly, without mucus, and appear to be wafted out by cilia on the wall of the polyp's pharynx. The larvae soon sink to the sea floor nearby, and some are found to settle on the corallum of an adult. Within days of expulsion they are upright, each with twelve stumpy tentacles, twelve pairs of mesenteries, an oral disc and a mouth. Newly settled juveniles have been found at various times of year, so breeding appears to take place at any time of year.

Unlike most other EF-mount lenses, it does not provide autofocus. Overview The TS-E 50 mm 2.8L MACRO provides four degrees of freedom, allowing ¬±8,5¬∞ tilt with respect to the film or sensor plane and ¬±12 mm shift with respect to the center of the image area; each movement can be rotated ¬±90¬∞ about the lens axis. Shifting allows adjusting the position of the subject in the image area without moving the camera back; it is often used to avoid convergence of parallel lines, such as when photographing a tall building. Tilting the lens relies on the Scheimpflug principle to rotate the plane of focus away from parallel to the image plane; this can be used either to have all parts of an inclined subject sharply rendered, or to restrict sharpness to a small part of a scene. Tilting the lens results in a wedge- shaped depth of field that may be a better fit to some scenes than the depth of field between two parallel planes that results without tilt. Unlike most view cameras, the shift mechanism allows shifts along only one axis, and the tilt mechanism allows tilts about only one axis; however, the rotation of the mechanisms allows the orientations of the axes to be changed, providing, in effect, combined tilt and swing, and combined rise/fall and lateral shift. The TS-E 50 mm 2.8L MACRO was the first lens from Canon which combining Macro and tilt-shift. It was announced together with a series of lenses, the TS-E 90 mm f/2.8L MACRO and the TS-E 135mm f/4L MACRO, which introduced the same features.

It was constructed to link the Wigan coalfield to the Liverpool and Manchester Railway (L&MR;). Background The Wigan Branch Railway obtained an Act of Parliament on 29 May 1830 to build a branch line from the Liverpool and Manchester Railway L&MR; at Parkside to Wigan. The Act included another branch off the Wigan line (the Springs branch) to collieries in the district. The Act stipulated that the railway must be built by L&MR; engineers and in June 1830 Charles Vignoles was appointed engineer at a salary of ¬£500 (equivalent to ¬£ in ). He was familiar with the area having been involved with the L&MR.; The line was promoted by a number of Wigan coal proprietors, one of whom, Ralph Thickness was the first chairman. The railway from Parkside on the L&MR; ran to Chapel Lane in Wigan. The Parkside station was inconvenient for Wigan Branch passengers as it was on the Liverpool side of the junction and the branch tracks ran onto the L&MR; in the Manchester direction (that is only east curve into the L&MR; was constructed). The line was constructed by contractors Pritchard & Hoof who were awarded a two year maintenance contract. The Springs branch was not constructed at this time due to a lack of funds. Operations The line opened to traffic on 3 September 1832. The intention had been to construct a double track railway but money was in short supply and the line was constructed as a single track with three passing loops per mile, provision was made for a later doubling of the track. The railway opened with two stations. *Parkside station was opened by the L&MR; on 15 September 1830. *Wigan Chapel Lane station was the only station opened by the WBR, it opened on 3 September 1832 and closed on 31 October 1838 when it was replaced by Wigan station opened by the North Union Railway further north when its line opened. Wigan station was renamed Wigan North Western railway station on 2 June 1924. In what was a unique arrangement, the Wigan Branch Railway did not to hire its own staff or provide motive power and rolling stock. Instead the line was worked by the L&MR.; Parkside station was the terminus of the Wigan Branch Railway with passengers changing onto L&MR; trains to get to Liverpool or Manchester. Some colliery owners ran their own goods trains, Thomas Legh transported coal and coke from his Haydock Collieries to Edge Hill, Liverpool and to Liverpool Road, Manchester provided he used his own locomotives and wagons because he had an arrangement with the L&MR; to use their railway. The railway announced in October 1832 that it would begin moving goods along the line and constructed a warehouse at Wigan for this purpose. In 1834 the railway decided to offer John Hargreaves, an established carrier in the north west, the lease for carrying freight. Hargreaves, in partnership with his son (also John Hargreaves) declined and made a counter offer which was accepted by the North Union Railway who by then had taken over the railway. By 1838, the branch line had been doubled to facilitate an onward extension from Wigan to Preston. Merger The construction of the Preston and Wigan Railway was authorised in 1831 but construction was delayed. The directors of the Wigan Branch Railway and Preston and Wigan Railway decided to merge and an Act of Parliament gained royal assent on 22 May 1834 incorporating the two merged railways as the North Union Railway. Later years In October 1838 a new station opened at Parkside on the Manchester side of the junction which improved the interchange between the railways. The station was jointly constructed by the L&MR;, the North Union Railway and the Grand Junction Railway. The former station became a goods station. Parkside junction acquired a west curve in 1847 facilitating the running of through trains. The Springs branch to the New Springs area of Wigan was opened by the North Union Railway in 1838. The North Union Railway opened Golborne station in about 1839, it was renamed Golborne South on 1 February 1949 and closed on 6 February 1961. In 1847 the L&NWR; opened a west curve onto the L&MR; and a station was opened at the juncture of the two curves in 1849. In its early days it was sometimes known as North Union Junction, sometimes as Preston Junction before being renamed to Lowton & Preston Junction on 1 February 1877 and finally in 1880, the station closed on 26 September 1949. station was opened on 1 April 1878 by the L&NWR; and closed on 27 November 1950.

He wrote in Gujarati and was primarily responsible for the development of surreal and experimental Gujarati fiction.  Life  Kishore Jadav with his wife Kumsangkola Kishore Jadav with his wife and children Kishore Jadav was born on 15 April 1938 in Ambaliala village of Dholka Taluka in Ahmedabad district, Gujarat, to Kalidas and Dahiben Jadav. He matriculated in 1955 from R.C. Commerce High School, Ahmedabad, and completed a Bachelor of Commerce from Maharaja Sayajirao University of Baroda in 1960. In 1963, he moved to Nagaland. In 1972, he completed a Masters of Commerce from Gauhati University and later received a Ph.D. from California International University for his research work American Black Writers. He was awarded a Doctor of Letters by Harmony College of Applied Science, California, US. From 1965 to 1982, he worked as a secretary with various departments of the Government of Nagaland. In 1967 he married Kumsangkola, a Naga tribal girl. They had two sons and three daughters. Jadav served as a secretary to the Chief Secretary of the Government of Nagaland in 1982 and retired in 1995. He also served as a Registrar of Nagaland University, and later retired as the Special Secretary. He served as a chairman of the Northeast Literary Academy from its foundation in 1976 until 1981 and later served as its vice president. He was a fellow and deputy governor of the American Biographical Institute. He lived in Kohima until his retirement in 1995, then moved to Dimapur, Nagaland. Kumsangkola died in 2011. Jadav died on 1 March 2018 in Dimapur following kidney failure and a stroke.  Works  Jadav experimented with fiction and adopted a surrealistic style of narration. His short stories were first published in Ruchi, a magazine edited by Gujarati author Chunilal Madia. Jadav adopted an unconventional and opposing style to the traditional short stories written in Gujarati, focusing on the depiction of the inner world and character emotion rather than a realistic external world. His story Labyrinth is a notable example of this approach. His first short story collection, Pragaitihasik and Shoksabha (1969), features 20 experimental stories. Its recurring character, Vinayak ( anti-hero), appears in many of the subsequent stories. Suryarohan (1972) includes 17 stories while Chhadmavesh (1982) has 8 stories. His stories are anthologised in Kishore Jadavni Vartao ‚Äì Aswad Sahit (1982) and Kishore Jadavni Shreshth Varato (1990, 2009), both edited by Radheshyam Sharma. His fourth collection, Yugsabha, was published in 1995. Nishachakra (1979) was his first experimental novel. Its main character, Hu (lit. I, myself), encounters three different women with whom he engages in illicit affairs. Sexual behaviour is depicted in the eighth chapter of the novel. Jadav used narrative stream of consciousness in this novel. Nagaland culture is also depicted in his fiction. Riktarag (1989) also depicts a protagonist in relationships with three ladies, but the world explores a more tragic dimension. Jadav's other novels are Aatash (1993), Chihnakand, and Kathatrayi (1998). Navi Tunki Vartani Kalamimansa (1986) is his critical work on modern short stories, written in response to questions about the morality of his own stories. Kmiyev (1995) is his other work of criticism. Kimartham (1995) is a collection of his interviews. He has also published four books in English and two in Hindi.  Awards  Jadav received accolades and awards from Gujarati Sahitya Parishad and the Gujarat Sahitya Academy.

Their musical style is often referred to as post-metal and doom metal, with obvious influence of sludge metal, ambient, and post-rock. They are known for prominent live performances that feature controversial symbols such as a horned mask and crown of thorns, and intensive use of greasepaint. Their debut album \\"It Is Not The Night That Covers You\\" was released in 2016 and became critically acclaimed in Belarus and beyond.  History  The band was formed in 2012 as a temporary project of 5 musicians, aimed to fill the lineup of a local rock festival which would have been cancelled otherwise. However, having been well accepted by the audience, the band decided to continue their activity after the festival. The name \\"Nebulae Come Sweet\\" was taken from a poem written by the band's frontman. In 2013 Nebulae Come Sweet released a split album and started playing live shows as a trio. In order to provoke the audience, the band covered themselves in black greasepaint and used such elements as Petrine Cross, crown of thorns, or a horned Lucifer's mask. The band states that the usage of those symbols in their performances started as a mere way of standing out, but later they built a concept around it. In early 2016, the band released their second EP \\"Ophelia\\" that contained two alternative versions of the track previously released, the lyrics in which were inspired by the story of Shakespear's Ophelia. Later that year the band released their debut LP \\"It Is Not The Night That Covers You\\". It features a number of session musicians, as well as guest vocals from Christopher Bennett of Illinois-based metal band Minsk on the track \\"T\\", and from Kristoffer B√§ckstr√∂m of Swedish sludge band Moloken on \\"Santa Sangre\\". In early 2017, the release was followed by a live presentation in the band's hometown Minsk. With strings being an important part of the band's sound, they were joined by a cellist, thus becoming a four-piece outfit. As a quartet, they have performed a number of gigs across Russia and Belarus, and a tour around Ukraine. In autumn of 2017, Nebulae Come Sweet embarked on their first European tour with such doom metal bands as Frailty, Psilocybe Larvae, and Woe Unto Me. In 2018 the band played a number of shows in Belarus and Russia, including opening for Belgian black-metal outfit Wiegedood. . In the beginning of 2019 Nebulae Come Sweet announced new permanent band members, which made them a five-piece band., They also teased the recording process of their second album, although its release date remains unknown. In May 2019 they played their first acoustic show in Minsk, with 6 old and 1 new track in acoustic arrangement. The show enjoyed warm welcome from the audience and acclamation from Belarusian media., , ,  Discography   Studio albums  * \\"It Is Not The Night That Covers You\\" (2016, self-released)  Splits  * Split with Difleger (2013, self-released)  Extended plays  * \\"Ophelia\\" (2016, self- released)  Compillation appearances  * \\"Electric Funeral Cafe Vol.III\\" (2017, Robustfellow Prods.)
