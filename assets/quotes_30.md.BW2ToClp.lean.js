The film is inspired by the 2007 American supernatural horror film Paranormal ActivityEkta's Ragini MMS inspired from Paranormal activity ‚Äì Hindustan Times and is partly based on the real story of a girl from Delhi named Deepika.

The door is answered by Ragini's friend. After asking Uday where they were going and getting no response, Ragini's friend gets upset and wants Uday to leave their house immediately. Uday doesn't listen and then wakes up Ragini from her sleep while ignoring her friend and tells her to get ready for their weekend getaway.They then travel by car the whole day and arrive at Uday's 'house' - a mysterious abandoned house at a deserted location. Ragini's mom calls Ragini to know her whereabouts but Ragini lies and cuts the call. Uday is involved in the hideous business of making and selling sex tapes of innocent girls. This time, he has got Ragini who thinks that he loves her, but in reality Uday is using her so he can make money. They then try to eat the dinner that they bought to the house along with them, however after seeing that the parcel had insects in it, they throw it out. They then move to the bedroom to attempt to have sex but are interrupted by a knock at the door. Ragini's friend Pia, and her boyfriend Vishal have come to visit them. Furious by their visit, Uday tells Ragini to get rid of them. But eventually, they stay for a while. After a while, Vishal asks Uday for a way to the bathroom and Uday tells him the way. Seeing a dark way to the bathroom, Vishal tells Uday that a woman used to live in the house whom her family members called witch and murdered her. After which, her spirit came alive and murdered her whole family and since then, her spirit is living at the house. At this, sensing that it is a joke, Uday starts laughing and walks away. Then Vishal is seen staring at a wall and then he enters the house from the front door as if he fell down. Sensing that something is majorly wrong with the house, Pia and Vishal leave in a hurry. Afterwards, Uday turns on the cameras without informing Ragini and ties her hands to the bed and begins to have sex with Ragini. But he is pulled by his hairs by someone. Afraid by this, he checks the room thoroughly but finds no one. He and Ragini begin to hear some noises and Uday says in Marathi that \\"I am not a witch\\". He then goes out to check the clumsy noises. He returns in a strange, frightful condition and stained with blood. Ragini instantly asks him to open her hands up but Uday is scared and out of his mind. Ragini, terribly frightened by the thought of some provoked evil spirit at this hour of night, begs Uday to unlock the handcuffs. While searching for the keys, Uday eventually drops his bag which was covering the camera and the camera comes into view of Ragini. Ragini eventually begins to know that Uday was filming a sex tape of her, to which she then reacted with pure terror, shock and anger. Uday tries to open the handcuffs with other items but suddenly something happens and Ragini gets the view of blood sunk Uday near the bed. Ragini tries to reach for the keys but is unable to do so. Some boys pass by but are not able to respond to Ragini's screams for help as the front door was locked. Suddenly, Uday picks up a pointed object and inserts it in his neck thus killing himself. Terrified by this, Ragini screams for help but no one hears her. She tries to break the bed but in vain. The night is over but she stays like that unable to open her cuffs. She then finds a piece of glass and cuts her hand to get out of the handcuffs for lubrication and after releasing herself, she runs towards the car. Upon finding the car, she sees the body of Vishal and tries to start the car but is pulled out of the car. And she then finds the body of Pia. Then someone pulls her by her hair and takes her back to the house. She sits there and the spirit then hangs her to wall for many days. The film ends in anonymous situation. In the end, it is shown that a boy found Ragini unconscious and she has to psychiatric treatment for 10 months. It can be assumed that the story is open ended and a warning for the innocent girls to be extra cautious while falling into trap of negative people.

Encyclopedia, Volume 2; NDB says Wismar - 12 May 1525,Last documented alive on May 11, 1525. Earlier literature indicated April 28, May 5 or 6, but this is incorrect. She was buried on May 15, 1525 R√∂delheim) was by marriage Landgravine of Hesse. She was a daughter of Duke Magnus II of Mecklenburg (1441‚Äì1503), and Sophie of Pomerania-Stettin (about 1460 ‚Äì 1504). She was a member of the 13th Generation of the Princely House of Mecklenburg.  Life  \\"The historian has to give the landgravine a prominent place in the Hessian history\\", historian Hans Glagau wrote in 1899. Landgravine Anna of Hesse, born Duchess of Mecklenburg, would be worthy of a historical-critical biography. So far, however, an adequate representation of personality and life of the landgravine has not emerged. In 1500, Anna married William II of Hesse (1469‚Äì1509). She was his second wife. Due to the early death of the ruler of Upper Hesse, William III (1471‚Äì1500), and the insanity of the Regent of Lower Hesse, William I (1466‚Äì1515), all of Hesse, including the county of Katzenelnbogen, was reunited in 1500 under William II. But Wilhelm II fell ill in 1504 ‚Äì probably syphilis ‚Äì and was incapable of governing in the following years. In his first will (dated 1506), he appointed a Council of five guardians for his children Elisabeth (1502‚Äì1557) and Philip I (1504‚Äì1567) as well as his brother William I, his brother's wife Anna of Brunswick, and for his own wife. In his second testament (dated 1508), he determined, however, that Anna would be guardian (next to his uncle, Hermann of Cologne, who died in September 1508) and appointed two counselors to assist her. However, Anna's claim to the regency was not recognized by the Estates of the Landgraviate of Hesse, nor by Saxony. In July 1509 there was a debate between Anna and the Hessian Estates, who were supported by the Saxon dukes. The second will was not recognized. During this period Anna lived at her Wittum in Gie√üen with her daughter Elisabeth, while her son Philip remained in Kassel under the supervision of Ludwig von Boyneburg to Lengsfeld. She was financially dependent on the Council and did not receive much money. This is evident among other things, an incident in 1512. In that year, Anna's sister Catherine married Duke Henry IV of Saxony. On this occasion, Anna wanted to introduce her daughter Elisabeth at the Saxon court, as she had been promised at a very early age to John, the eldest son of George the Bearded. Anna requested some damask for a proper dress from the council, but the request was denied. Anna then decided not to take her daughter to Dresden, because of her \\"shabby clothes\\". Things changed in 1514: Anna came to power with the support of many nobles and cities. She was never officially recognized as a regent, but she ruled even past 1519, the year her son Philip was declared of age by Emperor Maximilian I. We know very little about the last years of her life. In 1519 she married a second time, with the 23-year-old Count Otto of Solms- Laubach, who died three years later.  Offspring  Anna first married on 20 October 1500 in Kassel the Landgrave William II of Hesse (1469‚Äì1509) with whom she had the following children: * Elisabeth (1502‚Äì1557) * Magdalena (1503‚Äì1504) * Philip I (1504‚Äì1567) On 7 September 1519 she married Count Otto of Solms-Laubach (1496‚Äì1522), a second marriage: * Maria (1520‚Äì1522) *Frederick Magnus I (1521‚Äì1561) * Anna (1522‚Äì1594)  Importance  Anna of Hesse's life is interesting from the point of view of theological history, because she directly influenced the time before the introduction of the Reformation in Hesse by Philip I in 1527. Her husband had ordered reforms in all monasteries in Hesse in his will. Anna tried to implement these reforms in some places, but the reforms only succeeded during Philip's rule, albeit he implemented them in his own way. It would seem very important for church historians to investigate Anna's influence on church policies and the church in Hesse in the Reformation in Hesse and elsewhere. She herself has worked tirelessly for the monasteries and Catholicism, causing a discord with her son. The topic is important in a broader perspective, because it is about a period in the history of Hesse that hasn't been studied much in the past: the late Middle Ages, just before the Reformation, from the perspective of a prominent female regent. The chaotic conditions in Hesse during the years 1509‚Äì1518 were caused by the fact that no legitimate ruler was available, and power had to be exercised by a woman. Also interesting in this context is the political delicacy of the conflicts between different interest groups: the Estates, Anna and Philip, the advisors appointed by William's will, the emperor and the princes of Saxony.

Early career Adams began his foray into the arts by making stringed musical instruments such as guitars, banjos, basses, and dulcimers after he was introduced to the craft as an ethnomusicology student under Dr. Joel Maring at Southern Illinois University Carbondale. Adams has been commissioned to build instruments by Daryl Hall, members of Stevie Wonder's band as well as other well known musicians. He has twelve albums out in multiple genres and can be heard on Siriusxm music, Music Choice, Apple Music, Spotify and Pandora Radio where he has over 101 million streams. In May 2016 his most recent album, Imaginings, won Best Contemporary Instrumental Album of the year at the Zone Music Reporter Awards in New Orleans. The follow up album Deeper Imaginings, a collaboration with Australian musician was released in November 2019. Composing In the 1980s, Adams decided to start composing music and got a label deal with Nature Recordings/World Disc (now defunct). His first album, Various Waves, was placed in the Top Five of the Year by the syndicated Radio Show Musical Starstreams in the 1990s. The Metro Silicon Valley stated that \\"Adams is perhaps the most important New Age musician since George Winston.\\" Adams left the label after his first release in order to produce music in genres other than New Age. He spent some time working with John Golden of Centerfield Productions, whose main focus was the band jazz band Steps Ahead. Centerfield (now defunct) re-released Adams' second album, Wonder Dancing on Global Bop. After Centerfield folded, Adams took back control of his music. In Tower Records' Pulse!, John Diliberto, the host of the Echoes radio program, called Adams' guitar playing on Wonder Dancing on Global Bop \\"Willfully eclectic with scintillating fretwork immersed in Latin African rhythms.\\" Adams' eight other album titles would fit in genres such as jazz, world fusion, acoustic, ambient, and eclectic. He has said that staying confined to one music style does hurt the connection to an audience. But he feels making variations of one style would be like a painter painting sea shores for an entire career. The Property of Water was completed using computer music pioneer Laurie Spiegel's intelligent computer music program called The Music Mouse (now out of production). It was then blended with Adams' acoustic built instruments as well as personally recorded sounds in nature. Laurie commented it was a \\"wondrous blend of silicon and wood\\". A View From the Plain is an aural painting of the land utilizing finger style guitar and all acoustic instruments such as Guitar, Dulcimer, Fiddle, Banjo and Dobro. In The Land Where I Come From was a venting of lyric compositions bathed in pop, jazz, and poetic recitations. This Christmas also focused on traditional holiday tunes supported with similar instrumentation found on A View From the Plain. He followed with three albums utilizing exotic world instrumentation and Native American and Indian flutes that are aimed for those wanting to slow down the pace of our world (Flute Meditations For Dreaming Clouds, Heavens, and Sleep). The album Sleep won Native American album of the year at the Zone Music Reporter awards in New Orleans in 2013. His album Imaginings won Zone Music Reporter Contemporary album of the year in 2016. It was a foray in to world music with Pravin Godkhindi, the wondrous Australian musician Elizabeth Geyer, and David Hoffman. A follow up album entitled Deeper Imaginings, a collaboration with Elizabeth Geyer was released in November 2019. Also on the album is Pravin Godkhindi, former Gentle Giant guitarist Gary Green and Alp Akmaz on Balabad (An beautiful instrument that sounds similar to the Daduk).http://www.zonemusicreporter.com/admin/2015award_finalists.asp Producing Adams also works as a producer and was part of the production team that released independent music titles by David Hoffman, the trumpet soloist and occasional arranger for The Ray Charles Orchestra until Charles' death. Adams started a sideline band called THE NEURONS with Hoffman that focused on more aggressive and exotic improvised ethnic music designed to work with multimedia. They worked extensively with The Illinois Ballet and live dance. Hobbies Adams is also a poet and has utilized poetic readings in some of his music. He has also worked as a writer on various subjects such as mental health issues, as well as philosophical and spiritual topics. He has interviewed such artists as Tony Levin and Kazu Matsui for various independent publications. Adams cites his experience working in the mental health profession along with his music as being his deepest artistic influence.

Impact The film is primarily regarded for being one of the few non- pornographic works starring lead actress Shannon Wilsey (who later took on the name Savannah). The film's reception had a profoundly negative impact on the actress; despite the fact that it was well received for its comedic merits, she felt mortified about her performance. In an interview for the E! True Hollywood Story documentary on the life of the actress, former boyfriend Billy Sheehan recounted how Wilsey was utterly humiliated during the film's premiere. Whenever the audience would laugh at one of her lines she could not differentiate whether they were laughing at her personally or the character. The experience forever marred Wilsey on a personal level and she soon afterwards resigned herself to pursue a career exclusively in the adult entertainment industry. She rose to the highest auspices of the adult entertainment world, becoming the indisputable \\"porn queen\\", though her life was forever fraught with personal disappointments and drug addiction, which eventually culminated in her suicide in 1994. She was 23 years old at the time of her death.

It is recorded in the National Heritage List for England as a designated Grade I listed building, and is under the care of the Churches Conservation Trust. The church is in Strand Street towards the north end of the town. Early history St Mary's stands on the site of a convent established by Domneva in 664‚Äì73. This was destroyed by the Danes, and rebuilt by Emma, wife of King Canute. Following the Norman conquest the church was rebuilt again. At this stage it consisted of a nave with north and south aisles, a chancel, a central tower and, possibly, transepts. The chancel was rebuilt in about 1200. The church was damaged by the French in 1217 and again in 1457, and by an earthquake in 1578. In 1667 the central tower collapsed, destroying the nave arcades. It was rebuilt again, with a wide roof covering the nave and the south aisle. In 1714 a belfry was built on the porch, and galleries were added in the middle of the 18th century. The church was restored in 1869‚Äì74 by Joseph Clarke. Architecture=Exterior= The church is constructed in a variety of materials, mainly flint and stone. The roofs are tiled. Its plan consists of a wide nave and chancel, with a north aisle, and north and south porches. The south porch is in the form of a tower, with a flint lower stage and a brick upper stage. On top of the porch is a small weatherboarded belfry with a pyramidal cap. =Interior= The north aisle is divided from the nave by a large timber arcade. This replaced the arcade destroyed by the collapse of the tower, and the polygonal timber posts stand on the 14th-century bases of the earlier arcade. The octagonal font is dated 1662, and its bowl is carved with quatrefoils. The 18th-century pulpit is polygonal, standing on a 19th-century base, and was formally part of a three-decker pulpit. The altarpiece is large and consists of a broken pediment on fluted pilasters. It was installed in 1756, and formerly held panels containing the Ten Commandments and the Creed that are now hanging on the north wall. Also on the wall of the church are the Royal Arms of Charles II dated 1660. In the aisle are 18th-century benches moved from Gopsall Hall in 1956. The altar in the aisle was formerly in St Mildred's Church, Canterbury, and the main altar dates from 1956. From the medieval period are niches, an aumbry, and floor tiles. In the north wall is a late-14th-century tomb recess. The memorials include a wall tablet dated 1606, and a wall monument dated 1808 by Westmacott. The stained glass dates from the 19th and 20th centuries. It includes 19th-century windows by Ward and Hughes, and windows in the north aisle dated 1933 by Morris & Co. External features The boundary walls of the churchyard have been designated as a Grade II listed building. The walls on the north, west and east sides are constructed in brick, flint and stone, and date from the medieval period and the 17th century. The south wall is of stone and flint, and dates from the Victorian period. Recent history and present day In 1948 the parish of St Mary's was combined with two other parishes, and the church became disused. It was planned to demolish the church in 1956, but it was restored and was vested in the Churches Conservation Trust in 1985. Sandwich St. Mary's Community Trust was registered as a charity in 1997, and it works in association with the Friends of St. Mary's to manage the building, to improve its facilities, and to arrange events. The building is used for weddings, concerts, exhibitions, and other events, and is known as St. Mary's Arts Centre. The church is still consecrated and services are occasionally held.

Creative tensions between director Scott Spiegel and one of the film's producers, Brad Wyman, resulted in Spiegel being replaced by another director, Adam Rifkin, three weeks into production. Wyman later stated that he regretted firing Spiegel and blamed it on the fact that he (Wyman) \\"wasn't a very good producer at the time.\\" As a result, the writers of this film - Sam Raimi, Ivan Raimi, Bruce Campbell, and Scott Spiegel - were so embarrassed with the end result that they all used pseudonyms instead of their own names in the credits. Release The film was released theatrically in Germany on September 10, 1992 and was not released in the United States until the summer of 1995, where it was released directly to videocassette. Two DVD releases followed. The first in 1999, where it was released by Image Entertainment and the second in 2005, where it was released by Ardustry Entertainment. In Australia, it was released on VHS as The Nutty Nut.

Lenga is found in the Pipo River Valley and some parts of southern mountain slopes and may be thickly set and reach great heights. Chinese lantern, hemiparasite and Pande Indian or Llao Llao, which are fungus parasites, are found over the branches of the trees. Cinnamon is also reported in many small forest areas of the park. Peat bogs extensively found in the park. These are made up of sphagnum moss and aquatic grasses in damp valleys where low temperatures and slow moving acidic waters prevent decomposition. The flower varieties found are calafate, chaura and michay, which are orange coloured.

It is bounded on the west by the Chilean border, on the north by Lago Fagnano, and on the south by the Beagle Channel, which forms the shoreline. It encompasses an area of and represents two ecoregions: the Altos Andes and the Patagonian Forest. While the former ecoregion is made up of hill ranges and slopes, the latter has high and jagged mountains, glacier valleys and semi-deciduous forests. The landscape of the park is the result of glacial erosion, which has created bays and beaches against a backdrop of rugged mountains and valleys.GreenJani2006,p.494 Beagle Channel in Ushuaia The park is located to the west of the city of Ushuaia, on National Road 3. Ushuaia provides the main approach to the park through the highway or through the Southern Fuegian Railway. Beagle Channel The Beagle Channel or strait in Tierra del Fuego National Park is named after the British ship HMS Beagle, which sailed with the naturalist Charles Darwin aboard in 1833‚Äì34. The channel separates islands of the Tierra del Fuego Archipelago, in extreme southern South America. It separates Isla Grande de Tierra del Fuego from the islands of Nueva, Picton, Navarino, Hoste, Londonderry, Stewart, and other smaller islands to the south. It is oriented in an east-west direction, runs for a length of . Its width varies from . The biggest settlement on the channel is Ushuaia in Argentina followed by Puerto Williams in Chile, two of the southernmost settlements in the world. Ancient middens where Yaghan tribes lived are seen on the beaches around the Beagle Channel. Lago Fagnano Lago Fagnano (named after the Salesian monk Jos√© Fagnano), also known as Cami Lake, the southernmost lake of its size outside Antarctica, is the largest lake in Tierra del Fuego and flows southward along the eastern slope of the Andean Cordillera of Patagonia into the Magellan Strait through the Azopardo River. It is hemmed in the active tectonic plate (linked to the Magallanes- Fagnano fault) boundary between the South American and Scotia plates. Its East-West orientation in the southern part of Isla Grande de Tierra del Fuego encompasses the national territories of Argentina and Chile; only a small part of the lake lies in Chile. Its evolution is attributed to constant glaciation during the late Pliocene and Pleistocene era. The lake has a total drainage area of with basin elevation ranging from at the lake level to about . The lake water spreads over an area of about , with an average width of (maximum width is over a length of long and the maximum recorded depth is , with an average depth reported as . Its water volume is . =Climate= The park experiences a temperate climate with frequent rain, fog and strong winds. Westerly winds over the sea maintain a uniform climate in the park. The average annual rainfall is . Peak rainfall (snowfall at higher elevations) occurs from March through May; there is no dry season. Average temperatures are about in winter and in the summer. At Ushuaia, the recorded mean annual temperature reported is with maximum monthly mean of and minimum of . History Period impression of navigating along Tierra del Fuego, 1833 =Etymology= The first Europeans who came to explore the southern tip of South America saw the campfires of the native inhabitants of the area (the Yaghan people, also called Y√°mana). The Spanish explorers hence named the area \\"Tierra del Fuego\\", meaning \\"land of fire\\" in Spanish. =Pre-Columbian= Humans inhabited Tierra del Fuego as far back as 10,000 years ago. The Yaghan people, living in the harsh environment, survived on the natural resources of the sea. They lived on its beaches and made voyages into the sea in canoes made of lenga beech, hunted sea lions and collected shellfish. They lived in huts made of tree branches and trunks and clothed themselves with leather made from sea lion pelts. They smeared their body with the fat and grease of these animals to waterproof their skins. The southern group of the Selk‚Äônam, the Yaghan people (also known as Y√°mana), occupied what is now Ushuaia, living in continual conflict with the northern inhabitants of the island. =Post- Columbian= Wasti H. Stirling, an Anglican missionary, settled here in 1870 and started to convert Yaghan tribes, the natives, the original residents of the Beagle Channel. During the 1880s, many gold prospectors came to Ushuaia, following rumors of large gold fields, which proved to be false. Trouble for the Yaghan people began in 1880, when European missionaries entered the area. European settlers brought diseases such as measles, causing a rapid and nearly complete extinction of the Yaghan people. The Yaghan tribe was reduced in number from about 3,000 people in 1880 to less than 100 by the 1990s. Many of them were killed by European settlers' \\"shoot exercises\\" and deliberate poisoning to exploit the sea lions, the staple of the Yaghan diet. Following the death of 84-year-old Emelinda Acu√±a (1921 ‚Äì 12 October 2005), only one native speaker remains, Cristina Calder√≥n of Villa Ukika on Navarino Island, Chile. What can be seen of the Yaghan people and their settlements today are mainly relics in the form of piles of mussel shells overgrown with grass near the seashore. Some antiquarian links with the tribals can also be seen in the \\"End of the World Museum\\" in Ushuaia. The Boundary Treaty of 1881 was an attempted resolution of the territorial dispute between Argentina and Chile, and stipulated that the boundary between the two countries would run south from \\"Cape Espiritu Santo, on the northern shore of Tierre del Fuego till it touches the Beagle Channel\\". This division meant that Argentina would be entitled to the eastern portion while Chile would have the western part of the Tierre del Fuego. However, the Treaty did not clarify on the terminus of the Beagle channel, which created many territorial and collateral issues such as navigation rights. This resulted in a dispute between the two countries, particularly on the small islands (Picton, Lennox and Nueva) up to Cape horn. The dispute, which started in 1840, almost resulted in war between the two countries in 1978. However, with the intervention of the Vatican the issue was resolved. The Pope ruled on the dispute, a ratification ensued and a treaty was signed on 2 May 1985. Under this treaty, Chile retained control of all the disputed islands and Argentina was entitled to the navigational rights and maintained their limited presence on these islands. After an Argentine naval base was established in 1884, the island was divided between Argentina and Chile. Argentinian President Roca established a penal colony in 1902, on nearby Staten Island, which resulted in its development. Prisoners were the main work force and were employed to construct the city and exploit the forests of the now Tierra del Fuego National Park. The train lines were also built by the prisoners, covering an area of , which started from the Maip√∫ Monte Susana camp and ran through the park. The city is now an important tourist center as the departure point not only for the park but also for voyages to Antarctica. Following the establishment of a prison in Ushuaia, in late 1909 and early 1910 the railway line called the Southern Fuegian Railway or the End of the World train was established as a narrow gauge steam railway, replacing an old wood track railway drawn by bullocks. The steam engine driven railway was built over a length of along the Maipu Avenue on the water front, followed the eastern slope of Mount Susana and branched through the middle of the Pipo River valley into the Tierra del Fuego National Park. The line made with Decauville tracks of gauge, connected the prison camp with the forestry camp. The primary purpose of the railway was as a freight line to serve the prison of Ushuaia, and hence was known as the \\"Prison train,\\" and was used specifically to transport prisoners to the camps and transport the logged timber from forests. The prison was closed in 1947, and the railway was finally closed in 1952, following the reduction in forest resources and an earthquake that damaged the tracks. Tourism There are several attractions within the park including: Beagle Channel, the Pipo River cascade, the Lago Fagnano, Lago Roca, the Ensanada Bay, the Lapataia Bay, the End of the World Train, and the Laguna Negra. =End of the World train= Southern Fuegian Railway in winter In 1994, 40 years after it had been closed as a Prison train, the train was revived, refurbished with modern amenities, used as a heritage train, and claimed to be the southernmost functioning railway in the world. A new 2-6-2T steam locomotive (Camila, brought from England in 1995), another made in Argentina and three diesel locomotives serve on the line. The park can now be reached from the outskirts of Ushuaia from the Fin del Mundo station ( west of Ushuaia) by the heritage railway line and runs over , covering the distance in about 50 minutes.

The community takes its name from the unsolved murder of a local woman. Origin of the name On July 6, 1905, a schoolteacher named Katie DeWitt James filed for divorce. The next day, she carried her 14-month-old daughter Lulu Belle to a train station in Custer City. James was going to visit her cousin who lived in Ripley. Her father Henry DeWitt came to bid farewell; her husband Martin James did not come to the station. A few weeks later, Henry became concerned that he had not heard from his daughter. He contacted a sheriff, who suggested hiring a detective named Sam Bartell. Bartell started his investigation from Clinton, but nobody remembered seeing a woman and a baby there. Then on July 28, 1905 in Weatherford, Bartell learned that James and the baby spent a night in the house of William Moore. They were brought to this house by Moore's sister-in-law Fannie Norton, a resident of Clinton who also was known as Mrs. Ham, and reputed to be a prostitute. In the morning Norton, James, and the baby left in a buggy, headed for Hydro. Eyewitnesses reported that buggy entered a field near Deer Creek, and Norton came out alone approximately 45 minutes later. Norton returned to Moore's house, and then back to Clinton. Later, Bartell discovered that two women and the baby were seen around Deer Creek. The detective also was able to find the baby. The witness testified that Norton left the baby with a boy, and asked him to take the baby home. The baby was unharmed, but her clothing was covered with blood. While locals searched for James, Bartell tracked down Norton, who denied she murdered James. Later that day, Norton committed suicide by poison. On August 31, 1905, James' remains were found near Deer Creek, about twenty miles east of Clinton. Her head was severed from her body. James' father confirmed these were remains of his daughter. Martin James took custody of his daughter. The murder was never solved.

The claim was denied, both by the opposing campaign and the Electoral Commission and Political Studies Association. In April 2011, cabinet minister Chris Huhne threatened legal action over alleged untruths disseminated by Conservatives opposed to the alternative vote system. On the day of the referendum, it was reported in the New Statesman that David Blunkett had admitted that the claim that introducing the AV system would be more expensive had been exaggerated.

CDDB was then spun off of Escient and in July 2000 was renamed Gracenote. (currently offline, accessed via archive.org) In 1999, freedb, an open source clone of the Gracenote CDDB service, was created by former CDDB users as a non- commercial alternative. The track listing database freedb used to seed its new service was based on the data released for public use by CDDB. The CDDB database license was later changed to include new terms. For instance, any programs using a CDDB lookup had to display a CDDB logo while performing the lookup. In March 2001, only licensed applications were provided access to the Gracenote database. New licenses for CDDB1 (the original version of CDDB) were no longer available, so programmers using Gracenote services were required to switch to CDDB2 (a new version incompatible with CDDB1). To some, the decision was controversial because the CDDB database was started with the voluntary submission of CD track data by thousands of individual users. Initially, most of these were users of the xmcd CD player program. The xmcd program itself was an open-source, GPL project. Many listing contributors believed that the database was open-source as well, because in 1997, cddb.com's download and support pages had said it was released under the GPL. (currently offline, accessed via archive.org) (currently offline, accessed via archive.org) CDDB claims that license grant was an error.  Patent application  In July 1999 CDDB filed an application for a United States patent, titled Method and System for Finding Approximate Matches in Database. The patent is described as: :\\"Entertainment content complementary to a musical recording is delivered to a user's computer by means of a computer network link. The user employs a browser to access the computer network. A plug-in for the browser is able to control an audio CD or other device for playing the musical recording. A script stored on the remote computer accessed over the network is downloaded. The script synchronizes the delivery of the complementary entertainment content with the play of the musical recording.\\" was issued in May 2005, and has since been referenced by 66 other patents. Lawsuit against Roxio=Initial lawsuit= After Gracenote's change in licensing, Roxio made the decision to find another free music-recognition provider. In response to the competition, Gracenote filed a lawsuit with the patent at the base of its claims. > Gracenote, company that owns CDDB database, has filed a lawsuit against > Roxio, Adapatec's spin-off company that develops Easy CD Creator (the most > popular CD burning program in the world). Lawsuit is about Gracenote's CD > recognition system; Roxio/Adaptec has used the technology in its Easy CD > Creator and has paid all the licensing fees as they were supposed to, but > now they didn't continue their contract that expired 22nd of April with > Gracenote and have plans to use similar open-source database called > FreeDB.org. Gracenote says that FreeDB, and therefore also Roxio, violates > its patents and trademarks. Roxio filed a motion to dismiss the case on the ground that the patent claim by Gracenote was invalid due to prior art. The court granted the motion and agreed in part, rendering one patent in question invalid due to prior art. =Countersuit= In June 2001, Roxio filed a countersuit against Gracenote. They asserted that Gracenote fraudulently obtained U.S. Patent 6061680 and its CDDB trademark by failing to disclose certain key information to the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office. On May 17, 2001, Gracenote filed a motion for a temporary restraining order seeking to block Roxio from shipping certain of its products. On May 24, 2001, the Court denied Gracenote's request finding that Gracenote failed to demonstrate a likelihood of success on the merits. (currently offline, accessed via waybackmachine.org/) =Settlement= Roxio and Gracenote signed an agreement making Gracenote the exclusive CD- recognition service for Roxio's software. In this way, Roxio was able to maintain access to the CDDB that they (and their customers) had relied on, while Gracenote was able to maintain access to their customer-base through Roxio without having to compete with free online databases.

History The construction of the Tarkhankut lighthouse and its twin tower on the Khersones peninsula started in 1816 to ensure safe sailing in the area. The Inkerman stone, of which the building is made, was mined near Sevastopol and transported by barges. No convenient mooring facilities existed at that time, so the barges had to anchor in the harbor and the load was moved to the shore by boats and then transported to the construction site across the steppe. During the first year of construction, the builders concentrated on the basic structure at the expense of various facilities and decorations. At the end of 1816, the lighthouse looked like a conic 36-metre-high stone tower with a wooden 3.3-metre-high decagonal lantern. The lighthouse became operational in 1817 after its lighting system had been repaired. Three houses were built next to the tower to accommodate the lighthouse personnel and for storage needs. However, cold and humid winters of the Tarkhanut Peninsula, however, made these houses nearly unsuitable for living. In 1862, the lighting system was upgraded, and the spread of light reached 12.4 miles. In 1873, the construction resumed along with cleaning efforts of the surrounding areas. The building was finished and painted white. In 1876, an additional telegraph spot was built near the tower. On 1 January 1883, a compressed air fog siren was installed, but the process of preparing it for use in fog was usually taking a long time. To address that problem, a bell was set up near the lighthouse in 1899 to be rung while the siren was being prepared. In 1910, the lighthouse's fuel was changed to kerosene, requiring extra caution and maintenance on the part of the lighthouse keepers. Besides, the installation of the telegraph and meteorological station made it necessary to have communication with by-passing ships. In 1934, an electric beacon with a 300-kilometer radius of action was added to the lighthouse. In 1959, an electrical power system was installed. Current condition Currently the lighthouse is still functioning, despite being in a run-down condition. The area around the building is open for tourists to visit, and tourists are allowed to follow the lighthouse keeper's daily routine. A spiral stairway leads to an observation platform, from which a visitor can see the Black Sea and its steep shores.

Retrieved: January 26, 2015. Plot In 1941, in China, Captain Tao-Yuan-Kai would like to execute David Jones (Alan Ladd) for selling oil to the Japanese, but can do nothing because he is American. Japanese aircraft bomb the town, so Jones drives toward Shanghai with his partner, Johnny Sparrow (William Bendix), who has acquired a newly orphaned baby boy. After nightfall, they are forced to stop because Chinese refugees crowd the road. The Chinese beat the Americans and start to take their truck, until Carolyn Grant (Loretta Young), an American schoolteacher born in China, tells them to stop. Carolyn sneaks her group of female college students into the back of Jones's truck. As she grew up there and knows the terrain, Carolyn takes over the driving for a while, and has her friend, Lin Wei, sit on the hood to watch for potholes. When Jones realizes that Carolyn has loaded his truck with refugees, he starts throwing them out (worried he will not have enough gas to get to Shanghai), but relents when he learns that they are Carolyn's students, all young women. The next day, they encounter Lin Wei's first and second brothers, Lin Cho and Lin Yun, who have formed a guerrilla band and are posing as peasants. Lin Cho warns them to take an alternate road as the Japanese are approaching. Jones reluctantly drives to the family farm of Tan Ying, a girl he tried to throw off the truck, as \\"Donald Duck\\" (the baby) needs milk. At the farm, Carolyn tries again to persuade Jones to take the students to Chungtu, where they can continue their studies, rather than Japanese-occupied Shanghai, but Jones refuses. After Johnny leaves the baby with Tan Ying's family for safekeeping, the journey resumes. They are forced to abandon the truck when Japanese aircraft strafe the road, but Lin Cho and his compatriots shoot the airplane down. When Carolyn discovers that Tan Ying has slipped off the bus to rejoin her family, she insists on returning for her. While the rest of the group hikes to a monastery, Jones and Carolyn drive back to the farm and are shocked to find that the Japanese have burned the farm, and murdered Tan Ying's parents and Donald Duck. Jones then finds three Japanese soldiers raping Tan Ying, and shoots them without hesitation, while Carolyn comforts the hysterical woman. After the group takes refuge in the monastery, Tan Ying dies. Finally cognizant of the nature of the Chinese struggle, Jones is now inspired to join the fight against the Japanese, and offers his help to the three brothers. They determine that they must close a mountain pass in order to prevent the further onslaught of the Japanese, but only the Japanese army has the necessary dynamite. That night, Jones, Johnny, Lin Wei, Lin Cho and Lin Yun swim across a river to raid a Japanese encampment and steal the dynamite. When their presence is detected, a fierce gun battle ensues, during which Lin Wei, and all but two other guerrillas, are killed. Before he dies, Lin Wei honors Jones by calling him his \\"fourth brother.\\" That night, Carolyn rejects Johnny's marriage proposal because she is in love with Jones, and later, the new lovers Jones and Carolyn spend a final night together. The next day, the small band of fighters places the dynamite along the mountain pass road. When the Japanese convoy appears early, Jones stops them on the road to give the guerrillas time to lay the dynamite, and pretends that he is stranded. The Japanese general explains to Jones that Japan has just bombed Pearl Harbor in the United States, and that their intention is to create a new world order. After the general's second-in-command shoots Jones, the Chinese set off the dynamite causing an avalanche that buries the Japanese troops, and closes the road. Carolyn and Johnny mourn the loss of their friend as they drive the students to Chungtu.

Paramount bought the screen rights for $25,000 in May 1942. =Casting= The film originally was considered a vehicle for Loretta Young, who was an enthusiastic supporter of China during the war and who had just signed a three-year deal with Paramount to make two movies a year. By September, Alan Ladd and William Bendix were assigned to the film, with John Farrow to direct, in colour. Young pulled out, claiming she was dissatisfied with her role.Hopper, Hedda. \\"Looking at Hollywood.\\" Chicago Daily Tribune, October 20, 1942, p. 19. However, she appears to have changed her mind. \\"I thought it was going to be good\\", she said. \\"It was a war picture. It was full of action and a bit of vindictiveness... pretty little orphan girls.\\"Funk, Eavesdropping, p 238 William Bendix was cast as Ladd's sidekick, a departure from the \\"heavy\\" that he had played in earlier roles. He would go on to play Ladd's sidekick in The Blue Dahlia (1946), Calcutta (1947) and The Deep Six (1958).Linet 1979, p. 74. Except for the three leads and a small supporting role of Ladd's girlfriend, all of the cast were Chinese, causing the filmmakers to look outside normal casting avenues. Sen Yung, Philip Ahn and Richard Loo played lead supporting roles. Helena Kuo was meant to play a small role but did not end up appearing in the film. =Shooting= Filming started 27 October 1942. In December Hedda Hopper wrote in her gossip column \\"wonder why so many battles between producer, director, Loretta Young and Alan Ladd on China? Could it be a bad story? Could be...\\" Loretta Young later said she objected to a scene where her character had to condone the suicide of one of the Chinese girls as she would not \\"propagandize suicide as the answer to anything\\". (Young was a devout Catholic.) She claimed Farrow and Paramount's head of production Buddy de Sylva agreed to cut the scene, but it reappeared in the script during production. Young refused once more and threatened to leave the film. The scene was not shot.Funk p 199 Young also admitted she had difficulties with Alan Ladd. \\"He was a whiner and I hate that... Any man who calls for his agent every time he doesn't get his own way and his agent happens to be his wife (Sue Carol) there is something radically wrong. The last little thing that would happen, he'd be on the phone saying, 'Sue, you'd better get over here and straighten this out.\\"Funk p200 \\"I don't remember hearing him laugh, or ever seeing him laugh\\", said Young. \\"Everything that concerned him was very serious.\\"Funk, Eavesdropping, p 235 China was the third war film in a row John Farrow had directed after being discharged from the Canadian navy. Farrow was keen to make the movie as accurate as possible. \\"We have a big army and there are bound to be service men in every theatre\\", he said during the film's shoot. \\"Not only that, every mother's son has a mother ‚Äì and you can bet she knows what it's all about too. As far as I'm concerned, when I decide to make a picture about anything ‚Äì no matter what ‚Äì I feel I should be truthful.\\"Scheuer, Philip K. \\"Town Called Hollywood.\\" Los Angeles Times, November 8, 1942, p.

He also had to make a 20-foot dive off a bridge, which former diver Ladd found easy.\\"Ladd performs high dive in action picture.\\" Los Angeles Times, May 20, 1943, p. 30. The scene where 4,000 Japanese troops were killed in explosion was thought to set a record for Japanese killed on screen in a Hollywood film.\\"Newcomer singing Crosby-type song.\\" The Washington Post, March 4, 1943, p. B9. =Post Production= Paramount purchased the rights to \\"Work as One\\", a popular Chinese marching song by Shu Mo, to use in the film. Part of the purchase price went to the United China Relief Campaign Fund. The song was recorded by the All-Chinese Choir of the Chinese First Presbyterian Church of Los Angeles. Reception The film premiered in New York at the Paramount in April 1943, with an appearance by Harry James and his orchestra. Teenage fans ended up rioting, smashing a window and breaking a policeman's ribs. \\"Every indication points to a record breaking run, however\\", wrote the Los Angeles Times. The film was a big hit and Paramount reunited Young and Ladd on And Now Tomorrow (1944).Funk p 206 =Critical= Bosley Crowther in his film review for The New York Times, noted that Hollywood had churned out an unsatisfactory look at a topical subject, \\"... a small host of Chinese worthies play their countrymen in the accepted style. But the film scarcely does justice to their country ‚Äî or to the title which it bears. By and large, it is Hollywood trumpery ...\\"Crowther,Bosley. \\"Movie review: China (1943) with Alan Ladd and Loretta Young, opens at the Paramount, picture is called romance with topical theme.\\" The New York Times, April 22, 1943. The review in Variety was more charitable, noting, \\"Frank Butler generates authenticity in the dramatic evolvement of his screenplay [from a play by Archibald Forbes], while director John Farrow neatly blends the human and melodramatic elements of the yarn.\\" \\"Film review: China.\\" Variety. Retrieved: January 26, 2015. The Los Angeles Times wrote that \\"the hostility expressed in some quarters towards China can probably be laid to the title as much as anything. Hollywood's penchant for the grandiose has a way of kicking back unexpectedly ‚Äì and China, apparently, has got itself in the pan. Except in the narrow movie sense, it hardly justifies so sweeping a name. In the narrow movie sense the picture is, however, as good as most melodramas treating of some phase of the global war and ‚Äì in certain moments of realism ‚Äì rather better than that.\\" Radley Metzger praised the film, saying John Farrow \\"brilliantly mastered\\" the technique of the tracking shot and that China \\"has the most fabulous shots I've ever seen.\\" References Notes Bibliography *Funk, Edward.

Life Andrija was the heir of Miroslav of Hum, who was the brother of Serbian Grand Prince Stefan Nemanja.Fine 1994, p. 52 Miroslav's properties were divided between Stefan Nemanjiƒá (Nemanja's son), who held the southern parts of Hum, while the Ston coast and Popovo polje was given to young prince Andrija. Andrija's brother Petar withdrew to the northern parts. Historian Fine concludes that after Miroslav's death in 1198, the Hungarian Duke Andrew tried to seize Hum and managed to defeat some Serbs in Hum in about 1198, acquiring the part of Hum lying northwest of the Neretva (It is not certain if he ever obtained actual control).Fine 1994, p. 54 Duke Andrew was then either pushed out from that territory by Petar, a son of Miroslav supported by local nobles, or Duke Andrew was forced to withdraw his men from the territory when the war between him and his brother King Imre broke out in 1203, so that Petar simply assumed control of western Hum after his withdrawal (though Mavro Orbini has another account). Petar, supported by various local nobles, then expelled his own brother Andrija, who had succeeded in eastern Hum, from his lands. Stefan Nemanjiƒá, Andrija's cousin (Stefan Nemanja's son),Fine 1994, p. 53 then intervened on the behalf and in the name of Andrija (thereby acquiring support from some nobles of Hum) and regained Hum to the Neretva (possibly in about 1216). After the victory, Stefan appointed Andrija as puppet prince of Hum, but later, either because he felt strong enough, or because he felt that the arrangement was not going to succeed in binding Hum to Rascia (Nemanyid Serbia), removed Andrija as governor and left him with only the district of Popovo and the coastland of Hum, and instead installed his own governor there, possibly his own son Stefan Radoslav. Petar, who had held the area between the Neretva and Cetina rivers, then acquired Andrija's holdings (about 1218). In 1250, Andrija promised the Republic of Ragusa, which had lost its protector Ban Matej Ninoslav of Bosnia, that he would not participate in an eventual war between Ragusa and Serbia and also promised to nicely receive Ragusan refugees in Hum. In that time, Andrija recognized the supreme power of Serbian King Stefan Uro≈° I, as his vassal, thus it is odd that he would make obligations contrary to Serbian interests ‚Äì it seems that he prepared a cessation from Serbia, which indeed was made by his son Radoslav, who in 1254 is called a Hungarian vassal. He founded a church in Meƒáureƒçje, in what is now Andrijevica. His seal depicted an eagle, which was not bicephalic, as his father used.

Although Andrija was entitled the rule of Hum, soon after his accession the nobility of Hum rose up and instead appointed Petar. Upon Petar's accession, Andrija and Miroslav's widow were exiled. Miroslav's widow took up residence outside Hum at the court of her brother, Ban Kulin of Bosnia. Andrija took residence at the court of Stefan Nemanjiƒá, his cousin (Stefan Nemanja's son).Fine 1994, p. 53 In the meantime, Petar took control of all of Hum after successfully fighting his Bosnian and Croatian neighbours, and Duke Andrew of Hungary who claimed western Hum would have withdrawn from the region by 1203, when he was in conflict with his brother Imre. Stefan Nemanjiƒá then took up the cause of Andrija and attacked Petar in Hum. Stefan then gave most of Hum to his own son Stefan Radoslav, while he gave his cousin Andrija the district of Popovo and the coastland of Hum, including Ston.

Function  FOXE3 is a forkhead- box transcription factor which is involved in the proper formation of the ocular lens and is post-natally expressed in the lens epithelium.  Development  Foxe3, also known as Forkhead Box E3, is a transcription factor that is responsible for the formation of the lens placode, a precursor to the lens of the eye, and the lens itself. Foxe3 controls multiple processes during development of the lens including, the expression of CryaŒ± which controls the solubility of the crystalline protein complex in the developing lens. Reduced solubility can lead to potential cataract formation due to crystallization of the lens. Foxe3 also controls the regulation of Prox1, which is responsible for cell cycle progression. As Foxe3 expression downregulates, Prox1 expression increases causing a reduction in cellular proliferation in the anterior lens. Foxe3 also regulates platelet-derived growth factor receptor-Œ± (PdgfrŒ±) expression. This is responsible for lens fiber differentiation within the epithelium of certain parts of the lens. There are multiple defects associated with dysfunction of this gene with most being classified under the term anterior segment dysgenesis (ASD). For example, Peters anomaly is a rare disorder obtained during development characterized by adhesions due to malformations of the posterior corneal stroma, the absence of Descemet's membrane and the corneal endothelium, and corneal opacities. This syndrome can be attributed to fetal alcohol syndrome and aneuploidy. Scientists have generated a knockout model for Foxe3 in mice and are testing the effects on the lenses of those animals. So far, it appears that Foxe3 is essential for normal lens development.  Clinical significance  Mutations in the FOXE3 gene are associated with anterior segment mesenchymal dysgenesis. Homozygous mutations in this gene have been associated with a number of ocular diseases such as congenital aphakia, sclerocornea, microphthalmia, and optic disc coloboma. There have also been reports of heterozygous mutations causing less severe ocular diseases such as anterior segment dysgenesis (sometimes referred to as anterior segment mesenchymal dysgenesis), and Peter's anomaly.

The term is used to describe a region of food flows, from the area where it is produced, to the place where it is consumed, including: the land it grows on, the route it travels, the markets it passes through, and the tables it ends up on. \\"Foodshed\\" is described as a \\"socio-geographic space: human activity embedded in the natural integument of a particular place.\\" A foodshed is analogous to a watershed in that foodsheds outline the flow of food feeding a particular population, whereas watersheds outline the flow of water draining to a particular location. Through drawing from the conceptual ideas of the watershed, foodsheds are perceived as hybrid social and natural constructs. It can pertain to the area from which an individual or population receives a particular type of food, or the collective area from which an individual or population receives all of their food. The size of the foodshed can vary depending on the availability of year round foods and the variety of foods grown and processed. Variables such as micro-weather patterns, soil types, water availability, slope conditions, etc. play a role in determining the potential and risk of agriculture). The modern United States foodshed, as an example, spans the entire world as the foods available in the typical supermarket have traveled from all over the globe, often long distances from where they were produced. Origin The term was coined in 1929 in the book How Great Cities Are Fed by W.P. Hedden, who was at the time Chief of the Bureau of Commerce for the Port of New York Authority. Hedden described a ‚Äòfoodshed‚Äô in 1929 as the ‚Äòdikes and dams‚Äô guiding the flow of food from the producer to consumer. Hedden contrasts foodsheds with watersheds by noting that ‚Äúthe barriers which deflect raindrops into one river basin rather than into another are natural land elevations, while the barriers which guide and control movements of foodstuffs are more often economic than physical.‚Äù Hedden describes the economic forces that influence where foods are produced and how they are transported to the cities in which they are consumed. The term has more recently been reintroduced by permaculturist Arthur Getz, in his 1991 article ‚ÄúUrban Foodsheds‚Äù in ‚ÄúPermaculture Activist\\", to provide an image that helps people to understand how food systems work and that suggests food comes from a source that must be protected. Foodsheds in American History Eating within a local foodshed was once the only way in which families gained access to food. In the seventeenth or eighteenth century, most ingredients were drawn from an area of less than fifty acres. There was an interdependence of farming and what was cooked in the kitchen. Farmers gained a sensibility about the land‚Äîimproved and well-tended land could yield a cornucopian spread and was regarded as a source of food and a sign of wealth. Envisioning and knowing a landscape as one's fount of food is different from what most of us know and experience when driving past fields in the countryside today. People ate food that was in season, when available, or that was preserved. Very few items came from afar, and if they did they came in small amounts, such as cinnamon and nutmeg. Growing, cooking, and eating food connected most people in preindustrial America to the land. Methods of distributing food within a local foodshed The ‚Äúfarm-to-table‚Äù movement is focused on producing food locally within a foodshed, and delivering it to local consumers. Direct farm- to-table in the United States tends to comprise only a very minor segment of the food distribution system in terms of size and importance, but is growing in popularity. * Farmers‚Äô markets: centerpiece of alternative food distribution systems. The first certified farmers‚Äô markets began appearing roughly 25 years ago and are a result of a long-standing desire to protect consumers from fraudulent behavior on the part of resellers. Certified markets are closely regulated by the various state legislators and are required to guarantee that the person selling the produce is actually the person grew the produce. * Roadside stands: Used by producers to sell fruits and vegetables directly to consumers. These stands help to reduce transportation costs for farmers by bringing the consumer to the produce.) * Pick-your-own: Farmers open their fields to consumers and allow them to personally select and harvest various types of produce. This method offers the greatest potential savings for both farmers and consumers, because consumers are able to pick produce of the highest quality, and farmers save costs associated with harvesting and marketing. * Entertainment farming: farmers have been able to use non-revenue- generating farm activities such as walking trails, hay-rides, and animal petting areas to attract consumers. * Subscription farming: enables consumers to purchase a share of a particular farm‚Äôs production output. Consumers typically pay a subscription fee for the right to purchase fresh produce during harvest time. Subscribers are then charged for the produce depending on the type and quantity. * Community-supported agriculture (CSA): allows consumers to purchase shares of a farm‚Äôs production output. Nearly 5 percent of all farmers engage in some form of direct food marketing. Estimates of all farm-to-table sales within a foodshed range from roughly $550 million to $2 billion. Many local farms are family-run farms that are successful and do survive through poor economic conditions. Ecologists consider to be more adaptive and more likely to ‚Äúreproduce‚Äù in highly variable and uncertain environments. Local Foodshed Mapping The internet can be used to locate foodshed maps of almost any area. Some maps are interactive, where sources in an area can be found for organic produce, microbreweries, farmers markets, orchards, cheese makers, or other specific categories within a 100-mile radius. A 100- mile radius is considered \\"local food\\" because it is large enough to reach beyond a big city, and small enough to feel truly local. Foodsheds and Sustainability Buying local food within a foodshed can be seen as a means to combat the modern food system, and the effects it has on the environment. It has been described as ‚Äúa banner under which people attempt to counteract trends of economic concentration, social disempowerment and environmental degradation in the food and agricultural landscape.‚Äù Choosing to buy local produce improves the environmental stewardship of producers by reducing the amount of energy used in the transport of foods, as well as greenhouse gas emissions. Agriculture production alone contributes to 14% of anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions. The food system‚Äôs contribution of greenhouse gases contributes to the global issue of Climate change. More attention is being paid to possibilities for reducing emissions through more efficient transport and different patterns of consumption, specifically increased reliance on local foodsheds. One common measure of \\"eating within a foodshed\\" is whether produce has traveled under 100 ‚Äúfood miles.‚Äù Food miles are a measure of how far food travels from the farm where it is produced to the table where it is consumed. In the United States, on average, food travels about 1,500 miles before it gets to a plate. Sale of locally grown food can pave the way for reduction of food miles, and increase in agricultural sustainability.

It aims to overcome the shortcoming of computation-based puzzle protocols, in which clients are required to compute hard CPU or memory-bound puzzles that favor clients with abundant computational resources. Guided tour puzzle protocol can be seen as a form of proof-of-work (POW) protocol.  Overview  The protocol steps of the guided tour puzzle protocol is similar to that of client puzzle protocol. All clients are required to complete a guided tour puzzle prior to receiving service from the server, if the server suspects it is currently under denial of service attack or its load exceeds a pre-defined threshold. Simply put, a guided tour puzzle is a tour that needs to be completed by taking multiple round-trips to a set of special nodes, called tour guides, in a sequential order. It is called a guided tour, because the order in which the tour guides are visited is unknown to the client, and each tour guide has to direct the client towards the next tour guide for the client to complete the tour in correct order. A single tour guide may appear multiple times in a tour, so the term stop is used to denote a single appearance of a tour guide in a tour. A client knows which tour guide is at the next stop, only after completing its visit to the current stop. Solving a guided tour puzzle is essentially equal to completing a guided tour in the correct order. Starting from the first stop, the client contacts each stop and receives a reply. Each reply contains a unique token. The token in the reply message from the current stop is used for computing the address of the next stop tour guide. The address of the first stop tour guide is computed using the token contained in the server's first reply message that informs the client of the start of a puzzle process. The client must send the token received from the current stop tour guide to the next stop tour guide, which will use it as an input to its token calculation function. The token received from the last stop tour guide plus the token from the server's puzzle message are sent to the server as the proof of completion of a tour. The server can efficiently validate these two tokens, and grants service to the client only after proving their validity.  Protocol steps  Example of a guided tour puzzle when the number of tour guides is 2, and the tour length is 5. The order of the tour is: G1 -> G0 -> G1 -> G1 -> G0. Before the guided tour puzzle can start, N tour guides has to be set up in the system, where N \\\\ge 2. Meanwhile, the server establishes a shared secret k_{js} with each tour guide G_{j} using a secure channel, where 0\\\\leq j. The server keeps a short-lived secret K_{s} for computing the first hash value that is returned to the client as part of a puzzle message. A puzzle message also contains the length of the tour L, which is used to control the difficulty of a guided tour puzzle. The figure shows an example of a guided tour when N=2 and L=5. The details of the each protocol step of the guided tour puzzle protocol is explained in the following.Mehmud Abliz and Taieb Znati. A Guided Tour Puzzle for Denial of Service Prevention. In Proceedings of the Annual Computer Security Applications Conference (ACSAC) 2009, pages 279-288, Honolulu, HI, Dec 2009. * Service request: A client x sends a service request to the server. If the server load is normal, the client's request is serviced as usual; if the server is overloaded, then it proceeds to the initial puzzle generation step. * Initial puzzle generation: the server replies to the client x with a puzzle message that informs the client to complete a guided tour. The puzzle message contains the length of the tour L and a hash value h_0. The server computes h_0 using the following formula: ::h_{0} = hash(A_{x}\\\\; \\\\; L\\\\; \\\\; ts\\\\; \\\\; K_{s}) :where,  means concatenation, A_{x} is the address (or any unique value) of the client x, ts is a coarse timestamp, and hash is a cryptographic hash function such as SHA-1. * Puzzle solving: A client computes the index of the tour guide at the l-th stop of its tour using the following formula: ::S_{l}=(h_{l-1}\\\\; mod\\\\; N) :where, 0 < l \\\\leq L. When contacted by a client x, a tour guide G_j computes a hash value h_{l} (0 < l \\\\leq L) using the formula: ::h_{l} = hash(h_{l-1}\\\\; \\\\; l\\\\; \\\\; L\\\\; \\\\; A_{x}\\\\; \\\\; ts\\\\; \\\\; k_{js}) :where, l means the l-th stop of the client's tour, k_{js} is the shared key between the tour guide G_{j} and the server. After client x receives the server's reply message, it starts a guided tour by computing the index S_{1} of the first tour guide using formula for S_l. The client then sends a set of values (h_0, 1, L) to the tour guide G_{S_1}, where the second value denotes which stop of a tour the client is currently at. As a response, the client receives a hash value h_1 from the tour guide G_{S_1}, where h_1 is computed using the formula for h_l. The client x repeats this process L-1 more times and contacts the tour guides G_{S_2}, G_{S_3}, ..., G_{S_L}. The reply message from the last-stop tour guide G_{S_L} contains the last hash value h_L, and the client x sends (h_0,\\\\; h_L) to the server as the puzzle answer. * Puzzle verification: when the server receives a request from client x with a puzzle answer (h'_{0}, h'_{L}) attached, it first checks to see if h'_{0} is equal to the h_{0} it computed using the formula for h_0. If so, the server computes h_L by repeatedly using the formula for h_l, and verifies that h'_{L} is equal to h_{L}. If both hash values are valid, the server allocates resources to process the client's request. Since the server knows the shared keys k_{1s}, k_{2s}, \\\\dots, k_{Ns}, it can compute the chain of hashes h_1, h_2, ..., h_L without contacting any tour guide. A loose time synchronization between the server and tour guides is required in order to compute the same hash value at the server and tour guides.  Comparison to other puzzle protocols  CPU- bound computational puzzle protocols, such as the Client Puzzle Protocol, can mitigate the effect of denial of service attack, because the more an attacker wants to overwhelm the server, the more puzzles it has to compute, and the more computational resources of its own it needs to expend. However, due to the variation in the computational powers of clients, clients with strong computational power can solve puzzles at much higher rate than the destitute clients, and can unfairly take up most of the server resources.Martin Abadi, Mike Burrows, Mark Manasse and Ted Wobber. Moderately Hard, Memory-bound Functions. In Proceedings of NDSS 2003, pages 25-39, 2003.Cynthia Dwork, Andrew Goldberg, and Moni Naor. On Memory-Bound Functions for Fighting Spam. In Proceedings of CRYPTO 2003, pages 426-444, 2003. Another crucial shortcoming of computational puzzle protocols is that all clients, including all legitimate clients, are required to perform such CPU-intensive computations that do not contribute to any meaningful service or application. Guided tour puzzle protocol enforces delay on the clients through round trip delays, so that clients' requests arrive at a rate that is sustainable by the server. The advantage of using round-trip delays, as opposed to hard computational problems, is that the round trip delay of a small packet is determined mostly by the processing delays, queuing delays, and propagation delays at the intermediate routers, therefore is beyond the control of end hosts (clients). As such, even an attacker with abundant computational resources cannot unfairly take advantage over poorly provisioned legitimate clients. Furthermore, in guided tour puzzle protocol, the computation required for the client is trivial. Since the length of a guided tour is usually a small number in the order of tens or lower, the bandwidth overhead for completing a guided tour is also trivial. As a result, clients are not burdened with heavy computations that is usually required by CPU-bound or memory bound puzzle protocols.

Players take turns building words crossword-puzzle style in a manner similar to the classic board game Scrabble. The rules of the two games are similar, but Words with Friends is not associated with the Scrabble brand. Up to 40 games can be played simultaneously using push notifications to alert players when it is their turn. Players may look up friends either by username or through Facebook, or be randomly assigned an opponent through \\"Smart Match\\". Players can also find potential opponents using Community Match. Released in July 2009, Words with Friends is available for cross-platform play on devices running the operating systems Android, Windows Phone, and iOS (iPad, iPhone, iPod Touch). The game is also available on Facebook,Don Reisinger, Zynga brings Words with Friends to Facebook, CNET, 5 August 2011. Kindle Fire, and Nook Tablet. In addition, there is a chat feature built into the game that allows opponents to exchange messages. Between 2010 and 2011, Words with Friends was one of the top ranking games in the iOS app store, available as both a free ad-supported version and a paid version with no \\"third party ads between turns\\".Leena Rao, Zynga Brings Newtoy‚Äôs Crossword Game ‚ÄòWords with Friends‚Äô to Android Phones, TechCrunch, 2 February 2011. As of May 2017, Words with Friends was the most popular mobile game in the United States. A sequel to the game, Words with Friends 2, came out in September 2017. Gameplay QI, for a score of 17 points. The rules of the game are mostly the same as those of two-player Scrabble, with a few differences such as the arrangement of premium squares and the distribution and point values of some of the letters (see Scrabble letter distributions and point values). Players are given seven randomly chosen letter tiles, which are replenished until all 104 tiles have been used. Players take turns forming words on the board or, instead of playing a word, may also choose to swap tiles with the pool of currently unused tiles or pass their turn. Players can form words either vertically or horizontally on the board. The player's aim is to score as many points as possible. A letter placed on a DL or TL square doubles or triples the value of that letter on all words formed using that square. Similarly, the DW and TW squares double and triple the value of the new word(s) using that square. If a player uses all seven tiles on a single play (known as a bingo in Scrabble), 35 bonus points are added - this contrasts with the 50 bonus points in Scrabble. The different arrangement of premium squares can lead to scoring situations that would be rare or impossible in a typical Scrabble game. For example, it is possible to place a new word that simultaneously covers a triple letter score (TL) and a triple word score (TW), or a new word that covers a double word score (DW) and a triple word score (TW), which would be impossible or nearly impossible in a Scrabble game. The game ends when a player plays every tile in his or her rack, and there are no remaining tiles to draw. The game also ends if three scoreless moves (i.e., passes or tile exchanges) are played in succession, unless the score is zero-zero. After playing the last tile, the opposing player will lose all the points equal to the amount of the remaining tiles. This number of points will be awarded to the player who played the last tile. At the end of the game, the player with the highest score wins. There are various versions of Words With Friends. All versions allow players to resign their turn with the \\"resign\\" feature, pass their turn with the \\"pass\\" feature, swap out one or more tiles and forfeit the current turn with the \\"swap\\" feature, or look up what tiles remain with the \\"tile bag\\" feature. The \\"word strength\\" feature can be turned on or off, and enables players to see how strong their placed word is relative to all other word combinations available on the current board. In 2016, Zynga (temporarily) removed a feature called \\"hindsight\\" which allowed a player to pay for the opportunity to see what the highest-scoring moves on the board were after the play was made, but has since brought it back. In addition to the \\"hindsight\\" power-up, the game also offers other power-ups known as \\"swap+,\\" \\"word radar,\\" and \\"word clue.\\" Words with Friends accepts 173,000 words in the game. The word list used by the game is based on the Enhanced North American Benchmark Lexicon (ENABLE), with some additions from the developers. Random opponent and chat features Since the game's launch, the random opponent and chat features of the game have led to a number of romantic relationships. In 2009, Megan Lawless, of Chicago, began a game with a random opponent, Jasper Jasperse, who lived in the Netherlands. The two got to know one another via the game's chat function and married in July 2011.Phyllis Korkki, Word Games Anytime, No Travel Tiles Required, The New York Times, 21 February 2011.

The great majority (80‚Äì99.99%) of individuals born do not survive to reproductive age, with perhaps 50% of this mortality rate attributed to predation. In order to deal with this ongoing escapist battle, insects have evolved a wide range of defense mechanisms. The only restraint on these adaptations is that their cost, in terms of time and energy, does not exceed the benefit that they provide to the organism. The further that a feature tips the balance towards beneficial, the more likely that selection will act upon the trait, passing it down to further generations. The opposite also holds true; defenses that are too costly will have a little chance of being passed down. Examples of defenses that have withstood the test of time include hiding, escape by flight or running, and firmly holding ground to fight as well as producing chemicals and social structures that help prevent predation. One of the best known modern examples of the role that evolution has played in insect defenses is the link between melanism and the peppered moth (Biston betularia). Peppered moth evolution over the past two centuries in England has taken place, with darker morphs becoming more prevalent over lighter morphs so as to reduce the risk of predation. However, its underlying mechanism is still debated. Hiding The camouflaged stick insect Medauroidea extradentata Walking sticks (order Phasmatodea), many katydid species (family Tettigoniidae), and moths (order Lepidoptera) are just a few of the insects that have evolved specialized cryptic morphology. This adaptation allows them to hide within their environment because of a resemblance to the general background or an inedible object. When an insect looks like an inedible or inconsequential object in the environment that is of no interest to a predator, such as leaves and twigs, it is said to display mimesis, a form of crypsis. Insects may also take on different types of camouflage, another type of cypsis. These include resembling a uniformly colored background as well as being light below and dark above, or countershaded. Additionally, camouflage is effective when it results in patterns or unique morphologies that disrupt outlines so as to better merge the individual into the background. =Cost and benefit perspective= Butterflies (order Lepidoptera) are a good example of the balancing act between the costs and benefits associated with defense. In order to take off, butterflies must have a thorax temperature of . This energy is derived both internally through muscles and externally through picking up solar radiation through the body or wings. When looked at in this light, cryptic coloration to escape from predators, markings to attract conspecifics or warn predators (aposematism), and the absence of color to absorb adequate solar radiation, all play key roles in survival. Only when these three affairs are in balance does the butterfly maximize its fitness. Mimicry Mimicry is a form of defense which describes when a species resembles another recognized by natural enemies, giving it protection against predators. The resemblance among mimics does not denote common ancestry. Mimicry works if and only if predators are able to learn from eating distasteful species. It is a three part system that involves a model species, a mimic of that species, and a predatory observer that acts as a selective agent. If learning is to be successful, then all models, mimics, and predators must co-exist, a notion feasible within the context of geographic sympatry. Mimicry is divided into two parts, Batesian mimicry and M√ºllerian mimicry. =Batesian mimicry= In Batesian mimicry, an aposematic inedible model has an edible mimic. Automimics are individuals that, due to environmental conditions, lack the distasteful or harmful chemicals of conspecifics, but are still indirectly protected through their visibly identical relatives. An example can be found in the plain tiger (Danaus chrysippus), a non-edible butterfly, which is mimicked by multiple species, the most similar being the female danaid eggfly (Hypolimnas misippus). =M√ºllerian mimicry= In M√ºllerian mimicry, a group of species benefit from each other's existence because they all are warningly colored in the same manner and are distasteful. The best examples of this phenomenon can be found within the butterfly genus Heliconius. Like in Batesian mimicry, the mimics are not closely related, although they obviously are in Heliconius. Behavioral responses Behavioral responses to escape predation include burrowing into substrate and being active only through part of the day. Furthermore, insects may feign death, a response termed thanatosis. Beetles, particularly weevils, do this frequently. Bright colors may also be flashed underneath cryptic ones. A startle display occurs when prey takes advantage of these markings after being discovered by a predator. The striking color pattern, which often includes eyespots, is intended to evoke prompt enemy retreat. Better formed eyespots seem to result in better deterrence. Mechanical defenses Insects have had millions of years to evolve mechanical defenses. Perhaps the most obvious is the cuticle. Although its main role lies in support and muscle attachment, when extensively hardened by the cross-linking of proteins and chitin, or sclerotized, the cuticle acts as a first line of defense.Nation, James L. Insect Physiology and Biochemistry. Boca Raton, FL: CRC Press, 2002. Additional physical defenses include modified mandibles, horns, and spines on the tibia and femur. When these spines take on a main predatory role, they are termed raptorial. Some insects uniquely create retreats that appear uninteresting or inedible to predators. This is the case in caddisfly larvae (order Trichoptera) which encase their abdomen with a mixture of materials like leaves, twigs, and stones. Autotomy Autotomy, or the shedding of appendages, is also used to distract predators, giving the prey a chance to escape. This highly costly mechanism is regularly practiced within stick insects (order Phasmatodea) where the cost is accentuated by the possibility that legs can be lost 20% of the time during molting. Harvestmen (order Opiliones) also use autotomy as a first line of defense against predators.Eisner, T., M. Eisner, and M. Siegler. Secret Weapons. Cambridge, MA: Belknap Press, 2005. Chemical defenses Unlike pheromones, allomones harm the receiver at the benefit of the producer. This grouping encompasses the chemical arsenal that numerous insects employ. Insects with chemical weaponry usually make their presence known through aposematism. Aposematism is utilized by non-palatable species as a warning to predators that they represent a toxic danger. Additionally, these insects tend to be relatively large, long-lived, active, and frequently aggregate. Indeed, longer-lived insects are more likely to be chemically defended than short lived ones, as longevity increases apparency. Throughout the arthropod and insect realm, however, chemical defenses are quite unevenly distributed. There is great variation in the presence and absence of chemical arms among orders and families to even within families. Moreover, there is diversity among insects as to whether the defensive compounds are obtained intrinsically or extrinsically.Blum, M.S. Chemical Defenses of Arthropods. New York: Academic Press, Inc., 1981. Many compounds are derived from the main food source of insect larvae, and occasionally adults, feed, whereas other insects are able to synthesize their own toxins. In reflex bleeding, insects dispel their blood, hemolymph, or a mixture of exocrine secretions and blood as a defensive maneuver. As previously mentioned, the discharged blood may contain toxins produced within the insect source or externally from plants that the insect consumed. Reflexive bleeding occurs in specific parts of the body; for example, the beetle families Coccinellidae (ladybugs) and Meloidae bleed from the knee joints. =Classification= Gullan and Cranston have divided chemical defenses into two classes. Class I chemicals irritate, injure, poison, or drug individual predators. They can be further separated into immediate or delayed substances, depending on the amount of time it takes to feel their effects. Immediate substances are encountered topographically when a predator handles the insect while delayed chemicals, which are generally contained within the insect's tissues, induce vomiting and blistering. Class I chemicals include bufadienolides, cantharidin, cyanides, cardenolides, and alkaloids, all of which have greater effects on vertebrates than on other arthropods. The most frequently encountered defensive compounds in insects are alkaloids. In contrast to Class I chemicals, Class II chemicals are essentially harmless. They stimulate scent and taste receptors so as to discourage feeding. They tend to have low molecular weight and are volatile and reactive, including acids, aldehydes, aromatic ketones, quinones, and terpenes. Furthermore, they may be aposematic, indicating through odors the presence of chemical defenses. The two different classes are not mutually exclusive, and insects may use combinations of the two. Pasteels, Gr√©goire, and Rowell-Rahier also grouped chemical defenses, albeit in a different manner. Weaponry is partitioned into chemical compounds that are truly poisonous, those that restrict movement, and those that repel predators. True poisons, essentially Class I compounds, interfere with specific physiological processes or act at certain sites. Repellents are similar to those classified under Class II as they irritate the chemical sensitivity of predators. Impairment of movement and sense organs is achieved through sticky, slimy, or entangling secretions that act mechanically rather than chemically. This last grouping of chemicals has both Class I and Class II properties. As with Class I and Class II compounds, these three categories are not mutually exclusive, as some chemicals can have multiple effects. =Examples= An assassin bug Assassin bugs When startled, the assassin bug Platymeris rhadamanthus (family Reduviidae), is capable of spitting venom up to 30 cm at potential threats. The saliva of this insect contains at least six proteins including large amounts of protease, hyaluronidase, and phospholipase which are known to cause intense local pain, vasodilation, and edema. Cockroaches Many cockroach species (order Blattodea) have mucus-like adhesive secretions on their posterior. Although not as effective against vertebrates, these secretions foul the mouths of invertebrate predators, increasing the chances of the cockroach escaping. Termites The majority of termite soldiers secrete a rubberlike and sticky chemical concoction that serves to entangle enemies, called a fontanellar gun, and it is usually coupled with specialized mandibles.Howse, P. E. \\"Sociochemicals of termites\\". Chemical Ecology of Insects. Ed. Bell, William J., and Ring T. Card√©. London: Chapman and Hall Ltd, 1984. 475-519. In nasute species of termites (contained within the subfamily Nasutitermitinae), the mandibles have receded. This makes way for an elongated, syringic nasus capable of squirting liquid glue. When this substance is released from the frontal gland reservoir and dries, it becomes sticky and is capable of immobilizing attackers. It is highly effective against other arthropods, including spiders, ants, and centipedes. Among termite species in the Apicotermitinae that are soldierless or where soldiers are rare, mouth secretions are commonly replaced by abdominal dehiscence. These termites contract their abdominal muscles, resulting in the fracturing of the abdominal wall and the expulsion of gut contents. Because abdominal dehiscence is quite effective at killing ants, the noxious chemical substance released is likely contained within the termite itself. Ants Venom is the defense of choice for many ants (family Formicidae). It is injected from an ovipositor that has been evolutionarily modified into a stinging apparatus. These ants release a complex venom mixture that can include histamine. Within the subfamily Formicinae, the stinger has been lost and instead the poison gland forcibly ejects the fluid of choice, formic acid. Some carpenter ants (genus Camponotus) also have mandibular glands that extend throughout their bodies. When these are mechanically irritated, the ant commits suicide by exploding, spilling out a sticky, entangling substance. The subfamily Dolichoderinae, which also does not possess a stinger, has a different type of defense. The anal gland secretions of this group rapidly polymerize in air and serve to immobilize predators. Leaf beetles Leaf beetles produce a spectrum of chemicals for their protection from predators. In the case of the subtribe Chrysomelina (Chrysomelinae), all live stages are protected by the occurrence of isoxazolin-5-one derived glucosides that partially contain esters of 3-nitropropanoic acid (3-NPA, beta-nitropropionic acid). The latter compound is an irreversible inhibitor of succinate dehydrogenase. Hence, 3-NPA inhibits the tricarboxylic acid cycle. This inhibition leads to neurodegeneration with symptoms similar to those caused by Huntington's disease. Since leaf beetles produce high concentrations of 3-NPA esters, a powerful chemical defense against a wide range of different predators is obvious. The larvae of Chrysomelina leaf beetles developed a second defensive strategy that is based on the excretion of droplets via pairs of defensive glands at the back of the insects. These droplets are immediately presented after mechanical disturbance and contain volatile compounds that derive from sequestered plant metabolites. Due to the specialization of leaf beetles to a certain host plant, the composition of the larval secretion is species- dependent. For instance, the red poplar leaf beetle (Chrysomela populi) consumes the leaves of poplar plants, which contain salicin. This compound is taken up by the insect and then further transformed biochemically into salicylaldehyde, an odor very similar to benzaldehyde. The presence of salicin and salicylaldehyde can repel potential predators of leaf beetles. The hemolymph toxins originate from autogenous de novo biosynthesis by the Chrysomelina beetle. Essential amino acids, such as valine serve as precursors for the production of the hemolymph toxins of Chrysomelina leaf beetles. The degradation of such essential amino acids provides propanoyl-CoA. This compound is further transformed into propanoic acid and Œ≤-alanine. The amino group in Œ≤-alanine is then oxidized to yield either an oxime or the nitro- toxin 3-nitropropanoic acid (3-NPA). The oxime is cyclized to isoxazolin-5-one, which is transformed with Œ±-UDP-glucose into the isoxazolin-5-one glucoside. In a final step, an ester is formed by transesterification of 3-nitropropanoyl-CoA to the 6¬¥-position of isoxazolin-5-one glucoside. This biosynthetic route yields high millimolar concentrations of the secondary isoxazolin-5-one and 3-NPA derived metabolites. Free 3-NPA and glucosides that derive from 3-NPA and isoxazolin-5-one also occur in many genera of leguminous plants (Fabaceae). The larvae of leaf beetles from the subfamilies of e.g., Criocerinae and Galerucinae often employ fecal shields, masses of feces that they carry on their bodies to repel predators. More than just a physical barrier, the fecal shield contains excreted plant volatiles that can serve as potent predator deterrents. Wasps Ant attacks represent a large predatory pressure for many species of wasps, including the Polistes versicolor. These wasps possess a gland located in the VI abdominal sternite (van de Vecht's gland) that is primarily responsible for making an ant-repellent substance. Tufts of hair near the edge of the VI abdominal sternite store and apply the ant repellent, secreting the ant repellent through a rubbing behavior.Togni, Olga, and Edilberto Giannotti. \\"Nest Defense Behavior Against the Attack of Ants in Colonies of Pre-emergent Mischocyttarus cerberus (Hymenoptera, Vespidae).\\" Acta Ethologica 11.2 (2008): 43-54. Web. Collective defenses in social insects Many chemically defended insect species take advantage of clustering over solitary confinement. Among some insect larvae in the orders Coleoptera and Hymenoptera, cycloalexy is adopted. Either the heads or ends of the abdomen, depending on where noxious compounds are secreted, make up the circumference of a circle. The remaining larvae lie inside this defensive ring where the defenders repel predators through threatening attitudes, regurgitation, and biting. Termites (order Isoptera), like eusocial ants, wasps, and bees, rely on a caste system to protect their nests. The evolution of fortress defense is closely linked to the specialization of soldier mandibles. Soldiers can have biting-crushing, biting-cutting, cutting, symmetrical snapping, and asymmetrical snapping mandibles. These mandibles may be paired with frontal gland secretion, although snapping soldiers rarely utilize chemical defenses. Termites take advantage of their modified mandibles in phragmosis, which is the blocking of the nest with any part of the body; in this case of termites, nest entrances are blocked by the heads of soldiers. Some species of bee, mainly that of the genus Trigona, also exhibit such aggressive behavior. The Trigona fuscipennis species in particular, make use of attraction, landing, buzzing and angular flights as typical alarm behaviors. But biting is the prominent form of defense among T. fuscipennis bees and involve their strong, sharp five-toothed mandibles. T. fuscipennis bees have been discovered to engage in suicidal biting in order to defend the nest and against predators. Humans standing in the vicinity of nests are almost always attacked and experience painful bites. The bees also crawl over the intruder into the ears, eye, mouth, and other cavities.Gupta, R.K.; Reybroeck, W.; van Veen, J.W.; Gupta, A. (2014). Beekeeping for Poverty Alleviation and Livelihood Security: Vol. 1: Technological Aspects of Beekeeping. Springer. . The Trigona workers give a painful and persistent bite, are difficult to remove, and usually die during the attack. Alarm pheromones warn members of a species of approaching danger. Because of their altruistic nature, they follow the rules of kin selection. They can elicit both aggregational and dispersive responses in social insects depending on the alarm caller's location relative to the nest. Closer to the nest, it causes social insects to aggregate and may subsequently produce an attack against the threat. The Polistes canadensis, a primitively eusocial wasp, will emit a chemical alarm substance at the approach of a predator, which will lower their nestmates' thresholds for attack, and even attract more nestmates to the alarm. The colony is thus able to rise quickly with its sting chambers open to defend its nest against predators. In nonsocial insects, these compounds typically stimulate dispersal regardless of location. Chemical alarm systems are best developed in aphids and treehoppers (family Membracidae) among the nonsocial groups.Nault, L. R., and P. L. Phelan. \\"Alarm pheromones and sociality in pre-social insects\\". Chemical Ecology of Insects. Ed. Bell, W. J., and R. T. Card√©. London: Chapman and Hall Ltd, 1984. 237‚Äì256. Alarm pheromones take on a variety of compositions, ranging from terpenoids in aphids and termites to acetates, an alcohol, and a ketone in honey bees to formic acid and terpenoids in ants. Immunity Insects, like nearly every other organism, are subject to infectious diseases caused by viruses, bacteria, fungi, protozoa, and nematodes. These encounters can kill or weaken the insect. Insects protect themselves against these detrimental microorganisms in two ways. Firstly, the body-enveloping chitin cuticle, in conjunction with the tracheal system and the gut lining, serve as major physical barriers to entry. Secondly, hemolymph itself plays a key role in repairing external wounds as well as destroying foreign organisms within the body cavity. Insects, along with having passive immunity, also show evidence of acquired immunity. Social insects additionally have a repertoire of behavioural and chemical \\"border-defences\\" and in the case of the ant, groom venom or metapleural gland secretions over their cuticle. Role of phenotypic plasticity Phenotypic plasticity is the capacity of a single genotype to exhibit a range of phenotypes in response to variation in the environment.Whitman, D. W., and A. A. Agrawal. \\"What is phenotypic plasticity and why is it important?\\" Phenotypic Plasticity of Insects: Mechanisms and Consequences. Ed. D. W. Whitman and T. N. Ananthakrishnan. Enfield, NH: Science, 2009. 1-63. For example, in Nemoria arizonaria caterpillars, the cryptic pattern changes according to season and is triggered by dietary cues. In the spring, the first brood of caterpillars resembles oak catkins, or flowers. By the summer when the catkins have fallen, the caterpillars discreetly mimic oak twigs. No intermediate forms are present in this species, although other members of the genus Nemoria, such as N. darwiniata, do exhibit transitional forms. In social insects such as ants and termites, members of different castes develop different phenotypes. For example, workers are normally smaller with less pronounced mandibles than soldiers. This type of plasticity is more so determined by cues, which tend to be non-harmful stimuli, than by the environment. Phenotypic plasticity is important because it allows an individual to adapt to a changing environment and can ultimately alter their evolutionary path. It not only plays an indirect role in defense as individuals prepare themselves physically to take on the task of avoiding predation through camouflage or developing collective mechanical traits to protect a social hive, but also a direct one. For example, cues elicited from a predator, which may be visual, acoustic, chemical, or vibrational, may cause rapid responses that alter the prey‚Äôs phenotype in real time.Whitman, D. W., and L. Blaustein. \\"Natural enemy-induced plasticity in plants and animals\\". Phenotypic Plasticity of Insects: Mechanisms and Consequences. Ed. D. W. Whitman and T. N. Ananthakrishnan.

The film is based on the 1863 novel Captain Fracasse by Th√©ophile Gautier. It was entered into the 41st Berlin International Film Festival. Plot The story takes place in France during 1600. A ramshackle theater company of Commedia dell'arte (Comedy of Art) is to roam vast and boundless territories to reach the court of Louis XIII. However, it remains stationary for days on a single place. In fact, a member of the company is seriously ill and so the actor who plays Punch (Troisi) tells how it all took place in a traveler who sees the bandwagon. The theater company recently was already going to visit the King of France that he might have better luck presenting their games and shows, but they ran into a storm. There, the members have seen a ruined castle and entered it, as we are in a servant (Ciccio Ingrassia) and his young master fallen: Baron Sigognac. The servant understands well that the young man would spend a useless life if he continued to live with him, and throws him out the next day with the company so that it can find the fortune. The young man struggles to acclimate to the new conditions imposed on him, but gradually get used to and make friends with almost all the funny members of the company who all have an interesting story to tell about their past. Sigognac will fall in love but also of Serafina, finding themselves in difficulty because of its poor conditions and fear of poverty also drag the baron, flees. Among cheerful evenings in villages to interpret and shows coarse farces and trouble with bandits in the woods, the company is in the court of the nobleman Bruyeres offering a satisfactory amount of money the company of the three girls to play shows just for him. That just happens during the evening also Sigognac, called in to replace a sick actor, must play a role. But the young man is totally inexperienced in the theater and its arrival on the scene is likely to drop all of the magical spell of the show. But the young unexpected jokes and also performs some carelessly tumbled by blowing up the audience in a roar of laughter. Now a new company was born in the theatrical mask that encloses together \\"Captain\\" and \\"Idiot Servant\\" Captain Fracassa. The success was immediate, but Sigognac will not be happy for long because that night he collides with a noble bearing violence to a girl of the company. Sigognac, paying appeal to his duties noble gentleman, a duel rival but proves to be more skilled than him and seriously injured. Below is a violent fever attacks the poor young man. Again here the beginning of the story: the members of the company, reduced to a few because of the death of some and neglect others, succeed with a last effort to reach Paris where staged their show with the Captain Fracassa.

Career He was born in Bi≈Çgoraj, Poland into an orthodox Jewish family. When his father died six years later his mother emigrated to America leaving the children with grandparents. In 1920 the family was reunited in the United States and Julius began to work in theater. He played with Julius Natanson, Leon Blank, Boris Thomashevsky, Aaron Lebedeff, Samuel Goldenberg, Jennie Goldstein, and others.Zalmen Zylbercweig, Leksikon fun Yidishn teater, Book three, 2379 He originally trained as a hat maker; when his stepfather learned of his desire to become an actor, Adler was put out of the family home. He got as far as the fire escape where he slept and where his mother gave him food. When Adler's stepfather learned about the amount of money his stepson was making in his acting career, he was invited to move back into the family apartment. Later life and career In 1935, he met Henrietta Jacobson while both were appearing with Herman Yablokoff (Hayim Yablonik) in McKinley Square Theater. She was a divorcee with a young son from a prior marriage. Henrietta had deep roots in the Jewish theater community. Her parents, Joseph and Bessie, were Yiddish theater stars at the beginning of the 20th century, and her brothers, Hymie and Irving, not only performed but owned several prominent Yiddish theaters in New York City. When her father died, Henrietta was just seven weeks old; Bessie continued to perform and brought her four children up as performers also. Julius and Henrietta formed a team and performed together for three years. When they had an offer to perform in Belgium, Julius proposed by remarking that they could save money on visas and other expenses as a married couple. Henrietta accepted and they were married in 1938. Adler was accepted into the Hebrew Actors Union in 1938 and with his wife toured France, Lithuania, and Belgium. They then played in Chicago, then at the Hopkonson Theater and made a revue film. They played with Molly Picon and Jacob Kalich at the Second Avenue Theater in the Yiddish Theater District; in 1948 they played in London. In 1950 he became director of the National Theater and produced Yiddish vaudeville. The couple also wrote plays. Their son, Bruce Adler (Borekh Yosl, born 1944) played Yiddish theater when he was young. He also later worked on Broadway and was nominated for two Tony Awards. The Adler family played the London Palladium with Sophie Tucker in the 1950s. Adler also did some work in films, beginning in 1926 with Broken Hearts. He had an uncredited role as the High Priest in the 1935 film, She. Adler was cast as Aleksei (the priest) for the film Tevya (1939). The musical Fiddler on the Roof was based on this film, though this early version of the story was non-musical. His last film role was as a comedian in the 1950 Catskill Honeymoon, Adler and his wife were performing in non-Yiddish theater by the 1960s. In 1973, they were the stars of a St. Petersburg, Florida production of Come Blow Your Horn. Their son, Bruce, was also cast in the play as the younger brother. Death The couple is buried in the Yiddish Theatrical Alliance section (Block 67) of Mount Hebron Cemetery. The section is reserved for those who were part of New York's Yiddish theater and is maintained by the Alliance.

He was knighted by the Lord Protector in 1657 and was made a baronet by King Charles II in 1660. Biography Wheler of John Wheler, of London, goldsmith, and his wife Martha (born 1585), daughter of Robert Herrick, of St. Martin's, Leicester, was \\"a 4th son, born in Holland\\" probably in 1611. In November 1640, Wheler was elected Member of Parliament for Westbury in the Long Parliament, in which he was a member. He was a Lay Member of the Westminster Assembly in 1643. He was knighted some time before 30 January 1649. He sat until 1648 when he was excluded under Pride's Purge. He was sometime of the First Fruits office. He was knighted at Hampton Court, on 26 August 1657, by the Lord Protector Oliver Cromwell. In 1659 he represented Banffshire in the Third Protectorate Parliament. In 1660, Wheler was elected MP for Queensborough in the Convention Parliament. He was created a baronet on 11 August 1660, with a special, remainder failing the heirs male of his body, \\"to Charles Wheeler [rectius Wheler], cosin to the said Sir William and the heires males of the body of the said Sir Charles\\". Wheler left London on account of the Great Plague of London and went to Derby, where he died on 6 August 1666, at the age of 56. He was buried in All Saints in Derby where there is a monument to him which records his age at death as 66. Sir William's cousin Charles Wheler succeeded to the baronetcy. However Sir William and Charles Wheler had fallen out, apparently over Charles urging Sir William to execute a settlement of his estates upon Charles (which he considered part of the arrangement for using his influence at court to help secure the baronetcy for Sir William), so instead of doing what Charles wanted, Sir William left the bulk of is estate to others and Charles only received an annual stipend of ¬£120.

In their correspondence, Gide and Bussy did not fail to mention M√§dchen in Uniform, the cinematic version of which had already been shown in Paris during the interwar period. In 1934 after this discussion Bussy sent the text, which she had been writing since the year before, to her close friend Andr√© Gide to ask his opinion. He replied it was \\"not very engaging,\\" which hurt Bussy deeply. Because of Gide's discouraging response, Bussy gave up on publishing it for fifteen years. After the book's success, Gide apologized to Bussy for not having appreciated her work at first. In 1999, her novel was ranked at number 35 on Publishing Triangle's '100 best lesbian and gay novels' list.  French edition  The first French edition, published by Stock in 1949, benefited from a foreword by Rosamond Lehmann, who was also close to Leonard Woolf and the Bloomsbury Group.

The tower was erected in 1863 at the junction of Bird Street and Bore Street over the site of the ancient Crucifix Conduit which supplied water to the Friary since 1301. In the early 20th century, since the invention of the motor car, Bird Street and Bore Street were becoming congested with traffic due to their narrow layout and the position of the clock tower only made matters worse. In 1928 the road named ‚ÄòThe Friary‚Äô was built across the former Friary site. The building of this road necessitated the relocation of the clock tower, 400m west of its original location along the new road. History The tower in it original position In the mid 19th century the building of clock towers was in fashion in England. Following the construction of Big Ben in 1858, the Council Chamber of Lichfield mooted the idea of following suit and building their own clock tower in the city. A number of locations were suggested for the clock tower including the roof of the Guildhall and in the Market Square where it would incorporate the statue of Samuel Johnson into its structure. These ideas were eventually dismissed and it was decided to erect the tower at the junction of Bore Street and Bird Street capping the redundant Crucifix Conduit. The tower was designed by Joseph Potter Jnr. in a Norman style and financed by the Lichfield Conduit Lands Trust. When the tower was complete it had cost the Trust ¬£1200. There were originally three clock faces as it was considered unnecessary for a west face as it only looked upon one property; the Friary. However, due to complaints from the tenant at the Friary a fourth face was added. There were numerous problems regarding the accuracy of the clock during its early years until the whole mechanism was overhauled by Joyce of Whitchurch in 1898. In 1920 the 11 acre Friary estate was sold to Sir Richard Ashmole Cooper (MP for Walsall), who gave it to the city for the purpose of developing the area and laying out a new road. For many years since the invention of the motor car Bird Street and Bore Street were becoming congested with traffic due to their narrow layout, and the position of the clock tower was part of the problem. The west side of Lichfield was still very much undeveloped by 1920 and the city didn‚Äôt really extend beyond St John's Street to the west. In 1928 the road named ‚ÄòThe Friary‚Äô was built across the former Friary site. The building of this road necessitated the relocation of the clock tower. The clock tower was taken down and re-erected at its current site south of Festival Gardens, some 400m west of its original location. The tower was repaired and restored in 1991 with the assistance of the Conduit Lands Trust. The clock tower is now in the care of Lichfield City Council.

Organised by the Trades Union Congress (TUC), it was a protest march against planned public spending cuts by the Conservative-Liberal Democrat coalition government that was formed in May 2010. A poster critical of health secretary Andrew Lansley for his plans perceived as including increased privatisation of the NHS Various sources estimated that the demonstration was attended by between 250,000 and 500,000 people. It was described as the largest protest in the United Kingdom since the 15 February 2003 anti-war protests and the largest union-organised rally in London since the Second World War. Demonstrators marched from the Thames Embankment, via the Houses of Parliament, to Hyde Park where a rally took place with speakers including the TUC general secretary Brendan Barber and leader of the opposition Ed Miliband, who addressed the assembled crowds. Several independent protesting groups, some of whom had moved from the main march, assembled further north in the heart of London's West End, where shops and banks were vandalised and some individuals clashed with police. Further clashes were reported later in Trafalgar Square. 201 people were arrested, and 66 were injured, including 31 police officers. Background In May 2010, the United Kingdom general election resulted in a hung parliament and the Conservative Party and Liberal Democrats entered into a coalition government. The Conservative leader David Cameron became Prime Minister and Liberal Democrat leader Nick Clegg became Deputy Prime Minister. The government planned to slow the rate of public spending, saying that it was necessary to turn around the country's deficit. The TUC argues that spending reductions are unnecessary because the budget could be balanced with progressive taxes instead and indeed the deep cuts would depress the economy making deeper cuts necessary in the future. They also argue that \\"raising four pounds through cuts for every pound raised through tax ‚Äì and doing most of this through a rise in VAT that hits the poor and those on middle income the most ‚Äì is deeply unfair.\\" They further argue that the recession was created by the finance sector, yet banks are not being asked to make a fair contribution. The march was four months after the 2010 student protests which focused on spending cuts and changes to higher and further education. The march The march was organised by the Trades Union Congress (TUC) and promoted as the March for the Alternative. Amongst those joining the march were members of a variety of different sectors in public service, including teachers, nurses and midwives, as well as pensioners, students and direct action supporters. 800 coaches and ten trains were laid on to transport demonstrators to London with demand for transport being so high that some of those wishing to travel to the march were unable to do so. Demonstrators began marching from Victoria Embankment, south to the Houses of Parliament. The march then turned up Whitehall, passing Downing Street, and heading into the heart of London's West End. It was on Regent Street and Piccadilly that some protesters, apparently unconnected with the official march, caused vandalism to shops and banks. The numbers attending the rally were significantly higher than the TUC's initial estimate of 100,000 people. Some families brought their children on the march, and performances were given by bands, choirs and dancers. The police later stated that the TUC were \\"very professional\\" and \\"very well prepared\\" with the march. =Hyde Park rally= The march concluded at a rally in Hyde Park, where TUC general secretary Brendan Barber told demonstrators: \\"We are here to send a message to the government that we are strong and united... We will fight the savage cuts and we will not let them destroy peoples' services, jobs and lives.\\" Leader of the opposition Ed Miliband also said: \\"The Tories [Conservatives] said I should not come and speak today. But I am proud to stand with you. There is an alternative.\\" He went on to criticise the manner in which the coalition government instituted the cuts, issuing a message to David Cameron that \\"you wanted to create the Big Society ‚Äì this is the big society. The big society united against what your government is doing to our country. We stand today not as the minority, but as the voice of the mainstream majority in this country.\\" When Miliband stated that certain cuts to the public sector were, in his opinion, necessary, he was heckled and booed by portions of the crowd, although on the whole his speech was well received by the audience. Direct action The occupation of Fortnum & Mason Outside of the main TUC march, various independent protests took place across central London. Over one hundred people including some members of the direct action group UK Uncut occupied the Fortnum & Mason store as a protest against alleged tax avoidance by the business's owners. Footage taken from inside the store and released later showed police officers telling protesters they were free to leave, only to be arrested once outside. 138 were arrested for aggravated trespass arising from the sit-in occupation of Fortnum & Mason. The charges against five minors were dropped on 30 June and charge against a further 109 activists were dropped on 18 July as they were no longer in the public interest. Charges still remain against 30 who were described as organising the protest. Dozens of other groups had vowed to hijack the official union-organized protest by staging their own demonstrations intended to cause chaos. Some of those involved in these included alleged anarchists and Black bloc protesters who clashed with police and committed vandalism and criminal damage at a number of locations in the West End. Police vehicles were graffitied and windows were smashed on Oxford Street. Thirteen stores along the street closed early for the day and many West End theatres cancelled the evening's shows. Premises damaged included restaurants, the Porsche showroom in Mayfair, the Ritz Hotel, Topshop's flagship store and the banks Santander, HSBC and Royal Bank of Scotland. 11 people were charged with criminal offences related to violence in the immediate wake of the unrest. A protester smashing the window of a branch of the HSBC bank in Cambridge Circus, London Clashes between protesters and police continued into the night at Trafalgar Square, where missiles were thrown, banners were burned, and Nelson's Column was graffitied. Metropolitan Police commander Bob Broadhurst criticised those who he described as \\"mindless yobs\\" in Trafalgar Square and Oxford Street, remarking: \\"Unfortunately we've had in the region of 500 plus ‚Äì I would call them criminals ‚Äì people hiding under the pretence of the TUC march who have caused considerable damage, attacked police officers, attacked police vehicles and scared the general public. Unfortunately, because of their mobility and the fact they are aware of some of our tactics, we have been unable to contain them and so we have had these groups wandering around the central London area.\\" Broadhurst warned that additional charges could be brought against those who escaped arrest on the day as police examined photographs and footage. However, Brian Paddick, a former deputy assistant commissioner of the Metropolitan Police, claimed that there were not enough officers \\"in the right place at the right time\\" and suggested intelligence had not been heeded. He told BBC Radio 4's The World This Weekend: \\"It appears to me that they just didn't have the right numbers of officers in the right place at the right time to prevent not only the problems at Fortnum & Mason but at Trafalgar Square. Again that was flagged up days before that they wanted to occupy Trafalgar Square. There was a lot more I think they could have done.\\" Reaction and aftermath A placard accusing David Cameron is held up in front of a pall of smoke in Oxford Street Speaking on the BBC Radio 4 show Today, the Secretary of State for Education, Michael Gove, acknowledged the concerns of the demonstrators, but defended the implementation of the cuts, stating that \\"we have to take steps to bring the public finances back into balance.\\" According to the general secretary of the union Unite, Len McCluskey, the size of the deficit had been \\"exaggerated\\"; McCluskey said that up to ¬£25 billion could be collected by reducing tax avoidance. Business Secretary Vince Cable said that the government will not change its basic economic strategy as a result of the protest. He told The Politics Show: \\"No government ‚Äì coalition, Labour or any other ‚Äì would change its fundamental economic policy simply in response to a demonstration of that kind.\\" He also defended the coalition government as \\"one of the strongest governments which this country has ever had, facing a major financial crisis\\". The Home Secretary, Theresa May, told parliament that she would consult the police on giving them new powers to remove face coverings and balaclavas as well as banning orders, similar to those used to ban football hooligans from football matches. The Shadow Home Secretary, Yvette Cooper, strongly backed the minister's stance.

It had an estimated magnitude of 8.1 on the moment magnitude scale (making it the strongest known earthquake of 1944) and a maximum felt intensity of greater than 5 shindo (about VIII (Severe) on the Mercalli intensity scale). It triggered a large tsunami that caused serious damage along the coast of Wakayama Prefecture and the T≈çkai region. Together the earthquake and tsunami caused 3,358 casualties. Tectonic setting The southern coast of Honsh≈´ runs parallel to the Nankai Trough, which marks the subduction of the Philippine Sea Plate beneath the Eurasian Plate. Movement on this convergent plate boundary leads to many earthquakes, some of them of megathrust type. The Nankai megathrust has five distinct segments (A-E) that can rupture independently, the segments have ruptured either singly or together repeatedly over the last 1300 years. Megathrust earthquakes on this structure tend to occur in pairs, with a relatively short time gap between them. The 1944 event, which ruptured the C & D segments was followed two years later by the 1946 Nankaid≈ç earthquake, rupturing segments A & B. In addition to these two events, there were two similar earthquakes in 1854. In each case the northeastern segment ruptured before the southwestern segment. Damage There was severe damage from the earthquake on the eastern side of the Kii Peninsula particularly in the cities of Shing≈´ and Tsu. A total of 26,146 houses were destroyed by the shaking, including 11 that burned down and a further 3,059 houses were destroyed by the tsunami. Nearly 47,000 houses were seriously damaged by the combined effects of the earthquake and tsunami. There were 1,223 people killed and a further 2,135 were seriously injured. Characteristics 260px =Earthquake= Felt intensities of greater than Shindo 5 were recorded along the southern coast of Honsh≈´, with Shindo 3‚Äì4 in Tokyo. The observed teleseismic response and tsunami records have been matched using a rupture area of 220 x 140 km and a maximum displacement of 2.3 m. It has been suggested that splay faults, linking back into the plate interface, have had an important role in generating large tsunamigenic earthquakes along the Nankai trough. The 1944 event could have occurred on such a splay fault. =Tsunami= The maximum recorded wave height was 10 meters on the Kumano coast. Run-ups in excess of 5 meters were also recorded at several locations along the coasts of Mie and Wakayama Prefectures. The tsunami was observed along the Pacific coast of Japan from Izu Peninsula to Kyushu, and recorded by tide gauges from Alaska to Hawaii. Future seismic hazard The segment of the megathrust to the east of the rupture area for the 1944 earthquake has not ruptured since 1854 and the likelihood of a 'Tokai earthquake' is considered to be high. There is no evidence that this segment has ruptured on its own in the past, although this cannot be ruled out. Any rupture of segment E may also include segments C & D, possibly causing a repeat of the damaging 1854 T≈çkai earthquake.

Background The importation of slaves into the United States became illegal in 1808, under the Act Prohibiting Importation of Slaves. That act did not include any effective penalties for violation, and did not specify what was to be done with illegally imported slaves. In practice, each state auctioned off such slaves and kept the proceeds. In 1819 the Act in Addition to the acts prohibiting the slave trade gave the President authority to use U.S. Navy and other armed ships to capture slave ships, and to see to the \\"safe-keeping, support and removal beyond the United States\\" of any Africans found on captured slave ships. In 1820 the capture of \\"negroes or mulattoes\\" for the purpose of enslaving them, and the importation of slaves into the United States, was defined as \\"piracy\\" by an amendment to the Act to Protect the Commerce of the United States and Punish the Crime of Piracy.Noonan: 17-19 Capture and claims On June 29, 1820, the United States Revenue-Marine cutter Dallas captured the slave ship Antelope, carrying some 280 Africans, off the coast of Florida (which was still Spanish at the time) on suspicion that it intended to illegally import slaves into the United States. The ship had been built in the U.S. and named Antelope. It was later sold to a Spanish owner, renamed Fenix, and licensed by the Spanish government to carry slaves from Africa to Cuba. The Antelope had been captured by a privateer at Cabinda, renamed General Ramirez, and used to transport slaves already on board, as well as slaves taken from other ships flying the Portuguese flag, and from an American ship. The Antelope, its crew, and the Africans aboard were taken to Savannah, Georgia.Noonan: 31-32 Captain John Jackson of the Dallas filed a claim (called a \\"libel\\" in admiralty law) in federal court in admiralty in Savannah to be paid either $25 a head for the Africans on the Antelope under the provisions of the 1819 Act in Addition to the acts prohibiting the slave trade, if they were free, or the salvage value as property lost at sea, if they were slaves of Spanish and Portuguese owners. In early August, libels were filed in federal court in admiralty that 150 or more of the Africans aboard the Antelope belonged to the King of Spain, and that 130 belonged to the King of Portugal. Later in August Richard W. Habersham, the United States District Attorney for Georgia, filed a libel in court that under the Act in Addition, the Africans on the Antelope were free, on the grounds that they had been removed from Africa by persons intending to sell them in the United States.Noonan: 32-33, 43, 44 The Slave Ship, an 1840 painting by J.

(American law prohibited U.S. citizens from serving on foreign war ships, and all of the crew on the Columbia had sworn that they were not U.S. citizens.) After the Arraganta captured the Antelope, John Smith became captain of the prize crew on the Antelope, which was renamed General Ramirez.Noonan: 17-19, 27, 29 Smith was put on trial for piracy in December 1820 on three charges, that he had stolen $25 worth of goods from a French schooner attacked by the Arraganta, and that he had participated in the capture of a Portuguese ship and of the Antelope. In 1820 the capture of \\"negroes or mulattoes\\" for the purpose of enslaving them, and the importation of slaves into the United States, had been defined as \\"piracy\\" by an amendment to the :Act to Protect the Commerce of the United States and Punish the Crime of Piracy, but Smith was not charged under that provision. His initial defense was that he was an officer of the Banda Oriental. Evidence was found, however, that he was a citizen of the U.S., and it was thus illegal for him to serve in the military or on a privateer of a foreign country. His lawyer then argued that Smith had renounced his citizenship and become a citizen of the Banda Oriental, that he had relied on the validity of the letter of marque, that he had argued against the capture of the French ship, and that Spanish and Portuguese ships were legitimate targets under the letter of marque. The judge instructed the jurors that Smith had shown no piratical intent, and Smith was acquitted of all charges. After he was acquitted of piracy, Smith filed a libel for the return of the Antelope and its cargo as a legitimate prize.Noonan: 38, 51-53 Trial in admiralty Trial in federal court in admiralty to consider the various libels against the Antelope began in January 1821. The number of Africans on the Antelope that had been taken from various ships (and therefore, their potential owners) was in contention. Three members of the Spanish crew, who had been put ashore when the Arraganta captured the Antelope, were then in Savannah. They testified that there were 166 Africans aboard the Antelope when it was captured. John Smith testified that there were only 93 Africans on the Antelope when it was captured, and that 210 Africans were taken from Portuguese ships. Smith and another member of the prize crew testified that 25 Africans had been taken from the American brig Essex, and that approximately half of those had died or drowned en route.Noonan: 53-55 Result The Supreme Court dismissed the claim by John Smith for return of the Antelope as a prize of war. It calculated that the privateer had taken 93 Africans on the Antelope and 183 from the ships flying the Portuguese flag, noting a lack of proof of the actual nationality of those ships. One hundred twenty survivors of the Africans found on the Antelope were sent to Liberia in July 1827. The people from the Antelope were settled in a new colony, called New Georgia after their home of the prior seven years. Approximately 30 slaves were ruled to be the property of the Spanish claimants and went to slavery in Florida.Noonan:134-35 Swanson:108-09, 177-79 CitationsReferences *Noonan, John Thomas.

Biography King Lizzard was born and raised in Detroit, Michigan, but lived most of his life in Los Angeles, California. He is the son of country singer, songwriter Johnny Colmus who wrote songs for Loretta Lynn and Ernest Tubb. In 1973 he moved to California, where he earned an acting scholarship. From 1979‚Äì1983 he played bass guitar for a band called Legacy, which opened for Cheap Trick, Chuck Berry and Molly Hatchet. Lizzard cites Jimmy Page for his guitar playing style and obsession with the Les Paul Guitar. In 1983 he quit music and worked as an extra in feature films and production scheduling and budgeting for low budget films. In 1997 he moved from Los Angeles to Las Vegas where he performed and recorded with his father and adopted the name King Lizzard. The name came about when a friend from Los Angeles asked if he was going to be a lounge lizard in Las Vegas. He said he was going to be the King Lounge Lizard, and thus became King Lounge Lizard, or K.L. Lizard. In 1999 he dropped \\"Lounge\\" and added another Z. From 1999‚Äì2002 he adopted the space vampire lizard persona, with fangs, top hat and robe, and led King Lizzard's Hearts of Darkness Band. In 2001 King Lizzard married photographer Lana Colmus, who became Queen Lizzard. From 2001 to 2004 he hosted Inside Sin City and Sounds of Sin radio shows on LVRocks Radio. In 2004 Lizzard played his last show with Pieter Holland and Les Warner of The Cult at the Beach Las Vegas. In 2004 he became an ordained minister and purchased crypts at Forest Lawn Memorial Park, Hollywood Hills, for he and his wife, to be buried at the Court of Remembrance near Liberace and Ronnie James Dio. From 2003 to present he has been working for the 57th Wing at Nellis Air Force Base, home of the United States Air Force Thunderbirds. In 2012 King Lizzard joined up with comedian, author and singer Cathe B. Jones, wife of jazz musician and Penn & Teller bandleader Mike Jones, to record the eight song Love Songs in the Key of Death released on April 16, 2013. From 2013 to 2015 he worked on a double concept album entitled EPICK which is a tongue-in-cheek saga of the life, death and rebirth of music as embodied by a fictional space traveler named Mr. MUGI (the Musical Universal Godly Interface). EPICK, which is the Olde English spelling of epic, has 20 tracks, many more than ten minutes in length. It also features many exotic instruments, such as bagpipes, sitar, Theremin and a vintage Oberheim OB-X synthesizer. EPICK was released May 15, 2015. King Lizzard has plans to release it as a double vinyl album. On January 27, 2015, the name King Lizzard was granted a trademark registration number from the U.S. patents and Trademark Office. In 2017 King released two albums, NAMASTE (Hindi for Hello) and ALVIDA (Hindi for Goodbye). NAMASTE was very experimental and featured artificial intelligence in speech synthesis in a vocalist King called Lille Devine. In April through August 2017 King was hospitalized 10 times for heart failure issues. When he was hospitalized in August he contracted pneumonia which lead him to be hospitalized for three months. He was unconscious and intubated for most of that period. In October 2017 the doctors saw no chance of recovery and were going to take him off the ventilator. Miraculously he began recovering and has since made a full recovery. King Lizzard performs all the instruments on his albums, except where noted.

Life Ralph Moor was born on 31 July 1860 at The Lodge, Furneux Pelham, Buntingford, Hertfordshire as son of William Henry Moor (c. 1830 ‚Äì c. 1863), surgeon, by his wife Sarah Pears. Educated privately, and destined for business, he engaged in 1880‚Äì1 as a learner in the tea trade. On 26 October 1882 he entered the Royal Irish Constabulary as a cadet, and becoming in due course a district inspector resigned after involvement in a divorce case on 9 February 1891. In March 1891 Moor took service under Sir Claude Maxwell MacDonald, the Consul-General of the Oil Rivers Protectorate, as Commandant of Constabulary in the protectorate. In July 1892 he was appointed by the Foreign Office vice-consul for the Oil Rivers district, and from 6 September 1892 to 15 February 1893 acted as commissioner. During January 1896 he served the office of consul, and on 1 February 1896, when the district was formed into the Niger Coast Protectorate, he was made commissioner and consul-general for the territory, and consul for the Cameroons and Fernando Po. When in 1900 the protectorate passed from the Foreign Office to the Colonial Office, Moor became High Commissioner of Southern Nigeria and laid the foundations of the new administration. During his years as high commissioner slave trade was abolished in the protectorate, replaced by a growing labour market and cash currency. The Anglo-Aro War (November 1901 ‚Äì March 1902) pacified opposition to British rule, and expanded British influence through several new military posts and new British district headquarters at Bende and Owerri. His health failing, he retired on pension on 1 October 1903. He then allied himself with Sir Alfred Lewis Jones; he gave valuable advice on West African affairs, and aided in the development of the British Cotton Growing Association. He also served on certain committees at the nomination of the secretary of state. Moor was appointed Companion of the Order of St Michael and St George (CMG) in 1895 and Knight Commander (KCMG) in 1897. He was found dead in bed at his residence, The Homestead, Barnes, on 14 September 1909; having committed suicide by poison. He was buried at the new Barnes cemetery. The coroner's jury determined that \\"the poison was deliberately taken whilst temporarily insane after suffering acutely from insomnia\\", they had heard evidence that Moor had suffered for the last four years on his return from Africa with malarial and backwater fever that induced insomnia. Family In 1898, he married Adrienne Shapland (born ca. 1871), the widow of J. Burns.

Detail In England, debtors owing money could be easily detained by the courts for indefinite periods, being kept in debtor's prisons. Approximately 10,000 people were imprisoned for debt each year during the nineteenth century. However, a prison term did not alleviate a person‚Äôs debt; typically, it was required that the creditor be repaid in-full before an inmate was released. Acts of parliament in 1831 and 1861 had begun the process of reform in this area, but further reform was felt necessary. Among the advocates for debtor's reform was Charles Dickens, who, at the age of 12, saw his father sentenced to debtors' prison. Dickens‚Äô novel Little Dorrit was written to encourage debt reform and was set in the Marshalsea debtors' prison where his father was incarcerated. In Victorian England, the concepts of credit and debt were closely linked to that of a person‚Äôs character. Credit was not only determined based on a person‚Äôs assets and income, but also their social status within the community and their adherence to the moral standards of the time. Going into debt was seen as a moral failure, not merely an economic circumstance, and it was punished accordingly. This system typically favored the upper classes. It was more difficult for the working classes to obtain credit; and if they went into debt, the penalties they incurred were more severe than those issued to the upper classes. County Court judges, who presided over debt and bankruptcy cases, often issued rulings based on the belief that the working classes defaulted on their debts deliberately. In contrast, the upper classes were seen as having an honest desire to repay their debt and were given more lenient treatment. Declaring bankruptcy allowed a debtor to avoid prison, but this was not an option available to everyone. Until 1861, it was limited to the merchant class. Furthermore, the cost of filing for bankruptcy was 10 pounds, which represented 10-20% of the average annual income for the common worker in the mid-1860s. The Debtors Act of 1869 significantly reduced the ability of the courts to detain those in debt, although some provisions were retained. Debtors who had the means to repay their creditors but refused to do so could still be imprisoned, as could those who defaulted on payments to the court.Rajak, p.14. Further reform followed through the Bankruptcy Act of 1883. These Acts initially reduced the number of debtors sentenced to prison, but by the early twentieth century, the annual number had risen to 11,427, an increase of nearly 2,000 from 1869. Much of the Act has been repealed, but some provisions, such as section 5 relating to the judgment summons procedure, survive. See also *UK insolvency law NotesReferences * Omar, Paul J.

The origin of the two emission line systems is believed to be a gravitational wave recoil event: the ejection of a supermassive black hole from the center of the host galaxy. In this interpretation, one of the emission line systems originates in gas that is bound to the black hole, while the other set is associated with gas that remains in the galaxy.

Such lines are normally associated with gas far from the center of a galaxy, which is being excited by emission from the central quasar. The second, or \\"blue\\", system consists of broad emission lines, the kind that are generally associated with hot gas very close to the supermassive black hole; these lines are at a redshift of 0.697. The velocity difference between the two emission line systems is 2650 km/s. This puzzling observation is most naturally explained if the black hole was ejected from the nucleus of the galaxy, carrying with it the broad-line gas while leaving behind the bulk of the narrow-line gas. Such ejection is possible, if the black hole formed recently from the merger of two, smaller black holes. The merger is accompanied by the emission of gravitational waves, which can be emitted anisotropically, imparting linear momentum to the merger remnant - in effect, \\"kicking\\" the black hole out of the galaxy. This discovery is important because it indirectly proves that black holes merge and that the mergers can be accompanied by large kicks. This process had been postulated by theory, but never before confirmed via direct observation.

Social competence also reflects having an ability to take another's perspective concerning a situation, learn from past experiences, and apply that learning to the changes in social interactions. Social competence is the foundation upon which expectations for future interaction with others is built, and upon which individuals develop perceptions of their own behavior. Social competence frequently encompasses social skills, social communication, and interpersonal communication. History Past and current research intends to further the understanding of how and why social competence is important in healthy social development. The study of social competence began in the early 20th century. A noteworthy discovery was that social competence was related to future mental health, thus fueling research on how children interact with their peers and function in social situations.. As research developed, different definitions and measurement techniques developed to suit these new findings. In the 1930s, researchers began investigating peer groups and how children's characteristics affected their positions within these peer groups. In the 1950s and 1960s, research established that children's social competence was related to future mental health (such as maladaptive outcomes in adulthood), as well as problems in school settings. Research on social competence expanded greatly from this point on, as increasing amounts of evidence demonstrated the importance of social interactions. Mid-century, researchers began to view social competence in terms of problem-solving skills and strategies in social situations. Social competence was now conceptualized in terms of effective social functioning and information processing. In the 1970s and 1980s, research began focusing on the impact of children's behavior on relationships, which influenced the study of the effectiveness of teaching children social skills that are age, gender, and context specific. In an effort to determine why some children were not exhibiting social skills in some interactions, many researchers devised social information processing models to explain what happens in a social interaction. These models concentrated on factors in interactions such as behavior, how people process and judge each other, and how they process social cues. They also focus on how people select social goals, decide on the best response to a situation and enacting the chosen response. Studies such as this often looked at the relationship between social cognition and social competence. A prominent researcher of social competence in the mid-1980s was Frank Gresham. He identified three sub-domains of social competence: adaptive behavior, social skills, and peer acceptance (peer acceptance is often used to assess social competence). Research during this time often focused on children who were not displaying social skills in efforts to identify and help these children who were potentially at risk of long-term negative outcomes due to poor social interactions. Gresham proposed that these children could have one of four deficits: skill deficits, in which children did not have the knowledge or cognitive abilities to carry out a certain behavior, performance deficits, self-control skill deficits, and self-control performance deficits, in which children had excessive anxiety or impulsivity that prohibited proper execution of the behaviors or skills they knew and understood. Despite all the developments and changes in the conceptualization of social competence throughout the 20th century, there was still a general lack of agreement about the definition and measurement of social competence during the 1980s. The definitions of the 1980s were less ambiguous than previous definitions, but they often did not acknowledge the age, situation, and skill specificity implicit in the complex construct of social competence. Approaches and theories=Peer regard/status approaches= These approaches define social competence based on how popular one is with his peers. The more well-liked one is, the more socially competent they are. =Social skill approaches= These approaches use behaviors as a guideline. Behaviors that demonstrate social skills are compiled and are collectively identified as social competence.. =Relationship approaches= According to these approaches, social competence is assessed by the quality of one's relationships and the ability to form relationships. Competence depends on the skills of both members of the relationship; a child may appear more socially competent if interacting with a socially skilled partner. Commentators on some online incel communities have advocated government programs wherein socially awkward men are helped or women are incentivized to go on dates with them.http://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/entry/socially-anxiety-dating-government- should-pay-women-date-men_n_3293626 =Functional approaches= The functional approach is context-specific and concerned with the identification of social goals and tasks. This approach also focuses on the outcomes of social behavior and the processes leading to those outcomes. Information-processing models of social skills are important here, and based on the idea that social competence results from social-cognitive processes. Models Early models of social competence stress the role of context and situation specificity in operationalizing the competence construct. These models also allow for the organization and integration of the various component skills, behaviors and cognitions associated with social competence. Whereas global definitions focus on the \\"ends\\" rather than the \\"means\\" by which such ends are achieved, a number of models directly attend to the theorized processes underlying competence. These process models are context specific and seek to identify critical social goals and tasks associated with social competence. Other models focus on the often overlooked distinction between social competence and the indices (i.e., skills and abilities) used to gauge it. =Behavioral‚Äìanalytic model= Goldfried and D'Zurilla developed a five-step behavioral-analytic model outlining a definition of social competence. The specific steps proposed in the model include: (1) situational analysis, (2) response enumeration, (3) response evaluation, (4) measure development, and (5) evaluation of the measure. #Situation analysis ‚Äì a critical situation is defined on the basis of certain criteria, which include: ##occurs with some frequency ##presents a difficult response decision ##results in a range of possible responses in a given population. Situation identification and analysis is accomplished through a variety of methods, including direct observation by self or others, interviews, and surveys. #Response enumeration ‚Äì sampling of possible responses to each situation is obtained. Procedures for generating response alternatives include direct observation, role plays, and simulations in video and/or written formats. #Response evaluation ‚Äì the enumerated responses are judged for effectiveness by \\"significant others\\" in the environment. An important element is that a consensus must emerge or the particular item is removed from future consideration. In the last two steps (4 and 5) a measure for assessing social competence is developed and evaluated. =Social information-processing model= A social information-processing model is a widely used means for understanding social competence. The social information-processing model focuses more directly on the cognitive processes underlying response selection, enactment, and evaluation. Using a computer metaphor, the reformulated social information-processing model outlines a six- step nonlinear process with various feedback loops linking children's social cognition and behavior. Difficulties that arise at any of the steps generally translates into social competence deficits. The six steps are: #Observation and encoding of relevant stimuli ‚Äì attending to and encoding non-verbal and verbal social cues, both external and internal. #Interpretation and mental representation of cues ‚Äì understanding what has happened during the social encounter, as well as the cause and intent underlying the interaction. #Clarification of goals ‚Äì determining what one's objective is for the interaction and how to put forth an understanding of those goals. #Representation of situation is developed by accessing long-term memory or construction ‚Äì the interaction is compared to previous situations stored in long-term memory and the previous outcomes of those interactions. #Response decision/selection #Behavioral enactment and evaluation =Tri-component model= Another way to conceptualize social competence is to consider three underlying subcomponents in a hierarchical framework. #Social Adjustment #Social Performance #Social Skills The top of the hierarchy includes the most advanced level, social adjustment. Social adjustment is defined as the extent to which an individual achieves society's developmentally appropriate goals. The goals are conceived of as different \\"statuses\\" to be achieved by members of a society (e.g., health, legal, academic or occupational, socioeconomic, social, emotional, familial, and relational statuses). The next level is social performance ‚Äì or the degree to which an individual's responses to relevant social situations meet socially valid criteria. The lowest level of the hierarchy is social skills, which are defined as specific abilities (i.e. overt behavior, social cognitive skills, and emotional regulation) allowing for the competent performance within social tasks. =The quadripartite model= The essential core elements of competence are theorized to consist of four superordinate sets of skills, abilities, and capacities: (1) cognitive skills and abilities, (2) behavioral skills, (3) emotional competencies, and (4) motivational and expectancy sets. #Cognitive skills and abilities ‚Äì cultural and social knowledge necessary for effective functioning in society (i.e., academic and occupational skills and abilities, decision-making ability, and the processing of information) #Behavioral skills ‚Äì knowledge of behavioral responses and the ability to enact them (i.e., negotiation, role- or perspective-taking, assertiveness, conversational skills, and prosocial skills) #Emotional skills ‚Äì affect regulation and affective capacities for facilitating socially competent responding and forming relationships #Motivational and expectancy sets ‚Äì an individual's value structure, moral development, and sense of efficacy and control. The developmental framework Social competence develops over time, and the mastery of social skills and interpersonal social interactions emerge at various time points on the developmental continuum (infancy to adolescence) and build on previously learned skills and knowledge. Key facets and markers of social competence that are remarkably consistent across the developmental periods (early childhood, middle/late childhood, adolescence) include prosocial skills (i.e., friendly, cooperative, helpful behaviors) and self-control or regulatory skills (i.e., anger management, negotiation skills, problem-solving skills). However, as developmental changes occur in the structure and quality of interactions, as well as in cognitive and language abilities, these changes affect the complexity of skills and behaviors contributing to socially competent responding. Contributing factors=Temperament= Temperament is a construct that describes a person's biological response to the environment. Issues such as soothability, rhythmicity, sociability, and arousal make up this construct. Most often sociability contributes to the development of social competence. =Attachment= Social experiences rest on the foundation of parent‚Äìchild relationships, and are important in the later development of social skills and behaviors. Attachment of an infant to a care-giver is important for the development of later social skills and behaviors that develop social competence. Attachment helps the infant learn that the world is predictable and trustworthy or in other instances capricious and cruel. Ainsworth describes four types of attachment styles in infancy, including secure, anxious‚Äìavoidant, anxious‚Äìresistant and disorganized/disoriented. The foundation of the attachment bond allows the child to venture out from his/her mother to try new experiences and new interactions. Children with secure attachment styles tend to show higher levels of social competence relative to children with unsecure attachment, including anxious‚Äìavoidant, anxious‚Äìresistant, and disorganized/disoriented. =Parenting style= Parents are the primary source of social and emotional development in infancy, early, and middle/late childhood. The socialization practices of parents influence whether their child will develop social competence. Parenting style captures two important elements of parenting: parental warmth/responsiveness and parental control/demandingness. Parental responsiveness (warmth or supportiveness) refers to \\"the extent to which parents intentionally foster individuality, self-regulation, and self-assertion by being attuned, supportive, and acquiescent to children's special needs and demands.\\" Parental demandingness (behavioral control) refers to \\"the claims parents make on children to become integrated into the family whole, by their maturity demands, supervision, disciplinary efforts and willingness to confront the child who disobeys.\\" Categorizing parents according to whether they are high or low on parental demandingness and responsiveness creates a typology of four parenting styles: indulgent/permissive, authoritarian, authoritative, and indifferent/uninvolved. Each of these parenting styles reflects patterns of parental values, practices, and behaviors and a distinct balance of responsiveness and demandingness. Parenting style contributes to child well- being in the domains of social competence, academic performance, psychosocial development, and problem behavior. Research based on parent interviews, child reports, and parent observations consistently find that: * Children and adolescents whose parents are authoritative rate themselves and are rated by objective measures as more socially and instrumentally competent than those whose parents are nonauthoritative. * Children and adolescents whose parents are uninvolved perform most poorly in all domains. Other factors that contribute to social competence include teacher relationships, peer groups, neighborhood, and community. Related problem behaviors An important researcher in the study of social competence, Voeller, states that there are three clusters of problem behaviors that lead to the impairment of social competence. Voeller clusters include: (1) an aggressive and hostile group, (2) a perceptual deficits subgroup, and (3) a group with difficulties in self- regulation. #Children with aggressive and hostile behaviors are those whose acting out behaviors negatively influence their ability to form relationships, and sustain interpersonal interactions. Aggressive and hostile children tend to have deficiencies in social information-processing, and employ inappropriate social problem solving strategies to social situations. They also tend to search for fewer facts in a social situation and pay more attention to the aggressive social interactions presented in an interaction. #Children with perceptual deficits do not perceive the environment appropriately and interpret interpersonal interactions inaccurately. They also have difficulty reading social cues, facial expressions and body gestures. #Children with self-regulation deficits tend to have the classic difficulties in executive functions. Assessments While understanding the components of social competence continue to be empirically validated, the assessment of social competence is not well-studied and continues to develop in procedures. There are a variety of methods for the assessment of social competence and often include one (or more) of the following: * Child-adolescent interview * Observations * Parent report measures * Self-report measures * Sociometric measures (i.e., peer nominations) * Teachers report measures Interventions Following the increased awareness of the importance of social competence in childhood, interventions are used to help children with social difficulties. Historically, intervention efforts did not improve children's peer status or yield long-lasting effects. Interventions did not take into account that social competence problems do not occur in isolation, but alongside other problems as well. Thus, current intervention efforts target social competence both directly and indirectly in varying contexts. =Preschool and early- childhood interventions= Early childhood interventions targeting social skills directly improve the peer relations of children. These interventions focus on at-risk groups such as single, adolescent mothers and families of children with early behavior problems. Interventions targeting both children and families have the highest success rates. When children reach preschool age, social competence interventions focus on the preschool context and teach prosocial skills. Such interventions generally entail teaching problem-solving and conflict management skills, sharing, and improving parenting skills. Interventions improve children's social competence and interactions with peers in the short-term and they also reduce long-term risk, such as substance abuse or delinquent behavior. =School-age interventions= Social competence becomes more complicated as children grow older, and most intervention efforts for this age group target individual skills, the family, and the classroom setting. These programs focus on training skills in problem solving, emotional understanding, cooperation, and self-control. Understanding one's emotions, and the ability to communicate these emotions, is strongly emphasized. The most effective programs give children the opportunity to practice the new skills that they learn. Results of social competence interventions include decreased aggression, improved self-control, and increased conflict resolution skills.

Plot Alan (Anthony Steffen) is a wealthy aristocrat who has just been released from a mental institution following the death of his wife, the red-haired Evelyn. Having caught Evelyn making love with an unknown man prior to his institutionalization, the psychotic Alan begins luring red-haired strippers and prostitutes to his home to torture and kill them, as a way to deal with his grief and inability to get revenge on his deceased wife. Alan attends a s√©ance in which the medium contacts Evelyn, causing Alan to faint. George Harriman (Enzo Tarascio) - Alan's cousin and his only living heir - offers to move into the mansion to take care of him. George takes him to a strip club and Alan takes home Susan (Erika Blanc), one of the strippers at the club who disappears after barely escaping with her life. Afterward, George suggests that Alan would be cured of his instability if he replaces Evelyn with a new bride that resembles her. On his advice, Alan moves to London to get away from his home and marries Gladys (Marina Malfatti), a blonde. Gladys finds herself being haunted by the strange goings-on at her new home and being shunned by Evelyn's brother and Alan's invalid aunt, whom Alan has taken in as staff at his mansion. Gladys tells Alan her suspicions that Evelyn faked her death to escape Alan and run away with her lover. Alan's mental state continues to unravel as Evelyn's brother and Alan's aunt are each killed by a mysterious killer. When he sees a zombified Evelyn beckoning to him from her tomb, he breaks down completely. When Alan is taken away for permanent institutionalization, Gladys and George celebrate, as they had been trying to push Alan back into insanity, with George supposedly impersonating Evelyn, so that he would gain control of Alan's fortune and estate. After they toast their success, Susan appears. George reveals that Susan was the one impersonating Evelyn and that the champagne Gladys is drinking has been poisoned. He stands by as Gladys attacks and kills Susan before succumbing to the poison. However, Alan appears along with Richard Timberlane (Giacomo Rossi Stuart), the doctor who treated him for his first mental breakdown. Alan had suspected he was being manipulated all along and had faked his most recent breakdown to lure out the members of the conspiracy against him. George tries to escape and in the ensuing fight, a bag of sulfur-based fertilizer falls into the nearby pool. The water in the pool becomes acidic and George falls in, getting burned horribly. Getting out of the pool, George is arrested and Alan manages to get away with his crimes. Style Italian film historian Roberto Curti described the film as an example of a hybrid of a Gothic film and the rising popularity of Dario Argentoesque giallo films. Curti noted the Gothic elements combined with the elements of a castle, a crypt, a s√©ance, and a vengeful ghost evoked by a portrait that haunts the main character. Production The Night Evelyn Came Out of the Grave was written by screenwriters, Massimo Felisatti and Fabio Pittorru who had previously worked together on the television miniseries Qui squadra mobile. This film was their second giallo film after The Weekend Murders based on a story by Sergio Donati. The film's score by Bruno Nicolai is lifted from his work with Jes√∫s Franco on their film Eugenie‚Ä¶ The Story of Her Journey into Perversion (1970). Release The Night Evelyn Came Out of the Grave was released in Italy on 18 August 1971 where it was distributed by Cineriz. The film grossed a total of 446,574,000 Italian lire on its domestic release. Curti described its profits in Italy as a \\"reasonable success\\". It was released theatrically in the United States on 26 July 1972 as The Night Evelyn Came Out of the Grave. When shown theatrically in the United States, it was distributed with such gimmicks as theaters serving \\"bloodcorn\\", popcorn that had been dyed red. Several versions of the film circulated which were often edited and/or re-edited, such as the television version titled Evelyn Raises the Dead. =Home video= The film was first released on Blu-ray by Australian distribution company Gryphon Entertainment on 20 June 2013. The film was again released, with wider distribution, by Arrow Films on 30 May 2016 as part of the two-film Emilio P.

They are located between M√ºnster and Coesfeld, which is itself close to the southwest edge of the Baumberge. The hilly terrain has several geological, hydrographic and architectural features.  Natural regions  The Baumberge and their immediate foothills are subdivided into natural regions as follows:Geographische Landesaufnahme: The natural region units on Sheet 83/84 - Osnabr√ºck/Bentheim (Sofie Meisel 1961; centre of sheet), Sheet 95/96 - Kleve/Wesel (Wilhelm von K√ºrten 1977; east) and Sheet 97 - M√ºnster (Sofie Meisel 1960; west) - Bundesanstalt f√ºr Landeskunde, Bad Godesberg ‚Üí maps * (to 54 Westphalian Basin) ** (to 541 Kernm√ºnsterland) *** (to 541.0 Burgsteinfurt Land) **** 541.00 Osterwick Hills (Osterwicker H√ºgelland) - 128 m; gently rolling, NW foothills, separated from the Schr√∂ppingen Ridge by the Vechte river **** 541.02 Sch√∂ppingen Ridge (Sch√∂ppinger R√ºcken) - 158 m; N foothills of the Baumberge **** 541.03 Baumberge - 188 m **** 541.05 Altenberge Ridge (Altenberger R√ºcken) - 117 m; NE gently rolling ridge, parallel to the Baumberge and Sch√∂ppingen Ridge, separated by the stream of the Steinfurter Aa **** 541.07 Coesfeld-Darup Heights (Coesfeld-Daruper H√∂hen) - 166 m; SW foothills of the Baumberge  Location  The Baumberge lie within the M√ºnsterland district of Coesfeld running in a northwest to southeast direction between Billerbeck in the west, the Rosendahl villages of Darfeld in the northwest, Havixbeck in the east, Nottuln-Schapdetten in the southeast and Nottuln in the south, Schapdetten being situated on the southeastern slopes of the hills themselves. On the other side of the Nottuln‚ÄìBillerbeck state road (Landesstra√üe) the hills are separated by a saddle from the Coesfeld-Darup Heights which are up to 166 m high, the southwest foothills of the southern slopes. To the north the Baumberge transition into the Sch√∂ppingen Ridge, which after depression of only a little over 100 m reach a height of 158 m at the Sch√∂ppinger Berg. The A 43 motorway runs past the Baumberge just 2 km to the south (south of Schapdetten) and the A 1 passes 8 km to the east. The northern part of the range is separated by the Baumberge Railway.  Landscape  The Baumberge rise over the otherwise flat landscape to around 100 m reaching their highest point in the Westerberg ; whose summit is crowned by the Longinus Tower. Typical of this landscape a relatively level and treeless plateau with steep wooded edges of uniform height. The plateau is sparsely populated due to its aridity. The highest elevations around the Baumberge are the Sch√∂ppinger Berg near Sch√∂ppingen at 157.6 m, Bentheim Ridge (Bentheimer Hohenr√ºcken) near Bad Bentheim at 91.9 m the Gildehaus Ridge (Gildeh√§user H√∂henr√ºcken) west of it near Gildehaus at around 80 m, the Altenberge Ridge (Altenberger H√∂henr√ºcken) at 113.0 m and the Buchenberg near Burgsteinfurt at 110 m.  Karst hills  A watermill made of Baumberge Sandstone The substratum of the Baumberge consists of a calcareous sandstone that is very porous. As a result, rainwater on the plateau soaks away to a great depth. The farms here have, for centuries, had to bore wells 40 m to 50 m deep to collect drinking water ‚Äì frequently, however, they had to use rainwater cisterns until, in the early 1970s, a drinking water main was laid to them. The rainwater that drains away reappears at the edges of the Baumberge in spring horizons again; sometimes even entire streams can appear at the surface after just a few metres. Several other features of a karst hill range like ponors and sinkholes are also found in the Baumberge.

The official name of the company in French was √âtablissements Minialuxe. History Minialuxe started production of plastic cars about 1954 (some sources say 1959) and ceased production in the late 1970s (Ford Anglia website; Ralston and Forbes 2008, p. 26; Johnson 1998, p. 174). The company was based in the town of Oyonnax in eastern France about 20 miles from Geneva, Switzerland, and about 50 miles northeast of Lyon (where toy makers Norev and Majorette were headquartered). Oyonnax was known for its plastics industry, with experiments in celluloid long before WWII and a new burgeoning industry post-War (Ralston and Forbes 2008, p. 25). One landmark event that saw the area's explosion as a toy center was the local plastics industry's first trade fair which was located in Oyonnax in 1953; Ralston 2007, p. 25). Minialuxe claimed to be the first to produce models in a new plastic called Rhodalite, but apparently Norev beat them by about a year (Ralston 2007, p. 26). Models featured were mostly, but not exclusively, French makes (Sinclair's 1977). There were two main series, a contemporary line and a classic line. Minialuxe appears to have started with the contemporary line, expanding into the classic line around 1970. Collectors traditionally seem to be more interested in the unique selections of the classic series, but all models, though somewhat simpler than the zamac metal diecast of other companies, were clever and included details that were quite endearing. The Contemporary Line The contemporary line was started in 1954 with a few selections and it continued through the mid-1970s. It featured mainly French brands. Renaults seen were the (Dauphine, Floride, 10, 16, Alpine A310, 5, 17), and an Estafette delivery van. Peugeots produced were the (203, 204, 403, 404, 504, and 604), Citro√´ns (11CV Traction Avant, Ami sedan and break, Dyane, M√©hari, DS 19 and 21, SM, CX, and GS), Simcas (Aronde, Versailles, Marly Ambulance, Beaulieu, 1000, 1100, 1300, Oc√©ane, and Aronde Plein Ciel). For plastic, the selection and detail were impressive. Less well known French brands from the 1950s through the 1970s such as the Hotchkiss Gr√©goire, Panhards, and Matras were available and distinct from Norev ‚Äì their main competition (Ralston 2007, p. 26,34). Several models were offered in police livery, especially the Citroen 11CV fourgon (delivery van) which was available for several years in a variety of liveries (Minialuxe Forum website). As time passed, model details and proportions became increasingly more accurate. For example, the Jaguar XK-E was simply stunning and could compare well to any Corgi or Tekno version (Ralston 2007, p. 37). The Hotchkiss (and other cars) were available with various trailers or features such as luggage, skis, or a canoe affixed to the roof (Ralston 2007, p. 37). The Peugeot 604 came with four plastic bicycles, advertising the \\"Grand Prix de la Montagne\\" in Tour de France style (Ralston 2007, p. 39). This was a major difference between Norev and Minialuxe; though Norevs were better detailed, Minialuxe had cars and train accessories without the trains! Available were stop lights, street lights, fire hydrants, gas pumps, signs, policemen directing traffic, garage lifts and other pieces (Ralston 2007, pp. 26‚Äì27, 38‚Äì39). Other non-French makes were a significant part of the line-up. A couple of Volvos, Porsche 911 Targa, Mercedes W196 Grand Prix car, Jaguar E-Type and D-type, a Ford GT Mark IV, a Fiat 124 and a Siata-Fiat were included. European Fords (Consul, Anglia and Taunus), a VW K70, a BMW 1500, and a Vespa 2CV rounded out the offerings. Formula 1 race cars such as a Matra MS80, Ferrari 312B, and a Gordini added extra sport to the line. Minialuxe also made a few motorcycles, a Paris bus, and a couple of trucks. Multiple car gift sets were offered, for example, six Citro√´n Tractions Avant in six different colors in one box, or a BP station with pumps and repair jack. Many of these more contemporary Minialuxe models were part of sweepstakes offers or used as promotionals for different companies, another main difference from Norev. While Norev perfected its own clever marketing ploys, Minialuxe went more for different company promotions. For example, \\"Ch√®que Tintin\\" was a sweepstakes offer based on the comic strip The Adventures of Tintin (Les Aventures de Tintin) where one accumulated coupons or stamps out of magazines and other publications and turned them in for model cars. Another example was a Citroen DS19 sedan with \\"V√™tements Bayard\\" (Bayard Clothing) imprinted (partially melted into the plastic) on the roof. Other cars advertised Bresilia coffee or Delespaul chocolate (Ralston 2007, p. 26). The Classic Line The classic Minialuxe \\"Les Tacots\\" line was started about 1970, after the contemporary line had been in production for almost a decade. The classic line featured 34 vehicles from about 1900 through the 1920s. French vehicles were the most common and included Renaults, Peugeots, Citro√´ns, Panhards and others like a Lorraine-Dietrich, a Balda, a Park Royal, and a De Dion. David Sinclair, who was probably the first to import Minaluxe models to the United States, noted that one interesting selection was a Panhard & Levassor that was one of the first automobiles and one of the earliest cars enclosed in glass (Sinclair's 1977; Levine 2009). A few non-French American cars like variants of the Ford Model T, an early Packard landaulet, the first Oldsmobile Curved Dash model, and an Autocar taxi were offered. British models produced were an early Austin delivery van and a Lanchester. Models were all plastic, but this was ideal for the intricate 'spiderweb' details needed for thin window supports and long narrow wheel spokes seen on early classic cars. The Minialuxe classic line was contemporary to and similar to early Brumm, Rio Models, Cursor, Dugu Miniautotoys or Safir which were all generally plastic. Some models, like the 1910 Renault came in different forms and sometimes had holes in the plastic where windshield or other pieces were placed on other variants ‚Äì which gives the appearance that parts are missing when they are not. While most models appeared well-constructed, some appeared with glue sloppily streaked across body panels. A small series of HO Tacot models were also introduced but Force says that only four were apparently made (Force 1991, p. 150). One very intriguing Minialuxe model was a Hill's 1839 primitive locomotive, similar to George Stevenson's first locomotive built in Newcastle in 1829. Model Details Minialuxe models had both bodies and chassis made of styrene plastic. Early Minialuxe models were fairly simple without windows, had simple chassis, and sometimes one piece tire/wheel assemblies. Early Norevs had better detail and proportion (Ralston 2007, p. 33). Later models were more precisely detailed sometimes with two-tone paint schemes and some opening features (Force 1991, p. 149). Windows were added in the late 1950s, but commonly bodies were molded in clear plastic, then painted except for the windows themselves (Ralston 2007, p 38). Some models suffered from acetate malformation. Usually the only metal parts were axles. Earlier cars had bumpers and chrome parts hand painted in silver while headlights and tail lights were often painted with yellows and reds. Another interesting detail when compared with Norev, was that Minialuxe offered vehicles in two main scales: 1:43 and 1:32, which provided for more detail (Ralston 2007, pp. 26‚Äì27). By 1968 or 1969 interiors, steering wheels, opening hoods and engine detail had all been added on various models (Force 1991, p. 149). Earlier engine detail was painted silver and later, chromed. For example, the Simca 1100 sedan had an opening hood and tail gate. Some models experienced glue distortion under roofs or warping of bodies over time, which is unusual for styrene. Early tires were solid white plastic with solid hubs or with different colored hubs (say beige or dark red) while later tires were a slightly softer polyurethane with simple metal hubs similar to Tekno or Corgi (Ralston 2007, pp. 34‚Äì35). Some plastic wheels were done in a wire style, sometimes in chrome, sometimes just in simple body color. By the 1970s, bodies were better formed with pieces fitting together much better (Force 1991, p. 150). Models were mostly unnumbered in the contemporary line, while the \\"Tacots\\" classic line was numbered. As a case study, on the black plastic base of the BMW 1500 sedan was written the name of the car and \\"1:43\\" then \\"Minialuxe\\" in large letters. Below that it said \\"Minia Stable\\" (steady minialuxe?) possibly referring to the workable suspension ‚Äì and below then \\"suspension brevetee SGDG\\"(meaning 'patented'). The chassis was cut along lines parallel with the length of the car which subsections were supported around the axles giving a springy bounce to the car. Lastly, of course, was \\"Made in France\\" (Force 1991, p. 149). Packaging Early Minialuxe vehicles came in simple cardboard cartons without plastic windows and illustrated with colorful standard artwork of the cars. 'Minialuxe' or 'Jouet Minialuxe' was written on the flaps commonly with the color of the car indicated. Colors were bright and saturated blues yellows, pinks and reds. No matter the model inside, Simcas and Peugeots were commonly shown on each early box, emphasizing French origins (Minialuxe Forum website). The flaps said \\"Les Grandes Marques Francaises\\" (\\"The Great French Makes\\"). In the 1970s, similar to the early German Cursor company, models were offered in a clear flimsy plastic 'box' with a cardboard base. The Duration of Minialuxe It appears that Minialuxe, as a rather sophisticated plastic model maker, lasted about 25 years, though it was not very well known outside France, and less well-known than its main competitor Norev. This is a longer period than several other European diecast model makers ‚Äì whether in plastic or zamac metal. For example, Minialuxe lasted longer than Italian Mebetoys and nearly as long as Polistil, both of which had more company influence (Mattel in the case of Mebetoys) and more international success. Minialuxe models were very practical and realistic and never made any concessions to Mattel's fast axle wheel developments, flashy paint, and Hot Rod hip style which revolutionized the toy car industry. It seems as the company declined, it depended more and more on its Tacots classic series and on adult collectors who prized them. Well-known collector Edward Force says, as far as he could tell, the last 'new' model was introduced in 1974, Like Norev and Politoys, Minialuxe also planned a transition to diecast metal, and produced one model in metal: a Berliet Stradair articulated tanker, but it was the only one (Ralston 2007, pp. 26‚Äì27). Some models like the VW K70 and Renault 30TS were produced in the 1970s, and the last appear to have been in the late 1970s (Force 1991, p. 150; Ralston 2007, p. 27). In any event, by 1980, Minialuxe was gone. References * Ford Anglia website. Ford Anglia Models. Models by Miniluxe. * Force, Dr. Edward. 1991.

It is a subsidiary of Airbus. The company was created in September 2008 as a spin off from the multinational aerospace group EADS, which subsequently rebranded itself as Airbus Group. While a large portion of Premium AEROTEC's business has been derived from its parent company, it has also forged partnerships with other manufacturing groups, including Dassault Aviation, Vought and Lat√©co√®re. The company has positioned itself as a Tier One supplier of aerostructures, which it produces at its facilities in Germany and Romania. History Prior to its establishment as an individual entity, the assets of Premium AEROTEC principally existed within the multinational aerospace group EADS. Its independence came as a consequence of several economic factors affecting the business; during 2007, EADS' management decided to respond to events, such a weakening US dollar and the high investment needed by both the Airbus A380 and A350 XWB airliners, by launching a restructuring initiative intended to streamline the group, divest several non-core activities, and cut costs. Accordingly, in September 2008, three factories were spun off from EADS to form Premium AEROTEC; from the onset, it operated as a wholly owned subsidiary of EADS, which has since been rebranded as Airbus Group. Aerospace periodical Flight International compared the move to Boeing's then-recent spin-off of Spirit AeroSystems. The newly-formed Premium AEROTEC almost immediately committed to expansion in readiness for the production of forward fuselage sections for the A350 XWB airliner. Additional contracts for work on the A350 XWB programme were also received over the following years. In 2009, Airbus announced that, despite the impact of the Great Recession, it would maintain commitments to its suppliers at a steady rate to support them. In June 2010, Premium AEROTEC was reportedly on-schedule for its A350 XWB commitments. In January 2009, Airbus stated its confidence that its recent spin-offs, including Premium AEROTEC, would be ready to seek out their own partners within three to five years. That same year, Premium AEROTEC was reportedly started to actively seek out additional customers for its products; having positioned itself as a Tier One supplier of aerostructures. During 2012, it was announced that the firm had developed a corrugated wing spar on behalf of the North American aerospace firm Boeing. While the company also performs work for a variety of other aerospace manufacturers, Premium AEROTEC remains closely aligned with the needs of Airbus, which is a leading customer as well as the owner of the firm. During 2014, it was announced that the company planned to employ 3D printing technologies in its regular component manufacturing process within two years. In April 2018, Premium Aerotec chose to adopt Skywise, Airbus's digital services platform, with the goal of improving its supply chain processes. During early 2020, Airbus recorded a ‚Ç¨100m restructuring charge in relation to Premium Aerotec. Locations Aerotec operates factories in: * Augsburg, Germany, founded in 1916 by Bayerische Rumpler Werke * Bremen, Germany, founded in 1905 by Deutsche Schiffs- und Maschinenbau AG * Nordenham, Germany * Varel, Germany, founded in 1936 as Motorenwerk Varel; this site includes a close partnership with ThyssenKrupp who provide metal machining and logistics facilities * Ghimbav, Romania, founded in 2011 as Premium AEROTEC's first factory outside of Germany The Varel and Nordenham sites were former Airbus factories; the Augsburg site belonged to EADS Military Air Systems. Products Premium AEROTEC is a tier- one supplier to Airbus; it produces metal components for all Airbus airliners and also award-winning titanium parts for the Airbus A400M A range of large composite parts are also made: * Fuselage sections for the Eurofighter Typhoon are made at Varel, and then assembled in Augsburg. * Fuselage sections for the Airbus A400M; * Several composite sections of the Airbus A350 are being produced, including the aft pressure bulkhead and a 93 square metre panel for the fuselage * On behalf of Vought and Lat√©co√®re, elements are being made for the Boeing 737 and Dassault Falcon.

Born as Wei Hongfu (È≠èÂºòÂ§´), he was a military commander and adoptive son of the founding emperor of the Former Shu kingdom, Wang Jian. He was also known as Gu Chen (È°ßÁêõ) during the time he served under Gu Yanhui around 895. Wang Zongbi continued his rise in power during the reign of Wang Jian's son Wang Zongyan, first as Prince of Julu and then as Prince of Qi. In 925, after Former Shu suffered a number of key defeats at the hands of an invading Later Tang army, Wang Zongbi forced Wang Yan to surrender, hoping that would allow him to retain power in the Xichuan region (Ë•øÂ∑ù, i.e., the region around the Former Shu capital Chengdu). However, the deputy commander of the Later Tang army, Guo Chongtao, viewed Wang Zongbi as untrustworthy and put him to death.  Early life Wang Zongbi was born Wei Hongfu (). It is not known when Wei Hongfu was born, but it is known that he was from Xu Prefecture () in modern Xuchang, Henan. At some point he was adopted by Wang Jian ‚Äì who adopted many officers serving under him as sons ‚Äì and had his name changed to Wang Zongbi. This was before 887, when Wang Jian ruled Lang Prefecture (Èñ¨Â∑û, in modern Nanchong, Sichuan) as its self-proclaimed prefect. In 887, Wang Jian decided to answer the summons of his own adoptive father, the eunuch general Tian Lingzi, to serve under Tian's brother Chen Jingxuan, who was the military governor of Xichuan Circuit (Ë•øÂ∑ù, headquartered in modern Chengdu, Sichuan). As a result, Wang Jian left most of his family with his ally Gu Yanlang, the military governor of Dongchuan Circuit (Êù±Â∑ù, headquartered in modern Mianyang, Sichuan). He headed toward Xichuan's capital Chengdu with nephew Wang Zonghui () and adoptive sons Wang Zongbi, Wang Zongyao (), Wang Zongkan (), Wang Zongji, and Wang Zongbian (). Subsequently, when Chen regretted his decision and tried to stop Wang Jian from coming to Chengdu, Wang Jian broke with him,Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 257. igniting a war that eventually resulted in Wang Jian's victory and seizure of Xichuan Circuit in 891.Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 258.  Service under Wang Jian and Gu Yanhui during the Tang Dynasty  During Wang Jian's campaign to capture Xichuan, Gu Yanlang died and was succeeded by his brother Gu Yanhui at Dongchuan. Wang Jian and Gu Yanlang were friends while both served in the imperial Shence Army; therefore while Gu Yanlang was alive he did not consider seizing Dongchuan, but he began considering so after Gu Yanlang's death while outwardly remaining Gu Yanhui's ally.New Book of Tang, vol. 186. In late 891, Dongchuan was attacked by Yang Shouliang, the military governor of Shannan West Circuit (Â±±ÂçóË•øÈÅì, headquartered in modern Hanzhong, Shaanxi), and Gu Yanhui sought aid from Wang Jian. Wang Jian sent Wang Zongbi, Hua Hong, Li Jian (), and Wang Zongkan to aid Dongchuan, but he secretly instructed them that \\"After you defeat the enemy, Gu Yanhui will surely invite you to a feast. You should ask that it be held in the military camp, and then use the opportunity to seize him, so that we do not need another campaign.\\" After the Xichuan army defeated the Shannan West army and forced its withdrawal, Gu was indeed planning on holding such a feast. However, Wang Zongbi revealed the plan to Gu, for reasons lost to history. Gu claimed an illness and refused to exit Dongchuan's capital Zi Prefecture (). This incident ended the alliance between Wang's Xichuan and Gu's Dongchuan. In 895, while Wang Jian and Gu Yanhui were locked in a war, Wang Zongbi was captured while attacking Dongchuan.Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 260. Gu, remembering what Wang Zongbi had revealed to him, spared him and adopted him as a son, changing his name to Gu Chen. By 897, however, Gu was in desperate straits. His own forces and those of his ally Li Maozhen, the military governor of Fengxiang Circuit (È≥≥Áøî, headquartered in modern Baoji, Shaanxi), had been repeatedly defeated by Wang Jian's forces, leaving Zi Prefecture under siege with no forthcoming aid.Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 261. Gu gathered his family members, including adoptive sons, and prepared for group suicide. Just before his death, however, Gu stated that Gu Chen had not been his adoptive son for a long time and had no need to die with them, so he pointed at the breaches in the city wall and told Gu Chen to leave. Adoptive son Gu Yao () then killed Gu Yanhui and the other Gu family members before committing suicide himself. Gu Chen returned to the name Wang Zongbi and served under Wang Jian again.  Former Shu kingdom= During Wang Jian's reign= In 907, the Tang throne was seized by Zhu Quanzhong, the military governor of Xuanwu Circuit (ÂÆ£Ê≠¶, headquartered in modern Kaifeng, Henan), who started a new Later Liang as its Emperor Taizu. In response, Wang Jian ‚Äì who carried the title of Prince of Shu at the time ‚Äì issued declarations to start a campaign against Later Liang and restore Tang. His allies were Yang Wo, the Prince of Hongnong and the military governor of Huainan Circuit (Ê∑ÆÂçó, headquartered in modern Yangzhou, Jiangsu); Li Keyong, the Prince of Jin and the military governor of Hedong Circuit (Ê≤≥Êù±, headquartered in modern Taiyuan, Shanxi); and Li Maozhen, who then carried the title of Prince of Qi. However, Later Liang vassals did not defect in accordance with the declarations, so Wang Jian himself declared a new state of Shu (known historically as the kingdom of Former Shu) with himself as emperor.Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 266. Wang Zongbi continued to serve in the military of the new Former Shu state, although his initial responsibilities were not recorded in history. In 911, Li Maozhen's state of Qi, which had been an ally of Former Shu, broke that alliance and attacked Former Shu. Wang Zongbi served in the campaign against Qi and was successful in repelling the Qi general Liu Zhijun. Other Former Shu generals defeated other Qi generals, and Qi forces were forced to withdraw.Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 268. As of 918, Wang Zongbi was serving as the commander of the forces against Qi, when Wang Jian became seriously ill. Because Wang Jian considered Wang Zongbi to be calm and full of strategies, he judged Wang Zongbi as an appropriate assistant to his designated heir, the Crown Prince Wang Zongyan, in ruling the state. He thus summoned Wang Zongbi back from the northern border with Qi and put him in command of the palace guards. While Wang Jian was near death, his overseer of imperial stables, Tang Wenyi () tried to start a coup to monopolize power, but Tang's plot was reported to Wang Zongbi and the other senior officials by Tang's subordinate Pan Zaiying (). As a result, Tang was exiled (and later executed), and Wang Jian subsequently entrusted Wang Zongyan to four of his adopted sons ‚Äì Wang Zongbi, Wang Zongyao, Wang Zongwan () and Wang Zongkui () ‚Äì and the eunuch Song Guangsi (). He then died, and Wang Zongyan took the throne under the name Wang Yan.Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 270. = During Wang Yan's reign = Wang Yan created Wang Zongbi the Prince of Julu and also entrusted the governmental affairs to him. Wang Zongbi governed based on the bribes he received and his own likes and dislikes, while Wang Yan did not involve himself in administering the affairs of the state, preferring instead to travel and amuse himself. This was said to be the beginning of the Former Shu state's decline. Subsequently, the eunuch Song Guangsi yielded the command of the military to Wang Zongbi as well. At some point, Wang Zongbi's title was further upgraded to Prince of Qi. By 923, Former Shu's previous main enemy, the Later Liang to the northeast, had been destroyed by Later Tang's founding emperor Emperor Zhuangzong.Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 272. In 924, the Later Tang emperor sent his official Li Yan () as an emissary to Former Shu, ostensibly to establish peaceful relations, while instead intending to spy on Former Shu's readiness. When Li returned to Later Tang, he reported to Emperor Zhuangzong that the Former Shu government, headed by Wang Zongbi and Song Guangsi, was corrupt and easily defeated, while Wang Yan was himself incompetent. Meanwhile, another of Wang Jian's adoptive son, Wang Zongchou (), had become convinced that Wang Yan did not have the ability to govern the state, and he suggested to Wang Zongbi that Wang Yan be removed and replaced. Wang Zongbi hesitated, and Wang Zongchou subsequently died in distress. Wang Zongbi, instead, informed Song and Song's fellow eunuch Jing Runcheng () that Wang Zongchou had wanted to kill them and that he had stopped the plot, to cause them to be grateful to him.Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 273. In late 924, Wang Yan named Xu Yanqiong (), a relative of his mother Empress Dowager Xu, to replace Wang Zongbi as the commander of the imperial forces around the capital Chengdu. This caused dissent among the generals, as Wang Jian had left instructions not to let the Xu family members hold military commands, although Wang Zongbi's own reaction is unknown. As of summer 925, Later Tang's Emperor Zhuangzong was ready to launch a major attack to conquer Former Shu. The campaign was nominally commanded by his son Li Jiji, the Prince of Wei, but actually commanded by the major general Guo Chongtao, nominally Li Jiji's deputy. The Former Shu administration was unaware of the impending attack, and Wang Yan, against the advice by Wang Zongbi and Empress Dowager Xu, insisted on visiting Tianxiong Circuit (Â§©ÈõÑ, headquartered in modern Tianshui, Gansu); he departed in winter 925, just as the Later Tang forces were entering Former Shu territory. Wang Chengjie (), the military governor of Wuxing Circuit (Ê≠¶Ëàà, headquartered in modern Baoji, Shaanxi), reported the emergency to Wang Yan and, after receiving no response, quickly surrendered. Only after the fall of Wuxing did Wang Yan become alarmed, but pursuant to the advice of Wang Zongbi and Song, he stayed at Li Prefecture (Âà©Â∑û, in modern Guangyuan, Sichuan), while sending Wang Zongxun (), Wang Zongyan (ÁéãÂÆóÂÑº, note different character than Wang Yan's original name), and Wang Zongyu () against the Later Tang forces. They, however, were defeated by the Later Tang forward commander Li Shaochen. Wang Yan fled back to Chengdu in fear, leaving Wang Zongbi in charge at Li Prefecture to continue the resistance. Wang Yan also ordered him to execute Wang Zongxun, Wang Zongyan, and Wang Zongyu. However, Former Shu generals were surrendering in droves ‚Äì including Song's brother Song Guangbao (), the acting military governor of Wude Circuit (Ê≠¶Âæ∑, i.e., Dongchuan); Wang Chengzhao (), Wang Zongkan's son and the military governor of Wuding Circuit (Ê≠¶ÂÆö, headquartered in modern Hanzhong, Shaanxi); and Wang Zongwei () the military governor of Shannan Circuit (Â±±Âçó, headquartered in modern Hanzhong). Major general Guo subsequently wrote to Wang Zongbi to persuade him to surrender. Wang Zongbi abandoned Li Prefecture and rendezvoused with Wang Zongxun, Wang Zongyan, and Wang Zongyu at Baitiao (ÁôΩËäÄ, in modern Chengdu); he showed them the execution order and planned with them to surrender. Wang Zongbi, resolved to surrender Wang Yan to Guo, thereafter returned to Chengdu. He seized Wang Yan, Empress Dowager Xu, and all of Wang Yan's sons, putting them under house arrest in the western palace. He then claimed the title of acting military governor of Xichuan and sent emissaries with gifts and food to comfort the Later Tang army. He also wrote a letter to emissary Li Yan in Wang Yan's name, stating that Wang Yan was ready to surrender. Li Yan subsequently arrived in Chengdu to meet with Wang Yan, and he also ordered Wang Zongbi to leave Chengdu defenseless to show good faith for surrendering. Meanwhile, Wang Zongbi, blaming the failure to surrender earlier on eunuchs Song Guangsi, Jing, Li Zhoulu (), and Ouyang Huang (); he executed them and presented their heads to Li Jiji. He also executed a number of other officials that he did not like, and many other officials bribed him to avoid death. Wang Zongbi subsequently sent his son Wang Chengban () to Li Jiji and Guo with a number of Wang Yan's beautiful concubines and ladies in waiting plus treasure, while making the request to be made the military governor of Xichuan. Li Jiji, however, responded, \\"These are all things that belong to my family now. It is not up to you to submit them as gifts.\\" On 15 December 925, Li Jiji and Guo arrived at Chengdu. Wang Yan and the Former Shu officials, with Li Yan leading the procession, formally surrendered to Li Jiji. This ended Former Shu's existence as a state.  After surrender to Later Tang  Meanwhile, Wang Zongbi increased his lobbying of Guo Chongtao ‚Äì including large bribes ‚Äì to recommend him as the military governor of Xichuan. Guo pretended to agree, but did not actually do so. Wang Zongbi then conducted a campaign to undermine Guo: as Li Jiji's trusted eunuch Li Congxi () whispered doubts of Guo's loyalty in his ear, Wang Zongbi led a group of Former Shu officials to meet with Li Jiji and request that Guo be made the military governor of Xichuan, with the aim of making Li Jiji distrust Guo. Meanwhile, however, Song Guangbao submitted an accusation to Guo that Wang Zongbi had falsely accused Song Guangsi and the others whom he had executed. Furthermore, Wang Zongbi's bribes were not sufficient: Guo was not receiving enough treasure to distribute to the Later Tang soldiers as rewards, and the soldiers were becoming angry that they were not being rewarded to their satisfaction. All of this led Guo to decide that Wang Zongbi was unsafe and must be eliminated. On 28 December 925, after requesting and receiving permission from Li Jiji, Guo arrested Wang Zongbi, Wang Zongxun, and Wang Zongwo () under the accusations of disloyalty. He then executed the three men and their families. It was said that the Former Shu officials, hating Wang Zongbi for selling out the state, rushed to eat his flesh.

Plot Two sisters, Kitty and Evelyn, are cursed by a family painting depicting a hundred year-cycle in which a Red Queen is raised from the dead to kill seven times. Hoping to end the cycle, their grandfather, Tobias, orders the painting removed from their sight. Years later Kitty accidentally kills Evelyn during a fight. The death is covered up by their older sister, Franziska, and everyone, including Tobias, is told that Evelyn immigrated to the United States. This doesn't sit well with Kitty, who is willing to allow Franziska to cover up the murder but feels overwhelming guilt. When their grandfather dies from a fear induced heart attack, a series of murders begin to occur around Kitty, all of which appear to have been caused by a red cloaked Evelyn. The police begin to suspect that Kitty and her married lover Martin are the perpetrators of the murders, especially after Martin's institutionalized wife is found dead. It's eventually revealed that Kitty had only stunned Evelyn, who was also not her biological sister - Tobias had adopted her as an additional way of ending the hundred year-cycle. Evelyn's true murderer was Franziska, who murdered her at the start of an impulsive plan to be the only person to inherit Tobias' vast fortune. Resentful that she was not the main beneficiary despite providing his daily care, Franziska recruited some of Kitty's co-workers, who were unhappy of Kitty's station and preferential treatment by Martin. After murdering her female accomplices Franziska tricks Kitty into entering the basement of Tobias' mansion, where she tries to slowly drown her via flooding. Realizing the truth, Martin confronts Franziska and gets a confession, only for the woman to be shot by her own husband, Herbert, who had thus far been complicit with her actions. Herbert then leads the police to Kitty's location, saving her from death, but drowning himself in the process. Kitty and Martin are taken to the hospital.

Description After reports of inadequate performance of the 6.5√ó52mm Mannlicher‚ÄìCarcano at both short and long rangesDunlap, Roy F., Ordnance Went Up Front, Samworth Press (1948), pp. 47-48: The 6.5mm Carcano had reportedly proved inadequate in stopping charges of native tribesmen for a number of years, prompting various stop-gap solutions such as brass-jacketed multiple projectile or frangible explosive bullets, apparently for use against tribesmen in colonial conflicts.Weeks, John, World War II Small Arms, New York: Galahad Books, p. 47: the 6.5mm's blunt bullet and relatively low velocity also gave poor long range performance in machine guns, compared to the cartridges used by most other nations. during the campaigns in Italian North Africa (1924-1934), and the Second Italo- Abyssinian War (1935/36), the Italian army introduced a new short rifle in 1938, the Modello 1938, together with a new cartridge in 7.35x51mm caliber. In addition to the slightly larger caliber, Italian ordnance designers introduced a spitzer-type bullet for the new cartridge, with the tip filled with aluminum to produce an unstable (tumbling) projectile upon impact with soft tissue (a design most likely copied from the .303 British Mk VII bullet). Although the intention was to create a more powerful and precise rifle cartridge, the decision to adopt a lighter bullet than in the 6.5 mm Carcano,http://bobshellsblog.blogspot.com/2008/09/735-carcano-rifle.html Bob Shell's Blog and various design problems of the 91/38 rifle, did not permit the cartridge to achieve the intended success.

Members in a braced frame are not allowed to sway laterally (which can be done using shear wall or a diagonal steel sections, similar to a truss). Types of braced frame The John Hancock Center is a braced tube structure. Most braced frames are concentric. This means that, where members intersect at a node, the centroid of each member passes through the same point. Concentrically braced frames can further be classified as either ordinary or special. Ordinary concentric braced frames (OCBFs) do not have extensive requirements regarding members or connections, and are frequently used in areas of low seismic risk. OCBF steel frame buildings originated in Chicago and reinforced concrete frames originated in Germany and France ‚Äì areas where earthquakes were not an engineering consideration. Accordingly, special concentrically or eccentrically braced frames were later developed with extensive design requirements, and are frequently used in areas of high seismic risk. The purpose of the concentrically- or eccentrically-braced design is to ensure adequate ductility (i.e., to stretch without breaking suddenly).

He painted in oils and tempera, although he is principally remembered for his remarkable graphic art. He was of the founders of the Meduliƒá Society, and the Zagreb Spring Salon of 1916. He exhibited in Zagreb, Belgrade, Ljubljana, Vienna, Paris and Rome.  Biography  Tomislav Krizman was born on 21 July 1882 in Orlovac (now part of Karlovac). He attended the Commerce Academy (Trgovaƒçka akademija), while also studying painting and drawing with Bela ƒåiko≈° Sesija, Robert Auer and Menci Clement Crnƒçiƒá. From 1903 to 1907 he went to Vienna, where he attended the School of Crafts and Academy of Fine Arts studying with William Unger. Krizman remained in Vienna for ten years, an important time in his artistic development, spending time with other artists of the avant-garde secession. He incorporated their ideas into his own art, and participated in the group exhibitions Hagenbund, Jungbund, K√ºnstlerhaus and Secesija (\\"Secession\\"). From 1912, Krizman worked in Zagreb, first as a teacher at the Arts and Crafts School (≈†kola primijenjene umjetnosti i dizajna), then from 1922 in the Graphics Department of the Academy of Fine Arts in Zagreb. He died on 24 October 1955 in Zagreb.  Legacy  Krizman is principally remembered for his remarkable graphic work. He loved to travel, and draw what he saw: views of Vienna, Hrvatsko Zagorje, Bosnia, and Dalmatia. His unusual views of Bosnia, Hercegovina, Kosovo and Macedonia are very evocative and fresh. He created some memorable portraits, including Mary Delvarda, Portret djevojƒçice (\\"Portrait of a Girl\\"), Autoportret (\\"Self-portrait\\"), Me≈°troviƒá and Brat Hinko (\\"Brother Hinko\\"). His knowledge of graphic techniques was published in a book \\"On Graphical Arts\\" (O grafiƒçkim vje≈°tinama), (1952). He wrote books and magazine articles and worked as a costume and set designer for opera and drama. The appearance of posters corresponds with the emergence of the secession or art nouveau movements that arrived in Zagreb in 1898. The poster was a popular image form of the new era, and Tomislav Krizman created memorable poster art for various events of culture, sports, entertainment, and politics. One of his first posters was of the cabaret singer Marya Delvard, who had delighted audience in Vienna and Munich before arriving in Zagreb in 1907. Krizman's image perfectly captured the essential femme-fatale type of art nouveau woman.

History and usage The 9mm Glisenti was developed for the Italian Glisenti Model 1910 pistol, first used in World War I. It was also used in other Italian weapons such as the Beretta Model 1915 and Beretta M1923 pistols, the OVP and Beretta Model 1918 submachine guns, and the Villar-Perosa aircraft submachine gun. The Medusa M47 revolver can also fire 9mm Glisenti ammunition along with many other .38, .357 Magnum or 9 mm cartridges. Specifications The cartridge was based on the German 9√ó19mm Parabellum; in fact, both cartridges are dimensionally identical. However, the powder charge of the 9mm Glisenti cartridge is reduced compared to a typical 9√ó19mm cartridge, making it significantly less powerful, as it is also meant to be used in blowback pistols, which are easier and less expensive to manufacture than locked breech firearms. This means that 9mm Glisenti cartridges will chamber and fire in 9√ó19mm firearms, at the risk of not cycling properly and causing malfunctions, but it also means that 9√ó19mm cartridges will chamber and fire in 9mm Glisenti, presenting a significant risk of catastrophic failure to the firearm, and a risk of injury to the shooter.

Through marriage he was a close connection of the Tudor dynasty.  Background  He was born about 1435, the eldest son of Christopher St Lawrence, 2nd Baron Howth. There is some dispute about the identity of his mother: some sources name her as Anne Plunkett, others as Elizabeth Bermingham. He succeeded to the title in 1464 or 1465.  Career  O'Flanagan calls him \\"a nobleman of considerable abilities, who filled several offices connected with the Government of Ireland.\\" O'Flanagan, J. Roderick. Lives of the Lord Chancellors and Keepers of the Great Seal of Ireland 2 Volumes London 1870 He was High Sheriff of County Dublin in 1456, Chancellor of the Exchequer of Ireland in 1478 and Clerk of the Court of Common Pleas (Ireland). In 1474 he was chosen to be one of the thirteen Knights of the Brotherhood of Saint George, who were charged with defending the Pale against invasion by neighbouring Gaelic clans, and with keeping the peace in the Pale generally. Howth Castle In 1483 Richard III chose him to be Lord Chancellor of Ireland, despite opposition from Gerald FitzGerald, 8th Earl of Kildare, who was then almost all-powerful in Ireland. His continued employment by the Yorkist kings after his second marriage in 1478 is surprising, given that his second wife Joan Beaufort was a close relative of Henry Tudor, who was to overthrow the House of York in 1485. In any event his tenure as Lord Chancellor was short, ending either with his removal or his death. His probably took place later in 1483, although some sources place it as late as 1487.Ball, F. Elrington The Judges in Ireland 1221-1921 John Murray London 1926  Family  Robert married firstly Alice White, daughter of Nicholas White of Killester, and by marriage acquired the manor of Killester. In 1478 he made a second and politically significant marriage to Joan Beaufort, daughter of Edmund Beaufort, 2nd Duke of Somerset and Eleanor Beauchamp. Somerset's seemingly remote claim to the English Crown as the legal heir of John of Gaunt was inherited by his cousin Margaret Beaufort's son Henry VII, who became first Tudor monarch. The St Lawrences, unlike most of the Anglo- Irish nobility, were reliable supporters of the Tudor dynasty: clearly the family connection was too valuable to them not to be taken full advantage of. King Henry VII of England- Lord Howth was his cousin by marriage, and a reliable supporter of the Tudor dynasty. He had six children: *Nicholas St Lawrence, 4th Baron Howth *Thomas St. Lawrence, who became Attorney General for Ireland and a judge of the Court of King's Bench (Ireland)Burkes Peerage *Walter *Christopher *Genet, who married Thomas Fitzsimons *Anne, who married William Golding. Some sources state that his second marriage was childless, however his eldest son Nicholas, who was born about 1460, must have been about twenty years older than his second son Thomas, who was studying law at the Inns of Court in London in 1503 and survived until 1553, so it is likely that Thomas, Walter and Christopher were children of their father's second marriage to Joan Beaufort.

Leech earned an LL.M. from the National Law University in Washington, D.C. in 1886, but decided to remain with the Mint rather than go into legal practice. In 1889, President of the United States Benjamin Harrison named Leech Director of the United States Mint. The New York Times editorialized against the appointment, arguing that Harrison only nominated Leech because of Leech's role in whitewashing a scandal involving Harrison's son, Russell Benjamin Harrison, who had participated in a failed business venture in Helena, Montana while Russell Harrison was in charge of the Assay Office in Helena.\\"Paying for Whitewash\\", New York Times, Oct. 8, 1889 Leech served as Director of the Mint from October 1889 until May 1893.

It is known that the function has infinitely many zeroes on this line in the complex plane: the point at issue is how densely they are clustered. Results on this can be formulated in terms of N(T), the function counting zeroes on the line for which the value of t satisfies 0 ‚â§ t ‚â§ T. Background In 1942 Atle Selberg investigated the problem of the Hardy‚ÄìLittlewood conjecture 2; and he proved that for any :\\\\varepsilon > 0 there exist :T_0 = T_0(\\\\varepsilon) > 0 and :c = c(\\\\varepsilon) > 0, such that for :T \\\\geq T_0 and :H=T^{0.5+\\\\varepsilon} the inequality :N(T+H)-N(T) \\\\geq cH\\\\log T holds true. In his turn, Selberg stated a conjecture relating to shorter intervals, namely that it is possible to decrease the value of the exponent a = 0.5 in :H=T^{0.5+\\\\varepsilon}. Proof of the conjecture In 1984 Anatolii Karatsuba proved that for a fixed \\\\varepsilon satisfying the condition :0<\\\\varepsilon < 0.001, a sufficiently large T and :H = T^{a+\\\\varepsilon}, a = \\\\tfrac{27}{82} = \\\\tfrac{1}{3} -\\\\tfrac{1}{246}, the interval in the ordinate t (T, T + H) contains at least cH ln T real zeros of the Riemann zeta function :\\\\zeta\\\\Bigl(\\\\tfrac{1}{2}+it\\\\Bigr); and thereby confirmed the Selberg conjecture. The estimates of Selberg and Karatsuba cannot be improved in respect of the order of growth as T -> +‚àû. Further work In 1992 Karatsuba proved that an analog of the Selberg conjecture holds for \\"almost all\\" intervals (T, T + H], H = TŒµ, where Œµ is an arbitrarily small fixed positive number. The Karatsuba method permits one to investigate zeroes of the Riemann zeta-function on \\"supershort\\" intervals of the critical line, that is, on the intervals (T, T + H], the length H of which grows slower than any, even arbitrarily small degree T. In particular, he proved that for any given numbers Œµ, Œµ1 satisfying the conditions 0 < Œµ, Œµ1< 1 almost all intervals (T, T + H] for H ‚â• exp[(ln T)Œµ] contain at least H (ln T)1 ‚àíŒµ1 zeros of the function Œ∂(1/2 + it). This estimate is quite close to the conditional result that follows from the Riemann hypothesis.

It diverged from the other Romance languages in the 9th century. At that time, Catalan spread quickly throughout the Iberian peninsula when the Catalan counts conquered Muslim territory. By the 11th century, the Catalan language was present in several feudal documents. Catalan was present throughout the Mediterranean by the 15th century. At that time, the city of Valencia was thriving. Catalan In 1659, the Treaty of Pyrenees was signed, beginning a suppression of the Catalan language. Louis XIV issued a decree that prohibited the use of the Catalan language in Northern Catalonia. The repression continued during the French Revolution when the First French Republic prohibited the usage of Catalan in linguistic education. The repression continued until recently, when finally the French government in 2007 promoted the usage of Catalan publicly and in education. In Spain, the usage of Catalan was also prohibited. In Francoist Spain, Catalan was prohibited in government and education. It was initially prohibited in mass media, but then allowed during the early 1950s. Nevertheless, the publishing of written works in Catalan continued.Marc Howard Ross, Cultural Contestation in Ethnic Conflict, page 139. Cambridge University Press, 2007. Since the death of Franco and the subsequent adoption of the Spanish constitutional monarchy, the Catalan language has been promoted.  Middle Ages = Early Middle Ages= Les Homilies d'Organy√† (12th century), first written in Catalan. By the 9th century, the Catalan language had developed from Vulgar Latin on both sides of the eastern end of the Pyrenees mountains (counties of Rossell√≥, Emp√∫ries, Besal√∫, Cerdanya, Urgell, Pallars and Ribagor√ßa), as well as in the territories of the Roman province and later archdiocese of Tarraconensis to the south. From the 8th century on, the Catalan counts extended their territory southwards and westwards, conquering territories then occupied by Muslims, bringing their language with them. This expansion quickened with the separation of the County of Barcelona from the Carolingian Empire in 988. By the 9th century, the Christian rulers occupied the northern parts of present-day Catalonia, usually termed \\"Old Catalonia\\", and during the 11th and 12th centuries they expanded their domains to the region north of the Ebro river, a land known as \\"New Catalonia\\". During the 13th century, the Catalans expanded to the Land of Valencia and across to the Balearic Islands and Alghero in Sardinia. According to historian Jaume Villanueva (1756‚Äì1824), the first attested Catalan sentence is thought to be found in an 8th-century manuscript from Ripoll that has since been lost. It was a whimsical note in 10th- or early 11th-century calligraphy: Magister m[eu]s no vol que em miras novel (\\"my master does not want you to watch me, newbie\\"). Starting in the 9th century, several feudal documents (especially oaths and complaints) written in macaronic Latin began to exhibit elements of Catalan, with proper names or even sentences in Romance. For example, in the act of consecration of the cathedral of Urgell from 839 the toponymy exhibits clear Catalan traits, like apocope in Argilers < ARGILARIUS, Llinars < LINARES, Kabrils < CAPRILES, and reduction of Latin clusters as in Palomera < PALUMBARIA. Another text, from the early 11th century, exhibits the names of seven fruit trees: Of special historical and linguistic importance is the Memorial of Complaints of Pon√ß IMemorial de greuges de Pon√ß I, comte d'Emp√∫ries, contra Jofre, Compte de Rosell√≥ (ca. 1050‚Äì1060), featuring whole sentences in Romance. By the middle of the 11th century, documents written completely or mostly in Catalan begin to appear, like the Oath of Radulf Oriol (ca. 1028-1047) Complaints of Guitard Isarn, Lord of Caboet (ca. 1080‚Äì1095), and The Oath of Peace and Truce of Count Pere Ramon (1098). The hagiographic poem Can√ß√≥ de Santa Fe from ca. 1054 is not considered one of the oldest Catalan texts because it is hard to tell if it is written in Catalan or Occitan, since its place of composition is unknown and it is difficult to assign it to one language or the other: the two languages were similar to each other at the time. Catalan shares many features with Gallo-Romance languages, which are mostly located in France and Northern Italy. Old Catalan diverged from Old Occitan between the 11th and 14th centuries, although it was not until the 19th century that Catalan was formally considered a separate language, when in 1863 the German philologist Friedrich Christian Diez first put Catalan on the same level as the rest of the Romance languages, though still admitting a close relationship with Occitan. =Late Middle Ages= 300px Catalan enjoyed a golden age during the Late Middle Ages, reaching a peak of maturity and cultural plenitude. Examples of this can be seen in the works of Majorcan polymath Ramon Llull (1232‚Äì1315), the Four Great Chronicles (13th-14th centuries), and the Valencian school of poetry which culminated in Ausi√†s March (1397‚Äì1459). By the 15th century, the city of Valencia had become the center of social and cultural dynamism, and Catalan was present all over the Mediterranean world. The belief that political splendor was correlated with linguistic consolidation was voiced through the Royal Chancery, which promoted a highly standardized language. The outstanding novel of chivalry Tirant lo Blanc (1490), by Joanot Martorell, shows the transition from medieval to Renaissance values, something that can also be seen in the works of Bernat Metge and Andreu Febrer. During this period, Catalan was what Costa Carreras terms \\"one of the 'great languages' of medieval Europe\\". The flowering of the Renaissance was closely associated with the advent of the printing press, and the first book produced with movable type in the Iberian Peninsula was printed in Valencia in 1474: Trobes en llaors de la Verge maria (\\"Poems of praise of the Virgin Mary\\"). 18th century to the present: France Official Decree Prohibiting the Catalan Language in France. After the Treaty of the Pyrenees, a royal decree by Louis XIV of France on April 2, 1700 prohibited the use of the Catalan language in present-day Northern Catalonia. The decree forbade use in any official document, under the threat of being invalidated. Shortly after the French Revolution, the French First Republic prohibited official use of, and enacted discriminating policies against, the nonstandard languages of France (patois), such as Catalan, Breton, Occitan, Flemish, and Basque. The deliberate process of eradicating non-French vernaculars in modern France and dismissing them as mere local and often strictly oral dialects was formalized with Abb√© Gr√©goire's Report on the necessity and means to annihilate the patois and to universalize the use of the French language, which he presented on June 4, 1794 to the National Convention; thereafter, all languages other than French were officially banned in the administration and schools for the sake of linguistically uniting post-Bastille Day France. To date, the French government continues its policy of recognizing French as the country's only official language. Nevertheless, on 10 December 2007, the General Council of the Pyr√©n√©es-Orientales recognized Catalan as one of its official the languages in the Article 1 (a) of its Charte en faveur du Catalan and sought to promote it in public life and education. :Article 1: \\"The General Council of Pyr√©n√©es-Orientales officially recognizes, along with the French language, Catalan as a language of the department.\\" :().\\" 18th century to the present: Spain The Nueva Planta Decrees After the Nueva Planta Decrees, the use of Catalan in administration and education was banned in the Kingdom of Spain. It was not until the Renaixen√ßa that use of the Catalan language saw a resurgence. During the Second Spanish Republic (1931-1939) Catalan became the official language of Catalonia (alongside Spanish), being used extensively by the Generalitat, the Catalan institution of self-government. In Francoist Spain (1939‚Äì1975), the use of Spanish in place of Catalan was promoted, and public use of Catalan was initially repressed and discouraged by official propaganda campaigns. The use of Catalan in government-run institutions and in public events was banned. During later stages of Francoist Spain, certain folkloric or religious celebrations in Catalan were allowed to resume and were tolerated. Use of Catalan in the mass media was initially forbidden, but beginning in the early 1950s, it was permitted in the theater. Publishing in Catalan continued throughout the Spanish State.. There were attempts at prohibiting the use of spoken Catalan in public and in commerce, and all advertising and signage had to be in Spanish, as did all written communication in business.Order from the Excmo. Sr. Gobernador Civil of Barcelona. EL USO DEL IDIOMA NACIONAL EN TODOS LOS SERVICIOS P√öBLICOS. 1940. Following the death of Franco in 1975 and the restoration of democracy under a constitutional monarchy, the use of Catalan increased significantly because of new affirmative action and subsidy policies. The Catalan language recovered its official status and is now used in politics, education and the media, including the newspapers Avui (\\"Today\\"), El Punt (\\"The Point\\"), Ara (\\"Now\\"), La Vanguardia and El Peri√≥dico de Catalunya (sharing content with El Peri√≤dic d'Andorra, printed in Andorra); and the television channels of Televisi√≥ de Catalunya (TVC): TV3, and Canal 33 (culture channel), Super3/3XL (cartoons channel) as well as a 24-hour news channel 3/24 and the sports channel Esport 3; in Valencia Canal Nou, 24/9 and Punt 2; in the Balearic islands IB3; in Catalonia there are also some private channels such as 8TV and Bar√ßa TV.

The film seeks to refute both the documentary Super Size Me and the lipid hypothesis, a theory of nutrition started in the early 1950s in the United States by Ancel Keys and promoted in much of the Western world. Production Naughton first saw Super Size Me as part of his research into a comedy piece he was working on about prejudice against fat people, saying, \\"I watched Super Size Me as part of my research. But the premise and the rather large gaps in logic annoyed me so much, I decided I needed to create a reply. I know some other filmmakers went on McDiets and documented how they lost weight, but as far as I could tell, they weren't funny. If it's true what Mencken said, that the cure for contempt is counter-contempt, then the cure for a funny documentary that's full of bologna is a funny documentary that isn't.\\" In 2013, Naughton released a director's cut of Fat Head on DVD. It includes some slight re-edits, a section at the end of updates in the science in the years since the film came out, and Naughton detailing his family's dietary changes ever since. Synopsis In Fat Head, Tom Naughton questions the claims and ideas expressed by Morgan Spurlock in the film Super Size Me, in which Spurlock exclusively ate McDonald's food for 30 days. Naughton, who examines the nutritional information in McDonald's menu, is skeptical of Spurlock's doctor's statement that Spurlock was consuming 5,000 calories a day, and is unable to obtain Spurlock's food log from Spurlock's representatives. Naughton's website includes a page that lists every item he ate during his month-long experiment, including the nutritional information of his diet. Naughton also criticizes his inference from Super Size Me that consumers are unaware that fast food is high in calories, and argues that no one is forced to eat fast food, as fast food restaurants merely cater to consumer demand, and that if fast food restaurants did not exist, people would satisfy that demand by eating the same food at other restaurants or at home. Naughton also questions Spurlock's claim that his 30-day diet resulted in signs of addiction, in light of the fact that Spurlock apparently had no difficulty in ceasing eating fast food at the end of his experiment. Naughton addresses Spurlock's argument that the current prevalence of obesity cannot have been caused by home cooking or by non-corporate, family-owned restaurants, since they have been around longer than corporate fast food chains. Naughton says that the food people eat at family-owned restaurants is the same unhealthy food eaten at fast food chains, and that the reason the former did not make people obese is because during his generation's youth, families would only eat at them a handful of times a year, and not frequently, as some people do at fast food restaurants. Naughton and his interviewees say that anti-McDonald's sentiment is motivated by anticonsumerism, the desire by lawyers to sue rich corporations rather than family restaurants of comparatively modest means and paternalism by advocacy groups like the Center for Science in the Public Interest. Naughton challenges the notion that the United States is experiencing an obesity epidemic by pointing out that the Centers for Disease Control, which made that assertion in 2004, recanted it the following year. Naughton also questions the use of the body mass index to calculate whether someone is overweight, pointing out that according to the BMI, he himself is considered obese. However, according to the BMI chart for men, at 5'11, 206.5 lbs, Naughton is merely considered overweight; which challenges one of the main premises behind the film that he is considered obese but appears not to be. Naughton's physician tells him that he is obese based on his body fat percentage, which may have led to this confusion. The documentary also focuses on the science and politics behind the nutrition recommendations given by the U.S. government, largely based on the lipid hypothesis, which Fat Head claims is in error on all three of its main propositions. The film claims that the lipid hypothesis has no basis in scientific fact. According to the film, among other sources such as Mark Sisson, there has never been a single scientific study that has linked a high fat diet to increased rates of heart disease. During the film several doctors and dietitians were interviewed and they all stated that according to the latest research in heart disease it is inflammation and not a diet high in saturated fat that causes heart disease and heart attacks, some of whom say the inflammation is caused by high blood sugar. During the film, Naughton goes on an all-fast-food diet, mainly eating food from McDonald's. For his daily dietary intake, he aims to keep his calories to around 2,000 and his carbohydrates to around 100 grams per day, but he does not restrict fat at all. He ends up eating about 100 grams of fat per day, of which about 50 grams are saturated. He also decides to walk six nights a week, instead of his usual three. After a month eating that way, he loses 12 pounds and his total cholesterol goes down. However, his HDL does not go down; this is often thought to be undesirable, as high HDL levels are desirable. At the end of his experiment, Naughton details an additional experiment inspired by his research into the lipid hypothesis. In this second experiment, he cuts out most sugars and starches from his diet for a month, eating foods such as cheeseburgers without buns, eggs and bacon fried in butter, steaks, Polish sausage, fruit in heavy cream, and green vegetables in butter. He uses coconut oil to fry onions for his cheeseburgers and eats fried shredded cheese as a snack. As a result, Naughton says that his energy level and mood have suffered no deleterious effects, despite him often working until 2 AM on a large programming project with a tight deadline. At the end of the month, his overall cholesterol has dropped from 222 to 209, with his LDL having dropped from 156 to 130 and his HDL having increased from 49 to 64.

He represented the counties of Prince George and Amelia in the Virginia House of Delegates, and served as that body's Speaker from 1802 until 1803. Youth Harrison was the eldest son of Nathaniel Harrison (1741-1782) and Mary Ruffin (1746-1767). Nathaniel was the brother of Benjamin Harrison V, signer of the Declaration of Independence. Edmund, just 18 years old at his father's death, offered the following eulogy: \\"Nathaniel Harrison departed this life 24 December 1782. After seeing the last of his two wives and burying two among his children, the eldest of whom, scarcely eighteen, performed the mournful office of seeing the eyes of the dearest of parents forever closed, and his remains decently interred. What now is to become of us, Him only Knows, to Whose Merciful Dispensations we owe our late loss but Hope, the only comfort of the miserable, induces me to believe that all bounteous Providence has still blessings in store for the fatherless. Hard it is that Fate did not find another object whereon to wreak its vengeance than on the tender and only Parent of nine helpless children. Cruel that Providence that thus deprived us of the watchful eyes of the dearest of fathers and left my Inexperience and Youth the only guardian of their tender years. May they find in me the watchful attention of a Father, the greatest proof of brotherly affection and the kind offices of the greatest friend.\\" Marriage and family On January 14, 1787 Harrison married Polly Murray (b. 1771) who died in 1804 and was survived by five of their nine children. Only one of these, Edmond Jr., (1801-1820) lived to maturity. On November 28, 1806 he married Martha Wayles Skipwith (1786 - 1827), daughter of Henry Skipwith and Anne Wayles; Martha was a niece of Mrs. Thomas Jefferson. By Martha, he had nine children, six of whom lived to adulthood: William Henry Harrison (1810-1881); Nathaniel (1812-1875): Lelia Skipwith (1814-1868); Sally Carter (1816-1886); Donald MacKenzie (1818-1872); Septemia (1820-1870?) Political career In the 1801 House of Delegates election for Amelia, Harrison was elected along with John Wily; in 1804 Harrison's electoral fortunes began to fade, when he lost to Thomas Randolph 115‚Äì140. In his last real attempt, he lost to Randolph again in 1805, 99‚Äì109. Upon entry to his office as Speaker in the Virginia House, Harrison on December 30, 1802 wrote to President Thomas Jefferson in reply to a gift received from the latter, \\"Edmund Harrison presents his respectful acknowledgments to Mr. Jefferson,‚Äîthanks him for the parliamentary Manual, which is enhanced in value from the polite and friendly manner in which it was presented. Where the voice of Millions join in the wish that our present chief Magistrate may long fill the exalted station, which he has so much dignified, the single expression of an Individual conforming to that Wish, cannot be deemed intrusive.\\" Harrison served in the military during the War of 1812. Final years The Oaks, built in 1745 in Amelia, Va., was the residence of Edmund Harrison; later owned by the Virginia Museum of Fine Arts. Harrison's inheritance from his father, including a plantation, is thought to have been considerable, as he referenced in his correspondence a responsibility for nearly 100 people. He appears to have been an overly generous person in his later years, but also a very unlucky investor who at times was quarrelsome and even hot-tempered in his efforts to handle delinquent debts. However, there is little doubt of his conviviality, in light of his Speakership in the Virginia House of Delegates. He died of a stroke in Richmond, Va. with a negative net worth. Harrison's home ‚ÄúThe Oaks‚Äù plantation house in Amelia, was built in 1745 by his grandfather, Benjamin Harrison IV, and is said to have been bought by a relative in liquidation of Edmund's debts after his death. In 1927 the home was dismantled and reconstructed in the Windsor Farms neighborhood of Richmond, Va.; it remained in the family until 1975, when it was conveyed by testamentary gift to the Virginia Museum of Fine Arts and became the designated residence of the museum's sitting director until its sale in 2014.

Geography=Location= Palomino is located in the municipality of Dibulla part of the department of Guajira and is only 2 meters above sea level. It is one of the five towns that form the municipality of Dibulla. It is located on the foothills of the Sierra Nevada Mountains of Colombia. The Sierra Nevada de Santa Marta, declared as a Biosphere Reserve by UNESCO, sits as an isolated mountain apart from the Andes chain that runs through Colombia. Reaching an altitude of 5,775 meters above sea level just 42 kilometers from the Caribbean coast, the Sierra Nevada is the world's highest coastal peak. The Sierra Nevada encompasses about 17,000 square kilometers and serves as the source of 36 rivers. Palomino is limited on the north by the Caribbean sea, south with the municipality of San Juan Del Cesar, east by the town of Mingueo and west by the department of Magdalena. Palomino is very close to the Venezuelan border. It borders both the department of Guajira and Magdalena and serves as the border for the municipality of Dibulla and La Punta de los Remedios. Climate Palomino has a tropical monsoon climate (Am) with moderate to little rainfall from December to May and heavy to very heavy rainfall from June to November. Economy=Oil= Palomino's location near the Venezuelan border contributes to commerce, movement of people and economic activity. Since gasoline in Venezuela costs nearly a tenth of what it costs in Colombia, contraband oil plays a large part in the economy of the town. =Agriculture= According to the Farming and Livestock Municipal Sector Plan of 1998‚Äì2000, 70 percent of the people in Palomino are small agricultural producers. They cultivate primarily plantain, yuca, √±ame, corn and mango in an area of 260 hectares. They also cultivate malanga, ahuyama, orange and cacao through very small, inefficient residential vegetable gardens. Very little produce is grown for commercial sale. =Fishing= Fishing is popular but not the main economic activity for the town of Palomino. According to INPA, Characterization of the Artisanal Fishing Activity in the Coastal Municipalities of the Department of Guajira in 2000, the present number of fishermen in the area is 0.4 percent of the total population, producing 99.9 tons cap/year. Local fishes are Snapper, Mero, Medregal, Mackerel, Sea Bass, and Sawfish. =Livestock= In Palomino, livestock is mostly cattle raised for milk and beef. Some of the population has survived by shepherding goats. The production of grass for cattle suffers from the unpredictable Caribbean weather. The technological education and implementation is low as there is a lack of use of fertilizers (organic and chemical) and vaccinations to prevent diseases amongst cattle are nearly non- existent. This causes low production levels and thereby low income generation. =Handcrafts= The handcrafts elaborated among the town's craftsmen are stone sculpture, archeological figurines made out of pottery, straw hats with traditional patterns, fans, baskets, animal figures made with coconut, religious relics, and labor tools made with bull horns. =Tourism= Palomino's paradise attracts a low number of tourists even though the jungle landscape is exotic, there is vast biodiversity, and the beaches are white and uninhabited. Palomino is close to the entrance to Sierra Nevada National Park and close to the Resguardo Indigena, or Indian Reserve area. Especially popular is tubing down the Palomino River. Attracting backpackers traveling along Colombia's coast, there has also been a growth of restaurants, cafes, and hostels in recent years. Among the other tourist attractions are: Demographics Palomino has approximately 3,900 people according to the data projections of INPA in December 2000. Nearly 30 percent of the population in Palomino are children between 1 and 15 years of age. The town is shared by a diverse set of ethnic and cultural groups. The majority of the population is Mestizo, followed by Afro-Colombians, Andean farmers and by traditional indigenous groups. The Kogi and Arhuaco Indians that inhabit the Sierra Nevada Mountains visit Palomino constantly to get sea snails, exchange their handmade products or to perform their native rituals on the beach. There are different places on the coast that the Indians consider sacred and where they perform rituals called the black line, in Spanish ‚ÄúLinea Negra, which was recently recognized by the Colombian State. The Kogi have a low demographic density with a population of 5,847 living in the department of Guajira. They are the most traditional indigenous group and are semi-nomad, constantly displacing themselves through the different areas in the valleys of the rivers Tapias, Jerez, San Miguel, Garavito, Rio Ancho, Rio Mariamina, Rio Negro, San Salvador and Palomino. Colombia is a multi-ethnic nation of Afro-descendents, Amerindians, and Europeans, considered to have the third largest Black/African-descent population in the western hemisphere, following Brazil and the USA. Culture When Spaniards arrived in 1502, they did not tolerate the indigenous culture. Today in Colombia there is still racial segregation and discrimination toward Indians and Afro-Colombians. The notions of class and racism are closely intertwined and the armed conflict has torn the cultural fabric that binds this community together. Palomino has a large variety of ethnic minorities and therefore the culture is diverse and very colorful. The mixing of ethnic traditions is reflected in Palomino's folk dance and music. They have a passion for football sometimes seen as a symbol of unity and pride. The cuisine is developed mainly from the food traditions of the Caribbean. Palomino used to celebrate the patron's saint, San Isidro Labrodor with solemn mass, fireworks and folk dances. Today, due to the cultural syncretism, this activity has been forgotten. It is expected that community leaders should rescue these traditions and religious manifestations. =Religious celebrations=Problems Palomino has long suffered with human rights crisis, loss of cultural identity, intolerance, racial discrimination, lack of clear environmental policies, disappearance of fauna and flora, inefficiency and corruption of the government, abandonment of the authorities and institutions, and even worse the loss of trust in the resolution of conflict and the problems that afflict the inhabitants. The combination of all of these problems coupled with the fact that poverty is highly transmitted from one generation to the next is the main obstacle to the town's sustainable rural development. Inhibiting its progress is the lack of access to social services, education, and skills training. In the past the town has been used as a battlefield of rival drug gangs, FARC, paramilitary groups, and leftist insurgent groups. Over the last few years inspired by the government's aggressive approach to combat guerrilla warfare, the Palomino community is trying to bring peace into their town, restore tourism and improve the lifestyle of future generations. Urban layout Palomino has a linear urban layout that runs from the south, at the San Juan Del Cesar, to the north, at the Caribbean sea. The area is serviced by the highway, Troncal del Caribe, which has split the town into two. It is 300 meters from the beach and 500 meters from the Palomino River. The town square faces the sea and the culture house faces the Sierra Nevada Mountains. Infrastructure=Public sewage system= Palomino has no working sewage system, but one third of the sewage pipes are installed. The problem is serious since the town does not have an oxidation lagoon of residual water; even if the rest of the pipes are installed, the pipes lead to nowhere. There is no treatment facility. sense. Some excreta are treated through latrines (small wastewater systems in deep pits), the river or sea, but mostly people practice open air defecation. In some informal neighborhoods such as the Divino Ni√±o, which is currently under sea level, the latrines and small wastewater systems do not work and flooding during the rainy season causes serious sanitation problems. The health hazards of improper excreta disposal in Palomino are soil pollution, water pollution, contamination of foods, and propagation of flies. People experience diseases such as diarrhea, intestinal parasites, viral hepatitis, typhoid fever, and cholera and nearly 30% of children die of these diseases. =Waste management and garbage collection= The area available for the disposal of solid waste is poorly located on the access road to the beach. The service of garbage collection does not have an organized system to recollect, transport, and dispose of solid waste. It is common to see garbage strewn on the streets since public garbage cans are almost non- existent. The municipality has one garbage collecting truck which services six towns and therefore can only service one small portion of Palomino due to the difficult road conditions. The cost of the service is $2,000 Colombian Pesos per household per month monthly, a large amount for many families living in extreme poverty and not benefiting from the service. A significant amount of the solid waste generated in Palomino is not collected and is either burned openly in the streets or dumped in rivers, the sea or empty lots thereby posing a serious threat to public health. =Aqueduct= Poverty in Palomino limits access to quality water services and safe drinking water. Rivers and springs are often used as open sewers for human waste and garbage disposal. The shortage of drinking water facilities forces people to drink from these polluted open bodies of water causing malaria, intestinal parasites and diarrhea. The existing aqueduct serves only 324 people; only 10 percent of the population benefits from a residential water supply which is an eight meter deep well relying on a 5,000 liter water tank with one turbine. The population increase has caused problems in the distribution of the residential water supply. In some neighborhoods water is supplied through small reservoirs for rain water, wells or cisterns. =Services= *Energy: Energy service is irregularly provided by Electricaribe. Not all the population has electricity. 60% of the population has no electric energy and the 40% who do experience daily outages. *Gas: Service is good and almost the entire population has residential gas. Some people still use wood or coal for cooking. *Education: Palomino's educational facilities are inadequate, teachers are poorly qualified, drop rates are high and many children do not know how to read or write. Palomino has a rural school, Instituci√≥n Educativa Rural San Antonio, with 828 students and 26 teachers. The town has another educational center, San Isidro Labrador, with 80 students and 4 teachers. There are also family benefit homes in the neighborhoods of Divino Ni√±o, La Sierrita and Promigas. Palomino has two primary schools in town and two schools in the indigenous area. *Health: In Palomino there is only one health center servicing approximately 3,900 people. The center has a temporary doctor, a nurse, a dentist that comes once a week. It is currently undergoing expansion to add children development and prenatal control. There are three pharmacies in town. *Telecommunications: Palomino has a Telecom service center with two telephone lines. Informally, street vendors sell cell phone minutes. *Roads: The town's main road is in poor shape and unpaved. The access roads to the town's neighborhoods are in very bad condition, mostly dirt roads with limited access to traffic. The construction of a bridge over the first cross of the San Salvador River is necessary in order to cross the river during the flood season. *Recreation: The town square has a small park, a football field, and a tourist center EMATUR. *Cultural: The town square has a Catholic church. *Administrative: The town has a local police station and a correctional center. Architecture Colombia's architecture is heavily influenced by the Spanish style and modern architecture began appearing after WWII predominantly in cities. The first modern houses in Palomino began arising between 1940 and 1950 when fishermen informally began occupying a territory previously inhabited by the Kogi indigenous tribe. Palomino's urban layout is similar to the layout of many other coastal towns in Colombia, laid out in an orthogonal grid pattern around a town square. Buildings such a Catholic church, a school, a police station and a health center are located around the town square. The first houses in Palomino were single-family dwellings made of wood and covered with a palm leaf roof. Over time they changed and were built with cement and brick. Today there are few houses in Palomino built with wood. The construction of the highway Troncal del Caribe the original urban layout gets disorganized and the town begins to grow along the highway during the 80's. The highway divides the town in two, with newer dwellings built closer to the highway and the mountain and older dwellings situated closer to the sea, and thereby creates a segregation of space. During the 90's informal neighborhoods arise inhabited by displaced families who settle in areas below sea level, constantly flooded, with no street access and no access to public services. The architectural style of Palomino is characterized by small one-story houses on small lots of land, deep and narrow with a patio. The houses used to be made of wood but since the 1970s, construction has shifted to concrete with metal roofs and very small windows. The houses lack ventilation and do not respond to the area's soil and climatic conditions.

It was a part of Nexstar Media Group's Zap2it television news/listings site. History An Internet and statistical analyst, Robert Seidman had previously worked for IBM and Charles Schwab, and published an online newsletter about the Internet and AOL before founding TV by the Numbers; Bill Gorman had been an AOL executive until 1998, and had read Seidman's column. Friends since the early 1990s when they met near Washington, D.C., both were fond of television, as Gorman loved numbers and Seidman enjoyed statistics relating to it; the subject of television ratings data entered into one of their conversations. Gorman was dismayed at being unable to find other blogs devoted solely to television data, and after a Google search confirmed this, he and Seidman thought of the idea for a website devoted solely to the subject. In Gorman's words, while there were sites devoted to disseminating certain subjects, \\"there was no site that did the same thing for the television industry. That is, compile the numbers in a way, and analyze them in a way, that consumers would understand\\". Gorman elaborated in a 2010 interview: > We try to focus on publicly available facts. We're not breaking any news. > We're not interviewing people to try to get the last bit of juicy gossip. We > focus on publicly available, either ratings or financial information, and > what that likely means for your favorite show. Whether they're coming back > or going away. On June 30, 2009, in response to pressure from Nielsen Media Research, TV by the Numbers made large changes to their archives. The main ratings archives no longer go past 2 weeks prior to the date a reader accesses them. On November 10, 2010, TV by the Numbers announced that they were partnering with TV news website Zap2it. As a result, the website's URL changed to a subdomain of the zap2it.com domain. In addition, Zap2it features such as TV listings began to appear on the site. In response to The New York Times decision in 2011 to start charging for access to online content, Gorman wrote an article stressing his website will remain free. In January 2012, Gorman and Seidman expressed interest in hiring writers to do the day-to-day writing on their site. On February 12, 2012, they announced that Sara Bibel and Amanda Kondolojy would be joining the website. On April 3, 2014, Zap2It owner Tribune Digital Ventures purchased the site in full. On January 31, 2020, the website's staff released a statement declaring TV By The Numbers to be inactive starting February 1, 2020. The staff bid goodbye and thanked readers. As of August 2020, its URL redirects to Zap2It's TV listings service. Impact According to one source, much of the information Gorman and Seidman had access to was not readily available to the media, and thus their efforts to analyze the data led to many \\"savvy readers\\" becoming interested in the workings of the ratings process. TV by the Numbers has been cited by such media outlets as CNN, the Associated Press, National Public Radio, and former sister publication the Chicago Tribune. =Harry's Law= TV by the Numbers received criticism from several facets of the television industry for their ratings analyses. Harry's Law star Kathy Bates publicly bashed the website's ideas about ratings and their symbol \\"The Cancellation Bear\\", in an interview for Entertainment Weekly. She stated, \\"Some of these people are just so stupid. I don‚Äôt even get it.... All [they] talk about is the blessed [18‚Äì49] demo this, demo that, and how the Cancellation Bear is gonna eat us and all that stuff. So we‚Äôll see. We'll just see.\\" Harry's Law executive producer Bill D'Elia agreed with Bates, stating in subsequent Twitter messages, \\"WTF is TV by the numbers? Who cares what they think? #harryslaw is most viewed scripted drama on NBC and will return....First, tv by the numbers doesn't know anything. They are misinformed at best, ignorant at worst. Second, Kathy is right.\\" After Harry's Law was cancelled in May 2012 and the site issued a passive-aggressive response to the news, D'Elia again turned to Twitter to express his feelings on the website, stating, \\"TVBTN Negativism fuels belief to not watch shows. He influences viewers to not watch something, self-fulfilling his prophecy. Just awful\\" =Suburgatory= The Cancellation Bear was mentioned in the Suburgatory season 2 episode \\"Body Talk\\". Suburgatory showrunner Emily Kapnek subsequently did an interview with TV by the Numbers, explaining: \\"we just thought it would be really funny to have [the show's] school TV station governed by the same panic and hysteria that everyone feels watching their shows live and die and get discussed online so we thought it was just a really fun shout out because we‚Äôre all on your site all the time.\\" =Galavant= In May 2015, TV By the Numbers predicted that Galavant would be canceled after its first season. After a surprise renewal, the second season began with an episode titled \\"A New Season aka Suck It Cancellation Bear\\" in mockery of the website. Features TV by the Numbers has many features. Most focus on television ratings and the analysis of those ratings. =News categories= The site is well known for its coverage of Nielsen ratings. The following is a list of all of the types of ratings covered by the site: ; Broadcast Overnight : Daily preliminary rating reports for television series airing in prime time on the five major broadcast television networks ‚Äì ABC, CBS, The CW, Fox, and NBC; ratings in this category are published the day after a program airs. ; Broadcast Final : Identical to overnight reports, with the exception of additional processing and revising and are updated on weekdays; ratings for Monday through Thursday's broadcasts are released the following Friday, with ratings for Friday are released on Monday and Sunday's ratings on Tuesdays. Final ratings from Saturday are omitted from this category. ; Cable Final : Rating reports for cable networks, updated on weekdays; the site receives a list of the top 100 cable shows for the night in the 25‚Äì54 age demographic from Nielsen. The site processes the information to list programs by viewers within the 18‚Äì49 demographic. ; Cable News : Ratings lists for programs broadcast on major cable news networks; updated on weekdays ; Broadcast DVR : Lists of programs that have increased their viewership the most after seven days of DVR usage has been indicated; reports in this category are published the second Monday after a show has aired. ; Weekly Broadcast Network : The average ratings for each of the major broadcast networks from the previous week (Monday through Sunday), published on Tuesdays ; Weekly Cable Network : The average ratings for the top cable networks from the previous week; published on Tuesdays ; Top-25 Broadcast Shows : The top-25 television programs on broadcast television, in terms of both total viewers and the 18‚Äì49 age demographic; published on Tuesdays ; Top-25 Cable Shows : The top-25 programs on cable television with identical terms as the above; published on Tuesdays ; Top-25 Syndicated Shows : The top-25 syndicated programs for both cable and broadcast networks; reports in this category have a one-week lag and are published on Tuesdays ; Season-to-Date Broadcast Network : Comparisons of season-to-date ratings for the top-five broadcast networks; published on Tuesdays ; Late Night : Ratings for programs broadcast after 11:30 p.m.; published on Thursdays ; Evening News : Ratings for news programs broadcast in the evening; published on Thursdays ; Morning News : Ratings for daytime news programs; published on Thursdays ; Soap Opera : Ratings for soap operas broadcast in the daytime; published on Fridays =News= TV by the Numbers publishes news stories about schedule changes & ratings in television. These mostly consist of press releases. =Renew/Cancel Index= The Renew/Cancel Index is a mathematical formula developed and used by Gorman to predict whether scripted series on the Big 5 broadcast networks would be renewed or cancelled that season. During the 2007‚Äì2008 broadcast season, Gorman experimented with different ways to predict the fates of television series. They were all unsuccessful, until close to the end of the season when he developed the Renew/Cancel Index. The Renew/Cancel Index differs from Gorman's previous attempts in that it compares a series's average ratings to the average ratings for their own network, as opposed to a basic numerical hierarchy or comparing ratings to an overall average from all the networks. Gorman formulates the numbers by dividing a series's season-to-date ratings average by the season-to-date average of all the scripted series on that network (in the latter half of the season, Gorman uses only numbers since that January for season-to-date numbers, as that seems to help renewal predictions). The resulting number (rounded to the nearest hundredth) shows how a series's average relates to the network's average (which always comes out to 1.00). Using these numbers, Gorman then creates a grading scale. There are five levels on the scale: Certain to be Renewed, Likely to be Renewed, Toss-Up, Likely to be Cancelled, and Certain to be Cancelled. Series above 1.00 are almost always certain to be renewed, while series directly below that are likely to be renewed. The distinction between likely to be renewed and toss-up is at 0.90. Although this number was 0.92 in the original incarnation, it has since changed. The toss-up range continues down to 0.75, when the likely to be cancelled level starts. There is no clear-cut line between the likely to be cancelled and certain to be cancelled levels, but Gorman has said that discerning between likely/certain cancellations is usually just trivial, and thus unimportant. Friday series, being on a lesser-viewed night, are graded differently. The toss-up range is between 0.55 and 0.70, with the numbers above it being likely/certain renewals and the numbers below it being likely/certain cancellations. Gorman does not always follow the index numbers religiously. For example, series that are within a season of reaching the 88-episode mark (the usual requirement for stripped syndication) usually get a large boost. In Fall 2011, Gorman stated that no series that fell into this category would be ranked less than a toss-up. In Fall 2013, he even made the point of putting most series in this category as Certain to be Renewed despite the fact that many of them had not aired yet. On the other hand, he does not take internal issues (contract disputes, scheduling arguments, etc.) into account. The Renew/Cancel index is updated with a new article every Tuesday, from the beginning of the broadcast season in late September to the dates of the network upfront presentations in mid-May. =Bubble Watch= Seidman created the Bubble Watch which, similarly to the Renew/Cancel Index, aims to predict based upon ratings data which television series will be canceled and which will be renewed. It uses a scale for sorting series that is similar to the Renew/Cancel Index, with On the Bubble being identical to Gorman's Toss- Up. Series above the bubble are in the Renewal Predicted category, while series below the bubble are in the Cancellation Predicted category. Unlike the Renew/Cancel Index, the Bubble Watch does not use a mathematical formula. Additionally, it takes the possibilities of future ratings into account, something that Gorman strictly does not do with his index. In the end, though, the predictions of the Bubble Watch and the Renew/Cancel Index are usually very similar. In October 2012, Seidman decided to stop publishing the Bubble Watch and replaced it with a simple list of the renewed and the cancelled series. He did not disclose his reasons, but said that it might or might not be temporary. Many readers were disappointed and expressed their disappointment to Seidman. Seidman recognized that and reinstated the Bubble Watch on November 4, 2012. He stated that readership levels were basically the same for the Bubble Watch and its temporary replacement, but he wanted to \\"give the vocal minority who really cares about the table format the table format they asked for.\\" The Bubble Watch is updated with a new article every Sunday, during the same period as the Renew/Cancel Index. Seidman wrote every update from the Bubble Watch's inception until May 2013. He has taken a break for an unspecified period of time, and longtime reader and occasional contributor Tom Shaw took his place in September 2013. The Bubble Watch did not return for the 2014‚Äì15 season, however Tom Shaw has contributed to Renew/Cancel Index posts and there was a one-week edition of the Bubble Watch in December. =Former features=Scripted Cable Series Renew/Cancel Status Readers of the Renew/Cancel Index and the Bubble Watch inquired many times to Seidman and Gorman about why they did not predict the renewal chances of cable series. In response, Gorman and Seidman explained that the cable networks were not limited to the strict structure of the broadcast networks. This results in them being much more erratic in renewals and cancellations, and thus too hard to predict accurately. Seidman decided to make a compromise of sorts and made a simple list of the renewed and the cancelled cable series. Called the Scripted Cable Renew/Cancel Status, its first post was published on November 7, 2012. The Scripted Cable Renew/Cancel Status explicitly did not predict the fates of television series. It only stated their status. If a series had been cancelled or had been renewed for an upcoming season, it would have been stated in the list. If a series's future beyond the season that was currently airing (or, if the series was on hiatus, the season that had just been previously airing) had not been officially declared by the network, there would have been a blank spot in that series's row on the list. The Scripted Cable Renew/Cancel Status did not include unscripted series, children's and teens' series, late night series on the Adult Swim network, and series airing on minor broadcast networks (such as PBS). These exclusions were necessary to keep the list short. The Scripted Cable Renew/Cancel Status was published every Saturday, a total of 12 times. On March 30, 2013, Seidman announced he would stop publishing the posts, citing low readership as the reason for the discontinuation.

After the death of her husband, John of Saxony, she managed her Wittum, (estates that were assigned to her upon marriage) the Saxon districts of Rochlitz and Kriebstein, earning her the name Elisabeth of Rochlitz.  Childhood and Youth  Her childhood was marked by the struggles of her mother Anna of Mecklenburg-Schwerin against the Hessian nobility. After the death of her father, William II of Hesse in 1509, in violation of the instructions in his testament, they formed a five-member council, chaired by the steward Ludwig von Boyneburg of Lengsfeld. This Council took over the government on behalf of Elizabeth's brother Philip I, and took Anna and her children under guardianship. During this period Elizabeth lived with her mother in Gie√üen, while her brother remained in Kassel under the supervision of Ludwig von Boyneburg of Lengsfeld. Elizabeth and her mother were financially dependent on the Council, who kept them short of money, a fact that was highlighted in 1512. Anna's sister Catherine had married Henry IV of Saxony, and Anna wanted to present Elisabeth at the Saxon court, as she had been promised at a very early age to John, the eldest son of George Duke of Saxony. When Anna requested money to purchase some damask for a dress suitable for court, the request was denied, and the visit then had to be cancelled. In 1514 Anna regained the regency of Hesse. Guardianship of the children was returned to her, although on matters of state she had to consult with an advisory board. The family were reunited and lived together in Kassel.  At court in Dresden  The betrothal contract between Elizabeth and John took place on 8 March 1515, after the Pope issued a dispensation as the couple were related in the fourth degree. In 1516 John came to Marburg, where the nuptials took place, but it was not until January 1519 that Elisabeth began to live permanently at court in Dresden. The marriage took place on 7 June 1519 in Kassel. In Dresden she constantly fought for her independence against Duke George the Bearded and his court officials. Her new husband, the ever-ailing John, did not get along with his overbearing father either. The couple had no children and the pressure at court led Elisabeth to chronic insomnia. During this period she showed her diplomatic skills, restoring the peace between her brother and their mother when Anna wanted to remarry against Philip's objections. Elisabeth mediated again when there was tension between the two regarding matters of religion (her mother held the Catholic faith, her brother favoured Lutheranism). During this period, she also acted as a nurse for Maurice of Saxony.  Rochlitz and Schmalkalden  When John died on 11 January 1537, Elizabeth moved to Rochlitz, a district she had received as Wittum when she married. The Saxon court, however, did not grant her her own budget, putting her in the same situation as her mother. She managed to avoid this, with the help of her brother.During the negotiations on the Wittum treaty in Dresden, Philip I go to know the maid of honor Margaret von der Saale She received the district of Rochlitz (this included the town of Rochlitz, Rochlitz Castle, Mittweida and Geithain) and the Kriebstein district (including Waldheim and Hartha). Consequently, she is referred to by the name \\"of Rochlitz\\". Elisabeth allowed the Lutheran doctrine in her territory from 1537 onwards, while the rest of Saxony under her father in law, still adhered to Catholicism. Her brother sent the Protestant preacher Johann Sch√ºtz to her. She later acted as advisor to Duke Maurice of Saxony when he inherited from his father. In 1540, she exposed the secret bigamy of her brother, Phillip. In Rochlitz, Elisabeth brought up Barbara, the daughter of her brother. After the defeat of the Schmalkalden League, Elisabeth left Rochlitz; her brother gave her the Hessian part of Schmalkalden. She lived here from 1547 at court in Hesse. Her brother fell into imperial captivity, and his wife, Christine of Saxony (1505‚Äì1549) took steps to get him released. During this time, Elizabeth was often in Kassel, in order to supervise the education of Philip's children. In 1556 Elisabeth fell seriously ill, after which her brother set up the first pharmacy in Schmalkalden. She died there on 6 December 1557 and was buried in St. Elisabeth's Church in Marburg, one of the last Landgrave burials there.

Biography James P. Kimball was born in Salem, Massachusetts on April 26, 1836.George Greenlief Evans, Illustrated History of the United States Mint (1892), p. 93 In 1854, he entered the Lawrence Scientific School of Harvard University; after a year he traveled to Berlin to study at the Friedrich-Wilhelms-Universit√§t; he then transferred to the Georg-August- Universit√§t in G√∂ttingen, receiving a Ph.D. in 1857. He then enrolled in mining studies at the Technische Universit√§t Bergakademie Freiberg in Freiberg, Saxony. After making a tour of Europe, Kimball returned to the United States to become an assistant to Harvard University geology professor Josiah Whitney. As Whitney's assistant, Kimball participated in the geological surveys of the lead mining regions of Wisconsin, Illinois, and southeastern Iowa. When the New York State Agricultural College (later merged into Cornell University) was founded in Ovid, New York, Kimball became Professor of Chemistry and Economic Geology. With the outbreak of the American Civil War in 1861, the college's president, Maj. M. R. Patrick was appointed Brigadier- General of Volunteers; Kimball became Brig. Gen. Patrick's Chief of Staff, with the rank of Captain. He saw field service under Maj. Gen. Irvin McDowell, and was present at the Second Battle of Bull Run (August 28‚Äì30, 1862); the Battle of Chantilly (September 1, 1862); the Battle of South Mountain (September 14, 1862); the Battle of Antietam (September 17, 1862); the Battle of Fredericksburg (December 11‚Äì15, 1862); the Battle of Chancellorsville (April 30-May 6, 1863); and the Battle of Gettysburg (July 1‚Äì3, 1863). Brig. Gen. Patrick was then appointed Provost Marshal of the Army of the Potomac, and Capt. Kimball accompanied him there, serving on the General Staff under Generals George B. McClellan, Ambrose Burnside, Joseph Hooker, and George Meade successively. When the army went into winter quarters, Kimball resigned to resume his life as a mining engineer based in New York City. During the 1860s and 1870s he investigated coal and iron mines in Pennsylvania, and silver mines in Chihuahua, Mexico, west Texas, and Utah. He also made recommendations on plant designs, based on European metallurgical practice. After his marriage in 1874, he became an honorary professor of Lehigh University, Bethlehem, Pa. and relocated there, while his professional office remained in New York City. He was among the first American geologists to inspect and write about the mineral resources of Cuba and South America. He was an early member of the American Institute of Mining Engineers, contributed to its Transactions, and served as a vice-president during 1881-1882. He became president of the Everett Iron Company, which played a major role in developing mines in Bedford County, Pennsylvania in 1883-84. In 1885, President of the United States Grover Cleveland named Kimball Director of the United States Mint and Kimball held that office from July 1885 until October 1889. He is best known for his report criticizing the quality of the coinage, which led to improvement in mint equipment. He later served on the annual \\"Assay Commission\\" appointed by the President to ensure quality in coinage. During the 1890s-1900s he resumed his consultant business in New York City. By 1902, he had helped develop the coal fields of Red Lodge, Montana, where he relocated late in life with his son's family. Upon his death the respected Mining & Scientific Press of San Francisco called him \\"one of the pioneer mining geologists of America\\" and one who \\"left a record of clean honorable work.\\" Mining & Scientific Press, November 1, 1913 Kimball married Mary Elizabeth Farley July 22, 1874 in Cambridge, Massachusetts They had three children: Russell, named after a Revolutionary era ancestor, Edith, and Farley.

Currently residing in New York City, he has also worked as a video investigative journalist for The Huffington Post Investigative Fund and a video producer for the US State Department.  Career  Greenstreet's feature debut, This Divided State (2005), captures the agitated climate surrounding Michael Moore's invitation to speak at Utah Valley State College shortly before the 2004 presidential elections. The largely conservative community of Orem erupted with controversy, which Greenstreet approaches from all sides of the debate. The student council‚Äôs decision to book Moore was met with protests, petitions, threats, lawsuits, a $25,000 bribe, and even a special appearance by Sean Hannity, who gives a talk on campus only a few days before Moore‚Äôs arrival. Juxtaposing candidly personal interviews with shots of unruly demonstrations, the film becomes a microcosm of the national political divisions and the debates surrounding free speech. Greenstreet illustrates the escalating obesity epidemic in America with his documentary Killer at Large (2008). The film investigates disturbing trends in how not only food addiction, but stress and fear, under-regulation and misinformation all contribute to the nation‚Äôs swelling weight problems. Examining the often unhealthy state of school lunches and negative influence of kid-oriented advertising, the documentary reveals connections between the government and the food industry, exposing how children are the real victims of this obesity crisis. Highlighting the example of twelve-year-old Brook Bates, whose 2006 liposuction surgery made national headlines, the film contemplates how the indoctrination of children to perpetuate unhealthy habits will supersede laying the blame on personal accountability. The premiere of 8: The Mormon Proposition (2010) at Sundance was met with a lengthy standing ovation despite the intense controversy surrounding it. The film was inspired by ballot measures like California‚Äôs \\"Prop 8,\\" designed to legally prohibit same-sex marriage. Addressing the estimated $22 million Mormons had raised along with internal church documents, the film unravels an extensive campaign carried out by The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church) with intent to influence California‚Äôs voters. Contrasting hard statistics with emotionally charged testimonials from gays and families, 8: The Mormon Proposition reveals the detrimental effect of the LDS church‚Äôs persistent stance on homosexuality. The church has declined all of the filmmakers‚Äô requests for interviews; LDS spokesman Michael Purdy has commented on the matter, ‚ÄúWe have not seen ‚Äò8: The Mormon Proposition.‚Äô However, judging from the trailer and background material online, it appears that accuracy and truth are rare commodities in this film. Clearly, anyone looking for balance and thoughtful discussion of a serious topic will need to look elsewhere.‚Äù In February 2013, it was announced that Greenstreet's next project was a documentary on pop singer Kesha. Greenstreet, along with Lagan Sebert, followed Kesha over two years as she performed in various countries and then returned to the U.S. to record her sophomore album, Warrior.

Located directly south of downtown, Greenwood is often defined as the area delimited by South Riverside Drive to the west, the Mason Rudolph golf course to the east, Ashland City Road (US-41A Bypass/TN-12) to the south, and Crossland Avenue to the north. It is one of the oldest neighborhoods in the city of Clarksville. The cemetery that lies within the community, and also bears its name, is one of the oldest in the state of Tennessee, and is the final resting place of Frank Sutton of Sgt. Carter fame from the show Gomer Pyle, U.S.M.C.. Olympic gold medalist Wilma Rudolph is also buried in Greenwood at a much smaller cemetery, adjacent to the Mason Rudolph golf course. In the early 21st century, the neighborhood had declining conditions of some of its older homes and rising crime rates. The Summit Heights housing project is located in Greenwood, as are the Montgomery County Alternative School, CMCSS headquarters, the Clarksville-Montgomery County Library, and a former boot factory which burned down in 2006. History In the early 20th century, the area known as Greenwood was just starting to develop, a prime location to raise a family at that time; many of the typical bungalow houses of the 1950s still dot the landscape. The area was home to the first Clarksville High School, constructed in 1907 at the corner of Madison Street and Greenwood Avenue. The high school still stands but has been renovated and turned into apartments. Transportation The area is served by several CTS bus routes that go throughout the city. US Route 41-A runs along its southern border with direct access by way of the by pass to I-24. The Clarksville area is served regionally by Outlaw Field airport, and internationally by Nashville International Airport.

Philosophy Domains can be thought of as distinct functional and/or structural units of a protein. These two classifications coincide rather often, as a matter of fact, and what is found as an independently folding unit of a polypeptide chain also carries specific function. Domains are often identified as recurring (sequence or structure) units, which may exist in various contexts. In molecular evolution such domains may have been utilized as building blocks, and may have been recombined in different arrangements to modulate protein function. CDD defines conserved domains as recurring units in molecular evolution, the extents of which can be determined by sequence and structure analysis. The goal of the NCBI conserved domain curation project is to provide database users with insights into how patterns of residue conservation and divergence in a family relate to functional properties, and to provide useful links to more detailed information that may help to understand those sequence/structure/function relationships. To do this, CDD Curators include the following types of information in order to supplement and enrich the traditional multiple sequence alignments that form the foundation of domain models: 3-dimensional structures and conserved core motifs, conserved features/sites, phylogenetic organization, links to electronic literature resources. Content CDD content includes NCBI manually curated domain models and domain models imported from a number of external source databases (Pfam, SMART, COG, PRK, TIGRFAMs). What is unique about NCBI-curated domains is that they use 3D-structure information to explicitly define domain boundaries, align blocks, amend alignment details, and provide insights into sequence/structure/function relationships. Manually curated models are organized hierarchically if they describe domain families that are clearly related by common descent. To provide a non-redundant view of the data, CDD clusters similar domain models from various sources into superfamilies. Searching the database The collection is also part of NCBI's Entrez query and retrieval system, crosslinked to numerous other resources. CDD provides annotation of domain footprints and conserved functional sites on protein sequences. Precalculated domain annotation can be retrieved for protein sequences tracked in NCBI's Entrez system, and CDD's collection of models can be queried with novel protein sequences via * , or at* , that allows the computation and download of annotation for large sets of protein queries.

It is located in Sorocaba region, near the city of Iper√≥, state of S√£o Paulo. Ruins of the twin blast furnaces are well preserved and nearby is Fazenda Ipanema, a small settlement.  History = Background = This important industrial enterprise was the result of careful planning by the Portuguese Crown,Ara√∫jo, P.E.M.; Sporback, S.-G.; Landgraf, F.J.G.: \\"Start up da Siderurgia Moderna\\", Metalurgia e Materiais, v. 66, p. 198-202, 2010 built and operated from 1810 to 1821, continued by the Brazilian Imperial government from 1822 to 1889, closed in 1895 and reopened in 1917 because of the First World War, to be finally closed in 1926. Thousands of tons of cast iron were produced by its twin blast-furnaces. The occurrence of magnetic iron ore at the Ara√ßoiaba Hill, was recognized since 1590 by Afonso Sardinha (father and son). There, in what was called Furnas Valley (now Iron Creek, Ribeir√£o do ferro), they did install a bloomery for making iron by the direct method, in what may be the first attempt of iron manufacturing on American soil. It may have operated for twenty years. Iron samples from that site were subjected to microstructural analysis.1\\\\. MAIA, RAFAEL ROCHA; DIAS, MARCELLI SUSAKI; AZEVEDO, CESAR ROBERTO DE FARIAS; LANDGRAF, F. J. G. Archaeometry of ferrous artefacts from Luso-Brazilian archaeological sites near Ipanema River, Brazil. Rem: Revista Escola de Minas, v.68, p.187 - 193, 2015. Until the arrival of the Portuguese Royal Family to Brazil, in 1808, the manufacture of iron was monitored in the Colony, having been allowed only in restricted periods. The venture started by Afonso Sardinha (father and son) worked where the Portuguese Crown allowed; and after them, Domingos Pereira Ferreira did the same. After the Enlightenment reform of the University of Coimbra, its professor of chemistry Domingos Vandelli encouraged many of his students to study mineralogy and metallurgy. The Portuguese crown sent several of them to travel within Europe. Jose Alvares Maciel was a year and a half in Birmingham, England, and Jose Bonifacio de Andrada e Silva and Manuel Ferreira da Camara toured France, Germany, Italy and Sweden for 8 years. Back from his travels, Bonifacio was commissioned to restore the iron factory of d'Alge Foz, Portugal, where he engaged the German metallurgists Frederico Luiz Varnhagen and Wilhelm Ludwig von Eschwege. Manuel Ferreira da Camara and Aguiar S√° Bittencout returned to Brazil with a project to deploy an iron factory in Minas Gerais. On the arrival of the royal family in Brazil, the two Germans were invited to contribute to the implementation of other iron ventures in Brazil. thumb = Royal Ironworks of St John, Ipanema= D. Rodrigo de Souza Coutinho, minister of D. John VI, instructed Varnhagen and Martim Francisco de Andrada e Silva to design a modern factory to use the iron ore from Ara√ßoiaba. The project was completed in July 1810, including an estimate of the needed investment. The proposal emphasized the need to bring in European experts experienced in technical aspects of ironmaking. The company was established by a Royal Charter in December 4, 1810 as a mixed capital shareholder company, with 13 shares belonging to the Portuguese Crown and 47 to private shareholders of S√£o Paulo, Rio de Janeiro and Bahia. Decisive in the choice of location was the availability of wood to feed the furnaces, and of water to power the air blowing machines and hammers, in proximity to the deposits of magnetite. Thus, the ironmaking activities on the hill of Ipanema are related to the dam built in the waters of the River Ipanema. Rodrigo S. Coutinho created the District of Ipanema and ordered a team of Swedish technicians, hired in December 1809, and led by Carl Gustav Hedberg. The Swedish team brought books, equipment and tools, but did not start building the blast furnaces as they were expected to do. Instead, they built four smaller furnaces for the direct method. These furnaces have since disappeared, as a much larger building was built later on that site, the so-called F√°brica de Armas Brancas. After he got into disagreement with the managing committee, in 1815, Hedberg was replaced by the German Friedrich Ludwig Wilhelm Varnhagen (father of Francisco Adolfo de Varnhagen), this time clearly commissioned to build the blast furnaces of the factory.Rogers. E.J.. The Iron and Steel Industry in Colonial and Imperial Brazil. The Americas, Vol. 19, No. 2 (Oct., 1962), pp. 172-184 Hedberg¬¥s foreman, the Swede Lars Hultgren, stayed with Varnhagen and played a great part in building and operating the furnace. Varnhagen came to Portugal at the invitation of the Portuguese government to direct the Foz de Alge ironworks in 1803. He then traveled to Brazil in 1809, after the royal family and the entire Court moved to Rio de Janeiro. The Royal Ironworks of St John was yet another of those consequences of the arrival of the Royal Family to Brazil in 1808. Varnhagen was successful in the following seven years. He was able to show that the ironworks at Ipanema could be productive and profitable.Manuscripts This ironworks marked the beginning of the production of iron by the indirect method (producing pig iron) in the country. For several periods it produced a ton and a half of iron per day, producing ironplates for kitchen charcoal ovens, pans, ammunition and war material, wire, spades, nails, axes, and sickles. When the Portuguese king D. Jo√£o VI decided to go back to Portugal, Varnhagen followed him, in 1821. Later, the army showed concern and interest towards the national iron industry, so that by mid-nineteenth century, Lieutenant Francisco Carlos da Luz was assigned to coordinate both the technical and the financial aspects of the establishment of such industry. Under the guidance of Johann Bloem, from the blast furnaces of the Real F√°brica de Ferro de Ipanema came guns and ammunition for use in the Liberal Revolt. It also produced many of the items necessary to Brazil in the nineteenth century such as pans, iron rolls for sugarcane mills, iron railings, bars, ladders, lanterns, etc. Some articles won prizes in national and international fairs, at the time. The Ironworks was again supported by the Brazilian Imperial Government from 1865 to 1889, under the leadership of Joaquim de Souza Mursa. During that period, the mine was connected to the ironworks by a 4 km railroad, the old blast furnaces were rebuilt with more capacity, a new iron refining unit was built with technology and technitians from Styria, in Austria, a rolling mill was installed, a mining engineer from Ouro Preto School of Mines was hired to help to run the plant (Mr. Leandro Dupr√©). They had plans to introduce a new, larger, blast furnace and a Bessemer reactor to produce liquid steel, but the operation was interrupted in 1895 due to insufficient income. Considered the birthplace of the national steel industry, the Real F√°brica de Ferro de Ipanema retains less than 20% of its original set. Its twin blast furnaces still exist today and are in the custody of ICMBio through the National Forest of Ipanema, in Iper√≥. Official documents of the factory are archived, and mostly for free consultation at different institutions: National Archives National Library of Brazil (Rio de Janeiro) and File State Public S√£o Paulo (S√£o Paulo).

Clark is a right- handed batsman who bowls right-arm medium pace and who occasionally fields as a wicket-keeper. He was born in Whitehaven, Cumbria and was educated at Sedbergh School. Clark made his debut for Cumberland in the 2007 Minor Counties Championship against Norfolk. The following season he played two further matches in that competition, against Buckinghamshire and Norfolk again. Clark joined Lancashire's Academy in 2008; after two years in the Academy, he was given a scholarship with Lancashire in January 2010. Having represented the Lancashire Second XI in since 2008, Clark made his debut for Lancashire in Lancashire's last List A match in the 2010 Clydesdale Bank 40 against Worcestershire. He scored 32 runs before being dismissed by Jack Shantry. In the winter of 2010/11 Clark suffered a stress fracture to the back. At the start of the 2011 season, Clark's scholarship was renewed and, in June, he made his Twenty20 debut. He scored 19 runs from 11 balls as Lancashire tied with Derbyshire. In October Clark signed his first full-time professional contract with Lancashire. On 24 April 2013 in a second XI game for Lancashire against Yorkshire at North Marine Road Ground, Scarborough, he became only the fifth player to hit six sixes off an over in a professional game, scoring the runs against left-arm spinner Gurman Randhawa.

Life and career In childhood he sang for the Hazzan, Borekh David. Having no interest in education, he was sent to learn a trade, but soon he ran away and began to play small roles in a Russian theaters in Bobruysk, Minsk and other towns. When the Russian troupe fell apart, he went back to Homel, taking part in amateur theatre and opening a dance club. When Leyzer Bernshtein's troupe arrived, he wheedled a place in it.Zalmen Zylbercweig, Leksikon fun Yidishn teater, book two, 1133-1135 He was officially a chorister, unofficially a roadie/stage hand (pekl-treger). He dressed the actors and was a prompter. He finally debuted in Der Pipkiner rav and became the character actor he would remain, playing in different wandering theatre troupes across Russia. He was hired in Warsaw and became popular there as Der Litvisher Komiker (The Litvak comic). In 1912‚Äì13, he played in ≈Å√≥d≈∫ with Zandberg, then back to Warsaw; and at the outbreak of World War I, he was pressed into the Russian army and sent to Harbin, Manchuria, (1916), where he spent his time of military service giving concerts for the officers. After being demobilized, he worked in Avrom Fishzohn's troupe; but in order to support himself, he often had to sing in Russian or English for the American Red Cross. He married Vera Lubow and later wandered toward Japan with his wife, presenting \\"International Concerts\\" (also in China). In 1920, he and his wife left for America and were hired for Boris Thomashevsky's National Theater production of Wolf Shumsky's Lyavke Molodyetz.

Two-term Democratic incumbent Governor Lawton Chiles was term-limited and could not run for re-election. John Ellis \\"Jeb\\" Bush, who had previously run for governor in 1994 was the Republican nominee, and incumbent Lieutenant Governor Kenneth Hood \\"Buddy\\" MacKay was the Democratic nominee. Bush defeated MacKay by nearly 11% of the vote, and won his first of two terms as governor. Jeb Bush was one of four GOP pickups nationwide in the 1998 gubernatorial elections. But the Republican party still netted a loss of one governorship. On December 12, 1998, incumbent Governor Lawton Chiles died, elevating MacKay to governor for 23 days, thrusting him into the office for which he had just lost the election. Candidates=Democratic= *Buddy MacKay, incumbent Lieutenant Governor of Florida =Republican= *Jeb Bush, 1994 Republican nominee for governor Primary results The primary season was largely uneventful, as MacKay (D) and Bush (R) officially ran unopposed for their respective nominations. Initially the Democratic primary saw a three-way race between MacKay, Rick Dantzler and J. Keith Arnold, but the latter two dropped out of the race early on. Dantzler became MacKay's running mate for lieutenant governor, and Arnold ran for Education Commissioner instead. The lack of competitiveness saw a very low turnout of just 16.6% of voters for the September 1 primary. =Democratic primaryRepublican primary=General election Jeb Bush enjoyed double-digit leads in polling through most of the campaign, and had a large fundraising advantage over MacKay. Bush attempted to revamp his image after appearing too hard-right during the 1994 race. Internal struggles amongst key Democratic constituencies, particularly the African-American community, hurt MacKay. MacKay and the Florida Democratic party drew the ire of the black community after state representative Willie Logan, poised to become the first black speaker of the Florida House, was ousted by party leaders. Logan endorsed Bush in the general election. Meanwhile, after receiving only 5% of the African-American vote in 1994, Bush sought to connect to minorities, a group he admittedly ignored in 1994. Setting a tone of compassionate conservatism, and portraying himself as a \\"consensus-building pragmatist,\\" he met with African American leaders, and reached out to Jews and Hispanics. He introduced his Mexican-born wife Columba on the campaign trail, and demonstrated his fluent bi-lingual abilities, particularly in South Florida. MacKay ran from behind for the entire race, and barely managed closed to gap to ten points in the days leading up to the general election. On election day, Bush won by almost 11%. He garnered 61% of the Hispanic vote and 14% of the African American vote, a surprising showing for a Republican seeking statewide office. With his brother George W. Bush winning re-election in Texas, the two brothers became the first siblings to govern two states at the same time since Nelson and Winthrop Rockefeller governed New York and Arkansas from 1967 to 1971. Despite his strong statewide showing, Bush was unable to provide coattails for other republicans further down the ticket. Charlie Crist was easily defeated in his Senate race, and House Republicans did not pick up any seats in the midterms. In the state legislature, the GOP netted no new Senate seats, and picked up only two seats in the House. A little over a month after the election, Lawton Chiles died suddenly of a heart attack. Buddy MacKay, still the sitting lieutenant governor, was sworn in as the 42nd governor of Florida on December 13, 1998, and served out the final 23 days of Chiles' second term. In an ironic twist, MacKay managed to serve in the office he lost the race for, but stated \\"There's no great pleasure in this.\\" MacKay oversaw the state funeral of Chiles, and made a handful of minor appointments, before Bush was sworn in as the 43rd Governor on January 5, 1999. =Results=Videos (1) Midterm Election Coverage, which includes Bush's victory speech from November 3, 1998 (2) Florida Gubernatorial Debate from October 20, 1998 (3) Florida Gubernatorial Debate from October 3, 1998 References 1998 Florida Gubernatorial Jeb Bush ","title":"1998 Florida gubernatorial election"},{"id":"31306627","text":"Jos√© Eduardo P√©rez Ferrada (born 28 July 1985) is a Chilean footballer as an attacking midfielder.

The group is commonly associated with Death Cult (later the Cult), which two Ritual members later joined. History=Formation= Ritual was formed out of the remnants of the Harrow-based punk band General Confusion, which included Steve Pankhurst on drums. Formed in December 1979, General Confusion played its first gig at Watford College supporting Toyah.No Class: 1982Frame: 1998 After two name changes (Suppressed Emotion and Stigma) and personnel shifts (a new drummer, Peter Gould, was brought onboard and Pankhurst switched to saxophone), the band finally settled on a permanent line-up and the name Ritual in 1981. The new line-up consisted of Errol Blyth (vocals), Mark Bond (bass), Pankhurst (saxophone), Ray Mondo (simply referred to as \\"Ray\\", drums), and the newly recruited 17-year-old Jamie Stewart (guitar). The band's name did not carry any religious significance but was instead chosen for its \\"sharpness\\" and the fact \\"it goes with the music to an extent\\".Mark Bond quoted in No Class: 1982 =Demo and John Peel= The group began writing songs which were, according to Bond, \\"written together as a band, although most of the music comes from the more musical Jamie\\". The band compiled a four-track demo (consisting of \\"Human Sacrifice\\", \\"Mind Disease\\", \\"Playtime\\" and \\"Brides\\") to shop around to independent labels in London. As part of their self-promotion of the demo, the band described themselves as a cross between the Birthday Party and Theatre of Hate. The band distributed approximately 60 copies of the tape and received positive responses from two labels (Situation Two and 4AD) but neither was ready to sign the band. Ritual played their first gig at the Windsor Castle in Harrow Road in September 1981. Shortly afterward, they were invited to perform on John Peel's BBC Radio 1 show. The session was recorded on 7 December 1981 (consisting of \\"Playtime\\", \\"Mind Disease\\", \\"Human Sacrifice\\" and \\"Brides\\") at Maida Vale 4 and later broadcast on 14 December 1981. =Songs for a Dead King= While shopping their demo around, the band compiled a cassette tape of live tracks and demo recordings to sell to fans. Titled Songs for a Dead King, it was structured with the material in the format the band wished to record its first album. The majority of the material was never fully developed and only two of the songs made it to the band's two subsequently released singles. A prophetically-named track (for (Stewart), which appeared on the A-side, was simply titled \\"Nine\\". =Touring and \\"Mind Disease\\"= After receiving national exposure via the Peel session, the band spent the majority of 1982 gigging around London, playing some of the more infamous punk and post-punk venues in support of groups like Sex Gang Children.Gimarc: 1997 By mid-year the band had signed with Dave Kitson's independent Red Flame Records, and on 6 October 1982, released the \\"Mind Disease\\" 7\\" single. More London touring followed in support of the release and the band found themselves headlining gigs as well as supporting groups like UK Decay. =Kangaroo Court and dissolution= In February 1983, the band released the Kangaroo Court EP on Red Flame, followed by a few more gigs. By March 1983, the band had dissolved. Mondo was the first to leave, being recruited by Ian Astbury and Billy Duffy to form Death Cult. Stewart was later suggested by Ray Mondo for the bass slot (after the band had auditioned some 30 hopefuls) even though Stewart was a guitarist. Stewart accepted the position and remained with the band after the name change (to the Cult). Blyth and Bond, along with drummer Colin Rocks and ex-UK Decay guitarist Steve Spon, formed in Excelsis in 1983. The band released a number of singles and an album before breaking up in 1984. Bond later former the short-lived band Famous. After the split of Ritual, Pankhurst dropped out of the music business.

Working 15‚Äëhour days along with his employees allowed ATC to grow by 1951 to $3 million in sales.

Case made an offer to merge ATC into Case. This was mutually advantageous as ATC had innovative designs but lacked a strong distribution network whereas Case had not had success in the crawler market, but had an international distribution network. Of particular interest to Case was the backhoe that ATC had developed for its machines. Within the year Case had married the ATC backhoe to a Case 300 series tractor with a loader creating the first factory built and integrated Loader backhoe in the American market.

The position may not necessarily be called a CIO in some institutions. The CIO title is often coupled with Vice President/Vice Chancellor of information technology, is primarily used at doctoral/research institutions, while the titles of Director or Dean are more common at the other five types of Carnegie Classification of Institutions of Higher Education; MA I, MA II, BA Liberal Arts, BA General, and AA. In addition, the CIO title used at different institutions may represent unique positions with differing roles and responsibilities. Ultimately, there is no one definition for a CIO; it has a variety of meanings, functions, areas of purview, reporting structures, and required qualifications. Some traditional executive and administrative positions in higher education, such as a chief financial officer position or chief academic officer/provost have been in existence for a long time and typically have a definite career path. In contrast, the position of CIO in higher education, which has only been around for about 35 years, has no single career path nor single model to explain what can be expected of CIOs in higher education, which makes it a challenge and an opportunity for those interested in preparing for such a role (Brown, 2009; Cash & Pearlson, 2004; Nelson, 2003). Brian L. Hawkins (2004), former president of Educause concluded: ::There is no defined career path for CIOs, nor is there any certification, degree, or even a common body of knowledge that such a ::person should have mastered in order to fulfill this kind of position effectively‚Ä¶finding the right CIO is more about aligning ::personal traits, skills, professional orientation, proven success, and vision with a given campus culture and climate. (p. 100) That being said, research in this field including recent surveys of technology leaders, CIOs and academic leaders in higher education institutions provides data on the current and expected levels of academic degrees of CIOs and their perceived required skill set. This, in turn, may mean that prospective CIOs who prepare in a manner to meet these perceived expectations in terms of academic degrees and skills may be more likely to be successful in being hired into the position of CIO and succeeding at it. The next two sections explore these two areas, that is, the academic degree preparation and skill set needed for CIOs in higher education. Qualifications A review of CIO vacancy positions and requirements between April 2009 and May 2010 from the Chronicle of Higher Education, Educause and HigherEdJobs.com found that only 44.30% of the positions required a graduate degree as a requirement (Brown, 2010a). Brown speculates that position postings that do state a graduate degree requirement are simply attempting to create a larger pool of candidates. Brown (2010b) reported that 79% of CIOs (who responded to his survey) have graduate degrees, and this percentage has been steadily increasing since 2007. According to Brown‚Äôs 2010 survey, 58% of CIOs have master's degrees while 21% have a doctorate. Of those possessing a doctorate, these CIOs were working in all types of institutions ranging from doctoral-granting institutions to those with a special focus. About one third of these CIOs were working at a Master‚Äôs institutions while another third were working at a doctoral-granting institution. In contrast, his survey showed that the majority of CIOs with a master's degree as their highest level of academic preparation were working at institutions granting only associate degrees. In terms of degree majors for CIO positions, Brown found that 40% of the job postings did not identify the major preferred and another 44% requested a computer related major, or in IT or business. 46% of CIOs and 48% of members of the institution management team believed that the degree major was not important (Brown, 2010a). On a related note, the top four degree majors for technology leaders which comprised 70% of the responses were technology, business, education and administration (Brown, 2010a). Skill-sets What skill set is needed to successfully serve in the role of Chief Information Officer in higher education? A review of the literature provides some useful perspectives. Linda Fleit (1999), the former president and founder of the IT Consulting Firm Edutech International from 1985 to 2008 and through this experience, well acquainted with the role CIOs in higher education institutions, indicated seven areas which she felt were requirements for CIOs. These included (as cited in Hawkins, 2004): 1) a clear vision about the role on information technology in higher education; 2) excellent oral and written communication and listening skills; 3) ability to form alliances and relationships with key campus constituents; 4) the ability to work collaboratively and effectively; 5) the ability to make and back hard decisions; 6) the ability to manage resources judiciously, and 7) deep expertise and knowledge in at least one aspect of technology. Cash and Pearlson (2004), representing the Harvard Graduate School of Business Administration and the Concours Group, respectively, identify leadership, business and technical competencies as essential for CIOs in higher education. Carol A. Cartwright (2002), who served as president of Kent State University from 1991 to 2006 and who is currently serving as president of Bowling Green State University, sought several essential qualifications in a CIO who would be expected to serve as a full-fledged member of her ‚Äúexecutive orchestra‚Äù: proven leadership skills, strong management skills, and an understanding of the difference between these two. Wayne Brown (2010b), the CIO at Excelsior College who has conducted annual surveys with CIOs and executive management on the role and effectiveness of CIOs since 2003, surveyed 440 CIOs in higher education in 2010 to determine what they considered the top skills needed to be effective in their positions. Brown (2010b) reported that a CIOs‚Äô top five skills in order were: communication skills, leadership, technical knowledge, interpersonal skills and higher education knowledge. The same question posed to members of the management team at higher education institutions revealed that they ranked the same top five skills as important but in a different order: technical knowledge, communication skills, leadership, higher education knowledge, and interpersonal skills. Lastly, Hawkins (2004) identified five skills that he believed were critical to success as a CIO in higher education: strong communication skills, boundary-spanning ability (i.e. the ability to work across the silos that often exist at institutions), leadership ability, management experience, and a strong understanding of the academic environment. Although there is some variance in the literature as to the best skills and competencies to possess to succeed as a CIO in higher education, the common elements across most of these appear to include leadership skills, management skills, communication skills, business knowledge, higher education experience/knowledge, interpersonal skills, and technical skills/deep knowledge in one aspect of technology. What is unclear in the literature is the quantity and quality of these skills, but most likely these will vary depending on the individual institutional context. Career prospects According to Brown (2010b), in 2010 59% of CIOs responding to his survey were over 51 years of age compared to 55% in this age bracket in 2009. In addition, he reported that 47% of CIOs in 2010 planned to retire within the next 10 years. Furthermore, his report showed that the average CIO tenure in higher education in 2010 was an average of 6 years, 8 months, which is a drop from 2007 where the average tenure was 7 years, 5 months. The combination of these factors---the aging CIO, retirement plans, the faster change-over in CIO positions‚Äîpresents a promising picture of job prospects for those seeking CIO positions in higher education in coming years.
