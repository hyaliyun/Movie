It opened in 1872 and a substantial residential passenger traffic built up. The line was 4 1/2 miles long. Passenger usage fell off sharply in the mid-twentieth century and the passenger service was discontinued in 1951. A basic goods train service continued until the line finally closed to all traffic in 1967. There is no railway use of the line nowadays. History Before the Penicuik Railway System map of the Penicuik RailwayBy 1848 most of the great trunk railways of Scotland had been built, as well as a considerable number of branches. Communities in rural areas found that a railway connection reduced the cost of necessities considerably, and made it cheaper to get local manufactures to market. Conversely places without a railway suffered. The Peebles Railway opened in 1855, transforming the economy of the town. The Peebles Railway ran on high ground well to the east of the River North Esk. The area around Penicuik itself was found to be rich in minerals, and the Shotts Iron Company established extensive ironstone and coal pits in the locality. The mineral had to be carted to Eskbank station, a considerable inconvenience. The Caledonian Railway was known to be planning a railway to Penicuik from Slateford, and this alarmed the North British Railway (NBR), which wished to keep the area exclusively under its own control, and keep the rival Caledonian company out. The NBR encouraged the promotion of the Esk Valley Railway, which opened as far as Polton in 1867. The line primarily served paper mills adjacent to the river, and because of the terrain was unsuitable for connecting to the pits. This left the mining around Penicuik still to be connected, and two independent railways were promoted to connect to the mines: the Edinburgh, Loanhead and Roslin Railway and the Penicuik Railway. The Penicuik line sprang into active promotion in December 1869, causing some friction with the supporters of the Loanhead line, who had been working up their scheme for several years. The NBR agreed to work and maintain the Penicuik line in perpetuity for 45% of gross receipts.David Ross, The North British Railway: A History, Stenlake Publishing Limited, Catrine, 2014, Both were nominally independent and sponsored by the NBR, and both obtained Parliamentary authorisation on the same day, 28 June 1870.Thomas (NBR, volume 1, page 106) says 20 June 1870E F Carter, An Historical Geography of the Railways of the British Isles, Cassell, London, 1959Peter Marshall, Peebles Railways, Oakwood Press, Usk, 2005, John Thomas, The North British Railway, volume 1, David & Charles, Newton Abbot, 1969, The Penicuik Railway The Firth Viaduct near Auchendinny The Penicuik Railway obtained its authorising Act on 28 June 1870; the capital was ¬£72,000 for the four mile line.Christopher Awdry, Encyclopaedia of British Railway Companies, Patrick Stephens Limited, Wellingborough, 1990, The Company's engineer was Thomas Bouch. The terrain was difficult, for the line followed the sinuous River North Esk, which runs between steep hillsides on both sides; the line crossed the River North Esk seven times in two and a half miles, and there was a viaduct and two tunnels. The line left the Peebles Railway at Hawthornden, and there were stations at Rosslyn and Auchendinny as well as Penicuik.John Thomas, Forgotten Railways, Scotland, David and Charles, Newton Abbot, 1976, The line opened for goods traffic on 9 May 1872 and to passengers on 2 September 1872.Ross, Carter, Paterson and Awdry; Thomas (Forgotten Railways, page 48) and Munro say 2 July. Eskbridge station was added on 1 July 1874.John Thomas revised J S Paterson, A Regional History of the Railways of Great Britain: Volume 6, Scotland, the Lowlands and the Borders, David and Charles, Newton Abbot, 1984, W and E A Munro, Lost Railways of Midlothian, self published by W & E A Munro, 1985 The Board of Trade Inspecting Officer visited the line on 12 and 19 January 1872 to consider approval for passenger train operation. There was a gunpowder factory at Roslin Glen close to the line, and concern had already been expressed about the danger from sparks from engines, and the Inspecting Officer ordered the Penicuik Company to build a tunnel or other cover for the line at that point. It was formed as a 300 yard long metal tubular structure. Although it was the mineral working around Penicuik which had prompted the idea of the line, in fact it served paper mills primarily; they required copious supplies of water and were located in the valley floor. It was the ELRR, running at a higher level on the west side of the River Esk, which actually connected into the mineral workings. In 1875, the Shotts Iron Company sank a new shaft at Greenlaw near Glencorse Barracks, and (encouraged by the NBR) the ELRR sought Parliamentary authority to extend the line to serve the mine. This was opposed bitterly by the Penicuik Railway, who saw it as an encroachment. The Penicuik Company had hoped to serve the mine workings but the ELRR line would interpose itself, and be more convenient. Finally the two companies agreed to pool all traffic south of Auchendinny on the Penicuik line and all traffic south of Roslin on the ELRR. Taken over by the North British The Penicuik Railway was absorbed by the North British Railway, authorised by Act of Parliament of 13 July 1876 and effective on 1 August 1876. The North British promised that they would \\"in all time coming keep up as efficient a passenger train service as at present\\".Chairman of Penicuik Railway at final Shareholders' Meeting, quoted in Thomas. The Penicuik Railway shares were exchanged at par. The line served several paper mills, and the attractive nature of the area encouraged residential travel by Edinburgh professionals. The line prospered for many years as an outer suburban branch, and for many years the railway was the only practicable means of residential travel to Edinburgh. Passenger train service The sixteen mile train journey from Penicuik to Edinburgh took about 40 minutes. In 1895 there were five Monday to Friday departures, with an additional two on Saturday. In 1922 this had become five plus one, and in 1938 it was five plus three.Bradshaw's General Steam Navigation and Railway Guide, 12th mo, (December) 1895, reprinted by Middleton Press, Midhurst, 2011, Bradshaw's General Railway and Steam Navigation Guide, 7th mo, (July) 1922, reprinted by Guild Publishing, London, 1985Bradshaws July 1938 Railway Guide, David & Charles Publishers, Newton Abbot, 1969, In 1949 the train service had four departures Monday to Friday, five on Saturday. Closure and current use Cycle path tunnel near Auchendinny Auchendinny station was closed on 5 March 1951, and the branch closed to passenger traffic on 10 September 1951, the last train having run two days earlier http://disused-stations.org.uk/p/penicuik/index.shtml The last passenger train on the branch was a railtour on 29 August 1964.https://www.sixbellsjunction.co.uk/60s/640829_1.html There were two landslides on the line in 1966, and at that time the only remaining traffic was an occasional goods train to Penicuik. The cost of the rectification considerably exceeded income, and the line was closed to all traffic on 27 March 1967, and the tracks were quickly lifted. Part of the line forms a section of the National Cycle Network as route 73.http://www.sustrans.org.uk/assets/files/scotland/Penicuik_to_Dalkeith.pdf Topography It is believed that the main station building at Penicuik dated from the Napoleonic Wars and was used as a kitchen for feeding French prisoners of war.

The Damiaatjes refer to two bells in the St. Bavochurch of Haarlem that ring every night between nine and nine thirty, to signal the closing of the city's gates and commemorate the conquest of the Egyptian city Damietta during the Siege of Damietta (1218). Though Haarlem no longer has a wall around the city, or gates to close, the bells are still rung every evening. Damietta is also mentioned during the Fifth Crusade in 1218/1219, and again during the Seventh crusade in the year 1249. The Haarlem story claims that Haarlem knights and innovative shipbuilders played an important role in the fall of Damietta. Access to the city via the Nile was closed with a large, heavy harbor chain. A Haarlem ship with a saw on the bow (in Dutch called the \\"zaagschip\\") was equipped with an iron saw fastened along the bow and front keel. This ship sawed through the Damietta harbour chain and allowed the fleet to attack the city, which was a success. The Damietta story is however contradicted by the eyewitness account of Oliver of Cologne, who led the Dutch fleet, and who never mentioned the heroic actions of the Haarlem knights.

Designed by architect John V. Bennes and built in 1919, it was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1982. When it opened in 1920, the 48-room hostelry was the city's only hotel. A flash flood along Willow Creek destroyed one former hotel in 1903, and fire destroyed the other in 1918. Originally named the Hotel St. Patrick, it was soon renamed the Heppner Hotel. Measuring at ground level, the hotel covers nearly all of the downtown lot on which it rests. As of 1982, it was the largest and tallest commercial structure in the city. The three-story building is made of hollow clay tile and concrete with stucco facades and frameless windows. The west facade of the ground floor had a narrow central bay for the main entrance, and it was flanked by structural bays and bay windows opening on interior commercial space. The architecturally plain hotel had little exterior or interior decoration; however, the rooms on the second and third floors were capacious, and three-fourths of them had private baths.

It was seminal in reviving theatrical culture in Scotland. Founding Curtain Theatre was founded by Grace Ballantine, Molly Urquhart and Paul Vincent Carroll with the aim to support new Scottish writing for the stage and develop Scottish styles of performance at a time when Scotland's own native theatre traditions had been all but lost. It emerged from the dissolution of RF Pollock's short-lived Tron Theatre Club in 1932. Productions In the seven years between 1933 and 1939, the Curtain produced a full annual programme of plays and launched the careers of a number of playwrights, actors and impresarios who would be influential to the rising Scottish drama of the twentieth century, most notably Paul Vincent Carroll, Robert McLellan and Duncan Macrae. One of its most famous productions was the premiere of McLellan's play, Jamie the Saxt. Its early productions were by subscription in a dedicated small studio theatre which the company established at a private address close to the city's University district. After 1935, productions were mounted in Glasgow's Lyric Theatre. Influence Curtain Theatre in its original form folded soon after the outbreak of World War II, although one of its members opened the Park Theatre next door to what had been the Curtain Theatre. Although it was short-lived, the Curtain Theatre activities as a dynamic amateur company played a vitally important part in reviving theatrical culture in Scotland, giving new Scottish actors a home- grown base for developing Scottish self-expression in the theatre arts, and breaking open new paths in the movement which eventually led to the re- establishment of native professional theatre in the country in the 1940s.

His research in comparative philology was directed chiefly toward the dialects of Malaysia and Polynesia and those of Central and Northwestern America. He worked closely with Wilhelm and Alexander von Humboldt. Biography His early schooling was at the school of the Jacobi-Kirche (1811-1814), and then at the Domschule in Magdeburg (1814-1823). He then studied (1823-1827) at the University of Berlin under B√∂ckh, Wolf, and Hegel, and at the University of G√∂ttingen under Bopp. Then he was a tutor in Mexico, where he gave much attention to the Aztec and other languages. He returned to Germany via the United States, France and the Netherlands. In Germany, he settled in Berlin where he was introduced by Bopp to Wilhelm von Humboldt, whom he assisted from 1829 to 1835 in the preparation of his work on the Kavi language in Java. Humboldt also recommended Buschmann to the royal library in Berlin, where he became an assistant in 1832. After Humboldt's death in 1835, Buschmann was the sole author of the third volume, which contained a comparative grammar of the South Sea and Malay languages. The Berlin Academy put him in charge of editing the whole work (3 vols., Berlin, 1836-1840). Buschmann also published Humboldt's vocabulary of the Tahitian language in his Aper√ßu de la langue des √Æles Marquises et la langue ta√Øtienne (1843). Alexander von Humboldt employed him to prepare the original manuscript of his Kosmos (1845-1859), of which the last MS. volume, corrected by Humboldt, was in 1866 presented by Buschmann to the emperor Napoleon, who gave it to the imperial library in Paris. Buschmann was made professor at the University of Berlin in 1840, and director of the royal library in 1853. In 1851, he became a member of the Berlin Academy. Works In addition to Aper√ßu, he wrote: * Die Conjugation des franz√∂sischen Verbums (The conjugation of French verbs; 1831, 2nd ed. 1833) * √úber die aztekischen Ortsnamen (On Aztec place names; 1853) * Die Spuren der aztekischen Sprache im n√∂rdlichen Mexiko und h√∂hern amerikanischen Norden (Traces of the Aztec language in northern Mexico and upper North America; 1859) * Das Apache und der athapaskische Sprachstamm (3 vols., 1860‚Äì63) * Grammatik der sonorischen Sprachen (Grammar of the Sonoran dialects; 3 parts, 1864‚Äì69) * √úber den Naturlaut (1883) He edited the writings of Moses Mendelssohn (7 vols., 1843-1845) and the Fremdw√∂rterbuch of Christian August Heynes (Dictionary of foreign words; 9th ed. 1844).

Land for the cemetery was purchased in 1647 and has since belonged to the Singer family.Burchard gives the date of creation of the cemetery as 18th century In 1785, the cemetery was ceased to be private property and was sold to the Jewish community in Cieszyn. The last burial at the cemetery took place in 1928. In 1986, the cemetery was added to the register of monuments. The cemetery now belongs to the Jewish Community in Bielsko-Bia≈Ça.Data for the year 2009 As of 2009, the cemetery has more than 1,500 graves. The cemetery has an area of 1.9 hectares and is surrounded by a brick fence.Burchard specifies the number of preserved gravestones as about 500 It is claimed by local authors that the cemetery was established in the Middle Ages.  History   Private cemetery of the Singer family  The origins of the cemetery are associated with Jacob Singer, founder of the oldest Jewish house and who lived permanently in Cieszyn. In 1631, he signed a lease titled \\"Cieszyn toll\\" with Princess Elizabeth Lucretia. An account of instructions dated 23 April 1647 made him a princely tax collector with extensive privileges, such as the freedom to profess Judaism and acceptance of a device family cemetery for the deceased Singer.Janusz Spyra (ed.), op. cit p.8 The same year, Jacob Singer purchased area of so-called \\"Winogrady\\" from a townsman named Jan Kraus. Winogrady became the nucleus of today's cemetery. Singer was first buried there, but his grave did not survive to modern times. Following the edict of Charles VI in 1713, there was a tolerance of the influx of Jewish population into the town. As a result, the supply of cemetery plots decreased more rapidly than before. In 1715, in the absence of burial sites, the Singers bought a parcel of land and its house from Jan Faber, and in 1723, a portion of a field from Susan Berisch.Janusz Spyra (ed.), op. cit p. 30 The building obtained an embedded servant who looked after the cemetery. At the time of Maria Theresa, the cemetery was widely used by the Jews from Cieszyn and surrounding areas. In 1768, the Singers (Hirschel Singer and his sister, Endel, widow of Jacob Oppenheimie) again enlarged the cemetery through the purchase of an adjacent garden of a former folwark. They maintained a gravedigger during that period, and high charges were levied on burials, although annually 20 poor Jews were buried on their own account with the addition of garb.J. Spyra, Old Jewish cemetery in Cieszyn, p. 94th  Cemetery owned by the municipality  On 31 March 1785, Moses Hirschel Singer sold the property to 88 Jewish families in Cieszyn for 900 florins and the cemetery ceased being private. The cemetery was expanded; a plot was purchased from Paul P≈Çoszka in 1802, and a quarried section of land was purchased from the quarry in 1836, when the cemetery reached its final shape. Around 1820, a hospital for poor Jews was built at the cemetery, and in 1830, the cemetery was surrounded by a brick wall.Janusz Spyra (ed.), op. cit p. 31 In the second half of the 19th century, a funeral house, a flat for the guards and stables for horses and hearse were built and still exist today. The building was a gift from Emanuel A. Ziffer, an Australian railway specialist, and was dedicated to the memory of his parents, according to the board.Stary cmentarz ≈ºydowski (ul.

The volcano has continued to erupt in historic times. The islands currently belong to Yemen. Islands The largest island is Zubair, which is one of the younger islands. Other young islands are Center Peak, Saba, Haycock, and Saddle. Saddle Island has had eruptions in historic times. The volcano was built on a NNW-SSE rift line. It began with a period of explosive eruptions, then a period of quiescecence followed, during which time marine erosion took place. This was followed by a period of both explosive and effusive eruption activity, building up the Stark and Barren group of islands that exist today. This period of eruption has continued into historic times. Historic eruptions 1824 eruption A small (VEI 2) eruption took place in 1824 on Saddle Island, with low level explosive activity.

The Transit Expressway Revenue Line (TERL), commonly known as Skybus, was a proposed people mover rapid transit system developed by Westinghouse for the city of Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania during the 1960s‚Äì1970s. In contrast to the traditional streetcars then in use, the technology used a dedicated elevated concrete track and rubber-tired driverless cars. A demonstrator was built and operated in the South Hills area but political opposition killed the deployment of a larger system.  History  Westinghouse, a Pittsburgh firm, developed the technology during the early 1960s in cooperation with the Port Authority of Allegheny County, a public entity which by 1964 controlled most mass transit in the Pittsburgh area. With support from the state of Pennsylvania and the federal government, Westinghouse and PAT built a demonstration track at the Allegheny County Fairgrounds in South Park. The cars, which could operate separately or be coupled together, were powered by a pair of motors and could travel at a maximum speed of . Each of the four cars was long and could seat 28. Power was provided a 565 volt three-phase AC underrail system. During the 1960s the Port Authority formulated its so-called \\"Early Action Program,\\" the purpose of which was to establish a more robust rapid transit system in Pittsburgh. The program called for an Skybus line and two \\"busways\\" (bus rapid transit routes), plus rehabilitation of existing equipment. The Skybus route would originate South Hills Village and follow existing streetcar right-of-way through the Mt. Lebanon and Beechview neighborhoods before reaching Downtown Pittsburgh via the unused Wabash Tunnel. The entire project would cost $295 million; Skybus alone was $232 million.  The WABCO alternative  In July 1969 an alternative emerged to the Skybus plan. The Westinghouse Air Brake Company (WABCO) (an unrelated company founded by the same man, George Westinghouse, several years prior to Westinghouse Electric's founding) proposed a $114 million plan for a more conventional steel-wheeled light rail system. The system would originate in the South Hills area as the present streetcar system did and extend through downtown to the East Liberty neighborhood. Driverless operation would be an option, and the system would be fully grade-separated.  Adopting Skybus  WABCO's proposal notwithstanding, PAT voted to adopt the Skybus plan on July 10, 1969. PAT's decision provoked a storm of controversy, both for the decision itself and the manner in which it was taken. Throughout the decision- making process PAT held numerous closed-door meetings and was less than forthcoming about how it chose Skybus over the WABCO proposal. Republican (and pro-rail) County Commissioner William Hunt stated that \\"PAT officials should be aware ... that they are a public company using taxpayers' money and these taxpayers have a right to know how the money's being spent.\\" The Pittsburgh Press editorialized that PAT \\"pulled a monumental blunder the other night when it not only excluded the public from the meeting at which the WABCO proposal was made but actually tried to keep the details of the proposal from reaching the public.\\" Among the most vehement critics of Skybus was then-City Councilman Peter F. Flaherty (a Democrat), who was a candidate for Mayor of Pittsburgh. Flaherty accused PAT of prejudging in favor of Skybus and rushing the decision to secure federal funding for the project. Flaherty urged additional, open, hearings to better evaluate the merits of the Skybus and WABCO proposals. In response, the Allegheny County Commission agreed to hold a series of public hearings into the competing plans. Both Flaherty and John K. Tabor, his Republican opponent for mayor, appeared at the hearings to express their views. Flaherty accused the PAT board of directors of having an \\"emotional commitment ... to the Skybus plan\\" and of collusion with business- industrial interests in the Pittsburgh area who favored the plan. Tabor split the difference, presenting a plan which included WABCO and a Skybus loop east of downtown. A continuing source of contention was WABCO's cost estimate, which PAT's consulting engineer said was at least $100 million too low. The viability of the unproven Skybus technology, in particular the switching system, remained a concern. In September the County Commission voted 2‚Äì1 to adopt the plan. The Commission stated that of the $228 million only $20‚Äì30 million would be paid by the county, with federal and state funds making up the balance.  The end of Skybus  The Commission's decision did nothing to end the controversy. Flaherty, now mayor, remained opposed and used his powers as mayor to frustrate the project. In 1971 he and the Port Authority came to blows over the Wabash Tunnel, which Skybus would use to reach the downtown area. The Pittsburgh City Council voted to convey land at the mouth of the tunnel to the Port Authority. Flaherty vetoed the decision. The council voted to do so again, overriding Flaherty's veto. Flaherty then refused to sign the necessary papers. The matter reached the Commonwealth Court of Pennsylvania, which ruled against Flaherty in July 1972. PAT would spend a total of $9.2 million rebuilding the tunnel and then undoing the work after the system was canceled. In November 1971 the City Council had decided to table legislation funding Skybus. Construction stopped after Court of Common Pleas Judge Anne X. Alpern issued an injunction, ruling that PAT had failed to consider alternatives and that Westinghouse had \\"an illegal conflict of interest.\\" In January 1973 the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania quashed the injunction on both procedural and factual grounds, holding that the suit was not timely and that Westinghouse's role was not improper. Opposition to the Skybus project continued, with Flaherty and Hunt demanding that the proposal be submitted to a referendum in the 1973 election. The projected cost of the Early Action Program, including Skybus, had risen from $228 million to nearly $400 million. Governor Milton Shapp offered a compromise proposal, costed at $300 million, which placed Skybus on hold and included six commuter rail lines (including the future PATrain). A major issue remained the disposition of two sources of money: state and federal. U.S. Secretary of Transportation John Volpe had announced a $60 million grant in September 1971, and more money would be advanced as the Skybus project developed. Shapp, as governor, controlled a disbursement of $38 million in state money. Flaherty argued that the funds could be used for any transit project and were not tied to the Skybus project itself. The position of the Urban Mass Transit Administration (UMTA) became crucial: Skybus could not be built without federal support. The Port Authority, city, and state could not agree on an appropriate plan which would serve both the city of Pittsburgh and surrounding Allegheny County. The Port Authority remained committed to Skybus, as did a majority of the County Commission. Mayor Flaherty continued to favor a mix of traditional heavy and light rail, as did Governor Shapp. Ultimately in 1976 a cross-jurisdiction task force recommended light rail instead of Skybus, and the UMTA support was withdrawn. Once the Allegheny County Fair was done away with in the early 1970s, rides on the Skybus track ceased. In the Spring and Summer of 1980 the county had the track, cars and computer dismantled and bartered for scrap, with the computer building becoming a park police office. The Skybus tests proved that rubber tire driverless transit could function. Westinghouse Electric would later have a role in the development of the first major fully automated transit system in the country with Miami's Metromover. Westinghouse built the first 12 Adtranz C-100 buses used for the Metromover. Westinghouse would also participate in the development of similar driverless transit systems like the Bay Area Rapid Transit (BART) system in California, and automated people movers at several major U.S. airports, including Tampa, Orlando, and Dallas-Ft. Worth.

As a historic resource, the complex captures elements of two different phases of early 20th century settlement in the Fort Rock Basin. It represents the perseverance and resourcefulness required of modest-scale ranchers and farmers in frontier conditions and during economic hardship. Architecturally, the ranch preserves excellent examples of the construction styles and knowledge in use by common homesteaders in the period, as well as elements of the Finnish cultural heritage of the region. History The first influx of settlers began around 1909, driven by the 1909 Enlarged Homestead Act and the 1916 Stock-Raising Homestead Act, as well as Union Pacific Railroad promotion and publicity from the Lewis and Clark Centennial Exposition of 1905. Prominent among the settler population in this period were Finnish and Norwegian immigrant farmers including Fred Eskelin. However, many settlers were drawn by the unusually wet weather in years before 1909; when precipitation returned to its long-term, semiarid average, the large majority of settlers, including the Eskelin family, were unable to sustain agricultural operations in the dry conditions and abandoned their homesteads. The second phase of settlement came in the 1930s with new approaches to irrigation that enabled production in the near- desert conditions of the Fort Rock Basin. During this time, Fred and Ed Eskelin returned to the basin with their families and established a well drilling business alongside their agricultural operations. They built a new homestead, with both new construction as well as salvaging materials and whole buildings from disused properties around the area. The new homestead was laid out on a plan derived from traditional compounds in Finland; this Old World design provides a last link to the ethnic character of the first phase of settlement, which was all but extinguished except for the Eskelins. The success of this new venture led to Ed Eskelin's role as a prominent citizen in the basin, and to the long-term preservation of the homestead compound.. The complex was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1991..

It was built in 1901 from completely from locally quarried native stone by local pioneers, the Hope brothers. The compact two story building is vernacular architecture of the Richardson Romanesque style. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places on 5 March 1992. History Vale, Oregon was the first permanent settlement on the Oregon Trail in Malheur County. The early permanent structures in Vale, like the First Bank of Vale, were built of native sandstone at the turn of the 20th century. From 1906 on construction included the use of bricks. The erection of a stone hotel in 1872, now known as the Old Stone House is cited as the beginning of the development of the town. Vale became the permanent county seat of Malheur after three competitive elections and the county courthouse was built there in 1902. The First Bank of Vale was built and occupied in 1901 during the construction of the courthouse. It was the first financial institution in Vale to do business in a permanent building. The bank was built by Milton and Isiah Hope, brothers whose land claims were among the originals in the founding of Vale. The Hope brothers built a home and store of native stone in the 1890s. They were stone masons, merchants and businessmen who were active in the management of the bank and helped fund construction of the courthouse. It is likely one of the brothers was chief builder/architect for the First Bank of Vale building. The First Bank of Vale was incorporated on 17 June 1901 with capital. The bank prospered in the ensuing years, besting a competitor that had come to town, The First National Bank. The First Bank of Vale built a new building in 1908 known as Drexel Hotel which is also listed on the National Register of Historic Places. The original First Bank of Vale building was sold back to the Hope brothers with the opening of the new three story complex (taller than the competitor's 1907 two-story building). The First Bank of Vale building was remodeled inside with the change of ownership and utilization. It was used for office and retail space until the 1930s or 1940s at that time it was used for family apartments. The property changed hands numerous times after that, at one point Fred Burgess began a project to create a museum in the building. At that time it was known at the Burgess Building. After some time as a private residence the property fell into abandonment. At the time of listing on the National Register, the building was privately owned. The building retains much of its original character and material. Setting After the Old Stone House was built in 1872, it was expanded and frame buildings for a stable and blacksmith shop were built. The Hope Brothers Mercantile (Hope Brothers Building) was built in 1893. Together with the First Bank of Vale, this cluster all within one block and fronting on the Oregon Trail formed the downtown core of Vale. The property occupies the North of Lot 3, Block 24 of the Original Plat of Vale. It measures by . This is the entire urban tax lot occupied by the First Bank of Vale from 1901 onward. The street address is 148 Main Street South (zip code 97918). The building is on the east side of Main St. facing west. The First National Bank is the most intact clear example of vernacular architecture in the Richardson Romanesque style locally. It is one of a number of buildings that form a cluster unified by time period (1895‚Äì1907), building materials and Romanesque and Italianate architectural style. The banks character and presence outweigh its small footprint. Building View of the bank with other buildings in the Vale Historic District The two-story structure is built completely of native stone with no brickwork excepting the four chimneys. The construction is attributed to the Hope Brothers and the stonework and materials are of high quality, despite being built in less than three months. It is wide and long. The main volume of the building is made of random‚Äìrange dressed sandstone over rubble. The exterior walls are thick with lime and sand mortar. The front of the building is faced with rock‚Äìcut masonry and bold Romanesque trim elements. Parapet walls, stepped on the long sides, conceal a flat roof. The stone used for construction was quarried just south of Vale and was also shipped to other communities. Facade The facade wall runs straight up, having a coping course and a centered triangular crest with a ball finial. Openings, arranged symmetrically, are two large windows on the second floor with Roman arches and three-part arcade with the door at the south end alongside two store front windows all linked by Romanesque archivolts, textured voussoirs and rock-faced lobular pendants from the imposts. All windows have massive rock-faced lug sills. The windowed door has a transom with a round headed light. The first floor windows' transoms are topped with stained glass fan lights. The upper floor windows are double‚Äìhung sash windows with panes and have transoms with round-headed lights. A unique pinnacle with a pedestal and ball design crowns the facade. The effect is an imposing frontage with the stereotypical features of a bank and strong Romanesque presence. Other elevations A stairway has been removed and the upstairs doorway converted to a window (believed to have been done on the south side of the building. This elevation remains otherwise unchanged with a parapet wall of uncoursed rubble fill with granite lintels and dressed facings. The north side, of the same construction, blocked from sight by the adjacent building on the first floor, the upper floor has two windows. These steel framed by twenty‚Äìfour pane windows are probably not original. The ground floor of the rear elevation is concealed by a by cinder block addition from 1980. The original ground floor rear door now opens into this addition. A original freight door with a granite lintel that was in height has been filled (perhaps as part of a repair of the fractured lintel) and covered by the cinder block construction. The second story has an original door opening onto the roof of the addition, indicating a rear stairway was also built with the building. A window on the second floor of this elevation has been cemented closed. Base construction of this wall is also uncoursed random rubble with dressed facings. The north and south walls are stepped and extend to above the roof. The original roof is covered, current roofing material is asphalt roll roofing. Interior A substantial remodel of the interior was done . An interior stairway was created and it is likely that plumbing and electricity were installed at this time. Outhouses were removed from under the outdoor stairway and a bathroom was built inside under the new stairs. Sewer pipe was run from the second floor. An interior six pane opaque window was cut to provide light from the front room was fashioned in one wall. On the second floor a bathroom was built and a wall moved. It is thought the rear opening lintel was first repaired at this time. Other changes were made possibly in the 1930s or 1940s. Upstairs rooms were further divided, the windows were made in the north wall, the rear second-floor window was cemented as was the large rear opening. A room in the rear of the second floor was made into a kitchen with a formed concrete chimney. Crude remodels were done likely in the 1970s. Second-floor joists suffered fire damage and were double and re‚Äìenforced. Some of these changes obscured but did not remove original features. The attempt to create a museum in the building resulted in wire mesh on the windows and the cinder block addition. The original floor was covered in 1980 when concrete slab was poured for the museum project. Use a private residence in the following years brought on an attempted remodel that removed much of the previous changes but was not completed. At the time of listing on the National Register of Historic Places (NRHP) the interior had substantial debris and the roof was in need of repair. Despite the alterations and disrepair, the interior retains much of the original design and details. Preservation In 2018 the Malheur Country Historical Society negotiated to buy the First National Bank of Vale from Steven Reynolds. Reynolds owned the property at the time it was listed on the NRHP and prepared the nomination. The agreed price was . The society plans to restore the building and use it for their office. Bob Butler who donated the down payment guessed the restoration might cost as much as . the society was working to raise funds for an engineering report to guide restoration.

History  The Eastern Michigan University Marching Band performing at the 2018 Camellia Bowl The band was first formed in 1924 at Michigan State Normal College. In 1964, Thomas Tyra was appointed Director of Bands at the university and in 1968, Max Plank joined the EMU Bands program as Tyra's assistant. Together they forged a lifelong collaboration and friendship that would result in significant growth of the EMU Bands program and its traditions. Tyra arranged the \\"Eagles Fight Song\\" for marching band, composed the team cheer \\"Go Green,\\" and the \\"EMU Fanfare,\\" all pregame traditionals that are played today.  Organization   Director  Dr. J. Nick Smith serves as the current director of the Eastern Michigan Marching Band, who completed his Doctor of Musical Arts degree in Wind Band Conducting with emphasis in Choral Conducting at the University of Minnesota. Past Directors of the Eastern Michigan Marching Band: * Chandler L.

The graduate assistants lead large sectionals and conduct the band when needed. At times they assist the band staff in preparing for events such as Band Day, Picnic Day, etc.  Drum Majors  Eastern Michigan University Marching Band drum majors The Eastern Michigan Marching Band typically has 2-3 drum majors. The drum majors main responsibilities are teaching marching fundamentals at band camp, leading warm-ups and stretches, heading the leadership team, and conducting the band on the field and in the stands.  Leadership Team  The leadership team consists of the section leaders. Each section has at least one section leader who oversees the marching technique and musical aspect of their section. They often hold sectionals outside of rehearsals and make sure their section is prepared for all events.  Traditions   Pregame  Pregame EntranceAt approximately quarter till kickoff, the band pours out of the tunnel to drum cadences. At the conclusion of the cadence the band plays the \\"EMU Fanfare\\" while announcer, Professor Harry Bowen introduces the director, twirler(s) and drum major(s). The band then plays the \\"Eagles Fight Song\\", and other traditional pregame elements such as school cheers and the Star Spangled Banner. A notable pregame feature is the \\"Floating E\\" down the field.  \\"Eagles Fight Song\\"  The \\"Eagles Fight Song\\" melody was composed by Larry Livingston in 1939 and arranged for marching band by Thomas Tyra. The percussion parts were written by Whitney Prince. The fight song underwent minor lyric changes when the university transitioned from the Hurons to the Eagles in 1991.  \\"Our Pledge\\"  The Eastern Michigan University Alma Mater, \\"Our Pledge\\" was written by Edward Bowles in 1939 and arranged for marching band by Tyra. After each game and rehearsal, the band sings an SATB arrangement by Max Plank of the alma mater while linking arms.  Special Performances  Contingent upon the season schedule, the band will travel to away games and participate in other special performances. In recent years, The EMUMB has traveled with the football team to The University of Michigan, Michigan State University, Penn State University, and Ford Field in Detroit. The EMU Marching Band has also performed at venues such as the Pontiac Silverdome and Ralph Wilson Stadium near Buffalo, NY. In 2008, The EMUMB performed in America's Thanksgiving Day Parade in Detroit, MI.

It was established July 18, 1945 to study the effects of raising freshwater level on the environment. It was named after Charles Darwin. History In 1941, all preparatory work for construction of the Rybinsk Reservoir was completed, and the water level started to raise. The reservoir was full in 1947. Since further construction of big reservoirs was planned at the time, research on the effect of the creation of the reservoir on the environment was needed. To perform this research, the nature reserve was created on July 18, 1945. In 1952 P. A. Petrov, Director of Darvinsky Zapovednik, denounced staff at the nature reserve and implicated Aleksandr Malinovskii, the head of the Main Administration of Zapovednik. This led to an investigation in Darvinsky Zapovednik which vindicated Malinovskii and to the humiliation of Petrov. Since 1963, the nature reserve additionally performs the research on capercaillies to facilitate breeding of these birds. Location and geography The nature reserve occupies the northwestern part of the reservoir. Of the total area of , is occupied by land, and the rest is occupied by water. Approximately two thirds of the reserve are located in Vologda Oblast and one third is located in Yaroslavl Oblast. The major part of the area which belongs to Vologda Oblast is a peninsula in the Rybinsk Reservoir. Darwin Nature Reserve is located on Sheksna-Mologa Plain and is flat. Much of the area of the reserve is covered by coniferous forest (taiga) and swamps. In winter, swamps, rivers, and the Rybinsk reservoir stay frozen for several months. The addition of the reservoir to the landscape considerably altered the climate. In particular, the principal winds are flow currently from the northwest, as compared with southern and southwestern winds dominated previously. Among other the features related to human activity there are peat islands on the Rybinsk reservoir, which were formed as a consequence of the erosion of the bottom of the reservoir. Peat, which was deposited below the soil, floats and forms the islands. Another feature are the wells used to burn coal in the 18th century. A number of villages went under water when the reservoir was being filled, and some of the villages are still marked by islands with groups of trees. Fauna Large mammals resident in the nature reserve include brown bear, gray wolf, moose, and wild boar.

It was built in 1922 by James Sorenson and is an example of American Craftsman Bungalow architecture. The interior displays artistic heights of the American Arts and Crafts style. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places (NRHP) on March 9, 1995. Setting The City of Bothell is on the border of King and Snohomish counties in western Washington state. The Sammamish River crosses the south part of the city as it flows from Lake Sammamish on the southeast to Lake Washington to the northeast. Homes built on Bothell between 1905 and 1925 were suburban with post‚ÄìVictorian and Craftsman styles. The Sorenson House was built in 1922 on a parcel of land given to James Sorenson by his father in law Alfred Pearson. Pearson was a local logger and contemporary of the town's founder David Bothell. The property the house occupied when listed on the NRHP was the remaining . The house was moved about north to a single‚Äìfamily lot in 2015. The original site was atop a steep north facing slope. The facade faced west and approach in 1994 was from the east, a route which passed Pearson's own home. It is unclear if the original approach was from this direction and the house was just oriented toward the best views or if there was a westerly approach leading to the facade and entrance. James Sorenson James \\"Jim\\" Sorensen, a Danish immigrant, trained in shipbuilding as a carpenter before coming to America. In 1910 he married Mary Pearson and began a business partnership with William Schrotke in woodworking, cabinet making and contracting. He built many Craftsman style homes popular in architectural pattern books and enjoyed a good reputation. None of his other extant buildings display the degree of style and scale as his own home. In describing the home the NRHP nomination reads, \\"His talent and success at his trade are _most_ evident in his beautifully executed home.\\" and regarding the interior, \\"Mr. Sorenson, the builder, seeming used all his artistry in his own home to create a truly elegant setting.\\" Sorenson died of tuberculosis in 1938. Building The story home has an irregular floor plan. It is complex but sturdy and orderly. Well ornamented with features like triangular knee braces and decoratively shaped barge boards covering the rafter ends over wide open eaves on the gable ends. With its bold geometric lines and smooth curves there is no suggestion of gingerbread. A multiplanar roof breaks the mass into comfortable orderly elements tied together with scale and balance. The low pitched gables on the facade with two symmetrical gabled projecting bays maintain a modest scale while the cross gabled corner porch extending north and wrapping east gives the building substantial mass and presence. The battered brick piers rising to halfway between porch floor and ceiling from ground level supporting tapered square wood columns add to the weight of the house and pilasters at the height of porch rail of the same board reinforce the Craftsman styling.

He set his 100m personal best of 10.10 (with no wind) in August 2013 at the European athletics permit meeting in Hexham, UK. Early career After winning the 2014 World indoor sprint title, Kilty spoke to BBC News in mid-March about his family's dire financial conditions when he was young. Kilty broke the aged-12 UK record for 60m in 2001 and since then competed for Great Britain throughout the youth levels. \\"It's been a crazy journey. I actually won my first national title [in 2001] whilst living in a homeless hostel,\\" he said, sharing a one bedroom flat with his parents and 4 brothers and sisters. His father, Kevin Kilty, is Richard's strongest supporter and was himself a 10.8 sprinter in his youth before turning to bodybuilding and later becoming a bodyguard (according to an April 2012 interview with Athletics Weekly). In July 2006, Kilty won the English Schools (national) Championship in 100 meters in the Intermediate age group (under 17) with a time of 11.0, when the championship was held in Gateshead. He repeated as champion at the Senior level (age 17‚Äì18) in July 2007, winning in 10.73. [Note: Schoolboys are limited to a single event (plus a relay), because of the huge number of athletes who compete in the Championships each summer.] Kilty was then named as a captain of the GB team at the 2008 IAAF World Juniors in Bydgoszcz, where he made the semi-finals of his favoured 200 meters.

He opened with the fastest start and qualifying time of 20.65 in heats on 14 July, but in the finals that night he finished second (20.50) to James Ellington (20.45). But when athletes were named to Team GB for the outdoor World Championships held in Moscow in mid- August), 2nd-place finisher Kilty was left off the 200m in favour of Adam Gemili (who had competed at the European Under-23 Championships), winner Ellington and 3rd-place finisher Delano Williams. However, he was included as relay squad member and he ran the lead-off leg of the 4 X 100M in the heats at Moscow, where the team qualified with the second-fastest time (38.12 seconds) behind the United States.

While acknowledging the strong local support he had received in northeast England, Kilty said the move south to the Loughborough HiPAC was necessary because of the lack of elite-level sprinters with which to train in Teesside.Stockton Sprinter Richard Kilty in Best Form of His Career sports interview with local GazetteLive newspaper, 22 February 2014; accessed 19 March 2014.

Since the end of the 2013 outdoor season he has been coached by Rana Reider who is coaching a number of elite sprinters and jumpers, including Christian Taylor who won gold in the triple jump at the 2012 London Olympics and 2010 60 m World Indoor Champion Dwain Chambers. Long known for his exceptionally fast reaction time at the start of races (as automatically recorded by pressure pads embedded in starting blocks), Kilty routinely reacted to the starter's gun in less than 0.130 seconds, several hundredths of a second faster than his competitors. Under rules established by the IAAF to discourage sprinters from \\"anticipating\\" the gun, any racer who reacts faster than 0.10, is deemed to have \\"false started\\" and is disqualified. Kilty's win in the 60 meters at the 2014 World Indoor championships was all the more remarkable because of his lack of success in previous major competitions. Prior to his breakthrough at Sopot, during outdoor competitions he had failed to break the 10 and 20-second \\"barriers\\" in the 100 and 200 meters, respectively. Sub-10-second 100m and sub-20-second 200m times are viewed as the marks necessary to be ranked amongst the world's elite sprinters.

The U.S. Department of Commerce spent $2.1 million on hydroelectric infrastructure improvements to support the center and similar businesses in the city's Innovation District.Department of Commerce press release, August 24, 2011 Infrastructure During the construction of the MGHPCC, partner institutions constructed a link to a point of presence in Chicopee, connecting Holyoke's extensive city fiber network, seen here, to a regional fiber optic communications pathway Holyoke Gas and Electric partnered with the consortium to do the site selection and to contract for the provision of green power from their hydroelectric facilities. Between 2011-2013, Holyoke Gas and Electric constructed the new North Canal Substation located on Water Street which provides the electrical service for the computer center via two dedicated 34.5 kv feeders directly from the substation's 34.5 kv bus. The MGHPCC shares the 34.5 kv bus exclusively with the Hadley Falls Hydro Electric station, the largest of HG&E;'s hydro facilities, which creates a direct power path to the computing center from the Hadley Falls plant. Two 115kv/34.5 kv transformers at the substation connect the bus to the transmission system and provide electricity from the grid to the computing center when the hydro plant is offline or generating less power than the computing center is using. These transformers also function to deliver excess power to the grid when the Hadley Falls station is producing more output than what the computing center is using. Holyoke's municipal fiber optic network would also play a decisive role in the location of the computing center, and with its construction, a dedicated link 10gbps was built for the facility's educational affiliates on specialized networks such as the Internet2 consortium. Research The MGHPCC facilities have been used for a wide variety of applications including, but not limited to, advanced iterative methods for modeling molecular geometry, the behavior of stellar wind, ecological resilience of renewable energy systems, and neural circuitry. The facility also serves as a data processing center for a commercial and academic partnership hosted by Boston University known as Mass Open Cloud, a collaborative project to create a novel decentralized public cloud based on the Open Cloud eXchange model.

The main entrance is the west face on Auburn Avenue.Meisner, Jennifer, Auburn Post Office, National Register Inventory‚ÄîNomination Form, April 21, 2000, in digital files of National Park Service, Washington, D.C. Exterior The former Post Office is a small, single-purpose building. Constructed in 1937 as a one-story building, wide by long, with a covered loading platform in back. The exterior is red brick on a poured concrete foundation with sandstone trim elements. These include a horizontal band below the cornice, and engaged sandstone piers adjacent to the main entry. In the center of the front fa√ßade are five granite steps flanked by original wrought-iron ornamental lampposts. The wooden double entry doors have a transom windows above and large rectangular windows on either side. The remaining windows are gently arched wood windows with divided lights and poured concrete sills. Each features a soldier course of red brick at the headers. The roof is a lateral hip, with a metal cupola featuring glass panes and a weathervane. An east-facing skylight with operable windows runs along the base of the hipped roof. The original roof was tile. A raised, covered loading dock was constructed at the rear of the building. A cornerstone on the northwest corner of the front facade provides the names of the architect and the supervising engineer, the Postmaster General, and the Secretary of the Treasury that year. Interior The building has an L-shaped lobby, wide and on the front and on the back or south side. The postal clerk's counter and windows ran nearly the length of the lobby with the post box area located at the south end. A full wall with grilled postal clerk windows separated the public and private functions of the post office. Interior finish materials in the lobby area included Alaskan marble wainscoting, mahogany window and door trim, and terrazzo flooring. The building contained 11 rooms, including restrooms, work rooms and Postmaster's office, and a full basement with storage, fuel and boiler rooms.\\"Postoffice Plans Here; Building to Face Auburn Ave.,\\" The Auburn News, 18 June 1937. Present appearance Auburn Post Office with addition to the back The former Auburn Post Office building was purchased by the King County Department of Public Health and remodeled for use as a health clinic in 1964. The exterior alterations include construction of a long by deep brick addition to the rear covered loading dock; construction of an ADA accessible ramp along the north side leading to a basement entrance; installation of an arched fabric awning over the primary building entrance; and the addition of new building signage. The changes are not visible from the front. The roof has been changed from tile to asphalt shingles but the original cupola still crowns the building. The building interior was extensively remodeled in 1964. Spaces were sub-divided to create smaller offices and exam rooms, the lobby/reception area was reconfigured as the wall originally separating the post office lobby area from the back-of-the-house was removed and replaced with a reception counter, and the rear addition was added to create a nurse's work room. The buildings interior bears little resemblance to its historic use as a post office.

Above each is a small fixed window divided by muntins into eight triangular panes. History Women volunteers promoted and staffed the early libraries of Auburn. In 1912 the city was promised $9,000 by Andrew Carnegie for a library. It opened in 1914. The land was donated by Mr. and Mrs. Authur C. Ballard, who originally had plated Auburn as the \\"Town of Slaughter.\\" The donation contained a condition that the land would revert to the original owners when it ceased to be used for a library. The Carnegie building served the community for many years, but it ultimately proved too small to hold all the books and magazines it owned. In 1962 a $225,000 bond issue was approved by the voters and a new library opened in 1964. The proviso about the land being used for library purposes was then discovered and the property reverted to the Ballard family. It is a pure example of the typical Carnegie Library and is unaltered. The architect made a conscientious effort to incorporate all Carnegie's suggestions for library design, and all the elements of what Carnegie considered important are faithfully represented.

The bridge is a three-span cantilever with two anchor arms, two cantilever arms and a suspended section. It includes a combination of concrete and steel box girders. The bridge was designed by Homer M. Hadley, a consulting engineer from Washington State. The anchor arms and cantilever arms are multiple box, two-cell reinforced concrete box girders. The suspended section consists of two spread, welded steel box girders with reinforced concrete deck. The concrete deck is fixed to the top flange plate of the girders with steel shear developers. Utilization of this deck design allows the concrete deck and steel box girders to act in composite design; i.e., the bottom flange of the steel box resists tensile forces while the concrete deck resists compressive forces. The Patton Bridge's anchor arms are feet long, the cantilever arms are long, and the suspended span is . The bridge has a total length of .

The sword and stars can be found as public decorations throughout the city.  Heraldic elements   Escutcheon  shield on the flag of Haarlem The coat of arms of Haarlem consists of a red shield with a silver sword with golden handle under a white Jerusalem cross and flanked by 4 white six-pointed stars. Above the shield is the Imperial Crown of Austria under barren branches holding two Damiate bells, all held up by two golden lions standing on the motto of Haarlem. Several heraldic elements have their basis in the history of Haarlem. The motto of Haarlem is Vicit vim virtus (Latin for virtue conquered violence). The barren branches refer to the burned trees in the Haarlemmerhout, which were burned again and again during various sieges, most notably during the siege by the army of Jacqueline, Countess of Hainaut in 1428. Haarlem had taken side with the Cods in the Hook and Cod wars, and thus against Jacoba of Bavaria. The bells refer to the damiaatjes. Two bells were given to the city of Haarlem's St. Bavochurch to commemorate the heroic cutting of the harbour chain during the Siege of Damietta (1218) with a \\"saw ship\\", a legendary ship equipped with an iron saw fastened along the bow and front keel. This ship sawed through the harbour chain and allowed the fleet to attack the city, which was a success.  Wapenvermeerdering  Haarlem receives a sword for its shield from the German emperor in thanks for the victory in Damietta during the 5th crusade. Scene is now referred to as \\"the legend of the Haarlem shield\\". By Pieter de Grebber, 1630, Haarlem City Hall According to local legend, the original shield of Haarlem contained simply the four stars on a red background. As a result of the heroic deeds in Damietta, the Holy Roman Emperor granted Haarlem the usage of a sword and the Patriarch of Jerusalem granted the use of a cross. This story is known as the \\"Wapenvermeerdering\\", or \\"Addition to the Arms\\".Calvinism and the arts: a re- assessment, by Christopher Richard Job in Google BooksDeugd boven geweld, p. 100-101. In portrayals of this legend, the emperor is shown with a red beard, since he is supposed to be Emperor Barbarossa. As Haarlem historians love to point out, Emperor Barbarossa died in 1190 well before the siege of Damietta took place in 1218, so the story shown in the painting is just a Haarlem fantasy of greater knighthood and glory in the Crusades. During the Hook and Cod wars in the County of Holland in the 15th century, Maximilian I, Holy Roman Emperor supported the bourgeoisie in the cities (Cod) in their fight against the nobility in the countryside (Hook). During these wars Haarlem, like the other cities Dordrecht, Leiden, Amsterdam, and The Hague loaned large amounts of money to Maximilian I. The emperor granted Haarlem and the other cities the right to use his personal imperial crown in their coat of arms, out of gratitude for these loans. In the coat of arms of Haarlem, the Imperial Crown is positioned on top of the escutcheon.

The site contains two earthwork mounds located on top of a natural hilltop. Site description The Kenimer site is located on an erosional remnant hill just to the north of and overlooking the Nacoochee Valley. It overlooks the junction of the Chattahoochee River and Sautee Creek, which is about to the southeast. Mound A, the largest of the site's two mounds is above the level of the flood plain of the rivers and approximately above sea level. Georgia State Route 17 is positioned to the north of Mound A. Because the mounds are located on an irregularly shaped natural hill their exact dimensions are hard to determine and vary from side to side. The summit of Mound A is approximately square. On its high northeastern side it is over in height and on its western side adjacent to Mound B it is in height. Mound B is located to the west of Mound A and is oriented with both mounds' northwestern edges in a straight line. The summit is approximately square. The elevation varies on each side but is generally not much over in height. The fact that the site is located on top of and utilizes an existing natural hill as part of its bulk is unusual. The only other known example in southeastern US archaeology is the Emerald Mound located near Natchez, Mississippi. Excavations The site was mapped and test excavations performed in the summer of 1997 under the direction of Mark Williams as part of the Archaeology Field School of the Department of Anthropology for the University of Georgia. Little human habitation debris was found on the mounds, leading the archaeologists to conclude the site was used only for a short time and probably for ceremonial purposes as the surrounding topography would make it hard to have a village site adjacent to the mounds. Because of its unique features it is possible the site was constructed to resemble the platform mounds of the Macon Plateau area, such as Ocmulgee Site, located roughly to the south by peoples \\"that did not understand the construction history or social/religious context of such features\\". Some pottery and lithic debris was found at the site. All the ceramic pottery sherds found at the site dated to the Late Woodland period Napier Phase and dated to roughly 900 CE. The lithic debris found at the site was all locally available quartz and Ridge and Valley chert from the northwestern Georgia area. A small greenstone celt was found during a posthole test on the summit of Mound A. Controversy In December 2011, architect Richard Thornton writing for the content farm Examiner.com claimed that the mound was of Mayan origin. Mark Williams, an archaeologist at the University of Georgia who has spent three days surface collecting at the site, wrote, \\"The Maya connection to legitimate Georgia archaeology is a wild and unsubstantiated guess on the part of the Thornton fellow. No archaeologists will defend this flight of fancy\\" and via his Facebook page: \\"This is total and complete bunk,\\" and \\"There is no evidence of Maya in Georgia.\\" In 2010, archaeologist Johannes Loubser wrote in a peer-reviewed journal article that the excavations at the Track Rock Archaeological Site on the opposite side of the mountain from the Kenimer Site had been halted when graves had been discovered, and the site was probably precontact.

Curry House is a private house located at 631 East McLeod Avenue in Ironwood, Michigan. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1982 and designated a Michigan State Historic Site in 1977. Solomon S. Curry Solomon S. Curry, c. 1909 Solomon S. Curry was born on June 12, 1840 in Curry Hill, Lancaster Township, Ontario, the son of Solomon Curry and Anna Southerland Wood Curry. Curry's father died six months before he was born, and his mother soon remarried, to Alexander McLeod. Curry stayed with the family until he was sixteen, at which time he moved to Potsdam, New York and apprenticed to a blacksmith for three years. He then left to work as a supply clerk for a lumbering firm from Trenton, Ontario. Curry continued in the lumber business until 1861, when emigres from the United States, moving to Canada to avoid military service in the Civil War, flooded the labor market. Curry moved on to Michigan, first to Detroit, and then up to Houghton, where he got a position at the Quincy Mining Company. Curry moved from mine to mine in the Upper Peninsula, learning the trade, and was soon in charge of a small iron mine. In 1873, Curry moved to Ishpeming, Michigan, where he opened the Curry Mine. In 1880, he was one of the investors who opened the Metropolitan Iron and Land Company, and in 1885 he assumed the presidency of the company. Metropolitan had taken over the Norris Mine near Ironwood in 1882, and under Curry's direction the company began more extensive mining in the Gogebic Range. Curry himself moved to the Ironwood area in 1883, and was instrumental in establishing Ironwood as one of the larger cities in the area. Much of the town was laid out by Curry. Metropolitan earned a substantial profit for a number of years until the Panic of 1896, when Curry lost control of the company. Curry was also an active politician. He served in the state legislature in 1874 while living in Ishpeming. He was also a candidate for Lieutenant Governor in 1886, a delegate to 1892 Democratic National Convention from Michigan, and Democratic candidate for the Michigan Twelfth district Congressional seat in 1898. He also established both the First National Bank of Ironwood and the People's Bank of Ironwood, and was the first president of both institutions. In 1867, Curry married Elizabeth Stoup of Ann Arbor, Michigan. The couple had two children: George A. Curry and Mrs. Anna (Ralph) Bartlett. Elizabeth Curry died on April 21, 1914. Curry died on July 29, 1929, and is interred in Riverside Cemetery in Ironwood. House History Front view of Solomon S. Curry House Side view of Solomon S. Curry House In 1887, fire destroyed much of the town of Ironwood. After the fire, Curry purchased land and built this house for his own use. After Curry's death in 1929, the house was used as a hospital and a nursing home. The balcony on the second floor was enclosed in 1913 and a kitchen was added to the rear in 1952. The house was later turned into an antique shop and private residence. House description The Solomon S. Curry House is a 2-1/2-story vernacular Queen Anne structure, sided with clapboard and shiplap and sitting on a concrete foundation. The first floor has a long, L-shaped open porch; a matching porch on the second story is enclosed with double-hung, six-over-six windows. The roof is cross-gabled with central rectangular attic windows, flanked by two smaller windows, on the gable ends. Several other windows in the house have imported stained glass and Tiffany windows. The interior features 18 rooms, including a ballroom, and ornate woodwork.

It is most often caused by high-potency typical antipsychotics, but can also be caused by high doses of many atypicals, especially those closer in profile to typical ones (that have higher D2 dopamine receptor affinity and relatively low 5-HT2 serotonin receptor binding affinity), like paliperidone and amisulpride.  Symptoms  Neuroleptic induced deficit syndrome is principally characterized by the same symptoms that constitute the negative symptoms of schizophrenia: emotional blunting, apathy, hypobulia, anhedonia, indifference, difficulty or total inability in thinking, difficulty or total inability in concentrating, lack of initiative, attention deficits, and desocialization. This can easily lead to misdiagnosis and mistreatment. Instead of decreasing the antipsychotic, the doctor may increase their dose to try to \\"improve\\" what they perceive to be negative symptoms of schizophrenia, rather than antipsychotic side effects. The concept of neuroleptic induced deficit syndrome was initially presented for schizophrenia, and it has rarely been associated in other mental disorders. In recent years, atypical neuroleptics are being more often managed to patients with bipolar disorder, so some studies about neuroleptic-induced deficit syndrome in bipolar disorder patients now available. There are significant difficulties in the differential diagnosis of primary negative symptoms and neuroleptic deficiency syndrome (secondary negative symptoms), as well as depression.  Case  A Japanese man, who was being treated for schizophrenia, exhibited neuroleptics-induced deficit syndrome and obsessive‚Äìcompulsive symptoms. His symptoms were remarkably improved by quitting a course of antipsychotics followed by the introduction of the antidepressant fluvoxamine.

It is native to shallow seas surrounding certain island groups in the southern Indian Ocean. The body is protected by a hard test or shell which is covered with spines. The female broods its young in deep pockets on the upper surface, retaining the young in place with specialised spines. American zoologist Addison Emery Verrill first scientifically described A. cordatus in 1876.Kroh, A. (2010). Abatus cordatus (Verrill, 1876). In: Kroh, A. & Mooi, R. (2010) World Echinoidea Database. at the World Register of Marine Species Description The test of this species is oval and bilaterally symmetrical, up to long. The oral (under) surface is relatively flat but the aboral (upper) surface is domed, the colour being some shade of yellowish or greenish-brown. The test is thin and fragile, and is entirely covered with spines of various lengths in different parts. The anterior ambulacrum forms a shallow depression and the other four ambulacra form a star-shaped furrow across the surface of the test; this is shallow in males, but much deeper in females, forming pockets in which the young are incubated. The pockets are protected by specialized spines. On the oral surface the spines are short and used for locomotion, while the surrounding spines are used for digging. Distribution and habitat Abatus cordatus is endemic to certain subantarctic island groups in the southern Indian Ocean. It is known from the Kerguelen Islands, and the Heard Island and McDonald Islands. It occurs buried in soft muddy or sandy sediment, usually at depths down to about , but has been found at depths as great as . Ecology This sea urchin is a detritivore and feeds on organic matter in the sediment. It is gonochoric, individuals being either male or female. The eggs are large and yolky, and when they have emerged from the female's gonopore, they fall into the adjacent pockets; here they undergo direct development, being brooded for about nine months, with a few dozen young in each pocket. By this time they have developed into juveniles about in diameter with mouths and spines. They then crawl away from their mother. This is the first time that direct development has been observed among sea urchins. It is not clear precisely when the eggs are fertilised, but it has been discovered that the juveniles do not necessarily all share the same father. Because of the absence of a larval stage, most juveniles do not disperse more than a few metres from their parent. They have no known predators, and under favourable conditions can be very numerous, with up to 200 per square metre having been recorded. Their lack of ability to disperse may make them sensitive to alterations in their habitat such as changes in seawater temperatures.

The CDP is bordered to the west by the Capital Beltway (I-495/95) and to the south by Maryland Route 4. The CDP of Largo borders Westphalia to the north, Brock Hall is to the northeast, Marlboro Village is to the east, Queenland, Rosaryville and Melwood are to the south, Andrews Air Force Base is to the southwest, and Forestville is to the west. Planning issues On February 6, 2007, the Prince George's County Council approved the Westphalia Sector Plan and Sectional Map Amendment. This document established a planning concept for the Westphalia area and rezoned specified properties. This concept is envisions a \\"high-density, transit- and pedestrian-oriented urban town center\\" surrounded by three village centers and multiple residential modules. Buildout is proposed to include 14,000 - 15,300 new residential units, 4.5 million square feet of commercial space, and 750,000 square feet of retail space. A 150-acre Central Park is proposed immediately north of the Town Center, approximately at the center of the Westphalia area.

The school opened on August 23, 2010 and had a cost of $25 million. The architect was Grimm + Parker Architects, and it was built for 792 students. The school's cooling system relies on over 144 geothermal pumps. The initial enrollment was 798, slightly higher than the school's stated capacity. Its opening relieved Arrowhead, Marlton, Melwood, Patuxent and Perrywood, elementary schools. The first principal was Pearl Harmon, a Liberian American; in 2014 she was reassigned to an administrative position in the PG County school system. ** Several school board members argued that naming a school after Obama would inspire area students. Many schools in PG County were named after African-Americans, and PG County voters primarily support the Democratic Party, Obama's political party. In the 2008 U.S. Presidential Election, 89% of PG County residents voted for Obama. The chairperson of the PG County Republican Party Central Committee, Mykel Harris, argued that the county should not name a school after a current president, while the chairperson of the board, Ron L.

Chropie≈Ñski) was a Polish theatre director, literary critic, publicist, editor and book collector; president of the Polish PEN Club (1925‚Äì27); and from 1938, an elected member of the prestigious Polish Academy of Literature. In 1919, in celebration of Poland's return to independence (1918) after over a century of partitions, Lorentowicz published the most complete collected works of the poet Jan Kochanowski (1530‚Äì1584), who had laid the foundations for Polish literary language. Life Lorentowicz was born in Pabianice, in present-day central Poland, in 1868, five years after the opening of the Polish 1863 Uprising that was eventually suppressed by the Russian Imperial Army. His parents had moved to present-day central Poland from the old eastern Kresy borderlands, escaping poverty and oppression. Jan obtained his secondary- school diploma at P≈Çock by way of home schooling and soon went to France, where he lived until 1903 and studied at the Sorbonne. While in Paris, he became editor-in-chief of Pobudka (Awake!) in 1891, and on 17 November 1892 took part in an assembly leading to the founding of the Polish Socialist Party (Polska Partia Socjalistyczna, or PPS). A major controversy surrounded the Paris conference, regarding the potential use of terror by the PPS. Supporters of such violence against the Russian governorate included Aleksander Dƒôbski, but the idea did not take hold and no terror attack took place in the following decade. In 1903 Lorentowicz returned to Poland and settled in Warsaw. He joined the editorial board of Kurier Codzienny as managing editor about the time of the Polish Revolution of 1905, and in 1906‚Äì18 served as literary editor of Nowa Gazeta (the New Gazette). He co-founded the Polish Society of Writers and Journalists in 1909 and served as its president, 1916‚Äì18. Poland's freedom was in the air. In 1916‚Äì22 Lorentowicz was director of the Warsaw School of Drama and, in 1918‚Äì22, executive director of the Warsaw City Theatres. In 1919 he published a three-volume collected works of the 16th-century poet Jan Kochanowski, who had founded Polish literary language; in 1925 the book on W≈Çadys≈Çaw Reymont, commemorating Reymont's Nobel Prize in Literature; and the same year became president of the Polish PEN Club after the death of Stefan ≈ªeromski. In 1926‚Äì28 Lorentowicz served as director of Warsaw's National Theatre, and in 1935 he completed the publication of his monumental five-volume monograph, Dwadzie≈õcia lat teatru (Twenty Years of Theatre), comprising some 480 collected articles. In 1938 he was elected a member of the Polish Academy of Literature after the untimely death of Piotr Choynowski and Boles≈Çaw Le≈õmian. He continued publishing until the Nazi German invasion of Poland, and died in Warsaw in mid-January 1940. Lorentowicz was buried in the city's PowƒÖzki Cemetery. Legacy Jan Lorentowicz received many awards for his contributions to theatre and its history, including the French Legion of Honour and the Polish Order of Polonia Restituta. He was well known for his vast collection of books, some rare and expensive. He was a Renaissance man with broad interests and accomplishments. Immediately after World War I he participated in rebuilding theatre in Poland's capital. His Dwadzie≈õcia lat teatru is a primary source of information on the history of Warsaw theatre in 1904‚Äì34. To this day, Poland's interwar actors and cultural luminaries are best remembered through his monographs, including Spojrzenie wstecz (Looking Back), Dzieje teatru w Polsce (History of Theater in Poland), and Teatr Polski w Warszawie (Polish Theater in Warsaw). In 1989 the Pabianice public library was named for him. The memoirs of Lorentowicz's daughter ‚Äì writer, teacher and award-winning set-designer Irena Lorentowicz ‚Äì Oczarowania (Enchantments) show Jan Lorentowicz as a remarkable father. See also: Google translate. Irena, who never married, inherited part of his library. In old age demented and alone, she was found by a friend in the middle of her small Warsaw apartment, cutting up books with scissors into a pile of scraps. She died in 1985 and was buried near her father. See also: Google translate.

He is widely recognized for his roles as: professor at the Royal College of Art and the Architectural Association School of Architecture, professor and director at Harvard University Graduate School of Design, as well as professor, chair and dean at the University of Toronto Faculty of Architecture, Landscape and Design. Baird's contributions to the disciplines of architecture and urban design extend from his professional practice, Baird Sampson Neuert Architects, to his theoretical publications on the subject of urban public space. His influential work and passion for architectural academia earned him the 2012 AIA/ACSA Topaz Medallion for Excellence in Architectural Education. Education Baird was born in Toronto, and received his Bachelor of Architecture (B.Arch.) degree from the University of Toronto School of Architecture in 1962. He carried out postgraduate research at University College, London. While he was at University College, Baird co-edited the book Meaning in Architecture with Charles Jencks. Career Baird returned to Canada by 1967 and joined the faculty of the School of Architecture at the University of Toronto, remaining until 1993. He also emerged as a leading spokesman for improved urban design in Toronto. Baird founded his architectural and urban design practice, George Baird Architect and Associates, in 1972. In 1982 the office became Baird/Sampson Architects, and since 1998 has been Baird Sampson Neuert Architects Inc. Projects include Cloud Gardens Park in Toronto, Thomas L. Wells Public School in Toronto (the first LEED certified public school in Canada), the Old Post Office Plaza in St. Louis, and the Mission 2050 Research Centre at the University of Guelph in Ontario. Baird Sampson Neuert received the RAIC Architectural Firm Award in 2007. In 1993 Baird joined the faculty of the Harvard University Graduate School of Design, where he taught design studio and architectural theory and served as director of master's degree programs. In 2004, he returned to the University of Toronto to become dean of the John H. Daniels Faculty of Architecture, Landscape, and Design, a position he held until 2009.  Architectural theory   Public Space in Contemporary Architecture and Urbanism  The relationship between public space and the growth of privatized space in architectural industry discussions. Recognized for his academic and professional contributions to the discipline of architecture, George Baird‚Äôs theoretical works and critical studies reveal a multi-faceted collection of publications and discourses on the topic of urban public space. In relationship to architectural design, urban design, and design history and theory, his trajectory of research specifically focuses on the status and relevance of public space in modern cities and how political and cultural agents utilize, identify, and represent such urban areas. Baird‚Äôs publications titled, The Space of Appearance, Writings on Architecture and the City, and Public Space: Cultural/Political Theory; Street Photography, each present a parallel discourse that discusses the two core questions: ‚ÄúCan space be described as public or not?‚Äù and ‚ÄúWhat is architecture‚Äôs place in the world?‚Äù. In a 2005 lecture at the Berlage Institute in Rotterdam, Baird claims that the true concept of the ‚Äúpublic‚Äù has shifted and the postmodern architecture movement is a consequential factor for its disappearance. Influenced by political theories that stem from more recent generations of philosophers, Baird builds his main argument for publicness from the foundational thinking of Hannah Arendt‚Äôs Theory of Action, and J√ºrgen Habermas' perspectives on the Public Sphere. His criticisms argue that public space has eroded from the heart of contemporary industry discussions and has therefore evolved architectural expressions that are much more politically engaged. Since his return to Toronto from England in 1967, Baird‚Äôs involvement in practice allowed him to witness first-hand the extent of private properties in the city and the increase of control over urban land. He discusses that if public space is not controlled by ‚Äúthe municipality, then at least by collective entities of various kinds; cooperatives, nonprofit organizations, etc.‚Äù For Baird, the new era of architecture and urban design, that centres on political engagement rather than the public sphere, is ‚Äúthe problem of city building‚Äù. Through architectural theory and conversation, his interest predominantly focuses on reigniting the importance of shared public space as a central design strategy for the agendas of today‚Äôs architects and urbanists.  Human Phenomenology of the City  Baird believes that architecture is highly capable of manipulating affects on human experience at a subconscious level. ‚ÄúArchitecture‚Äôs power comes not from the iconographical charge it can carry, but instead from the fact that it structures our consciousness and our way of being in the world in ways which we ourselves are not fully conscious of‚Äù. Urban street photography by Berenice Abbott in 1936 showcasing bodily proximity in shared public space. One of Baird‚Äôs most significant considerations, regarding human behavior, is that Benjamin‚Äôs concept of distraction introduces a ‚Äúthreshold of consciousness‚Äù in respect to the public‚Äôs experience of buildings. Associating Arendt‚Äôs political theories of human action together with Benjamin‚Äôs cultural theories of distraction, Baird came to realize that the experience of individuals in physical space began to articulate a spectrum of consciousness that would move from one realm to the other. In doing so, he began to compose his praxis on human behavior that establishes the idea of publicness in phenomenological terms. In his book, ‚ÄúPublic Space: Cultural/Political Theory; Street Photography‚Äù, Baird begins to examine and demonstrate this field of public thought through the visual medium of street and newspaper photography. His book captures a social and cultural collection of 20th century photographic works by Berenice Abbott, Walker Evans, Bill Brandt, Henri Cartier-Bresson, and others. In order to support his discussion on the topic of human consciousness and architecture, Baird‚Äôs curation of photographers and photographs have been specifically selected to show the active engagement of people in physical settings who are unaware that they are being photographed. His reasoning behind such particular visuals presented in his project is because ‚Äúthese striking images, none the less, bear powerful witness to the scope of the contemporary photographic image and to its capacity of both to portray and to shape the contemporary political forms of publicness, generally, and of public space, specifically‚Äù. Baird goes on to deeply analyse the various conditions of conscious states including focused observation, mutual awareness, intentional performability, and the assembly of the parade. Baird‚Äôs reflections regarding the interrelationships of bodies in space, shown through street and news photography, helps to facilitate his three architectural conditions of publicness which he refers to as ‚Äúvisibility, propinquity, and continuity‚Äù. In relationship to architecture and urban design, each of these conditions work within the physical and psychological networks of bodily proximity and become present to those who exist within shared public space. Baird insists that the way we work on, interpret, and project the city relies heavily on the phenomenological aspects of architecture. He emphasizes that experiential journeys of bodies through physical spaces are crucial in understanding the cityscape; however, postmodern city centres have grown too large and complex to fully understand its entirety in this way. Similarly, to his syntheses presented through street photography, the city must therefore be understood through the approximations, representations, and other intermediate means of publicness.

Flower and Hawk was Floyd's seventh opera. It had its premiere on May 16, 1972, with Phyllis Curtin and the Jacksonville Symphony Orchestra under the baton of Willis Page. The production was directed by Frank Corsaro. Synopsis Flower and Hawk is based on the life of Eleanor of Aquitaine, arguably the greatest woman of the Middle Ages. In her long life of eighty-two years she was born the Duchess of Aquitaine and Countess of Poitou, became Queen of France through marriage to Louis VII, and later became Queen of England when she married Henry II. The title is derived from her seal (on view in the Louvre) in which she stands holding a hawk in one hand and a flower in the other, suggesting a dualism in her character that is invoked in this work. The monodrama takes place in Salisbury Tower, where Eleanor has been a prisoner for nearly sixteen years: Henry II had her confined there after she and her sons led an unsuccessful rebellion against him in France. Overcome by feelings of despair, abandonment and betrayal, she considers taking her life with poison but instead resolves to distract herself by recalling happier times. As she relives her positive memories of becoming the Queen of France, the memory of her son Richard's death resurfaces. She also recalls the many conflicts she endured with her two husbands, and again finds herself sinking into hopelessness. Time and again her feelings about Richard's death force her into the present until she finally allows herself release from the guilt and self-doubt surrounding this tragic event. Finally, she is able to re-assume her role as Queen when the tolling of the bells announces the death of Henry and her liberation from the Salisbury Tower.Carlisle Floyd ‚Äì Flower and Hawk ‚Äì Operas at Boosey & Hawkes  References  Operas Operas by Carlisle Floyd Monodrama 1972 operas English-language operas One-act operas ","title":"Flower and Hawk"},{"id":"34167443","text":"Dimitri Lesueur (born 25 January 1987) is a French footballer who plays as a forward.

Although the term \\"neurological reparative therapy\\" is new, the foundation of this model is not. NRT is not a proscriptive model, in that it does not outline how the therapy is to be conducted. A preponderance of evidence shows that the most important component of successful treatment is not the approach or techniques, but the professional caring and competence of the therapist engaging with the client in a supportive, cathartic, and healing manner. The NRT roadmap provides the best route to healthy brain development, attachment, and resiliency, but relies on the helper to use his or her own skills, experience, and techniques to take the journey. Principles Neurological reparative therapy is not a program or a technique, but is better explained as a roadmap describing the journey of healing and repair of the mental processes preventing the individual from achieving personal goals and personal contentment. NRT outlines the goal and ultimate destination of treatment, and provides a roadmap with the mileposts along the way. NRT does not proscribe the methods, the techniques, or the approaches that are the vehicle for the client and therapist to travel the road together. NRT is specifically designed to optimize the skills and abilities of the therapist by taking advantage of the therapist's knowledge, training, and experience in joining with the clients on the healing journey. The model outlines what needs to be addressed in treatment ‚Äì the therapy components critical to internal change ‚Äì and points out that \\"knowing where you are going\\" is the key to arriving successfully at the destination.  History  Although the term neurological reparative therapy is relatively new, the history of the model goes back many decades. NRT has its foundation in the integrated treatment of extreme mental, emotional, and behavioral disturbances in very young children. The term was first used in the writings of a psychologist, D.L. Ziegler, working with children who had experienced severe trauma and abuse.Ziegler, D.L. (2011). Neurological Reparative Therapy, a roadmap to healing, resiliency and well- being. Jasper, OR: Jasper Mountain. Ziegler found that integrating brain research, attachment theory, and resiliency work within trauma treatment resulted in an unexpected outcome ‚Äì significant functional improvement following the cessation of treatment. This led him to the conclusion that the change was internal (i.e. neurological) in nature, and was not conditional upon a place, an individual, or the environmental circumstances. After studying years of practice-based evidence, it was found that the treatment orientation or approach of the therapist was not the determining factor in positive outcomes, but rather the integration of components of positive brain change (attachment, resiliency, and trauma treatment within the framework of how the brain functions) that frequently resulted in change \\"from the inside out\\".  Integrated components  The four pillars of neurological reparative therapy are Brain Development, Attachment, Resiliency, and Trauma Treatment. The integration of all these components provides the synergy that leads to optimal positive brain change, which provides lasting change. Of these pillars, the research and literature on attachment is the oldest of the four, going back nearly a half-century. The ability of an individual to successfully bond and attach to others has been growing in importance as new information is learned about how the human body ‚Äì and specifically how the brain ‚Äì modulates and copes with stress. There is now a new resurgence in focusing on attachment in the treatment process of individuals, couples, and families. Resiliency research is showing it is not the negative experiences everyone encounters in life that is key, but rather the ability of the individual to cope with and bounce back from adverse situations. Resiliency is growing in importance not only in mental health settings but also in educational, occupational, and medical areas. The pillar that has seen the most influx over the last two decades has been brain development. The explosion of new information has been facilitated by sophisticated brain scanning technology, to determine in real time how the brain is processing and responding to interventions. At this point, our knowledge of the brain and how it works is doubling every ten years. NRT works to integrate new information on the brain into the healing process. While the field of trauma treatment is as old as is attachment, it takes significant advantage of the new research on brain development to better target the brain with positive change. For damaged individuals, trauma treatment is the container, while attachment, resiliency, and brain development are the included ingredients of the NRT process.  Is NRT an evidence-based practice?  On the continuum of evidence-based practices and practice-based evidence, the neurological reparative therapy model is in the middle. Causal research has limitations when it comes to isolating variables in an intervention with integrated components. NRT allows for the use of any and all evidence-based practices as the vehicle of treatment, since it does not restrict or specify any therapeutic approach or method. NRT places the responsibility for how the therapeutic process is conducted on the therapist. Evidence-based practices should be a major consideration of all treatment.  Research  Because neurological reparative therapy is an integration of an amalgam of components and a wide range of methods, the limitations of causal research make it difficult to determine if one ingredient of the process is more significant than any others. NRT primarily relies on the research and literature of the four pillars that form the conceptual foundation of the Model. There is significant literature and research concerning how the human brain functions.Hariri A.R. & Holmes A. (2006).

The concept of resiliency is built upon a number of skills and attitudes, and has been expanded by the recent interest in psychology with respect to finding out what is right with individuals rather than what is wrong with them. The foundation of resiliency is built upon believing in yourself, having personal confidence, being able to connect in a positive way with others, and allowing others to support you. The area of resiliency has strong research support.Brown, S. L., Nesse, R., Vinokur, A. D., & Smith, D. M. (2003).

They were the first general election in which a third party (the Democratic National Alliance) offered a full slate of candidates alongside the two major parties, the Free National Movement and the Progressive Liberal Party (PLP).The Bahamas General Election Results - 7 May 2012 Caribbean Elections The result was a victory for the opposition PLP, whose leader Perry Christie became prime minister. Background The Free National Movement had defeated the Progressive Liberal Party in the 2007 general election amid a scandal involving the residency status of model and reality television star Anna Nicole Smith and allegations that the PLP's then-immigration minister had fast-tracked her application to live in the islands. Opinion polls An opinion poll was carried out by Public Domain, a market research and public opinion polling company, between 2 and 12 March 2012 that involved 501 respondents. A sample of this proportion only represented a maximum margin of error of 4.4 per cent. The poll showed that the Free National Movement's (FNM) core support was the highest at 30.5 per cent, followed by the Progressive Liberal Party (PLP) at 23.7 per cent, and the Democratic National Alliance (DNA) at 16.5 per cent. A total of 12.2 per cent of the sample were undecided voters. Also the poll revealed that the PLP's swing voters constituted 6.6 per cent of the sample; the largest swing voter percentage. They were followed by the DNA ( who had 5.2 per cent swing voters ) and the FNM ( who had 3.7 per cent swing voters ). Therefore, the total support for the FNM was around 34.2 per cent, which was followed by the PLP's 30.3 per cent and the DNA's 21.7 per cent. If any of the two leading parties were to win the support of the entire 12.2 per cent undecided voters, they would win the general election. A question was asked during the polling process that went, According to you, which party will win the next election?. The results were that the FNM would ( at 32% ), the PLP would ( at 32% ) and the DNA would ( at 8% ) win the next general election. The poll also reported that 52% of the electorate was against reelecting the incumbent Free National Movement, while 55.9% opposed electing the PLP and 64.5% rejected electing the DNA.Dames, Candia. \\"FNM and PLP in Statistical dead heat.\\"The Guardian Business. 29 March 2012.n. pag.Web. 15 April 2012 Results The opposition Progressive Liberal Party (PLP) won a majority in a landslide election victory, taking 30 of the 38 seats in parliament.

The election also followed controversy over incomplete electoral rolls and the 2011‚Äì2012 Papua New Guinean constitutional crisis between the disputed prime ministers of Sir Michael Somare and Peter O'Neill. Background In 2011 a dispute arose between Sir Michael Somare and Peter O'Neill over who was the legitimate prime minister. Somare was backed by the Supreme Court, while O'Neill gained the support of a majority of the parliament, the Army and the civil service. O'Neill was internationally recognised as holding the office of prime minister. Both claimants also appointed their own police chiefs and heads of the military. Amidst continuing conflicts, a mutiny occurred in 2012 against factions of the military. There were also accusations of Australian partisanship over Prime Minister Julia Gillard's support for the O'Neill government. Date There was a suggestion by the parliament to postpone the election for up to a year in the light of an unprepared process in regards to the implementation of a biometric voting system and an only 60% complete voter roll. Deputy Prime Minister Belden Namah was a proponent of this idea saying the election commission and the census had failed in the count of the population. However, this was decided against by O'Neill who said the United Nations and Australia would step up to support the process. However, he later retracted the comment. On 5 April the parliament voted to postpone the election for six months by a vote of 63 to 11, with O'Neill and Namah voting for the postponement. The Parliamentary motion instructed head of the election commission, Andrew Trawen, to ask the Governor-General of Papua New Guinea Sir Michael Ogio for the delay. However, as Trawen has previously asserted that parliament has no power to postpone the election since its five-year term is specified in the constitution of Papua New Guinea and he had previously said that \\"the nation is ready to go to the polls,\\" he was \\"consulting his lawyers\\" as to which direction to proceed. A former attorney-general, Sir Arnold Amet, said the vote was unconstitutional and would be challenged in court. Leader of the Opposition Carol Kidu said she was \\"vehemently opposed\\" to the suspension. \\"How can we take anything they say at their word? The whole country is being held to ransom by these decisions.\\" However, after intense domestic and international pressure, O'Neill backed away from this demand and the election was held from 23 June to about 13 July which was in the scheduled timeslot. Electoral system The National parliament is elected from 111 single-member electorates. 89 of them are open electorates distributed around the country. Additionally, each of the 22 provinces elects 1 regional member, which also takes the title of provincial governor. The candidates are elected using Limited preferential voting, where the voter ranks 3 candidates in the order of preference. Parties and campaign Since the office of the prime minister was disputed, Somare's National Alliance Party has splintered into several factions following the constitutional crisis. O'Neill, who originally had no party base, formed an alliance in March with Belden Namah, former Prime Ministers Sir Mekere Morauta and Bill Skate to contest the election. Following the disintegration of Somare's party, Dame Carol Kidu assumed the title of Leader of the Opposition despite having no parliamentary following. Kidu is the parliament's only female member and was born in Australia. As a result of capital inflows in the natural resources sector, there was an increase in campaign finance during the electoral process. The Sydney Morning Herald (SMH) cited payments to tribal, clan and village extended family heads in order to get \\"block votes\\", particularly in the seven highland provinces where 45 of 111 MPs are chosen. This was in contrast to the previous Moka system that involved high-profile individuals who gained both prestige and power in exchange for gifts sich as pigs, shells and yams to each other in order to entangle others in a web of unrepayable debt, according to the SMH. It also noted an event in the Dei Open electorate two days prior to its voting date that consisted of several pigs for slaughter. Local MP Puri Ruing, who presided over the ceremony, said that \\"this is not election-related. It's a tribal peace settlement over ownership of a coffee plantation.\\" Constitutional crisis developments Following a Supreme Court's ruling, Deputy Prime Minister Francis Marus said that Somare was the legitimate prime minister, but since he had missed three sitting of parliament the office was now vacant and a new prime minister would be elected on 30 May. Chief Justice Sir Salamo Injia, one of the three judges who ruled that Somare was the legitimate prime minister was arrested in May and later charged with sedition. Justice Nicholas Kirriwom, who joined Injia's decision was also arrested on 28 May and \\"will be charged with sedition\\", according to a police spokesman. A splinter group of police officers blockaded parliament on 26 May to prevent the holding of a special sitting of parliament, at which MPs voted for a state of emergency and rejected the Supreme Court‚Äôs ruling that Somare should be reinstated. The police leadership then called for an end to the political stalemate, while Michael Ogio refused to sign the document approving the sitting which called for a state of emergency, or any documents, until a government is formed after the election. Observers Three sets of observation teams monitored the election: * Domestic Observation: 22 teams (joint project between the PNG National Research Institute and the Australian National University) * Commonwealth Observers * Transparency International Controversies The electoral process delayed the release of a report into the sinking of the MV Rabaul Queen. A Commission of Inquiry had been set up and led by Warwick Andrew, who submitted the final report to caretaker Prime Minister Peter O'Neill. O'Neill said that the 200-page report would first need to be tabled in parliament before its release and would thus have to wait for the new parliament to sit.  Cannibalism  In the remote jungle area of Tangu and Biamb villages, near Madang, cult killings disrupted the voting process after at least seven people - five men and two women - were killed over the past three months as they practiced sanguma. The killed persons became victims of cannibalism. On July 4 the police arrested twenty-nine people who allegedly ate their victims. Election The National Alliance Party of former Prime Minister Michael Somare lost more than 20 seats in the election. Conversely, the People's National Congress Party gained more than 20 seats. Additionally, the Truth Heritage Empowerment Party, which was not represented in the previous parliament, gained 12 seats. Somare, who won the East Sepik Provincial seat for the National Alliance Party, said that \\"everywhere people have said, 'Ours is a sorry vote. We want to show, the people of PNG, a Sepik who represented us and represented the whole country should be not treated in that way.'\\" It followed his comments that he was set to retire but he changed his mind as \\"just at a tick of the Speaker's pen, he says I'm out, and I'm out of parliament. My idea is to get National Alliance and its coalition partners back into government, then say goodbye to them, stay as a backbencher and stay in my province,\\" after saying that he would spurn any coalition overtures because \\"they stabbed me in the back after keeping them for 9¬Ω years, making them ministers, very important portfolio.\\" On 6 July, when the electoral process was supposed to conclude, it was announced that the election could continue for about a week longer. By the beginning of the third week, voting was complete in most of the country except for some inland villages and outlying islands. Governor-General Michael Ogio is expected to call on the leader of the largest party to form a government. Prime Minister Peter O'Neill was announced as the winner of his contest in the Ialiba-Panga electorate in the Southern Highlands Province with 44,917 (75%)of the vote.http://results.pngec.gov.pg/ialibupangiaopen.html He then said: \\"In a very turbulent 10-month period the PNC has led the government and provided stability, laying the foundation for economic growth and rebuilding our infrastructure, by introducing free education, free health care and unveiling an infrastructure development program. People obviously want these policies and programs to continue and are turning up in droves to support PNC candidates;\\" while adding that he would form the next government. Conduct Amidst the election days, Deputy Prime Minister Belden Namah said that PM Peter O'Neill should be \\"ashamed\\" for allowing the election to take place as scheduled because of the problems with the voter rolls in urban areas and blaming Australia for contributing to the claimed pandemonium in saying: \\"Cries have been received from all parts of PNG echoing and demonstrating that our country was and is not ready to proceed with elections this last week. What a disaster. Peter O'Neill should be ashamed for listening to the PNG Electoral Commissioner and its Australian advisers.\\" Though he said there were over 200 Australian advisers working for the election commission, The Australian claimed there were \\"just 22 Australian logistical advisers\\". On 28 June, O'Neill appealed to the Electoral Commissioner Andrew Trawen to release supplementary common rolls after many people had reported not being on the electoral rolls at voting centres. He also said of Namah that \\"I'm fed up with this political opportunism. It is not the job of politicians to run elections. That is the job of the election commissioner.\\" Paul Barker, the executive director of the Institute of National Affairs, said that it was common to see errors in the electoral rolls and that \\"it was wide scale in the 2007 poll, but it seems worse now. The current roll hasn't been updated. The roll has names where people lived 20 years ago.\\" He also said that Trawen was not entirely to blame as \\"the electoral commission only gets a trickle of money in the early years, then big cash just before the election. In that time, they cannot be doing what they're supposed to be doing.\\" Other problems during the election process included security measures and consequent delays. The first day of voting was extended by an extra day in the Southern Highlands and Hela provinces because the voting centres were not set up in time, while the voting on 27 June for Enga province was also extended by a day. On the same day, in Hela supporters of the 81 candidates running in the election turned violent in Tari after radio reports of moving ballot boxes to a bigger centre, such as Mount Hagen, in order to ascertain the result because of tensions related to possible ballot stuffing and voter intimidation. The voters tried to prevent the removal of the boxes by blocking roads out of the city and prevent take- offs from the airport; others also went to the local police station where the ballot boxes were stored, but were driven back by both police and Defence Force soldiers. Andrew Trawen then announced that the vote counting would occur with the province after a secure place was decided. He said that the \\"options were Port Moresby and Mount Hagen but it was considered that the people of Hela province need to embrace the elections and take responsibility for their own destiny.\\" In the Western Highlands 29 June was the scheduled date of voting but was postponed to 1 July so that security forces could arrive from the Southern Highlands and Enga; however, the voting could be further postponed by one or two days. Paul Ogil, the cousin of former Foreign Secretary Gabriel Pepson, who is working with his campaign, said: \\"Any postponement of polling is a burden to them (candidates) because they have to keep disbursing money (such as meals, a place to sleep and fares home for those visiting the \\"campaign house\\" of candidates, as well as supporting a fleet of about 10 cars with each vehicle and its crew costing about 500 kina a day in fuel, food, and buai). This means they have to spend hundreds of thousands of kina a day extra. All our bank balances are dwindling to nothing. We are all praying: the sooner it's over the better for us.\\" According to the election observer Transparency International's Operations Manager Jerry Bagita, the process in other coastal and island provinces went off peacefully. There were reports of underage, illegal voting, as well as the poor quality of the indelible ink used to mark voters, which facilitated double voting. On 4 July 2012, The National reported that four people, including an election official had been charged with tampering with ballot boxes and papers in the Dei electorate of the Western Highlands. It was alleged that the four individuals stole six ballot boxes and filled them with doctored ballot papers before returning them to the CEG officials. In Hela province, two empty boxes were also stolen and returned with doctored ballots, while three other ballot boxes were destroyed by angry voters. Additionally, in Kandep, Enga province, on 7 July a GEC officer was stabbed to death, while a colleague was injured in a bush-knife at a vote counting centre in Wabag allegedly as revenge for another murder. Following this voting was suspended for two days. Vote counting in Port Moresby also resumed the next day after resolution to a dispute over payments with GEC officials. Trawen also did not comment on the burning of ballots over the dispute. Though he said vote counting was ongoing in eight of 22 provinces, there was concern that monitors‚Äîsome of whom were employed by candidates‚Äîhad interfered in what was supposed to be independent vote counting. \\"We will not hesitate to remove any scrutineer from counting venues that continuously cross the line during counting sessions. The elections are not over. We still appeal to every citizen to ensure it is free, fair and safe elections right through to the end, regardless of the hiccups and security situations we have had so far.\\" Parliamentary Speaker Jeffrey Nape was arrested following a charge of attempting to bribe a candidate and of undue influence in his home province of Simbu, according to provincial police commander Augustine Wampe. While Nape said the charge was politically motivated, he was due to attend a court hearing into the matter after the electoral process. The voting timeframe was also speculated to being increased as the highlands provinces would not finish in time. The Bougainville area was also inaccessible as the GEC did not have the ships to transport its team to the said outlying atolls until the following week. However, vote counting had already started in the other provinces where voting had finished, despite protests against the process. Despite the problems, on 2 July, Andrew Trawen said that, according to national law, vote counting would begin as soon as possible as \\"that is the procedure we've followed over the years, we have not swayed from that. We will continue to abide by that provision of the law.\\" Results Reactions Electoral observers said the election was not a failure, even though they were not in full praise.

It is a zooxanthellate coral, having symbiotic unicellular zooxanthellae in the tissues which provide it with energy. Distribution and habitat Porites compressa occurs in the Indo- Pacific region, the Red Sea and East African coast. Around Hawaii it is common and is found on reefs and in lagoons to a depth of where the water is relatively undisturbed. In Kaneohe Bay it is the dominant coral species and sometimes forms monospecific stands. Threats Porites compressa is affected by rising sea temperatures but it is more resistant to bleaching than many other corals. It is more susceptible to coral diseases than some other species however and it is stressed corals that are most likely to succumb to disease. Coral reefs in general are under threat from many causes. These include El Nino events, ocean acidification, trawling and other fishery activities, competition from invasive species and human activities which includes pollution and the collection of corals for the aquarium trade.

It was the first public library created with the consent of the Chilean government and was established on February 27, 1873. It holds 80,000 volumes. The current building was built between 1912 and 1919, was damaged during the February 27, 2010 earthquake and later restored. It was declared National Monument in 1998.Biblioteca Santiago Sever√≠n de Valpara√≠so reabre sus puertas () History In its early years, the library was originally housed within some available rooms of the Courts of Justice before then being moved to another location on what is today Calle Edwards between 1912 and 1919.During this time, Santiago Severin, a businessman and philanthropist from Buenos Aires, Argentina began donating funds to being the construction of a more suitable and permanent building to house the library‚Äôs growing collection. This structure was designed by the architects Arnaldo Barison and Renato Schiavon and built by the engineer, Augusto Geiger. The library itself was built in Neoclassical-Renaissance architectural style, and featured several prominent aspects of this style including pilasters and columns. The original plans as specified by the architects included that the building be 58 meters long, 12 meters wide, and 15 meters high, and maintain the form of an acute rectangle surrounded by four streets. This was in order to ensure that passersby on the street would be provided with a complete overview of the whole building. After the building was completed in 1919, the collection was officially moved into the current building which was named for its benefactor, Santiago Severin. In the 1980s the library was reopened after undergoing several important refurbishments to the original construction including a new basement and additions to its various interior rooms and collections. However, after a powerful earthquake on February 27, 2010, the library sustained significant damage which resulted in the structure requiring further reconstruction and restoration efforts leaving the library inoperable until the following year. Donations provided by various institutions such as Universidad Cat√≥lica de Valpara√≠so and the Consejo de la Cultura y las Artes, allowed for the rebuilding of the library and the future development of additional infrastructure improvements including accessibility to patrons with disabilities, updated lighting and furniture. Today, the Biblioteca Santiago Sever√≠n is one of several regional libraries that make up the Sistema Nacional de Bibliotecas P√∫blicas de la Direcci√≥n de Bibliotecas Archivos y Museos (National System of Public Libraries of the Directorate of Libraries, Archives, and Museums.) In addition, it was declared a Historical Monument of Chile in 1998 by the Ministry of Interior.

The Constitution of Albania sets a limit to a maximum of two terms in office. When this majority is not reached in the first round of voting, a second round takes place within seven days. If such a majority is still not reached, a third round must take place within a further period of seven days. If even in the first three rounds no candidate has attained the necessary majority, a further two rounds must be held within seven days, with the majority needed to win being reduce to an absolute majority or 50% +1 vote of the total Members of the Parliament. If after five rounds of voting no candidate has attained the necessary majority outlined for each round of voting in the Parliament, the Parliament will be dissolved and a general election must occur within 60 days. Candidates While the two major parties (the ruling Democratic Party and the oppositional Socialist Party) are bickering about the name of the new Head of State, some smaller parties have already proposed their candidates. The Albanian Christian Democratic Movement has formally announced the current Speaker of Parliament Jozefina Topalli as their presidential nominee, this was a surprising choice as Topalli has widely been seen and speculated upon by the media as the potential Democratic Party candidate for the post.Kandidaturat p√´r president, Aleanca Demokristiane propozon Jozefina Topallin , Gazeta Shqip, 2012-04-29 (in Albanian) Other smaller parties have also presented their candidates. The Democratic Alliance Party has officially proposed the name of its current leader Neritan Ceka as the party's nominee for the presidential race. For the representative of this party Ceka has all the chances to be chosen as a compromise candidate and win the support of all the parties. Aleko Gjergjo and Hajredin Fratari are the two candidates that have been proposed by the Democratic National Front Party. A name that has been speculated upon by the media to be a strong contender in the presidential race is that of former Prime Minister and presidential candidate Fatos Nano. He received only 3 votes in the previous presidential election held in 2007 because most members of the opposition coalition led by the Socialist Party did not support him, however, and chose to boycott this Presidential Election. Unity for Human Rights Party have officially stated its support for Nano's nomination.

It accused the Democratic Party of not consulting them over the move to elect Zaganjori. Parliamentary speaker Jozefina Topalli said that \\"I urge all political parties to pursue a spirit of acceptance, and then the solution will come in the second or third round.\\" Second round The Democratic Party insisted on naming Zaganjori, with Prime Minister Sali Berisha saying that \\"we've done our part, we gave up our initial positions, renouncing a political candidature and take a step towards the opposition in order to reach a mutual agreement. Let's hope the opposition do their part now.\\" The Socialist Party countered in saying that Zaganjori's nomination was put forward unilaterally and asked for more negotiations to reach a compromise. The Leader of the Opposition Edi Rama said that \\"our objective is to give the country a head of state who receives support both from the government and the opposition. We aren't laying out any conditions. The government must make it possible for us to also make a contribution.\\" Third round On 8 June, no vote was taken as there was no candidate following the Socialist Party's rejection of Zaganjori. Zaganjori then withdrew his candidacy, stating that he wanted to be elected as a consensus candidate and as the opposition did not trust him he did not want to be elected with the governing party's votes alone.http://www.setimes.com/cocoon/setimes/xhtml/en_GB/features/setimes/features/2012/06/09/feature-01 Fourth round On 10 June, the day before the vote, a meeting between the leaders of the Socialist Party, the Democratic Party, the Socialist Movement for Integration and Justice for Integration and Unity was inconclusive, the proposed candidates for the first list were: Arben Imami (Minister of Defense), Bujar Nishani (Minister of Interior), Artan Hoxha (columnist), Petraq Milo (prime minister's adviser). A second non-political list included: Edmond Islamaj (member of Supreme Court of Albania), Vitore Tusha also member of Supreme Court, Ledio Bianku. The Socialist Movement for Integration's Ilir Meta said the consensus candidate would be Hoxha, although the opposition was rumoured to have named Pandeli Majko as their candidate On the day of the vote, Hoxha withdrew his candidacy saying: > Until yesterday night I hoped that the presidential process would have the > minimal spirit of understanding and consensus, and this morning, after > receiving hundreds of congratulatory messages, with some of them coming from > Socialist Party members, I have continued to hope that the presidential > process still promised consensus. But seeing the aggressive stances of > Socialist exponents and their media, including slander and blackmail, I > reached the conclusion that the presidential process cannot have the minimum > of civilization, and due to the political interests, the process will not be > allowed to contribute the civil factors. I have followed the presidential > process very closely and have commented for a reasonable and consensual > reason. I thought to contribute in the last session for the same goal, but > based on what I declared above, I cannot be part of this process which > apparently warns a storm. The Democratic Party's parliamentary leader, Astrit Patozi, said that Nishani would be the candidate at a voting session at 17:00. The Socialist Party's Edi Rama also said that Fatos Nano would not be the party's candidate: \\"If Nano‚Äôs candidacy would be consensual, we would not break the consensus, but he cannot be our candidate, because we cannot break our principles and ruin Albania‚Äôs opportunity for the EU candidate status.\\" He also said the Socialist Party would never support Hoxha as \\"it is unacceptable for a minister to become president, especially in a time of crisis like the one we‚Äôre in.\\" Nano reacted to the Socialist Party's decision in saying that \\"this is the moment when the party leaders should think beyond their close political accounts that have deteriorated Albania, and show their full responsibility for the love of the country, with its values and merits that a European country deserves.\\" He also said that he proposed himself as a consensus candidate to bring about a solution and preface a possible Socialist Party win in the next parliamentary election, as well as a win for all Albanians. The vice leader of the Socialist Movement for Integration, Petrit Vasili, would support an agreement with the Democratic Party to choose a president. The head of the United for Humans Right party, Vangjel Dule, said that: \\"The majority still showed that they cannot elect the President, even with simple majority. I appeal the opposition and Edi Rama, since we have an incapable majority, to not allow the opposition to avoid the political battle, but offer its alternative through Fatos Nano.\\" The Party for Justice, Integration and Unity's Shpetim Idrizi also said that the Socialist Party should support Nano‚Äôs candidacy. Gazmend Oketa, one of the founders of the New Democratic Spirit, added to calls for a consensus candidate president. \\"Our country needs consensus, and our country seems on the brink of early elections.\\" The final vote came despite calls from the Western world for a consensus candidate. On 11 June, 76 voted were cast. However, two MPs filed a white vote. Nishani was elected with 73 votes. He then shook hands with MPs but did not make a speech. European Union's ambassador to Albania, Ettore Sequi, issued a statement that read: \\"The role of the president in anchoring Albania's state institutions in independence and in helping the country unite its efforts will be of crucial importance for Albania to successfully address the challenges it faces on its path towards the European Union.\\"  See also  * Politics of Albania * President of Albania References 2012 2012 elections in Europe 2012 in Albania ","title":"2012 Albanian presidential election"},{"id":"34167954","text":"Ithomia avella is a Neotropical species of butterfly of the family Nymphalidae.

Fellow ace Sabur≈ç Sakai called him \\"a genius in the air.\\" Second Sino-Japanese War Kaneyoshi Muto was born to a humble farming family in June 1916 in Aichi Prefecture. Muto grew to a height of ‚Äîshort in stature‚Äîand enlisted in the Imperial Japanese Navy in June 1935 when he was 19. After serving for a brief period aboard the destroyer Uranami he applied for flight training to advance his career. In July 1936 he graduated as a naval aviator and was assigned to the Omura Air Group. Muto went to war in China flying with the 12th Air Group. He earned his first air victory on 4 December 1937 during the Battle of Nanking when he shot down a Soviet-made Polikarpov I-16. Muto continued fighting in China, flying many sorties over Hankou to become an ace with five victories. For his distinguished service, he was honored with an official commendation on 30 April 1938. Among his fellow pilots on the ground, he was well-liked for his great sense of humor. Pacific War Parallel to the attack on Pearl Harbor, Japanese forces attacked the Philippines. On 8 December 1941 Muto, flying with the 3rd Air Group, took part in the attacks on Iba Airfield and Clark Airfield to eliminate the immediate threat of American air power. Muto fought further air battles in the Java Sea, in the Solomon Islands, and in New Guinea. He fought alongside Sabur≈ç Sakai through mid-1944 on the island of Iwo Jima, surviving to be called by Sakai \\"the toughest fighter pilot in the Imperial Navy.\\" In December 1944, Muto was posted to the Japanese Home Islands to join Captain Minoru Genda in his 343rd K≈çk≈´tai formed to defend against Boeing B-29 Superfortress attacks. Muto has also been identified as a tactics instructor with the Yokosuka Air Group, based at Naval Air Facility Atsugi in early 1945. There, Muto flew a powerful Kawanishi N1K-J Shiden, a type codenamed \\"George\\" by the Americans. At that time, he and his wife Kiyoko were expecting a child. On 16 February 1945, Muto and at least nine fellow airmen scrambled to meet an incoming flight of enemy fighters. The Japanese fighters were a mixed group of Mitsubishi A6M Zeros, J2M Raidens, and Kawanishi Shidens such as the one Muto flew. The latter two types were heavily armed, each carrying four 20 mm Type 99 cannon. The enemy was a group of seven U.S. Navy Grumman F6F Hellcats flying from the aircraft carrier . The Americans were well-trained but this was their first combat, and the Japanese veteran pilots shot down four without loss to themselves. Two of the Americans were killed in action and two were taken prisoner of war. After the squadron of Japanese pilots landed at Yokosuka, newspaper reporters wrote about Muto alone, ignoring the others in his flight. Muto was said to have fought a dozen Hellcats alone, shooting down four and chasing the others away. They compared him to the legendary Samurai swordsman Miyamoto Musashi, thrusting and attacking with a fighter aircraft rather than a sword. Muto's wife read these triumphant reports while recovering from the birth of their daughter. The story of Muto flying alone was the one related by Genda to Norman Polmar, U.S. Navy historian,Polmar, 2006, p. 464 and to Masatake Okumiya, Jiro Horikoshi and Martin Caidin, who co-wrote the book Zero! Muto continued to serve in combat, defending Japan against American forces such as in March 1945 when aircraft from Task Force 58 flew over Shikoku. In June he was posted to the 343rd Air Group, 301st Squadron commanded by veteran ace Naoshi Kanno. A recovered and preserved Kawanishi N1K-J Shiden, possibly flown by Muto On 24 July 1945, over the Bungo Channel, Muto and other pilots scrambled to attack a larger group of American fighters which turned out to be Hellcats from VF-49, part of Task Force 38 supporting the bombing of Kure. Greatly outnumbered, Muto was shot down and never seen again. Takashi Oshibuchi, the commander of the 701st Squadron, was also among the six veteran Japanese airmen who did not return from the violent action.Sakaida, 1998, p. 89 Legacy Japanese military officials gave Muto credit for 35 aerial victories at the time of his death. Sakai wrote in 1957 that this figure included four B-29s, which were very difficult to shoot down.Sakai, 1957, p. 361 After the war, Muto was credited with 28 victories by U.S. Air Force researchers studying battle records. In the 1970s, one of the Shiden fighters was recovered from Bungo Channel in shallow water some from shore. Among the fishermen who helped bring the aircraft to the surface were ones who had witnessed it falling into the water on 24 July 1945. The wrecked aircraft showed no bullet holes and provided no other clue as to what caused it to ditch. It was restored for display and placed in an exhibit at a nearby museum in Shikoku. No evidence is available to identify which 343rd Air Group pilot flew the fighter, so the museum honors all six of the Shiden pilots who lost their lives that day, including Muto and Oshibuchi.

Career as a photographer Stoneman was born in Plymouth, Devon, on 6 April 1876, the second youngest of fourteen children of Edwin Stoneman, who ran a wholesale grocer's business. He went to school at Plymouth College, which he left when he was fifteen to embark on a career as a photographer. He later had his own photographic business in Plymouth, Heath and Stoneman Ltd., but most of his career was spent working for the London firm of J. Russell & Sons, which he had joined as a junior photographer by 1897. In June 1897, he was the only one of fourteen photographers working for J. Russell & Sons who succeeded in taking four pictures of Queen Victoria in her golden state landau on the occasion of her diamond jubilee. Working for J. Russell & Sons, he took numerous photographs of royalty, aristocracy, members of high society and other prominent individuals. By 1913 he became managing director of the firm, and after the death of John Lemmon Russell in 1915 he ran the company. In October 1932 it was absorbed into Elliott & Fry. In 1961, Walter Bird purchased Russell & Sons and became its leading photographer; he sold the company to Godfrey Argent in 1967. In 1948 Stoneman was made a Member of the Order of the British Empire (MBE) for services to photography. He continued working as a photographer right until his death in 1958. Stoneman was a fellow of both the Royal Photographic Society and the Royal Geographical Society, as well as vice-president of the London Devonian Association. He was also a lay preacher in the Congregational Church. He was married to Kathleen Irene (born 1892), and had one son. National Photographic Record In 1917, in collaboration with the National Portrait Gallery, Stoneman launched a project to build a National Photographic Record (NPR) of all prominent members of British society. Over the next 41 years Stoneman took and printed postcard- sized pictures of some 7,000 individuals in his studio, between 100 and 200 a year, and provided them to NPG. The project focussed on political and military figures, and sitters included five monarchs, nine prime ministers, twelve lord chancellors, eighty admirals and one hundred generals. Sitters did not pay for the privilege of being photographed by Stoneman, but were photographed free at the studios of J. Russell & Sons at Baker Street, and so Stoneman was not directly remunerated for producing the photographs. The original idea of Stoneman was for storing visual records rather than distributing them. However, parts of the collection were occasionally exhibited to the public, for example at the Royal Photographic Society in 1922 and 1924, at the studios of J. Russell & Sons in Baker Street in 1931, and at Foyles Art Gallery in 1943. The fees collected from such exhibitions and from reproductions of the photographs were shared between Stoneman and the NPG. These exhibitions also helped boost his reputation and increase his clientele. Up until his death Stoneman had been the sole official photographer for the NPR. After his death, the NPR project continued with Walter Bird as photographer until 1967, when he was succeeded by Godfrey Argent who continued the project until it was stopped in 1970. By then, the collections counted more than 10,000 photographs.

It was last was assigned to Air Force Special Weapons Center, stationed at Kirtland AFB, New Mexico. It was inactivated on 16 August 1961. The mission of the unit was to serve as a permanent United States Air Force Air Task Group for atmospheric testing. With the phase-down of atmospheric testing activities as a result of the 1958 moratorium between the United States and Soviet Union, in August 1961 the unit was disestablished. History On 1 September 1956, Air Force Special Weapons Command organized the 4950th Test Group (Nuclear) to serve as a permanent USAF Air Task Group for atmospheric nuclear testing. Throughout the remainder of the 1950s, the 4950th Test Group (Nuclear)‚Äîas the representative of the USAF‚Äîsupported the various Nevada and Pacific test series. Nuclear tests supported by the group were: * 1957 Operation Plumbob * 1957-1958 Project 58, Project 58A * 1958 Operation Hardtack I * 1958 Operation Argus * 1958 Operation Hardtack II In 1958 a voluntary nuclear test moratorium was being considered, spurred by worldwide concern about the fallout of radionuclides from clouds blown around the Earth after atmospheric tests. In January, the ARDC began a study to determine the effects of a test moratorium on the USAF nuclear capabilities. In August, President Dwight D. Eisenhower proposed that an international conference be called to discuss permanent suspension of nuclear and thermonuclear weapons testing. He also announced that on 31 October the U.S. would suspend nuclear testing for a period of one year. The Hardtack II test series ended on 30 October and the test ban went into effect on 31 October. The Soviet Union also suspended testing, though both nations reserved the right to resume testing. At first, no dramatic changes occurred. There were no changes in units, facilities, or responsibilities. The 4950th Test Group continued with AFSWC activities in the interim. However, in August 1959, phase down of the 4950th Test Group (Nuclear) at Eniwetok was approved and the facility moved into maintenance standby status. In October, the AFSWC proposed further reorganizations of the 4950th Test Group (Nuclear), but these proposals were not carried out. The 4950th Test Group (Nuclear) was given responsibility for Eniwetok buildup in the event that testing was resumed. In 1960, the 4926th Test Squadron (Sampling) moved from the 4950th Test Group (Nuclear) and consolidated with other organizations into the 4925th Test Group (Atomic). The 4951st Support Squadron (Test) was discontinued at Eniwetok, and base supplies and personnel transferred to Kirtland AFB. The USAF also directed the transfer of Indian Springs AFB from the ARDC to Tactical Air Command, which occurred 1 April 1961, and AFSWC recommended discontinuation of the 4950th Test Group. As the phase-down of testing activities continued during the moratorium, in August 1961 the 4950th Test Group (Nuclear) was inactivated on 16 August 1961.

During campaigning, the opposition UNITA and its offshoot CASA-CE accused and criticised the government of corruption and called for greater transparency; this also led to protests and arrests the day before the election. These were the first elections after the new 2010 Constitution was instituted. Background While UNITA accepted the result of the National Assembly elections in 1992, it rejected that of the presidential elections, alleging fraud. The party then resumed the civil war, though its MPs still took their seats in the National Assembly. As a result, the second round of the presidential elections were not held, nor were the legislative elections due at regular intervals in accordance with the 1992 constitution. The civil war came to an end in 2002, following the death of UNITA's leader Jonas Savimbi in an ambush. The MPLA still refused to hold the second round of the presidential election, but organised legislative elections in 2008. The MPLA's resultant majority allowed it to adopt a new constitution in 2010, abolishing the direct election of the president. The constitution stipulated that legislative elections would be held at intervals of five years and that the leader of the party that received the most votes would become president. The expectation of all parties was that this would lead to the endurance of the dominant party system. Electoral system At the time of the election, the National Assembly had 220 seats, of which 130 were elected from closed lists by proportional representation and the remaining 90 elected in 18 five-seat constituencies. Process required that following the election, the leader of the largest party would become president. Voters had to be at least 18 years old and not have an undischarged bankruptcy or criminal conviction. Candidates had to be at least 35 years old. Over 10,000 voting centres were opened from 7:00-18:00, while the day was declared a national holiday. Campaign A total of nine parties and coalitions contested the elections, four of which are parties (the MPLA, UNITA, the National Liberation Front of Angola (FNLA) and the Social Renewal Party); and five of which are coalitions (the United Front for Change of Angola (FUMA), the New Democracy Electoral Union, the People's Party for Development (PAPOD), CASA‚ÄìCE and the Political Opposition Council (CPO)). CASA-CE is a breakaway from UNITA that was formed after its leader Abel Chivukuvuku lost the UNITA leadership election to Samakuva, and it sought to mobilise voters from inside and outside UNITA against the MPLA. On 13 June 2012, the MPLA Central Committee designated incumbent President Jos√© Eduardo dos Santos as head of the MPLA party list and Manuel Vicente, the Minister of State for Economic Coordination, as the second candidate on the list. Under the constitution, this would result in dos Santos receiving another term as president, with Vicente becoming vice-president. UNITA criticised the government for corruption and, amongst other reasons, giving the contract to run the election to the Spanish company Indra-Sistemas SA, which also ran the 2008 election and was accused of helping the MPLA win that election. The media were also reported to have been biased in their coverage in favour of the incumbent MPLA. However, UNITA was also expected to gain a larger share of the vote and cut the MPLA's popular vote from the previous election. Other issues centred on greater transparency and a more democratic government. Conduct National police commander General Ambr√≥sio de Lemos said he was ready to ensure that electoral laws were enforced: \\"We will not tolerate nor allow these elections to be derailed. Citizens must be able to access the polling stations, in accordance with their civil rights, without any problems.\\" The day before the election, as members of CASA-CE sought to enter the office of the National Electoral Commission (CNE) in order observation rights, police arrested about a dozen party members. Party candidate William Tonet told Reuters that police outside the building that they had fired shots to keep away young party members. However, this was unconfirmed by an unnamed police officer at the Quarta Esquadra police station nearby, though the arrests were affirmed. Tonet added that no injuries occurred. He mentioned that of the 6,850 requestioned accreditions, only 3,000 had been given. However, the CNE had said it approved 97,000 local observers from the nine parties and coalitions that were contesting the election. Luis Ngimbi, the head of a local team of observers, said of the campaign that \\"while no major incidents were reported, the campaign has been disappointing because of the lack of details of promises.\\" Samakuva also expressed concern prior to the election about possible irregularities, mainly in regards to the voter roll. He said: \\"Many Angolans' names don't appear on the voter roll, and in many places the voter roll has not been released. We have come to the conclusion that the National Electoral Commission is not ready. The conditions don't exist to ensure the minimum of an organised, transparent process.\\" He also sought to meet Dos Santos to express the concerns and ask for monitoring accreditation for 2,000 of its party workers. After Dos Santos, who voted at a school near his official residence, said: \\"I am satisfied because the process is going smoothly throughout the country. I urge all Angolans to vote, to vote for democracy, which is important,\\" he said. \\"Today people have power in their hands, and it's a great responsibility.\\" This was the first direct vote on his presidency. The African Union claimed that the elections had been \\"free, fair, transparent and credible\\", but noted that opposition parties had not been given equal access to the media.Angola election judged 'free and fair' by African Union BBC News, 2 September 2012 UNITA announced that they would appeal the results of the election, claiming that the results announced by the National Election Commission did not match their counts at polling stations.Angola's Unita party to appeal Dos Santos election win AGI, 2 September 2012 CASA-CE took the same position.UNITA garante ter provas de fraude nas elei√ß√µes em Angola , P√∫blico, 2 September 2012 Results As expected, results vary greatly from one region to another. In Luanda Province and Cabinda Province, UNITA and CASA‚ÄìCE together received about 40% of the vote, compared to 25% nationally. Another feature is the high abstention rate, of 37.2%, compared to 12.5% in the 1992 elections.

The novel is set in the Ten Thousand Islands, off the southwest coast of Florida, it tells the story of the Bigtree family of alligator wrestlers who live in Swamplandia! an alligator-wrestling theme park. Swamplandia! is Russell's first novel. The book originated as a short story, titled \\"Ava Wrestles the Alligator\\", published in the Summer 2006 issue of the literary magazine Zoetrope: All-Story, when Russell was 24 years old. Plot The novel opens with the Bigtree family suffering tragedy and finding their way of life under threat. The family patriarch, Sawtooth Bigtree, has recently been confined to a floating nursing home with dementia and his daughter-in-law, Hilola Bigtree, has recently died of cancer, leaving behind a husband and three teenage children. Meanwhile, a brand new amusement park, The World of Darkness, has opened nearby on the Florida mainland. In light of plummeting attendance and mounting debts, The Chief, Hilola's husband, unveils a plan for improvements to Swamplandia!, but his son Kiwi is skeptical and suggests selling the park altogether. Having grown up on Swamplandia! himself, the Chief is adamantly opposed to abandoning his family's unique heritage and lifestyle. The Chief's middle child, Osceola, becomes obsessed with ghosts and with occult knowledge she's gleaned from an old book, The Spiritist's Telegraph. Osceola begins to hold seances with her younger sister Ava in an attempt to contact their dead mother. Osceola's loneliness and inability to talk with her mother drives her to talk to dead \\"boyfriends\\". Osceola sometimes disappears at night leading her sister to worry that she might be possessed by spirits. Meanwhile, Kiwi continues to clash with his father over selling Swamplandia!, and he eventually decides to leave the island in an attempt to save the theme park on his own. He finds minimum-wage employment as a janitor at The World of Darkness and eventually befriends his coworker Vijay, who helps him learn to adopt normal teenage vernacular and mannerisms. Kiwi begins to attend night school and is promoted to lifeguard. When he rescues a teenage girl, Kiwi becomes a local hero and, as a result, The World of Darkness sends him to train as an airplane pilot. With no new tourists arriving at Swamplandia!, The Chief decides to shut the park down. He also decides to take a business trip of unspecified purpose and duration to the mainland, leaving Ava and Osceola alone on the island. One day, while clearing melaleuca plants on a remote part of the island, Ava and Osceola discover a decaying dredge boat offshore. The girls recover some artifacts and Osceola attempts to communicate with the dead crew using her Ouija board. Osceola reveals what she has learned: In the 1930s a young man named Louis Thanksgiving ran away from the abuse of his adoptive family on a farm in the midwest. Osceola confesses that she is in love with Louis' ghost and, when Osceola and the dredge disappear, Ava fears that she has run off with him. Now alone on Swamplandia!, Ava meets the Bird Man and hires him to take her in his pole boat to find her sister. Ava and the Bird Man travel into the remote wilderness. Eventually, Ava becomes convinced that the Bird Man has no special powers and that he is taking advantage of her. When they encounter a group of drunken fishermen, Ava screams to get their attention, and the Bird Man silences her. Later, the Bird Man rapes the thirteen-year-old Ava. Eventually, Ava is able to flee the Bird Man and escape by diving into a pond where she wrestles her way out of an alligator attack. She surfaces and strikes out across the dense sawgrass marshes still miles from home. Kiwi, meanwhile, discovers that his fiercely independent father has been working secretly at a casino, possibly for many years. Kiwi continues his pilot training and, on his first flight, notices Osceola, wearing the remains of their mother's wedding dress, stranded in the swamp. Osceola explains that she did elope with the ghost of Louis Thanksgiving, but that Louis left her at the altar. Ava, Osceola, and Kiwi are reunited with their father. As the family plans for the future, they realize that they will have to abandon Swamplandia! and move to mainland Florida, where Ava and Osceola will attend high school. Major characters Ava Bigtree Thirteen year-old Ava, the youngest Bigtree child, is the first-person narrator of much of the novel (the sections describing Kiwi's journey are told in the third person). Ava is a precocious but, at least initially, credulous hero, wanting to believe she is going to find her sister in the underworld with the help of the Bird Man. She is fascinated by her surroundings and provides much of the social and ecological commentary in the novel. Osceola Bigtree The middle sibling of the Bigtree children; Ava's older, Kiwi's younger sister. She possesses a rather kind and passive personality, and develops a passionate fascination with ghosts after she finds \\"The Spiritist's Telegraph\\" in a waterlogged library boat. Osceola is the only sibling without her own narrated chapter in the story, unless you count the chapter about Louis. Kiwi Bigtree At seventeen, Kiwi is the oldest Bigtree child. He is studious and academically gifted, but his isolated and self-guided education has left him unprepared for mainland life. He eventually leaves Swamplandia! to work at a rival park, the World of Darkness, in order to earn money for his family. He uses big words, which he frequently mispronounces, and, at least initially, he struggles to relate to the other teenagers he encounters on the mainland. The Chief The father of Ava, Osceola and Kiwi Bigtree. On Swamplandia! he goes by the name of Chief Bigtree, even by his children. He has invented a tribal world for his family despite having no native Indian heritage, and is fiercely (and unjustifiably) optimistic about the future of Swamplandia! The Bird Man A mysterious man who appears at Swamplandia! midway through the book. He claims to have magical powers and supposedly guides Ava to \\"the Underworld\\" to save her sister.  Setting  The strange and mysterious Everglades form the essential element for Ava's journey to the underworld. Ten Thousand Islands is not merely alligator country, it is the uncanny river of grass, the haunting gloom in the ever-changing mangrove tunnels, peat bogs, endless sawgrass prairies, abandoned stilt houses and shell mounds left by primordial Native Americans. The swamp is the otherworldly place for Ossie to meet her ghostly boyfriend, yet it is also her and Ava's back yard. Despite her Ohio forebears, Ava is a real native of the swamp environment, like the Native Americans she is dressed to resemble. Like the Seminoles who lost their leader, when Osceola was captured by deception, under a flag of truce, a century ago, Ava is similarly betrayed. She survives because of her unique fitness in this strange environment. Alternating between Ava's fantastic voyage in the swamp and Kiwi's struggle in his over-chilled dormitory room under The World of Darkness echos the inherent liminality of life in Florida, where land and water combine, weather and sea rise change the shapes of coasts, and the result of man-made canals and drainage projects are evident in historic droughts, invasive species and sink-holes. Both island life and life on the mainland hold dangers for motherless children, but the natural and the engineered settings are also magical and mundane worlds. Not only is the small-time carnival world of alligator wrestling over, but the new and highly automated corporate world of \\"family fun\\" is largely staffed by interchangeable teens like Kiwi. Home-schooled and well-read, Kiwi can hardly communicate with the mainland boys; even his teacher misunderstands him. Meanwhile, The Chief can barely hang onto a job promoting a tawdry sideshow of aging \\"beauties\\" in a casino, but the young and ambitious Kiwi adapts to mainland life, and rises to the status of airplane pilot, enabling him to rescue and reunite the family. Style Karen Russell has often said that her intention, right from the title of her book, was to reflect the high spirits of the novel. In an interview on National Public Radio (NPR), she describes that the exclamation point in Swamplandia! sets the tone as well as suggesting \\"something about the incongruity between how badly they want this fantasy to be the reality.\\" Russell goes on to explain that this exclamation point reflects a \\"manufactured enthusiasm\\" that comes from the family having created the Bigtree wrestling tradition, whereas in the novel, Swamplandia! is a shabby tourist attraction on a swamp. Another feature of Russell's style noted by critics is the difference between Ava's (first person) and Kiwi's (third person) narrative: While Ava's narrative provides the fantastical and nightmarish backdrop to the novel, Kiwi's point of view is \\"all na√Øve practicality\\" according to Paul Di Filippo's review and provides the more 'grounded' nightmares similar to those experienced in mundane day-to-day life. His narrative also provides much of the comic relief in the story due to his inability to integrate into mainland life. Di Filippo goes on to say that Russell employs a kind of Idioglossia; a unique language only known to the Bigtrees. For example, the family names all their alligators 'Seth' and often makes surreal descriptions: \\"A tiny, fiery Seth. Her skull was the exact shape and shining hue of a large halved strawberry.\\" According to Jane Ciabattari's review on NPR: \\"Ava's voice, which shifts fluidly from preternatural wisdom to vulnerable cluelessness, rings true to her age. Throughout the book, she dwells lovingly on the endangered beauties of South Florida's Ten Thousand Islands, from the 'glacial spires of a long oyster bed' to a 'sky-flood' of moths with sapphire-tipped wings.\\" The author as Ava uses words in a creative and imaginative way, describing the alligators as having \\"icicle overbites\\" and the \\"awesome diamonds of their heads\\". A New York Times critic summarizes Russell's unique style by stating that she has \\"honed her elegant verbal wit and fused it with the nightmare logic that makes Swamplandia! such an eccentric yet revelatory family story.\\" Main themes The strongest theme identified by critics and the author herself is the theme of loss, as Russell explains: \\"So much of the story of Swamplandia! is taken up with the girls' quest to find the ghost of their mother. Grief is a very private affair for these characters, and each member of the Bigtree family is so focused on the ghosts of the past, and their doomed, miraculous visions of the future, that they keep missing one another in the present.\\" The death of Hilola Bigtree starts what the main character, Ava, describes as \\"The Beginning of the End\\" and summarizes the Bigtree family's experience after the event in two words: \\"we fell\\". Lost in their \\"pool of grief\\" each member of the Bigtree family hatches a doomed plan to save Swamplandia!: \\"I envisioned Hilola Bigtree's death like a pool ball break, this traumatic event happens and they all spiral off into their own pocket.\\" As well as being called a Bildungsroman and a Magical Realist novel, Swamplandia! has been identified by several critics as a contemporary Southern Gothic novel. Di Filippo continues with this assessment, describing the novel as an \\"heir to a Southern tradition of tall tales, thick descriptions, deep backstories and contrary cusses as anti- heroes.\\" The Southern Gothic aspect is the many references to ghosts and the disturbing character of The Bird Man. The contrast between the macabre and disturbing imagery and the comic interludes has divided critics: Jonathan Gibbs of The Telegraph noted that: \\"It's a set-up as wacky as it is grim, and for a while Russell seems content to serve up a hyperactive comedy of despair, a sort of swampy Southern Gothic high on too much cheap cola.\\" Susan Salter Reynolds of the Los Angeles Times instead observed Russell's ability to produce conflicting emotions in the reader: \\"Russell pulls the rug out from under us in a rather brutal way and we are left not knowing whether to laugh and applaud or feel grateful for her survival.\\" Russell was influenced at a young age by the works by short story writer George Saunders (who is also recognized on the acknowledgment page of the novel) and other gothic writers, particularly Stephen King, who influenced the creation of Swamplandia! In another interview she admits that she likes to mix up genres and is reluctant to have her novel summarized under one literary tradition, in particular, the Bildungsroman tradition. Reception Writing for The New York Times, novelist Emma Donoghue praised Swamplandia!: \\"Vividly worded, exuberant in characterization, the novel is a wild ride: Russell has style in spades.\\" Donoghue continued, \\"If Russell's style is a North American take on magical realism, then her commitment to life's nitty-gritties anchors the magic; we are more inclined to suspend disbelief at the moments that verge on the paranormal because she has turned \\"Swamplandia!\\" into a credible world.\\" The Times named Swamplandia! one of the ten best books of 2011. The book was also named to the longlist for the 2011 Orange Prize for Fiction, an annual book award in the United Kingdom for female writers. Swamplandia! was one of three finalists for the 2012 Pulitzer Prize for Fiction, though no prize was ultimately awarded. The novel was one of three nominees for the inaugural Andrew Carnegie Medal for Excellence in Fiction (2012) presented by the American Library Association for the best adult fiction. Novelist Stephen King praised the novel as being: \\"Brilliant, funny, original . . . It's every bit as good as her short stories promised it would be. This book will not leave my mind.\\" Swamplandia! was ranked the sixth greatest novel of the 2010s in Paste. Proposed TV series In October 2011, HBO announced that it was producing a half-hour television series based on Swamplandia! with Scott Rudin serving as executive producer. In November 2013, however, Russell said an HBO adaptation was not likely to happen.

The 2007 Wealden District Council election took place on 3 May 2007 to elect members of Wealden District Council in East Sussex, England. The whole council was up for election and the Conservative party stayed in overall control of the council. Background At the 2003 election the Conservatives held control of the council with 34 seats, compared to 15 for the Liberal Democrats and 6 independents. However, in September 2006 Liberal Democrat councillor Stephen Shing was expelled from the Liberal Democrats and continued on the council as an independent. The Conservatives took 4 seats without any opposition and were also guaranteed seats in other wards where there were not enough candidates from other parties for the number of seats being contested. The returning officer for Wealden, Charlie Lant, formed a band called The Council Tax Band with other council officers and performed a song called Vote! in an effort to boost turnout at the election. An important issue at the election was a legal loophole, which was allowing developers to build increased numbers of houses in the area. Election result The Conservatives held control of the council staying on 34 seats, but both the Conservative leader of the council Nigel Coltman and the Liberal Democrat group leader Laura Murphy were defeated. The Liberal Democrats lost 2 seats, dropping to 12 councillors, while independents remained on 7 seats and the Green party won its first councillors on the council after gaining 2 seats. Overall turnout at the election was 38.51%, up from 35% in 2003. The Conservative leader Nigel Coltman was defeated by Liberal Democrat Brian Cook in Hailsham East by a 55-vote majority, with the Conservatives also losing 2 seats to the Greens in Forest Row. However the Conservatives did not suffer a net loss of seats as they also made gains including defeating the Liberal Democrat group leader Laura Murphy in Hailsham Central and North. The Liberal Democrats did gain a seat in Polegate South from an independent by 1 vote, but Stephen Shing was re-elected as an independent in Willingdon, while Shing's son Daniel also gained a seat in the same ward and Shing's wife Oi Lin gained one in Polegate North. Ward results By-elections between 2007 and 2011 Uckfield New Town A by-election was held in Uckfield New Town on 17 July 2008 after Liberal Democrat councillor Julia Hey resigned from the council. Alfriston A by-election was held in Alfriston on 25 September 2008 after Conservative Keith Whitehead stood down from the council. The seat was gained from the Conservatives by Liberal Democrat Andy Watkins with a 30-vote majority, defeating the former Conservative leader of Wealden council, Nigel Coltman who had been trying to return to the council. Heathfield North and Central A by-election was held in Heathfield North and Central on 23 September 2010 after the death of Conservative councillor Niki Oakes in June 2010.

History The general plan of the development of Moscow released in 1935 suggested that a wide avenue should be built between Lubyanka Square in the center of Moscow and Komsomolskaya Square, which contains three of the main railway stations in Moscow. The entire blocks of historical buildings were to be demolished. It was decided that a number of administrative buildings, including ministries, would be built along the avenue. Some of the projects, including the building of People's Commissariat for Agriculture by Alexey Shchusev and Tsentrosoyuz building by Le Corbusier were completed, however, the avenue was not built because of the war. The construction only resumed in the 1960s, with a number of modernist and post-modernist buildings. It was decided that after completion, the avenue will get the name of Novokirovsky Avenue (), however, the stretch to Turgenevskaya Square was only completed in the end of the 1980s, and the avenue got the name of Andrey Sakharov.

The species in this genus infect birds. They are spread by the orofaecal route. History This genus was created by Garnham in 1950. The history of this genus has been plagued with confusion. Before 1909 the species in this genus were confused with those of the genus Haemoproteus. Between 1909 and 1937 they were considered to be species of the genus Toxoplasma. It was because of this historical confusion with Toxoplasma that Garnham chose the name Atoxoplasma for this genus. Garnham defined this genus to be those parasites that infect the monocytes of birds, are strictly host specific, have a granular cytoplasm and a large nucleus. His choice of type species Atoxoplasma avium was later shown to be a junior synonym of Atoxplasma paddae. Lainson in 1958 published a study suggesting that these species were transmitted by ticks and that this genus was a synonym of Lankesterella - a genus of species that infects frogs.Lainson R (1958) Some observations on the life-cycle of Atoxoplasma, with particular reference to the parasite's schizogony and its transmission by the mite Dermanyssus gallinae.

In Angels of Mercy Ankerberg criticizes Guiley's assertion that \\"angels\\" should be trusted unconditionally without the fear-based belief that they might be demons, saying that it is irrational and that he believes demons are indeed impersonating angels.

Biography  Pierce Knox 1950 Born in Washington, Iowa, Pierce Knox lost his sight at the age of 4 after contracting spinal meningitis. Knox attended public schools in Iowa and for a time attended a state school for the blind where he learned to read Braille and to otherwise cope with his permanent blindness. He had a natural talent for music and experimented with the drums. When he was 12 his parents purchased a marimba for him and he was soon playing the instrument, a close cousin to the xylophone. The family relocated to California and Knox entered the public school system and graduated from high school. He became somewhat of a local celebrity playing at assemblies and school dances.Galt High School - Highlights Yearbook (Galt, CA)  Class of 1940 Following graduation, he decided to make entertainment a profession, and for five years played the high school and college circuit throughout the United States and Canada.Ocala (FL) Star-Banner Jan 21, 1979 page 29 Knox played for the Ripley's Believe It Or Not program at the 1939-40 World's Fair in New York and later continued to tour many high schools and collegesUniversity of Notre Dame Yearbook 1941 page 149 to demonstrate that his blindness did not limit his musical ability and accomplishments.Oswego, Mich, Argus Press, October 21, 1941, page 10 He soon achieved national recognition when he earned a place in the finals of the Horace Heidt Original Youth Opportunity radio show during the programs first year in 1947. His popularity with listeners and audiences prompted the host to sign Knox as a regular member of the touring company. In 1950 he joined Heidt's Air Force sponsored tour of American bases. When Heidt's television series began, Knox again qualified for the grand finals by winning 13 times in the weekly competitions. His xylophone rendition of \\"Second Hungarian Rhapsody\\" by Lizst, brought him the $5,000 grand prize and the championship crown in the TV series. During the next three years he was a Horace Heidt regular, playing at Army installations in Germany, France and Vienna, and before civilian audiences in Paris, Berlin and Munich.

Other series from this manufacturer were also named after stars and planets, possibly because of the \\"sun and planet\\" gears at the rear axle. Increasingly heavy trucks were named Magirus Sirius, Mercur, Saturn, Jupiter, Pluto and Uranus. The trucks were equipped with different variations of air cooled Diesel engines, from 4R to V12. The initially round hood (\\"Rundhauber\\") was eventually changed to a square design (\\"Eckhauber\\") in all wheel drive models to facilitate body flexing off road. The round hood was ultimately discontinued. . Specifications In 1964 the \\"Mercur 125 (A)\\" and Mercur 150 (A)\\" models were re-branded as 125 D 10 (A) and 150 D 10 (A). The numbers 125 and 150 referred to the horse power rating of the V6 engines; the 10 to the total gross weight of the vehicle. An optional designation was \\"A\\" for \\"Allrad\\" (All Wheel Drive). A forward control option was available. After a transition period, the Mercur was replaced by the mostly forward control 170 series in 1972. A typical configuration of the Mercur as a fire truck was with a 600 gallon per minute pump inside the shelter that was powered by the truck engine. Another smaller pump (200 gallons per minute) could be carried (400 lbs) and was powered by a 34 hp Volkswagen Beetle engine (air cooled as well). Tankers were equipped with a 630 gallon water tank and did generally not have the carry-on pump.

A 9.5L 150 hp version (2300 rpm) was an option. Top speed is between 45 and 55 mph with 8.25 R 20 or 12.00 R 20 tires, respectively. Gas mileage is about 10 mpg. Thanks to his locking center differential, the Mercur trucks are capable off road vehicles, and many of these trucks were converted into motor homes after retirement from the fire departments.German Globetrotter forum Other truck models The Magirus Deutz trucks were very successful, especially as dump trucks in construction (referred to as \\"German Bulls\\", mostly Mercurs and Saturns). The Mercur model could be found in so many German fire departments that it has been called the prototypical German fire engine. The V8 \\"Jupiter\\" was often used as an airfield fire truck or a military crane. V12 Uranus models were mostly used as a crane or for towing tanks. The Jupiter and Uranus models were also used by the armed forces of several European governments (Germany, Belgium, Sweden, Denmark), and some 40+ years old Jupiter fire trucks are still being used by the German forces in Afghanistan today. Production in Yugoslavia In Yugoslavia, this bonneted truck has produced by Slovenian manufacturer TAM, as \\"TAM-Deutz\\" (110T10 - medium duty and 170T14 - heavy duty). In 1980, in factory production in this country, it was replaced by new model - cabover truck \\"TAM B-Series\\" (130T11 - medium duty, 190T15 - heavy duty, 260T26 - super heavy duty and 331T17 - hyper heavy duty).

Some of the other items on display are on loan from various contributors. The permanent collection includes American Indian artifacts from local tribes such as the Salish, Crow, Nez Perce, and Kootenai Native Americans. There are also local agricultural, scientific tools, and collections associated with the homesteading of the valley along with military uniforms and accessories dating from the American Civil War era to Operation Desert Storm. A large collection of Victorian Era household fixtures, dry goods, vintage clothing, portraits and paintings, and various other articles make up the bulk of the holdings.  Archives  The Ravalli County Museum houses a collection of archival material especially which is available to historical researchers, including vertical files of local documents and a newspaper collection with several rare original publications (dating as far back as 1880s). There is also a card catalogue with a listing of obituaries and various other topics, which are also included in a searchable database. As well as files of original documents of various types, there is a Hamilton Architectural Survey and a collection of local books.  Annual events  The Annual McIntosh Apple Day Festival, begun in 1979, is a one-day event held in October to celebrate the Apple Boom of 1907 to 1911.

It is located in eastern Lower Saxony in the town of Wolfsburg named after it and in whose possession it has been since 1961. The Wolfsburg developed from a tower house on the River Aller into a water castle with the character of a fortification. In the 17th century it was turned into a representative, but nevertheless defensible palace that was the northernmost example of the Weser Renaissance style. Its founder and builder was the noble family of von Bartensleben. After their line died out in 1742 the Wolfsburg was inherited by the counts of Schulenburg.  Name  Wolf coat of arms over the entrance The name Wolfsburg (literally \\"Wolf Castle\\") does not indicate that the region of the Vorsfelder Werder in which the castle is located had a large number of wolves, even though there were certainly wolves in the nearby wet meadows of the Dr√∂mling. The wolf that gave its name to the castle is a heraldic beast on the coat of arms of the von Bartensleben family who built the edifice. Their coat of arms comprises a leaping wolf above two sheaves of corn. The family brought the name \\"wolf\\" with them, because they can be traced back to 1188 when they were still living at Bartensleben Castle in the village of Bartensleben about 40 kilometres to the south. In the 20th century, the city built here in 1938 was named after Wolfsburg Castle. Initially it was called the Stadt des KdF-Wagens (\\"Town of the Strength through Joy Car\\") because of the industrial plant established to build the Volkswagen. After the end of the Second World War, the city council decided to rename the city Wolfsburg on 25 May 1945.  Design  Present ground plan of the Wolfsburg (towers in red  Main structure  Since the 17th century the castle has been a four-sided, solid building surrounding an inner courtyard. The main body of the castle thus has four wings, which are named after the points of the compass. The upper outline of the castle with its finely decorated cross-gables, lucarnes and pointed roofs of the wall towers form a contrast with the fortification-like walls.  Entrance  Outsize stone figures on horseback decorate the palace entrance with its round arch. Above the portal there are stone shields with the coat of arms of the Bartenslebens, chimera (Neidk√∂pfe) and equestrian figures. The portal architecture, like the terrace with its great perron on the park side, is a 19th-century addition.  Bergfried  The bergfried is integrated as an element of the west wing into the main structure and is recognisable as such by its lack of decoration and windows. The tower has an area of 9 x 9 metres, a height of around 23 metres and wall thickness of up to 3 metres. It is the oldest part of the whole site and its origins may go back to the 13th century.  Towers  In the internal corners of the courtyard there are three other towers with staircases that enable the individual floors to be accessed. These are the Watchman's Tower (Hausmannsturm) which at around 30 metres is the highest, the Owl Tower (Uhlenturm) and the hexagonal Wendelstein tower with its circular staircase. They were built in the 16th century as the castle was converted into a palace.  Wings  The north and south wings from the 16th century were mainly used for residential purposes. The roughly 25 metre high east wing was completed at the beginning of the 17th century. With its splendid decorative shapes in the Weser Renaissance style, it was very much an ostentatious reception building. On the ground floor there is a 30 metre long and 9 metre wide hall, the present Garden Hall (Gartensaal). Adjacent to it is a smaller hall the Chamber Room (Kaminzimmer) and the Gerichtlaube (district office). From the inner courtyard the wing shows traces of an arcade that once ran in front of it. At roof height it is surrounded by corbels that presumably once carried a wooden wall walk. This wing of the building clearly shows how, by the end of the 16th century, the power of the von Bartenslebens was visibly demonstrated through their architecture.  History   Foundation  Merian copperplate of the Wolfsburg The reason for the construction of the Wolfsburg was the enfeoffment of land in the area of the present-day city of Wolfsburg to the noble family of von Bartensleben in the 13th century. These knights also watched over the trade routes where they crossed the River Aller and that entailed the construction of a fortification to protect their lordship. The first definite record of the castle was in 1302 where it is referred to as the Wluesborch. The document is made out by the four brothers: Borchard, G√ºnzel, G√ºnter and Werner von Bartensleben. They were a ministerialis family (unfree knights), who came from the village of Bartensleben near Helmstedt. Their family members appeared at that time in the region, including in 1288 at the castle in Vorsfelde. In addition there is another record dating to 1135, but it is not clear whether this refers to the Wolfsburg or a predecessor castle. Emperor Lothar III then awarded the newly founded Benedictine abbey of Kaiserdom K√∂nigslutter with diversified estates, including a Wulvosburg, that is named in connexion with the village of K√§sdorf.  Middle Ages and Early Modern Period  Palace and grounds around 1800 During the Middle Ages the castle was not an enclosed site, but consisted of the bergfried and an attached building, the Old House (Altes Haus) in the present west wing. The site was a strong fortification of considerable strategic importance. Later it was even equipped with cannon, for according to a 1437 document the number of guns was to be increased by 10 pieces in the event of war. According to this record, there were only attacks on the castle during the feud of the von Bartenslebens against Duke Otto of L√ºneburg in 1464, whereby it was intended to be largely demolished (mehrentheils demoliret worden seyn). The Wolfsburg emerged from the Thirty Years' War as one of the few aristocratic castles that remained undestroyed. It was almost continuously garrisoned by troops of the warring parties, the last being the Swedes. The lords of Brunswick and Magdeburg forced their withdrawal came in 1650 by having the castellans have the fortifications slighted. Six years later the von Bartenslebens had the fortifications rebuilt because they wanted to retain the military character of the castle.  Construction history   Medieval castle  West side. Left: north wing, centre:bergfried, right: west wing Altes Haus, behind: Hausmannsturm North wing entrance. Left: typical Weser Renaissance decorations on the east wing In the early stages around 1300 the Wolfsburg only had a stone tower house (Wohnturm) on the Aller, whose precursor may have been a wooden watchtower in the style of a lowland motte. The present, roughly 23 metre high tower, later designated as the bergfried, is the oldest surviving part of the present site. It was accessible halfway up by a wooden staircase or ladder that could be hauled up in the face of enemy attack. To begin with, it may have been the tower house of the von Bartenslebens themselves. Over time it did not do justice to as an aristocratic residence and domestic building, and as a consequence other buildings and fortifications were constructed. Within the later castle, the bergfried acted as a dungeon and prison. Due to its situation in the Aller valley, the castle was probably surrounded by water from the outset. Certainly until the 19th century it was protected by two moats that were fed from the nearby Aller and the Hasselbach stream. The inner moat encircled the castle itself which, together with its drawbridges, made it a water castle. The outer moat surrounded the larger outer ward (Vorburg), a refuge place for the lord's subjects in time of war. In addition this area was protected by a curtain wall with defensive bastions or Rondellen, against which the later domestic buildings and stables, the present coach houses (Remisen) were built. Investigations in recent times revealed that the castle was not, as previously suspected, built on piles in boggy terrain. For the most part it stands on a sandy subsoil and only rests in places on oak piles. View of the southwest corner with its staircase tower, the Wendelsteinturm  Weser Renaissance palace  In the middle of the 15th century, a medieval castle no longer reflected the status of the von Bartenslebens. They turned the less comfortable building into a showy palace in the Weser Renaissance style with gardens and parks. Nevertheless it retained the character of a fortified water castle until 1840, when the protective moats were filled in as the Aller river was artificially confined and controlled. The water castle around 1840 (view of the north wing) In 1574, thanks to his great fortune, Hans von Bartensleben, the Wealthy (der Reiche), was able to begin the conversion of the castle. For this work he employed masons, stonemasons and carpenters, whom he paid. The socage rendered him by the peasants of the villages of the Vorsfelder Werder provided free manual labour as well as horses and carts. When the Bartenslebens unduly imposed on them, the farmers complained (for example in 1600) to their overlord, Duke Henry Julius of Brunswick- Wolfenb√ºttel. From then on, socage was restricted to \\"only\\" ten hours in summer and eight hours in winter, twice a week, although travel time from the villages, which were up to 15 kilometres away, was not counted. Hans the Wealthy had the Red House (Rotes Haus), a section of the building that had fallen into disrepair, demolished and erected in its place the present north wing with the entranceway to the schloss. When he died in 1583, his relative G√ºnzel, his brother G√ºnther and their uncle Jakob continued the work and built the ostentatious east wing. Then followed the south wing as the Palas with its Great Hall. Not until 1620 was the palace completed in its present shape as a four-winged building with enclosed courtyard and outside dimensions of 50 x 60 metres. Baroque garden (Broderie parterre) and tea house In converting it into a Renaissance palace, architecture and ornamentation were influenced by the Weser Renaissance style, of which the Wolfsburg is a typical example, as well as the most northeasterly one. The builders, stonemasons and sculptors who took part had also been involved in building palaces in the Weser region, for example, the Hamelin builder, Johann Edeler (also: Johann von der Mehle).

Foundation The moving spirit in founding the society in 1877 was the Baptist pastor Alfred Tilly. He gained support from the Cory brothers of Cardiff, and called on Henry Grattan Guinness and his wife Fanny to launch a mission to the interior of the Congo. Alfred Tilly resigned as secretary in October 1880 and was replaced by Fanny Guinness, a superb administrator, with the mission becoming part of the East London Institute for Home and Foreign Missions. Fanny Guinness recorded a cautionary note concerning funding in the constitution of the society in her 1890 book: ::\\"That as it is the aim of this mission to introduce into the vast Congo Valley as many Christian evangelists as possible, and as it is believed that land and native labour can be secured at small cost, the agents of the mission shall be men willing to avail themselves of these advantages, and resolved to be as little burdensome as possible to the funds of the mission. No salaries are guaranteed, but the committee as far as the means of doing so are placed in their hands, will supply the missionaries with such needful things as cannot be produced in the country\\". Activity The first missionaries to reach the Congo were Henry Craven of Liverpool, and Strom, a Danish sailor. They reached Matadi in February 1878. In March 1880, Adam McCall launched an expedition to travel up the navigable section of the river to Yellala Falls, then force its way up the stretch of rapids and obstacles to Stanley Pool. With great difficulty the expedition got as far as Bemba by the end of October, when the rains began and prevented all further progress. Meanwhile the Henry Reed, a wood-burning steamer with a shallow draft had been shipped out from England in sections. It was carried up the river to Stanley pool by 1,000 porters, reaching Leopoldville in April 1881, and after assembly was launched on 24 November 1881. The mission also acquired the steam launch Livingstone, launched on the lower Congo in May 1881. By 1881 the mission had established four missions on the lower Congo. That year they made their first converts, who traveled back to London for the first baptism in 1882. In the first five years, three men and one woman died. By 1884 the LIM had scattered missions along the south shore of the Congo as far as Stanley pool, but their sponsors were running into financial difficulty. The American Baptist Missionary Union offered to take over the operation, and the LIM was glad to accept. In April 1887, on his expedition to rescue Emin Pasha, Henry Morton Stanley found when he reached Stanley Pool that the boats he had been promised were not available. He forced the LIM missionaries to lend him the Henry Reed.

He played college basketball for the University of Arizona and Chaminade University. Early life Born in Nioro, Mali to parents Hamidou and Sitan, Tangara grew up in the third-world surroundings of Bamako before eventually finding his way out thanks to basketball. One of ten siblings in a large African family, Tangara came to the United States in December 2000 where he enrolled at Mount Zion Christian Academy in Durham, North Carolina. There, he played basketball for the Warriors. As a junior in 2002‚Äì03, he averaged 18.0 points and 14.0 rebounds per game. During the summer of 2003, Tangara led Team Georgia Elite to the semi-finals of the AAU Super Showcase and was voted a top-five player at the NBA Camp, where he earned best defensive player honors. On November 16, 2003, Tangara signed a National Letter of Intent to play college basketball for the University of Arizona. As a senior in 2003‚Äì04, Tangara averaged 13.0 points, 15.0 rebounds and 4.0 blocks per game. College career After a promising high school career, Tangara joined the Arizona Wildcats for the 2004‚Äì05 season. During preseason, however, he injured his back which subsequently hindered his play during the first five games of the season. He was later ruled out for the rest of the season and applied for a medical hardship waiver, which allowed him to retain four years of college eligibility. Tangara returned to the Wildcats' line-up for the 2005‚Äì06 season as a redshirted freshman where he had a minor role in coach Lute Olson's rotation. In 21 games (no starts), he averaged 1.6 points and 1.0 rebounds per game. In his final two seasons at Arizona, Tangara played just 18 games and scored four total points, leading him to part ways with the Wildcats following the 2007‚Äì08 season to seek a professional career overseas or to play a final year of college in Division II, where he would be eligible immediately. He later graduated from Arizona in May 2008 with a bachelor's degree in science. In July 2008, Tangara transferred to Chaminade University where he went on to play for the Silverswords in the 25th annual EA Sports Maui Invitational. As a senior for Chaminade in 2008‚Äì09, Tangara averaged 14.4 points and 8.7 rebounds in 27 games as he earned first-team All-Pac West honors. Professional career After going undrafted in the 2009 NBA draft, Tangara was invited by the Milwaukee Bucks to try out for their Summer League team but was ultimately not chosen for the final team. In December 2009, he signed with Fath US de Rabat of Morocco for the rest of the 2009‚Äì10 season. In October 2010, Tangara signed with Estela Santander of Spain for the 2010‚Äì11 season. In January 2011, he left Estela and joined Al Jazeera of Libya before leaving them a month later due to unrest in the country. In April 2011, he returned to Spain and signed with Araberri for the rest of the 2010‚Äì11 season. In December 2011, Tangara signed with US Monastir of Tunisia but left three months later when he joined Al Jaysh Army SC of Qatar in March 2012. In September 2012, Tangara signed with Primeiro de Agosto of Angola but left two months later when he joined Libolo in November 2012 for the 2012 FIBA Africa Clubs Champions Cup. On November 1, 2014, Tangara was selected by the Bakersfield Jam in the sixth round of the 2014 NBA Development League draft. He was later waived by the Jam on November 13, 2014. International career Tangara first played for the Mali Under 18 national team in 2000 where he won bronze at the Under 18 Africa Cup, before joining the Mali senior team in 2007 where he competed in the All- Africa Games in Algeria.

Zoopoetics is not a minor event in poetry, nor is it limited to human spheres. Other species discover innovative forms of their bodily poiesis, through, at times, an attentiveness towards humans. Many disciplines have contributed to the radical revaluation of the animal in culture and society; zoopoetics further contributes through tracing the implications of Whitman‚Äôs insight, that animals, including humans, follow the ‚Äúsame old law‚Äù of a bodily poiesis.  Usage  Jacques Derrida first used the term in The Animal that Therefore I Am (an address first delivered in 1997), speaking of ‚ÄúKafka‚Äôs vast zoopoetics.‚Äù And so, in the broadest sense, zoopoetics suggests the presence of nonhuman animals within a text. In a 2008 dissertation, Christopher White establishes another facet of zoopoetics by conflating it with the term zoosemiotics (the sign-systems of nonhuman animals), and he uses both terms to explore the presence and sign- systems of animals in William Faulkner‚Äôs As I Lay Dying. Another facet of zoopoetics is explored in ‚ÄúZoopoetics: A Look at Cummings, Merwin, & the Expanding Field of Ecocriticism.‚Äù Here, zoopoetics is more of an approach that ‚Äúgravitates to the agency of nonhuman animals‚Äù within both the ecosphere and within texts. The notion of animal agency is defined by how nonhuman animals are imaginative, rhetorical, and cultural beings. The essay draws upon the well-known rhetorician George Kennedy, who published a controversial article in 1992: ‚ÄúA Hoot in the Dark: The Evolution of General Rhetoric.‚Äù In it, Kennedy argues that all animals, human and nonhuman, ‚Äúshare a ‚Äòdeep‚Äô universal rhetoric.‚Äù This rhetoric is not founded on sign-systems but rather upon what he calls the ‚Äúrhetorical energy‚Äù of the gestures that deliver those sign- systems. Animals (including humans) constantly navigate rhetorical situations by delivering gestures to an audience with a specific purpose. Kennedy‚Äôs article challenged one of the long-standing assumptions concerning the difference between humans and animals, for he sees language as less of a distinguishing mark of human exceptionality and more of a commonality given the evolutionary origin shared by many animals. (For a recapitulation of the history of the response to Kennedy's article, as well as a defense of the ideas within it, see Debra Hawhee's \\"Toward a Bestial Rhetoric.\\") Aaron Moe's book Zoopoetics: Animals and the Making of Poetry explores the zoopoetic dynamic in the poetry of Whitman, Cummings, Merwin, Hillman as well as several other poets. As with many literary terms, it is helpful to look at the term‚Äôs etymology. Zoopoetics, etymologically speaking, has to do with how animals (zoo) can be capable of creation, or of \\"making\\" (poesis). Zoopoetics is seen as the process by which animal rhetorics may contribute to the making and shaping of both a specific poem as well as the overall poetics of a given author.Moe, Aaron. (2012, March 21). \\"Zoopoetics Revisited\\" (blog post) One premise underlying zoopoetics is the notion that humans are not the only beings who dwell (in Heideggerian sense) on the earth. Nonhuman animals do as well. Some human poetry hints at the dwelling of the animal, but for obvious reasons, such an endeavor is fraught with challenges. Jacques Derrida articulates this challenge most clearly through his term limitrophy: thumb :Limitrophy is therefore my subject. Not just because it will concern what sprouts or grows at the limit, around the limit, by maintaining the limit, but also what feeds the limit, generates it, raises it, and complicates it. Everything I'll say will consist, certainly not in effacing the limit, but in multiplying its figures, in complicating, thickening, delinearizing, folding, and dividing the line precisely by making it increase and multiply. . . . [The limit] has an abyss: The discussion is worth undertaking once it is a matter of determining the number, form, sense, or structure, the foliated consistency, of this abyssal limit, these edges, this plural and repeatedly folded frontier. The limit between the human and the animal becomes its own infinite terrain within the text, but Derrida seems to have overlooked one crucial aspect. It is not just the human who strives to venture into the abyss of the animal‚Äîreaching with language and with gestures‚Äîfor animals also strive to venture into the abyss of the human through their gestures and the vocalizations embedded within those gestures. Stephanie Rowe demonstrates what this ebb and flow encounter may look like in a text. In her article, Rowe explores how the orangutang in Poe's story reaches into the abyss of the human, seeking to change the human space into a shared space. This occurs when the orangutang‚Äîa species whose culture is oft defined by grooming‚Äîtakes on the human ritual of shaving. His gestures are misunderstood, of course, which has morbid consequences. Zoopoetics, then, is an ebb and flow of energy between the human and the nonhuman. The human reaches into the abyss of the animal, but acknowledges the animals reach as well. Perhaps zoopoetics can best be experienced in a poetics that allows the gestures and vocalizations of nonhuman animals to permeate human language, through iconicity, thereby creating a shared space.  Animal texts  thumb Within literary studies, there is a movement toward a multiculturalism that includes the social networks of nonhuman animals. For this to happen, though, humans must take seriously the notion that animals enter into rhetorical situations, crafting their own texts, for audiences, with specific purposes. The last thirty years of studies in animal behavior have, in part, influenced the proliferation of video documentary of animals crafting such texts. For instance, Planet Earth captures several humpback whales coordinating efforts to surround krill with bubbles from their blowholes. As the video unfolds, viewers hear and witness the text the humpback whales craft. One can then infer that such behavior is learned, socially passed on from one generation of humpback to another. One can further infer that a single humpback, or a group of humpbacks, collectively had an innovative breakthrough in using the bubbles as a tool. This innovation had to be communicated to other humpbacks, and when this happens, the humpback enters into a rhetorical situation, relying on the text of song and gesture to communicate. Orca also craft texts. Ethologists have recognized that such texts help maintain group cohesion, and they may therefore exemplify how animal texts sustain nonhuman animal cultures. For a live feeds of orca vocalizations (and archives of past recordings) from the Puget Sound, listen to this hydrophone. A wide range of animals demonstrate similar crafting of texts, but to take this seriously, one must wrestle with the implications of how nonhuman animals enter rhetorical situations.

History Extra-vehicular activity (EVA), working outside the space vehicle, was one of the goals of the Gemini Program during the 1960s. The astronauts were trained in the ‚Äúzero gravity‚Äù condition by flying a parabolic trajectory in an aircraft that caused reduced gravity for thirty second intervals. Pioneers without sufficient training The Russian cosmonaut Alexei Leonov was the first to egress his vehicle while travelling in orbit above the Earth. Shortly after, Ed White, Gemini IV, was the first American astronaut to egress a vehicle while in space. These were demonstrations of a capability to get out of and back into the vehicle but included no EVA tasks. The next three flights to demonstrate an EVA capability were Gemini IX-A, X, and XI. Each of these flights exposed problems with performance of EVA tasks. Working in pressure suits while in the constant weightlessness of orbital spaceflight was more complex and difficult than had been anticipated. NASA determined that training for EVA tasks required further development.Barton C. Hacker and James M. Grimwood, On The Shoulders of Titans: A History of Project Gemini. NASA Special Publication-4203 1977 (p. 356 of original hardback publication). Origins of neutral buoyancy training In July 1966 the Gemini Program joined in a NASA Langley Research Center contract to include an evaluation of Gemini EVA tasks.Otto F. Trout, Jr., Harry L. Loats, Jr., and G. Samuel Mattingly \\"NASA Contract NAS1-4059 with supplemental agreements\\" , January 1966 The contractor, Environmental Research Associates of Randallstown, MD had already begun developing a neutral buoyancy simulation capability in 1964. This capability for pressure suited subjects was initially developed in 1964 by utilizing an indoor swimming pool at a private school (McDonogh School near Baltimore).Otto F. Trout, Jr., Harry L. Loats, Jr., and G. Samuel Mattingly \\"Water Immersion Technique of a Pressure-Suited Subject Under Balanced Gravity Conditions\\", 1964 Initially, these early underwater simulations were simply designed to test the ability of subjects to move about mock-up airlocks and weights were not attached to the subjects.Michael J. Neufeld and John B. Charles, \\"Practicing for space underwater: inventing neutral buoyancy training, 1963-1968.\\" ScienceDirect 39, no. 3-4 (2015): 149-150. Quickly, Environmental Research Associates' submerged testing evolved into proper neutral buoyancy simulation, featuring weighted subjects and numerous safety divers on hand during given sessions.Michael J. Neufeld and John B. Charles, \\"Practicing for space underwater: inventing neutral buoyancy training, 1963-1968.\\" ScienceDirect 39, no. 3-4 (2015): 151. First evaluation by astronauts Scott Carpenter was the first astronaut to evaluate the contractor's operation, in a \\"wet workshop\\" simulation. The task was to remove bolts while in a submerged simulated airlock. The bolt removal task was designed to create access to a spent S-IVB dome. Carpenter's evaluation of the simulation was favorable and NASA quickly provided mockups of Gemini vehicles and docking components to facilitate further development of EVA capabilities via neutral buoyancy training. Astronaut Gene Cernan first visited the McDonogh School indoor pool facility for post-mission evaluation of problems that he encountered during his Gemini IX-A EVA. NASA then modified the contract to include pre-mission training of Gemini XII astronaut, Buzz Aldrin. Astronaut Cernan also participated in this pre-mission training, as he was in a backup role to Aldrin as pilot of Gemini XII. Gemini XII EVA training Aldrin trained for the original Gemini XII EVA version which was then revised to eliminate the task of using a manned maneuvering unit. Aldrin returned to the McDonogh facility and trained for the final version of his EVA. NASA considered the flight EVA to be a total success, and Aldrin again returned to McDonogh to perform a post-mission evaluation of the EVA. The post-mission evaluation verified the value of using neutral buoyancy simulation training before attempting all of the EVA tasks while wearing a pressure suit and working in the hostile environment of space. Aldrin himself recognized some minor flaws of neutral buoyancy training, but described the method to have a \\"considerable advantage\\" over Keplerian trajectory aircraft.Reginald Machel, Summary of Gemini Extravehicular Activity.NASA Office of Technological Utilization, 1967: 7-35. Beyond Gemini After the successful EVAs in the Gemini XII mission, NASA constructed tanks for neutral buoyancy simulation: The Water Immersion Facility at the Manned Spacecraft Center and the Neutral Buoyancy Simulator at Marshall Space Flight Center. Following use of those facilities during the Apollo and Skylab programs, NASA eventually constructed the Weightless Environment Training Facility at the Manned Spacecraft Center in Houston and later the Neutral Buoyancy Laboratory, where Shuttle and Space Station astronauts are trained in neutral buoyancy. Astronauts and cosmonauts also train at the Yuri Gagarin Cosmonaut Training Center near Moscow. These accomplishments were summarized in a feature article published by the Baltimore Sun newspaper in 2009.Frank D. Roylance \\"Historic Mark\\", The Baltimore Sun July 19, 2009 In September 2011, the Gemini XLV Symposium included a review of these accomplishments by G. Samuel Mattingly and featured remarks by astronauts Richard Gordon, Tom Jones, and Buzz Aldrin. Rescuing Skylab During the Skylab 2 mission, astronauts Conrad and Kerwin successfully opened a solar panel that had not automatically deployed after launch. To perform this task, the astronauts trained underwater in the Neutral Buoyancy Simulator at the Marshall Space Flight Center. However, due to differences between the design of the mock-up used for training and what they found at Skylab, the astronauts used makeshift tools and redesigned how they would accomplish the task while they were in outer space.David J. Shayler, FBIS, Walking in Space, 2004, p. 213, Praxis Publishing Ltd. Characteristics A comparison of the same task during astronaut Aldrin's Gemini XII EVA Need for simulation Astronauts rehearse extra-vehicular activity tasks in underwater neutral buoyancy before attempting those tasks in space to gain an understanding that they cannot use their weight to provide a force and that they may move or reposition themselves if they provide a propulsive force in any vector, either planned or inadvertent. Articles describing neutral buoyancy simulation generally point out that the astronaut's spacesuit is made neutrally buoyant but that the astronaut still feels gravity inside the spacesuit so the fit of the suit is very important, and that moving around in water, a viscous fluid, creates drag that is not present in EVA.G. Samuel Mattingly, with John B. Charles, personal history of underwater neutral buoyancy simulation\\". The Space Review, February 4, 2013. Normal gravity experience The main purpose for an astronaut to egress the vehicle and go EVA is often to provide a force to push, pull, crank, squeeze or transport an object. While living in normal earth gravity people do not generally recognize the use of their weight to provide a force. The simple task of opening or closing a door, for example, is complicated when an individual is standing on a slick sheet of ice, so the individual's weight does not provide a frictional coupling to the ground. The application of force is an action requiring a reaction and if the individual's feet are slipping, the force application is limited or non-existent. The individual feels gravity standing on the ice but they cannot use their weight to provide traction and they cannot shift their weight to provide force in a horizontal vector so they cannot force the door. Giving the door a shove and sliding back is using mass inertia and not using the individual's weight. Mass inertia can also be used during EVA, but doing so in a pressure suit can produce unintended results. Comparison As stated above (in Need for simulation), the astronaut feels gravity inside the pressurized suit while immersed in water. However the astronaut-spacesuit combination, when properly balanced in neutral buoyancy as when in EVA, is weightless so the astronaut is, similar to standing on ice, unable to use weight to provide a force in any vector. The vector of any force is similar, if not exactly the same in EVA and in neutral buoyancy. The magnitude of the force, if static, is very similar and if dynamic is still similar although the force and vector used in moving large objects must be carefully studied and planned to make the simulation realistic. It is the inability to use weight in any vector in EVA coupled with the encumbrance of the pressure suit that makes task performance difficult. Drag Drag is the other major concern identified in articles on neutral buoyancy simulation. Any motion in the water is subject to drag and requires a little more time (seconds) and a little more force (ounces) to compensate for drag compared to the same motion in EVA. Early in the history of neutral buoyancy simulation there was consideration of providing the immersed astronaut with small motors to compensate for water drag, but this was soon dismissed as an unnecessary complication. Only a small percentage of time is spent in translating to a new location, usually at low velocity, generally less than 6 inches per second. Even such low velocities are subject to drag but it becomes difficult to measure amid the minor currents in the water caused by other astronauts, divers and the water circulation system that add to or subtract from drag. Task performance In EVA, most work is done slowly, carefully and methodically not because of the neutral buoyancy training but because that is how a task must be performed by a pressurized astronaut in weightlessness. It takes more force to accelerate a mass to a higher velocity, and then to slow the mass back down, than to move it slowly to its destination. It is also easier to control its movement if it is moving slowly. Thus, the drag of water on movement in neutral buoyancy simply necessitates a slowness of movement that is also appropriate to spaceflight. Visual differences There are other less obvious but important features that must be considered in underwater EVA training, such as the visual differences due to refraction at the air-water interface at the helmet's visor and position or attitude in the suit relative to the task. The personnel at the Neutral Buoyancy Laboratory in Houston plan and evaluate their simulations meticulously. Experienced EVA astronauts observing a simulation can advise as to how realistic is the task performance and recommend modifications. Usefulness to EVA astronauts Learning and rehearsing an EVA task in neutral buoyancy gives an astronaut or EVA specialist confidence that the planned task may be accomplished. The timeline developed for task performance is similar to the time required in EVA. In general, it is considered that a task performed and practiced in neutral buoyancy simulation can also be performed in EVA. Neutral buoyancy, properly planned and conducted, works because it is a realistic simulation of the physical requirements of performing a task in EVA. Comparison with reduced gravity aircraft The other major method used to simulate microgravity is flight in a reduced gravity aircraft (a so-called \\"vomit comet\\"), an aircraft which performs a number of parabolic climbs and descents to give its occupants the sensation of zero gravity. Reduced-gravity aircraft training avoids neutral-buoyancy training's drag problem (trainees are surrounded by air rather than water), but instead faces a severe time limitation: periods of sustained weightlessness are limited to around 25 seconds, interspersed with periods of acceleration of around 2 g as the aircraft pulls out of its dive and readies for the next run. This is unsuitable for practicing EVAs, which usually last several hours.

Life A younger brother of Thomas Duffus Hardy, he was born in Jamaica on 6 July 1807 and came to England at the same time as his brother, in 1811. He was educated at Fotheringhay and later at Boulogne. In February 1823, he obtained an appointment at the Tower of London, under Samuel Lysons, similar to the one his brother had obtained in 1819: Lysons was their uncle. Seven years later he was offered and accepted the post of keeper of the records of the Duchy of Lancaster. In 1839 he was elected a fellow of the Society of Antiquaries. He had also a private practice in antiquarian, legal, and genealogical inquiries, and made a reputation: he was consulted in numerous disputes on foreshore fishery and common rights, and was well known for applications made to the House of Lords for the restoration of peerages in abeyance. While at the Duchy of Lancaster he worked on arranging the muniments. In 1868 Queen Victoria decided to present the duchy records to the nation, and incorporate them with the public archives. Hardy was then transferred to the Public Record Office and appointed an assistant-keeper in there. In 1878, on the death of his brother, Sir George Jessel offered him the post of deputy-keeper, which he held for eight years. He resigned, in poor health, on 27 January 1886. Hardy was placed on the Historical Manuscripts Commission on 12 July 1878, and knighted at Osborne House on 31 December 1883. He died on 17 March 1887. Works Results of his work appeared in the reports of the Public Record Office. Besides the calendars to the Duchy of Lancaster records, he compiled, in 1845, Charters of Duchy of Lancaster, with the major documents on the formation of the Duchy and historical introduction. During his time of office as deputy-keeper he drew up a scheme for reorganising the department, which was carried into effect. He was also instrumental in starting the Commission for the destruction of valueless documents.

Background One of seven children, Steimel was born to George Hubert Steimel (1893-1980) and the former Josephine Zosso (1898-1986) in Running Lake Township near Pocahontas in Randolph County in northeastern Arkansas. He was educated as a journalist at Arkansas State University in Jonesboro. In 1951, he joined the staff in Baton Rouge of the nonpartisan think-tank, the Public Affairs Research Council, which has proposed various \\"good government\\" reforms over many decades within Louisiana. He was the PAR executive director from 1954 to 1975. He had two surviving sisters, Margaret Steimel Baltz and husband, Bernard, of Pocohontas, Arkansas, and Viola S. Jansen of St. Louis, Missouri. He was predeceased by a brother and three other sisters. Public Affairs Research Council In 1970, PAR director Steimel questioned why Louisiana voters \\"seem to have an unusually high tolerance for abuse of public office\\" as well as a proclivity toward gambling. He specifically criticized the existence of pinball machines, which he claimed attract primarily the young and the poor: \\"Very few rich people ever play the pinball machine.\\"\\"Steimel Says State People Have Tolerance for Abuse\\", Minden Press- Herald, October 21, 1970, p. 1 At the time, Steimel found that Louisiana had an \\"inadequate supply of highly skilled labor.\\" He questioned economic policies of the Louisiana legislature, which in 1970 raised sales taxes from 2 to 3 cents per dollar to fund increases in teacher pay. In 1974, Steimel advanced arguments both pro and con in regard to the new Louisiana Constitution approved by voters. Governor Edwin Edwards took Steimel's negative points to mean that Steimel really opposed the Constitution. Edwards called Steimel \\"a carpetbagger from Arkansas.\\"\\"PAR Director Here as Lions Speaker,\\" Minden Press-Herald, April 10, 1974, p. 1. In 1986, Steimel declared Governor Edwin Edwards' proposal to legalize casino gambling, which was eventually enacted, \\"crazy\\" and likened the issue to a tax plan advanced in 1959 by then Governor Earl Kemp Long, who was for a time confined to a mental institution when questions arose about his fitness to serve in office. Steimel said that gambling would never produce the 100,000 jobs and $250 million in state revenues that Edwards had forecast.\\"Steimel calls gambling 'crazy'\\", Minden Press-Herald, January 21, 1986, p. 1. In 1972, Steimel challenged the large fees received by inheritance tax attorneys in Louisiana and instead proposed that the office of the state revenue collector handle such matters. Steimel proposed that the state establish a combination of sales, income, and property taxes to replace its past reliance on petroleum and natural gas levies, which began to decline as a share of state revenues in the early 1970s.\\"Mandate for Change: PAR Meeting Theme\\", Minden Press-Herald, April 7, 1972, p. 1. Jim Brandt, a former PAR executive director, said that Steimel took the formerly small organization and \\"built it into a statewide powerhouse. He went on to LABI and did the same there. Originally a Democrat, Steimel over the years moved steadily toward support of the more conservative candidates, often within the Republican Party. LABI director As the director of LABI, Steimel often sparred with the Democrat Victor Bussie, long- term president of the Louisiana AFL-CIO. The two clashed over right-to-work legislation which Steimel had championed through the Louisiana State Legislature in the summer of 1976. In the afterglow of the victory by the right-to-work forces, the public relations executive Jim Leslie of Shreveport was assassinated in a motel parking lot in Baton Rouge, but Leslie's still unsolved murder is not believed to have been related to wrangling over right- to-work but instead a dispute with the Shreveport Public Works Commissioner George W. D'Artois. In 1976, Steimel supported U.S. President Gerald R. Ford, Jr., in the campaign against the Democrat Jimmy Carter, whom Steimel claimed favored the repeal of Section 14B of the Taft Hartley Act, which permits states to adopt right-to-work laws. More than twenty states have adopted such legislation.Minden Press-Herald, September 17, 1976, p. 1. In 1989, however, Steimel and Bussie united to support Republican John S. Treen, older brother of former Governor David C. Treen, in a special election for the District 81 seat in the Louisiana House of Representatives, vacated by Charles Cusimano, who became a state district judge. Treen narrowly lost the race to David Duke, then of Jefferson Parish, a former grand wizard of the Ku Klux Klan. Duke later ran for the U.S. Senate and for governor in consecutive years in races which seemed to hamper the growth of the state Louisiana Republican Party. In 1982, Steimel voiced immediate opposition to Governor Treen's proposed $450 million Coastal Wetlands Environmental Levy tax on petroleum and natural gas and did so without even consulting his own board.\\"Steimel makes faux pas\\", Minden Press-Herald, May 10, 1982, p. 3 Opposed by LABI and many conservative lawmakers, such as B.F.

Steimel has long been critical of excessive tax burdens on Louisiana businesses. When the state lost 139,000 jobs in mining, construction, and manufacturing between 1981 and 1986, Steimel noted: > Louisiana possesses such a richness in natural resources that it should > clearly be one of the most attractive, competitive states in the nation for > economic growth.

In 1987, Steimel announced opposition to mandatory collective bargaining for Louisiana teachers, a process which he maintained would remove the role of the public from the negotiation of educational labor contracts. Collective bargaining is voluntary on the part of each school district within Louisiana. Steimel voiced support for teacher salary increases\\"LA at bottom of teacher pay list\\", Minden Press-Herald, October 30, 1986, p. 1 but opposed other demands from the teacher associations.\\"Steimel blasts Tauzin's stand on teacher unions\\", Minden Press-Herald, September 22, 1987. In the summer of 1987, Steimel endorsed a $30 million reduction in unemployment compensation payments. At the time Louisiana employers owed $1 billion to the unemployment fund, a situation Steimel termed another major deterrent to economic growth and a contributing factor to the high rate of unemployment in the state, which was 12.5 percent in 1986.\\"Sixth time in '86, LA No. 1 in joblessness\\", Minden Press-Herald, October 28, 1986, p. 1 According to Steimel, Louisiana employers were then paying $234 more per year per employee into the unemployment fund than were employers in competing southern states. The reduction approved by the legislature brought Louisiana in line with unemployment payments made by employers in neighboring states.\\"A breather for business\\", Minden Press- Herald, July 5, 1987, p. 2. Steimel blamed environmental problems not on business but poor public policies regarding solid waste disposal and sewage treatment. He cited pesticide runoff from the American Midwest as a major pollutant of streams in Louisiana. Steimel once cited the cartoon character Pogo by Walt Kelly that, in reference to the environment, \\"the enemy is us.\\"\\"The environmental enemy is us,\\" Minden Press-Herald, February 3, 1988, p. 1. Steimel encouraged the Democrat-turned-Republican Jock Scott of Alexandria, an outgoing member of the state House, to run in 1987 for the Louisiana State Senate, a position which Scott subsequently lost to the Democrat businessman Joe McPherson of Rapides Parish, who held the Senate seat until 2012. One of the lawmakers generally supportive of LABI, Ron Gomez, a Democrat from Lafayette, in 1986 secured the \\"Most Valuable Player to Business\\" designation. Despite his pro-business voting record, Gomez had criticized Steimel for unproductive negativity toward the state's educational structure.Ron Gomez, My Name Is Ron, And I Am a Recovering Legislator: Memoirs of a Louisiana State Representative, Lafayette, Louisiana: Zemog Publishing, 2000, p. 165. Everett Doerge, than an assistant superintendent of schools in Webster Parish in north Louisiana and later a Democratic member of the Louisiana House, accused Steimel and LABI of seeking to \\"destroy\\" public education. In a 1987 reply letter to Doerge published by the Minden Press-Herald, Steimel described the veteran educator as \\"a perfect example of why we can never change our present [educational] system. ...[His] reaction and behavior we have come to expect from many in the educational establishment who are more interested in protecting the status quo and jobs, rather than educating children\\".Edward J. Steimel, \\"In response to Everett Doerge\\", Minden Press-Herald, June 7, 1987, p. 2A. In one of his 1988 columns, Steimel aimed his pen at the United States Congress and the liberal majority elected in 1986 in the last two years of the administration of U.S. President Ronald W. Reagan. Steimel objected to an increase in the minimum wage, a measure which he said would \\"wreak havoc with the very individuals it is designed to help most -- new entrants into the work force and new minority workers in particular.\\" He called the 1988 legislative session the \\"John Galt Congress\\", borrowing from Ayn Rand's novel Atlas Shrugged, in which uninformed people merely shrug their shoulders and ask \\"Who is John Galt\\"?\\" whenever they are questioned about the grip of expanded government on their lives and liberty.\\"The John Galt Congress\\", Minden Press- Herald, August 10, 1988, p. 2 A few days later, Steimel wrote that in the United States \\"political power usually gravitates to where public money is most available. ... We need our own money spent in our own community for things we need or want to improve our quality of life.\\"\\"Your responsibility\\", Minden Press-Herald, August 16, 1988, p. 2. The LABI address is 3113 Valley Creek Drive, Baton Rouge, LA 70898-0258. The association was headed from 1989 to 2013 by the executive director, Daniel Leo \\"Dan\\" Juneau (born June 1946), a Libertarian. Juneau's successor as executive director is Stephen Michael Waguespack (born February 1974) of Baton Rouge, a Republican who was once the chief of staff to then Governor Bobby Jindal. Later years From 1989 to 2006, Steimel was the director of development of the Louisiana State University College of Engineering. During his tenure in that position, Steimel worked to obtain more than $58 million in private funds from industry and alumni. Through his efforts, LSU gained more than 50 scholarships, 106 professorships, and 15 special chairs. The Edward J. Steimel Staff Excellence Award is presented annually to employees of the LSU Engineering Department. Steimel was married to the former Mary Welch (1922-1996), who had served as a second lieutenant in the United States Army Air Corps during World War II. The couple had one child, Phyllis Susanne Steimel, who died of cerebral palsy. Mary could have no more children, and the couple adopted three others, Mary Jo Steimel O'Neal and husband, Jon, of Denham Springs in Livingston Parish; Edward Steimel, Jr., and wife, Sarah Sanders, and George Frederick Steimel and wife, Mary Cardini, both couples from Baton Rouge. For three decades Steimel was the principal spokesperson and first fundraiser for the Baton Rouge Cerebral Palsy Center, since known as the McMains Children's Developmental Center. In 1996, no longer the LABI executive director, Steimel supported the conservative Democrat-turned-Republican Woody Jenkins for the U.S. Senate in a race narrowly lost in a disputed vote to the Democrat Mary Landrieu, who still holds the position. He also contributed to the reelection of then U.S. Representative Richard H. Baker of Baton Rouge. In 2007, Steimel worked for the election of Republican Bobby Jindal as governor. Thereafter like the statewide radio commentator, Moon Griffon, Steimel withdrew his support for Jindal, saying that the governor was insufficiently conservative on fiscal matters, having vacillated over a large legislative pay hike, which Jindal subsequently withdrew. Steimel holds an honorary Doctor of Laws degree from Centenary College in Shreveport. He died at the House of Grace in Denham Springs in the spring of 2016 at the age of ninety-four. Steimel, his wife Mary, and daughter Phyllis are interred in Baton Rouge at Greenoaks Memorial Park. Conservative radio talk show host Moon Griffon praised Steimel's activities as a long-term government watchdog and noted that Steimel's death came just three months after the passing of another constitutional advocate, C.B. Forgotston.The Moon Griffon Show, April 11, 2016.

Born in Bristol, Clifford was the daughter of the Reverend J. B. Clifford, vicar of Cotham Church. Her mother died while Mary was still young, and as the eldest child, she took on much of the responsibility for raising her younger siblings. They included Edward, later to become a noted artist, and Alfred, who served as Bishop of Lucknow. Later, she began voluntary social work in Cotham. The 1875 election of Martha Merington to a Board of Guardians had proven that women were eligible to serve on these bodies. Clifford and two other women stood for the Barton Regis Board of Guardians in 1882, and all three were elected. Clifford soon became the most prominent woman serving on a Board of Guardians, and developed a widely-adopted scheme for the fostering of orphans. She also believed that many orphans would be better off if they were moved to Canada, and developed an emigration scheme with Mark Whitwill. She championed reductions in the power of abusive parents over their children, which were passed into law in 1889. Due to Clifford's prominence, she was co-opted to the Central Committee of Poor Law Conferences, serving on it for twelve years. In 1898, the Barton Regis Board was absorbed into the Bristol Board of Guardians, and Clifford continued to win election to the larger body. Clifford was a founder member of the National Union of Women Workers (NUWW), and served as its president from 1903 to 1905. She was highly religious, and expressed concern that the organisation worked with bodies in other countries which did not share her religious views, but was satisfied that most leaders of the NUWW were Anglicans. She frequently attended and spoke at the Church Congress, and her 1899 speech on missionary work overseas was widely reported. Clifford was known for wearing a hooded bonnet and a long cloak, considered old-fashioned at the time, and this created a myth that she was a Quaker. Clifford retired from the Bristol Board of Guardians in 1907, due to poor health, but she lived a further twelve years.

It houses the James L. Autry House, which was built in 1921 by the Episcopal Church as a community center for the university. A temporary community center was built on the location (at 6265 Main Blvd.) in 1919 by Rev. Harris Masterson, Jr., and replaced in 1921 with a permanent building designed by architects Cram & Ferguson and William Ward Watkin. Due to the lack of public gathering areas at Rice University before the opening of the Fondren Library in 1949, and aided by the cheap food served by the Autry House's cafeteria, it became the university's de facto community center for several decades. A student chapel was built next door in 1927, quickly expanding into a full-fledged church, Palmer Memorial Episcopal Church, in 1929. As Rice University's campus added a number of community facilities in the 1940s and 1950s that rendered those at Autry House redundant, the house began outreach towards students and employees at the Texas Medical Center, and continued to operate a cafeteria. The house was renovated in the 1970s, and added an art gallery focusing on the work of student artists; in the 1980s, it was opened to a number of community groups, such as the Houston Youth Chorus and the American Cancer Society. The house was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1984. In 2001, the house was merged administratively and architecturally with Palmer Memorial Episcopal Church: a \\"bridge building\\" was built connecting the two buildings, and the church took over operation and maintenance of the house. The house was listed on the National Register of Historic Places within \\"Edward Albert Palmer Memorial Chapel and Autry House\\" in 1984.

History The house was built as part of the Houston Heights neighborhood. It became the home of the Mayor of Houston Heights, David Barker in 1910. Barker was very active in civic affairs adding to six years as Mayor of Houston Heights, with eight years serving the city of Houston and another eight years for Harris county. He advocated for good paved roads, assisted in property acquisition for and construction of schools, continuing to appraise school properties on a pro bono basis after retiring. Houston Heights passed a dry ordinance during Barker's tenure as mayor in 1912, eight years before Prohibition, which remains in effect. The historical significance of the house is due to its association with Barker. Building The two story, square, wood frame, clapboard house is located at 121 East 16th Street at the corner with Harvard Street. The house is built on brick piers with latticework between them. The hip roof has a central dormer and an attached porch wraps the south and east sides.

This designation became effective on 3 January 2007. the Borgstrom House is a designated Landmark of the City of Houston within the Houston Heights Historic District East and is subject to the city's Historic Presevation Ordinance. Building The architectural style is listed as Stick/Eastlake Queen Anne. The one story cottage has an L-shaped plan with projecting gable end bay. Construction is wood frame with clapboard siding on brick piers. The hip roof is built of diamond shaped composite shingles with square and fishtail shingles on the gable. An attached porch has turned posts, friezes and balustrades with square members. All windows have shutters. The building's historic significance is as an example of the architecture typical of cottages built in the early development of the Houston Heights. the building was being maintained as a historic home by the owners and had not been inappropriately modified.

Seligman & Co., that played a leading role in the financing and construction of the Panama Canal. Owing to his commercial success, Underhill was a collector of art and musical instruments, including many engravings, etchings, and lithographs of noted European and American artists. Underhill was an amateur musician and acquired an Antonio Stradivari violin of 1732 called the \\"Red Diamond.\\" Underhill was also 4th President of the Underhill Society of America. Biography Francis Jay Underhill was born April 30, 1863, in Chelsea, Massachusetts. In 1880 he worked as a clerk in the Blackstone National Bank in Boston, Massachusetts, and later in Chelsea. In 1881 he moved to Buffalo, New York, and worked for the Standard Oil Company. While in Buffalo, Underhill married Eliza Corning Otto. After working for Standard Oil for several years, he struck out on his own in business as a manufacturer and wholesale dealer of pine and hardwood lumber between 1885 and 1900, under the name F.J. Underhill & Co. He continued in this role until around February 2, 1898. Facing financial difficulties, he relocated to New York City and became engaged in banking with Fisk & Robinson and later with J. & W. Seligman & Co. He was a delegate to the American Convention of Bankers held in New Orleans, Louisiana, in 1902, reflecting his status. Francis Jay Underhill and his wife had one child, Helen Underhill, who was born on March 9, 1890, in Buffalo, New York, and died as a toddler on June 18, 1892. Following the death of his first wife in 1919, Underhill married his Hendrika Charlotte de Gee (18 Dec 1887-17 Apr 1985) of The Hague ('s-Gravenhage), The Netherlands, on October 17, 1928. Hendrika was the daughter of Charles Isaac de Gee and Sara Anthonetta (de Pril) de Gee of The Hague, The Netherlands. Underhill and Hendrika married in London at St. Mary Abbots, Kensington on High Street. Letters that Francis Jay Underhill wrote to Irving Underhill are held by the Underhill Society of America. They present a travelogue of places he visited in Europe leading to his wedding in London. A May 25, 1928 postcard was sent from London, a July 10 letter from The Hague, and an October 12, 1928 letter from London. These letters also recounted Taylor Underhill's search in England and Holland for material pertaining to the Underhill family. Underhill was a member of Grace Church, Broadway and Tenth Street in Manhattan, the Holland Society, Union League Club, Saint Nicholas Society in the City of New York, New England Historical and Genealogical Society, Garden City Golf Club, and Saint Andrews Golf Club. Participation in Underhill Society of America In 1900 he was on the committee that helped to plan the 8th reunion of the Underhill Society of America that met in Locust Valley, New York. In his capacity as Vice-President of the Underhill Society of America, he was actively involved in efforts to erect a memorial in honor of Captain John Underhill at the Underhill Burying Ground, succeeding in 1907. When the monument was formally dedicated on July 11, 1908, Francis Jay Underhill was responsible for giving the speech of acceptance. This was just prior to the formal comments delivered by President Theodore Roosevelt. Underhill served as 4th President of the Underhill Society of America between 1924 and 1932. He also worked with David Harris Underhill to compile materials for The Underhill Burying Ground. These two men compiled and edited materials for The Underhill Burying Ground: An account of a Parcel of Land situate at Locust Valley, Long Island, New York, deeded by the Matinecock Indians, February twentieth, sixteen hundred and sixty-seven, to Captain John Underhill, for Meritorious Service and known as the Underhill Burying Ground. This book was published in 1926. Between 1927 and 1930, Underhill worked with other descendants, s among those people, including William Wilson Underhill, E. Steward Underhill, Willard Underhill Taylor, and Myron Charles Taylor, to commission Henry C. Shelley in writing a book, John Underhill: Captain of New England New Netherland. This book was eventually published in 1932. A separate work was commissioned and written by John H. Morrison and entitled The Underhills of Warwickshire. This book by Morrison was published contemporaneously with Shelley's work. Death and bequests Underhill died May 21, 1938, at his residence at 129 Columbia Heights. Brooklyn, New York. Upon his death instructions were provided to give his widow, Henriette Charlotte of Scheveningen, Holland, $20,000 in trust for life. For his housekeeper, Mary Ewel, who resided at 129 Columbia Heights, he left a trust fund of $10,000. Janette Corning Otto of Buffalo, sister of his first deceased wife, received a $4,000 trust fund. He left $2,000 to the Children's Hospital of Buffalo and $1,000 in trust to provide a perpetual fund for toys for the Christmas Manger Service of Grace Church, Manhattan. Trust funds of $3,000 each were bequeathed to nieces, Helen Sampson Fish of Germantown, Pennsylvania, and Elizabeth F. Cook of Haddonfield, New Jersey, and to Mrs. Johanna Sandstand of Bornholm, Denmark. The Library of the Late Francis Jay Underhill was published in catalog format following his death and numbered over 52 pages. From his library, 217 volumes, including a 48-volume set of the works of Sir Walter Scott, found their way to the Boston Public Library. Owing to his commercial success, Underhill was also a collector of antiques and art objects. Following his death, his estate gave many items to the Boston Museum of Fine Arts. Two violins, one by Antonio Stradivari (1732), known as the \\"Red Diamond,\\" were also donated to the Boston Museum of Fine Arts. Underhill also left an estate of more than $10,000 in personal property, which was given to the president and fellows of Harvard College.

On its own, the I/O automaton model contains a very basic structure that enables it to model various types of distributed systems. To describe specific types of asynchronous systems, additional structure must be added to this basic model. The model presents an explicit method for describing and reasoning about system components such as processes and message channels that interact with one another, operating at arbitrary relative speeds. The I/O automata were first introduced by Nancy A. Lynch and Mark R. Tuttle in \\"Hierarchical correctness proofs for distributed algorithms\\", 1987. \\"An I/O automaton models a distributed system component that can interact with other system components. It is a simple type of state machine in which the transitions are associated with named actions.\\" There are three types of actions: input, output, and internal actions. The automaton uses its input and output actions to communicate with its environment, whereas the internal actions are only visible to the automaton itself. Unlike internal and output actions that are selected and carried out by the automaton, the input actions ‚Äì which simply arrive from the environment - are not under automaton's control.  Examples  I/O automata can be used to model individual components of a distributed system, such as a process, a message channel in a message passing system, or a shared data structure in a shared memory systems.  Process I/O automaton  right Figure 1 depicts an example of an I/O automaton for a process in an asynchronous message-passing distributed system. In this setting, process Pi communicates with other processes by using a message passing system. Its output actions are of the form send(m)i,j, which represents process Pi sending a message with contents m to process Pj. The input actions are of form receive(m)k,i, representing the receipt of message with contents m by process Pi from process Pk. (The internal actions of Pi, which would correspond to the algorithm that the process is running are not shown.)  FIFO message channel  right A message channel can also be modeled by an I/O automaton. Figure 2 illustrates a typical unidirectional FIFO channel automaton, named Ci,j. It has input actions of the form send(m)i,j, and output actions of the form receive(m)i,j. Each message m may contain 0 or 1 (m ‚àà {0,1}). The state of the automaton stores a FIFO queue of all messages that have been sent but not yet received. In a typical distributed system where both process automata and communication channel automata exist, they are composed in a way that output actions of one automaton are matched and executed with identically-named input actions of the other automata. For example, consider a system composed of two process, Pi and Pj, and a communication channel Ci,j from process Pi to process Pj. In this setting, process Pi executes the output action send(m)i,j, if and only if channel Ci,j also executes its send(m)i,j input action.  Atomic read/write register  right Figure 3 illustrates an atomic read/write register I/O automaton in a shared memory system with two processes, P1 and P2. The value V stored in the register is of type integer (V ‚àà Z). The state of the automaton stores this value. Input actions consist of writei(V), which represents process Pi requesting to write a value V to the register (where i ‚àà {1,2} and V ‚àà Z), and readi, which corresponds to a process Pi requesting to read the value currently stored in the register. The output action acki is used to inform process Pi that the write request has successfully completed. The output action Vi represents the value V being returned as a response to a read request by process Pi. The automaton also includes internal actions perform_Write(V), which writes the value V to the register (by updating the state of the automaton), and perform_Read, which is used to read the value V stored in the state. (These internal actions are not shown in Figure 3.)  Formal specification  An I/O automaton A, or simply an automaton, comprises five components: * sig(A) * states(A) * start(A) * trans(A) * tasks(A) These five components are described below.  Signature  The initial step in formalization of an I/O automaton A is the definition of its signature, sig(A). A signature S describes the I/O automaton's actions using three disjoint sets of actions: # in(S): input actions, # out(S): output actions, and # int(S): internal actions. Based on the above formalization of input, output and internal actions, it is possible to define the following objects. * ext(S): the external actions, defined as in(S) ‚à™ out(S) * local(S): the locally controlled actions, defined as out(S) ‚à™ int(S) * extsig(S): the external signature, defined as (in(S), out(S), √∏) * acts(S) is defined as the set of all the actions of signature S.  States  The set of states of automaton A, denoted states(A), need not be finite. This is a significant generalization of the usual notion of finite automata, as it enables modeling systems with unbounded data structures like counters and unbounded length queues. The set of start states (also known as initial states) is a non-empty subset of states. Multiple start states are allowed so that some input information can be included in the start states.  Transition relation  The state-transition relation of automaton A is denoted trans(A) ‚äÜ states(A) √ó acts(sig(A)) √ó states(A). It satisfies the property that \\"for every state s and every input action œÄ, there is a transition (s, œÄ, s') ‚àà trans(A).\\" A transition, also known as a step of I/O automaton A, is defined as an element (s, œÄ, s') of trans(A). An input transition refers to a transition (s, œÄ, s') when œÄ is an input action, output transition indicates a transition (s, œÄ, s') when œÄ is an output action and so on. For any state s and action œÄ, if the I/O automaton A has some transition of the form (s, œÄ, s'), then œÄ is said to be enabled in s. I/O automata are described as input-enabled because all input actions are required to be enabled in every state. A quiescent state s is defined as a state where only input actions are enabled.  Tasks  The fifth component of the I/O automaton A, tasks (A), is a task partition, defined as an equivalence relation on locally controlled actions of A, which has at most countably many equivalence classes. Informally, the task partition tasks(A), represents an abstract description of \\"tasks,\\" or \\"threads of control,\\" within A. This partition is used to define fairness conditions on an execution of the automaton. These conditions require the automaton to continue giving fair turns to each of its tasks during its execution. This is particularly helpful when modelling a system component that performs multiple jobs. For instance, a component that participates in an ongoing algorithm while periodically reporting status information to its environment simultaneously would have two tasks. The partition is also useful when several automata are composed (to produce a larger system automaton) when specifying that all the automata in the composition continue to take steps in the composed system.  Example: Formal definition of channel I/O automaton  As described above, Ci,j is an example of I/O automaton that represents a unidirectional FIFO channel from process Pi to process Pj. Let m be a binary message: m ‚àà {0,1}. The automaton Ci,j can be formally defined as follows. Signature: sig(Ci,j) specifies that the automaton has two kinds of actions: * An input action of (Ci,j) is of the form send(m)i,j, where m ‚àà {0,1}. * An output action of (Ci,j) is of the form receive(m)i,j, where m ‚àà{0,1}. Intuitively, the action send(m)i,j indicates that a message m has entered the channel when it is sent by process Pi and the action receive(m)i,j indicates that a message m has left the channel when it is delivered to process Pj. States: states(Ci,j) is the set of all finite sequences of elements m ‚àà {0,1}. Intuitively, the state represents the sequence of messages currently en route from the sender, process Pi, to the receiver, process Pj, in the order they were sent. start(Ci,j), representing the initial states of the queue, contains only the empty sequence. Transitions The transition relation can be modelled in a precondition-effect style, where all the transitions that include each specific type of action are grouped into a single piece of code. In this code, the conditions which must be satisfied before allowing an action to occur, are formalized as a predicate on the pre-state s, which is the state before the action occurs. Consequent changes to the state that result from the execution of the action are coded in the form of a simple program. This program is executed indivisibly, as a single transition. If this program is applied to the state s, the new state s' results. The transitions of Ci,j are described as: for send(m)i,j: * Precondition: None * Effect: m is added to the end of the sequence stored in the state (where m ‚àà {1,0}) for receive(m)i,j: * Precondition: m is the first element in the sequence stored in the state (where m ‚àà {1,0}) * Effect: remove the first element of the sequence stored in the state Intuitively, the send action can be executed any time; it causes the addition of the message m to the end of the queue of messages in che channel. The receive action removes and returns the first element of the queue. Tasks tasks(Ci,j), represents a task partition that groups together all actions of form receive into a single task. Intuitively, handing over messages to process Pj is considered as a single task. \`{receive(m)i,j : m ‚àà {0,1}}\`.  Execution and trace   Execution  In a run of an automaton, a string is generated that describes the behaviour of the component the automaton models. \\"An execution fragment of I/O Automaton A is either * a finite sequence, s0, œÄ1, s1, œÄ2,... , œÄr, sr, or * an infinite sequence, s0, œÄ1, s1,œÄ2,...,œÄr,sr,..., of alternating states and actions of A such that (sk, œÄk+1, sk+1) is a transition of A for every k ‚â• 0.\\" A finite sequence must terminate with a state. An execution is defined as an execution fragment that begins with start state. The set of executions of A is represented by execs(A). A reachable state in I/O automaton A is the final state of a finite execution of A. Assume Œ± is a finite execution fragment of A ending with state sf. Assume further that Œ±' is any execution fragment of A that begins with sf, the last state of Œ±. In this case, the sequence produced by concatenating Œ± and Œ±', and eliminating the duplicate occurrence of sf, the last state of Œ±, is represented by Œ±.Œ±' . This sequence is also an execution fragment of I/O automaton A.  Trace  A trace of an I/O automaton A is the sequence of external actions that occurs in some execution Œ± of A. The set of all traces of A is represented as traces(A).  Example: Three executions  Executions a, b and c are three executions of the automaton Ci,j described in Formal Definition of Channel I/O Automaton (where message m ‚àà {0, 1}). In this example, the states are indicated by putting the sequence of messages in queue in brackets; the empty sequence is represented by Œª. : (a) [Œª], send(1)i,j, [1], receive(1)i,j, [Œª], send(0)i,j, [0], receive(0)i,j, [Œª] : (b) [Œª], send(1)i,j, [1], receive(1)i,j, [Œª], send(0)i,j, [0] : (c) [Œª], send(1)i,j, [1], send(1)i,j, [11], send(0)i,j, [110]....  Operations on automata   Composition operation  It is possible to compose several automata, each describing individual system components, to yield an automaton that represents a larger, more complex system. In this case, actions that have the same name in each constituent automata are identified together. Therefore, when a component automata takes a step that includes an action œÄ, all other component automata with œÄ in their signatures also perform that action. The following outlines the conditions for composition of automata A and A' to be permitted: # The internal actions of A must be disjoint from actions of A‚Äô. This prevents performance of a step in A‚Äô when the internal actions of A ‚Äì with the same name as actions of A' - are performed. # The output actions of A and A‚Äô must be disjoint. This condition ensures that only one constituent automaton controls performance of an output action. If the composition is constructed from a countably infinite collection of automata, then there is an additional constraint: each action needs to be an action of only finitely many of the constituent automata. Infinite composition of automata allows modeling of logical systems that may be constructed from many logical components. The logical system is often implemented on a physical system that contains fewer components. = Example: Composition = right Figure 4 depicts a composition of two processes, Pi and Pj and a FIFO message channel Ci,j, matching output actions of one automaton with identically named input actions of other automata. Thus, a send(m)i,j output performed by process Pi is matched and performed with a send(m)i,j input performed by channel Ci,j. Process Pi sends the message m, where m ‚àà{1,0} via channel Ci,j to Process Pj. Process Pj reverses the bit in the received message m from Pi using its internal action reverse - not shown in the picture - and forwards the message to other parts of the system.  Hiding operation  It is possible to hide the output actions of an I/O automaton through \\"reclassifying them as internal actions.\\" This has the effect of excluding them from communication with other parts of the system. Formally, the hiding operation for signatures is described as follows: Let S be a signature and Œ¶ ‚äÜ out(S). hideŒ¶(S) is the new signature S', where * in(S')= in(S) * out(S')= out(S) - Œ¶ * int(S') =int(S) ‚à™ Œ¶ Therefore, \\"If A is an automaton and Œ¶ ‚äÜ out(A), then hideŒ¶(A) is the automaton A' obtained from A by replacing sig(A) with sig(A') = hideŒ¶(sig(A)).\\"  Fairness  Recall that a task partition is defined as an equivalence relation on an I/O automaton‚Äôs locally controlled actions, containing at most countably many equivalence classes. In this setting, fairness can be defined as continuously providing each task with a chance to perform an action. In an I/O automaton A, let C represent a class of tasks(A). Formally, an execution fragment Œ± of A is considered fair if the below criteria hold for every class C: # \\"If Œ± is finite, then C is not enabled in the final state of Œ±.\\" # \\"If Œ± is infinite, then Œ± contains either infinitely many events from C or infinitely many occurrences of states in which C is not enabled.\\" An event is defined as the \\"occurrence of an action in a sequence, for example, an execution or a trace.\\" Based on the definition of fairness, \\"infinitely often,\\" each task (or equivalence class C) gets a chance to perform an action. When a task (or equivalence class) C does get a chance to perform an action, two cases are possible: an action in C is enabled in current state and can be performed, or none of the actions in C are enabled in the current state and therefore, can not be performed. Thus, a finite fair execution with final state Sf can be defined as an execution where the automaton continuously gives turns to all tasks in a round-robin fashion, but no actions are executed as none are enabled in Sf. The set of fair executions of I/O automaton A is represented by fairexecs(A). Let Œ≤ be the trace of a fair execution of A. Then Œ≤ is a fair trace of A. The set fair traces of A is represented by fairtraces(A). In the execution example, execution (a) is fair, since in its final state no receive action is enabled. Execution (b) is finite, yet a receive action is enabled in its final state. Therefore, execution (b) is not fair. Execution (c) is infinite, does not contain receive events, and at all points after the first step, receive actions are enabled. Therefore, it is not a fair execution. The definition of fairness has a significant property: \\"the fair executions of a composition are the composition of the fair executions of the components:\\" that is, Fair(‚àèi Ai)= ‚àèi Fair(Ai).  Properties and proof methods  I/O automata provide an accurate description of asynchronous systems. They are also used to formalize and prove \\"precise claims\\" about \\"what systems can do.\\" In this section, a number of important types of properties are described. These, as well as further properties and proof methods, are explained in Distributed Algorithms.  Input enabling properties  The input enabling property states that the automaton cannot block input actions from happening. The two significant advantages of having this property are: # As the model is designed to cope with arbitrary inputs, a major source of system errors due to a failure in handling unexpected inputs is eliminated. # The input-enabling property makes use of \\"simple notions of external behavior for an automaton, based on sequences of external actions.\\" Proofs of certain theorems in the model might fail without the assumption of this property.  Trace properties  As internal actions of an I/O automaton are invisible to a user; the I/O automaton appears to be a black box and the user merely sees \\"traces of automaton's executions (or fair executions).\\" Certain properties of I/O automata and their proofs are typically formalized as \\"properties of their traces or fair traces.\\" Let P be a trace property; P has the following components: * sig(P), that represents a signature with no internal actions * traces(P), that corresponds to a set of \\"sequences of actions in acts(sig(P)).\\" This set may be infinite. The trace property describes an external signature as well as a set (or a property) of sequences viewed at that interface. Sometimes acts(sig(P)) is represented by a shorthand notation acts(P). When it is mentioned that I/O automaton A satisfies a trace property P, (at least) two different meanings might be intended: # \\"extsig(A) = sig(P) and traces(A) ‚äÜ traces(P)\\" # \\"extsig(A) = sig(P) and fairtraces(A) ‚äÜ traces(P)\\" Intuitively, it means that when A generates an external behavior then that is allowed by Property P. However, it is not required for A to actually represent every trace of P. Since A is input-enabled, then for every possible sequence of input actions, the fairtraces(A) (and so traces(A)) includes a response by A. If fairtraces(A) ‚äÜ traces(P) holds, then property P must contain all of the generated sequences.  Safety properties  Intuitively, a safety property represents the fact that nothing \\"bad\\" happens. More formally, Let P be a trace property. P is a trace safety property, or safety property, if the following criteria hold for traces(P). * traces(P) is not empty: Something bad cannot happen prior to occurrence of any events; therefore, having non-emptiness is a reasonable condition on traces(P). * traces(P) is \\"prefix-closed\\": Let Œ≤ ‚àà traces(P) and Œ≤' represent a finite prefix of Œ≤ In this case, Œ≤' ‚àà traces(P). To elaborate, assume there is a trace in which nothing bad happens. Therefore, nothing bad happens in any prefix of that trace. Thus, having prefix-closure is a reasonable condition on traces(P). * traces(P) is \\"limit-closed\\": Let Œ≤1, Œ≤2, . . . represent an infinite sequence of finite sequences in traces(P). Also, assume that for each i, Œ≤i is a prefix of Œ≤i+1. In this case, the unique sequence Œ≤, that is \\"the limit of the Œ≤i under the successive extension ordering\\" also exists in traces (P). Therefore, if something bad were to happen in a trace, then it would be the result of certain specific event in the trace. Having limit closure in this case is thus a reasonable condition on traces(P).  Liveness properties  Informally, a liveness property can be interpreted as something \\"good\\" eventually happens. Therefore, regardless of what has happened to a certain point in time, something good can happen at some time in the future. More formally, let P be a trace property. P is a trace liveness property, or a liveness property, \\"if every finite sequence over acts(P) has some extension in traces(P).\\"  Further reading  * Timed I/O Automaton: * Probabilistic I/O Automaton:  See also  * Communicating sequential processes * Actor model  References  Distributed computing ","title":"Input/output automaton"},{"id":"34169735","text":"The presentation and the identities of the BBC News Channel, the international counterpart BBC World News and the BBC Parliament coverage channel use specific identities that demonstrate their remit and purpose.

Other graphics including Astons, information graphics located at the bottom of the screen, were written on a two toned translucent purple and yellow background that merged into the picture. If a broadcast was live, an additional orange stripe with 'LIVE' inside was added on top of the clock to denote this fact. Promotions for the channel followed the style used by the rest of the BBC Television network, consisting of the channel logo located at the bottom of the screen throughout the promotion, with information being added on top of the logo at the end. Contains video evidence of channel promotions. The channel font was Gill Sans, also used by the BBC as a whole. Due to the rolling news nature of the channel, in the final few minutes to the top of the hour, a filler sequence was used which featured one of the flags waving while the music built up, with flag and music linking seamlessly into the ident at the top of the hour. This filler would often be overlaid with a programme schedule for upcoming programmes or promoting the BBC News Website. The new look BBC News 24 was deliberately meant to look more open and friendly to new audiences and to look less authoritative. As a result, the newsreaders didn't wear jackets and were filmed in the BBC Newsroom at the time, which was the studio for BBC News 24. The walls of this newsroom were decorated with panels featuring the bold colours and shapes such as stars, semicircles and numerous lines seen in the idents. Contains pictorial evidence of channels studio. Separating the newsroom from the desk was a simple metal barrier. Behind and left of the desk was a special weather station featuring a computer and weather graphic monitor. Following the move to the new BBC News Centre, located in BBC Television Centre, of all television and radio bulletins, the backdrop to BBC News 24 was changed to include a camera view of the new newsroom with a coloured panel featuring the BBC News logo over a flag. On the channel some overnight bulletins were simulcast on BBC World, and as a result the logo on the ident was changed to the generic BBC News logo, increased in size and placed in the centre of the screen. Another logo variation also existed which became prominent on bulletins around 1998, featuring a two-line logo where the 'News 24' appeared below and of equal length to the BBC logo itself. 1999 cream look All BBC News content shared a uniform style in 1999 By 1999 a problem had become apparent with BBC News, something noticed by Lambie-Nairn. Despite an attempt in 1993 to unite all the news bulletins under a single brand, the news brand overall had fragmented with different looks for BBC News bulletins, Breakfast News, regional news, BBC News 24 and BBC World. As a result, Lambie-Nairn introduced a new brand that would encompass all of the BBC News output, with the exception of Breakfast News which would relaunch in 2000 as BBC Breakfast with the new style. Regional news would get a slight variation of the look but with several elements retained. This style involved a new cream and red colour scheme and a numeral to represent the time of day of the bulletin. In the case of News 24, a large '24' was used instead. Contains pictorial evidence of channel presentation. The ident designed featured a cream background with red pulsating rings and scenes; throughout the idents, place names would appear as anagrams and systematically flick through letters to form the place name, while a map of the UK could be seen at the beginning of the sequence and various styles of clock faces could be seen in the red ellipse with the hands passing a '24' mark on the clock face. The sequence ended with a large white '24' seen from the front left against a red ellipse on a cream background with the one-line BBC News logo overlaid the numeral in the centre of the screen. The music for the ident and for the whole of BBC News was composed by David Lowe and incorporated elements such as the BBC Pips, used on BBC Radio to mark the hour. This score was vastly different from the orchestral scores used by other news producers ITN and Sky News. The music was considered bold and different. The graphics used by the channel were changed; the DOG remained the same, the background colour of the clock was changed to purple, and the box no longer extended off to the left of the screen. Contains pictorial evidence of channel presentation. When a live broadcast occurred, a graphic was added on top of the clock, however the colour was changed to red. Equally, the channel astons were changed so the main body text, stating details about the story, shared the same translucent purple colour as the clock while the headline strip was a solid cream colour with bold red text. This strip changed colour in the event of a breaking news story, when it became red with white text, or when the channel reported the death of a notable public figure, such as Princess Margaret, when the heading became black with white text. Promotional style remained the same as from launch with the BBC News 24 logo being used and the generic BBC style used. However, more adventurous styles were being tested with the one-line logo often being dropped in favour of the large 24 numeral. Gill Sans was retained as the font on the channel. For the re-launch, the idea of a filler was extended further to a full countdown. This consisted of world continents rotating on the left hand side of the screen which overlapped two large numerals filling the right side of the screen counting down until the top of the hour. The soundtrack used an extended version of David Lowe's soundtrack for the main titles. The beeps in the soundtrack, similar to the BBC Pips, corresponded to the seconds changing and became louder and more noticeable from 10 seconds. This countdown came with and without the BBC News 24 one-line logo at the bottom and also had programming details overlaid on some junctions. On the occasions that BBC News 24 simulcast with BBC World, a generic BBC News graphic featuring a world at the centre was used - this graphic was also used for the generic bulletins on BBC Television. There was also a change in the BBC News 24 set. Upon re-launch in 1999, the newsroom feel was retained but smartened up with beige and red walls. Contains pictorial evidence of channels studio set. To either side of the long desk were two flat screen televisions for linking into sport, weather and to partake in interviews; a large curved half wall went around the rear of the desk separating it from the newsroom. The newsroom featured numerous televisions embedded into the far back wall and attached to a circular display behind the desk suspended from the ceiling. Weather was now presented from the main weather studio used by the terrestrial bulletins and Sport was now presented from its own studio featuring a small desk against a background of ten small televisions embedded into the wall. In April 2002 some small changes were made to the studio and graphics. The astons were changed to a shaded area beneath a red line containing all the information; for breaking news this remained on screen throughout. Contains pictorial evidence of channel presentation. The studio was also changed: the suspended circular television display was removed in favour of a bank of televisions at the very back of the studio, and television screens were arranged around the two pillars behind the desk. Contains pictorial evidence of channel studio design. One final change of the look occurred in January 2003 when the countdown sequence was replaced by four sequences showing peoples busy lives, combining a mix of ordinary footage and time-lapse photography. These scenes were counted down by the David Lowe theme and an italicised second counter in the bottom right corner. 2003 clamshell Between 2003 and 2007 the top of the hour sequence included the first news headline In 2003, BBC News 24 dropped the cream look from 1999 and adopted a new look, designed in house, and featuring a black and red globe. Contains video evidence of channel presentation. The look had been a result of a government report carried out by Richard Lambert which had investigated whether BBC News 24 had been fulfilling its remit. Contains pictorial evidence of channel news presentation. It praised the improvements made by the channel in April 2002 but stated the BBC needed to become more \\"distinct\\" and needed a \\"clearer sense of direction\\". This new presentation package aimed to respond to these suggestions. Nicknamed the 'clamshell' in reference to the finishing position of the red segments, the ident began with the rapid expansion of a red sphere with a disc intersecting it to reveal a globe before the disc segments reform together as the background to the globe in the familiar clamshell design. Overlaid the globe, and formed at the conclusion by the formation of five lines, is a large numeral '24'. Below the ident at the bottom of the screen is a white BBC News logo. The composed by David Lowe was altered by him for the new look. A key part of the look was the inclusion of the top headline into a ribbon which orbited the globe for a time before retracting back; other ribbons of this nature were present in the background, but featured the BBC News logo. The 24 numeral was originally a creamy yellow in colour before becoming silver in colour in 2004 when the identity was subsequently adopted across the television news output. The '24' numeral was dropped when the titles are used in BBC News bulletins on BBC One. Contains pictorial evidence of channel graphics and astons. Contains pictorial evidence of channel presentation. The graphics of the re-launch were different from those of the last look in many ways. The BBC News 24 channel identification was moved from the upper left corner of the screen to become part of the Aston; the News 24 has been brought down below the BBC logo and is contained along with the clock in a red box with the red and black globe visible in the background. Contains pictorial evidence of channel presentation. The remainder of the aston featured a red heading with black information box with white text with no specific colour used for breaking news. For live broadcasts, a red box containing 'LIVE' was added to the top left corner of the screen, usually with the location written to the right in a black box. Originally no ticker, a device used to scroll news and information across the bottom of the screen, was used consistently on the channel, however one was adopted c.2004. This ticker ran from below the clock across to the right of the screen; the topic of the ticker was shown in a black box below the clock with the news rolling by in black on a white background separated by the BBC logo. Promotions for the channel changed with the new look, with the channel adopting a box logo of a dark red colour with an upper case 'News 24' below the BBC logo in white inside. The box is located throughout the promotion to the lower right corner of the screen. The channel also began to change their font, making greater use of the Arial font alongside the Gill Sans logo. The previous countdown style was retained, with images of everyday life alongside time-lapse photography being used. The numerals were moved to the bottom left corner and straightened up. The bottom of the screen was now shaded black, containing the numerals and a small programme menu placed to the right of the numeral. The menu and shading would often fade out at five and ten seconds to the hour respectively. The far right section of the BBC News set in use between 2003 and 2008. For bulletins simulcast with BBC World, no numeral was seen over the clamshell, and for some programmes such as The World Today the programme title replaced the numeral, leaving only the BBC News logo at the bottom of the screen. For the re-launch, the studio was completely redesigned. The newsroom in the background was laid out and separated from the studio by glass panels that were slightly frosted. The studio was split into three sections to allow a more flexible presentation style; the middle section contained the main desk and flanked by two screens behind the desk to the left and right; the left hand segment featured a small round standing studio for delivering headlines and news roundups while the right hand segment featured a round standing set with a screen behind, usually used for sports, business and in depth review. The whole set was designed by Simon Jago. Contains pictorial evidence of studio layout. Contains pictorial evidence of studio layout. Contains pictorial evidence of studio layout. In 2005, the countdown was changed following a test on BBC World. The new sequence showed the elements involved in bringing news to the air, including footage of BBC journalists, cameramen and production staff around the UK and the world. The new sequences were the brainchild of Mark Chaudoir of BBC Broadcast and were specially shot on DV to give the shots a gritty look. Overlaid on the footage are red bars representing the news being broadcast between satellite transmitters worldwide. A red translucent bar extended from the left hand side of the screen containing the countdown clock featuring the seconds and marking every frame (PAL timecode). Contains pictorial evidence of channel countdowns. 2007 Clamshell In 2007, the play-out systems for BBC World and BBC News 24 were upgraded and replaced. As a result, the channels presentation was upgraded to keep the look fresh on 22 January 2007. Contains pictorial evidence of channel news presentation. This new look was subsequently rolled out to the other BBC News bulletins the same year. Contains video evidence of channel presentation. The new idents had the same theme as the previous look, but the whole look had been upgraded with new 3D glossy graphics. The new ident began with a close up of the rotating red and black globe over Europe, South Asia and Australia while the strands of news seen in the countdown circle the world. The ident then pulls out to a full view of the globe as a single 'BBC News' ribbon moves backwards across the globe and the red segments form the clamshell shape. The numeral appears last, appearing from the background outwards. The numeral is now pure white and has a small reflection immediately below the numeral. The BBC News one-line logo is still present at the bottom of the ident. The numeral would be removed prior to programming simulcast on BBC World. Contains pictorial evidence of channel graphics. The channel graphics changed quite considerably for this new look. The channel name was returned to the one-line variation seen previously and placed at the bottom left of the screen just inside the 4:3 safe zone of the 16:9 widescreen picture; the white logo was contained inside a dark red box that extended to the far left of the screen. To the right of the logo was a white bar containing a, now fully adopted, news ticker. News stories appeared in black and were separated by the BBC logo as previous. The clock was originally located to the left of the BBC News 24 logo, however in February 2007, due to complaints from viewers that the clock was cut off a 4:3 screen, it was moved and contained within a black box at the very left of the white news ticker. Above the logo and ticker was the information about the story and the people involved. The headline itself was contained within an opaque dark red stripe crossing the entire picture, while the further information was added below in a translucent black section. The design of the live broadcast tag remained the same with the exception of a darker colour red used. Promotions for the channel remained relatively the same as previously with two main differences: the BBC News 24 box logo was moved to the left hand corner of the screen and any information given at the end of the promotion was added at the bottom above and below a red line that extended from the logo across the screen. The countdown was retained in its entirety upon its launch in January 2007, Contains pictorial evidence of channel countdowns. but was tweaked slightly in 2008 when the BBC News 24 logo was overlaid on the sequence and the time was moved to the bottom right corner of the screen and overlaid directly onto the image. It was about this time that the sequences were updated with new images of the BBC journalists and production staff. The studio set was retained from the last look with no major modifications made. The furniture was a slightly deeper shade of red to match the new graphics, but apart from this the three section set was retained. 2008 White look Following the name change in 2008 the graphics were also re-launched In April 2008, the entire BBC News department was reorganised at a cost of ¬£550,000. Contains video evidence of channel presentation. As part of this, a new look was commissioned by Mark Byford, designed by Lambie-Nairn and the BBC News designers, featured a new remix of the theme by David Lowe and was subsequently applied to the whole BBC News output. The result of this was that BBC News 24 was renamed as BBC News and referred to on air as the BBC News Channel. This was as a result of a survey which revealed that the majority of the population referred to the channel as News 24 and saw the channel as inferior to the main news bulletins. The new titles feature an abstract globe made out of the continents and given shape by pulsating rings of a red colour; the ident itself features the globe coming together from many different angles and ending with the globe fully formed on the right of the screen. Contains pictorial evidence of channel presentation. The new BBC News box logo was also added to the bottom left corner of the screen and featured the word 'News' below the BBC logo. The box look fits with the other brands of the BBC and allows cross promotion of the channel. In addition to the main ident a second short animation, called a sting, was used. Stings had been used previously by the channel, however mainly as a break between headlines. In the current look, the red globe is used only at the beginning of bulletins themselves whereas the sting is to identify the channel or to introduce news related programming into the schedule, such as Click. This sting involves each of the continents appearing in the centre of the screen as each pulsating ring passes over it, ending up with a full grey and white globe overlaid with the BBC News logo in the centre of the screen. The re-launch also saw a modification in the channels DOG and Aston design. The one-line BBC News logo was now used as the channel DOG and remained at the bottom left of the screen, however inside the 4:3 safe zone, inside a deep red box matching the same colour as the box logo design. To the immediate right, the channel clock was encased in a black box with white text and running from there to the far right of the screen is the news ticker, now grey in colour with white text. The ticker subject would rotate up from the far left side of the ticker and dissolved out once the news began to scroll across, separated by large dots. Above all this would be a double thickness white box containing any information, headlines or people identification, in which case the person‚Äôs name or headline would appear in bold in the top of the box. If a live broadcast occurred, then this would be denoted by a red 'LIVE' identification in the top left corner of the screen with the location of the broadcast listed in a black box to the right. In the case of breaking news, the Aston would change colour accordingly. If breaking news appears on the ticker, then the ticker box would become red, as would the main aston itself which would switch to a red box with white text. Also in these occasions, another smaller box would be added on top of the main aston and aligned left to indicate the story was breaking; this smaller box was white with bold red text. Contains pictorial evidence of channel presentation. Promotions for the channel used a similar style to that used previously, with the BBC News box logo appearing in the bottom left corner of the screen throughout, with end boards frequently over the white globe background. However, promotions for the channel itself have become less frequent as the adoption of the same logo and idents for all news bulletins causes confusion when promoting the service as to which bulletin or service the promotion is referring to. At the same time, BBC News as a whole organisation, systematically adopted Gill Sans as the typeface for all graphics and logos, following the use of other typefaces in previous years. The 2013 countdown sequence The countdown style was retained for the new look. The countdown still featured journalists and production crew filming the reports, with the red News beams still seen being broadcast from transmitters and satellite dishes. The timer has remained in the bottom right corner and still records frame (PAL timecode), but changed to use the Gill Sans font in line with the rest of the channel, and also adopted the BBC News box logo in the bottom left corner of the screen instead of the DOG used in the previous look. The countdown concluded by linking directly into the sting animation. Contains pictorial evidence of channel countdowns. One of the most dramatic changes was as a result of the set change. Following the feedback stating that BBC News 24 was less authoritative than the main news bulletins, the newsroom was abandoned. The channel moved into Studio N6 in Television Centre; the set there had been in use for approximately a year, and featured a single desk on a raised platform in the middle of the rectangular studio, with video walls running round the centre of all the walls. As a result, an image or graphic could appear anywhere on the many screens behind the presenters, allowing a great deal of flexibility in the arrangement of the channel and the presentation of news stories and of business and sports news. 2013 White look Following BBC News' move to Broadcasting House on 18 March 2013, the on-screen presentation of BBC News was refreshed. The main titles remained the same however the channel logo was made smaller and stayed on screen for a few seconds after the titles. The channel's astons were altered and the font was changed from Gill Sans to Helvetica Neue. Also, a new countdown sequence was used, this time featured more red beams and report filming, and the countdown and opening title music is slightly modified. Channel production was changed to HD, although this was only visible during BBC TWO HD simulcasts prior to the 10 December 2013 launch of BBC News HD.  2019 Reith redesign  2019 Reith redesign On 15 July 2019, the BBC rolled out its new on-air look replacing the layout seen since 2013, unifying the presentation used online and on other BBC on-air properties across news bulletins, the BBC News Channel, BBC Breakfast and local news bulletins. The new layout makes use of the BBC Reith typeface extensively, much like that used on other BBC channels, for example BBC Two. Text is generally larger, notably with headlines, with containing boxes strongly contrasting with the background, taking up more space on the screen, something that has drawn criticism for often obscuring the content behind. The BBC cites these changes as improving readability, making content easier to read on smartphones and tablets, for example on the BBC's official YouTube channels where content is often ripped straight from TV. As part of this redesign, the BBC replaced the long-used headline 'ticker', replacing it with headlines that scroll from the bottom individually, one at a time. Despite these changes, only the local bulletin titles have been updated, otherwise using the 2008 titles and music. BBC Parliament 1998 Water look BBC Parliament took over from the cable- only Parliamentary Channel on 23 September 1998, transmitting sessions of the House of Commons, House of Lords, Scottish Parliament, Welsh National Assembly, and the Northern Ireland Assembly among other programmes of political interest. Contains video evidence of channel presentation. Contains pictorial evidence of channel presentation. Upon launch, the channel was available on cable, satellite and on digital terrestrial television, however the latter platform had insufficient bandwidth to allow the channel to transmit pictures, and it was restricted to sound-only transmissions with a fixed caption identifying the channel. The channel's launch identity featured the channel logo in the centre of the screen over a background similar in style to water and accompanied by an orchestral musical score. The channel logo consisted of the BBC logo with the channel name 'Parliament' written to the right in white upper case text, as common with all other BBC channels at the time. The BBC Parliament logo would also appear as a Digital on-screen graphic (DOG), located in the top left hand corner of the screen and present for all programmes. Accompanying coverage were Astons, graphics at the bottom of the screen, that provided information on the speakers in the coverage. These astons consisted of a black bar, upon which information such as the speakers name and party affiliation would be shown at opposite ends of the bar, and a box beneath for additional information related to the speech or to state the constituency depending on which house was being broadcast. This large box would be colour-coded according to house - green for the House of Commons, red for the House of Lords and additional colours for other committees and coverage. On the occasion that the broadcast scenes were not live and instead recorded, a 'R' would appear encased in a circle in the top right corner of the screen. Prior to channel programmes, short idents known as 'stings' were used to introduce the programme. These featured the BBC Parliament logo at the bottom of the screen with the programme title in the centre against the water background of the ident. This same background was used over programme menus and other generic channel information, however in these cases the channel broke with common BBC style by aligning the text right and by not including the channel logo at the bottom of the screen, although the logo was present through the channel DOG. The channel did adhere to common practice with promotions however, with the BBC Parliament logo present throughout the promotion at the bottom of the screen and with programme details appearing centred above the logo at the end of the promotion. The typeface used by the channel was Gill Sans, in line with the rest of the corporation. 2002 spiral The BBC Parliament ident, used between 2002 and 2009 In 2002, BBC Parliament underwent several changes. On the DTT platform, the channel's bandwidth was increased enough to allow a quarter-screen picture to be broadcast, with the remaining screen space taken up by commentary of the channel. The channel's output was also upgraded to 16:9 widescreen, one of the last BBC channels to do so. As a result of these changes, a stronger presentational package was adopted. Created in house by BBC News, the new ident would represent the \\"inner workings of Parliament\\", through the depiction of the mechanisms of Big Ben and the design inspirations of the Palace of Westminster. The new ident featured a rotating coil of metal, with teeth cut into the outside edges of the spiralled coil. Pulsating rings would also be emitted from the coil as it spun, reflecting the BBC News style at the time, and the camera angle would often change position throughout the ident. The ident ended with the one-line BBC Parliament logo appearing in the centre of the screen. The ident itself was a filmed model, built and shot at Pirate by Martin Godward and lit by Tony May with post production by SVC. The soundtrack was by David Lowe and was similar to the BBC News theme of the time and reflected the similarity between the channel and the BBC News service. The channel DOG survived in the same one-line form and in the same location in the top left of the screen. The channel graphics were advanced upon the re-launch from the original designs. The astons featured a red box crossing the screen with a translucent shaded area below, with both intersected by a vertical box on the left-hand side of the screen and running between both regions. The red box at the top would contain the motion being passed or the event itself, such as Prime Ministers Question Time, while the area below would feature information about the act or the session or the names of the people speaking; in these cases their name would feature in bold with their party and seat below. The cross section box would feature the date of the debate on the top line in an orange box with a pictorial reference below, usually the logo, to represent the house, assembly or parliament being broadcast. In the case of an outside address, such as to a press conference or another country's parliament, then a pictorial camera was used instead. The BBC Parliament box logo Channel promotions originally featured the generic BBC style featuring the BBC Parliament one-line logo present during the whole promotion, with further information appearing centred at the end. However, after some time the promotional style changed to a box style, where the 'Parliament' name was shown below a BBC logo and contained inside a box of a deep red colour to match BBC News 24 at the time. This box would remain present throughout the promotion in the bottom left corner of the screen. Programme menus were frequently used and originally consisted with the same styling as previous, with the menu moved towards the centre of the screen. However, this was later changed so that the programme names were located in a shaded box and that the date was made smaller and located in a red bar running across the upper screen. Often, pictures representing the titles of the programmes were used as inserts against the spiral background as 'Next' graphics. The channel font was originally Gill Sans, as used previously, however some elements of the channel began to use different fonts, such as Arial - mainly for aston graphics and menus; the logo and promotion font remained Gill Sans. 2009 Cogs The BBC Parliament ident, used from 20 April 2009 to 10 October 2016. In April 2009, BBC Parliament was rebranded and brought up to date and more into line with BBC News output. The new design was by Lambie-Nairn and the music was by David Lowe. The new ident featured the idea of cogs, with numerous cogs inside each other turning and twisting as viewed on screen from different angles; the centre cog is solid and features an 'X' cut out of the centre. The whole sequence represented the inner workings of Parliament itself, with the centre cog used to mark an individual vote at the centre of government. The cogs were shown on a white background, with red elements integrated into the sequence with the cogs being lit red at the end of the sequence. The cogs would form together to the right of the screen at the end of the sequence, mirroring the location of the globe in the 2008 BBC News sequences. The channel name would appear in the final seconds of the ident with the name 'Parliament' written below a BBC logo in grey and bold; the logo was aligned left, rather than centred, and was placed in the middle left of the screen. Also present throughout the idents were geographical place names linked together by thin grey lines; this reflects back to the BBC News look who use place names in their opening titles but also to BBC Parliament's field of operation as all place names are locations of government the channel covers: Westminster, Holyrood, Cardiff Bay, Stormont, Strasbourg and Brussels. The channel aston and DOG changed significantly with the latest re-launch, with a new style similar to the BBC News Channel in use. The BBC Parliament DOG retained its one-line format, however the 'Parliament' name was made bold, and was moved to the bottom of the screen; located to the left of the screen in a red box, it formed an integral part of the aston graphics. To the right of this box another black box of the same height contained the date of the debate. A grey box then extended to the right of the screen in which the debating location was placed, such as House of Commons, in upper case. Above this lower bar, a translucent white box would contain information about the debate and the members speaking, with the members name in bold and their party affiliation and seat listed below. On top of this, a red translucent box, aligned to the left of the white box, would name the debate or event in progress. In the event of a live broadcast, a red box will be displayed in the top left corner of the screen containing 'Live'. In some instances, a grey box containing 'Recorded' is displayed in cases of old debated being broadcast. Channel menus would take place over the cog graphic, with the cog rotating in the centre of the screen, while the menu is displayed on the right side of the screen against a shaded white area with the BBC Parliament DOG in the red box present at the bottom. This centralised cog graphic would also link into live coverage of a debate, with the name appearing in the centre of the cog and the BBC Parliament logo present at the centre bottom of the screen without the red box surround. The look also reasserted Gill Sans as the only typeface used on the channel, in line with the internal BBC corporate style and that of BBC News. This package last appeared on 10 October 2016 prior to the launch of the current look. 2016 \\"Cogs and colours\\" On 10 October 2016, the BBC News red and gears look gave way to a new on-screen imaging package with colourful idents and softer, orchestral music led by an oboe soloist with plucked strings, percussion and elements of a chorus. Here, the cogs from the previous look are re-imagined as free-wheeling, less-clock-like, spinning on an invisible axis in a layered formation, overlaid on blocks of translucent colours, flipping over with a mix of 3-D cog wheels and line-drawn cogs. The main ident between shows is now silent, with the cogs flipping over and spinning not unlike the former ITV Rediffusion logo. The effect is less mechanical and less bombastic than the previous ident, more pastel-shaded and includes images of the parliaments of the UK home nations and the EU parliament. The transition to the new look was marked by a presenter sitting in the editing suite throwing a fader, to reveal the new look which was played out in full. The BBC Parliament identity is different from the previous one, with upper and lower case lettering and a softer, grey look similar to the main BBC News. The transition to the new package did not coincide with the beginning of the British conference season, which meant that coverage of the SDP Conference of October 2016 had the visuals of the 2009 look overlaid with the new 2016 music. The on-screen graphics for live and recorded sittings remained unchanged, similar to the BBC News channel look. BBC World News 1995 Flags BBC World's flags look in 1995. The channel originally launched as BBC World on 16 January 1995 at 19:00 GMT. The new channel was formed following the split of BBC World Service Television into the international news and current affairs channel BBC World and the entertainment channel BBC Prime. Contains video evidence of channel presentation. The channel's launch identity was designed by Lambie-Nairn and consisted of various elements of flags and of fictitious flags themselves. The ident consisted of various elements of flag designs, such as coloured stars, crosses, parallel lines and rectangular coloured flag segments moving off the screen in all directions to reveal the BBC World logo against a blue flag background. The BBC World logo at the time featured the BBC logo over the channel name 'World' written in the typeface Twentieth Century, the typeface used by the entire channel at the time. To give the impression of the logo floating atop the flag, a shadow of the logo was added below. The music featured an orchestral score heavy on Brass instruments. The introduction of the news programmes themselves also consisted of similar elements, with the flag segments seen moving across the globe before forming behind the channel name in a translucent rectangle with the BBC logo on top. This was deliberately intended to give the titles and the ident a similar look and to link between them. The channel logo featured as the channel Digital on-screen graphic (DOG) also, which was located in the top left corner of the screen and identified the channel. The channel didn't use any astons, or graphics present at the bottom of the screen to provide information, that were permanently placed there. Graphics consisted solely of a bar running across the bottom of the page which was multi-coloured to match the flag designs, but muted by a translucent finish to appear more appropriate for the bulletins. The channel promotional style was consistent with the remainder of BBC Television output, consisting of a sidebar that appeared at the end of the ident containing an image from the BBC World flags ident. The programme name would appear at the bottom of the screen, aligned left, while the programme times were placed in the sidebar to reflect different world areas. Various other channel continuity elements also used the flags, such as 'Coming up' and 'Next' graphics, as well as break bumpers and break fillers. In addition, some promotion stings were also used which revolved around people in a colour filtered environment before the promotion ran. Contains video evidence of promotions. The studio set at the time featured an extended computer generated set used by the BBC domestic news at the time. This featured a desk which was extended by computer graphics in wide shots of the studio, and featured an artificial studio environment. 1997 flags To coincide with the launch of BBC News 24 and the BBC's corporate rebrand as a whole, BBC World refreshed its identity. Designed by Lambie-Nairn, the new look kept the flags theme but updated it and brought it into line with BBC News 24. The ident transitioned between different fictitious flag designs against an orchestral soundtrack, composed and produced by Joe Glasman of HUM music production, as part of a suite of music for BBC World, which was different from BBC News 24 and slightly more subdued than the previous look. BBC World's logo now followed the corporation logo guidelines, which consisted of the new BBC logo followed by the channel name 'World' in upper case to the right of the logo. This same logo was also used as the channel DOG, located in the top left corner of the screen throughout all programming. The channel uses few on screen graphics and astons for news coverage; this is partly a result of the differing time zones across the broadcast area so the use of a clock is inaccurate and impractical. When introducing people, or for a summary of the headlines, a single box was used which features one of the flag designs in the far right of the box and a background of a combined blue design. The channel promotions for upcoming programmes followed the same guidelines as the rest of the television network and consisted of the BBC World logo located at the bottom of the screen throughout the promotion, with information being added on top of the logo at the end. The channel font was changed to Gill Sans, also used by the BBC as a whole. Also used between breaks in programmes, when adverts were not inserted by some operators, were break fillers consisting a white flag background and a stripe across the top in a bright colour containing the information topic. Some bulletins on the channel were also simulcast on BBC News 24, often during the overnight GMT slot, and in these cases the bulletin used a generic 'BBC News' one-line logo placed in the centre of the screen. In these cases, the idents played with the BBC News 24 music version and were presented from the BBC News 24 studio. 2000 Cream and Red look The channel ident from 2000. On 3 April 2000, BBC World was given a look that was based upon those being used by the rest of the BBC domestic news bulletins. Lambie-Nairn designed the new look which differentiated between the ident used on the channel and the titles for the bulletins. Contains video evidence of channel presentation. The ident used prior to programmes on the channel featured a rotating ellipse shape against a rotating globe background upon which the BBC World logo appears on top in white. In contrast, the news bulletins used the same cream and red colour scheme used by the rest of the BBC News network, with the exception of Breakfast News. These titles features pulsating rings moving over a small cream-and-red spinning globe in the centre of the screen from various angles while place names of various cities appear around. The globe finished inside two intersecting red ellipses, before the BBC News one-line logo appears in the centre of the screen and the BBC World one-line logo appears at the bottom of the screen. The music was composed by David Lowe and was used on the rest of the BBC News network. The channel used a DOG in the form of the channel logo in the top left of the screen. Beneath this, a red box with 'Live' inside would be added in the event of a live broadcast on the station. The aston graphics would only appear with certain information and featured a translucent purple colour box, extending from the right to the centre left of the screen, while the headline strip was a solid cream colour with bold red text. Promotions for the channel still used the BBC World one-line logo at the centre bottom of the screen throughout. The break filler used the same background as the ident as well as a similar music remix to the ident itself. Each item was separated by a line of scrolling letters moving right across the screen, leaving behind the name of the upcoming strand such as Business, Coming up, Sport, before the scrolling letters move across the screen again removing the small word. The strand name would be placed in the top right corner of the screen with the information centred in the screen. Gill Sans was retained as the font on the channel. In addition to the filler, a countdown was used by the channel for the first time. The countdown included a rotating globe in the left side of the screen, while a large italic numeral counted down the seconds until the hour. The soundtrack accompanied the seconds and was a remixed variation of the news theme. As the countdown reached five seconds, a beep accompanied each second in a similar fashion to the BBC Pips; this was used as an inspiration to the news theme. On the occasions that BBC World simulcast with BBC News 24, a generic BBC News graphic, used for the generic bulletins on BBC Television, was used instead of the normal news graphic. To accompany the new look, BBC World swapped sets with BBC News 24, so that BBC World now used thusemall newsroom that had been used previously by News 24. The set featured the front desk with two flat screen televisions to either side of the desk, mounted on pillars. Immediately behind the presenters and only separated by a railing was the live newsroom set, complete with televisions embedded in the back wall and given a red makeover. 2003 orange clamshell Introduced on 8 December 2003, a new in house designed look was launched on BBC World. Contains video evidence of channel presentation. This new look brought back a similarity between the idents of the channel and the news graphics. The news ident was exactly the same as on BBC News 24 and consisted of a globe surrounded by orange segments and the movement of a stream containing the main headline around the globe, before the globe gets smaller and moves into the familiar 'clamshell' design. At the end, the BBC World one-line logo is added at the bottom of the screen, while a larger BBC News one-line logo is overlaid onto the globe in the centre of the screen. The ident consists of the globe up close surrounded on all sides by the orange segments and \\"BBC News\\" ribbons; the globe then shrinks back into the animated clamshell design before a large BBC World logo is added at the bottom of the screen along with the station tag line 'Putting News First'. The channel DOG for the look was relocated during news bulletins to a two-line logo, set within a red box with a spinning globe in the background. At the bottom of this box, the BBC World news URL was added. Astons consisted of a black box extending from the bottom of the channel logo box to the right of the screen with a red ending to the box. In the event of breaking news, a thick red box would be added above this other aston, containing the headline story. Later on, a ticker was added below the box in white with the news theme box in black and with the headlines separated by the BBC logo. The break filler was again changed with the look; an area to the left of the screen was devoted to news headlines or promotions for upcoming programmes while to the right small boxes contained promotions for online information and the latest stock market figures. The bottom of the screen showcased the next two programmes and their air times, while the background featured panning shots over orange global continents. As seen on the domestic channel, BBC World began to change their font, making greater use of the Arial font with the Gill Sans logo. A new countdown was also introduced with the look, featuring an orange globe rotating while the orange logo segments rise and fall around the globe, with the countdown seconds viewed on the globe itself as shaded numerals. After five seconds, the numerals disappear from the globe as the globe shrinks back into the BBC World ident, providing a seamless link. The music used is another variation of David Lowe's theme, however with more exotic themes inserted into the music and a greater emphasis on the second markers also. The set for the look was retained unchanged until 2006. In 2005, the countdown was changed to a new sequence that showed the elements involved in bringing news to the air. These mainly involves footage, specially shot on DV for a gritty texture, of BBC journalists, cameramen and production staff around the UK and the world collecting news, while red beams are seen around the sky as that news is being broadcast. The new sequences were envisioned by Mark Chaudoir of BBC Broadcast. A red translucent box extended from the right hand side of the screen containing the countdown clock featuring the seconds and marking frame (PAL timecode). In 2006, the graphics were updated to a glossier news ident package, and the colours were updated so the orange was replaced with red. In addition, the ending of the news ident was amended so that a large BBC World one-line logo was placed in the middle of the screen, while a small BBC News logo was placed at the bottom of the screen. The astons remained the same for the look however. The biggest changes were to the set, which now featured a large oval desk with one screen behind and to the left and separated from the newsroom by a frosted glass railing. 2007 clamshell In 2007, a new play out system for BBC World and BBC News 24 was installed and as a result the graphics were again altered. 3D glossy graphics were now used to depict the whole globe package. Contains evidence of channel presentation. The news ident consisted of the clamshell look as before, but began with close up globe shots over Europe, South Asia and Australia as news light beams traverse round the globe, before pulling out to see the globe spinning rapidly into place within the clamshell graphic and the BBC World one-line logo appearing at the bottom of the screen. Contains pictorial evidence of channel presentation. Meanwhile, the generic channel ident consisted of a close-up of the globe, before panning left until the globe is located on the right side of the screen. A large BBC World one-line logo and tagline follow on the left side of the screen. Contains pictorial evidence of channel presentation. The astons were changed as part of the new look, with the BBC World logo returned to one-line form and placed in a red box at the very bottom of the screen within the 4:3 safe zone, with the box extending to the left of the screen. The remainder of the bottom of the screen is taken up by a white news ticker, separated by BBC logos. Above this, shaded black areas are used for information with glossy dark red boxes added on top in the case of some programmes and breaking news. Channel promotions now featured a BBC World box logo in dark red that was slightly elongated to either side so that the box was wider than on other BBC channels. This box, alongside the station tagline below, could be seen in the bottom right corner of the screen throughout. The promotion ended with no particular style and instead used the programme title sequence in place of the programme name. The break filler originally retained the style as used previously with updated channel logos, however it was changed around 2008 to a new style. This new layout featured two boxes adjacent to each other extending of each side of the screen. Where they meet in the centre left of the screen, the corners of the boxes curve with a slight gap between the two. The left hand box contains the topic of the information, e.g. News or Markets, placed sideways towards the right, while the right contains the information itself. Promotions included in the break filler took up the whole of the screen and shrank back as a smaller screen into a widened left hand box. The BBC World one-line logo in these occasions was located in the left hand corner of the screen. The background to each item varied and featured an image faded into a red toned background in the top and right sides. The countdown remained the same following the new look with no logo present on screen and only appeared when the final red bar engulfed the screen at the end of the countdown. Contains pictorial evidence of channel countdowns. The studio set also remained the same, albeit with slight colour modifications to make the reds deeper. 2008 white look As part of the April 2008 changes that rebranded BBC News 24 as the BBC News channel, BBC World was renamed BBC World News. This gave the channel a closer link with the main news bulletins of the same name and firmly focused the channel on that aspect of broadcasting. The new look matched the domestic BBC News output while also mirroring the looks soon to be applied to the BBC Persian and BBC Arabic television stations. BBC World News box logo. The titles featured exactly the same on screen look as BBC News channel and featured an abstract globe of red pulsating rings against a white background with interconnected place names. The change of name also resulted in a new box logo for BBC World News; this featured the 'World News' name on a separate line for each word below the BBC logo in a red box, matching the colour of the BBC News department logo as a whole, and of the same size as the other BBC box logos used domestically. The new logo was placed in the bottom corner on the ident. For junctions into non news programming, an ident featuring the globe and box logo appearing in the centre of the screen as each pulsating ring pass over it, was used. The David Lowe music was retained, sharing a similarity with the domestic channel while appealing to more multicultural audiences. Contains video evidence of channel presentation. The channel DOG and aston was also changed in line with the BBC News channel, consisting of a one-line BBC World News logo inside a red box in the bottom left of the screen, within the 4:3 safe zone, with a grey news ticker from right of the logo through to the right of the screen. On top of both, a large white box would appear with headlines and additional information, including the name of the reporter or interview subject. In the case of breaking news, this large box would become red, and a smaller white box with bold red text would be added to the top left of this box declaring the news as such. The ticker would also become red if it was scrolling through breaking news stories. In the case of a live broadcast, the red 'Live' box would be added to the top left of the screen, occasionally accompanied by the local time in an adjacent black box. In addition to the generic news bulletins, other programmes with specific audiences were launched such as GMT, The Hub and World News Today which broadcast news live but to a different audience. The programmes all had distinct opening titles featuring the BBC World News box logo in the bottom left of the screen, mirroring the main titles for the bulletins. While these live programmes were on air, a box containing the programme name in bold white and a background based from the programmes' opening titles, was placed above the BBC World News logo in the aston design. Also, the usual astons for headlines and information were suspended with breaking news appearing in the ticker only. Promotions for the channel usually consisted of the BBC World News logo located in the bottom right of the screen throughout. Break fillers retained the existing design with a few modifications; the unique background image was moved from the very background to inside the boxes with the information and was replaced in the screen background by a white and light grey version of the pulsating rings globe. The BBC World News box logo is also present in the bottom right of the screen throughout. Along with the rest of the BBC News organisation, the channel adopted the font Gill Sans for all on and off screen use. The channel still used the countdown as before, but the red box containing the numerals was removed and the numerals were changed to type Gill Sans. In contrast with the BBC News channel, BBC World News doesn't feature the channel logo until the end of the promotion, when the channel ident and sting is linked into instead. Following the repositioning of the domestic BBC News channel, the channel moved from its newsroom set to N6 at BBC Television Centre, freeing the way for BBC World News to move into the old newsroom in N8. The change occurred shortly after the rebrand, allowing time for N8 to be altered. The new set was rectangular and featured a desk with a frosted glass screen behind, imprinted with the BBC News abstract globe design and separating the newsroom, and had a large screen taking up the entire left side of the studio. This studio was primarily used, however another set was used, featuring a circular set with a small desk and a frosted glass screen behind. This screen displayed coverage of other channels in the newsroom, but due to the frosted glass was indistinguishable. 2013 White look Following BBC News' move to Broadcasting House, the on-screen presentation of BBC World News was refreshed in January 2013. After a soft launch via BBC Two HD overnight simulcasts, BBC News HD was fully launched on 10 December 2013. The main titles remained similar after production moved to HD whilst the channel's astons were altered and the typeface was changed from Gill Sans to Helvetica. The BBC World News box logo is shown throughout the countdown, similar to BBC News. In 2014, the countdown has been redesigned again, with the BBC World News box logo showing its slogan, \\"Live the Story,\\" at the bottom left of the screen.

The opening date for the film in the United States was February 4, 2000. To celebrate the 30th anniversary of the Teddy Awards, the film has been selected to be shown at the 66th Berlin International Film Festival in February 2016.  Film locations  Gendernauts was filmed on location, in San Francisco, California.  Synopsis  Told through the narration of Sandy Stone, who acts as a sort of tour guide, the film documents the lives of a group of transgender individuals, and one intersex individual, living in San Francisco, California. The narration provided by Stone is cut with interviews that develop and illustrate the ideas and themes she discusses in her vignettes. The film is shot on location in San Francisco, with the interviews of the subjects taking place in their natural settings and surroundings including their homes, offices, and the streets of San Francisco. The film explains, through the lives of its subjects, both the social and practical changes and decisions necessary for them to endure in order to live their lives as they see fit on the edge of traditional gender roles. The idea of gender neutrality is promoted throughout the film. Gender is not a characteristic that should be used to define a person. The film also shows how the subjects all interact with one another in the transgender subculture of San Francisco.  Cast  * Sandy Stone, narrator. * Susan Stryker: Stryker is a trans woman. She is a noted author and historian, with a focus on transgender history. Her research also focuses on San Francisco as a mecca for transgender and queer people from across the world.

Born Anita Valerio in Heidelberg, Germany in 1957, Max moved to San Francisco. Since his transition he has written poetry and memoirs about his transformation process. Max was also profiled in the film Female Misbehavior, an earlier work from Monika Treut. * Jordy Jones: Jordy is a trans man. He is a gender variant artist. His work, a project on Brandon Teena, was featured at the Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum in New York City. He and Stryker often collaborate on work throughout the west coast. Jones lives and works together with Stafford in San Francisco. * Stafford: Stafford is a trans man. He grew up in Gridley, CA. Wanting to escape the small town environment, Stafford joined the Army as a photographer. After a five-year stint as a military photographer Stafford ended up in San Francisco because he was appreciative of the open and welcoming environment the city provided.

She posed for Penthouse in 1980, which allowed her to leave her life in Minnesota for New York. She transplanted to San Francisco where she was very active in the nightclub scene. She then took a vow of silence and removed herself from public activity. She acts as a surrogate mother to Texas. She is also a former lover of Stafford. * Hida Viloria: Hida is an intersex writer and activist. Growing up she felt more female than male, describing her situation as being not quite female. Feeling both masculine and feminine, Hida had trouble feeling that she fit into the lesbian community, with its pressure to be one or the other, \\"butch\\" or \\"femme\\". Throughout her life her feelings concerning her gender have shifted from feeling more female to feeling more male to acknowledging that she has elements of both and fluctuates between them. In the film she declares herself to be in the middle ground between the two gender poles, an identity which today would be called genderqueer, but was not yet popularly accepted or understood at the time.

He was a librarian for the St. John's Methodist Episcopal Church in Williamsburgh and the Astor Library. He was librarian in charge of the newspaper room at the New York Public Library. Underhill helped to organize the Underhill Society of America in 1892, and served as Secretary and Family Historian until his death in 1936. He was also an active author, editor, and compiler with several published works to his credit. Biography Underhill was born June 5, 1850, in New York City, the son of Aaron Townsend Underhill (1823-1908) and Lucinda Cobb Harris (1830-1913). His professional career was spent as librarian, supervising collections in St. John's Methodist Episcopal Church in Williamsburgh, the Astor Library, and the New York Public Library's Newspaper Room. He retired from the New York Public Library in 1928 after more than 25 years of service. He was editor of the Standard Dictionary. Underhill was a lineal descendant of Captain John Underhill who arrived in the Massachusetts Bay Colony in 1630 and was a leading figure in Colonial America. His interest in the family history is what likely led him to organize the Underhill Society of America in 1892. In early meetings of the Society, David Harris Underhill often presided and shared his research with other family members. At one such meeting on February 22, 1892, Underhill read \\"an outline history of the Underhill family, tracing the line back to the year 804.\\". At the 14th Annual Meeting of the Society in 1906, David Underhill read a paper on Edward Underhill, an ancestor from England whose religious activities had him confined in the Tower of London. David Harris Underhill headstone at the Underhill Burying Ground. He married Caroline Fidelia Green of South Starksboro, Vermont, on July 29, 1873, in Chappaqua, New York. They had two children: Stephen Greene and Lucinda Harris. He lived at 247 Winthrop Street in Brooklyn. After his wife's death in 1934, he moved to live with his daughter permanently in Vermont. Following his death on June 29, 1936, he was buried at the Underhill Burying Ground in Lattingtown, New York. A sizable collection of material on Underhill history and genealogy was accumulated and maintained in his home until his death in 1936. The collection subsequently spent 45 years in storage. In 1981 space was leased by the Underhill Society of America along with the Townsend Society of America on East Main Street in Oyster Bay. They continued to operate from this location through the 1990s, when the Underhill Society and Townsend Society sought separate offices for their collections. The Underhill Society of America presently has offices and their archives in the basement of the Matinecock Masonic Lodge on West Main Street in Oyster Bay, New York, where many materials from the original David Harris Underhill collection are available to review. The David Harris Underhill Papers measuring two linear feet are in the collection of the Underhill Society of America. They contain important material pertaining to his role organizing the Underhill Society of America, and his activities on behalf of the organization for several decades to follow. Publications David Harris Underhill has the following publications to his credit. These include: * The Underhill Burying Ground : an account of a parcel of land situate at Locust Valley, Long Island, New York, deeded by the Matinecock Indians, February twentieth, sixteen hundred and sixty seven, to Captain John Underhill for meritorious service and known as the Underhill Burying Ground.

It was developed by C. Lorenz AG of Berlin starting in 1938 under the code name \\"Hohentwiel\\", an extinct volcano in the region of Baden-W√ºrttemberg in southern Germany. The device had originally been entered into a design contest held by the Luftwaffe for the new FuMG 40L (ground-based fire-control radar). When competitor Telefunken won that contract with its \\"W√ºrzburg radar\\" in 1939, the device was shelved. In 1941, Lorenz started to re-design it for another design contest by the Reichsluftfahrtministerium for an airborne naval search radar. As no special antenna had been specified, initially the simplest possible layout with three transversely-arranged antenna arrays was chosen - the central one for transmitting and two others for receiving, one each to port and starboard of the central transmitting array. Each antenna array possessed sixteen horizontally-oriented dipole elements, in eight sets of two elements each, with each set of four dipole groups vertically stacked comprising each array. For rough guidance, the radio operator had to manually switch the receiving arrays. Later, the device received a motor-driven antenna switch. The received signal strength was displayed on a cathode ray tube so the observer or pilot could roughly gauge the target's heading as 'left', 'right' or 'head on'. The maximum range was 150 km for convoys on the Atlantic. The device was first deployed on Junkers Ju 88, Focke-Wulf Fw 200 and other maritime patrol aircraft and twin-engined torpedo bomber designs, and is known to have been fitted to Heinkel He 111 medium bombers for training purposes, and experimented with on the Heinkel He 177A. In order to avoid capture after a crash, it was fitted with several small self-destruct explosive charges in each of the system's electronics cabinets, which could be triggered by the pilot. Further details are found in the air force manual (PDF, German language). Naval use In 1943, Lorenz was instructed to adapt Hohentwiel for naval use, and soon the Hohentwiel appeared on U-boats, small surface ships, and coastal installations. There are two U-boat versions of the FuG 200 Hohentwiel used during World War II; FuMO 61 Hohentwiel U and the FuMO 65 Hohentwiel U1. The U-boat versions were easier to maintain and more reliable compared with the other versions. However, the U-boat versions had several disadvantages, the smaller dimension of the antenna and the height of the antenna installation. The antenna was restricted to a smaller dimension as it had to fit within a small area on the port side of the conning tower. In addition, the reduced height of the antenna installation impaired the range. Both U-boat versions had ranges of between for naval targets and between at an altitude of .cdvandt.org Resolution was about 3 degrees, and at short range its range accuracy was . Both U-boat versions worked at a frequency 556 MHz and had four rows of six dipoles. Before the U-boat could dive, the antenna needed to be retracted into a well on the conning tower. Both U-boat antenna versions were wide by in height, and total overall dimensions of the antenna frame was . There are two types of radar transmitter for the FuMO-61 Hohentwiel U and FuMO-65 Hohentwiel U1, the Type F431 C1 and the Type F432 D2. The Type F431 C1 was used on the Type VII and the Type F432 D2 on the Type XXI.

Beginning March 1944, it began to be installed on Type VII and Type IX. FuMO 63 Hohentwiel K The FuMO 63 Hohentwiel K became available at the beginning of 1944. It was fitted to the foremast and mainmast of surface warships. FuMO 65 Hohentwiel U1 The FuMO 65 Hohentwiel U1 was the marine version of the FuG 200 Hohentwiel used by the Kriegsmarine only on Type XXI U-boats. The FuMO 65 Hohentwiel U1 had an updated radar display over the older FuMO 61 Hohentwiel U, it had a Plan position indicator display, known to the Germans as Drauf.

Local Artin conductors Suppose that L is a finite Galois extension of the local field K, with Galois group G. If \\\\chi is a character of G, then the Artin conductor of \\\\chi is the number :f(\\\\chi)=\\\\sum_{i\\\\ge 0}\\\\frac{g_i}{g_0}(\\\\chi(1)-\\\\chi(G_i)) where Gi is the i-th ramification group (in lower numbering), of order gi, and œá(Gi) is the average value of \\\\chi on Gi.Serre (1967) p.158 By a result of Artin, the local conductor is an integer.Serre (1967) p.159 Heuristically, the Artin conductor measures how far the action of the higher ramification groups is from being trivial. In particular, if œá is unramified, then its Artin conductor is zero. Thus if L is unramified over K, then the Artin conductors of all œá are zero. The wild invariant or Swan conductorSnaith (1994) p.249 of the character is : f(\\\\chi) - (\\\\chi(1)-\\\\chi(G_0)), in other words, the sum of the higher order terms with i > 0. Global Artin conductors The global Artin conductor of a representation \\\\chi of the Galois group G of a finite extension L/K of global fields is an ideal of K, defined to be :\\\\mathfrak{f}(\\\\chi) = \\\\prod_p p^{f(\\\\chi,p)} where the product is over the primes p of K, and f(œá,p) is the local Artin conductor of the restriction of \\\\chi to the decomposition group of some prime of L lying over p. Since the local Artin conductor is zero at unramified primes, the above product only need be taken over primes that ramify in L/K. Artin representation and Artin character Suppose that L is a finite Galois extension of the local field K, with Galois group G. The Artin character aG of G is the character :a_G=\\\\sum_\\\\chi f(\\\\chi)\\\\chi and the Artin representation AG is the complex linear representation of G with this character. asked for a direct construction of the Artin representation. showed that the Artin representation can be realized over the local field Ql, for any prime l not equal to the residue characteristic p. showed that it can be realized over the corresponding ring of Witt vectors. It cannot in general be realized over the rationals or over the local field Qp, suggesting that there is no easy way to construct the Artin representation explicitly.Serre (1967) p.160 Swan representation The Swan character swG is given by :sw_G= a_G -r_G+1 where rg is the character of the regular representation and 1 is the character of the trivial representation.Snaith (1994) p.248 The Swan character is the character of a representation of G. showed that there is a unique projective representation of G over the l-adic integers with character the Swan character. Applications The Artin conductor appears in the conductor- discriminant formula for the discriminant of a global field.Serre (1967) p.160 The optimal level in the Serre modularity conjecture is expressed in terms of the Artin conductor.

In his senior year, he visited the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA) and intended to talk to their crew team coach. However, he ran into UCLA assistant basketball coach Steve Lavin, who suggested Myers try out for the basketball team. College career Myers attended UCLA and majored in business and economics, making the Bruins basketball team under coach Jim Harrick as a walk-on in his freshman year in 1993. Myers figured he would be a four-year practice player, but he earned an athletic scholarship in 1994‚Äì95, when the Bruins won the national championship that season. He did not score until the final game of the regular season, and he only averaged 0.3 points that season. However, he was on the commemorative cover of Sports Illustrated, lifting teammate Tyus Edney in the air after the point guard made a legendary baseline-to-baseline winning basket with 4.8 seconds remaining in the game against Missouri in the tournament. Additionally, Myers met President Bill Clinton in the White House, appeared with Jay Leno on The Tonight Show, and rode with Mickey Mouse in a ticker tape parade at Disneyland. He was called Forrest Gump by teammates for his apparent good fortune. Myers' playing time steadily increased. By his junior year, he had added of muscle over two years and stood at and . Against Oregon State, Myers was the hero in the Bruins' 69‚Äì60 win after he established career highs in points (20) and minutes played (22). In his last season in 1996‚Äì97, UCLA advanced to the Elite Eight, and he even started a few games. \\"That‚Äôs another thing that I thought that I would never do,\\" Myers said. \\"It‚Äôs something that I will look back on and tell my kids and my grandkids: 'Yeah, I started a couple of games.'\\" He did not go to Europe to play basketball after college, which he later called his biggest disappointment. Sports agent career Myers was introduced to sports agent Arn Tellem by Harrick, and he began as an intern at Tellem and Associates in 1997 while completing his law degree at Loyola Law School. Myers grew to be one of Tellem's top associates, and became an expert in contract negotiation and player recruitment. In 2000, Tellem and Associates became SFX Sports, where Myers served as vice president. Myers spent 14 years as an agent, the last five with Wasserman Media Group, and he negotiated contracts totaling more than $575 million. He had 19 clients, including Brandon Roy, Tyreke Evans and Kendrick Perkins. Golden State Warriors Myers in 2011 interview In April 2011, Myers was hired by the Golden State Warriors as an assistant general manager. He was expected to apprentice under general manager Larry Riley for a few years. However, Myers was promoted to general manager after only 12 months. Under Myers, the Warriors had a strong draft in 2012 and made key acquisitions in 2012‚Äì13, and they advanced to the second round of the playoffs before losing to the San Antonio Spurs in six games. It was the Warriors' best postseason finish in 36 years. After the season, The Press Democrat wrote that Myers \\"made a bigger imprint than anyone else on this season's wonder team.\\" After the 2014-15 regular season, Myers was named the NBA Basketball Executive of the Year after key decisions he made led to the Warriors having an NBA best 67‚Äì15 record, including hiring coach Steve Kerr and signing Klay Thompson to a contract extension after declining to trade him and other players in the offseason for Kevin Love. Myers and the Warriors won the 2015 NBA Finals after defeating the Cleveland Cavaliers in six games. The Warriors came short of back-to-back titles in the 2015-16 season despite having an NBA-record 73-9 regular season, losing to the Cavaliers in seven games. Prior to 2016‚Äì17, the Warriors added president of basketball operations to Myers' title, which reported directly to majority owner Joe Lacob. Myers was again named NBA Executive of the Year after signing Kevin Durant, David West, Zaza Pachulia, and Javale McGee in the 2016 off-season. This was his second Executive of the Year Title in three years as the Warriors once again had a league-best 67-15 record. The Warriors won the 2017 NBA Finals after avenging their loss to the Cavaliers, this time in five games. The title was the team's second in three years, which included the league's best postseason record of 16-1, and the best start to the postseason at 15-0. The Warriors won back-to-back titles in the 2017-18 season after defeating the Cavaliers in four games in the 2018 NBA Finals. Personal life Myers and his wife, Kristen, have two daughters, Kayla and Annabelle.

Migration studies is an interdisciplinary field which draws on anthropology, prehistory, history, economics, law, sociology and postcolonial studies. Origin and development of migration studies Migration studies did not develop along a uni-linear path and it has developed with significantly different trajectories in different academic cultures and traditions. Migration studies does not exist as a self-contained discipline and instead finds its heritage in a variety of places. Developments in the sociology of migration, the study of the history of human migration, theories and policies concerning labour migration, and postcolonial studies all fed into the growth of migration studies. The development of migration studies is also bound up with the growth in interdisciplinary pursuits which has resulted from the popularisation of postmodern thought in the past thirty years. In recent years, scholarship which takes interest in humanitarian issues has become increasingly popular. In part, this reflects displacement and refugee movements which have resulted from conflicts throughout the end of the 20th century and at the turn of the 21st century. Key topics in migration studies Migration histories Archaeological studies frequently focus on early human migration flows, the spread of civilisation and the development of trade routes and settlements by early humans. The debate over migrationism and diffusionism features prominently in archaeological approaches to migration studies. The study of empire, colonisation, and diaspora constitute significant themes in historical approaches to migration studies. This has, for instance, manifested in studies of the forced migrations during the 1947 Partition of India,Riggs, E. P., & Jat, Z. R. (2016). The 1947 partition of India and Pakistan: Migration, material landscapes, and the making of nations. Journal of Contemporary Archaeology, 3(2), 139-146.< the internal displacement of the 1861-1865 American Civil War, or the Great Migration of 6 million African Americans from the rural southern states to the urban Northeast, Midwest, and West.Silkenat, D. (2016). Driven from home, North Carolina's Civil War refugee crisis (Uncivil wars). Athens: The University of Georgia Press. Scholars can research migration histories through a variety of methods including quantitative approaches based on censuses and government documents, social histories, the examination of material culture, or through autobiography. Literature and the arts One branch of research in migration studies involves the consideration of how migration, settlement, and diaspora interact with literature and the arts. For example, in a 2017 paper Dr Michelle Keown discussed how US military imperialism and Marshallese migration affected the poetry of Kathy Jetnil-Kijiner.Keown, M. (2017). Children of Israel: US Military Imperialism and Marshallese Migration in the Poetry of Kathy Jetnil- Kijiner. Interventions, 19(7), 930-947. Researchers have also examined migration in relation to the circulation of music, particularly of folk- songs.Karimi, A. (2017). Medium of the Oppressed: Folk Music, Forced Migration, and Tactical Media. Communication, Culture & Critique, 10(4), 729-745. Migration is a recurring theme in much popular media, such as in Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie's 2013 novel Americanah or in contemporary film such as Roma (2018), consequently, discussions on migration and the arts are some of the more publicly-visible avenues of scholarship in migration studies. Urbanism Scholars of migration in the context of urbanism consider the dynamics of how cities and migrant populations interact. This can include issues of town planning, issues of ghettoisation and social exclusion, and processes of integration and community-building. Urbanists may also consider how one can regard refugee camps as global cities, and how to plan, develop, and operate these camp spaces. Economics The economic results of migration are a popular area of research and stimulate much consequent debate. Perhaps the most publicly-discussed topic within the economics of migration is transnational labour migration and how migrants are either encouraged or discouraged to move as a result of economic considerations, this remains a controversial and multifaceted topic. Migration is researched in relation to its impacts on both sending and destination communities. The study of how migrant workers send remittances is another frequent topic for scholars studying the economics of migration.Philpott, S. (1968). \\"Remittance Obligations, Social Networks and Choice Among Montserratian Migrants in Britain\\". Man, 3(3), 465-476. Some research has focused on novel topics including the internal economies of refugee camps,Ranalli, B. (2014). Local Currencies: A Potential Solution for Liquidity Problems in Refugee Camp Economies. Journal of Refugee Studies, 27(3), 422-433. the economics of human trafficking, and how employment law affects undocumented workers.Wheaton, E., Schauer, E., & Galli, T. (2010). Economics of Human Trafficking. International Migration, 48(4), 114-141.Inghammar, A. (2010). The Employment Contract Revisited. Undocumented Migrant Workers and the Intersection between International Standards, Immigration Policy and Employment Law. European Journal of Migration and Law, 12(2), 193-214. Demography Studies of migration demography take a statistical approach to the size, structure, and distribution of migrant populations. One can research migrant communities either in isolation or as part of a broader population. Demographic studies of migration often consider issues such as migrant health, welfare, employment, and education in relation to the non-migrant population of a given society. Public attitudes Migration scholars investigate migrant reception through surveying and studying how host populations understand and respond to immigration. This might include feelings concerning refugee reception and support, considerations of multiculturalism and integration, and attitudes towards government policies. Frequently, scholars investigate how non-migrant publics consider migrants, this has resulted in a relative lack of scholarship which considers the opposite dynamic. Critical border studies Critical border studies (CBS) explores alternatives to how territorial borders are currently imagined and operated. Part of this approach means identifying and investigating how borders function, to whose benefit these borders function, and whom such borders affect negatively.Parker, N., & Vaughan-Williams, N. (2012). Critical border studies: Broadening and deepening the 'Lines in the Sand' Agenda. Geopolitics, 17(4), 727-733. Scholars associated with critical border studies regard borders as part of a system of performances by which states maintain and exert power over territory; this intersects with understandings of sovereignty and securitization. Scholars associated with this branch of migration studies are frequently critical of how states may rely on a monopoly of force to assert governance over given territories, consequently strains of anarchist philosophy, postcolonial thought, and anti- statism are popular within critical border studies.Bluff, Rachel. (2000). Internal Frontiers, Transnational Politics, 1945-65: Im/migration policy as World Domination. in R. C. King. (ed.) Postcolonial America. University of Illinois Press, Urbana. pp.122-153. Immigration law Immigration law necessarily affects many subsections of migration studies and it is consequently a point of interest for a wide range of migration scholars. One can approach the subject of immigration law through sub-national, national, and international frameworks. The study of immigration law frequently intersects with discussions of human rights. =Migrant il/legality and \\"crimmigration\\" = In common with approaches found in critical border studies, many scholars consider how systems which govern migration construct illegality and thereby criminalise migrant populations.Sharpless, Rebecca. (2016). Immigrants are Not Criminals: Respectability, Immigration Reform, and Hyperincarceration. Houston Law Review, 691. pp. 691-794.Menjivar, Cecilia and Kanstroom, Daniel. (2014). \\"Constructing Immigrant 'Illegality': Critiques, Experiences, and Responses\\". New York: Cambridge University Press. This approach displaces the discussion of illegality from the migrant subject and instead scrutinises the behaviour of nation-state governments.Nyers, Peter. (2010). \\"No One is Illegal between City and Nation\\", Studies in Social Justice. 4(2), pp. 127‚Äì143. Critical approaches to the construction of citizenship recur within this strand of scholarship.McNevin, Anne. (2012) \\"Undocumented Citizens? Shifting grounds of citizenship in Los Angeles\\". In Peter Nyers and Kim Rygiel, eds., Citizenship, Migrant Activism and the Politics of Movement. London: Routledge. pp. 165-183. This approach to understanding migration is particularly relevant for scholars working on issues involving undocumented populations. The term \\"crimmigration\\" has emerged as a way to conceptualize how migrants are frequently treated as criminals, deviants, and security risks. Displacement =Forced migration= Forced migration is the coerced movement of humans from their origin to a (frequently undesired) new destination. Studies concerning forced migration explore the processes by which people are displaced, how destination countries receive and support displaced people, and the experiences of forced migrations. Studies concerning forced migration frequently overlap with issues concerning genocide studies, settler colonialism, humanitarianism, deportation and ethnic cleansing. The term \\"forced\\" is frequently debated for its suggestion that there is a clear distinction between voluntary and involuntary human movement. =Refugee studies= Scholars focusing on refugee studies typically consider the experiences of people affected by transnational forced- migration processes. The definition of a refugee varies considerably within the refugee-studies community, with some insisting on the strict definitions of 1951 Convention Relating to the Status of Refugees and others relying on more fluid or amorphous definitions. Refugee studies represent a distinct overarching group within migration studies as it differs significantly from the topics which are central to more voluntary phenomena such as labour-market migration. The concept of refugees as weapons is analyzed as a forced experience of a mass exodus of refugees from a state to a hostile state as a \\"weapon.\\" =Internal displacement= Internally displaced persons have been compelled to move from their origin but have not crossed national boundaries. This means that they do not meet the Convention Relating to the Status of Refugees definition of a refugee, even though they may have similar experiences, and though the conditions which led to their displacement may closely resemble those which provoke refugee movements. Studies on internal displacement frequently focus on the complications raised by the fact that such migrants are not supported by the same international frameworks which can provide for refugees and other transnational migrants. =Climate change and environmental factors= Scholars increasingly study how climate change is interacting with human migration, something which is discussed to a much greater extent in relation to migrating animals. Key issues in studies of climate change and migration revolve around how climate change will affect coastal communities, small-island nations, and communities living in areas likely to become deserts.Miller, D. (2017). Climate Refugees and the Human Cost of Global Climate Change. Environmental Justice, 10(4), 89-92. Essentially, this topic considers how climate change may cause large-scale human movement. The idea of \\"climate refugees\\" is a key focus of debate within this topic, particularly as this brings a novel category to established understandings of refugee status.Bettini, G. (2013). \\"Climate Barbarians at the Gate? A critique of apocalyptic narratives on 'climate refugees'\\". Geoforum, 45, 63-72. Beyond climate change, there is a long history of human migration because of other environmental factors. Studies concerned with early human migrations frequently consider how humanity responded to issues such as adapting to the harsh cold of the Late Pleistocene. Gender and sexuality =Gender= Scholars focusing on gender consider how gender structures migrant experience, the treatment and reception of migrants, and how migration interacts with the performance of gender. Contemporary treatments of migration and gender tend to take an intersectional approach where gender is part of a dynamic set of identities including class, race, age, and health.Amelina, Anna, & Lutz, Helma. (2018). Gender and migration, transnational and intersectional prospects (Routledge research in gender and society 73). London: Routledge. Studies which consider gendered experiences of migration look at topics such as gender-based violence against migrant populations, gendered differences in asylum and detention processes, and how family dynamics are affected by migration processes. =Queer migration= Scholars influenced by approaches from the growing field of Queer studies explore how queer sexualities affect understandings of migration. One approach involves critically engaging with \\"the intersectionality of nationality and sexuality, [to show] how national norms and values can be used instrumentally by social and political actors\\" to affect human movement.Mole, R. (2018). Sexualities and queer migration research. Sexualities, 21(8), 1268-1270. For example, topics in Queer migration might include how LGBT+ asylum seekers are differently affected by asylum processes, how discrimination against LGBT+ people affects their migration experiences, or how migrant welfare is stratified according to sexuality. Humanitarianism A recent trend in migration studies scholarship has been to critically evaluate how humanitarian actors interact with immigrants, particularly in the context of conflict environments, disaster relief, and crises. The refugee camp has become a significant point of interest for scholars working on the intersection of migration and humanitarianism, especially in relation to biopower.Turner, S. (2016). What Is a Refugee Camp? Explorations of the Limits and Effects of the Camp. Journal of Refugee Studies, 29(2), 139-148. Recently, there have been increased efforts to critically engage with how humanitarian actors deliver aid and the ethics of humanitarianism in the context of migration.Fassin, Didier. (2011). Noli Me Tangere: The Moral Untouchability of Humanitarianism. In Erica Bornstein and Peter Redfield, eds., Forces of Compassion: Humanitarianism Between Ethics and Politics. Santa Fe: School for Advanced Research Press, pp. 35-52 This criticism of humanitarian actors has led to discussions of the links between carceral systems and humanitarianism. Epidemiology In epidemiology, an \\"immigration study\\" is a method of understanding the relative importance of inherited genetics and environmental factor in medical conditions whose incidence varies around the world. It examines the incidence of conditions in populations who have moved (or whose recent ancestors have moved) between places at different rates. Often the immigrant population can be shown to have similar rates to the population of the new location, suggesting that environmental factors such as diet, obesity and exercise are the dominant determinants.  Assimilation  The ethics of researching migration Research on human migration may be used to enforce or inform the strategies of national governments and law enforcement bodies. For instance, studying how undocumented immigrants access healthcare may enable a government to clamp down on these practices, or critical studies of clandestine migration may inform border securitisation policies which might restrict those same migration flows. Furthermore, migrants frequently represent vulnerable or marginalised subjects and scholarly research into migrant groups might compound or worsen conditions for these groups. The ethics of how to navigate the tensions and questions raised by carrying out research on migration, and the consequences of investigating sensitive topics within migration studies, are becoming an increasingly discussed topic.Elena Fiddian-Qasmiyeh, The Ethics of Migration Research Methodology: Dealing with Vulnerable Migrants. Edited by Ilse Van Liempt and Veronika Bilger., Journal of Refugee Studies, Volume 24, Issue 1, March 2011, Pages 211‚Äì213 This is part of a broader development of greater reflexivity regarding research ethics in the social sciences. Teaching Migration studies is a relatively new specialism, consequently many universities and colleges have yet to develop degree programmes which formally address the topic.Martin, S. (2017). Teaching migration studies migration and refugee studies: A US perspective. Migration Studies, 5(1), 136-139. Whilst migration studies rarely exist as an available major for undergraduate study, Master's degrees which focus on migration and international movement are increasingly available. However, the availability of this focus varies greatly by region and academic culture. At present, most teaching of migration studies as a distinct topic is focused in European universities.Martin, S. (2017). Teaching migration studies migration and refugee studies: A US perspective. Migration Studies, 5(1), 136-139. Europe In Europe, the University of Copenhagen, Aalborg University, Malm√∂ University, Utrecht University, Radboud University Nijmegen, Universit√© de Li√®ge, University of C√¥te d'Azur Link√∂ping University, University of Neuch√¢tel, Universit√§t Osnabr√ºck, University of A Coru√±a, The University of Sussex, University of Riga, University of Deusto, The University of Oxford, and the University of Kent (Brussels School of International Studies) all offer graduate training in migration studies.https://amis.ku.dk/https://www.en.aau.dk/education/master/development- international-relations/specialisations/global-refugee- studieshttps://mau.se/en/research/research-centres/malmo-institute-for- studies-of-migration-diversity-and- welfare/https://www.sussex.ac.uk/study/masters/courses/migration-studies- mahttps://www.ox.ac.uk/admissions/graduate/courses/msc-migration- studies?wssl=1https://www.kent.ac.uk/courses/postgraduate/56/international- migrationhttps://www.uu.nl/masters/en/migration-ethnic-relations- andhttps://www.ru.nl/english/education/masters/globalisation-migration-and- development/http://univ-cotedazur.fr/en/education/trouver-sa- formation-1/masters/parcours/migration- studies/https://www.deusto.es/cs/Satellite/deusto/en/masters/studies- masters/master-in-international-migrations-and-social-cohesion- misoco-0/programa As of 2017, several of these universities work collaboratively to provide a single degree which can be acquired through work at multiple participating institutions.https://www.eumigs.eu/master- programmeshttps://www.deusto.es/cs/Satellite/deusto/en/masters/studies- masters/master-in-international-migrations-and-social-cohesion- misoco-0/programa This represents teaching in Denmark, Sweden, Norway, Germany, the United Kingdom, the Netherlands, France, Latvia, and Spain. Africa Few African universities offer an explicit focus on migration studies, however programmes are available in South Africa,Egypt and Ghana. The University of the Witwatersrand offers degree programmes in migration studies at both undergraduate and graduate levels.http://www.migration.org.za/degrees- courses-overview/ The American University in Cairo currently offers a Master's degree in migration and refugee studies.http://catalog.aucegypt.edu/preview_program.php?catoid=20&poid;=3004University of Ghana runs a Master's degree and PhD programme in migration studies through their Centre for Migration Studies.http://cms.ug.edu.gh/ North America =United States of America= Universities and colleges in the United States have been slow to develop degree programmes which explicitly focus on migration studies and have lagged behind European institutions in this regard.Martin, S. (2017). Teaching migration studies migration and refugee studies: A US perspective. Migration Studies, 5(1), 136-139. Whilst there has been a growth in migration studies within disciplines, there has not been the same attention to interdisciplinary approaches or the establishment of migration studies as a freestanding field.Martin, S. (2017). Teaching migration studies migration and refugee studies: A US perspective. Migration Studies, 5(1), 136-139. PhD programmes which focus on migration studies are very rare, however, The University of San Francisco, DePaul University, and City University of New York offer terminal Master's degrees in migration studies. Migration studies are increasingly available as an undergraduate minor-subject, with the University of California San Diego among the first to offer such a minor https://ccis.ucsd.edu/programs/index.html. Since 2015 https://dailybruin.com/2015/09/29/international-institute-launches-new- program-with-lecture-on-migration, the University of California Los Angeles also offers a minor in International Migration Studies https://www.international.ucla.edu/academics/internationalmigrationstudies. Much teaching on international migration in the United States is instead framed as ethnic studies, Latin American studies. or Border Studies. Migration is also frequently available as a specialisation within sociology, economics, and political science degree programmes. Diasporic identity and the history and consequences of human movement are also extensively explored in African American studies or Africana studies programmes. =Canada= In Canada, Ryerson University has developed a graduate programme in Immigration and Settlement studies whereas Carleton University offers an undergraduate degree in Migration and Diaspora Studies.https://carleton.ca/mds/ https://www.ryerson.ca/graduate/programs/immigration/ Similarly to the situation in the United States, Canadian universities frequently address the study of migration as a topic within other disciplines rather than as a field in its own right. Thus, whilst there may be few programmes which explicitly address migration in their titles, there is still a broad range on research and teaching on the topic through other avenues. South and Central America Few universities in South and Central America offer named programmes in migration studies. In Mexico, Universidad Iberoamericana co- delivers a Master's programme with the University of San Francisco through an optional exchange semester.https://www.usfca.edu/arts-sciences/graduate- programs/migration-studies/program-details. Asia Tel Aviv University offers a terminal master's degree in Global Migration & Policy.https://international.tau.ac.il/ma_global_migration_and_policy Central University of Gujarat offers a Master's and PhD in Diaspora studies.http://www.cug.ac.in/academic_programmes/c_sllcs_ds.php In the Philippines, Miriam College offers an MA in migration studies.http://www.unescogym.org/?topic=migration-studies#list In Nepal, migration is included in the graduate programmes in population studies at Tribhuvan University. Similarly, in Sri Lanka at the University of Colombo the graduate programs in demography give significant attention to the study of migration.https://arts.cmb.ac.lk/demo/National University of Singapore has a migration studies research cluster located in its Faculty of Arts and Social Sciences, however, does not offer a degree programme on this topic.https://www.fas.nus.edu.sg/researchclusters/migration.html Similarly, the Chinese University of Hong Kong hosts a research centre on migration and mobility but does not operate a degree programme.http://www.cuhk.edu.hk/rcmm/ In Russia, no university offers a degree in migration studies, however, the Higher School of Economics organises a regular seminar on migration studies through its Institute for Social Policy.https://isp.hse.ru/en/seminar Antipodes =Australia= The University of Melbourne offers graduate training in migration studies through an interdisciplinary PhD programme.https://study.unimelb.edu.au/find/courses/specialisation/refugee- and-forced-migration/ The Australian Catholic University has developed a graduate diploma in Australian Migration Law and Practice.https://www.acu.edu.au/study-at-acu/find-a-course/law/graduate- diploma-in-australian-migration-law-and-practice The University of Sydney and University of Queensland do not offer degree programmes in migration studies, however both universities have dedicated research clusters and teach modules on topics within migration studies.https://sydney.edu.au/arts/our- research/centres-institutes-and-groups/sydney-asia-pacific-migration- centre.htmlhttps://my.uq.edu.au/programs- courses/course.html?course_code=ANTH2270 =New Zealand= Victoria University Wellington offers a Master's programme in Migration Studies, alongside a postgraduate diploma, or postgraduate certificate.https://www.victoria.ac.nz/explore/postgraduate-programmes/master- of-migration-studies-and-related-programmes/overview?programme=master-of- migration-studies The Centre for Global Migrations at University of Otago addresses issues and themes in migration studies, and The University of Waikato used to host a Migration Research Group from 1993 to 2009, neither university offers a degree in migration studies.https://www.waikato.ac.nz/nidea/about-us/our-history/migration- research-grouphttps://www.otago.ac.nz/global-migrations/index.html Research activity, publications, and outreach Journals As a rapidly growing field of study, there are numerous journals dedicated to migration studies.

It was discovered on 31 December 1975, by Argentine astronomer Mario R. Cesco at the El Leoncito Complex in western Argentina. It was named in memory of Argentine political activist Ana Diego.  Orbit and classification  Anadiego orbits the Sun in the central main-belt at a distance of 1.9‚Äì3.2 AU once every 4 years and 1 month (1,498 days). Its orbit has an eccentricity of 0.26 and an inclination of 12¬∞ with respect to the ecliptic. As no precoveries were taken, the asteroid's observation arc starts with its discovery observation in 1975.  Physical characteristics  Anadiego has been characterized as a common S-type asteroid by Pan-STARRS photometric survey.  Rotation period  A rotational lightcurve was obtained for this asteroid by astronomer Kevin Hills at the Australian Riverland Dingo Observatory in February 2013. It gave a rotation period of hours with a brightness variation of 0.11 magnitude ().  Diameter and albedo  According to the surveys carried out by NASA's Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer with its subsequent NEOWISE mission, Anadiego measures 6.8 and 7.3 kilometers in diameter and its surface has an albedo of 0.287 and 0.254, respectively. The Collaborative Asteroid Lightcurve Link assumes a lower standard albedo for stony asteroids of 0.20, and, correspondingly calculates a larger diameter of 8.2 kilometers with an absolute magnitude of 12.8.  Naming  This minor planet was named in memory of Ana Teresa Diego (1954‚Äì1976), an astronomy student at La Plata Astronomical Observatory and political activist, who was kidnapped and disappeared in September 1976, by unidentified persons believed working for the military junta then ruling Argentina. The approved naming citation was published by the Minor Planet Center 10 December 2011 ().

She won the 1972 Single-Handed Trans-Atlantic Race, skippered by Alain Colas, and was lost at sea with Colas during the first ‚ÄúRoute du Rhum‚Äù transatlantic solo race in 1978. Construction Pen Duick IV was the brainchild of √âric Tabarly, who had sailed in 1966 on a small trimaran designed by architect Derek Kelsall and had become convinced that multihulls had finally made decisive progress in being competitive in all wind situations. Looking to repeat his 1964 win, Tabarly commissioned Pen Duick IV for the 1968 Single- Handed Trans-Atlantic Race on a design by French architect Andr√© All√®gre. With composite materials still in their infancy, Pen Duick IV's hulls were made of AG4 aluminium alloy. Unlike the present multihulls, which have flotation compartments or materials in the hulls to make them unsinkable, Pen Duick IV only featured foam filling in some of its compartments. This setup nonetheless proved adequate to keep the boat afloat when Tabarly collided with a cargo on the first night of the 1968 OSTAR and managed to limp back to England with structural damage. The hulls were linked by a tubular steel frame. Pen Duick IV was a pure racing machine, with Spartan amenities and even an unpainted hull that soon earned her the nickname \\"la pieuvre d‚Äôaluminium\\" (the aluminum octopus). It was designed for single-handed sailing and could be raced at its full potential with as few as three crew. Tabarly rigged the boat as a Marconi ketch (Bermuda rig) on the basis of his 1964 win with the same rig on Pen Duick II. However, Pen Duick IV featured another radical innovation in the form of swiveling masts, decades before the technology became mainstream. These masts did eventually prove too weak and were soon replaced with conventional ones. Construction started in 1967 at La Perri√®re shipyard in Lorient, France.http://www.citevoile-tabarly.com/eric-tabarly Work was slowed down by the social unrest of May 1968 and the boat was finished only two weeks before the start of the OSTAR. After Alain Colas bought Pen Duick IV from Tabarly in 1970, he eventually carried out extensive modifications in 1973 to better handle the Southern Ocean in his upcoming round-the-world record attempt. Larger masts and a second forward cross-member were fitted, the front hulls were widened, the boat was painted for the first time and was renamed Manureva. No other major modifications would be carried out before the boat was lost at sea. Racing history Despite its lack of readiness, Pen Duick IV showed such speed in its accelerated trials before the 1968 OSTAR that Tabarly had high hopes of a win. However, a collision with a cargo on the first night put an early end to the dream. Tabarly ran a few other Atlantic races that year but had to retire after dismasting. He then decided to participate in two Pacific races in 1969: San Francisco to Tokyo on a new Pen Duick V and the Transpacific Yacht Race immediately afterwards on Pen Duick IV. To this end, he sailed the trimaran to San Francisco through the Panama Canal in the spring of 1969. Tabarly was not aware that multihulls were not eligible to participate in the Transpac but shadowed the race anyway, starting with the official participants. With Alain Colas and Olivier de Kersauson as crew, he finished more than 20 hours ahead of official winner Blackfin and set an unofficial course record of 8 days, 13 hours. Colas bought Pen Duick IV from Tabarly in 1970 and sailed it back to France single-handed in order to gain experience for the 1972 Single-Handed Trans-Atlantic Race. The preparation paid off, Colas and Pen Duick IV won the OSTAR handily. On the way back to France, Colas attempted to break the record set in 1905 by Atlantic but fell short with a time of 17 days and 8 hours, more than five days off the markhttps://www.ultimboat.com/pen-duick. After refitting the boat and renaming her Manureva, Colas embarked in 1973 on an attempt to break the record for a single-handed circumnavigation with a stop in Sydney and succeeded, completing the journey in 169 days at sea. For the 1976 OSTAR, Colas commissioned the purpose-built Club M√©diterran√©e. His brother Jean-Fran√ßois entered to run on Manureva but was unable to participate due to damage to one of the hullshttp://www.alain-colas.com/Alain-Colas/Bateau.html. Disappearance Colas returned to Manureva for the first edition of the Route du Rhum in 1978. This race runs on a great circle route from Saint-Malo (France) to Pointe-√†- Pitre (Guadeloupe, France) and takes place every four years, in the month of November. After the start on 5 November, and after having passed the Azores on the 16th, the skipper sent his last radio message in which he reported that he was having a good trip. He was sailing at the head of the race, among the leaders, but was lost at sea with his boat. Song A song \\"\\" was written by Serge Gainsbourg in French and interpreted by Alain Chamfort, in tribute to the trimaran and its skipper. The song was released as a single on 15 September 1979, and on the album ' later the same year. It is one of Alain Chamfort‚Äôs greatest successes. The song also boosted the fame of the trimaran.

Marcel Bon published the genus validly in 1986. Molecular analyses revealed that Hemipholiota was distinct from Pholiota and also from a new genus Hemistropharia that had been classified with Hemipholiota.

Thomas had actually been born in Kuwait, the son of Christian, Malayalam-speaking guest workers from India's southern Kerala state. Being Indian by birth, born in Kuwait, naturalized in the US, and raised primarily between India and the United States, he has always felt outside the dominant culture in which he exists. This sense of being the ‚ÄòOther‚Äô has influenced how he views the world, approaches his conceptual concerns, and creates art. With an educational background and degrees in both psychology and art, he investigates and deconstructs complex sociopolitical issues from the interstices in personally expressive ways that humanize his subjects by incorporating a variety of photographic, video, drawing, and installation techniques into his artwork.https://www.artprize.org/prince-thomas Thomas currently resides in Houston, Texas. He is an associate professor of art at Lamar University in Beaumont, Texas. He is represented by Hooks-Epstein Galleries in Houston, Texas. Education Thomas received his B.A. in psychology from the University of Texas at Arlington, and M.F.A. from the University of Houston. Major works That Was Then (2014) That Was Then is a Single Channel Video with the actual audio reporting of the first hours of Operation Desert Storm on CNN. It takes the viewer through the initial bombing stage of Baghdad in 1991 with reporters Peter Arnett, Bernard Shaw, and John Holliman. The live coverage was significant because it was unedited and established CNN as a credible news agency. It also established the notion of 24-hour news as a viable business model. Prince Thomas remembered as a young man watching the CNN footage and thinking, like most Americans, that the footage looked like a video game. It looked hyper-real. He synched this audio with video footage he recorded from a Fourth of July fireworks display to comment on the close link between the past and present.http://www.artprize.org/prince-thomas/2015/that-was-then *This video was selected as the juried award winner at ArtPrize 7 in the Time-Based category in 2015. It was selected by Time-Based juror Shari Frilot, Los Angeles-based Senior Programmer of Sundance Film Festival and Curator of New Frontier at Sundance. Frilot pointed to the deceptive simplicity of Thomas‚Äô piece, saying ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a simple juxtaposition of a fireworks show and the CNN coverage of the first gulf war attack, but as the piece goes on it expresses how war is narrativized, not only in contemporary warfare but in the way we celebrate war. The piece links its critique and message to something that we kind of universally relate to in America - because we‚Äôve experienced it.‚Äùhttp://www.kcad.edu/news/kcad-community-wins-big-at-artprize-2015-awards/ Body Count (2008-2012) Body Count is a project that seeks to question the value of civilian life in times of warfare. This piece focuses on civilian deaths that are a direct result of US involvement in Iraq. Thomas chose to use the conservative numbers being collected by the Iraq Body Count project (IBC), whose numbers come from verifiable civilian deaths reported to the media, as the basis for this piece. As the viewer enters the space, on white tables stacked in rows of 25, sits over 109,000 US pennies all painted white. Each US penny represents one civilian life. A single penny in its own right is very insignificant and devoid of any real value. And, like pennies being thrown into a jar at the end of a day, the total deaths in any given day of war can be easily processed, reconciled, and forgotten. But to be confronted by the vast numbers all at once is a far more difficult thing to ignore and, I hope, an emotionally arresting experience. This piece is also intended to subtly question the relationship between commerce and war as was questioned by President Eisenhower in describing the Military/Industrial Complex. The counting system for this piece is as follows: each stack of pennies equates to 25 lives; one gap between the stacks of pennies indicates a separation of months; and two gaps indicate a separation of years.http://www.stationmuseum.com/index.php/exhibitions/19-exhibitions/132-hx8-prince- varughese-thomas K.I.A. (2012) K.I.A. is an ongoing series of works on paper that seeks to raise awareness of the incredible number of US lives that have been lost through warfare. This series focuses on US soldiers that have been killed in action since the start of the second gulf war. Each work focuses on a specific state in the United States and the soldiers that have died in action from that particular state. In a predefined area on a piece of Arches watercolor paper, Prince Thomas intuitively begins writing each soldier's name who has been killed in action. The density of the drawing increases as one soldier's name is written over another. The dense black areas in the drawing are thereby created by writing each individuals name over another reflecting the sheer numbers of people that have been affected by war. The drawing is finished when the last soldier's name is written on the paper. The title of each piece reflects the US state from which the soldiers originated (e.g. California, Texas, Alabama, etc.).http://www.stationmuseum.com/index.php/exhibitions/19-exhibitions/132-hx8-prince- varughese-thomas * When exhibited in Asia Society Texas Center's exhibition Site Lines, Houston Chronicle writer Molly Glentzer wrote, \\"'K.I.A. (Texas)' memorializes 427 Texas-based soldiers who have died in Iraq. Their names are layered to the point of abstraction, held within a circle that evokes a Zen Buddhist enso, a symbol that can refer both to enlightenment and a void.\\" On Joy, On Sorrow (2009) ‚Äò‚ÄôOn Joy, On Sorrow‚Äô‚Äô is a two-channel video displayed separately across from one another, creating a visual and auditory dialog. The video juxtaposes two abstractly conveyed interdependent emotions. The work is personal and stems from events in Thomas‚Äôs life that have led him to recognize the threads that run between both emotions. It is inspired by poet Kahlil Gibran‚Äôs quote, ‚ÄúYour joy is your sorrow unmasked‚Äù. The original music is scored in collaboration with composer, Joel Love. *\\"One water-like fluid rhythmically falls like rain while the other blood-like reacts like two slow motion flickering candle flames. They are reminiscent of Bill Viola¬¥s videos with fire and water but without the human form. One screen seems to initially evoke joy and then moves into sorrow; while the other begins more sorrowfully and moves towards joy, though the ambiguity of the piece leaves this interpretation open.\\"https://hcponline.org/calendar.asp?show=346&calid;=293 *\\"The flame vacillates between threatening to be snuffed out and spinning ecstatically like a whirling dervish; the water shifts between drizzle, downpour and dissipation.

Through this transition in our lives, I have been keenly aware of the changes that come with the process of aging. I am using this experience to create a body of work that speaks to what I can best describe as the Doctrine of Impermanence. The Impermanence Doctrine states that all aspects of the world are in a process of constant change. Life embodies change through the process of aging, the cycle of birth and rebirth, and in every loss that we experience. Due to the impermanent nature of all things, having attachments to them is futile and only leads to pain and suffering. Reflections in water, like the landscape, are constantly in flux and never remain the same for very long. I feel that the intangible nature of the landscape and its reflection is my honest and direct response to conveying the idea of impermanence. The series Liquid Sky represents a combination of Digital and Alternative Processes Photography. Unlike my previous projects, in this series I am working from a traditional straight photographic shooting method. The formal content of the images in this series are exactly the same as when I shot them through the camera lens.

It accounted for about 13.6% of the Dagupan City's population. It is also one of the Barangays of which the famous Bonuan Boneless Bangus is homed. History Bonuan Gueset became a Barangay by a virtue Republic Act No. 171, authored by Speaker Perez. It was signed into law by President Sergio Osme√±a, Sr. on June 20, 1934. Geography Bonuan Gueset lies along the northern coastal borders of Dagupan City. It is deadlocked by bodies of water with only the North Eastern margin as its inland flank. Dagupan City's main river channel, Pantal River which passes by the Western margin of Bonuan, drains into the Lingayen Gulf. Bonuan is connected to downtown Dagupan by Dawel Bridge which transects Dawel River, a tributary to Pantal River. Much of the fishpond nestled within Bonuan is located in Bonuan Gueset. It is bounded by Barangay Pantal in South and Barangay Bonuan Binloc in North East. It is also a passageway to come up in San Fabian, Pangasinan. Many travelers to North from Dagupan City and nearby towns take a shortcut in Bonuan & Bonuan Gueset as its entrance. Description and Landmarks It is also where the prominent and historical parks of Dagupan City are located. The Parks include the Tondaligan People's Park, Japan-Philippine Friendship Garden, and Pangasinan Phil. Veteran's park Gen. McArthur Statue's site. There are also Government establishments located in Bonuan Gueset, namely, The Central Bank of the Philippines, PAGASA, Justice Hall, Dagupan City Jail, and the Delta Camp of the Philippine Navy. Bonuan Gueset is one of the most urbanized residential zones in Dagupan City. It hosts the biggest supermarket chain in the country - Puregold, which is located at the heart of the Barangay. 7-Eleven on the other hand, opened its 1st store at the Bonuan Gueset main intersection, side by side with Bonuan church and seminary, talipapa area, numerous restaurants and public/private schools, making the heavily commercialized area a mini \\"downtown\\", a unique feature in this part of the city. Gasoline stations, such as big players Petron, Caltex, and local-based Amigo Gas established their outlets in several strategic points of the barangay. The old Amigo Gasoline Service Station was demolished mid-2017 to pave way for a Bonuan Gueset branch of CSI Supermaket, on the intersection of Paras Street near Talipapa corner. The supermarket opened in mid-2018. Numerous gated communities also dot the barangay to cater to the city's suburban housing needs. World-class gated neighborhood such as San Marino Place is situated at the barangay's entrance, with most of its land were reclaimed beside the Dawel river banks. The biggest gated community in the city - Tondaligan Blue Beach Subdivision - is situated near the historic coast of Bonuan Blue Beach.

Siku's mother, Ilka, had no milk in her breasts for the third year running, and so the park decided to \\"immobilize\\" her. According to park manager Frank Vigh-Larsen, Siku weighed three pounds (1.8 kg) at birth, but grew within his first month to seven pounds' (3.2 kg) weight.\\"Abandoned polar bear cub Siku is set to be internet sensation\\".

Receiving insufficient milk from Ilka, Siku was revealed on surveillance video inside the bear cave to be \\"moaning and being unruly all the time.\\" At two days old, he was removed from his mother, as remaining with her could have endangered his life. His mother's defaulting on milk orphaned him, so that he required foster care, a type of ex-situ conservation.

However, Vigh-Larsen emphasizes that he does not want Siku to be too heavily compared to Knut, to deter extensive merchandise production and huge numbers of visitors: \\"What happened to Knut was a disaster. He was used in order to sell teddy-bears and tickets. Therefore we are doing everything we can in order to distance Siku from Knut as much as possible,\\" he stresses.

The painting depicts William Penn entering into the Treaty of Shackamaxon in 1683 with Tamanend, a chief of the Lenape (\\"Delaware Indians\\") Turtle Clan, under the shade of an elm tree near the village of Shackamaxon (now Kensington) in Pennsylvania. The peace between the Lenape Turtle Clan and Penn's successors would endure for over 70 years, until the Penn's Creek Massacre of 1755.Penn Treaty Museum The treaty William Penn entered into was remarked upon by Voltaire, who called it \\"... the only treaty never sworn to and never broken.\\" Voltaire, in \\"The History of the Quakers\\" in The Works of Voltaire (1762), Vol 13, as translated by Tobias George Smollett, Thomas Francklin, et al., later published as \\"The Religion of the Quakers\\", in The Works of Voltaire: A Contemporary Version with Notes (1901), Vol. 33, as modernized by William F. Fleming Painting The painting was commissioned by Thomas Penn ‚Äì William Penn's son ‚Äì in 1770 or 1771 and completed in 1771‚Äì72. West was a local artist who was born in Springfield, Pennsylvania and grew up in Swarthmore, Pennsylvania. Like Thomas Penn, West was born into a Quaker family. Also like Thomas Penn, he later turned to the Church of England, however. He studied in Philadelphia but developed as a painter of historic subjects in London, where he was the second president of the Royal Academy of Arts. His reputation for history painting was established in the early 1770s with his painting of The Death of General Wolfe. For the image of William Penn, West copied a relief portrait made from memory by Silvanius Bevan several years after Penn's death. West had no models for the Indian subjects, so used sketches of sculptures, adding Indian artefacts, such as beaded moccasins, arm bands, and bags, and clay pipes. The crowd is gathered around a white cloth which draws the eye at the centre of the composition, like a campfire or the Christ child at the centre of a nativity scene. The painting presents an idealised picture of interaction between the Indians and the Europeans, glossing over recent difficulties such as the Walking Purchase in 1737 and the treaty with the Six Nations in 1744, but harking back instead to Penn's wish for peace. The muscular Indians are dressed and decorated in green, red and white, with feather headdresses, partly shaved heads, beaded armbands and headbands, and large earrings. They lean forward, keen to see what they are being offered. Original items of clothing that were used as a model for portraying Native Americans in the painting can be found in the British Museum's collection (as well as additional indigenous artefacts used in other paintings by West).British Museum Collection The Europeans are shown in more sombre clothing typical of 1771, in shades of browns and greys, rather than the more decorated styles of 1682; Penn is picked out by his white neckcloth. The Europeans stand back, reversing their contemporary keenness to acquire land from the Indians. The crowd includes West's own father (the elderly gentleman with white hair, third to left of Penn) and his half brother Thomas West (behind Penn). West also added brick-built buildings from his own memories of Pennsylvania, even though they had not been built by 1682. The canvas measures high by wide. The painting was purchased at auction by Joseph Harrison and brought to Philadelphia. On Harrison's death, it was given to the Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts and the United States National Museum of Independence. It has been exhibited at the Pennsylvania State Museum. Prints thumb thumb A copperplate print of the painting was engraved in London by John Hall and published by John Boydell in June 1775, with the image reversed, under the longer title William Penn's treaty with the Indians, when he founded the province of Pennsylvania in North America, 1681. The print was copied in a smaller size by Robert Delaunay and published as Guillaume Penn Traite avec les Indiens. This French print was copied by other artists. The tree itself also became a subject for later paintings and prints, although it fell during a storm on 3 March 1810. The land is now Penn Treaty Park. The painting influenced folk artist Edward Hicks, who made his own image of the events.

Biography Titi was born on 10 February 1981. She is fond of sports and never wears skirts. In high school, she supposed to study economics but she switched to drums because she wanted to do something \\"different\\". She furthered her drum studies at Farabi Music School and Daya Music Institute. After graduation, she performed at the Java Jazz Festival; she also performed with artists such as Ruth Sahanaya. Titi made her feature film debut in Djenar Maesa Ayu's 2007 film Mereka Bilang, Saya Monyet! (They Say I'm a Monkey!). She was initially contracted to provide a soundtrack for the film with her husband, Sri Aksan Sjuman (also known as Wong Aksan), Maesa's brother. However, Maesa later asked her to take the lead role; after being cajoled by her husband and sister-in-law, Titi accepted. Aksan told her \\"in a kissing scene, when [she] kiss[es] a man, [her] body should not reject it\\". In 2010, Titi starred in Minggu Pagi di Victoria Park (Sunday Morning in Victoria Park), a film about immigrant workers in Hong Kong. For her role, she met with immigrant laborers in Indonesia and Hong Kong to \\"get a deeper understanding\\" of the role. That same year, she and her husband provided the soundtrack to Tanah Air Beta (My Homeland). Although there were some scheduling conflicts, she was able to complete both. In February 2011, Titi took her first role as an antagonist, appearing in Rindu Purnama (Longing for the Full Moon). She disliked the role as she disapproved of her character's actions. Later that year, she and her husband composed the score to Sang Penari (The Dancer), a film based on the Ronggeng Dukuh Paruk trilogy by Ahmad Tohari, over a period of a month and a half. Inspirations Titi enjoys the work of American composer John Williams, citing his works on Star Wars, Memoirs of a Geisha, and Home Alone as some of her favourites. Awards and recognition Titi has won the first annual Extra Joss Awards in November 2000. Eight years later, she won two Indonesian Movie Awards for Best Actress: Her first was Best Newcomer for Mereka Bilang, Saya Monyet, while the second was for her role in Minggu Pagi di Victoria Park. Her role in Mereka Bilang, Saya Monyet! garnered her a Citra Award at the Indonesian Film Festival for Best Actress, while Titi and her husband won a Citra Award for Best Soundtrack for the 2009 film King. She has said that receiving awards is a bonus which drives her to work harder. Personal life Titi was married to fellow musician Sri Aksan Sjuman (formerly of Dewa 19), who was one of her instructors at Farabi. They often collaborate on writing film scores. The couple have a daughter. Titi is sister-in-law to writer-cum-director Djenar Maesa Ayu. She filed for divorce from Aksan on 14 February 2013. They were divorced by March 2013.

Miotsukushi filming In 1985, DeHa 101 was used extensively in filming for the NHK TV drama series , which was shot on the Choshi Electric Railway.

The archdiocese has both a cathedral St. Mary's Cathedral Basilica in Halifax, and a co-cathedral St. Ambrose co-Cathedral, in Yarmouth. Its current diocesan ordinary is Archbishop Anthony Mancini.  History  On territory originally a part of the Diocese of Quebec, including the whole of Nova Scotia, the future diocese of Halifax was established on 4 September 1817 as the Apostolic Vicariate of Nova Scotia, a pre-diocesan jurisdiction entitled to a titular bishop and exempt, i.e., directly subject to the Holy See, not part of any ecclesiastical province. It was promoted to a bishopric on 15 February 1842 and on 22 September 1844 lost territory to establish the Roman Catholic Diocese of Arichat, now (as the Diocese of Antigonish) one of its suffragans. In 1852, Halifax was elevated to an archdiocese. It lost territory twice more: on 19 February 1953 to establish the Apostolic Prefecture of Bermuda Islands and on 6 July 1953 to establish the Roman Catholic Diocese of Yarmouth. It enjoyed a papal visit from Pope John Paul II in September 1984. In December 2011, the Diocese of Yarmouth was merged back into the Archdiocese of Halifax, creating the Archdiocese of Halifax-Yarmouth,Diocese of Yarmouth joined with Archdiocese of Halifax which was renamed by absorbing its title. The former cathedral became the St. Ambrose Co-Cathedral, in Yarmouth, Nova Scotia.  Extent and province  The Archdiocese of Halifax covers 21,770 square kilometers. As of 2006, the archdiocese contained 53 parishes, 64 active diocesan priests, 16 religious priests, and 161,125 Catholics. It also had 243 women religious, 17 religious brothers, and 28 permanent deacons. The metropolitan archbishop heads an ecclesiastical province which includes the suffragan dioceses of Antigonish and Charlottetown.

His musical influences included his mentor, Aaron Copland, as well as other American composers including Leonard Bernstein, George Gershwin, and John Philip Sousa. Biography Bernat was born in Johnstown, Pennsylvania on July 3, 1931 to Pearl Willie and Andrew Bernat. His mother died when he was four. That same year, his maternal grandfather taught him to play the country fiddle. By the time he was a teenager, he was playing the clarinet and saxophone professionally in jazz bands. At 15, he composed his first sonata for violin and piano. He obtained his undergraduate degree from Carnegie Mellon University (then, Carnegie Tech) in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania and his Master of Fine Arts in Composition from Brandeis University. In 1960, Bernat received a Crofts fellowship to attend the Boston Symphony Orchestra's Tanglewood Music Center in the Berkshires where he studied with composer Aaron Copland. He held academic posts at Bethany College, Brandeis University, Ohio State University and the University of Pittsburgh before finding a permanent teaching home in the music department at Indiana University of Pennsylvania. In 1966, the Pittsburgh Symphony Orchestra commissioned him to compose In Memoriam: John F. Kennedy, a tribute to the late president. The piece was premiered on November 25, 1966. In the program notes, Bernat stated, \\"I tried to build the kind of piece that would be accessible to as many listeners as possible without compromising my own musical ideals.\\" This musical philosophy was a common thread throughout Bernat's career. The Louisville Orchestra later recorded In Memoriam as part of their first edition series. From 1971-1972, Bernat was a Woodrow Wilson Fellow at California Institute for the Arts in Los Angeles, California where he studied electronic music. When he returned to Pennsylvania, he served as executive director of the Pennsylvania Council for the Arts from 1972 through 1975. Composer and Brass Band Bernat was commissioned in 1976 by British composer Elgar Howarth to write his first brass band composition, Dunlap's Creek. The Grimethorpe Colliery Band premiered the piece in Uniontown, Pennsylvania and in New York City as part of the United States Bicentennial celebrations. Composing Dunlap's Creek inspired Bernat to learn more about these bands which enjoy great popularity in United Kingdom. In September 1978, he was the first composer selected by the state of Pennsylvania and the National Endowment for the Arts to participate in an arts exchange program with the United Kingdom. He moved to Sheffield, England for almost a year to study brass bands up close. He was so impressed by the bands' combination of musical virtuosity and accessibility that he made up his mind to bring the brass band movement to the US. He began to execute his plan in 1980 in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. The Steel City was not only a perfect base for this blue collar music (traditionally the musicians were coal miners and mill workers), it also offered a deep pool of musical talent. In 1981, the River City Brass Band (RCBB) gave its debut performance at Pittsburgh's Carnegie Music Hall. Bernat served as the RCBB's conductor, artistic director and president. Under his direction, the RCBB's musicians brought a variety of music ‚Äî everything from traditional marches and Broadway tunes to newly commissioned works‚Äîto Pittsburgh audiences. During performances, Bernat would tell anecdotes about the various pieces and composers and encouraged audiences to join in for sing-a-longs. Bernat was diagnosed with lung cancer in May 1994. With the RCBB in its 15th season, Bernat handed over his baton to cornet player, Denis Colwell, but continued to work behind the scenes to ensure that his artistic vision was properly executed. He died on December 3, 1994 at the age of 63 in his home. His legacy continues today as the River City Brass Band (now River City Brass) plays nationally and internationally under the direction of conductor and artistic director, James Gourlay, an internationally renowned tuba player and former conductor of the Grimethorpe Colliery Band. Personal Bernat married Edwinna Bossler, a fellow Johnstown native, in 1954, and they had three daughters, Brenda, Rebecca (Becky), and June Elizabeth (Betsy). He eventually married four times. The former Nancy Buttermore was his wife at the time of his death.

He is portrayed by Idris Elba. Biography John Luther for the police. He is a legendary figure on the force both for his dedication and his ingenious approaches to solving cases. However, the horrors of Luther's job have given rise to emotional demons which often put him at odds with colleagues and loved ones. Because of this, he constantly breaches protocol and uses unorthodox (and sometimes illegal) methods, such as breaking into properties without warrants to find clues or violently threatening suspects or witnesses. He is also given to belligerent fits of anger. Nevertheless, he is known to hate firearms, and he refuses to kill or directly cause the death of suspects. Luther returns from leave to investigate the double murder of Alice Morgan's parents, and quickly realises that she committed the crime. However, Morgan's methodical destruction of evidence keeps Luther from conclusively proving her guilt. A peculiar relationship develops between Luther and Morgan, and Luther approaches her for help on occasion. Morgan insinuates herself into Luther's relationship with Zoe with the intention of helping their marriage, yet her means only further complicate Luther's personal problems. When Zoe is shot and killed by Luther's best friend, the corrupt Detective Chief Inspector Ian Reed, Luther - known for his violent temper - is blamed for the murder because Reed sets up the crime scene to implicate him. Luther subsequently becomes the focus of a citywide manhunt. Events transpire during which Alice kills Reed during a confrontation between him, on one side, and her, Luther, and Zoe's boyfriend Mark on the other, at a deserted Waterloo station. After providing proof that Reed murdered Zoe, Luther is allowed to return to the service, where he has now been assigned to the reorganized Serious and Serial Crime Unit, headed by DSU Schenck. At the start of the second series, Luther has moved into an unmaintained flat at the Aylesbury Estate and shows suicidal tendencies. Luther also desires to leave the Met. He is approached by Caroline Jones, the wife of one of his former suspects, who asks him to locate her delinquent daughter, Jenny. When Luther tracks down Jenny and rescues her from a pornography shoot, the production's backers, Toby Kent and his grandmother, \\"Baba\\", violently pressure the inspector to hand her back. Rather than doing so, Luther strikes an illegal deal to provide them with information, in exchange for setting Jenny free. When Jenny kills Toby in self-defence, Luther manages to cover up her crime and threatens Baba with a visit from Alice if she continues to harass Jenny and her mother. Personality Idris Elba said of his character, \\"You know when you watch the news and someone has killed their children? And your instinct is to be like, 'Oh, if I got my hands on them'? Well, his instinct is to do that but he's a police officer. And when he does get his hands on them, he doesn't necessarily follow procedure. He will be as vindictive as the criminal\\".

History Artist depiction of Captain John Underhill. John Underhill (7 October 1597 ‚Äì 21 July 1672) was an early English settler and soldier in the Massachusetts Bay Colony, the Province of New Hampshire, the New Haven Colony, New Netherland, and later the Province of New York. From Baginton, Captain John Underhill died on 21 July 1672 and was buried on his own land in the Underhill Burying Ground in Locust Valley, New York. Over time nearly 300 of his descendants were buried in the family cemetery. Thomas Stewardson, Jr., made a pilgrimage on October 22, 1868 to discover the burial site of Captain John Underhill. During this visit he made a sketch of the site, a copy of which he later conveyed to William Underhill, Esq. of Wimbledon, England. In it Stewardson referred to \\"This pretty, but neglected graveyard\\" and how he \\"heard whilst there, of an intention to erect a Monument over the remains of 'Fighting John.'\\" The Underhill Society of America was founded in Brooklyn, New York, in 1892 by David Harris Underhill and other descendants of Captain John Underhill. The purpose of the Underhill Society of America initially was to establish a monument at the gravesite of the immigrant ancestor. William Wilson Underhill was selected as the first President of the Underhill Society of America and also Chairman of the Monument Committee. By the time of their third meeting in 1893, discussion centered on \\"erecting a monument to the memory of the Captain at his resting place near Glen Cove.\\" Descendants of Captain John Underhill occupied some important stations in American life. Notable descendants included John Torboss Underhill, who distinguished himself in service during the Civil War and was elected Colonel of the 27th New York Volunteer Infantry Regiment in 1873. Estelle Skidmore Doremus was a Charter member of the Daughters of the American Revolution and a leading figure in the American colony in Paris during the reign of Napoleon III. Myron Charles Taylor was a leading American industrialist and a key diplomatic figure at the hub of many of the most important geopolitical events before, during, and after World War II. In its early years, the Underhill Society held numerous events, ranging from family reunions, to the Annual Meeting, and a February Meeting usually at the Friends' Seminary or Friends' Meeting House in New York City. These meetings attracted significant figures in society at the time. One of these was Alexander van Alstyne and his wife Fanny Crosby. At the third annual reunion of the Underhill Society in 1902, Alexander van Alstyne played piano and Fanny Crosby read an ode to Captain John Underhill. They later lived with David Harris Underhill, who organized the Underhill Society of America. His connection with Van Alstyne shows that he was part of a network. Having failed to raise sufficient funds toward the $6,000 needed for the monument, William Wilson Underhill resigned as President of the Underhill Society and as Chairman of the Monument Committee. Estelle Skidmore Doremus took his place as the second President, serving from 1898 to 1905. Doremus also recruited a new Chairman for the Monument Committee. She selected Colonel John Torboss Underhill to take on that role. Following Mrs. Doremus' death in 1905, Underhill succeeded her as President of the family Society. He carried out fundraising to proceed with work on the monument. Names on a plaque at the base of the monument recognize the role of Mrs. Robert Ogden Doremus as one of two \\"Patrons\\" who supported erection of the monument. Theodore Roosevelt at the dedication of the Captain John Underhill monument, July 11, 1908. The monument was subsequently built in 1907 at the Underhill Burying Ground and dedicated by President Theodore Roosevelt on July 11, 1908. Over 500 people attended the dedication ceremonies. At the ceremony, President Roosevelt said: > The founder of the family here was a good soldier and a good citizen, and > the Underhills have to-day furnished their full quota of good soldiers and > good citizens in their time. If they had not, I would not have been here. Roosevelt noted that family members served in important roles in American life, including as capitalists and wage workers, farmers, mechanics, professional men, and others. Roosevelt said that \\"each one is entitled to the fullest and heartiest respect if he does his duty well in the position in life in which he happens to find himself.\\" He also said: > I have known any number of Underhills in every walk of life, men who made > their living in many different ways - men belonging to the professions, men > who followed the sea, men who tilled the soil, men of means, men who made > each day's living by that days work with their hands - and all of them > decent citizens. I won't say that there are not some Underhills who are not > decent, but fortunately I have not met them. The Society continued to hold regular meetings and family reunions. After 1907 an Underhill Society Library, with offices and meeting space, was maintained at 198 Rutledge Street in Brooklyn, New York. An Annual Report was published annually from 1893 to 1937. Subsequently a Bulletin was published annually since 1954. A semi-annual newsletter called \\"News and Views\\" also has been published semi-annually since 1970. The Underhill Burying Ground was the destination of the Colonial Daughters of the Seventeenth Century on November 4, 1929. About forty members, their guests, and members of other patriotic sites were present. David Harris Underhill welcomed the group and talked about Captain John Underhill's life. Among those present were President General, Mrs. J. Morton Halstead; First vice-President General, Mrs. Wilson W. Thompson; Second Vice-President General, Mrs. I. Sherwood Coffin; Registrar General, Mrs. James M. Edsall; and Genealogist Mrs. Samuel K. Frost. Copy of drawing by Stewardson from 1868. The Underhill Society of America has published or supported several works of history. Newes from America, an account of the Pequot War in 1641, was re-printed by the Society in 1902, 1951, and 1972. David Harris Underhill and Francis Jay Underhill published an extensive work titled Underhill Burying Ground that recounted the history of the family and notable people buried in the family cemetery in Lattingtown. Two general interest books on the Underhill family, Underhills of Warwickshire by John H. Morrison, and John Underhill Captain of New England and New Netherland, by Henry C. Shelley, were published in 1932. The Underhill Society of America has worked to publish and refine an Underhill Genealogy. This is a comprehensive and authoritative resource identifying thousands of Underhill descendants. Volumes I-IV, edited by Josephine C. Frost, were originally published in 1932. These were followed by Vols. V-VI by Edwin R. Deats and Harry Macy, Jr., which were published in 1980. Finally, Vols. VII-VIII by Carl J. Underhill were published in 2002. David Harris Underhill amassed a sizable collection of material on Underhill history and genealogy, maintaining it in his home until his death in 1936. The collection was stored elsewhere for 45 years. In 1981 the Underhill Society of America and the Townsend Society of America leased space for this material on East Main Street in Oyster Bay. They continued to operate from this location through the 1990s, when the Underhill Society and Townsend Society sought separate offices for their collections. The Underhill Society of America presently has offices at 30 West Main Street in Oyster Bay, New York.
