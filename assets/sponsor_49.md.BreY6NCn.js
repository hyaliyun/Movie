It is a white crystalline solid, soluble in water but not in ethanol. Magnesium sulfate is usually encountered in the form of a hydrate , for various values of n between 1 and 11. The most common is the heptahydrate , known as Epsom salt, which is a household chemical with many traditional uses, including bath salts. The main use of magnesium sulfate is in agriculture, to correct soils deficient in magnesium (an essential plant nutrient). The monohydrate is favored for this use; by the mid-1970s, its production was 2.3 million tons per year. The anhydrous form and several hydrates occur in nature as minerals, and the salt is a significant component of the water from some springs. Hydrates Magnesium sulfate can crystallize as several hydrates, including: * Anhydrous, ; unstable in nature, hydrates to form epsomite.https://www.mindat.org/min-40082.html * Monohydrate, ; kieserite, monoclinic. * or . * Dihydrate, ; orthorhombic. * or . * Trihydrate, . * Tetrahydrate, ; starkeyite, monoclinic. * Pentahydrate, ; pentahydrite, triclinic. * Hexahydrate, ; hexahydrite, monoclinic. * Heptahydrate, (\\"Epsom salt\\"); epsomite, orthorhombic. * Enneahydrate, , monoclinic. * Decahydrate, . * Undecahydrate, ; meridianiite, triclinic. As of 2017, the existence of the decahydrate apparently has not been confirmed. All the hydrates lose water upon heating. Above 320 ¬∞C only the anhydrous form is stable. It decomposes without melting at 1124 ¬∞C into magnesium oxide (MgO) and sulfur trioxide (SO3). =Heptahydrate (Epsom salt)= The heptahydrate takes its common name \\"Epsom salt\\" from a bitter saline spring in Epsom in Surrey, England, where the salt was produced from the springs that arise where the porous chalk of the North Downs meets non-porous London clay. The heptahydrate readily loses one equivalent of water to form the hexahydrate. =Monohydrate= The monohydrate can be prepared by heating the hexahydrate to approximately 150 ¬∞C. Further heating to approximately 300-320 ¬∞C gives anhydrous magnesium sulfate. =Undecahydrate= The undecahydrate , meridianiite, is stable at atmospheric pressure only below 2 ¬∞C. Above that temperature, it liquefies into a mix of solid heptahydrate and a saturated solution. It has an eutectic point with water at ‚àí3.9 ¬∞C and 17.3% (mass) of MgSO4. Large crystals can be obtained from solutions of the proper concentration kept at 0 ¬∞C for a few days. At pressures of about 0.9 GPa and at 240 K, meridianiite decomposes into a mixture of ice VI and the enneahydrate =Enneahydrate= The enneahydrate was identified and characterized only recently, even though it seems easy to produce (by cooling a solution of and sodium sulfate in suitable proportions). The structure is monoclinic, with unit-cell parameters at 250 Ka= 0.675 nm, b = 1.195 nm, c = 1.465 nm, Œ≤ = 95.1¬∞, V = 1.177 nm3 with Z = 4. The most probable space group is P21/c. Magnesium selenate also forms an enneahydrate , but with a different crystal structure. Natural occurrence Magnesium sulfates are common minerals in geological environments. Their occurrence is mostly connected with supergene processes. Some of them are also important constituents of evaporitic potassium-magnesium (K-Mg) salts deposits. Bright spots observed by the Dawn Spacecraft in Occator Crater on the dwarf planet Ceres are most consistent with reflected light from magnesium sulfate hexahydrate. Almost all known mineralogical forms of MgSO4 are hydrates. Epsomite is the natural analogue of \\"Epsom salt\\". Meridianiite, MgSO4¬∑11H2O, has been observed on the surface of frozen lakes and is thought to also occur on Mars. Hexahydrite is the next lower (6) hydrate. Three next lower hydrates‚Äîpentahydrite, starkeyite, and especially sanderite are rare. Kieserite is a monohydrate and is common among evaporitic deposits. Anhydrous magnesium sulfate was reported from some burning coal dumps. Preparation Magnesium sulfate is usually obtained directly from dry lake beds and other natural sources. It can also be prepared by reacting magnesite (magnesium carbonate, ) or magnesia (oxide, ) with sulfuric acid. Another possible method is to treat seawater or magnesium- containing industrial wastes so as to precipitate magnesium hydroxide, and react the precipitate with sulfuric acid. Uses =Medical= Magnesium sulfate is used both externally (as Epsom salt) and internally. The main external use is the formulation as bath salts, especially for foot baths to soothe sore feet. Such baths have been claimed to also soothe and hasten recovery of muscle pain, soreness, or injury. However, these claims have not been scientifically confirmed. The main benefit of the salt is cosmetic: it prevents the temporary skin wrinkling caused by prolonged immersion in plain water. It is also the usual component of the solution used in isolation tanks. In the UK, a medication containing magnesium sulphate and phenol, called \\"drawing paste\\", is claimed to be useful for small boils or localised infections, and removing splinters. Internally, magnesium sulfate may be administered by oral, respiratory, or intravenous routes. Internal uses include: replacement therapy for magnesium deficiency, treatment of acute and severe arrhythmias, as a bronchodilator in the treatment of asthma, and preventing eclampsia. =Agriculture= In agriculture, magnesium sulfate is used to increase magnesium or sulfur content in soil. It is most commonly applied to potted plants, or to magnesium-hungry crops, such as potatoes, tomatoes, carrots, peppers, lemons, and roses. The advantage of magnesium sulfate over other magnesium soil amendments (such as dolomitic lime) is its high solubility, which also allows the option of foliar feeding. Solutions of magnesium sulfate are also nearly pH neutral, compared with alkaline salts of magnesium as found in limestone; therefore, the use of magnesium sulfate as a magnesium source for soil does not significantly change the soil pH. Magnesium sulfate was historically used as a treatment for lead poisoning prior to the development of chelation therapy, as it was hoped that any lead ingested would be precipitated out by the magnesium sulfate and subsequently purged from the digestive system. This application saw particularly widespread use among veterinarians during the early-to-mid 20th century; Epsom salt was already available on many farms for agricultural use, and it was often prescribed in the treatment of farm animals which inadvertently ingested lead. =Food preparation= Magnesium sulfate is used as a brewing salt in making beer. It may also be used as a coagulant for making tofu. =Chemistry= Anhydrous magnesium sulfate is commonly used as a desiccant in organic synthesis due to its affinity for water and compatibility with most organic compounds. During work-up, an organic phase is treated with anhydrous magnesium sulfate. The hydrated solid is then removed with filtration, decantation or distillation (if the boiling point is low enough). Other inorganic sulfate salts such as sodium sulfate and calcium sulfate may be used in the same way. =Construction= Magnesium sulfate is used to prepare specific cements by the reaction between magnesium oxide and magnesium sulfate solution, which are of good binding ability and more resistance than Portland cement. This cement is mainly adopted in the production of lightweight insulation panels. Weakness in water resistance limits its usage. Magnesium (or sodium) sulfate is also used for testing aggregates for soundness in accordance with ASTM C88 standard, when there are no service records of the material exposed to actual weathering conditions. The test is accomplished by repeated immersion in saturated solutions followed by oven drying to dehydrate the salt precipitated in permeable pore spaces. The internal expansive force, derived from the rehydration of the salt upon re-immersion, simulates the expansion of water on freezing. =Aquaria= Magnesium sulfate heptahydrate is also used to maintain the magnesium concentration in marine aquaria which contain large amounts of stony corals, as it is slowly depleted in their calcification process. In a magnesium-deficient marine aquarium, calcium and alkalinity concentrations are very difficult to control because not enough magnesium is present to stabilize these ions in the saltwater and prevent their spontaneous precipitation into calcium carbonate. Double salts Double salts containing magnesium sulfate exist. There are several known as sodium magnesium sulfates and potassium magnesium sulfates. A mixed copper-magnesium sulfate heptahydrate (Mg,Cu)SO4¬∑7H2O was recently found to occur in mine tailings,and has been given the mineral name alpersite. See also * Calcium sulfate References A.

Nearly thousands of Indonesian islands having its own cultural and artistic history and character.Indonesian Geography http://countrystudies.us/indonesia/28.htm This results in hundreds of different forms of music, which often accompanies by dance and theatre. The musics of Java, Sumatra, Bali, Flores and other islands have been documented and recorded, and research by Indonesian and international scholars is ongoing. The music in Indonesia predates historical records, various Native Indonesian tribes often incorporate chants and songs accompanied with musics instruments in their rituals. Today the contemporary music of Indonesia is popular in the region, including neighbouring countries; Malaysia, Singapore and Brunei.MyIndo KC Ismail: Muzik Indonesia lebih progresif dari muzik Malaysia (in Malay) Traditional regional musics and songs of Indonesia natively compromises of strong beat and harmony type musics with strong influence of Indian and Malay classical music. The influence is strongly visible in the traditional popular music genre of Dangdut.  Musical instruments  The Sundanese Degung gamelan performance in Museo Nacional de las Culturas Mexico, Indra Swara group. Gamelan xylophone solo. The musical identity of Indonesia as we know it today began as the Bronze Age culture migrated to the Indonesian archipelago in the 2nd-3rd century BC.Asia Sound Traditional musics of Indonesian tribes often uses percussion instruments, especially gendang (drums) and gongs. Some of them developed elaborate and distinctive musical instruments, such as sasando string instrument of Rote island, angklung of Sundanese people, and the complex and sophisticated gamelan orchestra of Java and Bali. Indonesia is the home of gong chime, there are many variants across Indonesia, especially in Java and Bali. = Gamelan = The gamelan performance in the palace of Surakarta Sunanate. The most popular and famous form of Indonesian music is probably gamelan, an ensemble of tuned percussion instruments that include metallophones, drums, gongs and spike fiddles along with bamboo flutes. Similar ensembles are prevalent throughout Indonesia and Malaysia, however gamelan is originated from Java, Bali, and Lombok. In the Central Java, gamelan is intricate and meticulously laid out. The central melody is played on a metallophone in the centre of the orchestra, while the front elaboration and ornamentation on the melody, and, at the back, the gongs slowly punctuate the music. There are two tuning systems. Each gamelan is tuned to itself, and the intervals between notes on the scale vary between ensembles. The metallophones cover four octaves, and include types like the slenthem, demung, saron panerus and balungan. The soul of the gamelan is believed to reside in the large gong, or gong ageng. Other gongs are tuned to each note of the scale and include ketuk, kenong and kempul. The front section of the orchestra is diverse, and includes rebab, suling, siter, bonang and gambang. Male choruses (gerong) and female (pesindhen) solo vocalists are common. With the arrival of the Dutch colonisers, a number system called kepatihan was developed to record the music. Music and dance at the time were divided into several styles based on the main courts in the area‚ÄîSurakarta, Yogyakarta, Pakualaman and Mangkunegaran. Gamelan from eastern Java is less well-known than central or western parts of the island. Perhaps most distinctive of the area is the extremely large gamyak drum. In West Java, formerly Sunda, has several types of gamelan. Gamelan Degung, gamelan salendro and tembang sunda are three primary types. The Osing Javanese minority in eastern Java are known for social music for weddings and other celebrations called gandrung, as well as angklung, played by young amateur boys, which is very similar to Balinese gamelan. = Kulintang = Kolintang or kulintang is a bronze and wooden percussion instrument native to eastern Indonesia and also The Philippines. In Indonesia it is particularly associated with Minahasa people of North Sulawesi, however it also popular in Maluku and Timor. = Talempong = Talempong performance Talempong is a traditional instrument of the Minangkabau of West Sumatra. The shape is almost the same as the bonang instrument in the gamelan device. Talempongs can be made of brass, but some are made of wood and stone. Talempongs are played by being hit using a wooden rod or a stick. = Angklung = The student angklung performance Angklung is a bamboo musical instrument native to Sundanese people of West Java. It is made out of bamboo tubes attached to a bamboo frame. The tubes are carved so that they have a distinctive resonant pitch when being vibrated. Each angklung only plays one note. = Kacapi suling = SambaSunda music performance, featuring traditional Sundanese music instruments such as kecapi, suling, and kendang. Kacapi suling is a type of instrumental music that is highly improvisational and popular in parts of West Java that employs two instruments, kacapi (zither) and suling (bamboo flute). It is related to tembang sunda. = Sasando = Sasando is a plucked string instrument native of Rote island of East Nusa Tenggara. The parts of sasando are a bamboo cylinder surrounded by several wedges where the strings are stretched, surrounded by a bag-like fan of dried lontar or palmyra leaves (Borassus flabellifer), functioned as the resonator of the instrument. = Tapanuli ogong = Musical performance from Tapanuli area of North Sumatra. Tapanuli ogong is a form of dance music played with a type of lute, trumpet and flute.  Genres  The diverse world of Indonesian music genres was the result of the musical creativity of its people, and also the subsequent cultural encounters with foreign musical influences into the archipelago. Next to distinctive native form of musics, several genres can traces its origin to foreign influences; such as gambus and qasidah from Middle Eastern Islamic music, keroncong from Portuguese influences, and dangdut with notable Hindi music influence. = Folk music = Indonesian regional folk pop musics reflects the diversity of Indonesian culture and Indonesian ethnicity, mostly use local languages and a mix of western and regional style music and instruments. Indonesian folk music is quite diverse, and today embraces pop, rock, house, hip hop and other genres, as well as distinct Indonesian forms. There are several kinds of \\"ethnic\\" pop music, generally grouped together as Pop Daerah (regional pop). These include Pop sunda, Pop Minang, Pop Batak, Pop Melayu, Pop Ambon, Pop Minahasa and others. Other than featuring the legacy of Lagu Daerah (regional traditional songs) of each regional cultures, the musician might also create some new compositions in their own native language. = Tembang Cianjuran Sunda = Tembang sunda, also called \\"seni mamaos cianjuran\\", or just cianjuran, is a form of sung poetry which arose in the colonial-era of Cianjur. It was first known as an aristocratic art; one cianjuran composer was R.A.A. Kusumahningrat (Dalem Pancaniti), ruler of Cianjur (1834‚Äì1862). The instruments of Cianjuran are kacapi indung, kacapi rincik and suling or bamboo flute, and rebab for salendro compositions. The lyrics are typically sung in free verse, but a more modern version, panambih, is metrical. It is usually the drums. = Jaipongan = Jaipongan dance performance Jaipongan is a very complex rhythmic dance music from the Sundanese people of western Java. The rhythm is liable to change seemingly randomly, making dancing difficult for most listeners. Its instruments are entirely Sundanese, completely without imported instruments. It was invented by artists like Gugum Gumbira after Sukarno prohibited rock and roll and other western genres in the 1960s. = Gambus = Gambus literally means oud, referring to a type of lute or 12-string pear-shaped guitar, is the Middle-Eastern-derived Islamic vocal and instrumental music. These traditions began to be incorporated throughout many areas of Indonesia by the 16th century. = Qasidah modern = Qasidah is an ancient Arabic word for religious poetry accompanied by chanting and percussion. Qasidah modern adapts this for pop audiences. It is used to denote a type of orchestra and the music it plays, believed to be introduced by Muslim settlers from Yemen. Qasidah modern were derived from Islamic pop, adding local dialects and lyrics that address Indonesian contemporary issues. Though popular among Arabs in Indonesia, it has gained little popularity elsewhere. One of the oldest qasidah modern musical groups in Indonesia is Nasida Ria. The contemporary form of Islamic Middle Eastern-influenced music in Indonesia is exemplified by the band Debu, that feature a sufism approach on music to spread their message. = Kroncong = Keroncong singer, Waldjinah in a kroncong performance at the 55th Tong Tong Fair at The Hague in 2013. Kroncong (alternative spelling: Keroncong) has been evolving since the arrival of the Portuguese, who brought with them European instruments. By the early 1900s, it was considered a low-class urban music. This changed in the 1930s, when the rising Indonesian film industry began incorporating kroncong. And then even more so in the mid- to late 1940s, it became associated with the struggle for independence. Perhaps the most famous song in the kroncong style is \\"Bengawan Solo\\", written in 1940 by Gesang Martohartono, a Solonese musician. Written during the Japanese Imperial Army occupation of the island in World War II, the song (about the Bengawan Solo River, Java's longest and most important river) became widely popular among the Javanese, and then later nationally when recordings were broadcast over the local radio stations. The song also became quite popular with the Japanese soldiers, and when they returned to Japan at the end of the war re-recordings of it (by Japanese artists) became best-sellers. Over the years it has been re-released many times by notable artists, mainly within Asia but also beyond (like Anneke Gr√∂nloh), and in some places it is seen as typifying Indonesian music. Gesang himself remains the most renowned exponent of the style, which although it is seen now as a somewhat starchy and \\"dated\\" form is still popular among large segments of the population, particularly the older generation. After World War II and during Indonesian National Revolution (1945‚Äì1949) and afterwards, kroncong was associated with patriotism, since many of Indonesian poets and patriotic songs authors uses kroncong and somewhat jazz fusion as the genre of their works. The patriotic theme and romantic wartime romance was obvious in the works of Ismail Marzuki, such as \\"Rayuan Pulau Kelapa\\", \\"Indonesia Pusaka\\", \\"Sepasang Mata Bola\\", \\"Keroncong Serenata\\" and \\"Juwita Malam\\". These patriotic songs can be sung in hymn or even in orchestra, but most often was sung in kroncong style known as kroncong perjuangan (struggle kroncong). The kroncong divas; Waldjinah, Sundari Sukoco and Hetty Koes Endang, was instrumental in reviving the style in the 1980s. = Langgam Jawa = There is a style of kroncong native to Surakarta (Solo) called langgam jawa, which fuses kroncong with the gamelan seven-note scale. = Gambang kromong = Gambang kromong, a music performed on melodic percussions and brass, is native of the Indonesian capital of Jakarta. Early in the 20th century, kroncong was used in a type of theatre called Komedi Stambul; adapted for this purpose, the music was called gambang kromong. Gambang kromong is quite prevalent in Betawi culture of Jakarta. = Tanjidor = Tanjidor is a traditional Betawi musical ensemble of Jakarta. The instruments used are almost the same as the drum band, usually consists of tuba or sousaphone, trumpet, clarinet, tambourine and drums. The term tanjidor was derived from Portuguese tanger (playing music) and tangedor (playing music outdoors), subsequently adopted in Betawi language as tanji (music). Other than Jakarta, tanjidor musical ensamble is also can be found in Pontianak, West Kalimantan. = Dangdut = A dangdut performance Dangdut is a popular traditional music genre of Indonesia which is partly derived of Indian, Arab, and Malay music. It consists of melodious and harmonical music with the main Tabla as the percussion beat especially in the classical dangdut versions. It was originally an Indonesian dance music that has spread throughout Southeast Asia, became the dominant pop style in the mid-1970s. Famous for its throbbing beat and the slightly moralistic lyrics that appeal to youth, dangdut stars dominate the modern pop scene. However dangdut‚Äîespecially performed by female singers‚Äîalso often featuring suggestive dance movements and naughty lyrics to appeal the larger audience. This development was strongly opposed by the conservative older generation dangdut artist. Dangdut is based around the singers, and stars include Rhoma Irama and Elvy Sukaesih (the King and Queen of Dangdut), Mansyur S., A. Rafiq, Camelia Malik and Fahmy Shahab; along with Cici Paramida, Evie Tamala, Inul Daratista, Julia Perez and Dewi Perssik from younger generation. = Campursari = A musical fusion style of traditional Javanese music and dangdut that prevalent in Javanese cultural sphere, mainly Central Java, Yogyakarta and East Java. There is also Sundanese version of campursari prevalent in Bandung region of West Java. Perhaps its greatest current artist is Didi Kempot.  Contemporary music  The contemporary music of Indonesia is diverse and vibrant. Throughout its history, Indonesian musicians were open to foreign influences of various music genres of the world. American jazz was heavily marketed in Asia, and foxtrots, tangos, rumbas, blues and Hawaiian guitar styles were all imitated by Indonesian musicians.National Geographic Indonesian Pop Music As the result, various genres were developed within Indonesian music frame: Indonesian pop, rock, jazz, and hip hop. Indonesian music also plays a vital role in the Indonesian creative pop culture, especially as the soundtracks or theme songs of Indonesian cinema and sinetrons (Indonesian TV drama). Indonesian film Badai Pasti Berlalu (1977) were also produced successful soundtrack hit with same title in the same year, the soundtrack was remade in 1999 with Chrisye as the main singer and rendered by Erwin Gutawa in orchestra style. In 2007 the film was remade again with a new soundtrack that still features same songs performed by younger generation artist. Another popular Indonesian coming of age teen movie Ada Apa Dengan Cinta (2002) also produced successful soundtrack hits with most songs written and performed by Melly Goeslaw. Today the Indonesian music industry enjoys nationwide popularity. Thanks to common culture and intelligible languages between Indonesian and Malay, Indonesian music enjoyed regional popularity in neighbouring countries such as Malaysia, Singapore and Brunei. However, the overwhelming popularity of Indonesian music in Malaysia had alarmed the Malaysian music industry. In 2008 Malaysian music industry demanded the restriction of Indonesian songs on Malaysian radio broadcasts.Malaysian music industry wants Indonesian songs restricted = Orchestra = Western classical music reached Indonesia in the era of Dutch East Indies as early as the 18th century, but it was enjoyed only by a handful of wealthy Dutch plantation owners and officers in elite social clubs and ballrooms such as Societeit Harmonie in Batavia and Societeit Concordia in Bandung. De Schouwburg van Batavia (today Gedung Kesenian Jakarta) was designed as a concert hall in the 19th century. Classical music has been restricted to the refined, wealthy and educated high-class citizen, and never penetrated the rest of the population during the East Indies colonial era. The type of western-derived music that transcended the social barrier at that time was Kroncong, known as lower-class music. An amateur group called Bataviasche Philharmonic Orchestra was established in Dutch colonial times. It became the NIROM orchestra when the radio broadcasting station Nederlandsch-Indische Radio Omroep Maatschappij was born in 1912. Today it is known as Jakarta Symphony Orchestra that has existed in the country's musical world for almost a century through its changing formats to suit prevailing trends and needs. In 1950, a merger of the Cosmopolitan Orchestra under Joel Cleber and the Jakarta Studio Orchestra under Sutedjo and Iskandar appeared as the Djakarta Radio Orchestra under Henkie Strake for classical repertoires, and the Jakarta Studio Orchestra led by Syaiful Bachri specialised in Indonesian pieces. In 2010 Jakarta Symphony Orchestra staged a comeback after a fairly long absence.Jakarta Symphony Orchestra returns In the 1960s to 1980s classical music in Indonesia aired mainly by the national radio broadcasting service Radio Republik Indonesia (RRI) and the national TV station Televisi Republik Indonesia (TVRI) through their programs. During these decades, the classical orchestra mainly developed in Universities as an extracurricular activity for students which included choir. In the 1990s the group of professional symphony orchestra start to take form, notably The Twilite Orchestra led by Adie MS, was founded in June 1991, initially an ensemble with 20 musicians. The ensemble has developed since then into a full symphonic orchestra with 70 musicians, a 63-member Twilite Chorus, and a repertoire that ranges from Beethoven to The Beatles.Orchestra The orchestra has played a role in promoting Indonesian music, especially in the preservation of national songs by Indonesian composers and traditional songs. Aided by the Victorian Philharmonic Orchestra with the Twilite Chorus, Addie MS re-recorded the Indonesian national anthem, Indonesia Raya, by WR Supratman in its original orchestral arrangement by Jos Cleber, as well as other Indonesian popular national songs in the album Simfoni Negeriku. The Indonesian composer who is considered most prominent and well-known worldwide in the classical / contemporary music is Ananda Sukarlan (born 1968), with many orchestral works, chamber and instrumental. His most celebrated works are a series of virtuosic Rapsodia Nusantara for piano solo, with musical motifs based on Indonesian folktunes. He has written works for musicians such as from the Boston Symphony Orchestra, violinist Midori Goto etc., and his works are widely performed worldwide Today, major cities like Jakarta, Bandung, Yogyakarta, Surabaya, Medan and Batam are no strangers to orchestral music, with their own symphony groups. Jakarta, for instance, has its Nusantara Symphony Orchestra, the Twilite Orchestra and the Jakarta Chamber Orchestra. Indonesia also has many patriotic songs that are used, played, and memorized by the population, some of these national songs are used during the colonial era of the Dutch East Indies, Japanese Occupation, and today Indonesia. Many of these songs have been recorded using orchestral recordings on different albums such as 'Simfoni Negeriku' conducted by Addie MS. List of Indonesian national songs. = Pop = JKT48 performs at Jakarta‚ÄìJapan Matsuri 2012. Peterpan, one of Indonesia's popular bands Indonesian pop music today, known simply as \\"pop Indonesia\\" is heavily influenced by trends and recordings from America,National Geographic Indonesian Pop Music Britain, Japan, and Korea. Although influences ranging from American pop, British pop, and also Asian J-pop and K-pop are obvious, the Indonesian pop phenomena is not completely derivative; it expresses the sentiments and styles of contemporary Indonesian life. Koes Bersaudara later formed as Koes Plus is considered as one of the pioneer of Indonesian pop and rock and roll music in the 1960s and 1970s. The American and British music influences were obvious in the music of Koes Bersaudara, The Beatles were known to be the main influences of this band. Several Indonesian pop and ballad singers were survived through decades and become Indonesian music legends, such as Iwan Fals and Chrisye. One of the most influential Indonesian singers in pop music scene, especially during early 2000, is Agnes Monica, who had later known as Agnez Mo. Today, the popular bands include Peterpan, Radja, Gigi, Padi, Dewa 19, Sheila on 7, D'Masiv and Nidji, all of which tour regularly in Indonesia, Singapore and Malaysia and are featured on MTV Asia. Some of Indonesian pop bands are rekindled with their Malay roots and revived a genre called \\"Band Pop Melayu\\" (Pop Malay Band) and popular in the late 2000s. The pop Malay bands include ST 12. Indonesian pop music from the 1980s and 1980 are commonly referred to as \\"Indonesian city pop\\", due to their perceived similarities to the Japanese genre. The Japanese city pop itself gained popularity among youngsters and amateur musicians in the late 2010s via the Internet. The most recent foreign influences on Indonesian pop music are influenced from J-pop and K-pop. Several bands such as J-Rocks emulate Japanese and Korean pop culture. Girl groups are also spreading among boy bands, such as 7icons and Cherrybelle, as well as JKT48 which is an offshoot of the Japanese AKB48. = Rock = Just like pop music, Indonesian rock scene also was heavily influenced by the development of rock music in America. The most influential Indonesian rock bands was probably Panbers that was popular in the 1970s and 1980s. In the late 1980s to mid-1990s several female rock singers popularly known as \\"Lady Rockers\\" were famous in Indonesia, such as Nicky Astria and Anggun who started her career in as a pop-rock singer in Indonesia before moving to France and pursue her international career. Other notable rock bands include Slank and Jamrud. Metal bands also exist, such as the metalcore band Killing Me Inside. = Jazz fusion = Some of Indonesian musicians and bands were exploring the jazz music. Notable Indonesian jazz musicians include Jack Lesmana, Benny Likumahuwa, Benny Mustafa, Maryono, Bubi Chen Maliq & D'Essentials. Various other groups fuse contemporary westernised jazz fusion music with the traditional ethnic music traditions of their hometown. In the case of Krakatau and SambaSunda, the bands from West Java, the traditional Sundanese kacapi suling and gamelan orchestra is performed alongside drum set, keyboard and guitars. The Jakarta International Java Jazz Festival is performed annually. The latest development of Jazz in Indonesia reflected with many Jazz Festivals being held every year. =Notable contemporary artists= *Gesang *Titiek Puspa *Guruh Sukarnoputra *Gombloh *Bing Slamet *Benyamin Sueb *Chrisye *Harry Roesli (1950s‚Äì1970s) *Ebiet G.

With about 2,000 species in 12 families, they are one of the smaller insect orders. Earwigs have characteristic cerci, a pair of forceps-like pincers on their abdomen, and membranous wings folded underneath short, rarely used forewings, hence the scientific order name, \\"skin wings.\\" Some groups are tiny parasites on mammals and lack the typical pincers. Earwigs are found on all continents except Antarctica. Earwigs are mostly nocturnal and often hide in small, moist crevices during the day, and are active at night, feeding on a wide variety of insects and plants. Damage to foliage, flowers, and various crops is commonly blamed on earwigs, especially the common earwig Forficula auricularia. Earwigs have five molts in the year before they become adults. Many earwig species display maternal care, which is uncommon among insects. Female earwigs may care for their eggs, and even after they have hatched as nymphs will continue to watch over offspring until their second molt. As the nymphs molt, sexual dimorphism such as differences in pincer shapes begins to show. Some earwig specimen fossils are in the extinct suborders Archidermaptera or Eodermaptera, the former dating to the Late Triassic and the latter to the Middle Jurassic. Many orders of insect have been theorized to be closely related to earwigs, though the icebugs of Notoptera are most likely. Etymology Earwig diagram with wings extended and closed The scientific name for the order, \\"Dermaptera\\", is Greek in origin, stemming from the words derma, meaning skin, and pteron (plural ptera), wing. It was coined by Charles De Geer in 1773. The common term, earwig, is derived from the Old English , which means \\"ear\\", and , which means \\"insect\\", or literally, \\"beetle\\". Entomologists suggest that the origin of the name is a reference to the appearance of the hindwings, which are unique and distinctive among insects, and resemble a human ear when unfolded. The name is more popularly thought to be related to the old wives' tale that earwigs burrowed into the brains of humans through the ear and laid their eggs there. Earwigs are not known to purposely climb into ear canals, but there have been anecdotal reports of earwigs being found in the ear. Distribution An earwig from the Western Ghats Earwigs are abundant and can be found throughout the Americas and Eurasia. The common earwig was introduced into North America in 1907 from Europe, but tends to be more common in the southern and southwestern parts of the United States. The only native species of earwig found in the north of the United States is the spine-tailed earwig (Doru aculeatum), found as far north as Canada, where it hides in the leaf axils of emerging plants in southern Ontario wetlands. However, other families can be found in North America, including Forficulidae (Doru and Forficula being found there), Spongiphoridae, Anisolabididae, and Labiduridae. Few earwigs survive winter outdoors in cold climates. They can be found in tight crevices in woodland, fields and gardens. Out of about 1,800 species, about 25 occur in North America, 45 in Europe (including 7 in Great Britain), and 60 in Australia. Morphology Male earwig, external morphology. Click on image for a larger view Most earwigs are flattened (which allows them to fit inside tight crevices, such as under bark) with an elongated body generally long. The largest extant species is the Australian giant earwig (Titanolabis colossea) which is approximately long, while the possibly extinct Saint Helena earwig (Labidura herculeana) reached . Earwigs are characterized by the cerci, or the pair of forceps-like pincers on their abdomen; male earwigs generally have more curved pincers than females. These pincers are used to capture prey, defend themselves and fold their wings under the short tegmina. The antennae are thread-like with at least 10 segments. The forewings are short oblong leathery plates used to cover the hindwings like the elytra of a beetle, rather than to fly. Most species have short and leather-like forewings with very thin hindwings, though species in the former suborders Arixeniina and Hemimerina (epizoic species, sometimes considered as ectoparasites) are wingless and blind with filiform segmented cerci (today these are both included merely as families in the suborder Neodermaptera). The hindwing is a very thin membrane that expands like a fan, radiating from one point folded under the forewing. Even though most earwigs have wings and are capable of flight, they are rarely seen in flight. These wings are unique in venation and in the pattern of folding that requires the use of the cerci. =Internal= The neuroendocrine system is typical of insects. There is a brain, a subesophageal ganglion, three thoracic ganglia, and six abdominal ganglia. Strong neuron connections connect the neurohemal corpora cardiaca to the brain and frontal ganglion, where the closely related median corpus allatum produces juvenile hormone III in close proximity to the neurohemal dorsal arota. The digestive system of earwigs is like all other insects, consisting of a fore-, mid-, and hindgut, but earwigs lack gastric caecae which are specialized for digestion in many species of insect. Long, slender (excretory) malpighian tubules can be found between the junction of the mid- and hind gut. The reproductive system of females consist of paired ovaries, lateral oviducts, spermatheca, and a genital chamber. The lateral ducts are where the eggs leave the body, while the spermatheca is where sperm is stored. Unlike other insects, the gonopore, or genital opening is behind the seventh abdominal segment. The ovaries are primitive in that they are polytrophic (the nurse cells and oocytes alternate along the length of the ovariole). In some species these long ovarioles branch off the lateral duct, while in others, short ovarioles appear around the duct. Life cycle and reproduction The life cycle and development of a male earwig from egg to each instar Earwigs are hemimetabolous, meaning they undergo incomplete metamorphosis, developing through a series of 4 to 6 molts. The developmental stages between molts are called instars. Earwigs live for about a year from hatching. They start mating in the autumn, and can be found together in the autumn and winter. The male and female will live in a chamber in debris, crevices, or soil deep. After mating, the sperm may remain in the female for months before the eggs are fertilized. From midwinter to early spring, the male will leave, or be driven out by the female. Afterward the female will begin to lay 20 to 80 pearly white eggs in 2 days. Some earwigs, those parasitic in the suborders Arixeniina and Hemimerina, are viviparous (give birth to live young); they would be fed by a sort of placenta. When first laid, the eggs are white or cream-colored and oval-shaped, but right before hatching they become kidney- shaped and brown. Each egg is approximately tall and wide. Earwigs are among the few non-social insect species that show maternal care. The mother will pay close attention to the needs of her eggs, such as warmth and protection, though studies have shown that the mother does not pay attention to the eggs as she collects them. The mother has been shown to pick up wax balls by accident, but they would eventually be rejected as they do not have the proper scent. The mother will also faithfully defend the eggs from predators, not leaving them to eat unless the clutch goes bad. Another distinct maternal care unique to earwigs is that the mother continuously cleans the eggs to protect them from fungi. Studies have found that the urge to clean the eggs persists for days after they are removed; when the eggs were replaced after hatching, the mother continued to clean them for up to 3 months. File:Nesting Earwig Chester UK 1.jpgFemale earwig in her nest, with eggs File:Nesting Earwig Chester UK 2.jpgFemale earwig in her nest with newly hatched young The eggs hatch in about 7 days. The mother may assist the nymphs in hatching. When the nymphs hatch, they eat the egg casing and continue to live with the mother. The nymphs look similar to their parents, only smaller, and will nest under their mother and she will continue to protect them until their second molt. The nymphs feed on food regurgitated by the mother, and on their own molts. If the mother dies before the nymphs are ready to leave, the nymphs may eat her. File:Young Earwig at 4th instar.jpgAn earwig on a wall in Haldia, West Bengal, India. File:Young Earwig at 4th instar strolling on wooden door.jpgAn earwig on a wooden door in Haldia, West Bengal, India. After five to six instars, the nymphs will molt into adults. The male's forceps will become curved, while the females' forceps remain straight. They will also develop their natural color, which can be anything from a light brown (as in the Tawny earwig) to a dark black (as in the Ringlegged earwig). In species of winged earwigs, the wings will start to develop at this time. The forewings of an earwig are sclerotized to serve as protection for the membranous hindwings. Behavior Most earwigs are nocturnal and inhabit small crevices, living in small amounts of debris, in various forms such as bark and fallen logs. Species have been found to be blind and living in caves, or cavernicolous, reported to be found on the island of Hawaii and in South Africa. Food typically consists of a wide array of living and dead plant and animal matter. For protection from predators, the species Doru taeniatum of earwigs can squirt foul-smelling yellow liquid in the form of jets from scent glands on the dorsal side of the third and fourth abdominal segment. It aims the discharges by revolving the abdomen, a maneuver that enables it simultaneously to use its pincers in defense. Ecology Earwigs are mostly scavengers, but some are omnivorous or predatory. The abdomen of the earwig is flexible and muscular. It is capable of maneuvering as well as opening and closing the forceps. The forceps are used for a variety of purposes. In some species, the forceps have been observed in use for holding prey, and in copulation. The forceps tend to be more curved in males than in females. A male of Forficula auricularia feeding on flowers The common earwig is an omnivore, eating plants and ripe fruit as well as actively hunting arthropods. To a large extent, this species is also a scavenger, feeding on decaying plant and animal matter if given the chance. Observed prey include largely plant lice, but also large insects such as bluebottle flies and woolly aphids. Plants that they feed on typically include clover, dahlias, zinnias, butterfly bush, hollyhock, lettuce, cauliflower, strawberry, blackberry, sunflowers, celery, peaches, plums, grapes, potatoes, roses, seedling beans and beets, and tender grass shoots and roots; they have also been known to eat corn silk, damaging the corn. Species of the suborders Arixeniina and Hemimerina are generally considered epizoic, or living on the outside of other animals, mainly mammals. In the Arixeniina, family Arixeniidae, species of the genus Arixenia are normally found deep in the skin folds and gular pouch of Malaysian hairless bulldog bats (Cheiromeles torquatus), apparently feeding on bats' body or glandular secretions. On the other hand, species in the genus Xeniaria (still of the suborder Arixeniina) are believed to feed on the guano and possibly the guanophilous arthropods in the bat's roost, where it has been found. Hemimerina includes Araeomerus found in the nest of Long-tailed pouch rats (Beamys), and Hemimerus which are found on Giant Cricetomys rats. Earwigs are generally nocturnal, and typically hide in small, dark, and often moist areas in the daytime. They can usually be seen on household walls and ceilings. Interaction with earwigs at this time results in a defensive free-fall to the ground followed by a scramble to a nearby cleft or crevice. During the summer they can be found around damp areas such as near sinks and in bathrooms. Earwigs tend to gather in shady cracks or openings or anywhere that they can remain concealed during daylight. Picnic tables, compost and waste bins, patios, lawn furniture, window frames, or anything with minute spaces (even artichoke blossoms) can potentially harbour them. =Predators and parasites= Earwigs are regularly preyed upon by birds, and like many other insect species they are prey for insectivorous mammals, amphibians, lizards, centipedes, assassin bugs, and spiders.Arnold, Richard A. \\"Earwigs.\\" Endangered Wildlife and Plants of the World. Vol. 4. Eds. Anne Hildyard, Paul Thompson and Amy Prior. (Tarrytown, New York: Marshall Cavendish Corporation, 2001) 497. European naturalists have observed bats preying upon earwigs. Their primary insect predators are parasitic species of Tachinidae, or tachinid flies, whose larvae are endoparasites. One species of tachinid fly, Triarthria setipennis, has been demonstrated to be successful as a biological control of earwigs for almost a century.Dimick, R.E. and Mote, D.C. (1934) Progress report regarding the introduction in Oregon of Digonocheata setipennis, a tachinid parasite of the European earwig. Journal of Economic Entomology 27, 863-865.Clausen, C.P.

Introduced Parasites and Predators of Arthropod Pests and Weeds: A World Review, Handbook No. 480, United States Department of Agriculture, Washington, DC, pp. 15-18. Another tachinid fly and parasite of earwigs, Ocytata pallipes, has shown promise as a biological control agent as well.Kuhlmann, Ulrich. (26 Aug 2009) \\"Ocytata pallipes (Fall√©n) (Dipt., Tachinidae), a potential agent for the biological control of the European earwig.\\" Journal of Applied Entomology, Vol. 117, Issue 1-5, pp. 262-7. The common predatory wasp, the yellow jacket (Vespula maculifrons), preys upon earwigs when abundant.Kurczewski, Frank E. \\"Vespula maculifrons (Hymenoptera: Vespidae) Preying on the European Earwig Forficula auricularia.\\" Journal of the New York Entomological Society, Vol. 76, No. 2 (Jun., 1968), pp. 84-86. A small species of roundworm, Mermis nigrescens, is known to occasionally parasitize earwigs that have consumed roundworm eggs with plant matter.Marshall, Judith A. \\"Dermaptera: the earwigs.\\" Identifying British Insects and Arachnids: An Annotated Bibliography of Key Works. ed. Peter C. Barnard. (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1999) 40. At least 26 species of parasitic fungus from the order Laboulbeniales have been found on earwigs.Shanor, Leland. \\"The Characteristics and Morphology of a New Genus of the Laboulbeniales on an Earwig.\\" American Journal of Botany, Vol. 39, No. 7 (Jul. 1952), pp. 498-504. The eggs and nymphs are also cannibalized by other earwigs. A species of tyroglyphoid mite, Histiostoma polypori (Histiostomatidae, Astigmata), are observed on common earwigs, sometimes in great densities;Behura, Basanta Kumar. \\"The Relationships of the Tyroglyphoid Mite, Histiostoma Polypori (Oud.) with the Earwig, Forficula Auricularia Linn.\\" Journal of the New York Entomological Society, Vol. 64, (1956), pp. 85-94. however, this mite feeds on earwig cadavers and not its live earwig transportation.Wirth, S. \\"Necromenic life style of Histiostoma polypori (Acari: Histiostomatidae)\\" Journal Experimental and Applied Acarology, Volume 49, Number 4 (December, 2009) pp. 317-327.

Evolution Arixenia esau from the extinct suborder Arixeniina Hemimerus hanseni from the extinct suborder Hemimerina The fossil record of the Dermaptera starts in the Late Triassic to Early Jurassic period about in England and Australia, and comprises about 70 specimens in the extinct suborder Archidermaptera. Some of the traits believed by neontologists to belong to modern earwigs are not found in the earliest fossils, but adults had five-segmented tarsi (the final segment of the leg), well developed ovipositors, veined tegmina (forewings) and long segmented cerci; in fact the pincers would not have been curled or used as they are now. The theorized stem group of the Dermaptera are the Protelytroptera. These insects, which resemble modern Blattodea, or cockroaches owing to shell-like forewings and the large, unequal anal fan, are known from the Permian of North America, Europe and Australia. There are no fossils from the Triassic when the morphological changes from Protelytroptera to Dermaptera took place. The most likely, and most closely resembling, related order of insects is Notoptera, theorized by Giles in 1963. However, other arguments have been made by other authors linking them to Phasmatodea, Embioptera, Plecoptera, and Dictyoptera. Archidermaptera is believed to be sister to the remaining earwig groups, the extinct Eodermaptera and the living suborder Neodermaptera (= former suborders Forficulina, Hemimerina, and Arixeniina). The extinct suborders have tarsi with five segments (unlike the three found in Neodermaptera) as well as unsegmented cerci. No fossil Hemimeridae and Arixeniidae are known. Species in Hemimeridae were at one time in their own order, Diploglassata, Dermodermaptera, or Hemimerina. Like most other epizoic species, there is no fossil record, but they are probably no older than late Tertiary. Some evidence of early evolutionary history is the structure of the antennal heart, a separate circulatory organ consisting of two ampullae, or vesicles, that are attached to the frontal cuticle to the bases of the antennae. These features have not been found in other insects. An independent organ exists for each antenna, consisting of an ampulla, attached to the frontal cuticle medial to the antenna base and forming a thin-walled sac with a valved ostium on its ventral side. They pump blood by elastic connective tissue, rather than muscle. Molecular studies suggest that this order is the sister to Plecoptera or to Ephemeroptera.Wan X, Kim MI, Kim MJ, Kim I (2012) Complete mitochondrial genome of the free-living earwig, Challia fletcheri (Dermaptera: Pygidicranidae) and phylogeny of Polyneoptera. PLoS One 7(8):e42056. Taxonomy =Distinguishing characteristics= The characteristics which distinguish the order Dermaptera from other insect orders are:Gillot, C. Entomology 2nd Ed. (1995) Springer, , . Accessed on Google Books on 25 November 2009. * General body shape: Elongate; dorso-ventrally flattened. * Head: Prognathous. Antennae are segmented. Biting-type mouthparts. Ocelli absent. Compound eyes in most species, reduced or absent in some taxa. * Appendages: Two pairs of wings normally present. The forewings are modified into short smooth, veinless tegmina. Hindwings are membranous and semicircular with veins radiating outwards. * Abdomen: Cerci are unsegmented and resemble forceps. The ovipositor in females is reduced or absent. The overwhelming majority of earwig species are in Forficulina, grouped into nine families of 180 genera, including Forficula auricularia, the common European Earwig. Species within Forficulina are free-living, have functional wings and are not parasites. The cerci are unsegmented and modified into large, forceps-like structures. The first epizoic species of earwig was discovered by a London taxidermist on the body of a Malaysian hairless bulldog bat in 1909, then described by Karl Jordan. By the 1950s, the two suborders Arixeniina and Hemimerina had been added to Dermaptera. Arixeniina represents two genera, Arixenia and Xeniaria, with a total of five species in them. As with Hemimerina, they are blind and wingless, with filiform segmented cerci. Hemimerina are viviparous ectoparasites, preferring the fur of African rodents in either Cricetomys or Beamys genera. Hemimerina also has two genera, Hemimerus and Araeomerus, with a total of 11 species. =Phylogeny= A female of the common earwig in a threat pose Dermaptera is relatively small compared to the other orders of Insecta, with only about 2,000 species, 3 suborders and 15 families, including the extinct suborders Archidermaptera and Eodermaptera with their extinct families Protodiplatyidae, Dermapteridae, Semenoviolidae, and Turanodermatidae. The phylogeny of the Dermaptera is still debated. The extant Dermaptera appear to be monophyletic and there is support for the monophyly of the families Forficulidae, Chelisochidae, Labiduridae and Anisolabididae, however evidence has supported the conclusion that the former suborder Forficulina was paraphyletic through the exclusion of Hemimerina and Arixeniina which should instead be nested within the Forficulina. Thus, these former suborders were eliminated in the most recent higher classification. Relationship with humans Earwigs are fairly abundant and are found in many areas around the world. There is no evidence that they transmit diseases to humans or other animals. Their pincers are commonly believed to be dangerous, but in reality, even the curved pincers of males cause little or no harm to humans. Earwigs have been rarely known to crawl into the ears of humans, but they do not lay eggs inside the human body or human brain. There is a debate whether earwigs are harmful or beneficial to crops, as they eat both the foliage and the insects eating such foliage, such as aphids, though it would take a large population to do considerable damage. The common earwig eats a wide variety of plants, and also a wide variety of foliage, including the leaves and petals. They have been known to cause economic losses in fruit and vegetable crops. Some examples are the flowers, hops, red raspberries, and corn crops in Germany, and in the south of France, earwigs have been observed feeding on peaches and apricots. The earwigs attacked mature plants and made cup-shaped bite marks in diameter. In literature and folklore * Oscar Cook wrote the short story (appearing in Switch On The Light, April, 1931; A Century Of Creepy Stories 1934; Pan Horror 2, 1960) Boomerang, which was later adapted by Rod Serling for the Night Gallery tv-series episode, The Caterpillar. It tells the tale of the use of an earwig as a murder instrument applied by a man obsessed with the wife of an associate. * Robert Herrick in Hesperides describes a feast attended by Queen Titania through writing: \\"Beards of mice, a newt's stew'd thigh, A bloated Earwig and a fly\\". * Thomas Hood discusses the myth of earwigs finding shelter in the human ear in the poem \\"Love Lane\\" by saying the following: 'Tis vain to talk of hopes and fears, / And hope the least reply to wing, / From any maid that stops her ears / In dread of earwigs creeping in!\\"Love Lane Poetry Nook. * In some parts of rural England the earwig is called \\"battle-twig\\", which is present in Alfred, Lord Tennyson's poem The Spinster's Sweet-Arts: 'Twur as bad as battle-twig 'ere i' my oan blue chamber to me.\\" * In some regions of Japan, earwigs are called \\"Chinpo-Basami\\" or \\"Chinpo-Kiri\\", which means \\"penis cutter\\". Kenta Takada, a Japanese cultural entomologist, has inferred that these names may be derived from the fact that earwigs were seen around old Japanese-style toilets. *In Roald Dahl's children's book George's Marvellous Medicine, George's Grandma encourages him to eat unwashed celery with beetles and earwigs still on them. A big fat earwig is very tasty,‚Äô Grandma said, licking her lips. ‚ÄòBut you‚Äôve got to be very quick, my dear, when you put one of those in your mouth. It has a pair of sharp nippers on its back end and if it grabs your tongue with those, it never lets go. So you‚Äôve got to bite the earwig first, chop chop, before it bites you.\\" References External links * Earwig Research Center by Fabian Haas, Heilbronn * Dermaptera Species File by Heidi Hopkins, Michael D.

Life and career Born in Illinois, Clara (n√©e Swerdlove, other as Sverdlov) Peller lived for most of her early life in Chicago. Her parents, Judith and Wolf Swerdlove, had eight children. Wolf left Russia when he was being drafted for the second time, and they settled down in Illinois. Clara married at age 20 to a local jeweler; she was divorced eight years later, with two children, a boy and a girl. She worked for 35 years as a manicurist at a local Chicago beauty salon, and later moved to the suburban North Shore area to be near her daughter, Marlene Necheles. At age 80, Peller was hired as a temporary manicurist for a television commercial set in a Chicago barbershop. Impressed by her no-nonsense manners and unique voice, the agency later asked her to sign a contract as an actress for the agency. Though hard of hearing and suffering from emphysema, which limited her ability to speak long lines of dialogue, Peller was quickly used in a number of TV spot advertisements. She first attracted attention as a comical cleaning lady in an advertisement for the new Massachusetts State Lottery game \\"Megabucks\\" in the late 1970s,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A9Sl4eaBiu0 YouTube, \\"Megabucks TV spot\\" and later nationally in a series of commercials for the Wendy's Restaurant chain.Seger, Linda, Creating Unforgettable Characters, New York: Macmillan Press (1990), , , p. 25 =Wendy's campaign= First airing on January 10, 1984, the Wendy's commercial portrayed a fictional fast-food competitor entitled \\"Big Bun\\", where three elderly ladies are served an enormous hamburger bun containing a minuscule hamburger patty.

Per the terms of her Screen Actors Guild union contract, the actress was free to participate in any commercials for products, goods or services, which did not directly compete with Wendy's hamburgers. She subsequently signed a contract with the Campbell Soup Company to appear in an advertisement for Prego Pasta Plus spaghetti sauce. In the Prego commercial, Peller examines the Prego sauce and after wondering \\"Where's the beef?\\" declares, \\"I found it! I really found it\\". However, after the Prego commercial aired on television in 1985, Wendy's management decided to terminate her contract, contending that the Prego commercial implies \\"that Clara found the beef at somewhere other than Wendy's restaurants\\".Time Magazine, Investments: An Affirmative Action; Advertising: It's Over There, in the Spaghetti April 1, 1985 In announcing the dismissal, Wendy's Denny Lynch stated, \\"Clara can find the beef only in one place, and that is Wendy's\\".Clara Peller , Advertising Mascots-People, TVacres.com Peller's response was short and swift: \\"I've made them millions, and they don't appreciate me.\\" Following the conclusion of the \\"Where's the beef\\" campaign, Wendy's Restaurants entered a two-year sales slump.Wendy's Shuffles Command; High Level Execs Put In Charge Of Store Groups, Nation's Restaurant News, May 18, 1987 Vice President Lynch later admitted that consumer awareness of the Wendy's brand did not recover for another five years, with the advent of a new, humorous line of TV commercials featuring the brand's founder, Dave Thomas.Foltz, Kim, \\"The Media Business: Advertising; At Wendy's, Folksiness Is Effective\\", The New York Times, August 22, 1990 =Final appearances and death= Despite the setback with Wendy's, Peller continued to make the most of her new-found fame, granting numerous press interviews and making several guest TV appearances. She regularly amused interviewers and friends by claiming not to know exactly how old she was, once telling a frustrated Social Security clerk (who was given three different ages by Peller) that she was \\"whichever one will get me Social Security.\\" On April 14, 1984, Peller made an uncredited cameo appearance on Saturday Night Live which was hosted that night by 1972 Democratic presidential candidate George McGovern. She also made an appearance in the low-budget 1985 Neal Israel comedy Moving Violations as the friend of Nedra Volz's character, who was a haphazard driver needing to renew her license at traffic school.

L. Gore and Associates. Invented in 1969, Gore-Tex can repel liquid water while allowing water vapor to pass through and is designed to be a lightweight, waterproof fabric for all-weather use. It is composed of stretched polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE), which is more commonly known by the generic trademark Teflon. The material is formally known as the generic term expanded PTFE (ePTFE). History  Gore-Tex was co-invented by Wilbert L. Gore and Gore's son, Robert W. Gore. In 1969, Bob Gore stretched heated rods of polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) and created expanded polytetrafluoroethylene (ePTFE). His discovery of the right conditions for stretching PTFE was a happy accident, born partly of frustration. Instead of slowly stretching the heated material, he applied a sudden, accelerating yank. The solid PTFE unexpectedly stretched about 800%, forming a microporous structure that was about 70% air. It was introduced to the public under the trademark Gore-Tex. Gore promptly applied for and obtained the following patents: * , issued April 27, 1976, for a porous form of polytetrafluoroethylene with a micro-structure characterized by nodes interconnected by fibrils * , issued February 5, 1980 * on March 18, 1980 for a \\"waterproof laminate\\", together with Samuel Allen Another form of stretched PTFE tape was produced prior to Gore-Tex in 1966, by John W. Cropper of New Zealand. Cropper had developed and constructed a machine for this use. However, Cropper chose to keep the process of creating expanded PTFE as a closely held trade secret and as such, it had remained unpublished. In the 1970s Garlock, Inc. allegedly infringed Gore's patents by using Cropper's machine and was sued by Gore in the Federal District Court of Ohio. The District Court held Gore's product and process patents to be invalid after a \\"bitterly contested case\\" that \\"involved over two years of discovery, five weeks of trial, the testimony of 35 witnesses (19 live, 16 by deposition), and over 300 exhibits\\" (quoting the Federal Circuit). On appeal, however, the Federal Circuit disagreed in the famous case of Gore v. Garlock, reversing the lower court's decision on the ground, as well as others, that Cropper forfeited any superior claim to the invention by virtue of having concealed the process for making ePTFE from the public. As a public patent had not been filed, the new form of the material could not be legally recognised. Gore was thereby established as the legal inventor of ePTFE. Following the Gore v. Garlock decision, Gore sued C. R. Bard for allegedly infringing its patent by making ePTFE vascular grafts. Bard promptly settled and agreed to exit the market. Gore next sued IMPRA, Inc., a smaller maker of ePTFE vascular grafts, in the federal district court in Arizona. IMPRA had a competing patent application for the ePTFE vascular graft. In a nearly decade-long patent/antitrust battle (1984‚Äì1993), IMPRA proved that Gore-Tex was identical to prior art disclosed in a Japanese process patent by duplicating the prior art process and through statistical analysis, and also proved that Gore had withheld the best mode for using its patent, and the main claim of Gore's product patent was declared invalid in 1990. In 1996, IMPRA was purchased by Bard and Bard was thereby able to reenter the market. After IMPRA's vascular graft patent was issued, Bard sued Gore for infringing it. Gore-Tex is used in products manufactured by many different companies. Other products have come to market exploiting similar technologies following the expiry of the main Gore- Tex patent.Logue, Victoria. (2005). Hiking and Backpacking. Menasha Ridge Press. p. 74. . For his invention, Robert W. Gore was inducted into the U.S. National Inventors Hall of Fame in 2006. In 2015, Gore was ordered by the Federal Circuit Court of Appeals to pay Bard $1 billion in damages. The U.S. Supreme Court declined to review the Federal Circuit's decision. Manufacture Schematic of a composite fabric for outdoor clothing PTFE is made using an emulsion polymerization process that utilizes the fluorosurfactant PFOA, a persistent environmental contaminant. In 2013, Gore eliminated the use of PFOAs in the manufacture of its weatherproof functional fabrics. Design Effect of water repellent on a shell layer jacket (Hagl√∂fs Heli II) Gore-Tex materials are typically based on thermo-mechanically expanded PTFE and other fluoropolymer products. They are used in a wide variety of applications such as high-performance fabrics, medical implants, filter media, insulation for wires and cables, gaskets, and sealants. However, Gore-Tex fabric is best known for its use in protective, yet breathable, rainwear. The simplest sort of rain wear is a two layer sandwich. The outer layer is typically woven nylon or polyester and provides strength. The inner one is polyurethane (abbreviated: PU), and provides water resistance, at the cost of breathability. Early Gore-Tex fabric replaced the inner layer of PU with a thin, porous fluoropolymer membrane (Teflon) coating that is bonded to a fabric. This membrane had about 9 billion pores per square inch (around 1.4 billion pores per square centimeter). Each pore is approximately the size of a water droplet, making it impenetrable to liquid water while still allowing the more volatile water vapour molecules to pass through. The outer layer of Gore- Tex fabric is coated on the outside with a Durable Water Repellent (DWR) treatment. The DWR prevents the main outer layer from becoming wet, which would reduce the breathability of the whole fabric. However, the DWR is not responsible for the jacket being waterproof. Without the DWR, the outer layer would become soaked, there would be no breathability, and the wearer's sweat being produced on the inside would fail to evaporate, leading to dampness there. This might give the appearance that the fabric is leaking, but it is not. Wear and cleaning will reduce the performance of Gore-Tex fabric by wearing away this Durable Water Repellent (DWR) treatment. The DWR can be reinvigorated by tumble drying the garment or ironing on a low setting. Gore requires that all garments made from their material have taping over the seams, to eliminate leaks. Gore's sister product, Windstopper, is similar to Gore-Tex in being windproof and breathable and it can stretch but it is not waterproof. The Gore naming system does not imply specific technology or material but instead specific set of performance characteristics. Clothing technology Expanded polytetrafluoroethylene is used in clothing due to its breathability and water protection capabilities. It is used in rain jackets, and ePTFE can now be found in space suits and heart patches. Other uses Gore-Tex is also used internally in medical applications, because it is nearly inert inside the body. Specifically, expanded polytetrafluoroethylene (E-PTFE) can undergo the form of a fabric-like mesh. Implementing and applying the mesh form in the medical field is a promising type of technological material feature. In addition, the porosity of Gore-Tex permits the body's own tissue to grow through the material, integrating grafted material into the circulation system. Gore-Tex is used in a wide variety of medical applications, including sutures, vascular grafts, heart patches, and synthetic knee ligaments, which have saved thousands of lives. In the form of expanded polytetrafluoroethylene (E-PTFE), Gore-Tex has been shown to be a reliable synthetic, medical material in treating patients with nasal dorsal interruptions. In more recent observations, expanded polytetrafluoroethylene (E-PTFE) has recently been used as membrane implants for glaucoma surgery. Gore-Tex has been used for many years in the conservation of illuminated manuscripts. Explosive sensors have been printed on Gore-Tex clothing leading to the sensitive voltametric detection of nitroaromatic compounds. Gore-Tex is also used as a membrane in sealed battery products, to allow pressure relief from outgassing, but preventing ingress of moisture. The \\"Gore-Tex\\" brand name was formerly used for industrial and medical products.

The Great Highland bagpipe ( \\"the great pipe\\") is a type of bagpipe native to Scotland. It has acquired widespread recognition through its usage in the British military and in pipe bands throughout the world. The bagpipe is first attested in Scotland around 1400,Collinson, 135 having previously appeared in European artwork in Spain in the 13th century. The earliest references to bagpipes in Scotland are in a military context, and it is in that context that the Great Highland bagpipe became established in the British military and achieved the widespread prominence it enjoys today, whereas other bagpipe traditions throughout Europe, ranging from Portugal to Russia, almost universally went into decline by the late 19th and early 20th century. Though widely famous for its role in military and civilian pipe bands, the Great Highland bagpipe is also used for a solo virtuosic style called p√¨obaireachd, ce√≤l m√≤r, or simply pibroch.  History  Bagpiper carved around 1600 Though popular belief sets varying dates for the introduction of bagpipes to Scotland, concrete evidence is limited until approximately the 15th century. One clan still owns a remnant of a set of bagpipes said to have been carried at the Battle of Bannockburn in 1314, though the veracity of this claim is debated.The bagpipe: the history of a musical instrument. Francis M. Collinson. Routledge, 1975 , . Pg 132 There are many ancient legends and stories about bagpipes which were passed down through minstrels and oral tradition, whose origins are now lost. However, textual evidence for Scottish bagpipes is more definite in 1396, when records of the Battle of the North Inch of Perth reference \\"warpipes\\" being carried into battle.Collinson, 135 These references may be considered evidence as to the existence of particularly Scottish bagpipes, but evidence of a form peculiar to the Highlands appears in a poem written in 1598 and later published in The Complaynt of Scotland which refers to several types of pipe, including the Highland: \\"On hieland pipes, Scotte and Hybernicke / Let heir be shraichs of deadlie clarions.\\"Collinson, 141. In 1746, after the forces loyal to the Hanoverian government had defeated the Jacobites in the Battle of Culloden, King George II attempted to assimilate the Highlands into Great Britain by weakening Gaelic culture and the Scottish clan system, though the oft-repeated claim that the Act of Proscription 1746 banned the Highland bagpipes is not substantiated by the text itself, nor by any record of any prosecutions under this act for playing or owning bagpipes. However, the loss of the clan chief's power and patronage and widespread emigration did contribute to its decline. It was soon realised that Highlanders made excellent troops and a number of regiments were raised from the Highlands over the second half of the eighteenth century. Although the early history of pipers within these regiments is not well documented, there is evidence that these regiments had pipers at an early stage and there are numerous accounts of pipers playing into battle during the 19th century, a practice which continued into World War I when it was abandoned after the early battles, due to the high casualty rate. The custom was revived by the 51st Highland Division for their assault on the enemy lines at the start of the Second Battle of El Alamein on 23 October 1943. Each attacking company was led by a piper, playing tunes that would allow other units to recognise which Highland regiment they belonged to. Although the attack was successful, losses among the pipers were high, and they were not used in combat again during the war. The Calgary Highlanders had company pipers play during the unit's first battle in Normandy in July 1944, but likewise refrained from using pipers again for the rest of the war.Bercuson, David Battalion of Heroes: The History of the Calgary Highlanders in World War II A final use of the pipes in combat was in 1967 during the Aden Emergency, when 1st Battalion, The Argyll and Sutherland Highlanders were led into the rebel-held Crater district by their pipe major playing the regimental marches.1st Battalion The Argyll and Sutherland Highlanders ‚Äì Aden 1967 ‚Äì The Re-entry into Crater  Design  A selection of bagpipe reeds of various design, chanter reeds on the left, drone reeds on the right The Great Highland bagpipe is classified as a woodwind instrument, like the bassoon, oboe, and clarinet. Although it is further classified as a double-reed instrument, the reeds are all closed inside the wooden \\"stocks\\", instead of being played directly by mouth as most other woodwinds are. The Great Highland bagpipe actually has four reeds: the chanter reed (double), two tenor drone reeds (single), and one bass drone reed (single). A modern set has a bag, a chanter, a blowpipe, two tenor drones, and one bass drone. The scale of the chanter is in Mixolydian mode, which has a flattened seventh scale degree. It has a range from one whole tone lower than the tonic to one octave above it. The drones are tuned to this tonic note, called A (specifically A4). The nine notes of the chanter scale are \\"low G, low A, B, C (sounds as a C), D, E, F (sounds as a F), high G, and high A\\". However, the A pitch of most pipers and pipe bands currently is somewhere around 470‚Äì480 Hz, which is actually sharper than standard pitch B4 at 466.16 Hz. So the scale actually sounds closest to A, B, C, D, E, F, G, A, B, and can be considered a transposing instrument in E-flat major. Historically it was indeed flatter, as evidenced by recordings, and extant instruments. Highland bagpipe music is written in the key of D major, where the C and F are sharp (despite the key- signature usually being omitted from scores), however only some tunes are in D major. Due to the lack of chromatic notes, to change key is also to change modes; tunes are in A Mixolydian (most commonly), D major, B minor, or occasionally E Dorian. In concert pitch (notes on the piano) it will be B Mixolydian, E major, C Aeolian, or occasionally F Dorian. Traditionally, certain notes were sometimes tuned slightly off from just intonation. For example, on some old chanters the D and high G would be somewhat sharp. According to Forsyth (1935),Cecil Forsyth. Orchestration, 2nd Edition (London: MacMillan & Co. Ltd., 1935, 1948) the C and F holes were traditionally bored exactly midway between those for B and D and those for E and G, respectively, resulting in approximately a quarter-tone difference from just intonation, somewhat like a \\"blue\\" note in jazz.In Hirt, Aindrias \\"Addendum to 'The Devolution of the Shepherd Trumpet and It's Seminal Importance in Music History'\\", http://trumpetguild.org/journal-supplements, Hirt believes that the bagpipe scale is a linear and the pipe's F matches the D shepherd trumpet's 11th partial; the 11th partial is exactly halfway between E and G. Both play tunes together in the \\"rural mode\\". Today, however, the notes of the chanter are usually tuned in just intonation to the Mixolydian scale. The two tenor drones are an octave below the keynote of the chanter (low A), and the bass drone two octaves below. There are some documented examples of other tunings: Forsyth lists three traditional drone tunings: Ellis, A3‚ÄìA3‚ÄìA2; Glen, A4‚ÄìA4‚ÄìA2; and Mackay, G3‚ÄìB3‚ÄìC2. Modern developments have included reliable synthetic drone reeds as well as synthetic bags that deal with moisture arguably better than hide bags. The chanter reed is typically made out of cane. It is possible to get synthetic reeds for chanters but it is not very common. The cane reeds change pitch as the moisture levels change, meaning that as they are played they go out of tune. Until recently drone reeds were also cane but now many pipers have substituted cane reeds for synthetic reeds. Cane drone reeds are incredibly unreliable; they could stop working without warning and also change pitch as they are played. Synthetic reeds are much more reliable, they are easier to use and don't change pitch meaning once the drones are tuned to each other they will stay there and only have to be tuned to the chanter.  Materials  Highland pipes were originally constructed of such locally available woods as holly, laburnum, and boxwood. Later, as expanding colonisation and trade provided access to more exotic woods, tropical hardwoods including cocuswood (from the Caribbean), ebony (from West Africa and South and Southeast Asia) and African blackwood (from sub-Saharan Africa) became standard in the late 18th and early 19th century. In the modern day, synthetic materials, particularly Polypenco, have become quite popular, especially among pipe bands where uniformity of chanters is desirable. Ornamentation on stands of pipes can be made from: ivory, horn, nickel, German silver, silver, stainless steel, imitation ivory (often catalin or possibly bakelite depending on the year the pipes were made), or other exotic woods.  Music  Thistle Chapel, Edinburgh The Scottish Gaelic word simply means \\"pipe music\\", but it has been adapted into English as piobaireachd or pibroch. In Gaelic, this, the \\"great music\\" of the Great Highland bagpipe is referred to as ce√≤l m√≤r, and \\"light music\\" (such as marches and dance tunes) is referred to as ce√≤l beag. Ce√≤l m√≤r consists of a slow \\"ground\\" movement () which is a simple theme, then a series of increasingly complex variations on this theme, and ends with a return to the ground. Ce√≤l beag includes marches (, , , , etc.), dance tunes (particularly strathspeys, reels, hornpipes, and jigs), slow airs, and more. The ce√≤l m√≤r style was developed by the well- patronized dynasties of bagpipers MacArthurs, MacGregors, Rankins, and especially the MacCrimmons and seems to have emerged as a distinct form during the 17th century. Compared to many other musical instruments, the Great Highland bagpipe is limited by its range (nine notes), lack of dynamics, and the enforced legato style, due to the continuous airflow from the bag. The Great Highland bagpipe is a closed reed instrument, which means that the four reeds are completely encased within the instrument and the player cannot change the sound of the instrument via mouth position or tonguing. As a result, notes cannot be separated by simply stopping blowing or tonguing, so grace notes and combinations of grace notes, called \\"embellishments\\", are used for this purpose. These are more complicated ornaments using two or more grace notes include doublings, taorluaths, throws, grips, and birls. There are also a set of ornaments usually used for p√¨obaireachd, for example the dare, vedare, chedare, darado, taorluath and crunluath. Some of these embellishments have found their way into light music over the course of the 20th century. These embellishments are also used for note emphasis, for example to emphasize the beat note or other phrasing patterns. These three single grace notes (G, D, and E) are the most commonly used and are often played in succession. All grace notes are performed rapidly, by quick finger movements, giving an effect similar to tonguing or articulation on modern wind instruments. Due to the lack of rests and dynamics, all expression in Great Highland bagpipe music comes from the use of embellishments and to a larger degree by varying the duration of notes. Despite the fact that most Great Highland bagpipe music is highly rhythmically regimented and structured, proper phrasing of all types of Great Highland bagpipe music relies heavily on the ability of the player to stretch specific notes within a phrase or measure. In particular, the main beats and off-beats of each phrase are structured. However, sub-divisions within each beat are flexible. \\"Few attempts have been made hitherto to combine the bagpipes with classical orchestral instruments, due mainly to conflicts of balance and tuning,\\" said composer Graham Waterhouse about his work Chieftain's Salute Op. 34a for Great Highland Bagpipe and String Orchestra (2001). \\"A satisfactory balance was achieved in this piece by placing the piper at a distance from the orchestra.\\" Peter Maxwell Davies' Orkney Wedding, With Sunrise (1985) also features a Great Highland Bagpipe solo towards the end. Bagpipes are rarely played with other instruments due to their tuning. Most other instruments tune at standard concert pitch which is 440 Hz whilst a bagpipe tunes between around 475 Hz and 485 Hz depending on humidity levels. It is possible to change the pitch by using different chanters and reeds, which is why bagpipes are sometimes used with other instruments however, the pipes sound sweeter when played at the pitch they are supposed to be played at.  Cultural role  The Great Highland Bagpipe plays a role as both a solo and ensemble instrument. In ensembles, it is generally played as part of a pipe band. One notable form of solo employment is the position of Piper to the Sovereign, a piper tasked to perform for the British sovereign, a position dating back to the time of Queen Victoria.  Popular music  The great highland bagpipes have played a minor, but not insignificant role in rock and pop music. Well known examples of songs giving prominence to bagpipes include: *\\"Mull of Kintyre\\" by Wings featuring the Campbeltown Pipe Band *\\"It's a Long Way to the Top (If You Wanna Rock 'n' Roll)\\" by AC/DC played by Bon Scott Further examples can be found at List of nontraditional bagpipe usage.  Worldwide diffusion  The Great Highland Bagpipe is widely used by both soloists and pipe bands, both civilian and military, and is now played in countries around the world. It is particularly popular in areas with large Scottish and Irish emigrant populations, mainly England, Canada, the United States, Australia, New Zealand and South Africa. = Former British Empire = The Great Highland Bagpipe has also been adopted by many countries that were formerly part of the British Empire, despite their lack of a Scottish or Irish population. These countries include India, Pakistan, Nepal, Malaysia and Singapore. The Great Highland Bagpipe also spread to parts of Africa and the Middle East where the British military's use of pipes made a favourable impression. Piping spread to Arabic countries such as Jordan, Egypt and Oman, some of whom had previously existing bagpipe traditions. In Oman, the instrument is called habban and is used in cities such as Muscat, Salalah, and Sohar. In Uganda president Idi Amin forbade the export of African blackwood, to encourage local bagpipe construction, during the 1970s. = Thailand = The Great Highland Bagpipe was also adopted in Thailand; around 1921, King Rama VI ordered a set to accompany the marching exercises of the Sua Pa Wild Tiger Corps. This was a royal guard unit which had previously practiced to the sounds of an oboe called pi chawa. Although the bagpipes arrived from the British Isles with a user's manual, no one was able to figure out how to play them, so bassoon player Khun Saman Siang-prajak went to the British Embassy and learned how to play the instrument with the British soldiers, and then became instructor to the rest of the Corps. The band, which plays Thai as well as Scottish tunes, still practices at Vachiravuth High School in Bangkok, which is named for Rama VI.Roongruang, Panya (1999). \\"Thai Classical Music and its Movement from Oral to Written Transmission, 1930‚Äì1942: Historical Context, Method, and Legacy of the Thai Music Manuscript Project.\\" PhD dissertation. Kent, Ohio: Kent State University, p. 146. = Brittany = Breton bagad of Lann-Bihou√© of the French Navy. During the First World War, some Breton pipers serving in the French Army came in contact with the pipers of Scottish regiments,as shown, for instance, by PM W.Lawrie's tune \\"The 8th Argyll's farewell to the 116th R√©giment de Ligne\\", published in Vol.2 of the Scots Guards Standard Settings, the 116th being a line infantry regiment based in Vannes during the Great War. For more details read in Major H.W. Brewsher's \\"History of the 51st (Highland) Division\\", Blackwood, Edinburgh, 1921, p.31 details of the relief of the 116th R√©giment d'Infanterie by the 8th Argyll Regiment on 30 July 1915, and subsequent composing of the tune by P.M. Lawrie and brought back home a few Great Highland Bagpipes which Breton pipe-makers started copying. Polig Monjarret led the introduction of the Great Highland bagpipe to Brittany during the Celtic revival of the 1920s Breton folk music scene, inventing the bagad, a pipe band incorporating a binio√π braz section, a bombarde section, a drums section, and in recent years almost any added grouping of wind instruments such as the saxophones, and brass instruments such as the trumpet and trombone. Well known bagado√π include Bagad Kemper, Kevrenn Alre, Bagad Brieg and Bagad Cap Caval. In Brittany, the Great Highland bagpipe is known as the binio√π braz, in contrast to the binio√π kozh, the small traditional Breton bagpipe. One notable development of the Highland bagpipe in Brittany is the creation of slightly shorter drones in C (Scottish \\"B\\"; see notes on tuning above), so that the many tunes played in that key will have drone accompaniment in the tonic. Many bagad pipers will keep two sets of pipes, one in standard B (Scottish \\"A\\") and one in C, and a whole suite may be performed in C.  Notable bands  Musicians from The City of Auckland Pipe Band playing \\"Amazing Grace\\" during the festival interceltique de Lorient in 2016. Some of the most famous pipe bands in the world are the Shotts and Dykehead Caledonia Pipe Band, Simon Fraser University Pipe Band (SFUPB), The Inveraray & District Pipe Band, The Field Marshal Montgomery Pipe Band and the St. Laurence O'Toole Pipe Band, all of which have won the World Pipe Band Championships.

Early life Schottky's father was mathematician Friedrich Hermann Schottky (1851‚Äì1935). Schottky had one sister and one brother. His father was appointed professor of mathematics at the University of Zurich in 1882, and Schottky was born four years later. The family then moved back to Germany in 1892, where his father took up an appointment at the University of Marburg. Schottky graduated from the Steglitz Gymnasium in Berlin in 1904. He completed his B.S. degree in physics, at the University of Berlin in 1908, and he completed his PhD in physics at the Humboldt University of Berlin in 1912, studying under Max Planck and Heinrich Rubens, with a thesis entitled: Zur relativtheoretischen Energetik und Dynamik. Career Schottky's postdoctoral period was spent at University of Jena (1912‚Äì14). He then lectured at the University of W√ºrzburg (1919‚Äì23). He became a professor of theoretical physics at the University of Rostock (1923‚Äì27). For two considerable periods of time, Schottky worked at the Siemens Research laboratories (1914‚Äì19 and 1927‚Äì58). Inventions In 1924, Schottky co-invented the ribbon microphone along with Erwin Gerlach. The idea was that a very fine ribbon suspended in a magnetic field could generate electric signals. This led to the invention of the ribbon loudspeaker by using it in the reverse order, but it was not practical until high flux permanent magnets became available in the late 1930s. Major scientific achievements Possibly, in retrospect, Schottky's most important scientific achievement was to develop (in 1914) the well-known classical formula, now written :E_{\\\\rm int}(x) = -\\\\frac{q^2} {16\\\\pi\\\\epsilon_0{x}} . This computes the interaction energy between a point charge q and a flat metal surface, when the charge is at a distance x from the surface. Owing to the method of its derivation, this interaction is called the \\"image potential energy\\" (image PE). Schottky based his work on earlier work by Lord Kelvin relating to the image PE for a sphere. Schottky's image PE has become a standard component in simple models of the barrier to motion, M(x), experienced by an electron on approaching a metal surface or a metal‚Äìsemiconductor interface from the inside. (This M(x) is the quantity that appears when the one-dimensional, one-particle, Schr√∂dinger equation is written in the form :\\\\frac{d^2}{dx^2} \\\\Psi(x) = \\\\frac{2m}{\\\\hbar^2} M(x) \\\\Psi(x) . Here, \\\\hbar is Planck's constant divided by 2œÄ, and m is the electron mass.) The image PE is usually combined with terms relating to an applied electric field F and to the height h (in the absence of any field) of the barrier. This leads to the following expression for the dependence of the barrier energy on distance x, measured from the \\"electrical surface\\" of the metal, into the vacuum or into the semiconductor: : M(x) = \\\\; h -eFx - e^2/4 \\\\pi \\\\epsilon_0 \\\\epsilon_r x \\\\;. Here, e is the elementary positive charge, Œµ0 is the electric constant and Œµr is the relative permittivity of the second medium (=1 for vacuum). In the case of a metal‚Äìsemiconductor junction, this is called a Schottky barrier; in the case of the metal-vacuum interface, this is sometimes called a Schottky‚ÄìNordheim barrier. In many contexts, h has to be taken equal to the local work function œÜ. This Schottky‚ÄìNordheim barrier (SN barrier) has played an important role in the theories of thermionic emission and of field electron emission. Applying the field causes lowering of the barrier, and thus enhances the emission current in thermionic emission. This is called the \\"Schottky effect\\", and the resulting emission regime is called \\"Schottky emission\\". In 1923 Schottky suggested (incorrectly) that the experimental phenomenon then called autoelectronic emission and now called field electron emission resulted when the barrier was pulled down to zero. In fact, the effect is due to wave-mechanical tunneling, as shown by Fowler and Nordheim in 1928. But the SN barrier has now become the standard model for the tunneling barrier. Later, in the context of semiconductor devices, it was suggested that a similar barrier should exist at the junction of a metal and a semiconductor. Such barriers are now widely known as Schottky barriers, and considerations apply to the transfer of electrons across them that are analogous to the older considerations of how electrons are emitted from a metal into vacuum. (Basically, several emission regimes exist, for different combinations of field and temperature. The different regimes are governed by different approximate formulae.) When the whole behaviour of such interfaces is examined, it is found that they can act (asymmetrically) as a special form of electronic diode, now called a Schottky diode. In this context, the metal‚Äìsemiconductor junction is known as a \\"Schottky (rectifying) contact'\\". Schottky's contributions in surface science/emission electronics and in semiconductor-device theory now form a significant and pervasive part of the background to these subjects. It could possibly be argued that ‚Äì perhaps because they are in the area of technical physics ‚Äì they are not as generally well recognized as they ought to be. Awards He was awarded the Royal Society's Hughes medal in 1936 for his discovery of the Schrot effect (spontaneous current variations in high-vacuum discharge tubes, called by him the \\"Schrot effect\\": literally, the \\"small shot effect\\") in thermionic emission and his invention of the screen-grid tetrode and a superheterodyne method of receiving wireless signals. In 1964 he received the Werner von Siemens Ring honoring his ground-breaking work on the physical understanding of many phenomena that led to many important technical appliances, among them tube amplifiers and semiconductors. Controversy The invention of superheterodyne is usually attributed to Edwin Armstrong. However, Schottky published an article in the Proceedings of the IEEE that may indicate he had invented and patented something similar in Germany in 1918. The Frenchman Lucien L√©vy had filed a claim earlier than either Armstrong or Schottky, and eventually his patent was recognized in the US and Germany. * 1939: first p‚Äìn junction Legacy Walter Schottky Institute (Germany) was named after him.

The new law, which came into effect on 1 November 1716, aimed at \\"securing the peace of the highlands in Scotland\\". It outlawed anyone in defined parts of Scotland from having \\"in his or their custody, use, or bear, broad sword, poignard, whinger, or durk, side pistol, gun, or other warlike weapon\\" unless authorised. However, the act proved ineffectual at enforcing the ban. In 1725 a new act was passed that for \\"disarming the highlands in that part of Great Britain called Scotland; and for the better securing the peace and quiet of that part of the kingdom\\". This new law was enforced by Major-General George Wade, who used it to successfully confiscate a significant number of weapons. Wade's efforts to confiscate weapons of war from was proven by the number of antiquated weapons brandished by the Highlanders who answered the call when Bonnie Prince Charlie began the Jacobite rising at Glenfinnan in 1745. Nevertheless, the Jacobite forces quickly acquired many of the latest British Army-issued government Land Pattern Muskets and bayonets after their resounding victory at Prestonpans. The main articles of the Disarming Act were further strengthened in the Act of Proscription 1746 following the defeat of Bonnie Prince Charlie at the Battle of Culloden in 1746.

His strong views on political equality and clean government drove him to outright rebellion in 1837 after a career as mayor of Toronto and in the colonial legislative assembly of Upper Canada (Ontario). He led the 1837 Upper Canada Rebellion and during its bitter end he set up a small rebel enclave named \\"Republic of Canada,\\" where he served as president December 13, 1837, to January 14, 1838. After a period of exile in the U.S., he returned to Canada and served as an elected member of the Legislative Assembly of the Province of Canada from 1851 to 1858.  Early life and immigration  =Background, early years in Scotland, and education, 1795‚Äì1820= William Lyon Mackenzie was born on March 12, 1795, in Scotland in the Dundee suburb of Springfield. Both of his grandfathers were part of Clan Mackenzie. His mother Elizabeth ( Chambers) of Kirkmichael was seventeen years older than his father, weaver Daniel Mackenzie; the couple married on May 8, 1794. Daniel died three weeks after William's birth, and his 45-year-old mother raised him alone as Daniel had left her no significant property. Mackenzie's mother was a deeply religious Calvinist and Mackenzie learned psalms and the teachings of the Presbyterian church. At five years olf Mackenzie received a bursary to enter a parish grammar school in Dundee and later transferred to a Mr Adie's school. Mackenzie was successful academically and helped students with their math work, particularly female students. He created a list of the 958 books he read between 1806 and 1820, organised by year and type of book. By 1810 he was writing for a local newspaper, becoming the youngest person in their newsroom. During this time he also joined an early Mechanics Institute where he met Edward Lesslie and his sons James and John. Mackenzie's mother arranged for him to apprentice with several tradesmen in Dundee. In 1814 he secured financial backing from Edward Lesslie to open a general store and circulating library in Alyth with his mother. During this period Mackenzie had a relationship with Isabel Reid and she gave birth to Mackenzie's illegitimate son James on July 17, 1814. The boy was raised by Mackenzie's mother. A recession followed the end of the Napoleonic Wars in 1815 and Mackenzie's general store went bankrupt. He worked in Wiltshire in 1818 for a canal company, travelled briefly to France, and worked for a short period for a newspaper in London. During this time Mackenzie was a gambler which almost caused him to lose all of his money. He decided to abstain from gambling for the rest of his life when he emigrated to British North America with John Lesslie in 1820. =Early years in Canada, 1820‚Äì1824= Mackenzie's wife, Isabel. Mackenzie worked for the Lachine Canal in Lower Canada as an accountant and wrote for the Montreal Herald. Mackenzie moved to York, Upper Canada and was employed at Lesslie's bookselling and drugstore business and Mackenzie would receive the profits for selling drugs. In 1820 Mackenzie wrote for the York Observer under the pseudonym \\"Mercator\\". In 1822, his mother and son immigrated to Upper Canada. His mother invited Isabel Baxter to travel with them and whom she had chosen for Mackenzie to marry. Although they were schoolmates, they did not know each other very well before meeting in Upper Canada. The couple were wed July 1, 1822 in Montreal. Isabel had 13 children with Mackenzie, but six died while they were children. Edward and John Lesslie opened a branch of their business in Dundas and Mackenzie moved to Dundas to enter into a partnership with the Lesslies and become the branch manager. The store sold drugs, hardware, and general merchandise while also operating as a circulating library. His relationship with the Lesslies deteriorated and the partnership was dissolved in 1823 after extensive arguments. It was also during this time that Mackenzie's first daughter, Isabel, was born. Mackenzie moved to Queenston in 1824 and bought a printing press to open his first newspaper business. He met Robert Randal and established a strong friendship with him. Upon Randal's death, Mackenzie waged a twenty-year legal battle for his estate as its executor and heir. Isabel passed away at eleven months old while they were living in Queenston, but his second daughter was born during this time. The Colonial Advocate & the \\"Types Riot\\", 1824‚Äì26 Mackenzie On May 18, 1824, Mackenzie published the first edition of the Colonial Advocate The goal of the newspaper was to influence voters in 9th Parliament of Upper Canada elections. In November 1824, Mackenzie relocated the paper and his family to York on Palace Street and near the end of the year his second daughter died of smallpox. The newspaper continued to face financial pressures due to a low number of subscribers and competition from the Canadian Freeman, another Reform-aligned paper. Mackenzie suspended publishing the Colonial Advocate from July to December 1825 and purchased a new printing press and typeface in the fall of 1825. He resumed publication in 1826, engaging in scurrilous attacks on Tory politicians William Allan, G. D'Arcy Boulton, Henry John Boulton, and George Gurnett. However, Mackenzie continued to amass debts, and in May 1826, he fled to Lewiston, New York to avoid arrest and evade his creditors. On June 8, 1826, fifteen young Tories broke into the Colonial Advocate's office to smash the printing press and throw his typeface into the bay. Mackenzie returned to York and sued eight of the perpetrators and refused a ¬£200 settlement. At a subsequent trial, Mackenzie was awarded ¬£625 in damages and used the settlement to pay off his creditors. Throughout his life, Mackenzie referred to the court case as an example of his fight for liberty in Upper Canada. Historians such as Paul Romney believe that this event was not only the start of a feud between Mackenzie and the Family Compact, but also served as a demonstration of discontent and abuse that was also identified by other Upper Canadians, thus tying Mackenzie's political fortunes with others. Reform member of the Legislative Assembly, 1827‚Äì1834 =Election to the Legislative Assembly= Front Street. Mackenzie ran for the 10th Parliament of Upper Canada in one of the two seats for York County as an independent. Mackenzie used his newspapers to help his campaign and published a series of attacks on his opponents called \\"Black List\\". Tory opponents also levied attacks on Mackenzie's character, calling him \\"William Liar Mackenzie\\". Mackenzie won a seat by a large margin. As a legislator, Mackenzie organized committees on agriculture, commerce, and the post office, the latter of which he chaired. He spoke for transferring the British-controlled post office service to local control because the office was run to obtain a profit. He was also critical of the Bank of Upper Canada because he believed it was a monopoly and a limited liability company. He also opposed further infrastructure projects until the debt incurred by the province had been paid off. Later in the session, he also spoke out against the Welland Canal Company, denouncing its close links with the Executive Council and the financing methods of William Hamilton Merritt. In March 1829, Mackenzie travelled to the U.S. to study the new president Andrew Jackson. He admired the small size of the American government and liked the spoils system as a method to remove Family Compact members from government offices. Following Mackenzie's 1829 trip to the U.S., his political attitudes became increasingly pro-American and anti-British. In 1830 Mackenzie ran for reelection for a York County seat the 11th Parliament. Mackenzie was successful, but the Reform group won 20 out of 51 seats, diminishing the power Mackenzie had in upcoming sessions. Disappointed with the setbacks of the reform movement and frustrated with the political structure of Upper Canada, he began trying to reform other institutions. He refused to join an agricultural society organized by the Tories but attended their meetings and insisted on speaking. He also joined St. Andrew's Presbyterian, a congregation organized by Tories who supported the church-state connection. At St. Andrew's he advocated for the separation of the church from state affairs causing a four-year battle resulting in the departure of Mackenzie and Reverend William Rintoul. = Expulsions and re- elections = The 11th Parliament of Upper Canada met in January 1831 and Mackenzie continued to denounce abuses in the province. Influenced by the Reform movement in England, he called for reviewing how the population was represented in the legislature and chaired a special committee which recommended increased representation for Upper Canadian towns, voting on a single day and voting by ballot instead of voice. This committee caused Mackenzie's riding of York to be split into four ridings that elected a single member each. In 1830 The British government was proposing legislation that would transfer the cost of some programs to colonial legislatures. Although Mackenzie's reform movement had previously been in favour of this proposal, Mackenzie called the legislation the \\"Everlasting Salary Bill\\". Mackenzie spent 1831 travelling throughout Upper Canada collecting signatures for petitions to redress Upper Canadian grievances and meeting with Lower Canada Reformers. In the November 1831 legislative session, Mackenzie demanded investigations of the Bank of Upper Canada, the Welland Canal, King's College, the revenues, and the chaplain's salary. At the same time, he was still writing in the Colonial Advocate and denounced the Legislative Assembly as a \\"sycophantic office\\". The assembly responded by expelling Mackenzie, causing a by-election for his seat. Mackenzie ran for reelection and won his seat on January 2, 1832. The elections took place at the Red Lion Hotel and when his victory was announced, a parade of 134 sleighs, accompanied with bagpipes, paraded down Yonge Street in celebration. On January 7, 1832, Mackenzie was expelled again from the Assembly because of new attacks Mackenzie had published in the Colonial Advocate. A second by-election was called, and Mackenzie won by a landslide for a second time. When he was expelled from the Assembly for the third time, Mackenzie appealed to London for redress. Outside the legislature, Mackenzie was trying to garner support for his movement while disrupting the organisation of the Tories. When the Roman Catholic bishop Alexander Macdonell organized a rally in York to demonstrate Catholic support for the Tories, Mackenzie and his supporters disrupted the meeting. In Hamilton, William Johnson Kerr arranged to have Mackenzie beaten by thugs. On March 23, Catholic Irish apprentices in York, furious at Mackenzie's attack on Bishop Macdonnell, pelted him with garbage. Riots broke out in York that same day and Mackenzie was saved because of the intervention of Tory magistrate James FitzGibbon. Following the riots, Mackenzie went into hiding on Joseph Sheperd's property.https://www.toronto.ca/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/90b6-edc- hostpot-loops-guide-north-york-web.pdf \\"The rebel leader, William Lyon Mackenzie hid on this property before escaping to the United States to avoid imprisonment.\\" =Appeal to the Colonial Office= In April 1832, Mackenzie travelled to England to petition the British government for redress after receiving the funds to do so from public meetings. In London, he met with reformers Joseph Hume and John Arthur Roebuck and wrote in the Morning Chronicle to influence British public opinion in his favour. He was also present in the galleries for the debate on the Reform Act 1832 and wrote Sketches of Canada and the United States, designed to acquaint the British public with his grievances. He visited F. J. Robinson, 1st Viscount Goderich, the Whig party's colonial secretary, on July 2, 1832, to give his concerns about the functioning of Upper Canada. He was invited by Robinson to send reports about Upper Canada and Mackenzie sent several dispatches. On November 8, 1832, Robinson sent a dispatch to Lieutenant Governor John Colborne instructing him to make financial and political improvements in Upper Canada, and instructing him to lessen the Assembly's negative attitude against Mackenzie, which upset the Legislative Council. The Legislative Assembly prevented Mackenzie from voting on legislation and refused to call fresh elections. When news of this insubordination reached Lord Goderich, he dismissed Attorney General Boulton and Solicitor General Hagerman. Mackenzie celebrated by touring England, Scotland, and France with his wife. In April 1833, Lord Goderich was replaced as Secretary of State for War and the Colonies by Lord Stanley. Lord Stanley reappointed Hagerman as solicitor general and named Boulton chief justice of Newfoundland. This incident contributed to Mackenzie's decaying faith in appealing to Great Britain. Returning to Upper Canada, in December 1833 he renamed the Colonial Advocate to simply The Advocate, a sign that he no longer valued its connection to Great Britain. On December 17, 1833, he was again expelled from the Legislative Assembly and later re-elected. Lieutenant Governor Colborne intervened to ensure Mackenzie was able to take his seat and vote in proceedings. In 1832, Reverend George Ryerson began attacking British Reformer Joseph Hume in the pages of the Methodist newspaper, The Christian Guardian. Mackenzie disagreed with these attacks and wrote articles in his paper denouncing Ryerson. This caused Mackenzie and his paper to develop a negative relationship with the Methodist people in Upper Canada. Mayor of Toronto, 1834 Second market in York (Toronto) The township of York incorporated as the city of Toronto and held their first elections for city council on Marck 27, 1834. Mackenzie was elected as an alderman and at a subsequent meeting the city council elected him as the first mayor of Toronto. Mackenzie spent large portions of his time as mayor focused on preparing for the next provincial election. He dismissed Tory officials and replaced them with his supporters, but did not manage to deal with the city's excessive debt, institute much needed public works or effectively manage a cholera outbreak. Mackenzie's management style provoked frequent quarrels on the City Council making it difficult to pass new by-laws. In the 1835 municipal elections, Reform candidates were continually defeated by Tory opponents and Mackenzie received the fewest votes in his ward in his reelection for alderman.

The panel shows William Lyon Mackenzie presenting his historic Seventh Report of Grievances to the House of Assembly of Upper Canada. Names of those executed during the repression that followed defeat of the rebellion appear on one of the panels, as do profiles of the two rebels who met their death on the scaffold in Toronto: Samuel Lount and Peter Matthews. In May 1834, Mackenzie published a letter from British Reformer Joseph Hume in the Advocate calling for independence for the colonies, even by means of violent rebellion if necessary. In elections held in October 1834, the Reformers won a majority in the 12th Parliament of Upper Canada and Mackenzie was re-elected as member for York. He decided to stop issuing the Advocate in November 1834 because he wanted to devote his time to the legislature and he felt the reform movement should be continued by other. He gave the Advocate to William John O'Grady who merged it with is own paper. On December 8, 1834, Mackenzie submitted various proposals to the Canadian Alliance Society. They were accepted by the reformers and formed the basis for the alliance's reform proposals. Mackenzie was also chosen to be the alliance's corresponding secretary. Upon meeting in January 1835, the 12th Parliament of Upper Canada voted to reverse all of Mackenzie's previous expulsions from the Legislative Assembly. Mackenzie chaired a special committee of the Legislative Assembly to detail the grievances of Upper Canada, which resulted in the production of the Seventh Report on Grievances,\\"The seventh report from the Select Committee of the House of Assembly of Upper Canada on grievances...\\" documenting grievances and proposed solutions. The Assembly also appointed Mackenzie as a government director of the Welland Canal Company and Mackenzie produced an exhaustive report on the company's negative financial situation and condemned the company for poor management. In the July 1836 election for the 13th Parliament of Upper Canada, Mackenzie lost his election to Edward William Thomson. His petition to the legislature to investigate alleged problems in his election was rejected due to a technicality. Upper Canadian Rebellion, 1837‚Äì1838 =Planning= After his electoral defeat, Mackenzie founded a new newspaper called the Constitution and purposely had its first issue printed on July 4, 1836. Mackenzie began advocating constitutional change for Upper Canada and possibly using force to achieve those ends. In July 1837 Mackenzie organised a \\"constitutional convention\\" and delegates would be selected by Reform associations from around the province. This constitutional convention, modelled on the Continental Congress, was to be organized by the new Toronto Political Union. Mackenzie's revolutionary aims were expressed when he reprinted Thomas Paine's Common Sense, in the Constitution. Mackenzie spent summer 1837 organizing political unions and vigilance committees throughout Upper Canada. He held large Reform meetings in the Home District, the most notable being his speech to disgruntled area farmers in Newmarket on August 3, 1837, when the idea of a violent rebellion was first openly discussed. He also helped write many resolutions that called for delegates from Upper and Lower Canada to meet and discuss solutions to the negative state of their colonies. In fall 1837, Mackenzie attracted large crowds, but also began facing physical attacks from members of the Orange Order. It was during this period that Mackenzie believed overthrowing the government would be necessary. In mid- October 1837, Mackenzie organized a meeting of ten radical Reformers and proposed gathering employees of reformer industrialists in Toronto to seize control of the Upper Canadian government. The meeting rejected Mackenzie's proposal and Mackenzie proposed organising a resistance to the government among farmers. Mackenzie approached John Rolph and Thomas David Morrison with false information that people outside Toronto were prepared to march on the city to organize a revolt. He also produced a letter from Thomas Storrow Brown which falsely claimed that the Reformers in Lower Canada wanted Upper Canada reformers to provide a distraction and draw troops away from Lower Canada. Rolph and Morrison rejected his plan and asked Mackenzie to canvass opinion north of the city. Instead, Mackenzie called a meeting of Reform leaders outside the city and convinced them that they would be able to take control of the government. He returned to Toronto and informed Rolph and Morrison that the revolt would begin on December 7. Rolph and Morrison were angry that Mackenzie had deceived them, but ultimately decided to participate in Mackenzie's plan. Mackenzie asked Colonel Anthony Van Egmond to be the military leader of the rebellion. In the November 15, 1837 issue of The Constitution, Mackenzie published a draft constitution modelled on the constitution propounded by the Equal Rights Party (or Locofocos of New York state), but also incorporating English radical Reform ideas and some aspects of utilitarianism. If things had gone according to Mackenzie's plan, a provincial constitutional convention, with a provisional government headed by John Rolph administering the colony in the meantime would have sat on December 21. On November 24, Mackenzie travelled north of Toronto to rally supporters. At a meeting on December 2 in Stoufferville, Mackenzie set forth his plan for rebellion in greater detail: British troops occupied in Lower Canada would be unable to do anything as Reformers from the country marched on Toronto; once there they would join up Reformers and politicians who had resigned from the government. Once the Lieutenant Governor Francis Bond Head was seized of land would be distributed to each participant of the uprising from reserve lands and any Tories who did not participate would have their land taken from them. The rebels were instructed to assemble at John Montgomery's tavern on Yonge Street on December 7 to march into Toronto together. On December 1, Mackenzie wrote a declaration of independence which was to be distributed to rebels immediately before the march on Toronto. On Sunday, December 3, Mackenzie returned to Toronto, where he learned that John Rolph, having heard a false rumour that the government was preparing to mount a defence, had sent a message to Samuel Lount, instructing him to raise several hundred men and enter Toronto the next day. Mackenzie attempted to stop this action, but he could not reach Lount in time, and thus the Upper Canada Rebellion began ahead of Mackenzie's planned schedule, on December 4. =The Battle of Montgomery's Tavern= Lount's troops arrived at Montgomery's Tavern on the night of Monday, December 4. Mackenzie led a scouting expedition to determine Toronto's preparedness. Print showing fighting during the Battle of Montgomery's Tavern, December 7, 1837. On December 5, Mackenzie grew increasingly erratic and spent the day attempting to punish the property or families of leading Tories. His secondary commanders, Lount and David Gibson, began to question Mackenzie's fitness to lead. Rolph encouraged Mackenzie to enter Toronto during the mid- afternoon but Mackenzie waited until the evening to begin the rebellion's march towards Toronto. The men walked down as far as McGill Street, but then turned around when troops led by Sheriff William Botsford Jarvis fired at them on the property of a man named Jonathan Scott. Two of the rebels were injured and the next morning the body of the deceased man was discovered on Jonathan Scott's property. On Wednesday, December 6 Mackenzie's seized a mail coach running west of Toronto. Mackenzie read out loud a letter he allegedly received from a gentleman named \\"Mr. Cotton\\" from Buffalo. In the letter stated that 200 men were going to arrive to help with their rebellion. Mackenzie also sent a letter to a newspaper called Buffalo Whig and Journal asking for more troops and reinforcements from the United States. On Thursday, December 7, Col. Van Egmond told Mackenzie that their position was impossible to defend, but Mackenzie put a pistol to Van Egmond's head and forced him to stay. In the ensuing Battle of Montgomery's Tavern, Mackenzie's troops quickly surrendered after MacNabb opened artillery fire. =Attempted invasion from the United States= A proclamation posted on December 7, 1837 offering a reward of one thousand pounds for the capture of William Lyon Mackenzie. 1841 sketch by MacKenzie showing the body of Durfee lying on the ground [foreground] while the Burning wreck of the \\"Caroline\\" drifts toward the falls (Background) The rebel leaders escaped to the United States and Mackenzie arrived in Buffalo, New York on December 11, 1837. On that day he gave a speech outlining his desire for Upper Canada to be independent of Britain. He blamed the failed rebellion in Upper Canada on a lack of weapons and supplies for the men assembled in Montgomery's Tavern. Josiah Trowbridge wrote a letter to Martin Van Buren interpreting the speech as a rallying cry for assistance in the rebellion, and a newspaper called Commercial Advertiser reported a similar interpretation in their article on the event. Mackenzie visited Rensselaer Van Rensselaer on December 12 with Rolph and Thomas Jefferson Sutherland to convince him to lead troops to invade Upper Canada from Navy Island. While gathering supplies for the invasion, Mackenzie entered into a dispute with the sheriff of Black Rock, New York and the sheriff was able to recover arms stolen earlier that day by rebel supporters. He possibly visited Marshall Spring Bidwell on December 13 to convince him to join their cause, but was unsuccessful. Mackenzie, Van Rensselaer and 24 supporters occupied Navy Island on December 14 and created the State of Upper Canada. Mackenzie was disappointed that so few men accompanied them on their initial trip to the island. He prepared a proclamation for the creation of the State of Upper Canada and appointed himself its chairman and created an executive committee of 13 men. He also outlined principles he wanted in its constitution and ratified at a convention. Mackenzie snuck into Canada to distribute his constitutional ideas and try to encourage Canadians to join him. He wrote a second proclamation, on December 19 promising $100 in silver to volunteers, and a third proclamation on December 21. Although Mackenzie was against occupying Navy Island because he wanted to invade Canada, he was in favour of their occupation disrupting trade to Upper Canada, increasing the hostilities between Canada and the United States and changing opinions in Britain over the value of keeping colonies. While on the island Mackenzie conducted correspondence for the patriot forces. On January 4 Mackenzie then travelled to Buffalo to seek medical attention for his wife. While travelling there he was arrested for violating the Neutrality Act of 1794 and reportedly went on an angry tirade against Americans and their political leaders. He was released on $5000 bail, paid by three men in Buffalo, and returned to Navy Island in January. Mackenzie urged the executive council on Navy Island to send the troops to Buffalo, obtain boats, and invade Canada. He believed that the men gathered in Montgomery's Tavern a month earlier would join them if a large arrived. He also believed more supporters would have arrived at the tavern if they were not defeated, and these people were pretending to be loyalists until they saw an opportunity for a successful rebellion. The council disagreed with Mackenzie, and British forces invaded the island on January 14, 1838, and the rebellion forces dispersed to the American mainland. There was disagreement over who should lead an invasion of Upper Canada and how it would proceed. Mackenzie wanted the invasion to be led by Canadians with American assistance. In Buffalo, Mackenzie told Van Rensselaer that he should go to the troops that dispersed to Detroit and lead them to Canada at a better opportunity. He also contacted Reformers in Lennox County and Addington County, Upper Canada to coordinate a resistance with the Patriots who were invading Lower Canada. On January 21 he arrived in Rochester and unsuccessfully attempted to raise money for his invasion. He conflicts with Van Rensselaer continued into February when Mackenzie wanted to avoid an American invasion, and instead wanted a limited number of troops to join Canadian rebels once they invaded Upper Canada. When Van Rensselaer attempted an invasion of Kingston from Hickory Island, Mackenzie refused to participate or send any supplies to help with the endeavour, citing later his lack of confidence in the mission's success. The constant arguments between Van Rensselaer and Mackenzie and the failed invasion from Hickory Island caused public opinion to decrease for Mackenzie. Mackenzie's public denunciation of the Hickory Island plan shortly after it began caused many in Canada to doubt the effectiveness of the rebellion or Mackenzie's leadership. The Ogdensburgh Republican called Mackenzie, \\"selfish, heartless, unprincipled, and cowardly.\\" Mackenzie travelled west with Calvin Willcox to avoid getting arrested against by the Americans. After the forces from Navy Island were defeated in mainland America, Mackenzie and Willcox decided that any further recruitment attempts for Patriot forces would cause them to be ridiculed. On March 4 he returned to Albany where his friends tried to convince him that their rebellion could not continue. Years in the US, 1838‚Äì1849 =Support for Patriots and Mackenzie's Gazette= Mackenzie and his wife arrived in New York on March 10 and stayed with his friend James Smith. Mackenzie might have travelled to Washington DC to garner support for a war between the United States and Great Britain, but if this did happen it was unsuccessful. After briefly visiting Philadelphia he returned to New York City to launch Mackenzie's Gazette with money loaned to him from supporters including Henry O'Reilly. Its early editions supported the Patriots and focused on topics relating to Canada and events along the Canada-US border. The newspaper was initially successful because the Rebellions of 1837 had created American interest in Canadian affairs and Americans wanted to learn more about Mackenzie's journalism. In September 1838 Mackenzie began his application to become an American citizen. In August 1838, Mackenzie published articles commenting on American politics and supported the Democratic party in the upcoming 1838 United States elections. This caused supporters of the Whig Party to cancel their subscriptions to his paper and for Canadian Patriots to become disinterested in the paper's new focus. In November 1838 Mackenzie was printing inaccurate articles about the progress of the rebellion by Patriot forces. After the Battle of the Windmill he admitted in his paper that Patriot forces had been defeated and noted the failures of rebel forces in Upper and Lower Canada. He organised meetings in New York, Philadelphia, Washington DC, Baltimore and Albany to raise funds for the Patriots. President Van Buren issued a proclamation against the Patriot forces telling Americans to not give support for their cause and declaring that Americans who joined the Patriots would not receive American protection. Mackenzie was furious that he issued this proclamation because Van Buren knew about the preparation of the Patriot invasion but waited until its failure and the American midterm elections to state his opposition. From December 27, 1838, to January 10, 1839, Mackenzie visited and investigated the Battle of the Windmill to determine how the Patriot forces failed. He visited Hunters' Lodges who had provided the majority of people in this battle and reported that the invasion failed because of a lack of support and arms. However, he overemphasised the successes of the Patriot forces and failed to report on the preparation of Loyalist forces for the invasion. Mackenzie disagreed with the land speculators who organised the American Hunters to invade Upper Canada. The Canadian Association was created and led by Mackenzie and he moved to Rochester to manage the entity. His motivation to move out of New York City might have also been influenced by the Gazette's lack of success. The family's move to Rochester was delayed when Isabel Mackenzie gave birth to Mackenzie's son. Mackenzie focused the Canadian Association away from frontier raids and instead sought to keep Patriot forces organised and motivated to help if a war or rebellion was to happen in Canada. This association struggled to attract enough Canadian Patriots to sustain its operations. He soon believed that American would never invade Canada and believed the association should publish an account of the Upper Canada Rebellion. However, the association was unable to raise enough funds and the money it did receive was spent on Mackenzie's trial. =Neutrality law trial and sentence= The trial for Mackenzie's violation of American neutrality laws began on June 19, 1839, and he represented himself in the proceedings. The District Attorney argued that Mackenzie recruited members at his speech in the Eagle Theatre and brought the crowd to the city hall of Black Rock where they stole arms, established an army, and refused to allow a sheriff to recover the arms. The DA also argued that Mackenzie broke the Neutrality Act when he wrote and distributed the Navy Island Proclamation. Upon cross-examination Mackenzie had the prosecution's witnesses admit that they did not know if Mackenzie was part of the crowd that was formed after Eagle Theatre and did not know where the crowd went when they left the meeting. Mackenzie also stated that a committee in Buffalo was going to pay for the arms that were stolen and that the Navy Island Proclamation was to only be distributed in Canada. Mackenzie also contended that the United States and Britain were not at peace because of the Caroline affair and thus the Neutrality Act did not apply. In his defence arguments, Mackenzie gave the history of the Upper Canada Rebellion and compared it to the American Revolution. Mackenzie challenged Britain's right to rule Canada due to obtaining the colony through invasion and conquest. He also argued that the people of Canada did not have to be loyal to Britain because of the mismanagement of Upper Canada by its ruling class. Mackenzie tried to submit the Durham Report as evidence that Canada was in a state of anarchy, but this was ruled inadmissible by the judge because Canada was a colony its internal affairs could not be given as evidence. Mackenzie also tried to prove that Canada was in a civil war when Mackenzie committed his alleged crimes. The judge also ruled this evidence as inadmissible because the American Congress did not consider if Canada was rebelling against Britain and only Congress could make that determination. When defending against charges related to the Navy Island campaign, Mackenzie argued that citizens of Buffalo had conceived the idea and that he did not have the resources to organise this expedition. The prosecution countered these arguments by producing a letter written by the Buffalo committee requesting Mackenzie give guidance on how they could help his cause. The judge denied testimony on Mackenzie's reply to this letter and of a letter supposedly sent by Thomas Sutherland showing the readiness for conflict by the Buffalo committee. This frustrated Mackenzie and he did not call further witnesses for his defence. Mackenzie was sentenced to pay a $10 fine and spend 18 months in jail. He decided not to appeal after consulting with lawyers whom he did not publicly name. He stated after the trial that he was depending upon key witnesses giving testimony but these people did not come to the courtroom. He also denounced the application of the Neutrality Law, wrongly stating that the law had not been considered or applied for nearly fifty years. Mackenzie chose to be imprisoned in Rochester in order to be closer to his family. He wanted to be treated as a political prisoner and only ate meals that his family brought to the prison. During his sentence, he read Workingman's Advocate and created a code of law for his ideal structure of government. He also published The Caroline Almanack and issues of Gazette Mackenzie gained support among Americans who sympathised with him and gave him gifts and subscriptions to his newspaper. The first editions of Gazette while Mackenzie was in jail consisted of a retelling of Mackenzie's trial and appeals for his release. Mackenzie then moved on to reporting on Canadian and American politics. While imprisoned Mackenzie's health deteriorated and a bullet was fired through his prison window, frightening Mackenzie. He increased his efforts to receive a pardon by encouraging his friends to write to prominent American politicians and petitioning Van Buren directly. Van Buren was initially reluctant to pardon Mackenzie because he did not want others to believe he supported Mackenzie's actions. He also did not want to offend the British in case hostilities between the two countries continued. He acquiesced in May 1840 after numerous petitions were submitted to Congress and a resolution calling for Mackenzie's release was submitted to the Senate. =After pardon= The last issue of the Gazette was published in December 1840 after experiencing financial difficulty. His twelfth child was born in February 1841 and he applied to become a lawyer in Monroe County, but was rejected because he had not previously worked as a counsellor. In April he launched The Rochester Volunteer and printed negative articles on Canadian Tory legislators and how ridings in Montreal and Quebec were configured to disadvantage French Canadian voters. He also tried to start a war between the United States and Britain over the trial Alexander McLeod in the hopes that a war between the two nations would create an independent Upper Canada. The Volunteer failed in September 1841, and Mackenzie moved back to New York City in June 1842. Mackenzie worked for various publishers but refused to accept a job as an editor. In August 1842 he was elected as an actuary and librarian at the Mechanics' Institute, but resigned because he was not receiving his expected salary. Mackenzie became an American citizen in April 1843 and in the fall of 1843 he launched the Examiner, which failed after five issues. He wrote a biography of 500 Irish patriots entitled, The Sons of the Emerald Isle and the first volume was published on February 21, 1844. He also co-founded the National Reform Association with the goal of giving public lands to people who will live on the property, limiting the quantity of land a single person can own and outlawing the confiscation of homesteads that were given to settlers for free. He remained on the association's central committee until July 1844 and was a speaker at many of their meetings. In July 1844 he was nominated to be an inspector at the New York Custom House, but this was withdrawn after it was criticised in Whig newspapers because Mackenzie was not born in the United States. He was instead appointed as a clerk in the archives office of the customs house. Mackenzie copied private letters of Jesse Hoyt which described various negotiations between members of the Albany Regency for financial transactions and appointments to government offices. He resigned from his position at the custom-house in June 1845 and published some of the letters as Lives and Opinions of Benjamin Franklin Butler and Jesse Hoyt. It sold 50 000 copies and made a $12 000 profit before an injunction stopped the sale of the book. Mackenzie did not receive any of the profits. In April 1846, Mackenzie published another book based on Hoyt's letters called Life and Times of Martin Van Buren: The Correspondence of His Friends, Family, and Pupils. This book focused on Van Buren and contained Mackenzie's commentary on American politics with supporting evidence from the letters. In October 1845 Mackenzie also published the second volume of The Sons of the Emerald Isle. In May 1846, Horace Greeley hired Mackenzie to report on the New York State Constitutional Convention for the New York Tribune. After the convention Mackenzie stayed in Albany in the hopes continuing to report for the Tribune or to receive a patronage appointment. He edited an issue of the Albany Patriot and wrote various articles for the Tribune. In May 1847 he returned to New York City to work for the Tribune. In August 1847 he was hired by Henry O'Reilly to organise and index James Monroe's correspondence for his memoir. In April 1848 Mackenzie resigned from the Tribune and two months later his daughter Margaret became sick and died. O'Reilly paid Mackenzie to write editorials promoting his new telegraph companies and defending him against accusations from Morse telegraph patentees. Amnesty and return to Canada, 1849‚Äì1861 On January 30, 1849, the Canadian Legislature passed an amnesty bill for crimes committed during the 1837 rebellion. Mackenzie travelled to Montreal in February, and his arrival in Canada caused riots in Belleville and Toronto and his effigy being burned in Kingston. In March 1849 Mackenzie reached Toronto and stayed with John McIntosh. A mob gathered at McIntosh's house and burned an effigy of Mackenzie on the front lawn. Mackenzie continued touring Upper Canada and returned to New York on April 4. Mackenzie insisted that he had no desire to return permanently and documented his tour in a series of articles called A Winter's Journey through the Canadas. Greely hired Mackenzie to assemble various Whig almanacs and the Business Men's Almanack, which were both published in 1850. Mackenzie was also writing weekly letters to the Toronto Examiner. He became a correspondent for the New York Daily Tribune in Washington, D.C in April 1850. He decided to return to Toronto in May 1850 with his family. He wrote weekly articles for the Tribune and contributed to the Niagara Mail and the Toronto Examiner although he refused offers to work full-time. He sought to collect money he believed was owed for his public service in the 1830s and received $1200 from York County and ¬£250 his work as a Welland Canal commissioner in 1835. =Return to the Legislature, 1851‚Äì1858= Mackenzie in the 1850s. In 1850 John Doel sold to Mackenzie a town lot in Dundas that had once belonged to Mackenzie but was seized by Canadian government and sold to Doel to pay off Mackenzie's debts. By owning property, Mackenzie was able to run for a seat in the Legislative Assembly. After David Thomson's death in February 1851, Mackenzie decided to run for his vacated seat for Haldimand County as an Independent politician. In April 1851 Mackenzie won the by-election against three other opponents. Mackenzie won because many people in the county were against the government's Reform candidates and believed Mackenzie would be an independent voice. An opponent named George Brown had also criticised the pope which caused the county's large number of Roman Catholics to vote against Brown. In 1851, Mackenzie investigated government affairs and alleged corruption and one of his investigations caused Robert Baldwin to resign as co-premier. He campaigned against various Reform candidates whom he believed were not supporting reform policies. He campaigned against Baldwin in the October 1851 elections for the 4th Parliament of the Province of Canada, visiting Baldwin's riding to support his rival. He wrote in the Examiner that Francis Hincks was willing to abandon Reform principles to be elected, but when Hincks was chosen as the Reform candidate Mackenzie wrote a handbill giving his endorsement. He campaigned against James Hervey Price and accused him of betraying his constituents. Mackenzie won his own election in Haldimand County with 63% of the vote. In 1852 Hincks asked Mackenzie to participate in negotiations with George Brown's Clear Grits, as Hincks hoped Brown would rejoin the Reform Party. Mackenzie refused to attend to maintain his independence in the Legislature. John Rolph was appointed to a ministry position and consulted Mackenzie on appointments in Haldimand county. He offered Mackenzie a job as an agent for the Commissioner of Crown Lands, but Mackenzie refused because he did not want to burden the Canadian taxpayers with an unnecessary job created for him. On October 5, 1852, Mackenzie wrote a letter to the Examiner that Lesslie wanted to edit before printing. Mackenzie refused to allow any edits and Lesslie refused to publish all of Mackenzie's letters. Losing his only source of communication with his constituents, Mackenzie began his own newspaper on December 25, 1852, called Mackenzie's Weekly Message (and later renamed Toronto Weekly Message). Anticipating a surprise election in 1854, Mackenzie analysed the voting records of Hincks and Clear Grit legislators and attempted to raise money to print 20 000 of an updated Voter's Guide. In May 1853, Mackenzie opposed a scheme dubbed the \\"¬£10,000 Job\\" where Hincks and John George Bowes had profited by lending money to railway companies at public expense. He accused Rolph and his Lower Canadian ally Malcolm Cameron of opposing reform ideals in order to become electable and accused Rolph of treason during the 1837 rebellion after Rolph refused to consult him on appointments in Haldimand county. Mackenzie also disagreed with George Brown, stating that Brown's reform beliefs were hypocritical and commenting on Brown's anti-Catholic prejudices. Mackenzie faced a difficult reelection campaign in 1854 for his Legislative Assembly seat in Haldimand. Local newspapers complained that Mackenzie only came to the riding during election time and that other legislators would not vote for any amendments or legislation he proposed due to their negative opinion of Mackenzie. His positions against religious school boards and his articles in the Message caused some voters to withdraw their support. Although Mackenzie wanted to campaign against Hincks and his supporters in other ridings, his opponent in Haldimand demanded a poll and Mackenzie was forced to spend more time campaigning in his riding. He won the election by 54 votes, a smaller majority than in the previous election. In the 5th Parliament of the Province of Canada Mackenzie opposed the MacNab-Morin coalition government and denounced Reform members who supported the administration. Mackenzie gave a speech in the legislature that criticised Governor-General James Elgin for not giving reform legislators a chance to form a government before accepting a Tory government, calling his actions unconstitutional. During this session of Parliament Mackenzie was appointed chairman of the Committee of Public Accounts during this session of Parliament. The committee's reports criticised the disorganisation of the province's record-keeping of various budgets and expenditures. The committee also exposed various expenditures by the government that had not been approved by Parliament, including an expenditure at a loading pier on the St. Lawrence River near Quebec City where ¬£119 611 was spent when only ¬£41 500 had been approved. This caused the administration to avoid spending money that had not been approved by the legislature first. Mackenzie pursued a resolution that condemned previous administrations for similar acts but this was rejected by the committee. In retaliation for this proposal, Mackenzie was removed from the committee. Clear Grit founders sought his advice in 1854 to create policy and wanted him to join their reform movement. They wanted him to support Brown as their leader but Mackenzie continued his attacks on Brown. By 1957 only David Christie wanted to include Mackenzie in Reform proposals. In 1855 Mackenzie's health began to deteriorate. In February he was forced to close the Message, citing the time consumed by his work as a legislator. He refused to merge his newspaper with the Examiner and the Globe but wrote columns for the Examiner on an irregular schedule after the closure of the Message. He revived the Message in December 1855 and published the Repealers' Almanac in 1856, outlining his arguments to split the union of Upper and Lower Canada. It contained the same arguments that had been made in other publications and it was not financially successful. Lesslie and Archibald Alexander Riddell organized a fund for Mackenzie for his years of service to Canada, ultimately raising $7,500. Mackenzie used the fund to buy a house and to secure a loan for his newspaper. Mackenzie worked with constituents to pressure the legislator to investigate land speculators illegally obtaining large plots of land. Subsequent reports stated that speculators acquired 63 000 acres under questionable circumstances and the Crown Lands Department, from whom they obtained the land from, was disorganised and filled with incompetent employees. He tried to get the government to prosecute Crown land agents and help citizens who defaulted on mortgages but this was delayed by Mackenzie's resignation as a legislator and a lack of willingness for government officials to proceed on this issue. He opposed a Conservative-sponsored bill to regulate the sale of land because it left many issues to the discretion of members of the executive branch and a minimum price for plots of land were not established. Mackenzie was reelected to the in the riding of Haldimand in the 1857 legislative election and accepted Brown's invitation to caucus with opposition members against the Macdonald-Cartier administration. After the defeat of the Macdonald-Cartier government, Mackenzie supported the Brown-Dorion administration although he criticised the differing viewpoints between ministers on various issues and was disappointed that he was not given a portfolio. Mackenzie resigned his seat on August 16, 1858 stating that he believed the legislature was illegitimate after the Mackenzie-Cartier administration was reinstated by the Governor-General without an election. He had been suffering from rheumatism and was attending Parliament less frequently. He refused calls to run for Legislative Council of the Province of Canada or mayor of Toronto. =Final years, 1858‚Äì1861= Walter Seymour Allward's bust of William Lyon Mackenzie outside the Legislative Assembly of Ontario in Toronto. At the end of 1858 Mackenzie decided to stop production of the Message, citing running the paper at a financial loss and how a lack of popularity would make it difficult to influence politics. He continued trying to dismantle the union of Upper and Lower Canada by collecting petitions and planning to deliver them to the Colonial Office in England. The Homestead Fund refused to give him money for his trip so he travelled to New York attempting to raise money for the trip. He was unsuccessful, returned to Toronto and restarted the Message in June. In 1859 Mackenzie attended a Reform convention organised by Brown as an observer. He disagreed with the outcome of the convention that Reform politicians should advocate for representation by population in the legislator. He wrote Almanac for Independence and Freedom for 1860 outlining his arguments to dissolve the union. In October he moved to a new home in Toronto purchased by the Homestead Fund set up by Lesslie and Riddell. and due to decreasing subscriptions to the Message he ended publication on September 15, 1860. John Doel sued Mackenzie over acres of land he sold to Mackenzie in exchange for a note and Doel wanted Macknezie to begin paying a mortgage. The lawsuit ended when Mackenzie agreed to sign a mortgage. He was also compiling an autobiography. Near the end of his life, as he was getting sicker Mackenzie refused any medication. Mackenzie died on August 28, 1861, following an apoplectic seizure. He was buried at Toronto Necropolis. Writing style The topics of Mackenzie's editorials were not consistent or usually linked together between issues and preferred writing about topics he was thinking about at a particular time. This caused Mackenzie to write about grievances from previous decades that did not affect the current readership and for the prose to ramble. He often used scripture to support his argument, and his knowledge of scripture came from his Calvinist upbringing by his mother. In Colonial Advocate Mackenzie wrote about the public and private lives of his opponents and their families. Charles Lindsey stated in his biography of his father-in-law that these articles were written in retaliation to J. B. Macaulay printing their private correspondence. Lindsey believed Mackenzie was provoked into printing these attacks. Lindsay also stated that Mackenzie's articles were, \\"mild and playful beside the savagery of the unprovoked attack\\" and when Mackenzie responded to further provocations from Mackenzie, Lindey believed Mackenzie responded with sharp sarcasm. Mackenzie also printed the members of the Family Compact and recorded their positions in government, their income and how they were related to each other. Historian William Kilbourn stated that his writing was better appreciated when read out loud, and described Mackenzie's structure as a \\"three-volume Victorian novel\\" because of its slow pace. Mackenzie wrote about provincial issues but also included local news stories within his paper. In describing Lives and Opinions of Benjamin Franklin Butler and Jesse Hoyt in 1845, the New York Tribune said it as surprising report on the political actions of New York State politicians. Lillian F. Gates wrote in 1996 that the formatting is disorganised with obscure references of that time period that would be difficult for readers to understand today. Gates described Mackenzie's writing in The Life and Times of Martin Van Buren as difficult to understand because he did not describe events chronologically and listed hundreds of names and events with too many footnotes. He also relied upon illustrations and political events from that time period which were difficult to discern. When reporting on the 1846 New York State Constitutional Convention, Mackenzie preferred shorter articles that rarely exceeded two columns of text. He referred readers to other newspapers to get details of the convention and instead devoted his columns to editorialising the proceedings. Lillian F. Gates stated that taken as a whole, his articles were neutral in their biases. He emphasised his criticisms of Van Buren but praised delegates who supported his proposals and criticised those who he disagreed with regardless of their political affiliation. His reports focused on the issues that Mackenzie had advocated for previously, and reports on the debates taking place in the convention were brief but without editorialization. In his later editions of the Message in 1859, Mackenzie's articles focused on his theories on economic policies or denouncing the government. He rebuked a subscriber's request for news about the events at the Legislature because he felt there were more important topics to discuss. Gates describes these writings as, \\"much ranting criticism of the government\\" but also stated that some writings had substantive arguments. Political philosophy and views =Political philosophy= Mackenzie embraced the version of rationalist liberalism that existed at the time. He advocated for the Reform cause and was an outspoken critic of the Family Compact and their supposed corruption. The officials he identified as corrupt or opposed to reform changed between issues. Although the Lieutenant Governor was initially exempt from scrutiny, Mackenzie included him in later publications and criticised his wealth and multiple homes within Upper Canada. Upon his return to Canada in 1849, Mackenzie believed the government was still corrupt and advocated for reforms, albeit without calling for a rebellion. =Religious views= Mackenzie was a Presbyterian. Although he rebelled against the religion as a youth, he returned to the religion and remained faithful for the rest of his life. He supported the social gospel and believed clergy should be advocating for equality among citizens and was critical of clergy members who advocated for the status quo in the United States and Canada. Mackenzie was against attacking Catholics or Protestants for their religious beliefs. He believed all Christian denominations had persecuted other faiths at various points in their histories and that they all believed in miracles as outlined in the bible. However, he criticised the Papacy in the Message in 1859. When Mackenzie started his first newspaper in 1824, he wrote editorials that supported clergy reserves. These opinions began to change in 1827 when he opposed John Strachan's petition that the Church of England should receive the proceeds of selling clergy reserves. He also proposed transferring ownership of clergy reserves to the legislature and abolishing a religious test for employment and services. Mackenzie still wanted to abolish clergy reserves when he was a legislator in the 1850s and proposed making the reserves secular. He supported George Brown's proposals for the Crown to obtain ownership over clergy reserves and that any funds raised from these lands be distributed to municipalities based on their population. As a legislator in the 1850s, he opposed establishing Trinity College upon Crown lands. He worked with Wesleyan Methodists to oppose legislation that placed the properties of Methodist benevolent societies under the ownership of a corporation run by Methodist ministers. Instead, Mackenzie supported lay members who wanted representation in the organisational structure of this corporation. He also supported the secularisation of Clergy Reserves and abolishing Anglican rectories. After the trial for the murder of Robert Corrigan, Mackenzie spoke against the Roman Catholic judges and jury that acquitted the accused. He felt that the defendants were protected by members of the Catholic Church and despised religious meddling in politics from any Christian denomination. Mackenzie was also an opponent of dividing public education by religion. He was concerned that religious schools would teach children to follow a religion without challenging their beliefs. Instead, Mackenzie supported legislation in the 1850s that would create a school system funded by the provincial government that would be non-sectarian. He opposed efforts to increase sectarian school funding because it would cause their schools to be better funded than the common schools. =Political structure of Canada= Mackenzie believed Upper Canada's government would be more efficient in responding to the people's needs if the province was able to elect its lawmakers, similar to the American political system. His constitution for the State of Upper Canada proposed that all government officials, senators, legislators, military officers justices of the peace, governors and members of the executive branch be elected by the people using a ballot. He continued to hold this belief in 1859 when he promoted these ideas in the Message. When writing in the Examiner in 1849 criticised the governor- general's power to appoint the executive council, which could not be impeached or removed by an election or vote in the Legislative Assembly. He proposed legislation and amendments in the 1850s for direct elections of justices of the peace and sheriffs. He was not initially concerned with introducing an elected Legislative Council because he felt it was not harming the province and there were more important reforms to pursue first. He changed his mind on this matter because the council struggled to obtain a quorum at their meetings and slowed down the passage of legislation. After touring Canada in 1849, Mackenzie advocated for political reforms including increasing the size of the Legislative Assembly and instituting single-member districts that contained the same number of people per district regardless of its rural or urban status, or its location in Lower or Upper Canada. He advocated for abolishing land-ownership requirements to run for the Legislative Assembly and restricting the public offices that Legislatures could be appointed to. He believed these reforms would make it more difficult for the executive members of the assembly to bribe members into voting for their legislation. In 1834 Mackenzie supported a union of all the colonies in Canada that was centrally administered. In 1849 Mackenzie wrote that Upper Canada would inevitably become its own country and then annexed by the United States, a process which he wanted to avoid and in 1850 he encouraged politicians to discuss how Canada could become more independent. A few years later Mackenzie believed the union of the two Canadas negatively affected Upper Canada and advocated for its dissolution. He believed Upper Canada's taxes were subsidizing Lower Canada's expenses and infrastructure projects that were unlikely to become profitable. He also thought it was costly to duplicate officials and records for each province while maintaining two separate judicial and education systems. When Brown proposed \\"double-majority\\", requiring bills to receive support from a majority of MPs from both Canadas, Mackenzie stated this was a temporary measure for a broken union. In 1856 Mackenzie hoped that Upper Canada would be dissolved from the union and return as a British colony, but also allowed to elect its political leaders. By 1860 he published in Almanac for Independence and Freedom that he supported the annexation of Upper Canada by the northern United States Although it was called a responsible government, Mackenzie felt the system of government within the Province of Canada was disingenuous. He believed government ministers were distributing patronage appointments to maintain their majorities and power in the legislature. This system meant patronage appointments would not be accountable to the public they were serving, Mackenzie thought. He supported a bill in 1857 that would make all persons who had a contract with the Crown, public officer or public department ineligible to be a legislator. He proposed his own bill that would charge with bribery anyone who hired lobbyists and would fire any employee of the House if they accepted a gift in exchange for influencing bills or legislation. These proposals were tabled by the legislature. Although Mackenzie had spoken against various patronage systems during his life, he was upset when he was not able to influence appointments when he was a legislator. He complained to Rolph when his chosen candidate for census taker was not chosen. =Primogeniture and inheritance= In his first newspaper, Mackenzie supported primogeniture but this changed as he linked the Family Compact with their hereditary titles. When creating a constitution for his State of Upper Canada, Mackenzie advocated for the abolition of hereditary titles and their financial and social benefits. During his tour of Canada in 1849 he called for abolishing laws that caused inheritance to only pass to the firstborn son and again called for the abolition of primogeniture laws in 1850. =Judicial reforms= When reporting for the 1846 New York State Constitutional Convention, Mackenzie advocated for the state to adopt a code of laws so that they were not dependent on established precedents inherited from Britain. He believed unwritten precedents disadvantaged regular citizens as they would not know what references to cite when giving their arguments in court. Mackenzie believed establishing a code of laws would simplify and make the legal system more assessable. Mackenzie also wanted justices of the peace to be elected by the general population and be barred from running as part of a political party. He believed good candidates would be elected by the people even if they were not the most qualified and running on a ticket with a political party would cause bad candidates to be elected on a good ticket. Mackenzie wrote that justices of the peace should have exclusive jurisdiction on matters up to $100 to reduce the number of appeals parties could make to each ruling and allow the courts to be financially accessible to most citizens. He was also against the Court of Chancery because he felt the court's decisions took too long to be rendered, was against institutions of the free press and fickle in its rulings. He was also against judges having the power to decide who could practice law in the state because he was against monopolies of any kind and registered lawyers could charge excessive fees if few people were available to represent clients. Mackenzie also supported proposals to replace all patronage jobs appointed by the Governor with open elections. During his tour of Canada in 1849, Mackenzie advocated for simplifying laws and passing legislation that codified these laws instead of relying on British precedence. In his articles in 1850 he believed that the legal system needed reforms so citizens could afford to bring grievances before the court. He advocated for abolishing the Court of Chancery, reducing lawyer fees, simplifying court proceedings and establishing conciliation proceedings proposing these ideas as a legislator in the 1850s He also wanted county judges to hear various cases for free and to abolish the system to licence lawyers so citizens could bring grievances before a judge at a low financial cost. He continued advocating for these reforms in the Message in 1859. Mackenzie opposed a bill that would allow persons who were 16 years old or younger and charged with a crime a trial in front of two justices. Mackenzie feared that this bill would cause increase the likelihood a juvenile delinquent would be imprisoned. He proposed an amendment that would allow a child to appeal the magistrate's sentence if a parent was not present to provide guidance. =Canadian-American relations= When writing for Mackenzie's Gazette in the late 1830s, Mackenzie advocated for a war between the United States and Great Britain in order to liberate Upper Canada from Great Britain. He also believed that a successful American invasion would bring peace to the continent and stated, \\"Until Canada is freed the revolution in America will not be complete.\\" In 1838 Mackenzie began calling for non-violent action to convince Great Britain that the cost of keeping Upper Canada as a colony was too great. He advocated for a boycott of Upper Canadian goods by the United States to help with this process. According to historian Lillian F. Gates, this change in attitude happened because Mackenzie wanted to publicly support United States President Van Buren and defeat Whig Party candidates in the upcoming 1838 United States elections. Mackenzie disagreed with the Whig Party's economic policies and claimed they favoured company monopolies over workers. He also believed that if the United States controlled Canada during a Whig Party presidency then Canadian land would be exploited for the United States' monetary gain. Mackenzie's support for Van Buren could only occur if he agreed with Van Buren's policy of not allowing armed conflict with Canada. By 1844, Mackenzie no longer supported the annexation of Canada by the United States. He disagreed with American nativism policies that disadvantaged him while living in the United States. Upon his return to Canada Mackenzie wrote in the Toronto Examiner that Americans would not want to pay for the high cost of defending Canada and if they annexed their northern neighbour they would force Canadians to help pay for the high defence budget. He also believed that Canadians would be treated as second-class citizens by Americans if they were annexed. Instead, Mackenzie advocated for a trade treaty between Canada and the United States. In 1860 Mackenzie outlined the benefits of Upper Canada becoming annexed by the United States, including unifying the economies of North American entities. However, he stated that annexation should only occur after the United States decided what to do about their slavery policies. Mackenzie praised Abraham Lincoln's election to be President of the United States and hoped that under his leadership the northern states would separate from the slave-holding states and merge with the British colonies. By 1861, Mackenzie was advocating for some sort of union between Britain, Canada, Ireland and the United States. =Economic policies= While in the legislature in the 1820s and 1830s Mackenzie sought to abolish imprisonment if a person could not pay their debts. He also advocated for people to be allowed to keep the minimum goods and money needed to restart employment if they encounter financial trouble. In his draft of the State of Upper Canada constitution, Mackenzie wanted to establish gold and silver as the only legal tender in his state and believed corporations should be held to the same liability standards that individual partnerships had to endure. Upon his return to Canada Mackenzie advocated for a stable currency. Mackenzie was critical of granting state aid or privileges to companies which would inadvertently make them monopolies. Mackenzie supported Van Buren's reelection for United States president because he believed Van Buren would oppose monopolies, creating new corporations and founding a United States national bank. He opposed the incorporation of a company to build a canal in Sault Ste. Marie because they would have exclusive control of the waterways in that area. He did not want the government to loan money to the Grand Trunk Railway because the company was chosen to build railways without a competitive bidding process and Hincks was financially benefitting from the company's success. Constituents also brought concerns about monopolies in the timber industry, which Mackenzie voiced in the legislature. He also wanted tougher laws for lending money to corporations, proposing in 1859 a requirement for three-fourths of Parliament and approval from the government leader before a loan could be approved. Mackenzie believed responsible government meant a Canadian Parliament would decide the budget and be transparent to the electorate about how that money was spent. He wanted this transparency to extend to government debts, the Post Office, and which public officials were defaulting on their loans to the province. His investigations into how public accounts were managed led to the creation of the Public Audit Act, but Mackenzie's amendments for public disclosure of banks used as public depositories, disclosure of expenditures of education and charitable organisations and warrants signed by the Inspector-General were not adopted. Mackenzie worked to create protections for the people who deposited their money in banks. He disliked the Bank of Upper Canada's exclusive rights to government deposits and their influence over political figures. Mackenzie reported that the bank was charging more interest on the government's debt than it was giving on the government's deposits in their bank and called for the end of its monopoly. He also criticised chartered banks for not paying interest on deposits they held and issuing notes that were not adequately secured. He supported restricting charters to new banks unless their ability to issue notes was safeguarded and restricted. As a legislator he opposed various bank bills because chartered banks would be allowed to increase the number of banknotes they could issue even though they did not publicly report their shareholders and did not complete the reports required by existing law. He was also concerned about the high amount of speculation banks were conducting. When reporting on the 1846 New York State Constitutional Convention, Mackenzie advocated for every person to be directly taxed at the same rate. He hoped this would cause large property holders to sell portions of their land to other citizens, thus increasing the number of landowners in the state.Upon his return to Canada Mackenzie was disappointed that land assessment laws, which valued businesses at the same rate regardless of size, were not updated. Mackenzie believed these laws favoured land speculators and disadvantaged the average citizen. Mackenzie also wanted to reduce government spending and Canadian tariffs. As a legislator in the 1850s Mackenzie opposed tariff increases to fund new railways as it caused farmers to pay taxes to help railway companies. =Land policies and immigration= Mackenzie included in his draft constitution for the State of Upper Canada that immigrants from any country should be encouraged to come to Upper Canada to cultivate the wilderness. He proposed reserving one million acres of land for public schools and wanted Crown lands, clergy reserves, land reserved for King's College, Toronto and all unsold land held by Canada Company to be given to the legislature. He also wanted reform to Upper Canada's system of selling land so that it resembled the United States' uniform price policy and allow buying a property with cash payments. Although he had supported the American land sales system while in Canada, he disagreed with this system in 1844 and characterised it as identical to the land monopoly system employed by the British Empire. He was against land speculators buying land warrants from soldiers who could not pay the required $200 at a government auction, who then sold groups of land together as a larger lot at a discounted price. Mackenzie believed land that was given to settlers for free should not be taken away from them. At the 1846 New York State Constitutional Convention he repeated his support for banning the repossession of land to pay debts and limiting the amount of land a person could own. Upper Canada was struggling to develop and sell land upon Mackenzie's return in 1851 and land speculators were buying many available lots without developing them. Clear Grits wanted to sell lots for a cheaper price for cash payments by settlers. Mackenzie believed this would disadvantage settlers because many needed more time to obtain the funds to buy land. Mackenzie also wanted the government to survey more land and sold to settlers who were required to develop the land. He also wanted lots reserved for families who did not own land yet and protect these lots from seizure to pay debts. Mackenzie preferred private ownership of properties over state ownership and believed in voluntaryism. =Civil Rights= Mackenzie advocated for including the right to a free press in the constitution of Upper Canada. He also included equality for everyone under the law. He wrote articles in the Gazette that were against the institution of slavery but not in favour of abolitionism. As mayor of Toronto, he chaired a meeting of an anti-slave society. He banned slavery in his constitution for the state of Upper Canada and guaranteed equal rights for all citizens regardless of their race. He was against the British policy of freeing slaves that landed in their territory and proposed that the American government buy every slave's freedom with federal bonds. However, he wrote in the 1830s that American slaves should not be freed because \\"we should be merely changing the form not the substance, of his slavery.\\" Mackenzie was against enfranchising voters who were renters or tenants. Mackenzie feared that members of the executive would lend Crown land to people who would feel pressured to vote for the ruling party. Instead, Mackenzie wanted a society where every person was able to vote because they owned land. As a legislator in the 1850s Mackenzie voted to extend voting rights to more people but wanted to use secret ballots if non-land owners were also permitted to vote. Legacy =Historical reputation= At the time of his death, newspapers printed obituaries emphasising his independence, desire for an honest public administration and patriotism that was misguided. Charles Lindsey wrongly stated that Mackenzie was solely responsible for the Upper Canada Rebellion. In 1885 J.C. Dent wrote Story of Upper Canada Rebellion which attacked Mackenzie's character and political achievements. Mackenzie's son James and son-in-law John King both refuted Dent's research, with the later publishing his own book about Mackenzie called The Other Side of the 'Story'. William Dawson LeSueur's biography of Mackenzie in the early twentieth century presented him as an unsympathetic figure who did not influence the creation of Canada nor the politics of the 1850s. Kilbourn agreed with LeSueur that Mackenzie's political career in the 1850s did not influence the governance of Canada. Lillian F. Gates wrote that detractors of Mackenzie could describe him as \\"a dauntless little old man, persistently getting in the way of the big engines\\" but Gates thought Mackenzie did not know how to achieve his goals and instead became a \\"moral crusader\\". Historians and commentators on Mackenzie's life have disagreed on whether his actions suppressed democratic reforms or caused politicians to hasten its development. Lindsey believed Mackenzie's actions in 1837 caused responsible government to be established in the colony and without this new governance structure Upper Canada would not have remained a British colony or its people would be so poor that they would seek another country's help to liberate them. LeSueur believed that Mackenzie's actions hurt his reform causes and delayed the implementation of responsible government. According to Ronald Stagg, William Kilbourn's biography determined that Mackenzie's actions did not influence Upper Canada's later democratic reforms. Kilbourn wrote that the cause of reform was hampered by the exodus of reform politicians fleeing arrest in Upper Canada after the 1837 rebellion. =In memoriam= In 1960, William Lyon Mackenzie Collegiate Institute opened in North York. Mackenzie's name was chosen for the school after a public contest was held. Toronto Fire Services named a fireboat the William Lyon Mackenzie in 1964. Dennis Lee included Mackenzie in his poem entitled 1838. Mackenzie also appeared in 1837: The Farmers‚Äô Revolt, a play written in 1976 by Rick Salutin. Mackenzie's early 19th century home in Queenston, Ontario has been restored and is now the Mackenzie Printery and Newspaper Museum. The museum includes a working mid-19th-century printing shop and features displays of printing equipment and technology ranging over a 500-year period. The museum is operated by the Niagara Parks Commission. \\"The Rebel Mayor\\", a Twitter account which posted satirical comments on various candidates in Toronto's 2010 mayoral election, was written in the persona and voice of Mackenzie. The feed was eventually revealed to have been written by Shawn Micallef, a journalist for the publications Eye Weekly and Spacing.

It is named after the Bannock Burn, a burn running through the town before flowing into the River Forth. History Land in the vicinity of Bannockburn town, probably between the Pelstream and Bannock burns (hence Bannockburn), was the site of the Battle of Bannockburn fought in 1314‚Äîone of the pivotal battles of the 13th/14th century Wars of Independence between the kingdoms of Scotland and England. A large monument and visitor centre is located near the site of the battle. In previous generations tourists came to visit the site and look at the Borestone. The dignity of the barony of Bannockburn is currently held by Hope Vere Anderson, a descendant of the Sandilands and Vere families of Sandilands and Lesmahagow, Lanarkshire who were the original Barons of Bannockburn in the 14th century. In the year of 1746, after the Battle of Culloden, Bonny Prince Charlie stayed in Bannockburn House where he met the future mother of his child. Telford's circular-arch roadbridge over the Bannock Burn Bannockburn village used to be famous for its carpet and tweed factories and woollen mills. In the late 18th and early 19th centuries the Wilson family of Bannockburn designed and wove tartans for the British Army. Many of the so-called Clan tartans were created by the Wilsons in response to the needs of the Clan chiefs who, without their own authentic tartans, approached the Wilsons for suitable patterns. The visit of King George IV to Edinburgh in 1822, and his insistence that the Clan chiefs attend his banquets and levees in their Clan tartans, prompted this reaction. The woollen mills employed 7-800 people around 1880. The last mill closed in 1924. The turnpike road between Edinburgh and Stirling was constructed in the 1750s and passed through Bannockburn. The route originally passed over the Old Bridge, until the construction in 1819 of a circular-arch stone bridge, built by engineer Thomas Telford, spanning the burn downstream of the battle site. Growth of both Stirling and Bannockburn during the 19th and 20th centuries means that the two now form a contiguous conurbation, and Bannockburn was latterly incorporated into the city (then royal burgh) of Stirling. Bannockburn had a population of 7,352 at the time of the 2001 census. The area contains most necessary amenities, including a library, bank and local shops. It is served by Bannockburn Primary School, in the centre of the community, and Bannockburn High School in nearby Broomridge. Several new private housing schemes have been built in and around Bannockburn since the 1990s, increasing pressure on the already-overcrowded high school. As a result of this, in 2007 and 2008 Bannockburn High School was extended to provide additional capacity. Between 1852 and 1949 Bannockburn had a railway station on the Scottish Central Railway, located next to the site of the bus depot. Nowadays, however, residents wishing to use the train must travel into the centre of Stirling. Introduction of a new station with a park-and-ride facility was proposed in the Strategic Transport Projects Review in 2009. Bannockburn is served by the 38, 54, 54A, 56 and 60 bus services. Sports ;Football Bannockburn and Hillpark have two amateur football teams, Bannockburn AmateursBannockburn Amateurs (Est. 1968) and Milton FCMilton Amateurs FC (Est. 1972). Bannockburn Amateurs won the West of Scotland Amateur Cup for the fifth time in 2019. Striker Davie Grant smashed in an ok number of goals that season which barely achieved him The Golden Pint award for best goals to pint ratio over the season. ;Rugby Bannockburn also hosts its own Rugby Club. Formerly known as St Modans HSFP RFC (Est. 1978), it changed its name to Bannockburn RFC in 1996. Bannockburn currently plays in the Scottish Hydro Electric Regional League: Caledonia Division 2 Midlands. ;Cricket Bannockburn also plays host to St Modans HSFP Cricket Club, who play in the Strathmore and Perthshire Cricket Union Division 1. In July 2013, playing against Perth Doo'cot CC, St Modans scored 329 runs in response to Perth's 326, making it what is believed to be the highest scoring game ever recorded in the SPCU.http://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/sport/local-sport/cricket- big-ben-chimes-out-2722693 Image:MiltonFC.gif2009 Milton FC Team Image:WestCup.jpgBannockburn Amateurs West of Scotland Cup Winners 2009 Image:Bannockburnrfc.jpegBannockburn RFC  Places of worship  * Murrayfield United Free Church Of Scotland * Our Lady and St Ninian's R.C.

Unlike a permutation matrix, where the nonzero entry must be 1, in a generalized permutation matrix the nonzero entry can be any nonzero value. An example of a generalized permutation matrix is :\\\\begin{bmatrix} 0 & 0 & 3 & 0\\\\\\\\\\\\ 0 & -7 & 0 & 0\\\\\\\\\\\\ 1 & 0 & 0 & 0\\\\\\\\\\\\ 0 & 0 & 0 & \\\\sqrt2\\\\end{bmatrix}.  Structure  An invertible matrix A is a generalized permutation matrix if and only if it can be written as a product of an invertible diagonal matrix D and an (implicitly invertible) permutation matrix P: i.e., : A=DP. =Group structure= The set of n√ón generalized permutation matrices with entries in a field F forms a subgroup of the general linear group GL(n,F), in which the group of nonsingular diagonal matrices Œî(n, F) forms a normal subgroup. Indeed, the generalized permutation matrices are the normalizer of the diagonal matrices, meaning that the generalized permutation matrices are the largest subgroup of GL in which diagonal matrices are normal. The abstract group of generalized permutation matrices is the wreath product of F√ó and Sn. Concretely, this means that it is the semidirect product of Œî(n, F) by the symmetric group Sn: :Œî(n, F) ‚ãâ Sn, where Sn acts by permuting coordinates and the diagonal matrices Œî(n, F) are isomorphic to the n-fold product (F√ó)n. To be precise, the generalized permutation matrices are a (faithful) linear representation of this abstract wreath product: a realization of the abstract group as a subgroup of matrices. =Subgroups= * The subgroup where all entries are 1 is exactly the permutation matrices, which is isomorphic to the symmetric group. * The subgroup where all entries are ¬±1 is the signed permutation matrices, which is the hyperoctahedral group. * The subgroup where the entries are mth roots of unity \\\\mu_m is isomorphic to a generalized symmetric group. * The subgroup of diagonal matrices is abelian, normal, and a maximal abelian subgroup. The quotient group is the symmetric group, and this construction is in fact the Weyl group of the general linear group: the diagonal matrices are a maximal torus in the general linear group (and are their own centralizer), the generalized permutation matrices are the normalizer of this torus, and the quotient, N(T)/Z(T) = N(T)/T \\\\cong S_n is the Weyl group.  Properties  * If a nonsingular matrix and its inverse are both nonnegative matrices (i.e. matrices with nonnegative entries), then the matrix is a generalized permutation matrix. * The determinant of a generalized permutation matrix is given by :\\\\det(G)=\\\\det(P)\\\\cdot \\\\det(D)=\\\\operatorname{sgn}(\\\\pi)\\\\cdot d_{11}\\\\cdot \\\\ldots \\\\cdot d_{nn}, where \\\\operatorname{sgn}(\\\\pi) is the sign of the permutation \\\\pi associated with P and d_{11},\\\\ldots ,d_{nn} are the diagonal elements of D.  Generalizations  One can generalize further by allowing the entries to lie in a ring, rather than in a field. In that case if the non-zero entries are required to be units in the ring (invertible), one again obtains a group. On the other hand, if the non-zero entries are only required to be non-zero, but not necessarily invertible, this set of matrices forms a semigroup instead. One may also schematically allow the non-zero entries to lie in a group G, with the understanding that matrix multiplication will only involve multiplying a single pair of group elements, not \\"adding\\" group elements. This is an abuse of notation, since element of matrices being multiplied must allow multiplication and addition, but is suggestive notion for the (formally correct) abstract group G \\\\wr S_n (the wreath product of the group G by the symmetric group). Signed permutation group A signed permutation matrix is a generalized permutation matrix whose nonzero entries are ¬±1, and are the integer generalized permutation matrices with integer inverse. =Properties= * It is the Coxeter group B_n, and has order 2^nn!. * It is the symmetry group of the hypercube and (dually) of the cross- polytope. * Its index 2 subgroup of matrices with determinant equal to their underlying (unsigned) permutation is the Coxeter group D_n and is the symmetry group of the demihypercube. * It is a subgroup of the orthogonal group. Applications =Monomial representations= Monomial matrices occur in representation theory in the context of monomial representations. A monomial representation of a group G is a linear representation œÅ : G ‚Üí GL(n, F) of G (here F is the defining field of the representation) such that the image œÅ(G) is a subgroup of the group of monomial matrices.

The Philippine Sea Plate forms the floor of the sea.North Pacific Ocean It is bordered by the first island chain to the west, which comprises the Ryukyu Islands in the northwest and Taiwan in the due west, and the Filipino islands of Luzon, Catanduanes, Samar, Leyte and Mindanao to the southwest; by the Japanese islands of Honshu, Shikoku and Ky≈´sh≈´ to the north; by the second island chain to the east, which comprises the Bonin Islands and Iwo Jima in the northeast, the Mariana Islands (including Guam, Saipan and Tinian) in the due east, and Halmahera, Palau, Yap and Ulithi (of the Caroline Islands) in the southeast; and by Indonesia's Morotai Island to the south. The sea has a complex and diverse undersea relief. The floor is formed into a structural basin by a series of geologic faults and fracture zones. Island arcs, which are actually extended ridges protruding above the ocean surface due to plate tectonic activity in the area, enclose the Philippine Sea to the north, east and south. The Philippine archipelago, Ryukyu Islands, and the Marianas are examples. Another prominent feature of the Philippine Sea is the presence of deep sea trenches, among them the Philippine Trench and the Mariana Trench, containing the deepest point on the planet. Geography ISS while flying over the Philippine Sea =Location= Location of the Philippine Sea The Philippine Sea has the Philippines and Taiwan to the west, Japan to the north, the Marianas to the east and Palau to the south. Adjacent seas include the Celebes Sea which is separated by Mindanao and smaller islands to the south, the South China Sea which is separated by Philippines, and the East China Sea which is separated by the Ryukyu Islands. =Extent= The International Hydrographic Organization defines the Philippine Sea as \\"that area of the North Pacific Ocean off the Eastern coasts of the Philippine Islands\\", bounded as follows: > On the west.

It subducts under the Philippine Mobile Belt which carries most of the Philippine archipelago and eastern Taiwan. Between the two plates is the Philippine Trench. =Marine biodiversity= The Philippine Sea has a marine territorial scope of over , and an EEZ of 2.2 million km2. Attributed to an extensive vicariance and island integrations, the Philippines contains the highest number of marine species per unit area relative to the countries within the Indo-Malay-Philippines Archipelago, and has been identified as the epicenter of marine biodiversity. With its inclusion in the Coral Triangle, the Philippine Sea encompasses over 3,212 fish species, 486 coral species, 800 seaweed species, and 820 benthic algae species, wherein the Verde Island Passage is dubbed as \\"the center of the center of marine fish biodiversity\\". Within its territory, thirty-three endemic species of fish have been identified, including the blue-spotted angelfish (Chaetodontoplus caeruleopunctatus) and the sea catfish (Arius manillensis). The Philippine marine territory has also become a breeding and feeding ground for endangered marine species, such as the whale shark (Rhincodon typus), the dugong (Dugong dugon), and the megamouth shark (Megachasma pelagios). =Coral Triangle= The Coral Triangle, or the Indo- Malayan Triangle, is considered as the global center of marine biodiversity, its total oceanic area approximately 2 million square kilometers. It encompasses the tropical waters of Malaysia, Indonesia, the Philippines, Timor-Leste, Papua New Guinea and Solomon Islands. The Philippines is found at the apex of the Coral Triangle, taking up of the Coral Triangle, with the country's coral reef area in the Coral Triangle ranging from to , which has over 500 species of scleractinian or stony corals, and 12 endemic coral species have been identified here as well. The Coral Triangle houses 75% of the world's coral species which is estimated to be at around 600 different species, along with over 2000 different types of reef fish. It is also home to six of the world's seven species of marine turtles, namely hawksbill, loggerhead, leatherback, green turtle, olive ridley, and sea turtle. Up until now, there is no single explanation of the diversity found in the Coral Triangle, as most researchers have attributed the diversity to geological occurrences like plate tectonics. It also helps in providing and supporting the livelihoods of 120 million people, and is able to provide food to the Philippine coastal communities and millions more worldwide. The whale shark tourism in the Coral Triangle also helps provide a steady source of income for the community. Apart from the Philippines, the marine sources found in the Coral Triangle have high economic value across the globe. Countries surrounding the Coral Triangle also help provide their locals with technical assistance and capability to build toward conservation and sustainability for food security, livelihoods, biodiversity and economic development. Climate change also continuously affects the coastal ecosystem found in the Coral Triangle, as it contributes to rising sea levels and ocean acidification, thus endangering marine animals like fish and turtles. Consequently, this also has a negative effect on local livelihoods such as fishing and tourism. Corals are not able to adapt and survive if water will keep on warming, as this makes the corals absorb more carbon dioxide, altering pH balance making it acidic. Biology The Philippine Sea hosts an exotic marine ecosystem. About five hundred species of hard and soft corals occur in the coastal waters and 20 per cent of the worldwide known shellfish species are found in Philippine waters. Sea turtles, sharks, moray eels, octopuses and sea snakes along with numerous species of fish such as tuna can commonly be observed. Additionally, the Philippine Sea serves as spawning ground for Japanese eel, tuna and different whale species. =Biodiversity= Human impact The Philippine Sea is both a centre of marine biodiversity as well as a biodiversity hotspot. At least 418 species are being threatened because of unsustainable practices. According to the Asia Development Bank, there is a 90% reduction in marine life in the area, due to the various economic procedures being performed. The Philippine Sea he terminal point of sewage pipelines from the cities. Mangrove forests are also being removed for the sake of both property development and wood production. Mercury wastes and mining runoff also end up within the Philippine Sea. These are some of the reasons why the Philippines is ranked as one of the highest in reef degradation. Climate change The rise in temperature change caused shifts in the marine ecosystems. The ideal temperature for coral to is 24-29 degrees Celsius. If the water temperature goes above or below this threshold, the coral growth would slow down or even die. As fish and other marine life rely on corals for sustenance and habitat, communities that rely on fishing are heavily affected as well. As the Philippine Sea is within the Pacific Ring of Fire, the physical damage caused by typhoons coming from the east can further destroy the marine habitats. History Japanese Carrier Division Three under attack by United States Navy aircraft from Task Force 58, late afternoon, 20 June 1944. The heavy cruiser circling at right, nearest to the camera, is either Maya or Ch≈çkai. Beyond that, is the small aircraft carrier Chiyoda. The first European to navigate the Philippine Sea was Ferdinand Magellan in 1521, who named it Mar Filipinas when he and his men were in the Mariana Islands prior to the exploration of the Philippines. Later it was discovered by other Spanish explorers from 1522 to 1565 and the site of the famous galleon trade route. Between 19 and 20 June 1944, the Battle of the Philippine Sea (a very large and decisive World War II naval battle between Japan and the United States) took place in the eastern Philippine Sea, near the Mariana Islands. The aircraft carriers Taih≈ç, Sh≈çkaku, Juny≈ç, Hiy≈ç and Ryuho were bombed, torpedoed and sunk by American carrier-based planes and assaulted from other naval vessels. The aerial part of the Battle of the Philippine Sea was nicknamed the \\"Great Marianas Turkey Shoot\\" due to massive losses of Japanese aircraft and pilots. The battle facilitated the Allied conquests of Saipan, Guam and Tinian in the Marianas, Palau in the Southwest, and ultimately the Philippines. It was not until 1989 that the United States Department of Defense revealed the loss of a one- megaton nuclear bomb in the Philippine Sea during the 1965 Philippine Sea A-4 incident. Following an escalation of the Spratly Islands dispute in 2011, various Philippine government agencies started using the neologism \\"West Philippine Sea\\" to refer to the South China Sea. However, a PAGASA spokesperson said that the sea to the east of the Philippines will continue to be called the Philippine Sea. =Battles of the Philippine Sea= A historic battle between the naval fleets of the United States and Japan took place in the vicinity of the Philippine Sea. This was called The Battle of the Philippine Sea, and occurred near the Mariana Islands from 19‚Äì20 June 1944. It was also the largest carrier-to-carrier battle in history which featured the United States Fifth Fleet and the 1st Mobile Fleet of the Imperial Japanese Navy. Aside from the navy, aerial activity was also present in the Battle of the Philippine Sea, as hundreds of aircraft from both countries fired at each other. The Americans indisputably won, and nicknamed the aerial war the ‚ÄúGreat Marianas Turkey Shoot‚Äù due to the number of Japanese aircraft shot down. Japan struggled to recover from the severe damages of its imperial navy and air strength suffered from the battle. This heavily attributed to the victory of the United States in the Battle of the Philippine Sea which was a vital part of the Americans' reclamation of the Philippines, and the Mariana Islands from Japan. Economy =Fisheries= The Philippines depends on the Philippine Sea for one of its sources of food and livelihood. In the Coral Triangle area, the Philippines harvest seaweeds, milkfish, shrimp, oyster, mussel and live reef fish as aquaculture products. Fishermen also catch most fishes like small pelagics, anchovy, sardine, mackerel and tuna, among many other species found. Recent scientific expedition has found that the Benham Rise (also known as the Philippine Rise) within the sea is diverse in its marine ecosystem that it attracts migratory commercial fish like tuna, marlin and mackerel. The Benham Rise is also considered as a rich fishing ground for fishermen from Aurora, Quezon and Bicol. The Bureau of Fisheries and Aquatic Resources thought it necessary to teach fishermen sustainable fishing so as to prevent the destruction of coral formations which could negatively affect the food chain of the migratory fish. They have considered migratory fish to be in quite of a high value, as, for example, a single blue tuna fin found in the Benham Rise, can be sold at in the market.

(Such P,D are not unique.) For a finite-dimensional vector space V, a linear map T:V\\\\to V is called diagonalizable if there exists an ordered basis of V consisting of eigenvectors of T. These definitions are equivalent: if T has a matrix representation A = PDP^{-1} as above, then the column vectors of P form a basis of eigenvectors of T, and the diagonal entries of D are the corresponding eigenvalues of T; with respect to this eigenvector basis, A is represented by D. Diagonalization is the process of finding the above P and D. Diagonalizable matrices and maps are especially easy for computations, once their eigenvalues and eigenvectors are known. One can raise a diagonal matrix D to a power by simply raising the diagonal entries to that power, and the determinant of a diagonal matrix is simply the product of all diagonal entries; such computations generalize easily to A=PDP^{-1}. Geometrically, a diagonalizable matrix is an inhomogeneous dilation (or anisotropic scaling) ‚Äî it scales the space, as does a homogeneous dilation, but by a different factor along each eigenvector axis, the factor given by the corresponding eigenvalue. A square matrix that is not diagonalizable is called defective. It can happen that a matrix A with real entries is defective over the real numbers, meaning that A = PDP^{-1} is impossible for any invertible P and diagonal D with real entries, but it is possible with complex entries, so that A is diagonalizable over the complex numbers. For example, this is the case for a generic rotation matrix. Many results for diagonalizable matrices hold only over an algebraically closed field (such as the complex numbers). In this case, diagonalizable matrices are dense in the space of all matrices, which means any defective matrix can be deformed into a diagonalizable matrix by a small perturbation; and the Jordan normal form theorem states that any matrix is uniquely the sum of a diagonalizable matrix and a nilpotent matrix. Over an algebraically closed field, diagonalizable matrices are equivalent to semi-simple matrices.  Definition  A square n \\\\times n matrix A over a field F is called diagonalizable or nondefective if there exists an invertible matrix P such that P^{-1}AP is a diagonal matrix. Formally,  Characterization  The fundamental fact about diagonalizable maps and matrices is expressed by the following: * An n \\\\times n matrix A over a field F is diagonalizable if and only if the sum of the dimensions of its eigenspaces is equal to n, which is the case if and only if there exists a basis of F^n consisting of eigenvectors of A. If such a basis has been found, one can form the matrix P having these basis vectors as columns, and P^{-1}\\\\\\\\!AP will be a diagonal matrix whose diagonal entries are the eigenvalues of A. The matrix P is known as a modal matrix for A. * A linear map T : V \\\\to V is diagonalizable if and only if the sum of the dimensions of its eigenspaces is equal to \\\\operatorname{dim}(V), which is the case if and only if there exists a basis of V consisting of eigenvectors of T. With respect to such a basis, T will be represented by a diagonal matrix. The diagonal entries of this matrix are the eigenvalues of T. Another characterization: A matrix or linear map is diagonalizable over the field F if and only if its minimal polynomial is a product of distinct linear factors over F. (Put another way, a matrix is diagonalizable if and only if all of its elementary divisors are linear.) The following sufficient (but not necessary) condition is often useful. Let A be a matrix over F. If A is diagonalizable, then so is any power of it. Conversely, if A is invertible, F is algebraically closed, and A^n is diagonalizable for some n that is not an integer multiple of the characteristic of F, then A is diagonalizable. Proof: If A^n is diagonalizable, then A is annihilated by some polynomial \\\\left(x^n - \\\\lambda_1\\\\right) \\\\cdots \\\\left(x^n - \\\\lambda_k\\\\right), which has no multiple root (since \\\\lambda_j e 0) and is divided by the minimal polynomial of A. Over the complex numbers \\\\mathbb{C}, almost every matrix is diagonalizable. More precisely: the set of complex n \\\\times n matrices that are not diagonalizable over \\\\mathbb{C}, considered as a subset of \\\\mathbb{C}^{n \\\\times n}, has Lebesgue measure zero. One can also say that the diagonalizable matrices form a dense subset with respect to the Zariski topology: the non- diagonalizable matrices lie inside the vanishing set of the discriminant of the characteristic polynomial, which is a hypersurface. From that follows also density in the usual (strong) topology given by a norm. The same is not true over \\\\mathbb{R}. The Jordan‚ÄìChevalley decomposition expresses an operator as the sum of its semisimple (i.e., diagonalizable) part and its nilpotent part. Hence, a matrix is diagonalizable if and only if its nilpotent part is zero. Put in another way, a matrix is diagonalizable if each block in its Jordan form has no nilpotent part; i.e., each \\"block\\" is a one-by-one matrix.  Diagonalization  The diagonalization of a matrix can be interpreted as a rotation of the axes to align them with the eigenvectors. If a matrix A can be diagonalized, that is, : P^{-1}AP = \\\\begin{pmatrix} \\\\lambda_1 & 0 & \\\\dots & 0 \\\\\\\\\\\\ 0 & \\\\lambda_2 & \\\\dots & 0 \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\vdots & \\\\vdots & \\\\ddots & \\\\vdots \\\\\\\\\\\\ 0 & 0 & \\\\dots & \\\\lambda_n \\\\end{pmatrix}, then: : AP = P\\\\begin{pmatrix} \\\\lambda_1 & 0 & \\\\dots & 0 \\\\\\\\\\\\ 0 & \\\\lambda_2 & \\\\dots & 0 \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\vdots & \\\\vdots & \\\\ddots & \\\\vdots \\\\\\\\\\\\ 0 & 0 & \\\\dots & \\\\lambda_n \\\\end{pmatrix}. Writing P as a block matrix of its column vectors \\\\vec{\\\\alpha}_{i} :P = \\\\begin{pmatrix}\\\\vec{\\\\alpha}_1 & \\\\vec{\\\\alpha}_2 & \\\\cdots & \\\\vec{\\\\alpha}_n\\\\end{pmatrix}, the above equation can be rewritten as :A\\\\vec{\\\\alpha}_i = \\\\lambda_i\\\\vec{\\\\alpha}_i\\\\qquad(i=1,2,\\\\cdots,n). So the column vectors of P are right eigenvectors of A, and the corresponding diagonal entry is the corresponding eigenvalue. The invertibility of P also suggests that the eigenvectors are linearly independent and form a basis of F^{n}. This is the necessary and sufficient condition for diagonalizability and the canonical approach of diagonalization. The row vectors of P^{-1} are the left eigenvectors of A. When a complex matrix A\\\\in\\\\mathbb{C}^{n\\\\times n} is a Hermitian matrix (or more generally a normal matrix), eigenvectors of A can be chosen to form an orthonormal basis of \\\\mathbb{C}^n, and P can be chosen to be a unitary matrix. If in addition, A\\\\in\\\\mathbb{R}^{n\\\\times n} is a real symmetric matrix, then its eigenvectors can be chosen to be an orthonormal basis of \\\\mathbb{R}^n and P can be chosen to be an orthogonal matrix. For most practical work matrices are diagonalized numerically using computer software. Many algorithms exist to accomplish this.  Simultaneous diagonalization  A set of matrices is said to be simultaneously diagonalizable if there exists a single invertible matrix P such that P^{-1}AP is a diagonal matrix for every A in the set. The following theorem characterises simultaneously diagonalizable matrices: A set of diagonalizable matrices commutes if and only if the set is simultaneously diagonalizable. The set of all n \\\\times n diagonalizable matrices (over \\\\mathbb{C}) with n > 1 is not simultaneously diagonalizable. For instance, the matrices : \\\\begin{bmatrix} 1 & 0 \\\\\\\\\\\\ 0 & 0 \\\\end{bmatrix} \\\\quad\\\\text{and}\\\\quad \\\\begin{bmatrix} 1 & 1 \\\\\\\\\\\\ 0 & 0 \\\\end{bmatrix} are diagonalizable but not simultaneously diagonalizable because they do not commute. A set consists of commuting normal matrices if and only if it is simultaneously diagonalizable by a unitary matrix; that is, there exists a unitary matrix U such that U^{*}\\\\\\\\!AU is diagonal for every A in the set. In the language of Lie theory, a set of simultaneously diagonalizable matrices generate a toral Lie algebra.  Examples  = Diagonalizable matrices = * Involutions are diagonalizable over the reals (and indeed any field of characteristic not 2), with ¬±1 on the diagonal. * Finite order endomorphisms are diagonalisable over \\\\mathbb{C} (or any algebraically closed field where the characteristic of the field does not divide the order of the endomorphism) with roots of unity on the diagonal. This follows since the minimal polynomial is separable, because the roots of unity are distinct. * Projections are diagonalizable, with 0s and 1s on the diagonal. * Real symmetric matrices are diagonalizable by orthogonal matrices; i.e., given a real symmetric matrix A, Q^{\\\\mathrm T}AQ is diagonal for some orthogonal matrix Q. More generally, matrices are diagonalizable by unitary matrices if and only if they are normal. In the case of the real symmetric matrix, we see that A=A^{\\\\mathrm T}, so clearly AA^{\\\\mathrm T} = A^{\\\\mathrm T}A holds. Examples of normal matrices are real symmetric (or skew- symmetric) matrices (e.g. covariance matrices) and Hermitian matrices (or skew-Hermitian matrices). See spectral theorems for generalizations to infinite-dimensional vector spaces. = Matrices that are not diagonalizable = In general, a rotation matrix is not diagonalizable over the reals, but all rotation matrices are diagonalizable over the complex field. Even if a matrix is not diagonalizable, it is always possible to \\"do the best one can\\", and find a matrix with the same properties consisting of eigenvalues on the leading diagonal, and either ones or zeroes on the superdiagonal ‚Äì known as Jordan normal form. Some matrices are not diagonalizable over any field, most notably nonzero nilpotent matrices. This happens more generally if the algebraic and geometric multiplicities of an eigenvalue do not coincide. For instance, consider : C = \\\\begin{bmatrix} 0 & 1 \\\\\\\\\\\\ 0 & 0 \\\\end{bmatrix}. This matrix is not diagonalizable: there is no matrix U such that U^{-1}CU is a diagonal matrix. Indeed, C has one eigenvalue (namely zero) and this eigenvalue has algebraic multiplicity 2 and geometric multiplicity 1. Some real matrices are not diagonalizable over the reals. Consider for instance the matrix : B = \\\\left[\\\\begin{array}{rr} 0 & 1 \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\\\\\!-1 & 0 \\\\end{array}\\\\right]. The matrix B does not have any real eigenvalues, so there is no real matrix Q such that Q^{-1}BQ is a diagonal matrix. However, we can diagonalize B if we allow complex numbers. Indeed, if we take : Q = \\\\begin{bmatrix} 1 & \\\\textrm{i} \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\textrm{i} & 1 \\\\end{bmatrix}, then Q^{-1}BQ is diagonal. It is easy to find that B is the rotation matrix which rotates counterclockwise by angle \\\\theta=\\\\tfrac{3\\\\pi}{2} Note that the above examples show that the sum of diagonalizable matrices need not be diagonalizable. = How to diagonalize a matrix = Diagonalizing a matrix is the same process as finding its eigenvalues and eigenvectors, in the case that the eigenvectors form a basis. For example, consider the matrix :A=\\\\left[\\\\begin{array}{rrr} 0 & 1 & \\\\\\\\!\\\\\\\\!\\\\\\\\!-2\\\\\\\\\\\\ 0 & 1 & 0\\\\\\\\\\\\ 1 & \\\\\\\\!\\\\\\\\!\\\\\\\\!-1 & 3 \\\\end{array}\\\\right]. The roots of the characteristic polynomial p(\\\\lambda)=\\\\det(\\\\lambda I-A) are the eigenvalues \\\\lambda_1 = 1,\\\\lambda_2 = 1,\\\\lambda_3 = 2. Solving the linear system (I-A)(\\\\mathbf{v})=0 gives the eigenvectors \\\\mathbf{v}_1 = (1,1,0) and \\\\mathbf{v}_2 = (0,2,1), while (2I-A)(\\\\mathbf{v})=0 gives \\\\mathbf{v}_3=(1,0,-1); that is, A(\\\\mathbf{v}_i)=\\\\lambda_i\\\\mathbf{v}_i for i = 1,2,3. These vectors form a basis of V=\\\\mathbb{R}^3, so we can assemble them as the column vectors of a change-of-basis matrix P to get: > P^{-1}\\\\\\\\!AP \\\\ = \\\\ \\\\left[\\\\begin{array}{rrr} 1 & \\\\,0 & 1\\\\\\\\\\\\ 1 & 2 & 0\\\\\\\\\\\\ 0 & 1 > & \\\\\\\\!\\\\\\\\!\\\\\\\\!\\\\\\\\!-1 \\\\end{array}\\\\right]^{-1} \\\\left[\\\\begin{array}{rrr} 0 & 1 & > \\\\\\\\!\\\\\\\\!\\\\\\\\!-2\\\\\\\\\\\\ 0 & 1 & 0\\\\\\\\\\\\ 1 & \\\\\\\\!\\\\\\\\!\\\\\\\\!-1 & 3 \\\\end{array}\\\\right] > \\\\left[\\\\begin{array}{rrr} 1 & \\\\,0 & 1\\\\\\\\\\\\ 1 & 2 & 0\\\\\\\\\\\\ 0 & 1 & \\\\\\\\!\\\\\\\\!\\\\\\\\!\\\\\\\\!-1 > \\\\end{array}\\\\right] \\\\ =\\\\ \\\\begin{bmatrix} 1&0&0\\\\\\\\\\\\ 0&1&0\\\\\\\\\\\\ 0&0&2\\\\end{bmatrix} > \\\\ =\\\\ D . We may see this equation in terms of transformations: P takes the standard basis to the eigenbasis, P(\\\\mathbf{e}_i) = \\\\mathbf{v}_i, so we have: > P^{-1}\\\\\\\\!AP(\\\\mathbf{e}_i) \\\\ =\\\\ P^{-1}\\\\\\\\!A(\\\\mathbf{v}_i) \\\\ =\\\\ > P^{-1}\\\\\\\\!(\\\\lambda_i\\\\mathbf{v}_i) \\\\ = \\\\ \\\\lambda_i\\\\mathbf{e}_i, so that P^{-1}\\\\\\\\!AP has the standard basis as its eigenvectors, which is the defining property of D. Note that there is no preferred order of the eigenvectors in P; changing the order of the eigenvectors in P just changes the order of the eigenvalues in the diagonalized form of A.  Application to matrix functions  Diagonalization can be used to efficiently compute the powers of a matrix A=PDP^{-1}: :\\\\begin{align} A^k &= \\\\left(PDP^{-1}\\\\right)^k = \\\\left(PDP^{-1}\\\\right) \\\\left(PDP^{-1}\\\\right) \\\\cdots \\\\left(PDP^{-1}\\\\right) \\\\\\\\\\\\ &= PD\\\\left(P^{-1}P\\\\right) D \\\\left(P^{-1}P\\\\right) \\\\cdots \\\\left(P^{-1}P\\\\right) D P^{-1} = PD^kP^{-1}, \\\\end{align} and the latter is easy to calculate since it only involves the powers of a diagonal matrix. For example, for the matrix A with eigenvalues \\\\lambda = 1,1,2 in the example above we compute: > \\\\begin{array}{rcl} A^k = PD^kP^{-1} &=& \\\\left[\\\\begin{array}{rrr} 1 & \\\\,0 & > 1\\\\\\\\\\\\ 1 & 2 & 0\\\\\\\\\\\\ 0 & 1 & \\\\\\\\!\\\\\\\\!\\\\\\\\!\\\\\\\\!-1 \\\\end{array}\\\\right] \\\\begin{bmatrix} > 1^k&0&0\\\\\\\\\\\\ 0&1^k&0\\\\\\\\\\\\ 0&0&2^k\\\\end{bmatrix} \\\\left[\\\\begin{array}{rrr} 1 & \\\\,0 > & 1\\\\\\\\\\\\ 1 & 2 & 0\\\\\\\\\\\\ 0 & 1 & \\\\\\\\!\\\\\\\\!\\\\\\\\!\\\\\\\\!-1 \\\\end{array}\\\\right]^{-1} \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\[1em] > &=& \\\\begin{bmatrix} 2 - 2^k & -1 + 2^k & 2 - 2^{k + 1} \\\\\\\\\\\\ 0 & 1 & 0 \\\\\\\\\\\\ -1 > + 2^k & 1 - 2^k & -1 + 2^{k + 1} \\\\end{bmatrix}. \\\\end{array} This approach can be generalized to matrix exponential and other matrix functions that can be defined as power series. For example, defining \\\\exp(A) = I + A + \\\\tfrac{1}{2!}A^2 + \\\\tfrac{1}{3!}A^3 + \\\\cdots , we have: > \\\\begin{array}{rcl} \\\\exp(A) = P\\\\,\\\\exp(D)\\\\,P^{-1} &=& \\\\left[\\\\begin{array}{rrr} > 1 & \\\\,0 & 1\\\\\\\\\\\\ 1 & 2 & 0\\\\\\\\\\\\ 0 & 1 & \\\\\\\\!\\\\\\\\!\\\\\\\\!\\\\\\\\!-1 \\\\end{array}\\\\right] > \\\\begin{bmatrix} e^1&0&0\\\\\\\\\\\\ 0&e;^1&0\\\\\\\\\\\\ 0&0&e;^2\\\\end{bmatrix} > \\\\left[\\\\begin{array}{rrr} 1 & \\\\,0 & 1\\\\\\\\\\\\ 1 & 2 & 0\\\\\\\\\\\\ 0 & 1 & \\\\\\\\!\\\\\\\\!\\\\\\\\!\\\\\\\\!-1 > \\\\end{array}\\\\right]^{-1} \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\[1em] &=& \\\\begin{bmatrix} 2 e - e^2 & -e + e^2 & > 2 e - 2 e^2\\\\\\\\\\\\ 0 & e & 0\\\\\\\\\\\\ -e + e^2 & e - e^2 & -e + 2 e^2 \\\\end{bmatrix}. > \\\\end{array} This is particularly useful in finding closed form expressions for terms of linear recursive sequences, such as the Fibonacci numbers. = Particular application = For example, consider the following matrix: :M = \\\\begin{bmatrix}a & b - a\\\\\\\\\\\\ 0 & b\\\\end{bmatrix}. Calculating the various powers of M reveals a surprising pattern: : M^2 = \\\\begin{bmatrix}a^2 & b^2-a^2 \\\\\\\\\\\\ 0 &b;^2 \\\\end{bmatrix},\\\\quad M^3 = \\\\begin{bmatrix}a^3 & b^3-a^3 \\\\\\\\\\\\ 0 &b;^3 \\\\end{bmatrix},\\\\quad M^4 = \\\\begin{bmatrix}a^4 & b^4-a^4 \\\\\\\\\\\\ 0 &b;^4 \\\\end{bmatrix},\\\\quad \\\\ldots The above phenomenon can be explained by diagonalizing M. To accomplish this, we need a basis of \\\\mathbb{R}^2 consisting of eigenvectors of M. One such eigenvector basis is given by : \\\\mathbf{u} = \\\\begin{bmatrix} 1 \\\\\\\\\\\\ 0 \\\\end{bmatrix} = \\\\mathbf{e}_1,\\\\quad \\\\mathbf{v} = \\\\begin{bmatrix} 1 \\\\\\\\\\\\ 1 \\\\end{bmatrix} = \\\\mathbf{e}_1 + \\\\mathbf{e}_2, where ei denotes the standard basis of Rn. The reverse change of basis is given by :\\\\mathbf{e}_1 = \\\\mathbf{u},\\\\qquad \\\\mathbf{e}_2 = \\\\mathbf{v} - \\\\mathbf{u}. Straightforward calculations show that :M\\\\mathbf{u} = a\\\\mathbf{u},\\\\qquad M\\\\mathbf{v} = b\\\\mathbf{v}. Thus, a and b are the eigenvalues corresponding to u and v, respectively. By linearity of matrix multiplication, we have that : M^n \\\\mathbf{u} = a^n\\\\, \\\\mathbf{u},\\\\qquad M^n \\\\mathbf{v} = b^n\\\\,\\\\mathbf{v}. Switching back to the standard basis, we have :\\\\begin{align} M^n \\\\mathbf{e}_1 &= M^n \\\\mathbf{u} = a^n \\\\mathbf{e}_1, \\\\\\\\\\\\ M^n \\\\mathbf{e}_2 &= M^n \\\\left(\\\\mathbf{v} - \\\\mathbf{u}\\\\right) = b^n \\\\mathbf{v} - a^n\\\\mathbf{u} = \\\\left(b^n - a^n\\\\right) \\\\mathbf{e}_1 + b^n\\\\mathbf{e}_2. \\\\end{align} The preceding relations, expressed in matrix form, are :M^n = \\\\begin{bmatrix}a^n & b^n - a^n \\\\\\\\\\\\ 0 & b^n \\\\end{bmatrix}, thereby explaining the above phenomenon.  Quantum mechanical application  In quantum mechanical and quantum chemical computations matrix diagonalization is one of the most frequently applied numerical processes. The basic reason is that the time-independent Schr√∂dinger equation is an eigenvalue equation, albeit in most of the physical situations on an infinite dimensional space (a Hilbert space). A very common approximation is to truncate Hilbert space to finite dimension, after which the Schr√∂dinger equation can be formulated as an eigenvalue problem of a real symmetric, or complex Hermitian matrix. Formally this approximation is founded on the variational principle, valid for Hamiltonians that are bounded from below. First-order perturbation theory also leads to matrix eigenvalue problem for degenerate states.

A pipe band is a musical ensemble consisting of pipers and drummers. The term pipes and drums, used by military pipe bands is also common. The most common form of pipe band consists of a section of pipers playing the Great Highland bagpipe, a section of snare drummers (often referred to as 'side drummers'), several tenor drummers and usually one, though occasionally two, bass drummers. The tenor drummers and bass drummer are referred to collectively as the 'bass section' (or in North America as the 'midsection'), and the entire drum section is collectively known as the drum corps. The band follows the direction of the pipe major; when on parade the band may be led by a drum major, who directs the band with a mace. Standard instrumentation for a pipe band involves 6 to 25 pipers, 3 to 10 side drummers, 1 to 6 tenor drummers and 1 bass drummer. Occasionally this instrumentation is augmented to include additional instruments (such as additional percussion instruments or keyboard instruments), but this is typically done only in concert settings. Pipe bands are a long-standing tradition in areas with Celtic roots, most notably in Scotland, Ireland, the regions of Galicia, Asturias and Cantabria in Northern Spain. and Brittany in Northwestern France. The tradition is also long-standing in former British colonies such as Canada, Australia, and New Zealand, as well as constituents of the Commonwealth of Nations. History Canada's Simon Fraser University Pipe Band, winner of six World Pipe Band Championships, performing in George Square, Glasgow The pipe band's origins are in the military, but are obscure as contemporary historical regimental records had no direct interest in piping, giving only hints at details. The Royal Scottish Pipe Band Association maintains that the origin of military pipe bands are traced back to the early 1800s as soldiers tasked with keeping pace and morale on long marches with their respective regiments.The global spread of piping can also be directly attributed with British colonial expansion. Pipers and drummers in the employ of the British Army and Scottish emigrants brought with them traditional music and the culture surrounding the practice. It is known that pipers served in regiments from the earliest times; the Royal Scots have records referring to pipers dating back to the early seventeenth century. During this time, soldiers specially employed as pipers were employed by the officers of the regiments as private pipers, although countless others were certainly trained in piping while serving. This situation continued until the 1840s, when Queen Victoria's enthusiasm for all things Highland was instrumental in the War Office's decision that each battalion of the Highland regiments be allowed five pipers and a Pipe Major, which continues to be all that the British Army provides funds for to this day. Any additional pipers in the battalion pipe band were and are equipped today by funds from the Officers' Mess Fund of the battalion. By this time, pipers were already playing together with drummers, probably modelling themselves on the fife and drum bands which had existed in Switzerland since the 15th century. Drumming itself is as ancient as the concept of formed military units, and their original purpose on the battlefield was to signal tactical movements and keep cadence on the march. By the time World War I broke out, the pipe band represented a popular image of Scotland, both internally and externally. Military pipers were killed and injured in significant numbers in the Great War, before the practice of playing in the trenches was banned. The ban was often not observed; Canadian piper James Richardson was awarded the Victoria Cross for playing in action in 1916. Pipes have occasionally played into battle, notably at El Alamein, Dieppe, the Normandy beaches, and the crossing of the Rhine. The Calgary Highlanders went into action for the first time at Hill 67 in Normandy with company pipers playing; it was the only time the Regiment did so.Bercuson, David Battalion of Heroes: The Calgary Highlanders in World War II Military pipers have also served in both Gulf Wars. Military pipes and drums Pipe bands have long been part of military tradition, most notably in the United Kingdom and its former colonies. Many of the same standard tunes are found in both the military and civilian pipe band repertoires, and many similarities exist in terms of musical style, historical and musical influences, and dress and deportment. A military Remembrance Day parade in Ottawa, Ontario. Musicians in British Army bands are normally required to take on a secondary role in the battlefield as medics. However, in most cases the pipes and drums in a Scottish or Irish infantry regiment constitute a machine gun or mortar platoon (as the Corps of Drums does in an English or Welsh infantry regiment). As a result, in addition to being musicians, members of the pipes and drums must also be qualified fighting soldiers. Unlike musicians, who belong to the Corps of Army Music, the pipers and drummers belong to the regiment in which they serve and are soldiers first and foremost. In other parts of the world, military pipe bands are generally part of reserve regiments, and also draw civilian members into their ranks. The British Army runs its own pipes and drums training facility, the Army School of Bagpipe Music and Highland Drumming, in Edinburgh, Scotland. To be qualified as a pipe major or drum major in the pipes and drums of a regiment of the British Army, candidates must successfully pass a series of courses at the school. =List of military pipe bands= Australia * Royal Victoria Regiment Association Pipes & Drums * Royal Australian Regiment Pipes and Drums Brazil * Brazilian Marine Pipes, Drum and Bugle Corps Canada * The Royal Highland Fusiliers of Canada (Cambridge, Kitchener Regiment) Pipes and Drums Band * Pipes and Drums of the Ceremonial Guard * Royal Canadian Air Force Pipes and Drums * Pipes and Drums of the Royal Military College of Canada * The Nova Scotia Highlanders (North) Pipes and Drums * 48th Highlanders of Canada Pipes & Drums * The Argyll and Sutherland Highlanders of Canada Pipes and Drums * The Black Watch (Royal Highland Regiment) of Canada Pipes and Drums * Regimental Pipes and Drums of The Calgary Highlanders * The Canadian Scottish Regiment (Princess Mary's) Band * The Lorne Scots (Peel, Dufferin and Halton Regiment) Regimental Pipes and Drums * The Pipes and Drums of The Cameron Highlanders of Ottawa * 8 Wing Pipes and Drums * 12 Wing Pipes and Drums * 14 Wing Pipes and Drums * The Toronto Scottish Regiment (Queen Elizabeth The Queen Mother's Own) Pipes and Drums Estonia *Estonian Defence League Pipe Band Ireland Currently each of the nine Permanent Defence Force infantry battalions has a pipe band trained by the Irish Defence Forces School of Music.

The music played by pipe bands generally consists of music from the Scottish tradition, the Irish tradition and the Breton tradition, either in the form of traditional folk tunes and dances or popular music that has been adapted for pipes. Examples of typical pipe bands forms include marches, slow airs, jigs and reels, and strathspeys. In recent years there has been a great deal of emphasis placed on new forms, especially the suite. A good example of a suite for pipe band is Don Thompson's composition Journey to Skye (1987). In conventional pipe band music, each section of instruments has a different role in the music. Generally speaking, the pipers deliver the melodic and harmonic material, while the side drummers provide a rhythmically interactive accompaniment part. The tenor drummers provide rhythmic pulses and the bass drummer anchors the rhythms, providing a strong and steady beat. =Pipe section= The bagpipers are responsible for providing all melodic material in the music. Generally speaking, all of the pipers play a unison melody on their chanters, with their drones providing the harmonic support and filling out the sound. When harmony is written within the pipe section, it is usually a two- part harmony, and is usually scored in a 2:1 ratio (with two-thirds of the players on the melody and one third of the players on the harmony part). Because of the limited range of the chanter, the harmonic possibilities are somewhat limited, but well-written harmony in a pipe band setting can be extremely effective. Pipe band harmony is sometimes referred to as 'seconds', although this simply refers to a second part and not to the interval of a second. In fact, intervals of a second are rarely found in pipe band harmony parts, except in passing. Instead, it is the consonant intervals which are stressed, such as perfect fourths and fifths, and even more commonly, parallel thirds and sixths. In contemporary arrangements, a merge between harmony and melody known as 'counter-melody' has been aired. A counter-melody is similar to a harmony part, but is distinguished because it has a melodic line of its own. Counter-melody can take a completely different thematic approach and can dramatically change the flow and atmosphere of the melodic unison. This technique is relatively new in the pipe band circuit, and in most cases require skill and timing to achieve in full unison. =Drum corps= The drum corps of a pipe band consists of a section of drummers playing highland snare drums and the bass section. In the early days of pipe bands, rope tension snare drums were common, but as bagpipe tuning pitches became higher, a brighter tone was demanded from the drum corps. Pipe band drummers now play on drums with very tight, knitted kevlar heads, designed for maximum tension to create a very crisp and strident sound. Since today's drum is so facile as a result of its design, players are often able to execute extremely complicated and technically demanding rudimentary patterns. The pipe band drum corps is responsible for both supporting the piping with a solid rhythmic foundation and sense of pulse, often creating an interesting contrapuntal line unto itself. The line played by the drum corps (referred to as the 'drum score') is usually based on rudimentary patterns and can often be quite involved, with solo, unison and contrapuntal passages throughout. A popular pattern in many scores is for the lead drummer to play a phrase, and the section to play in response. This technique is known as seconds (sometimes referred to as chips, or forte). While standard practice in pipe bands is for the pipe section to perform the traditional or standard arrangements of the melodies, including gracenotes, drum scores are very often composed by the lead drummer of the band. Bass section The bass section (also referred to as a midsection) consists of a section of tenor drummers and a bass drummer. Their role is to provide rhythmic support to the entire ensemble. In this respect, the bass section allows the drum corps to delegate their timekeeping responsibilities and allows more freedom in the drum scores. Generally, the bass drum provides a steady pulse, playing on the downbeat and on the strong beats of the bar, and the tenors support that pulse, often adding supporting beats, accents and dynamic interest. Tenor drums in their modern form are a relatively new addition to the pipe band. While pipe bands of yesteryear would often include tenor drummers, they would usually be \\"swinging tenors\\", players who would swing their sticks for elaborate visual effect but who would rarely play. Today's tenor drummers play pitched drums, and careful thought is given as to which pitches to use and at which times. The pitches help provide melodic or harmonic accompaniment to the bagpipes; creating a more dynamic flow between the drum corps and the pipe corps. In some cases, five or six tenor drummers have been used, providing a palette of individual pitches for use in a variety of musical situations. The swinging also known as flourishing has developed somewhat into an art form, with drummers playing and swinging in unison or sequential flows. Tenor drums are also still commonly played on a soft harness, or sling, instead of the typical marching harness used by the snare drums, but shoulder harness tenors are now used by several pipe bands. Uniform Pipe band at Inverness Castle Pipe band uniforms vary from band to band. However, the typical uniform consists of a glengarry (cap), shirt, tie, waistcoat (vest), jacket, kilt, hose and ghillie brogues. Each pipe band has its own signature tartan that may reflect the area the band originated from or the history of the band. Jackets and waistcoats are usually black, and shirts are often short-sleeved for comfort. Each band also has its own tie, which can match the kilt tartan, or is sometimes merely a block colour. In competition, appearing smart in uniform is essential; some competitions have dress codes, for instance certain types of jackets only, ties must be knotted at the collar and so on. Pipe bands often vary the uniform worn, depending on the formality of the occasion. Very formal occasions require jackets to be worn, whereas less formal occasions do not, and only the waistcoat is worn. On semi-formal occasions, the jacket is not worn, but a long-sleeved shirt is worn under the waistcoat. This increases the formality of the outfit, but decreases the comfort. On occasion, no waistcoat is worn, in which case the shirt sleeve must be of long length. Pipe Major uniforms are usually different, to distinguish them from the other members of the band. More traditional highland dress may be worn, sometimes with a feather bonnet. Competition Competition is a primary focus for many pipe bands throughout the world. Every year, mainly in the period from spring to autumn, pipe bands around the world compete against each other at various venues, often at Highland festivals. For many, this usually culminates in the World Pipe Band Championships, held on the 2nd weekend of August. A typical season for many competing pipe bands might include ten or more of these competitions. Europe (especially the UK and Ireland), North America, Australia, and New Zealand have active competitive pipe band communities, but there are competing bands from throughout the world. Since 1930, when the Scottish band association (today known as the Royal Scottish Pipe Band Association) was formed, there has been a World Pipe Band Championship competition, known as 'The Worlds' held annually in Glasgow during August. For competitive bands, the title of World Champion is highly coveted, and this event is seen as the culmination of a year's worth of preparation, rehearsal and practice. The entirety of the World Championships takes place on one day in August, on Glasgow Green. Typically, several hundred bands attend, traveling from all over the world. Bands arrive early and, in most grades, are required to perform in a qualifying round which takes place in the morning. The top bands at the end of the qualifying round play in a second event in the afternoon to determine an aggregate winner. To win, Grade One bands must perform in two events, a March, Strathspey & Reel event (known as a \\"set\\" or \\"MSR\\") which consists of three pre-arranged tunes, and a Medley event, which consists of a short selection of music chosen and arranged by the band. The rules for the medley contest are very open, requiring only a minimum and maximum time frame (between 5:30 and 7 minutes) and a minimum of different time signatures that must be played as well as two 3 pace rolls played at the beginning of the tune (also known as an attack). In addition to performing at 'The Worlds', most internationally competitive bands participate in a season of events that are generally held during Scotland's summer months. While events of this type are usually held at Highland Games, band competitions in Scotland, Ireland and Northern Ireland are often large enough to be held as events unto themselves. The grading and organization of these events is generally consistent with the World Championships and the events are typically administered by the governing Pipe Band Association. =Grading system= Prizes at the Worlds are awarded in the following nine categories: * Grade 1 * Grade 2 * Grade 3A * Grade 3B * Juvenile * Grade 4A * Grade 4B * Novice Juvenile A * Novice Juvenile B In the Novice Juvenile and Juvenile categories, band members must be under the age of eighteen, with the exception of one \\"adult\\" player, often an instructor, who may serve as the Pipe Major or Pipe Sergeant. The remaining categories have no age restriction, and are instead based on proficiency. Grading and eligibility are overseen by the National Council and Music Board of the RSPBA, and bands can be downgraded or upgraded at the annual regrading, which takes place at the end of the competition season. A band can apply for downgrading, but will have to compete in two further contests in their existing grade. Because of time constraints, the RSPBA uses \\"A\\" and \\"B\\" designations in Grade 3, 4, and Novice Juvenile for major competitions. In doing so, bands are grouped based on prior-years' performances, and can receive promotions within their respective grade. These vary slightly throughout the world. For example, in the Republic of Ireland and North America, Grade 4B is known as Grade 5, and in Australia and New Zealand there is no Novice grade at all. Noncompetitive piping Many pipe bands perform in parades and other public events as a primary activity. These bands are sometimes referred to as \\"street bands\\" or \\"parade bands\\". Some military bands fall into this category as well, playing for regimental functions in lieu of, or supplemented by, competitions and/or concerts. In recent times, concert performances have become increasingly popular. The purely musical nature of these venues enable the exploration of non- traditional repertoire, and serves as another means by which piping and drumming can present itself to the public in a modern fashion. Bagad Bagad Penhars from Quimper, with bagpipes, bombardes, and drums. A lesser-known type of pipe band that has already expanded the pipe band genre is the bagad, a Breton cultural phenomenon. Bagads began in the thirties to counter the widespread decay of the living Breton folk tradition. A modern-day bagad consists of a biniou braz (Breton bagpipes), a bombarde section, a drum corps, and any additional musical instruments the band wishes to add. Common additions are clarinets, brass instruments (often trumpets or saxophones), guitars, and other forms of binious.

There is some discussion of the historical Scottish smallpipes in Collinson's history of the bagpipes.Collinson, F., The Bagpipe, The history of a Musical Instrument, Routledge & Kegan Paul, London, 1975 But more reliable research and information can be obtained in Hugh Cheape's \\"Bagpipes: A National Collection.\\" Some instruments are being built as direct copies of historical examples, but few modern instruments are directly modelled from older examples; the modern instrument is typically larger and lower-pitched. The innovations leading to the modern instrument, in particular the design of the reeds, were largely taken from the Northumbrian smallpipes. Although there is evidence of small pipes dating back to 15th century, in its current form it is perhaps the youngest bagpipe with any popularity, having only existed in this form since the early 1980s. Characteristics Scottish Smallpipes are distinguished from the Northumbrian smallpipes by having an open end to the chanter, and usually by the lack of keys. This means that the sound of the chanter is continuous, rather than staccato, and that its range is only nine notes, rather than the nearly two octaves of the later 18th/19th century style Northumbrian pipes. A further distinction from the Northumbrian smallpipes is that the Scottish Smallpipes lack an unbroken line of traditional playing. The instrument has a cylindrically bored chanter, most commonly pitched in A, although any key is feasible; D, C, and B flat are also common keys. Being cylindrically bored, the chanter sounds an octave lower than a conical-bored chanter of the same size, such as that of the Border pipes. Scottish Smallpipes are normally bellows-blown like the Northumbrian pipes and Border pipes. Mouth-blown versions are also available, but they are less common because of the advantages of using a bellows, e.g being able to talk or sing whilst playing and blowing room temperature air across the reeds results in more stable tuning. It is most commonly unkeyed, but occasionally high B, G sharp, F natural, and C natural keys are added. Though it would in principle be possible to add as many keys as to the modern Northumbrian smallpipes, not many pipers use a set with more than 9 keys. Most music written for the instrument uses only the nine notes of its unkeyed range. The drones, typically three in number, are set in a common stock and are usually tuned in one of two patterns. For pipes in A, the tenor drone is tuned to the low \\"A\\" of the chanter, usually the tonic note, and the bass drone to the \\"A\\" an octave below this. There is also sometimes a dominant drone - this can be either a baritone, tuned a fifth above the bass, or else an alto drone, tuned a fifth above the tenor. For tunes in the key of D, the dominant drone can be either shut off or retuned. Most makers now prefer to make a baritone drone, rather than an alto, and many use only the bass and tenor. Other makers have developed drones compatible with both A and D chanters, so that one instrument can be used with either chanter. These sets include both A and D drones. One example is the \\"ADAD\\" style, with bass, baritone, tenor, and alto, as seen here:. And by using longer tuning pins, and northumbrian smallpipes-influenced tuning beads, some smallpipe drones can easily be retuned to a pitch one or two tones higher. A Baritone drone in C can be retuned to D, or E for example.Nate Banton's Quick Start Guide to Scottish SmallpipesIan Ketchin Smallpipes This allows for increased drone tuning options, such as playing fifth or fourth tuned baritone or alto drones. History Originally one of the first documented bagpipes in Scotland, along with the Border pipes, smallpipes were popular in the Lowland areas of Scotland as far north as Aberdeen. Evidence shows them to have existed since the 15th century (Highland pipes can only be documented from the 16th Century), when they were used for dancing and entertainment in court and castle, later they became popular amongst burgh pipers, and town minstrels until the early 19th Century, when the demise of the town pipers led to their disappearing from the record. Being bellows-blown this made them suitable for playing for long periods. Bellows- blown smallpipes are believed to have entered Scotland via England, and the continent of Europe, examples are preserved in many drawings, carvings, and paintings from 15th century onwards, and in Europe from the 12th century onwards. Since there was a break in the continuous playing tradition of the smallpipes, and Border pipes, no absolute, definitive playing style can be ascribed to them. However, according to the evidence provided by surviving sheet music written for these pipes (Dixon, Peacock, Riddell,) their style depended more on variations, runs, and arpeggios, as opposed to the surviving Highland music which is dominated by stylised gracenote techniques. Smallpipes are extremely popular with Highland pipers, many of whom keep them, or a set of Border pipes, as a second instrument and play them according to the Highland tradition. Though it has somewhat supplanted the musically unsatisfactory Highland practice chanter as a relatively quiet rehearsal instrument for Highland pipers, it has gained wide currency as a session instrument, for both the Highland and Border pipe repertoires. The Scottish smallpipes were the first widely available instrument to allow Highland pipers to participate in musical sessions with fiddlers, flautists and other instruments, as well as to accompany singers. Leading players include Hamish Moore, Gordon Mooney, Iain MacInnes, Allan MacDonald, Fin Moore, Br√¨ghde Chaimbeul, Ross Ainslie, David Barnes, Gary West and Fred Morrison, as well as the late Martyn Bennett.

This order is part of an ancient group of insects termed the Palaeoptera, which also contains dragonflies and damselflies. Over 3,000 species of mayfly are known worldwide, grouped into over 400 genera in 42 families. Mayflies exhibit a number of ancestral traits that were probably present in the first flying insects, such as long tails and wings that do not fold flat over the abdomen. Their immature stages are aquatic fresh water forms (called \\"naiads\\" or \\"nymphs\\"), whose presence indicates a clean, unpolluted environment. They are unique among insect orders in having a fully winged terrestrial preadult stage, the subimago, which moults into a sexually mature adult, the imago. Mayflies \\"hatch\\" (emerge as adults) from spring to autumn, not necessarily in May, in enormous numbers. Some hatches attract tourists. Fly fishermen make use of mayfly hatches by choosing artificial fishing flies that resemble the species in question. One of the most famous English mayflies is Rhithrogena germanica, the fisherman's \\"March brown mayfly\\". The brief lives of mayfly adults have been noted by naturalists and encyclopaedists since Aristotle and Pliny the Elder in classical times. The German engraver Albrecht D√ºrer included a mayfly in his 1495 engraving The Holy Family with the Mayfly to suggest a link between heaven and earth. The English poet George Crabbe compared the brief life of a daily newspaper with that of a mayfly in the satirical poem \\"The Newspaper\\" (1785), both being known as \\"ephemera\\". Description =Nymph= Mayfly nymph, dorsal view, showing the paired gills and three projections on the abdomen; wing buds are visible on the thorax. Immature mayflies are aquatic and are referred to as nymphs or naiads. In contrast to their short lives as adults, they may live for several years in the water. They have an elongated, cylindrical or somewhat flattened body that passes through a number of instars (stages), molting and increasing in size each time. When ready to emerge from the water, nymphs vary in length, depending on species, from . The head has a tough outer covering of sclerotin, often with various hard ridges and projections; it points either forwards or downwards, with the mouth at the front. There are two large compound eyes, three ocelli (simple eyes) and a pair of antennae of variable lengths, set between or in front of the eyes. The mouthparts are designed for chewing and consist of a flap-like labrum, a pair of strong mandibles, a pair of maxillae, a membranous hypopharynx and a labium. Nymph of the mayfly Cloeon dipterum, showing seven pairs of gills along the sides of the abdomen The thorax consists of three segments - the hindmost two, the mesothorax and metathorax, being fused. Each segment bears a pair of legs which usually terminate in a single claw. The legs are robust and often clad in bristles, hairs or spines. Wing pads develop on the mesothorax, and in some species, hindwing pads develop on the metathorax. The abdomen consists of ten segments, some of which may be obscured by a large pair of operculate gills, a thoracic shield (expanded part of the prothorax) or the developing wing pads. In most taxa up to seven pairs of gills arise from the top or sides of the abdomen, but in some species they are under the abdomen, and in a very few species the gills are instead located on the coxae of the legs, or the bases of the maxillae. The abdomen terminates in a pair of, or three, slender thread-like projections. =Subimago= The final moult of the nymph is not to the full adult form, but to a winged stage called a subimago that physically resembles the adult, but which is usually sexually immature and duller in colour. The subimago, or dun, often has partially cloudy wings fringed with minute hairs known as microtrichia; its eyes, legs and genitalia are not fully developed. Females of some mayflies (subfamily Palingeniinae) do not moult from a subimago state into an adult stage and are sexually mature while appearing like a subimago with microtrichia on the wing membrance. Oligoneuriine mayflies form another exception in retaining microtrichia on their wings but not on their bodies. Subimagos are generally poor fliers, have shorter appendages, and typically lack the colour patterns used to attract mates. In males of Ephoron leukon, the subimagos have forelegs that are short and compressed, with accordion like folds, and expands to more than double its length after moulting. After a period, usually lasting one or two days but in some species only a few minutes, the subimago moults to the full adult form, making mayflies the only insects where a winged form undergoes a further moult. =Imago= Adult Atalophlebia with the cylindrical dorsal or turban eyes visible Adult mayflies, or imagos, are relatively primitive in structure, exhibiting traits that were probably present in the first flying insects. These include long tails and wings that do not fold flat over the abdomen. Mayflies are delicate-looking insects with one or two pairs of membranous, triangular wings, which are extensively covered with veins. At rest, the wings are held upright, like those of a butterfly. The hind wings are much smaller than the forewings and may be vestigial or absent. The second segment of the thorax, which bears the forewings, is enlarged to hold the main flight muscles. Adults have short, flexible antennae, large compound eyes, three ocelli and non-functional mouthparts. In most species, the males' eyes are large and the front legs unusually long, for use in locating and grasping females during the mid-air mating. In the males of some families, there are two large cylindrical \\"turban\\" eyes that face upwards in addition to the lateral eyes. They are capable of detecting ultraviolet light and are thought to be used during courtship to detect females flying above them. In some species, all the legs are functionless, apart from the front pair in males. The abdomen is long and roughly cylindrical, with ten segments and two or three long cerci (tail-like appendages) at the tip. Uniquely among insects, mayflies possess paired genitalia, with the male having two aedeagi (penis- like organs) and the female two gonopores (sexual openings). Biology =Reproduction and life cycle= Subimago of Leptophlebia marginata Mayflies are hemimetabolous (they have \\"incomplete metamorphosis\\"). They are unique among insects in that they moult one more time after acquiring functional wings; this last-but-one winged (alate) instar usually lives a very short time and is known as a subimago, or to fly fishermen as a dun. Mayflies at the subimago stage are a favourite food of many fish, and many fishing flies are modelled to resemble them. The subimago stage does not survive for long, rarely for more than 24 hours. In some species, it may last for just a few minutes, while the mayflies in the family Palingeniidae have sexually mature subimagos and no true adult form at all. Mayflies (known locally as shadflies) swarm briefly in enormous numbers in Ontario. Often, all the mayflies in a population mature at once (a hatch), and for a day or two in the spring or autumn, mayflies are everywhere, dancing around each other in large groups, or resting on every available surface. In many species the emergence is synchronised with dawn or dusk, and light intensity seems to be an important cue for emergence, but other factors may also be involved. Baetis intercalaris, for example, usually emerges just after sunset in July and August, but in one year, a large hatch was observed at midday in June. The soft-bodied subimagos are very attractive to predators. Synchronous emergence is probably an adaptive strategy that reduces the individual's risk of being eaten. The lifespan of an adult mayfly is very short, varying with the species. The primary function of the adult is reproduction; adults do not feed, and have only vestigial (unusable) mouthparts, while their digestive systems are filled with air. Dolania americana has the shortest adult lifespan of any mayfly: the adult females of the species live for less than five minutes. Male adults may patrol individually, but most congregate in swarms a few metres above water with clear open sky above it, and perform a nuptial (courtship) dance. Each insect has a characteristic up-and-down pattern of movement; strong wingbeats propel it upwards and forwards with the tail sloping down; when it stops moving its wings, it falls passively with the abdomen tilted upwards. Females fly into these swarms, and mating takes place in the air. A rising male clasps the thorax of a female from below using his front legs bent upwards, and inseminates her. Copulation may last just a few seconds, but occasionally a pair remains in tandem and flutters to the ground. Males may spend the night in vegetation and return to the nuptial dance the following day. Although they do not feed, some briefly touch the surface to drink a little water before flying off. Females typically lay between four hundred and three thousand eggs. The eggs are often dropped onto the surface of the water; sometimes the female deposits them by dipping the tip of her abdomen into the water during flight, releasing a small batch of eggs each time, or deposits them in bulk while standing next to the water. In a few species, the female submerges and places the eggs among plants or in crevices underwater, but in general, they sink to the bottom. The incubation time is variable, depending at least in part on temperature, and may be anything from a few days to nearly a year. Eggs can go into a quiet dormant phase or diapause. The larval growth rate is also temperature-dependent, as is the number of moults. At anywhere between ten and fifty, these post-embryonic moults are more numerous in mayflies than in most other insect orders. The nymphal stage of mayflies may last from several months to several years, depending on species and environmental conditions. Many species breed in moving water, where there is a tendency for the eggs and nymphs to get washed downstream. To counteract this, females may fly upriver before depositing their eggs. For example, the female Tisza mayfly, the largest European species with a length of , flies up to upstream before depositing eggs on the water surface. These sink to the bottom and hatch after 45 days, the nymphs burrowing their way into the sediment where they spend two or three years before hatching into subimagos. When ready to emerge, several different strategies are used. In some species, the transformation of the nymph occurs underwater and the subimago swims to the surface and launches itself into the air. In other species, the nymph rises to the surface, bursts out of its skin, remains quiescent for a minute or two resting on the exuviae (cast skin) and then flies upwards, and in some, the nymph climbs out of the water before transforming. =Ecology= Rainbow trout are among the main predators of mayflies. Nymphs live primarily in streams under rocks, in decaying vegetation or in sediments. Few species live in lakes, but they are among the most prolific. For example, the emergence of one species of Hexagenia was recorded on Doppler weather radar by the shoreline of Lake Erie in 2003. In the nymphs of most mayfly species, the paddle-like gills do not function as respiratory surfaces because sufficient oxygen is absorbed through the integument, instead serving to create a respiratory current. However, in low-oxygen environments such as the mud at the bottom of ponds in which Ephemera vulgata burrows, the filamentous gills act as true accessory respiratory organs and are used in gaseous exchange. In most species, the nymphs are herbivores or detritivores, feeding on algae, diatoms or detritus, but in a few species, they are predators of chironomid and other small insect larvae and nymphs. Nymphs of Povilla burrow into submerged wood and can be a problem for boat owners in Asia. Some are able to shift from one feeding group to another as they grow, thus enabling them to utilise a variety of food resources. They process a great quantity of organic matter as nymphs and transfer a lot of phosphates and nitrates to terrestrial environments when they emerge from the water, thus helping to remove pollutants from aqueous systems. Along with caddisfly larvae and gastropod molluscs, the grazing of mayfly nymphs has a significant impact on the primary producers, the plants and algae, on the bed of streams and rivers. The nymphs are eaten by a wide range of predators and form an important part of the aquatic food chain. Fish are among the main predators, picking nymphs off the bottom or ingesting them in the water column, and feeding on emerging nymphs and adults on the water surface. Carnivorous stonefly, caddisfly, alderfly and dragonfly larvae feed on bottom-dwelling mayfly nymphs, as do aquatic beetles, leeches, crayfish and amphibians. Besides the direct mortality caused by these predators, the behaviour of their potential prey is also affected, with the nymphs' growth rate being slowed by the need to hide rather than feed. The nymphs are highly susceptible to pollution and can be useful in the biomonitoring of water bodies. Once they have emerged, large numbers are preyed on by birds, bats and by other insects, such as Rhamphomyia longicauda. Mayfly nymphs may serve as hosts for parasites such as nematodes and trematodes. Some of these affect the nymphs' behaviour in such a way that they become more likely to be predated. Other nematodes turn adult male mayflies into quasi-females which haunt the edges of streams, enabling the parasites to break their way out into the aqueous environment they need to complete their life cycles. The nymphs can also serve as intermediate hosts for the horsehair worm Paragordius varius, which causes its definitive host, a grasshopper, to jump into water and drown. Effects on ecosystem functioning Mayflies are involved in both primary production and bioturbation. A study in laboratory simulated streams revealed that the mayfly genus Centroptilum increased the export of periphyton, thus indirectly affecting primary production positively, which is an essential process for ecosystems. The mayfly can also reallocate and alter the nutrient availability in aquatic habitats through the process of bioturbation. By burrowing in the bottom of lakes and redistributing nutrients, mayflies indirectly regulate phytoplankton and epibenthic primary production. Once burrowing to the bottom of the lake, mayfly nymphs begin to billow their respiratory gills. This motion creates current that carries food particles through the burrow and allows the nymph to filter feed. Other mayfly nymphs possess elaborate filter feeding mechanisms like that of the genus Isonychia. The nymph have forelegs that contain long bristle-like structures that have two rows of hairs. Interlocking hairs form the filter by which the insect traps food particles. The action of filter feeding has a small impact on water purification but an even larger impact on the convergence of small particulate matter into matter of a more complex form that goes on to benefit consumers later in the food chain. =Distribution= A mayfly in Kanjirappally, Kerala, India. Mayflies are distributed all over the world in clean freshwater habitats, though absent from Antarctica. They tend to be absent from oceanic islands or represented by one or two species that have dispersed from nearby mainland. Female mayflies may be dispersed by wind, and eggs may be transferred by adhesion to the legs of waterbirds. The greatest generic diversity is found in the Neotropical realm, while the Holarctic has a smaller number of genera but a high degree of speciation. Some thirteen families are restricted to a single bioregion. The main families have some general habitat preferences: the Baetidae favour warm water; the Heptageniidae live under stones and prefer fast-flowing water; and the relatively large Ephemeridae make burrows in sandy lake or river beds. Conservation The nymph is the dominant life history stage of the mayfly. Different insect species vary in their tolerance to water pollution, but in general, the larval stages of mayflies, stoneflies (Plecoptera) and caddis flies (Trichoptera) are susceptible to a number of pollutants including sewage, pesticides and industrial effluent. In general, mayflies are particularly sensitive to acidification, but tolerances vary, and certain species are exceptionally tolerant to heavy metal contamination and to low pH levels. Ephemerellidae are among the most tolerant groups and Siphlonuridae and Caenidae the least. The adverse effects on the insects of pollution may be either lethal or sub-lethal, in the latter case resulting in altered enzyme function, poor growth, changed behaviour or lack of reproductive success. As important parts of the food chain, pollution can cause knock-on effects to other organisms; a dearth of herbivorous nymphs can cause overgrowth of algae, and a scarcity of predacious nymphs can result in an over-abundance of their prey species. Fish that feed on mayfly nymphs that have bioaccumulated heavy metals are themselves at risk. Adult female mayflies find water by detecting the polarization of reflected light. They are easily fooled by other polished surfaces which can act as traps for swarming mayflies. The threat to mayflies applies also to their eggs. \\"Modest levels\\" of pollution in rivers in England are sufficient to kill 80% of mayfly eggs, which are as vulnerable to pollutants as other life-cycle stages; numbers of the blue-winged olive mayfly (Baetis) have fallen dramatically, almost to none in some rivers. The major pollutants thought to be responsible are fine sediment and phosphate from agriculture and sewage. The status of many species of mayflies is unknown because they are known from only the original collection data. Four North American species are believed to be extinct. Among these, Pentagenia robusta was originally collected from the Ohio River near Cincinnati, but this species has not been seen since its original collection in the 1800s. Ephemera compar is known from a single specimen, collected from the \\"foothills of Colorado\\" in 1873, but despite intensive surveys of the Colorado mayflies reported in 1984, it has not been rediscovered. The International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) red list of threatened species includes one mayfly: Tasmanophlebi lacuscoerulei, the large blue lake mayfly, which is a native of Australia and is listed as endangered because its alpine habitat is vulnerable to climate change. Taxonomy and phylogeny Fossil adult Mickoleitia longimanus (Coxoplectoptera: Mickoleitiidae) from the Lower Cretaceous Crato Formation of Brazil, c. 108 mya Over 3,000 species of mayfly in 42 families and over 400 genera are known worldwide, including about 630 species in North America. Mayflies are an ancient group of winged (pterygote) insects. Putative fossil stem group representatives (e.g. Syntonopteroidea-like Lithoneura lameerrei) are already known from the late Carboniferous. The largest mayfly of all times may have been Bojophlebia prokopi from the Upper Carboniferous of Moravia with a wingspan of . The name Ephemeroptera is from the Greek ·ºêœÜŒÆŒºŒµœÅŒøœÇ, ' \\"short-lived\\" (literally \\"lasting a day\\", cf. English \\"ephemeral\\"), and œÄœÑŒµœÅœåŒΩ, ', \\"wing\\", referring to the brief lifespan of adults. The English common name is for the insect's emergence in or around the month of May in the UK. The name shadfly is from the Atlantic fish the shad, which runs up American East Coast rivers at the same time as many mayflies emerge. From the Permian, numerous stem group representatives of mayflies are known, which are often lumped into a separate taxon Permoplectoptera (e.g. including Protereisma permianum in the Protereismatidae, and Misthodotidae). The larvae of Permoplectoptera still had 9 pairs of abdominal gills, and the adults still had long hindwings. Maybe the fossil family Cretereismatidae from the Lower Cretaceous Crato Formation of Brazil also belongs as the last offshoot to Permoplectoptera. The Crato outcrops otherwise yielded fossil specimens of modern mayfly families or the extinct (but modern) family Hexagenitidae. However, from the same locality the strange larvae and adults of the extinct family Mickoleitiidae (order Coxoplectoptera) have been described, which represents the fossil sister group of modern mayflies, even though they had very peculiar adaptations such as raptorial forelegs. The oldest mayfly inclusion in amber is Cretoneta zherichini (Leptophlebiidae) from the Lower Cretaceous of Siberia. In the much younger Baltic amber numerous inclusions of several modern families of mayflies have been found (Ephemeridae, Potamanthidae, Leptophlebiidae, Ametropodidae, Siphlonuridae, Isonychiidae, Heptageniidae, and Ephemerellidae). The modern genus Neoephemera is represented in the fossil record by the Ypresian species N. antiqua from Washington state. Grimaldi and Engel, reviewing the phylogeny in 2005, commented that many cladistic studies had been made with no stability in Ephemeroptera suborders and infraorders; the traditional division into Schistonota and Pannota was wrong because Pannota is derived from the Schistonota. The phylogeny of the Ephemeroptera was first studied using molecular analysis by Ogden and Whiting in 2005. They recovered the Baetidae as sister to the other clades. Mayfly phylogeny was further studied using morphological and molecular analyses by Ogden and others in 2009. They found that the Asian genus Siphluriscus was sister to all other mayflies. Some existing lineages such as Ephemeroidea, and families such as Ameletopsidae, were found not to be monophyletic, through convergence among nymphal features. The following traditional classification is based on Peters and Campbell (1991), in Insects of Australia.

Maerten de Vos similarly illustrated a mayfly in his 1587 depiction of the fifth day of creation, amongst an assortment of fish and water birds. Detail of \\"mayfly\\" in lower right corner of Albrecht D√ºrer's engraving The Holy Family with the Mayfly, 1495 In 1495 Albrecht D√ºrer included a mayfly in his engraving The Holy Family with the Mayfly. The critics Larry Silver and Pamela H. Smith argue that the image provides \\"an explicit link between heaven and earth ... to suggest a cosmic resonance between sacred and profane, celestial and terrestrial, macrocosm and microcosm.\\" Illustration \\"May-Flies in Sunset Dance\\" by Philip Henry Gosse in a Victorian edition of Gilbert White's Natural History of Selborne In his 1789 book The Natural History and Antiquities of Selborne, Gilbert White described in the entry for \\"June 10th, 1771\\" how The mayfly has come to symbolise the transitoriness and brevity of life. The English poet George Crabbe, known to have been interested in insects, compared the brief life of a newspaper with that of mayflies, both being known as \\"Ephemera\\", things that live for a day: The theme of brief life is echoed in the artist Douglas Florian's 1998 poem, \\"The Mayfly\\". The American Poet Laureate Richard Wilbur's 2005 poem \\"Mayflies\\" includes the lines \\"I saw from unseen pools a mist of flies, In their quadrillions rise, And animate a ragged patch of glow, With sudden glittering\\". Another literary reference to mayflies is seen in The Epic of Gilgamesh, one of the earliest surviving great works of literature. The briefness of Gilgamesh's life is compared to that of the adult mayfly. In Szeged, Hungary, mayflies are celebrated in a monument near the Belv√°rosi bridge, the work of local sculptor Pal Farkas, depicting the courtship dance of mayflies. The American playwright David Ives wrote a short comedic play, Time Flies, in 2001, as to what two mayflies might discuss during their one day of existence. =In fly fishing= Fishing flies from Charles and Richard Bowlker's Art of Angling (1854) 2. \\"Blue Dun\\" mayfly. 3. \\"March Brown\\" mayfly Mayflies are the primary source of models for artificial flies, hooks tied with coloured materials such as threads and feathers, used in fly fishing. These are based on different life-cycle stages of mayflies. For example, the flies known as \\"emergers\\" in North America are designed by fly fishermen to resemble subimago mayflies, and are intended to lure freshwater trout. In 1983, Patrick McCafferty recorded that artificial flies had been based on 36 genera of North American mayfly, from a total of 63 western species and 103 eastern/central species. A large number of these species have common names among fly fishermen, who need to develop a substantial knowledge of mayfly \\"habitat, distribution, seasonality, morphology and behavior\\" in order to match precisely the look and movements of the insects that the local trout are expecting. Izaak Walton describes the use of mayflies for catching trout in his 1653 book The Compleat Angler; for example, he names the \\"Green-drake\\" for use as a natural fly, and \\"duns\\" (mayfly subimagos) as artificial flies. These include for example the \\"Great Dun\\" and the \\"Great Blue Dun\\" in February; the \\"Whitish Dun\\" in March; the \\"Whirling Dun\\" and the \\"Yellow Dun\\" in April; the \\"Green-drake\\", the \\"Little Yellow May-Fly\\" and the \\"Grey-Drake\\" in May; and the \\"Black-Blue Dun\\" in July. Nymph or \\"wet fly\\" fishing was restored to popularity on the chalk streams of England by G. E. M. Skues with his 1910 book Minor Tactics of the Chalk Stream. In the book, Skues discusses the use of duns to catch trout. The March brown is \\"probably the most famous of all British mayflies\\", having been copied by anglers to catch trout for over 500 years. Some English public houses beside trout streams such as the River Test in Hampshire are named \\"The Mayfly\\". =As a spectacle= The hatch of the giant mayfly Palingenia longicauda on the Tisza and Maros Rivers in Hungary and Serbia, known as \\"Tisza blooming\\", is a tourist attraction. The 2014 hatch of the large black- brown mayfly Hexagenia bilineata on the Mississippi River in the US was imaged on weather radar; the swarm flew up to 760 m (2500 feet) above the ground near La Crosse, Wisconsin, creating a radar signature that resembled a \\"significant rain storm\\", and the mass of dead insects covering roads, cars and buildings caused a \\"slimy mess\\". During the weekend of 13‚Äì14 June 2015, a large swarm of mayflies caused several vehicular accidents on the Columbia‚ÄìWrightsville Bridge, carrying Pennsylvania Route 462 across the Susquehanna River between Columbia and Wrightsville, Pennsylvania. The bridge had to be closed to traffic twice during that period due to impaired visibility and obstructions posed by piles of dead insects. =As food = Mayflies are consumed in several cultures and are estimated to contain the most raw protein content of any edible insect by dry weight. In Malawi, kungu, a paste of mayflies (Caenis kungu) and mosquitoes is made into a cake for eating. Adult mayflies are collected and eaten in many parts of China and Japan. Near Lake Victoria, Povilla mayflies are collected, dried and preserved for use in food preparations. =As a name for ships and aircraft= HMA No. 1 Mayfly emerging from her floating shed at Vickers' yard at Barrow-in-Furness on \\"Mayfly\\" was the crew's nickname for His Majesty's Airship No. 1, an aerial scout airship built by Vickers but wrecked by strong winds in 1911 before her trial flights. Two vessels of the Royal Navy were named HMS Mayfly: a torpedo boat launched in January 1907, and a Fly-class river gunboat constructed in sections at Yarrow in 1915. The Seddon Mayfly, which was constructed in 1908, was an aircraft that was unsuccessful in early flight. The first aircraft designed by a woman, Lillian Bland, was titled the Bland Mayfly. =Other human uses= In pre-1950s France, \\"chute de manne\\" was obtained by pressing mayflies into cakes and using them as bird food and fishbait. From an economic standpoint, mayflies also provide fisheries with an excellent diet for fish. Mayflies could find uses in the biomedical, pharmaceutical, and cosmetic industries. Their exoskeleton contains chitin, which has applications in these industries. Research on genome expression in the mayfly Cloeon dipterum, has provided ideas on the evolution of the insect wing and giving support to the so-called gill theory which suggests that the ancestral insect wing may have evolved from larval gills of aquatic insects like mayflies. Mayfly larvae do not survive in polluted aquatic habitats and, thus, have been chosen as bioindicators, markers of water quality in ecological assessments. In marketing, Nike produced a line of running shoes in 2003 titled \\"Mayfly\\". The shoes were designed with a wing venation pattern like the mayfly and were also said to have a finite lifetime. The telecommunication company Vodafone featured mayflies in a 2006 branding campaign, telling consumers to \\"make the most of now\\".

The word \\"Biniou\\" means bagpipe in the Breton language. There are two bagpipes called binio√π in Brittany: the traditional binio√π kozh or biniou-bihan (kozh means \\"old\\" in Breton, bihan means \\"small\\") and the binio√π bras (bras means \\"big\\"), which was brought into Brittany from Scotland in the late 19th century. The oldest native bagpipe in Brittany is the veuze, from which the binio√π kozh is thought to be derived. The binio√π bras is essentially the same as the Scottish Great Highland Bagpipe; sets are manufactured by Breton makers or imported from Scotland or elsewhere. The binio√π kozh has a one octave scale, and is very high-pitched with a soprano sound; it is tuned to play one octave higher than the bombard which it accompanies. More traditional forms have a single drone, while modern instruments sometimes have two. In the old days the leather used for the bag was usually from a dog's skin, but this is nowadays replaced by synthetic materials or other leathers which are easier to procure, like cow or sheep. Two soners; a talabarder (to the left) and a biniaouer (to the right). Traditionally it is played in duet with the bombard, a double reed instrument which sounds an octave below the binio√π chanter, for Breton folk dancing. The binio√π bras is typically used as part of a bagad band, although it is sometimes also paired with a bombard. Films *Of Pipers and Wrens (1997).

It is one of the most popular buildings in Kyoto, attracting many visitors annually.Bornoff, Nicholas (2000). The National Geographic Traveler: Japan. National Geographic Society. . It is designated as a National Special Historic Site, a National Special Landscape and is one of 17 locations making up the Historic Monuments of Ancient Kyoto which are World Heritage Sites. History Painted photograph of the Golden Pavilion in 1885. The gold leaf is peeling off due to deterioration over time. The site of Kinkaku-ji was originally a villa called Kitayama-dai (ÂåóÂ±±Á¨¨), belonging to a powerful statesman, Saionji Kintsune. Kinkaku-ji's history dates to 1397, when the villa was purchased from the Saionji family by sh≈çgun Ashikaga Yoshimitsu and transformed into the Kinkaku-ji complex. When Yoshimitsu died the building was converted into a Zen temple by his son, according to his wishes.Scott, David (1996). Exploring Japan. Fodor's Travel Publications, Inc. . Golden Pavilion following the 1950 arson During the ≈ånin war (1467‚Äì1477), all of the buildings in the complex aside from the pavilion were burned down. On 2 July 1950, at 2:30 am, the pavilion was burned down by a 22-year-old novice monk, Hayashi Yoken, who then attempted suicide on the Daimon-ji hill behind the building. He survived, and was subsequently taken into custody. The monk was sentenced to seven years in prison, but was released because of mental illnesses (persecution complex and schizophrenia) on 29 September 1955; he died of tuberculosis in March 1956. See: Herostratos syndrome During the fire, the original statue of Ashikaga Yoshimitsu was lost to the flames (now restored). A fictionalized version of these events is at the center of Yukio Mishima's 1956 book The Temple of the Golden Pavilion, and another in the ballet RAkU. The present pavilion structure dates from 1955, when it was rebuilt. The pavilion is three stories high, in height.Young, David, and Michiko Young. The art of Japanese Architecture. North Claredon, VT: Turtle Publishing, 2007. N. pag. Print. The reconstruction is said to be a copy close to the original, although some doubt such an extensive gold-leaf coating was used on the original structure. In 1984 the coating of Japanese lacquer was found to be a little decayed and a new coating, as well as gilding with gold-leaf, much thicker than the original coatings (0.5 ¬µm instead of 0.1 ¬µm), was completed in 1987. Additionally, the interior of the building, including the paintings and Yoshimitsu's statue, were also restored. Finally, the roof was restored in 2003. The name Kinkaku is derived from the gold leaf that the pavilion is covered in. Gold was an important addition to the pavilion because of its underlying meaning. The gold employed was intended to mitigate and purify any pollution or negative thoughts and feelings towards death.Gerhart, Karen M. The material culture of Death in medieval Japan. N.p.: University of Hawaii Press, 2009. N. pag. Print. Other than the symbolic meaning behind the gold leaf, the Muromachi period heavily relied on visual excesses. With the focus on the Golden Pavilion, the way that the structure is mainly covered in that material creates an impression that stands out because of the sunlight reflecting and the effect the reflection creates on the pond. Design details PhoenixthumbrightRoof ornament The is a three-story building on the grounds of the Rokuon-ji temple complex. The top two stories of the pavilion are covered with pure gold leaf. The pavilion functions as a shariden (ËàéÂà©ÊÆø), housing relics of the Buddha (Buddha's Ashes). The building was an important model for Ginkaku-ji (Silver Pavilion Temple) and Sh≈çkoku-ji, which are also located in Kyoto. When these buildings were constructed, Ashikaga Yoshimasa employed the styles used at Kinkaku-ji and even borrowed the names of its second and third floors. =Architectural design= The fishing deck and small islets at the rear of the pavilion The pavilion successfully incorporates three distinct styles of architecture, which are shinden, samurai and zen, specifically on each floor. Each floor of the Kinkaku uses a different architectural style. The first floor, called The Chamber of Dharma Waters (Ê≥ïÊ∞¥Èô¢, H≈ç-sui-in), is rendered in shinden-zukuri style, reminiscent of the residential style of the 11th century Heian imperial aristocracy. It is evocative of the Shinden palace style. It is designed as an open space with adjacent verandas and uses natural, unpainted wood and white plaster. This helps to emphasize the surrounding landscape. The walls and fenestration also affect the views from inside the pavilion. Most of the walls are made of shutters that can vary the amount of light and air into the pavilion and change the view by controlling the shutters' heights. The second floor, called The Tower of Sound Waves (ÊΩÆÈü≥Ê¥û, Ch≈ç-on-d≈ç ), is built in the style of warrior aristocrats, or buke-zukuri. On this floor, sliding wood doors and latticed windows create a feeling of impermanence. The second floor also contains a Buddha Hall and a shrine dedicated to the goddess of mercy, Kannon. The third floor is built in traditional Chinese ch√°n (Jpn. zen) style, also known as zensh≈´-butsuden-zukuri. It is called the Cupola of the Ultimate (Á©∂Á´üÈ†Ç, Kukky≈ç- ch≈ç). The zen typology depicts a more religious ambiance in the pavilion, as was popular during the Muromachi period. The roof is in a thatched pyramid with shingles.Young, David, Michiko Young, and Tan Hong. The material culture of Death in medieval Japan. North Claredon, VT: Turtle Publishing, 2005. N. pag. Print. The building is topped with a bronze h≈ç≈ç (phoenix) ornament. From the outside, viewers can see gold plating added to the upper stories of the pavilion. The gold leaf covering the upper stories hints at what is housed inside: the shrines. The outside is a reflection of the inside. The elements of nature, death, religion, are formed together to create this connection between the pavilion and outside intrusions. =Garden design= White Snake Pagoda of Kinkaku-ji The Golden Pavilion is set in a Japanese . The location implements the idea of borrowing of scenery (\\"shakkei\\") that integrates the outside and the inside, creating an extension of the views surrounding the pavilion and connecting it with the outside world. The pavilion extends over a pond, called , that reflects the building. The pond contains 10 smaller islands. The zen typology is seen through the rock composition; the bridges and plants are arranged in a specific way to represent famous places in Chinese and Japanese literature. Vantage points and focal points were established because of the strategic placement of the pavilion to view the gardens surrounding the pavilion. A small is attached to the rear of the pavilion building, allowing a small boat to be moored under it. The pavilion grounds were built according to descriptions of the Western Paradise of the Buddha Amida, intending to illustrate a harmony between heaven and earth. The largest islet in the pond represents the Japanese islands. The four stones forming a straight line in the pond near the pavilion are intended to represent sailboats anchored at night, bound for the Isle of Eternal Life in Chinese mythology. The garden complex is an excellent example of Muromachi period garden design.Eyewitness Travel Guides: Japan. Dorling Kindersley Publishing (2000). . The Muromachi period is considered to be a classical age of Japanese garden design.‚ÄúPregil, Philip, and Nancy Volkman. Landscapes in History: Design and Planning in the Eastern and Western tradition. Hoboken, NJ: John Wiley & Sons Inc., 1992. N. pag. Print.‚Äù. The correlation between buildings and its settings were greatly emphasized during this period. It was a way to integrate the structure within the landscape in an artistic way. The garden designs were characterized by a reduction in scale, a more central purpose and a distinct setting.Boults, Elizabeth, and Chip Sullivan. Illustrated History of Landscape Design. Hoboken, NJ: John Wiley & Sons INc., 2010. N. pag. Print. A minimalistic approach was brought to the garden design, by recreating larger landscapes in a smaller scale around a structure.

It is perhaps confusable with the Scottish smallpipe, although it is a quite different and much older instrument. Although most modern Border pipes are closely modelled on similar historic instruments, the modern Scottish smallpipes are a modern reinvention, inspired by historic instruments but largely based on Northumbrian smallpipes in their construction. The name, which is modern, refers to Scotland's border country, where the instrument was once common, so much so that many towns there used to maintain a piper. The instrument was found much more widely than this, however; it was noted as far north as Aberdeenshire, south of the Border in Northumbria and elsewhere in the north of England. Indeed, some late 17th-century paintings, such as a tavern scene by Egbert van Heemskerck, probably from south-eastern England, show musicians playing such instruments. Other names have been used for the instrument: Lowland pipes and reel pipes in Scotland, and half-long pipes in Northumbria. However, the term reel pipes historically refers to instruments similar to Highland pipes, but primarily intended for indoor use. While the instrument had been widespread in the 18th century, by the late 19th century it was no longer played. There was an attempt to revive it in North East England in the 1920s and sets were created for Newcastle Royal Grammar School, Durham University OTC and Northumberland Boy Scounts, the term half-long pipes is now used to refer specifically to surviving examples from this period,http://nms.scran.ac.uk/database/record.php?usi=000-000-579-670-C; these were in part modelled on an 18th century set which had belonged to Muckle Jock Milburn, and is now in the Morpeth Chantry Bagpipe Museum; however, they were given a different drone configuration.  Description  The instrument consists of a chanter which plays the melody, drones which play a constant unchanging harmony, a bag which holds the air to blow drones and chanter, and a set of bellows to supply air to the bag. An early photograph from Northumberland, c. 1859, shows the instrument well.Woodhorn Archive =Chanter= The instrument has a conical-bored chanter, in contrast to the cylindrically-bored Scottish smallpipe. The modern instruments are louder than the Scottish smallpipe, though not as loud as the Great Highland Bagpipe; they blend well with string instruments. The chanter has a thumb hole and seven finger-holes. The compass of the chanter is nine notes, from G to a, though a few higher notes, typically b, c',and c#', are obtainable on some chanters by 'pinching' and overblowing. As with the Highland pipes, the basic scale is a mixolydian scale on A. Some chanters can play chromatic notes however, and some old tunes, for instance Bold Wilkinson or Wat ye what I got late yestreen, suggest a dorian scale may also sometimes have been used, requiring a minor third instead of the major third of the mixolydian scale. This could be achieved by cross-fingering or half-holing. Pete Stewart has further argued\\"Out of the Flames\\", compiler Roderick D. Cannon, Lowland and Border Pipers'Society, 2004, . that the existence of some G major tunes with a nine- note compass from G to a suggests that Border pipes formerly sounded a c natural, rather than c sharp; cross-fingering would then have been needed to sound a c sharp. Some instruments are made in other pitches, typically B flat or G, rather than A. =Drones= The instrument has three cylindrically bored drones inserted into the pipebag by a common stock, typically tuned A, a, e', or A, a, a. In contrast, the Great Highland Bagpipe has each drone in a separate stock. The drone tuning A, e, a was used in half-long pipes in the early 20th century, and though still rare, sets are now beginning to be made with this drone tuning again. =Bag and bellows= The bag is not filled with breath from the player's mouth, but instead is supplied with dry air, from a set of bellows strapped under the player's right arm. This keeps the reeds drier, which helps keep the instrument in tune, as well as greatly extending the life of a reed.  Border pipe repertoire  There is a distinct body of music for the instrument ‚Äì many of these tunes survived in the fiddle and Northumbrian smallpipes repertoire after the playing of Border pipes died out in the mid-19th century. Others survive in manuscript sources from the 18th and 19th century. = Sources = Most notably, the William Dixon manuscript, dated 1733, from Stamfordham in Northumberland, was identified as Border pipe music by Matt Seattle in 1995, and published by him with extensive notes.The Master Piper ‚Äì Nine Notes That Shook the World, William Dixon (1733), 3rd edition, edited Matt Seattle 2011, . The book contains forty tunes, almost all with extensive variation sets. Some of these are limited to a single octave, and many of this group correspond closely to tunes for Northumbrian smallpipes known from early 19th-century sources ‚Äì \\"Apprentice Lads of Alnwick\\" is one of these; others are melodically and harmonically richer ‚Äì using the full nine- note compass and the G major subtonic chord ‚Äì a fine example of this group is Dorrington. Another very early, though limited, source is George Skene's manuscript fiddle book of 1715, from Aberdeenshire. Besides settings for fiddle, some playable on the pipes, it contains four pieces explicitly stated to be in bagpipe style, all variation sets on Lowland tunes. Another limited early 18th-century source, is Thomas Marsden's 1705 collection of Lancashire Hornpipes, for fiddle;John of the Green, the Cheshire Way, 2nd edition, John Offord 2008, one clear example of a pipe tune here is \\"Mr Preston's Hornpipe\\", with a characteristic nine-note compass. Significantly, this tune is in the Dorian mode on A, with C natural throughout, rather than the Mixolydian mode of the Dixon tunes. Several Border pipe tunes, including \\"The English Black and the Grey\\", \\"Bold Wilkinson\\" and \\"Galloping over the Cowhill\\", were copied in the 19th century by John Stokoe from the mid-18th century John Smith MS, from Northumberland, dated 1753. This manuscript was, from 1881, the property of Lewis Proudlock, who showed it to Stokoe, but it has since been lost. Some tunes in James Oswald's Caledonian Pocket Companion, also from the mid-18th century, ostensibly for flute or violin, are identifiable as Border pipe tunes. Another important source is the Vickers fiddle manuscript from Northumberland ‚Äì many tunes in this have the characteristic nine-note compass of pipe tunes. A later Scottish source, from the early 19th century, is Robert Riddell's Collection of Scotch, Galwegian and Border Tunes ‚Äì besides some tunes for fiddle and some for smallpipes, others, such as \\"Torphichen's Rant\\", clearly have the range and the idiom of Border pipe tunes. The smallpipe manuscript of Robert Bewick of Gateshead, besides many smallpipe tunes and transcribed fiddle tunes, contains several nine-note tunes, now identified as Border pipe music. Some of the smallpipe tunes in Peacock's book, from the early 19th century, are in the Lydian mode, with a tonic of c, but with one sharp in the key signature; these ‚Äì \\"Bobby Shaftoe\\" is one ‚Äì make more musical sense in the major mode with an f natural, viewed as adaptations from originals for Border pipes. The Peacock, John Smith and some of the Bewick tunes are reproduced in the FARNE archive. = Stylistic features = These tunes display several features distinguishing them from music for fiddle, Northumbrian pipes and Highland pipes. The nine- note modal scale, usually mixolydian, with a compass from the subtonic up to the high tonic, separates them clearly from most fiddle and smallpipe tunes. In particular, the interval of an augmented fourth, difficult on the fiddle, is much commoner in these tunes. The compass of fiddle tunes is generally wider, while the older smallpipe tunes have an eight-note range from the tonic up to an octave higher. One complication is the long tradition in Scotland of writing tunes to be played on the fiddle, but 'in bagpipe style', often with the strings retuned to imitate drones; 18th century examples of these can fit well on Border pipes, and may well have been intended as imitations of this instrument. Further, an important difference between the music of the Border pipes and of the Great Highland bagpipe is that many melodic figures in older Border pipe music typically move stepwise or in thirds rather than by wide intervals, and lack the multiple repeated notes found in many Highland pipe tunes. This suggests that in contrast to the Highland pipes, Border pipe music neither needed, nor greatly used, the complex graces which are so characteristic of Highland pipe music. The four specifically named pipe tunes from Skene's manuscript contain complex written-out gracings, and many more repeated notes than the Dixon tunes, so it is reasonable to conclude that playing styles in the 18th century varied from place to place. Modern attempts to reconstruct a musically valid playing style for Border music such as the Dixon tunes have been very successful, and several respected pipers play in such styles.[Matt Seattle Article on Border Piping] These are characterised by simple gracings, used sparingly, mostly either for rhythmic emphasis or to separate repeated notes.  Border pipes outside of Border music  The Border pipes have been taken up by many groups of pipers who were looking for a suitable instrument with which to play their music. This has not just been by musicians who play the music of the Scottish borders. For example, in Cape Breton and Nova Scotia, the instrument is used by highland pipers to play along with fiddles and other softer instruments. As the modern instrument is still fairly newly revived, ideas on playing styles are still evolving and naturally depend on the kind of music being played. Musical societies The Lowland and Border Pipers' Society was formed in 1982 and has played a large part in the revival of the instrument and its music. In the North East, the Northumbrian Pipers' Society has played a similar role for both Border pipes and Northumbrian smallpipes. The instrument is now once again widely played, and the original Border repertoire for the instrument, particularly the Dixon tunes, is becoming better known.

The word gaita is used across northern Spain as a generic term for \\"bagpipe\\", although in the south of Spain and Portugal it denotes a variety of horn, flute or oboe like instruments according to region. Suggestions as to the origin of the name gaita are many. It has been compared to the names of eastern European bagpipes, such as gaida, gajda, and gajdy. The linguist Joan Coromines has suggested that the word gaita most likely derived from a Gothic word gait or gata, meaning \\"goat\\"; as the bag of a gaita is made from a whole, case-skinned goat hide. Gothic was spoken in Hispania from the fifth century to the eighth century when the country was ruled by the Visigoths. The Visigoths originated in north-eastern Europe.  The instrument  Galician gaita made by Xos√© Manuel Seivane RivasThe Galician gaita has a conical chanter and a bass drone (ronco) with a second octave. It may have one or two additional drones playing the tonic and dominant notes. Three keys are traditional: D (gaita grileira, lit. \\"cricket bagpipe\\"), C (gaita redonda), and Bb (gaita tumbal). Galician pipe bands playing these instruments have become popular in recent years. The playing of close harmony (thirds and sixths) with two gaitas of the same key is a typical Galician gaita style. The bagpipe or gaita is known to have been popular in the Middle Ages, as early as the 9th century, but suffered a decline in popularity from the 16th century until a 19th-century revival. It saw another decline in the middle of the 20th century when the Francoist dictatorship tried to use it for propaganda purposes. Then, beginning in about the 1970s, a roots revival heralded another rebirth. The folk revival may have peaked in the late 1990s, with the release of acclaimed albums by Galician Carlos N√∫√±ez (A Irmandade Das Estrelas). The gaita began to gain popularity with the massive immigration of Galicians to the United States and Latin America. The foundations of Galician Centers (Centro Galego / Casa Galicia) in key cities and capitals, from New York City to Buenos Aires, Argentina. Traditional use include both solo performances or with a snare-drum known as tamboril (a wooden natural-skinned drum with gut snares), and the bombo, a bass drum. Galician bagpipes come in three main varieties, though there are exceptions and unique instruments. These include the tumbal (B-flat), grileira (D) and redonda (C). =Description= The player inflates the bag using his mouth through a tube fitted with a non- return valve. Air is driven into the chanter () with the left arm controlling the pressure inside the bag. The chanter has a double reed similar to a shawm or oboe, and a conical bore with seven finger-holes on the front. The bass drone (ronco or ronc√≥n) is situated on the player's left shoulder and is pitched two octaves below the key note of the chanter; it has a single reed. Some bagpipes have up to two more drones, including the ronquillo or ronquilla, which sticks out from the bag and plays an octave above the ronco, or the smaller chill√≥n. These two extra drones are located next to the right arm of the player. The finger-holes include three for the left hand and four for the right, as well as one at the back for the left thumb. The chanter's tonic is played with the top six holes and the thumb hole covered by fingers. Starting at the bottom and (in the Galician fingering pattern) progressively opening holes creates the diatonic scale. Using techniques like cross- fingering and half-holing, the chromatic scale can be created. With extra pressure on the bag, the reed can be played in a second octave, thus giving range of an octave and a half from tonic to top note. It is also possible to close the tone hole with the little finger of the right hand, thus creating a semitone below the tonic. =Songs= Tunes using the gaita are usually songs, with the voice either accompanying the instrumentation or taking turns with it. The most common type is the mui√±eira, a sprightly 6/8 rhythm. Other 6/8 Galician tunes use different steps; they include the carballesa, ribeirana, redonda, chouteira and contrapaso. Alborada, usually-instrumental tune, most often in 2/4, though sometimes 3/4, and is characterized by a series of descending turning phrases. It is used to begin a day's celebrations, and is played at sunrise. The foliada is a joyful 3/4 jota-type song, often played at romar√≠as (community gatherings at a local shrine).

Its capital is the city of Maasin. Southern Leyte comprised the third congressional district Leyte until it was made into an independent province in 1959. Southern Leyte includes Limasawa, an island to the south where the first Roman Catholic Mass in Philippine soil is believed to have taken place and thus considered to be the birthplace of Roman Catholicism in the Philippines. The province ranks as the second least populated in the region. According to the , the province has a population of . Southern Leyte's geological features created several issues in the province after the flooding of the Subangdaku River and the 2006 mudslide in Guinsaugon. Organizations warned the province it was susceptible to natural occurrences like landslides and floods.Policy and Advocacy  Haribon Southern Leyte forms an important part of the inter-island transportation system of the country, with ferries transporting people and goods between Liloan and Surigao del Norte in Mindanao. The province is well known for its quality abaca products and is the country's major producer of abaca fiber. In September 2017, Representative Roger Mercado authored House Bill 6408, proposing to change the name of the province to Leyte del Sur. History =Precolonial history= The province, being part of Leyte island, is believed to be influenced by Datu Ete, ruler of the historic community of Mairete, meaning Land of Ete, which was centered in Tacloban. The area which is to be Southern Leyte is believed to have been occupied by animist Visayan ethnic groups from Bohol. There is no proof that the indigenous animist Warays of Samar, who at the time occupied northeast Leyte, ever occupied Southern Leyte. =Early settlement= As early as 1898 during the Spanish and American periods, there existed a \\"sub-province\\" consisting of the municipalities from Palompon to Hinunangan, with Maasin as the center. Some government offices had already been established in Maasin on the southwestern part of Leyte to govern the area.Southern Leyte: Attractions Historically, the governing city was the depository of cedula tax collections from Palompon to Hinunangan. This was administered by the office of the Administrado de Hacienda, equivalent to the Provincial Treasurer, a position under the Secretario de Hacienda. There was also established in Maasin a Court of First Instance, then known as the Promoter Fiscal, where all minor administrative and other cases from Palompon to Hinunangan were heard. During the Spanish colonization, the province was sparsely populated. The continued raiding of Moro slaves discouraged the province from growing and developing. However, in the 19th century immigrants from adjacent provinces like Bohol and Cebu populated the area. In 1942, Ruperto Kangleon held a conference in the town of Sogod, when the first meeting attempt in Malitbog, a town to the east, failed due to many leaders staying away. He was trying to unify all guerrillas helping the Philippine Commonwealth troops during World War II. From 1944 to 1945, the Allied Philippine Commonwealth Army soldiers and Filipino guerrillas attacked the Japanese Imperial forces in an effort to liberate Southern Leyte, and American troops landed on Leyte on October 20, 1944. =Independent province= Due to a change of sovereign powers, all the offices in Maasin except the Fiscal's Office were abolished and reverted to Tacloban, the capital of Leyte. This created a major problem because of the dearth of transportation, the difficulty in managing the affairs of government in Tacloban and the language barrier between the Cebuano-speaking South- westerners and the Waray Easterners. The difficulty of managing the entire island from the main city suggested a need to separate the island into two provinces. At first there was a general movement for a Western Leyte and soon after, many prominent men and leaders rallied behind the movement. Six attempts to pass a law for the division of Leyte were made. On the sixth attempt, then Congressman Nicanor Y√±iguez introduced into the House a division law similar in substance to that of the Kangleon Bill, but recognizing the impossibility of creating an East-West Division, he instead opted to make his own district a province. Abandoning the first bill, Congressman Nicanor Y√±iguez presented House Bill No. 1318 proposing a new province of Southern Leyte comprising Third Congressional District of Leyte to include sixteen municipalities, from Maasin to Silago in the mainland, and in the Panaon Island. The bill became Republic Act 2227 otherwise known as an \\"Act Creating the Province of Southern Leyte\\" and was signed into Law by President Carlos P. Garcia on May 22, 1959. On July 1, 1960, Southern Leyte was inaugurated as a province with sixteen municipalities and Maasin as the capital town. Thus, the third District of Leyte became the Province of Southern Leyte and the Lone District of Southern Leyte. =Mudslides= In December 2003, a landslide in San Francisco, Southern Leyte destroyed most of the town, killing 200 people. 2006 Southern Leyte mudslide On February 17, 2006, several mudslides caused by heavy rains, amounting over , and a minor earthquake destroyed at least one town and many commercial and residential infrastructures, leaving hundreds dead. The municipality of Saint Bernard was one of the worst hit areas with 23 confirmed deaths, up to 200 estimated deaths and another 1,500 missing. Barangay Guinsaugon, a mountain village on the said municipality with 2,500 people, was almost completely destroyed, killing 1,800 of its 1,857 residents. Many rescuers from national and international responded to the incident. However, rescue efforts were greatly hampered by poor road conditions and lack of heavy equipment. Survivors reported also lack of coordination of rescue efforts. The few handful of Guinsaugon citizens which escaped the mudslide were put up in emergency shelters without adequate nutrition and care despite the National Government collecting millions of dollars worth of donations. Geography Southern Leyte occupies the southern quarter of the island of Leyte. It is bounded by the province of Leyte to the north, by Surigao Strait to the east, Bohol Sea to the south, and Canigao Channel, across from Bohol, to the west. Its total land area is . The central portion of the province is dominated by the Sogod Bay, a long bay that cuts deep into the island. =Topography= A view of Sogod Bay and the town of Sogod Southern Leyte is characterized by relatively flat lands along the coastal areas where population centers lie, but rugged mountains towards the interior. The province has inland water features. Based on national data, the province has altogether 93 rivers, including 18 major ones, namely the Amparo River in Macrohon, the Canturing River in Maasin City, the Das-ay and Pondol Rivers in Hinunangan, the Divisoria River in Bontoc, the Hitungao and Lawigan Rivers in Saint Bernard, the Maag River in Silago, and the Subangdaku River in Sogod which is the biggest of all. The province has an inland lake called Lake Danao located in the mountains of San Juan and Anahawan, towns in the eastern region. Green grass covering mountains in Maasin City Subangdaku, the province's largest river, created an issue over the area. It can be considered a braided river composed of several channels from near areas that divide and reunite forming an alluvial fan with a very wide floodplain. As such, the river usually became hazardous during typhoons after heavy rains. The river has overflowed, spilling its waters on the low-lying towns of Liloan and San Vicente and destroyed an ongoing flood control project worth millions of pesos. The river meanders along its course, ever changing its way over time.PIA Information Services ‚Äì Philippine Information Agency During the time it floods, it destroys every side of its course. In 2001, portions of the road and banks in Barangay San Miguel along the river were destroyed, including part of the Philippine National Road. Local officials blamed the rechannelization and uncontrolled quarrying of gravel and sand at the side of river as the cause of the flood. At a meeting on March 18, 2002, one of the representatives of a government agency alleged that the reason of the incidents of flood and other environmental problems in the river was due to the \\"Philippine Fault\\" which caused rocks to rumble down. However, the reason was contended because the fault is a geological feature and environmental problems in the province just occurred that time. Along with other mountain forms in the province, Mount Nacolod in Hinunangan town has the highest peak with an elevation of above sea level. Young volcanic rocks are discovered in the terrain areas, which cover the top of the southern mountain ranges of Mount Cabalian in the Pacific Area and Mount Nelangcapan in Panaon Area. Hinunangan Beach The province lies within the Philippine Fault System. The major fault lines traverse the municipalities of Sogod, Libagon, Saint Bernard and San Juan to Panaon Island. Based on Mines and Geosciences Bureau Region 8 data, these areas had experienced strong earthquakes in 1907 and 1948 with a magnitude of 6.9 and on July 5, 1984 with a 6.4 scale. The Mines and Geosciences Bureau warned that Southern Leyte's natural and geological features make it susceptible to landslides and floodings. The affiliated group stated that there are four contributory reasons: unusually heavy rains; numerous faults and badly broken rocks; steep slopes; and absence of effective vegetative cover. The province has numerous types of soil. Soil types within the Maasin Clay, Guimbalaon Clay, Himay-angan Clay, Bolinao Clay, Quingua Clay and Malitbog Clay series serve as raw materials for ceramics and pottery made by local residents. =Climate= Southern Leyte has two types of climate according to the Coronas Classification. These are Type II and Type IV. Type II is characterized by the absence of dry season with a very pronounced maximum rain period occurring from November to January. This type prevails in the eastern half of the province that includes the municipality of Sogod, Libagon, Liloan, San Francisco, Pintuyan, San Ricardo, Saint Bernard, San Juan, Anahawan, Hinundayan, Hinunangan and Silago. On the other hand, Type IV has a rainfall that is more or less evenly distributed throughout the year. This type prevails in the western part of the province that includes the City of Maasin and the municipalities of Macrohon, Padre Burgos, Limasawa, Malitbog, Tomas Oppus, Bontoc and little part of Sogod. In 2004, the province recorded a maximum temperature of and a minimum temperature of . In addition, mean minimum temperature was . The province has 163 rainy days per year and total rainfall of . =Vegetation and biodiversity= bluespotted stingray seen in the coasts of the province Inhabitants of the province plant rice, white corn, bananas, root crops, sugar cane, coconut and abac√°. They also plant various types of vegetables. A three-year project was established in Sogod Bay conducted by the Southern Leyte Coral Reef Conservation Project (SLCRCP) to surveyed coral reefs in the area. The undertaking was to provide local residents educational opportunities to have knowledge on protecting the province's biodiversity as well as to have a long-term sustainability. =Administrative divisions= Southern Leyte is subdivided into 18 municipalities and 1 city, all encompassed by a double legislative districts and further subdivided into 500 barangays. The province originally comprised 16 municipalities and 349 barangays, with four islands: Panaon Island, Limasawa Island, San Pedro Island and San Pablo Island. After the inauguration of the province, three more municipalities were subsequently created: San Ricardo from Pintuyan, Tomas Oppus from Malitbog and Limasawa from Padre Burgos. In 2000, Maasin was converted into a city as capital of Southern Leyte. The remaining component municipality classes ranges from 2nd to 5th level in the province. From 2nd class belongs Sogod municipality which is the center of trade, commerce and industry among municipalities within the Sogod Bay. Hinunangan, which holds the distinction as the \\"Rice Granary of the Province\\" for its vast plain land that is entirely planted with rice, Liloan, Malitbog, Saint Bernard, and Macrohon, are in the 4th level. The remaining municipalities‚ÄîAnahawan, Hinundayan, Libagon, Padre Burgos, Pintuyan, San Francisco, San Juan (formerly Cabalian), San Ricardo, Silago, Tomas Oppus and Limasawa, a component island to the south‚Äîare under 5th level. { class=\\"wikitable sortable\\" style=\\"table-layout:fixed;text- align:right;background-color:white;font-size:95%;border-collapse:collapse;\\" !

The 1980 national census recorded the province of Southern Leyte with a population of 296,294 from the historic record in 1903 of 72,369. In 1990, the population of the province increased to 321,940 which was caused by in-migration and increasing rate of birth over death. In 2000, population increased to 360,160 with a rate of 2.73 from the negative growth rate recorded in 1995 period with 317,565. The sudden decrease of the 1995 records was due to the late census in the province. While regular censuses were done in May where most of the students were at their respective places of residence, in 1995 the census on population was done in September where the students were out for schooling in nearby provinces. The decrease in population was also, theoretically, attributed to out-migration of the rural population to cities to seek better employment and livelihood opportunities. A corresponding increase on the number of households was also recorded at 72,894 households higher by 7,327 households over the 1995 figure. Southern Leyte ranked fifth in terms of population among the six provinces in Eastern Visayas with 9.98 percent of the 3.6 million persons of the region. On the contrary, it was the fastest-growing province in the region. At the national level, the province contributed 0.47 percent to the total population of the Philippines with 76.5 million. =Ethnicity= According to the 2000 census survey, of the total provincial population of 359,738, about were Bisaya, Boholano, Cebuano, Tagalogs, and Waray. In Panaon, an island situated in the southernmost part of the province, a certain aboriginal folk are found locally known as kongking or variously called mamanwa which means \\"mountain people\\". They were believed to be migrants from Mindanao, inhabiting the portions of Agusan, after their migration from the island to evade militarization and the logging/mining corporations‚Äô intrusion to their ancestral domains in the early 1980s. They have a dark complexion and curly hair, and they are short in stature. Hunting and gathering, mat weaving and rattan craft are among the main economic activities of the Mamanwas, so they prefer to inhabit the forested areas in the newfound Southern Leyte mountains. However, they were again displaced by the recent landslides in the province. =Language= The native language is a Boholano dialect variant of Cebuano. Waray is seldom spoken (concentrated in some barrios near Waray speaking towns such as Abuyog and Mahaplag), while Tagalog (Filipino) and English are used as second languages. Kinabalian, a type of \\"rare, unique language\\", is spoken alongside Cebuano in the towns of San Juan and Anahawan. =Religion= Our Lady of Assumption Cathedral in Maasin City Limasawa, an island municipality to the south, is believed to be the site of the first Christian mass in Philippine soil and the birthplace of Christianity in the Philippines, when Ferdinand Magellan, a Portuguese navigator and explorer landed on March 28, 1521. The first Holy Sacrifice of the Mass was held on March 31, 1521 led by Friar Pedro de Valderrama, the chaplain of Ferdinand Magellan during the expedition. The mass marked the start of Christian propagation. Culture =Beliefs= Although most people are Christians, a very few who live in remote villages of the province hold on to pre-Hispanic influences and make offerings and sacrifices before planting their crops. Farmers ritually sacrifice chickens and pigs to ensure that the spirits or elementals which they believe to be the cause of good harvest will grant them one. =Religious events= Fiesta, a Spanish term meaning \\"festivity\\", is celebrated in the province with prayer, food, drinking, dance and music. Every barangay of every town in the province has its own celebration date. For instance, Hinunangan celebrates a town fiesta on the 29 June with the Saint Peter and Saint Paul Fluvial boat parade the day before. The kuratsa ‚Äì a courtship dance-drama ‚Äì highlights every occasion. The province also holds its own festivals. \\"Sinulog sa malitbog\\" is an annual religious street pageant in Malitbog to pay homage to the Holy Child Jesus (Santo Ni√±o), the town's patron saint. Similarly, the historic and religious coming of the Spaniards is commemorated every 31 March in Limasawa with a cultural presentation and anniversary program dubbed \\"Sinugdan\\", meaning \\"beginning.\\" Other festivals held in the province to highlight events are the Pagkamugna Festival and Pabulhon Festival in Maasin City, Karomata Festival in Beunavista, Pintuyan, Tangka-tangka Festival in Tangkaan, Padre Burgos and Manhaon Festival in Macrohon. Economy =Farming= Coconut Most of the people in Southern Leyte go into coconut planting, a widely distributed industry, especially in mountainous and even plain regions. The GIZ of the German Development Cooperation has embarked on a value chain study on one of the most important products in Region 8 ‚Äì the coconut, particularly in Leyte and Southern Leyte. In the year 2004, a beetle pest threatened the Philippine coconut industry including Visayas. Brontispa longissima causes great damage to seedlings and mature coconut trees and ornamental palms, killing the young spears and eventually the entire trees. Abaca People in Southern Leyte also go into abaca planting. The province is one of the major producer of abaca fiber in the country along with Catanduanes, Leyte, Davao Oriental, Northern Samar, Sorsogon, Sulu, Davao del Sur, and Surigao del Sur. The fibers from Leyte and the province are recognized as having the best quality. On the year 1990 to 1999, Southern Leyte produced abaca with a rate of 17 percent. In 2003, Abaca bunchy top virus threatened the abaca industry in the province. Almost all of the abaca-producing municipalities in the area namely Maasin City, Padre Burgos, Malitbog, Tomas Oppus, Bontoc, Sogod, St. Bernard, San Juan, Hinunangan and Silago were greatly affected by the deadly virus except from the municipalities at Panaon Island. Eighty percent of the province's abaca, particularly in Sogod town, was greatly affected while Maasin City was estimated to suffer about 30 percent in damages. =Tourism= Some 200,000 tourists visit Southern Leyte each year. Domestic tourism is mostly those wishing to enjoy the sandy beaches, hotels and resorts along the coastline. Significant numbers also visit for religious festivals such as Sinulog and Limasawa Most international travellers visit Southern Leyte for reef diving and snorkeling, from just outside Maasin City, all the way around Sogod Bay via Padre Burgos. There are also an increasing number of non-divers who come to see the Whale Sharks between October and April. In recent years there has been a drive to promote tourism in the region. There is a new Zoo and Wildlife Park in Barangay Danao in Maasin City. Not far from Sogod is a zip line over the tallest bridge in the Philippines. With this increase in numbers, there are a selection of new hotels along the coast.

Women in the selected areas go into abaca-based handicrafts, which is widely known in the area as tagak or spooled abaca fiber. Natives usually called it as tinagak or continuous spooled abaca fiber. The half-finished product is then made into sinamay or hand woven clothe out of tinagak ready to be made into other sinamaybased products. Products are being exported by Leyte to Japan. Because of a wide distribution of an industry called tagak, provincial sectors taught farmers on how to cultivate a suitable variety locally called laylay. In Bontoc, a project was successfully established with a mudcrab hatchery with eleven hatchery tanks at the RKKMAFTI Compound. Initially, 25 spawners are being worked-on by the project. Aside from abaca-based products, ceramics and handicraft items made from coconut and bamboo are also the province's industry. Among the province's economic activities are fishing, livestock and poultry raising. Generally, rice is the staple food of the province, and corn is also used. Mountainliving folks, however, prefer root crops, which are abundant. Native delicacies of the province include tres marias, bocarillo, 'salvaro, bibingka, and starhoy. They also have their own kinilaw. =Communication= Postal communication is the main mode of communication in the province. There are five telephone exchange companies operating in the province and two radio stations. These two radio stations (Radio Natin and DYSL) are located in Sogod. =Transportation= The road network of Southern Leyte consists of major arterial highways that link the province to Leyte, passing through two major outlets. On the western part is the and the central part by the MahaplagSogod road via the Maharlika Highway. On the eastern part of the province, the opening of the new AbuyogSilago Roads provides fast and convenient travel to the eastern towns of Southern Leyte. Maharlika road contributes to the development of the province. There are six designated bus terminals in Southern Leyte: Maasin, Liloan, Sogod, San Juan, Hinunangan and Silago. However, these terminals are open spaces used by buses as parking areas and are therefore not equipped with buildings and other facilities. The province has only one existing airport that is located in Pananawan in Maasin. Southern Leyte has a total of 11 seaports, two of which are declared as national ports, the Maasin and Liloan ports, and the 10 are municipal ports. Of these 10 ports, five are operational: Maasin, Liloan, Saint Bernard, San Juan and Sogod. By sea, travel to Cebu from Maasin port takes an average of six hours and a maximum of two hours. A ferryboat from Liloan to Surigao takes three hours. Southern Leyte has one existing airport, Panan-awan Airport located in Maasin City. At present, however, the airport does not service any commercial flight. It has no terminal and can only accommodate aircraft for general aviation weighing and below at daytime. It is considered a feeder airport with a total runway length of and width of .

The games follow a combat team of anthropomorphic animals called Star Fox, led by chief protagonist Fox McCloud. Gameplay involves adventures around the Lylat planetary system in the futuristic \\"Arwing\\" fighter aircraft, in other vehicles and on foot. The original Star Fox (1993) was a forward-scrolling 3D rail shooter, though later titles added more directional freedom. The first game in the series, developed by Nintendo EAD and programmed by Argonaut Software, used the Super FX Chip to create the first accelerated 3D gaming experience on a home console. The Super FX Chip was an additional math co- processor that was built into the cartridge and helped the Super NES better render the game's graphics. The Super FX Chip has been used in other Super NES games as well, some with increased processing speed. Its reboot, Star Fox 64, further revolutionized the video game industry by being the first Nintendo 64 game to feature the Rumble Pak. Due to perceived issues with the German company StarVox, Star Fox and Star Fox 64 were released in PAL region territories as Starwing and Lylat Wars respectively. However, as of Star Fox Adventures, Nintendo went back on this decision so future games could be released worldwide with the same name. Games =Main series= Star Fox The first game, Star Fox, known as Starwing in Europe and Australia, was released for the Super Nintendo Entertainment System in 1993. Developed by Nintendo EAD and programmed by Argonaut Software, it used the Super FX chip to simulate 3D graphics during a period of predominately 2D games. Fox McCloud and his team, Slippy Toad, Peppy Hare, and Falco Lombardi, take on Andross, who threatens to overthrow the Lylat system. The game's concept was inspired by a shrine to the fox deity Inari ≈åkami, which Shigeru Miyamoto visited regularly. The shrine was accessible through a series of arches, influencing the gameplay.Equinox ‚Äì Serious Fun (AKA 'Video Games') (1993) Channel 4. http://ftvdb.bfi.org.uk/sift/title/500185?view=credit Several boss battles from the game are included as mini-games in the Wii title WarioWare: Smooth Moves, using the Wii Remote to fly the ship. Star Fox 64 Star Fox 64, known as Lylat Wars in Europe and Australia, introduced fully spoken dialogue, fully three-dimensional graphics, and new vehicles and characters. The game was released in 1997 for the Nintendo 64 and came bundled with the Rumble Pak, a force feedback attachment. Star Fox 64 retells the main story of the original Star Fox canon,Nintendo Power: Why did you make Star Fox 64 a remake of the original Star Fox? (an interview between Nintendo Power and Shigeru Miyamoto exclusive to the Star Fox 64 Player's Guide) with new characters and gameplay elements. New multiplayer modes include: free-for-all, battle royale and a time trial. The overall plot is expanded with relatively small core changes. This game is also famous for the quotes: \\"Do a barrel roll!\\" \\"Try a somersault!\\" and \\"Use bombs wisely\\" all of which are said by Peppy Hare and \\"Can't let you do that, Star Fox!\\" said by Wolf O'Donnell which has become a popular internet phenomenon. It also has a number of Star Wars references: \\"I have a bad feeling about this.\\" and \\"I'm here to rescue you!\\" among them. =Star Fox 64 3D= Star Fox 64 3D is a remake of Star Fox 64 for the Nintendo 3DS, released in 2011, being the second Star Fox title on a handheld console. Its existence debuted in a conceptual trailer for the Nintendo 3DS revealed at E3 2010, when objects from the Nintendo universe flew out of the 3DS screen. One of the many objects was a flying Arwing, hinting the next Star Fox game. The game was officially announced later on. Screenshots, footage, and some information were revealed over the then-upcoming Star Fox 64 3D game at 3DS conferences on 29 September 2010, and 19 January 2011. With a few exceptions, the gameplay in Star Fox 64 3D is very similar to that of the original version. The player controls Fox's Arwing fighter using the circle pad to steer, the shoulder buttons to bank left and right, and the four right- hand buttons to fire lasers and bombs, boost and brake. The D-Pad allows the player to perform somersaults and u-turns, which can also be performed with combinations of other controls, and to zoom in and out from the Arwing in \\"All-Range Mode\\". The player can also enable \\"Gyro Controls\\", using the 3DS' internal gyroscope sensor to control the Arwing. Character dialogue, messages and control information are displayed on the touch screen. Star Fox 64 3D also features a new multiplayer \\"Battle Mode\\", which allows players to play up to 4-player LAN multiplayer (via Download Play), or to battle against CPU opponents. During battles, each player's face appears on opponents' screens in a live reaction feed from the console's internal camera. Star Fox Adventures Star Fox Adventures, was released in 2002 for GameCube. Developed by Rare, the game is predominately an action-adventure game in which Fox is armed with a mystical staff; traditional space shooting is limited to small segments between chapters. Its roots can be traced to Dinosaur Planet, a game Rare was developing late in the life cycle of the Nintendo 64, but cancelled at the behest of Nintendo and converted into a Star Fox game. Adventures introduced new characters, including, most notably, Prince Tricky and Krystal. Taking place eight years after the events of Star Fox 64, the main antagonist is an army of dinosaurs called the Sharp Claws, led by General Scales. Fox and Krystal fall in love soon before the final boss fight when Fox saves her life. Krystal then becomes the Star Fox team's newest member. The gameplay of Adventures resembles that seen in most 3D The Legend of Zelda games. Star Fox: Assault Developed by Namco, Star Fox: Assault was released in 2004 and 2005 for the GameCube. The emphasis returned to Arwing- based gameplay, but also had portions of on-foot missions. Assault takes place one year after Adventures, with the Aparoids becoming a new threat to the Lylat system. The Star Fox team is tasked with stopping them. Along with ROB, Peppy now pilots the Great Fox, while Krystal replaces Peppy's role as one of the team's pilots. Star Fox Command Star Fox Command was developed by Q-Games for the Nintendo DS, and was released in 2006. It is the first Star Fox game for a handheld console and the first to offer online multiplayer. Like the original Star Fox, gameplay is completely aircraft-based, and uses chatter much like the SNES game instead of the voice acting of later installments. Command utilizes a new system of gameplay, incorporating strategy and abandoning its \\"fly-by-rail\\" roots. Players plot flight paths and engage enemies in an open arena-style flying mode using the Nintendo DS's touch screen. Each character has a unique ship with different abilities. For example, Slippy's ship has no lock-on feature and shorter boosts, but has stronger lasers and shielding; Fox McCloud pilots the redesigned Arwing II. Command takes place two to three years after the events of Star Fox: Assault and features nine endings, determined by the player's story progression choices. None of these endings are currently considered to affect the storyline of the series as a whole. Star Fox Zero Star Fox Zero was developed by Nintendo and PlatinumGames for the Wii U and released in April 2016. The first Star Fox game on a home game console in over 10 years, the game is controlled using the Wii U GamePad's gyroscope feature. Star Fox Zero also came packaged with a retail version of Star Fox Guard, a tower defense spin-off game. Star Fox 2 Star Fox 2 was originally cancelled even though it was completely finished. Many of its new ideas were implemented for the then-forthcoming Star Fox 64, such as the rival team Star Wolf, all-range mode, charge shot, and a multiplayer mode (though Star Fox 2s multiplayer mode was no longer featured in the final beta). Other elements such as choosing characters, map pointing, and multiple ship variations were later implemented in Star Fox Command. A beta version of the Landmaster tank (the Walker) also makes an appearance as an Arwing with leglike attachments. A patch for the final beta was released by a third-party team of hackers to make the game complete, removing the debug mode menus, making an English translation, and removing subroutines for a buggy third vehicle not used in the game. The game was officially released as part of the Super NES Classic Edition. =Canceled games= Star Fox (Virtual Boy) This game was a tech demo of what would have been a Star Fox game had the Virtual Boy adopted the series. The closest game to it is Red Alarm. Cinematic camera angles were a key element, as they are in Star Fox 2. At both E3 1995 and at the Winter Consumer Electronics Show 1995, the demo showed an Arwing doing various spins and motions. One observer called it \\"An intriguing technical demo featuring a Star Fox-like spacecraft doing a lot of spinning and zooming in 3D. It is made of filled polygons and looks much better than the unfilled Red Alarm vehicles.\\" Attendees to these two events were given 3D glasses to watch the demos and tech videos that were played on screens at the show floors, and from these videos. Star Fox (arcade) Originally planned as a companion game for Star Fox: Assault, it was abandoned and never released. It was supposed to be released in 2004‚Äì2005, but was not for reasons unknown. Star Fox Warriors In early 2016, Koei Tecmo pitched a Warriors game with Star Fox characters and themes. This never got past the design stage. =Spin-off games= Star Fox (Nelsonic Game Watch) Shortly after the release of the first Star Fox game, in June 1993, Nintendo teamed up with Kellogg's and Nelsonic to develop and release a promotional LCD-based Star Fox Game Watch to those who bought a box of Corn Flakes and sent the order form to Kellogg's to receive the Star Fox game watch for free. In the game watch, there are four levels and the object is to fly towards the Attack Carrier and destroy it while dodging plasma balls and falling structures. The game watch also included a pair of earphones and a headphone jack for listening to the game without disturbing anyone nearby due to the game watch missing a volume control. Nelsonic later released it in stores in a different watch appearance. Star Fox Guard Star Fox Guard was first shown at E3 2014 under the name of Project Guard, and was announced under a final name in a March 2016 Nintendo Direct. Guard was released for the Wii U in April 2016, coinciding with the release of Star Fox Zero. Developed by Nintendo and PlatinumGames, Guard is a tower defense game where the objective is to switch between different views on security cameras and protect the player's base by shooting enemy robots. A physical version of the game came bundled alongside the physical version of Star Fox Zero, and is also available separately as a digital download on the Wii U eShop. =Related games= Super Smash Bros. series Various Star Fox characters and elements have appeared in the Super Smash Bros. franchise of fighting games. Fox McCloud has appeared in all five as a playable character, while Falco Lombardi was featured in all titles since Super Smash Bros. Melee as an unlockable character. Wolf O'Donnell appears as an unlockable fighter in Super Smash Bros. Brawl and Super Smash Bros. Ultimate as well. All three characters have virtually the same Final Smash in Brawl in which each calls down a Landmaster to run over and shoot enemies with, with minor differences between each; this was changed to an Arwing or Wolfen strike in Ultimate. They also share similar moves, like the Blaster, Reflector, Fox Illusion/Falco Phantasm/Wolf Flash, and Fire Fox/Fire Bird/Fire Wolf. Peppy Hare and Slippy Toad make brief cameos in Melee and Brawl, with Krystal, Leon Powalski and Panther Caroso appearing alongside them in the latter. All five released entries in the series feature Star Fox related stages: Sector Z, Corneria, Venom, Lylat Cruise and Orbital Gate Assault. Sector Z (N64) and Corneria (Melee, Brawl, 3DS and Ultimate) are played atop the length of the mothership \\"Great Fox\\". Venom is played along the width of the \\"Great Fox\\", with the fighters doing battle atop the wings. In Super Smash Bros. Brawl, the Corneria stage from Melee returns, as well as a new stage called \\"Lylat Cruise\\" which is set atop an all-new ship known as the \\"Pleiades\\" that warps between various areas within the Lylat system. In Super Smash Bros. for Nintendo 3DS and Wii U, three Star Fox stages appear between both versions, with the Corneria stage from Melee returning once more for the 3DS version, while the Wii U version features the return of the Lylat Cruise stage from Brawl and a new stage based on the Orbital Gate Assault mission from Star Fox Assault. Super Smash Bros. Ultimate features the return of the Corneria, Venom, and Lylat Cruise stages. Andross also appears in his form from the original Star Fox as an assist trophy, sucking in air and then spewing projectiles at combatants, Krystal similarly appears as an assist trophy in Ultimate, using her staff to attack opponents. The item \\"Smart Bomb\\" is also featured. When used, it creates an explosion that slowly grows; however, sometimes the Smart Bomb is a dud and has a delayed explosion. WarioWare series In WarioWare: Smooth Moves for Wii, there is a Star Fox minigame in the style of the SNES title with three stages. Using the Wii Remote, the player pilots the Arwing through Corneria, Sector X, and Titania. At the end of each level, the player fights R.O.B. (not ROB 64 from the Star Fox series, but rather the R.O.B. attachment for the NES), who is armed with a large NES Zapper. In WarioWare Gold for Nintendo 3DS, another SNES-styled Star Fox microgame appears, this time challenging players to not crash into anything when their ship is on the verge of being destroyed. Super Mario Maker Fox, Falco, Peppy, and Slippy, along with the Arwing Walker from Star Fox Zero, appear as Mystery Mushroom costumes in Super Mario Maker. Starlink: Battle for Atlas The Nintendo Switch version of Ubisoft's action-adventure game Starlink: Battle for Atlas features exclusive missions featuring Star Fox characters and ships. As part of the game's toys-to-life features, the Nintendo Switch starter pack includes figures of Fox McCloud and his Arwing that can be used in-game. Other media =Nintendo Power comics= A monthly Star Fox comic strip, illustrated by , was printed in issues 45 to 55 of Nintendo Power in 1993. It is an adaptation of the events of the original Star Fox, with some exclusive characters not seen in any of the games to date. One such character is Fara Phoenix, a vixen who becomes the fifth member of Star Fox after they saved her from Venomian forces, who forms a close relationship with Fox. The story follows the Star Fox team as they went from outlaws on Papetoon, to an elite Arwing fighter squadron. Fox, Falco, and Andross were the only 3 characters whose backgrounds were fully explained in the story. A sequel set after the events of the game was produced in Nintendo Power by the same team which continued the story, featuring Andross's DNA being split between two clones. The clones then begin an invasion of the Lylat system, laying waste to everything in their path. The Star Fox team springs back into action, while Fara‚Äî dressed in clothing once worn by Fox's deceased mother, as the team had been enjoying some down time when the invasion begins‚Äî manages to provide an accidental, yet significant, distraction to one of the Andross clones when he spots her on a monitor due to a revelation that the original Andross was in love with Fox's mother and accidentally murdered her with a bomb intended for Fox's father, which the clone says over a loudspeaker, as the clone believes he is speaking to the deceased vixen, rather than Fara. Enraged by this new knowledge, Fox battles his way through the forces of Andross's clones, one of whom slays the other as he considers the feelings of the one who believes Fara to be Fox's mother is a weakness that is unneeded, and destroys the survivor. The story ends with the Lylat system celebrating the ultimate defeat of Andross as what remains of his forces flee from the forces of Corneria and the surviving fighters of the other worlds in the system. =Lylat Wars Comic= The official Club Nintendo magazine in Germany released a Star Fox 64 comic drawn manga-style to retell the game's storyline. The comic shows some scenes that were not present in the game‚Äîfor instance, Wolf kicking Andrew and Pigma out of Star Wolf because they acted against his orders (and thus saving Star Fox from the plot of the two). The comic ends with a robotic Andross being defeated. =Japanese comics= A one-issue Star Fox comic by Kazumi Sakamoto (ÂùÇÊú¨„Åã„Åö„Åø) was printed in the Comic Bonbon 1993 Spring Vacation Jumbo Edition (Êò•‰ºë„Åø„Ç∏„É£„É≥„ÉúÂ¢óÂàäÂè∑), published in April of that month.Comic Bonbon. 1993 Spring Vacation Jumbo Edition (Êò•‰ºë„Åø„Ç∏„É£„É≥„ÉúÂ¢óÂàäÂè∑).

The manga was released on the official Star Fox Adventures Japanese website, and it chronicles the events between Star Fox 64 and Star Fox Adventures. It gives the backstory as to why Falco left the Star Fox team. It also introduces a new antagonist, Captain Shears. Captain Shears runs a base on the sand-dune planet Titania, but unbeknownst to Star Fox, Shears is actually taking part in an experiment to resurrect Andross. In the beginning, Katt Monroe returns from Star Fox 64 along with a rag-tag team of roughnecks with apparently an inside lead on the fact that Shears is evil. Fox doesn't believe them, which ends up in a sparring match between him and Falco, thus adding more emphasis into Falco's intentions of leaving Star Fox. Eventually, it is revealed to Star Fox that Shears is indeed evil, and Fox storms in to stop the resurrection plan once and for all. The manga ends with the Star Fox team seeing Dinosaur Planet broken apart and deciding it is worth checking out. Star Fox Adventures opens with General Pepper ordering them to go there and save it, stating that their payment has been approved if they succeed. =Star Fox Zero ‚Äì The Battle Begins= A 14-minute web video of Star Fox Zero produced by Shigeru Miyamoto, Production IG, and Wit Studio, features the Star Fox team in an anime-styled battle of the first level in Star Fox Zero: Corneria. The short was later released via the Wii U eShop as part of the Star Fox Zero: The Battle Begins + Training demo. =Film adaptation= On January 13, 2020, Rogue One screenwriter Gary Whitta said that he'd like to write an animated movie based on video game series. Inspired by a drip of Star Fox fan art coming from God of War art director Raf Grassetti, Whitta retweeted an image of Grassetti's art and expressed his desire to turn it into an animated movie by saying, \\"I wanted to write an animated film\\". Recurring elements =Arwing= Arwing is the principal craft of the Star Fox team, and has appeared in all Star Fox games to date. The Arwing has had considerable changes, though all versions of it retain a basic shape: a central fuselage, two crested streamlined pods attached at the sides, known as Gravity Diffusers, or G Diffusers, and wings mounted on the side pods. From Star Fox 64 onwards, the two side pods are a distinctive blue color. The Arwings make an appearance in the Super Smash Bros. series, in Super Smash Bros. Melee and Brawl, they appear as trophies. In this series, Arwings are used by Fox and Falco as their on-screen introduction, in addition to being used as a stage obstacle on Fox's Level, Sector Z. The Arwings on this stage would occasionally fly through and shoot lasers at the players. In the Corneria, Venom, and Lylat Cruise stages they are seen flying in the background. The Arwing is also an easter egg in The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time but can only be accessed by a gameshark code. It appears in Kokiri forest as an enemy who can be defeated by Link with either a boomerang, fairy bow, or fairy slingshot. Once defeated, they fall to the ground, explode and its blast may inadvertently kill Link. The Arwing also appears as a piece of furniture in Animal Crossing: Wild World and Animal Crossing: City Folk. When touched by the game character, the Arwing will briefly play the Star Fox theme music. It also appears over a box in Super Mario RPG, Hinopio's Market, but it's just a decor. In Bayonetta 2, miniature Arwings replace Bayonetta's guns when she is wearing the game's unlockable Star Fox costume. In addition, the plane in the final level is also replaced with an Arwing. Miyamoto explains that the craft is called Arwing \\"because it was like one big wing shaped like an A.\\" =Landmaster= The Landmaster M1 tank first appeared in Star Fox 64 (1997, Nintendo 64) as a tracked light tank in two of the game's missions and one of the game's multiplayer maps. It appeared again in Star Fox: Assault (2005, GameCube), though with some changes, including the substitution of tank treads with tires. The Assault version of the Landmaster also handled somewhat differently and was used for all-range style combat rather than the on-rails type of missions featured in Star Fox 64. The Landmaster tank makes its most recent appearance in Super Smash Bros. Brawl (2008, Wii) as Fox's Final Smash. The same design ‚Äì in alternate color schemes ‚Äì is also used as the Final Smash for Falco Lombardi and Wolf O'Donnell. All three Landmasters have slightly different properties. The Landmaster that Fox and Falco use is the traditional white and blue color scheme, while Wolf's Landmaster is a black and red color scheme. Falco's Landmaster can fly higher and longer than Fox's but its firepower has reduced knockback. In addition, Wolf's Landmaster has greater firepower and knockback ability than the one Fox and Falco use, but it remains on the stage for a much shorter time. Other than a shared name, Nintendo's Landmaster tank is unrelated to the Landmaster vehicle from the film Damnation Alley. =Wolfen= The Wolfen is piloted by Wolf O'Donnell. This ship would have first appeared in Star Fox 2, but was instead first seen in Star Fox 64 on the planet Fichina (mistranslated as Fortuna in Star Fox 64, Fixed in 64 3D) ‚Äì or alternatively ‚Äì Bolse. Additionally, taking the hard path to Venom enables the player to battle the Wolfen II, which outperforms the Arwing. In Star Fox: Assault, Team Star Wolf piloted the original versions of the Wolfen against the Star Fox team, and they are playable in the game's multiplayer mode. The Wolfen has also appeared in Super Smash Bros. Melee and Brawl as interactive elements of the Corneria, Venom, and Lylat Cruise stages. They can also be found in the original Super Smash Bros. on the Sector Z stage, seen flying in the background. Reception The Star Fox series has seen mostly positive reviews, the most acclaimed being Star Fox 64, while Star Fox Zero received the most mixed reviews. Star Fox took the No. 115 spot on EGM's \\"The Greatest 200 Videogames of Their Time\\", and 82nd best game made on a Nintendo System in Nintendo Powers Top 200 Games list. It also received a 34 out of 40 from Famitsu magazine, and a 4.125 out of 5 from Nintendo Power Magazine. Next Gen Magazine pointed out Star Fox as helping pioneer the use of 3-D video game graphics. The game has been used as an example of how, even with a fully polygon design, the game was still very similar to older games in that there was a set path to travel through each level. As Star Fox Adventures took a different approach to the franchise, many fans complained it was too much like a role-playing adventure game, such as The Legend of Zelda. Regardless, it was critically praised. In an IGN poll for voting from a list of ten Nintendo characters for favorite Nintendo character of all time, Fox came in fourth, behind Link, Mario, and Samus respectively. In October 2009, Shigeru Miyamoto said that he felt disappointed that sales of the Star Fox series in Japan had decreased during the preceding period.Frushtick, Russ. \\"Mario Creator Talks Disappointment With 'Star Fox'.\\" MTV. 27 October 2009.

A large part of the Julian Alps is included in Triglav National Park. The second highest peak of the range, the 2,755 m high J√¥f di Montasio, lies in Italy. https://www.britannica.com/place/Julian-Alps The Julian Alps cover an estimated 4,400 km2 (of which 1,542 km2 lies in Italy). They are located between the Sava Valley and Canale Valley. They are divided into the Eastern and Western Julian Alps. Name The Julian Alps were known in antiquity as Alpe Iulia, and also attested as Alpes Juliana AD 670, Alpis Julia 734, and Alpes Iulias in 1090. Like the municipium of Forum Julii (now Cividale del Friuli) at the foot of the mountains, the range was named after Julius Caesar of the Julian clan, perhaps due to a road built by Julius Caesar and completed by Augustus. Eastern Julian Alps Triglav from Debela Peƒç There are many peaks in the Eastern Julian Alps over 2,000 m high, and they are mainly parts of ridges.

He was a member of the P≈ôemyslid dynasty. Early years Ottokar's parents were Vladislaus II, Duke of Bohemia, and Judith of Thuringia. His early years were passed amid the anarchy that prevailed everywhere in the country. After several military struggles, he was recognized as ruler of Bohemia by Holy Roman Emperor Henry VI in 1192. He was, however, soon overthrown for joining a conspiracy of German princes to bring down the Hohenstaufen dynasty. In 1197, Ottokar forced his brother, Duke Vladislaus III Henry, to abandon Bohemia to him and to content himself with Moravia. Taking advantage of the civil war in Germany between the Hohenstaufen claimant Philip of Swabia and the Welf candidate Otto IV, Ottokar declared himself King of Bohemia in 1198, being crowned in Mainz. This title was supported by Philip of Swabia, who needed Czech military support against Otto. In 1199, Ottokar divorced his wife Adelheid of Meissen, a member of the Wettin dynasty, to marry Constance of Hungary, the young daughter of Hungarian King B√©la III. In 1200, with Otto IV in the ascendancy, Ottokar abandoned his pact with Philip of Swabia and declared for the Welf faction. Otto IV and later Pope Innocent III subsequently accepted Ottokar as the hereditary King of Bohemia. Golden Bull of Sicily Ottokar was quickly forced back into Philip's camp by the imperial declaration of a new duke of Bohemia, Dƒõpolt III. Subject to his recognition as duke, Ottokar had to allow his divorced wife to return to Bohemia. Having been completed this condition, he again ranged himself among Philip's partisans and still later was among the supporters of the young King Frederick II. In 1212 Frederick granted the Golden Bull of Sicily to Bohemia. This document recognised Ottokar and his heirs as Kings of Bohemia. The king was no longer subject to appointment by the emperor and was only required to attend Diets close to the Bohemian border. Although a subject of the Holy Roman Empire, the Bohemian king was to be the leading electoral prince of the Holy Roman Empire and to furnish all subsequent emperors with a bodyguard of 300 knights when they went to Rome for their coronation. Ottokar's reign was also notable for the start of German immigration into Bohemia and the growth of towns in what had until that point been forest lands. In 1226, Ottokar went to war against Duke Leopold VI of Austria after the latter wrecked a deal that would have seen Ottokar's daughter (Saint Agnes of Bohemia) married to Frederick II's son Henry II of Sicily. Ottokar then planned for the same daughter to marry Henry III of England, but this was vetoed by the emperor, who knew Henry to be an opponent of the Hohenstaufen dynasty. The widowed emperor himself wanted to marry Agnes, but by then she did not want to play a role in an arranged marriage. With the help of the pope, she entered a convent. Family Ottokar and Constance, from the Landgrafenpsalter (1211‚Äì13) Ottokar was married first in 1178 to Adelheid of Meissen (after 1160 - 2 February 1211), who gave birth to the following children: * Vratislav of Bohemia (d. bef. 1225). * Dagmar of Bohemia (d. 24 May 1212), married to King Valdemar II of Denmark. * Bo≈æislava of Bohemia (d. 6 Feb bef. 1238), married to Count Henry I of Ortenberg. * Hedvika of Bohemia, became a nun in Gernrode. In 1199, he married secondly to Constance of Hungary (1181 ‚Äì 6 December 1240), who gave birth to the following children: * Vratislav of Bohemia (c. 1200 ‚Äì bef. 1209). * Judith of Bohemia (Judita) (- 2 June 1230), married to Bernhard von Spanheim, Duke of Carinthia. * Anne of Bohemia (Anna Lehnick√°) (1204 - 23 June 1265), married to Henry II the Pious, High Duke of Poland. * Ane≈æka of Bohemia, died young. * Wenceslaus I of Bohemia (V√°clav I.)

It is used to create or extend software programs that originally operated primarily under MS-DOS. Although it is a powerful general- purpose programming language, it was primarily used to create database/business programs. One major dBase feature not implemented in Clipper is the dot-prompt (. prompt) interactive command set, which was an important part of the original dBase implementation. Clipper, from Nantucket Corp and later Computer Associates, started out as a native code compiler for dBase III databases, and later evolved. History Clipper was created by Nantucket Corporation, a company that was started in 1984 by Barry ReBell (management) and Brian Russell (technical); Larry Heimendinger was Nantucket's president. In 1992, the company was sold to Computer Associates for 190 million dollars and the product was renamed to CA-Clipper.GrafX Software licensed CA-Clipper in 2002 from CA for ongoing marketing and distribution. Clipper was created as a replacement programming language for Ashton Tate's dBASE III, a very popular database language at the time. The advantage of Clipper over dBASE was that it could be compiledCompiling dBASE code changes it from interpreted code, which must be interpreted every time each line of code is executed, to p-code, which uses a Virtual Machine to process the compiled p-code. p-code is considerably faster, but still not as fast as the machine code generated by native compilers. As a technical marketing ploy, the p-code was wrapped into object code (linkable .obj files) which gave the impression that it was compiled to native code. and executed under MS-DOS as a standalone application. In the years between 1985 and 1992, millions of Clipper applications were built, typically for small businesses dealing with databases concerning many aspects of client management and inventory management. For many smaller businesses, having a Clipper application designed to their specific needs was their first experience with software development. Also a lot of applications for banking and insurance companies were developed, here especially in those cases where the application was considered too small to be developed and run on traditional mainframes. In these environments Clipper also served as a front end for existing mainframe applications. As the product matured, it remained a DOS tool for many years, but added elements of the C programming language and Pascal programming language, as well as OOP, and the code-block data-type (hybridizing the concepts of dBase macros, or string-evaluation, and function pointers), to become far more powerful than the original. Nantucket's Aspen project later matured into the Windows native-code CA-Visual Objects compiler. Market penetration Nantucket sold well in Western markets. Also, in November 1991, the New York Times reported the company's success in \\"painstakingly convincing Soviet software developers that buying is preferable to pirating\\". According to the article, Clipper had sold 2,000 copies in the Soviet Union (compared to 250,000 worldwide). =Decline= In the early 1990s, under new ownership, Clipper failed to transition from MS-DOS to Microsoft Windows. As a result, almost no new commercial applications were written in Clipper after 1995. By then, the \\"classically trained programmer\\" commonly used strong typing, in contrast to the original dBASE language. An evolution of Clipper, named VO, added strong typing but made it optional, in order to remain compatibile with existing code. Four of the more important languages that took over from Clipper were Visual Basic, Microsoft Access, Delphi, and Powerbuilder. They all provided strong typing. Another factor in Clipper's decline was that, under Clipper 5.0, some applications crashed frequently and unpredictably. Nantucket didn't address the issue and seemed reluctant to even acknowledge it. Some developers moved to other products. The problem (a memory leak?) was later fixed by Computer Associates.(No data for reference - I was active in the Clipper community and this was what I witnessed at the Clipper conferences.) Some existing Clipper applications remained in active use for ten or fifteen years, requiring regular maintenance. Around 2015, the number of Clipper applications that still saw daily commercial use was very small. =Revival by third-parties= The Clipper language is being actively implemented and extended2014: by multiple organizations/vendors, like XBase++ from Alaska Software and FlagShip, as well as free (GPL-licensed) projects like Harbour and xHarbour. Many of the current implementations are portable (DOS, Windows, Linux (32- and 64-bit), Unix (32- and 64-bit), and macOS), supporting many language extensions, and have greatly extended runtime libraries, as well as various Replaceable Database Drivers (RDD) supporting many popular database formats, like DBF, DBTNTX, DBFCDX (FoxPro, Apollo, Comix, and Advantage Database Server), MachSix (SIx Driver and Apollo), SQL, and more. These newer implementations all strive for full compatibility with the standard dBase/xBase syntax, while also offering OOP approaches and target-based syntax such as \`SQLExecute()\`. =Usenet= The Clipper Usenet newsgroups are comp.lang.clipper and comp.lang.clipper.visual- objects.

Although the canon continues to be challenged, the texts most frequently taught in schools and universities are lyrics by Siegfried Sassoon and Wilfred Owen; poems by Ivor Gurney, Edward Thomas, Charles Sorley, David Jones and Isaac Rosenberg are also widely anthologised. Many of the works during and about the war were written by men because of the war's intense demand on the young men of that generation; however, a number of women (especially in the British tradition) created literature about the war, often observing the effects of the war on soldiers, domestic spaces, and the homefront more generally. General The spread of education in Britain in the decades leading up to World War I meant that British soldiers and the British public of all classes were literate. Professional and amateur authors were prolific during and after the war and found a market for their works. Literature was produced throughout the war - with women, as well as men, feeling the 'need to record their experiences' \\\\- but it was in the late 1920s and early 1930s that Britain had a boom in publication of war literature. The next boom period was in the 1960s, when there was renewed interest in World War I during the fiftieth anniversaries and after two decades focused on World War II. Poetry Published poets wrote over two thousand poems about and during the war. However, only a small fraction still is known today, and several poets that were popular with contemporary readers are now obscure. An orthodox selection of poets and poems emerged during the 1960s, which often remains the standard in modern collections and distorts the impression of World War I poetry. This selection tends to emphasise the horror of war, suffering, tragedy and anger against those that wage war. In the early weeks of the war, British poets responded with an outpouring of literary production. Rudyard Kipling's For all we have and are was syndicated extensively by newspapers in English speaking countries. Robert Bridges contributed a poem Wake Up, England! at the outbreak of war that he later wished suppressed.,Up the Line to Death, ed. Brian Gardner, 1976 John Masefield, who later succeeded Bridges as poet laureate, wrote August, 1914, a poem that was admired widely. Wilfred Owen was killed in battle; but his poems created at the front did achieve popular attention after the war's end,.e.g., Dulce Et Decorum Est, Insensibility, Anthem for Doomed Youth, Futility and Strange Meeting. In preparing for the publication of his collected poems, Owen tried to explain: Epic poem In Parenthesis by David Jones (artist-poet) has also been widely hailed as a masterpiece. The poem In Flanders Fields by John McCrae continues to be one of the more popular wartime poems in Canada, and has achieved a status where it is recognized as one of the country's most notable unofficial symbols. The expressionist poet August Stramm wrote some of Germany's important poems about the war.Ralf Schnell: Geschichte der deutschen Lyrik. Band 5: Von der Jahrhundertwende bis zum Ende des Zweiten Weltkriegs. Reclam, Stuttgart 2013. p. 81. . From the war itself until the late 1970s, the genre of war poetry was almost exclusively reserved for male poets. This was based on an idea of an exclusive authenticity limited to the works of those who had fought and died in the war. It excluded other forms of experience in the war, such as mourning, nursing and the home front, which were more likely to be experienced by other demographics such as women. There were over 500 women writing and publishing poetry during World War I. Examples of poems by female poets include Teresa Hooley's A War Film, Jessie Pope's War Girls, and Mary H.J. Henderson's An Incident. In addition to giving women greater access to work, the war also gave women greater artistic freedom and space to express their identities as artists. Novels A common subject for fiction in the 1920s and 1930s was the effect of the war, including shell shock and the huge social changes caused by the war. From the latter half of the 20th century onwards, World War I continued to be a popular subject for fiction, mainly novels. = Contemporary = Alfred Noyes is often portrayed by hostile critics as a militarist and jingoist despite being a pacifist in life.Featherstone, Simon. War Poetry: An Introductory Reader. Routledge, 1995, pp. 28, 56-57. In 1913, when it seemed that war might yet be avoided, he published a long anti-war poem called The Wine Press. During World War I, Noyes was debarred by defective eyesight from serving at the front.Parrott, Thomas Marc and Thorp, Willard (eds). Poetry of the Transition, 1850‚Äì1914, Oxford University Press, New York, 1932, p. 500. Instead, from 1916, he did his military service on attachment to the Foreign Office, where he worked with John Buchan on propaganda.Mason, Mark. \\"Alfred Noyes\\" , Literary Heritage: West Midlands. This included work as a literary figure, writing morale- boosting short stories and exhortatory odes and lyrics recalling England's military past and asserting the morality of her cause. These works are forgotten today apart from two ghost stories, \\"The Lusitania Waits\\" and \\"The Log of the Evening Star\\", which are still occasionally reprinted in collections of tales of the uncanny. Im Westen nichts Neues (\\"All Quiet on the Western Front\\"), Erich Maria Remarque's best-selling book about World War I, was translated into 28 languages with world sales nearly reaching 4 million in 1930. The work of fiction, and the award-winning film adaptation have had a greater influence in shaping public views of the war than the work of any historian. John Galsworthy's perspective was quite different in 1915 when he wrote ::Those of us who are able to look back from thirty years hence on this tornado of death ‚Äî will conclude with a dreadful laugh that if it had never come, the state of the world would be very much the same. It is not the intention of these words to deny the desperate importance of this conflict now that it has been joined ...Galsworthy, John. \\"Art and the War\\" in Atlantic Monthly, p. 267. Remarque's book was partly based on Henri Barbusse's 1916 novel Under Fire. Barbusse was a French journalist who served as a stretcher- bearer on the front lines, and his book was very influential in its own right at the time. By the end of the war, it had sold almost 250,000 copies and read by servicemen of many nations. British novelist Mary Augusta Ward wrote generally pro-war novels, some at the request of United States President Theodore Roosevelt, which nevertheless raised questions about the war. These include England's Effort (1916), Towards the Goal (1917), Missing (1917), The War and Elizabeth (1917) and Fields of Victory (1919). Some pre-existing popular literary characters were placed by their authors in World War I-related adventures during or directly after the war. These include Tom Swift (Tom Swift and His Aerial Warship in 1915 and Tom Swift and His Air Scout in 1919), Sherlock Holmes (His Last Bow, 1917) and Tarzan (Tarzan the Untamed, 1920). = Post-war = A.P. Herbert was one of the first combatants to publish a novel about the war, The Secret Battle (1919). This was followed in subsequent years by others, including Through the Wheat (1923) by Thomas Alexander Boyd, the \\"Spanish Farm Trilogy\\"‚ÄîSixty-Four (1925), Ninety-Four (1925) and The Crime at Vanderlynden's (1926)‚Äîby Ralph Hale Mottram, Death of a Hero (1929) by Richard Aldington, The Middle Parts of Fortune (1929) by Frederic Manning, The Patriot's Progress (1930) by Henry Williamson, Generals Die in Bed by Charles Yale Harrison (1930) and Winged Victory (1934) by Victor Maslin Yeates. Parade's End by Ford Madox Ford was a highly acclaimed tetralogy of novels, published between 1924 and 1927, that covers the events of World War I and the years around it from the viewpoint of a government statistician who becomes an officer in the British Army during the war. The novels were based on Ford's own experience in the war after he had enlisted at age 41. Willa Cather wrote One of Ours in 1922, and won the Pulitzer Prize in 1923 for her novel that tells the story of Claude Wheeler, a Nebraska farmer who escapes a loveless marriage to fight in the War. Critics like H.L. Mencken and Sinclair Lewis panned the book, mostly because it romanticized war. Cather based Claude Wheeler on her cousin G.P. Cather, who was killed in 1918 at the Battle of Cantigny in France. May Sinclair volunteered with the Munro Ambulance Corps in 1914 and published her account of the front in Belgium as A Journal of Impressions in Belgium (1915). She followed this with three novels about the war, Tasker Jevons (1916), The Tree of Heaven (1917) and The Romantic (1920). Journalist Evadne Price wrote a semi-biographical novel Not So Quiet: Stepdaughters of War (1930) about ambulance drivers based on women she had interviewed. W. Somerset Maugham's Ashenden: Or the British Agent (1928), a collection of short stories, was based on the author's experience with British Intelligence during the war. It was loosely adapted into the film Secret Agent (1936), directed by Alfred Hitchcock, and a 1991 BBC TV series. German author Hans Herbert Grimm wrote a novel Schlump in 1928 which was published anonymously due to its satirical and anti-war tone, loosely based on the author's own experiences as a military policeman in German-occupied France during WW1. The novel was banned by the Nazis in 1933 and Grimm was not credited as the author until 2013.http://www.startribune.com/review-schlump- by-hans-herbert-grimm/405520256/ British novelist W.F. Morris wrote two mystery novels set in the Great War- Bretherton (1929) and Behind the Lines (1930). Morris served in the British army during the war. A Farewell to Arms is a novel by Ernest Hemingway set during the Italian campaign of World War I. The book, published in 1929, is a first-person account of American Frederic Henry, serving as a lieutenant (\\"Tenente\\") in the ambulance corps of the Italian Army. The novel is about a love affair between the expatriate American Henry and Catherine Barkley against the backdrop of World War I, cynical soldiers, fighting and the displacement of populations. The publication of A Farewell to Arms cemented Hemingway's stature as a modern American writer, became his first best-seller, and is described by biographer Michael Reynolds as \\"the premier American war novel from that debacle World War I.\\" The popular literary characters Biggles and Bulldog Drummond were created by veterans of the war, W.E. Johns and H.C. McNeile respectively. Both characters served in the war and shared some their creators' history. The Bulldog Drummond books were popular among veterans after the war. Writers like Paul Fussell and Janet S.K. Watson have questioned '[w]hat role [‚Ä¶] memory play[s] in historical reconstruction‚Äô \\\\- arguing that retrospective accounts are often disillusioned. French writer and former infantryman on the Western Front Gabriel Chevallier wrote a novel Fear in 1930, based on his own experiences in the Great War. The novel was not published in English until 2011.https://www.nytimes.com/2014/07/20/books/review/gabriel-chevalliers- fear.html Although most famous for his popular Hornblower series of Napoleonic War adventure novels, C.S. Forester also wrote three novels set in the First World War. Of the three, only one- The General (1936) was set on the Western Front, the others The African Queen (1935), which was famously filmed in 1951, was set in German East Africa and Brown on Resolution (1929), was a naval adventure set in the Central Pacific. According to one source, Adolf Hitler admired the novel The General in the late 1930s and recommended it to his generals due to its depiction of the British military mindset.Sternlicht, Sanford.V.

Three Cheers for Me (1962) and its sequel That's Me in the Middle (1973) by Donald Jack, are narrated by fictional Canadian air ace Bart Bandy; both won the Leacock Medal. Canadian novelist Timothy Findley's novel of the conflict The Wars was published in 1977 and it received his country's top award for literature. War Horse (1982) by Michael Morpurgo is set in World War I and won the Whitbread Book Award for 1982. It has been adapted into a play and film. U.S. writer Mark Helprin's A Soldier of the Great Warhttps://www.kirkusreviews.com/book-reviews/mark-helprin/a-soldier-of- the-great-war/ and French novelist Sebastien Japrisot's A Very Long Engagement both appeared in 1991.https://www.independent.co.uk/arts- entertainment/books/book-review-dead-soldiers-broken-hearts-a-very-long- engagement-sebastien-japrisot-tr-linda-coverdale-1505454.html The novel Birdsong (1993) by Sebastian Faulks received much praisehttps://www.kirkusreviews.com/book-reviews/sebastian-faulks/birdsong/. Of similar acclaim is Pat Barker's Regeneration Trilogy; the third novel from the series The Ghost Road, received the most prestigious award in British fiction: The Booker Prize in 1995 (though the nomination implied the award was for the whole series. In 2014, during the centenary of the World War I, the Indian author Akhil Katyal published the poem 'Some letters of Indian soldiers at World War One' marking the contribution of more than a million Indian soldiers to the war. To the Last Man: A Novel of the First World War (2004) is a novel written by Jeff Shaara that uses perspectives from the generals and the doughboys and from the Allies and the Germans. The 2011 novel The Absolutist was written by John Boyne, the story featuring two teenage friends who enlist in the British army together and experience the war on the Western Front. The 2016 novel No Man's Land by Simon Tolkien (grandson of J. R. R. Tolkien) portrays a working-class boy who has been adopted by a wealthy family and who interrupts his Oxford studies to serve in the trenches. Memoirs Captain John Hay Beith's The First Hundred Thousand, a best-selling account of life in the army, was published in 1915 and became one of the more popular books of the period. It was translated into French as Les Premiers Cent Mille. Due to its popularity in the United States, which was neutral at the time, Beith was transferred to the British War Mission in Washington, D.C. The memoirs of several famous aerial 'aces' were published during the war, including Winged Warfare (1918) by Canadian William Bishop, Flying Fury (1918) by English ace James McCudden and The Red Fighter Pilot (1917) by Manfred von Richthofen (the latter two men were killed in action after their books were written). After the war many participants published their memoirs and diaries. One of the first was Storm of Steel (1920) by German writer Ernst Junger, an account of his experiences as an officer on the Western Front (it was first published in English in 1930). The first memoirs of Allied combatants were published in 1922, not long after the armistice: A Tank Driver's Experiences by Arthur Jenkins and Disenchantment by Charles Edward Montague. These were shortly joined with Undertones of War (1928) by Edmund Blunden, Good-Bye to All That (1929) by Robert Graves, A Subaltern's War (1929) by Charles Edmund Carrington, A Passionate Prodigality (1933) by Guy Chapman and Blasting and Bombardiering (1937) by Percy Wyndham Lewis. Memoirs of airmen included Wind in the Wires (1933) by Duncan Grinnell-Milne, Wings of War (1933) by Rudolf Stark and Sagittarius Rising (1936) by Cecil Arthur Lewis.https://www.independent.co.uk/news/people/obituary-cecil- lewis-1285736.html Nurses also published memoirs of their wartime experiences, such as A Diary without Dates (1918) by Enid Bagnold, Forbidden Zone (1929) by Mary Borden, Testament of Youth (1933) by Vera Brittain and We That Were Young (1932) by Irene Rathbone. Some Great War memoirs were not published until late in the 20th century or beyond, sometimes because the author did not write them until later in life or because they had been unable to, or had chosen not to, have them published at the time of writing (as a result, some manuscripts were published posthumously). One example was Poilu by French writer, barrel-maker and political activist Louis Barthas, a memoir written shortly after the war but not published until 1978 (the author died in 1952).The book described the author's experiences as a corporal in the French army on the Western Front.https://yalebooks.yale.edu/book/9780300212488/poilu British WW1 veteran George Coppard published his memoir With a Machine-Gun to Cambrai in 1968 while former airman Arthur Gould Lee produced his own memoir No Parachute the same year. The memoir Somme Mud was written in the 1920s but not published until 2006, over two decades after the author's death. The author, Australian Edward Francis Lynch, fought with the AIF in France in 1916-1918.https://www.smh.com.au/entertainment/books/somme- mud-20060814-gdo68z.html The Burning of the World, first published in 2014, was a memoir of the Great War on the Eastern Front by Hungarian writer & painter Bela Zombory-Moldovan who enlisted in the Austro-Hungarian Army in 1914 at age 29.https://www.wsj.com/articles/book-review-the-burning-of-the- world-by-bela-zombory-moldovan-1407453235 Theatre Plays about World War I include: * Journey's End (1928), by R.

World War I de:Liste literarischer Werke zum Ersten Weltkrieg ","title":"World War I in literature"},{"id":"246375","text":"The music of Nigeria includes many kinds of folk and popular music, styles of folk music are related to the multitudes of ethnic groups in the country, each with their own techniques, instruments, and songs. Little is known about the country's music history prior to European contact, although bronze carvings dating back to the 16th and 17th centuries have been found depicting musicians and their instruments.Karolyi, pg. 4 The largest ethnic groups are the Igbo, Hausa and Yoruba. Traditional music from Nigeria and throughout Africa is almost always functional; in other words, it is performed to mark a ritual such as a wedding or funeral and not to achieve artistic goals.Titon. P. 70 Although some Nigerians, especially children and the elderly, play instruments for their own amusement, solo performance is otherwise rare. Music is closely linked to agriculture, and there are restrictions on, for example, which instruments can be played during different parts of the growing season. Work songs are a common type of traditional Nigerian music. They help to keep the rhythm of workers in fields, river canoes and other fields. Women use complex rhythms in housekeeping tasks, such as pounding yams to highly ornamented music. In the northern regions, farmers work together on each other's farms and the host is expected to supply musicians for his neighbours. The issue of musical composition is also highly variable. The Hwana, for example, believe that all songs are taught by the peoples' ancestors, while the Tiv give credit to named composers for almost all songs, and the Efik name individual composers only for secular songs. In many parts of Nigeria, musicians are allowed to say things in their lyrics that would otherwise be perceived as offensive. The most common format for music in Nigeria is the call-and- response choir, in which a lead singer and a chorus interchange verses, sometimes accompanied by instruments that either shadow the lead text or repeat and ostinato vocal phrase. The southern area features complex rhythms and solo players using melody instruments, while the north more typically features polyphonic wind ensembles. The extreme north region is associated with monodic (i.e., single-line) music with an emphasis on drums, and tends to be more influenced by Islamic music. Traditional music = Hausa = The people of the North are known for complex percussion instrument music, the one-stringed goje, and a strong praise song vocal tradition. Under Muslim influence since the 14th century, Hausa music uses free-rhythmic improvisation and the Pentatonic scale, similar to other Muslim Sahelian tribes throughout West Africa, such as the Bambara, Kanuri, Fulani and Songhai. Traditional Hausa music is used to celebrate births, marriages, circumcisions, and other important life events. Hausa ceremonial music is well known in the area and is dominated by families of praise singers. The Hausa play percussion instruments such as the tambura drum and the talking drum. The most impressive of the Hausa state instruments, however, is the elongated state trumpet called Kakaki, which was originally used by the Songhai cavalry and was taken by the rising Hausa states as a symbol of military power. Kakaki trumpets can be more than two metres long, and can be easily broken down into three portable parts for easy transportation. = Igbo = The Igbo people live in the south-east of Nigeria, and play a wide variety of folk instruments. They are known for their ready adoption of foreign styles, and were an important part of Nigerian highlife.Graham, pg. 589 Graham describes both the receptivity of the Igbo to foreign influences, as well as the use of the obo The most widespread instrument is the 13-stringed zither, called an obo. The Igbo also play slit drums, xylophones, flutes, lyres, udus and lutes, and more recently, imported European brass instruments. Courtly music is played among the more traditional Igbo, maintaining their royal traditions. The ufie (slit drum) is used to wake the chief and communicate meal times and other important information to him. Bell and drum ensembles are used to announce when the chief departs and returns to his village. Meal times may include pie, and other dessert foods for the holidays.Graham = Yoruba = The Yoruba have a drumming tradition, with a characteristic use of the dundun hourglass tension drums. Ensembles using the dundun play a type of music that is also called dundun. These ensembles consist of various sizes of tension drums, along with kettledrums (gudugudu). The leader of a dundun ensemble is the iyalu, who uses the drum to \\"talk\\" by imitating the tonality of Yoruba Much of Yoruba music is spiritual in nature, and is devoted to their God. Yoruba music has become the most important component of modern Nigerian popular music, as a result of its early influence from European, Islamic and Brazilian forms. These influences stemmed from the importation of brass instruments, sheet music, Islamic percussion and styles brought by Brazilian merchants.Graham, pg. 589 Graham claims the source of the Brazilian influence was the influential Brazilian merchant community of the early 19th century. In both the Nigeria's most populous city, Lagos, and the largest city of Ibadan, these multicultural traditions were brought together and became the root of Nigerian popular music. Modern styles such as Ayinde Barrister's fuji, Salawa Abeni's waka and Yusuf Olatunji's sakara are derived primarily from Yoruba traditional music.Yoruba music have now come of age and the new generation of Nigerian music now sing in their native language. 9ice is one of many that broke into the industry with Gongo Aso and many more artist followed. UK based saxophonist Tunday Akintan created yorubeat based on Yor√πb√° rhythms. Listening to Timi Korus Babe mi Jowo and Flosha denotes artist home and abroad now rap and sing in yoruba and not forgetting their heritage.  Theatrical music  Nigerian theatre makes extensive use of music. Often, this is simply traditional music used in a theatrical production without adaptation. However, there are also distinct styles of music used in Nigerian opera. Here, music is used to convey an impression of the dramatic action to the audience. Music is also used in literary drama, although its musical accompaniment is more sparingly used than in opera; again, music communicates the mood or tone of events to the audience. An example is John Pepper Clark's The Ozidi Saga, a play about murder and revenge, featuring both human and non-human actors. Each character in the play is associated with a personal theme song, which accompanies battles in which the character is involved. Traditional Nigerian theatre includes puppet shows in Borno State and among the Ogoni and Tiv, and the ancient Yoruba Al√°√†r√¨nj√≥ tradition, which may be descended from the Eg√∫ng√∫n masquerade. With the influx of road-building colonial powers, these theatre groups spread across the country and their productions grew ever more elaborate. They now typically use European instruments, film extracts and recorded music. In the past, both Hubert Ogunde and Ade Love, of blessed memories, produced soundtracks of their movies using very rich Yoruba language. Modern day Yoruba film and theater music composers among whom Tope Alabi is the flagbearer have variously accompanied dramatic actions with original music.  Children's music  Children in Nigeria have many of their own traditions, usually singing games. These are most often call-and-response type songs, using archaic language. There are other songs, such as among the Tarok people that are sexually explicit and obscene, and are only performed far away from the home. Children also use instruments like un-pitched raft zithers (made from cornstalks) and drums made from tin cans, a pipe made from a pawpaw stem and a jaw harp made from a sorghum stalk. Among the Hausa, children play a unique instrument in which they beat rhythms on the inflated stomach of a live, irritated pufferfish.  Traditional instruments  Although percussion instruments are omnipresent, Nigeria's traditional music uses a number of diverse instruments. Many, such as the xylophone, are an integral part of music across West Africa, while others are imports from the Muslims of the Maghreb, or from Southern or East Africa; other instruments have arrived from Europe or the Americas. Brass instruments and woodwinds were early imports that played a vital role in the development of Nigerian music, while the later importation of electric guitars spurred the popularisation of j√πj√∫ music. = Percussion = Drummers in Ojumo Oro, Kwara State The xylophone is a tuned idiophone, common throughout west and central Africa. In Nigeria, they are most common in the southern part of the country, and are of the central African model. Several people sometimes simultaneously play a single xylophone. The instruments are usually made of loose wood placed across banana logs. Pit- and box-resonated xylophones are also found. Ensembles of clay pots beaten with a soft pad are common; they are sometimes filled with water. Although normally tuned, untuned examples are sometimes used to produce a bass rhythm. Hollow logs are also used, split lengthways, with resonator holes at the end of the slit. They were traditionally used to communicate over great distances. Various bells are a common part of royal regalia, and were used in secret societies. They are usually made of iron, or in Islamic orchestras of the north, of bronze. Struck gourds, placed on a cloth and struck with sticks, are a part of women's music, as well as the b√≤√≤r√≠√≠ cult dances. Sometimes, especially in the north, gourds are placed upside-down in water, with the pitch adjusted by the amount of air underneath it. In the south-west, a number of tuned gourds are played while floating in a trough. Scrapers are common throughout the south. One of the most common types is a notched stick, played by dragging a shell across the stick at various speeds. It is used both as a women's court instrument and by children in teasing games. Among the Yoruba, an iron rod may be used as a replacement for a stick. Rattles are common, made of gourds containing seeds or stones are common, as are net-rattles, in which a string network of beads or shells encloses a gourd. Rattles are typically played in ritual or religious context, predominantly by women. Drums of many kinds are the most common type of percussion instrument in Nigeria. They are traditionally made from a single piece of wood or spherical calabashes, but have more recently been made from oil drums. The hourglass drum is the most common shape, although there are also double-headed barrel drums, single-headed drums and conical drums. Frame drums are also found in Nigeria, but may be an importation from Brazil. An unusual percussion instrument is the udu, a kind of vessel drum. This instrument is very essential in most African countries. = String instruments = The musical bow is found in Nigeria as a mouth-resonated cord, either plucked or struck. It is most common in the central part of the country, and is associated with agricultural songs and those expressing social concerns. Cereal stalks bound together and strings supported by two bridges are used to make a kind of raft-zither, played with the thumbs, typically for solo entertainment. The arched harp is found in the eastern part of the country, especially among the Tarok. It usually has five or six strings and pentatonic tuning. A bowl-resonated spike-fiddle with a lizard skin table is used in the northern region, and is similar to central Asian and Ethiopian forms. The Hausa and Kanuri peoples play a variety of spike-lutes. = Other instruments = A variety of brass and woodwind instruments are also found in Nigeria. These include long trumpets, frequently made of aluminium and played in pairs or ensembles of up to six, often accompanied by a shawm. Wooden trumpets, gourd trumpets, end-blown flutes, cruciform whistles, transverse clarinets and various kinds of horns are also found.  Popular music  Many African countries have seen turbulence and violence during their forced transition from a diverse region of folk cultures to a group of modern nation states. Nigeria has experienced more difficulty than most African countries in forging a popular cultural identity from the diverse peoples of the countryside. From its beginnings in the streets of Lagos, popular music in Nigeria has long been an integral part of the field of African pop, bringing in influences and instruments from many ethnic groups, most prominently including the Yoruba. The earliest styles of Nigerian popular music were palm-wine music and highlife, which spread in the 1920s among Nigeria and nearby countries of Liberia, Sierra Leone and Ghana. In Nigeria, palm-wine became the primary basis for j√πj√∫, a genre that dominated popular music for many years. During this time, a few other styles such as apala, derived from traditional Yoruba music, also found a more limited audience. By the 1960s, Cuban, American and other styles of imported music were enjoying a large following, and musicians started to incorporate these influences into j√πj√∫. The result was a profusion of new styles in the last few decades of the 20th century, including waka music, Yo-pop and Afrobeat. = Palm-wine and the invention of j√πj√∫ = By the start of the 20th century, Yoruba music had incorporated brass instruments, written notation, Islamic percussion and new Brazilian techniques, resulting in the Lagos-born palm-wine style. The term palm-wine is also used to describe related genres in Sierra Leone, Liberia and Ghana. these varieties are better- known than Nigerian palm-wine. However, palm-wine originally referred to a diverse set of styles played with string instruments, characteristically, guitars or banjos) with shakers and hand drums accompanying This urban style was frequently played in bars to accompany drinking (hence the name, which is derived from the alcoholic palm wine beverage). The first stars of palm-wine had emerged by the 1920s, the most famous of whom was Baba Tunde King. King probably coined the word j√πj√∫ ‚Äî a style of music he helped to create ‚Äî in reference to the sound of a Brazilian tambourine; alternatively, the term may have developed as an expression of disdain by the colonial leaders (any native tradition was apt to be dismissed as 'mere joujou, French for \\"nonsense\\").Graham, pg. 590 Graham claims that the word juju was a mild expression of colonial disparagement -- musical mumbo jumbo -- taken up by j√πj√∫ musicians themselves to subvert it. And jojo also happens to be Yoruba for dance. By the early 1930s, British record labels such as His Master's Voice had started to record palm-wine, and more celebrities emerged, including Ojoge Daniel, Tunde Nightingale and Speedy Araba. These artists, along with Tunde King, established the core of the style which was called j√πj√∫, and remained one of the most popular genres in Nigeria throughout the 20th century. Some J√πj√∫ musicians were itinerant, including early pioneers Ojoge Daniel, Irewole Denge and the \\"blind minstrel\\" Kokoro. = Apala = Apala is a style of vocal and percussive Muslim Yoruba music. It emerged in the late 1930s as a means of rousing worshippers after the fasting of Ramadan. Under the influence of popular Afro-Cuban percussion, apala developed into a more polished style and attracted a large audience. The music required two or three talking drums (omele), a rattle (sekere), thumb piano (agidigbo) and a bell (agogo). Haruna Ishola was the most famous apala performer, and he later played an integral role in bringing apala to larger audiences as a part of fuji music.Afropop: Apala Afropop cites this claim as (m)usicologist Chris Waterman suggests that the influence of Afro-Cuban percussion recordings was also formative in refining the music's presentation, although not its rhythms and forms. Afropop further specifies that, though the other instruments mentioned are common throughout Nigerian popular music, the use of the agidigbo is unusual and peculiar to apala = The 1950s, '60s and '70s = Following World War II, Nigerian music started to take on new instruments and techniques, including electric instruments imported from the United States and Europe. Rock N' roll, soul, and later funk, became very popular in Nigeria, and elements of these genres were added to j√πj√∫ by artists such as IK Dairo. Meanwhile, highlife had been slowly gaining in popularity among the Igbo people, and their unique style soon found a national audience. At the same time, apala's Haruna Ishola was becoming one of the country's biggest stars. In the early to mid-1970s, three of the biggest names in Nigerian music history were at their peak: Fela Kuti, Ebenezer Obey and King Sunny Ad√©, while the end of that decade saw the start of Yo-pop and Nigerian reggae. Although popular styles such as highlife and j√πj√∫ were at the top of the Nigerian charts in the '60s, traditional music remained widespread. Traditional stars included the Hausa Dan Maraya, who was so well known that he was brought to the battlefield during the 1967 Nigerian Civil War to lift the morale of the federal troops.  Modernisation of J√πj√∫  I.K. Dairo Following World War II, Tunde Nightingale's s'o wa mbe style made him one of the first j√πj√∫ stars, and he introduced more Westernised pop influences to the genre. During the 1950s, recording technology grew more advanced, and the gangan talking drum, electric guitar and accordion were incorporated into j√πj√∫. Much of this innovation was the work of IK Dairo & the Morning Star Orchestra (later IK Dairo & the Blue Spots), which formed in 1957. these performers brought j√πj√∫ from the rural poor to the urban cities of Nigeria and beyond. Dairo became perhaps the biggest star of African music by the '60s, recording numerous hit songs that spread his fame to as far away as Japan. In 1963, he became the only African musician ever honoured by receiving membership of the Order of the British Empire, an order of chivalry in the United Kingdom.  Dispersion of highlife  Among the Igbo people, Ghanaian highlife became popular in the early 1950s, and other guitar-band styles from Cameroon and Zaire soon followed. The Ghanaian E. T. Mensah, easily the most popular highlife performer of the 1950s, toured Igbo-land frequently, drawing huge crowds of devoted fans. Bobby Benson & His Combo was the first Nigerian highlife band to find audiences across the country. Benson was followed by Jim Lawson & the Mayor's Dance Band, who achieved national fame in the mid-'70s, ending with Lawson's death in 1971. During the same period, other highlife performers were reaching their peak. These included Prince Nico Mbarga and his band Rocafil Jazz, whose \\"Sweet Mother\\" was a pan-African hit that sold more than 13 million copies, more than any other African single of any kind. Mbarga used English lyrics in a style that he dubbed panko, which incorporated \\"sophisticated rumba guitar-phrasing into the highlife idiom\\".Graham, pgs. 596‚Äì597 Graham explains the importance of both Benson and Lawson. Referring to \\"Sweet Mother, Graham explains: (b)ut it is an infectious song and its potent appeal was concocted from Mbarga's use of pidgin English (broadening his audience enormously) and a style he called panko -- for the first time incorporating sophisticated rumba guitar-phrasing into the highlife idiom. After the civil war in the 1960s, Igbo musicians were forced out of Lagos and returned to their homeland. The result was that highlife ceased to be a major part of mainstream Nigerian music, and was thought of as being something purely associated with the Igbos of the east. Highlife's popularity slowly dwindled among the Igbos, supplanted by j√πj√∫ and fuji. However, a few performers kept the style alive, such as Yoruba singer and trumpeter Victor Olaiya (the only Nigerian to ever earn a platinum record), Stephen Osita Osadebe, Oliver De Coque, Celestine Ukwu, Oriental Brothers, Sonny Okosun, Victor Uwaifo, and Orlando \\"Dr. Ganja\\" Owoh, whose distinctive toye style fused j√πj√∫ and highlife.  Birth of fuji  Apala, a traditional style from Ogun state, one of yoruba state in Nigeria, became very popular in the 1960s, led by performers like Haruna Ishola, Sefiu Ayan, Kasumu Adio, and Ayinla Omowura. Ishola, who was one of Nigeria's most consistent hit makers between 1955 and his death in 1983, recorded apala songs, which alternated between slow and emotional, and swift and energetic. His lyrics were a mixture of improvised praise and passages from the Quran, as well as traditional proverbs. His work became a formative influence on the developing fuji style. The late 1960s saw the appearance of the first fuji bands. Fuji was named after Mount Fuji in Japan, purely for the sound of the word, according to Ayinde Barrister.Graham, pg. 593 Graham does not cite a specific source for the claim by Sikiru Barrister Fuji was a synthesis of apala with the \\"ornamented, free-rhythmic\\" vocals of ajisari devotional musiciansArab World Information, \\"Popular Fuji Music of Nigeria\\" and was accompanied by the sakara, a tambourine-drum, and Hawaiian guitar. Among the genre's earliest stars were Haruna Ishola and Ayinla Omowura; Ishola released numerous hits from the late '50s to the early '80s, becoming one of the country's most famous performers. Fuji grew steadily more popular between the 1960s and '70s, becoming closely associated with Islam in the process. Fuji has been described as j√πj√∫ without guitars; ironically, Ebenezer Obey once described j√πj√∫ as mambo with guitars.Graham, pg. 593 Graham does not cite a specific source beyond Ebenezer Obey, and explains that fuji is only sometimes glibly described as j√πj√∫ music without guitars However, at its roots, fuji is a mixture of Muslim traditional were music'ajisari songs with \\"aspects of apala percussion and vocal songs and brooding, philosophical sakara music\\";Afropop: Fuji Ayinde Barrister, who remains on the leading edge, started out in 1965 singing were music used to rouse Muslims early in the morning during the holy season of Ramadan. He went on to mix in aspects of apala percussion and vocal songs and brooding, philosophical sakara music and emerged with a new style of music he dubbed fuji. of these elements, apala is the fundamental basis of fujiAfropop: Apala Afropop cites this claim as typically considered the most important precursor of fuji The first stars of fuji were the rival bandleaders Alhaji Sikiru Ayinde Barrister and Ayinla Kollington Alhaji Sikiru Ayinde Barrister started his fuji career in the early 1970s with the Golden Fuji Group\\", although he had sung Muslim songs since he was 10 years old. He first changed his group's name to \\"Fuji Londoners\\" when he came back from a trip to London, England. After a very long time -- with hits such as \\"Orilonise\\", Fuji Disco/Iku Baba Obey\\", \\"Oke Agba\\", \\"Aye\\", and \\"Suuru\\" -- he later changed the group's name to \\"Supreme Fuji Commanders\\" with a bang!, \\"Orelope\\" that went platinum instantly. Ayinde's rival was Ayinla Kollington, \\"Baba Alatika\\", known for fast tempo and dance-able brand of fuji, who also recorded hit albums like \\"ko bo simi lo'run mo e, in the 80s he released \\"ijo yoyo, Lakukulala and American megastar\\" to mention few of his successful albums. With all due respect Ayinla Kollington is a coherent social commentator. He was followed in the 1980s by burgeoning stars such as Wasiu Ayinde Marshall.  Sunny Ade and Obey  Ebenezer Obey formed the International Brothers in 1964, and his band soon rivalled that of IK Dairo as the biggest Nigerian group. They played a form of bluesy, guitar-based and highlife-influenced j√πj√∫ that included complex talking drum-dominated percussion elements. Obey's lyrics addressed issues that appealed to urban listeners, and incorporated Yoruba traditions and his conservative Christian faith. His rival was King Sunny Ad√©, who emerged in the same period, forming the Green Spots in 1966 and then achieving some major hits with the African Beats after 1974's Esu Biri Ebo Mi. Ade and Obey raced to incorporate new influences into j√πj√∫ music and to gather new fans; Hawaiian slack-key, keyboards and background vocals were among the innovations added during this rapidly changing period.Graham, pgs. 591‚Äì592 Graham discusses at length the rivalry between Ade and Obey that spurred so much innovation Ade added strong elements of Jamaican dub music, and introduced the practice of having the guitar play the rhythm and the drums play the melody. During this period, j√πj√∫ songs changed from short pop songs to long tracks, often over 20 minutes in length. Bands increased from four performers in the original ensembles, to 10 with IK Dairo and more than 30 with Obey and Ade. = 1980s and '90s = In the early 1980s, both Obey and Ade found larger audiences outside of Nigeria. In 1982, Ade was signed to Island Records, who hoped to replicate Bob Marley's success, and released Juju Music, which sold far beyond expectations in Europe and the United States. Obey released Current Affairs in 1980 on Virgin Records and became a brief star in the UK, but was not able to sustain his international career as long as Ade. Ade led a brief period of international fame for j√πj√∫, which ended in 1985 when he lost his record contract after the commercial failure of Aura (recorded with Stevie Wonder) and his band walked out in the middle of a huge Japanese tour. Ade's brush with international renown brought a lot of attention from mainstream record companies, and helped to inspire the burgeoning world music industry. By the end of the 1980s, j√πj√∫ had lost out to other styles, like Yo-pop, gospel and reggae. In the 1990s, however, fuji and j√πj√∫ remained popular, as did waka music and Nigerian reggae. At the very end of the decade, hip hop music spread to the country after being a major part of music in neighboring regions like Senegal.  Yo-pop and Afro-j√πj√∫ (1980s)  Two of the biggest stars of the '80s were Segun Adewale and Shina Peters, who started their careers performing in the mid-'70s with Prince Adekunle. They eventually left Adekunle and formed a brief partnership as Shina Adewale & the International Superstars before beginning solo careers. Adewale was the first of the two to gain success, when he became the most famous performer of Yo-pop. The Yo-pop craze did not last for long, replaced by Shina Peters' Afro-juju style, which broke into the mainstream after the release of Afro- Juju Series 1 (1989). Afro-juju was a combination of Afrobeat and fuji, and it ignited such fervor among Shina's fans that the phenomenon was dubbed \\"Shinamania\\". Though he was awarded Juju Musician of the Year in 1990, Shina's follow-up, Shinamania sold respectively but was panned by critics.Graham, pgs. 592‚Äì593 Graham describes the origins of Peters' Afro-juju, the importance of Afro-Juju Series 1, the term Shinamania and the critical and commercial performance of Shinamania His success opened up the field to newcomers, however, leading to the success of Fabulous Olu Fajemirokun and Adewale Ayuba. The same period saw the rise of new styles like the funky juju pioneered by Dele Taiwo.Afropop: Juju Afropop refers to the time period for funky juju as around the same time as 1989 or 1990  Afrobeat  Femi Kuti Afrobeat is a style most closely associated with Nigeria, though practitioners and fans are found throughout West Africa, and Afrobeat recordings are a prominent part of the world music category found throughout the developed world. It is music with elements of highlife, and other styles of West African music. The most popular and well-known performer, indeed the most famous Nigerian musician in history, is undoubtedly Fela Kuti. Fela Kuti began performing in 1961, but did not start playing in his distinctive Afrobeat style until his exposure to Sierra Leonean Afro-soul singer Geraldo Pino in 1963. Although Kuti is often credited as the only pioneer of Afrobeat, other musicians such as Orlando Julius Ekemode were also prominent in the early Afrobeat scene, where they combined highlife, jazz and funk. A brief period in the United States saw him exposed to the Black Power movement and the Black Panthers, an influence that he would come to express in his lyrics. After living in London briefly, he moved back to Lagos and opened a club, The Shrine, which was one of the most popular music spots in the city. He started recording with Africa '70, a huge band featuring drummer Tony Allen, who has since gone on to become a well- known musician in his own right. With Africa 70, Kuti recorded a series of hits, earning the ire of the government as he tackled such diverse issues as poverty, traffic and skin-bleaching. In 1985, Kuti was jailed for five years, but was released after only two years after international outcry and massive domestic protests. Upon release, Kuti continued to criticise the government in his songs, and became known for eccentric behaviour, such as suddenly divorcing all twenty-eight wives because \\"no man has the right to own a woman's vagina\\". His death from AIDS in 1997 sparked a period of national mourning that was unprecedented in documented Nigerian history.Graham, pg. 595 Graham is the source for the \\"vagina\\" quote, as well as the details of Kuti's career and the significance of his death In the 1980s, Afrobeat became affiliated with the burgeoning genre of world music. In Europe and North America, so-called \\"world music\\" acts came from all over the world and played in a multitude of styles. Fela Kuti and his Afrobeat followers were among the most famous of the musicians considered world music. By the end of the '80s and early '90s, Afrobeat had diversified by taking in new influences from jazz and rock and roll. The ever-masked and enigmatic L√°gb√°j√° became one of the standard-bearers of the new wave of Afrobeat, especially after his 1996 LP C'est Une African Thing. Following a surprise appearance in place of his father, Fela, Femi Kuti garnered a large fan base that enabled him to tour across Europe.  Waka  The popular songstress Salawa Abeni had become nationally renowned after the release of Late General Murtala Ramat Mohammed in 1976, which was the first Nigerian recording by a woman to sell more than a million copies. In the 1980s, she remained one of the nation's best-selling artists, creating her own unique variety of music called waka; she was so closely associated with the genre that a royal figure, the Alaafin of Oyo, Obalamidi Adeyemi, crowned her the \\"Queen of Waka Music\\" in 1992. Waka was a fusion of j√πj√∫, fuji and traditional Yoruba music.Waka music is coming back into the new age with fresh artist like Tila man Timi Korus and Dollar billz bringing back the old school into new school.In an interview granted by Timi Korus he acknowledge that Waka Music was made popular to younger generations during the time of salawa abeni but waka music has been in the industry in a long time.  Reggae and hip hop  Duncan Mighty performing When talking about reggae music in Nigeria, this brand of music was started by a musician simply called \\"Terakota\\". By the 80s, Nigerian reggae stars included The Mandators, Ras Kimono, Majek Fashek, whose 1988 cover of Bob Marley's \\"Redemption Song\\", became an unprecedented success for reggae in Nigeria. Like many later Nigerian reggae stars, Fashek was a part of the long-running band The Mandators, who toured and recorded incessantly during the mid to late 1980s and early '90s. Later prominent reggae musicians included Jerri Jheto and Daddy Showkey. The African Caribbean fusion is one that has been popular and growing over the years, especially in the 21st century. In this genre of music African musicians incorporate Jamaican patois into their lyrics and beats. Although, very popular in Jamaica, this genre well blended genre became well known in the African region around the 19th century because of the Nigerian Reggae musician Majek Fashek who attracted international attention to this fusion.Majek Fashek  Biography  AllMusic. (n.d.). AllMusic. Retrieved October 13, 2014, from http://www.allmusic.com/artist/majek-fashek- mn0000236645/biography This genre of music is gaining far more presence in Nigeria with recent 21st century artists like Duncan Mighty, Timaya, Slim Burna, Orezi, Burna Boy and Patoranking who are attracting a younger audience. Hip hop music was brought to Nigeria in the late 1980s, and grew steadily popular throughout the first part of the 1990s. The first acts included Sound on Sound, Emphasis, Ruff Rugged & Raw, SWAT ROOT, De Weez and Black Masquradaz. Moreover, mainstream success grew later in the decade, with attention brought by early hits like The Trybesmen's \\"Trybal Marks\\" (1999) and the trio The Remedies' \\"Judile\\" and \\"Sakoma\\". One of The Remedies, Tony Tetuila, went on to work with the Plantashun Boiz to great commercial acclaim. The 1999 founding of Paybacktyme Records by Solomon Dare, popularly known as Solodee, Kennis Music by Kenny Ogungbe, Dove Records by Nelson Brown, and Trybe Records by eLDee helped redefined and establish a Nigerian hip hop scene. Also, the general rapid growth of the entertainment scene with support from the media helped popularise Hiphop music in Nigeria. Television Programmes like Videowheels, HipTV, Music Africa, the MTN Y'ello show, Music Africa, Nigezie, and Soundcity played a major role. Other prominent Nigerian hip-hop musicians include Tuface idibia, Ruggedman, Eedris Abdulkareem, Weird MC, Naeto C, Twin-X, and P-Square Around the close of the decade of the 2000s, more hip-hop acts began to gain popularity. Notable hip hop acts in this era include Wizkid, Davido, Olamide, Vector, Reminisce, Ice Prince and M.I Abaga. Some upcoming acts such as Kiss Daniel, Tekno, Mc Galaxy, Adekunle Gold, Dammy Krane, Erigga, and Lil Kesh have also started to receive more attention for their songs.  Women in music  In the Nigerian music industry the female artists stand out and are widely recognized for their talents and achievements. Over the years most Nigerian female artists stuck to the contemporary African music, but in the 21st century several female artists began to diversify into other genres like Rap, Hip-hop and Afrobeats. Notable female Nigerian rappers include Weird Mc, Sasha P, Mo'Cheddah and Eva Alordiah. While in terms of Afrobeats there are so many female artists but only a few have been constant over the years like Omawumi Megbele, Yinka Davies, Goldie, Seyi Shay, Niniola, Tiwa Savage, Teni, Yemi Alade and Simi.\\"Top 7 queens of the Nigerian music industry\\".

Although the principal attraction of the durbar festivals is displays of traditional horsemanship, performances by drummers, trumpeters and praise-singers are an important part of the celebration Africa Travel. Other holidays in which music plays an important role include drumming and dances performed at Christmas, Easter Sunday and Easter Monday. 9ice is also one of the upcoming artiste (he sings both Yoruba and English pop) gongoaso is one of his top single.  Classical music  In the 20th century, Nigeria produced a number of classical composers; these include Lazarus Ekwueme, Fela Sowande, Joshua Uzoigwe, Ayo Bankole, and Akin Euba. Sowande was one of the first and most famous African composers in the Western classical tradition, and founder of the Nigerian art music tradition. Sowande was also an organist and jazz musician, incorporating these and elements of Nigerian folk music into his work. Echezonachukwu Nduka is poet and pianist, specializing in piano music by African and African-descent composers.

Additionally, there is a growing western classical music scene and Kenya is home to a number of music colleges and schools. Popular music The guitar is the most dominant instrument in Kenyan popular music. Guitar rhythms are very complex and include both native beats and imported ones, especially the Congolese cavacha rhythm; music usually involves the interplay of multiple parts and, more recently, showy guitar solos. Lyrics are most often in Swahili or native languages, like Kalenjin though radio will generally not play music in one of the ethnic languages. Kenyan Musicians performing traditional Luo songs Benga music has been popular since the late 1960s, especially around Lake Victoria. The word benga is occasionally used to refer to any kind of pop music: bass, guitar and percussion are the usual instruments. Partially from 1994 and wholly from 2003 Kenyan popular music has been recognised through the Kisima Music Awards. A number of styles predominate in Kenya including Benga and Reggae have separate categories, and a multitude of Kenyan artists are awarded each year. =Early 20th century= The guitar was popular in Kenya even before the 19th century, well before it penetrated other African countries. Fundi Konde was the best-known early guitarist, alongside Paul Mwachupa and Lukas Tututu the middle of the 1920s, dance clubs had appeared in Mombasa, playing music for Christians to dance in a European style. During World War II, Kenyan and Ugandan musicians were drafted as entertainers in the King's African Rifles and continued after the war as the Rhino Band, the first extremely popular band across Kenya. In 1948, the group split, with many of the members forming the Kiko Kids or other bands. By the 1950s, radio and recording technology had advanced across Kenya. Fundi Konde, the prominent guitarist, was an early broadcaster and influential in the fledgling recording industry. =Congolese finger-style and the development of benga= Beginning in about 1952, recordings from legendary Congolese guitarists like Edouard Massengo and Jean-Bosco Mwenda were available in Kenya. Bosco's technique of picking with the thumb and forefinger (finger-style) became popular. Finger-style music is swift and usually based around small groups, in which the second guitar follows the first with syncopated bass rhythms. This style of music became extremely popular later in the decade. =Swahili and Congolese pop= The two biggest genres of pop music played by Kenyan bands are called the swahili sound or the Congolese sound. Both are based on soukous (rumba) from the Democratic Republic of the Congo. Swahili music can be distinguished by a much slower rhythm, though the styles have had a tendency to merge in recent decades. The genres are not distinguished by language, though Swahili pop is usually in Swahili or the related Taiti language. Both are sometimes in Lingala or one of the native languages of Kenya. Congolese musicians were the most popular performers in Kenya during the 1970s and 1980s, only losing their mainstream acceptance in the early 1990s. Orchestre Virunga was perhaps the most popular and long- running of the Congolese bands. During this period, Swahili musicians (many from Tanzania) were mostly based around the Wanyika bands. This group of often rival bands began in 1971 when a Tanzanian group named Arusha Jazz came to Kenya, eventually becoming the Simba Wanyika Band. The band first split in 1978, when many of the group members formed Les Wanyika. Other notable Congolese groups in Kenya included Super Mazembe and Les Mangelepa. Tanzania's Moro Band and Remmy Ongala also became quite popular in Kenya back in the 1980s. It was hard to differentiate them from the native Kenyan singers. =Hotel pop= Tourist-oriented pop covers are popular, and employ more live bands than more authentic Kenyan folk and pop genres. Them Mushrooms, who began playing the Nairobi hotel circuit in 1987, are among these bands. Lately, hotel bands like Them Mushrooms and Safari Sound Band have begun playing reggae. =Regional pop= The Luo people, one of Kenya's largest ethnic groups, live in the Western part of Kenya and their pop music is what epitomizes the original Benga style. Contemporary variations of Benga and Luo traditional music has produced the Ohangla style that is popular with young Luo. The Luo of Kenya have long played an eight-string lyre called nyatiti, and guitarists from the area sought to imitate the instrument's syncopated melodies. In benga, the electric bass guitar is played in a style reminiscent of the nyatiti. As late as the turn of the twentieth century, this bass in nyatiti supported the rhythm essential in transmitting knowledge about the society through music. Opondo Owenga of Gem Yala, the grandfather of Odhiambo Siangla, was known in employing music as a means of teaching history of the Luo. The fathers of the Luo Benga genre are George Ramogi (Omogi wuod Weta) and CK Jazz. He helped the Benga enthusiasts by recording their Benga music in different labels in the capital city Nairobi. Dr. Mengo of Victoria Jazz was a protege of George Ramogi. In 1967, the first major benga band, Shirati Jazz, was formed by Daniel Owino Misiani. The group launched a string of hits that were East Africa's biggest songs throughout the 1970s and 1980s. Shirati Jazz's biggest rival was Victoria Jazz, formed in 1972 by Ochieng Nelly Mengo and Collela Mazee. Despite many personnel changes, Victoria Jazz remained popular throughout the 1970s, when the Voice of Kenya radio station pushed an onslaught of East African pop. Victoria C Band of Awino Lawi was one of the splinter group of Victoria Jazz. 1997 saw the death of three prominent Luo Benga artist, Okatch Biggy of Heka Heka Band, George Ramogi and Prince Jully. The Jolly Boys Band of Prince Jully was taken over by his wife Princess Jully and she has since been a leading female Benga musician.[1] Another famous benga band Migori Super Stars was formed in the mid 1970s and was led by Musa Olwete which later split to form another popular benga band Migori Super Stars C with musicians such as Joseph Ochola (Kasongo Polo Menyo), Onyango Jamba, Ochieng' Denge denge and others. More modern benga artists include Akothee Kapere Jazz Band and the rootsy Ogwang Lelo Okoth. The new millennium has seen emergence of Dola Kabarry and Musa Juma. The latter saw his career cut short as he died in 2011.MJ,as he was popularly known to his fans, developed a kind of benga that infused elements of rumba. he was able to mold other musicians such as John Junior, Ogonji, Madanji, and his late brother Omondi Tonny.[2] More recently, the compositions of the trumpeter Christine Kamau combine jazz with benga and rhumba. There are also Benga artists are based in countries other than Kenya, such as American/Kenyan group Extra Golden. The Kamba people live to the south and east of Nairobi. Their pop music is closely related to benga, but includes a second guitar that plays a melodious counterpoint to the primary guitar. The most popular Kamba pop bands arose in the middle of the 1970s and include Les Kilimambogo Brothers Band led by Kakai Kilonzo, Kalambya Boys & Kalambya Sisters led by Onesmus Musyoki and Joseph Mutaiti and Peter Mwambi & His Kyanganga Boys. Other groups also include Lower Mbooni Boys Band, Muthetheni Boys Band and Ukia Boys Band. Other Akamba Pop Bands were formed in the 1980s and included Kakuku Boys Band vocalled by John Mutua Muteti whose lyrics consisted of religious, domestic, and court humour, Ngoleni Brothers which was formed by Dick Mutuku Mulwa after he left Kalambya Boys & Kalambya Sisters. It can also be noted that Kalambya Boys original members were Onesmus Musyoki (vocals), Joseph Mutaiti (vocals), Dick Mutuku Mulwa (rhythm guitar), James Maisha Muli(Drums) and Peter Kisaa (solo guitar). Kalambya Boys split and Joseph Mutaiti formed Super Kaiti and Onesmus Musyoki went gospel to form Emali Town Choir. Leading Luhya musicians include Sukuma Bin Ongaro, and Shem Tube with his group Abana Ba Nasery. It raised up to a certain level and came an instrument with eight strings called \\"litungu\\" played popularly in Bungoma by a group of people called bukusu in a band e.g Sinani Band led by Wanjala Mandari,there after improved and developed in 2020 by Wabwile wa Mbakalo with a love message to educate and fablish the community in luhya/Bukusu dialect Wabwile Wa Mbakalo has become popular in Bungoma region with his sweet voice and recruited other young stars in the region.Richard Trillo: The Rough Guide to Kenya. 8th Edition, Rough Guides 2006, (page 720) =Hip hop= Hip hop is a hugely popular style of music in Kenya. Artists rap in English, Swahili, the local Sheng slang or even in vernacular language like kikuyu (G.rongi), Kisii (Smallz Lethal) or dhaluo (Gidi Gidi Maji Maji). One of its many popular genres is Genge which is showcased through artists such as Jua Cali, Nonini and Jimwat. There is also Kapuka rap, which is found with artists like Nameless. Female rappers like Needah of Grosspool Music and Xtatic, who got signed to Sony Music are taking the industry to another level. Others like Wangechi and Femi One are also doing the genre some justice. The country also boasts a large following of hardcore rap which is characterised by swift freestyle battlers and lyricists like Mc Mike G of 237 cypher, Bamboo, G.rongi,Jay Fourz, SDL, Abass Doobiez and Chiwawa. The genre also boasts only two live performers; Juliani (formerly of Ukoo Flani) and Jemedari, a fresh rapper who draws his roots from Coastal influences Camp Mulla, an alternative hip hop group, has had more success than any other Kenyan artist in history. As of 28 September 2012, they have won two CHAT Awards and have been nominated for prestigious awards such as the BET Awards, the MTV Europe Music Awards and the MOBO Awards. =Reggae= Reggae musician Prince Otach Reggae is one of the most popular genres of music in Kenya. Reggae elements are often mixed with local hip hop and pop music, yet there have not been many mainstream reggae musicians in Kenya. One of the best known local reggae musicians is the late Mighty King Kong. Upcoming reggae artist \\"priest fari\\" is the artist to watch out for. With two albums \\"warrior\\" and \\"Pressure\\" under his belt, Priest fari is arguably the next big thing on the Kenyan reggae scene. His touch remains the original Jamaican roots reggae. Others include Jahkey Malle and Prince Otach. Reggae Ras Naya, is one of the best reggae artists from Kenya and abroad, based in Paris. His last album \\"Shine\\" was recorded in Orange Street, Kingston, Jamaica, in 2012. The other albums are called \\"Freedom\\", \\"Mau Mau\\" and \\" Black and White\\". A new album called \\"Mama\\" is coming in 2013. Ras Naya represents Kenyan reggae in Europe and the rest of the world. Other Reggae icons in Kenya who have risen in the recent past include the talented Wyre and Red San. Other artists with notable success include Osmarne, Esizo SDL, Versatile and chronic. The massive love for reggae in Kenya has led to inception of other talents including Reggae music Deejays. The most remarkable Dj who shines in the hearts of all Kenyan Reggae music lovers is Dj Stano. Dj Stano has grown to be Kenya's biggest reggae music dj. His talent and love for music has developed to major parts of Kenya and beyond. Dj Stano's career was catapulted to great heights on one of the largest radio shows in Kenya with millions of listeners live and online. As co-host and DJ on Riddim Base, a daily show on the pioneer reggae station Metro FM, Dj Stano's expertise gained him huge support from reggae music lovers. He also hosted Club Metro, a weekly show on the all reggae station ' Metro Fm'. Dj Stano has taken his talents worldwide with a variety of live shows in places like the UK and Dubai. Currently he hosts a weekly show \\"The Rave\\" on Venus FM. Dj Stano is also part of the Music Unit at the State Broadcaster (KBC). =Rock= Rock music has found a home to a growing fan base and with a number of locally established as well as emerging rock bands (there are over twelve active local rock bands in Nairobi alone) further cementing this genre by engaging in different as well as mutually organised rock themed events. Foreign international rock bands (Jars of Clay, Casting Crowns, 38th Parallel, Zebra & Giraffe) have also graced the local scene which reflects on the growing influence and acceptance of this genre. Organized member bodies such as Wiyathi (now defunct) and Roffeke (Rock 'n' Roll Film Festival Kenya) were fundamental in initially marketing local rock bands in the country by hosting regular shows and helped to establish a vibrant rock community. Recently, the bands also by social event groups like Kenya Rock Fans, have widely assisted the bands to gain popularity and increase their fan base, subsequently the founding of a governing body, the Rock Society of Kenya, which serves to promote the interests of member bands. The society spearheads numerous rock related events like the Battle of the Bands and live rock club shows that has spurred constructive level of activity for bands. Over the past few years many entertainment spots have also independently incorporated rock music onto their programs further indicating a genuine interest from the public. In addition there are radio stations that play rock music: 98.4 Capital FM and 105.5 X FM, the latter being a 24-hour rock station. In 2019, 105.5 X FM was shut down by the parent company Radio Africa. KTN (Str8up), STV (The Rumble) and K24 (The Rumble) also play regular weekly rock shows.

Particularly since the 20th century, musicians have been synthesizing Moroccan musical traditions with influences from around the world, such as blues, rock, metal, reggae, rap, etc. Each genre and musical style is made up of regional subgroups, and is further divided between 'modern' and 'traditional' music. Traditional music styles = Aita = Aita ( \\"call, cry or lament\\") is a popular Bedouin musical style that originates from the countryside of Morocco, especially the Atlantic plains‚Äîareas such as Doukkala-Abda, Chaouia-Ouardigha, and Rehamna. =Amazigh folk music= There are many varieties of Berber folk music and dance, such as:  Ahwash  Ahwash in the High Atlas in 1955.

Andalusi classical music ( transliterated ·π≠arab andalusi or Musiqa al-Ala, Spanish: m√∫sica andalus√≠) is a style of Arabic music found in different styles across the Maghreb (Morocco, Algeria, Tunisia, and Libya in the form of the Ma'luf style). It originated out of the music of Al-Andalus (Muslim Iberia) between the 9th and 15th centuries. Some of its poems were found to be composed by authors such as Al-Shushtari, Ibn al-Khatib and Al-Mu'tamid ibn Abbad. Andalusian music is a part of the longest traditions of art and music in the world. Andalusian music was introduced during the arrival of Ziryab, a freed Persian slave and musical pioneer, in the early 9th century. After Ziryab's death, two new styles of Arabic poetry were introduced in Al-Andalus: Muwashshahat and Zajal. = Chaabi \\"popular\\" folk music = Chaabi (, meaning popular in English) is a music consisting of numerous varieties which descend from the multifarious forms of Moroccan folk music. Chaabi was originally performed in markets, but is now found at any celebration or meeting. = Ra√Ø Music = Main article: Ra√Ø Morocco has produced its own stars like Cheb Mimoun and Hanino. Rai music originated from Algeria, but is just as effective and popular in Morocco. This style of music was created during a period of political turmoil, and served a purpose of social and political commentary. Rai music has gained massive support over the years from the urban populace for its purpose of addressing taboo topics. It was also greatly known for code switching between French and Arabic.Rai artists use this method to add to the rhetorical and aesthetic effect of the lyrics , as well as a method of opening the lyrics to a wider range of an audience. = Gnawa music = A gnawa street performer wearing traditional gnawi clothing in Rabat's Qasbat al-Widaya. Gnawa music is a mystical form of music and incantation of West African origin. It was initially brought to Morocco by Sub-Saharan Africans and gradually became part of the Moroccan musical tradition. The gnawa musicians are respected for their spiritual performances. Through oral traditions, they have handed down a specific cultural ceremony, called derdeba or lila, which consists of song, dance, the burning of incense and of specific costumes and colours. The instruments used are large drums called ‚Äútbel‚Äù or ‚Äúqanqa‚Äù and metal double castanets called ‚Äúgarageb‚Äù. The main instrument is a three-stringed bass lute, called the ‚Äúgimbri‚Äù accompanied by the chanting of the singers. =Classical Malhun= Classical Malhun is peaceful music associated with urban centers such as Meknes, Fes, Sal√©, Tetouan, and Oujda.

Much of the folk music incorporates mbira, Ngoma drums and hosho. Music has played a significant role in the history of Zimbabwe, from a vital role in the traditional Bira ceremony used to call on ancestral spirits, to protest songs during the struggle for independence. In many cultures, music has the uncanny ability to bring people closer together. For Zimbabwe's Shona community it is what links them to their culture and individual identity. Their way of life was under threat when a large colonialism movement swept through Zimbabwe. This movement forced the Shona people to leave their sacred ancestral lands, the heart of their culture. However, they fought to keep their traditions and ancestors with them through musical representation. Music has the power to influence how people behave. It can evoke certain moods, feelings, and states of mind in people. It is a universal language that can connect people to their past and spread messages. Mbira The mbira is an integral part of Zimbabwean music. Classified by musicologists as a lamellaphone, part of the plucked idiophone family, it is created from things found in nature such as a wooden board (often fitted with a resonator) and tines. It is frequently played in a deze (calabash resonator) which amplifies the sound and augments using shells or bottle caps placed around the edges. Often accompanied by the hosho, a percussion instrument, the mbira is often an important instrument that people play at religious ceremonies, weddings, and other social gatherings. The mbira plays a central role in the traditional Bira ceremony used to call on ancestral spirits. The instrument is a central piece in their religious rituals. The most important function of mbira is the idea of it being a \\"telephone to the spirits\\" during ceremonies. It is the sole way of communication between the living and deceased ancestors, ancient tribal guardians, or guardian spirits. The mbira is required to ask these spirits to bring rain during drought, stop rain during floods, and bring clouds when crops are damaged by the sun. These instruments were made from resources from the land which connected them further connects the indigenous people to their land and this deep connection has helped communities in Zimbabwe to continue their tradition of mbira music despite the development of colonialism. The sound made by this instrument closely imitates the noises made by rain or running water with rich and vibrant tones \\"like bells\\". The sound has a special presence; one that feel the music as much as one hears it. Penetrating and warming at the same time, immediately capturing the involvement of the listeners and drawing them into its mood. The pieces of music played vary by the artist but there is no specific way to play this instrument. The music performed is all about elaboration and variation supporting creative expression of the performer. Mbira player with other musicians from 1865 book Mbira dzavadzimu Hosho commonly used to accompany mbira music Though musicologist Hugh Tracey believed the mbira to be nearing extinction in the 1930s, the instrument has been revived since the 60s and 70s, and has gained an international following through the world music scene. Some renowned mbira players include Dumisani Maraire, Ephat Mujuru, Stella Chiweshe, Chartwell Dutiro, Mbuya Dyoko, Cosmas Magaya, Tute Chigamba, Forward Kwenda, and Chiwoniso Maraire. There is also pop music in Zimbabwe and around the world that incorporates Zimbabwean indigenous instruments. For example, mbira player Chris Berry with his band Panjea have reached platinum record sales in Zimbabwe and Mozambique, playing a style of music based on traditional mbira rhythms and melodies, but incorporating various other instruments and styles (like hip-hop and dancehall). Mbira is incorporated into the music of critically acclaimed American hip-hop duo Shabazz Palaces by Tendai Maraire (son of traditional mbira player Dumisani Maraire). Jit Jit is a generic term for electric guitar-driven pop, and includes popular groups like the New Black Eagles and the Four Brothers (a band UK radio DJ John Peel described as \\"the best live band in the world\\"). Internationally, The Bhundu Boys are by far the best-known jit performers, and have worked with numerous American and British musicians. Notable recent bands to come up with the Jit sound are Nehoreka who fuse the traditional Jit with funk sounds, there is also Mokoomba and Q Montana. The 1990 film Jit was named for this style.  Sungura  This is the local genre of the Zimbabwe music industry. Sungura music became popular in the early 1980s, pioneered by frontman Ephraim Joe and his band Sungura Boys which counted many notable future hit makers as members. Their roll included John Chibadura (guitar) Simon Chimbetu (guitar and vocals) Naison Chimbetu, Ronnie Chataika, Michael Jambo (drums), Ephraim Joe (guitar), Moses Marasha (bass), Never Moyo (lead guitar), Bata Sinfirio (rhythm guitar), System Tazvida (guitar and vocals, Peter Moyo (guitar and vocals). The Khiama Boys emerged as natural successors to the Sungura Boys after their demise during the mid-eighties. Members would include System Tazvida (Rhythm guitar), Nicholas Zacharia (Lead guitar), Alick Macheso (Bass), Silas Chakanyuka (Drums) and Zacharia Zakaria (Sub Rhythm guitar). A great number of these artistes have gone on to forge successful careers with their own bands whilst Nicholas Zacharia has remained as the leader of the band and is still active as of 2008. Alick Macheso performing in 2012 James Chimombe, whose romantic ballads and the influential sungura guitar melody (consisting of lead, rhythm and bass), made him a favorite in the late 80s. The 90s was dominated by musicians include Leonard Dembo, the effervescent Khiama Boys, veteran Simon Chimbetu and upcoming artistes Alick Macheso, Tongai Moyo and Somadhla Ndebele. The star of the decade was Leonard Zhakata, whose musical project was a spinoff of the double play Maungwe Brothers, an act fronted by Zhakata and his cousin Thomas Makion. The decade 2000 till present has been characterised by a wrangle for the crown for the kingship of Sungura between the two most Sungura musicians of the decade, Alick Macheso and Tongai Moyo. Having dominated sales, tour and concert attendances, the heckling and counter- heckling by the artists at shows and in some recorded material is strong proof that the current feud is far from over. Other artists to come through this decade include Joseph Garakara, Gift Amuli, Howard Pinjisi and Daiton Somanje. And of late, Alick Macheso has become popular with his dance zoraaa butter. System Tazvida, Simon Chimbetu, John Chibadura, Leonard Dembo, and Thomas Makion have all died.  Afro Jazz ( Zimbabwean Jazz)  Afro Jazz is a term used for Zimbabwean music influenced by a style of township rhythm that evolved in a Southern part of Africa over the last century. One can also trace similarities from Kwela, a pennywhistle-based, street music from the southern part of Africa with jazzy underpinnings and a distinctive, skiffle-like beat. It is also closely related to Marabi which was the name given to a keyboard style (often using cheap pedal organs) that had a musical link to American jazz, ragtime and blues, with roots deep in the African tradition. Early marabi musicians were part of an underground musical culture and were typically not recorded. An example of such an artist in the early 1940s is August Musarurwa of the Skokiaan fame. It has continued to develop and you can even see traits of this music in his grandson Prince Kudakwashe Musarurwa. Chimurenga music Chimurenga music is a genre developed by Thomas Mapfumo named for the Shona language word for struggle. Mapfumo and his band, the Blacks Unlimited developed a style of music based on traditional mbira music, but played with modern electric instrumentation, with lyrics characterized by social and political commentary. Mapfumo's music was a \\"tool of the liberation war\\" criticizing the Rhodesian government of Ian Smith, but shifted after independence to speaking out about perceived corruption and mismanagement of the Zimbabwean government of Robert Mugabe. Tuku Music Oliver \\"Tuku\\" Mtukudzi was a prolific recorder who also appeared in films like Jit. He played in a plethora of styles, and was known for penetrating lyrics; for example, he wrote a second song about AIDS in Zimbabwe after Paul Matavire's hit song \\"Yakauya AIDS iriko\\".  ZimDancehall  Mokoomba at the music festival \\"Bardentreffen\\" 2013 in Nuremberg, GermanyZimdancehall is a term used for Zimbabwean music influenced by Jamaican Dancehall music. A lot of debate is around the question of who started Zimdancehall in the country. Notable names in the genre are Souja Luv, Killer T, Enzo Ishall, Jah Signal, Winky D, Ras Caleb, Kinna, Chillspot records, Seh Calaz,freeman,Boss Pumacol,Uncle Epaton. Mokoomba at the music festival \\"Bardentreffen\\" 2013 in Nuremberg, Germany Rumba African Rumba, or 'Soukos' is mostly associated with the Democratic Republic of the Congo but its popularity has inspired Zimbabwe's own brand of rumba in musicians such as Simon Chimbetu and Leonard Karikoga Zhakata. Soukos has been an influence on other artists such as The R.U.N.N. family. Gospel Gospel music became popular in Zimbabwe in the late 1980s. Jonathan Wutawunashe has been described as \\"Zimbabwe's first real gospel star\\". Other population musicians in this genre include Jordan Chataika, Freedom Sengwayo, Mechanic Manyeruke, and Brian Sibalo. The early nineties saw the rising of new gospel stars in the mold of Ivy Kombo - Moyo and Carol Mujokoro of the EGEA gospel Train whose debut album Mufudzi Wangu was released in 1993 and contains tracks such as \\"Be Thou My Vision\\", \\"Ndotarisa Kumakomo\\" and \\"Utiziro\\" among others. The two went on to pursue successful solo musical careers and released \\"Ndaidziwanepi Nyasha\\" and \\"Ropa RaJesu\\" as their debut solo albums respectively. Gospel artists who emerged from the mid nineties include Lawrence Haisa, Brother Sam with his hits \\"Makanaka Jesu\\" and \\"Cherechedza\\", Elias Musakwa, Rita Shonhiwa, The Gospel Trumpet of the \\"Rose Of Sharon\\" fame and Shingisai Suluma who only became popular in the early 21st century with the hit song \\"Mirira Mangwanani\\"; though she first recorded in the nineties. In the late-nineties, Charles Charamba, a rising artist, grew in popularity, and currently holds gospel sales records. His music became popular into the first decade of the 21st century, most likely due to his Sungura- based contemporary style. In the early 21st century, a lot of gospel artists also recorded, though a few really rose to stardom. These include Fungisai Zvakavapano - Mashavave who has risen to become the most dominant female gospel musician in the current era, Stanley Gwanzura (Pastor Gee), Kudzai Nyakudya and gospel a cappella outfits like Vabati VaJehovah and Shower Power. Bulawayo The Ndebele-dominated region of the southwest of Zimbabwe, including the city Bulawayo, has been instrumental in the development of Zimbabwean music. Seminal 1950s guitarist George Sibanda had a following across Africa and was the writer for the hit song Guabi Guabi which is sang all over the world, and Dorothy Masuka was a major player on the South African jazz scene, for example. Among the most popular performers of the region within Zimbabwe, however, was 1980s Ndebele pop sensation Lovemore Majaivana. Ndebele musicians who are active are Black Umfolosi, Insingizi Majahawodwa Ndlovu, Sandra Ndebele, Lwazi Tshabangu, Kuxxman, Go Boyz, Achuzi, Beate Mangethe, Vusa Mkhaya, Afrika Revenge and Ramadu. The marginalisation of Bulawayo artists in Zimbabwe saw the influence of South African music dominating hence the emergence of kwaito music in Bulawayo pioneered by Go- Boyz in 1996 and more groups like GTI, Achuzi, Amagangsters, etc., emerged. A brand of Jazz was created in Bulawayo, in the 1940s and 1950s, and was made popular by August Musarurwa with his African Dance Band of the Cold Storage Commission of Southern Rhodesia. He recorded the legendary song Sikokiana which went on to be recorded in USA by Louis Armstrong and many others. Lyrics Zimbabwean musicians' lyrics mostly contain encouragement of upholding good social values in the family and society as whole. Such lyrics can be seen in songs by artists like Oliver Mtukudzi, Simon Chimbetu, Nehoreka Louis Mhlanga, John Chibadura, Steve Makoni, Bhundu Boys and many others. Of note however is Thomas Mapfumo, whose lyrics are mainly political and encourage good leadership and rising against bad governance - Most of his albums are named after a word meaning Uprising or War of Liberation, \\"Chimurenga\\". His music has earned him the wrath of the ZANU-PF government resulting in the banning of most of his music on state owned radio and TV. Another outstanding musician with striking lyrics is the late System Tazvida of the Chazezesa Challengers. His lyrics were mainly centered on the subject of \\"Love\\" and this gained him popularity with songs like \\"Anodyiwa Haataure\\", \\"Ukarambwa Usachema\\", \\"Vanotipedzera Mashoko\\" and \\"Dai Hanzvadzi Yairoorwa\\". With the coming of \\"Urban Grooves\\" the lyrics content resembles that of American RnB, Hip Hop and Pop music which the younger generations listen to. One artist Maskiri is known for imitating Eminem's style of controversial lyrics. Urban Grooves Coming on the music scene in the late 1990s and early 2000s, Urban Grooves takes in American Rap, Hip Hop, R&B;, Soul and other international music genres, often melded with traditional Zimbabwean music. Artists such as Sanii Makhalima, Roy and Royce, David Chifunyise, Leonard Mapfumo, Roki, Stach, Betty Makaya, Extra Large, Maskiri, Kactus and Nehoreka laid the groundwork for the new genre, which gained increasing popularity among the youth. The style was helped by the 100% local content policy in effect at the time, which required all radio stations to play only music by Zimbabwean artists. A second generation of artists such as Alexio Kawara, Drum Dada, Q Montana, Mokoomba and Nehoreka have come to prominence more recently.

It is usually translated as a commandery. Countries around China have adopted administrative divisions based on or named after the j√πn. History and development Commanderies of Qin Dynasty. =China= Eastern Zhou During the Eastern Zhou's Spring and Autumn period from the 8th to 5th centuries BCE, the larger and more powerful of the Zhou's vassal states--including Qin, Jin and Wei--began annexing their smaller rivals. These new lands were not part of their original fiefs and were instead organized into counties (xi√†n). Eventually, jun were developed as marchlands between the major realms. Despite having smaller populations and ranking lower on the official hierarchies, the jun were larger and boasted greater military strength than the counties. As each state's territory gradually took shape in the 5th- to 3rd-century BCE Warring States period, the jun at the borders flourished. This gave rise to a two-tier administrative system with counties subordinate to jun. Each of the states' territories was by now comparatively larger, hence there was no need for the military might of a jun in the inner regions where counties were established. The border jun's military and strategic significance became more important than those of counties.Shi Ji vol. 71. Qin dynasty Following the unification of China in 221 BCE under the Qin Empire, the Qin government still had to engage in military activity because there were rebels from among the six former states who were unwilling to submit to Qin rule. As a result, the First Emperor set up 36 jun in the Qin Empire, each subdivided into counties. This established the first two-tier administrative system known to exist in China. Han dynasty and Three Kingdoms period When the Han dynasty triumphed over Chu in 206 BCE, the Zhou feudal system was initially reinstated, with Emperor Gao recognizing nearly independent kings and granting large territories to his relatives. These two sets of kingdoms were placed under hereditary rulers assisted by a chancellor (xi√†ng). Parallel to these, some Qin jun were continued, placed under a governor appointed directly by the central government. By the Eastern Han dynasty, the jun were subordinated to a new division, the province (zh≈çu). -- establishing a three-tier system composed of provinces (zhou), commanderies (jun), and counties (xian). Based upon legendary accounts of the Yellow Emperor's Nine Provinces which were geographic rather than formal political areas, there were initially 13 zh≈çu and roughly 100 jun. Jin dynasty and the Southern and Northern Dynasties China was greatly divided during the following five centuries, during the Jin and Southern and Northern Dynasties period. The number of administrative units drastically increased due to intense warfare, fluid political boundaries, forced migrations, widespread population loss, and the loss of central government control in many areas particularly during the Sixteen Kingdoms. Although the legacy three-tier system was still in formal effect, rulers of various kingdoms had defined and re-defined provinces until they became increasingly sub-divided, blurring the distinction between provinces (zhou) and commanderies (jun) and reflecting the chaos of China at the time. Sui and Tang dynasties China was finally re-united by Emperor Wen of the Sui (581‚Äì618) in 589. As there were already over 100 provinces, the province and commandery levels of the administration were merged into one level, typically rendered in English as prefecture, marking the end of the commandery. Some Emperors preferred \\"jun\\" to refer to this level of administration, but most used \\"zhou\\" and the political function was the same, regardless. By the end of the Tang Dynasty the term jun saw no more use in China (and a new higher tier of administrative unit, the circuit (dao) had been introduced, bringing back a three-tier system). =Taiwan (1920‚Äì1945)= During 1920‚Äì1945, when Taiwan was under Japanese rule, there were divisions called ÈÉ° (Mandarin: j√πn, Japanese: gun). They are based on the Districts of Japan (ÈÉ° gun), which in turn were based on ancient Chinese j√πn. Their officers were known as ÈÉ°ÂÆà (Mandarin: j√πnsh«íu, Japanese: gunshu). This was the title of ancient administrators of the Chinese jun (see below), and had never existed in Japan. By the end of 1945, there were 51 jun/kun in Taiwan. Administrative hierarchy In the Warring States period, the chief administrative officers of the areas were known as jun administrators (, , literally \\"defender of the jun\\"). In the Han dynasty, the position of junshou was renamed grand administrator (, . \\"Grand Defender\\"). Both terms are also translated as \\"governor\\". A grand administrator drew an annual salary of 2,000 dan () of grain according to the pinzhi (, p«ênzh√¨) system of administrative rank. Many former grand administrators were promoted to the posts of the Three Ducal Ministers or Nine Ministers later in their careers.  Other uses  In contemporary Chinese language, the word is also used to translate the administrative division Shire in English language. The counties of the United Kingdom and the United States are also translated as j√πn.

Reruns of the show aired in daily syndication from 1978 to 1985 as part of the \\"Krofft Superstars\\" package with six other Krofft series. The show features a musical group composed of four British teenagers in insect-themed outfits, constantly beset by the evil machinations of the talent-challenged Benita Bizarre, played by comedian Martha Raye.CD liner notes: Saturday Mornings: Cartoons‚Äô Greatest Hits, 1995 MCA Records Premise The show takes place in the fantasy setting of Tranquility Forest. The central characters are a popular band of teenage musicians named the Bugaloos, who wear insect-themed outfits with wings and antennae, and can fly using their wings (although they are occasionally shown flying on surfboards). Though peace-loving and hippie- like, the Bugaloos are pursued by an ugly, evil, jealous old crone named Benita Bizarre, who lives in a gigantic jukebox, and uses it to broadcast her own brand of blaring, obnoxious, unpleasant \\"music\\". A dreadful singer, she is furious at the popularity of the Bugaloos's more melodic, upbeat sound, and she plots elaborate, unsuccessful schemes to destroy or enslave them. She frequently makes use of a powerful ultrasonic weapon called the Stereo Zapper, which can render its victim unconscious in seconds. The Bugaloos are sometimes seen traveling around in their \\"Bugaloo Buggy\\", a colorful dune buggy custom made for the show by car builder George Barris.http://www.bugaloos.com/barris.html Production and airing alt= Touted as the British version of The Monkees, The Bugaloos attracted more than 5,000 young actors and actresses to audition in spring 1970 for the show's four lead roles, each having to demonstrate aptitude in dance, singing, and acting. Among those auditioning were Elton John's future manager John Reid, and Phil Collins, who joined the art rock band Genesis later that year.Dave Itzkoff. \\"A Band With the Life Span of an Ant.\\" The New York Times, July 30, 2006, page 28, column 1.Phil Collins listing on imdb.com (Accessed October 17, 2007) Reid and Collins were two of the three finalists for the role of \\"I.Q.\\" given to Scottish musician John McIndoe. \\"If one of those guys had gotten it instead of me, rock-'n'-roll history might have changed,\\" McIndoe later joked. \\"Whenever I see them, I say, 'Hey guys, you were lucky you didn't get the part'.\\"Mike Hughes. \\"Phil Collins on 'Live By Request.'\\" The Seattle Times, October 1, 1998, page E4. The show was taped in Los Angeles, California. Seventeen episodes of the series were produced. Like its predecessor H.R. Pufnstuf (1969), The Bugaloos ran for only one season (1970‚Äì1971) on NBC, with reruns airing the following year (1971‚Äì1972). Following production of the first season, the Kroffts tried shooting for a second season, and also had a movie deal in the works with Columbia Pictures. However, miscommunication with the actors resulted in their returning to the UK that December, against the Kroffts' wishes. As a result, a potential second season was ultimately scrapped, along with plans for a movie which was shelved due to the bankruptcy of Columbia Pictures. Although the show featured British actors, it was not screened in the UK. The Bugaloos was fitted with an adult laugh track, as was common practice at the time ‚Äî the inclusion of which the Kroffts were initially against. Sid Krofft commented \\"We were sort of against that, but Si Rose ‚Äî being in sitcoms ‚Äî he felt that when the show was put together that the children would not know when to laugh.\\" Marty Krofft added \\"the bottom line ‚Äî it's sad ‚Äî you gotta tell them when it's funny. And the laugh track, (Si) was right. It was necessary, as much as we were always looking to have a real laugh track, a real audience. In comedies, if you don't have them (laugh track), you're in big trouble, because if you don't hear a laugh track, it's not funny. And that's the way the audience (at home) was programmed to view these shows.\\" When discussing the show's production techniques for the DVD commentary track in 2006, series stars Caroline Ellis and John Philpott addressed the laugh track. \\"I was never one for the American canned laughter, because sometimes it's too much,\\" said Ellis. She added, however, that it does help in creating \\"the atmosphere for the reaction.\\" Philpott added that, unlike their UK counterparts, US viewing audiences at the time had become accustomed to hearing laughter, saying, \\"I think you find yourself genuinely laughing more if you are prompted to laugh along with the canned laughter.\\" Characters =The Bugaloos= * I.Q.

Music  The show's music director was Hal Yoergler, who also wrote many of the show's songs and produced the Bugaloos album released in 1970. The title song's lyrics were written by Norman Gimbel, and its music was composed by Charles Fox. Gimbel and Fox were also the songwriters of \\"Killing Me Softly with His Song\\" and the theme songs to films and programs such as Last American Hero (\\"I Got A Name,\\" sung by Jim Croce), Happy Days, Laverne and Shirley, and The New Adventures of Wonder Woman. A cover of the Bugaloos theme performed by Collective Soul is included on the 1995 tribute album Saturday Morning: Cartoons' Greatest Hits, produced by Ralph Sall for MCA Records. The Bugaloos released an album in 1970 (Capitol Records ST-621), featuring studio-recorded versions of some of the songs performed on the show. The track list is as follows: Side 1 # \\"If You Become a Bugaloo\\" # \\"The Senses of Our World\\" # \\"For a Friend\\" # \\"Believe\\" # \\"It's New to You\\" Side 2 # \\"Fly Away With Us\\" # \\"Older Woman\\" # \\"Just the Memory Stays Around\\" # \\"Gna Gna Gna Gna Gna\\" # \\"Castles in the Air\\" # \\"The Bugaloos (Theme Song)\\" One single was released in conjunction with the album: \\"For a Friend\\"/\\"The Senses of Our World\\" (Capitol 2946). \\"For a Friend\\" charted as a minor hit, appearing on Billboard the week of December 18, 1970, at No. 118. The track \\"Just the Memory Stays Around\\" did not appear in any episode, and is available only on the LP. The LP was re-released on CD in January 2000 by Vivid Sound in Japan and in 2006 by Cherry Red Records of London. The Bugaloos recorded 15 songs. In addition to the 11 that appear on the released album, four additional songs appeared on the television show, but remain unreleased: # \\"Sparky\\" # \\"I'm As Happy As Can Be\\" # \\"I Really Love You\\" # \\"Flicker Town\\" Episodes Home release The complete Bugaloos series was released on DVD in May 2006 by Rhino Entertainment. The set contained all 17 digitally remastered, original uncut broadcast episodes, with audio commentary on the pilot episode from creator Sid Krofft and director Tony Charmoli. Cast members John Philpott, Caroline Ellis, and John McIndoe also provided audio commentary on some episodes and participated in interviews. Also included were a video jukebox with a selection of songs from the episodes, a photo gallery, and a Bugaloos Interactive I. Q. Test, hosted by McIndoe. Revival At Comic Con 2015, Sid and Marty Krofft revealed they were looking to create an updated version of The Bugaloos as a preschool television series. It was rumored Cyndi Lauper would portray Benita Bizarre. At 2017's Comic Con, they released a teaser trailer of the pilot produced for Nickelodeon with clips of the new series with Lise Simms as Benita Bizarre. However, during a May 2018 radio interview with creator Marty Krofft, Marty revealed that the pilot was not picked up by Nickelodeon and was scrapped. He said they were reshooting the pilot and that Randy Jackson will be involved with the music. In popular culture The Bugaloos are the binding childhood memory that the two main protagonists in the 2000 film The Tao of Steve discover as they begin to bond, as Syd (Greer Goodman) and Dex (Donal Logue) find out that they both had Bugaloos stickers on their respective childhood Josie and the Pussycats lunchboxes.

South Africa has a global music industry.  Pre-20th-century history  Early records of music in southern Africa indicate a fusion of cultural traditions: yo bro https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Music_of_South_Africa&action;=edit&section;=1African, European and Asian. Compare: Modern country's early musician Enoch Sontonga wrote the Southern African national anthem Nkosi Sikelel' iAfrika in 1897. By the end of the nineteenth century, South African cities such as Cape Town were large enough to attract foreign musicians, especially American ragtime players. In the 1890s Orpheus McAdoo's Jubilee Singers popularised African- American spirituals. Marabi In the early-twentieth century governmental restrictions on black people increased, including a nightly curfew which kept the nightlife in Johannesburg relatively small for a city of its size (then the largest city south of the Sahara). Marabi, a style from the slums of Johannesburg, was the early \\"popular music\\" of the townships and urban centres of South Africa. Practitioners played marabi on pianos with accompaniment from pebble-filled cans, often in shebeens, establishments that illegally served alcohol to black people. By the 1930s, however, marabi had incorporated new instruments - guitars, concertinas and banjos - and new styles of marabi had sprung up. These included a marabi/swing fusion called African jazz and jive, a generic term for any popular marabi style of music. Pre war, in the 1930s, when Eric Gallo's Brunswick Gramophone HouseRichard Smirke, \\"WMG Launches Warner Music South Africa (Exclusive)\\", Billboard, 5 December 2013. sent several South African musicians to London to record for Singer Records. Gallo went on to produce music in South Africa, beginning in 1933. His company, Gallo Record Company, remains the largest and most successful label in South Africa, having had acclaimed artists such as Solomon Linda, Ladysmith Black Mambazo, Miriam Makeba, Mahlathini and the Mahotella Queens and many more pass through the recording studios. Marabi, which happens to be a keyboard style of play traceable to the 1920s are mostly made up of Jazz with instruments like like guitar and banjo Desmond Henry, \\"Evolution of South African Music Industry\\", Newsnobs, 24th March 2020. Gospel In the early twentieth century, Zionist Christian churches spread across South Africa. They incorporated African musical elements into their worship, thus inventing South African gospel music which remains one of the most popular forms of music in the country today. Classical and art music Classical and art music in South Africa reached its zenith of popularity in the mid-20th century and was primarily composed by a triumvirate of Afrikaner composers known as the \\"fathers of South African art music.\\"Stefanus Muller and Chris Walton, 2006, p. 3. A Composer in Africa: Essays on the life and work of Stefans Grov√© These composers were Arnold van Wyk, Hubert du Plessis, and Stefans Grov√©. All three composers were White South Africans, yet harbored very different views on Apartheid, which was state policy at the time. Stefans Grov√© was one of the first white composers to incorporate Black African music into his compositions, and openly rejected apartheid ideals in an effort to fuse his \\"Western art and his physical, African space.\\" Arnold Van Wyk became known for his government-endorsed nationalistic compositions, though he himself was reluctant to support the apartheid administration. Hubert Du Plessis, on the other hand, was a very strong Afrikaner nationalist, and experienced a \\"growing consciousness\\" of his heritage which made him proud to compose such pieces. Du Plessis' works included chamber music, orchestral pieces, and many pieces for the piano. =Afrikaans music= Afrikaans music was primarily influenced by Dutch folk styles, along with French and German influences, in the early twentieth century. Zydeco-type string bands led by a concertina were popular, as were elements of American country music, especially Jim Reeves. The most prolific composers of \\"tiekie draai\\" Afrikaans music were lyricist Anton De Waal who wrote many hit songs with songwriters, pianist Charles Segal (\\"Hey Babariebab Se Ding Is Vim\\", \\"Kalkoenjie\\", \\"Sy Kom Van Kommetjie\\" and many others) and accordionist, Nico Carstens. Bushveld music based on the Zulu were reinterpreted by such singers as Marais and Miranda. Melodramatic and sentimental songs called trane trekkers (tearjerkers) were especially common. In 1973, a country music song won the coveted SARI Award (South African Music Industry) for the Song of the Year ‚Äì \\"My Children, My Wife\\" was written by renowned South African composer Charles Segal and lyricist Arthur Roos. In 1979 the South African Music scene changed from the Tranetrekkers to more lively sounds and the introduction of new names in the market with the likes of Anton Goosen, David Kramer (singer), Koos du Plessis, Fanie de Jager, Flaming Victory and Laurika Rauch. Afrikaans music is currently one of the most popular and best selling industries on the South African music scene. Waptrendz is a big collection of the Afrikaans music. After World War I, Afrikaner nationalism spread and such musicians as Jewish pianist and composer Charles Segal and accordionist Nico Carstens were popular. The 1930s =A cappella= The 1930s saw the spread of Zulu a cappella singing from the Natal area to much of South Africa. The style's popularity, finally producing a major star in 1939 with Solomon Linda's Original Evening Birds, whose \\"Mbube\\" (\\"The Lion\\") was probably the first African recording to sell more than 100,000 copies. It also provided the basis for two further American pop hits, The Weavers' \\"Wimoweh\\" (1951) and The Tokens' \\"The Lion Sleeps Tonight\\" (1961). Linda's music was in a style that came to be known as mbube. From the late 1940s to the 1960s, a harsh, strident form called isikhwela jo was popular, though national interest waned in the 1950s until Radio Zulu began broadcasting to Natal, Transvaal and the Orange Free State in 1962 (see 1950s: Bantu Radio and pennywhistle for more details). Also formed in this era was the Stellenbosch University Choir, part of the University of Stellenbosch, the oldest running choir in the country and was formed in 1936 by William Morris, also the first conductor of the Choir. The current conductor is Andre van der Merwe. They specialise in a cappella music and consist of students from the University. The 1950s =Bantu Radio and the music industry= By the 1950s, the music industry had diversified greatly, and included several major labels. Innovative musician and composer, Charles Segal was the first white musician to work with the indigenous African people, recording tribal performers and promoting African music overseas starting in the 1950s. Charles Segal was also the first white musician to write in the indigenous African style and to bring the African music genre into the commercial market. His single \\"Africa\\" was a hit amongst the diverse South African population in the 1960s and he continued to produce, record and teach his own unique style of African music, which was a mix of African and Jazz influences. These compositions include \\"Opus Africa\\", \\"African Fantasy\\", \\"Kootanda\\" and many more. In 1962, the South African government launched a development programme for Bantu Radio in order to foster separate development and encourage independence for the Bantustans. Though the government had expected Bantu Radio to play folk music, African music had developed into numerous pop genres, and the nascent recording studios used radio to push their pop stars. The new focus on radio led to a government crackdown on lyrics, censoring songs which were considered a \\"public hazard\\". =Pennywhistle jive= The first major style of South African popular music to emerge was pennywhistle jive (later known as kwela). Black cattle-herders had long played a three- holed reed flute, adopting a six-holed flute when they moved to the cities. Willard Cele is usually credited with creating pennywhistle by placing the six-holed flute between his teeth at an angle. Cele spawned a legion of imitators and fans, especially after appearing in the 1951 film The Magic Garden (film). Groups of flautists played on the streets of South African cities in the 1950s, many of them in white areas, where police would arrest them for creating a public disturbance. Some young whites were attracted to the music, and came to be known as ducktails. The 1950s also saw 'coloured' bands develop the new genre of Quela, a hybrid of South African Squares and modern samba.Grant Olwage, Composing apartheid: music for and against apartheid, 2008, p. 89: \\"In 1956, Todd Matshikiza explained the new genre: \\"Something different happened among the Coloured bands. They've stopped playing 'Squares a specialty.' A new style, the Quela (pronounced kwela), has evolved. Quela is the brainchild of the squares and the modern samba...\\" Once again, we see the cross-over between white, Afrikaans music and the indigenous South Africa music in the compositions of pianist and composer, Charles Segal, with his penny whistle hits including \\"Kwela Kwela\\" and many others. The 1960s In the 1960s, a smooth form of mbube called cothoza mfana developed, led by the King Star Brothers, who invented isicathamiya style by the end of the decade. By the 1960s, the saxophone was commonplace in jive music, the performance of which continued to be restricted to townships. The genre was called sax jive and later mbaqanga. Mbaqanga literally means dumpling but implies home-made and was coined by Michael Xaba, a jazz saxophonist who did not like the new style. The early 1960s also saw performers such as bassist Joseph Makwela and guitarist Marks Mankwane add electric instruments and marabi and kwela influences to the mbaqanga style, leading to a funkier and more African sound. Mbaqanga developed vocal harmonies during the very early 1960s when groups including The Skylarks and the Manhattan Brothers began copying American vocal bands, mostly doo wop. Rather than African-American four-part harmonies, however, South African bands used five parts. The Dark City Sisters were the most popular vocal group in the early 1960s, known for their sweet style. Aaron Jack Lerole of Black Mambazo added groaning male vocals to the female harmonies, later being replaced by Simon 'Mahlathini' Nkabinde, who has become perhaps the most influential and well-known South African \\"groaner\\" of the twentieth century. Marks Mankwane and Joseph Makwela's mbaqanga innovations evolved into the more danceable mgqashiyo sound when the two joined forces with Mahlathini and the new female group Mahotella Queens, in Mankwane's backing group Makhona Tsohle Band (also featuring Makwela along with saxophonist-turned-producer West Nkosi, rhythm guitarist Vivian Ngubane, and drummer Lucky Monama). The Mahlathini and the Mahotella Queens/Makhona Tsohle outfit recorded as a studio unit for Gallo Record Company, to great national success, pioneering mgqashiyo music all over the country to equal success. In 1967 Miriam Makeba released US hit \\"Pata Pata\\". 1967,Izintombi Zesi Manje Manje, an mgqashiyo female group that provided intense competition for Mahotella Queens. Both groups were massive competitors in the jive field, though the Queens usually came out on top. =Soul and jazz= The late 1960s saw the rise of soul music from the United States. Wilson Pickett and Percy Sledge were among singers who were especially popular and inspired South African performers to enter the field with an organ, a bass-and-drum rhythm section and an electric guitar. In the 1960s jazz split into two fields. Dance bands like the Elite Swingsters were popular, while avant-garde jazz inspired by the work of John Coltrane, Thelonious Monk and Sonny Rollins was also common. The latter field of musicians included prominent activists and thinkers, including Hugh Masekela, Abdullah Ibrahim (formerly known as 'Dollar Brand'), Kippie Moeketsi, Sathima Bea Benjamin, Chris McGregor, Johnny Dyani and Jonas Gwangwa. In 1959, American pianist John Mehegan organised a recording session using many of the most prominent South African jazz musicians, resulting in the first two African jazz LPs. The following year saw the Cold Castle National Jazz Festival, which brought additional attention to South African jazz. Cold Castle became an annual event for a few years, and brought out more musicians, especially Dudu Pukwana, Gideon Nxumalo and Chris McGregor. The 1963 festival produced a LP called Jazz The African Sound, but government oppression soon ended the jazz scene. Again, many musicians emigrated or went into exile in the UK or other countries. In 1968 Hugh Masekela got big hit \\"Grazing in the Grass\\", and it reached No.1 on Billboard pop chart. While the African jazz of the north of South Africa was being promoted in Johannesburg, musicians in Cape Town were awakening to their jazz heritage. Pianist Charles Segal, who had moved from Pretoria to Cape Town, brought an enthusiasm for jazz after several trips to the US, where he met and was influenced by the jazz pianist Oscar Peterson. The port city had a long history of musical interaction with seafaring players. The rise of the Coon Carnival and the visionary talent of Abdullah Ibrahim (Dollar Brand) and his sax players Basil Coetzee and Robbie Jansen led to Cape Jazz. It was an improvised version of their folk songs with musical reference to European and American jazz which would go on some 20 years later to be South Africa's most important jazz export. The 1970s =Mgqashiyo and Isicathamiya= By the 1970s, only a few long-standing mgqashiyo groups were well-known, with the only new groups finding success with an all-male line-up. Abafana Baseqhudeni and Boyoyo Boys were perhaps the biggest new stars of this period. The Mahotella Queens' members began leaving the line-up around 1971 for rival groups. Gallo, by far the biggest record company in South Africa, began to create a new Mahotella Queens line-up, recording them with Abafana Baseqhudeni. Lead groaner Mahlathini had already moved to rival label EMI (in early 1972), where he had successful records with backing team Ndlondlo Bashise and new female group the Mahlathini Girls. The new Mahotella Queens line-up over at Gallo found just as much success as the original Queens, recording on-and-off with new male groaners such as Robert Mbazo Mkhize of Abafana Baseqhudeni. Ladysmith Black Mambazo, headed by the sweet soprano of Joseph Shabalala, arose in the 1960s, and became perhaps the biggest isicathamiya stars in South Africa's history. Their first album was 1973's Amabutho, which was also the first gold record by black musicians; it sold over 25,000 copies. Ladysmith Black Mambazo remained popular throughout the next few decades, especially after 1986, when Paul Simon, an American musician, included Ladysmith Black Mambazo on his extremely popular Graceland album and its subsequent tour of 1987. With progressive jazz hindered by governmental suppression, marabi-styled dance bands rose to more critical prominence in the jazz world. The music became more complex and retained popularity, while progressive jazz produced only occasional hits, such as Winston Ngozi's \\"Yakal Nkomo\\" and Abdullah Ibrahim's \\"Mannenberg\\". =Punk rock= During the punk rock boom of the late 1970s, UK and American punk music influenced South African bands, such as Wild Youth and Powerage and gained a cult following, focused in Durban and in and around Johannesburg. Bands such as Dog Detachment and The Radio Rats and Young Dumb & Violent had a similar following on the fringes of the music scene. Cape Town had a big following with Safari Suits, Housewife's Choice, The Lancaster Band, The News and Permanent Force (aka Private File after BOSS intervention), soon followed by The Rude Dementals, The Zero's, Fred Smith Band, Red Army, Riot Squad, Injury Time and The Vipers. In Cape Town many gigs took place at \\"Scratch\\" Club (run by Gerry Dixon and Henry Coombes), 1886, UCT, Off The Road, numerous town halls and other local venues. Some of the aforementioned bands passed through on tours. The \\"RIOT ROCK\\" tour of December 1979 being a culmination of the period. =Disco= In the middle of the 1970s, American disco was imported to South Africa, and disco beats were added to soul music, which helped bring a halt to popular mbaqanga bands such as the Mahotella Queens. In 1976, South African children rebelled en masse against apartheid and governmental authority, and a vibrant, youthful counterculture was created, with music as an integral part of its focus. Styles from before the 1970s fusion of disco and soul were not widely regarded, and were perceived as being sanctioned by the white oppressors. Few South African bands gained a lasting success during this period, however, with the exception of the Movers, who used marabi elements in their soul. The Movers were followed by the Soul Brothers, and the instrumental band The Cannibals, who soon began working with singer Jacob \\"Mpharanyana\\" Radebe. The coloured (not black) band The Flames also gained a following, and soon contributed two members (Blondie Chaplin and Ricky Fataar) to American band The Beach Boys. Harari arose in their place, eventually moving to an almost entirely rock and roll sound. One of Harare's members, Sipho 'Hotstix' Mabuse became a superstar in the 1980s. =Rock= There was a thriving, mostly white, rock music scene in Cape Town in the 1970s. The album McCully Workshop Inc. from the psychedelic rock band McCully Workshop is a good example the genre on Trutone Records. The Trutone label was owned by South African company Gallo (Africa) Limited an internationally recognised music producer. The 1980s =Alternative rock and Afrikaans= The early 1980s brought popular attention on alternative rock bands such as The Usual and Scooter's Union. In and around Johannesburg the growth of the independent music scene led to not just a surge of bands ranging from big names (relatively speaking) Tribe after Tribe, The Dynamics, The Softies and the Spectres through to smaller hopefuls What Colours, Days Before and No Exit, but also to the growth of a vibrant DIY fanzine scene with \\"Palladium\\" and \\"One Page to Many\\" two titles of note. South African alternative rock grew more mainstream with two leading bands, Asylum Kids from Johannesburg and Peach from Durban having chart success and releasing critically acclaimed albums. The burgeoning music scene around Johannesburg saw a surge of small bands, inspired and informed by the UK DIY punk ethic, form and start performing at a growing number of venues from clubs the likes of Metalbeat, Bluebeat, King of Clubs, DV8 and Dirtbox to student run venues such as GR Bozzoli Hall and later the Free People Concert on the University of the Witwatersrand campus. One artist of specific note to come from this era was James Phillips who was involved with several influential and important bands including Corporal Punishment; Cherry Faced Lurchers; and his Afrikaans alter ego Bernoldus Niemand (roughly translates as Bernard Nobody). With his Bernoldus Niemand character, James managed to cross the language division and influence a whole range of Afrikaans speaking musicians to the same punk ethic that had inspired him, and an important Afrikaans alternative rock scene grew from this influence. During this period, the only Afrikaners to achieve much mainstream fame were Anton Goosen, a rock singer-songwriter, and Bles Bridges, an imitator of American lounge singer Wayne Newton. =Gothic rock= In 1983, Dog Detachment was one of the earliest groups which combined Post-Punk music with elements of Gothic rock. South Africa's first Gothic rock band was No Friends of Harry, formed in the mid-1980s. Other notable bands from the second half of the 1980s are The Gathering (not to be confused with the Dutch Metal band), The Death Flowers of No-cypher, Lidice, The Attic Muse, The Autumn Ritual, The Elephant Celebes and Penguins in Bondage. In 1995, The Awakening was formed by vocalist, guitarist and producer Ashton Nyte. The band is credited in major national press as \\"South Africa's most successful Gothic Rock act and one of the top bands in the far broader Alternative scene\\" and headlined major national festivals throughout South Africa, including the country's largest music festival Woodstock, in addition to Oppikoppi and RAMFest. With more than a dozen top ten national singles between 1998 and 2007, The Awakening were the first goth-styled act to have major success in South Africa. Another notable goth artist was The Eternal Chapter, which had a hit with the cover \\"Here comes the man\\", originally by Boom Boom Room. = Pop = P J Powers won the 1986 Song for South Africa competition, the first one run by the SABC. It aimed to promote South African music. The winning song was Don Clarke's Sanbonani. The final round was televised on national TV, with P J Powers supported by her band, Hotline. Sanbonani featured on the P J Powers and Hotline Greatest Hits album in 1991. =International attention= The original Mahotella Queens line-up reunited with Mahlathini and the Makgona Tsohle Band in 1983, due to unexpected demand from mgqashiyo and mbaqanga fans. Ladysmith Black Mambazo took their first step into the international arena via Paul Simon on his Graceland album in 1986, where a series of reissue albums by US label Shanachie sold very well. Mambazo became world travellers, touring the world and collaborating with various Western musicians to massive success. \\"Graceland\\" won many awards including the Grammy Award for Best Album of the Year. A year later, Simon produced Black Mambazo's first U.S. release, Shaka Zulu, which won the Grammy Award, in 1988, for Best Traditional Folk Album. Since then, and in total, the group has received fifteen Grammy Award Nominations and three Grammy Award wins, including one in 2009. The Graceland album not only propelled Mambazo into the spotlight, but paved the way for other South African acts (including Mahlathini and the Queens, Amaswazi Emvelo, Moses Mchunu, Ray Phiri and Stimela, The Mighty Soul beat and others) to become known worldwide as well. World in Union, the Ladysmith Black Mambazo record feat. P J Powers, became an international hit record in 1995. It charted in the UK (no 47 on the singles charts). Johnny Clegg got his start in the 1970s playing Zulu-traditional music with Sipho Mchunu, and became prominent as the only major white musician playing traditional black music, achieving success in France as \\"Le Zoulou Blanc\\" (The White Zulu). The 1980s also saw a resurgence in rock and roll bands, among them The Helicopters, Petit Cheval, Sterling and Tellinger. Mango Groove has racked up a host of achievements throughout the years, and has firmly established itself as one of South Africa‚Äôs most recognised and loved music icons. The group exploded into the national consciousness with the release of its 10 times Platinum debut album in 1989. Taking SA music to the world: Amongst other things, this included Mango Groove being the only South African act invited to perform at the 1997 handover of Hong Kong to China, being the only South African act featured on The Freddy Mercury Tribute concert (broadcast to over a billion people), appearing in front of 200 000 people at the SOS Racisme concert in Paris and receiving 3 encores at the Montrieux Jazz Festival. = Reggae = The most lasting change, however, may have been the importation of reggae from Jamaica. Following international superstar Bob Marley's concert celebrating Zimbabwe's independence in 1980, reggae took hold across Africa. Lucky Dube was the first major South African artists; his style was modelled most closely on that of Peter Tosh. Into the 1990s, Lucky Dube was one of the best-selling artists in South African history, especially his 1990 album Slave. The 1990s also saw Jamaican music move towards ragga, an electronic style that was more influential on kwaito (South African hip hop music) than reggae. A group from the Free State called Oyaba also emerged during this period. Their best known hit songs are Tomorrow Nation, Paradise and Love Crazy. Reggae became quite popular and there was also a singer from KwaZulu-Natal, Sipho Johnson known as Jambo. =Bubblegum= Bubblegum was a form of pure South African pop music that arose in the middle of the 1980s, distinctively based on vocals with overlapping call-and-response vocals. Electronic keyboards and synthesisers were commonplace. Dan Tshanda of the band Splash was the first major bubblegum star, followed by Chicco Twala. Twala introduced some politically oriented lyrics, such as \\"We Miss You Manelo\\" (a coded tribute to Nelson Mandela) and \\"Papa Stop the War\\", a collaboration with Mzwakhe Mbuli. In 1983 a major new South African star was born, Brenda Fassie. Her single, \\"Weekend Special\\", announced her as the pre-eminent female South African vocalist of her generation. She remained unmatched in popularity, talent until her untimely death in 2004. The late 1980s saw the rise of Yvonne Chaka Chaka, beginning with her 1984 hit \\"I'm In Love With a DJ\\", which was the first major hit for bubblegum. Her popularity rose into the 1990s, especially across the rest of Africa and into Europe. Jabu Khanyile's Bayete and teen heart-throb Ringo have also become very popular. =The Vo√´lvry movement= Afrikaans-language music saw a resurgence in the 1980s as the Vo√´lvry (\\"free as a bird\\" or \\"outlawed\\") movement reflected a new Afrikaans artistic counter-culture largely hostile to the values of the National Party and conservative Afrikanerdom. Spearheaded by the singer-songwriter Johannes Kerkorrel and his Gereformeerde Blues Band, the movement (which was named after Kerkorrel's 1989 regional tour) also included musicians Bernoldus Niemand (aka James Phillips) and Koos Kombuis. Vo√´lvry tapped into a growing dissatisfaction with the Apartheid system amongst white Afrikaans speakers, and thus Vo√´lvry represents the musical branch of opposition that was paralleled by literature and the arts. The 1990s =New rhythms= In 1994, South African media was liberalised and new musical styles arose. Prophets of Da City became known as a premier hip hop crew, though a South Africanised style of hip hop known as kwaito soon replaced actual hip hop groups. In kwaito, synthesisers and other electronic instruments are common, and slow jams adopted from Chicago house musicians like The Fingers, Tony Humphries and Robert Owen are also standard. Stars of kwaito include Trompies, Bongo Maffin, TKZee, Mandoza and Boom Shaka. The band Tree63 also emerged, first known for their hit single, \\"A Million Lights\\" and then further popularised by their version of Matt Redman's \\"Blessed Be Your Name\\". =Gospel= The biggest star of 1990s gospel was Rebecca Malope, whose 1995 album Shwele Baba was extremely popular. Malope continues to record, in addition to performers such as Lusanda Spiritual Group, Barorisi Ba Morena, Amadodana Ase Wesile, Vuyo Mokoena and International Pentacoastal Church Choir, Rayreed Soul Beat, Lundi, Joyous Celebration, and Scent From Above who have performed in Botswana occasionally. In 2000s Vuyo Mooena has emerged as the best selling Gospel artist. His albums have been audited to be in Top 5 selling in the country. In his album he sang in all South African languages like Venda, Shangaan, Sotho, Zulu and Xhosa. The industry has also been joined by the likes of Hlengiwe Mhlaba(whose Aphendule is popular) and Solly Moholo. Also we see the new singers like Oleseng Shuping become popular and he won the king of gospel award. =Afrikaans music= Prof Piet de Villiers was the front runner prior to 1994 with his compositions of Boerneef. The period after 1994 saw a dramatic growth in the popularity of Afrikaans music. Numerous new young Afrikaans singers (soloists and groups) released CDs and DVDs and attracted large audiences at \\"kunstefeeste\\" (art festivals) such as the \\"Klein Karoo Nasionale Kunstefees ‚Äì KKNK\\" in Oudtshoorn, \\"Aardklop\\" in Potchefstroom and \\"Innibos\\" in Nelspruit. Apart from dozens of new songs being introduced into the Afrikaans music market, it became popular for modern young artists to sing old Afrikaans songs on a stage or in a pub, with crowds of young admirers singing along. The reason for the dramatic increase in the popularity of Afrikaans music can be speculated about. One theory is that the end of Apartheid in 1994 also meant the end of the privileged position that the Afrikaans culture had in South Africa. After losing the privileged protection and promotion of the language and the culture by the State, the Afrikaans- speaking community seems to have spontaneously started embracing and developing their language and culture. This was due to pop artists like Steve Hofmeyr, N√°dine, Kurt Darren, and Nicolis Louw bringing a new fresh sound in Afrikaans Music. Many of the songs sung and/or written by these artists are similar in sound to Euro dance music. Critics would claim that all an Afrikaans pop artist needs for a song to be popular is a catchy tune and an easy beat. This is due to the massive popularity of a form of couples dancing called \\"langarm\\" or \\"sokkie\\". The dance halls where this takes place could be considered as night clubs but they play almost exclusively Afrikaans pop music. The Afrikaans pop music market therefore generates tremendous demand for new material. =Alternative= The 1990s could be seen as the genesis of a vibrant alternative music scene in South Africa. The Vo√´lvry movement was a major influence in establishing the scene, but subject material markedly shifted from protest to the more abstract and personal. Major festivals like Oppikoppi and Woodstock were started and grew steadily, firmly cementing the niche under predominantly white university students exploring a newfound intellectual independence after the fall of apartheid. The first band to reach any major recognition was Springbok Nude Girls established in 1994 whose most recognisable song is the ballad 'Blue Eyes' with their iconic singer Arno Carstens. Other notable acts established in this decade were The Outsiders (est. 1991), Nine (est. 1992), Fetish, Wonderboom (est. 1996), Boo! (est. 1997), The Awakening (est. 1996), Henry Ate, Just Jinger (est. 1996), Fuzigish and Battery 9. =Metal= In the early and mid-1980s there were bands like Black Rose, Stretch, Razor, Lynx, Pentagon, Montreaux, Unchained and Osiris. Then came the new breed of South African metal with a band called Ragn√§rok, South Africa's first thrash metal band, formed by Dean G Smith who were labelled as South Africa's Metallica and the only metal band at that time to have a cult following. They formed in South Johannesburg in 1986 playing covers for a short while and then moving on to original music only. Through the late 1980s and into the early 1990s, South Africa grew a well supported metal scene, marked by the release of Johannesburg-based Odysseys' self-titled album in 1991. There was a burgeoning crossover punk/metal scene in the major centres, particularly spurred on by Cape Towns' Voice Of Destruction and Johannesburg based Urban Assault in the very late 1980s. Johannesburg developed an extreme metal scene in 1992 with rising grindcore/death metal act Retribution Denied, Boksburg based macabre/death metal act Debauchery followed by Pretoria doom metal band Funeral, Christian metal act Abhorrence and Insurrection, Metalmorphosis, Sacrifist and Agro, the latter two acts still perform today. The Cape Town metal scene was on a high in the mid-1990s, driven largely by Pothole and Sacraphyx. Pothole would release two critically acclaimed albums on South Africa's most successful punk/metal label, Way-Cool Records ‚Äì their debut \\"Force-Fed Hatred\\" is still the top selling South African metal album to date. Whilst many of the acts failed to find commercial success in terms of CD sales, there was a devout following nationally and local metal bands soon opened the national touring circuit to a higher extent than most other genres. It also attracted international artists to tour the country almost immediately after the demise of apartheid, with some of the most respected international artists having seen fit to visit the country since. =Techno= The first South African live techno bands were the Kraftreaktor and The Kiwi Experience. Jay Sonton and Ruediger Keller from Kraftreaktor and the Kiwi Experience performed at several raves, playing mainly electronic body music. Their music was mainly influenced by European artists, but included a unique South African touch. They mainly integrated African samples to localise their sound. The 2000s =Blues Rock= The Blues Rock scene has dramatically emerged in South Africa. Albert Frost, Dan Patlansky, The Black Cat Bones, Gerald Clark, Crimson House Blues, The Blues Broers and Boulevard Blues band are some of the most prominent blues acts in South-Africa. Figures like Piet Botha and Valiant Swart have largely contributed to the South-African Blues and Rock scene. =Kwaito= Kwaito is based on house music beats, but typically at a slower tempo and containing melodic and percussive African samples which are looped, deep bass-lines and often vocals, generally male, shouted or chanted rather than sung or rapped. Many consider it South Africa's unique implementation of hip hop. =Afrikaans= In a resurgence (an increase or revival after a period of little activity, popularity, or occurrence)that has been linked by some to freedom from Apartheid guilt, Afrikaans music saw a surge in new artists, album releases and sales after 2000. In 2004 an Afrikaans album (by balladeer Steve Hofmeyr) was named best-selling album of the year. The massive purchasing power of the Afrikaner minority is partly to thank for this. In 2007 an Afrikaans song about Boer War general Koos de la Rey by Bok van Blerk became a hit amid debates on whether it represented a call to arms for the reinstatement of Afrikaner rule or just expressed cultural nostalgia. While the boom in the Afrikaans pop industry has continued from the previous decade through the popularity of arts festivals and dance halls, other Afrikaans music genres experienced a revival of sorts in the new millennium. Rock and alternative Afrikaans music had stagnated somewhat after the heady days of the \\"Vo√´lvry\\" tour and the alternative movement. Signs of a revival could be found in the arrival of Karen Zoid on the music scene due to her distinct alternative sound. Shortly afterwards, a band of young rockers called \\"Fokofpolisiekar\\" became the first group to create alternative rock in Afrikaans. Their controversial name (translated as Fuckoffpolicecar), statements and behavior drew much public attention, making them a symbol of the Afrikaans Rock revival movement. Lead singer Francois Van Coke and songwriter Hunter Kennedy have gone on to explore other genres of music also not previously popular in Afrikaans and have ventured into more commercial routes. Shortly after the arrival of this and other rock acts, the first Afrikaans television music channel (MK89) was opened which focused mainly on rock music. The Afrikaans (and English) rock and alternative music scene has been booming ever since. Bands like Battery9, Terminatrix, NuL, K.O.B.U.S. and Thys Nywerheid continue to reinvent alternative Afrikaans music, while Jack Parow has continued the Cape's development of Afrikaans rap from pioneers Brasse vannie Kaap, finding success as far afield as Holland with his 2009 single \\"Cooler as Ekke\\". =2009 Breakthrough Experimentalism= From 2009 into 2010, two unique and eclectic but thoroughly South African groups in particular received high acclaim from international music media, and both groups challenged traditional genre descriptions. They significantly increased global recognition of contemporary South African music culture. BLK JKS' experimental Afro-rock took inspiration from The Mars Volta to blend their Zulu heritage and township origins with modern sounds and equipment and an approach to music-making that seems entirely devoid of boundaries, while maintaining the sweet melodies and rhythmic qualities of South Africa's traditional music. They received an important boost after performing in Opening Ceremony of 2010 FIFA World Cup. Die Antwoord has challenged conventions of hip-hop through its blend of English, Afrikaans, and local slang, and sparse House-influenced production, reflecting the new 'Zef' counter-culture in its cheap-and-dirty values. The band achieved worldwide attention with their self-published debut thanks to two striking and humorous YouTube music videos released in 2010 that rapidly reached viral proportions. The highly polarised international response to their music helped them secure an album deal with Cherrytree Records, an imprint of Interscope. They also famously triggered a feud with American pop singer Lady Gaga, who offered them the chance to open for her on her Born This Way Tour, which they blatantly refused. In 2016, singer Refentse Morake made waves for releasing his debut album solely in Afrikaans, becoming the first black singer to do so. =Drum and bass= The South African drum and bass scene began in the mid nineties. In 2000, events such as Homegrown became a prominent fixture in Cape Town and a launching platform for international and local artists such as Counterstrike, SFR, Niskerone, Tasha Baxter, Anti Alias and Rudeone. Other regular events include It Came From The Jungle in Cape Town and Science Friksun in Johannesburg. A weekly Sublime drum and bass radio show is hosted by Hyphen on Bush Radio. =Psychedelic trance= South African psytrance is a form of darker psychedelic trance music that started and is produced mostly in South Africa. Unlike the Russian dark psytrance, South African psytrance is more rhythmic, melodic and danceable, yet keeps the 'nasty-like' attitude. Notable record labels include Timecode Records, Mind Manipulation Device and Nano Records. Modern day The South African music scene has continued to flourish in the 2000s. The decade has seen the rise of Xhosa singer Simphiwe Dana, whose success has seen her hailed as the \\"new Miriam Makeba\\", with her unique combination of jazz, pop, and traditional music. Another similar young singer is Thandiswa Mazwai, originally a kwaito singer with Bongo Maffin. Thandiswa combined local hip-hop rhythms with traditional Xhosa sounds, creating a rich textured style. 2006 saw the rise of Shwi Nomtekhala, a duo combining mbaqanga rhythms and maskandi sounds. The duo has become one of the most influential new acts on the music scene today, outselling even kwaito artists. Their debut album Wangisiza Baba was a major hit in the country. Cape Town-based female artist Verity has been recognised internationally for innovation in the music industry for selling 2000 copies of her album Journey before it was actually recorded. Rap group \\"2 and a Half Secondz\\" has found recognition in Cape Town suburb, Delft since 2009. Cape Town based band Crimson House Blues has made waves throughout the live circuit being hailed as one of the greatest live acts in the country. In addition Willim Welsyn, part of the Afrikaans rock band Willim Welsyn en die Sunrise Toffies was nominated and won multiple awards in the Afrikaans Alternative categories. Nianell, the South African superstar, is also another internationally recognised artist in modern South African music, combing Folk, Classical, Pop, Country, and Celtic music that make her own unique sound. She has released seven albums with songs that switch back and forth between Afrikaans and English. Her first platinum hit that sold more than 2 million copies was \\"Who Painted The Moon\\" that was also covered by international superstar Hayley Westenra. In early 2011, she made her initial debut in the U.S. with her compilation album Who Painted The Moon. Ladysmith Black Mambazo remain one of the world's most popular choral groups and still retain popularity in South Africa, with their latest offering being the highly praised Ilembe (2007/2008). The legendary group boasts three grammy wins. The Mahotella Queens also remain high-selling, and ‚Äì with the death of long-time groaner Mahlathini in 1999 ‚Äì have recorded several new albums, including their 2007 release Siyadumisa (Songs of Praise). 2008 has also seen the return of a former singer with the Mahotella Queens, Irene Mawela. Mawela appeared on thousands of mbaqanga and mgqashiyo recording sessions well throughout the 1960s and the 1970s, recording mainly for Gallo Record Company, often as part of the line-ups of the Mahotella Queens, the Mgababa Queens, Izintombi Zomgqashiyo, and also under her own name (though sometimes as Irene & The Sweet Melodians, or Irene & The Zebra Queens). In 1983 she left the company to record as a solo artist, with a successful Venda- traditional release Khanani Yanga. Mawela left the music business in the late 1980s, but returned in November 2007 with a brand-new album called Tlhokomela Sera, which combines modern contemporary sounds with pure gospel music, making what Mawela calls \\"gospel jive\\". The music scene in South Africa is focused around four major areas, Johannesburg, Cape Town, Durban and Bloemfontein. One of the characteristics of the scene is the strong sense of community which sees artist, promoters and venues all actively involved in developing the local talent. Bloemfontein's music focus is centred predominantly around the metal and Afrikaans genres. Johannesburg, Cape Town and Durban are far more wide-ranging in the genres of music covered by bands and artists. Cape Town is a hotbed for the underground music scene, generally held to be more experimental than the music produced in the other centres. Potchefstroom seems to be the newest development ground for Afrikaans rock music, with various bands like Straatligkinders making their start here. The introduction of the South African Music Awards (SAMA), intended to recognise accomplishment in the South African recording industry has raised the awareness of local artists and bands. The awards are given in various categories, including album of the year, best newcomer, best artists (male and female) and the best duo or group. South African Music Award winners include Karen Zoid, Freshlyground, Tasha Baxter and Seether. Uniquely African music aside, the South African music scene has, to a large extent, been characterised by bands seeking to emulate popular genres abroad. However, recent years have seen South African music begin to develop a truly original sound. South Africa has several annual music festivals including Woodstock South Africa, MotherFudd, Oppikoppi, Rocking the Daisies and Splashy Fen. The music festivals cater to different genres and styles of music. Motherfudd is an exclusively metal festival held early in the year. The 2008 Motherfudd festival had a line-up of 30 bands with 2 stages and took place near Hartebeespoort. The Oppikoppi festival started in 1994 and is held in the Limpopo Province of South Africa, near the mining town of Northam. Originally a rock festival, Oppikoppi has expanded to include other genres. Splashy Fen is an annual Easter festival held on a farm near Underberg in KwaZulu-Natal, with a focus on rock and reggae music. Since 2016, The Legend stage at Splashy, convened by Don Clarke and Dicky Roberts has brought well known local legends back to the festival, including P J Powers in 2019. Rocking the Daisies is an annual music festival which is held outside Cape Town in Darling on the Cloof wine estate. It was established in 2005 with a focus upon rock music and is a \\"green\\" festival for which it has garnered awards. Skouspel is a very popular televised annual concert sponsored by the Afrikaans family-magazine Huisgenoot, hosted at the Sun City resort. Skouspel (translates as \\"spectacle\\") focuses primarily on Afrikaans music and regularly features some of the biggest names in the Afrikaans music scene along with new artists. In 2019 the South African music scene see a new genre of music called Amapiano Music storm and take over the scene for the year, by statistics this genre seems to be most dominant in the music industry for the year. There is also a young movement of community rap called Tzaneen Rap, producing up-and- coming rappers that are already coming up and keeping up with the rap game. It is a good combination of vernacular Xitsonga, Sepedi, Xhosa, Zulu, Sesotho and English lyricism. It was formed in the 1990s and only became popular around 2015. There are vernacular rappers like DNP, Dj Snake and English lyrics from Ironic, Savanna and Gratitude Moruti. It all began in Limpopo, Tzaneen. South Africa has experienced a new wave of artists over the last few years, some artists include Nasty C, Timo ODV, AKA, YoungstaCPT, K.O, Anatii, and Maloon The Boom. Several charts have now been introduced to monitor the progress of the industry. Even though it appears foreign music still sells more than the current local music. There's a chart by TINA Magazine that currently monitors top songs in South Africa weekly. Although the local music scene has continued to grow exponentially since the 2000s, a lot of South Africans still consume foreign music contents over local contents. Neo-traditional styles Traditionally styled music is generally appellated as \\"Sotho-traditional\\" or \\"Zulu-traditional\\", and has been an important part of the South African music business since the 1930s. Vocal and concertina records were released with a call-and-response style and a concertina used as a counterpoint to the lead vocal. Following World War 1, cheap imported concertinas arrived in South Africa, especially the Italian brand bafstari. =Sotho-traditional= The Sotho musician Tshwatlano Makala was the first traditional musician to achieve widespread commercial success. He helped to set the stage for the subsequent rise of Letsema Mat'sela's band, Basotho Dihoba, which used styles from his native Lesotho to develop a genre called mohobelo. By the 1970s, the concertina of Sotho-traditional music was replaced with an accordion and an electric backing band. This wave of neo-traditional performers was led by Tau Ea Mat'sekha. =Zulu= The Zulu people adopted the guitar following its introduction by the Portuguese in the sixteenth century, and guitars were locally and cheaply made by the 1930s. John Bhengu was the first major Zulu guitarist, earning a reputation in 1950s Durban for his unique ukupika style of picking (as opposed to traditional strumming). Bhengu's song format, which includes an instrumental introduction (izihlabo), a melody and spoken praise (ukubonga) for a clan or family, was widely used for a long time in Zulu- traditional music. Bhengu, however, switched to the electric guitar in the late 1960s and began recording as \\"Phuzushukela\\" (Sugar Drinker). His popularity exploded, and Zulu-traditional music entered a boom. Since the 1970s, the concertina has returned to Zulu-traditional music, while diverse influences from pop music and drum and bass were added. Vusi Ximba's Siyakudamisa (1992) was perhaps the most memorable Zulu-traditional album of the later twentieth century, and drew controversy for racy, comedic lyrics. =Tsonga-traditional= Tsonga traditional music was first recorded in the 1950s by Francisco Baloyi for Gallo, and showed a largely African style influenced by Latin rhythms. Mozambiquan musicians Fani Pfumo and Alexander Jafete became prominent studio performers in the 1950s and into the next decade. In 1975, however, Mozambique became independent and a radio station was opened by Radio Bantu, leading to the abandonment of Portuguese elements from this style. More modern Tsonga bands, such as General MD Shirinda & the Gaza Sisters play a style called Tsonga disco, featuring a male lead vocalist backed by female singers, a guitar, keyboard or synth and disco rhythms. Thomas Chauke & the Shinyori Sisters (Tusk Records) have become probably the best-selling band of any neo-traditional style. George Maluleke na Van'wanati Sisters have also been instrumental in modernizing the music by experimenting with a faster tempo and native instruments. The most popular Tsonga musicians, however, has arguably been either Thomas Chauke, the pop singer Peta Teanet or the equally successful Penny Penny, Joe Shirimani. Paul Ndlovu is another artist who has contributed a lot in this genre, with his popular hits, Hi ta famba moyeni and Tsakane. The modern sound of traditional Xitsonga music comprises more of the earlier native sounds that had initially been abandoned in favor of the Portuguese electronic guitars, namely the xylophone and bass marimba. Bands such as Thomas Chauke and the Xinyori Sisters and George Maluleke predominantly used guitars; however the modern sound replaces these with the xylophone or bass marimba. The Tsonga people's preference for the xylophone and marimba type of sound is inherited from the timbila music of the Chopi people, which has been entered into the UNESCO heritage archives as a Masterpiece of the Oral and Intangible Heritage of Humanity.UNESCO, 2014, ‚ÄúChopi Timbila‚Äù accessed 31 October 2017. =Pedi-traditional= Pedi- traditional music is principally harepa and is based on the harp. The German autoharp arrived in South Africa in the nineteenth century, brought by Lutheran ministers proselytising among the Pedi. Harepa has not achieved much mainstream success in South Africa, though there was a brief boom in the 1970s, led by Johannes Mohlala and Sediya dipela Mokgwadi. =Venda- traditional= Venda-traditional music was also recorded when black music in South Africa was being recognised. The late 1960s (and, more significantly the late 1970s) saw a boom in Venda-speaking artists. This was mainly influenced by the launch of a Venda radio station. Irene Mawela (who had been singing in the 1960s and 1970s with groups like Mahotella Queens, Sweet Sixteens and the Dark City Sisters) significantly impacted traditional and contemporary Venda music, despite vocal recordings in Zulu, Sotho and Xhosa languages. Mawela's 1983 release, Khanani Yanga, was one of the most successful Venda-traditional music albums of that year. After some lean years, Mawela returned to the South African music scene with Tlhokomela Sera, released in December 2007. Mawela's recent numbers like Mme Anga Khotsi Anga and Nnditsheni are very popular. Solomon Matase is known for his hits Ntshavheni and Vho i fara Phele. Alpheus Ramavhea, Mundalamo, Eric Mukhese, and Adziambei Band are also famous for their contributions to Venda music. The latter band still continues to produce music with great success, including a recent album release, Mutula Gole, in February 2012. Colbert Mukwevho has been involved with Venda music for over 20 years, starting with 1980s hits like \\"Kha tambe na thanga dzawe,\\" \\"i do nera rothe\\" and \\"saga-saga.\\" In 2006 his comeback album Mulovha namusi na matshelo, included hit songs \\"ndo takala hani and zwa mutani wavho\\" which remain popular with Venda and Pedi's. He grew up in a family of music. His father Christopher Mukwevho, then leader of the popular band Thrilling Artist, used to feature him at young age. Rudzani Shurflus Ragimana of shurflus was well known for 'muthu wanga a thi mulitshi, shango lo vhifha muvhilini known for venda reggae music together with Khakhathi and friends Tshganzha, Ntshenge. Reggae music is well played by a lot of artists for tshivenda. Others performers include: Makhadzi Fizzy, Prifix, Bhamba, Komrade Li, SubZro, TAKZIT, Humbulani Ramagwedzha, Jahman Chiganja, Khakhathi and Friends, Maduvha Madima, Takalani Mudau, Rapson Mbilummbi Rambuwani, TMan Gavini,Clean-G, Mizo Phyll, Killah Gee, Jininka, Paul Mulaudzi, Malondo Ramulongo, Burning Doctor, Just ice, Lufuno Dagada and Tshidino Ndou. Another singer making a name for himself in the South African music market is Tshidino Ndou, a reggae artist who is also owner of Vhadino Entertainment music company. Tshidino was born and bred in Tshakhuma, a rural village in South Africa in the Limpopo Province. So far he has two albums, Ndi do fa na inwi (2009) (Till death do us part) and Nne Ndi Nne (2010) (I am what I am). His song \\"Ni songo nyadza\\" (meaning \\"do not undermine other people's religions\\"), featuring a Venda reggae icon Humbulani Ramagwedzha of thivhulungiwi fame, is gaining extensive media exposure through Phalaphala FM, Soweto TV, Makhado FM and Univen radio. Tshidino entered the music scene as a founder member of Vhadino House Grooves group which he established alongside his brother, Arthur Ndou in 2008. They released their debut hot album titled Ro Swika meaning we have arrived. The album contains a controversial song \\"Ri ya groova\\", widely known as \\"Ndo Fara Mudifho\\". He has just released a hot single, \\"Ri khou phusha life\\", which has already made a mark on radfios and newspapers. The full album was planned for release in 2012, featuring two other giants: Takalani Mudau of \\"baby fusheani\\" fame and the Burning Doctor of \\"A lu na mutwe\\" fame. Tshidino is not just a musician but also a prominent film producer who is more popular in the Vendawood film industry in the Limpopo Province of South Africa. He plays the character of Vho-Mulingo in Vho-Mulingo comedy. Other movies he produced include Mathaithai, Hu do dzula nnyi, Mphemphe i a netisa and Hu bvuma na fhasi. =Xhosa-traditional= Perhaps the best known neo-traditional South African music, internationally anyway, is the music of Amampondo and the solo work of their leader and founder, Dizu Plaatjies. He and his group took traditional Xhosa music from the hills of Pondoland and the Eastern Cape and put it on stage worldwide. The success of the genre was how the exponents combined their music with their stage performances and dance.

Billboards present large advertisements to passing pedestrians and drivers. Typically showing witty slogans and distinctive visuals, billboards are highly visible in the top designated market areas. The largest ordinary-sized billboards are located primarily on major highways, expressways or principal arterials, and command high-density consumer exposure (mostly to vehicular traffic). These afford greatest visibility due not only to their size, but because they allow creative \\"customizing\\" through extensions and embellishments. Posters are the other common form of billboard advertising, located mostly along primary and secondary arterial roads. Posters are a smaller format and are viewed principally by residents and commuter traffic, with some pedestrian exposure. Advertising style Billboard advertisements are designed to catch a person's attention and create a memorable impression very quickly, leaving the reader thinking about the advertisement after they have driven past it. They have to be readable in a very short time because they are usually read while being passed at high speeds. Thus there are usually only a few words, in large print, and a humorous or arresting image in brilliant color. Some billboard designs spill outside the actual space given to them by the billboard, with parts of figures hanging off the billboard edges or jutting out of the billboard in three dimensions. An example is the United States around the turn of the 21st century was the Chick-fil-A billboards (a chicken sandwich fast food chain), which had three-dimensional cow figures in the act of painting the billboards with misspelled anti-beef slogans such as \\"frendz don't let frendz eat beef.\\" The first \\"scented billboard\\", an outdoor sign emitting the odors of black pepper and charcoal to suggest a grilled steak, was erected on NC 150 near Mooresville, North Carolina by the Bloom grocery chain. The sign depicted a giant cube of beef being pierced by a large fork that extended to the ground. The scents were emitted between 7‚Äì10 am and 4‚Äì7 pm from 28 May 2010 through 18 June 2010. Painted billboards Almost all these billboards were painted in large studios. The image was projected on the series of paper panels that made up the billboard. Line drawings were done, then traced with a pounce wheel that created perforated lines. The patterns were then \\"pounced\\" onto the board with a chalk filled pounce bag, marking the outlines of the figures or objects. Using oil paints, artists would use large brushes to paint the image. Once the panels were installed using hydraulic cranes, artists would go up on the installed billboard and touch up the edges between panels. These large, painted billboards were especially popular in Los Angeles where historic firms such as Foster & Kleiser and Pacific Outdoor Advertising dominated the industry. Eventually, these painted billboards gave way to graphic reproduction, but hand-painted billboards are still in use in some areas where only a single board or two is required. The \\"Sunset Strip\\" in Los Angeles is one area where hand-painted billboards can still be found, usually to advertise upcoming films or albums. Digital billboards Ypsilanti, MI A digital billboard is a billboard that shows varying imagery and text created from computer programs and software. Digital billboards can be designed to display running text, display several different displays from the same company, and even provide several companies a certain time slot during the day. The constantly changing texts ensure maximum impact and wide exposure to target audiences. The ability to schedule advertisements remotely, in combination with flexible real-time scheduling, has allowed for a decrease in traditional upkeep and maintenance costs. Additionally, digital billboards are continually integrating with real-time advertisement technologies to measure audiences or serve dynamic content. In January 2015, Ooh! Media launched a campaign with Porsche that detected incoming Porsche cars and displayed a dynamic piece of relevant content to Porsche drivers. In May 2014, Beck's Beer released a billboard poster that plays audio. Conductive ink linked to sensors and speakers means that when touched, the poster begins to play music. The beer company claim it to be 'the world's first playable music poster'. However, Agency Republic released the Spotify Powered Interactive Music Poster in April 2012. Creative agency, Grey London collaborated on a similarly interactive poster using touch sensitive inks in April 2014. Mobile billboards Mobile billboard in East Coast Park, Singapore Outdoor Advertising, such as a mobile billboard, is effective because it is difficult to ignore. According to a UK national survey, it is also memorable. Capitol Communications Group found that 81.7% of those polled recalled images they saw on a moving multi-image sign. This is compared to a 19% retention rate for static signs. Unlike a typical billboard, mobile billboards are able to go directly to their target audience. They can be placed wherever there is heavy foot traffic due to an event ‚Äì including convention centers, train stations, airports and sports arenas. They can repeat routes, ensuring that an advertiser's message is not only noticed, but that information is retained through repetition. Multi-purpose billboards Billboards may be multi- purpose. An advertising sign can integrate its main purpose with telecommunications antenna or public lighting support. Usually the structure has a steel pole with a coupling flange on the above-fitted advertising billboard structure that can contain telecommunications antennas. The lighting, wiring, and any antennas are placed inside the structure. Other types of billboards Common along highways are free-standing two-sided as well as three-sided billboards. Other types of billboards include the billboard bicycle attached to the back of a bicycle or the mobile billboard, a special advertising trailer to hoist big banners. Mechanical billboards display three different messages, with three advertisements attached to a conveyor inside the billboard. There are also three-dimensional billboards, such as the ones at Piccadilly Circus, London. Placement of billboards Some of the most prominent billboards are alongside highways; since passing drivers typically have little to occupy their attention, the impact of the billboard is greater. Billboards are often drivers' primary method of finding lodging, food, and fuel on unfamiliar highways. There were approximately 450,000 billboards on US highways in 1991. Somewhere between 5,000 and 15,000 are erected each year. Current numbers are put at 368,263, according to the OAAA (outdoor Advertising Association of America). In Europe billboards are a major component and source of income in urban street furniture concepts. An interesting use of billboards unique to highways was the Burma-Shave advertisements between 1925 and 1963, which had 4- or 5-part messages on multiple signs, keeping the reader hooked by the promise of a punchline at the end. This example is in the National Museum of American History at the Smithsonian Institution: :Shaving brushes :You'll soon see 'em :On a shelf :In some museum :Burma-Shave'' These sort of multi-sign advertisements are no longer common, though they are not extinct. One example, advertising for the NCAA, depicts a basketball player aiming a shot on one billboard; on the next one, 90 yards (82 meters) away, is the basket. Another example is the numerous billboards advertising the roadside attraction South of the Border near Dillon, SC, along I-95 in many states. Many cities have high densities of billboards, especially where there is dense pedestrian traffic‚ÄîTimes Square in New York City is a good example. Because of the lack of space in cities, these billboards are placed on the sides of buildings and sometimes are free- standing billboards hanging above buildings. Billboards on the sides of buildings create different stylistic opportunities, with artwork that incorporates features of the building into the design, such as using windows as eyes, or for gigantic frescoes that adorn the entire building. =Visual and environmental concerns= Many groups such as Scenic America have complained that billboards on highways cause excessive clearing of trees and intrude on the surrounding landscape, with billboards' bright colors, lights and large fonts making it difficult to focus on anything else, making them a form of visual pollution. Other groups believe that billboards and advertising contribute negatively to the mental climate of a culture by promoting products as providing feelings of completeness, wellness and popularity to motivate purchase. One focal point for this sentiment would be the magazine AdBusters, which will often showcase politically motivated billboard and other advertising vandalism, called culture jamming. This is one of three contested billboards in the coastal zone of Humboldt Bay that were cut down by an unknown vandal in 2013. In 2000, rooftops in Athens had grown so thick with billboards that it was difficult to see its famous architecture. In preparation for the 2004 Summer Olympics, the city embarked on a successful four-year project demolishing the majority of rooftop billboards to beautify the city, overcoming resistance from advertisers and building owners. Most of these billboards were illegal, but had been ignored until then. In 2007, S√£o Paulo, Brazil instituted a billboard ban because there were no viable regulations of the billboard industry. Today, S√£o Paulo is working with outdoor companies to rebuild the outdoor infrastructure in a way that will reflect the vibrant business climate of the city while adopting good regulations to control growth. Individuals and groups have vandalized billboards worldwide. =Road safety concerns= Panoramic view of Los Angeles looking north from the Pacific Electric Building, ca. 1 January 1907 The most comprehensive review of the literature to date by the Centre for Accident Research and Road Safety-Queensland (CARRS-Q) found that crash risk increases by approximately 25-29% in the presence of digital roadside advertising signs compared to control areas. There is an emerging trend in the literature suggesting that roadside advertising signs can increase crash risk, particularly for those signs that have the capacity to frequently change (often referred to as digital billboards). In the US, many cities enacted laws banning billboards as early as 1909 (California Supreme Court, Varney & Green vs. Williams) but the First Amendment has made this difficult. A San Diego law championed by Pete Wilson in 1971 cited traffic safety and driver distraction as the reason for the billboard ban, but was narrowly overturned by the Supreme Court in 1981, in part because it banned non-commercial as well as commercial billboards. Billboards have long been accused of distracting drivers and causing accidents. This may not necessarily be true, as a study by researchers at the University of North Carolina showed. Released in June 2001, the researchers prepared a thorough report on driver distraction for the AAA Foundation for Traffic Safety. This study said: \\"The search appears to suggest that some items‚Äîsuch as CB radios, billboards, and temperature controls‚Äîare not significant distractions.\\" Traffic safety experts have studied the relationship between outdoor advertising and traffic accidents since the 1950s, finding no authoritative or scientific evidence that billboards are linked to traffic accidents. However, many of these studies were funded by the Outdoor Advertising Association of America, which has led to accusations of bias. The methodology used in certain studies is also questionable. The US Department of Transportation, State Department of Transportation and property/casualty insurance companies statistics on fatal accidents indicate no correlation between billboards and traffic accidents. A broad sampling of law enforcement agencies across the country found no evidence to suggest that motor vehicle accidents were caused by billboards. Property and casualty insurance companies have conducted detailed studies of traffic accident records and conclude no correlation between billboards and traffic accidents. However, studies based on correlations between traffic accidents and billboards face the problem of under-reporting: drivers are unwilling to admit responsibility for a crash, so will not admit to being distracted at a crucial moment. Even given this limitation, some studies have found higher crash rates in the vicinity of advertising using variable message signsCairney, P., & Gunatillake, T. (2000). Does roadside advertising really cause crashes? Paper presented at the Road Safety: research, enforcement and policy., Brisbane, Australia. or electronic billboards.Farbry, J., Wochinger, K., Shafer, T., Owens, N., & Nedzesky, A. (2001). Research review of potential safety effects of electronic billboards on driver attention and distraction. Washington, DC: Federal Highway Administration It is possible that advertising signs in rural areas reduce driver boredom, which many believe is a contribution to highway safety. On the other hand, drivers may fixate on a billboard which unexpectedly appears in a monotonous landscape, and drive straight into it (a phenomenon known as \\"highway hypnosis\\").Wallace, B. (2003). Driver distraction by advertising: genuine risk or urban myth? Municipal Engineer, 156, 185‚Äì190. Surveys of road users show that the lighting provided by billboards provide security and visibility to many motorists. The Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) went on record (Federal Register, 5 March 1999) stating that the agency agrees that appropriately regulated billboards do not compromise highway safety. This statement was made before the release of the FHWA report Research review of potential safety effects of electronic billboards on driver attention and distraction in 2001. What level of regulation is appropriate for billboards in different areas is still under discussion by road safety experts around the world. =Laws limiting billboards= Billboards are largely absent in Australia's capital city, Canberra, due to a 1937 ordinance which prohibited unauthorized signs on Commonwealth land. In 2017, the Australian Capital Territory considered relaxing this law to allow more outdoor advertising. An Inquiry into billboards received a record 166 submissions, with only 6 respondents supporting allowing more advertising in the Territory. The other submissions supported the current laws, or pointed to shortcomings and loopholes of the current laws, such as the allowance of mobile billboards, bus wrap advertising and political campaign signs, as well a failure to enforce existing laws. In 1964, the negative impact of the over-proliferation of signage was abundantly evident in Houston, Texas, USA, and it motivated Lady Bird Johnson to ask her husband to create a law. At the same time the outdoor advertising industry was becoming aware that excessive signs, some literally blocking another, was bad for business. In 1965, the Highway Beautification Act was signed into law. The act applied only to \\"Federal Aid Primary\\" and \\"Defense\\" highways and limited billboards to commercial and industrial zones created by states and municipalities. It required each state to set standards based on \\"customary use\\" for the size, lighting and spacing of billboards, and prohibited city and state governments from removing billboards without paying compensation to the owner. The act requires states to maintain \\"effective control\\" of billboards or lose 10% of their federal highway dollars. The act also required the screening of junk yards adjacent to regulated highways. Around major holidays, volunteer groups erected highway signs offering free coffee at rest stops. These were specifically exempted in the act. Currently, four states‚ÄîVermont, Alaska, Hawaii, and Maine‚Äîhave prohibited billboards. Vermont's law went into effect in 1968, Hawaii's law went into effect in 1927, Maine's law went into effect in 1977, and Alaska's law went into effect upon its achievement of statehood in 1959. In the UK, billboards are controlled as adverts as part of the planning system. To display an illegal advert (that is, without planning permission) is a criminal offence with a fine of up to ¬£2500 per offence (per poster). All of the large UK outdoor advertisers such as CBS Outdoor, JCDecaux, Clear Channel, Titan and Primesight have numerous convictions for such crimes.http://www.wandsworth.gov.uk/NR/Wandsworth/localpdf/brightside/bside_oct07.pdf In S√£o Paulo, a city of twelve million in Brazil, Billboards and advertising on vehicles have been banned since January 2007. It also restricted the dimensions of advertising on shop fronts. In British Columbia, a province of Canada, billboards are restricted to 300m away from roadways, the government also retains the right to remove any billboard it deems an unsafe distraction. In Toronto, a city of over 2 and a half million in Canada, a municipal tax on billboards was implemented in April 2010. A portion of the tax will help fund arts programs in the city. Usages =Highway= A billboard frame in Swindon, England Many signs advertise local restaurants and shops in the coming miles, and are crucial to drawing business in small towns. One example is Wall Drug, which in 1936 erected billboards advertising \\"free ice water\\". The town of Wall, South Dakota, was essentially built around the many thousands of customers per day those billboards brought in (20,000 in 1981). Some signs were placed at great distances, with slogans such as \\"only 827 miles to Wall Drug, with FREE ice water.\\" In some areas the signs were so dense that one almost immediately followed the last. This situation changed after the Highway Beautification Act was passed; the proliferation of Wall Drug billboards is sometimes cited as one of the reasons the bill was passed. After the passage of the act, other states (such as Oregon) embarked on highway beautification efforts. ATB Financial ad, Edmonton =Railway= Billboard advertising in underground stations, especially, is perhaps a place where they find a greater degree of acceptability and may assist in maintaining a neat, vibrant and safe atmosphere if not too distracting. Museum Station, Sydney has mounted restored 1940s billboard panels along the platforms that are in keeping with its heritage listing. =Big name advertisers= Billboards are also used to advertise national or global brands, particularly in more densely populated urban areas. According to the Outdoor Advertising Association of America, the top billboard advertisers in the United States in 2017 were McDonald's, Apple and GEICO. A large number of wireless phone companies, movie companies, car manufacturers and banks are high on the list as well. =Tobacco advertising= Mail Pouch Barn advertisement: a bit of Americana in southern Ohio. Mail Pouch painted the barns for free. Prior to 1999, billboards were a major venue of cigarette advertising; 10% of Michigan billboards advertise alcohol and tobacco, according to the Detroit Free Press. This is particularly true in countries where tobacco advertisements are not allowed in other media. For example, in the US, tobacco advertising was banned on radio and television in 1971, leaving billboards and magazines as some of the last places tobacco could be advertised. Billboards made the news in America when, in the tobacco settlement of 1999, all cigarette billboards were replaced with anti-smoking messages. In a parody of the Marlboro Man, some billboards depicted cowboys riding on ranches with slogans like \\"Bob, I miss my lung.\\" Likely the best- known of the tobacco advertising boards were those for \\"Mail Pouch\\" chewing tobacco in the United States during the first half of the 20th century (pictured at left). The company agreed to paint two or three sides of a farmer's barn any color he chose in exchange for painting their advertisement on one or two sides of the structure facing the road. The company has long since abandoned this form of advertising, and none of these advertisements have been painted in many years, but some remain visible on rural highways. =Non-commercial use= Non-commercial advertisement is used around the world by governments and non-profit organisations to obtain donations, volunteer support or change consumer behavior. North Dakota, May 2004. Not all billboards are used for advertising products and services‚Äînon-profit groups and government agencies use them to communicate with the public. In 1999 an anonymous person created the God Speaks billboard campaign in Florida \\"to get people thinking about God\\", with witty statements signed by God. \\"Don't make me come down there\\", \\"We need to talk\\" and \\"Tell the children that I love them\\" were parts of the campaign, which was picked up by the Outdoor Advertising Association of America and continues today on billboards across the country. South of Olympia, Washington is the privately owned Uncle Sam billboard. It features conservative, sometimes inflammatory messages, changed on a regular basis. Chehalis farmer Al Hamilton first started the board during the Johnson era, when the government was trying to make him remove his billboards along Interstate 5. He had erected the signs after he lost a legal battle to prevent the building of the freeway across his land. Numerous legal and illegal attempts to remove the Uncle Sam billboard have failed, and it is now in its third location. One message, attacking a nearby liberal arts college, was photographed, made into a postcard and is sold in the College Bookstore. Governance The Traffic Audit Bureau for Media Measurement Inc. (TAB) was established in 1933 as a non-profit organization whose historical mission has been to audit the circulation of out-of-home media in the United States. TAB's role has expanded to lead and support other major out of home industry research initiatives. Governed by a tripartite board composed of advertisers, agencies and media companies, the TAB acts as an independent auditor for traffic circulation in accordance with guidelines established by its board of directors. Similarly, in Canada, the Canadian Outdoor Measurement Bureau (COMB) was formed in 1965 as a non-profit organization independently operated by representatives composed of advertisers, advertising agencies and members of the Canadian out-of-home advertising industry. COMB is charged with the verification of traffic circulation for the benefit of the industry and its users.

Outside Africa, most music from the Democratic Republic of Congo is called Soukous, which most accurately refers instead to a dance popular in the late 1960s. The term rumba or rock-rumba is also used generically to refer to Congolese music, though neither is precise nor accurately descriptive. People from the Congo have no single term for their own music per se, although muziki na biso (\\"our music\\") was used until the late 1970s, and now the most common name is ndule, which simply means music in the Lingala language; most songs from the Democratic Republic of the Congo are sung in Lingala. History =Colonial times (pre-1960)= Since the colonial era, Kinshasa, Congo's capital, has been one of the great centers of musical innovation. The country, however, was carved out from territories controlled by many different ethnic groups, many of which had little in common with each other. Each maintained (and continue to do so) their own folk music traditions, and there was little in the way of a pan-Congolese musical identity until the 1940s. Like much of Africa, Congo was dominated during the World War II-era by rumba, a fusion of Latin and African musical styles that came from the island of Cuba. Congolese musicians appropriated rumba and adapted its characteristics for their own instruments and tastes. In the 1950s, record labels began appearing, including CEFA, Ngoma, Loningisa and Opika, each issuing many 78 rpm records; Radio Congo Belge also began broadcasting during this period. Bill Alexandre, a Belgian working for CEFA, brought electric guitars to the Congo. Popular early musicians include Feruzi, who is said to have popularized rumba during the 1930s and guitarists like Zachery Elenga, Antoine Wendo Kolosoy and, most influentially, Jean Bosco Mwenda. Alongside rumba, other imported genres like American swing, French cabaret and Ghanaian highlife were also popular. In 1953, the Congolese music scene began to differentiate itself with the formation of African Jazz (led by Joseph \\"Le Grand Kall√©\\" Kabasele), the first full-time orchestra to record and perform, and the debut of fifteen-year-old guitarist Fran√ßois Luambo Makiadi (aka Franco). Both would go on to be some of the earliest Congolese music stars. African Jazz, which included Kabasele, sometimes called the father of modern Congolese music, as well as legendary Cameroonian saxophonist and keyboardist Manu Dibango, has become one of the most well-known groups in Africa, largely due to 1960's \\"Ind√©pendance Cha Cha\\", which celebrated Congo's independence and became an anthem for similar movements across the continent. =Big bands (c. 1950‚Äì70)= Into the 1950s, Kinshasa and Brazzaville became culturally linked, and many musicians moved back and forth between them, most importantly Nino Malapet and one of the founders of OK Jazz, Jean Serge Essous. Recording technology had evolved to allow for longer playing times, and the musicians focused on the seben, an instrumental percussion break with a swift tempo that was common in rumba. Both OK Jazz and African Jazz continued performing throughout the decade until African Jazz broke up in the mid-1960s, TPOK Jazz with Franco Luambo Makiadi at the helm dominated soukous music for the next 20 years. Tabu Ley Rochereau and Dr. Nico then formed African Fiesta, which incorporated new innovations from throughout Africa as well as American and British soul, rock and country. African Fiesta, however, lasted only two years before disintegrating, and Tabu Ley formed Orchestre Afrisa International instead, but this new group was not able to rival OK Jazz in influence for very long. Many of the most influential musicians of Congo's history emerged from one or more of these big bands, including the colossus Franco Luambo Makiadi usually referred to simply as \\"Franco\\", Sam Mangwana, Ndombe Opetum, Vicky Longomba, Dizzy Madjeku and Kiamanguana Verckys. Mangwana was the most popular of these solo performers, keeping a loyal fanbase even while switching from Vox Africa and Festival des Marquisards to Afrisa, followed by OK Jazz and a return to Africa before setting up a West African group called the African All Stars. Mose Fan Fan of OK Jazz also proved influential, bringing Congolese rumba to East Africa, especially Kenya, after moving there in 1974 with Somo Somo. Rumba also spread through the rest of Africa, with Brazzaville's Pamelo Mounk'a and Tchico Thicaya moving to Abidjan and Ryco Jazz taking the Congolese sound to the French Antilles. In Congo, students at Gombe High School became entranced with American rock and funk, especially after James Brown visited the country in 1969. Los Nickelos and Thu Zahina emerged from Gombe High, with the former moving to Brussels and the latter, though existing only briefly, becoming legendary for their energetic stage shows that included frenetic, funky drums during the seben and an often psychedelic sound. This period in the late 60s is the soukous era, though the term soukous now has a much broader meaning, and refers to all of the subsequent developments in Congolese music as well. =Zaiko and post Zaiko (c. 1970‚Äì90)= Stukas and Zaiko Langa Langa were the two most influential bands to emerge from this era, with Zaiko Langa Langa being an important starting ground for musicians like Pepe Feli, Bozi Boziana, Evoloko Jocker and Papa Wemba. A smoother, mellower pop sound developed in the early 1970s, led by Bella Bella, Shama Shama and Lipua Lipua, while Kiamanguana Verckys promoted a rougher garage-like sound that launched the careers of Pepe Kalle and Kanda Bongo Man, among others. By the beginning of the 1990s, the Congolese popular music scene had declined terribly. Many of the most popular musicians of the classic era had lost their edge or died, and President Mobutu's regime continued to repress indigenous music, reinforcing Paris' status as a center for Congolese music. Pepe Kalle, Kanda Bongo Man and Rigo Starr were all Paris-based and were the most popular Congolese musicians. New genres like madiaba and Tshala Mwana's mutuashi achieved some popularity. Kinshasa still had popular musicians, however, including Bimi Ombale and Dindo Yogo. In 1993, many of the biggest individuals and bands in Congo's history were brought together for an event that helped to revitalize Congolese music, and also jumpstarted the careers of popular bands like Swede Swede. Another notable feature in Congo culture is its sui generis music. The DRC has blended its ethnic musical sources with rumba and merengue to give birth to Soukous. Influential figures of Soukous and its offshoots (N'dombolo, Rumba Rock) are Franco Luambo, Tabu Ley, Simaro Lutumba, Papa Wemba, Koffi Olomide, Kanda Bongo Man, Ray Lema, Mpongo Love, Abeti Masikini, Reddy Amisi, Pepe Kalle, and Nyoka Longo. One of the most talented and respected pioneers of African rhumba - Tabu Ley Pascal Rochereau. Congolese modern music is also influenced in part by its politics. Zaire, then in 1965, Mobutu Sese Seko took over, and despite massive corruption, desperate economic failure, and the attempted military uprising of 1991, he held on until the eve of his death in 1997, when the president, Laurent Kabila. Kabila inherited a nearly ungovernable shell of a nation. He renamed it the Democratic Republic of the Congo. Kabila could not erase the ruinous effects of the Belgian and Mobutu legacies, and the country is now in a state of chronic civil war. Mobutu instilled a deep fear of dissent and failed to develop his country's vast resources. But the walls he built around his people and his attempts to boost cultural and national pride certainly contributed to the environment that bred Africa's most influential pop music. Call it soukous, rumba, Zairois, Congo music, or kwassa-kwassa, the pop sound emanating from Congo's capital, Kinshasa has shaped modern African culture more profoundly than any other. Africa produces music genres that are direct derivatives of Congolese Soukous. Some of the African bands sing in Lingala, the main language in the DRC. The same Congolese Soukous, under the guidance of \\"le sapeur\\" Papa Wemba, has set the tone for a generation of young guys who dress in expensive designer clothing.The numerous singers and instrumentalists who passed through Zaiko Langa Langa went on to rule Kinshasa's bustling music scene in the '80s with such bands as Choc Stars and Papa Wemba's Viva la Musica. One erstwhile member of Viva la Musica, Koffi Olomid√©, has been indisputably the biggest Zairean/Congolese star since the early '90s. His chief rivals are two veterans of the band Wenge Musica, J.B. Mpiana and Werrason. Mpiana and Werrason each claims to be the originator of ndombolo, a style that intersperses shouts with bursts of vocal melody and harmony over a frenetic din of electric guitars, synthesizers and drums. So pervasive is this style today that even Koffi Olomid√©'s current repertory is mostly ndombolo.

The pirogue sailors of Douala are known for a kind of singing called ngoso which has evolved into a kind of modern music accompanied by zanza, balafon, and various percussion instruments. Traditional Music Lela celebrations in Bali, Cameroon, around 1908. Four men play on holy lela flutes. The celebrations are directed by members of the Bali royal family. The ethnicities of Cameroon include an estimated 250 distinct ethnic groups in five regional-cultural divisions. An estimated 38% of the population are Western highlanders‚ÄìSemi- Bantu or grassfielders including the Bamileke, Bamum, and many smaller Tikar groups in the northwest. 12% are coastal tropical forest peoples, including the Bassa, Duala, and many smaller groups in the southwest. The southern tropical forest peoples (18%) include the Beti-Pahuin and their sub-groups the Bulu and Fang, the Maka and Njem, as well as, the Baka pygmies. In the semi- arid northern regions (the Sahel) and central highlands the Fulani ( or ; ) form an estimated 14% of Cameroonians, while the Kirdi (unbelievers) are a general category, comprising 18% of the population, of various mainly Chadic and Adamawa speakers. =Beti= The Beti, or Ewondo, live in the area around Yaound√© and south into Equatorial Guinea. They are best known for bikutsi music, which has been popularized and become a rival for the more urban and accessible makossa of Douala. The name can be loosely translated as beating the ground continuously. Bikutsi, characterized by an intense 6/8 rhythm, is played at Beti gatherings including parties, funerals, and weddings. Beti gatherings fall into two major categories: *Ekang phase: the time when imaginary, mythological, and spiritual issues are discussed *Bikutsi phase: when real-life issues are discussed A double sided harp with calabash amplification called the mvet is used during these ceremonies by Beti storytellers, who are viewed as using the mvet as an instrument of God to educate the people. The Ekang phase is intensely musical and usually lasts all night. There are poetic recitations accompanied by clapping and dancing, with interludes for improvised and sometimes obscene performances on the balafon (a type of xylophone). These interludes signal the shift to the bikutsi phase which is much less strictly structured than Ekang. During bikutsi, women dance and sing along with the balafon, and lyrics focus on real-life problems, as well as sexual fantasies. These female choruses are an integral part of bikutsi, and their intense dancing and screams are characteristic of the genre. Another type of ceremony is the mevungu, when women dance all night to abstain from sex during those hours for a period of nine days. The sso ritual is much-feared by Beti boys as it involves a series of tests to mark a boy's passage into manhood. Modern popular music Bamileke drummers in Cameroon's West Province. The earliest recorded popular music from Cameroon comes from the 1930s, when the most popular styles were imported pop music and French- style chanson. In Douala, the most developed city in Cameroon, accordions and ambasse bey music were common, with performers like Lobe Lobe, Ebanda Manfred, and Nelle Eyoum finding a local audience. Ekambi Brillant and the first major Cameroonian hit, \\"N'Gon Abo,\\" set the stage for the development of makossa. Post-independence in 1960, a local variant on palm wine music called assiko, was popular especially Jean Bikoko and Dikoume Bernard. The urbanization of Cameroon has had a major influence on the country's music. Migration to the city of Yaound√©, for example, was a major cause for the popularization of bikutsi music. During the 1950s, bars sprang up across the city to accommodate the influx of new inhabitants and soon became a symbol for Cameroonian identity in the face of colonialism. Balafon orchestras, consisting of 3-5 balafons and various percussion instruments (including the balafon, which is both a harmonic and percussive instrument) became common in the bars. Some of these orchestras, such as Richard Band de Zoetele, became quite popular in spite of scorn from the European elite. =1950s and 60s= The middle of the 20th century saw the popularization of a native folk music called bikutsi. Bikutsi is based on a war rhythm played with various rattles and drums and xylophone. Sung by women, bikutsi featured sexually explicit lyrics and songs about everyday problems. In a popularized form, bikutsi gained mainstream success in the 1950s. Anne-Marie Nzi√© was perhaps the most important of the early innovators. The next bikutsi performer of legendary stature was Messi Me Nkonda Martin and his band, Los Camaroes, who added electric guitars and other new elements. Balafon orchestras had remained popular throughout the 1950s in Yaound√©'s bar scene, but the audience demanded modernity, and the popular style at the time was unable to cope. Messi Martin was a Cameroonian guitarist who had been inspired to learn the instrument by listening to Spanish language-broadcasts from neighboring Equatorial Guinea, as well as Cuban, and Zairean rumba. Messi changed the electric guitar by linking the strings together with pieces of paper, thus giving the instrument a damper tone which emitted a \\"thudding\\" sound similar to the balafon. Messi's style was immediately popular, and his hits, like \\"Mengalla Maurice\\" and \\"Bekono Nga N'Konda,\\" became radio favorites throughout the country beginning in the early 1960s. Further innovations followed, as Messi replaced the handclaps and sanza with a synthesizer and the foot-stamping 6/8 rhythm to drums. =1970s= Later in the 1960s, modern makossa developed and became the most popular genre in Cameroon. Makossa is a type of funky dance music, best known outside Africa for Manu Dibango, whose 1972 single \\"Soul Makossa\\" was an international hit. Outside of Africa, Dibango and makossa were only briefly popular, but the genre has produced several pan-African superstars through the 1970s, 1980s and 1990s. Following Dibango, a wave of musicians electrified makossa in an attempt at making it more accessible outside of Cameroon. Another pop singer in 1970s Cameroon was Andr√©-Marie Tala, a blind singer who had a pair of hits with \\"Sikati\\" and \\"Potaksima.\\" By the 1970s, bikutsi performers like Maurice Elanga, Les Veterans, and Mbarga Soukous, added brass instruments and found controversy over pornographic lyrics. Mama Ohandja also brought bikutsi to new audiences, especially in Europe. The following decade, however, saw Les Tetes Brul√©es surpass previous artists in international popularity though their reaction at home was mixed. Many listeners did not like their mellow, almost easy listening-styled bikutsi. Cameroonian audiences preferred more roots- based performers like Jimmy Mvondo Mvel√© and Uta Bella, both from Yaound√©. =1980s= Ben Decca By the 1980s, makossa had moved to Paris and a new pop- makossa fused elements of Antillean zouk. Prominent musicians from this period included Moni Bil√©, Douleur, B√©b√© Manga, , Petit-Pays, and Esa. The 1980s also saw rapid development of Cameroon's media which saw a flourishing of both makossa and bikutsi. In 1980, L'Equipe Nationale de Makossa was formed, joining the biggest makossa stars of the period together, including, Grace Decca, Ndedi Eyango, Ben Decca, Guy Lobe, and Dina Bell. Makossa in the 1980s saw a wave of mainstream success across Africa and, to a lesser degree, abroad as Latin influences, Martinican zouk, and pop music changed its form. While makossa enjoyed international renown, bikutsi was often denigrated as the music of savages, and it did not appeal across ethnic lines and into urban areas. Musicians continued to add innovations, however, and improved recording techniques; Nkondo Si Tony, for example, added keyboards and synthesizers while Elanga Maurice added brass instruments. Les Veterans emerged as the most famous bikutsi group in the 1980s while other prominent performers included Titans de Sangmelima, Seba Georges, Ange Ebogo Emerent, Otheo and Mekongo President, who added complex harmonies and jazz influences. In 1984, a new wave of bikutsi artists emerged, including Sala Bekono formerly of Los Camaroes, Atebass, a bassist, and Zanzibar, a guitarist who would eventually help form Les T√™tes Brul√©es with Jean-Marie Ahanda. 1985 saw the formation of CRTV, a television network that did much to help popularize Cameroonian popular music across the country. Jean-Marie Ahanda became the most influential bikutsi performer of the late 1980s, and he revolutionized the genre in 1987 after forming Les T√™tes Brul√©es, whose success changed the Cameroonian music industry. The band played an extremely popular form of bikutsi that allowed for greater depth and diversity. Guitarist Zanzibar added foam rubber to the bridge of his guitar, which made the instrument sound more like a balafon than before, and was more aggressive and innovative than previous musicians. Les T√™tes Brul√©es emerged as a reaction against pop- makossa, which was seen as abandoning its roots in favor of mainstream success. The band's image was part of its success, and they became known for their shaved heads and multi-colored body painting, done to represent traditional Beti scarification, as well as torn T-shirts that implied a common folkness in contrast to the well-styled pop-makossa performers of the period. They also wore backpacks on stage, a reference to Beti women's traditional method of carrying babies while they danced bikutsi. It took only a few weeks for Les T√™tes Brul√©es to knock makossa off the Cameroonian charts, and the band even toured France. While in France, Les T√™tes Brul√©es recorded their first LP, Hot Heads, which was also the first bikutsi music recorded for the CD. Hot Heads expanded the lyrical format of the genre to include socio- political issues. Tours of Japan, Africa, Europe, and the United States followed, as well as Claire Denis' film Man No Run, which used footage from their European tour. =1990s= In the 1990s, both makossa and bikutsi declined in popularity as a new wave of genres entered mainstream audiences. These included Congolese-influenced new rumba and makossa-soukous, as well as more native forms like bantowbol, northern Cameroonian nganja (which had gained some popularity in the United Kingdom in the mid-1980s), and an urban street music called bend-skin. Les T√™tes Brul√©es remained the country's most well known musical export, especially after accompanying the Cameroonian soccer team to the World Cup in 1990 in Italy and 1994 in the United States. A new wave of bikutsi artists arose in the early 1990s, including Les Martiens (formed by Les T√™tes Brul√©es bassist Atebass) and the sexually themed roots- singer Katino Ateba (\\"Ascenseur: le secret de l'homme\\") and Douala singer Sissi Dipoko (\\"Bikut-si Hit\\") as well as a resurgence of old performers like Sala Bekono. Bikutsi's international renown continued to grow, and the song \\"Proof\\" from Paul Simon's Rhythm of the Saints, released to mainstream promotion and success in 1990, gained yet more renown from international audiences. Vincent Nguini also contributed guitar arrangements and performance to Simon's Rhythm of the Saints, which became an influential world music album, introducing many North American listeners to the wide range of instrumentation and genres. In 1993, the Pedal√© movement was born as a reaction to the Cameroonian economic slump. Youthful artists like Gibraltar Drakuss, Zele le Bombardier, Eboue Chaleur, Pasto, Roger Bekono, Mbarga Soukous, and Saint-Desir√© Atango was a return to the aggressive, earthy sound of bikutsi roots. Meanwhile, Henri Dikongu√©, whose music incorporated, amongst others, bikutsi and makossa, began to release albums which met international success. He went on to tour Europe and North America. The most recent form of Cameroonian popular music is a fusion of Congolese soukous and makossa, a scene which has produced Petit Pays, Marcel Bwanga, Kotto Bass, Papillon and Jean Pierre Essome. Other popular genres include Bend-skin, mangambeu, and makassi. References *Nkolo, Jean-Victor and Graeme Ewens. \\"Music of a Small Continent\\". 2000.

The most popular style of modern dance music is marrabenta. Mozambican music also influenced another Lusophone music in Brazil, like maxixe (its name derived from Maxixe in Mozambique), and Cuban music like Mozambique. Culture was an integral part of the struggle for independence, which began in 1964. Leaders of the independence movement used cultural solidarity to gain support from the common people, while the Portuguese colonialists promoted their own culture. By the time independence came in 1975, Mozambican bands had abandoned their previous attempts at European-style music, and began forging new forms based out of local folk styles and the new African popular music coming from Zaire, Zimbabwe, Tanzania, Zambia and South Africa. In 1978, the Ministry of Education and Culture organized a National Dance Festival that involved more than half a million people, and led to the creation of numerous organizations and festivals promoting Mozambican music. Timbila The Chopi people of the coastal Inhambane Province are known for a unique kind of xylophone called mbila (pl: timbila) and the style of music played with it, which \\"is believed to be the most sophisticated method of composition yet found among preliterate peoples.\\" Ensembles consist of around ten xylophones of four sizes and accompany ceremonial dances with long compositions called ngomi which consist of an overture and ten movements of different tempos and styles. The ensemble leader serves as poet, composer, conductor, and performer, creating a text, improvising a melody partially based on the features of the Chopi's tone language, and composing a second countrapuntal line. The musicians of the ensemble partially improvise their parts according to style, instrumental idiom, and the leader's indications. The composer then consults with the choreographer of the ceremony and adjustments are made. (Nettl 1956, p. 18-19) Marrabenta Marrabenta is the best-known form of music from Mozambique. It is urban in origin, and meant for dancing. Marrabenta was born as a fusion of imported European music played on improvised materials. The word marrabenta derives from the Portuguese rebentar (arrabentar in the local vernacular), meaning to break, a reference to cheap guitar strings that snapped quickly. Instruments were fashioned out of tin cans and pieces of wood. Lyrics were usually in local languages, and included songs of social criticism as well as love. Additionally, there are songs whose lyrics are in Portuguese, the official language of Mozambique, for nationwide and international promotion of the songs to other CPLP nations. The late 1970s saw tremendous innovation in marrabenta, as 1001 Music Productions recorded artists and staged large concerts. The compilation album Amanhecer was released, followed by more such LPs under the title Ngoma. The most influential early marrabenta performer was Fany Pfumo, whose fame began after the success of \\"Loko ni kumbuka Jorgina\\". He recorded in South Africa on HMV and later incorporated South African kwela into his music. The group Orchestra Marrabenta Star de Mo√ßambique formed in 1979, led by long-time performer Wazimbo. The group toured Europe and other parts of the world, and soon brought international recognition to marrabenta. Many of the most popular musicians in modern Mozambique spent time with Orchestra Marrabenta Star de Mo√ßambique, including Stewart Sukuma, Chico Ant√≥nio, Mr. Bow, Neyma, Jos√© Mucavel and Mingas, while other popular bands include Ghorwane. Pandza Pandza is the newest and most-popular style of Mozambican music, credited to be invented by N'Star, Ziqo and Dj Ardiles in Maputo. Pandza is especially popular amongst Mozambican youths and is a mix of Marrabenta and Ragga. The roots of Pandza originate from Marrabenta but Pandza has a more faster tempo with major influences from Ragga and some Hip Hop. Most of Pandza is mostly song in Portuguese and the Shangana language from Maputo and its lyrics most of the time, elaborate the social daily lifestyles of young Mozambicans. The most notable Pandza singers in Mozambique today include, Lizha James, Ziqo, Dj Ardiles, N'star, DH, Mr. Kuka, MC Roger, Denny Og, Dj Junior, C√≠zer Boss.

Beginning around 1500 CE, the Beothuk culture formed. This appeared to be the most recent cultural manifestation of peoples who first migrated from Labrador to present-day Newfoundland around AD 1. The ancestors of this group had three earlier cultural phases, each lasting approximately 500 years.Marshall, 1996, p. 7‚Äì10.  Description  The Beothuk lived throughout the island of Newfoundland, particularly in the Notre Dame and Bonavista Bay areas. Estimates vary as to the number of Beothuk at the time of contact with Europeans. Beothuk researcher Ingeborg Marshall has argued that a valid understanding of Beothuk history and culture is directly impacted by how and by whom historical records were created, pointing to the ethnocentric nature of European accounts which positioned native populations as inherently inferior.Marshall, 1996, p. 7. Scholars of the 19th and early 20th century estimated about 2,000 individuals at the time of European contact in the 15th century. There is purportedly good evidence that there may have been no more than 500 to 700 people.Distribution and Size of the Beothuk Population, Leadership, and Communal Activities - A History and Ethnography of the Beothuk They lived in independent, self-sufficient, extended family groups of 30 to 55 people.Marshall, 1996, p. 12. Like many other hunter-gathering peoples, they appear to have had band leaders but probably not more formal \\"chiefs\\". They lived in conical dwellings known as mamateeks, which were fortified for the winter season. These were constructed by arranging poles in a circle, tying them at the top, and covering them with birch bark. The floors were dug with hollows used for sleeping. A fireplace was made at the center. During spring, the Beothuk used red ochre to paint not only their bodies but also their houses, canoes, weapons, household appliances, and musical instruments. This practice led Europeans to refer to them as \\"Red Indians\\". The use of ochre had great cultural significance. The decorating was done during an annual multi- day spring celebration. It designated tribal identity; for example, decorating newborn children was a way to welcome them into the tribe. Forbidding a person to wear ochre was a form of punishment. Their main sources of food were caribou, salmon, and seals, augmented by harvesting other animal and plant species. The Beothuk followed the seasonal migratory habits of their principal quarry. In the fall, they set up deer fences, sometimes long, used to drive migrating caribou toward waiting hunters armed with bows and arrows. (Reprint, Toronto: Canadiana House, 1969) The Beothuk are also known to have made a pudding out of tree sap and the dried yolk of the eggs of the great auk. They preserved surplus food for use during winter, trapped various fur-bearing animals, and worked their skins for warm clothing. The fur side was worn next to the skin, to trap air against a person's body. Beothuk canoes were made of caribou or seal skin, and the bow of the canoe was stiffened with spruce bark. Canoes resembled kayaks and were said to be in length and in width with enough room to carry children, dogs and property. The Beothuk followed elaborate burial practices. After wrapping the bodies in birch bark, they buried the dead in isolated locations. In one form, a shallow grave was covered with a rock pile. At other times they laid the body on a scaffold, or placed it in a burial box, with the knees folded. The survivors placed offerings at burial sites to accompany the dead, such as figurines, pendants, and replicas of tools.  European exploration  Tribal territory of Beothuk About 1000 AD, Norse explorers encountered natives in northern Newfoundland, who may have been ancestors of the later Beothuk, or Dorset inhabitants of Labrador and Newfoundland. The Norse called them skr√¶lingjar (\\"skraelings\\" or barbarians). Beginning in 1497, with the arrival of the Italian John Cabot, sailing under the auspices of the English crown, waves of European explorers and settlers had more contacts. Unlike some other native groups, the Beothuk tried to avoid contact with Europeans; they moved inland as European settlements grew. The Beothuk visited their former camps only to pick up metal objects. They would also collect any tools, shelters, and building materials left by the European fishermen who had dried and cured their catch before taking it to Europe at the end of the season. Contact between Europeans and the Beothuk was usually negative for one side, with a few exceptions like John Guy's party in 1612. Settlers and the Beothuk competed for natural resources such as salmon, seals, and birds. In the interior, fur trappers established traplines, disrupted the caribou hunts, and pillaged Beothuk stores, camps and supplies. The Beothuk would steal traps to reuse the metals, and steal from the homes and shelters of Europeans and sometimes ambush them. These encounters led to enmity and mutual violence. With superior arms technology, the settlers generally had the upper hand in hunting and warfare. (Unlike other indigenous peoples, the Beothuk appeared to have had no interest in adopting firearms.)Marshall, 1996, p. 33. Intermittently, Europeans attempted to improve relations with the Beothuk. Examples included expeditions by naval lieutenants George Cartwright in 1768 and David Buchan in 1811. Cartwright's expedition was commissioned by Governor Hugh Palliser; he found no Beothuk, but brought back important cultural information. Governor John Duckworth commissioned Buchan's expedition. Although undertaken for information gathering, this expedition ended in violence. Buchan's party encountered several Beothuk near Red Indian Lake. After an initially friendly reception, Buchan left two of his men behind with the Beothuk. The next day, he found them murdered and mutilated. According to the Beothuk Shanawdithit's later account, the marines were killed when one refused to give up his jacket and both ran away. In 2010, a team of European researchers announced the discovery of a previously unknown mitochondrial DNA sequence in Iceland, which they further suggest may have New World origins. If the latter is true, one possible explanation for its appearance in modern Iceland would be intermarriage with a North American indigenous woman, possibly a Beothuk.  Causes of starvation  The Beothuks attempted to avoid Europeans in Newfoundland by moving inland from their traditional settlements. First, they attempted to move to different coastal areas of Newfoundland where the Europeans did not have fishing camps set up, but soon they were so overrun that they had to move into inland Newfoundland.{Margaret Conrad, History of the Canadian Peoples fifth edition pg 256-257} The Beothuks' main food sources had traditionally been caribou, fish, and seals, but their forced migration inland deprived them of two of these. This led to the over-hunting of caribou to survive, which soon led to a decrease in the caribou population in Newfoundland. The Beothuks were put into a position where they were forced from their traditional land and lifestyle into ecosystems that could not support them and that led to undernourishment and eventually starvation.  Extinction  Suzannah Anstey (n√©e Manuel. 1832‚Äì1911). Daughter of Beothuk woman called 'Elizabeth' & husband Samuel Anstey (1832‚Äì1923). Twillingate Mary Pond (n√©e Anstey) 1858‚Äì1895. Granddaughter of Beothuk woman known as 'Elizabeth'. Twillingate Population estimates of Beothuks remaining at the end of the first decade of the 19th century vary widely, from about 150 up to 3,000.Marshall, 1996, p. 147. Information about the Beothuk was based on accounts by the woman Shanawdithit, who told about the people who \\"wintered on the Exploits River or at Red Indian Lake and resorted to the coast in Notre Dame Bay\\". References in records also noted some survivors on the Northern Peninsula in the early 19th century.Marshall, 1996, p. 208. During the colonial period, the Beothuk people also endured territorial pressure from Native groups: Mi'kmaq migrants from Cape Breton Island, and Inuit from Labrador. \\"The Beothuk were unable to procure sufficient subsistence within the areas left to them.\\" They entered into a cycle of violence with some of the newcomers. Beothuk numbers dwindled rapidly due to a combination of factors, including: * loss of access to important food sources, from the competition with Inuit and Mi'kmaq as well as European settlers; * infectious diseases to which they had no immunity, such as smallpox, introduced by European contact; * endemic tuberculosis (TB), which weakened tribal members; and * violent encounters with trappers, settlers, and other natives. By 1829, with the death of Shanawdithit, the people were officially declared extinct. Oral histories suggest that a few Beothuk survived for some years around the region of the Exploits River, Twillingate, Newfoundland; and Labrador; and formed unions with European colonists, Inuit and Mi'kmaq.Marshall, 1996, p. 224-6. Some families from Twillingate claim partial descent from the Beothuk people of the early 19th century. In 1910 a 75-year-old Native woman named Santu Toney, who said she was the daughter of a Mi'kmaq mother and a Beothuk father, recorded a song in the Beothuk language for the American anthropologist Frank Speck. He was doing field studies in the area. She said her father had taught her the song. Since Santu Toney was born about 1835, this may be evidence that some Beothuk people survived beyond the death of Shanawdithit in 1829. Contemporary researchers have tried to transcribe the song, as well as improve the recording by current methods. Native groups have learned the song to use in celebrations of tradition.  Genocide  Historians sometimes disagree over what constitutes genocide, and their disagreements may be based on political agendas. If a campaign of genocide occurred, it was explicitly without official sanction no later than 1759, any such action thereafter being in violation of Governor John Byron's proclamation criminalizing violence against the Beothuk, as well as the subsequent Proclamation issued by Governor John Holloway on July 30, 1807, which prohibited mistreatment of the Beothuk and offered a reward for any information on such mistreatment.  Notable Beothuk captives  Several Beothuk persons captured by the English were well documented. = Demasduit = Demasduit, 1819 Demasduit was a Beothuk woman who is thought to have been about 23 years old when she was captured by the British near Red Indian Lake in March 1819. The governor of Newfoundland was seeking to encourage trade and end hostilities between the Beothuk and the British. But he approved an expedition, to be led by Captain David Buchan, to recover a boat and other fishing gear that had been stolen by the Beothuk. John Peyton Jr. led one of the groups. His father was John Peyton Sr., a salmon fisherman known for his hostility toward the small tribe. On a raid, Peyton's group killed Demasduit's husband Nonosbawsut, then ran her down in the snow. She pleaded for her life, baring her breasts to show she was a nursing mother. They took Demasduit to Twillingate, where Peyton Jr. earned a bounty on her. Her baby died. Peyton Jr. was later appointed Justice of the Peace at Twillingate, Newfoundland. The British called Demasduit Mary March after the month when she was taken. Officials later took her to St. John's, Newfoundland. The colonial government hoped to make Demasduit comfortable while she was with the British so that one day she might be a bridge between them and the Beothuk. Demasduit learned some English and taught the settlers about 200 words of the Beothuk language. In January 1820, Demasduit was released to rejoin her kin, but she died of tuberculosis while making the trip back to Notre Dame Bay. = Shanawdithit = Shanawdithit was Demasduit's niece and the last known full-blooded Beothuk. In April 1823 she was in her early twenties when she, her mother, and sister sought food and help from a British trapper. They were starving. The three were taken to St. John's, where her mother and sister soon died of tuberculosis, which was endemic among the First Nations. Called Nancy April by the British, Shanawdithit lived for several years in the home of John Peyton, Jr., where she worked as a servant. The explorer William Cormack had founded the Beothuk Institute in 1827 to foster friendly dealings with the Beothuk and support their culture. His expeditions found Beothuk artifacts but he also learned that the group was dying out. Learning of Shanawdithit, in the winter 1828‚Äì1829, Cormack brought her to his center so he could learn from her.James P. Howley, F.G.S., \\"Drawings by Shanawdithit\\", The Beothucks or Red Indians: The Aboriginal Inhabitants of Newfoundland, Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1915, Memorial University of Newfoundland & Labrador Website He drew funds from his institute to pay for her support. Shanawdithit made ten drawings for Cormack, some of which showed parts of the island, and others illustrated Beothuk implements and dwellings, along with tribal notions and myths. As she explained her drawings, she taught Cormack Beothuk vocabulary. She told him there were far fewer Beothuk than twenty years previously. To her knowledge, at the time she was taken, only a dozen Beothuk survived. Despite medical care from the doctor William Carson, Shanawdithit died of tuberculosis in Botwood on June 6, 1829. At the time there was no known cure for the disease.  Archaeology  The Beothuk tribe of Newfoundland is extinct as a cultural group. It is represented in museum, historical and archaeological records. The area around eastern Notre Dame Bay, on the northeast coast of Newfoundland, has been found to contain numerous archeological sites containing material from indigenous cultures. One of them is the Boyd's Cove site. Situated at the foot of a bay, it is protected by a maze of islands that shelter it from waves and winds. The site was found in 1981 during an archeological survey to locate Beothuk sites, in order to study their artifacts and gain more insight into Beothuk culture. Existing historical records were too limited to answer a number of important questions about the people. Few record-keeping Europeans had been in contact with the Beothuk, and information about their lives has been more limited. By contrast, peoples such as the Huron or the Mi'kmaq interacted with the French missionaries, who studied and taught them and had extensive trade with French, Dutch, and English, all of whom made records of their encounters. Numerous historical references document a Beothuk presence in the region of Notre Dame Bay, especially in the last half of the 18th and early part of the 19th century. Previous archaeological surveys and amateur finds indicated that it was likely that the Beothuk had lived in the area prior to European encounter. Eastern Notre Dame Bay has been known for its rich animal and fish life: seals, fish, and seabirds, and its hinterland supported large caribou herds. Archaeologists found 16 Aboriginal sites, ranging in age from the Maritime Archaic Indian era (7000 BC ‚Äì modern) through the Palaeo-Eskimo period, down to the Recent Indian (which includes the Beothuk) occupation. Two of the sites have been found to be associated with the historical Beothuk. Boyd's Cove, the larger of the two, is 3000 sq. m. and is located on top of a 6-m glacial moraine. The coarse sand, gravel, and boulders were left behind by glaciers. The artifacts have provided answers to an economic question: why the Beothuk refrained from the fur trade with Europeans. The interiors of four houses and their environs produced some 1,157 nails, the majority of which had been worked by the Beothuk. The site's occupants had manufactured some 67 projectile points (most made from nails and bones). They had also modified nails to use as what are believed to be scrapers to remove fat from animal hides, they straightened fish hooks and adapted them as awls, they fashioned lead into ornaments, and so on. In summary, the Boyd's Cove Beothuk took debris from an early modern European fishery and refashioned materials for their own purposes.  Genetics  In 2007, DNA testing was conducted on material from the teeth of Demasduit and her husband Nonosabasut, two Beothuk individuals who had died in the 1820s. The results assigned them to Haplogroup X (mtDNA) and Haplogroup C (mtDNA), respectively, which are also found in current Mi'kmaq populations in Newfoundland. It also demonstrated they were solely of First Nation indigenous maternal ancestry, unlike some earlier studies that suggested European admixture. However, a 2011 analysis showed that although the two Beothuk and living Mi'kmaq occur in the same haplogroups, SNP differences between Beothuk and Mi'kmaq individuals indicated that they were dissimilar within those groups, and that a \\"close relationship\\" was not supported.

History Burma-Shave was introduced in 1925 by the Burma-Vita company in Minneapolis owned by Clinton Odell. The company's original product was a liniment made of ingredients described as having come \\"from the Malay Peninsula and Burma\\" (hence its name). Sales were sparse, and the company sought to expand sales by introducing a product with wider appeal. The result was the Burma-Shave brand of brushless shaving cream and its supporting advertising program. Sales increased. At its peak, Burma-Shave was the second-highest-selling brushless shaving cream in the US. Sales declined in the 1950s, and in 1963 the company was sold to Philip Morris. Its well known advertising signs were removed at that time. The brand decreased in visibility and eventually became the property of the American Safety Razor Company. In 1997, the American Safety Razor Company reintroduced the Burma-Shave brand with a nostalgic shaving soap and brush kit, though the original Burma-Shave was a brushless shaving cream, and Burma-Shave's own roadside signs frequently ridiculed \\"Grandpa's old- fashioned shaving brush.\\" Roadside billboards Set of signs promoting Burma-Shave, on U.S. Route 66. Burma-Shave sign series first appeared on U.S. Highway 65 near Lakeville, Minnesota, in 1926, and remained a major advertising component until 1963 in most of the contiguous United States. The first series read: Cheer up, face ‚Äì the war is over! Burma-Shave. The exceptions were Nevada (deemed to have insufficient road traffic), and Massachusetts (eliminated due to that state's high land rentals and roadside foliage). Typically, six consecutive small signs would be posted along the edge of highways, spaced for sequential reading by passing motorists. The last sign was almost always the name of the product. The signs were originally produced in two color combinations: red-and-white and orange-and-black, though the latter was eliminated after a few years. A special white-on-blue set of signs was developed for South Dakota, which restricted the color red on roadside signs to official warning notices. This use of a series of small signs, each of which bore part of a commercial message, was a successful approach to highway advertising during the early years of highway travel, drawing the attention of passing motorists who were curious to learn the punchline. As the Interstate system expanded in the late 1950s and vehicle speeds increased, it became more difficult to attract motorists' attention with small signs. When the company was acquired by Philip Morris, the signs were discontinued on advice of counsel. Some of the signs featured safety messages about speeding instead of advertisements. Examples of Burma-Shave advertisements are at The House on the Rock in Spring Green, Wisconsin. Re- creations of Burma-Shave sign sets also appear on Arizona State Highway 66, part of the original U.S. Route 66, between Ash Fork, Arizona, and Kingman, Arizona, (though they were not installed there by Burma-Shave during its original campaigns) and on Old U.S. Highway 30 near Ogden, Iowa. Other examples are displayed at The Henry Ford in Dearborn, Michigan, the Interstate 44 in Missouri rest area between Rolla and Springfield (which has old Route 66 building picnic structures), the Forney Transportation Museum in Denver, Colorado and the Virginia Museum of Transportation in Roanoke, Virginia. =Examples= The complete list of the 600 or so known sets of signs is listed in Sunday Drives and in the last part of The Verse by the Side of the Road. The content of the earliest signs is lost, but it is believed that the first recorded signs, for 1927 and soon after, are close to the originals. The first ones were prosaic advertisements. Generally the signs were printed with all capital letters. The style shown below is for readability: *Shave the modern way / No brush / No lather / No rub-in / Big tube 35 cents ‚Äì Drug stores / Burma-Shave As early as 1928, the writers were displaying a puckish sense of humor: *Takes the \\"H\\" out of shave / Makes it save / Saves complexion / Saves time and money / No brush ‚Äì no lather / Burma-Shave In 1929, the prosaic ads began to be replaced by actual verses on four signs, with the fifth sign merely a filler for the sixth: *Every shaver / Now can snore / Six more minutes / Than before / By using / Burma-Shave *Your shaving brush / Has had its day / So why not / Shave the modern way / With / Burma-Shave Previously there were only two to four sets of signs per year. 1930 saw major growth in the company, and 19 sets of signs were produced. The writers recycled a previous joke. They continued to ridicule the \\"old\\" style of shaving. And they began to appeal to the wives as well: *Cheer up face / The war is past / The \\"H\\" is out / Of shave / At last / Burma-Shave *Shaving brushes / You'll soon see 'em / On the shelf / In some / Museum / Burma-Shave *Does your husband / Misbehave / Grunt and grumble / Rant and rave / Shoot the brute some / Burma-Shave In 1931, the writers began to reveal a \\"cringe factor\\" side to their creativity, which would increase over time: *No matter / How you slice it / It's still your face / Be humane / Use / Burma-Shave In 1932, the company recognized the popularity of the signs with a self- referencing gimmick: *Free / Illustrated / Jingle book / In every / Package / Burma-Shave *A shave / That's real / No cuts to heal / A soothing / Velvet after-feel / Burma-Shave In 1935, the first known appearance of a road safety message appeared, combined with a punning sales pitch: *Train approaching / Whistle squealing / Stop / Avoid that run-down feeling / Burma-Shave *Keep well / To the right / Of the oncoming car / Get your close shaves / From the half pound jar / Burma-Shave Safety messages began to increase in 1939, as these examples show. (The first of the four is a parody of \\"Paul Revere's Ride\\" by Henry Wadsworth Longfellow.) *Hardly a driver / Is now alive / Who passed / On hills / At 75 / Burma-Shave *Past / Schoolhouses / Take it slow / Let the little / Shavers grow / Burma-Shave *If you dislike / Big traffic fines / Slow down / Till you / Can read these signs / Burma-Shave *Don't take / a curve / at 60 per. / We hate to lose / a customer / Burma-Shave In 1939 and subsequent years, demise of the signs was foreshadowed, as busy roadways approaching larger cities featured shortened versions of the slogans on one, two, or three signs -- the exact count is not recorded. The puns include a play on the Maxwell House Coffee slogan, standard puns, and yet another reference to the \\"H\\" joke: *Good to the last strop *Covers a multitude of chins *Takes the \\"H\\" out of shaving The war years found the company recycling a lot of their old signs, with new ones mostly focusing on World War II propaganda: *Let's make Hitler / And Hirohito / Feel as bad / as Old Benito / Buy War Bonds / Burma-Shave *Slap / The Jap / With / Iron / Scrap / Burma- Shave A 1944 advertisement in Life magazine ran: :TOUGH-WHISKERED YANKS / IN HEAVY TANKS :HAVE JAWS AS SMOOTH / AS GUYS IN BANKS 1963 was the last year for the signs, most of which were repeats, including the final slogan, which had first appeared in 1953: *Our fortune / Is your / Shaven face / It's our best / Advertising space / Burma-Shave =Special promotional messages= *Free offer! Free offer! / Rip a fender off your car / mail it in / for a half-pound jar / Burma-Shave ::A large number of fenders were received by the company, which made good on its promise. *Free ‚Äì free / a trip to Mars / for 900 / empty jars / Burma-Shave ::Arlyss French, owner of a Red Owl grocery store, did submit 900 empty jars; the company at first replied: \\"If a trip to Mars / you earn / remember, friend / there's no return.\\" Then Burma-Shave, on the recommendation of Red Owl's publicity team, withdrew the one-way offer and instead sent Mr. and Mrs. French on vacation to the town of Moers (often pronounced \\"Mars\\" by foreigners) near Duisburg, North Rhine-Westphalia, Germany. = Cultural impact = A number of films and television shows set between the 1920s and 1950s have used the Burma-Shave roadside billboards to help set the scene. Examples include Bonnie and Clyde, A River Runs Through It, The World's Fastest Indian, Stand By Me, Tom and Jerry, M*A*S*H and the pilot episode (\\"Genesis\\") of Quantum Leap. The long-running series Hee Haw borrowed the style for program bumpers, transitioning from one show segment to the next or to commercials. The final episode of the popular television series M*A*S*H featured a series of road signs in Korea \\"Hawk was gone, now he's here. Dance til dawn, give a cheer. Burma-Shave\\". Roger Miller's song \\"Burma Shave\\" (the B-side to his 1961 single \\"Fair Swiss Maiden\\") has the singer musing that he's \\"seen a million rows of them little red poetic signs up and down the line\\", while reciting rhymes in the manner of the ads. Tom Waits' song \\"Burma-Shave\\" (from his 1977 album Foreign Affairs) uses the signs as an allegory for an unknown destination. (\\"I guess I'm headed that-a-way, Just as long as it's paved, I guess you'd say I'm on my way to Burma-Shave\\") Chuck Suchy's song \\"Burma Shave Boogie\\" (from his 2008 album Unraveling Heart) incorporates several of the Burma Shave rhymes into its lyrics. The pedestrian passageway between the Times Square‚Äì42nd Street/Port Authority Bus Terminal stations in the New York City Subway system contains a piece of public art inspired by the Burma-Shave ads; Norman B. Colp's The Commuter's Lament, or A Close Shave consists of a series of signs attached to the roof of the passageway, displaying the following text: :Overslept, / So tired. / If late, / Get fired. / Why bother? / Why the pain? / Just go home / Do it again. Several highway departments in the United States use signs in the same style to dispense travel safety advice to motorists. Several writers of doggerel and humorously bad poetry (such as David Burge) often use \\"Burma Shave\\" as the last line of their poems to indicate their non-serious nature. An example of political \\"burmashaving\\" signs at Confusion Corner, Winnipeg. The word \\"burmashaving\\" is used in Canada to describe politicians holding signs and waving to traffic by the side of the road, a common sight during election campaigns.\\"Election apathy even hits voters' bellies.\\" The Royal City Record, New Westminster, British Columbia, 13 April 2011. One of the first to use the phrase was Nova Scotia Progressive Conservative premier John Buchanan, who would stand at the end of a long line of party signs and wave to morning traffic.

Post-independence, the philosophy of negritude arose, which espoused the idea that the griot traditions of Senegal were as valid, classical and meaningful as French classical music. The first President of Senegal, L√©opold S√©dar Senghor (also a poet) was one of the primary exponents of this. The national anthem of Senegal, \\"Pincez tous vos koras, frappez les balafons\\" (\\"Pluck all your koras, strike the balafons\\"), was adopted in 1960. Its lyrics, by president Senghor, refer to the Malian music tradition, while its music was composed by Herbert Pepper (fr).

Individual motifs may represent the history and genealogy of a particular family and are used during weddings, naming ceremonies, funerals etc. Popular music after independence =1950s and 1960s= Prior to independence, Senegalese popular music consisted of nightclub dance bands (orchestres) that played European music, namely American and French songs. As independence approach and the country sought to move away from their colonial past, the popular music of Senegal began to be influenced by the Cuban music that was becoming popular throughout Africa. Ibra Kasse's Star Band was the most famous orchestre of the 1960s and 1970s and was a leader in the modernization of Senegalese music. Super Star de Dakar, led by Nigerian saxophonist, Dexter Johnson, spun off from the Star Band and was the other leading band in Dakar in the 1960s. Both played a style that was heavily influenced by Cuban music but had elements of traditional African music. The south of Senegal, called Casamance, has a strong Mandinka minority, and began projfdvfdb-jhbrg masters of the kora in the late 1950s. The band Tour√© Kunda was the most popular group to arise from this scene, and they soon began playing large concerts across the world. =1970s and 1980s= The 1970s saw the increased influence of traditional Senegalese music. Traditional drums like the saber and the tama were introduced by leading orchestras and the music progressed from predominately Latin-influenced to the Senegalese style known as Mbalax. The Star Band and three of its off-shoots from the 1970s were important in the evolution of the music. In 1970, Orchestra Baobab brake away from the Star Band followed by No. One de Dakar in 1976. All three bands now played a proto-Mbalax which incorporated local influences into the Latin dance styles. In the town of Thi√®s, Royal Band de Thi√®s and Dieuf Dieul de Thi√®s are also considered influential in the evolution of Senegalese popular music. In 1977, the entire rhythm section and many other performers in the Star Band left to form √âtoile de Dakar, who are often considered the first band to play Mbalax. They quickly eclipsed their compatriots, launching the careers of El Hadji Faye and Youssou N'Dour. Faye and N'Dour were Senegal's first pop stars, but the stress of fame soon drove the band apart. Faye and guitarist Badou N'diaye formed √âtoile 2000, releasing a hit with \\"Boubou N'Gary\\", but soon disappearing after three similar-sounding albums. N'Dour and other members of √âtoile de Dakar became known as Super √âtoile de Dakar and released four albums within a few months. Super √âtoile de Dakar evolved into N'Dour's backing band. He was soon by far the most popular performer in the country, and perhaps in all of West Africa. He introduced more traditional elements to his Senegalized Cuban music, including traditional rapping (tassou), njuup, bakou music (a kind of trilling that accompanies Serer wrestling) and instruments like the sabar. While N'Dour Africanized Cuban music, another influential band, Xalam, was doing the same with American funk and jazz. They formed in 1970, led then by drummer Prosper Niang, but their controversial lyrics and unfamiliar jazz sound led to a lack of popularity, and the group moved to Paris in 1973. There, they added Jean- Philippe Rykiel on keyboards. Xalam toured with groups such as Rolling Stones and Crosby, Stills, Nash & Young, finally achieving success in Senegal with 1988's Xarit. In the latter part of the 1970s, the band Super Diamono formed, fusing mbalax rhythms and militant populism with jazz and reggae influences. Their 1982 Jigenu Ndakaru was especially popular. By the middle of the 1980s, Super Diamono was one of the top bands in Senegal, in close and fierce competition with Super √âtoile de Dakar. The band's popularity declined, however, slowed somewhat by Omar Pene's reformation in 1991. This mix is an example of mostly Senegalese music from the 1970s and 1980s but some other African countries are represented as well: https://soundcloud.com/trushmix/trushmix-85-kokk-n-roll =1990s to the present= Into the 1990s, Thione Seck, a griot descended from those of Lat Dior, the king of Kayor, arose to solo stardome from Orchestra Baobab, eventually forming his own band called Raam Daan (crawl slowly towards your goal). He used electric instruments on many popular releases, especially Diongoma and Demb. The same period saw the rise of Ismael L√¥, a member of Super Diamono, who had major hits, including \\"Attaya\\", \\"Ceddo\\" and \\"Jele bi\\". Baaba Maal is another popular Senegalese singer. He is from Podor and won a scholarship to study music in Paris. After returning, he studied traditional music with his blind guitarist and family griot, Mansour Seck, and began performing with the band Daande Lenol. His Djam Leelii, recorded in 1984, became a critical sensation in the United Kingdom after it was released there in 1989. Maal's fusions continued into the next decade, with his Firin' in Fouta (1994) album, which used ragga, salsa and Breton harp music to create a popular sound that launched the careers of Positive Black Soul, a group of rappers, and also led to the formation of the Afro-Celt Sound System. His fusion tendencies continued on 1998's Nomad Soul, which featured Brian Eno as one of seven producers. Though female performers were achieving popular breakthroughs elsewhere in West Africa, especially Mali, Senegalese women had few opportunities before the 1990s. The first international release by a woman was \\"Cheikh Anta Mbacke\\" (1989) by Kin√© Lam. The song's success led to a string of female performers, including Fatou Guewel, Madiodio Gning, Daro Mbaye and Khar Mbaye Madiaga. Lam, however, remained perhaps the most influential female musician of the 1990s, creating a modernized version of sabar ak xalam ensembles by adding bass guitar and synthesizer with 1993's Sunu Thiossane. The release of Fatou Guewel's CD entitled 'Fatou' in 1998 was significantly influential for Mbalax; this is also the case with her band 'Groupe Sope Noreyni'. The new century has seen the rise of Viviane Ndour, who got her first break as a backing vocalist to Youssou Ndour with Super Etoile. She is well known in Senegal and the diaspora, collaborating with French rap star Mokobe and Zouk artist Philip Montiero and incorporating RnB, Hip-Hop and other elements into her own style of Mbalax. Acoustic folk music has also left its mark on Senegal's music culture.

Funan√°, Coladeira, Batuque and Cabo love are other musical forms. History Cape Verde is an island archipelago that was uninhabited until the Portuguese arrived in 1462. The sailors brought with them African slaves, and the islands' population became mixed with elements of both races. Climate conditions made the islands inhospitable, and the Portuguese governments mostly ignored the inhabitants and the frequent droughts and famines that wracked the islands periodically. As a result, there are now more Cape Verdeans abroad than at home, and sizable communities exist in New England, Portugal, Wales, Senegal, Italy, France and the Netherlands. In 2011, it would be one of the most recent countries to have its own music award, the Cabo Verde Music Awards was established and awards the greatest songs of the year by Cape Vedean artists (and those of abroad). At the continental level, singers or artists from Cape Verde and Capeverdeans abroad are included on another award, the MTV Africa Music Awards at the continental level awarded each year by the music network MTV. From 2001-2011, Cape Verdeans and Capeverdeans abroad were awarded the KORA Awards, and only two singers were ever awarded including Ces√°ria √âvora and Suzanna Lubrano. Folk music =Morna= Morna is by far the most popular genre of Cape Verdean music, and it has produced an international superstar in Ces√°ria √âvora. Morna is a national song-style, like Argentinian tango, beloved by Cape Verdeans across the many islands of the country. Lyrics are usually in Creole, and reflect highly-variable themes, including love and lust, patriotism and mourning. Morna is believed to have originated on Boa Vista as a cheerful song-type. Eug√©nio Tavares was an influential songwriter of the period, and his songs are still extensively performed. Morna also spread to S√£o Vicente, and composers like B. Leza and Manuel de Novas became popular. Solo vocalists are accompanied by a guitar, violin, bass guitar) and a piano. The cavaquinho (similar to a ukulele]. In the 1930s, Morna evolved in a swifter form of music called coladeira. It is a more light-hearted and humorous genre, with sensual rhythms. Performers include Cod√© di Dona, Manuel de Novas, Frank Cavaquim, Djosa Marques and Os Tubar√µes. Aside from √âvora, popular morna musicians include Ildo Lobo, Titina, Celina Pereira, Bana, Djosinha, B. Leza, Travadinha, S√£ozinha, Maria Alice, Carmen Souza and Gard√©nia Benros. =Funan√°= Funan√° is an accordion-based genre from Santiago. Prior to independence, funan√° was denigrated by colonial authorities, who considered it African. Since independence, however, bands like Bulimundo adapted the music for pop audiences and Fina√ßon, who combined funan√° and coladeira into a fusion called funacola. Other group includes Paris-based La MC Malcriado =Batuque= Batuque is also popular in Cape Verde. Originally a woman's folk music, batuque is an improvised music with strong satirical or critical lyrics.

It is mainly sung during religious festivals in the islands of Santo Ant√£o, S√£o Vicente, S√£o Nicolau, Boa Vista and Brava. Popular music =Cola-zouk= In the 1980s, the cape verdean diaspora living in Europe and North America have influenced the traditional \\"Coladeira\\" with Compas / Kompa to create a version of Zouk called Cola-zouk, a similar Compas (Kompa) fusion to the French Antillean's Zouk\\" or \\"Zouk Love\\". Later, the new generation who grew up in Cape Verde featured a slow mixed version of electric pop music with Cape Verdean music styles, a light Compas called \\"Cabo Love\\" or \\"Cabo Zouk\\". The Cape Verdean Zouks are typically sung in Cape Verdean creole, it is often mistaken for the Angolan kizomba. This light Compas has become popular in Portuguese speaking countries of Africa, Brazil, and the rest of the world. Most of the songs are written in Portuguese/creole.

Palm wine music is representative, played by an acoustic guitar with percussion in countries throughout coastal West Africa. Sierra Leone, like much of West Africa is open to Rap, Reggae, Dancehall, R&B;, and Grime (music). Sierra Leone National music The national anthem of Sierra Leone, \\"High We Exalt Thee, Realm of the Free\\", was composed by John Akar with lyrics by Clifford Nelson Fyle and arrangement by Logie E. K. Wright. It was adopted upon independence in 1961. Traditional music The largest ethnic group in Sierra Leone (2009) is that of the Mel- speaking Temne people, 35% of the population. Next, at 31%, the Mande, along with 2% Mandingo, have music traditions related to Mande populations in neighbouring countries. Other recorded populations were the Limba ( 8%), the Kono (5%), the Loko (2%) and the Sierra Leone Creole people (2%), while 15% were recorded as \\"others\\". The wars and civil conflict throughout West Africa, have resulted in a decrease in the presence of traditional music artists. Popular music =Palm-wine= Sierra Leonean palm wine music is known as maringa, and it was first popularized by Ebenezer Calendar & His Maringar Band, who used Caribbean styles, especially Trinidadian calypso. Calendar played the guitar, trumpet, mandolin and the cornet, while also penning some of the most oft-played songs in Sierra Leonean music in the 1950s and 60s. His most popular song was \\"Double-Decker Bus\\", commissioned by Decca to promote the launching of a double-decker bus line. He eventually moved towards socially and spiritually aware lyrics. =Gumbe= Gumbe (also goombay or gumbay), is a Creole musical genre and has also had a long presence in Sierra Leone. The gumbe, a square drum with legs, was an important cultural symbol for the Jamaican maroon settlers who were to become part of the Sierra Leone Creole ethnic community. The drum had always been associated with the invocation of their ancestors (Bilby 2007:15), and played an important role in their Maroon strongholds in Jamaica in the 18th century, in their fight for freedom against the British. It was used for the communication of messages and also to warn them of future attacks being planned by the British. The sound of these drums provoked a trance from which these premonitions were made (Lewin 2000:160). The gumbe is still used today by the descendants of the maroons in Jamaica and Sierra Leone. Currently the gumbe enjoys a continuing presence in Krio culture in Sierra Leone. This drum is also still used in Freetown to enter into a trance and predict the future in events such as baptisms and weddings (Aranzadi 2010). Gumbe has also been influential on three of Sierra Leones‚Äôs 20th century popular dance-music styles: namely Asiko or Ashiko, Maringa and Milo jazz (Collins: 2007:180). Dr. Oloh was the most widely acknowledged innovator of Sierra Leone gumbe and milo jazz music =Afropop= Beginning in the 1970s, rumba, Congolese music, funk and soul combined to form a popular kind of Afropop. Major bands of this era included Sabannoh 75, Orchestra Muyei, Super Combo and the Afro-National. Sierra Leoneans abroad have created their own styles, such as Seydu, Ansoumana Bangura, Abdul Tee- Jay, Bosca Banks, Daddy Rahmanu, Patricia Bakarr and Sidike Diabate and Mwana Musa's African Connexion. =Modern= The internet has encouraged the youth to new styles of music. Many songs have political and social themes, informing the populace and checking politicians. The independent film, Sweet Salone, displays many of these artists, fans, and their music. Mwana Musa (Musa Kalamulah) and the band African Connexion married Sierra Leone, Congolese and jazz rhythms. Mwana Musa was an able composer who worked with musicians such as David Toop, Steve Beresford, Ray Carless, Ugo Delmirani, Robin Jones, Mongoley (Lipua Lipua) Safroman (GO Malebo)Len Jones one of Sierra Leones finest guitarists, Lindel Lewis, Ayo-Roy MAcauley leading guitarist from Sierra Leone, Kevin Robinson, Paapa Jay-Mensah etc. African Connexion was signed to Charlie Gillet's Oval Records and produced \\"C'est La Danse\\", \\"Moziki\\", \\"City Limits\\", \\"Midnight Pressure\\", \\"Dancing On The Sidewalk\\", a soca-tinged soukous, and \\"E Sidom Panam\\" - typical Sierra Leone dance music.

Powell's headquarters, dubbed Powell's City of Books, claims to be the largest independent new and used bookstore in the world. Powell's City of Books is located in the Pearl District on the edge of downtown and occupies a full city block between NW 10th and 11th Avenues and between W. Burnside and NW Couch Streets. It contains over , about 1.6 acres of retail floor space. CNN rates it one of the \\"coolest\\" bookstores in the world. The City of Books has nine color-coded rooms and over 3,500 different sections. The inventory for its retail and online sales is over four million new, used, rare, and out-of-print books. Powell's buys around 3,000 used books a day. History =20th century= Powell's was founded by Walter Powell in 1971. His son, Michael Powell, had started a bookstore in Chicago, Illinois, in 1970 which specialized in used, rare, and discounted books, primarily of an academic and scholarly nature. In 1979, Michael Powell joined his father in Portland, right after his father's store was not offered a lease renewal; within a year, they found the location that became its current headquarters. Michael bought the bookstore from his father in 1982. In 1984,\\"Loehmann's Plaza gains 85 percent occupancy\\". (November 25, 1984). The Sunday Oregonian, p. D11.

D8. near Washington Square. The new branch was not a replica of its City of Books location; Powell was concerned that the \\"edgy\\" neighborhood of its headquarters location was limiting its customer base, so the new store was \\"fairly fancy\\" with white shelving, a tile floor, and banners over the aisles. It was also four times the size of the typical chain bookstore. A travel bookstore was established in 1985 on Pioneer Courthouse Square, and other stores followed, one a year for the next few years. By the early 1990s, Powell's bookstores were part of the resurgence of the independent bookstore, which collectively made 32 percent of book sales in the U.S. The travel store closed in 2005.Nkrumah, Wade (February 7, 2005). \\"Food carts at Pioneer Square may be ousted\\".

The City of Books location grew to its current size after an expansion that opened in 1999; it included a new entrance facing the Pearl District which featured the \\"Pillar of Books\\", a Tenino sandstone carving depicting a stack of eight of the world's great books, on a base with the inscription \\"Buy the book, read the book, enjoy the book, sell the book\\" in Latin.

The expansion was due to add at least of new retail space. Plans submitted to the Portland Design Commission in November 2008 called for a rooftop garden atop the new addition and an \\"art cube\\" over a redesigned main entrance. Powell's Technical Books at its original North Park Blocks location (closed in 2010). In March 2010, Michael Powell confirmed plans to hand over management of the business to his daughter Emily as of July. That same month, Powell's announced it would close its technical bookstore on the North Park Blocks, moving its sections on math, science, computing, engineering, construction and transportation into \\"Powell‚Äôs Books Building 2\\" at the corner of 10th and Couch Street, near the main City of Books location; the consolidation was in response to a five-year decline in brick-and-mortar sales of technical books in favor of online sales. In October 2010, Powell's announced it had bought 7,000 books from the library of author Anne Rice; Powell's offers these association copies on their website. The bookstore was revealed as a charter member of the Google eBooks service when the news was announced by Google on December 6, 2010. In June 2011, Powell's participated in Google Offers during that service's first month of operation; according to TechCrunch--which characterized Powell's as a \\"Portland institution\\"--\\"5,000 Powell‚Äôs vouchers sold out in a matter of hours\\", making it \\"most popular deal in the month.\\" Starting in May 2012, Powell's began offering access to print on demand books via the Espresso Book Machine. In early 2013, Emily Powell announced that Miriam Sontz, the company's chief operating officer, would take over as chief executive officer. In late 2014 \\"Powell‚Äôs Books Building 2\\" was closed and the technical books at that location were moved into the main City of Books location. CEO Miriam Sontz retired in January 2019. Emily Powell remains president and owner. Powell's temporarily closed all of its physical locations and laid off the vast majority of its staff in March 2020 as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic in the United States. After a large surge in online orders from customers, the store was able to rehire about 100 former employees to fulfill them while maintaining social distancing guidelines.https://web.archive.org/web/20200329201856/http://www.powells.com/featured/communitymessage ILUW Local 5 complained that only 49 union workers had been recalled, and that other recalled workers were managers doing jobs normally done by union- represented workers such as shelving and shipping. =Labor relations= In 1991, following some post-holiday lay-offs, some of Powell's employees formed an organizing committee, seeking to become part of the Oregon Public Employees Union (OPEU). They got more than 35% of the employees to sign union cards but chose not to file for a union certification election because less than 65% had signed, a threshold suggested by the OPEU.ILWU Local 5: A Brief History of Local 5: Powell‚Äôs Books, Inc. from the ILWU Local 5 website In response to issues identified by the organizing employees, Powell's updated and expanded its employee handbook in April 1992 with changes that addressed processes for problem solving and grievances, the probation and termination procedure, and other employee assistance, among other changes. In September 1998, email from Powell's managers announcing reductions in employee's wage increases prompted the creation of a new organizing committee of 26 employees. They chose the International Longshore and Warehouse Union (ILWU) because they could charter their own self-governing local union which would include about 350 employees serving in a variety of jobs in all stores and in the Internet, corporate, and shipping departments. By March 1999, they filed for a union certification election with the National Labor Relations Board. A month later, by a vote of 161‚Äì155, ILWU Local 5 became official. In September 1999, ILWU Local 5 met for the first time with Powell's management, to begin the contract bargaining process. After some early successes, 2000 saw a slowdown in the discussions, followed by rallies, filings of unfair labor practices, an unsuccessful decertification campaign, a one-day shutdown of the shipping department (accompanied by the slashing of a van's tire), and federal mediation. A three- year contract was finally announced in August 2000. In February 2011 Powell's announced the layoffs of 31 employees, over 7% of its unionized workforce, in ‚Äúresponse to the unprecedented, rapidly changing nature of the book industry\\". It was the first round of layoffs since the store's workers formed a union. A union representative said that Powell's had reduced its workforce by about 40 in the prior year through attrition, but felt that layoffs were still necessary because of a decline in sales of new books and a rise in health care costs. In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, Powell's announced the closing of its five locations and the termination of nearly all employees in mid-March 2020. The letter released by CEO Emily Powell on March 17, 2020, did not disclose the exact number of employees that were laid off. However, roughly 85% of the 400 members of the company's unionized workforce were terminated. More than 100 former staffers were then rehired to fulfill a large surge of online orders, but the union pointed out that only 49 were union-represented, and that the rest were managers who were now doing front-line work normally done by represented employees. = Politics = Powell's Books was a key opponent of Oregon's Measure 97, which would have raised corporate taxes to fund schools, healthcare and senior services. Michael Powell contributed $25,000 to the opposition campaign. Powell's Books was featured in television ads for the No campaign, and Emily Powell signed a statement opposing the measure in the voter's pamphlet.

Vieux Farka Tour√© (right) and Valery Assouan are two international known musicians from Mali. The photograph is from a concert in Oslo in 2016. The Music of Mali is, like that of most African nations, ethnically diverse, but one influence predominates; that of the ancient Mali Empire of the Mandinka (from c. 1230 to c. 1600). Mande people (Bambara, Maninke, Soninke) make up 50% of the country's population, other ethnic groups include the Fula (17%), Gur-speakers 12%, Songhai people (6%), Tuareg and Moors (10%) and another 5%, including Europeans. Mali is divided into eight regions; Gao, Kayes, Koulikoro, Mopti, S√©gou, Sikasso, Tombouctou and Bamako (the eighth region, Kidal, was created in 1991). Salif Keita, a noble-born Malian who became a singer, brought Mande- based Afro-pop to the world, adopting traditional garb and styles. He says he sings to express himself, however, and not as a traditional jeli or praise- singer. The kora players Sidiki Diabat√© and Toumani Diabat√© have also achieved some international prominence as have the late Songhai/Fula guitarist Ali Farka Tour√© and his successors Afel Bocoum and Vieux Farka Tour√©, the Tuareg band Tinariwen, the duo Amadou et Mariam and Oumou Sangare. Mory Kant√© saw major mainstream success with techno-influenced Mande music. While internationally Malian popular music has been known more for its male artists, domestically, since at least the 1980s, female singers such as Kandia Kouyat√© are ubiquitous on radio and television, in markets and on street-corner stalls. Fans follow them for the moralizing nature of their lyrics, the perception that they embody tradition and their role as fashion trend-setters. National music The national anthem of Mali is \\"Le Mali\\". After independence under President Modibo Keita orchestras were state-sponsored and the government created regional orchestras for all seven then regions. From 1962 the orchestras competed in the annual \\"Semaines Nationale de la Jeunesse\\" (\\"National Youth Weeks\\") held in Bamako. Keita was ousted by a coup d'√©tat in 1968 organized by General Moussa Traor√©. Most of Keita's support for the arts was cancelled, but the \\"Semaines Nationale de la Jeunesse\\" festival, renamed the \\"Biennale Artistique et Culturelle de la Jeunesse\\", was held every 2 years starting in 1970. Notable and influential bands from the period included the first electric dance band, Orchestre Nationale A, and the Ensemble Instrumental National du Mali, comprising 40 traditional musicians from around the country and still in operation today. Mali's second president, Moussa Traor√©, discouraged Cuban music in favor of Malian traditional music. The annual arts festivals were held biannually and were known as the Biennales. At the end of the 1980s public support for the Malian government declined and praise-singing's support for the status quo and its political leaders became unfashionable. The ethnomusicologist Ryan Skinner has done work on the relationship of music and politics in contemporary Mali. Traditional music The Malink√©, Soninke - Sarakole, Dyula and Bambara peoples form the core of Malian culture, but the region of the Mali Empire has been extended far to the north in present-day Mali, where Tuareg and Maure peoples continue a largely nomadic desert culture. In the east Songhay, Bozo and Dogon people predominate, while the Fula people, formerly nomadic cattle-herders, have settled in patches across the nation and are now as often village and city dwelling, as they are over much of West Africa. Historical interethnic relations were facilitated by the Niger River and the country's vast savannahs. The Bambara, Malink√©, Sarakole, Dogon and Songhay are traditionally farmers, the Fula, Maur, and Tuareg herders and the Bozo are fishers. In recent years, this linkage has shifted considerably, as ethnic groups seek diverse, nontraditional sources of income. =Praise-singers= Mali's literary tradition is largely oral, mediated by jalis reciting or singing histories and stories from memory.Milet & Manaud, p128.Velton, p28. Amadou Hamp√¢t√© B√¢, Mali's best-known historian, spent much of his life recording the oral traditions of his own Fula teachers as well as those of Bambara and other Mande neighbors. The jeliw (sing. jeli, fem. jelimusow, French griot) are a caste of professional musicians and orators, sponsored by noble patrons of the horon class and part of the same caste as craftsmen (nyamakala). They recount genealogical information and family events, laud the deeds of their patron's ancestors and praise their patrons themselves, as well as exhorting them to behave morally to ensure the honour of the family name. They also act as dispute mediators. Their position is highly respected and they are often trusted by their patrons with privileged information since the caste system does not allow them to rival nobles. The jeli class is endogamous, so certain surnames are held only by jeliw: these include Kouyat√©, Kamissoko, Sissokho, Soumano, Diabat√© and Kon√©. Their repertoire includes several ancient songs of which the oldest may be \\"Lambang\\", which praises music. Other songs praise ancient kings and heroes, especially Sunjata Keita (\\"Sunjata\\") and Tutu Jara (\\"Tut Jara\\"). Lyrics are composed of a scripted refrain (donkili) and an improvised section. Improvised lyrics praise ancestors, and are usually based around a surname. Each surname has an epithet used to glorify its ancient holders, and singers also praise recent and still-living family members. Proverbs are another major component of traditional songs. These are typically accompanied by a full dance band The common instruments of the Maninka jeli ensemble are; *kora (21-24 string lute-harp, classified by the manner of playing as well as the bridge structure) *balafon (slat xylophone with small gourd resonators) *n'goni (4-7 string lute) *dununba (large mallet drum hung from one shoulder and played with a curved stick, accompanied by a bell played with the opposite hand) *n'taman (hourglass-shaped talking drum or tension drum, large and small variants) *tabale (tall conga-shaped drum played with long, thin flexible sticks) =Mande music= The Mande people, including the Mandinka, Maninka and Bamana,Turino, pgs. 172 - 173; Bensignor, Fran√ßois, Guus de Klein, and Lucy Duran, \\"Hidden Treasure\\", \\"The Backyard Beats of Gumbe\\" and \\"West Africa's Musical Powerhouse\\" in the Rough Guide to World Music, pgs. 437 - 439, pgs. 499 - 504 and pgs. 539 - 562; Manuel, Popular Musics, pg. 95; World Music Central have produced a vibrant popular music scene alongside traditional folk music and that of professional performers called jeliw (sing. jeli, French griot) The Mande people all claim descent from the legendary warrior Sunjata Keita, who founded the Mande Empire. The language of the Mande is spoken with different dialects in Mali and in parts of surrounding Burkina Faso, Ivory Coast, Guinea-Bissau, Guinea, Senegal and The Gambia. Instruments The kora is by far the most popular traditional instrument. It is similar to both a harp and a lute and can have between 21 and 25 strings. There are two styles of playing the kora; the western style is found mostly in Senegal and The Gambia, and is more rhythmically complex than the eastern tradition, which is more vocally dominated and found throughout Mali and Guinea. Ngoni (lutes) and balafon (xylophones) are also common. Mande percussion instruments include the tama, djembe and dunun drums. Jeli Lamine Soumano states: \\"If you want to learn the bala go to Guinea or Mali. If you want to learn the kora go to Gambia or Mali. If you want to learn the n'goni you have only to go to Mali.\\" Each area has developed a speciality instrument while still recognizing that the roots of the related forms come from Mali. Djembe The traditional djembe ensemble is most commonly attributed to the Maninka and Maraka: it basically consists of one small dunun (or konkoni) and one djembe soloist. A djembe accompanist who carries a steady pattern throughout the piece has since been added, as have the jeli dununba (also referred to as the kassonke dunun, names derived from the style of playing, not the physical instruments), and the n'tamani (small talking drum). Many ethnic groups, including the Kassonke, the Djokarame, the Kakalo, the Bobo, the Djoula, the Susu, and others, have historical connections with the djembe. Most vocalists are female in everyday Mande culture, partially due to the fact that many traditional celebrations revolve around weddings and baptisms, mostly attended by women. Several male and female singers are world-renowned. Although it once was rare for women to play certain instruments, in the 21st century women have broadened their range. Bamana Bamana-speaking peoples live in central Mali: the language is the most common in Mali. Music is simple and unadorned, and pentatonic. Traditional Bamana music is based on fileh (half calabash hand drum), gita (calabash bowl with seeds or cowrie shells attached to sound when rotated),the karignyen (metal scraper), the bonkolo drum (played with one open hand and a thin bamboo stick), the kunanfa (large bowl drum with cowhide head, played with the open hands, also barra or chun), the gangan (small, mallet-struck dunun, essentially the same as the konkoni or kenkeni played in the djembe ensemble). The melodic instruments of the Bamana are typically built around a pentatonic structure. The slat idiophone bala, the 6-string doson n'goni (hunter's lute-harp) and its popular version the 6-12 string kamel n'goni, the soku (gourd/lizard skin/horse hair violin adopted from the Songhai, soku literally means \\"horse tail\\"), and the modern guitar are all instruments commonly found in the Bamana repertoire. Bamana culture is centered around Segou, Sikasso, the Wassalou region and eastern Senegal near the border of Mali's Kayes region. Well-known Bamana performers include Mali's first female musical celebrity, Fanta Damba. Damba and other Bamana (and Maninka) musicians in cities like Bamako are known throughout the country for a style of guitar music called Bajourou (named after an 18th-century song glorifying ancient king Tutu Jara). Bamana djembe (\\"djembe\\" is a French approximation of the Maninka word, with correct English phonetic approximation: jenbe) drumming has become popular since the mid-1990s throughout the world. It is a traditional instrument of the Bamana people from Mali (This is incorrect, the instrument is a Maninka/Maraka instrument adopted by the Bamana). Mandinka The Mandinka live in Mali, The Gambia and Senegal and their music is influenced by their neighbors, especially the Wolof and Jola, two of the largest ethnic groups in the Senegambian region. The kora is the most popular instrument. Maninka Maninka music is the most complex of the three Mande cultures. It is highly ornamented and heptatonic, dominated by female vocalists and dance-oriented rhythms. The ngoni lute is the most popular traditional instrument. Most of the best-known Maninka musicians are from eastern Guinea and play a type of guitar music that adapts balafon-playing (traditional xylophone) to the imported instrument. Maninka music traces its legend back more than eight centuries to the time of Mansa Sunjata. In the time of Mali Empire and his semi-mythic rivalry with the great sorcerer-ruler Soumaoro Kante Mansa of the Susu people, Sunjata sent his jeli Diakouma Doua to learn the secrets of his rival. He finds a magical balafon, the \\"Soso Bala\\", the source of Soumaoro's power. When Soumaoro heard Diakouma Doua play on the bala he named him Bala Fasseke Kwate (Master of the bala). The Soso Bala still rests with the descendants of the Kouyate lineage in Niaggasola, Guinea, just across the modern border from Mali. Tuareg music Tinariwen is thought to be the first Tuareg electric band, active since 1982. They played at the Eden project stage of the Live8 concert in July 2005. Fula music The Fula use drums, the hoddu (same as the xalam, a plucked skin-covered lute similar to the banjo) and the riti or riiti (a one-string bowed instrument, in addition to vocal music. \\"Zaghareet\\" or ululation is a popular form of vocal music formed by rapidly moving the tongue sideways and making a sharp, high sound. The Mansa Sunjata forced some Fulani to settle in various regions where the dominant ethnic groups were Maninka or Bamana. Thus, today, we see a number of people with Fula names (Diallo, Diakite, Sangare, Sidibe) who display Fula cultural characteristics, but only speak the language of the Maninka or Bamana. Songhay music The Songhay are not an ethnic or a linguistic group but one that traces its history to the Songhai Empire and inhabits the great bend of the mid River Niger. Vieux Farka Toure, son of Ali Farka Toure, has gained popularity after playing in front of an estimated 1 billion viewers worldwide at the 2010 FIFA World Cup in South Africa. He has also been called, \\"the Hendrix of the Sahara\\", since his music explores the affinity between West African song and Afro-American blues guitar. 20th century popular music A Bwa xylophone. After World War 2 the guitar became common throughout Africa, partially resulting from the mixing of African, American and British soldiers. Dance bands were popular in Mali, especially the town of Kita's orchestra led by Boureima Keita and Afro-Jazz de S√©gou, the Rail Band and Pioneer Jazz. Imported dances were popular, especially rumbas, waltzes and Argentine-derived tangos. By the 1960s, however, the influence of Cuban music began to rise. After independence in 1960, Malians saw new opportunities for cultural expression in radio, television and recordings. Cuban music remained popular in Mali throughout the 1960s and remains popular today. Old dance bands reformed under new names as part of the roots revival of Moussa Traor√©. Especially influential bands included Tidiane Kon√©'s Rail Band du Buffet H√¥tel de la Gare, which launched the careers of future stars Salif Keita and Mory Kant√©, and Super Biton de S√©gou. Bajourou also became popular, beginning with Fanta Sacko's Fanta Sacko, the first bajourou LP. Fanta Sacko's success set the stage for future jelimusow stars which have been consistently popular in Mali; the mainstream acceptance of female singers is unusual in West Africa, and marks Malian music as unique. In 1975, Fanta Damba became the first jelimuso to tour Europe, as bajourou continued to become mainstream throughout Mali. Not all bands took part in Traor√©'s roots revival. Les Ambassadeurs du Motel formed in 1971, playing popular songs imported from Senegal, Cuba and France. Les Ambassadeurs and Rail Band were the two biggest bands in the country, and a fierce rivalry developed. Salif Keita, perhaps the most popular singer of the time, defected to Les Ambassadeurs in 1972. This was followed by a major concert at which both bands performed as part of the Kibaru (literacy) program. The audience fell into a frenzy of excitement and unity, and the concert is still remembered as one of the defining moments in 1970s Malian music. The mid-70s also saw the formation of National Badema, a band that played Cuban music and soon added Kasse Mady Diabat√© who led a movement to incorporate Maninka praise-singing into Cuban-style music. =Exodus= Both the Rail Band and Les Ambassadeurs left for Abidjan at the end of the 1970s due to a poor economic climate in Mali. There, Les Ambassadeurs recorded Mandjou, an album which featured their most popular song, \\"Mandjou\\". The song helped make Salif Keita a solo star. Many of the biggest musicians of the period also emigrated--to Abidjan, Dakar, Paris (Salif Keita, Mory Kant√©), London, New York or Chicago. Their recordings remained widely available, and these exiles helped bring international attention to Mande music. =1980s= Les Ambassadeurs and Rail Band continued recording and performing under a variety of names. In 1982 Salif Keita, who had recorded with Les Ambassadeurs' Kant√© Manfila, left the band and recorded an influential fusion album, Soro, with Ibrahima Sylla and French keyboardist Jean-Philippe Rykiel. The album revolutionized Malian pop, eliminating all Cuban traces and incorporating influences from rock and pop. By the middle of the decade, Paris had become the new capital of Mande dance music. Mory Kant√© saw major mainstream success with techno-influenced Mande music, becoming a #1 hit on several European charts. Another roots revival began in the mid-1980s. Guinean singer and kora player Jali Musa Jawara's 1983 Yasimika is said to have begun this trend, followed by a series of acoustic releases from Kant√© Manfila and Kasse Mady. Ali Farka Tour√© also gained international popularity during this period; his music is less in the jeli tradition and resembles American blues. =Wassoulou= The region of Wassoulou, south of Bamako, became the centre of a new wave of dance music also referred to as wassoulou. Wassoulou had been developing since at least the mid-70s. Jeliw had never played a large part in the music scene there, and music was more democratic. The modern form of wassoulou is a combination of hunter's songs with sogoninkun, a type of elaborate masked dance, and the music is largely based on the kamalengoni harp invented in the late 1950s by Allata Brulaye Sidib√≠. Most singers are women. Oumou Sangar√© was the first major wassoulou star; she achieved fame suddenly in 1989 with the release of Moussoulou, both within Mali and internationally. Wasulu region of southwest Mali. The soku is a traditional Wassoulou single string fiddle, corresponding to the Songhai n'diaraka or njarka, that doubles the vocal melody. Since the 1990s, although the majority of Malian popular singers are still jelimusow, wassoulou's popularity has continued to grow. Wassoulou music is especially popular among youth. Although western audiences categorise wassoulou performers like Oumou Sangar√© as feminists for criticizing practices like polygamy and arranged marriage, within Mali they are not viewed in that light because their messages, when they do not support the status quo of gender roles, are subtly expressed and ambiguously worded, thus keeping them open to a variety of interpretations and avoiding direct censure from Malian society.

He also held the titles of Margrave of Moravia from 1247, Duke of Austria from 1251, Duke of Styria from 1260, as well as Duke of Carinthia and landgrave of Carniola from 1269. With Ottokar's rule, the P≈ôemyslids reached the peak of their power in the Holy Roman Empire. His expectations of the imperial crown, however, were never fulfilled. Biography Ottokar was the second son of King Wenceslaus I of Bohemia (reigned 1230-1253). Through his mother, Kunigunde, daughter of Philip of Swabia, he was related to the Holy Roman Emperors of the Hohenstaufen dynasty, which became extinct in the male line upon the execution of King Conradin of Sicily in 1268. Named after his grandfather King P≈ôemysl Ottokar I, he was originally educated for the role of an ecclesiastical administrator, while his elder brother Vladislaus was designated heir of the Bohemian kingdom. He was possibly educated by the Bohemian chancellor Philip of Spanheim, who would later become a rival for the rule of the Duchy of Carinthia. =Rise to power= When his brother Vladislaus died in 1247, Ottokar suddenly became the heir to the Bohemian throne. According to popular oral tradition, he was profoundly shocked by his brother's death and did not involve himself in politics, becoming focused on hunting and drinking. His father appointed the new heir as Margrave of Moravia, and Ottokar took up residence in Brno, where he was occupied with the reconstruction of the Moravian lands devastated by Mongol raids of 1242. In 1248 some discontented nobles enticed him into leading a rebellion against his father King Wenceslaus. During this rebellion he was elected \\"the younger King\\" (mlad≈°√≠ kr√°l) on 31 July 1248 and temporarily expelled his father from Prague Castle. P≈ôemysl Ottokar II held the title of King of Bohemia until November 1249. However, Pope Innocent IV excommunicated Ottokar, whereafter Wenceslaus finally managed to defeat the rebels and imprisoned his son at P≈ôimda Castle.Encyclop√¶dia Britannica Eleventh Edition Father and son eventually reconciled to assist the king's aim of acquiring the neighbouring Duchy of Austria, where the last Babenberg duke, Frederick II had been killed in the 1246 Battle of the Leitha River. King Wenceslaus had initially attempted to acquire Austria by marrying his heir, Vladislaus, to the last duke's niece Gertrude of Babenberg. That marriage came to an end after half a year with Vladislaus's death in January 1247, and in 1248 Gertrude married the Z√§hringen margrave Herman VI of Baden. Herman, rejected by the Austrian nobility, could not establish his rule. Wenceslaus used this as pretext to invade Austria when Herman died in 1250 ‚Äî according to some sources, the estates called upon him to restore order. Wenceslaus released P≈ôemysl Ottokar very soon and in 1251 again made him Margrave of Moravia and installed him, with the approval of the Austrian nobles, as governor of Austria. The same year Ottokar entered Austria, where the estates acclaimed him as Duke. To legitimize his position, P≈ôemysl Ottokar married the late Duke Frederick II's sister Margaret of Babenberg, who was his senior by 30 years and the widow of the Hohenstaufen king Henry (VII) of Germany. Their marriage took place on 11 February 1252 at Hainburg. In 1253 King Wenceslaus died and P≈ôemysl Ottokar succeeded his father as King of Bohemia. After the death of the German King Konrad IV in 1254 while his son Conradin was still a minor, Ottokar also hoped to obtain the Imperial dignity - as King of the Romans - for himself. However, his election bid was unsuccessful and Count William II of Holland, the German anti-king since 1247, was generally recognised. =Building an empire= At the peak of his power, Ottokar II's realm stretched from the Sudetes to the Adriatic Sea. Feeling threatened by Ottokar's growing regional power beyond the Leitha River, his cousin King B√©la IV of Hungary challenged the young king. B√©la formed a loose alliance with the Wittelsbach duke Otto II of Bavaria and tried to install his own son Stephen as Duke of Styria, which since 1192 had been ruled in personal union with Austria under the terms of the Georgenberg Pact of 1186. Papal mediation settled the conflict : the parties agreed that Ottokar would yield large parts of Styria to B√©la in exchange for recognition of his right to the remainder of Austria. Subsequently King Ottokar II led the two crusade expeditions against the pagan Old Prussians (1254-1255 and 1268).K√∂nigsberg (now Kaliningrad, Russia), founded in 1255 by the Teutonic Order, was named in his honour and later became the capital of the Duchy of Prussia. K√∂nigsberg (now Kaliningrad, Russia), founded in 1255 by the Teutonic Order, was named in his honour and later became the capital of the Duchy of Prussia. After a few years of peace the conflict with Hungary resumed: Ottokar defeated the Hungarians in July 1260 at the Battle of Kressenbrunn, ending years of disputes over Styria with B√©la IV. B√©la now ceded Styria back to Ottokar, and his claim to those territories was formally recognized by Richard of Cornwall, then king of Germany and nominal ruler of all the German lands. This peace agreement was also sealed by a royal marriage. Ottokar ended his marriage to Margaret and married B√©la's young granddaughter Kunigunda of Halych, who became the mother of his children. The youngest of them became his only legitimate son, Wenceslaus II. During the Imperial Imperial interregnum of 1250 to 1273, Ottokar could increase his personal influence while Richard of Cornwall and Alfonso of Castile jostled to attain the Imperial dignity. In 1266 he occupied the Egerland in north-west Bohemia, and in 1268 he signed an inheritance treaty with the Sponheim duke Ulrich III of Carinthia, succeeding him in Carinthia, Carniola and the Windic March the next year. In 1272 he also acquired Friuli. His rule was once again contested by the Hungarians on the field of battle. After another victory, Ottokar became the most powerful king within the Empire. =The path to the final battle= After Richard of Cornwall died in April 1272 and Pope Gregory X rejected the claims raised by Alfonso of Castile, a new election for the Imperial German throne took place in 1273. However, the Bohemian king again failed to win the Imperial crown, as the electors voted for the \\"little count\\" Rudolf of Habsburg, Ottokar's last and finally victorious rival. P≈ôemysl Ottokar refused to acknowledge Rudolf's election, and urged the Pope to adopt a similar policy. At a convention of the Imperial Diet at Nuremberg in 1274, Rudolf decreed that all Imperial lands that had changed hands since the death of the last Hohenstaufen emperor Frederick II must be returned to the crown. This would have deprived Ottokar not only of the Egerland, but also of the Austrian, Styrian, and Carinthian duchies. In 1275 Rudolf placed Ottokar under the Imperial ban and besieged his Hofburg residence in Vienna, while a rebellion led by the V√≠tkovci noble Zavis of Falkenstein disrupted the Bohemian lands. This compelled P≈ôemysl Ottokar in November 1276 to sign a new treaty by which he gave up all claims to Austria and the neighboring duchies, retaining for himself only Bohemia and Moravia. Ottokar's son Wenceslaus became betrothed to Rudolf's daughter Judith. There followed an uneasy peace. Two years later, the Bohemian king made a last attempt to recover his lost lands by force. P≈ôemysl Ottokar again found allies in Bavaria, Brandenburg and Poland. He collected a large army to meet the forces of Rudolf and his ally King Ladislaus IV of Hungary in the Battle on the Marchfeld on 26 August 1278, where he was defeated and killed. Rudolf had his body laid out in state at the Minorites Church in Vienna. (In 1297 Ottokar's mortal remains were finally transferred to St. Vitus Cathedral in Prague.) His 6-year-old son Wenceslaus II succeeded him as King of Bohemia. Marriage and children On 11 February 1252, P≈ôemysl Ottokar II married Margaret of Austria. Margaret was 26 years older than him and the couple's childless marriage ended with an annulment. On 25 October 1261, Ottokar married Kunigunda of Slavonia. They probably had four children: *Henry (1262‚Äì1263) *Kunigunde (January 1265 ‚Äì 27 November 1321), married Boleslaus II of Masovia *Agnes (5 September 1269 ‚Äì 17 May 1296), married Rudolf II, Duke of Austria *Wenceslaus II (17 September 1271 ‚Äì 21 June 1305) Ottokar also had two extramarital sons and daughters. The most important was his firstborn, Nicholas. He was never accepted as heir apparent to the Bohemian crown by the sitting pope, but was given the Duchy of Opava as fief in 1269. Other illegitimate children include John, provost of Vy≈°ehrad Chapter. Legacy In the painting, P≈ôemysl Otakar II: The Union of Slavic Dynasties (1924), part of Alphonse Mucha's 20-canvas work The Slav Epic, Ottokar is depicted at his niece's wedding celebration, forging alliances with other Slavic rulers in attendance. P≈ôemysl Ottokar is considered one of the greatest kings of Bohemia, along with Charles IV. He was a founder of many new towns (about 30 ‚Äî not only in Bohemia, Moravia and Silesia, but also in Austria and Styria) and incorporated many existing settlements through civic charters, giving them new privileges. He was a strong proponent of trade, law and order. Furthermore, he instituted open immigration policies through which skilled German-speaking immigrants settled in major cities throughout his domains. As noted, the historic East Prussian city of K√∂nigsberg (King's Mountain) was named in his honor as a tribute to his support of the Teutonic Knights in their war with the pagan Old Prussians. As Czech traditional law was different from that of his other domains, many principles introduced during his reign formed core of the Czech law for the following centuries. From his time stems the oldest preserved source of Czech law, Zemsk√© desky, and also the oldest written Czech communal law, recorded in the founding deeds of the respective towns. By supporting the city of Jihlava (German: Iglau) with its mines, he laid foundation of the silver wealth of later Bohemian kings. Privileges of civic charters usually excluded the towns from obedience to the traditional courts held by members of nobility. This can be seen as a step towards equality and a precursor of modern civil law. In the country, Ottokar's introduction of the Law of Emphyteusis into the Czech law is sometimes interpreted as \\"Germanization\\". In fact it was creative, for it freed subjects from feudal obligations, except for rent ‚Äî and tax, if such was levied. Free selling and leaving of estates could also be bought and soon became common. Thus, Ottokar can be reckoned an early Bohemian ruler who furthered Bohemian rights in medieval times. This change of legal environment in Bohemia was introduced by systematic founding of villages chartered under this law. He issued also a general privilege to the Jews (1254), which established principles of integration of the Jews into the Czech society until 1848. The Jews were now eligible for various positions, such as servants of crown, thereby being somewhat less subject to discrimination. Instead of being able to claim only the support of individual lords, the Jews could from then on claim support of any royal officer. Ottokar followed with a systematic policy of strengthening his domains by building fortifications. Besides supporting towns, he built many fortresses himself ‚Äî Zv√≠kov Castle, K≈ôivokl√°t Castle or Bezdƒõz Castle in Bohemia, and the famed Hofburg Palace in Vienna ‚Äî and also induced his vassals to build castles. A sign of rising strength of Bohemia, it was also a reaction to the Mongol raids of the 13th century (see B√©la IV of Hungary). Conflict for the title of ownership to these fortified places built by members of nobility was probably the source of an uprising in 1276, which cost Ottokar the Austrian lands, and two years later (in an attempt for reconquest) his life. Some of the fortresses built by Ottokar were for centuries the strongest in Bohemia. Ironically, Bezdƒõz Castle served as a prison for his son Wenceslaus II of Bohemia for short time after Ottokar's death. The castle housed Bohemian legal records Zemsk√© desky and many spiritual and temporal treasures during the destructive civil strife of the Hussite wars (1419‚Äì1434) in Bohemia. It was conquered in 1620, during the 30 Years' War, but by then it was long deserted, and in that state was defended by rebelling subjects against an Imperial army. Before his conflict with Rudolf of Habsburg, Ottokar exacted influence over a number of relatives, allies and vassals in Germany, such as the Margraviate of Brandenburg ‚Äî and spiritual principalities, including the Archbishopric of Salzburg and the Patriarchate of Aquileia. After the death of Konradin in 1268 he was an heir of the House of Hohenstaufen's claim to the imperial crown. However, he did not raise this claim, remaining content with informal influence in Germany. In 1267 he was appointed protector of the royal domains (of the Holy Roman Empire) east of the Rhine by the German king, Richard of Cornwall. He held this office till 1273. Ottokar is a significant figure in history and legend. In the Divine Comedy by Dante, Ottokar is seen outside the gates of Purgatory, in amiable companionship with his imperial rival Rudolf. He is also the protagonist of a tragedy by the 19th-century Austrian playwright Franz Grillparzer, titled K√∂nig Ottokars Gl√ºck und Ende. There is a statue dedicated to him.

It guarantees the existence of at least one infinite set, namely a set containing the natural numbers. It was first published by Ernst Zermelo as part of his set theory in 1908.Zermelo: Untersuchungen √ºber die Grundlagen der Mengenlehre, 1907, in: Mathematische Annalen 65 (1908), 261-281; Axiom des Unendlichen p. 266f.  Formal statement  In the formal language of the Zermelo‚ÄìFraenkel axioms, the axiom reads: :\\\\exists \\\\mathbf{I} \\\\, ( \\\\empty \\\\in \\\\mathbf{I} \\\\, \\\\land \\\\, \\\\forall x \\\\in \\\\mathbf{I} \\\\, ( \\\\, ( x \\\\cup \\\\\\\\{x\\\\\\\\} ) \\\\in \\\\mathbf{I} ) ) . In words, there is a set I (the set which is postulated to be infinite), such that the empty set is in I, and such that whenever any x is a member of I, the set formed by taking the union of x with its singleton {x} is also a member of I. Such a set is sometimes called an inductive set.  Interpretation and consequences  This axiom is closely related to the von Neumann construction of the natural numbers in set theory, in which the successor of x is defined as x ‚à™ {x}. If x is a set, then it follows from the other axioms of set theory that this successor is also a uniquely defined set. Successors are used to define the usual set-theoretic encoding of the natural numbers. In this encoding, zero is the empty set: :0 = {}. The number 1 is the successor of 0: :1 = 0 ‚à™ {0} = {} ‚à™ {0} = {0} = . Likewise, 2 is the successor of 1: :2 = 1 ‚à™ {1} = {0} ‚à™ {1} = {0,1} = { {}, }, and so on: :3 = {0,1,2} = { {}, , {{}, } }; :4 = {0,1,2,3} = { {}, , { {}, }, { {}, , {{}, } } }. A consequence of this definition is that every natural number is equal to the set of all preceding natural numbers. The count of elements in each set, at the top level, is the same as the represented natural number, and the nesting depth of the most deeply nested empty set {}, including its nesting in the set that represents the number of which it is a part, is also equal to the natural number that the set represents. This construction forms the natural numbers. However, the other axioms are insufficient to prove the existence of the set of all natural numbers, . Therefore, its existence is taken as an axiom ‚Äì the axiom of infinity. This axiom asserts that there is a set I that contains 0 and is closed under the operation of taking the successor; that is, for each element of I, the successor of that element is also in I. Thus the essence of the axiom is: :There is a set, I, that includes all the natural numbers. The axiom of infinity is also one of the von Neumann‚ÄìBernays‚ÄìG√∂del axioms.  Extracting the natural numbers from the infinite set  The infinite set I is a superset of the natural numbers. To show that the natural numbers themselves constitute a set, the axiom schema of specification can be applied to remove unwanted elements, leaving the set N of all natural numbers. This set is unique by the axiom of extensionality. To extract the natural numbers, we need a definition of which sets are natural numbers. The natural numbers can be defined in a way which does not assume any axioms except the axiom of extensionality and the axiom of induction--a natural number is either zero or a successor and each of its elements is either zero or a successor of another of its elements. In formal language, the definition says: :\\\\forall n (n \\\\in \\\\mathbf{N} \\\\iff ([n = \\\\empty \\\\,\\\\,\\\\lor\\\\,\\\\, \\\\exists k ( n = k \\\\cup \\\\\\\\{k\\\\\\\\} )] \\\\,\\\\,\\\\land\\\\,\\\\, \\\\forall m \\\\in n[m = \\\\empty \\\\,\\\\,\\\\lor\\\\,\\\\, \\\\exists k \\\\in n ( m = k \\\\cup \\\\\\\\{k\\\\\\\\} )])). Or, even more formally: :\\\\forall n (n \\\\in \\\\mathbf{N} \\\\iff ([\\\\forall k (\\\\lnot k \\\\in n) \\\\lor \\\\exists k \\\\forall j (j \\\\in n \\\\iff (j \\\\in k \\\\lor j = k))] \\\\land ::\\\\forall m (m \\\\in n \\\\Rightarrow [\\\\forall k (\\\\lnot k \\\\in m) \\\\lor \\\\exists k (k \\\\in n \\\\land \\\\forall j (j \\\\in m \\\\iff (j \\\\in k \\\\lor j = k)))]))). = Alternative method = An alternative method is the following. Let \\\\Phi(x) be the formula that says \\"x is inductive\\"; i.e. \\\\Phi(x) = (\\\\emptyset \\\\in x \\\\wedge \\\\forall y(y \\\\in x \\\\to (y \\\\cup \\\\\\\\{y\\\\\\\\} \\\\in x))). Informally, what we will do is take the intersection of all inductive sets. More formally, we wish to prove the existence of a unique set W such that :\\\\forall x(x \\\\in W \\\\leftrightarrow \\\\forall I(\\\\Phi(I) \\\\to x \\\\in I)). (*) For existence, we will use the Axiom of Infinity combined with the Axiom schema of specification. Let I be an inductive set guaranteed by the Axiom of Infinity. Then we use the Axiom Schema of Specification to define our set W = \\\\\\\\{x \\\\in I:\\\\forall J(\\\\Phi(J) \\\\to x \\\\in J)\\\\\\\\} \\\\- i.e. W is the set of all elements of I which happen also to be elements of every other inductive set. This clearly satisfies the hypothesis of (*), since if x \\\\in W, then x is in every inductive set, and if x is in every inductive set, it is in particular in I, so it must also be in W. For uniqueness, first note that any set which satisfies (*) is itself inductive, since 0 is in all inductive sets, and if an element x is in all inductive sets, then by the inductive property so is its successor. Thus if there were another set W' which satisfied (*) we would have that W' \\\\subseteq W since W is inductive, and W \\\\subseteq W' since W' is inductive. Thus W = W'. Let \\\\omega denote this unique element. This definition is convenient because the principle of induction immediately follows: If I \\\\subseteq \\\\omega is inductive, then also \\\\omega \\\\subseteq I, so that I = \\\\omega. Both these methods produce systems which satisfy the axioms of second- order arithmetic, since the axiom of power set allows us to quantify over the power set of \\\\omega, as in second-order logic. Thus they both completely determine isomorphic systems, and since they are isomorphic under the identity map, they must in fact be equal.  An apparently weaker version  Some old texts use an apparently weaker version of the axiom of infinity, to wit : \\\\exists x \\\\, ( \\\\exists y \\\\, ( y \\\\in x ) \\\\, \\\\land \\\\, \\\\forall y ( y \\\\in x \\\\, \\\\rightarrow \\\\, \\\\exists z ( z \\\\in x \\\\, \\\\land \\\\, y \\\\subseteq z \\\\, \\\\land \\\\, y eq z ) ) ) \\\\,. This says that there is an element in x and for every element y of x there is another element of x which is a strict superset of y. This implies that x is an infinite set without saying much about its structure. However, with the help of the other axioms of ZF, we can show that this implies the existence of œâ. First, if we take the powerset of any infinite set x, then that powerset will contain elements which are subsets of x of every finite cardinality (among other subsets of x). Proving the existence of those finite subsets may require either the axiom of separation or the axioms of pairing and union. Then we can apply the axiom of replacement to replace each element of that powerset of x by the initial ordinal number of the same cardinality (or zero, if there is no such ordinal). The result will be an infinite set of ordinals. Then we can apply the axiom of union to that to get an ordinal greater than or equal to œâ.  Independence  The axiom of infinity cannot be proved from the other axioms of ZFC if they are consistent. (To see why, note that ZFC \\\\vdash Con(ZFC ‚Äì Infinity) and use G√∂del's Second incompleteness theorem.) The negation of the axiom of infinity cannot be derived from the rest of the axioms of ZFC, if they are consistent. (This is tantamount to saying that ZFC is consistent, if the other axioms are consistent.) We believe this, but cannot prove it (if it is true). Indeed, using the von Neumann universe, we can build a model of ZFC ‚Äì Infinity + (¬¨Infinity). It is V_\\\\omega \\\\\\\\!, the class of hereditarily finite sets, with the inherited membership relation. Note that if the axiom of the empty set is not taken as a part of this system (since it can be derived from ZF + Infinity), then the empty domain also satisfies ZFC ‚Äì Infinity + ¬¨Infinity, as all of its axioms are universally quantified, and thus trivially satisfied if no set exists. The cardinality of the set of natural numbers, aleph null (\\\\aleph_0), has many of the properties of a large cardinal. Thus the axiom of infinity is sometimes regarded as the first large cardinal axiom, and conversely large cardinal axioms are sometimes called stronger axioms of infinity.

It is intended to produce a fortified food to be grown and consumed in areas with a shortage of dietary vitamin A, a deficiency which each year is estimated to kill 670,000 children under the age of 5Black RE et al., Maternal and child undernutrition: global and regional exposures and health consequences, The Lancet, 2008, 371(9608), p. 253. and cause an additional 500,000 cases of irreversible childhood blindness. Rice is a staple food crop for over half of the world's population, providing 30‚Äì72% of the energy intake for people in Asian countries, and becoming an effective crop for targeting vitamin deficiencies. Golden rice differs from its parental strain by the addition of three beta-carotene biosynthesis genes. The parental strain can naturally produce beta-carotene in its leaves, where it is involved in photosynthesis. However, the plant does not normally produce the pigment in the endosperm, where photosynthesis does not occur. Golden rice has met significant opposition from environmental and anti-globalization activists. A study in the Philippines is aimed to evaluate the performance of golden rice, whether it can be planted, grown and harvested like other rice varieties, and whether golden rice poses risk to human health.PhilRice Two seasons of Golden Rice trials in Phl concluded, 09 June 2013. There has been little research on how well the beta-carotene will hold up when stored for long periods between harvest seasons, or when cooked using traditional methods. In 2005, Golden Rice 2 was announced, which produces up to 23 times as much beta-carotene as the original golden rice. To receive the USDA's Recommended Dietary Allowance (RDA), it is estimated that 144 g/day of the high-yielding strain would have to be eaten. Bioavailability of the carotene from golden rice has been confirmed and found to be an effective source of vitamin A for humans.Norton, Amy (15 August 2012) Genetically modified rice a good vitamin A source Reuters, Retrieved 20 August 2012 Golden Rice was one of the seven winners of the 2015 Patents for Humanity Awards by the United States Patent and Trademark Office. In 2018 came the first approvals as food in Australia, New Zealand, Canada and the US. History The search for a golden rice started off as a Rockefeller Foundation initiative in 1982.FAQ: Who invented Golden Rice and how did the project start? Goldenrice.org. A simplified overview of the carotenoid biosynthesis pathway in golden rice. The enzymes expressed in the endosperm of golden rice, shown in red, catalyze the biosyntheis of beta- carotene from geranylgeranyl diphosphate. Beta-carotene is assumed to be converted to retinal and subsequently retinol (vitamin A) in the animal gut Peter Bramley discovered in the 1990s that a single phytoene desaturase gene (bacterial CrtI) can be used to produce lycopene from phytoene in GM tomato, rather than having to introduce multiple carotene desaturases that are normally used by higher plants. Lycopene is then cyclized to beta-carotene by the endogenous cyclase in golden rice. The scientific details of the rice were first published in Science in 2000, the product of an eight-year project by Ingo Potrykus of the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology and Peter Beyer of the University of Freiburg. At the time of publication, golden rice was considered a significant breakthrough in biotechnology, as the researchers had engineered an entire biosynthetic pathway. The first field trials of golden rice cultivars were conducted by Louisiana State University Agricultural Center in 2004. Additional trials have been conducted in the Philippines and Taiwan, and in Bangladesh (2015). Field testing provides an accurate measurement of nutritional value and enables feeding tests to be performed. Preliminary results from field tests have shown field-grown golden rice produces 4 to 5 times more beta-carotene than golden rice grown under greenhouse conditions. = Crossbreeding = In several countries, golden rice has been bred with local rice cultivars. or crossbred with the American rice cultivar 'Cocodrie'. As of March 2016, golden rice has not yet been grown commercially, and backcrossing is still ongoing in current varieties to reduce yield drag. = Golden Rice 2 = In 2005, a team of researchers at Syngenta produced Golden Rice 2. They combined the phytoene synthase gene from maize with crt1 from the original golden rice. Golden rice 2 produces 23 times more carotenoids than golden rice (up to 37 ¬µg/g), and preferentially accumulates beta-carotene (up to 31 ¬µg/g of the 37 ¬µg/g of carotenoids). = Approvals = In 2018, Canada and the United States approved golden rice for cultivation, with Health Canada and the US Food and Drug Administration declaring it safe for consumption. This followed a 2016 decision where the US Food and Drug Administration had ruled that the beta-carotene content in golden rice did not provide sufficient amounts of Vitamin A to make a nutritional claim. Health Canada declared that golden rice would not affect allergies, and that the nutrient contents of golden rice were the same as in common rice varieties, except for the intended high levels of provitamin A. In 2019, it was approved for direct use as human food and animal feed or for processing in the Philippines. This does not constitute approval for commercial propagation in the Philippines, which is a separate stage that remains to be completed.  Genetics  Golden rice was created by transforming rice with two beta- carotene biosynthesis genes: # psy (phytoene synthase) from daffodil ('Narcissus pseudonarcissus') # crtI (phytoene desaturase) from the soil bacterium Erwinia uredovora (The insertion of a lcy (lycopene cyclase) gene was thought to be needed, but further research showed it is already produced in wild-type rice endosperm.) The psy and crtI genes were transferred into the rice nuclear genome and placed under the control of an endosperm-specific promoter, so that they are only expressed in the endosperm. The exogenous lcy gene has a transit peptide sequence attached, so it is targeted to the plastid, where geranylgeranyl diphosphate is formed. The bacterial crtI gene was an important inclusion to complete the pathway, since it can catalyze multiple steps in the synthesis of carotenoids up to lycopene, while these steps require more than one enzyme in plants. The end product of the engineered pathway is lycopene, but if the plant accumulated lycopene, the rice would be red. Recent analysis has shown the plant's endogenous enzymes process the lycopene to beta-carotene in the endosperm, giving the rice the distinctive yellow color for which it is named. The original golden rice was called SGR1, and under greenhouse conditions it produced 1.6 ¬µg/g of carotenoids. Vitamin A deficiency Prevalence of vitamin A deficiency. Red is most severe (clinical), green least severe. Countries not reporting data are coded blue. Data collected for a 1995 report. The research that led to golden rice was conducted with the goal of helping children who suffer from vitamin A deficiency (VAD). In 2005, 190 million children and 19 million pregnant women, in 122 countries, were estimated to be affected by VAD.Staff (2009) Global Prevalence Of Vitamin A Deficiency in Populations At Risk 1995‚Äì2005 WHO Global Database on Vitamin A Deficiency. Geneva, World Health Organization, , Retrieved 10 October 2011 VAD is responsible for 1‚Äì2 million deaths, 500,000 cases of irreversible blindness and millions of cases of xerophthalmia annually. Children and pregnant women are at highest risk. Vitamin A is supplemented orally and by injection in areas where the diet is deficient in vitamin A. , 43 countries had vitamin A supplementation programs for children under 5; in 10 of these countries, two high dose supplements are available per year, which, according to UNICEF, could effectively eliminate VAD.UNICEF. Vitamin A deficiency However, UNICEF and a number of NGOs involved in supplementation note more frequent low-dose supplementation is preferable.Vitamin A Global Initiative. 1997. A Strategy for Acceleration of Progress in Combating Vitamin A Deficiency Because many children in VAD- affected countries rely on rice as a staple food, genetic modification to make rice produce the vitamin A precursor beta-carotene was seen as a simple and less expensive alternative to ongoing vitamin supplements or an increase in the consumption of green vegetables or animal products. Initial analyses of the potential nutritional benefits of golden rice suggested consumption of golden rice would not eliminate the problems of vitamin A deficiency, but could complement other supplementation. Golden Rice 2 contains sufficient provitamin A to provide the entire dietary requirement via daily consumption of some 75g per day. Since carotenes are hydrophobic, sufficient fat must be present in the diet for golden rice (or most other vitamin A supplements) to alleviate vitamin A deficiency. Vitamin A deficiency is usually coupled to an unbalanced diet (see also Vandana Shiva's arguments below). Moreover, this claim referred to an early cultivar of golden rice; one bowl of the latest version provides 60% of RDA for healthy children. The RDA levels advocated in developed countries are far in excess of the amounts needed to prevent blindness. Research =Clinical trials/food safety and nutrition research= In 2009, results of a clinical trial of golden rice with adult volunteers from the US were published in the American Journal of Clinical Nutrition. The trial concluded that \\"beta-carotene derived from golden rice is effectively converted to vitamin A in humans\\".Golden Rice is an effective source of vitamin A, by Guangwen Tang, Jian Qin, Gregory G Dolnikowski, Robert M Russell, and Michael A Grusak in the American Journal of Clinical Nutrition, 2009; 89:1776‚Äì83. A summary for the American Society for Nutrition suggested that \\"Golden Rice could probably supply 50% of the Recommended Dietary Allowance (RDA) of vitamin A from a very modest amount ‚Äì perhaps a cup ‚Äì of rice, if consumed daily. This amount is well within the consumption habits of most young children and their mothers\\".American Society of Nutrition: Researchers Determine That Golden Rice Is an Effective Source of Vitamin A It is well known that beta-carotene is found and consumed in many nutritious foods eaten around the world, including fruits and vegetables.

May 2, 2006.  Controversy  Critics of genetically engineered crops have raised various concerns. An early issue was that golden rice originally did not have sufficient provitamin A content. This problem was solved by the development of new strains of rice. The speed at which beta- carotene degrades once the rice is harvested, and how much remains after cooking are contested.Then, C, 2009, \\"The campaign for genetically modified rice is at the crossroads: A critical look at Golden Rice after nearly 10 years of development.\\" Foodwatch in Germany However, a 2009 study concluded that beta-carotene from golden rice is effectively converted into vitamin A in humans and a 2012 study that fed 68 children ages 6 to 8 concluded that golden rice was as good as vitamin A supplements and better than the natural beta- carotene in spinach. Greenpeace opposes the use of any patented genetically modified organisms in agriculture and opposes the cultivation of golden rice, claiming it will open the door to more widespread use of GMOs. Greenpeace. 2005. All that Glitters is not Gold: The False Hope of Golden Rice The International Rice Research Institute (IRRI) has emphasised the non- commercial nature of their project, stating that \\"None of the companies listed ... are involved in carrying out the research and development activities of IRRI or its partners in Golden Rice, and none of them will receive any royalty or payment from the marketing or selling of golden rice varieties developed by IRRI.\\"IRRI. 2014. FAQ: Are private companies involved in the Golden Rice project? Vandana Shiva, an Indian anti-GMO activist, argued the problem was not the plant per se, but potential problems with poverty and loss of biodiversity. Shiva claimed these problems could be amplified by the corporate control of agriculture. By focusing on a narrow problem (vitamin A deficiency), Shiva argued, golden rice proponents were obscuring the limited availability of diverse and nutritionally adequate food. Other groups argued that a varied diet containing foods rich in beta-carotene such as sweet potato, leaf vegetables and fruit would provide children with sufficient vitamin A.Friends of the Earth. Golden Rice and Vitamin A Deficiency Keith West of Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health has stated that foodstuffs containing vitamin A are often unavailable, only available at certain seasons, or too expensive for poor families in underdeveloped countries. In 2008, WHO malnutrition expert Francesco Branca cited the lack of real-world studies and uncertainty about how many people will use golden rice, concluding \\"giving out supplements, fortifying existing foods with vitamin A, and teaching people to grow carrots or certain leafy vegetables are, for now, more promising ways to fight the problem\\". In 2013, author Michael Pollan, who had critiqued the product in 2001, unimpressed by the benefits, expressed support for the continuation of the research. In 2012, controversy surrounded a study published in The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition. The study, involving feeding GM rice to 6 to 8 year old children in China, was later found to have violated human research rules of both Tufts University and the federal government. Subsequent reviews found no evidence of safety problems with the study, but found issues with insufficient consent forms, unapproved changes to study protocol, and lack of approval from a China-based ethics review board. Additionally, the GM rice used was brought into China illegally. = Support = The Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation supports the use of genetically modified organisms in agricultural development and supports the International Rice Research Institute in developing golden rice. In June 2016, 107 Nobel laureates signed a letter urging Greenpeace and its supporters to abandon their campaign against GMOs, and against golden rice in particular. In May 2018, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration approved the use of golden rice for human consumption, stating: \\"Based on the information IRRI has presented to FDA, we have no further questions concerning human or animal food derived from GR2E rice at this time.\\" This marks the fourth national health organisation to approve the use of golden rice in 2018, joining Australia, Canada and New Zealand who issued their assessments earlier in the year. = Protests = On August 8, 2013, an experimental plot of golden rice being developed at IRRI in the Philippines was uprooted by protesters. British author Mark Lynas reported in Slate that the vandalism was carried out by a group of activists led by the extreme left-inclined Kilusang Magbubukid ng Pilipinas (KMP) (unofficial translation: Farmers' Movement of the Philippines), to the dismay of other protesters.The True Story About Who Destroyed a Genetically Modified Rice Crop, Mark Lynas, Slate, Aug 26, 2013 No local farmers participated in the uprooting; only the small number of activists damaged the golden rice crops. Distribution A recommendation was made that golden rice to be distributed free to subsistence farmers. Free licenses for developing countries were granted quickly due to the positive publicity that golden rice received, particularly in Time magazine in July 2000. Monsanto Company was one of the companies to grant free licences for related patents owned by the company.. The cutoff between humanitarian and commercial use was set at US$10,000. Therefore, as long as a farmer or subsequent user of golden rice genetics would not make more than $10,000 per year, no royalties would need to be paid. In addition, farmers would be permitted to keep and replant seed.

In 1933, the Electric and Magnetic Magnitudes and Units committee of the International Electrotechnical Commission recommended to adopt the metre‚Äìkilogram‚Äìsecond (MKS) system (Giorgi system), and the name weber was proposed for the practical unit of magnetic flux (), subject to approval of various national committees, which was achieved in 1935. The weber was thus adopted as a practical unit of magnetic flux by the International Electrotechnical Commission. Definition The maxwell is a non-SI unit. :1 maxwell = 1 gauss √ó cm2 That is, one maxwell is the total flux across a surface of one square centimetre perpendicular to a magnetic field of strength one gauss.

It is referred to as the cynomolgus monkey in laboratories. It has a long history alongside humans; it has been alternately seen as an agricultural pest, sacred animal in some temples, and more recently, the subject of medical experiments. The crab- eating macaque lives in matrilineal social groups of up to eight individuals dominated by females. Male members leave the group when they reach puberty. It is an opportunistic omnivore and has been documented using tools to obtain food in Thailand and Myanmar. The crab-eating macaque is a known invasive species and a threat to biodiversity in several locations, including Hong Kong and western New Guinea. The significant overlap in macaque and human living space has resulted in greater habitat loss, synanthropic living, and inter- and intraspecies conflicts over resources. Etymology Macaca comes from the Portuguese word macaco, which was derived from makaku, an Ibinda (West African language) word (kaku means monkey in Ibinda). The specific epithet fascicularis is Latin for a small band or stripe. Sir Thomas Raffles, who gave the animal its scientific name in 1821, did not specify what he meant by the use of this word. In Indonesia and Malaysia, M. fascicularis and other macaque species are known generically as kera, possibly because of their high-pitched cries. The crab-eating macaque has several common names. It is often referred to as the long-tailed macaque due to its tail, which is often longer than its body. The name crab-eating macaque refers to its being often seen foraging beaches for crabs. Another common name for M. fascicularis is the cynomolgus monkey, from the name of a race of humans with long hair and handsome beards who used dogs for hunting according to Aristophanes of Byzantium, who seemingly derived the etymology of the word cynomolgus from the Greek Œ∫œçœâŒΩ, cyon 'dog' (gen. cyno-s) and the verb ·ºÄŒºŒ≠ŒªŒ≥ŒµŒπŒΩ, amelgein 'to milk' (adj. amolg-os), by claiming that they milked female dogs.Aristophanes of Byzantium, T·ø∂ŒΩ ·ºàœÅŒπœÉœÑŒøœÑŒ≠ŒªŒøœÖœÇ œÄŒµœÅŒØ Œ∂œéœâŒΩ ·ºêœÄŒπœÑŒøŒºŒÆ. ŒëŒ†ŒëŒùŒ§Œë Œô, 2.59. ŒöŒëŒöŒ§ŒüŒ£ 1998. This name is commonly used in laboratory settings. In Thailand, the species is called \\"‡∏•‡∏¥‡∏á‡πÅ‡∏™‡∏°\\" (Ling sÃÑ√¶m; literally 'mangrove monkeys') because it lives and forages in mangrove forests. Taxonomy The 10 subspecies of M. fascicularis are: * Common long-tailed macaque, M. f. fascicularis * Burmese long-tailed macaque, M. f. aurea * Nicobar long-tailed macaque, M. f. umbrosa * Dark- crowned long-tailed macaque, M. f. atriceps * Con Song long-tailed macaque, M. f. condorensis * Simeulue long-tailed macaque, M. f. fusca * Lasia long-tailed macaque, M. f. lasiae * Maratua long-tailed macaque, M. f. tua * Kemujan long- tailed macaque, M. f. karimondjawae * Philippine long-tailed macaque, M. f. philippensis Physical characteristics The body length of the adult, which varies among subspecies, is with relatively short arms and legs. Males are considerably larger than females, weighing compared to the of females. The tail is longer than the body, typically , which is used for balance when they jump distances up to . The upper parts of the body are dark brown with light golden brown tips. The under parts are light grey with a dark grey/brown tail. Crab-eating macaques have backwards-directed crown hairs which sometimes form short crests on the midline. Their skin is black on their feet and ears, whereas the skin on the muzzle is a light grayish pink color. The eyelids often have prominent white markings and sometimes there are white spots on the ears. Males have a characteristic mustache and cheek whiskers, while females have only cheek whiskers. Crab-eating macaques have a cheek pouch which they use to store food while foraging. Females show no perineal swelling. Behavior =Group living= Crab-eating macaque baring its teeth. Juvenile crab-eating macaque in Borneo. Juvenile crab-eating macaque in Ao Nang, Thailand. Macaques live in social groups that contain three to 20 females, their offspring, and one or many males. The groups usually have fewer males than females. In social groups of macaques, a clear dominance hierarchy is seen among females. These ranks remain stable throughout the female's lifetime and also can be sustained through generations of matrilines. Females have their highest birth rates around 10 years of age and completely stop bearing young by age 24. The social groups of macaques are female-bonded, meaning the males will disperse at the time of puberty. Thus, group relatedness on average appears to be lower than compared to matrilines. More difference in relatedness occurs when comparing high-ranking lineages to lower ranking lineages, with higher-ranking individuals being more closely related to one another. Additionally, groups of dispersing males born into the same social groups display a range of relatedness, at times appearing to be brothers, while at other times appearing to be unrelated. In addition to the matrilineal dominance hierarchy, male dominance rankings also exist. Alpha males have a higher frequency of mating compared to their lower-ranking conspecifics. The increased success is due partially to his increased access to females and also due to female preference of an alpha male during periods of maximum fertility. Though females have a preference for alpha males, they do display promiscuous behavior. Through this behavior, females risk helping to rear a nonalpha offspring, yet benefit in two specific ways, both in regard to aggressive behavior. First, a decreased value is placed on one single copulation. Moreover, the risk of infanticide is decreased due to the uncertainty of paternity. Increasing group size leads to increased competition and energy spent trying to forage for resources, and in particular, food. Further, social tensions build and the prevalence of tension-reducing interactions like social grooming fall with larger groups. Thus, group living appears to be maintained solely due to the safety against predation. =Conflict= Group living in all species is dependent on tolerance of other group members. In crab-eating macaques, successful social group living maintains postconflict resolution must occur. Usually, less dominant individuals lose to a higher-ranking individual when conflict arises. After the conflict has taken place, lower- ranking individuals tend to fear the winner of the conflict to a greater degree. In one study, this was seen by the ability to drink water together. Postconflict observations showed a staggered time between when the dominant individual begins to drink and the subordinate. Long-term studies reveal the gap in drinking time closes as the conflict moves further into the past. Grooming and support in conflict among primates is considered to be an act of reciprocal altruism. In crab-eating macaques, an experiment was performed in which individuals were given the opportunity to groom one another under three conditions: after being groomed by the other, after grooming the other, and without prior grooming. After a grooming took place, the individual that received the grooming was much more likely to support its groomer than one that had not previously groomed that individual. These results support the reciprocal altruism theory of grooming in long-tailed macaques. Crab-eating macaques demonstrate two of the three forms of suggested postconflict behavior. In both captive and wild studies, the monkeys demonstrated reconciliation, or an affiliative interaction between former opponents, and redirection, or acting aggressively towards a third individual. Consolation was not seen in any study performed. Postconflict anxiety has been reported in crab-eating macaques that have acted as the aggressor. After a conflict within a group, the aggressor appears to scratch itself at a higher rate than before the conflict. Though the scratching behavior cannot definitely be termed as an anxious behavior, evidence suggests this is the case. An aggressor's scratching decreases significantly after reconciliation. This suggests reconciliation rather than a property of the conflict is the cause of reduction in scratching behavior. Though these results seem counterintuitive, the anxiety of the aggressor appears to have a basis in the risks of ruining cooperative relationships with the opponent. =Kin altruism and spite= Macaca fascicularis fascicularis at the Bukit Timah Nature Reserve ‚Äì Singapore. Video Clip In a study, a group of crab-eating macaques was given ownership of a food object. Unsurprisingly, adult females favored their own offspring by passively, yet preferentially, allowing them to feed on the objects they held. When juveniles were in possession of an object, mothers robbed them and acted aggressively at an increased rate towards their own offspring compared to other juveniles. These observations suggest close proximity influences behavior in ownership, as a mother's kin are closer to her on average. When given a nonfood object and two owners, one being a kin and one not, the rival will choose the older individual to attack regardless of kinship. Though the hypothesis remains that mother-juvenile relationships may facilitate social learning of ownership, the combined results clearly point to aggression towards the least-threatening individual. A study was conducted in which food was given to 11 females. They were then given a choice to share the food with kin or nonkin. The kin altruism hypothesis suggests the mothers would preferentially give food to their own offspring. Yet eight of the 11 females did not discriminate between kin and nonkin. The remaining three did, in fact, give more food to their kin. The results suggest it was not kin selection, but instead spite that fueled feeding kin preferentially. This is due to the observation that food was given to kin for a significantly longer period of time than needed. The benefit to the mother is decreased due to less food availability for herself and the cost remains great for nonkin due to not receiving food. If these results are correct, crab-eating macaques are unique in the animal kingdom, as they appear not only to behave according to the kin selection theory, but also act spiteful toward one another. =Reproduction= Adult crab-eating macaque with a baby After a gestation period of 162‚Äì193 days, the female gives birth to one infant. The infant's weight at birth is about . Infants are born with black fur which will begin to turn to a grey or reddish-brown shade (depending on the subspecies) after about three months of age. This natal coat may indicate to others the status of the infant, and other group members treat infants with care and rush to their defense when distressed. Immigrant males sometimes kill infants not their own in order to shorten interbirth intervals. High-ranking females will sometimes kidnap the infants of lower-ranking females. These kidnappings can result in the death of the infants, as the other female is usually not lactating. A young juvenile stays mainly with its mother and relatives. As male juveniles get older, they become more peripheral to the group. Here they play together, forming crucial bonds that may help them when they leave their natal group. Males that emigrate with a partner are more successful than those that leave alone. Young females, though, stay with the group and become incorporated into the matriline into which they were born. Male crab-eating macaques groom females to increase the chance of mating. A female is more likely to engage in sexual activity with a male that has recently groomed her than with one that has not. =Diet= A crab-eating macaque in repose Despite its name, the crab-eating macaque typically does not consume crabs as its main food source; rather, it is an opportunistic omnivore, eating a variety of animals and plants. Although fruits and seeds make up 60 - 90% of its diet, it also eat leaves, flowers, roots, and bark. It sometimes preys on vertebrates including bird chicks, nesting female birds, lizards, frogs, and fish, invertebrates, and bird eggs. In Indonesia, it has become a proficient swimmer and diver for crabs and other crustaceans in mangrove swamps. In Bukit Timah, Singapore its diet consists of 44% fruit, 27% animal matter, 15% flowers and other plant matter, and 14% food provided by humans. The crab-eating macaque exhibits particularly low tolerance for swallowing seeds. Despite its inability to digest seeds, many primates of similar size swallow large seeds, up to , and simply defecate them whole. The crab-eating macaque, though, spits seeds out if they are larger than . This decision to spit seeds is thought to be adaptive; it avoids filling the monkey's stomach with wasteful bulky seeds that cannot be used for energy. It also can help the plants by distributing seeds to new areas: Crab-eating macaques eat durians such as Durio graveolens and D. zibethinus, and are a major seed disperser for the latter species. Although the crab-eating macaque is ecologically well-adapted and poses no threat to population stability of prey species in its native range, in areas where it is not native, it can pose a substantial threat to biodiversity. Some believe the crab-eating macaque is responsible for the extinction of forest birds by threatening critical breeding areas as well as eating the eggs and chicks of endangered forest birds. The crab-eating macaque can become a synanthrope, living off human resources. It feeds in cultivated fields on young dry rice, cassava leaves, rubber fruit, taro plants, coconuts, mangos, and other crops, often causing significant losses to local farmers. In villages, towns, and cities, it frequently takes food from garbage cans and refuse piles. It can become unafraid of humans in these conditions, which can lead to macaques directly taking food from people, both passively and aggressively. =Tool use= Stone tool usage by crab-eating macaques in Laem Son National Park in Thailand In Thailand and Myanmar, crab-eating macaques use stone tools to open nuts, oysters and other bivalves, and various types of sea snails (nerites, muricids, trochids, etc.) along the Andaman sea coast and offshore islands. Another instance of tool use is washing and rubbing foods such as sweet potatoes, cassava roots, and papaya leaves before consumption. Crab-eating macaques either soak these foods in water or rub them through their hands as if to clean them. They also peel the sweet potatoes, using their incisors and canine teeth. Adolescents appear to acquire these behaviors by observational learning of older individuals. Distribution and habitat The crab-eating macaque lives in a wide variety of habitats, including primary lowland rainforests, disturbed and secondary rainforests, shrubland, and riverine and coastal forests of nipa palm and mangrove. They also easily adjust to human settlements; they are considered sacred at some Hindu temples and on some small islands, but are pests around farms and villages. Typically, they prefer disturbed habitats and forest periphery. The native range of this species includes most of mainland Southeast Asia, from extreme southeastern Bangladesh south through Malaysia, and the Maritime Southeast Asia islands of Sumatra, Java, and Borneo, offshore islands, the islands of the Philippines, and the Nicobar Islands in the Bay of Bengal. This primate is a rare example of a terrestrial mammal that violates the Wallace line. =Introduced range= The crab-eating macaque is an introduced alien species in several countries, including Hong Kong, Taiwan, Irian Jaya, Papua New Guinea, New Britain, New Ireland, New Caledonia, Solomon Islands, Fiji, Tonga, Samoa, Nauru, Vanuatu, Pohnpei, Anggaur Island in Palau, and Mauritius. This has led the Invasive Species Specialist Group of the International Union for Conservation of Nature to list the crab-eating macaque as one of the \\"100 of the World's Worst Invasive Alien Species\\". In Mauritius, it is a threat for the endemic and endangered Roussea simplex, as it destroys its flowers. Where it is not a native species, particularly on island ecosystems whose species often evolved in isolation from large predators, it is a documented threat to many native species. The immunovaccine porcine zona pellucida (PZP), which causes infertility in females, is currently being tested in Hong Kong to investigate its use as potential population control. Relationship with humans Bukit Timah, Singapore A crab-eating macaque living in a human vicinity, with a stolen asthma inhaler Young captive monkey tethered Crab-eating macaques extensively overlap with humans across their range in Southeast Asia. Consequently, they live together in many locations. Some of these areas are associated with religious sites and local customs, such as the temples of Bali in Indonesia, Thailand, and Cambodia, while other areas are characterized by conflict as a result of habitat loss and competition over food and space. Humans and crab-eating macaques have shared environments since prehistoric times, and both tend to frequent forest and river edge habitats. Crab-eating macaques are occasionally used as a food source for some indigenous forest- dwelling peoples. In Mauritius, they are captured and sold to the pharmaceutical industry, and in Angaur and Palau, they are sold as pets. Macaques feed on sugarcane and other crops, affecting agriculture and livelihoods, and can be aggressive towards humans. Macaques may carry potentially fatal human diseases, including herpes B virus. The macaques have also developed a reputation for actively stealing items from humans (cameras, eyeglasses, hats, etc.), then refusing to return their stolen goods until given food in return. This unique form of kleptoparasitism (known as \\"robbing and bartering\\") has primarily been observed in smaller groups of macaques living near Hindu temples and tourist-heavy areas, suggesting it is a learned behaviour within social groups, in response to realizing that humans would trade food for their possessions back. =In scientific research= M. fascicularis is also used extensively in medical experiments, in particular those connected with neuroscience and disease. Due to their close physiology, they can share infections with humans. Some cases of concern have been an isolated event of Reston ebolavirus found in a captive-bred population shipped to the US from the Philippines, which was later found to be a strain of Ebola that has no known pathological consequences in humans, unlike the African strains. Furthermore, they are a known carrier of monkey B virus (Herpesvirus simiae), a virus which has produced disease in some lab workers working mainly with rhesus macaques (M. mulatta). Nafovanny, the largest facility for the captive breeding of nonhuman primates in the world, houses 30,000 macaques . Plasmodium knowlesi, which causes malaria in M. fascicularis, can also infect humans. A few cases have been documented in humans, but for how long humans have been getting infections of this malarial strain is unknown. It is, therefore, not possible to assess if this is a newly emerging health threat, or if just newly discovered due to improved malarial detection techniques. Given the long history of humans and macaques living together in Southeast Asia, it is likely the latter. The use of crab-eating macaques and other nonhuman primates in experimentation is controversial with critics charging that the experiments are cruel, unnecessary and lead to dubious findings. One of the most well known examples of experiments on crab-eating macaques is the 1981 Silver Spring monkeys case. In 2014, 21,768 crab-eating macaques were imported in the United States to be used in experimentation. =Conservation status= Female and juvenile crab-eating macaques at Djuanda Forest Park, West Java, Indonesia The crab-eating macaque has the third-largest range of any primate species, behind only humans and rhesus macaques. The IUCN Red List categorizes the species as Vulnerable, and CITES lists them as Appendix II (\\"not necessarily threatened with extinction\\", in which trade must be controlled to avoid use incompatible with their survival). Its IUCN status was downgraded from Least Concern in 2020 as a result of declining population resulting from hunting and troublesome interactions with humans, despite its wide range and ability to adapt to different habitats. and is listed as vulnerable on the IUCN Red List. The Philippine long-tailed macaque (M. f. philippensis) is listed as near threatened, and M. f. condorensis is vulnerable. All other subspecies are listed as data deficient and need further study; although recent work is showing M. f. aurea and M. f. karimondjawae need increased protection. One concern for conservation is, in areas where M. fascicularis is not native, their populations need to be monitored and managed to reduce their impact on native flora and fauna.  Genome  The genome of the crab-eating macaque has been sequenced.  Clones  On 24 January 2018, scientists in China reported in the journal Cell the creation of two crab- eating macaque clones, named Zhong Zhong and Hua Hua, using the complex DNA transfer method that produced Dolly the sheep. This makes Zhong Zhong and Hua Hua the first primates to be cloned using the somatic cell nuclear transfer method.

Other common names, depending on region, include milkweed, common tiger, wanderer, and black veined brown. It may be the most familiar North American butterfly, and is considered an iconic pollinator species. Its wings feature an easily recognizable black, orange, and white pattern, with a wingspan of A M√ºllerian mimic, the viceroy butterfly, is similar in color and pattern, but is markedly smaller and has an extra black stripe across each hindwing. The eastern North American monarch population is notable for its annual southward late- summer/autumn migration from the northern and central United States and southern Canada to Florida and Mexico. During the fall migration, monarchs cover thousands of miles, with a corresponding multi-generational return north. The western North American population of monarchs west of the Rocky Mountains often migrates to sites in southern California but has been found in overwintering Mexican sites as well. Monarchs have been bred on the International Space Station.  Taxonomy  morph of the monarch in Hawaii called white monarch The name \\"monarch\\" is believed to have been given in honor of King William III of England, as the butterfly's main color is that of the king's secondary title Prince of Orange. The monarch was originally described by Carl Linnaeus in his Systema Naturae of 1758 and placed in the genus Papilio. In 1780, Jan Krzysztof Kluk used the monarch as the type species for a new genus, Danaus. Danaus (Ancient Greek ), a great-grandson of Zeus, was a mythical king in Egypt or Libya, who founded Argos; Plexippus () was one of the 50 sons of Aegyptus, the twin brother of Danaus. In Homeric Greek, his name means \\"one who urges on horses\\", i.e., \\"rider\\" or \\"charioteer\\". In the 10th edition of Systema Naturae, at the bottom of page 467, Linnaeus wrote that the names of the Danai festivi, the division of the genus to which Papilio plexippus belonged, were derived from the sons of Aegyptus. Linnaeus divided his large genus Papilio, containing all known butterfly species, into what we would now call subgenera. The Danai festivi formed one of the \\"subgenera\\", containing colorful species, as opposed to the Danai candidi, containing species with bright white wings. Linnaeus wrote: \\"\\" (English: \\"The names of the Danai candidi have been derived from the daughters of Danaus, those of the Danai festivi from the sons of Aegyptus.\\") Robert Michael Pyle suggested Danaus is a masculinized version of Dana√´ (Greek ), Danaus's great-great-granddaughter, to whom Zeus came as a shower of gold, which seemed to him a more appropriate source for the name of this butterfly. There are three species of monarch butterflies: * D. plexippus, described by Linnaeus in 1758, is the species known most commonly as the monarch butterfly of North America. Its range actually extends worldwide and can be found in Hawaii, Australia, New Zealand, Spain and the Pacific Islands. * D. erippus, the southern monarch, was described by Pieter Cramer in 1775. This species is found in tropical and subtropical latitudes of South America, mainly in Brazil, Uruguay, Paraguay, Argentina, Bolivia, Chile and southern Peru. The South American monarch and the North American monarch may have been one species at one time. Some researchers believe the southern monarch separated from the monarch's population some 2 mya, at the end of the Pliocene. Sea levels were higher, and the entire Amazonas lowland was a vast expanse of brackish swamp that offered limited butterfly habitat. * D. cleophile, the Jamaican monarch, described by Jean-Baptiste Godart in 1819, ranges from Jamaica to Hispaniola. Six subspecies and two color morphs of D. plexippus have been identified: * D. p. plexippus ‚Äì nominate subspecies, described by Linnaeus in 1758, is the migratory subspecies known from most of North America. ** D. p. p. form nivosus, the white monarch commonly found on Oahu, Hawaii, and rarely in other locations. ** D. p. p. (as yet unnamed) ‚Äì a color morph lacking some wing vein markings. * D. p. nigrippus (Richard Haensch, 1909) ‚Äì as forma: Danais archippus f. nigrippus. Hay-Roe et al. in 2007 identified this taxon as a subspecies: * D. p. megalippe (Jacob H√ºbner, [1826]) ‚Äì nonmigratory subspecies, and is found from Florida and Georgia southwards, throughout the Caribbean and Central America to the Amazon River. * D. p. leucogyne (Arthur G. Butler, 1884) ‚àí St. Thomas * D. p. portoricensis Austin Hobart Clark, 1941 ‚àí Puerto Rico * D. p. tobagi Austin Hobart Clark, 1941 ‚àí Tobago The percentage of the white morph in Oahu is nearing 10%. On other Hawaiian islands, the white morph occurs at a relatively low frequency. White monarchs (nivosus) have been found throughout the world, including Australia, New Zealand, Indonesia, and the United States. Some taxonomists disagree on these classifications. Monarchs belong in the subfamily Danainae of the family Nymphalidae; Danainae was formerly considered a separately family Danaidae. A 2015 paper identified genes from wasp bracoviruses in the genome of the North American monarch leading to articles about monarch butterflies being genetically modified organisms.  Description  Monarch butterfly The monarch's wingspan ranges from . The upper sides of the wings are tawny orange, the veins and margins are black, and there are two series of small white spots in the margins. Monarch forewings also have a few orange spots near their tips. Wing undersides are similar, but the tips of forewings and hindwings are yellow brown instead of tawny orange and the white spots are larger. The shape and color of the wings change at the beginning of the migration and appear redder and more elongated than later migrants. Wings size and shape differ between migratory and non-migratory monarchs. Monarchs from eastern North America have larger and more angular forewings than those in the western population. Monarchs are commonly and easily mistaken for the similar viceroy butterfly ‚Äì the two species are M√ºllerian mimics. Monarch flight has been described as \\"slow and sailing\\", with a flight speed estimated at approximately 9 km/h or 5.5 mph. For comparison, the average human jogs at a rate of . Adults are sexually dimorphic. Males are slightly larger than females and have a black patch or spot of androconial scales on each hindwing (in some butterflies, these patches disperse pheromones, but are not known to do so in monarchs). The male's black wing veins are lighter and narrower than those of females. One variation, the \\"white monarch\\", observed in Australia, New Zealand, Indonesia and the United States, is called \\"nivosus\\" by lepidopterists. It is grayish white in all areas of its wings that are normally orange and is only about 1% or less of all monarchs, but populations as high as 10% exist on Oahu in Hawaii. The monarch has six legs like all insects, but uses only its middle legs and hindlegs as the forelegs are vestigial, as in all Nymphalidae, and held against its body. Monarch flying away from a Mexican sunflower = Detailed measurements = Male and female monarch measurements A study in 2015 examined a preserved collection of male and female monarch specimens from eastern North America to evaluate the sex- based differences in fine-scale wing and body structure. The study found significant differences in overall wing size and in the physical dimensions of wings. Males tended to have larger wings than females, and were heavier than females, on average. Both males and females had similar thorax dimensions (wing muscles are contained in the thorax). Female monarchs tended to have thicker wings, which is thought to convey greater tensile strength. This would make female wings less likely to be damaged during migration. Also, females had lower wing loading than males (wing loading is a value derived from the ratio of wing size to body mass), which would mean females require less energy to fly.  Distribution and habitat  String of monarchs wintering at the Pismo State Beach Monarch Preserve, 2015 The range of the western and eastern populations of D. plexippus plexippus expands and contracts depending upon the season. The range differs between breeding areas, migration routes, and winter roosts. However, no genetic differences between the western and eastern monarch populations exist; reproductive isolation has not led to subspeciation of these populations, as it has elsewhere within the species' range. In the Americas, the monarch ranges from southern Canada through northern South America. It has also been found in Bermuda, Cook Islands, Hawaii, Cuba, and other Caribbean islands the Solomons, New Caledonia, New Zealand, Papua New Guinea, Australia, the Azores, the Canary Islands, Madeira, Gibraltar,Gibraltar Ornithological and Natural History Society \\"Provisional species list of the Lepidoptera\\" the Philippines, and North Africa. It appears in the UK in some years as an accidental migrant. Overwintering populations of D. plexippus plexippus are found in Mexico, California, along the Gulf Coast, year round in Florida, and in Arizona where the habitat has the specific conditions necessary for their survival.Cech, Rick and Tudor, Guy (2005). Butterflies of the East Coast. Princeton University Press, Princeton, NJ. Iftner, David C.; Shuey, John A. and Calhoun, John C. (1992). Butterflies and Skippers of Ohio. College of Biological Sciences and The Ohio State University. On the US East Coast, they have overwintered as far north as Lago Mar, Virginia Beach, Virginia. Their wintering habitat typically provides access to streams, plenty of sunlight (enabling body temperatures that allow flight), and appropriate roosting vegetation, and is relatively free of predators. Overwintering, roosting butterflies have been seen on basswoods, elms, sumacs, locusts, oaks, osage-oranges, mulberries, pecans, willows, cottonwoods, and mesquites. While breeding, monarch habitats can be found in agricultural fields, pasture land, prairie remnants, urban and suburban residential areas, gardens, trees, and roadsides ‚Äì anywhere where there is access to larval host plants. Habitat restoration is a primary goal in monarch conservation efforts. Habitat requirements change during migration. During the fall migration, butterflies must have access to nectar-producing plants. During the spring migration, butterflies must have access to larval food plants and nectar plants.  Life cycle  The monarch butterfly undergoes four stages of complete metamorphosis: = Eggs = The eggs are derived from materials ingested as larvae and from the spermatophores received from males during mating.Oberhauser (2004), p. 3 Eggs are laid singly on the underside of a young leaf of a milkweed plant during the spring and summer months. The eggs are cream colored or light green, ovate to conical in shape, and about 1.2√ó0.9 mm in size. The eggs weigh less than 0.5 mg each and have raised ridges that form longitudinally from the point to apex to the base. Though each egg is the mass of the female, she may lay up to her own mass in eggs. Females lay smaller eggs as they age. Larger females lay larger eggs. The number of eggs laid by a female, who may mate several times, ranges from 290 to 1180.Oberhauser (2004), p. 23 Females lay their eggs on the underside of the milkweed leaves; the offspring's consumption of the milkweed benefits health and helps defend them against predators. Eggs take 3 to 8 days to develop and hatch into larva or caterpillars. Monarchs will lay eggs along the southern migration route.Oberhauser (2004), p. 51 = Larvae = The caterpillar goes through five major distinct stages of growth, and after each one it molts. Each caterpillar, or instar, is larger than the previous after molting, as it eats and stores energy in the form of fat and nutrients to carry it through the nonfeeding pupal stage. Each instar lasts about 3 to 5 days, depending on various factors such as temperature and food availability. Fifth instar with the white spots visible on the prolegs The first instar caterpillar that emerges from the egg is pale green and translucent. It lacks banding coloration or tentacles. The larvae or caterpillar eats its egg case and begins to feed on milkweed. It is during this stage of growth that the caterpillar begins to sequester cardenolides. The circular motion a caterpillar uses while eating milkweed prevents the flow of latex that could entrap it. The first instar is usually between 2 and 6 mm long. The second instar larva develops a characteristic pattern of white, yellow and black transverse bands. It is no longer translucent but is covered in short setae. Pairs of black tentacles begin to grow, one pair on the thorax and another pair on the abdomen. Like the first instar, second instar larvae usually eat holes in the middle of the leaf, rather than at the edges. The second instar is usually between 6 mm and 1 cm long. The third instar larva has more distinct bands and the two pairs of tentacles become longer. Legs on the thorax differentiate into a smaller pair near the head and larger pairs further back. These third-stage caterpillars begin to eat along the leaf edges. The third instar is usually between 1 and 1.5 cm long. The fourth instar has a different banding pattern. It develops white spots on the prolegs near the back of the caterpillar. It is usually between 1.5 and 2.5 cm long. The fifth instar larva has a more complex banding pattern and white dots on the prolegs, with front legs that are small and very close to the head. A caterpillar at this stage has an enormous appetite, being able to consume a large milkweed leaf in a day. Its length ranges from 2.5 to 4.5 cm. eastern black swallowtail caterpillar (top), a monarch caterpillar (middle), and a queen caterpillar (bottom). As the caterpillar completes its growth, it is 4.5 cm long (large specimens can reach 5 cm) and 7 to 8 mm wide, and weighs about 1.5 grams, compared to the first instar, which was 2 to 6 mm long and 0.5 to 1.5 mm wide. Fifth-instar larvae increase in weight 2000 times from first instars. Fifth-stage instar larva can chew through the petiole or midrib of milkweed leaves and stop the flow of latex. After this, they eat more leaf tissue. Before pupation, larvae must consume milkweed to increase their mass, after which they stop feeding and search for a pupation site. = Pupa = Adult monarch emerges from its chrysalis shell To prepare for the pupa or chrysalis stage, the caterpillar chooses a safe place for pupation, where it spins a silk pad on a downward-facing horizontal surface. At this point, it turns around and securely latches on with its last pair of hindlegs and hangs upside down, in the form of the letter J. After \\"J-hanging\\" for about 12‚Äì16 hours, it will suddenly straighten out its body and go into peristalsis some seconds before its skin splits behind its head. It then sheds its skin over a period of a few minutes, revealing a green chrysalis. At first, the chrysalis is long, soft, and somewhat amorphous, but over a few hours it compacts into its distinct shape ‚Äì an opaque, pale-green chrysalis with small golden dots near the bottom, and a gold-and-black rim around the dorsal side near the top. At first, its exoskeleton is soft and fragile, but it hardens and becomes more durable within about a day. At this point, it is about 2.5 cm (1\\") long and 10‚Äì12 mm (3/8‚Äì7/16\\") wide, weighing about 1.2 grams. At normal summer temperatures, it matures in 8‚Äì15 days (usually 11‚Äì12 days). During this pupal stage, the adult butterfly forms inside. Within a day or so before emerging is due, the exoskeleton first becomes translucent and the chrysalis more bluish. Finally, within 12 hours or so, it becomes transparent, revealing the black and orange colors of the butterfly inside before it ecloses (emerges). = Adult = An adult butterfly emerges after about two weeks as a chrysalis, and hangs upside down for a few hours until its wings are dry. Fluids are pumped into the wings, which expand, dry, and stiffen. The monarch extends and retracts its wings, and once conditions allow, flies and feeds on a variety of nectar plants. During the breeding season, adults reach sexual maturity in four or five days. However, the migrating generation does not reach maturity until overwintering is complete. Monarchs typically live for two to five weeks during their breeding season. Larvae growing in high densities are smaller, have lower survival, and weigh less as adults compared with those growing in lower densities. Monarch metamorphosis from egg to adult occurs during the warm summer temperatures in as little as 25 days, extending to as many as seven weeks during cool spring conditions. During the development, both larvae and their milkweed hosts are vulnerable to weather extremes, predators, parasites and diseases; commonly fewer than 10% of monarch eggs and caterpillars survive. However, this is a natural attrition rate for most butterflies, since they are low on the food chain.  Reproduction  Monarch butterfly mating Females and males typically mate more than once. Females that mate several times lay more eggs. Mating for the overwintering populations occurs in the spring, prior to dispersion. Mating is less dependent on pheromones than other species in its genus. Male search and capture strategies may influence copulatory success, and human-induced changes to the habitat can influence monarch mating activity at overwintering sites. Courtship occurs in two phases. During the aerial phase, a male pursues and often forces a female to the ground. During the ground phase, the butterflies copulate and remain attached for about 30 to 60 minutes. Only 30% of mating attempts end in copulation, suggesting that females may be able to avoid mating, though some have more success than others. During copulation, a male transfers his spermatophore to a female. Along with sperm, the spermatophore provides a female with nutrition, which aids her in egg laying. An increase in spermatophore size increases the fecundity of female monarchs. Males that produce larger spermatophores also fertilize more females' eggs. = Pictorial life cycle = File:Danaus plexippus, Monarch egg.jpgEgg File:Monarch caterpillar 3 (42248005090).jpgCaterpillar File:Starr 050208-3854 Asclepias physocarpa.jpgFeeding on milkweed File:Monarch Butterfly Danaus plexippus Pupation 2419px.jpgBeginning pupation File:Monarch Butterfly Cocoon 3.jpgChrysalis File:Eclosing Danaus plexippus, monarch butterfly, life cycle Megan McCarty118.JPGEmerging from chrysalis File:Monarch Butterfly Danaus plexippus Mating Vertical 1800px.jpgMating File:Monarch Butterfly Danaus plexippus Laying Eggs.jpgLaying eggs  Larval host plants  The host plants used by the monarch caterpillar include: Swamp milkweed, one of many species of Asclepias milkweeds used by the monarch * Asclepias angustifolia ‚Äì Arizona milkweed . * Asclepias asperula ‚Äì antelope horns milkweed * Asclepias californica ‚Äì California milkweed * Asclepias cordifolia ‚Äì heartleaf milkweed * Asclepias curassavica * Asclepias eriocarpa ‚Äì woolly pod milkweed * Asclepias erosa ‚Äì desert milkweed * Asclepias exaltata ‚Äì poke milkweed * Asclepias fascicularis ‚Äì Mexican whorled milkweed * Asclepias humistrata ‚Äì sandhill/pinewoods milkweed * Asclepias incarnata ‚Äì swamp milkweed * Asclepias nivea ‚Äì Caribbean milkweed * Asclepias oenotheroide ‚Äì zizotes milkweed * Asclepias perennis ‚Äì aquatic milkweed * Asclepias speciosa ‚Äì showy milkweed * Asclepias subulata ‚Äì rush milkweed * Asclepias syriaca ‚Äì common milkweed(1) .

Year-round plantings in the USA are controversial and criticised, as they may be the cause of new overwintering sites along the U.S. Gulf Coast, leading to year-round breeding of monarchs. This is thought to adversely affect migration patterns, and to cause a dramatic buildup of the dangerous parasite, Ophryocystis elektroscirrha. New research also has shown that monarch larvae reared on tropical milkweed show reduced migratory development (reproductive diapause), and when migratory adults are exposed to tropical milkweed, it stimulates reproductive tissue growth.  Adult food sources  Nectaring on purple coneflower (Echinacea purpurea) Although larvae eat only milkweed, adult monarchs feed on the nectar of many plants including: * Apocynum cannabinum ‚Äì Indian hemp * Asclepias sp. ‚Äì milkweeds * Aster sp. ‚Äì asters * Cirsium sp. ‚Äì thistles * Daucus carota ‚Äì wild carrot * Dipsacus sylvestris ‚Äì teasel * Echinacea sp. ‚Äì coneflowers * Erigeron canadensis ‚Äì horseweed * Eupatorium maculatum ‚Äì spotted Joe-Pye weed * Eupatorium perfoliatum ‚Äì common boneset * Hesperis matronalis ‚Äì dame's rocket * Liatris sp. ‚Äì blazing stars * Medicago sativa ‚Äì alfalfa * Solidago sp. ‚Äì goldenrod * Syringa vulgaris ‚Äì lilac * Trifolium pratense ‚Äì red clover * Vernonia altissima ‚Äì tall ironweed Monarchs obtain moisture and minerals from damp soil and wet gravel, a behavior known as mud-puddling. The monarch has also been noticed puddling at an oil stain on pavement.  Migration  In North America, monarchs migrate both north and south on an annual basis, in a long-distance journey that is fraught with risks. The population east of the Rocky Mountains attempts to migrate to the sanctuaries of the Mariposa Monarca Biosphere Reserve in Mexico and parts of Florida. The western population tries to reach overwintering destinations in various coastal sites in central and southern California. The overwintered population of those east of the Rockies may reach as far north as Texas and Oklahoma during the spring migration. The second, third and fourth generations return to their northern locations in the United States and Canada in the spring. Captive-raised monarchs appear capable of migrating to overwintering sites in Mexico, though they have a much lower migratory success rate than wild monarchs do. See section on captive-rearing below. Monarch overwintering sites have been discovered recently in Arizona. Monarchs from the eastern US generally migrate longer distances than monarchs from the western US.  Vision  Physiological experiments suggest that monarch butterflies view the world through a tetrachromatic system. Like humans, their retina contain three types of opsin proteins, expressed in distinct photoreceptor cells, each of which absorbs light at a different wavelength. Unlike humans, one of those types of photoreceptor cells corresponds to a wavelength in the ultraviolet range; the other two correspond to blue and green. In addition to these three photoreceptors cells in the main retina, monarch butterfly eyes contain orange filtering pigments that filter the light reaching some but not all green-absorbing opsins, thereby making a fourth photoreceptor cell sensitive to longer wavelength light. The combination of filtered and unfiltered green opsins permits the butterflies to distinguish yellow from orange colors. The ultraviolet opsin protein has also been detected in the dorsal rim region of monarch eyes. One study suggests that this allows the butterflies the ability to detect ultraviolet polarized skylight in order to orient themselves with the sun for their long migratory flight. These butterflies are capable of distinguishing colors based on their wavelength only, and not based on intensity; this phenomenon is termed \\"true color vision\\". This is important for many butterfly behaviors, including seeking nectar for nourishment, choosing a mate, and finding milkweed to lay eggs on. One study found that floral color is more easily recognized at a distance by butterflies searching for nectar than floral shape. This is may be because flowers have highly contrasting colors to the green background of a vegetative landscape. On the other hand, leaf shape is important for oviposition so that the butterflies can ensure their eggs are being laid on milkweed. Beyond the perception of color, the ability to remember certain colors is essential in the life of monarch butterflies. Researchers have found that these insects can easily learn to associate color and, to a lesser extent shape, with sugary food rewards. When searching for nectar, color is the first cue that draws the insect's attention toward a potential food source, and shape is a secondary characteristic that promotes the process. When searching for a place to lay one's eggs, the roles of color and shape are switched. There may also be a difference between male and female butterflies from other species in terms of the ability to learn certain colors; however, there is no differences between the sexes for monarch butterflies.  Defense against predators  In both caterpillar and butterfly form, monarchs are aposematic‚Äîwarding off predators with a bright display of contrasting colors to warn potential predators of their undesirable taste and poisonous characteristics. Large larvae are able to avoid wasp predation by dropping from the plant or by jerking their bodies.Oberhauser (2004), p. 44 = Aposematism = Chemical structure of oleandrin, one of the cardiac glycosides Monarchs are foul tasting and poisonous due to the presence of cardenolides in their bodies, which the caterpillars ingest as they feed on milkweed. Monarchs and other cardenolide resistant insects rely on a resistant form of the Na+/ K+-ATPase enzyme to tolerate significantly higher concentrations of cardenolides than nonresistant species. By ingesting a large amount of plants in the genus Asclepias, primarily milkweed, monarch caterpillars are able to sequester cardiac glycosides, or more specifically cardenolides, which are steroids that act in heart-arresting ways similar to digitalis. It has been found that monarchs are able to sequester cardenolides most effectively from plants of intermediate cardenolide content rather than those of high or low content. Additional studies have shown that different species of milkweed have different effects on growth, virulence, and transmission of parasites. One species, Asclepias curassavica, appears to reduce the symptoms of Ophryocystis elektroscirrha (OE) infection. There are two possible explanations for this: that it promotes overall monarch health to boost the monarch's immune system; or that chemicals from the plant have a direct negative effect on the OE parasites. A. curassavica does not cure or prevent the infection with OE, it merely allows infected monarchs to live longer, and this would allow infected monarchs to spread the OE spores for longer periods. For the average home butterfly garden, this scenario will only add more OE to the local population. After the caterpillar becomes a butterfly, the toxins shift to different parts of the body. Since many birds attack the wings of the butterfly, having three times the cardiac glycosides in the wings leaves predators with a very foul taste and may prevent them from ever ingesting the body of the butterfly. In order to combat predators that remove the wings only to ingest the abdomen, monarchs keep the most potent cardiac glycosides in their abdomens. Butterfly weed (Asclepias tuberosa) lacks significant amounts of cardiac glycosides, but instead contains other types of toxic glycosides, including pregnanes.(1) (2) (3) This difference may reduce the toxicity of monarchs whose larvae feed on that milkweed species, as a naturalist has reported that monarch caterpillars do not favor the plant.(1) (2) . Some other milkweeds may have similar characteristics. = Mimicry = Monarch (left) and viceroy (right) butterflies exhibiting M√ºllerian mimicry Monarchs share the defense of noxious taste with the similar-appearing viceroy butterfly in what is perhaps one of the most well-known examples of mimicry. Though long purported to be an example of Batesian mimicry, the viceroy is actually reportedly more unpalatable than the monarch, making this a case of M√ºllerian mimicry.  Human interaction  The monarch is the state insect of Alabama, Idaho, Illinois, Minnesota, Texas, Vermont, and West Virginia. Legislation was introduced to make it the national insect of the United States, but this failed in 1989 and again in 1991. A growing number of homeowners are establishing butterfly gardens; monarchs can be attracted by cultivating a butterfly garden with specific milkweed species and nectar plants. Efforts are underway to establish these monarch waystations. An IMAX film, Flight of the Butterflies, describes the story of the Urquharts, Brugger and Trail to document the then unknown monarch migration to Mexican overwintering areas. Sanctuaries and reserves have been created at overwintering locations in Mexico and California to limit habitat destruction. These sites can generate significant tourism revenue. However, with less tourism, monarch butterflies will have a higher survival rate because they show more protein content and a higher value of immune response and oxidative defense. Organizations and individuals participate in tagging programs. Tagging information is used to study migration patterns. The 2012 novel by Barbara Kingsolver, Flight Behavior, deals with the appearance of a large population in the Appalachians.HarperCollins Inc; UK, Faber and Faber = Captive rearing = One of the most direct ways humans are interacting with monarchs is by rearing them in captivity, which has become increasingly popular, although there are risks to this activity, and this has become a controversial topic. On one hand there are many positive aspects of captive rearing. Monarchs are bred in schools and used for butterfly releases at hospices, memorial events and weddings. Memorial services for the September 11 attacks include the release of captive-bred monarchs. Monarchs are used in schools and nature centers for educational purposes. Many homeowners raise monarchs in captivity as a hobby and for educational purposes. On the other hand this practice becomes problematic when monarchs are \\"mass-reared\\". Stories in the Huffington Post in 2015 and Discover magazine in 2016 have summarized the controversy around this issue. The frequent media reports of monarch declines has empowered many homeowners to attempt to rear as many monarchs as possible in their homes and then release them to the wild in an effort to \\"boost the monarch population\\". Some individuals have taken this practice to the extreme, with massive operations that rear thousands of monarchs at once, like one in Linn County, Iowa. However, the practice of rearing \\"large\\" numbers of monarchs in captivity for release into the wild is not condoned by monarch scientists, because of the risks of genetic issues and disease spread.Rearing Monarchs Responsibly: A conservationist's guide to raising monarchs for science and education. Monarch Joint Venture, University of Minnesota One of the biggest concerns of mass-rearing is the potential for spreading the monarch parasite, Ophryocystis elektroscirrha, into the wild. This parasite can rapidly build up in captive monarchs, especially if they are housed together. The spores of the parasite also can quickly contaminate all housing equipment, so that all subsequent monarchs reared in the same containers then become infected. One researcher stated that rearing more than 100 monarchs constitutes \\"mass-rearing\\" and should not be done. In addition to the disease risks, researchers believe these captive-reared monarchs are not as fit as wild ones, owing to the unnatural conditions they are raised in. Homeowners often raise monarchs in plastic or glass containers in their kitchens, basements, porches, etc., and under artificial lighting and controlled temperatures. Such conditions would not mimic what the monarchs are used to in the wild, and may result in adult monarchs that are unsuited for the realities of their wild existence. In support of this, a recent study by a citizen scientist found that captive-reared monarchs have a lower migration success rate than wild monarchs do. A study published in 2019 shed light on the fitness of captive-reared monarchs, by testing reared and wild monarchs on a tethered flight apparatus that assessed navigational ability. In that study, monarchs that were reared to adulthood in artificial conditions showed a reduction in navigational ability. This happened even with monarchs that were brought into captivity from the wild for a few days. A few captive-reared monarchs did show proper navigation. This study revealed the fragility of monarch development: if the conditions are not suitable, their ability to properly migrate could be impaired. The same study also examined the genetics of a collection of reared monarchs purchased from a butterfly breeder, and found they were dramatically different from wild monarchs, so much so that the lead author described them as \\"franken-monarchs\\". An unpublished study in 2019 compared behavior of captive-reared versus wild monarch larvae. The study showed that reared larvae exhibited more defensive behavior than wild larvae. The reason for this is unknown, but it could relate to the fact that reared larvae are frequently handled and/or disturbed.  Genome  The monarch was the first butterfly to have its genome sequenced. The 273-million base pair draft sequence includes a set of 16,866 protein-coding genes. The genome provides researchers insights into migratory behavior, the circadian clock, juvenile hormone pathways and microRNAs that are differentially expressed between summer and migratory monarchs. More recently, the genetic basis of monarch migration and warning coloration has been described. There is no genetic differentiation between the migratory populations of eastern and western North America. Recent research has identified the specific areas in the genome of the monarch that regulate migration. There appears to be no genetic difference between a migrating and nonmigrating monarch but the gene is expressed in migrating monarchs but not expressed in nonmigrating monarchs.  Conservation status  Area covered by monarchs (Danaus plexippus, eastern migratory population) in their overwintering areas in Mexico between 1993 and 2018. The monarch butterfly is not currently listed under the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES) or protected specifically under U.S. domestic laws. On 14 August 2014, the Center for Biological Diversity and the Center for Food Safety filed a legal petition requesting Endangered Species Act protection for the monarch and its habitat, based largely on the long-term trends observed at overwintering sites. The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service initiated a status review of the monarch butterfly under the Endangered Species Act with a due date for information submission of 3 March 2015. The decision on whether to list the monarch is still pending, and a new deadline for completion of an internal FWS species status report is December 2020. The number of monarchs overwintering in Mexico has shown a long-term downward trend. Since 1995, coverage numbers have been as high as during the winter of 1996‚Äì1997, but on average about . Coverage declined to its lowest point to date () during the winter of 2013‚Äì2014, but rebounded to in 2015‚Äì2016. The average population of monarchs in 2016 was estimated at 200 million. Historically, on average there are 300 million monarchs. The 2016 increase was attributed to favorable breeding conditions in the summer of 2015. However, coverage declined by 27% to during the winter of 2016‚Äì2017. Some believe this was because of a storm that had occurred during March 2016 in the monarchs' previous overwintering season,(1) (2) (3) though this seems unlikely since most current research shows that the overwintering colony sizes do not predict the size of the next summer breeding population. A study in 2016 claimed that the long-term trend in the size of the overwintering sites is cause for concern. After a ten-fold drop in the overwintering numbers of the eastern monarch butterfly population over the last decade, this study claimed there was an 11%‚Äì57% probability that this population will go quasi-extinct over the next 20 years. According to Xerces Society, the monarch population in California decreased 86 percent in 2018, going from millions of butterflies to tens of thousands of butterflies. In Ontario, Canada, the monarch butterfly is listed as a species of special concern. In fall 2016, the Committee on the Status of Endangered Wildlife in Canada proposed that the monarch be listed as endangered in Canada, as opposed to its current listing as a \\"species of concern\\" in that country. This move, once enacted, would protect critical monarch habitat in Canada, such as major fall accumulation areas in southern Ontario, but it would also have implications for citizen scientists who work with monarchs, and for classroom activities. If the monarch were federally protected in Canada, these activities could be limited, or require federal permits. In Nova Scotia, the monarch is listed as endangered at the provincial level, as of 2017. This decision (as well as the Ontario decision) appears to be because of the presumption that the overwintering colony declines in Mexico translate into declines in the breeding range in Canada. Two recent studies have been conducted examining long-term trends in monarch abundance in Canada, using either butterfly atlas records or citizen science butterfly surveys, and neither shows evidence of a population decline in Canada.  Threats  There is increasing concern related to the ongoing decline of monarchs at their overwintering sites; based on a 2014 twenty-year comparison, the overwintering numbers west of the Rocky Mountains have dropped more than 50 percent since 1997 and the overwintering numbers east of the Rockies have declined by more than 90 percent since 1995. In February 2015, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service provided a statistic showing that nearly a billion monarchs have vanished from the overwintering sites since 1990. At that time, one of the main reasons cited was the herbicides used by farmers and homeowners on milkweed, a plant used as a food source, a home and a nursery by the monarchs. A 2016 study also attributed the last decade's ten-fold decline in overwintering numbers of the eastern monarch population to the loss of breeding habitat, namely the many species of milkweed (Asclepias species) that developing larvae require for food; however, scientists believe there are other factors as well. A number of researchers believe milkweed loss during the breeding season is the cause because declines in milkweed abundance are highly correlated with the adoption of herbicide-tolerant genetically modified corn and soybeans, which now constitute 89% and 94% of these crops, respectively, in the U.S. However, correlative evidence does not prove causation, and other possible causes of the overwintering declines have been proposed. A 2018 study has suggested that the decline in milkweed predates the arrival of GM crops. = Habitat loss due to herbicide use = A number of conservationists attribute the disappearance of milkweed species to agricultural practices in the Midwest, where genetically modified seeds are bred to resist herbicides that eliminate milkweed nearby. Growers eliminate milkweed that previously grew between the rows of food crops. Corn and soybeans are resistant to the effect of the herbicide glyphosate. The increased use of these crop strains is correlated with the decline in monarch populations between 1999 and 2010. Chip Taylor, director of Monarch Watch at the University of Kansas, said the Midwest milkweed habitat \\"is virtually gone\\" with 120‚Äì150 million acres lost.Wines, Michael (13 March 2013) Monarch Migration Plunges to Lowest Level in Decades. The New York Times To help fight this problem, Monarch Watch encourages the planting of \\"Monarch Waystations\\". The Natural Resources Defense Council filed a suit in 2015 against the EPA, in which it is argued that the agency ignored warnings about the dangers of glyphosate usage for monarchs. = Losses during migration = While herbicide-use has been proposed as one factor causing the decline in overwintering numbers of eastern monarchs, it is not the only possibility. Another is that the monarchs are experiencing problems reaching Mexico. This idea has been embraced by a number of leading monarch researchers, largely because of recent evidence showing that the number of breeding (adult) monarchs has not declined in the last two decades, based on long-term citizen science data. The lack of long-term declines in the numbers of breeding, and migratory monarchs, yet the clear declines in overwintering numbers, implies there is a disconnect between these life stages, that must be growing. One expert has proposed that a large and growing threat to migrating monarchs is mortality from car strikes. A study of road mortality in northern Mexico, published in 2019, showed very high mortality from just two \\"hotspots\\" each year, amounting to 200,000 monarchs killed. = Predators = While monarchs have a wide range of natural predators, none of these are suspected of causing harm to the overall population, or are the cause of the long-term declines in winter colony sizes. Larvae feed exclusively on milkweed and consume protective cardiac glycosides. Toxin levels in Asclepias species vary. Not all monarchs are unpalatable, but exhibit Batesian or automimics. Cardiac glycosides levels are higher in the abdomen and wings. Some predators can differentiate between these parts and consume the most palatable ones. Bird predators include brown thrashers, grackles, robins, cardinals, sparrows, scrub jays, pinyon jays, black-headed grosbeak, and orioles. Several species of birds have acquired methods that allow them to ingest monarchs without experiencing the ill effects associated with the cardiac glycosides. The oriole is able to eat the monarch through an exaptation of its feeding behavior that gives it the ability to identify cardenolides by taste and reject them. The grosbeak, on the other hand, has developed an insensitivity to secondary plant poisons that allows it to ingest monarchs without vomiting. As a result, orioles and grosbeaks will periodically have high levels of cardenolides in their bodies, and they will be forced to go on periods of reduced monarch consumption. This cycle effectively reduces potential predation of monarchs by 50 percent and indicates that monarch aposematism has a legitimate purpose. Some mice are able to withstand large doses of the toxin. Overwintering adults become less toxic over time making them more vulnerable to predators. In Mexico, about 14% of the overwintering monarchs are eaten by birds and mice. In North America, eggs and first-instar larvae of the monarch are eaten by larvae and adults of the introduced Asian lady beetle (Harmonia axyridis). The Chinese mantis (Tenodera sinensis) will consume the larvae once the gut is removed thus avoiding cardenolides. Wasps commonly consume larvae. One monarch researcher emphasizes that predation on eggs, larvae or adults is natural, since monarchs are part of the food chain, thus people should not take steps to kill predators of monarchs. On Oahu, a white morph of the monarch has emerged. This is because of the introduction, in 1965 and 1966, of two bulbul species, Pycnonotus cafer and Pycnonotus jocosus. They are now the most common insectivore birds, and probably the only ones preying on insects as large as the monarch. Monarchs in Hawaii are known to have low cardiac glycoside levels, but the birds may also be tolerant of the chemical. The two species hunt the larvae and some pupae from the branches and undersides of leaves in milkweed bushes. The bulbuls also eat resting and ovipositing adults, but rarely flying ones. Because of its color, the white morph has a higher survival rate than the orange one. This is either because of apostatic selection (i.e., the birds have learned the orange monarchs can be eaten), because of camouflage (the white morph matches the white pubescence of milkweed or the patches of light shining through foliage), or because the white morph does not fit the bird's search image of a typical monarch, so is thus avoided. = Parasites = Pteromalus cassotis on monarch chrysalis Parasites include the tachinid flies Sturmia convergens and Lespesia archippivora. Lesperia-parasitized butterfly larvae suspend, but die prior to pupation. The fly's maggot lowers itself to the ground, forms a brown puparium and then emerges as an adult. Monarch chrysalises are parasitized by pteromalid wasps, specifically Pteromalus cassotis. These wasps lay their eggs in the pupae while the chrysalis is still soft. Up to 400 adults emerge from the chrysalis after 14‚Äì20 days, killing the monarch. The bacterium Micrococcus flacidifex danai also infects larvae. Just before pupation, the larvae migrate to a horizontal surface and die a few hours later, attached only by one pair of prolegs, with the thorax and abdomen hanging limp. The body turns black shortly after. The bacterium Pseudomonas aeruginosa has no invasive powers, but causes secondary infections in weakened insects. It is a common cause of death in laboratory-reared insects. The protozoan Ophryocystis elektroscirrha is another parasite of the monarch. It infects the subcutaneous tissues and propagates by spores formed during the pupal stage. The spores are found over all of the body of infected butterflies, with the greatest number on the abdomen. These spores are passed, from female to caterpillar, when spores rub off during egg laying and are then ingested by caterpillars. Severely infected individuals are weak, unable to expand their wings, or unable to eclose, and have shortened lifespans, but parasite levels vary in populations. This is not the case in laboratory rearing, where after a few generations, all individuals can be infected. Infection with this parasite creates an effect known as culling whereby migrating monarchs that are infected are less likely to complete the migration. This results in overwintering populations with lower parasite loads. Owners of commercial butterfly breeding operations claim that they take steps to control this parasite in their practices, although this claim is doubted by many scientists who study monarchs. = Confusion of host plants = The black swallow-wort (Cynanchum louiseae) and pale swallow-wort (Cynanchum rossicum) plants are problematic for monarchs in North America. Monarchs lay their eggs on these relatives of native vining milkweed (Cynanchum laeve) because they produce stimuli similar to milkweed. Once the eggs hatch, the caterpillars are poisoned by the toxicity of this invasive plant from Europe.Invasive species alert: Black swallow-wort (Cynanchum louisea) and pale swallow-wort (Cynanchum rossicum). monarchjointventure.org] = Loss of overwintering habitat = The area of forest occupied has been declining and reached its lowest level in two decades in 2013. The decline is continuing but is expected to increase during the 2013‚Äì2014 season. Mexican environmental authorities continue to monitor illegal logging of the oyamel trees. The oyamel is a major species of evergreen on which the overwintering butterflies spend a significant time during their winter diapause, or suspended development.Paz, F√°tima (18 June 2014) En espera de aprobaci√≥n de la Profepa por tala ilegal en la Reserva de la Mariposa Monarca. cambiodemichoacan.com.mx A 2014 study acknowledged that while \\"the protection of overwintering habitat has no doubt gone a long way towards conserving monarchs that breed throughout eastern North America\\", their research indicates that habitat loss on breeding grounds in the United States is the main cause of both recent and projected population declines. = Climate = Climate variations during the fall and summer affect butterfly reproduction. Rainfall, and freezing temperatures affect milkweed growth. Omar Vidal, director general of WWF-Mexico, said \\"The monarch's lifecycle depends on the climatic conditions in the places where they breed. Eggs, larvae and pupae develop more quickly in milder conditions. Temperatures above 35¬∞C (95¬∞F) can be lethal for larvae, and eggs dry out in hot, arid conditions, causing a drastic decrease in hatch rate.\\"Monarch Population Hits Lowest Point in More Than 20 Years. WWF (29 January 2014) If a monarch's body temperatures is below 30¬∞C (86¬∞F) a monarch cannot fly. To warm up they will sit in the sun or rapidly shiver their wings to warm themselves. There is concern that climate change will dramatically affect the monarch migration. A study from 2015 examined the impact of warming temperatures on the breeding range of the monarch, and showed that in the next 50 years the monarch host plant will expand its range further north into Canada, and that the monarchs will follow this. While this will expand the breeding locations of the monarch, this will also have the effect of increasing the distance that monarchs must travel to reach their overwintering destination in Mexico, and this could result in greater mortality during the migration. Milkweeds grown at increased temperatures have been shown to contain higher cardenolide concentrations making the leaves too toxic for the monarch caterpillars, but these increased concentrations are likely in response to increased insect herbivory which is also caused by the increased temperatures, so it is unknown whether increased temperatures in isolation will make milkweed too toxic for monarch caterpillars. Additionally, milkweed grown at carbon dioxide levels of 760 parts per million (ppm) plants were found to produce a different mix of the toxic cardenolides, one that was less effective against monarch parasites.  Conservation efforts  Although numbers of breeding monarchs in eastern North America have apparently not decreased, reports of declining numbers of overwintering butterflies have inspired efforts to conserve the species. Because of concerns over the overwintering numbers, the Center for Biological Diversity, the Center for Food Safety, the Xerces Society and Lincoln Brower have filed a petition to the United States Department of the Interior to protect the monarch by having it federally protected. On 20 June 2014, President Barack Obama issued a presidential memorandum entitled \\"Creating a Federal Strategy to Promote the Health of Honey Bees and Other Pollinators\\". The memorandum established a Pollinator Health Task Force, to be co-chaired by the Secretary of Agriculture and the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency, and stated: > The number of migrating Monarch butterflies sank to the lowest recorded > population level in 2013‚Äì14, and there is an imminent risk of failed > migration. In May 2015, the Pollinator Health Task Force issued a \\"National Strategy to Promote the Health of Honey Bees and Other Pollinators\\". The strategy lays out current and planned federal actions to achieve three goals, two of which are: > ‚Ä¢ Monarch Butterflies: Increase the Eastern population of the monarch > butterfly to 225 million butterflies occupying an area of approximately 15 > acres (6 hectares) in the overwintering grounds in Mexico, through > domestic/international actions and public-private partnerships, by 2020. > ‚Ä¢ Pollinator Habitat Acreage: Restore or enhance 7 million acres of land for > pollinators over the next 5 years through Federal actions and public/private > partnerships. Many of the priority projects that the national strategy identifies will focus on the I-35 corridor extending for from Texas to Minnesota that provides spring and summer breeding habitats in the monarch's key migration corridor. There have been a number of national and local efforts underway to establish pollinator habitat along highways and roadways, although this effort is controversial. Conservationists are lobbying transportation departments and utilities to reduce their use of herbicides and specifically encourage milkweed to grow along roadways and power lines. Reducing roadside mowing and application of herbicides during the butterfly breeding season will encourage milkweed growth. Conservationists lobby agriculture companies to set aside areas that remain unsprayed to allow the butterflies to breed. This practice is controversial because of the high risk of butterfly mortality near roads, as several studies have shown that millions of monarchs and other butterflies are killed by cars every year. There is also evidence that monarch larvae living near roads experience physiological stress conditions, as evidenced by elevations in their heart rate. A 2020 resource from the Cooperative Research Programs of the Transportation Research Board developed products for roadway corridors to provide habitat for monarch butterflies and developed tools for roadside managers to optimize potential habitat for monarch butterflies in their road right-of-ways. =Butterfly gardening= While there are few scientific studies on the subject, the practice of butterfly gardening and creating \\"Monarch Waystations\\" is commonly thought to increase the populations of butterflies.(1) (2) (3) (4) (5) (6) . Efforts to increase monarch populations by establishing butterfly gardens and waystations require particular attention to the butterfly's food preferences and population cycles, as well to the conditions needed to propagate milkweed. For example, in the Washington, D.C. area and elsewhere in the northeastern United States, monarchs prefer to reproduce on common milkweed (Asclepias syriaca), especially when its foliage is soft and fresh. Because monarch reproduction in that area peaks in late summer when milkweed foliage is old and tough, A. syriaca needs to be cut back in June through August to assure that it will be regrowing rapidly when monarch reproduction reaches its peak.(1) . (2) . (3) . (4) . (5) . In addition, milkweed seed may need a period of cold treatment (cold stratification) before it will germinate.(1) . (2) . (3) . (4) . Although monarch caterpillars will feed on butterfly weed (Asclepias tuberosa) in butterfly gardens, the plant has rough leaves and is typically not a heavily used host plant. The plant is therefore less suitable for use in butterfly gardens and monarch waystations than are other milkweed species. . In addition, the plant's lack of cardiac glycosides may also make the plant unattractive to egg-laying monarchs.

It consists of lead vocalist Chris Taylor Brown, bassist Pete Charell, guitarist Brendan Hengle. They have recorded eight studio albums to date: Amalgamation (1999), Trapt (2002), Someone in Control (2005), Only Through the Pain (2008), No Apologies (2010), Reborn (2013), DNA (2016), and Shadow Work (2020). History =Formation and early years (1995‚Äì1999)= The members of Trapt met in middle school in the mid-'90s, and were in an early NOFX cover band with Manny Terres (guitar) and Aaron Azlant (lead vocals) called the Swinging Udders. Shortly thereafter, the band reformed and developed an act with Chris Taylor Brown (lead vocals), Simon Ormandy (guitar), Peter \\"Pete\\" Charell (bass), and David Stege (drums). The band's first few rehearsals were in Ormandy's guesthouse, which had a party-like atmosphere with its loft overlooking the living room. They began playing at local venues in 1997 before any members had graduated high school. In 1998, still before graduation, they were already opening for up-and-coming fellow acts like Papa Roach. They recorded and released their first CD, Amalgamation in 1999, which they sold at their live shows. Their second release, the Glimpse EP, came in 2000, and another EP, 2001's self-titled Trapt, served as the band's demo. =Amalgamation (1999‚Äì2000)= The debut independent release by Trapt, released in June 1999 and sold only in the Los Gatos, California area. =Trapt (2001‚Äì2003)= In 2001, the band signed with Warner Bros. Records and started recording their debut album, with Robin Diaz replacing Stege on the drums. On November 5, 2002 the band released their self-titled album, Trapt, which produced a total of three singles. =Someone in Control (2004‚Äì2006)= Before releasing their next full-length album, the band released a self-titled three-track EP, released March 30, 2004, that included live versions of the \\"Made of Glass\\" and \\"Echo\\" tracks from their debut album, as well as a previously unreleased non-LP track, \\"Promise\\". Their second full-length album, titled Someone in Control, was released September 13, 2005. It produced three singles for the band: \\"Stand Up\\", \\"Waiting\\", and \\"Disconnected (Out of Touch)\\". =Only Through the Pain (2007‚Äì2009)= Trapt vocalist Chris Taylor Brown live in 275px Their live album titled Trapt Live!, was released on September 18, 2007. The album featured two new studio songs (\\"Stay Alive\\" and \\"Everything to Lose\\") as well as live versions of nine songs from their earlier records. On March 7, 2008, it was announced that lead guitarist Simon Ormandy had parted ways with the band. He was replaced by Robb Torres. Despite rumors indicating otherwise, Ormandy's departure was amicable, and Chris Taylor Brown continues to speak highly of Ormandy to the media, while promoting Torres as the new guitarist. On March 8, 2008, Trapt released \\"Who's Going Home With You Tonight?\\" on the band's website, a song from their then- upcoming studio album entitled Only Through the Pain. The band also posted four other songs from the upcoming album: \\"Black Rose,\\" \\"Contagious,\\" \\"Wasteland,\\" and \\"Ready When You Are\\". On April 15, 2008, Trapt announced they would be touring as part of M√∂tley Cr√ºe's Cr√ºe Fest along with Buckcherry, Papa Roach and Sixx:A.M.. The tour began July 1, 2008 in West Palm Beach, Florida. On June 10, 2008, Trapt released \\"Who's Going Home with You Tonight?\\" as a single. They also recorded a music video for the song. =No Apologies (2010‚Äì2011)= In March 2010, Trapt said they were wrapping up the recording process of their new record with producer Johnny K. No Apologies was released on October 12, 2010. The first single, \\"Sound Off\\", was available on iTunes on July 20, 2010. Another song, \\"Stranger in the Mirror\\", was released for free from the band's Facebook page August 11, 2010. =DNA and Shadow Work (2014‚Äìpresent)= In 2014, Trapt re-released their early, out of print albums Amalgamation and Glimpse EP. and announced \\"The Self Titled Tour\\", a tour focused around their self-titled album. On June 15, Trapt announced their next studio album, DNA, and a collection of acoustic versions of songs called The Acoustic Collection. They also announced they would participate in the Make America Rock Again tour. The band's seventh studio album, DNA was released on August 19, 2016. It was the band's poorest charting album to date, debuting and peaking at number 148 on the Billboard 200 chart. Similarly, its three singles, \\"Passenger\\", \\"Human\\", and \\"It's Over\\", failed to crack the top 20 of the Mainstream Rock Songs chart, or chart at all on the Hot Rock Songs chart. In 2018, the band released the non-album single \\"Come Together\\", which did not chart on any Billboard song charts. In May 2020, a new studio album, Shadow Work, was announced. It released the following July, though it failed to chart in the top 200 of albums released in the US Billboard 200 chart in its release week, selling only 600 copies, an 87% drop from their prior studio album, DNA, in 2016. Musical style and influences Trapt's sound has been described as nu metal, post-grunge, alternative metal and hard rock. AllMusic critic MacKenzie Wilson thought that the band \\"draws influences from grunge and heavy metal\\" while \\"absorbing the heavy rock sounds of Korn, Soundgarden, and Metallica.\\" The band has cited Korn, Tool, Papa Roach, Pink Floyd, Pearl Jam and Genesis as influences. Social media use Many publications have taken note of the band's unusual use of social media accounts, run by Brown, often to lash out and attack others, something not often done from official band accounts. Music website Metal Sucks noted in 2015 that the band's official Facebook account made lengthy posts criticizing viewers of Keeping Up with the Kardashians, which devolved into the account swearing and berating commenters. The comment also included homophobic insults towards internet musician Rob Scallon, whom the band had feuded with on social media earlier in the year over the unauthorized and unattributed use of Scallon's videos. In 2017, Brown insulted commenters who disagreed with his defense of President Trump's dismissal of James Comey, and then again later in the year with anyone who disagreed with Brown's stance that institutional racism does not exist. In March 2020, Metal Injection, The A.V. Club, and Slate all reported that the band's Twitter account had gone on a week-long effort of arguing with and insulting people. It began with insults of civil rights activist and Bishop Talbert W. Swan II and accusations of having a \\"victim mentality\\". The comments then expanded into areas such as defending the Unite the Right rally, calling people \\"nerds\\", challenging the existence of white privilege in society, supporting Trump's \\"Chinese virus\\" rhetoric in reference to the COVID-19 pandemic, and fat-shaming women. Loudwire noted that many notable bands and musicians later responded to counter or ridicule the claims. Brown later used the band account to threaten legal action against an unflattering parody account assuming Trapt's identity, only to drop the issue on the same day once the account altered its Twitter handle to make the parody clearer. In May 2020, Brown threatened legal action against multiple Change.org petitions to keep the band's music off of the upcoming Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 1 + 2 re- release, even though the band's music never appeared on the originals nor was announced for the remaster. In the same month, Brown used the band's account to blame George Floyd for his own death. In August 2020, in response to an article by music publication Consequence of Sound that asserted that the band drew a small crowd size at a festival, the band took to Twitter to berate the publication and any fans who agreed with the story‚Äôs claim of poor attendance. The following month, the bands account was used to publicly berate Travis Livingston, an artist the band had commissioned, but not paid, for album artwork and lyric videos for their album release that year.

The Oregon Citizens Alliance went on to introduce a series of watered- down ballot measures along the same lines as Measure 9 (most of which failed). Another response of the OCA was to place laws similar to Measure 9 on local ballots in the parts of Oregon where a majority of voters had supported Measure 9. They succeeded in this effort in Josephine, Douglas, Linn, and Klamath counties, as well as in Canby and Junction City. The state legislature eventually overruled these local measures. On the other hand, opposition to Ballot Measure 9 formed the basis of much of the current gay rights movement in Oregon, including the organization Basic Rights Oregon.

It was one of the most important battles of the revolution, in which the Hungarian revolutionary army led by Lieutenant-General J√°nos M√≥ga defeated the troops of the Croatian Ban Josip Jelaƒçiƒá. Pretext =Austrian Empire's Hungarian policy in the summer of 1848= The European Revolutions of 1848 affected the Austrian Empire as well. Nationalist and liberal sentiment across the Empire turned into protest and sometimes violent insurrection, both in non-German areas and in Vienna. Amidst this turmoil, Charles Albert of Sardinia intervened in Austria's Italian possessions, beginning the First Italian War of Independence. The multi-national Habsburg Empire was composed of many ethnic groups seeking independence. This threatened the existence of the empire. The most dangerous revolutions were the Revolutions in Italy and the Hungarian Revolution. The Empire didn't have enough military power to overcome both of them. Their policy was to fight against the Italians and ‚Äì to gain some time ‚Äì to accept the Hungarian demands. This policy was effective: until the middle of summer the Empire stopped all other revolutionary attempts. Furthermore, Joseph Radetzky won the battle against Charles Albert at Custoza on 25 July 1848. The Habsburg Empire could then concentrate on the Hungarians. The Hungarian attempt to be independent of the Habsburg Empire started to become serious. The Emperor swore allegiance to the Constitution of Hungary: officially the Empire's army in Hungary was under the command of L√°z√°r M√©sz√°ros and most of the Austrian soldiers, including the Emperor, swore allegiance to its Constitution. The Batthy√°ny Government was very careful not to give an excuse to the Empire for attacking Hungary in this way. The Empire wanted to use the rebellions as an excuse to achieve their will. Ethnic groups who lived in Hungary made demands against the Hungarian government, but the Battyh√°ny Government refused them. The Empire realised their chance so they started to send money, weapons and materiel for Serbian rebels and Jelaƒçiƒá's army, who was prepared to invade Hungary. =Jelaƒçiƒá‚Äôs attack= Jelaƒçiƒá was violently opposed to the Hungarian revolution. This and his military experience helped him to get one of the main roles in Baillet von Latour's military plans against Hungary. On 10 June the Batthy√°ny Government sent a petition to the Emperor to relieve Jelaƒçiƒá of his post. Unfortunately it wasn't successful as Jelaƒçiƒá started to prepare attacking Hungary and on 31 August Jelaƒçiƒá occupied Fiume. Jelaƒçiƒá's attacks in the last quarter of 1848 The Hungarian government tried everything to avoid the conflict. Prime minister Lajos Batthy√°ny and Minister of Justice Ferenc De√°k travelled to the Austrian capital Vienna at the end of August. They wanted to negotiate with the Emperor, but it was a failure as the Emperor refused to entertain them. Furthermore, he confirmed Jelaƒçiƒá's title as Ban. This was taken as an advance warning by both sides. Batthy√°ny admitted his policy's failure and resigned on 11 September. On the same day Jelaƒçiƒá crossed the River Drava with approximately 30,000 men. After crossing the Drava, Jelaƒçiƒá issued a proclamation to the Hungarians. He made it clear that he arrived as the Habsburg-Lotharingia dynasty's soldier and his aim was to defeat the nascent revolution. Jelaƒçiƒá implied that his authority came from the Emperor, but when Hungarian officers arrived he could not prove it. √Åd√°m Teleky became the new commander of the Drava legion. Their situation was delicate. Their oath to the Constitution of Hungary meant they should attack Jelaƒçiƒá, but the fact that they feared the Emperor's army made them prefer not to fight. The Hungarian army instead retreated in the direction of Sz√©kesfeh√©rv√°r. Hungary's leaders frowned on the retreat of their army. They relieved Teleki of his post and they followed Batthy√°ny's advice and asked Archduke Stephen, Palatine of Hungary to command the Hungarian army. That an Austrian Archduke commanded the Hungarian army fortified the Hungarian soldiers, who declared an attack on Jelaƒçiƒá. Archduke Stephen invited Jelaƒçiƒá to a meeting at Balatonszemes, but Jelaƒçiƒá didn't attend. Archduke Stephen was superior in rank to Jelaƒçiƒá, so he interpreted Jelaƒçiƒá's failure to attend as a sign that he was acting as the Emperor's puppet. Later Stephen tried to contact Jelaƒçiƒá without success. On 22 September he left Hungary. The Hungarian Government tried to help and reinforce the Hungarian army as soon as they could. On 13 September Batthy√°ny announced an insurrection in Transdanubia. On 22 September Kossuth made a proclamation to the Hungarian soldiers, who were abroad, to return to their country. On 24 September he went to the Great Plain to recruit. These efforts were successful: there were about 16,000 men who were prepared to fight near Lake Velence at the end of the September. On 28 September the Hungarian army had a court martial at Sukor√≥. At this council M√≥ga promised that the Hungarian army would fight if Jelaƒçiƒá attacked them. It happened the next morning. Battle The Hungarian order of battle was arranged thus: * Captain Joseph Kollmann was in command * Right flank: General Joseph von Milp√∂kh and General Ern≈ë Kiss commanded about 3,000 men and 1 battery * Central and left flank: Major General Franz Holtsche and Lieutenant Colonel Mih√°ly R√©p√°ssy commanded 8,500 men and three quarter battery * Reserves General Teleki commanded 4,000 men and 2 batteries. Battle in the Pakozdi triangle The Emperor's policy failed, and caused Jelaƒçiƒá's defeat. The Emperor gave no direct orders, so the Austrian army split and went which way they chose. It caused the battle to be held between the two prongs of the divided Austrian army. Both sides expected to follow the Emperor's orders. Jelaƒçiƒá's plan was to destroy the right flank of the Hungarian army and then to move towards the central attack, and with a frontal attack he could then destroy the whole Hungarian army. Major general Kempen started to attack the Hungarians with about 8,000 men. After a short fight they made Guyon retreat from P√°tka, but the right flank of the Hungarian army defended themselves. Because this attack wasn't successful, Kempen tried a pincer movement against the right flank, but the Hungarians won this attack. Jelaƒçiƒá started to attack the centre and the left flank of the Hungarian army, but every attack ended with Hungarian victory. Jelaƒçiƒá gave up, under Kempen's advice. The artillery fought into the evening, but Jelaƒçiƒá started to retreat and asked for ceasefire. Aftermath Field Marshal Baron Josip Jelaƒçiƒá of Bu≈æim, Ban of the Kingdom of Croatia and Commander of the Croatian Military Frontier On the whole, the Hungarian army won the fight against Jelaƒçiƒá, but M√≥ga didn't turn the victory on his advantage. He retreated to Martonv√°s√°r and made a 3-day ceasefire with Jelaƒçiƒá. Jelaƒçiƒá's supply routes to Croatia were cut down, so he had to retreat to Vienna. On 7 October the Hungarian army defeated Jelaƒçiƒá's reserves, and took Generals Roth and Josip Filipoviƒá prisoner. Although the Battle of P√°kozd was one of the smaller of the Revolution, its consequences were very important for the other fights for independence. The battle became an icon for the Hungarian army because of it is influence on politics and morale. This battle was one of the reason for the Vienna Rebellion of 6 October. After the battle the blockaded Croatian armies were redirected towards Austria, where they were given new orders from the Austrian government, but no reinforcements as they were promised. In Hungary its anniversary (29 September) later became \\"National Defence Day\\" (). In 1991 that day was changed to 21 May (the date of the recapture of Buda at the Battle of Buda (1849)).

It is considered \\"roots music\\" because it served as the basis of music later developed in the United States, including rock and roll, rhythm and blues, and jazz. Early American folk music Most songs of the Colonial Fletch and Revolutionary period originated in England, Scotland and Ireland and were brought over by early settlers. \\"Barbara Allen\\" remains a popular traditional ballad originating in England and Scotland, which immigrants introduced to the United States.Raph, Theodore.

The familiar Streets of Laredo\\" (or \\"Cowboys Lament\\") derives from an Irish folk song of the late 18th century called \\"The Unfortunate Rake\\", which in turn appears to have descended from the even earlier \\"The Bard of Armagh\\". While \\"Streets of Laredo\\" uses the same melody as \\"The Unfortunate Rake\\", \\"St. James Infirmary Blues\\" adapts the story to a different tune. This illustrates how folk songs can change in the retelling and appear in a variety of versions. Railroad songs The \\"Ballad of John Henry (folklore)\\" is about an African-American folk hero said to have worked as a \\"steel-driving man\\". Roots music Many roots musicians do not consider themselves folk musicians. The main difference between the American folk music revival and American \\"roots music\\" is that roots music seems to cover a broader range, including blues and country. Roots music developed its most expressive and varied forms in the first three decades of the 20th century. The Great Depression and the Dust Bowl were extremely important in disseminating these musical styles to the rest of the country, as Delta blues masters, itinerant honky tonk singers, Cajun musicians spread to cities like Chicago, Los Angeles, and New York. The growth of the recording industry in the same period was also important; higher potential profits from music placed pressure on artists, songwriters, and label executives to replicate previous hit songs. This meant that musical fads, such as Hawaiian slack-key guitar, never died out completely, since a broad range of rhythms, instruments, and vocal stylings were incorporated into disparate popular genres. By the 1950s, forms of roots music had led to pop-oriented forms. Folk musicians like the Kingston Trio, blues-derived rock and roll and rockabilly, pop-gospel, doo wop and R&B; (later secularized further as soul music) and the Nashville sound in country music all modernized and expanded the musical palette of the country. The roots approach to music emphasizes the diversity of American musical traditions, the genealogy of creative lineages and communities, and the innovative contributions of musicians working in these traditions today. In recent years roots music has been the focus of popular media programs such as Garrison Keillor's public radio program, A Prairie Home Companion and the feature film by the same name. Regional forms American traditional music is also called roots music. Roots music is a broad category of music including bluegrass, country music, gospel, old time music, jug bands, Appalachian folk, blues, Cajun and Native American music. The music is considered American either because it is native to the United States or because it developed there, out of foreign origins, to such a degree that it struck musicologists as something distinctly new. It is considered \\"roots music\\" because it served as the basis of music later developed in the United States, including rock and roll, contemporary folk music, rhythm and blues, and jazz. =Appalachian music= Appalachian music is the traditional music of the region of Appalachia in the Eastern United States. It derives from various European and African influences‚Äîincluding English ballads, Irish and Scottish traditional music (especially fiddle music), hymns, and African-American blues. First recorded in the 1920s, Appalachian musicians were a key influence on the early development of Old-time music, country music, and bluegrass, and were an important part of the American folk music revival. Instruments typically used to perform Appalachian music include the banjo, American fiddle, fretted dulcimer, and guitar.Ted Olson, \\"Music ‚Äî Introduction\\". Encyclopedia of Appalachia (Knoxville, Tenn.: University of Tennessee Press, 2006), pp. 1109‚Äî1120. Early recorded Appalachian musicians include Fiddlin' John Carson, Henry Whitter, Bascom Lamar Lunsford, the Carter Family, Clarence Ashley, Frank Proffitt, and Dock Boggs, all of whom were initially recorded in the 1920s and 1930s. Several Appalachian musicians obtained renown during the folk revival of the 1950s and 1960s, including Jean Ritchie, Roscoe Holcomb, Ola Belle Reed, Lily May Ledford, and Doc Watson. The Carter Family was a traditional American folk music group that recorded between 1927 and 1956. Their music had a profound impact on bluegrass, country, Southern Gospel, pop and rock musicians. They were the first vocal group to become country music stars; a beginning of the divergence of country music from traditional folk music. Their recordings of such songs as \\"Wabash Cannonball\\" (1932), \\"Will the Circle Be Unbroken\\" (1935), \\"Wildwood Flower\\" (1928), and \\"Keep on the Sunny Side\\" (1928) made them country standards. Country and bluegrass artists such as Loretta Lynn, Roy Acuff, Dolly Parton, Earl Scruggs, Chet Atkins, and Don Reno were heavily influenced by traditional Appalachian music. Artists such as Bob Dylan, Jerry Garcia, and Bruce Springsteen have performed Appalachian songs or rewritten versions of Appalachian songs. =Cajun music= Cajun music, an emblematic music of Louisiana, is rooted in the ballads of the French-speaking Acadians of Canada. Cajun music is often mentioned in tandem with the Creole-based, Cajun-influenced zydeco form, both of Acadiana origin. These French Louisiana sounds have influenced American popular music for many decades, especially country music, and have influenced pop culture through mass media, such as television commercials. =Oklahoma and southern US plains= Singer-songwriter Woody Guthrie emerged from the dust bowl of Oklahoma and the Great Depression in the mid-20th Century, with lyrics that embraced his views on ecology, poverty, and unionization in the USA., paired with melody reflecting the many genres of American folk music. Before recorded history American Indians in this area used songs and instrumentation; music and dance remain the core of ceremonial and social activities. \\"Stomp dance\\" remains at its core, a \\"call and response\\" form; instrumentation is provided by rattles or shackles worn on the legs of women. \\"Other southeastern nations have their own complexes of sacred and social songs, including those for animal dances and friendship dances, and songs that accompany stickball games. Central to the music of the southern Plains Indians is the drum, which has been called the heartbeat of Plains Indian music. Most of that genre traces back to the hunting and warfare that was a strong part of plains culture. During the reservation period, they frequently used music to relieve boredom and despair. Neighbors gathered, exchanged and created songs and dances. This is a part of the roots of the modern intertribal powwow. Another common instrument is the courting flute. Shape-note or sacred harp singing developed in the early nineteenth century as a way for itinerant singing instructors to teach church songs in rural communities. They taught using song books that represented musical notation of tones by geometric shapes that associated a shape with a pitch. Sacred harp singing became popular in many Oklahoma rural communities, regardless of ethnicity. Later, the blues tradition developed, with roots in and parallels to sacred music. By the early 20th century, jazz developed, born from a \\"blend of ragtime, gospel, and blues\\" \\"Anglo-Scots- Irish music traditions gained a place in Oklahoma after the Land Run of 1889. Because of its size and portability, the fiddle was the core of early Oklahoma Anglo music, but other instruments such as the guitar, mandolin, banjo, and steel guitar were added later. Various Oklahoma music traditions trace their roots to the British Isles, including cowboy ballads, western swing, and contemporary country and western.\\" \\"Mexican immigrants began to reach Oklahoma in the 1870s, bringing beautiful canciones and corridos love songs, waltzes, and ballads along with them. Like American Indian communities, each rite of passage in Hispanic communities is accompanied by traditional music. The acoustic guitar, string bass, and violin provide the basic instrumentation for Mexican music, with maracas, flute, horns, or sometimes accordion filling out the sound.\\" Other Europeans (such as Bohemians and Germans) settled in the late nineteenth century. Their social activities centered on community halls, \\"where local musicians played polkas and waltzes on the accordion, piano, and brass instruments.\\" Later Asians contributed to the musical mix. \\"Ancient music and dance traditions from the temples and courts of China, India, and Indonesia are preserved in Asian communities throughout the state, and popular song genres are continually layered on to these classical music forms\\" =The American Southwest and South Texas= Tejano and New Mexico music, heard throughout the American Southwest and South Texas, is rooted in the musics of the Native American and Hispanic/Latino communities of the regions. Tejano music is also heavily influenced by Regional Mexican and Country music, while New Mexico music is much more influenced by Hispano folk and Western music. Both styles have influenced one another over the years, and incorporated American popular music styles. =Other forms= Folk composer and musician Robert Schmertz composed and wrote pieces related to historical events in Western Pennsylvania. 20th century folk revival music Starting in the mid-20th century a phenomenon termed the folk music revival began, forming a new contemporary type of folk music. It was somewhat centered on but not limited to the United States. While sometimes termed the American Folk Music Revival, it was somewhat international and does not fit some narrower definitions of American folk music even when the artists were American. Prominent artists from this movement include Pete Seeger, Woody Guthrie, The Weavers, Burl Ives, and others. A more commercially oriented version of folk music emerged in the 1960s, including performers such as The Kingston Trio, The Limeliters, The Brothers Four, Peter, Paul and Mary, Joan Baez, The Highwaymen, Judy Collins, The New Christy Minstrels, and Gordon Lightfoot, as well as counterculture and folk rock performers including Bob Dylan, The Byrds, Arlo Guthrie, and Buffy Sainte-Marie.

Leary published Polkabilly: How the Goose Island Ramblers Redefined American Folk Music, which proposes a redefinition of traditional American folk music and identifies a new genre of music from the Upper Midwest known as Polkabilly, which blends ethnic music, old-time country music, and polka.\\"Journal of American Folklore: Review\\", Retrieved 27 April 2013.

Film and TV Hootenanny, a weekly musical variety show broadcast on the ABC network in the U.S. in 1963-1964, primarily featured folk musicians. The soundtrack of the 2000 film O Brother, Where Art Thou? is exclusively roots music, performed by Alison Krauss, The Fairfield Four, Emmylou Harris, Norman Blake and others. In 2001, PBS broadcast a 4-part documentary series, American Roots Music, that explored the historical roots of American roots music through footage and performances by the creators of the movement. The 2003 film A Mighty Wind is a tribute to (and parody of) the folk-pop musicians of the early 1960s.

Goldberg's research focus is on the psychology of language, including theoretical and experimental aspects of grammar and its representation, acquisition of form-function correspondences, and syntactic priming. Her works aim to illuminate parallels between language and other cognitive processes. She is best known for her work on constructions: grammatical pairings of form and functions that are related to one another in a systematic network of learned knowledge; statistical preemption: the idea that competition between grammatical constructions in context can account for the ill-formedness of certain expressions that would otherwise be licensed; the creation and development of the novel construction-learning paradigm: which is akin to learning novel words with novel meanings; and the suggestion that both statistics (particularly in the form of skewed input) and the functions of constructions play an important role in learning. She argues that the functions of constructions often help demystify traditional linguistic puzzles such as island constraints, one-anaphora, and obligatory modifiers. With Francesca Citron, she investigates the neural processing of conventional metaphors and their physical and emotional correlates. Since 2004, she has been Professor of Psychology and Linguistics at Princeton University. From 1997 to 2004, she was Associate Professor of Linguistics at the Beckman Institute, University of Illinois at Urbana‚ÄìChampaign. From 1997 to 1998, she was Associate Professor of Linguistics and from 1992 to 1997 Assistant Professor of Linguistics at the University of California, San Diego. Personal Life In 1985, Goldberg received a B.A. in Mathematics and Philosophy from University of Pennsylvania. She received an M.A. in 1989 in linguistics, and in 1992 a PhD in linguistics, both from the University of California at Berkeley, studying with George Lakoff, Charles Fillmore, and Dan Slobin.

It can be fed to cattle, sheep and other such ruminants (cud-chewing animals). The fermentation and storage process is called ensilage, ensiling or silaging, and is usually made from grass crops, including maize, sorghum or other cereals, using the entire green plant (not just the grain). Silage can be made from many field crops, and special terms may be used depending on type: oatlage for oats, haylage for alfalfa (haylage may also refer to high dry matter silage made from hay). Silage underneath plastic sheeting is held down by scrap tires. Concrete beneath the silage prevents fermented juice from leaching outCattle eating silage Silage can be made by one or more of the following methods: placing cut green vegetation in a silo or pit; piling the vegetation in a large heap and compressing it down so as to purge as much oxygen as possible, then covering it with a plastic sheet; or by wrapping large round bales tightly in plastic film. Production MB Trac rolling a silage heap or \\"clamp\\" in Victoria, Australia The crops most often used for ensilage are the ordinary grasses, clovers, alfalfa, vetches, oats, rye and maize. Many crops have ensilaging potential, including potatoes and various weeds, notably spurrey such as Spergula arvensis. Silage must be made from plant material with a suitable moisture content: about 50% to 60% depending on the means of storage, the degree of compression, and the amount of water that will be lost in storage, but not exceeding 75%. Weather during harvest need not be as fair and dry as when harvesting for drying. For corn, harvest begins when the whole-plant moisture is at a suitable level, ideally a few days before it is ripe. For pasture-type crops, the grass is mown and allowed to wilt for a day or so until the moisture content drops to a suitable level. Ideally the crop is mowed when in full flower, and deposited in the silo on the day of its cutting. After harvesting, crops are shredded to pieces about long. The material is spread in uniform layers over the floor of the silo, and closely packed. When the silo is filled or the stack built, a layer of straw or some other dry porous substance may be spread over the surface. In the silo the pressure of the material, when chaffed, excludes air from all but the top layer; in the case of the stack extra pressure is applied by weights in order to prevent excessive heating. =Equipment= Forage harvesters collect and chop the plant material, and deposit it in trucks or wagons. These forage harvesters can be either tractor-drawn or self-propelled. Harvesters blow the chaff into the wagon through a chute at the rear or side of the machine. Chaff may also be emptied into a bagger, which puts the silage into a large plastic bag that is laid out on the ground. In North America, Australia, northwestern Europe, and New Zealand it is common for silage to be placed in large heaps on the ground, rolled by tractor to push out the air, then covered with plastic sheets that are held down by used tires or tire ring walls. In New Zealand and Northern Europe, 'bunkers' made of concrete or old wooden railway ties (sleepers) and built into the side of a bank are sometimes used. The chopped grass can then be dumped in at the top, to be drawn from the bottom in winter. This requires considerable effort to compress the stack in the silo to cure it properly. Again, the pit is covered with plastic sheet and weighed down with tires. In an alternative method, the cut vegetation is baled, making balage (North America) or silage bales (UK). The grass or other forage is cut and partly dried until it contains 30‚Äì40% moisture (much drier than bulk silage, but too damp to be stored as dry hay). It is then made into large bales which are wrapped tightly in plastic to exclude air. The plastic may wrap the whole of each cylindrical or cuboid bale, or be wrapped around only the curved sides of a cylindrical bale, leaving the ends uncovered. In this case, the bales are placed tightly end to end on the ground, making a long continuous \\"sausage\\" of silage, often at the side of a field. The wrapping may be performed by a bale wrapper, while the baled silage is handled using a bale handler or a front- loader, either impaling the bale on a flap, or by using a special grab. The flaps do not hole the bales. In the UK, baled silage is most often made in round bales about 4 feet by 4 feet, individually wrapped with four to six layers of \\"bale wrap plastic\\" (black, white or green 25-micrometre stretch film). The percentage of dry matter can vary from about 20% dry matter upwards. The continuous \\"sausage\\" referred to above is made with a special machine which wraps the bales as they are pushed through a rotating hoop which applies the bale wrap to the outside of the bales (round or square) in a continuous wrap. The machine places the bales on the ground after wrapping by moving forward slowly during the wrapping process. Haylage Haylage bales in Tyrol Haylage sometimes refers to high dry matter silage of around 40% to 60%, typically made from hay. Horse haylage is usually 60% to 70% dry matter, made in small bales or larger bales. Handling of wrapped bales is most often with some type of gripper that squeezes the plastic-covered bale between two metal parts to avoid puncturing the plastic. Simple fixed versions are available for round bales which are made of two shaped pipes or tubes spaced apart to slide under the sides of the bale, but when lifted will not let it slip through. Often used on the tractor rear three-point linkage, they incorporate a trip tipping mechanism which can flip the bales over on to the flat side/end for storage on the thickest plastic layers. Fermentation Top view of Silage Fermentation Silage undergoes anaerobic fermentation, which starts about 48 hours after the silo is filled, and converts sugars to acids. Fermentation is essentially complete after about two weeks. Before anaerobic fermentation starts, there is an aerobic phase in which the trapped oxygen is consumed. How closely the fodder is packed determines the nature of the resulting silage by regulating the chemical reactions that occur in the stack. When closely packed, the supply of oxygen is limited, and the attendant acid fermentation brings about decomposition of the carbohydrates present into acetic, butyric and lactic acids. This product is named sour silage. If, on the other hand, the fodder is unchaffed and loosely packed, or the silo is built gradually, oxidation proceeds more rapidly and the temperature rises; if the mass is compressed when the temperature is , the action ceases and sweet silage results. The nitrogenous ingredients of the fodder also change: in making sour silage as much as one-third of the albuminoids may be converted into amino and ammonium compounds; in making sweet silage a smaller proportion is changed, but they become less digestible. If the fermentation process is poorly managed, sour silage acquires an unpleasant odour due to excess production of ammonia or butyric acid (the latter is responsible for the smell of rancid butter). In the past, the fermentation was conducted by indigenous microorganisms, but, today, some bulk silage is inoculated with specific microorganisms to speed fermentation or improve the resulting silage. Silage inoculants contain one or more strains of lactic acid bacteria, and the most common is Lactobacillus plantarum. Other bacteria used include Lactobacillus buchneri, Enterococcus faecium and Pediococcus species. Ryegrasses have high sugars and respond to nitrogen fertiliser better than any other grass species. These two qualities have made ryegrass the most popular grass for silage making for the last sixty years. There are three ryegrasses in seed form and commonly used: Italian, Perennial and Hybrid. Pollution and waste The fermentation process of silo or pit silage releases liquid. Silo effluent is corrosive. It can also contaminate water sources unless collected and treated. The high nutrient content can lead to eutrophication (hypertrophication), the growth of bacterial or algal blooms. Plastic sheeting used for sealing pit or baled silage needs proper disposal, and some areas have recycling schemes for it. Traditionally, farms have burned silage plastics; however odor and smoke concerns have led certain communities to restrict that practice. Storing silage Silage must be firmly packed to minimize the oxygen content, or it will spoil. Silage goes through four major stages in a silo: *Presealing, which, after the first few days after filling a silo, enables some respiration and some dry matter (DM) loss, but stops *Fermentation, which occurs over a few weeks; pH drops; there is more DM loss, but hemicellulose is broken down; aerobic respiration stops *Infiltration, which enables some oxygen infiltration, allowing for limited microbial respiration; available carbohydrates (CHOs) are lost as heat and gas *Emptying, which exposes surface, causing additional loss; rate of loss increases. Safety Silos are potentially hazardous: deaths may occur in the process of filling and maintaining them, and several safety precautions are necessary.Keith Bolsen and Ruth E. Bolsen. Bunker silo, drive-over pile safety precautions can save lives. Progressive Dairyman. May 15, 2012. Retrieved April 26, 2019. There is a risk of injury by machinery or from falls. When a silo is filled, fine dust particles in the air can become explosive because of their large aggregate surface area. Also, fermentation presents respiratory hazards. The ensiling process produces \\"silo gas\\" during the early stages of the fermentation process. Silage gas contains nitric oxide (NO), which will react with oxygen (O2) in the air to form nitrogen dioxide (NO2), which is toxic. Lack of oxygen inside the silo can cause asphyxiation. Molds that grow when air reaches cured silage can cause organic dust toxic syndrome. Collapsing silage from large bunker silos has caused deaths. Silage itself poses no special danger. Nutrition Ensilage can be substituted for root crops. Bulk silage is commonly fed to dairy cattle, while baled silage tends to be used for beef cattle, sheep and horses. The advantages of silage as animal feed are several: *During fermentation, the silage bacteria act on the cellulose and carbohydrates in the forage to produce volatile fatty acids (VFAs), such as acetic, propionic, lactic, and butyric acids. By lowering pH, these create a hostile environment for competing bacteria that might cause spoilage. The VFAs thus act as natural preservatives, in the same way that the lactic acid in yogurt and cheese increases the preservability of what began as milk, or vinegar (dilute acetic acid) preserves pickled vegetables. This preservative action is particularly important during winter in temperate regions, when green forage is unavailable. *When silage is prepared under optimal conditions, the modest acidity also has the effect of improving palatability and provides a dietary contrast for the animal. (However, excessive production of acetic and butyric acids can reduce palatability: the mix of bacteria is ideally chosen so as to maximize lactic acid production.Heiman, Caley. The silage puzzle: Overcoming common challenges. The Progressive Dairyman.) *Several of the fermenting organisms produce vitamins: for example, lactobacillus species produce folic acid and vitamin B12. *The fermentation process that produces VFA also yields energy that the bacteria use: some of the energy is released as heat. Silage is thus modestly lower in caloric content than the original forage, in the same way that yogurt has modestly fewer calories than milk. However, this loss of energy is offset by the preservation characteristics and improved digestibility of silage. History Using the same technique as the process for making sauerkraut, green fodder was preserved for animals in parts of Germany since the start of the 19th century. This gained the attention of a French agriculturist, Auguste Goffart of Sologne, near Orl√©ans, who published a book in 1877 which described the experiences of preserving green crops in silos.Auguste Goffart, Manuel de la culture et de l'ensilage des ma√Øs et autres fourrages verts [Manual of the cultivation and siloing of maize and other green fodders] (Paris, France: G. Masson, 1877). Goffart's experience attracted considerable attention. The conditions of dairy farming in the USA suited the ensiling of green corn fodder, and was soon adopted by New England farmers. Francis Morris of Maryland prepared the first silage produced in America in 1876. [p. 2] The favourable results obtained in the U.S. led to the introduction of the system in the United Kingdom, where Thomas Kirby first introduced the process for British dairy herds.Obituary of Thomas Kirby, Bromley Record, 1901. The modern silage preserved with acid and by preventing contact with air was invented by a Finnish academic and professor of chemistry Artturi Ilmari Virtanen. Virtanen was awarded 1945 Nobel prize in chemistry \\"for his research and inventions in agricultural and nutrition chemistry, especially for his fodder preservation method\\", practically inventing modern silage. Early silos were made of stone or concrete either above or below ground, but it is recognized that air may be sufficiently excluded in a tightly pressed stack, though in this case a few inches of the fodder round the sides is generally useless owing to mildew. In the U.S. structures were typically constructed of wooden cylinders to 35 or 40 ft. in depth. In the early days of mechanized agriculture, stalks were cut and collected manually using a knife and horsedrawn wagon, and fed into a stationary machine called a \\"silo filler\\" that chopped the stalks and blew them up a narrow tube to the top of a tower silo. Anaerobic digestion Anaerobic digester Silage may be used for anaerobic digestion.  Fish silage  Fish silage is a method used for conserving by-products from fishing for later use as feed in fish farming. This way, the parts of the fish that are not used as human food such as fish guts/entrails, fish heads and trimmings are instead utilized as ingredients in feed pellets. The silage is performed by first grinding the remains and mixing it with formic acid, and then storing it in a tank. The acid helps with preservation as well as further dissolving the residues. Process plants for fish silage can either come in the form of tanks onboard ships or at land. During fish silage, workers should take caution to minimize the dangers of health, fire or explosion due to the use of formic acid.

Life She was born in Cleveland, Ohio, and grew up in Chicago, Illinois. She received her bachelor's degree in mathematics at the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor, and a master's degree in information science from the University of Chicago. She received her PhD in information science from the University of Chicago in 1973. She completed her dissertation, \\"Computer-Assisted Instruction: The Application of Theorem- proving to Adaptive Response Analysis,\\" while working as a research associate at Stanford University. She also served as a visiting researcher at Stanford University. Goldberg began working at PARC in 1973 as a laboratory and research assistant, and eventually became manager of the System Concepts Laboratory where she, Alan Kay, and others developed Smalltalk-80, which both developed the object-oriented approach of Simula 67 and introduced a programming environment of overlapping windows on graphic display screens. Not only was Smalltalk's innovative format simpler to use, it was also customizable and objects could be transferred among applications with minimal effort. Goldberg and Kay also were involved in the development of design templates, forerunners of the design patterns commonly used in software design.Chamond Liu, Smalltalk, Objects, and Design (San Jose, New York, and Shanghai: toExcel, 2000), 240 Along with Kay, she wrote the influential article \\"Personal Dynamic Media\\", which predicted a world where ordinary individuals would use notebook computers to exchange, modify, and redistribute personal media. This paper outlined the vision for the Dynabook. She was president of the Association for Computing Machinery (ACM) from 1984 to 1986, and, together with Alan Kay and Dan Ingalls, received the ACM Software Systems Award in 1987 and was also included in Forbes's \\"Twenty Who Matter\\". She also received PC Magazine's Lifetime Achievement Award in 1996. In 1994 she was inducted as a Fellow of the Association for Computing Machinery. Many of the concepts developed by Goldberg and her team at PARC became the basis for graphically based user interfaces, replacing the earlier command line based systems. According to Goldberg, Steve Jobs demanded a demonstration of the Smalltalk System, which she refused to give him. Her superiors eventually ordered her to, at which point she complied, satisfied that the decision to \\"give away the kitchen sink\\" to Jobs and his team was then their responsibility.Triumph of the Nerds, The Television Program Transcripts: Part III June 1996 Apple eventually used many of the ideas in the Alto and their implementations as the basis for their Apple Macintosh desktop environment. In 1988, Goldberg left PARC to co-found ParcPlace Systems, a company that created development tools for Smalltalk-based applications. She served as ParcPlace Systems's chairwoman and CEO until its 1995 merger with Digitalk. She cofounded, and is currently working at Neometron, Inc. an Internet support provider in 1999, of Palo Alto, California. She works at Bullitics. At the same time, she continues to pursue her interest in education, formulating computer science courses at community colleges in the United States and at schools abroad. In the same vein, she is a board member and adviser at Cognito Learning Media, a provider of multimedia software for science education.

He will next pile them for curing. Homesteading is a lifestyle of self- sufficiency. It is characterized by subsistence agriculture, home preservation of food, and may also involve the small scale production of textiles, clothing, and craftwork for household use or sale. Pursued in different ways around the world‚Äîand in different historical eras‚Äîhomesteading is generally differentiated from rural villages or commune living by isolation (either socially or physically) of the homestead. Use of the term in the United States dates back to the Homestead Act (1862) and before. In sub-Saharan Africa, particularly in nations formerly controlled by the British Empire, a homestead is the household compound for a single extended family. In the UK, the term 'smallholder' or 'crofts' is the rough equivalent of 'homesteader'. Modern homesteaders often use renewable energy options including solar electricity and wind power. Many also choose to plant and grow heirloom vegetables and to raise heritage livestock. Homesteading is not defined by where someone lives, such as the city or the country, but by the lifestyle choices they make. As historical governmental policy Historically, homesteading has been used by governmental entities (engaged in national expansion) to help populate and make habitable what were previously little-desired areas; especially in the United States, Canada, and Australia. Guided by legal homestead principles, many of these \\"homestead acts\\" were instituted in the 19th and 20th centuries in order to drive the populating of specific, national areas, with most being discontinued after a set time-frame or goal were achieved. Renewed interest in homesteading was brought about by U.S. President Franklin D. Roosevelt's program of Subsistence Homesteading in the 1930s and 1940s. As a social movement The attractiveness of back-to-the-land movements dates from the Roman era, and has been noted in Asian poetry and philosophy tracts as well (Agriculturalism). In the 1700s philosophy of physiocracy developed in France and by the 1800s and early 1900s the philosophy of Agrarianism had taken hold in many places around the world. The ideas of modern homesteading proponents, such as Ralph Borsodi, gained in popularity in the 1960s in the United States. Self-sufficiency movements in the 1990s and 2000s began to apply the concept to urban and suburban settings, known as urban homesteading. According to author John Seymour, \\"urban homesteading\\" incorporates small-scale, sustainable agriculture and homemaking. As economic choice In homesteading, social and government support systems are frequently eschewed in favor of self-reliance and relative deprivation, in order to maximize independence and self-determination. The degree of independence occurs along a spectrum, with many homesteaders creating foodstuffs or crafts to appeal to high-end niche markets in order to meet financial needs. Other homesteaders come to the lifestyle following successful careers which provide the funding for land, housing, taxes, and specialized equipment such as solar panels, farm equipment and electricity generators. Modern government regulation‚Äîin the form of building codes, food safety codes, zoning regulations, minimum wage and social security for occasional labor, and town council restrictions on landscaping and animal keeping‚Äîcan increase the marginal cost of home production of food in areas affected by these restrictions. Careful choice of homesteading location is essential for economic success. Many homesteaders express deep satisfaction with their standard of living and feel that their lifestyle is healthier and more rewarding than more conventional patterns of living.

An 1895 hydroelectric plant near Telluride, Colorado. Small hydro is the development of hydroelectric power on a scale suitable for local community and industry, or to contribute to distributed generation in a regional electricity grid. Precise definitions vary, but a \\"small hydro\\" project is less than 50 megawatts (MW), and can be further subdivide by scale into \\"mini\\" (<1MW), \\"micro\\" (<100 kW), \\"pico\\" (<10 kW). In contrast many hydroelectric projects are of enormous size, such as the generating plant at the Three Gorges Dam at 22,500 megawatts or the vast multiple projects of the Tennessee Valley Authority. Small hydro projects may be built in isolated areas that would be uneconomic to serve from a national electricity grid, or in areas where a national grid does not exist. Description The use of the term \\"small hydro\\" varies considerably around the world, the maximum limit is usually somewhere between 10 and 30 MW. While a minimum limit is not usually set, the US National Hydropower Association specifies a minimum limit of 5 MW.http://www.iea.org/publications/freepublications/publication/2012_Hydropower_Roadmap.pdf pg17 In California, hydroelectric generating stations with a maximum capacity of less than 30 MW are classified as small, and are eligible for inclusion in the state's renewable portfolio standard, while hydroelectric generating stations with a higher capacity are classified as large and are not considered renewable. The \\"small hydro\\" description may be stretched up to in the United States, Canada and China. In India, hydro projects up to 25 MW station capacities have been categorized as Small Hydro Power (SHP) projects.https://mnre.gov.in/small-hydro Small hydro can be further subdivided into mini hydro, usually defined as 100 to 1,000 kilowatts (kW), and micro hydro which is 5 to 100 kW. Micro hydro is usually the application of hydroelectric power sized for smaller communities, single families or small enterprise. The smallest installations are pico hydro, below 5 kW. Since small hydro projects usually have correspondingly small civil construction work and little or no reservoir, they are seen as having a relatively low environmental impact compared to large hydro. Growth According to a report by REN21, during 2008 small hydro installations grew by 28% over year 2005 to raise the total world small hydro capacity to 85 gigawatts (GW). Over 70% of this was in China (with 65 GW), followed by Japan (3.5 GW), the United States (3 GW) and India (2 GW).Renewables Global Status Report 2006 Update , REN21, published 2006, accessed 2007-05-16 Global growth is expected to be 2.8% annually until the mid-2020s when capacity will be about 150 gigawatts.http://www.digitaljournal.com/pr/3572050 China planned to electrify a further 10,000 villages between 2005 and 2010 under their China Village Electrification Program, including further investments in small hydro and photovoltaics. By 2010, China had 45,000 small hydro installations, especially in rural areas, producing 160 Twh annually.https://www.irena.org/DocumentDownloads/Publications/RE_Technologies_Cost_Analysis- HYDROPOWER.pdf pg12 Over 50% of the world's potential small hydro power was found in Asia; however, the report noted, \\"It is possible in the future that more small hydropower potential might be identified both on the African and American continents\\". In the mountains and rain forests of British Columbia, Canada there are a great many sites suitable for hydro development. However environmental concerns towards large reservoirs after the 1980s halted new dam construction. The solution to coping with increased demand was to offer contracts to independent power producers, who have built 100 run of the river projects under 50 MW. Power production without reservoirs varies dramatically, but older conventional dams retain or release water to average out production though the year. In 2014 these independent producers generated 18,000 GWh from 4,500 MW of capacity.  Generation  Historic Ottenbach Small Hydro with original equipment of 1920 in Ottenbach, Switzerland, still running for guided visits Hongping Power station, in Hongping Town, Shennongjia, has a design typical for small hydro stations in the western part of China's Hubei Province. Water comes from the mountain behind the station, through the black pipe seen in the photo Hydroelectric power is the generation of electric power from the movement of water. A hydroelectric facility requires a dependable flow of water and a reasonable height for the water to fall, called the head. In a typical installation, water is fed from a reservoir through a pipe into a turbine. The water flowing through the turbine causes an electrical generator to rotate, converting the motion into electrical energy. Small hydro may developed by constructing new facilities or through re-development of existing dams whose primary purpose is flood control, or irrigation. Old hydro sites may be re-developed, sometimes salvaging substantial investment in the installation such as penstock pipe and turbines, or just re-using the water rights associated with an abandoned site. Either of these cost saving advantages can make the return on investment for a small hydro site well worth the use of existing sites.  Project design  Many companies offer standardized turbine generator packages in the approximate size range of 200 kW to 10 MW. These \\"water to wire\\" packages simplify the planning and development of the site since one vendor looks after most of the equipment supply. Because non-recurring engineering costs are minimized and development cost is spread over multiple units, the cost of such package systems is reduced. While synchronous generators capable of isolated plant operation are often used, small hydro plants connected to an electrical grid system can use economical induction generators to further reduce installation cost and simplify control and operation. Small \\"run of the river\\" projects do not have a conventional dam with a reservoir, only a weir to form a headpond for diversion of inlet water to the turbine. Unused water simply flows over the weir and the headpond may only be capable of a single day's storage, not enough for dry summers or frozen winters when generation may come to a halt. A preferred scenario is to have the inlet in an existing lake. Modular ‚Äúmicro hydrokinetic‚Äù systems have been developed for irrigation canals. \\"Irrigation districts across the U.S. have installed power plants at diversion points and in-canal drops, which are traditionally used for flow measurement, to stabilize upstream heads and to dissipate energy where there is significant elevation change throughout the canal system.\\" Countries like India and China have policies in favor of small hydro, and the regulatory process allows for building dams and reservoirs. In North America and Europe the regulatory process is too long and expensive to consider having a dam and a reservoir for a small project. Small hydro projects usually have faster environmental and licensing procedures, and since the equipment is usually in serial production, standardized and simplified, and the civil works construction is also reduced, the projects may be developed very rapidly. The physically smaller size of equipment makes it easier to transport to remote areas without good road or rail access. One measure of decreased environmental impact with lakes and reservoirs depends on the balance between stream flow and power production. Reducing water diversions helps the river's ecosystem, but reduces the hydro system's return on Investment (ROI). The hydro system design must strike a balance to maintain both the health of the stream and the economics.

They are geographically close to one another and are linked by frequent bus service which operates between the campuses during the school year. The consortium was formally established in 1965, but its roots lay in cooperative efforts between the oldest four members of the consortium dating back to 1914. History In 1914, Massachusetts Agricultural College (now UMass), Amherst, Mount Holyoke, and Smith joined International YMCA College (now Springfield College) to form the Committee on University Extension of the Connecticut Valley Colleges, a joint continuing education program for the Pioneer Valley. In later years, Amherst, Mount Holyoke, Smith, and MAC‚Äîlater known as Massachusetts State and UMass‚Äîincreased their collaboration, culminating in the formation of an inter-library loaning program in 1951 and a joint astronomy department in 1959. Finally, in 1965, Amherst, Mount Holyoke, Smith and UMass incorporated the Four College Consortium, which became the Five College Consortium when Hampshire College was founded in 1968. The five colleges operate both as independent entities as well as mutually dependent institutions. The mission of the consortium is to support long-term forms of cooperation that benefit the faculty, staff and students of the five colleges. Shared academic and cultural resources are the primary initiative of the consortium. This means that students at each of these schools are permitted and encouraged to take classes at the other colleges (through \\"cross- registration\\") at no additional cost to the student. Student groups and organizations often draw participants from all five campuses and several academic programs are run by the Five Colleges (for example: astronomy, dance, some foreign languages, and women's studiesCommon Departments and Programs from Five Colleges, Inc.). The colleges also participate in an interlibrary loan program, allowing students, staff, and faculty to take advantage of all five campuses' collections. The Five College Radio Astronomy Observatory was founded in 1969 by the Five College Astronomy Department. Together, the Five Colleges operate WFCR (Five College Radio), an NPR member station operating at 88.5 MHz in the FM band. Bus Transportation The Pioneer Valley Transit Authority (PVTA) provides free daily intra-campus bus service to students, staff, and faculty during the school year. The buses, some of them run by University of Massachusetts Transportation Services and operated by student workers, run on a frequent schedule, allowing car-free travel to classes, social events, and local shopping areas. This service is funded primarily through a contract with the member institutions.

In 1899, Bourassa was outspoken against the British government's request for Canada to send a militia to fight for Britain in the Second Boer War. Prime Minister Sir Wilfrid Laurier's compromise was to send a volunteer force, but the seeds were sown for future conscription protests during the World Wars of the next half- century. Bourassa unsuccessfully challenged the proposal to build warships to help protect the empire. He led the opposition to conscription during World War I and argued that Canada's interests were not at stake. He opposed Catholic bishops who defended military support of Britain and its allies.Rolando Gomes, \\"Henri Bourassa et l'Imperialisme Britannique (1899-1918),\\" Bulletin d'Histoire Politique (2008) 16#3 pp 161-182. Bourassa was an ideological father of French-Canadian nationalism.Susan Mann, Dream of Nation: a Social and Intellectual History of Quebec (2nd ed. 2003) pp 169-75, 205-25 Bourassa was also a defining force in forging French Canada‚Äôs attitude to the Canadian Confederation of 1867. Early life Born in Montreal, Quebec, Canada, to Napol√©on Bourassa and Az√©lie Papineau (Bourassa), Henri Bourassa was a grandson of the pro-democracy reformist politician Louis-Joseph Papineau. He was educated at √âcole Polytechnique de Montr√©al and at Holy Cross College in Worcester, Massachusetts. In 1890, he became mayor of the town of Montebello, Quebec, at the age of 22. Political career In 1896, he was elected to the House of Commons as an independent Liberal for Labelle but resigned in 1899 to protest the sending of Canadian troops to the Second Boer War . He was re-elected soon after his resignation. He argued that Prime Minister Wilfrid Laurier was un vendu (\\"a sell-out\\") to British imperialism and its supporters in Canada. To counter what he perceived to be the evils of imperialism, he created in 1903 the Ligue nationaliste canadienne (Canadian Nationalist League) to instill a pan-Canadian nationalist spirit in the francophone population. It opposed political dependence on either Britain or the United States and supported instead Canadian autonomy within the British Empire. Bourassa left the federal parliament on May 11, 1907, but he remained active in Quebec politics by being elected to the Legislative Assembly of Quebec in the 1908 provincial election in Montr√©al division no. 2. He led the Ligue until he retired from the assembly on September 5, 1912. He continued to criticize Laurier, whose compromises mostly helped the British Empire. Bourassa opposed Laurier's attempts to build a Canadian navy in 1911, which he believed would draw Canada into future imperial wars between Britain and Germany. He supported the eventual creation of an independent navy but did not want it to be under British command, as Laurier had planned. Bourassa's attacks depleted Laurier's strength in Quebec and contributed to the Liberal Party's loss in the 1911 election. Bourassa's moves ironically aided the election of the Conservative Party, which held more staunchly imperialist policies than the Liberals. In 1910, while he was serving in the Provincial Assembly as the member for Saint-Hyacinthe, he founded the newspaper Le Devoir to promote the Nationalist League and served as its editor until 1932. Bourassa's main objective was to position Le Devoir outside the control of the established parties in Quebec and in Ottawa, which had authority over press organs devoted to their electoral interests and attempted to control public opinion by their partisan actions. Bourassa chose the name Le Devoir for his newspaper because of its emphasis of his commitment to integrity and justice and his desire to serve the public good. In 1913, Bourassa denounced the government of Ontario as \\"more Prussian than Prussia\\" during the Ontario Schools Question crisis (see Regulation 17) after Ontario had almost banned the use of French in its schools and made English its official language of instruction. He charged his compatriots to see their enemies inside Canada, in 1915: > \\"The enemies of the French language, of French civilization in Canada, are > not the Boches on the shores of the Spree; but the English-Canadian > anglicizers, the Orange intriguers, or Irish priests. Above all they are > French Canadians weakened and degraded by the conquest and three centuries > of colonial servitude. Let no mistake be made: if we let the Ontario > minority be crushed, it will soon be the turn of other French groups in > English Canada.\\" [in Wade, v 2 p. 671] World Wars Maxime Raymond, Andr√© Laurendeau and Henri Bourassa (right) in 1944 Bourassa led French-Canadian opposition to the participation in World War I, especially Robert Borden's plans to implement conscription in 1917. He agreed that the war was necessary for the survival of France and Britain but felt that only Canadians who volunteered for service should be sent to the battlefields of Europe. His opposition to conscription brought him the anglophone public's disfavour, as was expressed by the hostile crowd amassed in Ottawa that threw vegetables and eggs during his oration.Henri Bourassa, Fiery Politician, Dies, A1. The Globe and Mail, September 1, 1952. Three months after stating that he had nothing more to do with politics, he returned to the House of Commons in the 1925 election with his election as an Independent MP, and he remained until his defeat in the 1935 election. In the 1930s, Bourassa demanded for Canada keep its gates shut to Jewish immigrants, like other politicians of the time. Bourassa also opposed the draft during the conscription crisis of 1944 in World War II though less effectively, and he was a member of the Bloc populaire. His influence on Quebec's politics can still be seen in all major provincial parties. Death and legacy Upon his death in Outremont, Quebec in 1952 (one day shy of his 84th birthday), Henri Bourassa was interred in Montreal's Cimeti√®re Notre-Dame-des-Neiges. Henri Bourassa Boulevard, Henri-Bourassa metro station, and the federal riding of Bourassa, all in Montreal, are named for him. It is also the case for Henri- Bourassa Street, Henri-Bourassa park and the Regional County Municipality (RCM) of Papineau building, all of which are located in Papineauville, Qu√©bec. He is not related to Robert Bourassa, the former premier of Quebec. Bourassa's political thought, according to Michael C. Macmillan, was largely a combination of Whig liberalism, Catholic social thought, and traditional Quebec political thought. He was distinctly liberal in his anti-imperialism and general support for civil liberties for French Canadians, and his approach to economic questions was essentially Catholic. While Bourassa embraced the ultramontane idea that the Church was responsible for faith, morals, discipline, and administration, he resisted Church involvement in the political sphere and rejected the corporatism espoused by the Church. Bourassa opposed state intervention wherever possible and increasingly throughout his career emphasized the need for moral reform.MacMillan, Michael C., \\"The Character of Henri Bourassa's Political Philosophy\\", American Review of Canadian Studies, 1982b 12(1): 10-29. ISSN 0272-2011 According Levitt has shown, attitudes of historians, both Anglophone and Francophone, toward Bourassa consistently have been coloured by the position of each historian on the major issues Bourassa addressed. Goldwin Smith, a fellow anti-imperialist, introduced him into historical literature in 1902. The isolationism of the 1930s and the biculturalism of the 1960s (Bourassa, while a champion of Francophone rights, always opposed separatism) occasioned favourable treatment among Anglophones, while Lionel Groulx, his onetime foe, described him as \\"l'incomparable √âveilleur\\". Bourassa's position on social issues (Catholic, moderately reformist, emphasizing the family and agricultural values) likewise has called forth praise and blame.Levitt, Joseph. \\"Images of Bourassa\\", Journal of Canadian Studies, 1978, 13(1): 100‚Äì113.

In non-philosophical usage, the term was used to describe the ideal mental state for soldiers entering battle.Adrian Kuzminiski, Pyrrhonism: How the Ancient Greeks Reinvented Buddhism 2008 p2 Achieving ataraxia is a common goal for Pyrrhonism, Epicureanism, and Stoicism, but the role and value of ataraxia within each philosophy varies in accordance with their philosophical theories. The mental disturbances that prevent one from achieving ataraxia vary among the philosophies, and each philosophy has a different understanding as to how to achieve ataraxia. Pyrrhonism Ataraxia is the central aim of Pyrrhonist practice. Pyrrhonists view ataraxia as necessary for bringing about eudaimonia (happiness) for a person, representing life's ultimate purpose. The Pyrrhonist method for achieving ataraxia is through achieving epoch√© (i.e., suspension of judgment) regarding all matters of dogma (i.e., non-evident belief). The Pyrrhonist philosopher Sextus Empiricus summarized Pyrrhonism as \\"a disposition to oppose phenomena and noumena to one another in any way whatever, with the result that, owing to the equipollence among the things and statements thus opposed, we are brought first to epoch√© and then to ataraxia... Epoch√© is a state of the intellect on account of which we neither deny nor affirm anything. Ataraxia is an untroubled and tranquil condition of the soul.\\"Sextus Empiricus, \\"The Skeptic Way\\", Translated by Benson Mates, Book I, Chapter 4 Sextus gave this detailed account of ataraxia: > We always say that as regards belief (i.e., dogma) the Pyrrhonist's goal is > ataraxia, and that as regards things that are unavoidable it is having > moderate path√®. For when the Pyrrhonist set out to philosophize with the aim > of assessing his phantasiai ‚Äì that is, of determining which are true and > which are false so as to achieve ataraxia ‚Äì he landed in a controversy > between positions of equal strength, and, being unable to resolve it, he > suspended judgment. But while he was thus suspending judgment there followed > by chance the sought-after ataraxia as regards belief. For the person who > believes that something is by nature good or bad is constantly upset; when > he does not possess the things that seem to be good, he thinks he is being > tormented by things that are by nature bad, and he chases after the things > he supposes to be good; then, when he gets these, he fails into still more > torments because of irrational and immoderate exultation, and, fearing any > change, he does absolutely everything in order not to lose the things that > seem to him good. But the person who takes no position as to what is by > nature good or bad neither avoids nor pursues intensely. As a result, he > achieves ataraxia. Indeed, what happened to the Pyrrhonist is just like what > is told of Apelles the painter. For it is said that once upon a time, when > he was painting a horse and wished to depict the horse's froth, he failed so > completely that he gave up and threw his sponge at the picture ‚Äì the sponge > on which he used to wipe the paints from his brush ‚Äì and that in striking > the picture the sponge produced the desired effect. So, too, the Pyrrhonists > were hoping to achieve ataraxia by resolving the anomaly of phenomena and > noumena, and, being unable to do this, they suspended judgment. But then, by > chance as it were, when they were suspending judgment the ataraxia followed, > as a shadow follows the body. We do not suppose, of course, that the > Pyrrhonist is wholly untroubled, but we do say that he is troubled only by > things unavoidable. For we agree that sometimes he is cold and thirsty and > has various feelings like those. But even in such cases, whereas ordinary > people are affected by two circumstances ‚Äì namely by the path√© themselves > and not less by its seeming that these conditions are by nature bad ‚Äì the > Pyrrhonist, by eliminating the additional belief that all these things are > naturally bad, gets off more moderately here as well. Because of this we say > that as regards belief the Pyrrhonist's goal is ataraxia, but in regard to > things unavoidable it is having moderate path√©.Sextus Empiricus, \\"The > Skeptic Way\\", Translated by Benson Mates, Book I, Chapter 12 Epicureanism Ataraxia is a key component of the Epicurean conception of the highest good. Epicureans value ataraxia highly because of how they understand pleasure. Epicureans argue that pleasure is the highest good. They break pleasure down into two categories: the physical and the mental. They consider mental, not physical, pleasures to be greatest sort of pleasure because physical pleasures exist only in the present; whereas mental pleasures exist in the past, the present, and the future. Epicureans further separate pleasure into what they call kinetic and katastematic pleasures. Kinetic pleasures are those pleasures which come about through action or change. Such an action could be satisfying a desire or removing a pain, as that very sort of act is pleasurable in itself. Actions that feel good, even if not done to satisfy a desire or remove a pain, such as eating good-tasting food, also fall under the category of kinetic pleasures. Mental pleasures could also be kinetic in nature. Epicurus is said to have described joy as an example of a kinetic mental pleasure. Katastematic pleasure is pleasure which comes about from the absence of pain or distress. This sort of pleasure can be physical or mental. Physical katastematic pleasure comes in freedom from physical disturbances, such as simply being in the state of not being thirsty. Comparatively, mental katastematic pleasure comes in freedom from mental disturbance. Those who achieved freedom from physical disturbance were said to be in a state of aponia, while those who achieved freedom from mental disturbances were said to be in a state of ataraxia. Katastematic pleasures were regarded to be better than kinetic pleasures by Epicurus, believing that one could feel no more pleasure than the removal of all pain. Indeed, he is reported to have said: > The magnitude of pleasure reaches its limit in the removal of all pain. When > pleasure is present, so long as it is uninterrupted, there is no pain either > of body or of mind or of both together. Being both a mental and katastematic pleasure, ataraxia has a supreme importance in Epicurean ethics and is key to a person's happiness. In the Epicurean view, a person experiences the highest form of happiness should they ever be both in a state of aponia and ataraxia at the time. Stoicism Unlike in Pyrrhonism and Epicureanism, in Stoicism ataraxia is not the ultimate goal of life. Instead, a life of virtue according to nature is the goal of life. However, according to the Stoics, living virtuously in accordance with nature would lead to ataraxia as a byproduct. An important distinction to be made is the difference in Stoicism between ataraxia and the Stoic idea of apatheia. While closely related to ataraxia, the state of apatheia was the absence of unhealthy passions; a state attained by the ideal Stoic sage.Steven K. Strange, (2004), The Stoics on the Voluntariness of Passion in Stoicism: Traditions and Transformations, page 37. Cambridge University Press. This is not the same as ataraxia. Apatheia describes freedom from the disturbance of emotions, not tranquility of the mind. However, apatheia is integral for a Stoic sage to reach the stage of ataraxia. Since the Stoic sage does not care about matters outside of himself and is not susceptible to emotion because of his state of apatheia, the Stoic sage would be unable to be disturbed by anything at all, meaning that he was in a stage of mental tranquility and thus was in the state of ataraxia.

Hedone, also known as Voluptas in Roman mythology, is the daughter born from the union of the Greek gods Eros (Cupid) and Psyche in the realm of the immortals. She was associated more specifically with sensual pleasure. Her opposites were the Algos, personifications of pain. The term Hƒìdonƒì, which is a Greek word meaning pleasure, is used as a philosophical concept in ancient Greece. For instance, it played an important role in the Epicurean school. It is also the root of the English word \\"hedonism\\".  Aristotelian philosophy  Aristotle identified it as one of the two elements or components of pathe, with the other being lype or pain. The philosopher described pathe in these words: \\"Let the emotions be all those things on account of which people change their minds and differ in regard to their judgments, and upon which attend pain and pleasure.\\" Hƒìdonƒì, in Aristotelian ethics, is part of the philosopher's account of virtue and that pleasure (along with pain) is said to reveal a person's character. It is good if it is a consequence of a virtuous life as opposed to the position of some philosophers such as Aristippus, which holds that it is wholly good. For the concept to be good or true, it must conform to nature, reason, or virtue and that, although, hƒìdonƒì can harmonize with these three, Aristotle gave it less value. An example is the concept of proper pleasure or oikeia hedone, which has been discussed in Poetics and considered a process of restoration. Martin Heidegger's interpretation of Aristotelian philosophy explains that pleasure is a movement of the soul and that tranquility arises from it.  In Epicureanism  In the philosophy of Epicurus, hƒìdonƒì is described as a pleasure that may or may not derive from actions that are virtuous, whereas another form of pleasure, terpsis, is always virtuous. Another Epicurean reading, which distinguished hƒìdonƒì from terpsis, referred to it as a feeling of pleasure that is episodic and might or might not be beneficial. According to the Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy, Epicurus uses hƒìdonƒì in reference to only physical pleasures  Stoicism  The Stoics held a negative view of hƒìdonƒì, arguing that it is not in accordance with nature and reason. This can be understood within the philosophy's position that emotions are by definition excessive or are excessive impulses that exceed the measure of natural reason and ‚Äì as in other forms of excess ‚Äì leads to other evils of irrationality.

She is best known for her first work, the 1944 historical novel Forever Amber. The novel, racy for its time, became a runaway bestseller even as it drew criticism from some authorities for its depictions of sexuality. She wrote seven other novels, none of which matched the success of her debut. Early life Winsor was born October 16, 1919 in Olivia, Minnesota but raised in Berkeley, California. Her father was a real-estate dealer. At the age of 18, Winsor made a list of her goals for life. Among those was her hope to write a best-selling novel. Winsor graduated in 1938 from the University of California, Berkeley. During her school years, she married a fellow student, All-American college football player Robert Herwig. In 1937, she began writing a thrice-weekly sports column for the Oakland Tribune. Although that job only lasted a year, Winsor remained at the newspaper, working as a receptionist. She was fired in 1938 when the newspaper chose to trim its workforce. Career =Forever Amber= Winsor became interested in the Restoration period through her husband. Herwig was writing a paper for school on Charles II, and, out of boredom, Winsor read one of his research books. Her husband joined the military at the outbreak of World War II and spent five years with the United States Marines fighting in the Pacific theatre. During that time, Winsor studied the Restoration period, claiming to have read 356 books on the subject. She began writing a novel based on her research. Her fifth draft of the novel was accepted for publication. The publishers promptly edited the book down to one-fifth of its original size. The resulting novel, Forever Amber, was 972 pages long. The novel took readers on a frolic through Restoration England and offered vivid images of fashion, politics, affairs and public disasters of the time, including the plague and the Great Fire of London. The book appeared in 1944. It attracted criticism for its blatant sexual references. Fourteen U.S. states banned it as pornography and the Hays Office also condemned it, but within a month the movie rights had been purchased by Twentieth Century Fox. The film, directed by Otto Preminger and starring Linda Darnell and Cornel Wilde, was released in 1947. Despite being banned, Forever Amber became one of the bestselling American novels of the 1940s.The Robe by Lloyd Douglas actually spent twice as long on the best seller list. The Robe had sold 3,724,391 copies by 1967 (source) and Forever Amber had sold 2,925,268 copies by 1977 (source) Another bestseller from the 1940s, A Tree Grows in Brooklyn, had sold 2,487,740 copies by 1975 (source). It sold over 100,000 copies in its first week of release, and went on to sell over three million copies. =Later career= Made a celebrity by the success of her novel, Winsor found it unthinkable to return to the married life she had known with Herwig and, in 1946, they divorced. Ten days later, she became the sixth wife of the big-band leader and clarinetist Artie Shaw, despite the fact that two years previously Shaw had castigated his then-wife, Ava Gardner, for reading such a \\"trashy novel\\" as Forever Amber. The marriage to Shaw ended in 1948, and Winsor soon married her divorce attorney, Arnold Krakower. That marriage likewise ended in divorce, in 1953. In 1956 Winsor married for the fourth time, to Paul A. Porter, a former head of the Federal Communications Commission. They remained married until Porter's death in 1975. Winsor's next commercially successful novel, Star Money, appeared in 1950, and was a portrait closely drawn from her experience of becoming a bestselling author. But in five subsequent novels, the last appearing in 1986 ‚Äì The Lovers, Calais, Robert and Arabella, Jacintha, and Wanderers Eastward, Wanderers West ‚Äì she failed to make as much of an impact. In 2000 a new edition of Forever Amber was published with a foreword by Barbara Taylor Bradford.  Death  Winsor died May 26, 2003 in New York City.

He is best known for writing the famous war memorial poem \\"In Flanders Fields\\". McCrae died of pneumonia near the end of the war. Biography McCrae was born in McCrae House in Guelph, Ontario to Lieutenant-Colonel David McCrae and Janet Simpson Eckford; he was the grandson of Scottish immigrants from Balmaghie, Kirkcudbrightshire. His brother, Dr. Thomas McCrae, became professor of medicine at Johns Hopkins Medical School in Baltimore and close associate of Sir William Osler. His sister Geills married James F. Kilgour, a justice of the Court of King‚Äôs Bench, and moved to Winnipeg. Birthplace of John McCrae Sign at McCrae House McCrae attended the Guelph Collegiate Vocational Institute but he took a year off his studies due to recurring problems with asthma. Among his papers in the John McCrae House in Guelph is a letter he wrote on July 18, 1893, to Laura Kains while he trained as an artilleryman at T√™te-de-Pont barracks, today‚Äôs Fort Frontenac, in Kingston, Ontario. \\"I have a manservant ... Quite a nobby place it is, in fact ... My windows look right out across the bay, and are just near the water's edge; there is a good deal of shipping at present in the port; and the river looks very pretty.\\" He was a resident master in English and Mathematics in 1894 at the Ontario Agricultural College in Guelph.Peddie McCrae returned to the University of Toronto and completed his B.A., then returned again to study medicine on a scholarship. John McCrae in 1912 At medical school, McCrae tutored other students to help pay his tuition. Two of his students were among the first female doctors in Ontario. McCrae graduated in 1898. He was first a resident house-officer at Toronto General Hospital, then in 1899 at Johns Hopkins Hospital in Baltimore, Maryland.A Cyclopedia of American Medical Biography, p. 733. Howard Atwood Kelley. 1920. In 1900 McCrae served in South Africa as a lieutenant in the Canadian Field Artillery during the Second Boer War (1899 to 1902), and upon his return was appointed professor of pathology at the University of Vermont, where he taught until 1911; he also taught at McGill University in Montreal, Quebec. In 1902, he was appointed resident pathologist at Montreal General Hospital and later became assistant pathologist to the Royal Victoria Hospital in Montreal, Quebec. In 1904, he was appointed an associate in medicine at the Royal Victoria Hospital. Later that year, he went to England where he studied for several months and became a member of the Royal College of Physicians. In 1905, McCrae set up his own practice although he continued to work and lecture at several hospitals. The same year, he was appointed pathologist to the Montreal Foundling and Baby Hospital. In 1908, he was appointed physician to the Alexandra Hospital for Contagious Diseases. In 1910, he accompanied Lord Grey, the Governor General of Canada, on a canoe trip to Hudson Bay to serve as expedition physician. McCrae was the co-author, with J.G. Adami, of a medical textbook, A Text-Book of Pathology for Students of Medicine (1912; 2nd ed., 1914). World War I McCrae's funeral When Britain declared war on Germany because of the latter‚Äôs invasion of neutral Belgium at the beginning of World War I (1914), Canada, as a Dominion within the British Empire, was at war as well. McCrae was appointed as Medical Officer and Major of the 1st Brigade CFA (Canadian Field Artillery).. He treated the wounded during the Second Battle of Ypres in 1915, from a hastily dug, 8 foot by 8 foot bunker dug in the back of the dyke along the Yser Canal about 2 miles north of Ypres.Bonfire ‚Äì The Chestnut Gentleman by Susan Raby-Dunne, 2012 McCrae's friend and former militia pal, Lt. Alexis Helmer, was killed in the battle, and his burial inspired the poem, \\"In Flanders Fields\\", which was written on May 3, 1915 and first published in the magazine Punch. From June 1, 1915, McCrae was ordered away from the artillery to set up No. 3 Canadian General Hospital at Dannes-Camiers near Boulogne-sur- Mer, northern France. C.L.C. Allinson reported that McCrae \\"most unmilitarily told [me] what he thought of being transferred to the medicals and being pulled away from his beloved guns. His last words to me were: 'Allinson, all the goddamn doctors in the world will not win this bloody war: what we need is more and more fighting men.'\\"Prescott, p. 99 \\"In Flanders Fields\\" appeared anonymously in Punch on December 8, 1915, but in the index to that year McCrae was named as the author. The verses swiftly became one of the most popular poems of the war, used in countless fund-raising campaigns and frequently translated (a Latin version begins In agro belgico...). \\"In Flanders Fields\\" was also extensively printed in the United States, whose government was contemplating joining the war, alongside a 'reply' by R. W. Lillard, (\\"...Fear not that you have died for naught, / The torch ye threw to us we caught...\\"). McCrae's grave at Wimereux cemetery For eight months the hospital operated in Durbar tents (donated by the Begum of Bhopal and shipped from India), but after suffering from storms, floods, and frosts it was moved in February 1916 into the old Jesuit College in Boulogne-sur-Mer. McCrae, now \\"a household name, albeit a frequently misspelt one\\",Prescott, p. 106. regarded his sudden fame with some amusement, wishing that \\"they would get to printing 'In F.F.' correctly: it never is nowadays\\"; but (writes his biographer) \\"he was satisfied if the poem enabled men to see where their duty lay.\\"Prescott, p. 107. On January 28, 1918, while still commanding No. 3 Canadian General Hospital (McGill) at Boulogne, McCrae died of pneumonia with \\"extensive pneumococcus meningitis\\"Holt, pp. 54‚Äì62 at the British General Hospital in Wimereux, France. He was buried the following day in the Commonwealth War Graves Commission section of Wimereux Cemetery,CWGC: John McCrae just a couple of kilometres up the coast from Boulogne, with full military honours.Busch, p. 75; Holt, p. 62. Prescott, p. 129. His flag-draped coffin was borne on a gun carriage and the mourners ‚Äì who included Sir Arthur Currie and many of McCrae's friends and staff ‚Äì were preceded by McCrae's charger, \\"Bonfire\\", with McCrae's boots reversed in the stirrups. Bonfire was with McCrae from Valcartier, Quebec until his death and was much loved. McCrae's gravestone is placed flat, as are all the others in the section, because of the unstable sandy soil.Busch, p. 75. \\"In Flanders Fields\\" John McCrae Memorial Site, Boezinge, Ypres, West Flanders, Belgium A collection of his poetry, In Flanders Fields and Other Poems (1918), was published after his death. \\"In Flanders Fields\\" In Flanders fields the poppies blow Between the crosses, row on row, That mark our place; and in the sky The larks, still bravely singing, fly Scarce heard amid the guns below. We are the dead, short days ago We lived, felt dawn, saw sunset glow, Loved and were loved, and now we lie In Flanders fields. Take up our quarrel with the foe: To you from failing hands we throw The torch; be yours to hold it high. If ye break faith with us who die We shall not sleep, though poppies grow In Flanders fields. ‚ÄìJohn McCrae Though various legends have developed as to the inspiration for the poem, the most commonly held belief is that McCrae wrote \\"In Flanders Fields\\" on May 3, 1915, the day after presiding over the funeral and burial of his friend Lieutenant Alexis Helmer, who had been killed during the Second Battle of Ypres. The poem was written as he sat upon the back of a medical field ambulance near an advance dressing post at Essex Farm, just north of Ypres. The poppy, which was a central feature of the poem, grew in great numbers in the spoiled earth of the battlefields and cemeteries of Flanders. An article by Veteran's Administration Canada provides this account: > The day before he wrote his famous poem, one of McCrae's closest friends was > killed in the fighting and buried in a makeshift grave with a simple wooden > cross. Wild poppies were already beginning to bloom between the crosses > marking the many graves. The Canadian government has placed a memorial to John McCrae that features \\"In Flanders Fields\\" at the site of the dressing station which sits beside the Commonwealth War Graves Commission's Essex Farm Cemetery.

It was made into a film in 1947 by 20th Century Fox. Forever Amber tells the story of an orphaned Amber St. Clare, who makes her way up through the ranks of 17th-century English society by sleeping with or marrying successively richer and more important men while keeping her love for the one man she can never have. The subplot of the novel follows Charles II of England as he returns from exile and adjusts to ruling England. The novel includes portrayals of Restoration fashion, including the introduction and popularization of tea in English coffeehouses and the homes of the fashionably rich; politics; and public disasters, including the plague and the Great Fire of London. Many notable historical figures appear in the book, including Charles II of England, members of his court, and several of his mistresses including Nell Gwyn. Winsor's inspiration for the book came from her first husband, who had written his undergraduate thesis on Charles II, completed while he was serving in the army. She read books on the period and wrote numerous drafts of what would become Forever Amber. Plot Judith Marsh has been engaged since birth to her neighbor, John Mainwaring, heir to the Earl of Rosswood. In 1644, she has her engagement broken off when her family and the Mainwarings find themselves on opposing sides of the English Civil War. During a break in the fighting, John visits Judith and the two consummate their relationship. Pregnant, Judith abandons her family and goes to Parliamentarian territory on John's instructions, introducing herself as Judith St. Clare. There, she ends up staying with farmer Matthew Goodegroome and his wife Sarah. Judith dies in childbirth after naming her daughter Amber (after the color of John's eyes). In 1660, Amber, now a flirtatious teenager, is being raised by the Goodegroomes in ignorance of her origins. She meets a band of Royalists who inform her that Charles II of England is returning. Amber is particularly attracted to Lord Bruce Carlton. During a fair, she lures him into the woods and loses her virginity to him. After persuading him, Carlton reluctantly takes her to London, but tells Amber he will not marry her and she will come to regret her choice. In London, Carlton makes Amber his mistress. She quickly grows accustomed to their luxurious lifestyle. She longs to marry Carlton and believes becoming pregnant will make him marry her. However, when she does become pregnant, Carlton announces plans to become a privateer. He leaves Amber a significant amount of money and tells her if she is clever she can legitimize herself and her child by marrying well. Left alone, Amber is befriended by a woman named Sally Goodman and passes herself off as a rich country heiress. Sally introduces Amber to her nephew Luke Channell, who Amber quickly marries out of fear that her pregnancy will soon be visible. She soon discovers Sally and Luke are not who they appear. When they realize she is not as wealthy as she claimed they abandon her, leaving her penniless. Amber is pursued by creditors and taken to a debtors' prison. Salvation comes when she catches the eye of Black Jack Mallard, a highwayman who takes Amber with him when he escapes. BlackJack takes Amber to Whitefriars, where she is introduced to the ways of criminals and gives birth to a son who she gives to a countrywoman to raise properly. BlackJack hires a student of noble birth, Michael Godfrey, to educate Amber, and begins to use her as bait in schemes where she lures handsome, rich men to quiet corners before Black Jack robs them. Amber attracts the attention of Bess, Black Jack's former lover, whose jealous behavior towards Amber results in Bess being kicked out. Bess avenges herself by turning in Black Jack and his conspirators. Amber manages to escape and happens upon Michael, who offers her his protection. She becomes his mistress. Terrified that her debts will one day catch up with her, Amber learns that actors are protected from arrest (through being servants of the King) and uses her connections to find a position with the King's Company. Though she is not a great actress, Amber uses her beauty to earn larger parts, hoping to attract the attention of a man who can afford to keep her as his mistress. She catches the eye of Captain Rex Morgan, the paramour of fellow actress Beck Marshall, and succeeds in persuading him to pay to keep her. Morgan falls in love with Amber and offers to marry her, but she resists, wanting a wealthier husband. Amber eventually attracts the attention of the King and sleeps with him twice before his mistress, Barbara Palmer, intervenes. Depressed, Amber decides to marry Rex, but Bruce returns from his travels, and Amber realizes she is still in love with him. This leads to a duel between Bruce and Rex, resulting in Rex dying and Bruce leaving once more. Now bereft Amber falls deeper into prostitution. Shunned and unwell following an abortion, she flees to Tunbridge Wells where she meets a rich elderly widower, Samuel Dangerfield, and seduces him into marriage by pretending to be a modest young widow. Dangerfield's puritanical family is horrified, though she becomes friends with his daughter Jemima, who is only a few years younger than herself. Amber discovers her new husband is financing Bruce, and re-starts her affair with him, hoping to conceive a child she can pass off as her husband's. Amber becomes pregnant then discovers her stepdaughter is also pregnant by Bruce, who abandons both of them. Amber finds a suitable husband for Jemima and is left extremely wealthy after Samuel dies. Shortly after their child is born Bruce returns, and both he and Amber contract plague. They both survive but Bruce abandons her again, and Amber decides to marry for a third time, to the avaricious but influential Earl of Radclyffe. Now a countess, Amber intends to go to court and become the King's favored mistress, replacing Barbara Palmer. Her husband interferes in these plans and forces her to move to the country. As revenge, Amber seduces her new husband's son and is discovered. Her husband attempts to poison the pair, succeeding in killing his son. The Earl then flees to London, where Amber has him killed (using the Great Fire of London to cover up the crime). Finally free, she becomes the King's mistress and becomes pregnant by him. The King arranges a marriage - Amber's fourth - to Gerald Stanhope. Bruce returns, and Amber continues cheating on her husband with both the King and Bruce. Bruce reveals that he is married and intends to make their son his lawful heir, to which Amber reluctantly consents, knowing it will secure his future. Amber becomes the King's primary and official mistress, and he makes her Duchess of Ravenspur. As Amber is at the height of her power and influence, Bruce returns once again and resumes his affair with Amber. Bruce's wife Corinna discovers the affair and Bruce finally leaves Amber for good. Amber confronts Corinna, revealing that she is the mother of Bruce's son, and the two women violently fight. Unbeknownst to Amber, the Duke of Buckingham (one of the influential men to which Amber prostituted herself) decides Amber is a threat and makes a plan with a former enemy Lord Arlington, to get rid of her. The two men write Amber a note claiming Corinna has died. A hopeful Amber leaves England in pursuit of Bruce, hoping he will finally marry her, unaware that Corinna is alive and well. Characters =Original characters= *Amber St. Clare - The illegitimate daughter of two nobles who is raised by well-off farmers ignorant of her origins.

Small of stature and very modest due to her Catholic upbringing, she is devoted to her husband and puts up with his affairs. He remains loyal to her as well, despite her inability to produce an heir. Publication After five drafts, Forever Amber was accepted for publication. After editing, the two and a half million-word manuscript was reduced to a fifth of its original size. The published novel was 972 pages long. A condensed version was published as an Armed Services Edition during WWII. Critical reception While many reviewers \\"praised the story for its relevance, comparing Amber's fortitude during the plague and fire to that of the women who held hearth and home together through the blitzes of World War II\\", others condemned it for its blatant sexual references. Fourteen US states banned the book as pornography. The first was Massachusetts, whose attorney general cited 70 references to sexual intercourse, 39 illegitimate pregnancies, 7 abortions, and \\"10 descriptions of women undressing in front of men\\" as reasons for banning the novel. Winsor denied that her book was particularly daring and said that she had no interest in explicit scenes. \\"I wrote only two sexy passages,\\" she remarked, \\"and my publishers took both of them out. They put in ellipses instead. In those days, you know, you could solve everything with an ellipsis.\\" Despite its banning, Forever Amber was the best-selling US novel of the 1940s. It sold over 100,000 copies in its first week of release, and went on to sell over three million copies. Forever Amber was also responsible for popularizing \\"Amber\\" as a given name for girls in the 20th century. The book was condemned by the Catholic Church for indecency, which helped its popularity. One critic went so far as to number each of the passages to which he objected. A film adaptation by 20th Century Fox was finally completed after substantial changes to the script were made, toning down some of the book's most objectionable passages in order to appease Catholic media critics. The book was banned in August 1945 in Australia. The Minister for Customs, Senator Richard Keane, said \\"The Almighty did not give people eyes to read that rubbish.\\" http://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/cgi- bin/paperspast?a=d&cl;=search&d;=EP19450808.2.102&srpos;=1&e;=-------10--1---- 0%22Forever+Amber%22+%22Kathleen+Winsor%22-- Cultural references * Amber St. Clair appears as a historical character in The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen as a member of the first incarnation of the League in the 17th century, Prospero's Men. * In the 1946 film Somewhere in the Night, Lloyd Nolan's Detective Kendall says of the main villain's eventual confession to several crimes: \\"It'll make better reading than Forever Amber!\\" * In the tenth episode of the Australian series A Place to Call Home (TV series), Carolyn Bligh, in an attempt to encourage her niece to divulge her sorrows, tells her, \\"It'd be better than burying your head in Forever Amber.

The film was written by husband-and-wife team Jerry Leichtling and Arlene Sarner. The film was a box office success and received positive reviews from critics. It was nominated for three Academy Awards: Best Actress (Turner), Best Cinematography, and Best Costume Design. In addition, Turner was nominated for Best Foreign Actress at the Sant Jordi Awards. Plot In 1985, wearing a dress she wore in high school in 1960, Peggy Sue Bodell sets off for her 25-year high school reunion. Although she has some reservations, she attends anyway, accompanied by her daughter Beth instead of her high-school sweetheart husband Charlie, since the two are separated because of his infidelity. She and Charlie were married right after graduation, when Peggy Sue got pregnant, and because of this she is afraid of being questioned about his absence. When she arrives at the reunion, she is happy at having the chance to reconnect with Maddy and Carol, her old best friends. However, an awkward scene begins to play out as Charlie arrives unexpectedly and Peggy Sue proceeds to ignore him. This awkwardness continues until the event's MC announces the reunion's ‚Äúking & queen‚Äù ‚Äî Richard Norvik, the former class geek turned billionaire inventor, and Peggy Sue. Peggy Sue‚Äôs demeanor is quite normal until they wheel out the reunion cake, at which time she promptly faints. Peggy Sue awakens to find herself still in the same location (the high school gym where the reunion was taking place) but 25 years in the past. It is now 1960, during her senior year of high school, where she‚Äôs just passed out after having donated blood. She wakes up stunned to find that all her middle-aged friends, whom she was just with at the reunion, are now their younger, teenaged selves. Still in shock, she allows herself to be taken home, all the while noticing that things aren‚Äôt how she knows them to be in 1985, but how she knew them to be 25 years prior. After a rough first night, she decides to accept her circumstances, behave as if everything is normal and have some fun while she‚Äôs at it. The only difference is that since she knows how she and Charlie will end, when given the chance to break up with him she thinks it might be best. Hoping that Richard Norvik might be able to shed light on her situation, she befriends him. At lunch she ignores Charlie, causing him to become jealous, and instead uses the time to arrange a meeting with Richard after school to discuss time travel. She chooses to tell Richard her secret, which he at first doesn‚Äôt believe, until he realizes that only someone from the future could know what she knows about him and the world at large. It is around this time that Peggy Sue makes the decision to break up with Charlie, surely knowing that between them she‚Äôs the only one who wants that outcome. Even with that decision made, she decides to sleep with Charlie one night after a party, but he panics, and reminds her of how she rebuffed him the weekend before. Thinking that she‚Äôs playing mind games with him, he abruptly takes her home but instead of going inside, she walks to an all-night caf√©. As she walks past the caf√©, she looks in and sees Michael Fitzsimmons, the artsy loner at school she always wished she‚Äôd slept with, and goes inside to talk to him. During the conversation she learns that they have more in common than she thought so she decides to leave with him. They ride off on his motorcycle, eventually stopping in a field, where they smoke marijuana and discover more about each other. At one point, Michael asks if she‚Äôs going to marry Charlie, to which she replies that she‚Äôs already done that and will not be doing it again. After talking and smoking, he recites some of his poetry for her and the two end up having sex. Some time later, Michael reveals that he wants Peggy Sue to go to Utah with him and another woman to join them in a polygamous marriage, where the two women can support him raising chickens while he writes. She tells him that he should go to Utah and that he should use their night together as the topic he writes about. During their conversation she hears someone singing and, recognizing the voice, she looks towards the stage to find that it‚Äôs Charlie. It‚Äôs at that moment that she realizes there is more to Charlie than she thought there was. Michael notices where her attention is drawn, becomes upset and, thinking that this means she is declining his offer so she can be with Charlie, is ready to leave. After Peggy Sue and Michael leave, Charlie auditions for a music agent and is rejected outright. The next day, when Peggy Sue tries to talk to him he lashes out at her, but ignoring his anger, she gives him a song she \\"wrote\\" for him, which is actually the song \\"She Loves You\\" by the Beatles. She leaves to say goodbye to Richard, stating that she wants to stop ruining her life and everyone's around her, especially Charlie's, since the reason he stopped singing is because she got pregnant with their daughter. Richard then proposes, but she refuses his proposal, thinking about how she doesn't want to marry anyone at this point and knowing he must become valedictorian. Confused, she visits her grandparents for her 18th birthday and, upon learning that her grandmother can see the future, she tells them her story. Her grandfather takes her to meet with his lodge buddies, where they perform a strange s√©ance ritual to send her back to the year 1985. Peggy Sue then disappears from the lodge, having been picked up and carried away by Charlie, leaving everyone at the lodge thinking that the s√©ance has worked. He tells her that he informed his dad that he gave up singing and was given 10% of the business so he can support her. He then proposes and gives her the locket she is seen wearing at the beginning of the film. When she looks inside the locket, she sees baby pictures of her and Charlie, which resemble their children. At this moment, Peggy Sue realizes just how much he truly loves her, and she him, and they kiss. They start to have sex, which will ultimately lead to Peggy becoming pregnant and marrying Charlie. In the next instant, Peggy Sue awakens in a hospital back in 1985, with Charlie at her side. He is deeply regretful for his adultery, and tells her he wants her back. When she questions him about his girlfriend Janet, he swears to her that it is over. It seems there is hope for a happy reconciliation when Peggy Sue looks at Charlie with new eyes and, citing a reference from her grandfather, who claimed it was her grandmother's strudel that kept the family together, tells him, \\"I‚Äôd like to invite you over to your house for dinner on Sunday with your kids. I‚Äôll make a strudel.\\" Cast Production =Development= The film was originally going to star Debra Winger and be directed by Jonathan Demme. They had creative differences and Demme left the project, to be replaced by Penny Marshall, who would be making her feature directorial debut. Then Marshall had creative differences with the writers and left the project. Winger then quit out of loyalty to Marshall. Rastar, the production company, offered the film to Francis Ford Coppola hoping to entice Winger back to the project.IS 'PEGGY SUE' NEAR THE ALTAR WITH COPPOLA?: FILM CLIPS London, Michael.

In the end, Kathleen Turner became the star. =Shooting= Kathleen Turner stated that Francis Ford Coppola was contractually obligated to finish the film on time or lose final cut privilege. Accordingly the cast and crew worked twenty hours a day, six days a week to deliver the movie to the studio on time. Turner has spoken numerous times about the difficulty of working with co-star Nicolas Cage. In her 2008 memoir, she wrote that: Turner also criticized Cage for his decision to adopt a nasal fry for his character (Cage said he based it on Pokey from The Gumby Show), and to wear false teeth. In response to Turner's claims that he had driven drunk and stolen a Chihuahua, Cage sued her for defamation and won. In exchange he received a public apology from Turner, admission from her publisher that the claims were false and defamatory, and a pledge that Turner and the publisher would make a substantial donation to charity. During an interview in 2018, Turner commented on Cage's nasal voice that: Release and reception Peggy Sue Got Married gained a positive reaction from critics, as it currently holds an 86% rating on Rotten Tomatoes based on 28 reviews The site's consensus reads, \\"Peggy Sue Got Married may seem just another in the line of 80's boomer nostalgia films, but none of the others have Kathleen Turner keen lead performance.\\" The film opened with $6,942,408 and ended up grossing $41,382,841 in the U.S. It was the first box-office success for Coppola since The Outsiders.

Biography Since 1998, Chung has been the Akamai Professor in Internet Mathematics at the University of California, San Diego (UCSD). She received her doctorate from the University of Pennsylvania in 1974, under the direction of Herbert Wilf. After working at Bell Laboratories and Bellcore for nineteen years, she joined the faculty of the University of Pennsylvania as the first female tenured professor in mathematics. She serves on the editorial boards of more than a dozen international journals. Since 2003 she has been the editor-in-chief of Internet Mathematics. She has been invited to give lectures at many conferences, including the International Congress of Mathematicians in 1994 and a plenary lecture on the mathematics of PageRank at the 2008 Annual meeting of the American Mathematical Society.

Biography Fan Chung was born on October 9, 1949 in Kaohsiung, Taiwan. Under the influence of her father, an engineer, she became interested in mathematics, especially in the area of combinatorics in high school in Kaohsiung. After high school, Chung entered the National Taiwan University (NTU) to start her career in mathematics formally. While Chung was an undergraduate, she was surrounded by many female mathematicians, and this helped encourage her to pursue and study mathematics. After graduating from NTU with a B.S. in mathematics, Chung went on to the University of Pennsylvania to pursue a career in mathematics. There she obtained the highest score in the qualifying exam by a wide margin, catching the attention of Herbert Wilf, who would eventually become her doctoral advisor. Wilf suggested Ramsey theory as a subject Chung could work on. During a single week studying material Chung had come up with new proofs for established results in the field. Wilf said: \\"My eyes were bulging. I was very excited. I asked her to go to the blackboard and show me. What she wrote was incredible! In just one week, from a cold start, she had a major result in Ramsey theory. I told her she had just done two-thirds of a doctoral dissertation.\\" Chung was awarded a M.S. in 1972 and a Ph.D. two years later. By this time, she was married and had already given birth to her first child. The same year she received her Ph.D. and started working for the Mathematical Foundations of Computing Department at Bell Laboratories in Murray Hill, New Jersey. The position at Bell Laboratories was an opportunity to work with other excellent mathematicians, but also it contributed to her mathematical world powerfully. She published many impressive mathematical papers and published many joint papers with Ron Graham. After twenty years of work at Bell Laboratories and Bellcore, Chung decided to go back to the University of Pennsylvania to become a professor of mathematics. In 1998, she was named Distinguished Professor of Mathematics at the University of California, San Diego. To date, she has over 200 publications to her name. The two best known books are Spectral Graph Theory and Erd≈ës on Graphs. Spectral Graph Theory studies how the spectrum of the Laplacian of a graph is related to its combinatorial properties. Erd≈ës on Graphs, which was jointly written by Fan Chung and Ron Graham, studies many of Paul Erd≈ës problems and conjectures in graph theory. Beyond her contributions to graph theory, Chung has used her knowledge to connect different fields of science. As she wrote in \\"Graph Theory in the Information Age, : ‚ÄúIn the past decade, graph theory has gone through a remarkable shift and a profound transformation. The change is in large part due to the humongous amount of information that we are confronted with. A main way to sort through massive data sets is to build and examine the network formed by interrelations. For example, Google‚Äôs successful Web search algorithms are based on the WWW graph, which contains all Web pages as vertices and hyperlinks as edges. There are all sorts of information networks, such as biological networks built from biological databases and social networks formed by email, phone calls, instant messaging, etc., as well as various types of physical networks. Of particular interest to mathematicians is the collaboration graph, which is based on the data from Mathematical Reviews. In the collaboration graph, every mathematician is a vertex, and two mathematicians who wrote a joint paper are connected.‚ÄùChung, Fan Graph Theory in the Information Age January 2009, Washington D.C Chung's life was profiled in the 2017 documentary film Girls who fell in love with Math. =Bell Laboratories= In 1974, Fan Chung graduated from the University of Pennsylvania and became a member of Technical Staff working for the Mathematical Foundations of Computing Department at Bell Laboratories in Murray Hill, New Jersey. She worked under Henry Pollak. During this time, Chung collaborated with many leading mathematicians who work for Bell Laboratories such as Ron Graham. In 1975, Chung published her first joint paper with Graham on Multicolor Ramsey Numbers for Complete Bipartite Graphs which was published in the Journal of Combinatorial Theory. In 1983 the Bell Telephone Company was split up. Since Pollak joined and became head of a research unit within a new company, he asked Chung to become Research Manager. Until 1990, she was one of the first to receive a fellowship to spend a sabbatical at a university. She supervised many mathematicians in the unit. According to Chung's words, although people respect her because of the power to make decisions with positions in management, she prefers to be respected because of her achievement in mathematics. Since then, she has returned to the academic world.J J O'Connor and E F Roberson, Fan Rong K Chung Graham, web, www-history.mcs.st-andrews.ac.uk/Biographies/Chung.html. =Ron Graham= Fan Chung's first marriage ended in divorce in 1982. However, when she worked at Bell Laboratories, she met Ronald Graham. During that time, they became close friends and published many joint papers in graph theory, eventually marrying in 1983. In Paul Hoffman's book The Man Who Loved Only Numbers, regarding her marriage with Graham, Chung said: :Many mathematicians would hate to marry someone in the profession. They fear their relationship would be too competitive. In our case, not only are we both mathematicians, we both do work in the same areas. So we can understand and appreciate what the other is working on, and we can work on things together and sometimes make good progress.Hoffman, P The man who loved only numbers London, 1998. In 1998, Graham and Chung co-wrote the book Erd≈ës on Graphs. Research =Spectral graph theory= Among Fan Chung's publications, her contributions to spectral graph theory are important to this area of graph theory. From the first publications about undirected graphs to recent publications about the directed graphs, Fan Chung creates the solid base in the spectral graph theory to the future graph theorist. Spectral graph theory, as one of the most important theories in graph theory, combines the algebra and graph perfectly. Historically, algebraic methods treat many types of graphs efficiently. Her work initiated a geometric approach to spectral graph theory with connections to differential geometry. According to the biography Fan Rong K Chung Graham, \\"Spectral graph theory studies how the spectrum of the Laplacian of a graph is related to its combinatorial properties.\\". In 1997, the American Mathematical Society published Chung's book Spectral graph theory. This book became a standard textbook at many universities and is the key to study Spectral graph theory for many mathematics students who are interested in this area. Fan Chung's study in the spectral graph theory brings this ‚Äúalgebraic connectivity‚Äù of graphs into a new and higher level. =Network science= Fan Chung's work in random graph models shed new lights on the field of network science. Many real-world large information networks (such as Internet Graphs, Call Graphs, and Collaboration Graphs, etc.) have been observed to be well approximated by a power law distribution. Fan Chung's work in the Chung-Lu model, pioneered the theory of treating random graphs with arbitrary degree distributions, including the power law graphs. Her work provides a solid framework for quantitative and rigorous analysis for modeling and analyzing large complex networks. It also often serves as a popular benchmark for comparing new graph models in network science. In 2006, the American Mathematics Society and the Conference Board of the Mathematical Sciences co- published Fan Chung and Linyuan Lu's book Complex Graphs and Networks. The book gave a well-structured exposition for using combinatorial, probabilistic, spectral methods as well as other new and improved tools to analyze real-world large information networks. =Quasi-random graphs= Fan Chung, together with Ronald Graham and Richard Wilson, introduced a strong notion of equivalence among graph properties through the control of error bounds and developed the theory of quasi-random graphs. In a series of research papers (with several coauthors), she showed that a large family of graph properties is equivalent in the sense that if a graph satisfies any one of the properties, it must satisfy all of them. The set of equivalent quasi-random properties includes a surprisingly diverse collection of properties, and therefore provides efficient methods for validating graph properties. Many (but not all) random graph properties are quasi-random. The notion of quasi-randomness have been extended to many other combinatorial structures, such as sequences, tournaments, hypergraphs and graph limits. In general, the theory of quasi- randomness gives a rigorous approach to 'random-like' or 'pseudorandom' alternatives. =Extremal graph theory= A basic question in extremal graph theory is to find unavoidable patterns and structures in graphs with given density or distribution. A complementary problem is to find a smallest graph which contains every member of a given family of graphs as subgraphs. In a series of work with Paul Erd≈ës, Chung determined the sizes and structures of unavoidable graphs and hypergraphs. With several coauthors, she also derived many elegant and surprising results on universal graphs. Her fundamental contributions in these areas of extremal graph theory have many applications in parallel computations.

He was the last Emperor to support Roman polytheism.Gerard Friell (1998). Theodosius: The Empire at Bay (Roman Imperial Biographies). (Routledge; 1 edition (May 28, 1998)). Life A former teacher of grammar and rhetoric, as well as magister scrinorum, Eugenius was an acquaintance of Arbogast, the magister militum. Arbogast was of Frankish origin, and de facto ruler of the western portion of the Empire. =Rise to power= Following the death of Valentinian II, Arbogast, who had probably been the cause of Valentinian II's murder or suicide, elevated Eugenius to the purple (22 August 392). Deferring to Eugenius offered Arbogast two strong advantages: first, Eugenius, a Roman, was more suitable than Arbogast, a Frank, as an emperor; furthermore, the Roman Senate would be more likely to support Eugenius. =Civil, religious, and military policies= After being installed as Emperor, Eugenius changed the imperial administrators. When Theodosius had left the western half of the empire to Valentinian II, he had put his own men in the highest civil offices, to keep a strong grasp on the whole empire. Eugenius replaced these administrators with others loyal to himself, coming from the senatorial class. Virius Nicomachus Flavianus the Elder became Praetorian Prefect of Italy, his son Nicomachus Flavianus the Younger received the title of Prefect of Rome, while the new praefectus annonae was Numerius Proiectus. Though his actual beliefs are a matter of controversy among ancient and modern historians,Edward Gibbon, The Decline And Fall Of The Roman Empire, (The Modern Library, 1932), chap. XXVII., p. 996, note; the ecclesiastical historians, Philostorgius and Sozomen, actually state he was a pagan-not very reliable authoritiesAn Encyclopedia Of World History, (Houghton Mifflin Company, 1952), chap. II., Ancient History, p. 120 Eugenius was at least publicly a Christian, and therefore was reluctant to accept a program of imperial support to Polytheism. His men, however, convinced Eugenius to use public money to fund pagan projects, such as the rededication of the Temple of Venus and Rome and the restoration of the Altar of Victory within the Curia (removed by Emperor Gratian). This religious policy created tension with pro-Christian figures, such as Emperor Theodosius and the powerful and influential Bishop Ambrose, who left his see in Milan when the imperial court of Eugenius arrived. Eugenius was also successful in the military field, notably in the renovation of old alliances with Alamanni and Franks. Arbogast, who was a Frank and had also Alamanni and Frankish soldiers in his ranks, marched to the Rhine frontier, where he impressed and pacified the Germanic tribes by parading his army in front of them. =Fall= After his election as emperor, Eugenius sent ambassadors to Theodosius's court, asking for recognition of his election. Theodosius received them, but started to gather troops to defeat Eugenius. Theodosius also promoted his eight-year-old son Honorius to the rank of \\"Augustus\\" of the West in January 393. Theodosius then moved from Constantinople with his army, and met Eugenius and Arbogast in the Battle of the Frigidus (Vipava Valley, Slovenia) on 6 September 394. The bloody battle lasted two days, and was marked by unusual astronomical and meteorological events, but in the end Theodosius won. Arbogast immediately committed suicide after the defeat, while Eugenius was held for execution as a criminal, his head afterward being displayed in Theodosius' camp. Evaluation The reign of Eugenius marked the end of an era and the beginning of a new one. Five months later Theodosius died, dividing his empire between his two sons. This had happened many times before in the previous two centuries, but this time it was to be final ‚Äì the Roman Empire never reunited, even under Leo I the Thracian (when there was no Western Emperor for some periods), and soon after his reign, the western half fell. Eugenius also represented the last opportunity for the pagans, with the senatorial class, to oppose the Christianization of the Empire. The Battle of the Frigidus was part of a trend towards using increasing percentages of barbarian troops, especially in the west, where it led to the weakening of the Empire itself.

It is one of the three BBC national regions, together with BBC Scotland and BBC Cymru Wales. Based at Broadcasting House, Belfast, it provides television, radio, online and interactive television content. BBC Northern Ireland currently employs 700 people, largely in Belfast. BBC Northern Ireland has two TV channels - BBC One Northern Ireland, BBC Two Northern Ireland; and two radio stations - BBC Radio Ulster and BBC Radio Foyle.

BBC Northern Ireland operates two television stations; *BBC One Northern Ireland *BBC Two Northern Ireland Prior to 27 October 2006, BBC Two NI was a digital only service while BBC Two Northern Ireland was available on analogue transmission. Since 28 October 2006, BBC Two Northern Ireland has been the on-air name for both services which have been merged. BBC Northern Ireland has its own team of continuity announcers which introduce the vast majority of programmes on BBC One and BBC Two in Northern Ireland. BBC Northern Ireland makes some of its own programmes itself. However, unlike the radio stations, the television stations' content is for the most part identical to that broadcast by the BBC One and BBC Two channels in England. Some network programmes may however be time-shifted to make room for more local programming. Most local programmes are broadcast on BBC One Northern Ireland. = Regional television = * BBC Newsline is the regional news service. Its main presenters are Donna Traynor and Tara Mills.

There is coverage of the Orange parades on 12 July, St. Patrick's Day parades on 17 March, etc. = Networked productions = As well as programmes intended purely for a regional audience, BBC Northern Ireland also produces programmes for national consumption on the BBC's channels across the UK. The main part of BBC Northern Ireland's network productions are in comedy and drama.BBC Northern Ireland This has included producing the high-profile drama series Messiah. BBC Northern Ireland is also involved in co-productions with other broadcasting networks, most notably with the Irish broadcaster RT√â. = Republic of Ireland = *BBC One Northern Ireland and BBC Two Northern Ireland are widely available across the border in the Republic of Ireland. These channels are carried on pay-TV platforms in the Republic including Sky Ireland, Virgin Media Ireland, Magnet Networks, SCTV and Crossan Cable. BBC One NI and BBC Two NI are also available in the Republic via signal overspill by Freeview in counties near the Northern Ireland border. Similarly, prior to the digital switchover in 2012, they were available in these areas via analogue television. *Additional BBC channels such as BBC Four, BBC News, and BBC World News, are also available within the Republic of Ireland via a free- to-air satellite receiver or, in some areas near the border, via overspill from the Freeview service. Leading subscription TV providers also carry these channels. *On 1 February 2010 the Republic of Ireland's Minister for Communications Eamon Ryan signed an agreement with the UK's Ben Bradshaw.

Those who believe themselves so possessed commonly claim that symptoms of demonic possession include missing memories, perceptual distortions, loss of a sense of control, and hyper-suggestibility. Erika Bourguignon found in a study of 488 societies worldwide that seventy- four percent believe in possession by spirits, with the highest numbers of believing societies in Pacific cultures and the lowest incidence among Native Americans of both North and South America. Abrahamic religions = Judaism = While demons exist in the Jewish religion, they are seen as agents of God. In the Hebrew Bible, one of the very few mentions of demons harassing mortals is in the First Book of Samuel, Exorcism prayer \\"Saul‚Äôs attendants said to him, ‚ÄúSee, an evil spirit from God is tormenting you.\\" There are few mentions in other Judaic religious works, with only one in the Mishnah. Both the Talmud and the Midrash mention demons, but though Kabbalists trace demonology throughout the Jewish holy books, little is mentioned of possession. In the 16th century, Isaac Luria, a Jewish mystic, wrote about the transmigration of souls seeking perfection. His disciples took his idea a step further, creating the idea of a dybbuk, a soul inhabiting a victim until it had accomplished its task or atoned for its sin. The dybbuk appears in Jewish folklore and literature, as well as in chronicles of Jewish life. = Christianity = From its beginning, Christianity has held that possession derives from the Devil, i.e. Satan, his lesser demons, the fallen angels. In the battle between Satan and Heaven, one of Satan's strategies is to possess humans. The New Testament mentions several episodes in which Jesus drove out demons from persons.  Catholicism  Catholic exorcists differentiate between \\"ordinary\\" Satanic/demonic activity or influence (mundane everyday temptations) and \\"extraordinary\\" Satanic/demonic activity, which can take six different forms, ranging from complete control by Satan or demons to voluntary submission: #Possession, in which Satan or demons take full possession of a person's body without their consent. This possession usually comes as a result of a person's actions; actions that lead to an increased susceptibility to Satan's influence. #Obsession, which includes sudden attacks of irrationally obsessive thoughts, usually culminating in suicidal ideation, and which typically influences dreams. #Oppression, in which there is no loss of consciousness or involuntary action, such as in the biblical Book of Job in which Job was tormented by a series of misfortunes in business, material possessions, family, and health. #External physical pain caused by Satan or demons. #Infestation, which affects houses, objects/things, or animals; and #Subjection, in which a person voluntarily submits to Satan or demons. In the Roman Ritual, true demonic or satanic possession has been characterized since the Middle Ages, by the following four typical characteristics:p.25, The Vatican's Exorcists by Tracy Wilkinson; Warner Books, New York, 2007The Rite: The Making of a Modern Exorcist by Matt Baglio; Doubleday, New York, 2009. # Manifestation of superhuman strength. #Speaking in tongues or languages that the victim cannot know. #Revelation of knowledge, distant or hidden, that the victim cannot know. #Blasphemous rage, obscene hand gestures, using profanity and an aversion to holy symbols and names, relics or places. The New Catholic Encyclopedia states, \\"Ecclesiastical authorities are reluctant to admit diabolical possession in most cases, because many can be explained by physical or mental illness alone. Therefore, medical and psychological examinations are necessary before the performance of major exorcism. The standard that must be met is that of moral certitude (De exorcismis, 16). For an exorcist to be morally certain, or beyond reasonable doubt, that he is dealing with a genuine case of demonic possession, there must be no other reasonable explanation for the phenomena in question.\\" Exorcism of the Gerasene Demonaic The New Testament (of The Holy Bible) indicates that people can be possessed by demons, but that the demons respond and submit to Jesus Christ's authority: 33In the synagogue, there was a man possessed by a demon, an evil spirit. He cried out at the top of his voice, 34\\"Ha! What do you want with us, Jesus of Nazareth? Have you come to destroy us? I know who you are‚Äîthe Holy One of God! \\"35\\"Be quiet!\\" Jesus said sternly. \\"Come out of him!\\" Then the demon threw the man down before them all and came out without injuring him. 36All the people were amazed and said to each other, \\"What is this teaching? With authority and power he gives orders to evil spirits and they come out!\\" 37And the news about him spread throughout the surrounding area. (Luke 4:33-35 NIV) It also indicates that demons can possess animals as in the exorcism of the Gerasene demoniac. Official Catholic doctrine affirms that demonic possession can occur as distinguished from mental illness, but stresses that cases of mental illness should not be misdiagnosed as demonic influence. Catholic exorcisms can occur only under the authority of a bishop and in accordance with strict rules; a simple exorcism also occurs during baptism. Protestantism The literal view of demonic possession is held by a number of Christian denominations. In both charismatic and evangelical Christianity, exorcisms of demons are often carried out by individuals or groups known as Deliverance ministries. Symptoms of such possessions, according to these groups, can include chronic fatigue syndrome, homosexuality, addiction to pornography, and alcoholism. The New Testament's description of people who had evil spirits includes a knowledge of future events (Acts 16:16) and great strength (Act 19:13-16), among others, and shows that those with evil spirits can speak of Christ (Mark 3:7-11). In medieval Great Britain, the Christian church had offered suggestions on safeguarding one's home. Suggestions ranged from dousing a household with holy water, placing wax and herbs on thresholds to \\"ward off witches occult,\\" and avoiding certain areas of townships known to be frequented by witches and Devil worshippers after dark. Afflicted persons were restricted from entering the church, but might share the shelter of the porch with lepers and persons of offensive life. After the prayers, if quiet, they might come in to receive the bishop's blessing and listen to the sermon. They were daily fed and prayed over by the exorcists, and, in case of recovery, after a fast of from 20 to 40 days, were admitted to the Eucharist, and their names and cures entered in the church records. In 1603, the Church of England forbade its clergy from performing exorcisms because of numerous fraudulent cases of demonic possession. = Islam = Various types of creatures, such as jinn, shayatin, 'afarit and ruh, found within Islamic culture, are often held to be responsible for demonic possession. Usually, Iblis, the leader of evil spirits, only tempts humans into sin by following their lower desires.Michael Anthony Sells Early Islamic Mysticism: Sufi, Qur ºan, Miraj, Poetic and Theological Writings Paulist Press, 1996 page 143 Though not directly attested in the Quran, the notion of jinn possessing humans is widespread among Muslims and also accepted by most Islamic scholars. There are various reasons given as to why a jinn might seek to possess an individual, such as falling in love with them, taking revenge for hurting them or their relatives, or other undefined reasons. Since jinn are not necessarily evil, they are distinguished from cultural concepts of possession by devils/demons.Al-Krenawi, A. & Graham, J.R. Clinical Social Work Journal (1997) 25: 211. https://doi.org/10.1023/A:1025714626136 In contrast, the shayatin are inherently evil. Hadiths suggest that the demons/devils whisper from within the human body, within or next to the heart, \\"devilish whisperings\\" (Arabic: waswƒÅs ŸàŸéÿ≥ŸíŸàŸéÿßÿ≥) are thought of as a kind of possession.Szombathy, Zoltan, ‚ÄúExorcism‚Äù, in: Encyclopaedia of Islam, THREE, Edited by: Kate Fleet, Gudrun Kr√§mer, Denis Matringe, John Nawas, Everett Rowson. Consulted online on 15 November 2019 First published online: 2014 First print edition: 9789004269637, 2014, 2014-4  Buddhism  Buddha, resisting the demons of Mara In Buddhism, a demon can either be a being suffering in the hell realm or it could be a delusion. Before Siddhartha became Gautama Buddha, He was challenged by Mara, the embodiment of temptation, and overcame it. In traditional Buddhism, four metaphorical forms of \\"mƒÅra\\" are given: * Kle≈õa-mƒÅra, or MaÃãra as the embodiment of all unskillful emotions, such as greed, hate and delusion.(the Demons of delusions/defilement and unwholesome states) * M·πõtyu-mƒÅra, or MƒÅra as death. (the Demons of the Lord of death) * Skandha-mƒÅra, or MƒÅra as metaphor for the entirety of conditioned existence.(the Demons of contaminated aggregates) * Devaputra-mƒÅra, the deva of the sensuous realm, who tries to prevent Gautama Buddha from attaining liberation from the cycle of rebirth on the night of the Buddha's enlightenment.(the Demons of sons of deva Gods/desire and temptation) It is believed that the demon will depart to a different realm once the demon is appeased.  Other religions  In many of the Diasporic traditional African religions, possessing demons are not necessarily harmful or evil, but are rather seeking to rebuke misconduct in the living. As Pentecostal and Charismatic Christian churches move into both African and Oceanic areas, a merger of belief can take place. Demons can be representative of the \\"old\\" indigenous religions, which the Christian ministers work to exorcise. Medicine and psychology Those who profess a belief in demonic possession, also referred to as possessive trance disorder, have sometimes ascribed to possession the symptoms associated with physical or mental illnesses, such as hysteria, Tourette syndrome, epilepsy,Pfeifer, S. (1994). Belief in demons and exorcism in psychiatric patients in Switzerland. British Journal of Medical Psychology 4 247-258. schizophrenia, conversion disorder or dissociative identity disorder. In its article on Dissociative Identity Disorder, the DSM-5 states, \\"Possession-form identities in dissociative identity disorder typically manifest as behaviors that appear as if a 'spirit,' supernatural being, or outside person has taken control such that the individual begins speaking or acting in a distinctly different manner.\\" It is not uncommon to ascribe the experience of sleep paralysis to demonic possession, although it's not a physical or mental illness.Beyerstein, Barry L. (1995). Dissociative States: Possession and Exorcism. In Gordon Stein (ed.). The Encyclopedia of the Paranormal. Prometheus Books. pp. 544-552. The symptoms vary across cultures. Demonic possession is not a valid psychiatric or medical diagnosis recognized by either the DSM-5 or the ICD-10.Henderson, J. (1981). Exorcism and Possession in Psychotherapy Practice. The Canadian Journal of Psychiatry 27: 129-134. The DSM-5 indicates that personality states of dissociative identity disorder may be interpreted as possession in some cultures, and instances of spirit possession are often related to traumatic experiences‚Äîsuggesting that possession experiences may be caused by mental distress. Some have expressed concern that belief in demonic possession can limit access to health care for the mentally ill. Studies have found that alleged demonic possessions can be related to trauma.

Cajun music is often mentioned in tandem with the Creole-based zydeco music, both of Acadiana origin, and both of which have influenced the other in many ways. These French Louisiana sounds have influenced American popular music for many decades, especially country music, and have influenced pop culture through mass media, such as television commercials. Aural analysis Cajun music is relatively catchy with an infectious beat and a lot of forward drive, placing the accordion at the center. Besides the voices, only two melodic instruments are heard, the accordion and fiddle, but usually in the background can also be heard the high, clear tones of a metal triangle. The harmonies of Cajun music are simple, basically I, IV, and V, tonic, sub-dominant, and dominant with many tunes just using I and V. The melodic range is just one octave, rising a fifth above the tonic and descending a fourth below. Because the Cajun accordion is a diatonic instrument (do-re-mi or natural major scale) it can only play tunes in a few keys. For example, a \\"C\\" accordion is tuned such that the entire C scale is available on the ten buttons (over two octaves) and it can play a tune in the key of C with all the notes of the C scale available (C-D-E-F-G-A-B). A \\"C\\" accordion can also play a tune in the key of G, but one note of the G scale will be missing which is F#. So tunes played in the key of G will not have an F# note. A \\"C\\" accordion can also play a few Cajun songs in the key of F however the Bb note will be missing. Also it can play in the key of D with a bluesy sound since the F natural note becomes a flat third or minor third in the key of D. However a skilled accordion player can play in these other keys and still make good music whereby the notes missing (because of the limitations of the diatonic tuning) are not needed by the melody. Since an instrument must match the singer's range, much Cajun singing is sung in the singer's upper range. The accordionist gives the vocal melody greater energy by repeating most notes. =Subgenres of Cajun music=  Traditional Cajun (Before 1930)  This style comprises the roots of Cajun dance music, involving only a few instruments such as the Cajun accordion, fiddle, and triangle. This form holds firm to a basic rhythm with staccato style notes, including many fiddle double stops. Each fiddle solo is composed of a major scale riff, repeated between verses. This form has existed since the early 1900s and the waltz and two-step are the most common dances of this Cajun music genre. Many songs that became standards in the Cajun music repertoire were first recorded in this period of the 1920s and 1930s. A number of the most prominent traditional Cajun musicians are featured in the 1989 documentary J'Ai Ete Au Bal. Am√©d√© Ardoin, Canray Fontenot, Wade Frug√©, Dewey Segura, Joe Falcon and Cl√©oma Falcon, and the Breaux Brothers are examples of this genre. Country and Texas swing Cajun (1934‚Äì1941) This style involves heavy elements of Texas country music influence and a move away from the traditional accordion. This music has more of a \\"swing\\" style popularized by Bob Wills and the Texas Playboys. Instead of the music being dominated by the accordion, Cajun swing relies heavily on the fiddle and piano with a swinging tempo. Bands in the 1940s began using the steel guitar, an instrument which also found use in dancehall Cajun music. Dances such as \\"the jig\\" are common among this genre of Cajun music. Leo Soileau, J. B. Fuselier, Leroy \\"Happy Fats\\" Leblanc, Harry Choates and the Hackberry Ramblers are early examples of this style. The Red Stick Ramblers and The Lost Bayou Ramblers are contemporary bands playing in this style. Dancehall Cajun (1946‚Äì1960) This style, Dancehall Cajun is often known in South Louisiana as \\"Fais do-do\\" music because it is commonly played at fais do-dos; this in turn comes from the local practice of couples bringing their children with them to the dance hall. This period is defined as such due to the fact that more bands moved from the house dances to large halls, as well as, electrical amplification of instruments to cut through the noise of the crowd. It is similar to traditional Cajun music with added accompaniment such as the bass guitar, drum kit, steel guitar, and rhythm guitar, electric or acoustic. The same abrupt, staccato feel can be felt as in traditional Cajun. This style originated in the post-war era of the late 1940s and continues up until the present in small town dancehalls. Electrification of the dance venues allowed the fiddle to be played in a smoother style, alternating leads with the accordion. The steel guitar also adds remarks. Typically in dancehall Cajun performances the melody is played by the accordion followed by a bridge, a vocal verse, a leading line by the steel guitar, a leading line by the fiddle, then a leading line by the accordion player again followed by a bridge. This is followed by the next vocal verse, and so on. Lawrence Walker, Aldus Roger, Nathan Abshire, Iry LeJeune, and Sidney Brown are examples of this musical period. The characteristics of dancehall Cajun can be seen in current artists such as Jesse L√©g√©, and The Basin Brothers Band. Cajun \\"renaissance\\" Drawing on elements of the earlier traditional, Texas swing, and dancehall periods, the Cajun \\"renaissance\\" also incorporates more modern elements of folk, blues, jazz and swamp pop, and bluegrass styles. The fiddle players relax, involving a more legato feel to the solos. The quick fiddle action and double stops are missing, replaced by dominant blues chords and jazz slides. Pioneers such as BeauSoleil with Michael Doucet, Zachary Richard, Jambalaya Cajun Band, Bruce Daigrepont, and others broke new ground, while other musicians such as Eddie LeJeune, Irvin LeJeune, Homer LeJeune, Robert Jardell, Les Fr√®res Michot, the Pine Leaf Boys, and others brought energy to older, more traditional forms. Contemporary Cajun music This style involves Cajun music with a heavy influence of rock, R&B;, blues, soul, and zydeco, producing a less traditional, more contemporary sound. Although led by the accordion, the electric guitar, washboard, and keyboard are all present in this form. Since the 1940s, musicians such as Wayne Toups, Roddie Romero and the Hub City Allstars, Lee Benoit, Damon Troy, Kevin Naquin, Trent LeJeune, and Steve Riley and the Mamou Playboys have popularized this modern form of Cajun music. More recently the Lost Bayou Ramblers have been experimenting mixing traditional instruments with cutting edge technology as showcased on their last two records, Mammoth Waltz (2012) and Kalenda (2017). The sound has been dubbed ‚ÄúHeavy Cajun Psych‚Äù Doug Kershaw recorded \\"Louisiana Man,\\" an autobiographical song that he had written while in the army. The song sold millions of copies; over the years it has come to be considered a standard of modern Cajun music.http://www.answers.com/topic/louisiana-man-the-very-best-of-doug- kershaw-live The song was eventually covered by more than 800 artists. Atchafalaya was active cajun group from 1982 to 1986. Lyrics The unaccompanied ballad was the earliest form of Cajun music. The narrative songs often had passionate themes of death, solitude or ill-fated love ‚Äî a reaction to their harsh exile and rough frontier experience, as well as celebrations of love and humorous tales. Ballads were ritually sung at weddings and funerals, and sung informally for small groups of people at house parties as the food cooked and young children played. The early songs were mixtures of la la, contra dances, reels and jigs and other folk influences from black, white and Native American traditions. Early song lyrics were entirely in Cajun French. Though French-language songwriting is still common, some Cajun music today is sung in English with younger singers and audiences. Instruments tit-fer, Cajun accordion, and a fiddle. In earlier years, the fiddle was the predominant instrument. Usually two fiddles were common, one playing the melody while the other provided the s√©conde, or back-up part. Twin fiddling traditions represent the music in its purest form, as it was brought to Louisiana with the early immigrants and before popular American tunes mingled with it. Gradually, the Cajun accordion emerged to share the limelight. In the early 1930s, the accordion was pushed into the background by the popular string sounds of the time. Piano and other string instruments joined fiddle to create a jazzy swing beat strongly influenced by Western Swing of neighboring Texas. The Cajun fiddle was a well established instrument which had been somewhat eclipsed by the German accordion fad, which had similar effect in French Canada. But in the Depression era the tide turned, and, according to Stricklin et al., it had never been eclipsed.Southern music/American music By Bill C. Malone, David Stricklin 1979 M& S p. 62 After World War II, the accordion regained its popularity in Cajun music. Also, in the late 1930s and 1940s, country music became the dominant influence on Cajun music, and steel guitar and bass were introduced. Modern Cajun music began taking on the influence of jazz and modern country music, resulting in a more polished sound. The acoustic guitar was added, mostly as a rhythm instrument, and the triangle provided a traditional percussion. Modern groups sometimes include drums, electric bass, electric guitars and amplified accordion and fiddles. Dance and festivals Cajun music, born from ballads, has transformed to dance music‚Äîwith or without words. The music was essential for small get- togethers on the front porch, an all night house dance known as a \\"bal de maison\\", or a public dance in a dance hall called a fais do-do. There are several variations of Cajun dance: a Cajun one step, also called a Cajun Jig, a Cajun two step, also called a Cajun Jitterbug, and a Cajun Waltz. In mild contrast, zydeco dancing is a syncopated two-step or jitterbug. A Cajun dancer will cover the dance floor while the zydeco dancer will primarily dance in a smaller area. Cajun music can be found predominantly at Louisiana festivals and dance halls, in addition to weddings in Acadiana.

Note that this is a Belgian law and is different from the International Criminal Court, which is a treaty body to try war crimes, and also different from the International Court of Justice, which is a U.N. body to settle disputes between countries. Both of these bodies reside in nearby The Hague, Netherlands, although some have said that American Servicemen's Protection Act passed by the United States was also directed against the War Crimes Law.  Background  The law took effect in 1993 and was expanded the following year after 10 Belgian soldiers were killed in Rwanda. The law reached prominence after the Rwandan genocide. According to the Washington Post, the process of prosecution of Rwandans in Belgium for crimes committed in the violence were set in motion by Martine Beckers, a Brussels resident, whose sister Claire called her to tell her of being attacked by soldiers, who soon after killed her, her family, and 10 other villagers who were unable to reach a United Nations peacekeepers' compound.  Universal jurisdiction  Countries have long claimed jurisdiction over nationals of other countries or suits against countries themselves in matters Civil or criminal where those foreign nationals are alleged to have committed crimes against the complaining country's nationals, or have committed crimes in the complaining country. What made this Belgian law controversial was that it afforded the right to anyone to submit a war crime for prosecution in Belgian courts that occurred anywhere in the world, whether on Belgian territory, and whether a Belgian national was involved as either criminal or victim. This concept called universal jurisdiction, or universal competence, was recently used in Germany to indict high-ranking US officials for their involvement in prisoner abuse in the war on terror under the command responsibility.  Problems with implementation of the law  The law soon ran into trouble when a number of parties worldwide filed cases criticized as politically motivated against leaders of various nations. Over the years filings included cases against American officials, including George H. W. Bush, Dick Cheney, Colin Powell, Norman Schwarzkopf and Tommy Franks. Cases had also been filed against the leaders of many other countries, such as Iraq and Israel, and Cuba's Fidel Castro. The paperwork backing several of these filings was very limited, consisting out of a single fax or several pages. Critics assailed the law as an attempt to circumvent the sovereignty of other states and become a venue for partisan show trials of propaganda value but no legal consequence. Proponents respond by arguing that universal jurisdiction is often the only recourse victims of war crimes have, and that under the UN Charter countries are already obliged to prosecute those involved in war crimes. In an effort by the United States to pressure Belgium, United States Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld threatened to remove the NATO Headquarters from Brussels unless the Law was changed.  Most cases dropped  On 12 July 2003, the incoming government of Prime Minister Guy Verhofstadt announced that scrapping this law would be among the first acts carried out. In September of that year, the Belgian Court of Cassation threw out the cases against the former President Bush and other US officials, as well as Israelis.  Modified law and criticism  Six human rights groups (Amnesty International Belgium, both the Dutch-speaking Human Rights League and the French-speaking Human Rights League of Belgium, the International Federation for Human Rights, Avocats Sans Fronti√®res (Lawyers Without Borders) and Human Rights Watch) called that loss of the universal jurisdiction component \\"a step backwards in the global fight against the worst atrocities.\\" Human Rights Watch outlined the reduced scope of the law: :Belgian courts will only have jurisdiction over international crimes if the accused is Belgian or has his primary residence in Belgium; if the victim is Belgian or has lived in Belgium for at least three years at the time the crimes were committed; or if Belgium is required by treaty to exercise jurisdiction over the case. The new law also considerably reduces victims' ability to obtain direct access to the courts - unless the accused is Belgian or has his primary residence in Belgium, the decision whether to proceed with any complaint rests entirely with the state prosecutor. Court of Arbitration On 21 June 2006, the Constitutional Court of Belgium (called the Court of Arbitration at the time) annulled parts of the modified law which came in place of the Belgian War Crimes Law.

He was born in Montreal of French colonist parents. Early life Pierre Le Moyne was born in July 1661 at Fort Ville-Marie (now Montreal), in the French colony of Canada, the third son of Charles le Moyne de Longueuil et de Ch√¢teauguay, a native of Dieppe or of Longueuil near Dieppe, Normandy in France and lord of Longueuil in Canada, and of Catherine Thierry (called Catherine Primot in some sources) from Rouen.She was baptized at Saint-Denis-la-Petite parish church (now destroyed) He is also known as Sieur d'IbervilleThe name Pierre Le Moyne d'Iberville is pronounced or (). The title Sieur is pronounced (). However, residents of the Mississippi Gulf Coast pronounce the city of D'Iberville, Mississippi as . or Sieur d'Iberville et d'Ardilli√®res. He had eleven brothers, most of whom became soldiers. One, Jacques Le Moyne de Sainte- H√©l√®ne, led French and Indian forces in the Schenectady massacre in present- day New York's Mohawk Valley. Charles le Moyne de Longueuil, Baron de Longueuil, was governor of Montreal. Another, Jean-Baptiste Le Moyne Bienville, founded New Orleans. Jacques and Paul LeMoyne were with him on James Bay, and Joseph LeMoyne was with him in Louisiana. Le Moyne d'Iberville was raised Catholic under the Jesuit order. Parish records indicate that, at the age of 12, he received the religious sacrament of First Communion. D'Iberville received his formal education at a Sulpician seminary, where his academic knowledge was also embedded with religion. Destined for the priesthood, he chose a life of adventure. At the age of 12, he became a cabin boy on his uncle's ship trading to Port Royal, Acadia. A few years later he was in the fur trade at Sault Ste. Marie in Canada, where he would have learned something of canoe travel in the wilderness. He later became quartermaster on one of his father's ships. Hudson Bay expeditions The Hudson's Bay Company was founded in 1670. This company diverted furs away from Quebec and threatened further expansion into French territory. In 1682, the Compagnie du Nord was founded to compete with the English on the Bay. In 1686, the aggressive Governor General Denonville decided to drive out the English even though the two countries were at peace. French forces led by d'Iberville, managed to defeat an English squadron, and capture York Factory during the Battle of Hudson's Bay. Under the command of Pierre de Troyes, Chevalier de Troyes, d'Iberville his brothers Paul and Jacques led the Canadian woodsmen on a 1686 expedition to Hudson Bay. He played a heroic part in the capture of the fort at Moose Factory. At Fort-Rupert, he captured the sloop Craven and killed at least one unarmed sailor. As a result, the French seized all three English posts on James Bay, leaving the English only York Factory which was far to the northwest and inaccessible by land. De Troyes left in August 1686, leaving d'Iberville in charge with 40 men. The following summer, when no supplies arrived, d'Iberville left 12 men at the forts and went first south to Quebec and then to France. In France, he lobbied for the Compagnie and obtained command of Soleil D'Afrique and returned to James Bay in the summer of 1688. There he captured three HBC ships that were trying to re-establish their position on James Bay. Returning to Quebec, he was caught up in King William's War and sent south to attack the British colonies (see below). In July 1690, he left Quebec with three ships in the hope of capturing York Factory. Finding himself outgunned by a larger English ship, he fled south and captured the new HBC base at Fort Severn. In 1692 and 1693, he again planned to attack York Factory, but both times the needed ships were diverted. It was 1694 before he could effect the capture of York Factory. His work was undone when the English recaptured Fort Albany in 1693 and York Factory in 1695. 1695 and 1696 were spent in coastal raiding. In 1697 he captured York Factory a second time after winning his most heroic battle. It was too late in the season to capture Fort Albany, so he left Hudson Bay, never to return. York Factory remained French until 1713. King William's War Avalon Peninsula campaign was a military operation led by d'Iberville, that saw English settlements throughout Newfoundland sacked by French forces. In 1690, he was second in command to his brother Jacques in a raid south to New York that culminated in the Schenectady Massacre. In 1692, he convoyed supply ships from France and harassed English coastal settlements, taking three prizes. In 1694, he returned to Hudson Bay and captured York Factory for the first time. In the spring of 1696, he sailed from France with three ships. Sending one to Quebec, he led the other two to the aid of the governor of Acadia, Joseph Robineau de Villebon, whom the English were blockading at the mouth of the Saint John River. He captured one enemy ship and drove the other two away. He then went 200 miles west and captured the most northerly settlement in New England, Pemaquid (Siege of Pemaquid (1696), 14 August). He then sailed east to Placentia, the French capital of Newfoundland, and began the Avalon Peninsula Campaign on 1 November. On this expedition he captured St. John's and ruined most of the English fishing villages. During four months of raids, Iberville was responsible for the destruction of 36 settlements. The Newfoundland campaign was one of the cruelest and most destructive of Iberville's career. Before he could consolidate his hold on Newfoundland, he was diverted north to capture York Factory for a second time during the summer of 1697. Soon after his departure, the English arrived in Newfoundland with 2,000 troops and restored their position. Hostilities ended with the Treaty of Ryswick in September 1697. Exploring Louisiana In 1682, Ren√©-Robert Cavelier, Sieur de La Salle was the first European to travel from the Great Lakes down the Mississippi River to the Gulf of Mexico. The French began dreaming of building a great empire by linking the Saint Lawrence and Mississippi basins, thereby bottling up the English on the Atlantic coast. This presented diplomatic problems; because the Gulf coast was claimed, but not occupied, by Spain. Pontchartrain, the minister for naval affairs and colonies, gave Iberville the task of locating the mouth of the Mississippi River, which La Salle had failed to find on his last expedition, and building a fort which would block the river to other nations. Iberville left Brest with four ships in October 1698. He sailed along the Florida coast, past the new base the Spanish were building at Pensacola. In March 1699, he entered the Birdfoot Delta. It was only after meeting some Indians who remembered La Salle that he was sure that this was the Mississippi. Having achieved his first aim and finding no good sites in the delta, he built a temporary fort Fort Maurepas at Ocean Springs, Mississippi, left a garrison of 81 men, and returned to France. Depiction of d'Iberville and Cavelier de La Salle exploring Louisiana. On his second voyage he reached Biloxi in January 1700. He built a second \\"Fort Maurepas\\" 40 miles up the Mississippi River. On his return journey, he is said to have stopped at New York City and sold 9,000 furs that coureurs des bois had given him, in preference to hauling them back to Montreal. (This story illustrates the benefits of the future New Orleans area as a port, the size of the French presence on the Mississippi at this early date, and Iberville's rather questionable business practices.) On his third voyage in February 1701, he built a fort at Mobile. Here, Henri de Tonti aided him in establishing good relations with the Indians. He left Louisiana for the last time in April 1702. His brother Jean-Baptiste Le Moyne de Bienville founded New Orleans in 1718. Queen Anne's War and Death In 1702, England and France were again at war (War of the Spanish Succession, 1701‚Äì1714, the North American theater of which was Queen Anne's War). D'Iberville had contracted malaria on the Gulf coast, and both his health and judgment seem to have deteriorated. Early in 1706, he left France in command of twelve vessels. A squadron under Henri-Louis de Chavagnac devastated Saint Kitts. From 1 to 22 April, d'Iberville and Chavagnac devastated the island of Nevis and took the entire population prisoner. He went to Havana, where he was involved in planning an expedition against Charles Town, Carolina (an English colonial settlement), when he died suddenly, perhaps of yellow fever, in July, 1706. D'Iberville was buried at Church of San Crist√≥bal (Havana Cathedral); the burial records identify him under his French name, and as El General Dom Pedro Berbila.http://www.historymuseum.ca/virtual-museum-of-new-france/the- explorers/pierre-le-moyne-diberville-1686-1702/Un h√©ros qu√©b√©cois √† La Havane, Pierre Lahoud, 2015 After his death, his estate became involved in an inquiry that dragged on for more than thirty years. D'Iberville had acquired a large fortune by uncertain means. The accounts of the West Indian expedition were hopelessly disorganized; there were accusations of embezzlement. His widow, Marie Th√©r√®se Pollet (24 March 1672 ‚Äì 1740) was forced to pay back a large part of her inheritance. D'Iberville was perhaps the first great soldier born in Canada. Students of the art of war may see his career as an example of the importance of following up after a victory, for he won all his battles but never was able to consolidate what he had won.
