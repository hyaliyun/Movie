G. Wells in 1897. The story tells of a shop owner, named Mr. Cave, who finds a strange crystal egg that serves as a window into the planet Mars. The story was written the same year in which Wells was serializing The War of the Worlds in Pearson's Magazine, a year before it was published as a novel. Because of the vaguely similar descriptions of the Martians and their machines, \\"The Crystal Egg\\" is often considered a precursor to The War of the Worlds, though there is no clear foreshadowing of the events that transpire in the novel. Story summary Mr. Cave has an antique shop in Seven Dials, a district in the West End of London which, at the time the story was written, was a poor area. He is well educated but is in an unhappy situation. His wife, who is younger, treats him with contempt, as do his stepson and stepdaughter. He is in declining health. He is a friend of Mr. Jacoby Wace, who is Assistant Demonstrator of Anatomy at a nearby teaching hospital and is interested in unusual characters like Mr. Cave. It becomes clear toward the end of the story that the narrator, who plays no part in the events, is an acquaintance of Mr. Wace. Among antique items which have come into Mr. Cave's possession is a crystal egg. Wandering about the shop one night, he notices that a light comes from it. Studying it closely, \\"it gave him the impression that the object had for a moment opened to him the view of a wide and spacious and strange country.\\" He takes the egg to Mr. Wace for safe keeping, after his reluctance to sell it to a customer has exacerbated his relationship with his wife and stepchildren. Mr. Wace is unable to see the view inside the egg as clearly as Mr. Cave, whose fatigued mental state seems to enhance his perception of the vision seen within it. However he believes in Mr. Cave's discovery, and during several sessions he takes notes as Mr. Cave describes what he sees. After a few days Mr. Cave takes the egg home with him between sessions, as the quarrel it caused has subsided; he likes to view the scene within whenever he can. A description of what is seen inside the egg occupies about a third of the story. The crystal egg seems to have a counterpart in another place, through which the strange scenery is visible. The sky, and the two moons sometimes present, suggest that the view is of the planet Mars. The counterpart is one of several crystals on top of masts on a large building, around which there are flying creatures who apparently own it. They sometimes look closely at these crystals, presumably to study a remote scene. Mr. Wace, visiting Mr. Cave's shop after a break of several days caused by pressure of work, is shocked to find that Mr. Cave has died. Some of his stock, including the egg, has been bought by another trader in order to pay for the funeral. This trader, Mr. Wace finds, has sold the egg; the customer, probably unaware of its special properties, cannot be traced. All that remains of the affair are the notes of Mr. Cave's observations. Mr. Wace, and his friend the narrator of the story, are left speculating on the significance of the crystal egg: it seems to have come from Mars, and there may be others like it on Earth, counterparts of the other crystals seen, \\"sent hither from that planet, in order to give the Martians a near view of our affairs.\\" Adaptations *Jorge Luis Borges was inspired by \\"The Crystal Egg\\" for his 1949 stories, \\"El Zahir\\" and \\"The Aleph\\". *In 1952, \\"The Crystal Egg\\" was made into an episode of the science fiction anthology television series Tales of Tomorrow. The episode was a half-hour in length and told in first person narration. The episode is vague as to whether it is set in the 1890s when Wells published his story or in the 1950s when the show was being broadcast. However, since he is recording his story on a phonograph record it is more than likely that it is supposed to be the 1950s. *In Manly Wade Wellman's Sherlock Holmes's War of the Worlds, Alan Moore and Kevin O'Neill's The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen, Volume II and Kevin J. Anderson's The Martian War, Crystal Eggs appear and are used by the Martians to prepare for their invasion by spying on Earth. *In 2001, the Radio Tales series produced the drama \\"Watchers\\", an adaptation of H. G. Wells's story for National Public Radio. *The story was adapted as part of the second episode of the 2001 miniseries, The Infinite Worlds of H. G. Wells. Wells himself appeared as a character, who is inspired to write The War of the Worlds from the events. In the show, the crystal egg comes to Earth as a meteorite and serves as a two-way teleportation gate as well. Cave is divided into two characters, a married couple (William and Rosa); a Martian scientist takes Rosa back to Mars through the egg, before rendering it inoperable. British Intelligence later comes to acquire the egg. *Kim Newman's short story \\"The Red Planet League\\" (collected in Gaslight Grimoire) reinterprets the events of \\"The Crystal Egg\\" as part of an elaborate hoax played by Professor Moriarty on Stent (the Astronomer Royal from The War of the Worlds) after Stent attempted to discredit Moriarty's The Dynamics of an Asteroid. In Newman's story, Cave is actually Moriarty in disguise. *Cubicle 7's Victoriana tabletop role- playing game supplement Faces in the Smoke Volume 1: The Secret Masters. The section \\"The Planetarians\\" is directly based on \\"The Crystal Egg\\". It describes a group of British citizens who are gathered together by a government official to investigate a crystal egg that gives visions of an advanced technological society on the planet Mars. Both Mr. Cave and Mr. Wace are members of the Planetarians.

They are currently a member of the Czech Extraliga. The team president and owner is Jarom√≠r J√°gr, a famous former NHL player, who is currently (2019‚Äì20) playing in home games for the team in addition to his ownership and administrative roles. The team plays its home games at ƒåEZ Stadion Kladno. History Ryt√≠≈ôi Kladno players (2017) Kladno was a particularly strong team in the late 1970s, when it won four consecutive league titles (1975‚Äì1978), and again in 1980. The team's star, Milan Nov√Ω, was league MVP in 1977, 1981, and 1982, and won six scoring titles. Franti≈°ek Posp√≠≈°il was league MVP in 1971 and 1972. Before season 1997/1998 happened what everyone expected for some time, Kladno lost its longtime sponsor, ironworks Hu≈• Poldi. After a long time the Poldi disappeared from Kladno hockey jerseys and the successes that this famous club has achieved in previous years have also disappeared and was de facto always last. Primarily the lack of funds did not allow to management improvement of club cadre and the main coach resigned. Despite the departure of a number of players abroad, Kladno did not go bad after 2003 and celebrated return to the Czech highest-level league. However after the season 2012-13 Kladno performed poorly in the extraliga. Nor the withdrawal of coaches helped, and the co-sponsorship of Rene Burger the team reached the highest league again after the 12 years. Jarom√≠r J√°gr played for his hometown Kladno for parts of four seasons, including during the NHL lockouts in 1994, 2004, and 2012. In January 2018, J√°gr was assigned to HC Kladno after a partial season with the Calgary Flames. During the 2010‚Äì2011 season, the team was docked 6 points for having used players who were not correctly registered to the club, an affair which also involved the clubs BK Mlad√° Boleslav and HC Plze≈à.

New York City's first source of water beyond its city limits, its waters traveled by aqueduct to the Croton Distributing Reservoir in midtown Manhattan. In 1905 the New Croton Dam was completed, expanding the existing impoundment into the New Croton Reservoir, then the largest in the Croton Watershed, and thus one of the largest in the New York City water supply system to that point. It has a 57 square mile (148 km¬≤) drainage basin, is approximately long, and can hold of water at full capacity. Its waters flow into the New Croton Aqueduct, then into the Jerome Park Reservoir in The Bronx.

Its competitors are NOS and Meo. History =As Telecel= Vodafone Portugal was founded in 1991 as Telecel, Comunica√ß√µes Pessoais, S.A. (Telecel). In June 1991, Telecel and TMN applied for licences to operate GSM mobile networks in Portugal, and Telecel won the bid for the second GSM network in October that year. The network went live on 18 October 1992. In 1996, the \\"pre-paid\\" concept was introduced with the launch of the tariff plan Vitamina. Telecel also held a paging license and was leader in the 4-player paging business, using the brand Telechamada. In January 2000, the indirect access fixed-line telephone service was launched, using Portugal Telecom's infrastructures and the 1091 prefix. It used the brands toq 1091 (for home customers; now discontinued in favour of Vodafone at Home/Vodafone Casa) and Voz Pri (for business customers; still used as part of the business solutions). In May of the same year, Telecel entered the Internet Service Provider and web portal businesses under the brand Netc (pronounced \\"netcetera\\"). The business model was lifted from successful Freeserve, a British non-subscription ISP. =From Telecel to Vodafone= The initial group of shareholders was led by Portuguese investment bank Banco Esp√≠rito Santo, Portuguese conglomerate Amorim and USA's Pacific Telesis, owner of mobile operator PacTel Cellular. PacTel Cellular was spun off in 1994 as AirTouch, which in turn merged in 1999 with British operator Vodafone. Thus, Telecel became minority-owned by the Vodafone Group. Telecel was listed on the Euronext-Lisbon Stock Exchange. Banco Esp√≠rito Santo and Amorim used the IPO and subsequent sales to sell out with considerable gains, and the Vodafone Group eventually took a controlling share. In 2003, the Vodafone Group launched a successful tender offer for all outstanding shares not in its possession, thus becoming the full owner of then-called Telecel-Vodafone. The company was definitely renamed Vodafone Portugal and delisted. The CEO since the beginning was Ant√≥nio Carrapatoso. Now, the new CEO is M√°rio Vaz. =As Vodafone= In 2002, when Telecel was already controlled by the Vodafone Group, the parent company decided to implement the Vodafone brand worldwide, in order to achieve synergies and improve brand awareness. Telecel was the first operator to initiate the process. This was achieved in three steps: 1. putting Vodafone after Telecel, thus referring to the company as Telecel Vodafone; 2. after six months, exchanging the order to Vodafone Telecel; and 3. after another six months (already in 2003), dropping the Telecel brand altogether. Throughout the process, market research showed no confusion and no loss of awareness of both the brands and the operator. This had been a concern for Vodafone for Telecel was a top-ten advertiser, which had led to develop a brand with the highest recall indexes. In 2002, the Netc ISP and web portal were rebranded Vizzavi, Vodafone's multimedia brand in association with Vivendi Universal. In 2003, when paging was moribund as mobile phones had become so ubiquitous, the Telechamada business was abandoned and the license was returned to the State. In 2003, the Vizzavi ISP business was sold to competitor IOL, a unit of Portuguese media group Media Capital, and the web portal was closed down as Vodafone live! was launched. In 2006, Vodafone Portugal disconnected the Cell Broadcast service. In August 2007, Vodafone Portugal launches Duplex ADSL service with ADSL2+ technology. In September 2009, Vodafone Portugal launches Vodafone Casa TV an IPTV service. In June 2010, Vodafone Portugal launches fibre FTTH offer with television and Internet at speeds up to 300 Mbit/s. In July 2015, Vodafone Portugal starts offering a 4K (Ultra HD) television channel to its TV-over-fibre customers. Vodafone Portugal is also the first European operator to reach speeds of 600 Mbit/s on its mobile network, using the new functions offered by the evolution of 4G+ (LTE-Advanced) mobile internet technology. In September 2015, Vodafone Portugal becomes the first TV operator in the world to launch a service for smart watches. Customers of Vodafone's TV service are now able to watch TV channels live on their wrists. Vodafone Portugal starts offering VoLTE and is the first operator in Portugal to offer VoLTE, the most advanced 4G voice technology.

Latigo Ranch was founded as a dude ranch in Grand County, Colorado by Frederick Kasdorf, Jr. It was originally named Snowshoe Ranch. Kasdorf single-handedly built the Main Log Lodge in 1923 soon after he and his wife arrived (by covered wagon from Denver) to homestead in the Kremmling area. He built up and ran the Snowshoe Dude Ranch for over 30 years. Grand County Historical Society speculates that Zane Grey stayed at the Snowshoe Ranch or at least camped nearby while he wrote The Mysterious Rider as the Kasdorfs did say in their advertisements that \\"guests could ride 'forest-Indian' trails that Theodore Roosevelt and Zane Grey knew\\"! In 1959, Kasdorf sold the dude ranch operation and headed into retirement. The Christiansons bought the which included the Lodge, and they added a few cabins and continued the ranching operation. Jack and Dot Lyons bought Snowshoe in 1973, and they sold it to Cece and Sharon Krewson in 1977. He sold it in 1982 to David Wasserstrom of Pennsylvania who, with Bill and Carol Hillier as managers, bought the balance of the original Kasdorf ranch, and making many contemporary improvements, changed the name to Latigo Ranch. Their improvements included construction of a new access road into the ranch, addition of the Social Club, swimming pool, fishing pond, barn and arena, and 3 duplex guest cabins. They sold the ranch in 1987 to Randy and Lisa George and Jim and Kathie Yost. As of 2017, the Yosts went into retirement and currently, Randy and Lisa George as well as their children run and manage the ranch full time.

The group is popular in its home town of Chicago, Illinois. As of June 2006, an international television series is being developed with Rubber Duck Entertainment, producers of Peppa Pig. In January 2008, ten Bzots music videos were acquired for broadcast by Nicktoons Network. Summary Bzots is a series about three assembly line robots who escaped from the oppressive factories of Globocrud, the world's largest corporation, to follow their dreams of becoming a band. There are three members in Bzots: Skree (guitar), Bdonk (bass guitar) and Wkewke (DJ). Each robot has his own recurring schtick. Skree can't stop playing guitar solos. Bdonk is easily confused, and Wkewke breaks out with crazy record scratching antics at random times. At live shows, the Bzots are accompanied by a troupe of female hip-hop dancers, the Bzettes. The characters are styled after urban vinyl figures, and their musical style has been compared to Beck and They Might Be Giants. Characters =Skree= An obnoxious yellow welding robot with a flame job who plays guitar. =Wkewke= Pronounced wiki wiki. A green painting robot and unflappable DJ. =Bdonk= Created by Skree and Wkewke from a pile of scrap, Bdonk is the childlike bassist. His intelligence is limited, but he often knows more than Skree and Wkewke. =Oil Change Guy= Bzots' friend who lives and works in a garage on the outskirts of Phantburg. He provides the Bzots with free oil changes and allows them to live in his garage. =Sue Oliphant= A fan of the band who always invites the Bzots to play at her party but never tells them where she lives. =Exalted Sir Cleve Crud, Ph.D., Esq., CEO, Globocrud LLC= The megalomaniacal CEO of the world's largest corporation, Globocrud, which creates products used by everyone who has ever been born, eaten, breathed, slept, metabolized, gone to school, relaxed, conducted any sort of business in any country, laughed, cried, relieved him/herself in any way, or died. =Agents 12, 13, 14 ,15 and 16= In a clear tip of the hat to The Matrix, the Bzots are pursued by at least 5 agents wearing dark suits and dark sunglasses. Their objective is to capture Bzots and return them to the factories of Globocrud, from which they escaped. These agents all have authority over the bumbling Agent 17. =Agent 17= A field operative in the form of a life-sized spark plug. He remains in constant contact with Agents 12, 13, 14, 15, and 16 and does their bidding. =The Kids= Globocrud has no qualms about using child labor. The Kids are never shown working, but nonetheless populate the factories of Globocrud in large numbers. It is suspected that the kids worked behind the scenes to facilitate the Bzots' escape from the factory. =The Products= Globocrud's products have an antagonistic relationship with the Bzots, jeering the Bzots as they toil.

In Arabic, it means the home (Kfar: ŸÉŸÅÿ±) of the hawk (Akab: ÿπŸÇÿßÿ®). The village, which is located in the Matn District of the Mount Lebanon Governorate, is of particular significance because it is one of the various historic points of origin of the well known Maalouf family. It was founded c. 1560 AD when three families of the Maalouf clan, living at the time across the valley in the village of Mhaydse, received permission from the ruling emir to establish the village. The Maalouf family history is traced back to the very beginnings of Christianity in the Middle East beginning with the Ghassanid tribe, which converted to Christianity nearly 2,000 years ago. The family name is now widespread worldwide. Family lineages are detailed and well preserved, and conferences and a sense of family pride still preserve traditions, reunions, and culture. The preservation effort has the intent of documenting every known person bearing the Maalouf name. All Maalouf families originate from Kafarakab. The village is of no great size, consisting of only a few dozen old homes built on terraced mountainsides lined with grape vineyards and many varieties of fruit trees. The population swells during the summer as people leave the heat of the Lebanese coastline for the freshness of the mountains. Its weather is moderate, with temperatures ranging near 70 F (25 C) in the summer, and near 30 F (0 C) in the winter season. Snowfall is common in the winter, with snow accumulations reaching 3 to 4 feet (1 meter). The population follows the Christian faith, divided between Antiochian Eastern-Orthodox, Antiochian Oriental-Orthodox and Melkite. The local St. Mary church is separated into two halves, one for each faith. The scenic view is perhaps the most notable aspect of this red terra cotta rooftop cluster - including a view of the snow-capped Lebanon mountains to the east, and the Mediterranean sea and the city of Beirut to the west. The village sits at an elevation about 3,600 ft. (1,100 m) just below the village of Baskinta and the towering Mount Sannine. Its distance to Beirut is approximately 40 km, or approximately 1 hour of driving. Its GPS coordinates are From Kfarakab, the Maalouf clan migrated within Lebanon to Zahl√© and Niha in the Bekaa Valley where it became one of the most prominent families in these villages. The migration continued in the late 1800s and 1900s to Brazil, the United States of America and Canada where the family prospered and has become known in many spheres of influence.

Contributions Andrey Korotayev has made important contributions to the following fields. =Mathematical modeling and Cliodynamics= The Allegory of Painting by Johannes Vermeer Global dynamics In this field he has proposed one of the most convincing mathematical explanations for von Foerster's Doomsday Equation. In collaboration with his colleagues, Artemy Malkov and Daria Khaltourina, he has shown that till the 1970s the hyperbolic growth of the world population was accompanied by quadratic-hyperbolic growth of the world GDP, and developed a number of mathematical models describing both of these phenomena simultaneously; he has also described mathematically the World System withdrawal from the blow-up regime observed in the recent decades.See, e.g., Korotayev A., Malkov A., Khaltourina D. Introduction to Social Macrodynamics: Compact Macromodels of the World System Growth. Moscow: URSS Publishers, 2006. The hyperbolic growth of the world population and quadratic-hyperbolic growth of the world GDP observed till the 1970s have been correlated by him and his colleagues to a non-linear second order positive feedback between the demographic growth and technological development that can be spelled out as follows: technological growth ‚Äì increase in the carrying capacity of land for people ‚Äì demographic growth ‚Äì more people ‚Äì more potential inventors ‚Äì acceleration of technological growth ‚Äì accelerating growth of the carrying capacity ‚Äì the faster population growth ‚Äì accelerating growth of the number of potential inventors ‚Äì faster technological growth ‚Äì hence, the faster growth of the Earth's carrying capacity for people, and so on.See, e.g., Korotayev A., Malkov A., Khaltourina D.

J. Astrobiology 7 (2008) 177‚Äì182. As Francis Heylighen puts it, \\"an elegant example is the explanation by Korotayev of the hyperbolic growth of the world population until 1960. In the model, population growth is initially modeled by a traditional logistic growth equation, where population N starts by growing exponentially but then slows down until it reaches the maximum value expressed by the carrying capacity of the environment. This carrying capacity is proportional to the overall productivity of technology, i.e. its ability to extract from the natural environment the resources necessary for survival. In a second equation, the growth of technological productivity is considered to be proportional to the technology that is already there (simple exponential growth), but also to the population number, under the simple assumption that more individuals will discover more innovations. The authors shows that the two equations together produce a hyperbolic growth curve that mimics the observed historical growth of world population with a surprising accuracy (explaining over 99% of the variation for the period 500 BC‚Äì1962)\\" (). He has also shown that the world urban population growth curve has also up till recently followed a quadratic-hyperbolic pattern.Introduction to Social Macrodynamics: Secular Cycles and Millennial Trends.

P. 44-62 In addition, Korotayev and his colleagues have proposed a number of forecasts of the World System development up to 2100.Korotayev A., Zinkina J.

Social and biological macroevolution During the Phanerozoic the biodiversity shows a steady but not monotonic increase from near zero to several thousands of genera. In collaboration with Alexander V. Markov he has demonstrated that a similar mathematical model can be developed to describe the macrotrends of biological evolution. They have shown that changes in biodiversity through the Phanerozoic correlate much better with hyperbolic model (widely used in demography and macrosociology) than with exponential and logistic models (traditionally used in population biology and extensively applied to fossil biodiversity as well). The latter models imply that changes in diversity are guided by a first-order positive feedback (more ancestors, more descendants) and/or a negative feedback arising from resource limitation. Hyperbolic model implies a second-order positive feedback. The hyperbolic pattern of the world population growth has been demonstrated by Korotayev to arise from a second-order positive feedback between the population size and the rate of technological growth. According to Korotayev and Markov, the hyperbolic character of biodiversity growth can be similarly accounted for by a feedback between the diversity and community structure complexity. They suggest that the similarity between the curves of biodiversity and human population probably comes from the fact that both are derived from the interference of the hyperbolic trend with cyclical and stochastic dynamics. Finally, Korotayev has demonstrated that the hyperbolic models of this type may be used to describe in a rather accurate way the overall growth of the planetary complexity of the Earth since 4 billion BC up to the present.The 21st Century Singularity and its Big History Implications: A re-analysis. Journal of Big History 2/3 (2018): 71 - 118. Cliodynamics and the study of the Arab Spring Cairo. In the field of cliodynamics, Korotayev has developed a number of mathematical models of interaction between the very long-term, \\"millennial\\" hyperbolic trend dynamics of social systems and the shorter-term, \\"secular\\" (that is, observed at the scale of centuries), cyclical dynamics. The \\"Day of Revolt\\" on 25 January 2011 in Cairo He has also produced a number of mathematical models describing specifically long-term political-demographic dynamics of EgyptKorotayev A.V., Khaltourina D.A.

Korotayev was one of the first to predict and assess the June 2013 Egyptian protests.http://polit.ru/article/2013/06/29/revolutions/; see also Egyptian coup of 2013: an ‚Äòeconometric‚Äô analysis.

Note also his study of 2013-2014 revolutionary wave and his interpretation of the Arab Spring events as a trigger of a global \\"phase transition\\". Of special importance is his study of the hypothesis that population pressure causes increased warfare. This hypothesis has been recently criticised on the empirical grounds. Both studies focusing on specific historical societies and analyses of cross-cultural data have failed to find positive correlation between population density and incidence of warfare. Korotayev, in collaboration with Peter Turchin, has shown that such negative results do not falsify the population-warfare hypothesis.Population Dynamics and Internal Warfare: A Reconsideration . Social Evolution & History 5/2 (2006): 112‚Äì147. Population and warfare are dynamical variables, and if their interaction causes sustained oscillations, then we do not in general expect to find strong correlation between the two variables measured at the same time (that is, unlagged). Korotayev and Turchin have explored mathematically what the dynamical patterns of interaction between population and warfare (focusing on internal warfare) might be in both stateless and state societies. Next, they have tested the model predictions in several empirical case studies: early modern England, Han and Tang China, and the Roman Empire. Their empirical results have supported the population- warfare theory: Korotayev and Turchin have found that there is a tendency for population numbers and internal warfare intensity to oscillate with the same period but shifted in phase (with warfare peaks following population peaks). Furthermore, they have demonstrated that in the agrarian societies the rates of change of the two variables behave precisely as predicted by the theory: population rate of change is negatively affected by warfare intensity, while warfare rate of change is positively affected by population density.Population Dynamics and Internal Warfare: A Reconsideration . Social Evolution & History 5/2 (2006): 112‚Äì147; see also Korotayev A., Malkov A., Khaltourina D. Introduction to Social Macrodynamics. Secular Cycles and Millennial Trends. Moscow: URSS, 2006; Korotayev A.V., Khaltourina D.A. Introduction to Social Macrodynamics: Secular Cycles and Millennial Trends in Africa. Moscow: URSS, 2006. ; note that these findings are relevant for the preindustrial social systems only. As Kohler and Reed put it, Korotayev and Turchin have demonstrated that \\"human population movements and sociopolitical strife play the roles of sometimes endogenous, sometimes exogenous, factors that on small spatial scales may seem inexplicable but which on longer temporal and wider spatial scales may have understandable rhythms\\".Kohler, Timothy A., and Charles Reed.

Thus, Korotayev has demonstrated that the Malthusian trap tends to generate sociopolitical upheavals. On the other hand, he has shown that the escape from the Malthusian trap is accompanied by another \\"trap\\" generating new sociopolitical upheavals (what he calls \\"a trap at the escape from the trap\\").See, e.g., Egyptian Revolution: A Demographic Structural Analysis.

Russian demographic crisis \\"Russian Cross\\"; the black curve reflects the death rate dynamics, the red one corresponds to the birth rate (per thousand) \\"Russian Cross\\"; the black curve reflects the death rate dynamics, the red one corresponds to the birth rate (per thousand) In collaboration with Daria Khaltourina he has made a significant contribution to the study of the factors of the current Russian demographic crisis. They have demonstrated that post- Soviet Russia experiences one of the world's highest prevalence of alcohol- related problems, which contributes to high mortality rates in this region. Reduction in alcohol-related problems in Russia can have strong effects on mortality decline. They have analysed the plausibility of application of general principles of alcohol policy translated in the Russian Federation. Korotayev and Khaltourina have shown that alcohol policy approaches could be implemented in the same ways as they have been in other countries, and contributed to the development of alcohol control measures in this country. In addition, according to Korotayev, there should be special attention to decreasing distilled spirits consumption, illegal alcohol production, nonbeverage alcohol consumption, and enforcement of current governmental regulations.See, e.g., Korotayev A., Khaltourina D.

Literacy and the Spirit of Capitalism Korotayev and his colleagues have demonstrated that Protestantism has indeed influenced positively the capitalist development of respective social systems not so much through the \\"Protestant ethics\\" (as was suggested by Max Weber) but rather through the promotion of literacy.Korotayev A., Malkov A., Khaltourina D. (2006), Introduction to Social Macrodynamics, Moscow: URSS, (Chapter 6: Reconsidering Weber: Literacy and \\"the Spirit of Capitalism\\" ). P.87-91. 150px They draw attention to the fact that the ability to read was essential for Protestants (unlike Catholics) to perform their religious duty ‚àí to read the Bible. The reading of Holy Scripture was not necessary for Catholic laymen. The edict of the Council of Toulouse (1229) prohibited Catholic laity from possessing copies of the Bible. Soon after that, a decision by the Council of Tarragona spread this prohibition to ecclesiastic people as well. In 1408, the Oxford Synod absolutely prohibited translations of the Holy Scripture. From the very beginning, Protestant groups did not accept this prohibition. Thus, Luther translated in 1522‚Äì1534 first the New Testament, and then the Old Testament, into German, so that any German-speaking person could read the Holy Scripture in his or her native language. Moreover, the Protestants viewed reading the Holy Scripture as a religious duty of any Christian. As a result, the level of literacy and education was, in general, higher for Protestants than it was for Catholics and for followers of other confessions that did not provide religious stimuli for learning literacy. Literate populations have many more opportunities to obtain and use the achievements of modernisation than illiterate ones and display greater innovative-activity levels, which correspond with opportunities for modernisation, development, and economic growth. Empirical tests performed by Korotayev and his colleagues have confirmed the presence of a rather strong and highly significant correlation between the early introduction of mass literacy and subsequent high rates of capitalist economic development.Korotayev A., Malkov A., Khaltourina D. (2006), Introduction to Social Macrodynamics, Moscow: URSS, (Chapter 6: Reconsidering Weber: Literacy and \\"the Spirit of Capitalism\\" ). P.88-91. =World-system analysis= The 11th century World System Andrey Korotayev claims that the present-day world- system (\\"the World System\\"), which in the 2nd millennium CE encompassed the whole globe, originated in the 9th millennium BCE in direct connection with the Neolithic revolution. According to Korotayev, the centre of this system was originally in West Asia. In general, Korotayev and his colleagues have suggested a rather novel approach to the world-system analysis. Within this approach the main emphasis is moved to the generation and diffusion of innovations. If a society borrows systematically important technological innovations, its evolution already cannot be considered as really independent, but should rather be considered as a part of a larger evolving entity, within which such innovations are systematically produced and diffused. The main idea of the world-system approach was to find the evolving unit. The basic idea was that it is impossible to account for the evolution of a single society without taking into consideration that it was a part of a larger whole. However, traditional world-system analysis concentrated on bulk-good movements, and core ‚Äì periphery exploitation, somehow neglecting the above-mentioned dimension. However, according to Korotayev, the information network turns out to be the oldest mechanism of the World System integration, and remained extremely important throughout its whole history, remaining important up to the present. It seems to be even more important than the core ‚Äì periphery exploitation (for example, without taking this mechanism into consideration it appears impossible to account for such things as the demographic explosion in the 20th century, whose proximate cause was the dramatic decline of mortality, but whose main ultimate cause was the diffusion of innovations produced almost exclusively within the World System core). This also suggests a redefinition of the World System core. Within the approach in question the core is not the World System zone, which exploits other zones, but rather the World System core is the zone with the highest innovation donor/recipient ratio, the principal innovation donor. Hyperbolic trend of the world population growth Korotayev suggests that the hyperbolic trend observed for the world population growth after 10000 BCE does appear to be primarily a product of the growth of the World System.Articles from journals The presence of the hyperbolic trend itself indicates that the major part of the entity in question had some systemic unity, and Korotayev insists that the evidence for this unity is readily available. Indeed, he shows that we have evidence for the systematic spread of major innovations (domesticated cereals, cattle, sheep, goats, horses, plow, wheel, copper, bronze, and later iron technology, and so on) throughout the whole North African ‚Äì Eurasian Oikumene for a few millennia BCE. As a result, the evolution of societies of this part of the world already at this time cannot be regarded as truly independent. By the end of the 1st millennium BCE we observe a belt of cultures, stretching from the Atlantic to the Pacific, with an astonishingly similar level of cultural complexity characterised by agricultural production of wheat and other specific cereals, the breeding of cattle, sheep, and goats; use of the plow, iron metallurgy, and wheeled transport; development of professional armies and cavalries deploying rather similar weapons; elaborate bureaucracies, and Axial Age ideologies, and so on ‚Äì this list could be extended for pages. A few millennia before, we would find another belt of societies strikingly similar in level and character of cultural complexity, stretching from the Balkans up to the Indus Valley outskirts. Korotayev interprets this as a tangible result of the World System's functioning.Korotayev A. V.

Great Divergence and Great Convergence Together with Leonid Grinin he has also made a significant contribution to the current Great Divergence debate.Great Divergence and Great Convergence. A Global Perspective (Springer, 2015, with Leonid Grinin). As is noted by Jack Goldstone, the \\"new view, carefully presented and rigorously modeled by Grinin and Korotayev, provides a richer and more nuanced version of the \\"Great Divergence,\\" bridging many of the differences between the traditional and California viewpoints. Yet they go further. Amazingly, by building a model using human capital (education), global population growth, and regional productivity, they show how both the Great Divergence and the recent \\"Great Convergence\\" (the economic catching up of developing countries) are phases of the same process of global modernisation.\\" In addition, Korotayev's research has revealed a close coupling between phases of global demographic transition and phases of the Great Divergence and Great Convergence.Korotayev A. et al. Phases of global demographic transition correlate with phases of the Great Divergence and Great Convergence. Technological Forecasting and Social Change. Volume 95, June 2015, Page 163. Kondratieff waves A rough schematic drawing showing the \\"World Economy\\" over time according to the Kondratiev theory Note also his research on Kondratiev waves in the world GDP dynamics that, employing spectral analysis, has confirmed their presence at an acceptable level of statistical significance.Korotayev, Andrey V., & Tsirel, Sergey V.(2010). A Spectral Analysis of World GDP Dynamics: Kondratieff Waves, Kuznets Swings, Juglar and Kitchin Cycles in Global Economic Development, and the 2008‚Äì2009 Economic Crisis. Structure and Dynamics. Vol.4. No. 1. P.3-57. Referring to this article, John A. Mathews notes: \\"The Russian polymath Andrey Korotayev together with his collaborator Sergey Tsirel has recently revived the study of long waves (or K-waves, after Kondratiev (Kondratieff)) by subjecting the time series to spectral analysis ‚Äì thereby providing solid proof that these waves exist\\" (The renewable energies technology surge: A new techno-economic paradigm in the making? Working Papers in Technology Governance and Economic Dynamics. The Other Canon Foundation, Norway. 2012. No. 44. P. 6. Note 6) He has also detected Kondratieff waves in the global dynamics of invention activities. General theory of social macroevolution In addition, it appears necessary to maintain that Korotayev's theory of the World System development suggests a novel approach to the formation of a general theory of social macroevolution. The approach prevalent in social evolutionism is based on the assumption that evolutionary regularities of simple systems are significantly simpler than the ones characteristic of complex systems. A rather logical outcome of this almost self-evident assumption is that one should first study the evolutionary regularities of simple systems and only after understanding them move to more complex ones, whereas Korotayev's findings suggest that the simplest regularities accounting for extremely large proportions of all the macrovariation can be found precisely for the largest possible system ‚Äì the human world, and, hence, the study of social evolution should proceed from the detection of simple regularities of the development of the most complex systems to the study of the complex laws of the dynamics of simple social systems.Korotayev A. V. A Compact Macromodel of World System Evolution.Journal of World-Systems Research 11/1 (2005): 79‚Äì93 ; Korotayev A., Malkov A., Khaltourina D. (2006). Introduction to Social Macrodynamics: Compact Macromodels of the World System Growth. Moscow: KomKniga. =Cross- cultural studies= Religions of the world From a complexity perspective Korotayev's establishes a key point, that of the bifurcations of social and kinship organisation that coalesced historically around the differential practices of the major world religions. It draws on the World Cultural database and the world religion as well as other variables. The Murdockian comparative approach, up to Korotayev, had developed to the point where the nonindependence of cultures was well-recognized, and ways of taking the larger configurations of cultural systems into account had been reckoned to lie, in the latest iteration, along lines of high-order proto-linguistic communities. Korotayev demonstrates the effects of breaking what might be seen as a ritual taboo of Murdockian comparison: Thou Shalt Not Code World Religion. By doing so, Korotayev releases the Murdockian spell that lingers over the comparative approach in anthropology, and goes on to demonstrate the powerful effects of world religious communities ‚Äî dating from what Jaspers calls the \\"Axial Age\\" (800‚Äì200 BCE) ‚Äì on the preservation and differentiation of distinctive social and political structures in Eurasia. His introduction and conclusion suggest that an objectivist natural history approach to human history, in which subjective factors are of local importance but fade out in terms of lasting effects over generations, is a valid approach to the \\"pre-Axial\\" condition of human societies, while a subjectivist history of consciousness is a necessary complement to the \\"post-Axial\\" condition. Korotayev succeeds in placing these two complementary approaches in context and showing their linkages in terms of how subjective and religious factors play out in human history alongside objective factors such as demography and ecology, each informing the other. He shows how it is impossible to arrive at valid inferential results from comparative approaches without an integration of the two, a situation he aptly calls \\"Galton's opportunity\\" for those are of century-old critiques of the comparative method. The reader will be surprised at the depth of empirical comparative findings in this short book. Following Murray Leaf's Man, Mind and Science (1974) this work is a major contribution to repair of the material/ideational rift in anthropology. Matrilocal vs. patrilocal residence Snake Goddess ‚Äì Heraklion Archaeological Museum. One of his particular contributions in this field is connected with the classical anthropological issue of determinants of matrilocal versus patrilocal postmarital residence. Early theories explaining the determinants of postmarital residence (e.g., Lewis Henry Morgan, Edward Tylor, or George Peter Murdock) connected it with the sexual division of labour. However, to the moment when Korotayev's research in this field began, cross-cultural tests of this hypothesis using worldwide samples had failed to find any significant relationship between these two variables. Korotayev's tests have shown that the female contribution to subsistence does correlate significantly with matrilocal residence in general; however, this correlation is masked by a general polygyny factor. Although an increase in the female contribution to subsistence tends to lead to matrilocal residence, it also tends simultaneously to lead to general non-sororal polygyny which effectively destroys matrilocality. If this polygyny factor is controlled (e. g., through a multiple regression model), division of labour turns out to be a significant predictor of postmarital residence. Thus, Murdock's hypotheses regarding the relationships between the sexual division of labour and postmarital residence were basically correct, though, as has been shown by Korotayev, the actual relationships between those two groups of variables are more complicated than he expected.See, e.g., Korotayev A. Form of marriage, sexual division of labor, and postmarital residence in cross-cultural perspective: A reconsideration. Journal of anthropological research . 2003, Vol. 59, No. 1, pp. 69‚Äì89, . Myths, genes, and deep history Korotayev was also one of the pioneers (together with his colleagues) of the study of correlation between spatial distributions of folklore-mythological motifsKorotayev A., Berezkin Yu., Kozmin A., Arkhipova A.Return of the White Raven: Postdiluvial Reconnaissance Motif A2234.1.1 Reconsidered // Journal of American Folklore 119: 472‚Äì520. and genetic markers,See, e.g., \\"Midwest-Amazonian\\" Folklore- Mythological Parallels?.

As is noticed by Julien d'Huy et al., \\"Korotayev and KhaltourinaMyths and Genes. A Deep Historical Reconstruction. Moscow: Librokom/URSS, 2011. showed statistical correlation between spatial distributions of mythological motifs and genetic markers, considerably above the 4,000 km... Such correlations allow us to reconstruct in detail the mythology... brought to the New World from South Siberia by three Paleolithic migration waves\\".d'Huy, J., Le Quellec, J.

Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America. https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.1714884114 Unilineal descent and Christianization The Baptism of Kievans, a fresco by Viktor Vasnetsov. Korotayev studies variables that are usually regarded as the main causes of the decline of unilineal descent organisation (statehood, class stratification and commercialisation), along with a variable that had never been regarded as such a cause ‚Äì deep Christianization. He postulates that the traditionally accepted causes of the decline of unilineal descent organisation (statehood, class stratification, commercialisation) are less significant than deep Christianization. He also theorises that the presence of unilineal descent groups correlates negatively with communal democracy and is especially strong for complex traditional societies. Korotayev concludes that, because the communal democracy correlates positively with the supracommunal one, the Christianization of Europe might have contributed to the development of modern democracy by helping to destroy unilineal descent organisation in this region. =Sociopolitical systems in the Middle East and Africa= Origins of parallel-cousin marriage and the Afrasian Instability Zone Islamization, along with an area's inclusion in the 8th-century Arab-Islamic Khalifate (and its persistence within the Islamic world) has been demonstrated by Korotayev to be a strong and significant predictor of parallel cousin (Father's Brother's Daughter ‚Äì FBD) marriage. He has shown that while there is a clear functional connection between Islam and FBD marriage, the prescription to marry a FBD does not appear to be sufficient to persuade people to actually marry thus, even if the marriage brings with it economic advantages. According to Korotayev, a systematic acceptance of parallel-cousin marriage took place when Islamization occurred together with Arabization. This research further led to the discovery of the so-called Afrasian Instability Zone. Yemeni Studies Yemen. Korotayev has made a special contribution in this field by detecting principal trends in the evolution of Yemeni cultures through application of quantitative methods to the analysis of mass epigraphic sources in the Sabaic language.E.g., Sabaean Cultural-Political Area: Some General Trends of Evolution. Proceedings of the Seminar for Arabian Studies. 23 (1993): 49‚Äì60. Korotayev has thereby discovered the phenomenon of consolidation of the clan organisation in North-East Yemen in the late 1st millennium BCE as well as the transition from chiefdoms to tribes in early medieval Yemen.See his Ancient Yemen, Oxford, Oxford University Press, 1994; and his Pre-Islamic Yemen, Wiesbaden, Harrassowitz Verlag, 1995. He was also the first to provide convincing evidence for the existence of matrilineal descent organisation in Pre-Islamic ArabiaKorotayev A. V. \\"Were There Any Truly Matrilineal Lineages in the Arabian Peninsula?\\" Proceedings of the Seminar for Arabian Studies 25 (1995); pp. 83‚Äì98. and to suggest an adequate translation of the largest Qatabanic inscription, R 3566.Socio-Political Conflict in the Qatabanian Kingdom?

African Studies Simplified climatic map of Africa. The numbers shown correspond to the dates of all Iron Age artefacts associated with the Bantu expansion. Korotayev and his colleagues have also made significant contributions to the study of political-demographic dynamics in Subsaharan Africa, especially, the problems of the Tropical African countries' escape from the Malthusian trap. Origins of Islam Korotayev has also done (together with his colleagues Vladimir Klimenko and Dmitry Proussakov) a significant contribution to the study of the origins of Islam. Korotayev and his colleagues view the origins of Islam against the background of the 6th century Arabian socioecological crisis whose model is specified by Korotayev and his colleagues through the study of climatological, seismological, volcanological and epidemiological history of the period. They find that most sociopolitical systems of the Arabs reacted to the socioecological crisis by getting rid of the rigid supratribal political structures (kingdoms and chiefdoms) which started posing a real threat to their very survival. The decades of fighting which led to the destruction of the most of the Arabian kingdoms and chiefdoms (reflected in Ayyam al-'Arab tradition) led to the elaboration of some definite \\"antiroyal\\" freedom-loving tribal ethos. At the beginning of the 7th century a tribe which would recognise themselves as subjects of some terrestrial supratribal political authority, a \\"king\\", risked to lose its honour. However, this seems not to be applicable to the authority of another type, the \\"celestial\\" one. At the meantime the early 7th century evidences the merging of the Arabian tradition of prophecy and the Arabian Monotheist \\"Rahmanist\\" tradition which produced \\"the Arabian prophetic movement\\". Al-Masjid al-Nabawi (the Mosque of the Prophet) in Medina, Saudi Arabia, is the site of Muhammad's tomb. According to Korotayev, the Monotheist \\"Rahmanist\\" prophets appear to have represented a supratribal authority just of the type many Arab tribes were looking for at this very time, which seems to explain to a certain extent those prophets' political success (including the extreme political success of Muhammad).

The series, about a contemporary family sucked by a vortex back to the Stone Age was intended to be educational as well as entertaining, demonstrating the early human uses of fire, clothing, weapons and cooking. Plot Science professor John Butler and his family - wife Kim, teenage daughter Katie, young son Greg (the siblings always go barefoot), and dog Digger - are on a rafting trip along the Amazon River when their raft hits a rock and capsizes. They are swept through a cavern and caught in a whirlpool; upon resurfacing, they find themselves in a mysterious realm where humans coexist with various prehistoric creatures, including dinosaurs. The Butlers meet and befriend a clan of Neanderthals led by: Gorok; his wife Gara; their teenage son Lok; and their young daughter Tana. Gorok and his family have a pet of their own, a baby Stegosaurus named Glump. Gorok and Company aid the Butlers' efforts to find a means of returning home; for their own part, John and his family do what they can to make the Neanderthals' daily lives easier. (Examples of such included introducing Gorok's family to basic technology, such as simple machines - particularly the lever and the wheel - sailboats and windmills.)

He was a member of the powerful Roman family of the Orsini. Biography Orsini was Archbishop of Naples from 1400 until 1405, when he was made a Cardinal by Innocent VII. In 1408 he abandoned the \\"Roman Obedience\\" and attended the Council of Pisa. He was subsequently administrator of the see of P√©cs 1409‚Äì10, and legate of Antipope John XXIII in Spain, Picenum and Bologna. Promoted to the suburbicarian see of Albano in 1412, he had a considerable role in the Council of Constance, where he presided over the fifth session. He was the papal legate appointed to establish peace between England and France in 1418. Grand penitentiary from 1419. In 1420, he was named Abbot Commendatory of the Imperial Abbey of Farfa.G.

Archpriest of patriarchal Vatican Basilica from 1434 until his death. He is buried in a tomb in St. Peter's Basilica in Rome. Patron of the arts Orsini's status put him in a position to be a major patron of the arts,W.A.

Mode, \\"The Orsini Sala Theatri at Monte Giordano in Rome\\" Renaissance Quarterly 26.2 (Summer 1973), pp. 167-172. how the scholars would gather, dressed in antique robes, to discuss topics of human conduct in Classical and Christian terms. This patron of artists and scholars assembled a library that comprised 244 manuscripts, which passed at his death intact to the Vatican Library. His seat was the fortress-palazzo crowning \\"Monte Giordano\\", a small rise south-east of the Ponte Sant'Angelo, which had been built in the twelfth century by the Roncioni, and had been converted and extended into a palatial complex by the Orsini.Mode 1973:168. Around 1430, Orsini built in the palazzo a sala teatri for his humanistic gatherings; it was the first permanent indoor theatre built in the Renaissance. Its walls were painted with an audience of illustrious personages of history, painted full-length in a cavalcade, row upon row, three hundred figures by the time the frescoes were completed, winding their way down the walls. Such a grand scheme was beyond the powers of Roman painters, whose skills and workshops had diminished during the Avignon Papacy, when the sources of patronage were removed from Rome. The Cardinal turned to the Florentine Masolino da Panicale, currently at work in Rome. The young Paolo Uccello also played a part in the enterprise.; Mode 1973:169ff. Among Orsini's friends was the Danish cartographer Claudius Clavus who lived in Rome. The humanist circle disbanded when Giordano Orsini followed Pope Eugenius IV into voluntary exile from Rome in 1434.

Its formula is Na2B4O7¬∑5H2O or Na2[B4O5(OH)4]¬∑3H2O. Tincalconite typically occurs as a fine grained white powder. It crystallizes in the hexagonal crystal system and has been found as primary euhedral di-rhombohedral, pseudo- octahedral crystals. It is also found pseudomorphically replacing borax crystals. It has a specific gravity of 1.88 and a Mohs hardness of 2. Refractive index values are nœâ=1.460 and nŒµ=1.470. While most tincalconite is created by man through exposing borax to dry air, there are natural occurrences of tincalconite, as in Searles Lake, California where it was first described in 1878. In addition to several California and Nevada locations it is reported from Argentina, Italy, Turkey and Ukraine.

It was set up by the Soviet and Polish Communist authorities in Potulice in place of the former Nazi German Potulice concentration camp (known as the Ostjugendbewahrlager Potulitz or Lebrechtsdorf camp), the subcamp of Stutthof built in 1941. Following liberation by the Red Army, the camp was controlled by the Soviet NKVD Department of Prisoners and Internees until June 1945. Repopulated, it remained in operation until 1949 under the management of the Stalinist Ministry of Public Security of Poland. Camp operation A total of 34,932 people were imprisoned in the camp between 1945 and 1949. At first, the inmates were mainly \\"ethnic Germans\\" from the Volksliste (DVL) including some prisoners-of-war, but also women, and 1,285 children ‚Äì most of them orphaned. The prisoners worked in several workshops on premises as well as in nearby farms owned by the camp administration (with the total area of 1,174.60 ha), between 6.30 a.m. and 17.30 p.m., with one hour break. Over time, they included fighters from the Armia Krajowa (Home Army) and prisoners of war from the Czech Republic, Hungary and Romania. Reported 2,915 inmates died from typhus and dysentery. It was the result of epidemic conditions prevailing in the camp, and the lack of medical care. The dead were buried in the mass graves. Other sources emphasize the total number of prisoners who died there since the inception of the camp in 1941 under the German administration, amounting roughly to 5,000 victims including Poles, Belarusians, Jews and Germans. In 1950/1951, during the darkest years of Stalinist terror the camp was transformed into a prison for Polish political prisoners. Following the 1961 renovations and the subsequent replacement of barracks with cement structures, it became a prison mainly for criminal offenders. In 1974 a wall was erected around the perimeter. Today, the Penal Unit in Potulice is a state prison with space for 1,446 inmates (underaged, and first-time offenders, as well as criminally insane) featuring a medical clinic. Remembrance During the communist rule in the People's Republic of Poland, the memory of post-war events and the human rights abuses in the camp, was censored. Only after the Revolutions of 1989 could this issue be brought into the public debate. Nowadays, close to the memorial to the Nazi camp of Potulice, another memorial was built in 2000 to the post-war labour camp for Germans in Stalinist Poland.

It is used for network troubleshooting, analysis, software and communications protocol development, and education. Originally named Ethereal, the project was renamed Wireshark in May 2006 due to trademark issues. Wireshark is cross-platform, using the Qt widget toolkit in current releases to implement its user interface, and using pcap to capture packets; it runs on Linux, macOS, BSD, Solaris, some other Unix-like operating systems, and Microsoft Windows. There is also a terminal- based (non-GUI) version called TShark. Wireshark, and the other programs distributed with it such as TShark, are free software, released under the terms of the GNU General Public License. Functionality Wireshark is very similar to tcpdump, but has a graphical front-end, plus some integrated sorting and filtering options. Wireshark lets the user put network interface controllers into promiscuous mode (if supported by the network interface controller), so they can see all the traffic visible on that interface including unicast traffic not sent to that network interface controller's MAC address. However, when capturing with a packet analyzer in promiscuous mode on a port on a network switch, not all traffic through the switch is necessarily sent to the port where the capture is done, so capturing in promiscuous mode is not necessarily sufficient to see all network traffic. Port mirroring or various network taps extend capture to any point on the network. Simple passive taps are extremely resistant to tampering. On GNU/Linux, BSD, and macOS, with libpcap 1.0.0 or later, Wireshark 1.4 and later can also put wireless network interface controllers into monitor mode. If a remote machine captures packets and sends the captured packets to a machine running Wireshark using the TZSP protocol or the protocol used by OmniPeek, Wireshark dissects those packets, so it can analyze packets captured on a remote machine at the time that they are captured. History In the late 1990s, Gerald Combs, a computer science graduate of the University of Missouri‚ÄìKansas City, was working for a small Internet service provider. The commercial protocol analysis products at the time were priced around $1500 and did not run on the company's primary platforms (Solaris and Linux), so Gerald began writing Ethereal and released the first version around 1998. The Ethereal trademark is owned by Network Integration Services. In May 2006, Combs accepted a job with CACE Technologies. Combs still held copyright on most of Ethereal's source code (and the rest was re-distributable under the GNU GPL), so he used the contents of the Ethereal Subversion repository as the basis for the Wireshark repository. However, he did not own the Ethereal trademark, so he changed the name to Wireshark. In 2010 Riverbed Technology purchased CACE and took over as the primary sponsor of Wireshark. Ethereal development has ceased, and an Ethereal security advisory recommended switching to Wireshark. Wireshark has won several industry awards over the years, including eWeek, InfoWorld, and PC Magazine. It is also the top-rated packet sniffer in the Insecure.Org network security tools survey and was the SourceForge Project of the Month in August 2010. Combs continues to maintain the overall code of Wireshark and issue releases of new versions of the software. The product website lists over 600 additional contributing authors. Features Wireshark is a data capturing program that \\"understands\\" the structure (encapsulation) of different networking protocols. It can parse and display the fields, along with their meanings as specified by different networking protocols. Wireshark uses pcap to capture packets, so it can only capture packets on the types of networks that pcap supports. * Data can be captured \\"from the wire\\" from a live network connection or read from a file of already-captured packets. * Live data can be read from different types of networks, including Ethernet, IEEE 802.11, PPP, and loopback. * Captured network data can be browsed via a GUI, or via the terminal (command line) version of the utility, TShark. * Captured files can be programmatically edited or converted via command-line switches to the \\"editcap\\" program. * Data display can be refined using a display filter. * Plug-ins can be created for dissecting new protocols. * VoIP calls in the captured traffic can be detected. If encoded in a compatible encoding, the media flow can even be played. * Raw USB traffic can be captured. * Wireless connections can also be filtered as long as they traverse the monitored Ethernet. * Various settings, timers, and filters can be set to provide the facility of filtering the output of the captured traffic. Wireshark's native network trace file format is the libpcap format supported by libpcap and WinPcap, so it can exchange captured network traces with other applications that use the same format, including tcpdump and CA NetMaster. It can also read captures from other network analyzers, such as snoop, Network General's Sniffer, and Microsoft Network Monitor. Security Capturing raw network traffic from an interface requires elevated privileges on some platforms. For this reason, older versions of Ethereal/Wireshark and tethereal/TShark often ran with superuser privileges. Considering the huge number of protocol dissectors that are called when traffic is captured and recognizing the possibility of a bug in a dissector, a serious security risk can be posed. Due to the rather large number of vulnerabilities in the past (of which many have allowed remote code execution) and developers' doubts for better future development, OpenBSD removed Ethereal from its ports tree prior to OpenBSD 3.6. Elevated privileges are not needed for all operations. For example, an alternative is to run tcpdump or the dumpcap utility that comes with Wireshark with superuser privileges to capture packets into a file, and later analyze the packets by running Wireshark with restricted privileges. To emulate near realtime analysis, each captured file may be merged by mergecap into growing file processed by Wireshark. On wireless networks, it is possible to use the Aircrack wireless security tools to capture IEEE 802.11 frames and read the resulting dump files with Wireshark. As of Wireshark 0.99.7, Wireshark and TShark run dumpcap to perform traffic capture. Platforms that require special privileges to capture traffic need only dumpcap run with those privileges. Neither Wireshark nor TShark need to or should be run with special privileges. Color coding Wireshark can color packets based on rules that match particular fields in packets, to help the user identify the types of traffic at a glance. A default set of rules is provided; users can change existing rules for coloring packets, add new rules, or remove rules. Simulation packet capture Wireshark can also be used to capture packets from most network simulation tools such as ns, OPNET Modeler and NetSim.

Born in Moscow, Kryukov attended Moscow Institute of Oriental Studies, where he received a B.A. in 1954. He earned an M.A. in 1955 from Moscow Institute of International Relations, and from the Peking University in 1962. He earned a Ph.D. degree in 1965 from the USSR Academy of Sciences. Since 1965, he has been Senior Research Fellow of the Institute of Ethnology and Anthropology of the Russian Academy of Sciences. Kryukov‚Äôs major contributions to cultural anthropology belong to two fields: (1) studies of the evolution of kinship terminology and (2) the study of long-term dynamics of the Chinese ethnos. Kryukov undertook the study of the dynamics of kinship terminology among Eurasian ethnic groups having deep historical traditions of written records. However, though he seems to consider his results as having universal applicability, they appear to be most applicable to the evolution of kinship terminology in Eurasia and among the Austronesians. He has shown that among those peoples bifurcate merging systems tended to get transformed either into bifurcate collateral, or generational ones. On the other hand, the lineal kinship terminology developed either from bifurcate collateral ones (this development is most typical for Eurasia), or from generational systems. Note that these are not mere speculations, as Kryukov supported his conclusions with a wealth of diachronic data. Being a sinologist he paid special attention to the evolution of kinship terminology among the Chinese, thoroughly documenting the transition from the bifurcate merging to bifurcate collateral kinship terminology among them in the first millennium BC and its further development up to the present.For more detail see: The genius of kinship: the phenomenon of human kinship and the global / By German V.

He was the second son of Liu Biao, the Governor of Jing Province (ËçäÂ∑û; covering present-day Hubei and Hunan). He was a descendant of Liu Yu, Prince Gong of Lu. He had an elder brother, Liu Qi, who was also born to Liu Biao's first wife Lady Chen. Their mother died early. Liu Biao initially favoured his elder son Liu Qi because the latter resembled him in appearance. Liu Cong later married the niece of Liu Biao's second wife, Lady Cai. Due to this, the Cai family was naturally inclined to support Liu Cong, and they often spoke ill of Liu Qi in front of Liu Biao. Liu Qi fell out of his father's favour and heeded Zhuge Liang's suggestion to leave Jing Province's capital Xiangyang and travel to Jiangxia Commandery. On the other hand, Liu Biao loved Liu Cong deeply and wanted to let his younger son succeed him as the Governor of Jing Province. A rift developed between Liu Cong and Liu Qi as a consequence.Book of the Later Han, 74:2423 In 208, Liu Biao became seriously ill, and Liu Qi returned from Jiangxia Commandery to visit his father. Lady Cai's younger brother Cai Mao and Liu Biao's maternal nephew Zhang Yun () were worried that Liu Biao might change his decision after meeting Liu Qi, so they denied Liu Qi entry and refused to let him see his father. Liu Biao died shortly afterwards and Liu Cong became the new Governor of Jing Province.Book of the Later Han, 74:2424 About a month later, the warlord Cao Cao, who controlled the Han central government and the figurehead Emperor Xian, led an army to invade Jing Province. Liu Cong's advisers Kuai Yue, Han Song () and Fu Xun urged him to surrender to Cao Cao. Liu Cong initially desired to put up resistance but was eventually persuaded by Fu Xun to dismiss the idea. When Cao Cao's army reached Xiangyang, Liu Cong surrendered to him. Cao Cao appointed Liu Cong as the Inspector () of Qing Province and granted him the title of a marquis. On Cao Cao's recommendation, Liu Cong was later promoted to a Counsellor Remonstrant () and an Army Adviser ().Records of the Three Kingdoms, 6:214 and 215, n 1 In Romance of the Three Kingdoms In the 14th-century historical novel Romance of the Three Kingdoms, Liu Cong is born to Liu Biao's second wife Lady Cai.

The Prairie Pothole Region (PPR) is an expansive area of the northern Great Plains that contains thousands of shallow wetlands known as potholes. These potholes are the result of glacier activity in the Wisconsin glaciation, which ended about 10,000 years ago. The decaying ice sheet left behind depressions formed by the uneven deposition of till in ground moraines. These depressions are called potholes, glacial potholes, kettles, or kettle lakes. They fill with water in the spring, creating wetlands, which range in duration from temporary to semi- permanent. The region covers an area of about 800,000 sq. km and expands across five U.S. states (Minnesota, Iowa, North and South Dakota, and Montana) and three Canadian provinces (Saskatchewan, Manitoba, and Alberta). The hydrology of the wetlands is variable, which results in long term productivity and biodiversity. The PPR is a prime spot during breeding and nesting season for millions of migrating waterfowl.  Hydrology  Few natural surface water drainage systems occur in the region as pothole wetlands are not connected by surface streams. They receive most of their water from spring snowmelt and precipitation. Some pothole wetlands also receive groundwater inflow, so they typically last longer each year than those that only receive water from precipitation. Shorter-duration wetlands fed only by precipitation typically are sources of groundwater recharge. The hydrology of the potholes is very variable, responding to changes in precipitation and groundwater, and results in regular wet-and-dry cycles.  Vegetation  The vegetation of the PPR consists of emergent plants and tall grasses, while the prairie surrounding the region has dense grassland vegetation. The composition of a local plant community is heavily affected by the amount of water available. In wetter wetlands that retain water through the summer, the common plant is hard-stem bulrush, along with soft-stem bulrush and common threesquare in slightly drier regions of the wetlands. The vegetation in permanently flooded wetlands is more aquatic; duckweeds, pondweeds, aquatic buttercups, and aquatic smartweeds are some of the most common. In drier wetlands of the PPR, the vegetation varies from spikerush, which is found in the wetter areas of the wetland, to foxtail barley and wheatgrass on the outer edges of the wetland. The variable availability of water in the Prairie Pothole Region is buffered by an abundant seed bank under the soil, comprising species that thrive under different water regimes. During times of drought, shortgrass species increase and expand their range, while during wetter periods, tallgrass and mixed prairie communities become more common.  Wildlife  The Prairie Pothole Region provides important habitats for migratory waterfowl and other wildlife, supporting more than 50% of North America's migratory waterfowl.The Prairie Pothole Region, archived copy of page from former National Biological Information Infrastructure website The Prairie Pothole Region is one of North America's most important areas for duck reproduction. Although the region contains only about one-tenth of the continent's habitat area for breeding of waterfowl, roughly half the primary species of game ducks on the continent breed there. The region accounts for more than 60% of the breeding populations of mallard, gadwall, blue-winged teal, northern shoveler, northern pintail, redhead, and canvasback ducks.Austin, Jane E. 1998. Highlight Box: Waterfowl in the Prairie Pothole Region. Pages 456-457 in M. J. Mac, P. A. Opler, C. E. Puckett Haecker, and P. D. Doran, eds. Status and Trends of the Nation's Biological Resources, Vol. 2. Jamestown, ND: Northern Prairie Wildlife Research Center Online. (Version 21JAN2000). The waterfowl time their breeding around the wetlands in this region. They use the wetland as their primary breeding grounds.  Threats  The location of the PPR is the main reason as to why the wetlands are in danger. More than half of the potholes have been drained and converted to agriculture, causing pothole loss upwards to 90% or more in places. As agriculture has expanded around the area the potholes were drained. The remaining wetlands of the region are feeling the effects from the surrounding agriculture. The runoff from chemicals, excess sediment, and nutrient flow into the potholes causes irreparable damage. Climate change is another big culprit for the decline of the PPR. Climate change has caused more of the wetlands to dry earlier in the year. This affects the migration pattern for waterfowl that time their breeding to the seasonal presence of water in the PPR. Climate change has caused more wetlands to become seasonal wetlands as the increase in temperature is drying more and more wetlands. This has caused ripple effects within the migratory waterfowl breeding pattern as they use the wetlands as their primary breeding grounds. Decline in the Prairie Pothole Region, due to climate change and agriculture, will affect the migrating and breeding habits of waterfowl in that area.

Life Glaber was born in 985 in Burgundy, France. At the behest of his uncle, a monk at Saint-L√©ger-de- Champeaux, Glaber was sent to a monastery at the age of twelve, but he was eventually expelled for disobedience.Rodulfus Glaber, History 5.3 (ed. France, p. 221). He spent much of his life moving from one monastery to another. He then entered Moutiers-Saint-Jean Abbey near Dijon, and around the year 1010, joined the Abbey of St. Benignus, also near Dijon. There he met the reform- minded cleric from Piedmont, Abbot William of Volpiano.MacErlean, Andrew. \\"Raoul Glaber.\\" The Catholic Encyclopedia Vol. 6. New York: Robert Appleton Company, 1909. 25 June 2019 In 1028 he travelled to Italy with Volpiano, who encouraged him write what would become his masterpiece, the Historiarum libri quinque ab anno incarnationis DCCCC usque ad annum MXLIV (\\"History in five books from 900 AD to 1044 AD\\"). The chronicle was dedicated to the Abbot of Cluny, Odilo. Today a few manuscripts of the Historiarum survive, including the author's original copy. As a second work, Rodulfus wrote a biography of Volpiano, which probably arose shortly after his death in 1031. That year, he moved to the Abbey of Saint-Germain en Auxerre. The monks at St-Germain got him to restore or compose the inscriptions on the numerous altars in their church, and on the tombs of the saints who were buried in it. When this was done his wanderings began again, and he went to Cluny. He died at Cluny around 1050. Glaber is credited with coining the phrase \\"white mantle of churches\\", describing the ubiquity of religious architecture of the times. Works Glaber is best known for Historiarum, which he is believed to have started writing during his time at the Abbey of Cluny around 1026 or so, and completed at Abbey of Saint-Germain en Auxerre some time later. Initially intended to be an ecclesiastical history, Glaber's focus is on events in the center of France, but occasionally ranges as far as Scotland and Southern Italy. Glaber's writings often sympathized with proponents of church reform of that age, including Henry II, Henry III, and Robert II of France, while criticizing others like Conrad II, and Pope Benedict IX. As a source of events, the work is of limited value due to its chronological and geographic inadequacy, but it is significant as a cultural history document for morality and customs of the 11th century. He also wrote a hagiography of William of Volpiano, the Vita Sancti Guillelmi Abbatis Divionensis. Large extracts from his works are cited and discussed in The Year 1000, by French author Georges Duby. Historiarum was first published in 1596 from a manuscript owned by Pierre Pithou, as part of a collection of eleven medieval chronicles.https://www.amazon.co.uk/Historiae- Francorum-Christi-MCCLXXXV-scriptores/dp/1130597431 (facsimile reprint of 1596 edition)Included in Rodulfi Glabri Historiarum Libri Quinque by Rodulfus Glaber (Oxford, 1989) .

Chordin is encoded by the chrd gene.  History  Chordin was originally identified in the African clawed frog (Xenopus laevis) in the laboratory of Edward M. De Robertis as a key developmental protein that dorsalizes early vertebrate embryonic tissues. It was first hypothesized that chordin plays a role in the dorsal homeobox genes in Spemann's organizer. The chordin gene was discovered through its activation following use of gsc (goosecoid) and Xnothttps://www.uniprot.org/uniprot/B7ZPL0 mRNA injections. The discoverers of chordin concluded that it is expressed in embryo regions where gsc and Xnot were also expressed, which included the prechordal plate, the notochord, and the chordoneural hinge. The expression of the gene in these regions led to the name chordin. Initial functions of chordin were thought to include recruitment of neighboring cells to assist in the forming of the axis along with mediating cell interactions for organization of tail, head, and body regions. Protein Structure  Chordin is a 941 amino-acids long protein, whose three-dimensional transmission electron microscopy structure resembles a horseshoe. A characteristic structural feature of chordin is the presence of four cysteine-rich repeats, which are 58‚Äì75 residues long, each containing 10 cysteines with characteristic spacings. These repeats are homologous with domains in a number of extracellular matrix proteins, including von Willebrand factor. There are five named isoforms of this protein that are produced by alternative splicing. Gene Structure The CHRD gene is 23 exons long and has a length of 11.5 kb and is localized at 3q27. The THPO (Thrombopoietin) gene is located in the same single cosmid clone along with the eukaryotic translation initiation factor-4-gamma gene (EIF4G1).  Function  Chordin dorsalizes the developing embryo by binding ventralizing TGFŒ≤ proteins such as bone morphogenetic proteins (BMP) through its four cytosine rich regions. Chordin blocks BMP signaling by preventing BMP from interacting with cell surface receptors, which inhibits the formation of epidermis and promoting the formation of neural tissue. Chordin specifically inhibits BMP-2,-4,-7. Chordin function is improved by a few co-factors that include the Twisted Gastrulation gene (Tsg) and the zinc metalloprotease. Tsg improves the ability of Chordin to become a BMP antagonist. Zinc metalloprotease functions by cleaving chordin allows for improved signaling with BMP in complexes that were inactive. This occurs by improving Chordin's substrate ability in cleavage reactions and by releasing BMP from chordin products. Experiments with zebrafish showed that a chordin gene mutation can lead to less neural and dorsal tissue. Target gene deletions of chordin, follistatin, and noggin in mice were shown to also have effects on neural induction, while deletion of both chordin and noggin showed more severe effects on neural development. The phenotype for this type of deletion showed almost full headlessness. This is significant because when only noggin is deficient there are mild defects but the head still forms. Noggin has been shown to have overlap at the midgastrula in its expression with chordin. Further experiments testing the role of both noggin and chordin showed that these two proteins are essential for mesodermal development and anterior pattern elaboration. However, noggin and chordin were not shown to play a significant role in the development of the anterior visceral endoderm. Chordin mRNA in mice are expressed early on during the anterior primitive streak. It is expressed in the anterior cells of Koller's sickle, which form the anterior cells of the primitive streak, a key structure through which gastrulation occurs. As the streak evolves to a node and axial mesoderm, the chordin mRNA is still expressed. This evidence suggests a patterning role of chordin during the early embryo stages. When chordin was inactivated, animals may initially appear to have normal development, but later on issues manifest in the inner and outer ear along with pharyngeal and cardiovascular abnormalities. Experiments with Xenopus embryos showed that overexpression of BMP1 and TLL1 can be used to counteract chordin's dorsalization functions. This finding suggests that the major chordin antagonist is BMP1. In mice, chordin is expressed in the node but not in the anterior visceral endoderm. It has been found to be required for forebrain development. In developing mice that are deficient in both chordin and noggin, the head is nearly absent. Chordin is also involved in avian gastrulation and may also play a role in organogenesis.

It was one of the launch titles for both the Neo Geo MVS (arcade) and Neo Geo AES (home) platforms, in addition of also being one of the pack-in games for the AES. When the evil sorcerer Gal Agiese breaks free from his imprisonment and steals the magic tomes that were used against him centuries ago, the magician Elta embarks on a journey to recover the stolen magic tomes from the hands of Gal and his followers before the god of destruction, Az Atorse, is revived and destroys both the land of Cadacis and the world. Though it was initially launched for the Neo Geo MVS, Magician Lord was later released for both Neo Geo AES and Neo Geo CD in 1991 and 1994 respectively, and has since been re- released on compilations and through download services for various consoles, among other ways to play it. Upon its original release, Magician Lord received praise for its colorful and detailed graphics, sound department, gameplay and for being a showcase of the capabilities of the Neo Geo, though critics felt divided in regards to the difficulty and was considered a financial flop in arcades, despite the positive reception it garnered. Retrospective reviews for the title have been mixed in recent years, with reviewers praising the graphics and sound but criticizing its challenging difficulty. A sequel was in development but was never released.  Gameplay  Gameplay screenshot showcasing Cyclopean Firebreather, the first boss of the game. From top to bottom, the interface displays the player's total score, high-score, number of lives, element gauge, remaining hit points and current power level. Magician Lord is a side-scrolling action-platform game similar to Ghouls 'n Ghosts and Rastan where the player takes control of Elta, the main protagonist, through eight stages of varying themes set in the land of Cadacis, where the main objective is to recover eight mystical books that were stolen by Gal Agiese, one of the main antagonists by defeating his servants, alongside with one of his creations that act as a boss at the end of the stage in order to progress further.Magician Lord user's manual (Neo Geo MVS, US) Some of the levels featured are linear in nature, populated with obstacles and enemies, requiring the player to traverse the stage by running, jumping, climbing, shooting or dodging enemies, while other levels that are featured later in the game become more maze-like and exploratory, making the player take different routes to reach the end and if the player takes too long to complete the level, an invincible creature appears and starts following Elta until he is killed and respawns on the same location where he died. Once all lives are lost, the game is over unless the player inserts more credits into the arcade machine to continue playing. If a memory card is present, the player is allowed to save their progress and resume the last stage the game is saved at. As with many earlier games released by SNK, it is well known for its high difficulty. All of the levels in the game have doors that can be opened by pressing up on the joystick, leading to rooms that can either benefit or harm the player and finding the correct door will lead the player to the miniboss of the level, while in the AES version these also act as checkpoints. One of the main features of the game is the ability to transform into powerful beings by picking up combinations of colored orbs found throughout the stages inside treasure chests, granting the player new forms to attack enemies and bosses. When he is not transformed, the primary form of attack for Elta is a weak but fast-moving energy projectile that he can shoot in four directions. Some of the transformations available in the game are the following by grabbing the same-colored orbs in a row or by combining them: * Dragon Warrior: In this form, Elta becomes a dragon and attacks by breathing a continuous short-range fire attack that can also be aimed diagonally, unlike his standard attack. * Waterman: In this form, Elta attacks with water bubbles that burst into water pillars upon touching the ground but only cover a small area. * Poseidon: A more powerful version of the Waterman form, Poseidon can shoot powerful waves of water that travel along the ground for several hits but this form moves very slowly. * Shinobi: In this form, Elta becomes a Shinobi, gaining an increase in agility and attacks with powerful magical arcs of fire, covering a wide area but are slow-moving. * Samurai: Though limited in range, the Samurai is the only form that allows Elta to attack through walls, shields or multiple enemies, using a boomerang-styled attack that deals heavy damage. * Raijin: The Raijin form gives a big boost to the jumping ability of Elta, as well as a unique attack that creates a continuous electrical field around his body.  Plot  Once upon a time, the peaceful and prosperous land of Cadacis and its people were almost at the brink of extermination due to the sudden emergence of a sorcerer named Gal Agiese, whose evil power brought a legion of monsters to invade upon the land and seeking to resurrect Az Atorse, a demonic god of destruction, in order to conquer the land of Cadacis and the world. When all hope seemed to be completely lost as the demons were about to take control completely, a young magician capable of many feats appeared and fought against the unleashed beasts, in addition to sealing both Gal and Az away into a collection of eight magical tomes. The young magician later became known as the \\"Magician Lord\\" after saving the world from evil, and several years went on with peace reigning supreme on Cadacis. However, the seal weakened with time and Gal Agiese escaped from it, resurrecting himself and stealing the eight magical tomes as a result, spreading destruction into the land once more and seeking to revive Az Atorse again. Elta, the last descendant of the \\"Magician Lord\\", goes on a journey to retrieve the eight magical tomes from Gal and his henchmen, before Az is completely resurrected. After defeating the demonic henchmen, Elta arrives at the tower where Gal Agiese resides, who managed to summon Az Atorse before being sealed once again by Elta and after defeating and sealing the god of destruction, peace returns to Cadacis once again and the legend of \\"Magician Lord\\" is reborn.  Development and release  Development and planning of Magician Lord started in the first quarter of 1989, a year before the Neo Geo was announced and released to the public in Japan. The game underwent a beta location testing in January 1990, and this early version of the game featured longer stages that were deemed not suitable for arcade play and as such, the developer scaled down the levels but some were cut in the final version. It was the first title developed by Alpha Denshi for the Neo Geo platform and featured graphical effects such as zooming and rotation. There were originally 27 planned transformations that players could morph into, but only six were finalized due to gameplay changes during development. The game was also showcased for the first time in North America during the 1990 ACME show in Chicago. The soundtrack for the game was composed by Hideki Yamamoto, Hiroaki Shimizu and Yuka Watanabe. Magician Lord was initially launched for arcades on April 26, 1990. The game was also released during the same period for the Neo Geo AES, when the system was originally a rental-only system for video game stores and hotels in Japan, but this was later reversed due to high demand and price, coming into the market as a luxury console on July 1, 1991. Unlike other games that were later released for the Neo Geo, there are several differences between the MVS and AES versions of the game such as the increase of hit points for the player, the inclusion of an introductory sequence, among other changes, while later reprints of the AES version included the original MVS ROM image. It was re- released for the Neo Geo CD on October 31, 1994, featuring a CD-quality soundtrack and other changes. The game also made multiple appearances on Nickelodeon's 1992 children's game show Nick Arcade. The game has received multiple re-releases in recent years on various digital distribution platforms such as the Virtual Console, PlayStation Network, Nintendo eShop and Xbox Live. It was also released on the SNK Arcade Classics Vol. 1 compilation for the PlayStation 2, PlayStation Portable and the Wii in 2008. Magician Lord was also one of the 20 pre-loaded games included on the Neo Geo X. The game was also recently included in the international version of the Neo Geo mini.  Reception  On release, Famicom Ts≈´shin scored the Neo Geo version of the game an average rating of 18 out of 40. On release in North America, it received positive reviews. GamePro gave the Neo Geo version ratings of 5 out of 5 in all five categories of Graphics, Sound, Gameplay, Fun Factor and Challenge. They stated that they \\"consider this the best action game for the system.\\" GameFans four reviewers scored it 99%, 91%, 92%, and 95%, referring to it as \\"one of the best action games ever\\" and \\"the king of action/platform games\\". Jason Weitzner of GameFan also gave a positive outlook to the game in their June 1999 issue, praising the graphics and level design, stating that \\"Magician Lord still remains one of the best 2D games ever\\". Overall, the game was met with mostly positive reception since its initial release in arcades and later on Neo Geo AES. = Retrospective reviews = IGN gave the Virtual Console release of Magician Lord a rating of 6.5 out of 10 stating that \\"Fans of Capcom's Ghouls 'N Ghosts series and the old-school, linear Castlevania adventures would probably be the closest candidates to becoming appreciative players of Magician Lord\\". Nintendo Life gave it 7 out of 10 concluding \\"Magician Lord is still a classic game and the fact that people still regard it as a decent platform romp speaks volumes for the quality of this appealing title\\".  Legacy  = Cancelled sequel = In the mid-1990s, a sequel to Magician Lord was supposedly in development and planned to be released for the Neo Geo AES system but it was eventually moved to the Neo Geo CD as a non- linear, free exploration platform game, serving the same purpose as Crossed Swords II did when it came for the system, however, it was cancelled during development along with a sequel to Crystalis. The premise of the game would have been set two years after the events of the first game. Gal Agiese and Az Atorse have been defeated, and sealed away by the powers of Elta, who became the newly-proclaimed \\"Magician Lord\\". During this period of time, darkness and despair loomed over Cadacis and its citizens. If the darkness outweighed the light of the land, Gal Agiese and Az Atorse would be resurrected for the third time, and wreak havoc upon Cadacis once more. The Queen saw the seal breaking again, but using the last of her magic, one of the eight tomes of power arrives in the clutches of Elta. Elta, noticing the cataclysm starting once more, finally reaches the castle. Elta must now find the Queen, and prevent the third resurrection of Gal Agiese and Az Atorse. Production then carried over toward the Neo Geo Pocket Color in 1998, simply known as Magician Lord. Only an alpha test version of the game for the Neo Geo Pocket Color was ever produced. It was planned to be further developed, but the sequel was cancelled due to Alpha Denshi filing for bankruptcy. After 14 years of seclusion, the alpha test cartridge was finally unearthed by French gaming website GameKult. The game offered more transformations than the first game, and played very similarly to the likes of Metroid and Castlevania: Symphony of the Night, with the main difference being the ability of the Magician Lord to transform at will.

It takes its name (which is less precisely phrased in the original Polish) from the copper roof, a rarity in the first half of the 18th century. Since 1989 the Palace has been a branch of the Royal Castle Museum. The palace is contiguous with Warsaw's Royal Castle, and down a slope from Castle Square and Warsaw's Old Town. Beneath the palace, a 17th-century lodge still exists. History The original patrician house of Wawrzyniec Reffus was built in 1651-56. After its 1657 destruction by the army of George II R√°k√≥czi, it was completely remodeled in 1698-1701 for Jerzy Dominik Lubomirski. Lubomirski built on a southern wing, perpendicular to the rest of the structure, and expanded the western elevation. Soon after, the palace came to be called Palais Martin after Lubomirski's grandson. In 1720 the palace was rebuilt with the addition of a second, northern wing; and the interior was decorated with rococo paintings. After 1777 the palace passed into the possession of Poland's last king, Stanis≈Çaw August Poniatowski, who hired the architect Domenico Merlini to redesign the rooms and to join the Royal Castle's library wing to it. The King then presented the redecorated palace to his nephew, Prince J√≥zef Poniatowski. The Prince was a successful commander in the 1794 Ko≈õciuszko Uprising, and later one of Napoleon Bonaparte's marshals. Under the Prince's ownership, the Palace became a center of Warsaw's high-class social scene. When Warsaw became part of the Kingdom of Prussia after the Third Partition of Poland (1795), the Palace became a Prussian Ministry of War headquarters. The Copper-Roof Palace was deliberately burned in 1944 by the occupying Germans. In 1948-49 it was reconstructed, based on 18th-century paintings by Bernardo Bellotto. The palace is now a museum, part of Warsaw's Royal Castle, and hosts a historic library and a permanent exhibit of oriental rugs.

Forsythe ended up performing in a production of Cavalli's Giasone at Harvard University. This production impacted Forsythe's life positively in both professional and personal ways. The opera introduced her to her husband, conductor Edward Elwyn Jones (they met while doing this opera and married in the summer of 2005) and Martin Pearlman, the director of Boston Baroque.

Beginning as a comedy performer, he rose to prominence on channel Antena 3 with sketch show ', and in A√≠da, playing the main character Luisma. He gained more prominence for portraying Mar√≠a Jos√© Riquelme in the Netflix series The House of Flowers, and writing, directing, and starring as Manolo in Movistar's Arde Madrid. He is also a prominent campaigner for HIV/AIDS causes. Career Le√≥n's first roles were in comedy television, on Mariquilla R√≠e Perlas and Castillos en el aire in 1999. These played on Canal Sur, the channel of Andalusia. Le√≥n has had success in theatre throughout his career, first appearing on stage in 2001. He moved to Madrid in 2003 to continue his career, where his first big job was impersonating personalities on Homo Zapping, where he was noticed for popular imitations of women like Anne Igartiburu and Raquel Revuelta. He is best known for playing Luisma, a recovering drug addict, on A√≠da, a role he played for nine years and which garnered him many Best Actor awards. He has also had notable film roles, as an OCD patient in Toc Toc and a playboy in The Tribe. As a voice and dubbing actor, he has had roles in Valiant and Madagascar, and as a film director, his debut was the 2012 Carmina or Blow Up, for which he was nominated for a Goya as Best Directorial Debut. His mother and sister star in the film, and were both nominated for acting Goyas. His third directorial feature was Kiki, Love to Love, in which he stars and was similarly multi- nominated. For his 2014 film, Carmina y am√©n, the El Confidencial writer Juan Manuel Fern√°ndez suggested that he was becoming \\"the new Pedro Almod√≥var\\", particularly highlighting the funeral scene that opens Carmina y am√©n and saying it has \\"a poetry only comparable to\\" the opening scene of Volver. Fern√°ndez also notes how both Le√≥n and Almod√≥var are influenced by the women in their lives, that they both often work with a sibling, and celebrate their mothers in their films. In 2018, he created Arde Madrid with wife Anna R. Costa, a black and white miniseries about Ava Gardner, in which he also played Gardner's chauffeur. From 2018 to 2020, he portrayed trans woman Mar√≠a Jos√© Riquelme on The House of Flowers. Regarding working on The House of Flowers, Le√≥n says working with Ver√≥nica Castro was an honour. In 2019, profiling the actor, Dann Dulin wrote that Le√≥n's \\"persona and popularity are akin to a James Franco or Jake Gyllenhaal\\". Personal life Le√≥n's mother is Carmina Barrios. He has one sister, Mar√≠a Le√≥n, who is also an actress. Both his mother and sister starred as characters based on themselves in the films Carmina or Blow Up (2012) and Carmina y am√©n (2014), which Paco wrote and directed. Mar√≠a and Paco also play siblings in The House of Flowers. Le√≥n met the Catalan playwright Anna Rodr√≠guez Costa in 2006 in a play, going on to act in a short she directed later that year; she was also an acting teacher to Mar√≠a. Le√≥n said that at the time they met, he had a boyfriend, but knew that he wanted to be with her. The couple have been together since 2006 and wrote the screenplay for Arde Madrid together. They have a daughter (born 2010), and Costa's son Eloi (born c. 1994) is Le√≥n's stepson. Costa also appears in Carmina y am√©n. He is openly bisexual, and actively campaigns for HIV/AIDS causes. He has several friends living with the disease and has worked with organisations including Fundaci√≥n Tri√°ngulo, Apoyo Positivo, StopSIDA, and the Fight Against AIDS Foundation since at least 2009, which largely offer support to the LGBT+ community in Spain, as well as fundraising for the work of eminent HIV researcher Bonaventura Clotet. Le√≥n has said that he became aware of the AIDS epidemic when Rock Hudson died, but has also had a scare personally.

The murder of Ghazala had been ordered by her father to save the family honour, making it a so‚Äêcalled honour killing. Nine people from her family took part in arranging and performing the murder and they were all found guilty by √òstre Landsret (the High Court of Eastern Denmark) on 27 June 2006 on counts of manslaughter and attempted manslaughter (of her husband). This was a ruling of historic importance, the first time in western Europe that such a large number of family members were found guilty in an \\"honour killing\\" case. It is expected that the conviction will serve as precedent throughout Europe for future similar cases and that the sentences will send a strong signal and have a noticeable deterrent effect. Manu Sareen, a youth worker helping girls facing arranged marriages said: \\"It will have a preventive effect. Some families may abandon similar plans because of today's ruling.\\" Background Gazala Khan's father, Ghulum Abbas, originated from Punjab, Pakistan. He left Punjab in 1970.'Honour killing' family jailed over shot bride, The Daily Telegraph, 29 June 2006. Last accessed 27 July 2006. For three years prior to her murder Ghazala had an intimate relationship with her future husband, Emal Khan. However Ghazala, fearing her family's reaction, wished the relationship be kept secret. She eventually revealed her feelings to her mother, who became outraged and beat her, accompanied by her older brother, Akhtar Abbas, the same man who would later shoot her. Emal Khan reports that after that incident, Ghazala was locked inside the house and \\"frozen out\\" by the rest of her family, all of whom refused to speak to her or eat with her. Finally, on 5 September 2005 she managed to escape her family and live with Emal. In the period up until her murder they lived with various friends in Denmark. They repeatedly contacted the police for protection, but were denied help. On 21 September they married at the registry office of the small Danish town of Middelfart. Attack Two days after the wedding, the Abbas family, pretending to want to come to a peaceful reconciliation, convinced the newlywed couple to attend a meeting at the railway station in Slagelse. There, Ghazala's brother shot both Ghazala and Emal Khan. Ghazala was killed instantly. Emal Khan, shot twice in the abdominal region, survived after a lengthy operation. The criminal proceedings The court case against the nine persons convicted of the murder of Ghazala was initiated on 15 May 2006. On 26 June, the court's juridical head instructed the jury that all involved could be convicted based on the evidence presented. On the 27 June, the jury found all of the indicted family members and family friends guilty of conspiracy to commit murder.

Although accurate and powerful, with a high muzzle velocity, it was very heavy, with a low rate of fire, which limited its production. Development and use Developed in 1935 by Rheinmetall-Borsig as a commercial venture as the MG-101 (later designated MK 101, with the \\"MK\\" abbreviating the term Maschinenkanone, as an autocannon), the MK 101 cannon was a 30 mm (1.18 in), long-barreled automatic cannon capable of firing nine different types of 30x184B mm ammunition (ranging from basic high explosive to tungsten-cored armor-piercing rounds). Featuring pneumatic cocking and fired by percussion via an electrical solenoid, the MK 101 was recoil-operated. In operation, the barrel and bolt recoiled 30 mm (1.18 in) to the rear after each shot. The bolt locked via a Stange-type machined sleeve with internal interrupted threads, similar to some Solothurn weapons such as the 7.92 mm (.312 in) MG 30 light machine gun. The locking system was strong, but rate of fire was limited to a rather slow 230‚Äì260 rpm, which limited its use against other aircraft. Powerful and accurate for its day, it was carried primarily on the Henschel Hs 129 ground-attack aircraft, commencing in late 1941. Fed by a 10-round (early versions) or a 30-round box magazine, the MK 101 could penetrate 75 mm (3 in) of armor at 300 m (330 yd) range. The dozen examples created of the Heinkel He 177A-1/U2 Zerst√∂rer (\\"Destroyer\\") experimental prototype attack aircraft used twinned MK 101s on a forward-aimed limited- traverse mount, located in the extreme lower nose at the front of a dramatically enlarged Bola inverted-casemate gondola emplacement under the nose, and was intended for anti-ship and possible \\"train-busting\\" use, but was never deployed in combat. When it was used from beneath an Hs 129's central fuselage as a ventral gun pod-mounted anti-tank weapon, the MK 101's tungsten- cored AP round was capable of penetrating the turret and side armor of the Soviet KV-1 heavy tank.Kay, Antony L. and Smith, John R., German aircraft of the Second World War: Including Helicopters and Missiles, Naval Institute Press (2002), , 9781557500106, p. 169 An electrically-fired version of the MK 101 cannon was later developed and designated the MK 103.

It ran from 1974 to 1989. The program was later known as PTL Today and as Heritage Today. PTL stands for \\"Praise The Lord\\" or \\"People That Love\\". During its final days, The PTL Club, which adopted a talk show format, was the flagship television program of the Bakkers' PTL Satellite Network.  History  Jim and Tammy Bakker had been in the ministry with the Assemblies of God denomination since the early 1960s prior to joining Pat Robertson's Christian Broadcasting Network, then based in Portsmouth, Virginia in 1965. The Bakkers launched a children's show called Come On Over where the couple entertained viewers with songs, stories, and puppets. In 1966 Jim Bakker became the host of The 700 Club, a religious talk program that evolved from a telethon. The 700 Club would become the flagship program of CBN, which expanded from its original Hampton Roads station to include outlets in Atlanta and Dallas‚ÄìFort Worth by 1973. Beginning in 1972, The 700 Club was launched in a dozen test markets, including then-independent station WRET-TV in Charlotte. When then- station owner Ted Turner dropped the show from his station in 1974, Turner approached Bakker about buying two hours a day on his Charlotte station, which Bakker accepted. He opted to call the show The PTL Club, and The 700 Club moved to then-ABC affiliate WCCB in Charlotte. The PTL Club was launched in a small studio at WRET-TV in November 1974; the show expanded to a few other stations early the next year, such as WGGS-TV in Greenville, South Carolina; WHMB-TV in Indianapolis; WHCT in Hartford, Connecticut; and KHOF-TV in the Los Angeles area, among a few others. The show launched nationally in the fall of 1975, with two editions offered: one was the full two-hour edition, which tended to air on Christian stations and smaller independent stations, and the other was a one-hour edition which tended to air on stronger independent stations, as well as network affiliates. By 1976, the Bakkers moved their studio to the site of a former furniture store in Charlotte. With The PTL Club program as its centerpiece, the Bakkers and their staff built what became known as the PTL Television Network (later named The Inspirational Network), a worldwide Christian satellite cable television network. In a Tonight Show-type format, the program featured many well-known ministers and Christian recording artists. In the beginning, \\"Uncle Henry\\" Harrison (who had worked with Bakker at CBN) was the co-host/sidekick (much like Ed McMahon to Johnny Carson), and when Tammy Faye took over as co-host, Harrison became just the announcer. The program was later broadcast from Bakker's Heritage Village ministry headquarters and complex on Park Road in Charlotte, and then moved to studios constructed at the ministry's new 2500-acre mixed-use family theme park and resort in Fort Mill, South Carolina, known as Heritage USA. Bakker's conspicuous consumption and prosperity gospel preaching led critics to claim that PTL stood for \\"Pass The Loot\\". As time went on and as more stations had additional programming commitments by 1981, many opted to only run an hour of the PTL Club. In the fall of 1982, the show was cut to an hour, at which length it remained until its cancellation. =Scandal and subsequent demise= Due to his involvement in highly publicized financial and sexual scandals, Jim Bakker resigned on March 19, 1987. He turned all ministry assets over to Lynchburg, Virginia‚Äìbased pastor and broadcaster Jerry Falwell, who became CEO of the parent organization, Heritage Village Church and Missionary Fellowship, Inc. and assumed control of Heritage USA, the cable network, and of its flagship program. Falwell's involvement was deemed newsworthy, as the PTL ministries were a part of the Assemblies of God denomination and Falwell was a Southern Baptist. Ministry supporters questioned Falwell's intentions and attributed his interest solely to maintaining control of the lucrative cable- television empire owned by PTL to broadcast his own ministry programming. One commentator noted that \\"Bakker arranged for Falwell to take over PTL in March in an effort to avoid what he called a 'hostile takeover' of the television ministry by people threatening to expose a sexual encounter he admitted to having had seven years earlier with church secretary Jessica Hahn.\\"Steve Baker. PTL-Falwell Associated Press. July 21, 1987. According to Hahn, on the afternoon of December 6, 1980, when she was a 21-year-old church secretary, Bakker and another preacher, John Wesley Fletcher drugged her and raped her for \\"about 15 minutes\\". Hahn stated she overheard Bakker say afterward to another PTL staffer, \\"Did you get her too?\\"Transcript of interview with Larry King, CNN, July 14, 2005. A federal grand jury indicted Bakker for directing millions of dollars of church funds to personal use. Much of the nation watched the court case to see the outcome of the $165 million in donations. The PTL Club continued as a television program for a considerable time after this, first with Falwell as its host and PTL personality Doug Oldham as co- host. Falwell later brought in Christian singer Gary McSpadden as the show's co-host, along with PTL musical talent Ron Aldridge. The show was renamed PTL Today, then‚Äîin an effort to distance the show from the PTL name‚ÄîHeritage Today. Aldridge continued as co-host alongside another PTL singer, Brenda Davis, after Falwell suddenly resigned from the now-bankrupt PTL ministry. McSpadden and Oldham subsequently left the show out of support for Falwell's decision to resign his position with the ministry. With Falwell's resignation, Sam Johnson, a member of the PTL ministry team, assumed leadership and incorporated a new entity known as Heritage Ministries to run the television program and associated ministry functions. As Heritage USA and the PTL assets were now tied up in bankruptcy reorganization, the new ministry and the television program had to move from their longtime Heritage USA broadcast studios to newly purchased property on Nations Ford Road in Charlotte that was named Heritage Place. The program remained on the air as late as September 1988, when Johnson faced problems with the IRS.IRS Asks Court to Stop PTL Show In 1989, evangelist Morris Cerullo purchased the network out of bankruptcy. it operates as INSP from broadcast facilities in Charlotte, with headquarters in nearby Indian Land, South Carolina. On August 23, 1991, after the second and final day of his re-sentencing hearing, the court reduced Bakker's original 45-year sentence to 18 years, five of which he actually served before being released. In February 2009, Atlanta, Georgia investment-banker Ben Dyer announced his intention to auction off over 15,000 hours of videotaped episodes of The PTL Club on March 27, 2009. A friend of Jim Bakker's purchased the programs. The master library of PTL programming has been returned to Jim Bakker, and the old tapes are being digitally remastered and restored. Restored programs are being run on the new PTL Television Network on Roku and online at the PTL Television Network's website.

Intended to be a dual purpose weapon for anti-tank and air-to-air fighting, it was developed from the MK 101. Compared to the MK 101 it was faster firing, and was originally intended to develop a higher muzzle velocity than the MK 101. Unlike the MK 101, the MK 103 used a belt feed, allowing it to potentially carry a larger ammunition load. The MK 103 used electrically- primed rather than percussion-primed ammunition. The operating mechanism differed from the recoil-operated MK 101 in that it used a combination of gas and recoil operation. After firing, gas pressure served to unlock the breech, while barrel recoil was used to cycle the action (eject spent cartridge and load a fresh one). Because of a combination of lower grade steels and lighter components, the mechanism of the MK 103 was not as strong as the MK 101. To counteract this weakness, HE ammunition with a reduced load of propellant was used, resulting in a loss of about 100 m/s in muzzle velocity compared to the MK 101, but the rate of fire was increased. The MK 103 entered service in 1943 as the main armament of the Hs 129 B-1 ground-attack/tank-destroyer aircraft, mounted on the underside of the fuselage in a conformal gun pod. The original specification for the MK 103 called for it to fit inside an aircraft's engine mounting (possibly as a Motorkanone, firing through a hollow propeller hub), but it proved to be too large and heavy to fit into small fighters like the Bf 109. If mounted elsewhere, such as in the wing, the asymmetric force of the cannon's recoil tended to yaw the aircraft's nose to one side. The only known usage of the MK 103 in a Motorkanone installation was in the Do 335. A modified version with a reduced-profile barrel, the MK 103M, was developed and possibly tested for use as a Motorkanone cannon on single-engine fighter planes such as the Bf 109K, but probably never saw active service. As a consequence, the MK 103 was largely restricted to the role of an air-to-ground weapon for use against armoured vehicles. Projectile weights for the MK 103 were ) for the HE/M ammunition and ) for APCR ammunition. Armour penetration for APCR / 60¬∞ / or / 90¬∞ / . Later in the war the MK 103 was also used as a ground-based anti-aircraft (AA) weapon, using single or dual mounts. It was also used as a flak autocannon in the Flakpanzer IV \\"Kugelblitz\\". Developed alongside the MK 103 was the lighter MK 108 cannon, which had a shorter barrel and used a modified blow-back operating system. It fired the same projectile, using a smaller cartridge case with less propellant, at a relatively low muzzle velocity. The shorter barrel made it more adaptable, so it saw much greater use.

(1963); Yakutsk, Siberia (1973); Edmonton, Canada (1978); Fairbanks, Alaska (1983); Trondheim, Norway (1988); Beijing, China (1993); Yellowknife, Canada (1998); and Zurich, Switzerland (2003: ICOP 2003). The Ninth International Conference on Permafrost (NICOP) was held in Fairbanks, Alaska, June 29-July 3, 2008 and the Tenth took place in Salekhard, Russia, June 25‚Äì29, 2012 (TICOP 2012). The Eleventh International Conference on Permafrost will be held in Potsdam, Germany in 2016. Field excursions are an integral part of each Conference, and are organised by the host country. Regional conferences are organised between the main conferences (in Europe, Russia, China). Organization and structure Membership is through adhering national or multinational organisations or as Associate Members in countries where no Adhering Body exists. The IPA is governed by an Executive Committee and a Council consisting of representatives from 26 Adhering Bodies having interests in some aspect of theoretical, basic and applied frozen ground research, including permafrost, periglacial phenomena, seasonal frost, and artificial ground freezing. Members are: Argentina, Austria, Canada, China, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Iceland, Italy, Japan, Kyrgyzstan, Mongolia, The Netherlands, New Zealand, Norway, Poland, Portugal, Romania, Russia, South Korea, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, United Kingdom, United States of America. News from the IPA members are posted on the IPA webpage. The officers of the seven-member Executive Committee (2012‚Äì2016) are: :President: Prof. Antoni Lewkowicz (Canada) :Vice Presidents: Prof. Hanne Christiansen (Norway) and Prof. Vladimir Romanovsky (USA) :Members: Dr. Hugues Lantuit (Germany), Prof. Lothar Schrott (Austria), Dr. Dmitry Sergeev (Russia) and Prof. Ma Wei (China) The Executive Director is Dr. Inga May (Germany). The IPA Constitution provides for three categories of Working Group Parties: standing committees (long-term), working groups (5‚Äì10 years) and action groups (1‚Äì2 years) that organise and coordinate research activities and special projects. The first category includes a Standing Committee for Data, Information and Communication, an International Advisory Committee for the International Permafrost Conferences, and a Standing Committee for Education and Outreach. There are ten Working Groups, each with two co-chairs and some with subgroups. These are: :‚Ä¢ Antarctic Permafrost and Periglacial Environments :‚Ä¢ Coastal and Offshore Permafrost (see: Arctic Coastal Dynamics webpage) :‚Ä¢ Cryosol :‚Ä¢ Glacier and Permafrost Hazards in High Mountains (see: GAPHAZ webpage) :‚Ä¢ Isotopes and Geochemistry of Permafrost :‚Ä¢ Mapping and Modelling of Mountain Permafrost :‚Ä¢ Periglacial Landforms, Processes, and Climate :‚Ä¢ Permafrost and Climate :‚Ä¢ Permafrost Astrobiology :‚Ä¢ Permafrost Engineering Details of the Working Parties goals and activities are found on the IPA website. The International Secretariat is based at the Alfred Wegener Institute for Polar and Marine Research under the direction of Dr. Inga May (Germany). Annual membership contributions are used for producing and distributing Frozen Ground, and support of Working Parties and committee activities and representations at international meetings. Publication and Information Proceedings of peer-reviewed papers are produced for each International Permafrost Conference by the host country, as are field trip guidebooks. A list of publications is found on the IPA website. The News Bulletin Frozen Ground is published annually and has a distribution of over 2500. Current and back issues are posted online. The Circum-Arctic Map of Permafrost and Ground- Ice Conditions at a scale of 1:10,000,000 was prepared by an international team and published in the Circum-Pacific map series in 1997. The CAPS: Circumpolar Active-Layer Permafrost System, version 2.0 CD-ROM is a compilation of global frozen ground data and information. Permafrost and Frozen Ground: Bibliography 1978 ‚Äì 2003, Glaciological Data Report GD-31, is an online bibliography of the world‚Äôs literature. Both are produced in conjunction with the International Permafrost Conferences and available from the National Snow and Ice Data Center. An illustrated Glossary of Permafrost and Related Ground-Ice Terms in 12 languages (Chinese, English, French, German, Icelandic, Italian, Norwegian, Polish, Romanian, Russian, Swedish, and Spanish), 278 pages, was produced in 1998. IPA cooperates with the American Geological Institute by providing literature to its Cold Regions Bibliography Project. Major activities The IPA coordinates and cooperates with several other major international programmes and organizations. Briefly these are: Global Terrestrial Network for Permafrost (GTN-P) is a WMO network for monitoring of the active layer and the Thermal State of Permafrost (TSP). The IPA manages the GTN-P. The Circumpolar Active Layer Monitoring (CALM) program has 125 reporting stations and TSP has identified over 800 boreholes; both include a total of over 15 participating countries. Arctic Coastal Dynamics (ACD) is a joint programme with the International Arctic Science Committee (IASC) and the IGBP(International Geosphere-Biosphere Programme) - LOICZ (Land-Ocean Interactions in the Coastal Zone) programme to estimate the organic carbon content and mineral transfer for eroding permafrost onto the Arctic shelves. The IPA is collaborating with the International Union for Quaternary Research (INQUA). The IPA has a Memorandum of Understanding with the Climate and Cryosphere (CliC) programme of the World Climate Research Programme (WCRP). The main areas of cooperation are on the roles of permafrost on water and carbon balances, and data assimilation and modelling. Beginning in 1995 the IPA and the International Geographical Union (IGU) developed an Agreement of Cooperation, thus making IPA an affiliate of the IGU. The current IGU collaboration is within its Commission on Cold Regions Environments. Coordination of activities on permafrost, soils and periglacial environments of the Antarctic and sub-Antarctic islands is a joint programme with an Expert Group of the Scientific Committee for Antarctic Research (SCAR). Activities related to glaciers and permafrost hazards in the high mountains (GAPHAZ) are a joint activity with the International Union of Geodesy and Geophysics (IUGG) and its newly designated Commission for the Cryospheric Sciences. The topic of carbon sources and sinks in cold regions soils (cryosols) and permafrost is a joint program with the Global Carbon Project (GPC) and the joint working group on Cryosol of the International Union of Soil Sciences (IUSS). Recent and future activities IPA was actively involved in the International Polar Year International Polar Year (IPY) by participating with four coordinated projects. The Thermal State of Permafrost (TSP) proposes to obtain a ‚Äòsnapshot‚Äô of permafrost temperatures throughout Planet Earth during the period 2007-2008. Another objective of TSP is to establish a permanent International Network of Permafrost Observatories (INPO) within the framework of the Global Terrestrial Network for Permafrost (GTN-P). The three other IPY projects are concerned with Antarctic and sub-Antarctic Permafrost, Periglacial and Soil Environments (ANTPAS) and with the Arctic Circum-Polar Coastal Observatory Network (ACCO-Net) and Carbon Pools in Permafrost Regions (CAPP), and revised regional permafrost maps of Central Asia and the Nordic region. For updated news about IPA activities linked to IPY, see the IPA website. Several regional permafrost and soils conferences were held and are planned, including: :‚Ä¢ The First European Conference on Permafrost (EUCOP I) in Rome (Italy), in 2001; :‚Ä¢ The Second European Conference on Permafrost (EUCOP II) in Potsdam (Germany), in June 2005; :‚Ä¢ The Fourth International Conference on Cryopedology, was held in Arkhangelsk (Russia), in August 2005; :‚Ä¢ The Asian Conference on Permafrost convenes in Lanzhou (China), in early August 2006 with a field excursion to the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau; :‚Ä¢ The Ninth International Conference on Permafrost (NICOP) was held in early summer 2008 in Fairbanks (U.S.A.). :‚Ä¢ The Third European Conference on Permafrost (EUCOP III) was held in July 2010 in Longyearbyen, Svalbard, Norway. :‚Ä¢ The Tenth International Conference on Permafrost (TICOP) took place in June 2012 in Salekhard, Russia. :‚Ä¢ EUCOP IV will be hosted by the University of √âvora in collaboration with the University of Lisbon in √âvora, Portugal in 2014 and ICOP 11 is planned for 2016 in Potsdam, Germany.

As Smiley talks, the first-person narrator, whom readers know only as \\"Ned,\\" recalls his own experiences in a long career in the service. The various episodes are triggered by comments from Smiley, which send Ned into tangential memories. The individual stories together create a portrait of Ned himself, moving from the start of his career at the beginning of the novel to his retirement in the final chapter. Several of the episodes are recognisable anecdotes or urban legends from the British intelligence community. Plot =Part one= Smiley reflects on the end of the Cold War, and makes a rueful joke that, in one way, the world has changed, but in another, it has always been the same and the secret services are gradually waking up from their own deluded perceptions of it, and themselves. After a couple of years of training at the Sarratt Nursery, in the glens of Argyll and battle camps of Wiltshire, Ned is looking forward to his first overseas posting and is disappointed to be kept in London, as part of a team of watchers keeping an eye on a Middle Eastern royal family. In a famous Knightsbridge store, Ned becomes alarmed when he sees a suspicious Arab closely following the prince's wife at a distance. Ned prepares to incapacitate him with a martial arts blow, but his supervisor Monty grabs Ned and holds him back. Ned learns that the wife is a compulsive shoplifter and the man is not a fanatic assassin, but instead assigned by the prince to pay compensation and hush money to the stores she steals from. Monty comments, \\"That's the trouble in our job, Ned. Life's looking one way, we're looking the other.\\" =Part two= Smiley informs Ned's students that no one on Earth is more adept at hiding his true feelings than the privately educated Englishman ‚Äì \\"which is why some of our best officers turn out to be our worst, and our worst, our best, and why the most difficult agent you'll ever have to run is yourself.\\" Ned returns to his flat in humiliation after the episode in Knightsbridge, and finds Smiley and the Circus's head of Personnel going through his belongings. Smiley informs him that Ned's best friend from Sarratt, Benjamin Arno Cavendish, disappeared just after starting his assignment in Berlin, and the East German network he was supposed to be running has collapsed. In Ben's flat, the Circus found a love letter written to Ned. Ned is shocked, as he had no idea that Ben was homosexual, much less so passionately attached to him. After Smiley leaves, Ned tracks down Ben, hiding with his German cousin, Stephanie, in the Western Isles of Scotland. Ben confesses that, beneath his confident, derring-do exterior, he is always terrified of failure, especially when he feels he has to live up to the example of his father, who had an illustrious career during the Second World War as a mathematician, devising the Double-Cross System. While in Berlin, Ben was constantly harassed and patronised by his immediate superior, Haggerty, who despised Ben for replacing him due to his clean reputation. Before his first meeting with the lead agent in East Germany, Ben wrote a crib sheet with the agents' names and contact procedures, and took it with him when he crossed into East Berlin. As it turned out, he didn't need it, and his meeting with the agent went perfectly, but after he crossed back into West Germany, he realised he'd lost the crib sheet somewhere. Unable to warn the network before it collapsed, Ben secretly fled Germany and sought shelter with Stephanie. It takes a moment for Ned to absorb the \\"appalling banality\\" of Ben's story; \\"that you could lose a network in the same way you might lose a set of keys or a pocket handkerchief.\\" Smiley has had Ned followed, and Circus agents arrive to take Ben in for questioning, shortly after he finishes his story. Ned later hears that he has been dismissed from the Circus. = Part three = While one of Ned's students is quizzing Smiley about the 'secret' of conducting an interrogation, Smiley frowns and says that recognising the truth is far more difficult than spotting a lie. After all, spies are naturally suspicious people, and nothing is more suspicious to them than a completely innocent man who has nothing to hide. After his unwitting exposure of his friend Benjamin Cavendish, Ned is posted to Hamburg in Western Germany to run a network of Baltic sailors, led by a passionate Latvian smuggler named Brandt. Though surprisingly efficient, Ned is wary of his position due to his predecessor's hushed up departure after embezzling massive amounts of Circus funds and settling to Southern Spain with his boyfriend. In the course of their operations, Brandt reveals his new girlfriend, Bella, who is said to be the daughter of a friend of Brandt's. Head of London Station, Bill Haydon orders Ned to inquire about Bella's credentials due to the fact that her sudden appearance in the network's inner circle appears suspicious. Ned eventually seduces (or rather, is seduced by) Bella and they begin an affair during Brandt's absence. Later, Brandt's men walk into a trap at the coast of Narva in Estonia and the crew are taken by the Soviets. Brandt is taken to Sarratt for interrogation while Ned is summoned to London for debriefing. He is interviewed by Haydon, who was accompanied by his lieutenants, Roy Bland and Toby Esterhase along with George Smiley. Ned is interrogated about Bella's background and her story about being the daughter of a German soldier who had raped her mother when her \\"father\\" was fighting in the Second World War. Though Ned answers reasonably, Haydon counters him with a photograph, depicting Bella as a language student in a Moscow Centre linguistics school that trains prospective undercover agents. Haydon's coterie, barring Smiley, take the photograph as genuine, as its source is London Station's Witchcraft Project. Ultimately, it's decided that Bella must have been the mole and Ned is ordered to bring her in to be interrogated in Sarratt. Eventually, the inquiry stagnates and both Bella and Brandt are released to settle in Canada and to resume smuggling, respectively. Brandt refuses to take Bella back for then-unknown reasons, which gives Ned the impression that Haydon informed Brandt of Bella's infidelity, out of mischief. In 1989, during a lunch with Toby Esterhase, Ned learns that Esterhase and Peter Guillam were in Moscow as a part of an intelligence delegation. During their guided tour in Moscow Centre headquarters, they run into a familiar figure who is none other than Captain Brandt. It was Brandt who had betrayed the previous network, as well as the new one. = Part four = Ned reflects that every employee of the Circus of a certain generation can recall where he or she was at the time of \\"The Fall\\" ‚Äì Bill Haydon's exposure as a KGB mole. Ned himself was in Rome, in the middle of a celebratory dinner after installing a wiretap against a Roman Catholic cardinal suspected of involvement with arms dealers, when he received the telex from London with the shocking news. With Haydon's exposure, every Circus officer's identity must be considered compromised, and Ned is told that he cannot be posted anywhere outside of Western Bloc countries. = Part five = Smiley muses that the most vulgar thing about the Cold War was that the Western societies learned to \\"gobble up [their] own propaganda.\\" The West became so convinced of the righteousness of its own cause, and the evil of the Soviets', that it never stopped to examine the ethics of its actions. In the name of expediency, the Circus opened its arms ‚Äì and its purse ‚Äì to every petty thug and two-bit con man who called himself an anti-Communist. Ned's first post-Haydon posting is to Munich, as the Circus's liaison with various Eastern Bloc exile communities, quietly discouraging their crackpot schemes to foment anarchy in the Soviet Union, or encouraging whatever legitimate intelligence sources they have in their home countries. According to Toby Esterhase, the \\"star\\" of the Circus's Munich arm is Professor Teodor, a fugitive Hungarian academic. At first, Ned is dazzled by Teodor's passionate lectures on the evils wreaked on Hungary by the Allied Powers after World War I, but finds his opinions shallow when the Professor is quizzed on more current events. Giving Teodor the benefit of the doubt, Ned corresponds to his associates in the American intelligence fraternity, only to learn that they had come to realise that Teodor's intelligence work is completely worthless. Ned begins to see that the Circus has good reason for denying Teodor's repeated requests to be issued a British passport. In the middle of the night, Ned is called to Teodor's home and introduced to a Hungarian man named Latzi, who says he has been sent by the Hungarian secret service to assassinate Teodor, but has refused out of admiration for the Professor and wants to defect. Before long, Esterhase and the American CIA are lauding the two Hungarians for their courage and arranging for Teodor's honourable retirement from intelligence work, including issuing passports. Ned's protests that \\"the whole thing's a con\\" are ignored. Aside, Teodor's long-suffering wife confesses that Latzi is a \\"bad actor\\" and an old friend of Teodor, whom Teodor used as a go-between when he wanted to inform on his students to the Hungarian authorities. When Ned vents his outrage to Smiley back in London, Smiley regards the incident as an amusing farce, initially only remarking, \\"Oh, Toby.\\" As Smiley later explains, \\"all churches need their saints... and saints, when you get right down to it, are a pretty bogus lot.\\" Later, Teodor and Latzi are the \\"stars\\" of a highly publicized book tour throughout the United States, detailing Teodor's courageous work against communism and his harrowing escape from death. = Part six = After delighting Ned's students with a lighthearted story about how the Circus recruited a South American diplomat with a secret passion for British model trains, Smiley sobers and reflects that intelligence officers usually remain aloof from the harsher realities of their work, but sometimes they are forced to confront it, and become a little more humble about the risks they ask their agents to take. The Circus receives a surprise message from a Polish agent who was thought to have been killed in the aftermath of Haydon's exposure. Despite the risks, Ned is sent to re-establish contact, posing as a Dutch businessman. Once he arrives, he finds that the whole thing is a trap; the agent is long-dead, and Ned is arrested and brutally tortured by the Poles' ruthless counterintelligence chief, Colonel Jerzy. Despite this, he refuses to abandon his cover story or reveal any information. Then Jerzy takes Ned to the countryside and tells him that he wishes to spy for the Circus, but will work only through Ned ‚Äì Ned's interrogation was a test, to make sure Jerzy had the right man as his handler. Over the next five years, Ned runs Jerzy, who provides copious amounts of information about the Polish intelligence. Throughout their correspondence, Ned tries to uncover Jerzy's motive for helping the British, eliminating many known motives such as money, disillusionment, and change of heart, but Jerzy remains opaque to Ned's prying. Ultimately, Jerzy reveals that his \\"motive\\" was simply the element of danger it introduced to his profoundly cynical and nihilistic outlook to life. Years later, several weeks before the graduation dinner, Ned sees Jerzy on the television while watching the evening news about a Polish cardinal blessing his flock. Ned observes Jerzy, who seems physically drained and haggard after the collapse of the Soviet Union, is then summoned to the cardinal. To Ned's surprise, Jerzy kneels before the cardinal, who had wavered through an instinctive fear, and receives his blessing. Ned realises that the cardinal must have been one of Jerzy's many torture victims. = Part seven = Smiley warns Ned's students that spies can encounter a mid-life crisis the same as any others do, and sometimes the effects are more severe, given the nature of their work and their inclination to keep their true feelings concealed from everyone, including themselves. Ned remembers his own middle-age crisis, in which his marriage had grown stale and he began to feel that he had reached his forties without any clear idea of what he had accomplished in his career. After gaining a reasonable amount of seniority and prestige, thanks to the kudos accruing from his productive running of Colonel Jerzy, Ned is appointed as a sort of roving troubleshooter, hopping around the globe to investigate random leads or smother minor crises. One of his assignments takes him to Beirut, where the chaos of the latest fighting seems to mirror his own inner turmoil. While tracking a German militant named Britta, who had been involved with an Irish terrorist called Seamus, his first stop is a brief research post with a well-mannered officer named Giles Latimer. Despite his good nature and popularity, it is revealed that Giles had suffered a nervous breakdown and hid dozens of confidential files out of shame and guilt he felt towards a young girl he had fallen in love with. Following this episode, Ned flies to Beirut in search of an informer and checks into a hotel, where he receives a phone call from an American woman who flirts with him but remains unknown despite Ned's inquiries to the hotel clerk. Ned's Lebanon trip ends with his encounter with a young American student, who was the sole survivor of a car bombing on a downtown restaurant in Beirut. The student, Saul, in his shell-shocked state of delirium, had written a call for peace. Ned sees whether he could find something sensible, but in his own state of personal crisis, scribbles his own thoughts as well and ends up burning the whole thing. = Part eight = One of Ned's students argues to Smiley that professional journalists do the same job as spies do, and may even do it better, so why bother with intelligence services at all? Instead of disagreeing, Smiley says she has an excellent point ‚Äì the trouble is, no government will ever trust advice from a journalist, no matter how sound. Smiley assures these future agents that their jobs will always be necessary, and always in demand. Ned is ordered to travel to Saigon to track down a Circus agent who has gone missing, a lapsed Catholic missionary named Hansen. Also half-Dutch, Hansen was born to an English mother who had provided him with Jesuit education. An accomplished polyglot from an early age, he had received religious training and was sent to the East. Along with his many accomplishments in the fields of archaeology, linguistics and various branches of humanities, Hansen also harboured an open secret about his sexuality, bedding young girls and boys alike. Having been recalled to Rome for indoctrination and subsequently sent back to a harsh master of his Order, Hansen later went berserk on his colleagues due to his confinement and disappeared in Southern Asia. After a certain period, he presented himself to the British authorities, offering his vast knowledge of the Orient for espionage. Due to the unconventional and unmotorised guerrilla tactics of locals, Hansen's services were invaluable to the British, who had no material presence in the region, and sold his intelligence to the Americans who were knee-deep in conflict against the Viet Cong. However, at some point Hansen disappears without notice and is later given up for dead, in view of the total eradication of hill villages in the region. Later, local residency catches sight of Hansen through one of their informants who had been working closely with the local head of station, Rumbelow. Despite his distaste for Rumbelow, whom he views as sleazy and thoroughly perfidious, Ned tracks down Hansen, who is working as the bouncer in a brothel. Hansen recounts that he learned that he had an illegitimate daughter who was captured by a revolutionary band in Cambodia. Hansen allowed himself to be taken prisoner as well, intending to rescue her, but was horrified when she was genuinely converted to their ideals, and denounced him as a spy and a traitor. After a hellish journey through the Cambodian jungle, Hansen eventually escaped after his daughter went missing from the band. She is now a prostitute in the brothel, her psyche damaged by her experiences in the jungle. Hansen wants nothing more to do with the Circus, with England, or with any political cause ‚Äì his sole purpose in life is to watch over her. Despite Ned's offer of gratuity of $50,000, Hansen turns it down and chastises Ned -and by extension, all representation of Western imperialism - for their treatment of Asia. On his way back to London, Ned fancies the idea of sending Rumbelow, and in fact the whole Circus, Smiley included, on Hansen's trail for them to witness true and unfaltering devotion, as he regarded Hansen as the champion of his ambiguous and conflicted emotions about his calling in life. Ned returns to London, having set his own misgivings to rest, finding them insignificant next to Hansen's suffering, and his single-minded devotion to his daughter. A few years later (during the events of The Russia House), when \\"Barley\\" Blair betrays the Circus to save a Russian woman he has fallen in love with, Ned is unable to muster the same outrage as his superiors. = Part nine = One of Ned's more amoral students is trying to get Smiley to agree that espionage gives its practitioners license to do anything, if it is necessary to get the job done. Smiley refuses to be pinned down, remarking that it is important for spies to feel conflicted about their own actions ‚Äì and if any of them in the midst of an operation feel the impulse to act humanely, he hopes they will give it a fair hearing. After being relieved of his position as head of the Russia House, Ned is sent to the \\"Interrogators' Pool,\\" a division not held in high regard within the service. In addition to supplying interrogators to debrief defectors or captured enemy agents, the Pool acts as a clearing-house for suspicious members of the public who believe they have relevant information for the government. While browsing through the Pool's old files, Ned is excited to find an old record from Smiley's tenure there (after being relieved of his position as Chief at the end of The Honourable Schoolboy). Smiley interviewed a retired British Army sergeant who wanted to know: a) if it was true, and b) if true, could he be told, that his recently deceased son was actually a top-class undercover agent in Russia? The sergeant and his wife always believed their son was just a convict, but during the father's last visit, shortly before his son's death (apparently in a prison riot), the son claimed that his criminal identity was just a cover for his secret agent work. Despite his inner scepticism, Smiley does his best to verify or disprove the boy's story. After an exhaustive search through the records of the Circus and other British government agencies, and a review of the boy's extensive criminal record, Smiley is forced to conclude that the boy was \\"an irredeemable and habitual monster,\\" that his sordid death was no more than he deserved, and he has never had the slightest connection with the Circus or any other government service. However, when the sergeant and his wife return for a second interview with Smiley, he tells them that, officially, the British government denies any knowledge of his son, while unofficially he gives them a set of superb gold cufflinks ‚Äì one of the fanciful details of the son's story was that he and other top class agents were issued with special cufflinks instead of medals. The elderly couple departs the office, swelling with pride at their son's heroism. Ned later learns that the cufflinks were an anniversary gift from Smiley's wife, Ann. At first glance, George's motives seemed clear: sentimentality, or spitefulness towards his unfaithful wife and the Circus that was rejecting him. But Ned's private theory is that Smiley, who was ambivalent at the best of times about the usefulness of the Circus's work, wanted to carry out an \\"intelligence operation\\" that clearly succeeded in achieving something good. = Part ten = Smiley likens some interrogations to communions between damaged souls, referring to his debriefing of his old nemesis, Karla During his tenure at the Interrogator's Pool, Ned receives an anonymous letter of denunciation against Cyril Arthur Frewin, a Foreign Office cipher clerk who had allegedly been keeping company with Sergei Modrian, a Soviet handler with whom Ned had a brush in the Russia House. After being briefed by Leonard Burr, the new Chief, Ned interviews Frewin's section head at the Foreign Office, alongside his associates from the Circus, for further information on Frewin. After learning of Frewin's annual vacations (and his constant disappearances from his hotel in Salzburg, Austria) Ned confronts Frewin. Ned edges up Frewin's radio language courses in Russian and his Eastern Bloc contacts, attempting to verify the contents of the letter of denunciation he had received, aided by the findings of Toby Esterhase and Monty Arbuck, whom Ned had requested to make inquiries. After much deliberation, Ned has Frewin admit his collaboration with Sergei Modrian as a result of Frewin's participation in the Radio Moscow's Russian language course. After writing to the Radio Moscow programme a veiled account of his life, Sergei Modrian had shown up at Frewin's house as a \\"gift\\" for Frewin's \\"success\\" in his Russian language progress. Eventually, Modrian manipulates Frewin's solitude into betrayal as Modrian \\"regretfully\\" asked for intelligence material from Frewin's access to top secret and above. However, shortly before Frewin's denunciation, Modrian returns to Moscow and reveals to Frewin that their relationship is over. Frewin becomes despondent and depressed, leading him to denounce himself in hopes of getting in touch with somebody who would replace Modrian in his life. Frewin reveals to Ned all his equipment provided by Moscow Centre, including a custom-made pair of opera binoculars that doubled as a covert camera. = Part eleven = Smiley completes his lecture, preparing to take his leave from Sarratt, along with the secret world as well. His last advice to the new recruits is to leave the old timers - like Smiley himself - and find new people to look up to. A few days before his retirement from his tenure as Chief Leonard Burr's Secretary, Ned is given a last assignment. Burr orders Ned to negotiate with Sir Anthony Bradshaw, a venture-capitalist who had been enabled by former Circus chief, Sir Percy Alleline, to expand his financial empire while helping the Circus. However, after Alleline's disgrace and demise, Bradshaw began ferrying weaponry to various regions, such as the Balkans and Central Africa, to profit from the conflicts there. Ned makes his way to Bradshaw's sumptuous country estate and politely warns him to desist from his war-profiteering activities. Bradshaw is unfazed, as he knows more about the workings of the government than he's supposed to know. He defends his ferocious profiteering policies and Ned regretfully realises that despite his years in the secret world, he was not prepared for this \\"wrecking infant in our midst\\". Ned closes his life in the Service in a kind of retirement in the country with Mabel. ‚ÄúI think a lot. I‚Äôm stepping out with my reading. I talk to people, ride on buses. I‚Äôm a newcomer to the overt world, but I‚Äôm learning.\\"  Common themes  Smiley's sections of the book are quite brief; the bulk of the book consists of Ned's reminiscences, prompted by his interpretation of tangential comments made by Smiley and illuminated from his own experiences. At the end of the penultimate chapter, Smiley instructs them not to invite him again. The final chapter is unconnected with Smiley; Ned recollects Leonard Burr, who appears in the novel The Night Manager, foreshadowing, in retrospect, the development of that story. The themes of the book are Smiley's sense of the moral ambiguity of spying, and Ned's growing self-awareness. Characters The following characters appear throughout the novel, as people in British Intelligence and in the narrator Ned's life: Ned: The protagonist, an elder Circus member and the retired director of Sarratt training programme. Son of an Anglo-Dutch mother whose husband was killed during the Second World War, Ned was brought up by her mother and her relatives, eventually joining British Intelligence. Recruited in the early 1960s, Ned's career prospects waxed and waned through the turmoils of the Cold War. Readers never actually learn Ned's surname. Although Monty Arbuck calls him \\"College,\\" that seems to be a way for Monty to try to take Ned down a peg: in Part One Ned is the \\"college kid\\" who has been assigned to the hard- working, more blue-collar class, career-long surveillance crew. George Smiley: Ned's guest of honour, Smiley is widely considered to be the legend of the Service. A venerated member of the Circus, Smiley served through the Second World War and the subsequent Cold War with distinction. His self-effacing personal manner belies his cunning, his comprehensive memory and capability for professional ruthlessness, while he displays kindness and good manners. Toby Esterhase: Hungarian-born former head of Lamplighter Section, who deal with surveillance. Later Ned's desk officer and subsequently Head of Station in Vienna. Toby is said to have an infinite capacity for survival, which explains his tenure even after his cohorts were disgraced after Bill Haydon's betrayal. Leonard Burr: Chief of Circus and Ned's immediate boss. Defined as absurdly young for his job, Burr is claimed to be George Smiley's crown prince for years after being saved by Smiley from 'a fate worse than death' at All Souls. Personnel: The eponymous head of Circus staff who distributes assignments and conducts inquiries. Monty Arbuck: Head of the Watchers, who briefs and commands Circus clandestine observation teams. Mabel: Ned's wife. Although he has been unfaithful to her many times, and they are separated for a while, at the conclusion they are maintaining a mostly comfortable marriage.

Its southern terminus is at U.S. Route 209 (US 209) in the Chestnuthill Township hamlet of Brodheadsville. The northern terminus is at PA 191 in the Paradise Township hamlet of Henryville. PA 715 also intersects Interstate 80 (I-80) in Tannersville at Exit 299\\\\. The route is a two-lane undivided road running through forested areas of the Pocono Mountains. The road was paved between 1930 and the 1940s. PA 715 was designated to its present alignment in 1963. Route description PA 715 northbound in Tannersville PA 715 begins at an intersection with US 209 in the community of Brodheadsville in Chestnuthill Township, heading north on a two- lane undivided road. The road passes a mix of rural homes and fields before continuing into forested areas with a few housing developments. Farther north, the route passes a mix of farms, woods, and homes as it comes to the community of McMichaels and makes a sharp turn to the east. PA 715 enters Jackson Township and heads into wooded areas of residential subdivisions as it turns northeast and passes Grubers Lake and Trout Lake. After the latter, the road heads more to the north and passes through Reeders. The route heads northeast into Pocono Township and runs through woods with some commercial development, passing to the southeast of the Northampton Community College Monroe Campus before reaching to an interchange with I-80. PA 715 at its northern terminus with PA 191 in Paradise Township From here, PA 715 intersects Sullivan Trail, which provides access to The Crossings Premium Outlets, Camelback Mountain Resort, Big Pocono State Park, and westbound I-80. After this, the route crosses Pocono Creek and forms a short wrong-way concurrency with PA 611 in Tannersville. Past PA 611, the highway continues northeast through dense forests with occasional areas of wooded housing developments. In the community of Meisertown, PA 715 intersects the eastern terminus of PA 314. Following this intersection, the route continues into Paradise Township and passes through more forests before ending at PA 191 in the community of Henryville. History When routes were first legislated in Pennsylvania in 1911, what is now PA 715 was not given a number. By 1930, the present-day route was an unpaved road between US 209 in Brodheadsville and McMichaels and a paved road between McMichaels and US 611 in Tannersville. The road between US 611 in Tannersville and PA 90 (now PA 191) in Henryville existed as a paved road by 1940. In the 1940s, the road between Brodheadsville and McMichaels was paved. PA 715 was designated on April 8, 1963 to follow its current alignment between US 209 in Brodheadsville and PA 191 in Henryville. PA 715 was signed in order to provide a route number at the I-80 interchange in Tannersville. Major intersections PA 715 Truck Pennsylvania Route 715 Truck is a truck route of PA 715 that bypasses a weight-restricted bridge over the Pocono Creek in Pocono Township, on which trucks over 21 tons and combination loads over 25 tons are prohibited.

Workman (5 May 1872Birth registration, June 1872 quarter, West Derby registration district, volume 8b, page 469 ‚Äì 1 May 1923) was a singer and actor best known as a successor to George Grossmith in the comic baritone roles in Gilbert and Sullivan operas. He was sometimes credited as C. Herbert Workman or C. H. Workman. Life and career Charles Herbert Workman was born in Bootle, on the outskirts of Liverpool, Lancashire, and studied singing under his brother, Albert Edward Workman, in Liverpool. =D'Oyly Carte years= A newcomer to the stage, he joined the D'Oyly Carte Opera Company in 1894 as Calynx in a provincial tour of Utopia, Limited. In 1895, he also played the roles of Pedrillo in The Chieftain, Mr. Bunthorne's Solicitor in Patience and Pennyfather in After All!, the curtain raiser for a revival of The Mikado. Workman then created the small part of Ben Hashbaz in The Grand Duke (1896). He later created the part of Adam in F. C. Burnand and R. C. Lehmann's His Majesty (1897; appearing briefly as King Ferdinand when George Grossmith abandoned the part, until Henry Lytton took over). Workman was Simon in Old Sarah, the companion piece for the first revival of The Yeomen of the Guard (1897). In The Grand Duchess of Gerolstein that year, he also played Carl. as Bunthorne, with Clara Dow (left) and Louie Ren√© Beginning in 1897, Workman was promoted to principal comedian of the main repertory touring company, appearing as the Lord Chancellor in Iolanthe, Ko-Ko in The Mikado, and Jack Point in Yeomen. He toured with D'Oyly Carte until 1906, appearing as John Wellington Wells in The Sorcerer, Sir Joseph Porter in H.M.S. Pinafore, Major-General Stanley in The Pirates of Penzance, Reginald Bunthorne in Patience, the Lord Chancellor, King Gama in Princess Ida, Ko-Ko, Jack Point, the Duke of Plaza-Toro in The Gondoliers, and Scaphio in Utopia. He also appeared as Hassan in The Rose of Persia (1901) and as the Learned Judge in Trial by Jury beginning in 1904. After a brief tour of South Africa with his own companyUK and Ireland, Incoming Passenger Lists, 1878‚Äì1960 for C. H. Workman, Southampton, England, 1906, Aug: Ancestry.com he returned to the Savoy Theatre in 1906 and played the principal comedian roles created by George Grossmith for the company's repertory seasons there and on tour with the company, until 1909, except that he never played a role in Ruddigore, as that opera was not in the D'Oyly Carte repertory during his tenure. In 1907, The Times wrote, \\"As the Duke of Plaza-Toro, Mr. Workman surpasses both his predecessors\\".The Times review of The Gondoliers , 23 January 1907 Of his Jack Point, the paper wrote: \\"His patter is delivered with a clearness that neither of the older performers could surpass; he dances as lightly as either, and has as spontaneous a sense of fun. His was the chief triumph of Saturday night.\\"The Times review of The Yeomen of the Guard , 10 December 1906 However, The Times warned Workman, \\"in Patience [he] makes the grave mistake of trying to add fun of his own by clowning to the part of Bunthorne. He is too clever an actor to be allowed to go on in this path without warning.\\"The Times review of Patience , 5 April 1907 Workman redeemed himself in Iolanthe: \\"The Lord Chancellor of Mr. Workman is a masterpiece, and the whole audience were of one mind as to the double encore for the dancing trio, and the 'Nightmare' song was sung with marvellous glibness.\\" The Times review of Iolanthe , 12 June 1907 In Yeomen, when Workman was playing Jack Point, in one scene he stood between the ladies portraying Elsie Maynard and Phoebe Meryll. Workman wrote: \\"I used to kiss the cheek of first one and then the other, quickly and repeatedly, and Sir William thought there was too much kissing for a Savoy audience. 'You would cut the kissing, then?' I said. 'I would not', he returned drolly, 'but I must ask you to.'\\"Workman, C. H. \\"Recollections of Sir W. S.

He leased the Savoy and produced two comic operas: Eden & Somerville's The Mountaineers (1909), appearing as Pierre, and W. S. Gilbert and Edward German's Fallen Fairies (1909), appearing as Lutin. He then produced an Edwardian musical comedy, Two Merry Monarchs (1910), appearing as Rolandyl, and an opera, Gluck's Orpheus, (1910). None of these was a financial success. The production of Fallen Fairies was particularly disappointing, leading to a serious battle between Workman and Gilbert. Workman expected Gilbert's libretto, based on Gilbert's successful earlier play The Wicked World, to be followed by more works with the dramatist.Shepherd, Marc. \\"Introduction: Historical Context\\", The Grand Duke (piano score), p. xxvii, New York: Oakapple Press, 2009.

In 1914, he travelled to Australia where he once again appeared in Gilbert and Sullivan operas with the J. C. Williamson Gilbert and Sullivan Opera Company (1918 and thereafter). In 1919, Rupert D'Oyly Carte wrote to Workman asking him to return to the D'Oyly Carte company: \\"We intend to present Gilbert and Sullivan at the Savoy again, and if we knew you would be coming to London, we would await your arrival, so that your reappearance and the revival of Gilbert and Sullivan opera might be made two important simultaneous events.

Hamilton, the fourteenth book in the Anita Blake: Vampire Hunter series. Explanation of the title Danse Macabre is French for \\"Dance of Death\\". The phrase historically refers to a late-medieval allegory of the universality of death, in which Death personified summons people to the world beyond the grave despite their objections. Originally a dramatic performance, in the centuries since it has been represented in art, poetry, and music. The modern superstition is simply that \\"Death\\" appears at midnight every year on Halloween. He calls forth the dead from their graves to dance for him while he plays his fiddle. The skeletons dance until the rooster crows at dawn, when they must return to their graves until the next year. Within the novel, \\"Danse Macabre\\" is the name of the vampire ballet company that performs during the course of the novel's events. It also refers to the general \\"vampire politics\\" that serve as the central conflict in the plot. Although \\"Danse Macabre\\" is also the name of a vampire-themed nightclub owned by Jean-Claude, the nightclub appears only briefly at the end of this novel. Plot summary =Summary= Danse Macabre appears to take place a few weeks after the events of Incubus Dreams and almost immediately after the events of Micah, assuming that the series of serial killings that Anita's friend Ronnie refers to as occurring two weeks earlier are the killings Anita investigates in Incubus Dreams. Unlike the previous thirteen novels, neither Anita's role as a Federal Marshal nor her job as a zombie animator plays any part in this novel. Instead, Anita must juggle a series of problems arising from her own increasing power, Jean-Claude's vampire politics, and her own personal life, complicated in this case by Anita's apparent pregnancy. * First, Anita believes that she may be pregnant. This forces her to confront the difficult choice of whether to bring the child to term, as well as whether to inform the various potential fathers. (Richard, Nathaniel, Jean-Claude, Asher, and Damian). ** Richard and Nathaniel are the most likely candidates for fatherhood; Micah had a lycanthrope vasectomy (silver clamps on the vas deferens); vampires in this world are capable of fathering a child, either via sperm created prior to their death for the newly dead, or if their body temperature is kept elevated for a long enough period of time to create new sperm, but the likelihood goes down with age. A vampire over the age of 100 is not a likely candidate. ** Micah and Nathaniel are willing to rearrange their lives to take on the primary parenting responsibilities. By contrast, Richard proposes monogamous marriage and expects that Anita will stop being a vampire executioner and federal marshal. ** A child of Anita's would have a significant risk of birth defects. Previous books have mentioned \\"Vlad Syndrome\\", occurring in children of vampires, which in severe cases results in death of both the child and the mother. Anita is also at risk of \\"Mowgli Syndrome\\", which can occur when a shapeshifter has intercourse in animal (or part-animal) form. Not all details are discussed, but it is noted that the fetus can develop at the rate of the beast instead of human -- which could put Anita past the legal abortion threshold in only a few weeks or months, depending on the animal. * Second, Anita's increasing powers continue to lead to new problems. In particular, Anita is attempting to select a pomme de sang from a variety of candidates, leading to a series of conflicts between various persons who wish to join her harem of lovers. In addition, she discovers that her ardeur has been shaping both her own and her lovers' feelings and personalities, making Anita question whether her love for Micah and Nathaniel is real. Finally, Anita discovers that she may be a pan-were, and that in addition to being the dominant female of the local wolf and leopard pack, she may also become Regina, or Queen, of the local werelion pack, leading to a conflict between the lions eager to become her Rex, or lion king. * Third, Anita is involved in a variety of conflicts relating to vampire politics, largely relating to Jean-Claude's decision to invite a vampire ballet and several master vampires to St. Louis. ** Augustine, the master of Chicago, Illinois, attempts to force Anita to love him, and hopes to control the local were-lion pack by introducing a dominant were-lion of his choosing. ** Thea‚Äîwho is not only the wife of the master of Cape Cod but a siren‚Äîwishes Anita to sleep with one or all of her three sons, in the hope that Anita can bring them into their power. ** Merlin, head of the vampire ballet, attempts to mentally dominate all of the master vampires and lycanthropes present at the performance, for reasons he will not reveal. ** Meng Die is becoming increasingly jealous of Anita's irresistibility to the men in their circle, to the point where she attempts to kill Requiem ** Both Belle Morte and The Mother of Darkness continue their attempts to dominate Anita. Ultimately, Anita resolves most of these conflicts: * After reluctantly deciding to have the baby, Anita ultimately learns that she is not pregnant, and that her positive test result was caused by her unique body chemistry. * Anita learns to accept that her love may be manufactured in part by the ardeur, particularly in the cases of Nathaniel and Micah, both of whom have had their personalities shaped by the ardeur to meet Anita's needs (and vice versa). She accepts that she possesses several metaphysical \\"beasts,\\" and rejects Haven, a dominant were-lion that Augustine hoped to use to dominate the St. Louis pack. * Anita is also able to navigate most of the challenges raised by vampire politics. ** Using the ardeur, Anita and Jean-Claude bind Augustine, increasing their own power. They also turn the tables on him by feeding not only on him, but on his entourage. (Although Anita now loves Augustine, she is sufficiently stubborn that this love does not gain him an advantage). ** Anita promises to sleep with Thea's oldest son to see if she can raise his powers through the ardeur. ** Anita defeats Merlin's attempt to dominate the assembled vampires and shape-shifters, and questions him for information about the Mother of Darkness. ** The combined threat of Anita, Jean-Claude, and all of their vampires is enough to make Meng Die agree not to kill anyone for the night. ** Anita is able to evade Belle Morte and the Mother of Darkness's attempts to control her, although she continues to fear them. =Unresolved plotlines= Due to the small amount of time lapsed in this novel (the events last only a day), Anita is unable to resolve any of the plotlines left open in Incubus Dreams, and leaves several questions unresolved in this book as well. * Although the epilogue to Incubus Dreams stated that Anita intended to investigate the Stevie Brown murder soon, the narration does not reveal whether Anita has made progress in her investigation. * Danse Macabre does not reveal whether Gregory and Stephen have learned anything about why their father has reappeared, a plotline that was mentioned, but not resolved, in Cerulean Sins and Incubus Dreams. * Anita mentions that Jean-Claude has bound a few of Malcolm's vampires to his own service, but there is no apparent resolution of the threat presented by the remainder of his vampires, none of whom are blood oathed to anyone. * Anita does not appear to have made any progress on her hunt for Vittorio and his vampires. * Although The Mother of Darkness continues to make threats, it remains to be seen when she will actually awake, or what will become of Belle Morte's challenge for council leadership. * Anita has now promised to sleep with Thea's son in an attempt to raise his powers as a siren. * Although Anita has sent Haven back to Chicago, she nevertheless needs to select a lion to match with her inner lioness, and any lion of sufficient power to match her may threaten Joseph's hold on his pride. * Although Anita suspects she is now a pan-were, she has not yet shifted form, and doesn't know if she will assume the form of a single animal, all the species with which she is infected, or none of them. In addition, blood tests show that Anita has an \\"unknown strain\\" of lycanthropy, which she has not yet identified. And there is a possibility that she got an additional one with the blood transfusion at the end of the book. Characters  =Major characters= Danse Macabre features the following major characters. * Anita Blake: Anita continues her acceptance of her supernatural powers and unusual lifestyle. In particular, Anita accepts that the ardeur may have shaped Micah's, Nathaniel's, and her personalities to make them more compatible partners for one another. Anita also seems only momentarily concerned by the discoveries that she may be a shape-shifter or that her roles as a succubus and as Regina of the local were-lion pride may require her to take on several new lovers. In her personal life, while she continues to resist the idea of permitting her lovers (other than Richard) to take female lovers in addition to her, Anita begins to accept the idea of her lovers taking other male lovers, particularly in the case of Jean-Claude and Asher. * Jean-Claude: After several books in which he struggled to maintain his hold as Master of St. Louis, Jean-Claude appears to have reached a position of relative comfort. He has now assembled a formidable group of master vampires, and, through Anita and Richard, enjoys good relations with most of the city's lycanthropes. Personally, his relationship with Asher is at its best in centuries, while Anita appears to have largely accepted her role as his human servant and embraced the ardeur. He and Anita block two challenges Augustine relatively easily and may have bent Augustine to their will by addicting him to their combined ardeur. Jean-Claude's major remaining problems appear to be his relationship with Richard, who struggles against the idea of a closer political or personal relationship with Jean-Claude, and the possibility of a challenge by the Vampire Council, the Mother of Darkness, or an alliance of other City Masters threatened by Jean-Claude and Anita's rapidly growing power. * Richard: Hamilton continues to develop Richard's relationships with Anita and Jean-Claude and his acceptance of his own supernatural nature, although the development in each area continues to lag far behind Anita's parallel journey. As usual, Richard alternates violently between deep resentment of Anita and Jean-Claude and acceptance of his relationship with each of them, but he appears to be accepting his relationships and his supernatural nature, albeit more slowly than Anita. Although he continues to resent both of them, and to search for a permanent girlfriend to replace Anita, Richard largely accepts that he is part of the triumvirate. While he continues to hope that Anita will \\"settle down\\" with him alone, he appears willing to accept his and Anita's sexual relationship until something better comes along. * Jason: Jason has only a minor role in this novel, largely continuing to support his friends Anita and Nathaniel. In addition, he has apparently developed into one of Anita's occasional sex partners, and reports that he has \\"checked out\\" one of the visitors. * Micah: Michah's role in this novel is also fairly minimal. Although Micah accompanies Anita for many of the events of the novel, his major plot contributions are as one of Anita's sex partners and as a focus for Richard's jealousy. Like Nathaniel, Micah is very supportive of whatever choice Anita makes when she believes she might be pregnant, and, like Nathaniel, Micah appears unconcerned by the possibility that the ardeur has shaped his personality to meet Anita's needs. * Nathaniel: Danse Macabre shows Nathaniel's ongoing maturation. Either as a result of his growing older, his triumvirate with Anita and Damian, or both, Nathaniel has developed into a more mature and less needy person than in earlier novels. According to Anita, Nathaniel has grown taller, and we see him challenge Ronnie, Richard, and Anita's various suitors, an action that would be unthinkable when the character was first introduced. * Asher: Danse Macabre heightens Asher's apparent role as representative of the darker sides of Anita's sexual awakening. Anita accepts that she has become addicted to the limitless pleasure that Asher can bring, and both Anita and Asher accept, for the first time, that Anita's love for Asher is real and not simply an artifact of her connection with Jean-Claude. However, loving Asher comes with a price for Anita, both emotional, as she surrenders her self-control more completely than she has with any of her other lovers, and physical, as Anita and Asher lose control under the force of their combined powers, nearly killing Anita. In addition, Asher continues to come into his own power as a master vampire, gaining the power to call hyenas and werehyenas. * Damian: Damian continues to be one of the more passive of Anita's primary harem. His major roles in Danse Macabre seem to be appearing when Anita needs to share his self-control and occasionally threatening to die unless Anita has sex to generate more power to sustain him. =Other characters= Recurring characters include: * Ronnie: Ronnie continues her fight with Anita, which has been resolving, then flaring up, for the last few novels. Under questioning from Anita and Nathaniel, Ronnie ultimately admits that she is scared of commitment with Louis, and jealous of Anita's harem. * Requiem: Requiem ends up hooked on the ardeur, a problem which is continually addressed throughout the book. * Meng Die: In this novel, Hamilton develops Meng Die's character, revealing that (1) Meng Die does not possess any form of the ardeur; (2) she is powerful and ambitious enough that her last master was glad to see her go, rather than risk the chance that Meng Die would depose him; and (3) that Meng Die is deeply resentful of Anita because most or all of Meng Die's lovers prefer Anita to her. Although Meng Die ends the novel promising not to kill anyone that evening, Hamilton seems to be setting her up for later conflict with Jean- Claude or Anita. * Graham: A werewolf of Richard's pack who wants to be one of the people Anita feeds off of. * Claudia: In this novel, Claudia shows herself to be Anita's most reliable bodyguard, as well as one of the few women with whom Anita can discuss her various problems. * Fredo: * Joseph: Rex of the St. Louis Pride (Were-lion Leader) * Valentina: * Wicked: A master vampire. * Truth: Wicked's brother and also a vampire. He's almost killed to capture a fleeing vampire from The Church of Eternal on Anita's command. * London: A master vampire of Bella Morte's line that recently moved to St. Louis often called \\"The Dark Knight\\". He can feed the ardeur every two hours, making him a potential potent Pomme de Sang, but as drawback he becomes addicted to the ardeur. London made a deal with Jean-Claude to protect him from his addiction, and Belle Morte who had used it against him. Non-recurring characters include: * Elinore: * Samuel: Master of Cape Cod; Animal to call is mermaids. * Leucothea: \\"Thea\\" is a siren, and is Samuel's wife. * Sampson: Samuel and Thea's oldest son. * Thomas: One of Samuel and Thea's twin sons. * Cristof: One of Samuel and Thea's twin sons. *Augustine: Master of the City of Chicago; Craves the ardeur; animal to calls are lions. * Haven: A potential Rex to Anita's Regina; under command of Augustine. *Pierce: A werelion under command of Augustine. *Merlin: Unofficially the Merlin of urban legend. A very powerful master vampire created by Marmee Noir who runs a ballet tour of other vampires. Animal to call: birds *Adonis: Part of Merlin's travelling dance troupe. Critical reception The critical reception of Danse Macabre has been mixed. Robert Folsom of the Kansas City Star wrote a critical review, stating: In contrast, a Denver Post review took a more positive view of the eroticism in Hamilton's work. Although the Post review noted that \\"[t]hose looking for mystery and mayhem on this Anita adventure are out of luck\\" and \\"it will be interesting to see how long Hamilton can sustain a large audience while avoiding the sort of solid plots that were characteristic of her earlier novels,\\" the review was largely positive, writing that \\"the main attraction of the Anita Blake novels in the past five years has been their erotic novelty,\\" and \\"[f]ew, if any, mainstream novels delve so deeply into pure, unadulterated erotica.\\" References External links *Chapters One-Three via Laurellkhamilton.org *Official Site *Official Blog 2006 American novels American erotic novels Anita Blake: Vampire Hunter novels Low fantasy novels Novels set in St. Louis Berkley Books books ","title":"Danse Macabre (novel)"},{"id":"5737723","text":"Liu Xuan is the name of: *Gengshi Emperor (died 25 AD), personal name Liu Xuan, emperor of the Han dynasty *Liu Xuan (Three Kingdoms) (224‚Äì264), crown prince of Shu during the Three Kingdoms period *Liu Xuan (gymnast) (born 1979), Chinese gymnast, singer and actress *Xuan Liu (poker player) (born 1985), Canadian poker player ","title":"Liu Xuan"},{"id":"5737735","text":"Deep Run is an unincorporated community in southern Lenoir County, North Carolina, United States.

Early life and education Andre-Marie Mbida was born on 1 January 1917 in Edinding (Cameroon) and died 2 May 1980 in Paris (France).He hailed from Nyong and Sanaga region of Cameroon. He was born into the traditional aristocracy as the son of a mixed race Traditional ruler Simon Monbele Ongo Nanga chief of Ngo logou and Edinding who led a rebellion against the German invaders and Ngono Veronique . Andr√© Marie MBIDA went to the rural primary school of Efok (Leki√© division) and was a brilliant student. He then continued his secondary education at the Minor Seminary Akono from 1929 to 1935, where he became a mathematics and Latin teacher, and later on at the Major Seminary Mvoly√© from 1935 to 1943. While studying in the grand Seminaire he became a friend of the future presidents Fulbert Youlou and Barth√©l√©my Boganda. He was for a while tempted by the idea of becoming a priest, but after he left the Seminary, he became Head Teacher of the Balessing rural school in 1943. He was very intelligent so he completed his studies and at least graduated as a lawyer in 1945. After completing his training in Law, he worked at the treasury in Yaound√© for a year in 1945, and then became a business representative in Yaound√© and Ebolowa till 1954.

Political career  = Break with Aujoulat and foundation of COCOCAM = He devoted himself to the cause of workers and peasants of Cameroon. In his region of origin, he promoted cultural values in the traditional movement named Anacsama. Known as a devout Catholic, very close ties continue to unite him with the Catholic hierarchy, nevertheless he became closer to the French Socialist Party (SFIO), an active political French party in the UN Trust Territory of the Cameroons under French administration. He is a Cameroonian Democratic Bloc () militant, a party affiliated with the SFIO. In 1952, he was elected to the Territorial Assembly and after that he is appointed Adviser to the French Union on 10 October 1953. The following year he resigned from the Cameroonian Democratic Bloc then he founded the COCOCAM (Coordinating Committee of Cameroon) (). The reasons for his departure are interpreted differently, depending on whether one is in favour of Andr√©-Marie Mbida or Louis-Paul Aujoulat. According to Ateba Yene (son), Andr√©-Marie Mbida was just the spokesperson of COCOCAM. Its founders would be Manga Mado Ngoa Constantine Ombgwa On√©simus, Master Joseph Ateba and Ateba Yen√© (father). According to an anonymous and unsigned note (the author of this epistle chose not to sign his name but offered his observation about Ajoulat-Mbida affair) dated 17 May 1954, the break between the Bloc and Mbida would come from the fact that the chairman of Bloc, Louis-Paul Aujoulat was convinced that Mbida has been informing his political opponents. Aujoulat let him know about his thoughts and in reaction to this, Mbida decided to leave the Cameroonian Democratic Bloc and create his own movement, the Coordinating Committee of Cameroon. However, Germain Tsala Mekongo, former comrade-in-arms of Mbida, believes that this break is due to the jealousy of the other Cameroonian Democratic Bloc members who were excessively concerned about the growing influence of Andr√©-Marie Mbida within the Bloc. Abel Eyinga rather thinks that it is the opposition of Louis-Paul Aujoulat and the Steering Committee of Cameroonian Democratic Bloc to see Mbida run for the post of Adviser of the Assembly of French Union which is the true cause of the break between the main protagonists. Mbida did not agree with this directive of Louis-Paul Aujoulat and Bloc. Thus, he ran for election and gained seat, then he became Adviser of the Assembly of French Union on 16 October 1953. Moreover, one can read in the Abel Eyinga book \\"Elected in spite of himself, Mbida draws conclusions from the attitude of layman missionary by breaking definitively with him, with the organization Aujoulat oriented () also: \\"the BDC\\".Abel Eyinga, Introduction a la politique camerounaise, p.96 Following the bloody events of May 1955, repressed by the colonial administrator Roland Pr√© then by the dissolution of Cameroonian nationalist movements and the incarceration of several nationalist militants, Mbida led an active campaign for the amnesty for political prisoners.The French National Assembly website : Andr√©-Marie Mbida He also builts on a small mimeographed bulletin, \\"NKU, Le Tam-Tam'‚Äô. = Conquest of the Palais Bourbon = Andr√©-Marie Mbida stood for election to Parliament at the French National Assembly on 2 January 1956 in the third electoral district of the UN Trust Territory of the Cameroons under French administration. Like socialists, he acts as an advocate of poors, small-scale farmers, supports minorities and he includes short-term amelioratory measures and long-term structural solutions for the little people and the oppressed. Economically, he proposes the increasing the price of key export commodities, cocoa and coffee, and the elimination of intermediaries that disadvantage the small-scale farmers. He still defends the officials, the autochthonous or traditional chiefs that he proposes to renumerate. He claims an evolving institutions. He demands a purge of managerial staff in the French Union. He claims \\"a progressive advance from Cameroon to its autonomy, and later to its independence\\" (). In addition, he defends Catholic values. Thus, he advocates the fight \\"against secularism in general\\" (). He wrote: \\"I will defend private education and I shall always support that the territory administration covers the teaching personnel salaries of this one\\" (). He still intends to encourage monogamy and for him, divorce is not an option for religious marriages. He proposes a \\"formal opposition to the divorce of religious marriages\\"(). During the campaign trail, one can read on a leaflet distributed to voters : \\"Voting for Matin Abega, Andr√© Fouda, Charles Awono-Onana, Beno√Æt Bindzi, Marc Etende, Philippe Mbarga ‚Äì It's giving one's vote to Aujoulat ‚Äì It's giving one's vote to Roland Pr√© ‚Äì It's voting for the Cameroonian Democratic Bloc ‚Äì The incorporation of Cameroon into France, the return to the Indigenousness Code (The Code de l'indig√©nat), the tax increases.

The latter held the seat since the Liberation of France and was involved in several government departments from 1949 to 1955. Mbida became the first native Cameroonian to be elected Member of Parliament at the French National Assembly by the College of personal Status (). = Head of autonomous State of Cameroon = On 31 January 1956, Mbida was both appointed to the Law and Justice Commission and to the Commission of overseas territories of the French National Assembly. He also belonged to the Commission mandated to reform the Title VIII of the French Constitution, on the French Union dated 27 October 1947. In addition, he is designated to serve on the Supreme Labour Council and the Steering Committee of the Investment Fund for Economic and Social Development (), that is a former government agency of colonial-area France, which was established to finance and co-ordinate the provision of facilities for the French colonial territories. His election was confirmed on 14 February 1956 and he immediately joined the SFIO Socialist Group at the French National Assembly and worked alongside Gaston Defferre, G√©rard Jaquet and Pierre Messmer who draft the Loi Cadre (1956 Overseas Reform Act) on the autonomy of French colonial territories and the UN trust territories under French administration in Sub-Saharan Africa. NKU, le Tam-Tam in its edition of March 1956 to justify his membership to the SFIO Socialist Group by saying that he could not stand alone at the French National Assembly and that the group's policy SFIO seemed to be the lesser evil among all those existing at that moments at French Parliament. He spoke rarely to the French National Assembly. He mainly took part in two major debates: the Loi Cadre in March 1956 and the status of Cameroon in March 1957. On 23 December 1956, the Territorial Assembly of Cameroon () was replaced by the Legislative Assembly of Cameroon () and parliamentary elections were scheduled. Candidates were authorised to present themselves in their own name. Mbida and his team (Cococam et affiliated memberships) ) stood for election. At ALCAM, they created the Parliamentary Group of Cameroonian Democrats composed of 21 members with Mbida as leader. Mbida set up the internal autonomy of the UN Trust Territory of the Cameroons under French administration. On 16 April 1957, the latter became an autonomous State. On 12 May 1957, by 56 votes against 10 votes and 4 abstentions, he was appointed first President of the Council of Ministers, first head of government and the facto Head of State of French speaking Cameroon. This designation was very symbolic because he was the second African-born Prime Minister in the Sub-Saharan Africa and the first Head of State of Cameroon. While in Paris in September 1957, he presented Cameroon as a pilot State in Africa. Moreover, he justified the UN trust to French administration until the complete independence and a seat (of Cameroon) at the UN, then he announced that this development strengthens the Franco- Cameroonian friendship. Mbida also confronted openly and directly the French, this greatly pleased the Cameroonian people. He has accordingly decided to end racial segregation that occurred in neighbourhoods where white men used to live and in their pubs. He ordered the settlers to remove from their pubs, all offensive posters that they put and which were labelled \\"No dogs and no Blacks'‚Äô. Any settler accused of racism was immediately expelled by his order of Cameroonian territory, once he was notified. Thus, in a few months of power, Andr√©-Marie Mbida expelled more French than what has been done in 50 years of independence. He also crossed swords with the Catholic clergy of Cameroon which was controlled by the French. As a former seminarian, he confronted the white priests on the Cameroonization the clergy. He therefore became the initiator of the movement promoting the designation of Cameroonian priests in parishes. This activism earned him the hatred of Bishop Ren√© Graffin, Bishop of Yaound√©. These actions greatly increased the popularity of Andr√©-Marie Mbida. With 15 members of his caucus, the Cameroonian democrats, he effectively created the Cameroonian Party of Democrats () with the election of the executive committee ‚Äì the adoption of a political platform ‚Äì a motto: \\"God ‚Äì Patrie ‚Äì Justice ‚Äì Equality\\" ‚Äì an emblem: \\"the watchful and brave cock‚Äô‚Äô (used since his election to the Palais Bourbon) at Abong-Mbang, on 12 January 1958. Mbida knew that Cameroon was a relatively young country with no infrastructure nor skilled political elite, and he proposed a project to train a qualified (efficient) elite in a period of ten years. French officials saw that Mbida was an intelligent politician and as he also wanted to end racial segregation, then the French settlers began to criticise him. Indeed, while the Elys√©e asked him to support the idea of granting, in a short term, a somewhat of independence (i.e. an incomplete independence or a puppet independence) of Cameroon, he took deeply offence by saying : \\"(...) what does that mean a somewhat of independence ? either there is an independence or there is not ... It can not be a semi-independence or a semblance of independence (...)\\" ()Enoh Meyomesse, Um Nyob√® le combat interrompu.Enoh Meyomesse, La chute d'Andr√©-Marie Mbida, p.19 He was opposed to this French policy consisting of fudging commitments, he said: \\"for 51 years, you did train Cameroonian people, now you want to go : this is unacceptable\\" (). On 27 February 1959, Andr√©-Marie MBIDA confirmed these manoeuvrings at the United Nations Fourth Committee of the UN General Assembly, he said that: \\"I was flatly opposed to these proposals, because I considered them illegal, and also because I saw in them as the beginnings of integration of Cameroon within the French Union\\" ().Official Records of the United Nations Fourth Committee of the UN General Assembly, 13th session, 885th meeting, p. 605 On 24 October 1957, he introduced to the Legislative Assembly of Cameroon, a bill establishing an emblem of the State of Cameroon. On 26 October 1957, he filled the bill on the adoption of the national anthem \\"The Rallying Song\\", the motto of Cameroon \\"Peace ‚Äì Work ‚Äì Fatherland\\" and National Day \\"on May 10, date of the first session of the Legislative Assembly of Cameroon\\" instead of 14 July, the national day of France.Enoh Meyomesse, La chute d'Andr√©-Marie Mbida, p.21 Nevertheless, the autonomous State of Cameroun under French mandate did not have right to choose an anthem, a motto or a flag that could be different from those in use in France. In addition, the status of 16 April 1957 on the autonomy of the State of Cameroon should have this right.Enoh Meyomesse, La chute d'Andr√©-Marie Mbida, p.22 Furthermore, according to the Trusteeship Agreements for the Territory of the Cameroons under French administration of 13 December 1946, the French administration should have let floating the flag of the United Nations on the administration building in Cameroon. The French colonial administration did not respect this principle by floating only the French flag. This was not consistent with the trusteeship agreements which provided that in any such territory, only the administration was entrusted to the trustee State, in that case France and the UK. Also, he was confronted to turmoils, to a crisis of confidence due to difficulties in establishing a minimum of order in the department of Nyong-et-Kell√©, while France still perform the essential of the repression to the rise of the anti-imperialism. =The coup d'etat of Jean Ramadier= On 25 January, Jean Ramadier was in Paris, where he met with the Deputy Prime Minister, Minister of the Interior Ahmadou Ahidjo. Jean Ramadier became High Commissioner of the French Republic in Cameroon, he replaced Pierre Messmer. He arrived in Cameroon on 3 February 1958 without his family and only a small suitcase as a personal baggage. On 4 February, he informed Mbida that he had a solution to solve the problem of Cameroon : breaking the interest of the Union of the Peoples of Cameroon by applying its program without it. Mbida went indignant that French High Commissioner may have had such a thought. Ramadier decided acting and interfering in the internal politics of the autonomous State of Cameroon. On 10 February 1958, Jean Ramadier delivered a speech at the Legislative Assembly of Cameroon. In his speech, he stated that France is prepared to grant independence to Cameroon in the near future. The next day, on 11 February 1958, Mbida, who has previously refused the idea of somewhat of independence (i.e. a pupped independence), raised his voice during the Council of Ministers. Mbida informed Ramadier that the French High Commissioner has no right to interfere in the internal affairs of the autonomous State of Cameroon and to talk about the independence of Cameroon. Ramadier retorted by saying that the independence does not fall within the competencies of government of Cameroon but of the High Commissioner of the French Republic in Cameroon. This was the beginning of hostility to the top of the State. After leaving the Council of Ministers, Jean Ramadier conversed again with Ahmadou Ahidjo. On the evening of 11 February 1958, dramatic turn of events, the parliamentary group Cameroonian Union of Ahmadou Ahidjo dissociated from Mbida and resigns from the government coalition.La Presse du Cameroun no 2340, Thursday, 13 February 1958 To this end, he published a press release. As soon as the press release issued, the parliamentary group of Independent Peasants showed solidarity with the group of Cameroonian Union and also resigned from the Mdida's government coalition. The press in Cameroon has as a headline \\"the Bamil√©k√© (with the exception of Mathias Djoumessi) show solidarity with the North's elected members'‚Äô.La Presse du Cameroun no 2340, Thursday, 14 February 1958 Also on 11 February, Ramadier met Daniel Kemajou, president of ALCAM and asked him to provide his efforts to convince Mbida to resign or to push out Mbida.Abel Eyinga, Introduction a la politique camerounaise, p.141 Pursuant to his mandate and powers conferred upon him, strictly speaking in the texts of the State of Cameroon, Mbida formed a new government and Ramadier refused to ratify the government reshuffle. In accordance with Article 19 of the Status of Cameroon on 16 April 1957, it was not the responsibility of the high commissioner to appreciate, to evaluate, to express an opinion on the names of ministers selected by the Prime Minister or to refuse to ratify a government reshuffle. In addition, it may remove the Prime Minister from office. The ministers who have resigned refused to leave their ministry and let pass of the new ministers. Mbida ask to that Ramadier to take the appropriate actions. Ramadier informed him that Ahmadou Ahidjo, Djoya Arouna, Adama Haman and Ndjin√© Talba Malla asked him (via a letter signed by latters which he showed) not to yield to the injunctions of the Prime Minister.Enoh Meyomesse, La chute d'Andr√©-Marie Mbida Mbida decided to inform supervisors of the High Commissioner of the French Republic in Cameroon. He travelled by plane on the evening of 13 February and arrived Friday, 14 February in the morning. On 12 February 1958, at 06 PM, it is unanimously adopted the immediate recall of Ramadier by the Cabinet of French Prime Minister.La Presse du Cameroun no 2432 Mbida was informed of this good news as soon as he went out of his plane : the High Commissioner, Jean Ramadier, was summoned to Paris of extreme urgency, by G√©rard Jaquet, the Minister of Overseas France. Ramadier is expected Saturday, 15 February. Jean Ramadier, refused to go to Paris and he sent several telegrams stating that the French government asked him to accomplish a mission in Cameroon.Abwa, Daniel (1993), Andr√©-Marie Mbida, premier premier ministre camerounais (1917‚Äì1980): autopsie d'une carri√®re politique, p.86 He said that it is neither the day nor the time to retreat from this position by making him wearing the hat. He says that he is ready to complete his mission, to fulfill his mandate, at all costs. One can read in his telegrams: \\"As I have indicated, the operation was conducted very quickly because Mbida at the head of the government became impossible. The opposition to his person and more even to his methods grew stronger every day\\" ().Abwa, Daniel (1993), Andr√©- Marie Mbida, premier premier ministre camerounais (1917‚Äì1980): autopsie d'une carri√®re politique, p.86-87 \\"The situation became worse by the hour and the press releases and the untimely telegrams of Mbida have overexcited public opinion to such an extent that it was difficult to predict. (...) We got to the point where things must be said clearly, even sharply. I never asked coming to Cameroon, you have named me because others have not been approved. (...) Everyone must now take his responsibility, I took mine. I intend to assume all the consequences. (...)\\" ().Abwa, Daniel (1993), Andr√©-Marie Mbida, premier premier ministre camerounais (1917‚Äì1980): autopsie d'une carri√®re politique, p.87-88 Throughout the day of Friday, 14 February, Andr√©-Marie Mbida and Mathias Djoumessi who accompanied him, are received at the Ministry of Overseas France, at the Prime Ministry and then at the Presidency of the Republic of France by Ren√© Coty. The French press is boiling. Everywhere Mbida is said to be right. The French Right-wing and especially the Popular Republican Movement (), was all to his cause. Jean Ramadier exceeded its powers. Saturday, 15 February evening, Mbida resigned from the Socialist SFIO parliamentary group and came back to Yaound√©.Daniel Abwa Andr√©-Marie Mbida, premier premier ministre camerounais (1917‚Äì1980): autopsie d'une carri√®re politique, p.89 His resignation from SFIO parliamentary group took effect on 20 February 1958. While Mbida was in Paris, Jean Ramadier donated 200,000 CFA francs to any Cameroonian deputy who is ganging up on Mbida. He instigated a vote of no confidence against the Mbida's government and wrote the speech of Ahmadou Ahidjo.Daniel Abwa Andr√©-Marie Mbida, premier premier ministre camerounais (1917‚Äì1980): autopsie d'une carri√®re politique When Mbida returned to Cameroon, he addressed by telegram his resignation to the President of the French Republic, Ren√© Coty, at Prime Minister, F√©lix Gaillard and at Minister of Overseas France, G√©rard Jaquet. In his telegram, he wrote: \\"I decided not lend nor subject myself to these illegal manoeuvrings, and I present today my resignation at the High Commissioner as Prime Minister, Head of the Cameroonian government\\" ().La Presse du Cameroun no 2344, Tuesday, 28 February 1940 He succeeded in having Ramadier transferred to another post. He replaced by Ahmadou Ahidjo who became Cameroon's first pr√©sident on, 5 May 1960. Ahidjo who was at the beginning his friend, wanted to integrate Mbida in his first government but Mbida disagreed with Ahidjo's extremely pro-French politics and he refused and went into exile in Conakry. On 16 September 1958, when he was passing through Paris, Andr√©-Marie Mbida pronounced himself in favour of the immediate independence.La Presse du Cameroun no 2478, Tuesday, 13 September 1958 On 3 October 1958, his political party published a press release where it demanded \\"the immediate independence of Cameroon ‚Äì the total amnesty ‚Äì the lifting of French mandate'‚Äô. His party, the Cameroonian Party of Democrats, will demand even the independence for 1 January 1959.La Presse du Cameroun no 2535, Thursday, 9 October 1958 In Conakry, he drafted, jointly with F√©lix- Roland Moumi√© and Ernest Ouandi√©, a political minimum platform for Cameroon. Mbida came back to Cameroon in 1960 and he regained in a very short time period a national political audience that thirteen months of exile in Conakry (Guinea) had somewhat withered. On 10 April 1960, he was elected as deputy in his district. He obtained 23,770 votes against 0.Zang Atangana J-M, Les Forces politiques du Cameroun r√©unifi√©, tome I, Paris, l'Harmattan, 1989 Following these elections, the audience and even the popularity of Mbida were well established in Cameroon with a predominance in the region of Nyong and Sanaga. Nevertheless, the final battle that he would deliver against the Ahidjo's Government, the battle against the single-party state, the one-party system, would sound the knell of his political life. = The final battle against the single-party state = After he denounced the continued presence of French troops and French military bases in Cameroon while accusing the north of being dominated by the Lamibe in an obsolete feudalism, Ahidjo dismissed the Democrats from their ministerial duties. In the years 1961‚Äì1962, the wave of rallying, dissolutions and merging of other parties with the Cameroon Union of Ahidjo considerably weakened the Cameroonian Party of Democrats in the National Assembly in 1962. In January 1962, following the Ahidjo's soldiers' dispersal of the Union of the Peoples of Cameroon during its first conference since their rehabilitation, Andr√©-Marie Mbida and other opposition leaders, i.e., Marcel Bebey Eyidi (General Secretary of the Labor Party of Cameroon), Charles Okala (General Secretary of the Socialist Party of Cameroon) and Th√©odore Mayi Matip (deputy and Caucus Chair of The Union of the Peoples of Cameroon), founded a joint committee National United Front () with Mbida as leader. On 23 June 1962, FNU published a manifesto, signed by Mbida, Okala, Eyidi and Matip, in which they affirm their refusal to join the single-party state. The signatories add that a single-party state inevitably leads to dictatorship. Consequently, they were arrested and imprisoned in North Cameroun. This incarceration resulted in a significant deterioration of Mbida's physical appearance: he fell ill and became nearly blind. Following his release from prison in 1965, he was placed under house arrest. In 1966 he obtained permission to seek treatment in France at des Quinze-Vingts Hospital. On returning to Cameroon two years later, he was again placed under house arrest, in Yaound√©, from 3 August 1968 to 30 May 1972. Until his death Andr√©- Marie Mbida refused to subscribe to the idea of a single-state-party; the Cameroonian Party of Democrats refused to merge with the Cameroon National Union (CNU) (). Mbida nearly gave up politics. The last moments of his life were made especially difficult by loneliness. In his 63rd year he blindly removed to the realm of celestial rewards at the Piti√©-Salp√™tri√®re Hospital, where he had been admitted two short weeks earlier.

The eagle feather law provides many exceptions to federal wildlife laws regarding eagles and other migratory birds to enable Native Americans to continue their traditional spiritual and cultural practices. Under the current language of the eagle feather law, individuals of certifiable American Indian ancestry enrolled in a federally recognized tribe are legally authorized to obtain eagle feathers.

Retrieved: 17/05/18. Criteria of ownership The eagle feather law has incited ongoing debate about the criteria for ownership and possession of eagles and eagle parts. Debates have centered on the differences between enrollment in a federally recognized American Indian tribe, vs a racial, ethnic or self-identified concept of Indigeneity. Some arguments have centered on non-Natives being opposed to Natives having access to anything that all Americans cannot have. Defenders of the law have argued it is the only legal protection of American Indian spirituality and that because eagle supplies are limited, increasing the number of people who can have eagle parts may make feathers more scarce as well as endanger the lives of too many migratory birds (including threatened or endangered species). Arguments in favor of amending the law (notably by supporters of Religious Freedom with Raptors, an organization dedicated to changing the eagle feather law) have been made on the grounds that it imposes \\"racial preferences\\" for American Indians and that the requirement of tribal enrollment to possess eagles undermines tribal sovereignty rights to fully welcome and include non-Natives in tribal customs involving eagle feathers. It is also argued that eagle permit certification restrictions based on enrollment status impede people with Indian ancestry but who may be unable to prove their ancestry, from exploring their heritage.Stokes, DaShanne. 2007. \\"Time for New Eagle Feather Law.\\" Indian Country Today, February 21, pp. A2.Stokes, DaShanne. 2008. \\"Eagle Feathers and the Imperialist Conquest of State Recognized Tribes.\\" Indian Country Today, August 13, pp. 5. Religious Freedom with Raptors also advocate removing enrollment requirements from 50 CFR 22, stating that enrollment requirements are a racial bias, and that such action would enable all U.S. citizens to apply for eagles or parts from the National Eagle Repository (overseen by the United States Fish and Wildlife Service), it would extend the ability of government-regulated programs and agencies to protect raptors by decreasing the profitability of raptor poaching and trafficking.

Beecher Island, on the Arikaree River, then known as part of the North Fork of the Republican River, near present-day Wray, Colorado, was named afterwards for Lieutenant Fredrick H. Beecher, an army officer killed during the battle. Background In the summer and fall of 1868, continuing their annual seasonal raiding activities between the Arkansas and Platte Rivers in what was also the region of their best buffalo hunting, bands of Cheyenne and Arapaho Indians conducted raids against whites throughout the western Great Plains in Kansas. In addition, they found incentive in the warfare that had been waged specifically against their clans by the military in 1867 and by memories of such atrocities as the Sand Creek massacre. Finally, the westward movement of the transcontinental railroad had stretched all the way across Kansas, bringing with it many permanent white settlements. During the period 1867‚Äì1868, the Cheyennes were in schism, with those advocating peace (possibly a majority) retreating south out of Kansas and the younger, intractable warrior societies continuing to raid. The latter during the summer of 1867 had successfully avoided a large expedition commanded by Maj. Gen. Winfield S. Hancock and in the process had garnered sympathy from Americans in the East who supported peaceful negotiations after Hancock attempted to bully the Cheyennes to submit and burned their abandoned villages when they did not. In August 1868, General Philip Sheridan replaced Hancock in command of the Department of the Missouri and was asked by acting Governor Frank Hall of Colorado for assistance after 79 settlers were killed in repeated attacks on farms, ranches, way stations, and travel routes. Sheridan's main effort was to be made south of the Arkansas during a winter campaign in the Indian Territory, but he remained active in Kansas during the warmer weather, patrolling the Arkansas with the 7th Cavalry and the area between the Republican and Smoky Hill Rivers using the 10th Cavalry. =Unit formation= As the Indians fought dispersed battles composed of small bands of warriors all over the frontier, U.S. Army troops and units were at a premium. General Sheridan decided to try an unusual tactic. He ordered his aide, Major George Alexander Forsyth of the 9th Cavalry, a Civil War veteran, to raise a company of \\"fifty first-class hardy frontiersmen, to be used as scouts against the hostile Indians.\\" They were to seek out and engage the marauders using their tactics, rather than those of the traditional Army. Forsyth hand-picked 48 men at Forts Harker and Hays and armed them with Spencer repeating rifles. Forsyth's executive officer was Lieutenant Fredrick H. Beecher of the 3rd Infantry, a decorated veteran of the Battle of Gettysburg. His company rode northwest nearly to Nebraska, then turned southwest and reached Fort Wallace the night of 5 September without finding any trace of Indians. The engagement During the morning of 10 September, the troops at Fort Wallace received information that Indians had attacked a freighter's train east of Ft. Wallace, near the railhead (at that time) of the Kansas Pacific Railroad, which was the since-abandoned town of Sheridan in Logan County, Kansas. Brevet Colonel Forsyth and his group of scouts departed Fort Wallace with orders to counter the raid. Col. Forsyth took his command to investigate. They learned that a force of about 25 Indians had taken part in the attack. They followed their trail into what is now Yuma County, Colorado. =Indians spotted= The scouts trailed the Indian raiding party from Sheridan into Colorado; signs indicated that the opposing force considerably outnumbered the scouts, but the unit nonetheless pressed on. Around dusk on the 16th, Forsyth and his men arrived in the vicinity of the \\"Dry Fork of the Republican River\\" (reported at the time as \\"Delaware Creek\\"‚Äînow the Arikaree River) and made camp on the south bank. They camped only downstream from a large encampment of two Lakota villages, one of Cheyenne Dog Soldiers and a few lodges of Arapaho. =Indian surprise thwarted= At dawn on the 17th, Forsyth sensed trouble and spotted the silhouette of a feathered head against the skyline. He fired his weapon, instantly killing the Indian warrior. Simultaneously, other Indians, who, having moved nearer to where the scouts' horses were tied up, attempted to stampede them, but the scouts immediately responded to the sound of Forsyth's gunshot and only the pack mules were lost. Roman Nose, war leader of the Cheyenne, had planned a dawn raid to overrun the camp of 50 U.S. scouts, but the element of surprise was lost when a few eager warriors rushed the camp before the order to attack was given. Forsyth gave orders to saddle the horses. Seeing that no escape route was open, he directed his men to take cover on a sand bar in the middle of the Arikaree. The numbers of attacking Indians varies widely, with estimates including 200, 600 to 1,000. The initial assault by the Indians was cut down by the accurate, quick- firing Spencer rifles. The combined force of Oglala Sioux and Cheyenne Indians were surprised and changed their tactics. During the early morning of the first day of battle, small parties of Indians dashed up to the sand bar on horseback several times, but they did little damage to the scouts. The scouts killed their horses for breastworks and dug pits into the soft sand behind them. When the scouts opened fire, the Indians attacked the island on both sides. Later they crawled through the grass and shot through the grass. Several scouts who were killed or wounded were hit by the Indian snipers hidden in the grass. The Indians surrounded the island and repeatedly attacked the Scouts. Three scouts hidden in hole on the riverbank shot several Indians from the shore. Roman nose is shot (from an 1895 book) Roman Nose was shot on the riverbank at the west end of the sand bar. He jumped back into the grass where other warriors retrieved him. He died at 10 pm that night. Many other warriors fell, while four of the scouts including Beecher, Acting Surgeon J.H. Mooers, George W. Culver, and William Wilson were killed. Another 15 scouts were wounded, including Colonel Forsyth. Forsyth received a mild head wound and his leg was fractured by a gunshot wound. =Scouts sent for relief= Before dawn on the second day, Forsyth said, \\"Some one must go to Wallace for assistance.\\" Sharp Grover, who was chief of scouts, said \\"It is impossible to get out.\\" Then Stilwell came forward and said, \\"Let me choose the man to go with me and I will go.\\" Grover said, \\"Jack is too young and inexperienced, he can't get through.\\" Ft. Wallace was about to the south east. But Forsyth tore off the fly leaf out of his daybook, wrote a note to Col. Bankhead at Ft. Wallace, and gave it to Stilwell. Simpson \\"Jack\\" Stilwell chose Pierre Trudeau to come with him. They crawled for the first day before they took cover in the daylight. They were forced to evade Indians for four days during their journey. They had only horse meat for food and when it spoiled they got sick. Trudeau was so weak he could only stand with assistance, but after resting and traveling for four days they reached Fort Wallace. Two nights after Stilwell and Trudeau left, Scouts John J. Donovan and Allison J. Pliley left the island to seek relief. It was unknown if Scouts Stilwell and Trudeau had made it through the Indian lines. In the meantime, Forsyth and his men survived on muddy river water and rotting horse meat. Forsyth was wounded twice and others thought he would die of his wounds before they would be rescued.

The first was Lieutenant Colonel Louis H. Carpenter leading Troop H & I of the 10th Cavalry Regiment (Buffalo Soldiers) with Captain Baldwin. Major Brisbin in command of two troops of the 2nd Cavalry took another route. Captain Bankhead, went from Fort Wallace with about 100 men of the 5th Infantry, took a third route. Letter written in 1912 from Carpenter to Mr. George Martin of the Kansas State Historical Society. About daybreak on 25 September, Lt.Col. Carpenter's Troops H & I were intercepted on the plains by Scout John Donovan and four riders he had recruited after reaching Fort Wallace and starting back for the battlefield. They were the first to arrive and relieve Forsyth's unit. Carpenter later received the Medal of Honor for his relief of Forsyth's command and for his actions during the battle on Beaver Creek. Over fifty dead horses greeted them with their putrid smell. Forsyth's command had been out of rations and forced to survive on the decaying horse flesh. Forsyth's 2nd in command, Lt. Fredrick H. Beecher, had been killed during the battle. Forsyth had been shot in the thigh, fracturing his leg, and wounded in the forehead. He was not expected to survive another day. The air around him was completely filled with a great stench and was swarming with black flies feasting on the rotting defensive line of dead horses. The square sandy hole, where Forsyth was lying was half encircled by dead mounts and would have become his grave if help had not arrived when it did. Other gun pits, interconnected, contained the living and the dead of his unit. Carpenter immediately secured the area and pitched a number of tents up wind nearby. The wounded men were carefully carried there for more healthy air and the dead men were buried to reduce the stench and possibility of disease. Twenty-six hours later, Carpenter sent a detachment to look for Bankhead's unit. They found Stilwell and Trudeau several miles in advance of Bankhead. Captain Bankhead followed bringing with him the two troops of the 2nd Cavalry. The following day, a fifth scout died of his wounds and was buried on the battlefield with the other four scouts. Walter Armstrong died in a hospital later. Beecher, Culver, Farley, Wilson and Doctor Mooers were buried on the island. Sixteen others were wounded. On 27 September, the Forsyth Scouts departed for Fort Wallace, escorted by the 10th Cavalry. Aftermath The \\"Forsyth Scouts\\" arrived back at Fort Wallace on 30 September. General George Custer later proclaimed that the Arickaree fight was \\"‚Ä¶the greatest battle on the plains.\\" To the Cheyenne, the engagement would be remembered as \\"The Fight when Roman Nose was Killed.\\" In actuality, the fight was a minor engagement of no lasting import whose greater significance, as a model for tactics in successfully combating the Indians, was largely ignored. The location of the battle was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1976. The next spring Captain Brown returned to retrieve the bodies.

He is the first openly gay prince in the world. He runs a charity, the Lakshya Trust, which works with the LGBT community.  Biography  He was born in Ajmer, the only son of Maharana Shri Raghubir Singhji Rajendrasinghji Sahib, Maharana of Rajpipla, and his wife Maharani Rukmini Devi. He has one sister, Minaxi Kumari, who is married into the princely family of Chenani in Jammu and Kashmir. In 1971, the government of India \\"de-recognized\\" the Indian princes, and Manvendra's father consequently lost the official title of Maharaja and the privy purse (an annual pension) that came with it. The princes adjusted to the new socialist regime; the Rajpipla royals converted their family seat, the Rajvant Palace in Rajpipla, into a tourist resort and location for film- shooting. They also set up a second residence in Mumbai. He was educated at Bombay Scottish School and at the Amrutben Jivanlal College of Commerce and Economics (one of the institutions in the Mithibai College campus in Vile Parle, Mumbai. His parents arranged marriage, and in January 1991, he married Chandrika Kumari, a princess of Jhabua State in Madhya Pradesh. Manvendra says about his marriage: ::\\"I thought that after marriage everything will be all right, that with a wife, I will have children and become \\"normal\\" and then I will be at peace. I was struggling and striving to be \\"normal.\\" I never knew and nobody told me that I was gay and [that] this itself is normal and it will not change. That this is what is called homosexuality and it is not a disease. I tremendously regret for ruining (Chandrika's) life. I feel guilty, but I simply did not know better.\\"India's gay prince appears on Oprah show. Rediff.com (31 December 2004). Retrieved on 20 August 2012. The marriage remained unconsummated. He says, \\"It was a total disaster. A total failure. The marriage never got consummated. I realized I had done something very wrong. Now two people were suffering instead of one. Far from becoming normal, my life was more miserable.\\"Oprah Winfrey's Official Website ‚Äì Live Your Best Life. Oprah.com (24 October 2007). Retrieved on 20 August 2012. His wife filed for divorce after just over a year of marriage. Although further requests for marriage were received, he declined them. He suffered a nervous breakdown in 2002. He says: Upon being informed by the psychiatrists that their son was gay, Manvendra's parents accepted the truth, but stipulated that this matter should not be revealed to anyone else. He left Mumbai and began living full- time with his parents in the small town of Rajpipla. In 2005, Chirantana Bhatt, a young journalist from Vadodara Gujarat approached Manvendra. He confided his sexual orientation and the mental stress he was going through as a closeted gay man to the journalist. On 14 March 2006, the story of his coming out made headlines. The \\"coming out\\" story was first published in the Vadodara edition of Divya Bhaskar, a regional Gujarati language daily of the Bhaskar media group. It was covered the next day in all other editions of Bhaskar groups language newspapers like Dainik Bhaskar (Hindi language) and Daily News Analysis (DNA), an English newspaper. Soon the news appeared in other English and vernacular newspapers across the country, and became a story that they followed up in their gossip and society pages for several weeks afterward. Manvendra's effigies were burnt in Rajpipla, where people were shocked. Manavendra was jeered and heckled when he made a public appearance in the town. His family accused him of bringing dishonor and disowned him soon after.http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b00776vc He appeared as a guest on The Oprah Winfrey Show on 24 October 2007. He was one of three persons featured in the show entitled 'Gay Around the World'. He inaugurated the Euro Pride gay festival in Stockholm, Sweden, on 25 July 2008. He featured in a BBC Television series, Undercover Princes, screened on BBC Three in the UK in January 2009 which documented his search for a British boyfriend in Brighton.Gujarat gay prince seeks love through BBC series. Times of India (15 January 2009). Since July 2010, he has served as editor of the gay male- centric print magazine Fun, which is published in Rajpipla. In July 2013, Prince Manvendra married the American citizen DeAndre Richardson in Seattle, Washington. When DeAndre met his new family-in-law in India, Manvedra's father created him Duke of Hanumanteshwar. Charitable activities In 2000, he started the Lakshya Trust, of which he is chairman, a group dedicated to HIV/AIDS education and prevention. A registered public charitable trust, Lakshya is a community-based organisation working for HIV/AIDS prevention among men who have sex with men (MSMs). It provides counselling services, clinics for treatment of sexually transmitted infections, libraries, and condom-use promotion. The trust also trains female field workers who educate women married to MSM about safe sex practices.http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b00776vc BBC Radio 4, The Gay Prince of Rajpipla Lakshya won the Civil Society Award 2006 for its contribution in preventing HIV/AIDS among homosexual men.Gay prince to form sexual minorities forum, Rediff.com, 7 December 2006 The trust also creates employment opportunities for gay men and support for other organisations for MSMs, and plans to open a hospice/old age home for gay men. Lakshya is a member of the India Network For Sexual Minorities (INFOSEM) and a founding member of the Sexual Health Action Network (SHAN). In 2007, Manvendra joined the Interim Governing Board of the Asia Pacific Coalition on Male Sexual Health, known as APCOM, a regional coalition of MSM and HIV community-based organisations, the government sector, donors, technical experts and the UN system. He serves as India Community Representative on behalf of INFOSEM, the India MSM and HIV network. Manvendra said of this work, \\"APCOM is one of the best mediums to bring together different nationalities and develop linkages with others working for HIV and MSM/TG. In India, it will be an important tool to influence authorities to change thinking and broaden outlooks for the betterment of society. APCOM demonstrates the essence of unity and solidarity within diversity.\\"APCOM ‚Äì Home. Msmasia.org. Retrieved on 20 August 2012. In January 2008, while performing an annual ceremony in Rajpipla in honour of his great-grandfather Maharaja Vijaysinhji, Manvendra Gohil announced plans to adopt a child, saying: \\"I have carried out all my responsibilities as the prince so far and will continue as long as I can. I will also adopt a child soon so that all traditions continue\\". If the adoption proceeds, it will be the first known case of a single gay man adopting a child in India. In 2018 Manvendra opened up his 15-acre palace grounds to help house vulnerable LGBT people who might otherwise be \\"left with nothing\\" when \\"their families disown them after coming out\\". In popular culture In May 2009, it was announced that there are plans to turn Prince Manvendra's life story into a major motion picture. The script will be written by a member of the erstwhile Kapurthala royal family, Prince Amarjit Singh.

It is located at the intersection of Metropolitan Avenue and Rentar Plaza in Middle Village, Queens. The station is served by the M train at all times. History Turnstile bank The station originally opened on October 1, 1906, to serve the adjacent Lutheran cemetery. It was part of an extension of the line past Wyckoff Avenue along a former steam dummy surface line. A second station opened on August 9, 1915, west of the original facility, while the other former surface stations were elevated. On July 16, 1974, a fire completely destroyed the original wooden platform and station house along with R27 cars 8202, 8203, 8237 and R30 car 8512 along with some fire damage done to R32 cars 3549, 3659, 3694 and 3695, and the station had to be completely rebuilt. It reopened in 1980 with the current concrete platform and brick stationhouse. By railroad and service directions, the station is the southern terminal of both the Myrtle Avenue Line and full- length M train. It was the northern terminal of the M train by service direction before its reroute on June 27, 2010. Even though this is the M southern terminal by railroad direction, the service's late-night terminus, Myrtle Avenue, is geographically further south, but the weekend and weekday terminals at Essex Street and Forest Hills‚Äì71st Avenue, respectively, are geographically further north. Station layout The station, built on an embankment with the north end at street level, has two tracks and a concrete island platform with benches. The tracks end at bumper blocks at the north end of the platform. A steel canopy with fluorescent lights and supported by silver columns covers the entire platform. On the side of the westernmost track opposite from the platform is an employee-only facility. The control tower for the Myrtle Avenue Line is at the south end of the platform. Just to the south of the station lies the Fresh Pond Yard. It is only accessible from this station, so trains coming from Manhattan and Brooklyn must first enter the station, then reverse into the yard. =Exit= Station entrance The grade-level station house, the station's only entrance, is located at the eastern corner of Rentar Plaza and Metropolitan Avenue. It is made of bricks with glass windows. There are two pairs of doors leading to the platform, turnstile bank and token booth. Also, there are two pairs of doors out to the street corner and another door along Metropolitan Avenue. Because the station house is at ground level and the platform extends out of the station house, this station is fully ADA-accessible, but does not have an elevator or ramp. Points of interest The New York Connecting Railroad travels in an open- cut, directly east of and parallel to the station. To the station's east is Christ the King Regional High School. Directly to the west of the station is Metro Mall, a large shopping mall with relatively few stores. The station is located at Metropolitan Avenue's intersection with Rentar Plaza, which is the access road to the mall's parking lots. The Lutheran All Faiths Cemetery is located on the northern and eastern sides of the station.

Edme Samson's ceramics Pair of wine coolers, hard-paste porcelain, 19th century Samson began his career by making service and set piece replacements in the late 1830s. In 1845 he opened the ceramics firm Samson, Edm√© et Cie at 7, Rue Vend√¥me (later Rue B√©ranger) in Paris, with the intention of supplying reproductions of ceramics on display in museums and private collections. The factory was moved to Montreuil, Seine-Saint-Denis in 1864 by Samson‚Äôs son, Emile Samson (1837‚Äì1913). The firm either drew inspiration from other factories, or directly copied their pieces.Edm√© Samson: copyist or forger? Buenos Aires Herald 18th-century designs from the factories of Meissen, S√®vres, Chelsea, Worcester and Derby were among the reproductions Samson, Edm√© et Cie produced, among designs copied from the other major European factories. Kakiemon style covered Jar, c. 1850-1900, Samson & Cie, Paris or Montreuil, hard-paste porcelain with overglaze enamels During the 19th century, the collectors' market for antique fine china was considerable, and Samson‚Äôs firm reproduced ceramics in a breadth of styles including the faience and maiolica types of Italian pottery, Persian style dishes, Hispano-Moresque pottery (a blending of Islamic and European motifs, produced during the 13th to 15th centuries), plates in the FitzHugh pattern, as well as plates in the manner associated with Bernard Palissy. Also copied by the Samson firm were the early Qing dynasty famille rose and famille verte Chinese porcelains and the so-called \\"Imari wares\\", named for the Japanese port where a type of richly decorated porcelain made at Arita was shipped. The firm exhibited at the International Exposition (1867) and the Exposition Universelle (1889). Copyist or forger Samson, Edm√© et Cie did not set out to produce copies with the intention to deceive, and claimed all reproductions the firm produced would be distinctly marked to avoid confusion with the originals. However, many of its products have been passed off as originals. The Samson firm, in many instances, attempted to distinguish their reproductions from originals. The Samson wares were produced in hard-paste porcelain, while many of the originals would have been produced from soft-paste porcelain. The glazes utilized by the Samson firm were often glossy and somewhat glassy, the modeling stiffer, or wrong in scale, the decoration was often too heavy, and colors were often inaccurate. Leading many experts to conclude that Samson, and his firm, were merely enthusiastic, if sometimes clumsy, copyists. 1907 invoice from the Paris shop On the other hand, some Samson reproductions have only been detected by recognition of anachronistic details. Samson copies of Meissen pieces have passed for originals, since the blue underglaze ‚ÄòSs‚Äô, Edm√©‚Äôs mark, can be removed and substituted with false marks. Additionally, an 1880 reproduction piece by Samson, of a British East India Company armorial plate, shows evidence of scratchings, perhaps in an attempt to erase the Samson mark and pass the plate off as an original. Further complicating authenticity, numerous reproductions of Chelsea and Derby figures bear marks other than his trademark ‚ÄòSs‚Äô, and in some instances bear no mark at all. It is impossible to determine when, by whom, and for what reason the Samson marks might have been removed. However, during the same period, other companies, such as Jacob Petit of Fontainebleau, were producing reproductions similar to those created by the Samson firm. In Hungary the Herend company produced famille rose pieces and armorial plates. However, unlike the Samson firm‚Äôs marks, Herend utilized both impressed marks and painted ones, which cannot be erased or removed. Collector's items The Samson, Edm√© et Cie company continued to produce porcelain and pottery until 1969. The salesroom models were sold in 1979 by Christie's, London.Samson Porcelain: Original Factory Models from the Showroom of Etablissement Edme Samson, Christie's London. Today many of the Samson‚Äôs pieces are collectors‚Äô items. Ironically not all pieces attributed to Samson are actually Samson: there were many other Paris workshops producing similar 'copies' of earlier ceramics at the same time. Many Samson marks were removed from the piece, leaving just the assumed mark of the piece they had copied; often this is visible as a ground patch to the base. This was done in order to sell the item as the genuine article. Some pieces described as Samson were actually produced by Herend, Hungary.

November 23 is a holiday in honour of the Order of the Cross of Vytis. History Antanas Smetona wearing the interwar Cross of Vytis, alongside other awards The order was first established on 30 July 1919 as the Cross for the Homeland (Kry≈æius \\"U≈æ Tƒóvynƒô\\") when the newly established Lithuanian Army was engaged in the Lithuanian‚ÄìSoviet War. The initial design was based on the Polish Virtuti Militari with an addition of crossed swords, but no such crosses were actually produced. At the time of the Polish‚ÄìLithuanian War, the design was criticized for following Polish traditions. On 26 November 1919, the design was changed to the Cross of the Jagiellons, one of the varieties of the Cross of Lorraine found on the Coat of arms of Lithuania. On 3 February 1920, the name was changed to the Cross of Vytis. The order had two types: the first type had the crossed swords, and the second type was without the swords. Each type had three classes (the 1st class was the lowest, 3rd class was the highest). The Order of the Cross of Vytis was the first state decoration of the pre-war Lithuania reinstated after the restoration of independence. The award was established on 15 January 1991. The first to receive the order were the victims of the Soviet attack on the Vilnius TV Tower and on the border post in Medininkai. Other recipients included leaders of the Supreme Committee for the Liberation of Lithuania, representatives of the world Lithuanian community, officers of the Lithuanian Armed Forces for contributing to the withdrawal of the Red Army from Lithuania, and Lithuanian policemen and prosecutors for distinction in combating organised crime. According to the Law on State Awards, adopted in 2002, the Order of the Cross of Vytis is conferred for heroic defence of Lithuania's freedom and independence, including armed and unarmed resistance to the 1940‚Äì90 occupations and service during the independence movement in 1988‚Äì90, and other acts of valor and bravery.

The water flows in from the lower section of the image and passes on both sides of the large island in the center. River bifurcation (from , fork) occurs when a river flowing in a single stream separates into two or more separate streams (called distributaries) which continue downstream. Some rivers form complex networks of distributaries, especially in their deltas. If the streams eventually merge again or empty into the same body of water, then the bifurcation forms a river island. River bifurcation may be temporary or semi-permanent, depending on the strength of the material which separates the distributaries. For example, a mid-stream island of soil or silt in a delta is most likely temporary. A location where a river divides around a rock fin, e.g. a volcanically formed dike, or a mountain, may be more lasting. A bifurcation may also be man-made, for example when two streams are separated by a long bridge pier.  Examples  *The Casiquiare canal splits off from the Orinoco (an east-flowing river in northern Venezuela that empties into the Caribbean Sea) and heads south to join the Rio Negro, an enormous south-flowing river that eventually joins the Amazon River. The canal therefore provides a navigable channel between the large Orinoco basin and the enormous Amazon basin. *Canada's aptly-named Divide Creek splits into two branches near Kicking Horse Pass on the Alberta‚ÄìBritish Columbia border at the North American continental divide. One branch flows west to the Pacific Ocean; the other flows east and eventually reaches the Atlantic Ocean via Hudson Bay. * Similarly, at Two Ocean Pass in Wyoming, United States, further south along that very same continental divide, North Two Ocean Creek splits at the Parting of the Waters. One creek is called the Atlantic Creek, which flows east to the Gulf of Mexico via the Yellowstone, Missouri and Mississippi Rivers; the other is called Pacific Creek, which flows west to the Pacific Ocean via the Snake and Columbia Rivers. *The Hase River in Melle, Germany divides into Hase river and Else river and has been researched as a natural phenomenon. *A bifurcation of the Nerodimka River (Albanian Nerodimja) in the city of Republic of Kosova/Ferizaj, Kosovo, (at ) was a hydrological curiosity as separate streams flowed into the Aegean and the Black Sea. The Nerodimka bifurcation was the first hydrological protected object in the former Yugoslavia (1979). The Nerodimka bifurcation is a strict wildlife sanctuary, category I according to IUCN, with an area of 13.0 ha (about 32 acres). This bifurcation is considered to be an artificial phenomenon, but created under extremely favorable natural conditions. *In the past, the small Kalaus River in south-western Russia, when reaching the thalweg of the Kuma-Manych Depression at , would split, the two distributaries becoming the headwaters of the West and East Manych Rivers. The former flows west into the Don River and eventually into the Sea of Azov, while the latter flows east, and is lost in the steppe before ever reaching the Caspian Sea. However a dam was built, preventing water from flowing from the Kalaus into the East Manych; thus the Kalaus is now the source of the West Manych only.Alexander Anatolievich Bazelyuk (–ë–∞–∑–µ–ª—é–∫ –ê–ª–µ–∫—Å–∞–Ω–¥—Ä –ê–Ω–∞—Ç–æ–ª—å–µ–≤–∏—á), \\"–ê–ù–¢–†–û–ü–û–ì–ï–ù–ù–û–ï –ò–ó–ú–ï–ù–ï–ù–ò–ï –ì–ò–î–†–û–ì–†–ê–§–ò–ß–ï–°–ö–û–ô –°–ï–¢–ò –ö–£–ú–û-–ú–ê–ù–´–ß–°–ö–û–ô –í–ü–ê–î–ò–ù–´ \\" (Anthropogenic changes in the Hydrographic Network of the Kuma-Manych Depression), summary of the Cand.

Around 230BC, the channel of the Nile from which it came (itself a bifurcation) dried up, but has since been fed by a new canal to allow water again to make it from the Nile to Al Fayyum.

Located on the right bank of the Ravi River, it is said to have been founded by the first guru of Sikhism, Guru Nanak, where he established the first Sikh commune.  Geography  Kartarpur is located at . It is located in Narowal, Punjab, Pakistan. It has an average elevation of 155 metres (511 feet).  History  The first guru of Sikhism, Guru Nanak, founded Kartarpur in 1504 AD on the right bank of the Ravi River. The name Kartarpur means \\"city of Creator or God\\", from Punjabi \\"‡®ï‡®∞‡®§‡®æ‡®∞\\" (Kartar) meaning 'Creator' or 'Lord of Creation' and \\"‡®™‡©Å‡®∞\\" (Pur) meaning 'City'. Here all people, irrespective of their religion or caste, lived together, representing the first 'Sikh commune'. After his travels for about 20 years, Guru Nanak settled in Kartarpur along with his family. Following his death in 1539, Hindus and Muslims both claimed him as their own, and raised mausoleums in his memory with a common wall between them. The changing course of the Ravi River eventually washed away the mausoleums. But Guru Nanak's son saved the urn containing his ashes and reburied it on the left bank of the river, where a new habitation was formed, representing the present day Dera Baba Nanak. At the location Guru Nanak is believed to have died, the Gurdwara Kartarpur Sahib was built. It is considered to be the second holiest site for the Sikh religion. During the 1947 partition of India, the region got divided across India and Pakistan. The Radcliffe Line awarded the Shakargarh tehsil on the right bank of the Ravi river, including Kartarpur, to Pakistan, and the Gurdaspur tehsil on the left bank of Ravi to India. Kartarpur Corridor On 9 November 2019, Prime Minister Imran Khan inaugurated the opening of a cross-border Kartarpur Corridor allowing Indian Sikhs to visit Pakistan without a visa. On same day, the first Jatha (batch) of over 500 Indian pilgrims visited the shrine thanking Prime Minister Khan for \\"respecting the sentiments of India\\" towards the shrine across the border that marks the final resting place of Sikhism founder Guru Nanak Dev. Under the leadership of Akal Takht Jathedar Giani Harpreet Singh, the first Jatha traveled through the corridor into Pakistan to pay obeisance at Gurdwara Darbar Sahib Kartarpur which included former Indian Prime Minister Manmohan Singh. The delegation also included ex-PM's wife, Gursharan Kaur, Chief Minister of Punjab, Captain Amarinder Singh, Navjot Singh Sidhu, Sunny Deol, and 150 Indian parliamentarians. Demography The population is primarily Punjabi, speaking Punjabi and Urdu. English is spoken by some as a second language. The ethnic groups include majority Gurjars, Rajputs and Jats. The population is predominantly Muslim Gujjar. There are several masjids in the town. After the partition of India in 1947, the minority Hindus and Sikhs migrated to India while many Muslim refugees from India settled down in Kartarpur.

Early life Stephen was born at St Christopher in the West Indies. His father, John Stephen (1771‚Äì1833), was related to James Stephen, became a barrister, and was Solicitor-General at St Christopher before his appointment as Solicitor-General of New South Wales in January 1824. He arrived at Sydney on 7 August 1824 and in September 1825 was made an acting judge of the Supreme Court. On 13 March 1826, his appointment as judge was confirmed. He resigned his position at the end of 1832 on account of ill-health and died on 21 December 1833. Alfred Stephen was educated at Charterhouse School and Honiton grammar school in Devon. He returned to St Christopher for some years and then went to London to study law. In November 1823 he was called to the bar at Lincoln's Inn, and the following year sailed for Van Diemen's Land (Tasmania). Van Diemen's Land Stephen arrived at Hobart on 24 January 1825 and on 9 May was made Solicitor-General, and 10 days later, crown solicitor. He allied himself with Governor Arthur who had clashed with Joseph Tice Gellibrand, the Attorney-General. Stephen's resignation of his position in August 1825, and his charges against his brother officer's professional and public conduct brought the matter to a head. Stephen always took an extremely high-minded attitude about his own conduct in this matter.The incident is discussed at length in R. W. Giblin's Early History of Tasmania, vol. II, p. 467, et seq. In 1829 Stephen discovered a fatal error in land titles throughout the Australian colonies. The matter was rectified by royal warrant and the issuing of fresh titles in 1830. In January 1833 Stephen was gazetted attorney-general and showed great industry and ability in the position. He was forced to resign in 1837, his health having suffered much from overwork, but after a holiday he took up private practice with great success. New South Wales On 30 April 1839, he was appointed as acting- judge of the Supreme Court of New South Wales and he arrived in Sydney on 7 May. In 1841, when judge Willis went to Port Phillip, Stephen became a puisne judge and from 1839 to 1844 he was also a judge of the administrative court. He published in 1843 his Introduction to the Practice of the Supreme Court of New South Wales, and on 7 October 1844, he was appointed acting chief justice. His appointment as chief justice was confirmed in a dispatch from Lord Stanley dated 30 April 1845. He was to hold the position until 1873 and during that period not only carried out his judicial duties but advised the government on many complicated questions which arose in the legislature. In August 1852 he recommended that the second chamber under the new constitution should be partly nominated and partly elected. In May 1856 he was appointed President of the Legislative Council and held the position until January 1857. He was able to give the council the benefit of his experience by framing legislation dealing with land titles, the legal profession, and the administration of justice. He continued to hold his seat until November 1858 when judges were precluded from sitting in parliament. In February 1860 he obtained 12 months leave of absence and visited Europe. On his return, he gave much consideration to the question of criminal law and was principally responsible for a criminal law amendment bill which although first brought before parliament in 1872, did not actually become law until 1883. He resigned his chief justiceship in 1873. He had administered the government between the departure of the Earl of Belmore in February 1872 and the arrival of Sir Hercules Robinson in June. He was appointed lieutenant-governor in 1875 and several times administered the government. He was a member of the legislative council from 1875 until 1890, taking an active part in the debates, and from 1880 he was president of the trustees of the national gallery. In 1883, with A. Oliver, he published Criminal Law Manual, comprising the Criminal Law Amendment Act of 1883, and towards the end of his life interested himself in the amending of the law of divorce. Among his writings on the subject was an article in the Contemporary Review for June 1891 in reply to one by W. E. Gladstone in the North American Review. Stephen resigned from the legislative council in 1890 and lived in retirement. He was still comparatively vigorous when he passed his ninetieth birthday in August 1892 and never completely took to his bed. He faded quietly out of life on 15 October 1894, his intellect bright and clear to the last. Family The Stephen family is a prominent legal dynasty in Australia. Sir Alfred was the son of John Stephen, a judge of the Supreme Court of New South Wales. Stephen married Virginia, daughter of Matthew Consett, who died in 1837, and Eleanor daughter of the Rev. William Bedford, who died in 1886. There were nine children of each marriage and at the time of Stephen's death, he had 66 grandchildren. He was knighted in 1846 and was a made a CB in 1862, in 1874, GCMG in 1884, and privy councillor in 1893. Of Stephen's sons, Alfred Hewlett Stephen, born in 1826, entered the Church and in 1869 became a canon of St Andrew's Cathedral, Sydney. Another, Sir Matthew Henry Stephen (1828‚Äì1920), became a puisne judge of the supreme court of New South Wales in 1887, and a third son, Hon. Septimus Alfred Stephen (1842-1901) was a distinguished lawyer and New South Wales politician. Other sons held prominent positions in Sydney. Of his grandsons, Edward Milner Stephen was appointed a supreme court judge at Sydney in 1929 and Brigadier-general Robert Campbell Stephen, served with distinction in the 1914-18 war. A great-grandson, Lieutenant Adrian Consett Stephen, killed in the same war, showed much promise as a writer. His Four Plays and An Australian in the R.F.A. were published posthumously in 1918. Alfred's brother, George Milner Stephen (1812 - 1894), was a barrister with a significant political career in South Australia and Victoria. Another brother, John Stephen, (died 1854) was the earliest created alderman for the City of Melbourne.

PA 402 was designated in 1928 between US 611 north of Delaware Water Gap and US 6 in Palmyra Township. The route at the southern terminus became PA 612 in the 1930s before PA 402 was extended south to US 611 (now PA 611 in Delaware Water Gap in the 1940s, replacing a portion of PA 612\\\\. PA 402 was realigned to end at an interchange with Interstate 80 (I-80) and US 611 in Delaware Water Gap by 1961. The southern terminus was cut back to US 209 in Marshalls Creek in the summer of 1962, with most of the former route south of there becoming a realigned US 209\\\\. In 1991, a proposal to realign PA 402 and US 209 around the village of Marshalls Creek was proposed. Originally, PA 402 ended at a junction with US 209 and US 209 Business in Marshalls Creek. Over the years, the junction and the village had become heavily congested and a bypass was the only way to relieve traffic. After numerous delays for environmental issues, PA 402's new alignment had construction begin in 2005. Construction was suspended in 2008 and abandoned as PennDOT wanted a new bypass constructed without a realignment of PA 402\\\\. The new bypass was completed in June 2012, when US 209 was realigned away from the southern terminus of PA 402, which ended at US 209 Bus. instead.  Route description  PA 402 begins at a junction with US 209 Bus. (Milford Road or SR 2012) in the village of Marshalls Creek in Smithfield Township. PA 402 proceeds north along Resica Falls Road, leaving the village of Marshalls Creek after crossing the namesake tributary. Soon crossing into Middle Smithfield Township, PA 402 bends northeast, crossing south of White Heron Lake and through the lakeside residential area. At Oak Grove Drive, PA 402 bends northward again, passing a small pond and bypassing Pocono Highlands Lake after turning northeast at Coolbaugh Drive. PA 402 at the junction with US 6 in Palmyra Township PA 402 soon reaches the village of Poplar Bridge, reaching the Middle Smithfield Township Park at the north end of the village. Passing the Country Club of the Poconos, the route turns northward through a residential area surrounded by woods. This soon recedes to just woods, soon crossing over the Bush Kill, right next to Resica Falls, which drop less than a from the roadway. North of the Bush Kill, the route passes Timber Mountain Drive and soon returns to the dense woods before crossing the county line from Monroe County to Pike County. Now in Porter Township, crossing through the dense woods until passing Twelvemile Pond. The route winds northward through woods in Porter Township for several miles, passing a small parking lot and a junction with Old Bushkill Road. After a bend to the northwest, PA 402 reaches Porters Lake, a large lake marking the center of Porter Township. The route then moves northwest and crosses Pickerel Lake. PA 402 continues northwest through more woodlands, soon reaching the village of Pecks Pond, a residential community on the southwest end of the namesake pond. At the junction with Ness Road, PA 402 turns northeast along the lakeshore, soon passing a junction with a former alignment of itself. The route crosses into Blooming Grove Township, continuing northwest through the rural portions of Pike County. The route soon bends north, passing through woods east of Lake Scott, soon reaching an interchange with I-84 (exit 30; formerly 8). Just north of the interchange, PA 402 intersects with SR 4004, which connects to PA 434 and PA 739 at its eastern terminus. The route winds northward through Blooming Grove Township, passing White Deer Lake Access, soon bending northwest again. The route bends northward, crossing into Palmyra Township, soon reaching a clearing and a junction with US 6\\\\. This junction serves as the northern terminus of PA 402, just east of the junction with PA 507.  History  PA 402 was assigned by the Pennsylvania Department of Highways in the 1928 renumbering of state highways in the commonwealth of Pennsylvania. The route at the time of designation, was assigned from US 611 at the Brodhead Creek north of Delaware Water Gap to US 6 in Palmyra Township, just outside the village of Friendly Acres, crossing US 209 in the village of Marshalls Creek. At this time, the entire length of the route was unpaved. However, the route, not up to state standards, was completely under construction to meet said standards, with the portion between Marshalls Creek and Snowhill Road at Twelvemile Pond being completed in 1931. The following year, 1932, the portion between Twelvemile Pond and US 6 was completed. The section between Delaware Water Gap and Marshalls Creek was completed in the 1930s. By this time, the southern terminus was at PA 612 after that route swapped alignments with US 611. PA 402 was extended south along Paper Mill Road to end at US 611 (now PA 611) in Delaware Water Gap in the 1940s after the PA 612 designation was decommissioned. By 1961, PA 402 was realigned to use River Road between an interchange with I-80 and US 611 in Delaware Water Gap and north of the Brodhead Creek. On June 1, 1962, the southern terminus of PA 402 was cut back to US 209 in Marshalls Creek, with the section between Minisink Hills and Marshalls Creek becoming a realigned US 209 while the former alignment south of there is now unnumbered River Road and Gap View Drive. = Marshalls Creek Bypass = The southern terminus of PA 402 as seen in January 2013. US 209 signage has not been replaced by US 209 Bus. signage A bypass of the southern terminus of PA 402 was proposed in 1991 to deter traffic off the congested intersection with US 209 and US 209 Bus. in the village of Marshalls Creek. The same year, the Pennsylvania Department of Transportation (PennDOT) got involved in the feasibility study, and preliminary engineering work was finished in 1995. The project, notorious for delays, first hit a barrier in 1997, when a pair of species of endangered fish (Bridle shiners and Iron- colored shiners) were found in Marshalls Creek. In 2000, after a Final Environmental Impact Statement had been completed, the route was approved by the Federal Highway Administration. In 2004, a delay was created again, when pyrite was found in the area, which led to engineers finding a way to not harm the fish in Marshalls Creek. By that point, the project had been delayed to opening in 2008, 17 years after the proposal had been developed. Construction began on the new bypass of Marshalls Creek in 2005, with Phase I of the project, which wrapped up in 2007 under the eye of J.D. Eckman Inc., an Atglen-based contractor. The original bypass plan had PA 402 being realigned at the junction with Oak Grove Drive, onto a new alignment that would have crossed over the Marshalls Creek and terminated at an interchange with US 209 at the northern end of the bypass. In 2008, officials at PennDOT thought about a smaller bypass proposal, which would connect US 209 and US 209 Bus. and not cross Pond Creek. The abandoned alignment of PA 402 in Middle Smithfield Township At the same time, work was suspended in April for rising costs of the new bypass. Instead of costing $68 million (2008 USD), the cost of the new bypass had inflated to $200 million and the future of the project came into question. This upset local residents, who sold their land for the construction of the bypass, which was partially constructed for PA 402\\\\. Locals, some of whom who had been in the area for decades, started comparing the bypass shutdown as another version of the Tocks Island Dam project from 1956-1992, which led to numerous demonstrations to protect the Delaware River. At this point, PennDOT had to scale down the project and had no intent of the new PA 402 alignment to an interchange being finished, after grading and paving for the new alignment had already been started on the new alignment. The Marshalls Creek Bypass was redesigned as a new project with a new park and ride at the Pocono Bazaar to the northeast of Marshalls Creek with an extended Oak Grove Drive, which would run around the back of the Bazaar and come to a new intersection with US 209 and a new bypass of the village of Marshalls Creek of US 209 only. Construction on the park and ride began in 2009, marking the beginning of the third and final phase of the project. Construction on the US 209 bypass was slated for Spring 2010, with a 2.5 year span of completion at the cost of $20 million (2009 USD). The bypass opened on June 11, 2012, and PA 402's southern terminus became US 209 Bus. as US 209 was rerouted onto the new bypass.

Max Arthur Macauliffe, 1909 Bhai Bala's existence There has been considerable discussion as regards to Bhai Bala's existence, particularly within the Sikh academic field. The reasons for this are: Bhai Gurdas, who has listed all Guru Nanak's prominent disciples (in his 11th Var), does not mention the name of Bhai Bala (this may be an oversight, for he does not mention Rai Bular either). However Bhai Mani Singh's Bhagat Ratanwali, which contains essentially the same list as that by Bhai Gurdas, but with more detail, also does not mention Bhai Bala. There are a number of other anomalies, which Dr. Kirpal Singh has explicated in his Punjabi work 'Janamsakhi Tradition.'Singh, Dr Kirpal, Janamsakhi Tradition (An Analytical Study). Singh Brothers, 2004.(page 10) Professor Surjit Hans also notes that the only role of Bhai Bala was to denigrate the name of Nanak and that Guru Nanak prophesizes about a greater bhagat (Hundal) to come. Also in the Bhai Bala Janamsakhi are several language inconsistencies. For example, the Sikh salutation 'Waheguru Ji Ki Fateh' is used in the Bala Janamsakhi, however this term only gained currency during the reign of Guru Gobind Singh.

Guru Nanak approached the family and had seen that Mardana's mother was crying because she felt her son will die. Mardana's mother told Guru Ji that the reason she was crying is because all her children were dying. Following this, Guru ji asked what her son's name was, to which she responded \\"MarJana\\" meaning \\"He will die\\". Guru Nanak kindly asked the mother if she is willing to give him her son so that she will not have to bear the burden of her child's death.

It further states that Mardana sang hymns written by Kabir, Trilochan, Ravidas, Dhanna and Beni. According to Ratan Singh Bhangu, Prachin Panth Prakash, Guru Nanak as a small boy gave Mardana a string instrument improvised from reeds to play on while he sang the hymns. When Guru Nanak took charge of the granaries and stores of the Nawab of Sultanpur Lodhi, he became known for his generosity. Mardana, was by then married and had two sons and a daughter, Mardana went to meet Guru Nanak as Guru Nanak's father wanted news of his son, Mardana never went back from his trip and was with Guru Nanak from then on. He used to play the Rabab (r-aa-bab ) or rebeck as Guru Nanak spoke/sang his words about God. When Guru Nanak planned to travel the world to spread his message, he wanted Mardana to accompany him, Mardana wanted to marry off his daughter before doing so, Bhai Baghirath a disciple of Guru Nanak helped Mardana materially to enable the daughter's marriage and allow Mardana to accompany Guru Nanak. The chronicles of their travels use Mardana to show worldly doubts and bring forth Guru Nanak Ji's message, in many situations Mardana is portrayed as doubtful and wanting clarifications in every situation. The Puratan Janam Sakhi tells of these situations. In 1534, Mardana fell ill at Baghdad, where Nanak buried him near today's Baghdad Railway Station. A plaque at the grave states that he was buried by Baba Nanak Ji. Salok Mardana also wrote poetry. One of his compositions appears in the Guru Granth Sahib in Bihagadre ki VarShalok, Mardaanaa along with two others of Guru Nanak's addressed to Mardana. As per the composition Mardana is convinced that an evil body may be cleansed of sin in sangat (SGGS, 553).

He was the father of Spanish/Swiss novelist Cecilia B√∂hl de Faber, aka \\"Fern√°n Caballero\\". B√∂hl started his life in Spain at a shop owned by his bourgeois parents. In addition to the work of the store, he was also Hanseatic consul for his hometown Hamburg as well as overseeing the warehouses held by Sir James Duff and his nephew William Gordon at Puerto de Santa Mar√≠a. It was in C√°diz that he met Frasquita Larrea (Francisca Javiera Ruiz de Larrea y Aher√°n, 1775‚Äì1838) a Catholic lady of high society who had travelled through France and Germany and mastered their languages easily, read Shakespeare, was well-versed in the thoughts of Kant and Descartes, read Madame Sta√´l, and delighted in the work of the feminist Mary Wollstonecraft. The two were married in 1790 and lived for a short time on Lake Geneva, in the Canton of Vaud, where their daughter was born, the future novelist known as Fern√°n Caballero. Later, the couple would have two more children. Returning to Spain, they spent time living in C√°diz where they enriched the local cultural scene by introducing the first tertulias. In 1805, the pair journeyed to Germany for a second time where their union began to show the first signs of stress. Frasquita returned to Spain alone, where she would experience the Peninsular War with her two daughters while living in Chiclana de la Frontera. The family reunited after the end of the war in C√°diz. B√∂hl de Faber's hispanophilia prompted him to collect many works of Spanish literature and build an important library. While travelling in Germany he obtained many of the Aesthetic works of the brothers August Wilhelm Schlegel and Friedrich Schlegel concerning art, literature, and above all Pedro Calder√≥n de la Barca. In 1814, he published an article entitled \\"Reflexiones de Schlegel sobre el teatro traducidas del alem√°n\\" (Schlegel's Reflections upon Theatre as Translated from German) in the newspaper El Mercurio Gaditano. This article identifies Romanticism with absolutism and argues for a return to traditional and Catholic thought. It totally condemns the Enlightenment and exalts Spanish nationalism. The theater of Calder√≥n de la Barca is treated as a symbol of the Spanish spirit, and any dislike of it is deemed unpatriotic. The contemporary Neo-classical Enlightenment writer Jos√© Joaqu√≠n de Mora countered that the worst thing to befall Spanish culture was the work of Calder√≥n, in which bad taste was the norm. This exchange ignited a row between the two that would appear in newspapers in Madrid. Between 1818 and 1819, B√∂hl de Faber published in the Diario Mercantil Gaditano a series of articles defending Spanish theater of the Siglo de Oro, a genre much maligned by the Spanish Neo-Classicists who rejected its style along with the reactionary and traditionalist ideology it represented. Mora and Antonio Alcal√° Galiano, liberal authors who would later become fervent Romantics, argued bitterly against him. Mora's words especially focused on the way that Faber's own wife was a vocal admirer of Calder√≥n, and that she ran an ultra-Catholic tertulia in C√°diz. Additionally, whereas Faber was a supporter of Fernando VII, Mora and Alcal√° Galiano were liberals; the ideological divide provoked still more disputes and the controversy became rife with personal attacks. Nevertheless, B√∂hl remained an active publicist whose labor did much to bring traditionalist Romanticism to Spain. He published articles about English poetry derived from Romanticism. With the end of the Trienio Liberal of the 1820s, Mora and Alcal√° Galiano left Spain with other liberal emigrants, though in order to better counter B√∂hl de Faber they had to study Schlegel's theories concerning the Romancero and the theater of the Siglo de Oro, and in this way Romanticism was introduced into Spain. Faber actually became one of its progenitors in the country. Faber associated Christianity with Romanticism and maintained that the movement had already occurred in medieval Spain and that Neo-Classicism constituted an interruption to the true indigenous Spanish cultural tradition. He would also eventually publish essays about Lope de Vega as well as Calder√≥n de la Barca and a collection of romances and popular poetry.

It was named after the Atakapa Native American tribe that once inhabited territory which is now southwestern Louisiana and southeastern Texas. Construction history The fleet ocean tug (ATF-149) was laid down on 17 February 1944 at Charleston, South Carolina, by the Charleston Shipbuilding & Drydock Company; launched on 11 July 1944; sponsored by Mrs. B.H. Wiggs; and commissioned at the Charleston Navy Yard on 8 December 1944. Operational history =World War II service= After shakedown in the Norfolk, Virginia area, Atakapa undertook her first assignment, a tow from the East Coast to California, departing Philadelphia on 22 January 1945 and reaching San Francisco on 8 March. From that day through 27 April, she engaged in routine towing operations along the West Coast. The ship sailed for Hawaii on the 27th and, upon her arrival at Pearl Harbor on 10 May, resumed her towing operations. This duty was interrupted by a long tow from Pearl Harbor to Eniwetok, which began on 20 June. After reaching Eniwetok on 10 July, Atakapa left three days later bound for Johnston Island where she took two craft in tow and proceeded back to Pearl Harbor which she reached on 26 July. Atakapa engaged in towing and salvage operations until 11 August when she departed the Hawaiian Islands bound for the Aleutians. The tug reached Adak on 22 August, a week after Japan capitulated. The units gathered there formed Task Force (TF) 42 and sailed on 1 September for Ominato, Japan. They reached Japan on 13 September, and Atakapa served in Japanese waters into April 1946. The tug returned to Pearl Harbor on 23 April for repairs before heading for the United States late in May. She transited the Panama Canal on 14 June and reached Jacksonville, Florida, on the 25th. The ship reported to Orange, Texas, on 21 August for duty and ultimate transfer to the inactive fleet. She was placed out of commission, in reserve, on 8 November 1946. =Post-war service= Atakapa was recommissioned at Orange on 9 August 1951, slightly over a year after Communist forces invaded South Korea. She held shakedown training at Newport, Rhode Island, and Norfolk, Virginia, and made the first major tow of her new career in February 1952, when she pulled a large vessel from Panama to Philadelphia. From April to July, Atakapa was stationed at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, and devoted herself largely to target towing. The vessel returned to Norfolk in July and spent the remainder of the year providing general towing and salvage services in the Norfolk area and along the East Coast. For the next five and one-half years, Atakapa maintained a busy schedule of towing and salvage operations. She visited ports along the East Coast, in the Caribbean, and along the Gulf Coast. On 23 July 1958, the tug began her first Mediterranean deployment in response to internal disorder in Lebanon. While operating with the 6th Fleet, she provided towing and salvage services and made port calls at Suda Bay, Crete; Beirut, Lebanon; Athens and Rhodes, Greece; and Catania, Sicily. Before returning to the United States, Atakapa towed a ship through the Suez Canal from Massawa, Ethiopia, to Naples, Italy. The tug spent 1959 and 1960 providing general services to East Coast ships. In early 1961, she spent six weeks in Puerto Rico participating in Operation \\"Springboard\\" and then crossed the Atlantic in May and June with a tow from Mayport, Florida, to Holy Loch, Scotland. Atakapa began 1962 in upkeep at Little Creek, Virginia, but soon sailed for the Caribbean to take part in Operation \\"Springboard 62.\\" She provided towing and target retrieval service for units serving at Guantanamo Bay. Atakapa returned to Norfolk in June for a tender availability. Upon its completion, she provided services for submarines operating out of Norfolk. In October, the tug reported for duty in the Caribbean in response to the Cuban Missile Crisis but returned home when tension subsided and ended the year at Little Creek. On 4 January 1963, Atakapa sailed to San Juan, Puerto Rico, to take part in Operation \\"Springboard\\" for the third straight year, but was back in Little Creek on 7 February for a short availability. During March and April, she received an overhaul. After two months of refresher training, she put to sea in early October, bound for Guantanamo Bay. The tug returned to Little Creek in late November and finished the year in upkeep. For the first few months of 1964, Atakapa operated in the Norfolk area. In June, she proceeded to Rota, Spain, with in tow. After releasing the medium auxiliary repair dry dock, she remained deployed with the 6th Fleet for four months. The tug got underway in October to return to the United States, but was diverted en route to escort an LST to Bermuda and thence to Norfolk. They arrived in Hampton Roads on 17 November, and Atakapa spent the rest of the year undergoing a tender availability. Atakapa brings into Rota, Spain, 26 June 1964. After a brief period of local operations, Atakapa sailed in early 1965 to the Caribbean to participate in Operation \\"Springboard.\\" Early in April, she returned to the Norfolk area for an overhaul at the Norfolk Shipbuilding & Drydock Company. Upon completing the yard period, the tug resumed operations in the Virginia Capes area. Late in the year, she operated briefly at Guantanamo Bay and, after visiting Ocho Rios, Jamaica, returned to Little Creek. The ship's first major activity of 1967 was once again Operation \\"Springboard\\" in which she participated from 6 to 19 March. The tug entered restricted availability at Norfolk on 23 April and, soon after it ended, began a deployment to northern Europe on 15 May. She operated in the Norwegian Sea and visited ports in Norway, Scotland, and the Netherlands before returning to Little Creek on 1 October. She operated in the Virginia Capes area through the end of the year and into May 1967. On the 19th of that month, the tug got underway for Scotland, reached Holy Loch on 30 May, and on 6 June was underway again for Rota. She operated in the Mediterranean until late September and visited the ports of Suda Bay, Crete; Valletta, Malta; Naples, Italy; Piraeus, Greece; ƒ∞zmir, Turkey; and Palma de Mallorca. Atakapa touched back at Little Creek on 29 September; completed a period of leave and upkeep: and, on 27 November, entered overhaul at the Norfolk Shipbuilding & Drydock Company. The overhaul was completed in mid-April 1968, and the vessel began refresher training. On 13 June, she got underway for operations in European waters and made port calls in Spain, England, Italy, Greece, and Crete. The tug left Rota on 12 October; returned to Little Creek on 22 October; and, on 17 December, began an availability alongside . On 25 February 1969, Atakapa shifted to Little Creek for upkeep. On 15 April, she was deployed to western Europe. She made port calls at Rosyth and Holy Loch, Scotland; Bergen, Norway; Aalborg, Denmark; and Portsmouth, England. She departed Rota on 24 September and reached Little Creek on 7 October. Late in January 1970, she sailed for Portsmouth, New Hampshire, to tow a ship back to Little Creek. She was deployed to Guantanamo Bay on 13 May to provide target services for warships undergoing gunnery practice. The ship left Cuba on 12 June and next towed a ship from Mayport, Florida, to Philadelphia. On 25 June, the tug was back in the Virginia Capes area. Routine towing duties to various ports along the East Coast occupied her until 16 October, when she sailed for Baltimore, Maryland, for hull repairs. On 27 October, she shifted back to a shipyard in Newport News, Virginia, for the remainder of the overhaul. Refresher training and upkeep lasted until late in March 1971. Atakapa made a brief voyage to St. Thomas, Virgin Islands, then returned to Little Creek on 9 April. She was involved in routine towing operations along the East Coast until 11 November when she sailed for Guantanamo Bay. The tug returned to Little Creek on 21 December for the holidays. After one and one-half months of training, Atakapa deployed to Roosevelt Roads, Puerto Rico, on 16 February 1972. She provided target services for units participating in Operation \\"Springboard,\\" but was back in home port on 23 March. On 1 May, the tug towed to Beaumont, Texas, and then pulled a vessel from that gulf port back to Norfolk, arriving there on 16 May. Local operations and availability occupied Atakapa through 21 July, when she got underway for Guantanamo Bay. She operated from that Cuban port for the next five weeks and then returned to Little Creek on 30 August for local operations through the rest of the year and the first months of 1973. On 11 April, Atakapa sailed for Guantanamo Bay, but was back in the Virginia Capes area on 15 May. Another Caribbean deployment occurred from 28 June to 9 August. After her return home, the tug operated along the East Coast. In early 1974, Atakapa sailed for the Caribbean for the annual \\"Springboard\\" operations. She operated along the East Coast for the last few months of her career as a commissioned Navy ship. Decommissioning and disposal On 1 July 1974, the tug was decommissioned and turned over to the Military Sealift Command (MSC). Operating with a civil service crew, USNS Atakapa (T-ATF-149) continued to support the Navy carrying out MSC missions for another seven years. During the summer of 1981, she was taken out of service and prepared for transfer to the Maritime Administration's National Defense Reserve Fleet. In September 1981, Atakapa ‚Äî still Navy property ‚Äî was berthed at the Maritime Administration facility at James River, Virginia. Following Congressional approval in 1996 for transfer to the Northeast Wisconsin Railroad Transportation Commission, she was handed over on 29 December 1997 to the Ontonagon County Economic Development Corporation on behalf of the Escanaba and Lake Superior Railroad, along with five other obsolete sister tugs. They were intended for a new trans-Lake Superior freightcar barge service between Ontonagon and Thunder Bay, Ontario, though it has been suggested that the company sought the tug's four General Motors engines (24 in all) to use in their locomotives. The project was abandoned in October 1999, shortly before title would have passed to the railroad company. Atakapa remained in lay-up between 1997 and 1999. On 25 August 2000, Atakapa was sunk as a target in 20.40.80N 64.05W during a fleet training exercise.

The Act appoints the Auditor General as the House of Assembly's independent legislative auditor of Government, its departments, agencies of the Crown, and Crown controlled corporations. The Auditor General reports to the House of Assembly, on significant matters which result from the examination of these entities. The Act also appoints the Auditor General as the auditor of the accounts and financial statements of the Province. This results in an opinion as to the fair presentation of these financial statements. In addition, the Auditor General is the auditor of the financial statements of a number of agencies of the Crown and issues a separate report for each of these agencies as to the fair presentation of their financial statements.  History  The Office of the Auditor General has a long history in Newfoundland. The first Comptroller and Auditor General, F.C. Berteau, was appointed in 1898. In his 1898-99 Report for the Colony of Newfoundland, Berteau made the following comment relating to the role of Auditor General: \\" I take it that the duties of an Auditor General do not stop at the checking and overseeing of the Public Accounts. They go further; he should note where and how alterations making for economy and the better management of the Public Funds can be effected without injury to the efficiency of the several services.\\"  Role of the Auditor General  The Auditor General Act, which was assented to on 31 October 1991, determines the role of the Auditor General. Implicit in the Act is the requirement for the Auditor General to provide the House of Assembly with timely, relevant information, necessary to enhance public sector accountability and performance. The Auditor General's fundamental role is to bring an independent audit and reporting process to bear upon the manner in which Government and its various entities discharge their responsibilities and report on their planned programs and their use of public resources. This role of the Auditor General is superimposed on the accountability relationship which exists between all levels of Government through to the House of Assembly. To fulfil its legislated mandate, the Office of the Auditor General has a staff of approximately 36, with 32 staff at the head office in St. John's and 4 staff at its Corner Brook branch. The Office is responsible for auditing financial statements and other accountability documents, evaluating management practices and control systems, and determining compliance with legislative and other authorities. Eighty-percent of audit staff hold professional accounting designations. The staff with their extensive experience in legislative auditing is one of the Office's greatest assets. On an annual basis the Auditor General examines the consolidated summary financial statements prepared by Government which include in the reporting entity certain organizations that are accountable for the administration of their financial affairs and resources either to a Minister of Government or directly to the Legislature, and that are owned or controlled by Government. The Auditor General also examines the statements of the Consolidated Revenue Fund of the Province which have been prepared by Government. Comments on these financial statements and comments on the reporting entity are included in a report prepared annually entitled Report of the Auditor General to the House of Assembly on the Audit of the Financial Statements of the Province. The Auditor General is the auditor of the financial statements and accounts of the Province and makes those examinations considered necessary to report as required under the Auditor General Act. There are 18 departments, the Consolidated Fund Services and the Legislature, involved in the administration of the revenue and expenditure program. The size and complexity of government operations prevent the audit of all programs and systems on an annual basis. Therefore, the Auditor General audits a selection of programs and systems each year designed to cover all significant operations on a cyclical basis. The Auditor General is the auditor of the financial statements of certain agencies of the Crown. As part of these audits the Auditor General expresses an opinion on the financial statements and when appropriate, issues a management letter. This letter highlights certain matters which come to attention as a result of the audit and includes any recommendations for improvement. These audits are performed in accordance with the provisions of the various legislation which creates the entities. Each year the Auditor General performs additional examinations of certain agencies of the Crown including those whose financial statement audits are performed by private sector auditors. These additional examinations are designed to review compliance with various legislation and to ensure that the entities have adequate systems of management control in place. The results of these examinations are disclosed in a report prepared annually entitled Report of the Auditor General to the House of Assembly on Reviews of Departments and Crown Agencies.  About the Office of the Auditor General  As outlined in the Auditor General Act, the Auditor General's fundamental role is to bring an independent audit and reporting process to bear upon the manner in which Government and its various entities discharge their responsibilities, report on their planned programs and their use of public resources. The role of the Auditor General complements the accountability relationship which exists between Government, its departments, agencies of the Crown and the House of Assembly, as illustrated in Figure 1. The Auditor General reports to the House of Assembly on significant matters which result from the examinations of Government, its departments and agencies of the Crown. The Auditor General is also the independent auditor of the Province's financial statements and the financial statements of many agencies of the Crown and, as such, expresses an opinion as to the fair presentation of their financial statements. In addition to allocating our resources to perform the above audits, reviews, and examinations, we may also receive requests to complete special assignments. Under the Auditor General Act, these special assignments may be requested by the House of Assembly, the Public Accounts Committee or the Lieutenant-Governor in Council. In these special assignments, the Auditor General reports to whoever makes the request. Section 12 of the Auditor General Act requires the Auditor General to report, at least annually, on: * The work of the Office; * Whether, in carrying out the work of the Office, the Auditor General received all the information including reports and explanations required; * The results of the examination of the Province's financial statements; * Audits, examinations and inquiries performed under the Act; and * The results of the examination of the accounts of the Province calling attention to anything the Auditor General considers significant relating to: * Collections of public money; * Disbursements of public money; * Instances where accounts have not been faithfully and properly kept; * Instances where assets acquired, administered or otherwise held were not adequately safeguarded or accounted for; * Instances where accounting systems and management control systems that relate to revenue, disbursements, the safeguarding or use of assets or the determination of liabilities were not in existence, were inadequate or had not been complied with; and * Any factors or circumstances relating to an expenditure of public money which in opinion of the Auditor General should be brought to the attention of the House of Assembly  Expertise in public sector matters  As a result of working exclusively in the public sector, Legislative Auditors have acquired extensive corporate and operational knowledge of Government. They are specialists in the field of public sector auditing and their credibility with legislators (for example, on topics such as emerging public sector trends and accountability issues) is thus well established. Given their extensive interaction with legislators, Legislative Auditors are in the notable position of being aware of, and understanding legislators' concerns. Furthermore, having a whole-of- Government mandate has allowed Legislative Auditors to speak to legislators about broad Government matters and to better identify those accountability and performance issues that have the greatest impact on Government. As a consequence, Legislative Auditors are better able to promote consistency of accounting across government organizations, and to make informed decisions about the selection, conduct and reporting of audits.

After performing in clubs in Cleveland, and then playing before label bosses, the band were then later signed by RCA Records on March 15, 1973 and released their eponymous debut album in the same year. The band later opened for such performers as Bob Seger, Cactus and Spirit to promote that first record, which has since been critically acclaimed in some classic rock circles. Soon after, though, the group disbanded, feeling unsupported by their label and being deserted by their manager. Most of the group later reunited, some 25 plus years later, after finding their first record pirated and selling in Europe. In 2009, they released Thieves, Liars and Traitors on an independent label in 2010. from a collection of unreleased material recorded in 1974. A third record, Better Days, has also since been released independently. The group was known for their mix of heavy blues rock, progressive rock, psychedelic rock and heavy metal. Initially formed by guitarist Al Pinell and drummer Joe Battaglia, the group would practice in his home before moving to a Cleveland warehouse to develop what would be their first record. The group's music was highly influenced by popular bands of the time, including late-60s psychedelic rock artists such as Cream, The Jimi Hendrix Experience and Blue Cheer as well as early-70s hard rock giants, Deep Purple and Led Zeppelin. The band featured two guitars, with bass and drums, and were led by a signature vocal. Lead vocalist Woody Leffel had a high-ranged delivery very similar to Robert Plant, Ian Gillan and Geddy Lee. In 2016, the band made a third recording, and were attempting to regain control of their since-pirated first record. Three members of the original group, Battaglia, Pinell and Bedford, teaming up again with guitarist Artie Cashin and bringing in vocalist Gerry Schultz. Leffel opted not to work on the third record.

Cape was born at Walworth, Surrey, England, the son of William Cape, a London bank manager who emigrated to Australia with his family in 1821. Cape senior became master of a private school, the Sydney Academy, at the end of 1822 and died in 1847. William Timothy Cape was educated at the Merchant Taylors' School, London, and was intended for the Church of England ministry. However, on his arrival in Australia, became an assistant master at his father's school. Though just 20 years of age he was made headmaster of the Sydney public school on 1 July 1827 when his father resigned. He had already made a reputation as a teacher and shortly afterwards, when a number of public school teachers from the country were brought into Sydney for training, Cape was given charge of them as he was considered the only qualified person available. In 1829 he opened a private school in King Street, Sydney, and when the Sydney College was founded in 1835 he transferred his own pupils there on being appointed headmaster. For seven years Cape was a successful headmaster; some of his distinguished pupils included Sir John Robertson, William Forster, William Bede Dalley, Sir James Martin, and T. A. Browne, and the number of students was approaching 300 when Cape came into conflict with the trustees and resigned at the end of 1841. This was disastrous for the school, for though the number of pupils kept up for some time, between 1843 and 1847 there was a drop in numbers from 283 to 62. The colony was passing through bad times, but it is clear that the trustees had not been able to find a successor who could approach Cape in personality and knowledge. Cape in the meantime had opened a private school at Paddington, which was carried on until 1856 when he retired. In 1859 Cape was elected a member of the New South Wales Legislative Assembly for Wollombi, and interested himself in the educational life of the colony as a commissioner of national education, a fellow of St Paul's College of the University of Sydney, and in connexion with the Sydney School of Arts. He visited England in 1855 and was again in England 1860‚Äì1863. He died at London on 14 June 1863. A memorial was placed in St Andrew's cathedral by his former pupils, however it was destroyed in 1941 during renovation.

In 1993, Throwing Muses alumna Tanya Donelly recruited Greenwood to join Belly as a bass guitarist. She played on that band's second album King and appeared on the cover of Rolling Stone. Donelly disbanded Belly in 1996 and Greenwood joined L7 as a bassist the following year. She continued with that group for three years. In 2001, Greenwood was recruited to play bass on tour in support of Canadian pop punk artist Bif Naked. Gail Greenwood (right) performing with Belly in Glasgow, Scotland 2018 Greenwood and her partner, singer/bassist Chil Mott, formed the group Benny Sizzler in 2003 with guitarist Mark Tomis and drummer Slim Jim Colleran. Alumni of this band include drummer Tom Berglund, the late guitarist/singer Gene Severens (who had played with Greenwood in Boneyard) and guitarist Terry Linehan (a fill-in guitarist for Green Day). Greenwood and Mott remain active in anti-sprawl efforts, promoting the retention of open spaces, responsible development and lobbying for land conservation in the face of tremendous pressure by big-box corporations including Wal-Mart. Greenwood resumed playing and writing music with Belly after the band reformed in 2016. A 2017 article with Vanyaland listed Greenwood's support for the Affordable Care Act following an endometrial cancer diagnosis discovered just prior to a scheduled reunion tour with Belly. Greenwood continued with chemotherapy and completed all the original tour dates as scheduled. In 2018, Belly released their third album, Dove, to generally favorable reviews.

When the Protocol which restricts the use of magic begins to break down, only a few handpicked people have a chance to preserve the balance of their crumbling society.\\" (1) Plot summary The year 3000 is approaching, and life continues as normal for most people. A few, however, are aware that the Protocol (the rules that determine how magic may be used) of the past thousand years is breaking down. Shandie is battling the Caliph in Zark, and gains himself a new Signifier when Ylo saves the banner from falling. While they follow Imperial decrees and take the war to the elves, King Rap in Krasnegar receives a warning from the gods that he must lose one of his children. After his son sees a vision of a legionary, he realizes that this has to do with the upcoming millennium, he sets out for Hub, the capital of the Impire, to speak with his friend the Imperor. Tha√Øle, a Gifted pixie in mysterious Thume, stands Death Watch over a neighbor, and receives her first Word of power. This earns her interest from the College, and Jain arrives at her parents' house to talk to Tha√Øle. He informs her she will be going to the College next year, and there is nothing she can do about it. After suffering defeat from summoned dragons at Nefer Moor, the Legion retreats back to Qoble. Shandie and his inner circle decide to head to Hub to speak with the Imperor. Instead of traveling conventionally, they race to Hub to beat the message of their coming. On the way, a cloaked Pixie visits them and tells them of a preflecting pool at Wold Hall (putting your left foot in the pool shows you what you should seek, your right foot shows you what you should avoid). They detour to visit it, and each person's vision guides their actions afterwards. Tha√Øle, despondent over not being allowed to meet a man and have her own Place, meets Le√©b. They fall in love and find a Place far from home. Tha√Øle hopes that the College won't find her or care about her, but the College catches up with her just as her child is born. They spirit Tha√Øle away to the College and the Keeper. Shandie and company arrive in Hub, and find the Imperor a deranged, drooling husk of his former self. Shandie immediately seizes administrative control, and plans on how to meet with the young man he saw in the pool (who turns out to be Rap son). Ylo's vision was a lovely women naked amid daffodils, and the woman turns out to be Princess Eshiala. When the Imperor finally falls into a coma and dies, preparations are made for the upcoming coronation of Shandie. During practice, the Warlock Raspnex appears and tells the procession to crown Shandie immediately. Ylo takes charge and completes the ceremony just as the four warlocks' thrones are destroyed by magic. The group meets for a council of war, and go to Dr. Sagorn's house (the vision seen by Sir Acopulo). Rap has just arrived and meets the group at the doctor's house. As they try to puzzle out what is going on, Raspnex shows up and tells them that the evil sorcerer Zinixo is taking over all of the sorcerers in the world, and plans to take over all of Pandemia. After a short discussion, the house is attacked, and Raspnex uses magic to whisk the group away to safety.

He was among the first law professors to import the Harvard case method into Canadian legal education. He was also known for his confrontational and aggressive personality. He was born in London, Ontario. He taught at Osgoode Hall Law School from 1927. During this time he championed many reforms of the legal education system, and in particular favoured a greater role for classroom instruction over the existing apprenticeship model. In 1949, the Law Society of Upper Canada rejected his proposed reforms and Wright left Osgoode to take up the position of Dean at the University of Toronto Faculty of Law. Together with other professors, including Bora Laskin, he shaped the undergraduate law program into a professional law school. He remained with the university until his death.

Geography  = Location = The community of Siegbach lies in the Lahn-Dill Highland in the valley of its namesake brook, the Siegbach, which empties into the Aar to the south at Bischoffen. More than half of the municipal area is wooded. = Neighbouring communities = Siegbach borders in the north on the communities of Eschenburg (Lahn-Dill-Kreis) and Angelburg, in the south on the communities of Bischoffen and Mittenaar, in the southwest on the town of Herborn, and in the west on the town of Dillenburg (all in the Lahn-Dill- Kreis). = Constituent communities = The community consists of the five centres of Eisemroth (administrative seat), Oberndorf, Tringenstein, √úbernthal and Wallenfels.  History  As part of Hesse's municipal reforms, the formerly independent municipalities of Eisemroth, Tringenstein, √úbernthal and Wallenfels merged on 1 January 1972 to form the greater community of Siegbach, after the communities of Oberndorf and Eisemroth had already been united for a year. The new community's namesake is the brook in whose valley the greater part of the community lies. Within the municipal area once stood three castles, namely in Eisemroth (on whose site a church now stands), Wallenfels and Tringenstein. They came into being during the \\"Hundred Years' Dernbacher Feud\\", which was hard-fought in this area. It was a struggle waged between 1233 and 1333 between the Lords of Dernbach and the ambitious Counts of Nassau, who eventually won.Burg Dernbach  Politics  = Coat of arms = Siegbach's civic coat of arms might heraldically be described thus: In vert on ground Or a mine gallery sable with framework Or, therein, a crossed hammer and pick (the traditional mining tools or Gez√§he) argent. The arms refer to the municipal area's former mining industry.  Sightseeing  The Wilhelmsteine (\\"William's Stones\\"), lying between Tringenstein and Wallenfels, are a group of pyrite monadnocks in the middle of the Schelderwald (a foothill of the Rothaargebirge range). Every year on Ascension Day, the Wilhelmsteine serve as a local pilgrimage place. A religious service is performed among them on this day. The Wilhelmsteine, named after Count Wilhelm of Nassau, were in earlier times known as the Buschsteine. They were presumably the pre-Christian central holy place of the whole surrounding area. Nearby, at the Angelburg, from the early to high Middle Ages was an important crossroads of old long- distance trade roads. The Hohe Stra√üe (High Road) or as it was also known Herborner Stra√üe (Herborn Road) coming from the northeast crossed the great east-west trade road there, the Brabant Road, which ran from Leipzig by way of Cologne to the province of Brabant (nowadays in Belgium). Locally, it was also known as the Schelderwald Weg, and in old documents as strada publica (the public road). The Westfalen Weg (Westphalia Way) also joined the knot of log- distance roads here, following more or less today's Highway L3047 up to the Zollbuche (\\"Customs Beech\\" ‚Äì a tree that marked a border in days of yore), and then reaching the Angelburg by way of G√ºnterod and Salzb√∂desattel. Continuing north on this route, one could reach Bremen. At the Angelburg, evidence of an important prehistoric settlement has been found. Castle ruins can be found at Tringenstein and Wallenfels (only rubble heaps and dry moats).

The character was created in 1956 by the Israeli cartoonist Kariel Gardosh, known by his pen name Dosh. The cartoon appeared for many years in the newspaper Maariv. Yosef Lapid, Dosh's colleague on the editorial board of Maariv, described Srulik as an icon of Israel in the same way that Marianne and Uncle Sam were respectively icons of France and the United States.

Srulik is a pioneering Zionist, a lover of the land of Israel and its soil, a dedicated farmer who in time of need puts on a uniform and goes out to defend the state of Israel.

As against the stereotype of the weak or cunning Jew that was propagated by Joseph Goebbels, Dosh ‚Äî a Holocaust survivor ‚Äî drew a proud, strong and sympathetic Jewish character.

Typically this practice occurs after a domain name has expired and the previous (registrant) has not exercised his or her right to renew the name within the allotted time frame; usually 45 days following expiration. A domain's expiration date and time can be calculated based on the expiration date in the WHOIS, Auto-Renew Grace Period (0‚Äì45 days) and the Redemption Grace Period (RDP) of the registry managing the domain registration (30 days). Background According to the Generic Names Supporting Organization Council (GNSO) Deletes Task Force Report (2003), a council organized under the Internet Corporation For Assigned Names and Numbers (ICANN), three specific modes of warehousing have been identified: # The registrant allows the domain name to lapse, but registrar fails to delete the domain name during the grace period, resulting in a paid renewal to the registry. The registrar subsequently assumes registration of the domain name. # The registrant purchases the domain name through fraud and the registrar assumes registration of the name to resell in order to minimize losses. # The registrar registers the domain in its own name outright. Controversy The Registrars Accreditation Agreement (RAA) currently does not disallow this practice. However, the ICANN community has open calls for policy changes to limit warehousing, as it is perceived as unfair to potential registrants. The primary concern today with the practice of domain warehousing is that retail registrars, which have historically focused on serving individual and small business registrants, are now actively collecting lapsed domain names and offering drop catch services that conflict with the concept of fair access to domain names. An additional concern is that companies pooling scores of drop registrars for additional registry connections will stand at the expiring domain spigot conducting domain tasting without paying, and then warehouse those that meet traffic criteria while denying the broader community a fair opportunity to compete for those expiring names. From 2005 to 2008, GoDaddy had a subsidiary Standard Tactics, which held domains previously owned by GoDaddy. Shortly after this was reported on, GoDaddy closed down Standard Tactics. However, today, GoDaddy openly practices domain warehousing. Instead of letting domains which GoDaddy considers \\"Premium domains\\" expire, GoDaddy takes control of and lists as \\"Premium Domains\\" those domains, after the registrant - GoDaddy's customer - allows them to lapse, even before the end of the redemption period. These domains are often listed at GoDaddy auctions for thousands of dollars, as \\"Premium domains\\". GoDaddy sells these domains at auction while the original registrant is still entitled to redemption of the domain, with the stipulation that if the original registrant uses their right to redeem the domain and renews it within the redemption period, GoDaddy simply refunds the money paid by the winning bidder. ICANN has not yet amended the RAA with policies to limit domain warehousing and related practices. Registrars are in a unique position to impact domain name pricing by introducing competitive bidding or auctions for expired domain names. Fair access to domain names is further impacted when registrars opt not to market the warehoused domains immediately, delaying the recycling of warehoused names indefinitely.

Background =Kentucky neutrality= On April 15, 1861, the day after the U.S. Army surrendered Fort Sumter to the Confederates, President Abraham Lincoln called upon the States remaining in the Union to provide volunteers to suppress the insurrection in the seven StatesAlabama, Florida, Georgia, Louisiana, Mississippi, South Carolina and Texas. which had seceded from the Union by that date.Eicher, David J. The Longest Night: A Military History of the Civil War. New York: Simon & Schuster, 2001. . p. 53. Pro-Confederate Kentucky Governor Beriah Magoffin refused to send troops, but since the majority of the members of the Kentucky General Assembly were pro-Union, Lincoln's call for volunteers did not prompt the State to secede.Hearn, Chester G. The Civil War State by State. Devon: RedBlue Press, 2011. Maps by Mike Marino. . p. 157.Four more States, Arkansas, North Carolina, Tennessee and Virginia, did soon secede.

In elections on August 5, 1861, Kentucky voters returned a veto- proof majority of pro-Union members to the Kentucky House of Representatives and Kentucky Senate. On August 6, 1861, Camp Dick Robinson, a Union camp, was established near Lexington, Kentucky.Long, 1971, p. 106. On September 2, 1861, the Kentucky General Assembly raised the U.S. flag over the Kentucky State Capitol at Frankfort, Kentucky.Long, 1971, p. 114. =Confederate movements= On September 3, 1861, Confederate Maj. Gen. Leonidas Polk ordered Brig. Gen. Gideon Pillow to seize Columbus, Kentucky on the Mississippi River before Union forces could do so. This ended Kentucky's neutrality, led to Union Brig. Gen. Ulysses S. Grant's seizure of Paducah, Kentucky on September 6, 1861, and other military movements and actions by both Union and Confederate armies in Kentucky soon afterwards.Long, 1971, pp. 114‚Äì115. Brig. Gen. Felix Zollicoffer's Confederates had moved from Tennessee to push from the Cumberland Gap into central Kentucky in an effort to gain control of that important border state. On September 14, 1861, ten days after his 5,400-man force left their base, Zollicoffer occupied the Cumberland Gap and took position at the Cumberland Ford (near present-day Pineville, Kentucky) to counter Unionist activity in the area.Sanders, Stuart W.

Knoxville: University of Tennessee Press, 2004. . Retrieved June 26, 2014. p. 46. For much of the summer, Union sympathizers had been organizing and training recruits from Kentucky and eastern Tennessee at Camp Andrew Johnson near Barbourville, Kentucky. Zollicoffer was determined to seize this camp and eliminate the threat to the Confederate position. He also wanted to relieve pressure on the army of Albert S. Johnston and divert Union troops away from Johnston's command. Battle In a heavy morning fog on September 19, 1861, Zollicoffer sent forward about 800 men under Col. Joel A. Battle. Camp Andrew Johnson had largely been vacated, with the recruits moved to nearby Camp Dick Robinson, where several thousand Federal troops were gathered under the command of Brig. Gen. George H. Thomas. As Battle's men approached the Camp Johnson, they encountered a force of 300 pro-Union Home Guards under Capt. Isaac J. Black, who hastily removed the planking from the bridge to prevent the Confederates from crossing it. Sharp skirmishing broke out, but Battle's superior numbers prevailed and Zollicoffer won a victory. His men seized the camp, destroyed the buildings, and captured the arms and equipment left behind by the retreating recruits.McKnight, Brian D.

Fighting in the open, the attacking Confederates lost 7 men killed in the encounter. Although Zollicoffer briefly withdrew to his camp at Cumberland Gap, he sent a detachment of his men to drive off another Union Home Guard force at a camp at Laurel Bridge, in Laurel County, Kentucky soon after the Battle of Barbourville.Fowler, 2004, p. 47. On September 28, another detachment seized 200 barrels of salt and destroyed the Goose Creek Salt Works in Clay County, Kentucky. In response to Zollicoffer's actions, Union Brig. Gen. Thomas sent troops under Col. Theophilus T. Garrard to set up Camp Wildcat at Rockcastle Hills, near London, Kentucky, at Wildcat Mountain north of the salt works, to secure the ford on the Rockcastle River, and obstruct the Wilderness Road passing through the area.

It is the host unit at Travis Air Force Base in California. Wing activity is primarily focused on support in the Middle East region, however it also maintains operations in areas of the Pacific and Indian Oceans.

History :For additional history and lineage, see 60th Operations Group =United States Air Forces in Europe= The 60th Air Mobility Wing traces its origins to the establishment of the 60th Troop Carrier Wing on 1 July 1948 at Kaufbeuren Air Base, Occupied Germany. The wing was established in accordance with the Hobson Plan organizational structure established by the United States Air Force in 1948. Assigned to the new wing was the 60th Troop Carrier Group (60th TCG), which served as its operational component. The 60th TCG was assigned three flying squadrons: the 10th, 11th, and 12th Troop Carrier Squadrons, which were assigned C-54 Skymaster transports. Support units of the 60th TCW in 1948 were the 60th Airdrome Group; the 60th Maintenance & Supply Group and the 60th Medical Group. The 60th TCG, however, was detached, supporting the Berlin Airlift from other bases. The wing operated under control of the provisional airlift task force from 29 July 1948 but was not directly involved in airlift operations until it moved to RAF Fassberg, Germany in January 1949. From 20 to 26 January September 1949, the group flew Berlin airlift missions. Its C-54s primarily carried coal into West Berlin. On 29 January 1949, the wing's headquarters element moved to RAF Fassberg and fell under operational control of the 1st Airlift Task Force. There, the 60th gained operational control of the 313th Troop Carrier Group, the 513th Air Base Group, the 513th Maintenance and Supply Group, and the 513th Medical Group. When the Berlin Airlift ended on 26 September 1949, the 60th began moving without its personnel and equipment to Wiesbaden Air Base, West Germany, where it assumed the resources of the inactivated 7150th Air Force Composite Wing. The 60th Troop Carrier Wing became operational at Wiesbaden on 1 October 1949, and United States Air Forces Europe re-designated the wing again as the 60 TCW (Medium) on 16 November 1949. On 21 January 1951, Twelfth Air Force became the 60th's new higher headquarters. 376th Troop Carrier Squadron, C-123B Providers, Dreux-Louvilliers Air Base, France, 1957 At this time, the wing had no tactical mission. On 2 June 1951, the wing replaced the 61st Troop Carrier Wing at Rhein-Main Air Base, where the 60th had been stationed on detached service. At this time, the 60th TCW resumed a tactical role and assumed responsibility for controlling all US tactical airlift resources in Europe. The 60th TCW provided logistic airlift services to US and Allied forces in Europe while maintaining host unit responsibilities at Rhein- Main. Operating the C-82 Packet, C-119 Flying Boxcar, and C-47 Skytrain aircraft, the wing participated in countless exercises and provided air transportability training to US Army units. On 1 August 1955 the wing was assigned to the 322d Air Division and moved to Dreux Air Base, France. Later that month, the 62d Troop Carrier Squadron, a Tactical Air Command rotational unit from Sewart Air Force Base, Tennessee, arrived and entered attached status with the 60th. From 22 March to 2 June 1956, the 309th Troop Carrier Group, Assault (Fixed Wing), from Ardmore Air Force Base, Oklahoma deployed to Dreux. Initially, attached to the 60th for logistical support and operational control, the 309th was officially assigned to the wing on 8 August 1956. The 309th introduced the C-123 Provider to the European theater. In a major reorganization, the 322nd reduced the headquarters elements of the 60th, 309th, and the 60th Mission and Support Group to one officer and one airman each on 15 November 1956. In conjunction with this, the 60th's chief of operations gained control of the flying squadrons. All three groups inactivated on 12 March 1957. In mid-1958, the 376th, 377th, and 378th Troop Carrier Squadrons, formerly assigned to the 309th, transitioned from the C-123 to the C-119 aircraft. Then on 25 September 1958, the 60th Troop Carrier Wing was inactivated, ending its first period of service. With the exception of the 10th, 11th, and 12th Troop Carrier Squadrons (which now reported directly to the 322d Air Division) all other units that were assigned to the 60th were also inactivated. =Military Airlift Command= Douglas C-124A Globemaster II, AF Ser. No. 51-5174 of the 60th Troop Carrier Wing, August 1966. This aircraft was sent to AMARC in November 1969 Douglas C-133B-DL Cargomaster, AF Ser. No. 59-0533, 60th MAW, 1967. This aircraft was sent to AMARC in 1971. It was sold to a private owner and placed on civil registry as N77152, later sold to Cargomaster Corp of Anchorage, Alaska as N133B. Scrapped at Anchorage IAP April‚ÄìJuly 2000. Lockheed C-5A Galaxy, AF Ser. No. 68-0010, of the 60th Military Airlift Wing in 1970s livery. The 60th Military Airlift Wing was re- activated on 27 December 1965 and replaced the Military Air Transport Service (MATS) 1501st Air Transport Wing, Heavy, as the \\"host-wing\\" at Travis Air Force Base, California, on 8 January 1966. This was as a result of the inactivation of MATS provisional organizations and the establishment of United States Air Force permanent units of the new Military Airlift Command (MAC), which replaced MATS as the primary USAF strategic airlift command. The newly- activated 22d Air Force (successor to the Western Transport Air Force of the Military Air Transport Service) at Travis became the new parent organization for the 60th. Flying the C-124 Globemaster IIs, the C-130 Hercules, the C-141A Starlifter, and the C-133 Cargomaster, the 60th entered service while the US was beginning a major buildup of its military forces in Southeast Asia. The 60th quickly established a strategic aerial pipeline to the region, whose support of US forces in South Vietnam earned the unit three Air Force Outstanding Unit Awards. In 1966, the wing became the first recipient of the Air Force Logistic Systems Award. Assigned to the wing on 8 January 1966, the C-141-equipped 75th Military Airlift Squadron transitioned to the C-5 Galaxy, becoming the Military Air Command's first operational squadron to fly the new transport aircraft. On 6 February 1972, the wing added a second C-5 squadron, when the 22d Military Airlift Squadron activated at Travis. In the spring of 1973, the 60th Military Airlift Wing became a major participant in Operation HOMECOMING, the repatriation of American prisoners of war from North Vietnam. As the C-141s arrived with the former POWs, the David Grant Medical Center at Travis became a major processing facility for the returnees. HOMECOMING marked the official termination of US involvement in the Vietnam War. During the fall of 1973, the 60th supported Operation NICKEL GRASS, the support of Israel during the Yom Kippur War in the Middle East. As the Military Air Command's prime representative in this operation, the 60th flew 36 C-5 and C-141 missions and delivered over 22,000 tons of supplies and equipment. With the Communist takeover of Cambodia and South Vietnam imminent, MAC diverted a C-5, flown by the 22nd Military Airlift Squadron, from Clark Air Base in the Philippines to Tan Son Nhut Air Base near Saigon to fly the first Operation BABYLIFT mission. Both BABYLIFT and Operation NEW LIFE missions transported thousands of refugees to the United States during April‚ÄìMay 1975. By the end of Operation BABYLIFT, MAC carriers airlifted 1,794 Southeast Asian orphans to their new American families. Military Air Command C-141s carried 949 of those babies. In October 1974, the 60th began supporting Operation DEEP FREEZE missions, the annual resupply of scientific research teams in the Antarctic. Flying from Christchurch, New Zealand, the wing had logged a near perfect record for reliability. On 4 October 1989, a 60th Military Airlift Wing C-5 became the first \\"Galaxy\\" to land on the Antarctic continent. For airlift achievements during the 1970s, the wing earned two more Air Force Outstanding Unit Awards (AFOUA). To upgrade cargo carrying capacity, MAC initiated a major upgrade program for its C-141A fleet beginning in 1979. The project added an in-flight refueling system and 23 feet in length to the fuselage. The stretched \\"Starlifter\\" was designated the C-141B. The 60th sent its first C-141A to the Lockheed-Georgia Company on 13 August 1979. The wing received its last \\"B\\" model on 10 May 1982. A highly visible instrument of US foreign policy, the 60th played an important role in maintaining the balance of power in the world during the 1980s. Supporting US naval forces in the Indian Ocean and Gulf of Arabia (sic), the wing flew frequent missions to Diego Garcia and other installations in the region. When underwater mines, suspected to have been placed by Iran, threatened the Red Sea shipping lanes in 1984, the 60th airlifted minesweeping helicopters from Naval Air Station Norfolk, VA, to Rota, Spain, where the Navy assembled and carried them into action via surface vessel. In 1987, a similar situation in the Persian Gulf resulted in the deployment of the same helicopter minesweepers. Throughout the 1980s, the wing supported several important troop deployments to Central America. The deployments demonstrated US resolve to oppose corrupt dictatorships and Soviet-backed governments. Operation URGENT FURY in 1983 took the Caribbean island-nation of Grenada out of the hands of Soviet-backed Cubans. Operation GOLDEN PHEASANT in 1988 projected US strength to counter Nicaraguan incursions into Honduras; Operation NIMROD DANCER in May 1989 showed US opposition to Panamanian dictator Manuel Noriega; and Operation JUST CAUSE in December 1989 and January 1990 toppled Noriega from power and led to his arrest and trial in the US. For its participation in JUST CAUSE, the 60th earned another AFOUA. Members of the 60th have participated in countless humanitarian airlift missions over the years. When earthquakes devastated Mexico City in 1985, a 60th Military Airlift Wing C-5 was one of MAC's first aircraft to deliver relief equipment. In December 1988 and early 1989, personnel assigned to the 60th Aerial Port Squadron helped load Soviet IL-62 aircraft with medical supplies and relief equipment for shipment to earthquake victims in Armenia. In 1989, the wing carried relief supplies to Charleston, South Carolina and the US Virgin Islands to assist victims of Hurricane Hugo. Later that year, crews also flew relief equipment and personnel to San Francisco's south bay area to assist victims of the 1989 Loma Prieta earthquake. The 60th played a key role in Operation FIERY VIGIL. During June and July 1991, repeated eruptions of Mount Pinatubo in the Philippines, buried Clark Air Base with tons of volcanic ash, thus forcing an emergency evacuation of US military dependents and non-essential military personnel. =Modern era= David Grant USAF Medical Center, Travis AFB, CA (official USAF photo) The 60 AMW team celebrating their win with General Duncan McNabb A F-14D and F/A-18Cs prepare to refuel from a KC-10 Extender, assigned to the 60th Air Mobility Wing, during a mission over the Persian Gulf region Driven by the end of the Cold War, economic factors and a smaller perceived threat to its security, the US completely reorganized the Department of Defense and significantly reduced its military forces, beginning in 1989. During 1991 and 1992, the Air Force underwent the most massive restructuring since its establishment as a separate service in 1947. With the restructuring, MAC became the Air Mobility Command (AMC) and absorbed the tanker airlift resources of the former Strategic Air Command (SAC). As the \\"objective\\" wing became the hallmark of the new Air Force, AMC re-designated the 60th as the 60th Airlift Wing on 1 November 1991. On 2 August 1990, the armies of Iraqi dictator Saddam Hussein invaded the neighboring tiny, oil-rich nation of Kuwait. Responding to a request for assistance from King Fahd Ibn Abdul Aziz of Saudi Arabia, US President George Bush ordered troops to the region as part of Operation DESERT SHIELD. A coalition of 27 allied nations supported the efforts with troops, money, medical teams, supplies, and equipment. Operation DESERT STORM, the coalition move to remove the Iraqi troops from Kuwait, began on 17 January 1991. The 60th played a vital role throughout the course of Operation DESERT SHIELD/STORM, by flying 1,280 C-5 and 954 C-141 missions from Travis Air Force Base. The airlift portion of the operation was nicknamed Operation VOLANT WIND. Relief efforts kept the 60th busy. Beginning in August 1990, the wing provided airlift and logistic support to US and coalition forces in Southwest Asia, while continuing to perform worldwide airlift operations, including humanitarian missions to nations to Latin America and the former Soviet Union. In 1992‚Äì1993, commenced airlift in support of U.S. relief operations in Somalia during Operations PROVIDE RELIEF and RESTORE HOPE. It continued to support on-going operations in Southwest Asia during Operation SOUTHERN WATCH. The wing's elements also supported Operation PROVIDE COMFORT for Kurdish refugees, supported the evacuation of military personnel and their dependents from the Philippines through Operation FIERY VIGIL in 1991, and provided airlift support to Balkans peacekeeping missions beginning in 1995 with Operation JOINT ENDEAVOR, and continuing under Operations JOINT GUARD and JOINT FORGE. It deployed tanker and support elements to the European theater during Operation ALLIED FORCE from March‚ÄìJune 1999, as well as providing airlift support to other air expeditionary forces deploying to the operation. After 11 September 2001 terrorist attacks on the World Trade Center and the Pentagon, the 60th began airlift and refueling operations in support of Operations NOBLE EAGLE and ENDURING FREEDOM. In March 2003, the United States as part of the Global War on Terrorism, initiated Operation IRAQI FREEDOM. One 8 August 2006, the 60th received its first C-17 Globemaster III aircraft \\"The Spirit of Solano\\". The next day, that aircraft was made operational and flew its first mission. The wing won top honors as the best Air Mobility Wing during the 2007 Air Mobility Rodeo. On 5 November 2008, the 60th received its 13th and final C-17 aircraft, \\"The Spirit of Travis.\\" Fifteen members of the Travis family were on hand to witness the aircraft's arrival. From February to August 2008, the 21st Airlift Squadron with C-17A Globemaster IIIs deployed as a squadron in support of the Operations ENDURING AND IRAQI FREEDOM. Their involvement in the operations garnered the squadron an Air Force Outstanding Unit Award with Valor. The 60th Air Mobility Wing continued to answer the call to action whenever it is needed. From January‚ÄìFebruary 2010, the 60th Air Mobility Wing‚Äôs C-17s of the 21st Airlift Squadron spearheaded the U.S. humanitarian response to the massive Haitian earthquake during Operation UNIFIED RESPONSE. In addition, the 60th Medical Group deployed and operated the largest land-based emergency hospital in Haiti in the weeks immediately after the earthquake. In March 2011, the 60th Air Mobility Wing supported three simultaneous new operations, while continuing to support combat operations in Iraq and Afghanistan. The first of these operations, Operation TOMODACHI, responded to the tsunami in northeastern Japan and the resulting damage at the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant by delivering relief supplies, rescue teams, and nuclear experts. In the second operation, Operation PACIFIC PASSAGE, the wing and its Travis AFB partners received over 2600 military volunteer evacuees and their pets from U.S. bases in Japan threatened by radiation leaking from the damaged nuclear power plant. In the third operation, Operation ODYSSEY DAWN, the 60th Air Mobility Wing provided support to the NATO operation to protect anti-Gadaffi rebels during the Libyan Civil War. From late-October‚ÄìNovember 2012, the 60th Air Mobility Wing rapidly responded to the President‚Äôs call to assist the Federal Emergency Management Agency in restoring utilities in areas of the northeastern U.S. devastated by \\"Superstorm\\" Sandy. Utility repair crews and their equipment from throughout the western U.S. found their way to the northeast aboard Travis C-5s and C-17s. =Lineage= 1501st Air Transport Wing Emblem Original emblem of the 60th Troop Carrier Wing, Medium, 1948 * Established as 60th Troop Carrier Wing, Medium, and activated, on 1 July 1948 : Redesignated: 60th Troop Carrier Wing, Heavy, on 5 November 1948 : Redesignated: 60th Troop Carrier Wing, Medium, on 16 November 1949 : Inactivated on 25 September 1958 * Redesignated 60th Military Airlift Wing, and activated, on 27 December 1965 : Organized on 8 January 1966 , assuming personnel and equipment of 1501st Air Transport Wing (MATS) which was discontinued. : Redesignated: 60th Airlift Wing on 1 November 1991 : Redesignated: 60th Air Mobility Wing on 1 October 1994 * Designated 60th Air Expeditionary Wing in September 2001 when wing elements deployed to combat areas. =Assignments= * United States Air Forces in Europe, 1 July 1948 : Attached to: Airlift Task Force [Provisional], 29 July ‚Äì 3 November 1948 : Attached to: 1 Air Lift Task Force, 4 November 1948 ‚Äì 19 January 1949 * 1 Air Lift Task Force, 20 January 1949 * United States Air Forces in Europe, 26 September 1949 * Twelfth Air Force, 21 January 1951 : Attached to 322d Air Division [Combat Cargo], 1 April 1954 ‚Äì 31 July 1955 * 322d Air Division (Combat Cargo), 1 August 1955 ‚Äì 25 September 1958 * Military Air Transport Service, 27 December 1965 * Twenty-Second Air Force, 8 January 1966 * Military Airlift, Travis, 15 February 1979 * Twenty-Second Air Force, 21 July 1980 * Fifteenth Air Force, 1 July 1993 * Eighteenth Air Force, since 1 October 2003 * Air Mobility Command when wing elements deployed to combat areas any time after 11 September 2001. =Components= Groups * 60 Troop Carrier (later, 60 Military Airlift; 60 Operations) Group: 1 July 1948 ‚Äì 12 March 1957 (detached 1 July 1948 ‚Äì 1 June 1951); 6 March 1978 ‚Äì 15 February 1979; since 1 November 1991 * 309th Troop Carrier Group: attached 22 March ‚Äì 7 August 1956, assigned 8 August 1956 ‚Äì 12 March 1957 * 313th Troop Carrier Group: attached 20 January ‚Äì 18 September 1949 Squadrons ;;United States Air Forces in Europe * 10th Troop Carrier Squadron: attached 15 November 1956 ‚Äì 11 March 1957, assigned 12 March 1957 ‚Äì 25 September 1958 * 11th Troop Carrier Squadron: attached 18‚Äì26 September 1949; attached 15 November 1956 ‚Äì 11 March 1957, assigned 12 March 1957 ‚Äì 25 September 1958 * 12th Troop Carrier Squadron: attached 15 November 1956 ‚Äì 11 March 1957, assigned 12 March 1957 ‚Äì 25 September 1958 * 376th Troop Carrier Squadron: attached 15 November 1956 ‚Äì 11 March 1957, assigned 12 March 1957 ‚Äì 25 September 1958 * 377th Troop Carrier Squadron: attached 15 November 1956 ‚Äì 11 March 1957, assigned 12 March 1957 ‚Äì 25 September 1958 * 378th Troop Carrier Squadron: attached 15 November 1956 ‚Äì 11 March 1957, assigned 12 March 1957 ‚Äì 25 September 1958 * 776th Troop Carrier Squadron: attached 28 October 1954 ‚Äì 1 May 1955 * 778th Troop Carrier Squadron: attached 28 April ‚Äì c. 1 November 1955 * 7206 Air Transport Squadron: attached ‚Äì 1 March November 1957. ;;Military Airlift Command * 7th Military Airlift Squadron: 13 March 1971 ‚Äì 6 March 1978; 15 February 1979 ‚Äì 1 November 1991 * 22d Military Airlift Squadron: 8 February 1972 ‚Äì 6 March 1978; 15 February 1979 ‚Äì 1 November 1991 * 28th Military Airlift Squadron: 8 January 1966 ‚Äì 8 July 1967 (detached 1‚Äì8 July 1967) * 44th Military Airlift Squadron: 8 January 1966 ‚Äì 1 March 1972 * 75th Military Airlift Squadron: 8 January 1966 ‚Äì 6 March 1978; 15 February 1979 ‚Äì 1 November 1991 * 84th Military Airlift Squadron: 8 January 1966 ‚Äì 1 July 1971 * 85th Military Airlift Squadron: 8 January 1966 ‚Äì 8 July 1967 * 86th Military Airlift Squadron: 8 January 1966 ‚Äì 6 March 1978; 15 February 1979 ‚Äì 1 November 1991 ;;Modern era * 19th Airlift Squadron: 1 November 1993 ‚Äì 31 December 1996 * 20th Airlift Squadron: 1 November 1993 ‚Äì 31 December 1998 =Stations= * Kaufbeuren AB, Germany, 1 July 1948 * RAF Fassberg, Germany, 20 January 1949 * Wiesbaden AB, Germany (later West Germany), 1 October 1949 * Rhein-Main AB, West Germany, 2 June 1951 * Dreux AB, France, 15 October 1955 ‚Äì 25 September 1958 * Travis AFB, California, since 8 January 1966 =Aircraft= * Primarily C-54, 1949; C-47, 1949; C-82, 1951‚Äì1953; C-119, 1951, 1953‚Äì1958; and C-123, 1956‚Äì1958 * Also operated, in fewer numbers, C-45, 1948; C-74, 1948; B-17, 1949‚Äì1951; B-26, 1949‚Äì1951; C-47, 1949‚Äì1951, 1951‚Äì1955; C-54, 1949‚Äì1951, 1951‚Äì1952; C-82, 1949‚Äì1951; L-5, 1949‚Äì1951; L-20, 1955 * Primarily C-124, 1966‚Äì1967; C-130, 1966; C-133, 1966‚Äì1971; C-141, 1966‚Äì1997; C-5, 1970‚Äì; C-17, 2006‚Äì; and KC-10, since 1994 * Also operated, in fewer numbers, VC/C-54, 1966‚Äì1969; VT/T-29, 1966‚Äì1973; U-3, 1966‚Äì1968; C-47, 1968‚Äì1969; C-131, 1969‚Äì1975; T-39, 1969‚Äì1975; WC-135, 1993.

It is named after John Colborne, 1st Baron Seaton, Lieutenant-Governor of Upper Canada from 1828 to 1836. Seaton Village is bordered by Bloor Street to the south, the Canadian Pacific Railway tracks to the north, Christie Street to the west, and Bathurst Street to the east. Officially, it is an enclave within The Annex neighbourhood, as defined by the City of Toronto. It is sometimes referred to as the West Annex. While Seaton Village shares several characteristics with the Annex (notably its architecture and its popularity with University of Toronto students), it is often perceived as a quieter, family-oriented neighbourhood with smaller, less expensive homes. The Koreatown shopping district is at its southern border. Character The area is primary semi-detached single family homes dating to the start of the 20th century. Most are either of solid brick construction, while some have a facade of brick. Most of the trees planted at the same time as the houses were built are still standing. One unique home is located on Clinton Street. The house is almost completely covered with circular \\"woodcakes\\" cut from billiards cues. Vermont Square Park is near the centre of Seaton Village. The park has a playground that was totally rebuilt in 2012, as well as off-leash dog park hours. St. Albans Boys and Girls club and the Bill Bolton hockey arena are also located in the park. The ethnic enclave of Koreatown is located on Seaton Village's southern boundary, at Bloor Street. There are also several small businesses located along Dupont Street. Karma Co- op, a co-operatively run health food store, is hidden down a lane way (officially named Karma Lane in 2014) and has operated in the area since 1972. Seaton Village is represented in the House of Commons of Canada as part of the University‚ÄîRosedale electoral district. It is represented in the Ontario Legislative Assembly as part of the Trinity‚ÄîSpadina constituency. It is served by two Toronto Transit Commission (TTC) subway stations: Bathurst and Christie. Buses run north from both stations, and buses run along Dupont. Seaton Village is bounded to the south by Bloor Street. Nearly the entirety of Seaton Village's portion of Bloor Street is occupied by a Korean ethnic enclave known as Koreatown. Prior to the influx of Korean immigrants in the 1980s, this section of Bloor Street was populated by people from Central and South America. Demographics In the 2016 Canadian census, Seaton Village was covered by census tract 0093.00. According to that census, the neighbourhood has 5,259 residents. Average income is $167,014, close to the average for the Toronto CMA. The ten most common languages spoken at home, after English, are: #Portuguese - 5.0% #Italian - 3.5% #Korean - 2.0% #Cantonese - 1.6% #Unspecified Chinese - 1.5% #Greek - 1.4% #Spanish - 0.8% #French - 0.6% #Hungarian - 0.5% #Polish - 0.5% Notable persons Seaton Village is the former home of Canadian poet and children's author Dennis Lee, Oscar-winning (for Chicago) sound engineer David Lee (no relation, now deceased), and sociologist Barry Wellman. It is the current home of novelist and playwright Ann-Marie MacDonald, musician Charles Spearin and songwriter/performer Nancy White. Seaton Village was also where Meghan Markle, UK's Duchess of Sussex, lived in a rented house at 10 Yarmouth Gardens while filming the TV series Suits.Lonny, \\"You Can Live In Meghan Markle's Former Toronto Bachelorette Pad\\", May 2018 She moved out in late November 2017 after work on the seventh season had been completed.

Beginnings  Neil Shicoff was born in Brooklyn, New York. He studied at the Juilliard School of Music, with his father, the hazzan Sidney Shicoff and others, including Franco Corelli in the early 1980s. He sang in small theatres in New York before music school, including a Don Jose in Bizet's Carmen at Amato Opera and small roles at Juilliard, and was an apprentice at the Santa Fe Opera in the summer of 1973. His professional debut as a tenor lead in a major opera house was in the title role in Verdi's Ernani, conducted by James Levine in Cincinnati in 1975. In 1976, Shicoff made his debut at the Metropolitan Opera as Rinuccio in Gianni Schicchi conducted by Levine.Shicoff was then engaged by the Met where he appeared in Rigoletto, La Boh√®me, Der Rosenkavalier, and Werther, which was to become one of his signature roles. He soon sang in the major opera houses in the U.S. and Europe, winning great notices and recording some of his roles. Shicoff experienced severe stage fright well into his career, which caused him to cancel a number of performances. He was known to be a perfectionist, carefully researching and preparing each role, both dramatically and vocally. In 1978, Shicoff married fellow Juilliard graduate, lyric soprano Judith Haddon. After the death of his mother in 1984, Shicoff suffered emotional problems, technical vocal difficulties and increasing performance anxiety. He cancelled numerous performances, and by the end of the 1980s he had developed a reputation for unreliability.  Rebuilding his career  Shicoff continued singing at the Met until 1990 when he appeared in the title role of Faust (opera). However, in 1991 he left America, fleeing the stresses and headlines engendered by his ongoing divorce proceeding and custody battle concerning his daughter, into a self-described European exile. He lived for three years in Berlin, then Z√ºrich, performing throughout Europe (with a handful appearances in Buenos Aires), and he slowly rebuilt his reputation for reliability. He appeared at Vienna State Opera, La Scala, Paris Opera, Covent Garden, Berlin's Deutsche Oper, Bavarian State Opera, Zurich Opera House and numerous other opera houses and concert halls throughout Europe. By 1997, Shicoff and Haddon finally reached a divorce settlement. Their final decree left Shicoff free to marry soprano Dawn Kotoski, with whom he had lived since 1990, and to renew his relationship with his daughter, Aliza. Shicoff also returned to the Met, as Lensky in Eugene Onegin. His last performance at the Met was in 2006 when he appeared as Rodolfo in Luisa Miller. By then he had appeared with company over 200 times in 20 different roles. Shicoff's most famous roles (besides Werther), include the title roles in Tales of Hoffman and Peter Grimes and Lensky in Eugene Onegin and Eleazar in La Juive, as well as for a number of the Romantic French and Italian lyric and spinto tenor roles. In addition to his opera performances, he has also sung concerts with the Israel Philharmonic conducted by Leonard Bernstein, the Berlin Philharmonic conducted by Claudio Abbado, the San Francisco Symphony conducted by Edo de Waart, and the Boston Symphony Orchestra conducted by Seiji Ozawa, among others, and at many festivals.  Later years  In the 2000s, Shicoff sang the roles of Cavaradossi in Tosca and Hoffmann at La Scala and Paris‚Äô Op√©ra Bastille; Des Grieux in Manon Lescaut; Don Jos√© in Carmen at the Lyric Opera of Chicago and the Zurich Opera House and Eleazar in Hal√©vy's La Juive at the Teatro La Fenice in Venice, with Wiener Staatsoper and the Zurich Opera House, Peter Grimes at the Teatro Regio di Torino. He has sung also Edgardo in Lucia di Lammermoor, the title role in Idomeneo, and Rodolfo in La boh√®me at the Vienna Stater Opera; Luisa Miller (Rodolfo) at the Met; Gabriele Adorno in Simon Boccanegra at Covent Garden and in Paris; Hermann in Tchaikovsky's The Queen of Spades; and Manrico, Cavaradossi and Pinkerton in Madama Butterfly at the Zurich Opera House, among others. Shicoff was a regular at the Vienna State Opera where he attained the rank of Kammers√§nger and was awarded honorary lifetime membership in the company. His personal friendship with the Austrian Federal Chancellor, Alfred Gusenbauer, led to wide expectation that he would follow Ioan Holender as director of the opera company in 2010. However, in a surprise decision Austrian Culture Minister Claudia Schmidt, appointed Dominique Meyer as director and Franz Welser-M√∂st as musical director in June 2007. Shicoff made his debut at the Mikhailovsky Theatre of St. Petersburg in 2010, and performed there as √âl√©azar in La Juive, Hermann in Queen of Spades, Captain Vere in Billy Budd and Canio in Pagliacci. In 2015 he was appointed head of opera at the Mikhailovsky, for a term of three years. During his time there he regularly held masterclasses with the theatre's young soloists. Since retiring from the stage, Shicoff has continued to work as a voice teacher with several other opera companies and conservatories as well as serving on the juries of voice competitions.

He is best known for his 1882 bushranging novel Robbery Under Arms. Biography Browne was born in London, the eldest child of Captain Sylvester John Brown, a shipmaster formerly of the East India Company, and his wife Elizabeth Angell, n√©e Alexander. His mother was his \\"earliest admirer and most indulgent critic . . . to whom is chiefly due whatever meed of praise my readers may hereafter vouchsafe\\" (Dedication Old Melbourne Memories). (Thomas added the 'e' to his surname in the 1860s). After his father's barque Proteus had delivered a cargo of convicts in Hobart, the family settled in Sydney in 1831. Sylvester Brown took up whaling and built a stone mansion, Enmore, which gave its name to the suburb of Sydney.Introduction to Robbery Under Arms by Dr. A. T. Brissenden, The Discovery Press, 1968 Thomas Browne was sent to W. T. Cape's school at Sydney, and afterwards to Sydney College, when Cape became its headmaster. One of Browne's closest school friends was a son of Colonel John George Nathaniel Gibbes, MLC, the Collector of Customs for New South Wales, and according to the Dulhunty Papers, Browne spent carefree holidays staying with the Gibbes family at their grand waterside residence on Sydney's Point Piper. When his father moved to Melbourne in 1839, Browne remained at Sydney College as a boarder until 1841 and then was taught by Rev. David Boyd in Melbourne. In 1843, though only 17 years old, Browne took up land near Port Fairy which he named Squattlesamere and was there until 1856. He visited England in 1860 and in 1862‚Äì1863 had a property, Murrabit run at Lake Boga near Swan Hill, followed by Bundidgaree station on the Murrumbidgee River near Narrandera in the Riverina in 1864. However, bad seasons in 1866 and 1868 compelled Browne to give up squatting, and in 1871 he became a police magistrate and gold commissioner. After living in Sydney a short time, in April 1871 he was appointed a police magistrate at Gulgong and gold commissioner in 1872. Browne was an experienced justice of the peace, having acted as chairman of the bench of justices at Narrandera, but in his first years at Gulgong, then one of the richest and largest goldfields in New South Wales, his ignorance of mining and the complicated regulations drew criticism of his competence as commissioner. He was persistently attacked by the Gulgong Guardian And District Mining Record until in 1873 it published an anonymous letter accusing him of bias and corruption. Its editor was thereupon convicted in Sydney of criminal libel and sentenced to six months gaol. The charges against Browne were disproved, and he won favour with the miners by magnanimously interceding with the judge for a light punishment of his libeller. In 1881 Browne was transferred as magistrate and mining warden to Dubbo and to Armidale in 1884. He moved to Albury as chairman of the Land Licensing Board in 1885, serving there as magistrate and warden from 1887 to 1895 until retiring to Melbourne. He died on 11 March 1915 in Melbourne and was buried in Brighton Cemetery. Literary career Browne spent around twenty-five years as a squatter and about the same time as a government official, but his third career as author extended over forty years. In 1865, while recovering from a riding accident, he wrote two articles on pastoral life in Australia for the Cornhill Magazine, and he also began to contribute articles and serial stories to the Australian weeklies.\\"How I Began to Write\\", The Town and Country Journal, 1 October 1898 One of these, Ups and Downs: a Story of Australian Life, was published in book form in London in 1878. It was well reviewed but attracted little notice. It was re-issued as The Squatter's Dream in 1890. In 1884 Old Melbourne Memories, a book of reminiscences of the eighteen-forties was published at Melbourne, \\"by Rolf Boldrewood, author of My Run Home, The Squatter's Dream and Robbery Under Arms\\". These had appeared in the Sydney Town and Country Journal and The Sydney Mail, but only The Squatter's Dream had been published in book form and then under the title of Ups and Downs. The name Boldrewood came from a line in the poem Marmion by Browne's favourite author, Sir Walter Scott. In 1888 Robbery Under Arms appeared in three volumes and its merits were immediately recognised. Several editions were printed before the close of the century. At the beginning of this novel the narrator, Dick Marston, is awaiting execution for crimes committed whilst he was a bushranger. He goes on to tell the story of his life and loves and his association with the notorious Captain Starlight. Some of the events in the book are based on actual incidents carried out by contemporary bushrangers like Daniel Morgan, Ben Hall, Frank Gardiner, James Alpin McPherson and John Gilbert. Robbery under Arms has remained popular since its first publication in 1888; the novel was filmed in 1907 (a version by Tait brothers and a version by Charles MacMahon), 1920 and 1957. A television series was made in 1985. The novel has also been serialised on radio in both Australia and Britain. Recognition Named in his honour, the 'Rolf Boldrewood Literary Awards' are awarded annually by the Macquarie Regional Library.Macquarie Regional Library Family Browne married Margaret Maria Riley (daughter of W. E. Riley and granddaughter of Alexander Riley) in 1860. She was the author of The Flower Garden in Australia, published in 1893, and survived him with two sons and five daughters, one of whom, \\"Rose Boldrewood\\", published a novel The Complications at Collaroi in 1911. Fourth daughter Louisa Browne married mine manager Robert Silvers Black on 11 June 1903. His sister, Emma, had married Molesworth Richard Greene of Woodlands, near Sunbury and thus connecting him to Sir William Stawell, and also the Chomley family (Hussey Malone Chomley, Judge Arthur Wolfe Chomley and Charles Henry Chomley). A brother, Sylvester John Browne was a mine manager.

United States copyright law Significant amounts of copyrightable creative works such as motion pictures, television programs, music, and computer gaming works are produced in the United States. In addition, a significant amount of fanfiction is created in the United States. For these reasons, although every nation's law is different and different laws may apply to different works of fanfiction, U.S. law is often centrally relevant when determining the legality of writing and/or sharing fanfiction. Under U.S. copyright law, the legality of a given work of fanfiction will depend principally on three legal doctrines: (1) copyrightability of the underlying source work; (2) the derivative work right; and (3) fair use. To have copyright protection under U.S. law, a work must be an \\"original [work] of authorship fixed in any tangible medium of expression . . . from which [it] can be perceived, reproduced, or otherwise communicated, either directly or with the aid of a machine or device.\\"17 U.S.C. ¬ß102(a)(2009). Such works of authorship include but are not limited to literature, music, plays, pictures and architectural works. Copyright cannot be applied to ideas, concepts, facts or other broad principles regardless of whether they are expressed in a tangible medium or otherwise. Copyright goes into effect automatically, even if a work is not published.17 U.S.C. ¬ß104(a)(b)(2009). For works created in 1978 or later, copyright protection persists for the life of the author plus 70 years; in the case of an anonymous work, a pseudonymous work, or a work made for hire, the copyright endures for a term of 95 years from publication, or for 120 years from the year of its creation, whichever expires first.17 U.S.C. ¬ß302(1998). According to current United States copyright, copyright owners have the exclusive right \\"to prepare derivative works based upon [their] copyrighted work.\\"17 U.S.C. ¬ß106(2)(2009). A derivative work is any work, including fanfiction, based upon one or more preexisting works.17 U.S.C. ¬ß101(2009). In the case where a copyright owner chooses to exercise their exclusive right to prepare derivative works against a work of fanfiction, they can sue the fanfiction writer for copyright infringement. To prove infringement, an owner must present evidence establishing that the accused has copied protected elements of the original work. The possible remedies available if infringement can be proven include an order to cease sharing and/or to destroy the work (known as an injunction), or monetary damages. The remedy is dependent on the harm done to the copyright owner, the intent of the infringing person, and the grievousness of the infringement.17 U.S.C. ¬ß502 - 504(2009). An example of injunction as remedy was seen in the case of Anderson v. Stallone. There, Sylvester Stallone successfully pursued an action for copyright infringement against Anderson, an author who wrote a proposed script for Rocky IV, by proving that the copyright-protected characters used in the previous Rocky movies were central to the new script. The court enjoined Anderson from pursuing the creation of a movie or other published work based on his script. Fanfiction is not infringing if it constitutes fair use of the underlying copyrighted work. In determining whether a particular use constitutes fair use, courts consider the following four factors: # \\"the purpose and character of the use, including whether such use is of a commercial nature or is for nonprofit educational purposes; # the nature of the copyrighted work; # the amount and substantiality of the portion used in relation to the copyrighted work as a whole; and # the effect of the use upon the potential market for or value of the copyrighted work.\\"17 U.S.C. ¬ß107(2009). Fair use is assessed on a case-by-case basis. While such genres as parody and criticism are enumerated by statute and case law as presumptively fair uses of a copyrighted work, fan fiction has not historically been recognized by U.S. courts as necessarily constituting these or other enumerated fair use genres, and thus neither falls categorically inside nor categorically outside the presumptive boundaries of fair use. Works of fanfiction are more likely to constitute fair use if they are \\"transformative\\" with respect to the original work, if they are non- commercial, if they appropriate relatively little of the original work, and/or if they do not tend to detract from the potential market for or value of the original work. In a 2009 case, United States District Court judge Deborah A. Batts permanently prohibited publication in the United States of a book by Swedish writer Fredrik Colting, whose protagonist is a 76-year-old version of Holden Caulfield of J.D. Salinger's The Catcher in the Rye. Judge Batts explicitly rejected arguments of parody and criticism, stating, > To the extent Defendants contend that 60 Years and the character of Mr. C > direct parodic comment or criticism at Catcher or Holden Caulfield, as > opposed to Salinger himself, the Court finds such contentions to be post-hoc > rationalizations employed through vague generalizations about the alleged > naivety of the original, rather than reasonably perceivable parody. The case was vacated and remanded by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit with orders to apply the eBay v. MercExchange test in determining whether publication of a work can be prohibited on a theory of intellectual property infringement before the case has gone to trial.Salinger v. Colting, Docket No. 09-2878-cv The case was settled in 2011, with Colting agreeing to cease distribution. In contrast, in Suntrust v. Houghton Mifflin Co., the United States Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit vacated a temporary restraining order and preliminary injunction sought by the copyright holders of Margaret Mitchell's Gone with the Wind against Alice Randall's The Wind Done Gone. In determining whether Randall's work rose to the level of transformative, Circuit Judge Birch used the guidelines for transformative works laid out in the Supreme Court's Campbell v. Acuff Rose Music. Birch found Randall's work to be transformative because it \\"[provided] social benefit, by shedding light on an earlier work, and, in the process, creating a new one.\\" Campbell had already established that the greater the transformative value a work held, the less important the other factors in the fair use test became. Despite Randall and Houghton Mifflin having released The Wind Done Gone as a commercial work, and Randall having used a substantial portion of Mitchell's work in her own, Birch found that the highly transformative nature of Randall's book overcame the other prongs of the fair use test. Trademark law Separate from the legal issues raised by fanfiction's interaction with copyright law, legal issues may also develop from United States trademark law. Current federal trademark law follows the Lanham Act, otherwise known as the Trademark Act of 1946. Under the Lanham Act, a trademark is \\"any word, term, name, symbol, or device, or any combination thereof\\" used in commerce to identify a service or good.U.S.C. ¬ß 1125 (2010) Under this definition, it is possible for the names and likenesses of television, film and book characters, fictional accounts, settings, or other elements of entertainment products to act as trademarks. Unlike copyright, however, trademark rights are not automatic. To establish a right in trademark, the rights-seeker must establish that his/her mark acts as a distinctive \\"source identifier\\" for a particular type of good or service. Thus, trademark rights may arise when a fictional character's name or likeness may serve to identify the source of an entertainment product or related good. For example, the use of Mickey Mouse's name or likeness may serve to identify a particular book or toy as originating from Disney. One way to establish that a mark acts as a distinctive source identifier is to establish that the relevant purchasing public has developed a strong association between the mark and its originating source. In legal terms, this is known as \\"secondary meaning.\\" If the trademark holder can show that its creation acts as a distinctive source identifier, s/he still must prove a likelihood of confusion to prevail in a trademark infringement claim. Different courts consider similar but not identical factors when deciding likelihood of confusion. Common factors that may be relevant to fanfiction include: #How well known and distinctive the mark allegedly being infringed is; #How similar the infringing mark is to the original mark; #How similar the allegedly infringing goods or services are to the markholder's goods or services; #Whether the infringer intended to deceive the purchasing public or to trade on the good will of the markholder; #The level of sophistication of those persons or groups likely to be the consumers of the mark; #Whether consumers were actually confused as to the source of the goods or services. The courts can weigh the factors in individual cases, and may consider additional factors as they please. To the extent that fanfiction uses source- identifying characters, settings and such, the marks are often well known are identical to the original, and are used in similar types of goods (i.e., written fiction). In this way, the first three factors relayed here weigh for the trademark holder. However, fanfiction writers generally do not intend to deceive the consuming public as to the source of the work, and often include prominent disclaimers at the outset of their works stating that the works are not the products of the original creators, both to honor the original creator and to prevent any possible confusion as to source. In addition, as a consuming audience, fanfiction readers are generally sophisticated regarding works' status as fanfiction, and are aware that fanfiction is not written or endorsed by those who hold the trademarks.Rebecca Tushnet, \\"Legal Fictions: Copyright, Fan Fiction, and a New Common Law\\" , 17 Loy. L.A. Ent. L.J. 651 (1997) As such, the last three factors tend to weigh in the direction of fanfiction writers. Trademark holders may also allege that the use of trademarked characters, settings, etc. may constitute trademark dilution. The concept of trademark dilution is that overuse or improper use of a mark, even when it does not create consumer confusion, can lessen the mark's uniqueness and value as a source identifier. A dilution claim requires that the mark in question be famous throughout general consuming public and that the use of the mark create a likelihood of either \\"blurring\\" or \\"tarnishment.\\" A likelihood of blurring occurs when the use of the mark creates an association that is likely to impair the distinctiveness of the famous mark; a likelihood of tarnishment occurs when the use of the mark creates an association that is likely to harm the reputation of the famous mark. Even if a likelihood of confusion or dilution were found, trademark law provides various defenses to alleged infringement. These defenses fall into the categories of \\"fair use\\" and \\"First Amendment.\\" Trademark \\"fair use\\" differs significantly from fair use under copyright law. In trademark law there are two types of fair use: descriptive and nominative use. Descriptive fair use permits the use of a descriptive mark in a descriptive way; for example, an advertisement could say that a particular dress shoe \\"feels like a sneaker\\" even though the phrase \\"Looks like a pump, feels like a sneaker\\" is the trademark of another company. Nominative fair use permits the use of a mark to identify the product that bears that mark, when (1) the product or service in question is not readily identifiable without use of the trademark; (2) no more of the mark is used than is reasonably necessary to identify the product or service; and (3) the user does nothing beyond use of the mark that would suggest sponsorship or endorsement by the trademark holder. For example, a news story about the New Kids on the Block can use the mark \\"New Kids on the Block\\" to identify the band. Nominative fair use is often particularly relevant to fanfiction, since a fanfiction writer's use of trademarked names, settings, etc. to identify characters, story settings, etc. will generally meet the three requirements for nominative fair use. For this reason, fanfiction is harder to succeed on than an allegation of copyright infringement. An additional defense to trademark infringement or dilution relies on the First Amendment guarantee of freedom of speech. Courts have shown reluctance to curtail creative uses of trademarks in expressive works. For example, in Mattel v. MCA Records, United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit permitted the band Aqua‚Äôs use of Mattel‚Äôs trademark in \\"Barbie\\" to sell songs, that MCA had a valid parody defense, as Aqua needed to use the word \\"Barbie\\" in its song \\"Barbie Girl,\\" based on the fact that the use of the mark was (1) artistically relevant to the song and (2) not explicitly misleading as to the source of the song. Because there was a relatively small likelihood of confusion, the Ninth Circuit held that the First Amendment protected Aqua's use of the mark. The First Amendment defense has not stood up where the trademark holder was able to prove the existence of significant actual confusion. An example of this is a parodic publication running a parody ad for a product, and the parody not being well done enough or labeled clearly enough for people to realize it is not a real ad. Because of these differences in the legal doctrines of trademark and copyright, trademark law is less likely to come into conflict with fanfiction.Meredith McCardle, Fandom, Fan Fiction and Fanfare: What's All the Fuss?, 9 B.U. J. Sci. & Tech. L. 443 (2003)Leanne Stendell, Comment, Fanfic and Fan Fact: How Current Copyright Law Ignores the Reality of Copyright Owner and Consumer Interests in Fan Fiction, 58 SMU L. Rev. 1551 (2005) A brief note on non-U.S. perspectives: while other countries do not necessarily weigh the interests of trademark owners and other speakers in the same way, noncommercial and expressive uses may receive protection under other nations' laws as well. For example, in South Africa, a T-shirt company was able to sell T-shirts parodying Black Label beer. Right of publicity Many countries, and some U.S. states, have laws governing rights of publicity. In the United States, rights of publicity are governed by state statutes and state common law, and thus vary from state to state. As a general matter, the right of publicity grants a right to famous persons to control the commercial use of their \\"name, image and likeness,\\" and sometimes extends to one's broader identity or persona. The case of White v. Samsung provides an example of the right of publicity protecting a celebrity's persona even when her name and likeness were not used: Samsung created an ad that pictured a robot in a blond wig and a red dress, in a pose that evoked Vanna White‚Äôs work on Wheel of Fortune. White prevailed under California law on the theory that although Samsung had not used her name or likeness, it had used a recognizable depiction of her persona without permission for its commercial gain. Arguably, celebrities whose names, images, likenesses or personas are used in real person fiction, have the right to assert claims against fanfiction authors based on rights of publicity. To date, though, no recorded right of publicity suits have been brought regarding noncommercial fan fiction about real persons. This may be, in part, because most states‚Äô right of publicity laws only apply to uses for commercial gain.of Unfair Competition ¬ß46 Despite the ruling in White, courts have shown hesitation in other suits to shut down even commercial artistic pursuits based on the right of publicity. Some courts have relied heavily on Circuit Judge Alex Kozinski's strong dissent from the White decision in order to deny a \\"Right of Publicity\\" claim.Distribution & MKTG, Inc. v. Major League Baseball Advanced Media, L.P., 505 F3d 818 (8th Cir. 2007). Others have relied directly on the First Amendment. In ETW v. Jireh, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit rejected a right of publicity claim brought by Tiger Woods against an artist who depicted Woods and other golf legends, holding that the transformative nature of the work exempted it from right of publicity liability under the First Amendment. In contrast, in Parks v. LaFace, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit held that the Outkast song \\"Rosa Parks\\" violated the civil rights icon's right of publicity because it was not sufficiently transformative. The court explained that the use of a name or likeness is not transformative for right of publicity purposes when it \\"is used solely to attract attention to a work that is not related to the identified person.\\"v. LaFace Records Based on these cases, it is not clear that a court would be willing to abridge free speech by holding that fictional writing about a real person constitutes a violation of that person's right of publicity. Advocacy regarding the legality of fan fiction In 2007 two UC Davis Law School professors argued in the California Law Review that \\"Mary Sue\\" fan fiction \\"that challenge the orthodoxy of the original likely constitute fair use\\". Citing Campbell v. Acuff-Rose Music, Inc.--which established that commercial parody can qualify as fair use if it can be perceived as commenting or criticizing on the original--and the subsequent Suntrust v. Houghton Mifflin, the authors wrote that \\"Similarly, many Mary Sues comment on or criticize the original, while at the same time create something new ... Mary Sues can be commercial and still be fair.\\" That year, a group of fans who engage in creating fan works and are part of the larger fan community founded the Organization for Transformative Works (OTW). OTW has since advocated the legitimacy of fan fiction due its transformative nature. OTW's position is that fan fiction and other fan labor products constitute copyright fair use under 17 U.S.C. ¬ß 107 because they add \\"new meaning and messages to the original\\" work, and thus fall under the exemption to U.S. copyright law the Supreme Court defined in Campbell and which was later revisited and followed in Suntrust. OTW's vision includes seeing \\"all fannish works recognized as legal and transformative and ... accepted as a legitimate creative activity.\\" Toward this end OTW works to educate fan writers and published writers about copyright laws, particularly the open legal questions around fan fiction and other fan works. OTW also maintains its own fan fiction archive, the Archive of Our Own, commonly called AO3. All fan fiction on the site is recognized as non-profit derivative works. While OTW provides a centralized netspace for fans to acquire knowledge and aid regarding their own creative works, and a voice for the fan community, it does not represent all fans. Fans have many different views on the legalities of fan works, from the pure question of whether these works are transformative, to differences in how fans feel fan works should be disseminated. Fan writers who argue that their work is legal through the fair use doctrine use specific fair use arguments in the context of fan works, such as: #Fan works do not deprive the owner of the source material of income #Fan works may work as free advertisement and promotion of the original source material #Fan works are usually non-profit. #Fan works do not copy, or attempt to substitute for, the original work. OTW is also not the only organization to support the idea that fan works are transformative. In Salinger v. Colting, the New York Times and other major media conglomerates filed an amicus brief supporting Colting's book, as did the Library Copyright Alliance. Copyright holders' attitude towards fan fiction Some copyright holders have stated specific positive or negative attitudes towards fanfiction. =Examples= Studios, productions companies, and producers Most major studios and production companies tolerate fan fiction, and some even encourage it to a certain extent. Paramount Pictures, for example, allowed the production of Star Trek: The New Voyages and Star Trek: The New Voyages 2 from Bantam Books, fan fiction anthologies which followed Bantam's Star Trek Lives! by reprinting stories from various fanzines; as well as Star Trek: Strange New Worlds, a series of ten anthologies from Pocket Books in which the short stories were selected through an open submissions process geared toward novice writers. Due to the ongoing nature of television production, some television producers have implemented constraints, one example being Babylon 5 creator J. Michael Straczynski. His demand that Babylon 5 fan fiction be clearly labeled or kept off the Internet confined most of the Babylon 5 fan fiction community to mailing lists during the show's initial run. Many writers and producers state that they do not read fan fiction, citing a fear of being accused of stealing a fan's ideas, but encourage its creation nonetheless. When Buffy the Vampire Slayer went off the air, for instance, creator Joss Whedon encouraged fans to read fan fiction during the show's timeslot.  Authors  While many authors, (e.g. Neil Gaiman, J.K. Rowling, D.J. MacHale, Stephenie Meyer, Terry Pratchett) do not take issue with authors of derivative works, a number of authors do. They may request that fan fiction archival sites remove and ban any pieces of fan fiction based on their original works. To date, no fan fiction archive has failed to comply with an author's request to remove works, and many archives feature a full list of authors whose work cannot be the source of a fan fiction on their site. Fan fiction hosting sites like MediaMiner and Fanfiction.net have lists of authors whose fandoms are prohibited from their sites. MediaMinder states, \\"This is a right they [the copyright owner] have as an author or owner of the work. No copyright owner has to allow fan fiction or even tolerate it.\\" Fanlore has a list of Professional Author Fanfic Policies that includes authors who support and authors who discourage fan fiction of their works. J. K. Rowling has also complained about sexually explicit Harry Potter fan fiction. However, lawyers on behalf of Ms. Rowling specifically noted that she has \\"no complaint about innocent fan fiction written by genuine Harry Potter fans\\" and she \\"is happy for spin-offs to be published online as long as the publications are not sold and it is made clear she was not involved in the stories\\", under the condition that they do not contain pornography or racism. In 2008, Steven Brust published a Firefly novel with a CC copyright notice. Noteworthy in regard to the acceptance of fan fiction is Eric Flint, who has set up a formal site for the submission of fan fiction into his canon in the 1632 series at Baen's Bar and has to date (March 2015) published 58 issues of The Grantville Gazette in electronic form and six in book form. These feature fan fiction and fan non- fiction alongside his original work (paying first semi-pro, and now SFWA rates). Flint (a former labor organizer and socialist) contends that this collective work allows the expansion of his alternate history universe into something approaching the complexity of reality. It can be argued, however, that since work published in the Gazette is paid (at professional rates) and cleared by Flint for canonicity, that this is not actually \\"fan fiction\\" in the commonly-understood sense of the term. Also noteworthy is the series of Darkover anthologies published by Marion Zimmer Bradley, beginning in 1980, consisting largely of fan fiction extended into her canon. These books led to a much talked about controversy. Bradley read something in a fan story that meshed well with a Darkover book she was currently writing, so she wrote the fan author, Jean Lamb, offering her \\"a sum and a dedication for all rights to the text.\\" In a 1991 Usenet post, Jean continued, \\"I attempted at that point to _very politely_ negotiate a better deal. I was told that I had better take what I was offered, that much better authors than I had not been paid as much (we're talking a few hundred dollars here) and had gotten the same sort of 'credit' (this was in the summer of 1992)...a few months later I received a letter from Ms. Bradley's lawyer threatening me with a suit.\\" After Bradley's death, more information has come out supporting the fan's story. The rumor, however, was that Bradley had a skirmish with a fan who claimed authorship of a book identical to one Bradley had published and accused Bradley of \\"stealing\\" the idea, and the resultant lawsuit cost Bradley a book. Either way, her attorney advised her against reading fan fiction of her work. Versions of this incident are credited by many to have led to a \\"zero tolerance\\" policy on the part of a number of other professional authors, including Andre Norton, and David Weber. Mercedes Lackey used to strictly disallow any posting of fan fiction set within her universes on the Internet, though she did allow stories to be published in approved fanzines with signed releases for each story. Recently, she has changed her stance to allow nonprofit fan fiction of her works so long as the fan fiction is licensed as a derivative work and uses a Creative Commons license. Anne Rice objected to fan fiction based on any of her characters (mostly those from her famous Interview with the Vampire and its sequels in The Vampire Chronicles) or other elements in her books, and she formally requested that FanFiction.Net remove stories featuring her characters. However, in 2012, Metro reported that Rice has taken a milder stance on the issue: \\"I got upset about 20 years ago because I thought it would block me,\\" she said. \\"However, it‚Äôs been very easy to avoid reading any, so live and let live. If I were a young writer, I‚Äôd want to own my own ideas. But maybe fan fiction is a transitional phase: whatever gets you there, gets you there.\\" Similar efforts have also been taken by Annette Curtis Klause, Robin Hobb, George R.R. Martin, and Robin McKinley among others. Many authors do this, they state, in order to protect their copyright and especially to prevent any dilution, saturation, or distortion of the universes and people portrayed in their works. Sharon Lee and Steve Miller, creators of the Liaden universe, strongly oppose fan fiction written in their universe. \\"I don‚Äôt want ‚Äúother people interpreting‚Äù our characters. Interpreting our characters is what Steve and I do; it's our job. Nobody else is going to get it right. This may sound rude and elitist, but honestly, it's not easy for us to get it right sometimes, and we‚Äôve been living with these characters. . .for a very long time... We built our universes, and our characters; they are our intellectual property; and they are not toys lying about some virtual sandbox for other kids to pick up and modify at their whim. Steve and I do not sanction fanfic written in our universes; any such work that exists, exists without our permission, and certainly without our support.\\" In an author's note in The Ringworld Engineers, Larry Niven stated that he was finished writing stories in the Known Space universe, and that \\"[i]f you want more Known Space stories, you'll have to write them yourself.\\" Internet writer Elf Sternberg took him up on that offer, penning a parody in which members of Niven's hyper-masculine Kzin species engage in gay sex and BDSM. Niven responded by denouncing Sternberg's story in the introduction to Man-Kzin Wars IV (Baen Books, 1991) and issuing a cease-and-desist for copyright violation. To date, Sternberg holds that the story is constitutionally protected parody, while Niven maintains that it is a copyright violation that lies outside of protected speech, though he has not legally pursued the matter further. Some authors have said that they wrote fan fiction before they were published, or are pro-fan fiction. Naomi Novik has mentioned writing fanfic for television series and movies, and says she'd be thrilled to know that fans were writing fanfic for her series (though she also said she'd be careful not to read any of it); Anne McCaffrey allowed fan fiction, but had a page of rules she expected her fans to follow; Anne Harris has said, \\"I live for the day my characters get slashed\\"; Tamora Pierce stated on her website that she began writing Lord of the Rings and Star Trek fanfiction and has no issue with fanfictions based on her works, provided they are non-profit. Author Cassandra Clare was a popular Harry Potter fanfiction author before she published her first novel. =Changing and selective policies= Copyright holders may have been changing their policies towards fan fiction. Some companies like CBS and Lucasfilm Ltd., which had been historically hostile to fan fiction, changed parts of their model in order to be more fan friendly. This included trying to encourage fan works and integrating them into official sites. When not hosting the fan fiction or being openly tolerant of existing fan sites, companies created partnerships with other companies like FanLib to aid them in the task. The reaction from fans to such alliances and interference in their activities has been mixed, with some people thinking that it violates the basic rules of fan fiction communities. Those fans seem to be increasingly in the minority, as acceptance of such interference is tolerated because of the positives that can result. The attitude of copyright holders toward incorporating fan fiction into the canon varies. Some copyright holders, such as the BBC in the case of Doctor Who, have mechanisms to allow for unsolicited submissions of stories into the official canon, and it is also the case that the writers of canon stories have sometimes been recruited from the ranks of fan fiction writers. In the case of the Doctor Who novels published by Virgin Books, once the BBC reclaimed the license to publish novels regarding the Doctor, many readers immediately categorized all the Virgin New Adventures as non-canonical fan fiction. Legal issues with fan fiction outside the United States In Great Britain, Discworld author Terry Pratchett, up until the point of his death in 2015, emphasized that he was careful not to read fanfics, and had voiced the opinion that \\"everything works if people are sensible\\" and didn't mind \\"so long as people don't put it where I can trip over it\\". However, Pratchett emphasized that the Discworld and all its characters are ultimately his intellectual property, and stressed that \\"it is not a franchise\\". Neil Gaiman, another English author who has written such works as Stardust, Coraline, and American Gods, says he does not mind fan fiction as long as the author notes that the characters are the intellectual property of another and so long as the fiction is not for profit. In addition, fanfiction may be legal in the UK following passage into law of an exception to copyright for the purpose of caricature, parody, or pastiche. In countries such as Russia and China, where copyright laws are more lenient or less well enforced, it is not uncommon to see fan fiction based on the work of popular authors published in book form. Sergey Lukyanenko, a popular science fiction author, went as far as to incorporate some fan fiction based on his stories into official canon (with permission of the writers of the said fan fiction). Perhaps the most famous case, however, is Dmitri Yemets' Tanya Grotter book series, a \\"cultural response\\" to Harry Potter, which provoked a lawsuit from J. K. Rowling. In Japan, the d≈çjinshi subculture is similar to a combination of the United States subcultures surrounding underground comics, science fiction fanzines, and fan fiction. The d≈çjinshi artists rarely secure the permission of the original creator. Many d≈çjinshi works are manga-format fan fiction, which in Japan is, while not strictly legal, generally tolerated and usually encouraged, being looked upon as a form of free advertising or a breeding ground for new talent, most famously the group CLAMP and Love Hina author Ken Akamatsu.

Over 400,000 visitors attend the fairs each year. Prior to 2016, the fair ran Wednesday through Saturday, generally the third weekend in July. Beginning in 2016, the days shifted to Thursday through Sunday. There'll be no event in 2020 as the COVID-19 pandemic was to blame; those will return in 2021. The four official fairs are The Ann Arbor Street Art Fair, the Original; the State Street Art Fair; the Ann Arbor Summer Art Fair; and Ann Arbor's South University Art Fair.\\"Official Event Guide\\" 2011 Ann Arbor Art Fair Guide In addition to art exhibits, the fairs feature music performances, demonstrations and interactive art activities. The fairs =Ann Arbor Street Art Fair, The Original= The oldest of the four, the Ann Arbor Street Art Fair, The Original, was established in 1960 by a collaboration between the South University Businessmen's Association, Ann Arbor Art Association, and the Chamber of Commerce. Originally the Art Association did not believe artist would want their work to be displayed in the street stating, ‚ÄúNo good artist will sit in the street.‚Äù That proved not to be true. The first fair attracted only 132 artists, 99 of them being local, by the third annual fair there were 220 artists. It was the first fair to jury an outdoor show in 1965 and in 2000 was a partner organization involved in the creation of the online jurying system Zapplication, now in use by hundreds of fairs across the country. The fair has initiated events like the Townie Street Party, a free kick off event taking place the Monday before the start of the fairs and gives the community a chance to celebrate the art fairs before the crowds come to town. The Dart for Art is a timed one-mile race featuring competitive elite runners followed by a community race and held in conjunction with the Townie Street Party. Other programs like the Youth Art Fair give young artists the opportunity to exhibit and sell their work. The New Art, New Artist Program allows university students to experience what it's like to fully participate as an artist in the Street Art Fair. The Fountain Stage presents music and dance by local community groups and professionals. The Original Street Art Fair has won many awards over the years, including the Governors Award (State of Michigan), several Reader's Choice Awards (Ann Arbor News, Ann Arbor Current), a Gold Pinnacle Award (International Festivals and Events Association), and was named one of the Top Ten Art Fairs in the Country in a USAToday Readers Poll. The Original Fair continues to rank as one of the top fairs in industry publications like Art Fair Source Book, Sunshine Arts Magazine, and ArtFairCalendar.com.In 2003, the Ann Arbor Street Art Fair, the Original relocated to North University, East Washington and the University of Michigan's Ingall's Mall; surrounding the landmark Burton Memorial Tower. The new location on the University of Michigan's Central Campus is set amidst elegant architecture, landscaped pedestrian walkways, and the striking Carl Miles fountain Sunday Morning in Deep Waters. =Ann Arbor State Street Art Fair= In 1967, the merchants in the State Street District decided they would follow the Street Art Fair and have an art fair in their neighborhood. At the time, the State Street Area Association used its own resources and personnel to run the fair. This operation continues today. For over 50 years, the local neighborhood has welcomed artists from all over the world. Many of whom have become just as much a member of the neighborhood as the businesses, museums, and churches themselves. The State Street Art Fair is the premier event for the State Street District and functions as a major part of the economic stability of the neighborhood. The State Street Art Fair still has its own eclectic feel as many of the local businesses come out into the street and are side-by-side artisans of all types. Artisans apply and are viewed through a jury process. Those that are invited to attend the fair then work directly with District staff to prepare for the event. Many of the State Street artisans return to the fair each year and have grown long-standing local customers that visit every year. The retail businesses continue to use the space in front of their stores to offer their summer sidewalk sales to visitors. For many visitors it has become an opportunity to shop many of the local stores that are often filled with University of Michigan students and visitors at other times of the year. The local restaurants offer the opportunity to sit down and cool off inside the restaurant or outside on the patio in the middle of all of the excitement. Guests can enjoy amazing food as they take a break from walking and shopping. New in 2019, the Ann Arbor State Street Hand-Crafted Marketplace is being to run concurrently with the State Street Fine Art Fair. It will offer artists, artisans and craftspersons an opportunity to showcase, build awareness and value for handmade goods as an alternative to mass-produced items. The next year, however, saw the event get cancelled. The fun and excitement happens every year beginning on the third Thursday of July. Those who would like to be a part of the State Street Art Fair, artists applications are open in October of every year and close in February. All of the information they need about the fair and the District can be found at StateStreetDistrict.org. =Ann Arbor Summer Art Fair= The Ann Arbor Summer Art Fair takes place in two locations, State Street from Madison to William, and along Main Street and Liberty to Fifth Avenue. Produced by The Guild of Artists & Artisans, a non-profit artist membership organization whose mission is to provide artists with marketing opportunities, it features 375 jury selected artists. It all began in the spring of 1970, about ten years following the premiere of the original Ann Arbor Street Fair. A group of young artists from Ann Arbor began working on a separate art fair which would give emerging artists, craftspeople and art students a chance to ‚Äútake to the streets.‚Äù Calling it the Free Arts Festival, they set up this ‚Äúfree fair‚Äù on the University of Michigan's ‚ÄúDiag‚Äù on Central Campus. Funding and management for this new fair was provided by the participating artists themselves. As these young artists matured so did the Free Arts Festival, which became an official member of the Ann Arbor Art Fair and in the mid-70s was renamed the Ann Arbor Summer Art Fair. At the same time, this group of the emerging artists realized both the need for and the potential of an artist membership organization and established The Guild out of the loose-knit organization which had form to support the ‚Äúfree fair.‚Äù Today The Guild of Artists & Artisans is recognized as one of the largest membership organizations of professional artists in North America. Members of the organization continue to provide leadership for all Guild fairs and programs.\\"The 42nd Annual Ann Arbor Summer Art Fair.\\" The Guild of Artists & Artisans. 8 August 2011. http://theguild.org/art-fairs/ann-arbor-art-fair/ =Ann Arbor South University Art Fair= The Ann Arbor South University Art Fair is nationally recognized as a fine arts and crafts fair. Unofficial Fairs Over the years, several unofficial, for-profit art fairs have piggybacked onto the Ann Arbor Art Fairs in an attempt to capitalize on its large attendance. One such fair is operated downtown in a privately owned parking lot off Liberty Street, directly adjacent to the State Street Area Art Fair. In 2009, another for- profit art fair, Ann Arbor Art Fair at Briarwood, began in the parking lot of Briarwood Mall, a staging area for shuttle buses that travel to and from downtown Ann Arbor during the Ann Arbor Art Fairs. The art found at these fairs is generally priced lower than that found at the official Ann Arbor Art Fairs. This may be attributed to the lower booth fees charged by the shows' directors and the relatively lower experience level of the artists who exhibit here. Art Fair Food The usual fair food is offered such as French fries, cotton candy, funnel fries, caramel apples and fried Twinkies. However certain vendors also offer a variety of specialized cuisine from restaurants across the city. \\"Food Floozie\\" 28 July 2010 http://foodfloozie.blogspot.com/2010/07/wordless-wednesday-ann-arbor-art- fair.html Protest from residents Given the traffic disruption and the inconvenience of having a large number of visitors come in for the week, many Ann Arbor residents dislike the fairs and have protested against them, rallying under the slogan of \\"It's not art, and it's not fair.\\"Richard Wiggins. \\"Please Swipe my Credit Card.\\" Internet Outlook 20 July 1997.

The Marshall Mission (; 20 December 1945 ‚Äì January 1947) was a failed diplomatic mission undertaken by United States Army General George C. Marshall to China in an attempt to negotiate between the Communist Party of China and the Nationalists (Kuomintang) to create a unified Chinese government. Historical background Committee of Three, from left, Nationalist representative Zhang Qun, George C. Marshall and Communist representative Zhou Enlai. Throughout the length of the Second Sino-Japanese War an uneasy stalemate had existed between the Chinese Communists (CCP) and the Chinese Nationalists (KMT), while prior to the war, both parties had been in open conflict with each other. During this period numerous US military personnel and private writers visited and reported on the Communist Part of China. In 1936, international journalist Edgar Snow traveled and interviewed leading members of the Communist Party of China. Snow reported that Mao was a reformer rather than a radical revolutionary,Brady p. 47. and many readers got the impression that the Chinese communists were \\"agrarian reformers.\\"Kenneth E. Shewmaker, \\"The \\"Agrarian Reformer\\" Myth,\\" The China Quarterly 34 (1968): 66-81. In the 1944 Dixie Mission, US Colonel John Service visited the Communists and praised them, claimed that they were democratic reformers, likening them to European socialists rather than Soviet Communists and claimed that they were less corrupt and chaotic than the Nationalists.John Service, Report No. 5, 8 March 1944, to Commanding General Fwd.

General Patrick Hurley claimed that the Chinese Communists were not real communists. China Burma India Theater Commander Joseph Stilwell repeatedly claimed (in contradiction to Comintern statistics) that Communists were doing more than the KMT, and sought to cut off all US aid to China.Wesley Marvin Bagby, The Eagle-Dragon Alliance: America's Relations with China in World War II, p.96 American attempts during the Second World War to end the intermittent Chinese Civil War between the two factions had failed, notably the Hurley Mission: in 1944 General Patrick Hurley approached both groups, and believed that their differences were comparable to the Republicans and Democrats in the United States.Russel D. Buhite, Patrick J. Hurley and American Foreign Policy (Ithaca, NY: Cornell U Press, 1973), 160 ‚Äì 162. Throughout the war, both the CCP and the KMT had accused the other of withholding men and arms against the Japanese in preparation for offensive actions against the other. Thus, in a desperate attempt to keep the country whole, President Harry S Truman in late 1945 sent General George Marshall as his special presidential envoy to China to negotiate a unity government. Marshall arrives in China Marshall arrived in China on 20 December 1945. His goal was to unify the Nationalists and Communists with the hope that a strong, non-Communist China, would act as a bulwark against the encroachment of the Soviet Union. Immediately, Marshall drew both sides into negotiations which would occur for more than a year. No significant agreements were reached, as both sides used the time to further prepare themselves for the ensuing conflict. In order to assist in brokering a ceasefire between the Nationalists and Communists, the sale of weapons and ammunition by the US to the Nationalists were suspended between 29 July 1946 to May 1947. Finally, in January 1947, exasperated with the failure of the negotiations, Marshall left China. Soon afterward, Marshall was appointed United States Secretary of State (foreign affairs secretary). Aftermath The failure of the Marshall Mission signaled the renewal of the Chinese Civil War. George Marshall returned to the United States, became United States Secretary of State, and committed himself to the revitalization of Europe with the Marshall Plan, which was, to some considered a great success. However, primarily due to the policies of the Democratic regime of President Roosevelt, a similar scenario had already played out in Europe that will play out in Asia. The Marshall Plan did not involve countries like Poland, Lithuania, Latvia, Estonia, Czechoslovakia, Hungary, Romania, Bulgaria, Yugoslavia because all had been permitted by Roosevelt and Truman to be, or eventually be, engulfed by the USSR. This is not including attempts by the USSR to engulf Greece, Italy and parts of Denmark and Norway or their attempts in Turkey and their success in setting up what amounted to a puppet regime in Finland.A map of the world by 1973 By 1949, the Kuomintang was driven from the Chinese mainland to Taiwan and the Communists established the People's Republic of China. Attack by McCarthy On 9 June 1951, Douglas MacArthur charged that the post-war Marshall mission to China committed \\"one of the greatest blunders in American diplomatic history, for which the free world is now paying in blood and disaster....\\" in a telegram to Senator William F. Knowland. On 14 June 1951, as the Korean War stalemated in heavy fighting between American and Chinese forces, Republican Senator Joseph McCarthy attacked. He stated that Marshall was directly responsible for the \\"loss of China,\\" as China turned from friend to enemy.The speech was published as a 169-page book, America's Retreat from Victory: The Story of George Catlett Marshall (1951). McCarthy said the only way to explain why the US \\"fell from our position as the most powerful Nation on earth at the end of World War II to a position of declared weakness by our leadership\\" was because of \\"a conspiracy so immense and an infamy so black as to dwarf any previous such venture in the history of man.\\"Joseph McCarthy, Major Speeches and Debates (1951) p. 215 McCarthy argued that General Albert Coady Wedemeyer had prepared a wise plan that would keep China a valued ally but that it had been sabotaged; \\"only in treason can we find why evil genius thwarted and frustrated it.\\" McCarthy, Major Speeches and Debates (1951) pp. 264. Specifically, McCarthy alleged: > \\"When Marshall was sent to China with secret State Department orders, the > Communists at that time were bottled up in two areas and were fighting a > losing battle, but that because of those orders the situation was radically > changed in favor of the Communists. Under those orders, as we know, Marshall > embargoed all arms and ammunition to our allies in China. He forced the > opening of the Nationalist-held Kalgan Mountain pass into Manchuria, to the > end that the Chinese Communists gained access to the mountains of captured > Japanese equipment. No need to tell the country about how Marshall tried to > force Chiang Kai-shek to form a partnership government with the > Communists.\\"McCarthy, Major Speeches p. 191, from speech of March 14, 1951; > see also Thomas C. Reeves, The Life and Times of Joe McCarthy (1982) pp > 371-74. Public opinion on Marshall's record became bitterly divided along party lines. In 1952, Dwight Eisenhower, while campaigning successfully for US President, denounced the Truman administration's failures in Korea, campaigned alongside McCarthy, and refused to defend Marshall's policies.Reeves, McCarthy 437-8 See also * China White Paper, U.S. State Department defense of its actions issued in 1949 * Dixie Mission * China Burma India Theater, against Japan * Red Star Over China * Wartime perception of the Chinese Communists Notes Further reading * Brazinsky, Gregg. \\"The Birth of a Rivalry: Sino‚ÄêAmerican Relations during the Truman Administration\\" in Daniel S.

In this world a magic-based technology has developed in place of the science of our own world.

The museum's exhibits feature art inspired by Mackinac Island, including historic painting and maps, photographs from the mid-19th to the mid-20th century, Native American art and beaded garments, and contemporary art and photography from area artists. The museum is one of many attractions in Mackinac Island State Park. History The Indian Dormitory is a Federal-style structure built at U.S. government expense on Mackinac Island, Michigan, in 1838. It was a pioneering idea in building housing for Native Americans visiting the Indian agency on the island. From 1867 until 1960, it was used as a public school, and from 1966 until 2003 as a museum of Native American culture. On July 2, 2010, it opened as the Richard and Jane Manoogian Mackinac Art Museum, operated by Mackinac State Historic Parks. The building is listed on the National Register of Historic Places. =Henry Schoolcraft, Indian Agent= The Indian Dormitory is a surviving fragment of the assimilationist vision of Henry Schoolcraft, the U.S. government official supervising Native American affairs and based at Mackinac Island. Schoolcraft noticed in the early 19th century that the culture of most Native Americans centered on the hunting and gathering of food, activities which were less productive in terms of food production than agriculture. Schoolcraft believed that Native Americans could be persuaded to cede much of their hunting lands to the U.S. federal government, and that the government could reinvest some of the proceeds to be earned from reselling these lands to teach farming techniques to the \\"Indians.\\" Other income from land sales could be used to support Native American families during the transitional period. As the Indian Agent in Sault Ste. Marie, Michigan, and later on Mackinac Island, Schoolcraft had seen that many of the Native Americans who traveled by foot or canoe to visit his agency were limited by necessity to portable, temporary shelters they could easily build. These did not seem adequate from the European-American point of view. =Treaty of Washington, 1836= As the Mackinac Island Indian Agent, Schoolcraft was able to persuade many Native Americans of Michigan Territory, especially members of the Ojibwa and Ottawa tribes, to sell most of the northern Lower Peninsula and eastern Upper Peninsula of Michigan to the federal government. The exchange was sealed in the 1836 Treaty of Washington. In exchange for the vast tract of land sold, the federal government promised to pay an annuity to affected Native Americans, provide training in farming and allied crafts, such as blacksmithing, and build a dormitory structure on Mackinac Island to which recognized Native Americans with tribal standing could come for shelter when doing business on Mackinac Island with the Indian Agency. In fulfillment of this promise, the Indian Dormitory was built in 1838. =Island schoolhouse= After the expiration of the annuity schedule laid out in the 1836 treaty, Native Americans stopped coming to Mackinac Island in large numbers. The Indian Dormitory ceased to be of service in its original function. In 1867, the building was adapted as a public school for the children of Mackinac Island of all ethnic groups. Serving as a schoolhouse from 1867‚Äì1960, the Thomas W. Ferry School provided classroom space to one of the most ethnically diverse populations in Michigan. By 1960, the wooden building could not meet the standards of school safety required by law. The school building, with its Schoolcraft heritage, had long been surrounded by Mackinac Island State Park property, and in 1963 it was purchased by the Park Commission. =Building restoration= Although Henry R. Schoolcraft's role in American frontier history could be criticized by a later generation as racist, Schoolcraft had a strong interest in the Ojibwa religion, mythology, and culture. Schoolcraft energetically collected local Ojibwa stories and tales, many of which his mixed-race wife Jane Johnston Schoolcraft told him or translated for him. All of his books were published under his name, with little credit to her or her family. The Massachusetts poet Henry Wadsworth Longfellow studied the Schoolcraft couple's works for themes and inspiration for his epic poem, The Song of Hiawatha. To Americans of European ancestry, this Romantic poem and its title character were authentic windows into the spiritual life of the \\"American Indian.\\" In homage to this poem and its sentimental view of Ojibwa culture, in 1964-1965 the Mackinac Island State Park renovated the interior of the Indian Dormitory to serve as a museum of Native American culture and Hiawatha imagery. The exterior was restored to its original 1838 appearance, and the structure was opened to the public in 1966. Mackinac Island Art Museum From 1966 until 2003, the Indian Dormitory served as a museum featuring period settings depicting its service as the Indian Dormitory (1838‚Äì1846) on its lower levels, and offering an exhibit of Great Lakes Native American culture on the top floor. By the end of this period, the Hiawatha theme was reinterpreted as a classic example of cultural appropriation and, thus, was viewed as no longer appropriate for public use. Schoolcraft and Longfellow had synchretically mashed together images, names, and narratives from different Native American peoples and nations. In 2000 the second-floor exhibit space was closed, and in 2003 the State Park temporarily closed the structure. After a study of its future use, the State Park announced plans in late 2008 to refit and reopen the Indian Dormitory as a museum featuring Straits of Mackinac art and culture. The interior was extensively rebuilt in 2008-2010 to add climate controls suitable for archival preservation of the collection on display. The museum opened on July 2, 2010 as the Richard and Jane Manoogian Mackinac Art Museum. The Indian Dormitory has been named to the National Register of Historic Places, and is a contributing property to Mackinac Island's overall status as a National Historic Landmark..

Roncalli is now on the site, and most of the buildings are remnants from the days of the single sex schools. St Patrick's was the local high school for Catholic boys, run by the Marist order, and Mercy College was the local Catholic school for girls, run by the Mercy sisters, from their convent, which was situated on what is now the rugby field also known as the thunder dome. The schools were separated by the \\"Iron Curtain\\" or \\"Brown Curtain\\", a corrugated iron fence which ran the length of the boundary between the two schools, which kept the boys and girls separated. The penalties for being on the wrong side of the fence were rather severe, any boy caught on the wrong side of the fence without a valid reason was invariably caned. In the last days of St Pats and Mercy, the pupils from St Pats were instructed by the Rector to tear down the fence as a prelude to amalgamation.

Dryandroideae is a taxonomic series in the plant genus Banksia. First published by Carl Meissner in 1856, the name has had two circumscriptions. As presently circumscribed it is monotypic, containing only B. dryandroides. According to Meissner B. ser. Dryandroideae was first published in 1856, in Carl Meissner's chapter on the Proteaceae in A. P. de Candolle's Prodromus systematis naturalis regni vegetabilis. It was one of four series into which the subgenus Eubanksia was divided. These four series were defined in terms of leaf characters, with series Dryandroideae containing the species with leaves divided into lobels. As they were defined on leaf characters alone, all of Meissner's series were highly heterogeneous. The placement and circumscription of B. ser. Dryandroideae in Meissner's arrangement may be summarised as follows: :Banksia ::B. sect. Eubanksia :::B. ser. Abietinae (8 species, 1 variety) :::B. ser. Salicinae (23 species, 8 varieties) :::B. ser. Quercinae (18 species, 2 varieties) :::B. ser. Dryandroideae ::::B. grandis ::::B. Baxteri ::::B. speciosa ::::B. Victori√¶ ::::B. elegans ::::B. Candolleana ::::B. dryandroides ::::B. Brownii ::B. sect. Isostylis (1 species) Meissner's arrangement was current until 1870, when George Bentham published his arrangement, discarding all four of Meissner's series. According to George In 1981, Alex George published a thorough revision of Banksia in his classic monograph The genus Banksia L.f. (Proteaceae). Though he did not accept Meissner's definition of B. ser. Dryandroideae, he felt that \\"Banksia dryandroides appears to provide a link between the Spicigerae and the Abietinae but is sufficiently distinct from both to be placed in its own series.\\" He therefore resurrected B. ser. Dryandroideae as a monotypic series containing B. dryandroideae alone, placing it in Bentham's B. sect. Oncostylis, which was defined as containing the species with hooked styles. Since Meissner had not designated a type species for the series, George also declared B. dryandroides to lectotype. The placement and circumscription of B. ser. Dryandroideae in George's taxonomic arrangement of Banksia may be summarised as follows: :Banksia ::B. subg. Banksia :::B. sect. Banksia (9 series, 50 species, 9 subspecies, 3 varieties) :::B. sect. Coccinea (1 species) :::B. sect. Oncostylis ::::B. ser. Spicigerae (7 species, 2 subspecies, 4 varieties) ::::B. ser. Tricuspidae (1 species) ::::B. ser. Dryandroideae :::::B. dryandroides ::::B. ser. Abietinae (13 species, 2 subspecies, 9 varieties) ::B. subg. Isostylis (3 species) In 1996, Kevin Thiele and Pauline Ladiges published a new arrangement of Banksia, after cladistic analyses yielded a cladogram significantly different from George's arrangement. George's sections were discarded, but many of his series were retained. Thiele and Ladiges found B. dryandroides to be sister (that is, the next closest relative) to a clade containing B. ser. Abietinae and B. tricuspis (Lesueur Banksia). Since this placement was consistent with the placement of B. dryandroides alone in a series, and on the stated principle that \\"[n]omenclatural changes from the currently accepted classification are minimised\\", Thiele and Ladiges retained George's circumscription of B. ser. Dryandroideae as containing only B. dryandroides. The placement and circumscription of B. ser. Dryandroideae in Thiele and Ladiges' arrangement may be summarised as follows: :Banksia ::B. subg. Isostylis (3 species) ::B. elegans (incertae sedis) ::B. subg. Banksia :::B. ser. Tetragonae (4 species) :::B. ser. Lindleyanae (1 species) :::B. ser. Banksia (2 subseries, 12 species) :::B. baueri (incertae sedis) :::B. lullfitzii (incertae sedis) :::B. attenuata (incertae sedis) :::B. ashbyi (incertae sedis) :::B. coccinea (incertae sedis) :::B. ser. Prostratae (8 species) :::B. ser. Cyrtostylis (4 species) :::B. ser. Ochraceae (3 species, 2 subspecies) :::B. ser. Grandes (2 species) :::B. ser. Salicinae (2 subseries, 11 species, 4 subspecies) :::B. ser. Spicigerae (3 subseries, 7 species, 6 varieties) :::B. ser. Quercinae (2 species) :::B. ser. Dryandroideae ::::B. dryandroides :::B. ser. Abietinae (4 subseries, 15 species, 8 varieties) Thiele and Ladiges' arrangement remained current only until 1999, when George's treatment of the genus for the Flora of Australia series of monographs was published. This was essentially a revision of George's 1981 arrangement, which took into account some of Thiele and Ladiges' data, but rejected their overall arrangement. With respect to B. ser. Dryandroideae, George's 1999 arrangement is no different from that of 1981. Recent developments Since 1998, Austin Mast has been publishing results of ongoing cladistic analyses of DNA sequence data for the subtribe Banksiinae. His analyses suggest a phylogeny that is very greatly different from George's taxonomic arrangement, though it is not yet clear how these findings will impace B. ser. Dryandroideae. Early in 2007 Mast and Thiele initiated a rearrangement of Banksia by transferring Dryandra into it, and publishing B. subg. Spathulatae for the species having spoon-shaped cotyledons. B. dryandroides falls within B. subg. Spathulatae, but no further details have been proffered. Mast and Thiele have foreshadowed publishing a full arrangement once DNA sampling of Dryandra is complete. References External links * ser.

Cow from Hell is an independent, low-budget comedy film directed by Robert C. Hughes. The film was released in 1989 and shown in select theaters, mostly located in eastern Iowa. In a two night theatrical run, the film grossed over $25,000. It also premiered at the Sundance Film Festival. The film was written by and cast with members of the Duck's Breath Mystery Theater, a comic acting troupe. The idea was originally introduced Merle Kessler, who was inspired by \\"Zarda\\", a dairy in Kansas City, that had a statue of a giant cow. The film was shot in and around Iowa City, Tipton, Solon and Mount Vernon, Iowa. The plot of the movie revolves around a struggling Hollywood director who wished to return to his home state of Iowa and create a successful horror film. However, upon arriving in Iowa, the young director (played by Merle Kessler) is immediately distracted by old friends and family, a problem which will plague him throughout the making of his film, Zadar! Cow from Hell. One of the film locations was shot in a beautiful Victorian home at 203 S Iowa St. in Solon, IA. It was home to the Lundquist family at the time the father David was Mayor of the town. He lived there with his wife Leslie & three boys Michael, Adam and Daniel (who had a brief appearance in the film) they had a great time with much the film crew plus actors camping in their yard. For them it was like Hollywood coming to a very small town. It was very exciting at the time for all in the town. The film within a film is sprinkled with bits of humor, usually consisting of short one-liners. However, the film's defining moment comes when the individuals meant to be playing cows realize that they cannot remove the plastic horns from their heads. This causes chaos and frustration, and is later linked with the demise of the project. Zadar! Cow from Hell was eventually released on VHS and DVD, although not through a major distribution network. The film also gained attention from outside the movie-going community, eventually even having a meal named after it at the Hamburg Inn No. 2, a local diner. There, the \\"Zadar\\" omelette consists of two eggs, ground beef, cheese, and homefries. There is also a reference to the movie in the role-playing video game Neverwinter Nights, in which a cheat that summons killer cows is entered by typing \\"dm_cowsfromhell\\".

The site, which is listed on the National Register of Historic Places, is made up of several 19th century cabins built by Cornish immigrants who came to Mineral Point to mine lead. Today the site is owned by the Wisconsin Historical Society and serves as a museum of Wisconsin's early lead mining history. Programs at the site also interpret the groundbreaking preservation work by Robert Neal and Edgar Hellum, begun during the Great Depression. History During the 1830s and 1840s, the area that today comprises southwest Wisconsin and northwest Illinois was rapidly populated as miners came from across the United States and Europe to work the region's abundant lead deposits. Several mining boomtowns sprang up in the region, including Galena, Illinois; Platteville, Wisconsin; and Mineral Point, the location of Pendarvis. During the height of the mining era, the population of Mineral Point rose to over 4,000 as people migrated to the city to work in the lead mines. Many of the immigrants who came to Mineral Point were tin miners from Cornwall, at the southwestern tip of Great Britain. Many of the Cornish immigrants built simple houses in the town using wood or limestone taken from the local landscape. As time went on, however, the lead mines were exhausted and many of the miners moved on to other mining sites, especially California following the discovery of gold at Sutter's Mill in 1848. Other miners stayed in the area to mine zinc, which was also abundant, but by the early 20th century the zinc mines were also being abandoned. Preservation In the 1920s and 1930s, many of the old cabins built by the Cornish miners were being torn down. Seeing this, a local resident named Robert Neal, together with Edgar Hellum, began to acquire and restore several of the old Cornish buildings. Neal and Hellum also gave Cornish-language names to each of the buildings they restored. They called their first project, a 1-story stone cabin, Pendarvis. In order to support the restoration of other buildings, Pendarvis House was turned into a restaurant serving authentic Cornish dishes such as Cornish pasty. The Pendarvis House Restaurant received wide acclaim, and helped finance Neal and Hellum's restoration of even more historic Cornish homes in Mineral Point. Pendarvis House (left) and Trelawny House (right) Following the restoration, the Pendarvis historic site included six cabins built by English and Cornish miners during the 1840s and 1850s. The Pendarvis house itself was built of locally quarried limestone and has walls that are 18 to 20 inches thick. Beside the Pendarvis house is the Trelawny, a 2-story cottage of similar construction. Nearby is Polperro, a -story house using stone for its first story and wood for its upper floors. Another Pendarvis building is the Rowhouse, which consists of three adjacent stone structures. The first house in the row was built as a free-standing building circa 1841. The second house was also built as a free-standing building circa 1844 or 1845. The final house, built between the other two houses and connecting to them, was built circa 1852. Historic site The collection of buildings restored by Neal and Hellum was transferred to the Wisconsin Historical Society in 1970. A year later, they were opened to the public as the Pendarvis Historic Site. In addition to the cottages, the Wisconsin Historical Society acquired several acres of land on nearby Merry Christmas Mine Hill, the site of a historic zinc mine. Remnants of the mining activity are still visible, but much of the hill has been restored to natural prairie. Visitors to the site can explore the hill on a number of foot trails. The historic buildings are shown to the visiting public seasonally as a museum preserving the history of the region's mining industry and the lives of the miners who first developed the site. Many artifacts are on display in the buildings, including authentic mining tools and household items.

BUFF is the largest underground film festival in New England, spotlighting short films and feature-length films that would not otherwise find an audience. It was the only film festival in the world to give an award for \\"Most Effectively Offensive\\" films, an accolade it awarded from its inception until 2017; on the festival's twentieth anniversary, the award was retired and replaced with \\"Best First Feature Film,\\" marking a shifting focus towards celebrating new voices in filmmaking. Despite the festival's title, BUFF has not taken place in Boston proper since 2003. The 2004 festival was held mainly in Arlington, Massachusetts. In 2005, BUFF was held entirely in Somerville, Massachusetts. From 2006 on, BUFF has taken place entirely in Cambridge, Massachusetts. Although BUFF, as an organization, has hosted year round programming at various Boston venues (such as Space 242 in the South End, The Savant Project (now defunct) in Mission Hill and the Milky Way Lounge in Jamaica Plain), there seem to be no current plans to hold the festival in the City of Boston. Starting in 2016, the festival expanded operations to include a monthly screening series called Dispatches from the Underground at the Somerville Theatre Microcinema. The series screens \\"the ones that got away,\\" highlighting films that weren't selected for the official festival, as well as occasional repertory titles and guest curated programs from other New England festivals, as well as traveling festivals. BUFF is one of the longest continuously- running underground film festivals in the world, second only to Chicago Underground Film Festival.  Recognition  BUFF was named one of MovieMaker Magazine's \\"Bloody Best Genre Fests in the World\\" in 2019. Following the 2018 festival, BUFF was recognized on Boston Magazine's Best of Boston 2018 list as Best Film Festival and received a special commendation at the Boston Society of Film Critics' 2018 Special Awards. The festival received DigBoston's DIGTHIS! Award in 2014 and 2015 for Best Film Festival.  History  Started in 1998, by film professor/curator David Kleiler, BUFF was an extension of an all night film marathon produced by Kleiler and Dima Ballin. The First Annual Boston Underground Film Festival took place in February 1999 at the now defunct Revolving Museum in South Boston. Described by programmer Bernard Broginart as \\"a wonderful hoax of a film festival,\\"The Harvard Crimson, \\"Cine Manic\\" March 5, 1999 the first BUFF was an extremely informal event. Patrons were encouraged to wander from room to room for a single ticket price in the art gallery converted to a cinema. This format was continued for the 2000 festival. In the years following, BUFF has adopted a more traditional festival format with set screening start times and using actual cinemas and screening rooms. Between 2001 and 2004, BUFF had expanded and contracted with no central location or venue and no set duration. The festival took place during the month of February from 1999 to 2002. In 2003, it was moved to October; then to May in 2004. During this period, numerous venues housed BUFF screenings, including the Milky Way Lounge in Jamaica Plain, The Allston Cinema Underground (now defunct), The Arlington Regent Theatre, and the Brattle Theatre. By 2005, BUFF was under new management, with Anna Feder and Kevin Monahan taking over as co-managing directors and bringing on Bryan McKay as graphic designer. David Kleiler retained Executive Director duties this year. One of Feder and Monahan's first actions was to feature the Bacchus bunny front and center by using McKay's striking designs. They also centralized operations during this year, with all screenings taking place at the Somerville Theatre in Davis Square. In 2006 they made Harvard Square BUFF's new home, using the Brattle Theatre as the primary venue. The Brattle also hosted the festival in 2007 and 2008. Kleiler stepped down as Executive Director after the 2006 festival. According to BUFF's website, the 2009 festival was held at the Kendall Square Cinema and the Brattle Theatre, both in Cambridge. The 2010 and 2011 festivals were held exclusively at the Kendall Square Cinema. Anna Feder stepped down as Director after the 2011 festival. As of the 2012 festival, Kevin Monahan and Nicole McControversy stepped up into dual festival director roles as Artistic Director and Director of Programming, respectively, and restructured the festival as an officially registered LLC. The festival's graphic designer, Bryan McKay, was promoted to Media Director in 2012. BUFF's core staff is currently: Artistic Director ‚Äì Kevin Monahan, Director of Programming ‚Äì Nicole McControversy, Media Director ‚Äì Bryan McKay. BUFF is organized by an entirely unpaid, volunteer group of dedicated film fans. In 2012, BUFF moved back to the Brattle Theatre where it has remained the festival's primary screening venue. The festival also used the Harvard Film Archive as a secondary venue from 2016 to present.  The Bacchus Awards  Rather than giving cash or trade value prizes for awards, BUFF doles out a trophy in the shape of a demonic black bunny with red eyes; various iterations of the award also had a vibrating feature. The Bacchus Award was incorporated into BUFF in its second year and has since become the official mascot of the festival, a focal point in poster/logo design, and the rationale behind the festival's red/black/white color scheme. \\"And the bunny goes to...\\" is the much-anticipated phrase at the award ceremony that closes the festival. A new version of Bacchus, clad in white briefs and clutching a liquor bottle was unveiled for the 2008 festival and designed by Casey A. Riley. Riley designed an updated version of the award in 2009, featuring a slightly svelter Bacchus wearing a pink bunny suit, clutching a liquor bottle and exhibiting a raised middle-finger. This version of the Bacchus Award remained in use through 2017. As of 2018, a new Bacchus was designed in celebration of the festival's twentieth anniversary. Designed by Jason Rosen of Skinwalker Studios, the latest version of Bacchus is entirely ebony and emphasizes more demonic and occult-suggestive traits. = Awards Categories = Audience Choice Award: Best of Fest Short, Best of Fest Feature Best First Feature (as of 2018) Director's Choice (BUFF organizers): Best Short, Best Feature Retired: Most Effectively Offensive Award Occasionally awards for Lifetime Achievement and Best New England Film are selected as well.

Created and introduced by William J. Bell, he was born onscreen in 1988 as the second child of supercouple characters Victor and Nikki Newman. Portrayed by a set of twins and later two child actors for his first six-year period, the writers of the series decided to rapidly age the character to a teenager in the summer of 1994. That June, Joshua Morrow began portraying Nick, and has remained in the role to present time. The character was reintroduced with the purpose of developing a relationship with another character, Sharon Collins, who was introduced around the same story arc. The pairing, which yielded three children, Cassie, Noah and Faith Newman, proved popular with viewers. They are regarded as a prominent supercouple by the soap opera media. In 2005, the character underwent a dramatic change in storyline when the role of Nick and Sharon's fourteen-year-old daughter Cassie was killed off after a car accident. This led Nick to seek comfort in the arms of another woman, Phyllis Summers, which resulted in an affair. Phyllis became pregnant with Nick's child, Summer Newman. Nick divorced Sharon and married Phyllis the following year. For years, however, Nick battled between his ongoing feelings with Sharon and Phyllis. His other storylines have included trying to seek independence away from his powerful father as well as multiple other relationships. In 2013, a storyline regarding Summer's paternity was visited, centered on speculation that she is actually the daughter of Jack Abbott, Phyllis' ex-husband. Morrow regards Nick as a \\"good dude\\" who has a \\"fiery\\" protective personality, which has developed into a \\"more mature\\" persona as the character grew. Nick and Morrow gained a significant amount of crazed fan attention and popularity during the late 1990s, considered a long- time fan favorite by TV Guide. The pairing of Nick and Sharon has been met with notable success, listed as one of the genre's best supercouples by The Huffington Post and SoapNet, among other sources. Morrow's performance has been met with critical acclaim, having garnered him the Daytime Emmy Award for Outstanding Younger Actor in a Drama Series nomination consecutively from 1996 to 2000. Casting and creation Created and introduced by William J. Bell, the role of Nicholas Newman was born onscreen during the episode dated December 31, 1988. The character was portrayed by infant twins Marco and Stefan Flores in 1989, while child actor Griffin Ledner took over the following year, departing in January 1991. Child actor John Alden played the role of Nick from 1991 to 1994. On June 21, 1994, the producers of the series decided to rapidly age Nick to a teenager; ending speculation that another teenage child of Victor Newman (Eric Braeden) would be introduced to the soap opera. The character's return as a teenager was written as him returning from boarding school after a long duration. Since then, the role has been portrayed by actor Joshua Morrow. Morrow had previously auditioned for the role of \\"Dylan\\" on another CBS soap opera The Bold and the Beautiful, making it to the final two casting options, but lost the role to Dylan Neal. The network later requested him to read for the part of Nick, which he won. Morrow, who worked in a restaurant prior to debuting on The Young and the Restless, considered his change in profession a \\"quantum leap in careers\\". He said that accepting the role was \\"a very easy decision\\" considering how popular the show was. The Record newspaper described the role as being \\"tailor-made\\" for Morrow. In 2002, Morrow signed a new contract with the soap opera that would ensure his portrayal of the role for an additional five years. His contract was considered \\"record-breaking\\" at the time, as no soap opera contract had exceeded four years prior to this. Upon his contract's expiration in 2007, Morrow agreed to an additional five years with The Young and the Restless. He stated he was \\"happy to know\\" where he was going to be for the next five years, as well as expressing gratitude towards the soap opera for accommodating his living conditions and schedule. Development =Characterization= Nick is described by the soap opera's official website as often thinking \\"with his heart instead of his head\\". When the teenaged version of Nick debuted on the series in 1994, he was characterized as a \\"frisky\\" 16-year-old \\"rich-kid\\", with Morrow being able to \\"kick back and relax in typical teenager attire‚Äîjeans, tees, etc\\". Morrow said \\"Nick's eager and fun-loving ... and that's fun to play\\". Nick also has an \\"eye for the ladies\\". In 1999, Morrow told soap magazine Soap Opera Digest that Nick has a \\"fiery personality\\", and \\"if you attack him, he's going to fight back\\". Morrow has insisted that he is not concerned about viewer backlash towards Nick, having stated: \\"My job is not to be palatable to the audience. I want to tell a convincing story. I have never been a man in love with two women. I can only imagine what that must be like.\\" The actor felt that if he needed to \\"look like an ass and a bad guy\\" to keep people interested in his portrayal, \\"so be it\\". He told Tommy Garrett of Canyon News: \\"I‚Äôd rather be playing an imperfect good guy than a boring one. There is a lot of me in Nick, there is not that big of a stretch for me on a daily basis\\". A controversial storyline occurred in 2011 when alongside his sisters Abby Newman (Marcy Rylan) and Victoria Abbott (Amelia Heinle), Nick sued his father. Morrow felt that Nick wants to teach Victor a lesson, hoping he will \\"appreciate his children more\\". He also stated Nick wants to get respect, as he isn't \\"this young and impressionable boy who looks at his father in this hero light anymore.\\" By the following year, Morrow opined that Nick is now \\"more mature\\" with his decision-making, and that \\"He's got a very practical view of the world, and I like that he's kind of become a steady character on the show\\". He stated that although the part isn't as \\"splashy or flashy\\" as Adam Newman (Michael Muhney), Nick's onscreen brother, he \\"really\\" likes Nick because \\"he's a good dude\\" and a \\"very supportive\\" person. =Nick and Sharon= Joshua Morrow and Sharon Case (pictured in 2013) portray Nick and Sharon. Since 1994, Nick, whose love life according to Morrow is \\"messy and convoluted\\", has been romantically linked to his high-school sweetheart Sharon Collins (Sharon Case). As teenagers, they dream of eloping, and face major hurdles when Sharon's ex-boyfriend Matt Clark (Eddie Cibrian) exposes Sharon's teenaged motherhood (when she gave her baby, fathered by her former boyfriend in Madison, up for adoption). Nick, believing Sharon is a virgin, briefly breaks up with her but they reunite. With Matt behind them, they marry in February 1996 and have their first child‚ÄîNoah (Robert Adamson)‚Äîin 1997, the year Sharon is reunited with her daughter Cassie (Camryn Grimes). Sharon's best friend Grace Turner (Jennifer Gareis) seduces Nick, triggering another breakup; Sharon and Nick reunite during a custody battle for Cassie. Of their highly anticipated reunion, former head writer Kay Alden noted that during the previous several months \\"there's been a lot of stop-and-go\\" and \\"mixed messages\\" between the couple, but their feelings were \\"definitely clear\\" again; Morrow felt that Nick loved Cassie as much as he loves Noah. However, in 2002, Sharon has an affair with Diego Guittierez (Greg Vaughan), causing additional martial struggles for the pair. In May 2005, 14-year-old Cassie is killed in a car accident. Nick becomes distant from Sharon, and cheats on her with Phyllis Summers (Michelle Stafford). The marriage ends the following year; Nick marries a pregnant Phyllis, who gives birth to their daughter, Summer Newman (Hunter King). Despite his marriage to Phyllis, Nick remains in love with Sharon, causing the love triangle between Nick, Sharon and Phyllis to reemerge in 2009. Nick became unable to forget Sharon, who began unraveling in her own life after a recent divorce. Morrow said Sharon \\"seems kind of vulnerable and susceptible to people saying things about her. So, Nick feels he has to protect her.\\" However, this came at the expense of his marriage to Phyllis which began falling apart. In January 2009, Nick and Sharon reunite at the Abbott cabin, an affair \\"much anticipated\\" by viewers. According to Case, Sharon wanted Nick \\"more than anyone\\" but only if he left Phyllis; Morrow told TV Guide that although the reunion was \\"messy\\", fans \\"wanted this for a long time\\", sure that they would become a solid couple again. After another one-night stand Sharon becomes pregnant, briefly lying that Jack Abbott (Peter Bergman)‚ÄîSharon's ex-husband‚Äîis the baby's father when Summer becomes ill and Phyllis needs Nick. Nick soon finds out, but their daughter Faith is kidnapped at birth by Nick's brother, Adam Newman (Michael Muhney), and given to Ashley Abbott (Eileen Davidson). Sharon, believing Faith has died, seduces a guilty Adam. Faith is eventually reunited with her parents, and Adam's crimes are revealed. Nick and Sharon are briefly engaged in November 2010, but they break up when she sleeps with Adam and their relationship becomes bitter. Although Case and Morrow believe the couple won't \\"ever be over\\" and \\"belong together\\", they are not currently together and may not reunite \\"anytime soon\\". =Cassie's death and affair with Phyllis= In 2005, former \\"good-girl\\" Cassie becomes a rebellious teenager; Nick and Sharon have a difficult time dealing with her. Cassie has a crush on bad-boy Daniel Romalotti (Michael Graziadei), who is dating Lily Winters (Christel Khalil). One night, against her parents' wishes she sneaks out to a party. In a ploy to impress a drunken Daniel she attempts to drive him home, despite being underage. The car crashes, leaving them with no memory of the accident. Daniel is thought to have been driving, and is blamed for the accident. A weakened Cassie escapes from the hospital to find Daniel and tell him she was driving; she is returned to the hospital. During the episode dated May 24, Cassie dies with Nick and Sharon at her side. Grimes said she did not think Cassie would die, but if it was \\"meant to happen, it's meant to happen\\". The actress found filming her last scenes with Case and Morrow \\"ridiculously hard\\". Daniel is cleared of all charges and Nick and Sharon begin Cassie's Foundation, a movement to prevent teenage drinking and driving. Following her death, the strong relationship between Nick and Sharon changes forever. Weighing in on the \\"groundbreaking\\" and \\"shocking\\" plot, Morrow stated, \\"As a person who watched Camryn grow up, I was devastated and it was not that difficult to use those feelings in the scenes we had to play. But as an actor, I have to commend our producer and writers at that time because it gave the show a huge new storyline that years later we are still playing out\\". He felt that losing a child gave Nick \\"an edge and a change\\" that affected him deeply. In 2012, during a court battle over Newman Enterprises (the family company), Nick tells a judge that Sharon's mental problems date to Cassie's death. Luke Kerr of Zap2it referred to this as playing the \\"Cassie card\\". Michelle Stafford portrayed Phyllis Summers, whom Nick has an affair with following the death of Cassie, which resulted in the birth of Summer Newman. Nick uses an affair with workmate Phyllis Summers (Michelle Stafford) to numb his emotions after Cassie's tragic death. Phyllis and Nick go their separate ways as he reunites with Sharon, although he marries Phyllis when she becomes pregnant with his child. Their daughter, Summer Newman, is born in December 2006. Their three- year marriage eventually succumbs to Nick's ongoing feelings for Sharon, which resulted in an affair and the birth of their daughter, Faith. Nick divorces Phyllis in 2010. They briefly reunite and remarry in 2012, although it ends because of Phyllis' adultery and lies. Morrow stated that \\"not many husbands would put up with what he has\\" in his marriages to Phyllis. =Summer's paternity= For years, it has been speculated that Summer was fathered by Jack, not Nick. When asked about this in 2010, Morrow stated: \\"The way Nick and Summer bond...Well, it‚Äôll be tough if he reveals he‚Äôs not her dad now. But I‚Äôm a betting man and I‚Äôll bet anything that she‚Äôs Jack‚Äôs baby\\". In 2013, eighteen-year-old Summer (Hunter King) is intent on losing her virginity, and develops an interest for Jack Abbott's son Kyle Abbott (Blake Hood). Responding to this, head writer Josh Griffith stated that they were \\"looking at the possibility of anything\\". A poll run by Daytime Confidential revealed that most audiences believe Summer is the daughter of Jack, with 79% of votes. In May 2013, Morrow spoke with Michael Logan of TV Guide, revealing that the question of Summer's paternity would be visited, as Nick's \\"game-changing deception\\" would be uncovered. It later revealed onscreen that Summer may in fact not be his daughter; the paternity results read only by Nick years ago were inconclusive. Logan called it \\"messy development\\", stating that his character may be \\"trashed forever\\". According to Morrow, after Cassie's death, Nick withheld the fact that the results were corrupted because \\"he just couldn't bear the thought of losing Summer, too\\", but called it \\"out of character\\". \\"But now he's freaking out because there's a good likelihood that Summer and Kyle are brother and sister,\\" he stated. Nick later secretly does another test using hair from Summer's hairbrush, which comes back conclusive. Later that May, Morrow stated during an interview with TV Buzz that Nick would be devastated by the paternity test outcome; confirming that Summer is in fact Jack's daughter. He stated that Nick is \\"terrified\\" of the potential repercussions and the reactions, from Jack, Sharon, Noah, and most importantly Summer. However, months later it was revealed that the paternity test results were actually switched by Nick's ex-wife Sharon Newman (Sharon Case), while she was off her bipolar medication, in a ploy to win Nick back, meaning that he is in fact Summer's biological father after all. Sharon's secret has yet to be revealed. Speaking of the forthcoming reveal, King stated, \\"I'm very curious as to how they're going to play it out with Summer. I'm sure she's still going to have the close bond that she now has with Jack.\\" Storylines Business tycoon Victor Newman (Eric Braeden) and his socialite wife Nikki Newman's (Melody Thomas Scott) marriage deteriorates and they decide to divorce. However, they end up conceiving a child. A son, Nicholas, is born on New Year's Eve of 1988. Nick grows up with two prominent men in his life, his father and stepfather Jack Abbott (Peter Bergman). Much like his older sister Victoria Newman (Amelia Heinle), Nick is sent to boarding school at a young age. In 1994, Nick returns to Genoa City, a typical sixteen-year-old teenager. He briefly dates Amy Wilson (Julianne Morris), but soon falls for her best friend, new resident Sharon Collins (Sharon Case). Nick and Sharon fall deeply in love, as she earns Victor's love and trust. However, Nikki is outraged, as she thinks Sharon, who is struggling financially, happens to be using Nick to get to the Newman fortune. Nonetheless, the relationship continues to blossom. Nick believes that Sharon is a virgin and agrees to wait for her, however, her ex-boyfriend Matt Clark shows up in town to expose Sharon's secret. It is revealed that Sharon gave birth to a daughter at age sixteen, which she gave up for adoption. Nick and Sharon briefly split because of this, but soon reunite. They continue to face problems, such as Sharon being raped by Matt. When Matt is nearly shot to death, Nick becomes the main suspect and is sent to jail. He eventually returns home and marries Sharon. She quickly becomes insecure in her marriage and stops using birth control, which results in a pregnancy. Months later, a premature son, Noah Newman, is welcomed. When it is feared that Noah would die at birth, Sharon's best friend, Grace Turner, tracks down her long-lost daughter, Cassie. However, when Noah lives, Grace attempts to keep Cassie as her own, but soon relinquishes her back to Sharon. Nick develops a bond with Cassie and becomes her father figure. Sharon and Nick's marriage weakens for months after he cheats on her with a manipulative Grace. However, they soon reunite during a custody battle over Cassie, where they are pronounced her official parents. Matt returns to Genoa City with a reconstructed face, rapes Sharon once more, and is eventually captured. When Sharon ends up pregnant, it is unknown who the father is: Nick or Matt. An argument with Nick causes Sharon to give birth to a stillborn daughter, which is revealed to be Nick's following her death. Nick and Sharon's marriage weakens further when they both cheat on each other once more, Nick with Grace and Sharon with the Newman stableman Diego Guittierez (Greg Vaughan). Nick tries to forgive her, but when he witnesses Sharon and Victor kissing, things become harder to mend than ever. Sharon later runs away from town, depressed. When she returns, Nick accepts her and they reunite. However, a man named Cameron Kirsten (Linden Ashby) who physically abused her (after having an affair with her) followed Sharon to Genoa City, wanting to bed her again. Eventually, Cameron's schemes are foiled and Sharon and Nick return to their normal life at last. In 2005, a fourteen-year-old rebellious Cassie is killed in a car accident. Nick closes off his emotions and cheats on Sharon with his Newman Enterprises work friend Phyllis Summers. Phyllis ends up pregnant, with Jack or Nick as possible fathers. The original DNA test to determine the child's paternity returns inconclusive, but the thought of losing another child leads Nick into lying, and claiming that he is Summer's father. Nick and Sharon divorce after an eleven-year marriage and he marries Phyllis instead. Their daughter, Summer Newman, is born. Sharon also moves on with her life, marrying Jack, which makes Nick feel uncomfortable. In 2007, Nick's flight on the Newman jet crashes and a body is never recovered; he is presumed dead, devastating his family and Sharon. Six months after being presumed dead, Nick is revealed to be alive, living with amnesia. Upon his return to Genoa City, he believes that Cassie is alive and that he is still married to Sharon and kisses her, intent on winning her back. However, soon his memory returns, and he reunites with Phyllis and Summer. Jack, Phyllis, Nick and Sharon soon start a business venture, creating a new magazine entitled Restless Style. However, the four constantly clash, and Jack and Sharon are driven out of the company. However, Nick and Sharon grow closer. While in Paris searching for a teenage Noah, Nick and Sharon share a kiss on the bridge, which is witnessed by Phyllis. Back in Genoa City, Nick and Sharon are snowed in at the Abbott cabin and end up making love. Their emotional affair continues, and they sleep together a second time three months later. This results in Sharon's pregnancy. She gives birth to Faith Newman in September 2009. She is stolen by Nick's brother Adam Newman at birth, presumed dead for months. Faith is eventually returned to her parents, after Sharon developed a relationship and married a manipulative Adam, unaware of his actions. Nick's marriage to Phyllis is over by this point. Nick and Sharon grow closer co-parenting Faith and eventually reunite. However, it is short-lived when she sleeps with Adam, unable to shake her deep-rooted feelings for him. Nick, disgusted with her actions, takes full custody of Faith from her when Sharon is unjustly arrested for murder, but continues to support her. Sharon is sentenced to life in prison and skips town, leaving everyone to believe she is dead. Nick begins a relationship with Diane Jenkins (Maura West), who is also developing a courtship with his father, Victor, at the same time. Diane is killed by Nikki in self-defense. Sharon returns and is freed with the help of lawyer Avery Bailey Clark (Jessica Collins). Nick has a short affair with Avery, until he returns to Phyllis. Phyllis becomes pregnant once more, but soon miscarries the child. Nonetheless, Nick still marries her. However, the marriage is short-lived, ending just months later, with Nick moving on to a relationship with Avery. Nick begins a new phase in his life. He decides to end his career as a businessman at Newman Enterprises and open up a club, which he names The Underground. When Summer finds herself attracted to Jack's son Kyle Abbott (Blake Hood), Nick panics, knowing that Summer may become involved with her biological brother. He has another DNA test performed, which appears to confirm that Nick is not Summer's biological father. However, in reality, Sharon (who has stopped taking medication to treat her bipolar disorder), altered the results in an attempt to get Nick to return to her. Nick confesses to Summer that Jack is her father. Sharon's attempts fail, and Nick and Avery become engaged; Avery misses the wedding after tending to her mentally distraught ex-boyfriend Dylan McAvoy (Steve Burton), and the relationship ends. Nick grows closer with Sharon, who continues to withhold the truth. Sharon's memories of changing the DNA results are wiped out after she undergoes electroconvulsive therapy to get rid of her \\"visions\\" of Cassie's ghost, which in actuality is Mariah Copeland (Camryn Grimes), a Cassie lookalike hired by Victor to haunt Sharon. Reception TV Guide noted Morrow to be one of the soap opera's longtime fan favorites. In his early years, The Chicago Tribune described the character as a \\"\\". Also during his early tenure on the series, Liz Wilson of The Record wrote that Morrow is a \\"soap opera hunk\\", noting his large group of \\"mostly young female fans\\". In July 1995, more than 12,000 fans of the show attended a \\"Men of Y&R;\\" event, which also featured fellow actors Eddie Cibrian, Shemar Moore and Don Diamont. The event organizer stated that it was a \\"mob scene\\", as over 6,000 fans turned up to meet each actor. According to The Augusta Chronicle, by 1999, \\"Wedding proposals, prom invitations and underwear-tossing fans are a part of everyday life for soap opera star Joshua Morrow\\", noting his fans to be \\"trembling\\" and \\"starry-eyed\\" in his presence. Nancy Dehart of The Spectator noted that his \\"mostly female\\" fans \\"even seemed to know more about his soap opera life than he did\\", quoting a fan exclaiming, \\"He's so sexy, I've got 100 pictures of him at home on my walls,\\" at another event. Morrow revealed that his fans commonly refer to him as Nick, not Joshua, stating: \\"Fans see me everyday as Nick Newman, so I don't fault them for calling me that [...] It's important that they do realize it's pretend, though\\". Michael Fairman of On-Air On-Soaps describes the character of Nick to be \\"not-so-upstanding\\", however has lauded Morrow as \\"one of the most underrated actors in daytime, who delivers real and honest performances day after day, no matter what the material\\". Luke Kerr of Zap2it wrote that Nick is \\"smooth, suave and did we mention rich?\\", naming him the \\"Newman prince\\". Tommy Garrett of the website Highlight Hollywood has often lauded Morrow's acting. Garrett stated that he \\"makes perfect choice daily as an actor\\" and is \\"solid as a rock from outer space\\" who \\"continues to shine\\" on screen. In a separate article, Garrett referred to Nick as someone who is occasionally \\"out of control\\" and \\"fights for what he wants\\", stating that \\"Morrow is the man in control\\" of his storyline, naming him \\"even more talented than any of daytime TV‚Äôs actors\\". The supercouple pairing of Nick and Sharon has been met with notable popularity among viewers as well as critics. SoapNet placed them on a list of \\"Best of 2000s Decade: Couples\\", stating: \\"...They've been apart since the death of their daughter, Cassie, but we all know that they belong together\\". On a list of \\"Greatest Soap Opera Supercouples\\" by Kim Potts of The Huffington Post, Nick and Sharon were placed 16th. They are referred to by fans as \\"Shick\\", a combination of Sharon and Nick's names. The couple's onscreen reunion in 2009 allowed the show's Nielsen Ratings to rise by an average of 447,000, capitalizing on their popularity. Nick's relationship with Phyllis has also gained a fan following, who refer to them as \\"Phick\\". Morrow's performance earned him five Daytime Emmy Award nominations for Outstanding Younger Actor consecutively from 1996 to 2000. However, the actor has won two Soap Opera Digest Awards, one for \\"Outstanding Younger Newcomer\\" in 1996 and another for \\"Outstanding Hero\\" in 2001. Amid critical praise for Cassie's storyline in 2005, Dan J. Kroll of the website Soap Central noted that it had \\"widely been expected\\" that Morrow and Case would receive nominations for Outstanding Lead Actress and Actor at the 33rd Daytime Emmy Awards; however, they were not. Despite this, Grimes was nominated for the Outstanding Younger Actress award. The paternity reveal in which Summer was revealed to be Jack's daughter was met with a negative response. Sara Bibel of the website Xfinity praised the acting performances delivered, but panned the writing as it \\"fell flat\\". Bibel wrote: \\"When a secret like this is released into the soap wild, its consequences should ricochet through the town. But this time the impact is minimal\\". Jamey Giddens of Zap2it stated that it was \\"sad to see a storyline that started with such huge, game-changing potential devolve into a head-scratching stink bomb\\".

It was written by Heliodorus of Emesa and is his only known work. Author Socrates Scholasticus (5th century AD) identifies the author of Aethiopica with a certain Heliodorus, bishop of Trikka. Nicephorus Callistus (14th century) relates that the work was written in the early years of this bishop before he became a Christian and that, when forced either to disown it or resign his bishopric, he preferred resignation. Most scholars reject this identification.Holzberg, Niklas. The Ancient Novel. 1995. p. 78Bowersock, Glanwill W. The Aethiopica of Heliodorus and the Historia Augusta. In: Historiae Augustae Colloquia n.s. 2, Colloquium Genevense 1991. p. 43.Wright, F.A. Introduction to Aethiopica. n.d. The most exact information about Heliodorus comes from Aethiopica itself. The author identifies himself in this manner: \\"Here ends the history of the Ethiopian adventures of Theagenes and Chariclea written by Heliodorus, a Phoenician of Emesus, son of Theodosius, and descended from the Sun.\\" Rediscovery The Aethiopica was first brought to light in Western Europe during the Renaissance in a manuscript from the library of Matthias Corvinus, found at the sack of Buda (now the western part of Budapest) in 1526, and printed at Basel in 1534. Other codices have since been discovered. It was first translated into French by the celebrated Jacques Amyot in 1547. It was first translated into English in 1569 by Thomas Underdown, who used the 1551 Latin translation of Stanis≈Çaw Warszewicki to create his Aethiopian Historie. In the Byzantine Empire, this novel was known by the Greek readership. For example, the novel is mentioned in a will of a noble man known as Eustathios Voilas (Œï·ΩêœÉœÑŒ¨Œ∏ŒπŒøœÇ ŒíŒøŒêŒªŒ±œÇ). According to this will, dated year 1059, he bequeathed several books to a monastery of the Theotokos, which he had founded, amongst them the Aethiopica. It was printed several times by Gabriele Giolito de' Ferrari in the Republic of Venice (1556, 1560, 1586) in an Italian translation from Greek by Leonardo Ghini. Style The Aethiopica is indebted to the works of Homer and Euripides. The title is taken from the fact that the action of the beginning and end of the story takes place in Aethiopia. The work is notable for its rapid succession of events, the variety of its characters, its vivid descriptions of manners and of scenery, and its simple, elegant writing style. But what has been regarded as most remarkable is that the novel opens in the middle of the story (\\"in medias res\\"), and the plot is resolved by having various characters describe their prior adventures in retrospective narratives or dialogues, which eventually tie together. Homer utilized this technique in both his epic poems Iliad and Odyssey. This feature makes the Aethiopica stand out from all the other ancient Greek romances. Plot introduction Chariclea, the daughter of King Hydaspes and Queen Persinna of Ethiopia, was born white through the effect of the sight of a marble statue upon the queen during pregnancy (an instance of the theory of maternal impression). Fearing accusations of adultery, Persinna gives her baby daughter to the care of Sisimithras, a gymnosophist, who takes the baby to Egypt and places her in the care of Charicles, a Pythian priest. Chariclea is then taken to Delphi, and made a priestess of Artemis. Theagenes, a noble Thessalian, comes to Delphi and the two fall in love. He runs off with Chariclea with the help of Calasiris (kalasiris), an Egyptian who has been employed by Persinna to find Chariclea. They encounter many perils: pirates, bandits, and others. The main characters ultimately meet at Mero√´ at the very moment when Chariclea is about to be sacrificed to the gods by her own father. Her birth is made known, and the lovers are happily married. Influence Heliodorus' novel was immensely influential and was imitated by Byzantine Greeks and by French, Italian, and Spanish writers.Margaret Anne Doody, The True Story of the Novel (Rutgers University Press, 1996). The structure, events, and themes of the European adventure novel of the first half of the seventeenth century‚ÄîMlle de Scud√©ry, Marin le Roy de Gomberville, Miguel de Cervantes's Persiles y Sigismunda, and likely Aphra Behn's Oroonoko‚Äîwere directly modeled on Heliodorus's work. His influence continued to be felt in the eighteenth century novel (especially in those having a \\"tale within a tale\\" structure). The English dramatist John Gough based his tragicomedy The Strange Discovery (published 1640) on the Aethiopica. The 17th century French dramatist Jean Racine claimed that Heliodorus' novel was his favorite book and when, after he had joined the ascetic Jansenist retreat Port-Royal and the book had been repeatedly taken away from him, Racine is reported to have said that the loss of the book no longer mattered since he had already memorized it. The early life of Clorinda in Torquato Tasso's Jerusalem Delivered (canto xii. 21 sqq.) is almost identical with that of Chariclea. Canadian writer Alice Munro refers to the novel in her short story \\"Silence\\" which also explores the theme of a mother detached from her daughter. The story was published in the book Runaway (2004).

Originally known as the village of San Joaquin Valley in the 1840s, the town was served by the McCloud Stage Company as the last stop for passengers before heading over the Altamont Pass on the road between Stockton and the Bay Area. The stage stop spawned the Elk Horn Inn, which served thirsty travelers and local farmers. Expanded by owner Ransom Chamberlain in 1853 to include a two-story hotel, restaurant and bar, the inn was renamed ‚ÄúThe White House.‚Äù In 1863, Henry Banta bought the inn from Chamberlain and changed the sign on the awning to read ‚ÄúBanta‚Äôs White House.‚Äù Soon, local residents, travelers and teamsters began calling the settlement ‚ÄúBantas,‚Äù and the town began appearing on maps and stagecoach schedules under that name. In the 1860s, Bantas became a whistle stop for freight and passengers on the original Western Pacific Railroad, which later became the Southern Pacific Railroad. Banta was located on the route of the transcontinental railroad from Sacramento to the San Francisco Bay Area by way of the Altamont Pass and Niles Canyon before the Central Pacific bought the route of the California Pacific which ran north of the Carquinez Strait to Vallejo.

The perception of more positive attributes such as morality, technology, and sophistication to one's own time could lead an individual as a member of a collectivity to impose their forms of time on others and impede the efforts towards more homogeneous temporal commons. History Chronocentrism (from the Greek chrono- meaning \\"time\\") was coined by sociologist Jib Fowles in an article in the journal Futures in February, 1974. Fowles described chronocentrism as \\"the belief that one's own times are paramount, that other periods pale in comparison\\". A critical view described it as the belief that only the present counts and that the past is irrelevant except to serve as a reference to a few basic assumptions about what went before. More recently, it has been defined as \\"the egotism that one's own generation is poised on the very cusp of history\\". The term had been used earlier in a study about attitudes to ageing in the workplace. Chronocentricity: \\"...only seeing the value of one's own age cohort...described the tendency for younger managers to hold negative perceptions of the abilities or other work-related competencies of older employees.\\" This type of discrimination is a form of ageism. Ethnocentrism Chronocentrism as ethnocentrism is the perceiving and judging of a culture's historical values in terms of the standards of one's own time period. Antichronocentrism The Long Now Foundation is an organization that encourages the use of 5-digit years, e.g. \\"02016\\" instead of \\"2016,\\" to help emphasize how early the present time is in their vision of the timeline of humanity. The use of two-digit years before Y2K was an example of chronocentrism (in the early years of computing, the years 2000 and 1899 were believed to be too far in the future or the past, and thus of less importance than being able to save two digits in computerizing and typing out years). Applications The \\"Copernican time principle\\" is a temporal analog of the Copernican principle for space, which states that no spatial location is any more or less special of a frame of reference than any other spatial location (i.e., that our physical universe has no center). Some authors have extended this to also include that no point in time is any more or less special than any other point in time (e.g., in outdated steady-state theories), though this cannot be universally applied (e.g., the Big-Bang singularity is a special point in time that can be logically used as a frame of reference to date later events.) Chronocentrism is also considered a norm in music until the twentieth century when musicians believe their music preserved a style of interpretation that formed an unbroken chain of authority and orthodoxy. For instance, Romantic musicians deliberately changed the style when performing earlier repertoire.

History The city of Vancouver assumed its first municipal seal upon incorporation in 1886. Designed by City Alderman Lauchlan Hamilton, it was pictorial in nature depicting a tree, a sailing ship and a train, and did not conform to any rules of heraldry. The seal was in use until 1903, when a new armorial achievement was assumed. Designed by James Blomfield, it contains many of the elements used in the current coat of arms: the pile (charged here with a caduceus), the logger and the fisherman as supporters, and the wavy bars alluding to the ocean. It also retains the motto from the previous emblem, By Sea Land and Air We Prosper. The development of the current coat of arms started in 1928, when the city council attempted to register the arms designed by Blomfield with the College of Arms. The College rejected the registration. Between 1928 and 1932, a committee sat occasionally before shelving the issue. In 1962, the matter was reopened. Members of city staff visited the College to go over the design of the arms, assisted by the Chester Herald, Walter Verco. The grant of arms, as well as a badge derived from the arms, was finally approved on 31 March 1969 and presented to Vancouver City Council the following January. Symbolism *Crest: A Ship signifying Vancouver's importance as a seaport, upon a mural crown, the traditional heraldic emblem for a city. *Shield: The dogwood flowers in the chief are a symbol of the province (they can also be found in the compartment of the coat of arms of British Columbia). The main charge is a Kwakiutl totem pole, symbol of the area's native heritage, surmounting wavy ribbons of blue and silver (for the waters surrounding the city). *Supporters: A logger and a fisherman, standing for the traditional industries of the area. *Motto: By Sea Land and Air We Prosper; the word \\"air\\" was added to the existing motto to acknowledge the growing importance of aviation to Vancouver's development. Derived symbols The mural crown from the crest forms the basis for the city badge. Inside the crown is an axe and an oar placed in saltire, alluding to the same two industries (logging and fishing) represented by the supporters of the arms. The city badge is featured on the flag of Vancouver. The shield of arms also serves as the central feature of the Vancouver Police Department's badge.

M113 C&R;) is a United States-built tracked reconnaissance armoured fighting vehicle, which was employed by the armed forces of the Netherlands and Canada. Dutch vehicles were exported in the 1990s to BahrainFocus on: The Royal Bahraini Army (3): The M113 Family, WordPress. and Chile, according to SIPRI 35 and 8 vehicles respectively. The M113¬Ω was developed in 1963 as a private venture by FMC Corp., the manufacturer of the M113. It competed with the M114 but the US Army chose the M114 for production. The design was then offered to foreign buyers and gained the name Lynx when purchased by Canada. The Lynx was based on the M113, including its aluminum armor and many details of its construction. However, it is shorter in both length and height, and has four road wheels instead of five. This reduction in size led to a significant reduction in weight as well, dropping to about 8 tonne compared to over 12 for the original M113. The engine was moved to the rear and offered in gas and diesel versions. The Lynx is amphibious, propelled in the water by its tracks. Before swimming, a trim vane is erected at front, bilge pumps started, and covers mounted on the air intake and exhaust. In practice, crews would close hatches and ford shallow streams at high speed. Service history The Royal Netherlands Army accepted 250 vehicles, beginning in 1966. The Dutch version of the Lynx has the driver front-left, radio operator/7.62mm machine gunner front-right, and a .50-calibre machine gun cupola centre. In the 1970s, the heavy machine gun was replaced by an Oerlikon-B√ºhrle GBD-ADA turret mounting a 25mm KBA cannon. Dutch vehicles were later exported to Bahrain. The Dutch designated their vehicles the M113 C&V; Lynx of the Royal Canadian Hussars, installed in front of the C√¥te-des-Neiges Armoury, Montreal The Canadian Forces accepted 174 vehicles from 1968. Lynx's were issued to the reconnaissance squadron of an armoured regiment (D Sqn), as well as to squadrons of the armoured regiment assigned to the reconnaissance role, one squadron retaining the Ferret scout car. The squadron consisted of three troops, each equipped with five Lynxes, two two-vehicle patrols plus the troop leader's vehicle, four troops per squadron for the reconnaissance regiment. (Militia [reserve] armoured reconnaissance units trained for the role with Jeeps or Iltis 4√ó4 trucks). In addition, nine Lynxes equipped the reconnaissance platoon of an infantry battalion's combat support company, as well as the reconnaissance sections of combat engineer field troops. In the Canadian Lynx, the crew commander's cupola is located middle-right, and the observer's hatch was rear-left. The commander operates the manually traversed M26 heavy machine gun cupola from inside the vehicle, but reloads it with the hatch open. The rear-facing observer operates the radio and fires the pintle-mounted 7.62mm machine gun. Behind the commander, on the floor, was a drop-down escape hatch. The Canadian Lynx was withdrawn from service in 1993, and replaced by 203 Coyote eight- wheeled reconnaissance vehicles by the end of 1996.

J. L., 529 U.S. 266 (2000), held that a police officer may not legally stop and frisk anyone based solely on an anonymous tip that simply described that person's location and what he or she might look like but that did not furnish information as to any illegal conduct that the person might be planning.  Facts and procedural history In 1995 the Miami-Dade Police Department received an anonymous tip that a young black male was at a bus stop wearing a plaid shirt and carrying a firearm. The police went to the bus stop and saw three young black men, one wearing a plaid shirt. Acting solely on the tip (the officers did not observe any criminal or suspicious behavior), they searched all three, and found a pistol in the pocket of the man wearing the plaid shirt. At trial the court granted the juvenile defendant's motion to suppress evidence as fruit of an unreasonable search and seizure. However, the Florida Third District Court of Appeal reversed the trial court. J.L. appealed the decision to the Florida Supreme Court, which quashed the decision of the District Court, holding that the tip did not give sufficient indicia of reliability to justify a stop and frisk of the subject. The appellee sought certiorari review from the United States Supreme Court.  Opinion of the Court  The United States Supreme Court held in a unanimous opinion by Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg that the search was unreasonable. That the tip accurately identified the defendant and that the allegation of the firearm ultimately proved to be accurate was insufficient to justify the seizure. For a completely anonymous tip to justify even a \\"stop and frisk\\" of a suspect pursuant to Terry v. Ohio, 392 U.S. 1 (1968), it must be \\"suitably corroborated\\" with both the accurate prediction of future activity of the subjectsee Alabama v. White, 496 U.S. 325 (1990). and accurate in its assertion of potential criminal activity. The tip given in the J.L. case was only sufficient to identify the subject and nothing more, making the police reliance upon it unjustified. The Court further declined to create a standard \\"firearms exception\\" to the Terry doctrine, as was recognized in some Federal circuits, stating, among other things, that \\"[s]uch an exception would enable any person seeking to harass another to set in motion an intrusive, embarrassing police search of the targeted person simply by placing an anonymous call falsely reporting the target's unlawful carriage of a gun . . . .\\"Florida v.

Founded in 1933, the National Muzzle Loading Rifle Association (NMLRA) is the largest association of muzzleloaders in the United States. It is known for its promotion of the sport of muzzleloading which involves the firing of muzzleloader or black-powder firearms. Membership There are varying degrees of membership within the NMLRA, all of which entail paying dues to the Association. Members of the Association are granted all of the rights of a member of the Association. They also receive a copy of the NMLRA's monthly publication Muzzle Blasts. Chartered clubs The NMLRA has granted charters to local and regional muzzleloading gun clubs, groups, or associations in all fifty states in the United States as well as Canada. Generally, each of the charter clubs holds their own championship shoot and reports the results of the shoot to the NMLRA. For a complete listing of all clubs, groups, and associations chartered by the NMLRA follow this link: NMLRA Chartered Clubs. Friendship, Indiana Gunmaker's Hall at Friendship, IN The NMLRA is based in Friendship, Indiana, approximately forty miles from Cincinnati, Ohio. The area is a combination of both modern and primitive facilities reflecting the diverse nature of the Association and the sport of muzzleloading. On site at Friendship, the NMLRA has The Museum of the National Muzzle Loading Rifle Association as well as Gunmakers Hall, where the works of contemporary gunmakers are displayed. The Museum is located within the historic structure known as The John Linsey Rand House. The Rand House also houses the offices for \\"Muzzle Blasts\\", the NMLRA's monthly publication. Walter Cline Gun Range There are two shooting ranges at Friendship: the Curly Gostomski Primitive Range and the Walter Cline Modern Range. During national shoots, and other events, the site also hosts Commercial Row where some of today's most skilled muzzleloading craftsmen set up to sell their wares covering all aspects of muzzleloading. The site also includes two camping area: a modern area for campers and modern tents and a primitive area for canvas tents, tipis, etc. No pets or animals are allowed on site for the national shoots or any other NMLRA-sponsored event. National shoots A shooter at the Walter Cline Range The NMLRA holds two national shooting competitions at the Walter Cline Range at Friendship: the annual Spring National Shoot held in mid-June and the National Championship Shoot held in mid-September. Registration for these events is $30.00 ($20.00 for pre- registration) for members of the NMLRA. According to the NMLRA website, \\"During the two major events shooters from around the world compete for national record scores. There are competitions for muzzleloading rifle, pistol, shotgun, musket, bench and slug guns, as well as tomahawk and knife throwing.\\" Several weekend shoots are also held at Friendship throughout the year including a 4-H Invitational Championship Shoot, the NRA National Muzzleloading Championship Shoot, a Youth Shoot, a Family Shoot, the Lore of the Laughery Shoot, a Turkey Shoot, and a National Women's Weekend Shoot. National rendezvous The NMLRA was responsible for creating a number of National Regional Primitive Rendezvous, or historical reenactments of the North American fur trade, during the late 1970s and early-to-mid-1980s. These rendezvous spanned the entire breadth of the continental United States. These rendezvous were managed directly by the Association through the year 1998. However, in late 1998 the NMLRA decided to discontinue their direct control of these national rendezvous as they no longer believed them to be profitable. They created the National Rendezvous and Living History Foundation to manage the rendezvous. While the NMLRA technically still continues to sponsor the national rendezvous, the NRLHF currently runs and manages those events that remained affiliated with the Association after its 1998 decision. Those rendezvous are the Eastern Regional Rendezvous, the Northeastern Regional Rendezvous, the Southeastern Regional Rendezvous, the Old Northwest Territory Regional Rendezvous, and the Midwest Regional Rendezvous. Other activities and programs John Linsey Rand House/NMLRA Museum The NMLRA also sponsors an activity known as The Longhunter. The Longhunter program is designed to encourage the sport of muzzleloading while hunting large game due to the challenges and thrills such activity entails. It is associated with the Big Game Records Program which is the only trophy recognition program strictly for the muzzleloading hunter. The NMLRA also sponsors Muzzle Blasts Postal Match. A target is included in an issue of the NMLRA monthly publication \\"Muzzle Blasts\\" and the participant must shoot the target and mail it into the NMLRA along with a $2.00 entry fee. The winners are posted on the NMLRA website and the proceeds go towards the Association's Youth Program. The NMLRA is currently seeking to restore the Rand House, a historic structure located on the ground at Friendship and home to both the NMLRA Museum and \\"Muzzle Blasts\\". In order to raise money for this restoration the Association is selling bricks to individuals so that they can inscribe any message of their choice on them for between $50.00 to $250.00. These bricks will then be used in the restoration of Rand House. John Linsey Rand House/NMLRA Museum, side view The NMLRA also has a college scholarship program. They offer two, $500.00 scholarships per-semester to members or dependents of members in good-standing with the NMLRA. The awarding of the scholarships is based on a number of factors including academic performance in high school as well as the financial need of the applicant. The NMLRA is also seeking to create a permanent, $1,000,000 endowment for itself by seeking out one thousand individuals who are willing to donate $1,000 each to the Association. According to the NMLRA website, \\"The donation will be placed in the permanently restricted endowment fund of the NMLRA. The principal will remain in the endowment, and can be used only to generate interest or to purchase a permanent asset such as land. The principal can never be used for the general operation of the Association. The interest earned produces income for new and innovative programs that help ensure the long-term viability of the organization and help it to prosper.\\" Education and training The NMLRA also seeks to educate and train individuals in the sport of muzzleloading so as to further their goals as an organization and to have trained individuals available to manage their activities.

Created by William J. Bell as a love interest for Nicholas Newman, the character debuted on June 27, 1994. Before Case took over in September 1994, the character was portrayed briefly by Monica Potter and then by Heidi Mark. When first introduced, Sharon was a young girl from the poor side of town. Nick and Sharon married, had a son named Noah, and later won custody of Cassie, the child a teenaged Sharon had given up for adoption. Their marriage faced a number of problems, including infidelity on both sides. Following Cassie's death in an automobile accident, Nick cheated on Sharon with Phyllis Summers, resulting in a pregnancy which ended their 11-year marriage. Despite her second marriage to (and divorce from) Jack Abbott, Nick and Sharon had an affair and conceived a third child: Faith. During the pregnancy, Sharon experienced kleptomania. Faith was kidnapped by Adam Newman, Nick's brother, leading Sharon to believe she had died. When Adam's crimes were revealed and Faith was returned to Sharon, she remained in love with him; SoapNet considered the relationship \\"dark\\". Since 2011, former showrunner Maria Arena Bell and subsequent head writers that followed have significantly changed the character's direction, receiving negative backlash from critics and audiences. Sharon married her ex-father-in-law Victor Newman, gained control of his company (Newman Enterprises) and burned down his ranch‚Äîa sequence of events which resulted in her being diagnosed with bipolar disorder. The character was then involved in a DNA test alteration storyline, which was also heavily criticized by critics. She subsequently married Dylan McAvoy and experienced a phantom pregnancy after miscarrying their child, which led to her keeping a child that wasn't hers for months. Sharon has been characterized as \\"insecure\\" and \\"not your typical romantic lead\\" by Case. Despite the character's crimes and faults, she is described as an \\"ever-suffering heroine\\" by Canyon News, and has been called soap opera's \\"hottest mess\\" by Daytime Confidential. The supercouple pairing of Nick and Sharon attracted a large fan following. Case has become popular with viewers and her performance has received praise from critics (particularly for overcoming heavily panned writing), while also earning her several award nominations including winning a Daytime Emmy Award for Outstanding Supporting Actress in a Drama Series in 1999.  Casting  Monica Potter originated the role of Sharon, although she was fired afterward. Sharon Newman was created and introduced by William J. Bell, with the character making her first appearance June 27, 1994. Sharon Case, who plays Sharon to the present day, is the third actress to play the role. Previously, struggling actress Monica Potter originated the role, but was fired. She confessed years later, \\"I was fired because I was terrible\\". Heidi Mark then briefly took over the role on July 11, 1994; Potter and Mark together had a three‚Äìmonth stint. Case, who had previously worked on the soap operas General Hospital and As the World Turns, was cast in August 1994. She was selected from a group of six other possible recasts after a screen testing with co-star Joshua Morrow, and began airing on September 7, 1994. Initially, Case believed she would only be playing the role for a maximum of six months. Of her casting, she stated: \\"Not only is this my third soap, but I'm also the third actress to play the role of Sharon Collins. So, if three times is the charm, this should be it.\\" The actress wanted to \\"breathe new life\\" into the role and make it her own. In 2003, Case was off-screen from February 17 to May 1, during contract negotiations. These were resolved that April, when she signed a new contract to remain on the show for another four years, until 2007. Case revealed that while she considered leaving the series, \\"I would not have been negotiating if I did not want to come back. I've always had a great story to play. I love the way they write Sharon. It was just a matter of hammering out the deal points.\\"  Character development  =Characterization= In March 1995, Los Angeles Times writer Nancy Reichardt characterized Sharon as \\"the girl from the wrong side of the tracks\\" with Nekeeta Borden of the entertainment news website Daytime Confidential describing her as being kindhearted and a \\"\\" during her early years on the show, noting that she wanted to start her own trends rather than follow other members of the Newman family. Case likened Sharon to a younger Jill Foster Abbott (Jess Walton), telling Soap Opera Weekly that Jill \\"was kind of like Sharon. She was nice...no one thought she was a gold digger‚Äîat first.\\" According to the actress, Sharon does \\"weird things\\" and panics when stressed, and her mistakes \\"eat away at her\\", as \\"She doesn't do well with secrets\\". Case also described the character as feeling insecure and unworthy of being in a happy relationship, telling the Star-Banner that \\"Sharon goes through many emotions in a week\\". MSN characterized Sharon as a \\"bitch\\" after a storyline in which she took over Newman Enterprises in 2012. Of the writing for her character, Case said it is indispensable: \\"They both have to be there. I couldn't have gotten away with this without those lines\\". However, the actress has expressed displeasure with Sharon being paired with \\"too many men\\" because it \\"waters her down\\", wanting to incorporate different aspects of Sharon into her performance. Case stated that Sharon, who sees visions of her deceased daughter Cassie (Camryn Grimes), believes that \\"she is connected to the spiritual world\\". Having played many facets of Sharon over the years, Case said: \\"It‚Äôs almost like I‚Äôve played 15 different characters in my career when I‚Äôve only played one. There‚Äôs never a dull moment\\", calling the character an \\"optimist and a survivor\\". Case has stated that the character's main drive is searching for love, which to Sharon is \\"her survival\\". She described Sharon as having \\"so many different layers to her\\" and one of the more complex characters on The Young and the Restless. =Relationship with Nicholas Newman= Case (right) with co-star Joshua Morrow (left), who portrays Nicholas Newman. Sharon has been romantically linked to her high-school sweetheart, Nicholas \\"Nick\\" Newman (Joshua Morrow), since her debut on the series. As teenagers they dream of eloping, and face their first hurdle when Sharon's ex-boyfriend Matt Clark (Eddie Cibrian) exposes Sharon's teenage motherhood (when she gave her baby, fathered by her former boyfriend in Madison, Wisconsin, up for adoption). Nick, believing Sharon is a virgin, briefly breaks up with her but they reunite. With Matt behind them, they marry in February 1996 and have their first child‚ÄîNoah (Robert Adamson)‚Äîin 1997, the year Sharon is also reunited with her daughter Cassie (Camryn Grimes). Sharon's best friend Grace Turner (Jennifer Gareis) seduces Nick, triggering another breakup; Sharon and Nick reunite during a custody battle for Cassie. Of their highly anticipated reunion, head writer Kay Alden noted that during the previous several months \\"there's been a lot of stop-and-go and mixed messages\\" between the couple, but their feelings were definitely clear again; Morrow felt that Nick loves Cassie as much as he loves Noah. However, Sharon has an affair with Diego Guittierez (Greg Vaughan). In May 2005, 14-year-old Cassie is killed in a car accident. Nick becomes distant from Sharon, and is unfaithful to her with Phyllis Summers (Michelle Stafford). The marriage ends the following year; Nick moves on with a pregnant Phyllis, who gives birth to their daughter Summer Newman (Hunter King). Case said that Sharon saw Phyllis as a \\"poison\\" in their lives, noting: \\"Sharon is a religious person, and that was the devil‚Äôs work.\\" Although Sharon also moved on, marrying Jack Abbott (Peter Bergman), Nick and Sharon remain in love. They kiss while Nick, suffering from amnesia, believes they are still married; Phyllis is jealous of Sharon, insulting her in an article in her magazine Restless Style. In January 2009, Nick and Sharon reunite in a sexual affair at the Abbott cabin, an event much anticipated by viewers. According to Case, Sharon wanted Nick more than anyone at the time but only if he left Phyllis; Morrow told TV Guide that although the reunion was \\"messy\\", viewers wanted this for a long time. After another one-night stand Sharon becomes pregnant, briefly lying that Jack is the baby's father when Summer becomes ill and Phyllis needs Nick. Nick soon finds out, but their daughter Faith is kidnapped at birth by Nick's brother (Adam) and given to Ashley (Jack's sister). Sharon, believing Faith has died, seduces a guilty Adam. Faith is eventually reunited with her parents, and Adam's crimes are revealed. Nick and Sharon are briefly engaged that November, but they break up when she sleeps with Adam and their relationship becomes bitter. Although Case and Morrow believe the couple belong together, they are apart for several years; during which they both believed a reunion wouldn't happen anytime soon. In late 2013, the characters begin to grow closer again despite the fact that Sharon secretly switched the paternity test results of Nick's daughter Summer; Case stated in an interview that Sharon is in \\"constant turmoil\\" regarding her secret, and Morrow stated that he believed a reunion was a possibility given Nick's vulnerability, saying: \\"They've worked things out before‚Äîand they could work things out again. There is always a possibility for Nick and Sharon to get back together!\\" However, Soaps In Depth wrote: \\"Yet, with Sharon's secret haunting her like the glowering ghost of Christmas past, the supercouple's fans may need a holiday miracle to keep Sharon and Nick's relationship from exploding!\\" =Cameron Kirsten= Sharon looks at the body of Frank Barritt in disbelief, believing it to be Cameron Kirsten (2004). In February 2003, Case temporarily exited the show as a result of lengthy contract negotiations. Instead of having the character depart permanently (or be killed off), executive producer David Shaughnessy chose to have her leave town after issues with her marriage to Nick. While away, Sharon becomes suicidal; Case explained that Sharon's life had fallen apart and she left town to commit suicide, drinking herself into \\"a complete stupor\\". Travelling to Denver, she meets (and has an affair with) businessman Cameron Kirsten (Linden Ashby), who physically abuses her. In April, Case signed a new contract with the show. Executive producer and head writer at the time John F. Smith said that upon Sharon's return to Genoa City, she wants to keep where she was a secret. That December, Sharon is horrified when Cameron arrives in town for apparent business with Newman Enterprises. Smith stated that the story with Cameron and Sharon would be one that \\"builds quickly into a lot of drama\\". Explaining their relationship, Ashby revealed that Cameron and Sharon were \\"kindred spirits\\" and hooked up, but Cameron becomes abusive, with Ashby calling him \\"really disturbing\\". Cameron blackmails Sharon into meeting him at a motel. When she arrives they have a physical altercation in which Sharon throws a bottle at him to keep him from raping her, \\"killing\\" him (or so she believes). Australian magazine TV Soap noted that \\"sweet, demure\\" Sharon had become a murderer. After driving around with his body in her car trunk for days, she dumps it in an alley. Sharon's former friend, Grace, returns to town; she discovers Cameron alive, and nurses him back to health. Detective Weber (Sherman Augustus) is suspicious of Sharon's involvement in Cameron's disappearance. Sharon begins \\"hallucinating\\" with visions of Cameron's \\"ghost\\" (which is actually him, alive). Case noted that Sharon was getting into deeper trouble by making mistakes \\"trying to do the right thing\\". A scene where Sharon and Nick's mother Nikki (Melody Thomas Scott) were searching the sewers for what they believed was Cameron's dead body became popular with fans of the show. Scott described the sewer shoot as a \\"horrific day at work\\" with \\"20 live f--king rats on the set\\", while comparing the unlikely duo of Sharon and Nikki to Lucy and Ethel from I Love Lucy. Cameron eventually reveals himself. He had murdered Sharon's ex-boyfriend (and Cassie's biological father) Frank Barritt (Phil Dozois), who was visiting town, and hid the body in Sharon's car trunk. Cameron's crimes are revealed; he is jailed, absolving Sharon of wrongdoing. Although Sharon did not actually murder Cameron, Case praised the storyline and called Sharon a heroine. She explained: \\"Your romantic lead shouldn't just be a simple romantic lead. Sharon was that for a long time. She was in this love story with Nick and nothing really happened to her. You can only carry that so far.\\" = Cassie's death = In 2005, good-girl Cassie becomes a rebellious teenager; Nick and Sharon have a difficult time dealing with her. Cassie has a crush on bad-boy Daniel Romalotti (Michael Graziadei), who is dating Lily Winters (Christel Khalil). One night, against her parents' wishes she sneaks out to a party. In a ploy to impress a drunken Daniel she attempts to drive him home, despite being underage. The car crashes, leaving them with no memory of the accident. Daniel is thought to have been driving, and is blamed for the accident. Cassie becomes hospitalized and escapes to find Daniel to tell him she was driving, but is soon re-admitted. During the May 24 episode, Cassie dies with Nick and Sharon at her side. Grimes said she did not think Cassie would die, but if it was \\"meant to happen, it's meant to happen\\". The actress found filming her last scenes with Case and Morrow \\"ridiculously hard\\". Case also found taping the scenes devastating: \\"It was too real for Joshua and me to even go through it. We did it in one take. The scene is still devastating in my mind and Joshua's. It's almost not watchable. If it comes on, I can't get through it.\\" Daniel is cleared of all charges and Nick and Sharon begin Cassie's Foundation, a movement to prevent teenage drinking and driving. According to Case, when Sharon loses something in her life it \\"reminds her and reactivates Cassie‚Äôs death for her\\". After Nick cheats on Sharon following Cassie's death, Case said it \\"makes you so fearful that you are going to be alone for the rest of your life; that no matter what you go out in life to create, it‚Äôs going to be ruined anyway\\". The actress also believed that Sharon lost her identity after Cassie's death. In 2012, during a court battle over Newman Enterprises (the family company), Nick stated that Sharon's mental problems date to Cassie's death. =Subsequent relationships= According to Case, Sharon loses her identity after her divorce from Nick, which leads to her beginning a romance with Phyllis's ex- husband Jack Abbott, played by Peter Bergman. They marry in April 2007, but divorce two years later as a result of Jack's dishonesty which severely weakened the marriage. Case praised the pairing for its accurate representation of a \\"modern marriage\\" and noted that Sharon could not deal with Jack's \\"broken promises again and again\\". Years before marrying Jack, Sharon had a brief affair with Brad Carlton (Don Diamont). Case believed that the romance could have been further explored. During a blizzard, Brad visits Sharon at the Abbott cabin and declares his love for her, although she rejects him. Moments later, Brad is killed while saving her son, Noah, from drowning in an icy lake; he falls through the ice himself. Case stated that Sharon was guilty over Brad's tragic death. Michael Muhney plays Sharon's \\"darker\\" love interest, Adam. Adam Newman (Michael Muhney)‚Äîwho kidnapped Sharon's newborn baby, Faith, and gave her to Ashley Abbott (Eileen Davidson) to avoid being caught in a scheme‚Äîbonds with Sharon out of guilt, though falls in love with her and they marry. Muhney told SoapNet that Adam \\"unequivocally\\" loves her, explaining \\"You can argue as much logic as you want about what Adam has done and what he is doing.\\" Adam's kidnapping of Faith is revealed; Sharon remains in love with him, to the chagrin of her family and friends. Case described Sharon's ability to forgive Adam as \\"a tough pill to swallow\\", while Jamey Giddens of Daytime Confidential described them as \\"inappropriate, yet red- hot\\". After trying to get Adam acquitted for Skye's (his ex-wife's) murder, Sharon is jailed. Case liked \\"Shadam\\", noting that the relationship \\"took us all by surprise...that is what I was referring to with this storyline because of the pace and the vitality that 'Shadam' has.\\" While a fugitive, Adam believes Sharon is dead; however, she sleeps with Sam Gibson (Sean Patrick Flanery). Adam feels betrayed when Sharon returns to Genoa City; he cons her into a jailhouse wedding, and leaves her heartbroken and angry. To spend time with Faith, Nick forces Sharon to get a restraining order against Adam. The night before the order becomes active, Adam and Sharon make love. Jae' Jones of Yahoo! noted that Sharon's actions would always lead her back to Adam. After Adam is attacked (losing his vision), Sharon brings him back to his mother's farm in Kansas and they become engaged. After returning to Genoa City, however, she leaves Adam when his additional past crimes come to light. After marrying Chelsea Lawson (Melissa Claire Egan), Adam helps Sharon through an emotional breakdown (which drove her to burn down Victor's home) and covers her tracks so she is not arrested. Sharon and Adam's attraction drove a wedge between him and Chelsea. Luke Kerr of Daytime Confidential considered Chelsea \\"out of her league\\" against Sharon. While Case felt that Nick and Sharon's history \\"held more weight\\", she said Sharon's relationship with Adam is \\"just as deep\\". Unlike Nick's mother Nikki Newman (Melody Thomas Scott), his father Victor Newman (Eric Braeden) adored Sharon and maintained a paternal relationship with her over the years. Case described Victor as being Sharon's hero and a \\"father figure\\". However, their dynamic changes in January 2012 when Victor marries Sharon so that she can protect his assets while he is in jail; the non-romantic marriage is annulled days later. Several months later, they become romantically involved. Joshua Morrow told Soaps In Depth that he was puzzled as to why Nick had no \\"legitimate anger\\" about the relationship, while Braeden was also unhappy with the storyline, stating: \\"We all have gone through periods of playing something we didn't really like to play so much, but you do it.\\" Case described the relationship as incestuous: \\"Sometimes controversial storylines can work because you're bringing attention to a controversial issue that the nation is trying to decide on. But this was not one of those things\\", calling it \\"upsetting to the audience\\". The actress was also unfavorable of Sharon marrying Victor in August 2012, believing the writers could have handled the storyline other ways. The short-lived marriage between Victor and Sharon was considered an \\"inside joke\\" for the actors. Reflecting on the storyline, Case revealed: \\"I didn‚Äôt understand how I was going to sell a love story between Sharon and Victor for obvious reasons. What motivated Sharon to fall in love with Victor when she‚Äôs in love with Adam and Nick?\\" = Imprisonment and escape = Sharon posing as her alias, Sheri Coleman, on a farm in New Mexico. In January 2011, Sharon is arrested for the murder of Adam's ex-wife, Skye Newman (Laura Stone), and sinks into a state of depression. She had previously traveled to Hawaii to find Skye, who fell into an active volcano. CBS Soaps In Depth reported that a distraught Sharon might commit suicide. After she is sentenced to life in prison Sharon claims she is ill, going to a bathroom where Adam hid a duffel bag for her escape. She overcomes an officer with chloroform, and escapes through a window. Adam has given her a false identification, a passport and cash. She stops at a gas station, where she dyes her hair brunette and changes into a revealing outfit. (Case said that although the storyline was fun, she disliked being a brunette.) Later, Sharon is carjacked and her possessions stolen; the female carjacker dies after the car crashes. The body is identified as Sharon's, leaving her family and friends believing she died. Case (who wanted to do a Mr. & Mrs. Smith-type storyline) said that when Sharon became a fugitive, she had her chance. The actress enjoyed playing the \\"aggressive\\" side of Sharon when she attacked the prison guard. After escaping from Genoa City, Sharon then lives under the pseudonym of Sheri Coleman for several months in New Mexico. While there she seduces Sam Gibson (Sean Patrick Flanery), who lets her stay at his farm; she bonds with the barn animals and a young local girl named Piper. Case said that although she hoped the \\"recklessness\\" of her character would continue, she found Sharon's storyline with Sam, Piper and the animals \\"really beautiful\\". Case hoped the story would take a different route, where she could meet Adam on the run and create a Bonnie and Clyde scenario. Head writer Maria Arena Bell dedicated the 4th of July episode to Sharon, stating that the episode would \\"shed more light on Sharon and all the factors that caused her to be in this situation, why she's acted the way she has and why she's gone into the pit of [low] self-esteem.\\" Case noted that she wanted to show viewers why Sharon is in the place she's in, as well as examine her life over the years during the episode. Jae' Jones of Yahoo! analyzed the storyline in anticipation of Sharon's homecoming, hoping that Nick, Adam and Noah would not forgive her because of all the \\"unforgivable things\\" she has done (especially her devious move of letting them believe she was dead). Jones further said: \\"Some will say she did what she thought she had to do. Even though it seemed as if it was easy, it's never that easy to walk away from the people you love\\". In July 2011, Sharon is arrested in New Mexico, and returned to Genoa City to serve her life sentence. Case said that although she was happy to be at the barn because it was \\"relaxing\\", she became restless as an actor and was glad her character was returning home. Sharon's actions do have repercussions: Nick is immensely angry with her, and Adam dumps her for sleeping with Sam. In November 2011 (almost a year after the accident at the volcano), evidence of Sharon's innocence surfaces and she is acquitted. = Mental health issues = In 2009, Sharon suffers from kleptomania (an impulse- control disorder), causing her to steal items from people and stores. As a result, she is forced to admit herself into a psychiatric hospital while she is pregnant. Case told TV Guide that all the character's \\"craziness\\" made sense; she welcomed the challenge to decide how functional Sharon appears to viewers and got into debates with directors. Michael Fairman noted that Sharon is \\"acting so bizarre\\". Case said her breakdown was due (in part) to Brad Carlton's death and the breakdown in her marriage to Jack; each time Sharon mapped out her life, it is \\"torn to pieces\\". Sharon has since experienced periodic kleptomania. In 2012, after Victor disappears following his wedding to Sharon, she realizes she must be married to Victor for more than eight days to obtain his money. She then burns their prenuptial agreement after Nikki sends her a text from Victor's phone saying he has left her. Sharon decides to run his company (Newman Enterprises) in his absence. Case thought a scene where Sharon crashed a Newman board meeting was fun and different, confessing that she had wanted to play \\"this version of Sharon for years\\". As Victor's proxy she became CEO of the company, secretly aided by manipulative businessman Tucker McCall (Stephen Nichols). The stock price for Newman drops (with Tucker secretly buying stock). Case hoped the writers wouldn't go the typical route, where Victor would return and \\"wreak havoc on everyone\\". Sharon was labeled \\"Newman's Grim Reaper\\" by the media of Genoa City, leaving Nick and Victoria to regain the company from her clutches. They demonstrate her history of kleptomania to a court judge, forcing her to return to the psychiatric hospital for an evaluation (which she passes); she then returns to her position as CEO. Case called Sharon's return a \\"fun aspect of the story\\". Sharon continued to behave out of character; when she discovers that Victor is alive, she tells everyone he died after identifying a burned body which was not his (Case said that Sharon took advantage of the situation). At Victor's funeral Sharon wears white, nearly marrying Tucker afterwards. Victor then returns, expelling Sharon from his family, home and company. Despite her crimes, Sharon avoids prison. At this point, Aaron Hagey-MacKay of GlobalTV stated that Sharon was \\"crazy\\". Case enjoys playing Sharon as going off the rails, \\"you get to do a lot of interesting, challenging things as an actor\\". Case said she was unconcerned about the storyline because the writers had a plan to explain Sharon's behavior. New head writer Josh Griffith told TV Guide that the character would reach a \\"total mental breakdown\\", which would take her to the edge and beyond before being rebuilt. Griffith said the breakdown would help her find salvation, with a \\"stronger, more together, more evolved Sharon\\" emerging. Sharon breaks down at the main house of the Newman ranch, burning it down while under the influence of alcohol. Griffith stated that the damage Sharon has done to the Newman family is \\"physical, professional and emotional\\". After seeing a doctor, Sharon is diagnosed with bipolar disorder and begins treatment; however, she is alarmed after discovering she must take prescribed medication, possibly for the rest of her life. Case was happy with the outcome of the storyline, as were viewers of the show. In January 2013, she told Soap Opera Uncensored, \\"When Sharon battled her emotional problems, that also took a lot of work but in a different way. Playing someone who is bipolar is very exhausting but it worked out perfectly and explained all of Sharon‚Äôs past behavior. I applaud Josh for making that decision because I think it makes the most sense considering her history.\\" The actress in addition was pleased that she didn't have to continue justifying Sharon's questionable actions. In mid-2013, the paternity of Summer (now 18 years old) is questioned upon the revelation that Nick declared himself her father despite the initial paternity test being corrupt. Nick did this to fill the void left by Cassie's death. Sharon feels that Summer's birth and the affair between Nick and Phyllis ruined her destiny with him, so she makes the decision to change the results of another test undertaken by Nick; which revealed that he was in fact Summer's father. Following her controversially changing the results, Jack is believed by everyone to be Summer's father. The storyline received negative complaints from fans of the character. Speaking of the storyline, Case told On-Air On-Soaps that an unstable Sharon was trying to reverse the damage caused by Nick's affair with Phyllis. Phyllis overhears Sharon confessing to altering the test results; a fight between the two women in a stairwell results in Phyllis falling down the stairs and slipping into a coma. In a February 2014 \\"super-secret plot twist\\", it was revealed that Victor had hired a Cassie doppelganger to haunt Sharon, who has been known to see visions of her deceased daughter while she was off her bipolar medication. Camryn Grimes (who is playing the Cassie lookalike) stated that Victor and Fake Cassie's \\"initial plan\\" was to make Nick believe Sharon was \\"nuts and seeing ghosts\\" so that he would not reunite with her. However, \\"then they find out Sharon has an explosive secret ‚Äî one Victor can really use\\", that being the secret of Summer's paternity, which Sharon no longer recalls due to recent ECT treatment having resulted in memory loss. =Baby Sully= In 2015, Sharon begins a new relationship with Nick's other brother, Dylan McAvoy (Steve Burton), and becomes pregnant with his child. However, she suffers a miscarriage and does not tell him, instead checking into Fairview Sanitarium; Case was disappointed when she heard that the character would be returning to the psychiatric facility. Case explained that Sharon was \\"feeling insecure at the time about her [relationship]. She was trying to build her relationship with Dylan and wasn't sure if he really wanted to be with her or if it was just because of the baby.\\" The actress also commented that Sharon did not want \\"Dylan to go through what he went through before\\", having lost children previously. While in Fairview, Sharon encounters her psychiatrist Dr. Anderson (Elizabeth Bogush), who in actuality is Sandra \\"Sandy\\" Allen, a woman seeking revenge on Nick for a diving accident during their high school years which left her paralyzed. At first, Case was not aware of Dr. Anderson's true identity, until she finally asked Bogush about her character. Dr. Anderson tells Sharon (who had been trying to conceive again) that she is pregnant, although in reality is drugging Sharon into experiencing a phantom pregnancy. Case said that she was \\"up for anything\\" upon learning that Sharon would be drugged. That November, Dr. Anderson presents Christian, the kidnapped newborn son of Nick's wife Sage Newman (Kelly Sullivan), to Sharon as her own child. Sharon, who does not remember giving birth, nevertheless accepts that the baby is hers, and names him Sully. Case noted that \\"from Sharon's point of view, this woman pulled off a miracle. And that's why she trusts her so much.\\" Meanwhile, Nick and Sage are led to believe that their baby had died. After experiencing memories of her stay at Fairview and suspicions about the birth of \\"Sully\\", Sharon ultimately pieces together the truth about Christian in April 2016. Dyan's aunt Patty Williams (Stacy Haiduk), who had been residing in Fairview at the time, informs Sharon that she never gave birth; Sharon conducts a DNA test and learns that \\"Sully\\" is really Christian. Shortly after, Sage discovers the truth herself and confronts Sharon, but ends up dying in a car accident. Sharon then decides to continue raising \\"Sully\\" as her own, not wanting to destroy her family with Dylan. She has nightmares of Sage and begins seeing her ghost, and briefly decides to stop taking her medication in order to \\"stay in control\\". Sharon tells nobody else besides Mariah the truth; Case enjoyed building Sharon and Mariah's mother/daughter relationship in the process of the storyline, observing that \\"they are each others confidantes, and they have each others back\\". Sharon confesses the truth to Nick about \\"Sully\\" in November 2016, after Patty told Nick herself that Christian is alive. Case noted that the fallout to Sharon's lies are \\"even bigger than she fears\\", as she had \\"been on pins and needles for months\\". She also wants to protect Mariah, who has now become \\"guilty by association\\". The scandal revolving around Sharon and \\"Sully\\" breaks on the television show GC Buzz, with Case stating: \\"Sharon always knew the truth would come out. She was just trying to adjust her mind and heart to the inevitability, even though she was only making things worse.\\" Despite her crime, Case also described Sharon as a victim, and contended that this was not the worst thing Sharon has done. After losing Christian to Nick, Sharon decides to fight for a place in his life. CBS Soaps In Depth wrote that her frustration over no one willing to understand her \\"is what finally lights a tiny flame of defiance deep inside Sharon\\". According to Case, \\"Sharon is willing to do anything for her child. She's fighting for what she believes is right.\\" Storylines Born on June 20, 1974, Sharon Collins grew up in Madison, Wisconsin. Having been abandoned by her father, she lived with her mother, Doris Collins (Karen Hensel), who was confined to a wheelchair after chasing a rebellious Sharon years earlier. Sharon became pregnant by high- school boyfriend Frank Barritt (Phil Dozois), but gave the child up for adoption. In 1994, 18-year-old Sharon arrives in Genoa City and begins attending a local high school. She meets Nick Newman (son of wealthy tycoon Victor Newman), who is dating Amy Wilson (Julianne Morris). Nick falls in love with Sharon, despite Sharon's ex-boyfriend Matt Clark's (Eddie Cibrian) attempts to win her back. Nick and Sharon briefly separate after Matt exposes Sharon's secret about her motherhood at 16, but they reunite shortly afterwards. An angry Matt later rapes Sharon in his car, traumatizing her. Nick and Sharon become engaged; she tells him about the rape, which leads him to avenge Matt. Matt is shot, and Nick is the chief suspect. He is convicted and acquitted several months later, when Amy confesses to the shooting. After Matt leaves town, Nick and Sharon marry; to hold on to Nick, Sharon stops using birth control and becomes pregnant. Nick complains that he is unready for fatherhood; Sharon nearly has an abortion, but he stops her. In 1997, she gives birth to Noah Newman, who nearly dies after his premature birth. While Noah was critically ill Sharon's best friend (Grace Turner) tracks down the child Sharon gave birth to as a teenager (Cassie) and brings her to Genoa City, believing Cassie would lessen the pain if Noah died. Noah survives, and Grace decides to raise Cassie as her own; however, her plans are foiled when Nick and Sharon win custody. Nick had cheated on Sharon with Grace (which nearly ended his and Sharon's marriage), but the custody battle for Cassie reunited them. In 2001, Matt (Rick Hearst) returns to town after plastic surgery with a false identity, Carter Mills. He rapes Sharon, and his true identity is revealed when he dies after driving off a cliff. Sharon becomes pregnant, with Matt possibly the father of her child. During an argument with Nick Sharon trips and falls, giving birth to a stillborn baby girl. After a paternity test, Nick is revealed to be the baby's father. Sharon finds solace with the Newman ranch's handyman Diego Guittierez (Greg Vaughan), who had been dating Nick's sister Victoria, and her infidelity results in a breakup with Nick. Nick later sees Sharon kissing Victor, which leaves Sharon humiliated and depressed. She leaves town and meets Cameron Kirsten; they begin an affair, and he brutally abuses her. Sharon returns to Genoa after her injuries heal, but is horrified when Cameron comes to town on business with Newman Enterprises. She briefly believes that she killed him, but he is later tracked down and jailed for his crimes. Sharon becomes restless as a housewife, and wants to become a stripper; Nick gives her a job at spokesperson for Jabot Cosmetics to occupy her. In 2005, Cassie dies in a car accident after driving without a license. While Sharon is grieving, Nick cheats on her with Phyllis Summers and Sharon has a one-night stand with Victoria's husband, Brad Carlton. Nick and Sharon divorce, after eleven years of marriage, when Phyllis becomes pregnant with Nick's baby. Sharon dates Phyllis' ex, Jack Abbott, and they eventually marry. Phyllis discovers Sharon's affair with Brad, and blackmails her. During a cliffside photo shoot Phyllis threatens to tell Jack about the affair, triggering a fight. Sharon and her best friend Drucilla Winters (Victoria Rowell) fall from the cliff, and Drucilla dies. Sharon is found apparently dead, but she is revived. Nick is later presumed dead after his plane crashes; he returns with amnesia (thinking he is still married to Sharon), regains his memory and returns to Phyllis. Jack, Phyllis, Nick and Sharon develop a magazine, Restless Style; however, clashes among the four drive Jack and Sharon from the company. In October 2008, Sharon and Nick meet in Paris; they kiss on a bridge, and Phyllis sees them. Sharon divorces Jack because his dishonesty; she and Nick make love at the Abbott cabin. Confused, Sharon spirals out of control; she develops kleptomania and has a brief affair with Jack's brother, Billy (Billy Miller). Sharon becomes pregnant; Nick goes back and forth between her and Phyllis, choosing Phyllis when Sharon lies about Jack being the father of the child. After being arrested for larceny a second time, Sharon checks herself into Fairview sanitarium (a psychiatric hospital) when her kleptomania becomes uncontrollable. She gives birth to a baby girl, Faith, who is stolen by Adam Newman (Nick's brother) and given to Jack's sister Ashley (Eileen Davidson) after he caused her miscarriage and hysterical pregnancy. Believing her baby is dead, Sharon grows close to Adam (who bonds with her out of guilt). Sharon and Adam are married, but when the truth about Faith is revealed the marriage ends. Several months later, Sharon shoots Adam when he tries to visit her at the Abbott cabin (mistaking him for a burglar); he survives. Nick and Sharon briefly reunite, but break up again when she cheats on him with Adam (who follows her to New Orleans). Adam is convicted for the murder of his ex-wife, Skye Newman (Laura Stone). Sharon tries to help him, but is arrested for murder after finding Skye in Hawaii (where Skye fell into a volcano). After escaping and returning (after several months of being thought dead), Sharon is acquitted. She then dedicates herself to Victor, who is in jail protecting Nikki from a murder charge. Victor marries Sharon platonically to protect his assets, although the marriage is annulled two weeks later. Adam is believed to be permanently blind after an attack by Patty Williams, and Sharon helps him recover. They reunite, but more of his past schemes are revealed. After another nervous breakdown and a diagnosis of bipolar disorder (which made her remarry Victor and take over Newman Enterprises), Sharon is re-hired at Newman as vice president for research and development. Adam is shot saving Victor's life; before slipping into a coma he asks Sharon, his closest friend, to run Newman Enterprises. Sharon again becomes CEO of the company, angering the Newman's. She leaves the company upon Victor's return to run the company with Adam. Victor forces Adam, who is engaging in a sexual relationship with Sharon, to stop seeing her. In 2013, it is revealed that the test conducted to determine Summer's paternity was inconclusive, which Nick kept a secret. Sharon, who now wants Nick back, tampers with the test results, allowing everyone to believe Jack is Summer's father. Phyllis hears Sharon confessing to this at Cassie's grave, resulting in an altercation between the two and ending with Phyllis falling down a flight of stairs, and into a coma. Noah discovers that Sharon is off her medication, attributing to her erratic behavior. Sharon realizes that she needs help, and soon begins taking new medication. She is hired by Jabot Cosmetics to mentor younger models. Sharon later undergoes electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) to stop experiencing visions of Cassie; which in reality is a Cassie lookalike named Mariah Copeland (Camryn Grimes) hired by Victor to haunt her. After the ECT, Sharon loses her memories of switching Summer's paternity results and witnessing Phyllis fall. By this point, Nick and Sharon have resumed their romantic relationship. After Victor's gaslighting of Sharon is exposed, Sharon becomes drawn to Mariah; inviting her to live with her family and having Nick hire her for a job at his club. Sharon throws Mariah out after realizing that Mariah has been trying to seduce Nick away from her. Simultaneously, Nick does some investigating and discovers that Mariah is Cassie's twin sister, and Sharon had no knowledge of giving birth to twins. Soon, Nick and Sharon are engaged; but their wedding is interrupted by a now awakened Phyllis (Gina Tognoni), who walks in and collapses. Later, Phyllis makes Sharon remember switching the test, and her engagement to Nick ends. A furious Nick sues Sharon for full custody of Faith and wins. In early 2015, Sharon is framed and arrested for the murders of Austin Travers (Matthew Atkinson) and Noah's fianc√©e Courtney Sloane (Kelli Goss), but acquitted due to lack of evidence. During this period, Dylan McAvoy (Steve Burton) becomes her confidant and the two start a romantic relationship. Sharon becomes pregnant with Dylan's child but suffers a miscarriage, and attempts to conceive again rather than tell him. After skipping her medication once again, Sharon returns to Fairview for treatment. There, she is drugged by Dr. Anderson (Elizabeth Bogush) into experiencing a false pregnancy. Dr. Anderson kidnaps what was believed to be Nick's baby with Sage Newman (Kelly Sullivan), Christian, and presents him to Sharon as her own. Sharon believes she has given birth to a son, who she names Sullivan \\"Sully\\" McAvoy. After being discharged from Fairview, Sharon marries Dylan before Christmas 2015. In early 2016, following Dr. Anderson's murder, both Sharon and Sage discover the truth about Sully being Christian. After Sage is killed in a car accident, Sharon continues raising Christian as her own, telling nobody aside from Mariah the truth. Months later, her secret is exposed and Christian is returned to Nick's custody. Soon after, Dylan goes undercover and is forced into the federal witness protection program. In order to help conceal Dylan's true identity Sharon agrees to tell everyone he left due to the stress of finding out Sully had died and she lied about Christian's identity. Sharon resumes ownership of the coffeehouse Crimson Lights, which was left to her by Dylan, and decides to return to university by enrolling at Genoa City University (GCU). With her marriage to Dylan over, she begins dating Scotty Grainger (Daniel Hall), but the relationship ends when he cheats on her with Abby (Melissa Ordway). In early 2018, Sharon learns that Christian is actually Adam's son, a fact Chelsea Lawson (Melissa Claire Egan) and Victor had kept hidden. After being assaulted by Chelsea in an attempt to borrow time, Sharon ultimately tells Nick the truth about Christian's paternity. Nick moves back into Sharon's place and they soon get back together. In the midst of this, Sharon witnesses Nikki killing J.T. Hellstrom (Thad Luckinbill) in defense of Victoria, which she agrees to hide from everyone including Nick. Sharon assumes a maternal role in Christian's life, but Victor uses her history of mental illness to win temporary custody of Christian. Nick and Sharon subsequently become engaged again. Nick is briefly under the impression that Sharon ended their engagement, and sleeps with Phyllis. Meanwhile, Sharon graduates with a degree in psychology, and shortly thereafter is hired at the GCPD as a victim's liaison by Rey Rosales (Jordi Vilasuso). On the day of their wedding, Sharon learns about Nick's one night stand with Phyllis and dumps him at the altar. She soon develops feelings for Rey, and confesses the truth about J.T.'s death to him in early 2019. Along with Victoria and Nikki, Sharon is arrested and sentenced to prison for covering up J.T.'s murder, but all are acquitted when it emerges that J.T. is alive. Sharon then begins a romance with Rey. She tries to build a new life with the Detective, when she finds out that Adam is still alive. Victor wants Sharon to use their old connection to bring Adam, who's been living in Las Vegas without any memory of his life, back to Genoa City. Adam slowly regains his memory and fights Nick for custody of Christian. Sharon gets once again caught up in Adam's schemes, which causes problems in her relationship with Rey. Shortly after Rey calls it quits, Sharon ends up in bed with Adam. In 2020, Sharon was diagnosed with breast cancer. Reception  =Characterization and criticism= Despite her crimes and faults, Global TV describes Sharon as a central heroine who has endured many challenges to get to where she is. She is considered a fan favorite on the soap opera, but also a \\"love-her-or-hate-her character\\", and has divided viewer opinions. In an early observation of the character, Kathleen Sloan of the Toronto Star noted that Sharon's \\"angelic demeanor\\" could mask a \\"devil in disguise\\". Tommy Garrett of Canyon News describes Sharon as an \\"ever-suffering heroine, who can't find a break in life\\", stating that she has \\"faced it all\\". In 2009, Luke Kerr of Daytime Confidential noted that all of Sharon's love interests‚Äîincluding Jack, Brad and Nicholas‚Äî\\"seem to think\\" that she is \\"the perfect woman\\". Jamey Giddens (also from Daytime Confidential) described her as soap operas' \\"hottest mess\\". Case herself opined that Sharon was a damsel in distress and \\"wasn't very colorful\\", which is why the writers chose to have her do \\"bad things\\" over the years. Former head writer Charles Pratt, Jr. likened Sharon's story to The Perils of Pauline (1914). During Maria Arena Bell's tenure as executive producer and head writer, the character's storyline underwent a change in creative direction, inciting unfavorable reviews. Bell had promised to make the character into a \\"stronger woman\\", but Jillian Bowe of Daytime Confidential criticized Bell for not living up to her pledge: \\"Has transforming Sharon into a promiscuous, recovering kleptomaniac, who never considers what her sexual choices will mean for her children, really made her stronger in [Bell]'s eyes?\\" She also contended that the beloved character was being \\"utterly assassinated, via one ill-conceived storyline and/or romance after another\\". Michael Logan of TV Guide noted that the character turned from heroine to a \\"psycho slut-nut\\" when she's \\"not channeling Joan Crawford in the Pepsi board room.\\" Another writer from Daytime Confidential praised Case for giving \\"one wonky storyline after another\\" her best efforts in a character that was \\"once beloved\\" but had been \\"royally assassinated\\". A September 2012 scene (in which Sharon wore white to husband Victor's funeral) was described by co-star Joshua Morrow as \\"one of the best and funniest scenes\\" in the show's history. Tommy Garrett of Canyon News wrote, \\"Maria Bell knows that consummate actress Sharon Case plays the consummate heroine Sharon Newman with aplomb.\\" By the end of 2012, Aaron Hagey-MacKay of Global TV compared the \\"tortured soul\\" of Sharon to the character Nicole Walker on Days of Our Lives, writing: \\"Who had it worse this year, Sharon or Nicole?\\" Following the character's diagnosis with bipolar disorder, her switching Summer's paternity test was heavily criticized by critics, who felt that the character still had not been repaired. About.com listed the paternity twist as one of the worst storylines of 2013 on the soap opera. Mental health advocate Arthur Gallant of The Huffington Post commended the show's initial portrayal of Sharon's bipolar disorder, writing: \\"I praise the writers for their diligence in how mental illness has been depicted and feel the show has done their part in helping to eliminate mental health stigma.\\" Sara Bibel of Xfinity slammed Josh Griffith's writing, stating that he \\"undid all his great work rehabilitating the character of Sharon\\" in a \\"character-destroying\\" storyline. Garrett (writing for Highlight Hollywood this time) was livid with then-executive producer Jill Farren Phelps, who he labeled as a female misogynist, and strongly opposed to Sharon being turned into a villain \\"with no good reason\\". Soap Opera Digest named the character of Sharon as the \\"Most Ruined\\" soap opera character in both 2012 and 2013, while in turn praising the performance of Case. In December 2014, Daytime Confidential described Sharon as one of the most \\"drastically damaged\\" characters in the history of the soap opera genre, and wrote, \\"You name it, one head writer or another has had her do it. Kleptomania. Three baby daddies. Bipolar disorder. It was almost like a reward was passed out in the Y&R; writing room anytime anyone came up with something more awful to have Sharon do.\\" Giddens criticized Charles Pratt Jr. in 2015 for enjoying writing Sharon as \\"crazy\\", \\"despite legions of fans demanding the bipolar character be given back her dignity\\". Writing for TV Insider, Michael Logan said in 2016 that fans of the character were tired of seeing her written as \\"the liar, the villain, the nutcase, the doormat\\". =Romances= The relationship between Sharon and Nick relationship is popular with viewers, and they are considered a prominent soap-opera supercouple. The pair are known by the portmanteau \\"Shick\\" in social media. Kim Potts of The Huffington Post ranked Nick and Sharon 16th on a list of \\"Greatest Soap Opera Supercouples\\". Potts observed that although they have not become \\"enduring love\\", a reunion is \\"always a possibility\\". Upon their anticipated reunion in February 2009, the show gained an average of 447,000 viewers, boosting it to nearly 5.7 million viewers and a 4.0 household rating. The couple were nominated for \\"Best Chemistry\\" at the CBS Fan Awards for 2014. Sharon's romance with Adam has also gained a fan following, and they are known as \\"Shadam\\" in social media. The couple are perceived as \\"showing us the many shades of love. In this case, mostly dark\\", according to SoapNet. The show gained 115,000 viewers after their reunion in December 2010. In 2012, Sharon's romance with Victor was the source of disapproval from actors, critics and viewers. Of the relationship, journalist Michael Fairman said it \\"hasn‚Äôt worked out or caught fire through the writing, or with the fans watching on-screen!\\" Several cast members expressed negative opinions about the relationship, and Daytime Confidential placed Sharon and Victor atop its \\"Worst Soap Opera Couples\\" list for that year. =Portrayal= Case has received a number of honors for her portrayal of Sharon, including Daytime Emmy Award nominations in 1996 and 1997 for Outstanding Younger Actress. At the Soap Opera Digest Awards in 1998, she won the Hottest Female Star award. In 1999 she won a Daytime Emmy Award for Outstanding Supporting Actress in a Drama Series, her first nomination in that category; she was nominated for the same category in 2000 and 2004. At the 2003 Soap Opera Digest Awards, Case received an Outstanding Supporting Actress nomination. That year, she won an Australian TV Soap Golden Boomerang Award for Younger Female Star. Dan J. Kroll of Soap Central noted that it had \\"widely been expected\\" that Morrow and Case would receive nominations for Outstanding Leading Actress and Actor at the 33rd Daytime Emmy Awards, calling these \\"surprising oversights\\". In January 2011, a Daytime Emmy Awards \\"final push\\" by Canyon News suggested that Case's performance needed more Emmy attention. Soap Opera Digest praised Phyllis finding the evidence that freed Sharon from prison in 2011, writing: \\"The twist that Phyl hijacked the glory from both Adam and estranged sister Avery was downright delicious‚Äîand made Sharon beholden her worst enemy. The cherry on top? Sharon giving Adam an overdue verbal beatdown. Justice has finally been served.\\" Case's performance in 2012, described as a \\"whirlwind year\\", was met with critical acclaim due to writing by Bell (which, in turn, was criticized). On-Air On-Soaps commented, \\"Surviving probably one of the worst on-screen character assassinations in soap opera history, which virtually left viewers wondering, what the heck are the writers doing to the integrity of Sharon Newman, the once befallen heroine of Genoa City?, Case rebounded by making her performances noteworthy, no matter what the creative teams decided to do to her character.\\" This led Soap Opera Uncensored to name her Entertainer of the Year in January 2013. In December 2015, Soap Opera Digest praised her portrayal of the character's \\"emotional roller coaster\\" and remarked, \\"Sharon Case has a knack for bringing emotional depth and reality to even the most outrageously soapy situations\\". In other media Sharon Newman is featured on the cover of the book You Know Your Life is a Soap Opera If... (2007) by author Gerry Waggett. In November 2014, the character appeared in a comedic skit on the HBO television program Last Week Tonight with John Oliver.

Its studios are located at the combined Entercom Pittsburgh facility in the Foster Plaza on Holiday Drive in Green Tree, and its transmitter site is at Allison Park. The station's programming is also carried over KDKA-FM's 93.7 HD2 digital subchannel\\"HD Radio Guide\\" (Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania) (hdradio.com) and, beginning November 2, 2020, will be simulcast on FM translator station 100.1 W261AX.http://www.talkers.com October 19, 2020 KDKA features a news/talk format. Operating with a transmitter power output of 50,000 watts, the station can be heard during daylight hours throughout central and western Pennsylvania, along with portions of the adjacent states of Ohio, West Virginia and New York, plus the southwesternnmost part of the Canadian province of Ontario. Its nighttime signal covers much of eastern North America. KDKA has described itself as the \\"Pioneer Broadcasting Station of the World\\",\\"It Started Hear\\", KDKA promotional pamphlet, 1970, page 1. (worldradiohistory.com) and traces its beginning, initially using the temporarily assigned \\"special amateur\\" call sign of 8ZZ, to its broadcast of the 1920 Harding-Cox presidential election results on the evening of November 2, 1920. History Although KDKA's history has been extensively reviewed, there are some inconsistencies between accounts, leading one researcher to note: \\"While the KDKA story is often recounted, the details tend to vary slightly both in the secondary source material and in the published recollections of the participants, including differences in the chronology of events and the relative importance of the parties involved.\\"\\"Battle of the Brains: Election Night Forecasting at the Dawn of the Computer Age\\" (dissertation) by Ira Chinoy, 2010, page 137 (umd.edu) =Initial point-to- point service license= KDKA's establishment was an outgrowth of the post- World War I efforts of the Westinghouse Electric and Manufacturing Company of East Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, to expand its commercial operations in the radio industry. During the war, Westinghouse received government contracts to develop radio transmitters and receivers for military use. They used recently developed vacuum tube equipment that was capable of audio communication. Previous spark gap transmitters could only be used to transmit the dots-and- dashes of Morse code. At the time of the entry of the United States into World War I in April 1917, the government ordered all civilian radio stations off the air. However, during the conflict Westinghouse received permission to operate research radio transmitters located at its East Pittsburgh plant and at the home of one of its lead engineers, Frank Conrad, in nearby Wilkinsburg.\\"The Early History of Broadcasting in the United States\\" by H. P. Davis, included in The Radio Industry: The Story of Its Development, 1928, pages 191-192. Harry P. Davis, Westinghouse vice president and founder of KDKA With the end of the war, the government contracts were canceled. However, Westinghouse moved aggressively to establish itself as a national and international provider of radio communication. Its primary competitor in this effort was the Radio Corporation of America (RCA), which had recently been formed as a subsidiary by Westinghouse's arch rival, the General Electric Company of Schenectady, New York, using the assets of the Marconi Company of America. The effort to establish Westinghouse's radio industry presence was led by company vice president H. P. Davis.Finding Aid for the Harry Phillips Davis Collection, 1915-1944, AIS.1964.21, Archives Service Center, University of Pittsburgh (library.pitt.edu) In order to strengthen the company's patent position, especially related to receivers, he spearheaded the purchase of the International Radio Telegraph Company, primarily to gain control of a \\"heterodyne\\" patent originally issued to Reginald Fessenden, and also arranged for the purchase of the commercial rights to the regenerative and superheterodyne patents held by Edwin Howard Armstrong. However, because of the competitive advantage RCA had in international and marine communications, initially there appeared to be limited opportunities available to Westinghouse.History of Radio to 1926 by Gleason L. Archer, 1938, pages 193-197. Although it would gain its fame as a broadcasting station, KDKA actually originated as part of a project to establish private radiotelegraph links between Westinghouse's East Pittsburgh factory and its other facilities, to avoid the business expense of paying for telegraph and telephone lines. In September 1920, a newspaper report noted that \\"a new high-power station, to operate under a special or commercial license, is being installed at the Westinghouse plant in East Pittsburgh. It will be used to establish communication between the East Pittsburgh plant and the company branch factories at Cleveland, O., Newark, N. J., and Springfield, Mass., where similar outfits will be employed.\\"The Radio Amateur by C. E. Urban, Pittsburgh Gazette Times, September 26, 1920, Fifth section, page 10. An application, signed by H. P. Davis, was submitted to the Eighth District Radio Inspector, S. W. Edwards in Detroit, who forwarded it to Washington, and on October 27, 1920, Westinghouse was issued a Limited Commercial station license, serial #174, with the identifying call letters of KDKA.First KDKA license: October 27, 1920 (Limited Commercial license, serial #174, issued to the Westinghouse Electric and Manufacturing Company in East Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania for a one year period.) This Limited Commercial grant was consistent with the standard practice being followed at this time, for licenses issued to companies engaging in private radio communication. Neither KDKA's original application, nor the resulting license, mentioned broadcasting, only that the station was to be used for radiotelegraphic communication with stations located at the Westinghouse facilities in Cleveland, Newark and Springfield, plus station WCG in Brooklyn, New York, which was operated by the recently acquired International Radio Telegraph.The copy of the initial KDKA license on file at the National Archives has a handwritten notation \\"First broadcasting licensee\\" written across the front, but this appears to have been added at a later date. At this time, radio stations in the United States were regulated by the Department of Commerce's Bureau of Navigation. Beginning with the introduction of licensing in late 1912, the standard practice had been to assign call letters starting with \\"W\\" to radio stations east of the Mississippi River. However, KDKA happened to receive its assignment during a short period during which land stations were being issued call letters from a sequential block of \\"K\\" call letters that had previously been assigned only to ship stations. Although the original policy was restored a few months later, KDKA was permitted to keep its non-standard call sign.The temporary switch to four- letter \\"K\\" call signs for new land station grants is documented by the monthly issues of the Commerce Department's Radio Service Bulletin. Through the June 1920 issue, non-government land station grants generally received three-letter K or W calls. But for the July 1920 through May 1921 issues, these stations now primarily received four-letter K calls, including KDKA, which appeared in the November 1920 issue. The June 1921 issue records a return to the original policy of primarily three-letter calls, with \\"K\\" in the west, and \\"W\\" in the east. =Addition of a broadcasting service= Photograph of the 9th floor KDKA transmission room. c. 1921 Shortly after beginning the process of setting up KDKA to be used for point-to-point communication, a series of events occurred which resulted in it also becoming a broadcasting station, which would overshadow its original role. Prior to World War I, Frank Conrad had operated an experimental radiotelegraph station, with the callsign 8XK.The \\"8\\" in 8XK's call sign indicated that the station was in the 8th Radio Inspection district, while the \\"X\\" signified that it was operating under an experimental license. Following the war, the U.S. government again allowed the operation of civilian radio stations, and Conrad revived 8XK, which was located in a detached two-story garage at his residence. He used the knowledge gained during the wartime period to upgrade his station to begin making audio transmissions, and became well known among radio amateurs for his experimental activities.\\"Amateur Radio Stations: 8XK Pittsburgh\\", QST magazine, September 1920, pages 32-34. On October 17, 1919 Conrad made the first of what would become a semi-regular series of entertainment broadcasts.\\"The Radio Amateur\\" by C. E. Urban, \\"Wireless Telephone Here\\", Pittsburgh Gazette Times, October 26, 1919, Sixth section, page 13. During this time the Joseph Horne department store ran daily full-page advertisements in the Pittsburgh papers, and, in its September 23, 1920 placement, stated that the store had started selling \\"Amateur Wireless Sets\\" for \\"$10 upwards\\".\\"The Horne Daily News\\" (advertisement), Pittsburgh Press, September 23, 1920, page 13. Six days later, the store's September 29 installment included a small notice titled \\"Air Concert 'Picked Up' By Radio Here\\", which noted that its demonstration set had been used to receive one of the Conrad broadcasts.\\"The Horne Daily News\\" (advertisement), Pittsburgh Press, September 29, 1920, page 11. H. P. Davis saw this advertisement and immediately recognized the \\"limitless opportunity\\" of adding radio receivers to the lines of appliances sold to the general public by Westinghouse,\\"Pittsburgh's Contributions to Radio\\" by S. M. Kintner, Proceedings of the Institute of Radio Engineers, December 1932, pages 1849-1862. and in order to create demand for the receivers, he decided that Westinghouse should provide regular programming as an incentive for persons considering a purchase. Davis held a staff meeting with his \\"radio cabinet\\" and asked them to have a station operational in time to broadcast the presidential and local election returns on November 2, 1920. Election return broadcasts had been a tradition since shortly after the development of radio, although due to technical limitations initially they could only be done using Morse code, which greatly limited the potential audiences.Examples of election results sent in Morse code for the 1912 U.S. Presidential election included \\"Local Wireless Men Pick Up Much News\\" (Pittsburgh Press, November 6, 1912, page 5, broadcast by the Tech Wireless Club station at Carnegie Technical School in Pittsburgh), \\"Harvard Wireless Club Gets Returns\\" (Boston Post, November 6, 1912, page 3, broadcast by the Charlestown, Massachusetts Navy Yard station), \\"Election News is Sent by Wireless\\" (Idaho Republican, November 8, 1912, page 1, broadcast by the Navy's Mare Island, California station) and \\"Wireless Gives Island Returns\\" (San Francisco Call, November 6, 1912, page 6, broadcast by the Federal Telegraph station at San Francisco). Following the development of vacuum-tube transmitters that made audio transmissions via Amplitude Modulation (AM) possible, the first spoken-word election night broadcast was made on November 7, 1916 by the DeForest Radio Telephone and Telegraph Company's station, 2XG, located in the Highbridge section of New York City, in conjunction with the New York American, announcing the results of the Wilson-Hughes presidential election.\\"Election Returns Flashed by Radio to 7,000 Amateurs\\", The Electrical Experimenter, January 1917, page 650. On August 31, 1920, the Detroit News, whose \\"Detroit News Radiophone\\" began making daily broadcasts on August 20, had broadcast local primary election results.\\"Land and Water Hear Returns by Wireless\\", Detroit News, September 1, 1920, page 1. That station operated under the amateur call sign of \\"8MK\\" and is now AM 950 WWJ. Westinghouse's preparations included the construction of a shack and antenna system on the roof of the nine story K Building at the East Pittsburgh Works in Turtle Creek, Pennsylvania. Frank Conrad had originally planned to broadcast the election results over 8XK, in cooperation with the American Radio Relay League, but shifted his efforts to help with the Westinghouse broadcast. He and Donald G. Little had primary responsibility for constructing a 100 watt vacuum-tube transmitter. A telephoned temporary authorization was received to operate under the call sign of 8ZZ.A Tower in Babel by Erik Barnouw, 1966, page 69. (The first \\"Z\\" in this call sign indicated it was a \\"Special Amateur\\" grant,\\"Amateur Radio Stations\\", Radio Stations of the United States (July 1, 1913 edition), pages 7-8: \\"The call letters for amateur stations in the United States... will consist of three items; number of the radio district; followed by two letters... The first letter will be:... Z [for] special amateur stations.\\" which was a classification that permitted the use of transmitting frequencies other than the congested 200 meter (1500 kHz) standard amateur wavelength.) Although the pre-broadcast publicity and contemporary accounts stated that 8ZZ was the call sign used for the election night broadcast ‚Äî for example, in 1922 L. R. Krumm, Westinghouse's Superintendent of Radio Operations, referred to Westinghouse's \\"station at East Pittsburgh, now known as KDKA, the matured successor of 8ZZ\\"\\"Development of Radiophone Broadcasting\\" by L. R. Krumm, Radio Age, July/August 1922, page 22. He additionally noted that \\"A special license was obtained from the government radio inspector in Detroit, Michigan, and the call letters 8ZZ were assigned to the station in the beginning.\\" Other early sources documenting the use of the 8ZZ call sign for the election night broadcast include an article titled \\"\\"KDKA\\" in the August 1922 The Wireless Age, which recounts that \\"Those words brought the now famous KDKA station into being, but little was thought then that the transmission of presidential election returns from this station, which was then known as 8ZZ, would result in the widespread interest in radio that is now present throughout the country\\"; another article also titled \\"KDKA\\", by D. G. Little in the June 1924 Proceedings of the Institute of Radio Engineers, which states that \\"The temporary calls first assigned were 8ZZ\\", and finally \\"Pittsburgh's Contributions to Radio\\" by S. M. Kintner (both Little and Kintner were engineers who helped set up the station for the election night broadcast), which appeared in the December 1932 issue of the Proceedings of the Institute of Radio Engineers, which reports that: \\"Conrad stayed at his home, prepared to shift over to his station, in the event of the failure of the East Pittsburgh Station, then known as '8ZZ'.\\" ‚Äî later reviews, including a 1930 re-creation of the original broadcast, often incorrectly state that the KDKA call sign was used during the debut broadcast.9XM Talking: WHA Radio and the Wisconsin Idea by Randall Davidson, 2007, page 321: \\"Audio clips from the 'first broadcast' using the KDKA call letters don't settle the question: they're all reenactments and have fooled many radio historians (some of these clips are also now on the Internet).\\" Extensive regional publicity by Westinghouse heralded the upcoming broadcast, both among technically knowledgeable amateur radio enthusiasts, plus, through the organization of public listening sites, toward a more general audience of potential future radio receiver purchasers. Promotional announcements described the offering as a joint effort between Westinghouse and its International Radio Telegraph subsidiary,\\"To Give Election Results by Radio\\", Cleveland Plain Dealer, October 28, 1920, page 10. and A. E. Braun, an International Radio Telegraph officer who was also the president of the Pittsburgh Post and Pittsburgh Sun, made the arrangements for his newspapers to provide election results to the station.Chinoy (2010) page 139. In the days before November 2 a series of test transmissions were made to check the equipment. The announcer for the election night broadcast was a publicity department staff member, Leo Rosenberg. Frank Conrad stood by at his home station,Contrary to some later accounts, Conrad's 8XK and Westinghouse's 8ZZ/KDKA were completely separate stations. Following KDKA's start Conrad made at least one more entertainment broadcast from his home over 8XK, on December 4, 1920 (\\"Wireless Concert\\", Monessen (Pennsylvania) Daily Independent, December 6, 1920, page 1), and continued to actively use the station for experimental work, until it was deleted on November 3, 1924. ready to take over using his 8XK transmitter if the East Pittsburgh transmitter failed, but the effort was successful, with one newspaper report noting that: \\"The returns by wireless telephone, which were transmitted from the Westinghouse international radio station at East Pittsburgh, were exceptionally clear and distinct. The service was utilized by many amateurs to entertain gatherings at their various stations. Between announcements of the returns radiophone music was transmitted, which added much to the entertainment.\\"The Radio Amateur by C. E. Urban, Pittsburgh Gazette Times, November 7, 1920, Section six, page 3. This Westinghouse broadcast was not unique ‚Äî that evening at least three other stations made audio transmissions of election returns, including the Detroit News \\"Detroit News Radiophone\\" service,\\"Screen, Radio Give Returns\\", Detroit News, November 3, 1920, pages 1-2. a temporary arrangement made by the Saint Louis Post- Dispatch in conjunction with William E. Woods of the Benwoods Company, \\"manufacturers and distributors of wireless outfits\\",\\"Wireless Phone Relays Returns of Post-Dispatch\\", Saint Louis Post-Dispatch, November 3, 1920, page 3. and the Buffalo Evening News, over an amateur station operated by Charles C. Klinck, Jr.\\"'News' Wireless Service on Election Wins Praise\\", Buffalo Evening News, November 4, 1920, page 2. Later station publicity proclaimed that Westinghouse's election night broadcast \\"was a national sensation, acclaimed by newspapers all over the country\\", however a comprehensive review of contemporary newspapers determined that reports, although positive, actually appeared only in a few local papers, thus it \\"was not an immediate 'sensation' and that the fame of this event developed over time with later celebratory accounts\\".Chinoy (2010) page 141. Although the election night broadcast was only heard by about 1,000 people, KDKA would eventually gain national prominence once it began to offer an extensive range of programming. After initially operating under the call sign 8ZZ ‚Äî apparently for just a few days, although the chronology is not completely clear ‚Äî the station switched to identifying itself as KDKA. Through the next month semiweekly broadcasts were made,\\"KDKA\\" by D. G. Little, Proceedings of the Institute of Radio Engineers, June 1924, page 155. until December 21, when the station embarked on an ambitious daily schedule,\\"KDKA\\", The Wireless Age, August 1922, page 40.\\"The Spread of Radio Broadcasting\\", Radio Broadcasting News, April 16, 1922, page 2: \\"Radio Broadcasting of regular programs was instituted by the Westinghouse Electric and Manufacturing Company December 21, 1920.\\" (worldradiohistory.com) initially for about an hour each evening. (Reflecting the December launch, the January 1, 1922 debut issue of Westinghouse's Radio Broadcasting News included the reference \\"Fifty-fourth week broadcasting\\".)Front page, Radio Broadcasting News, January 1, 1922, page 1 (worldradiohistory.com) KDKA soon gained a reputation as one of the premier broadcasting stations in the nation. On August 1, 1921 the transmitter was upgraded from 100 to 500 watts, and two months later saw an additional doubling, to 1,000 watts. The election night broadcast was transmitted on a wavelength of 550 meters (545 kHz). Later publicity stated that KDKA was now broadcasting on 330 meters (909 kHz), and in the fall of 1921 all the Westinghouse broadcasting stations began using 360 meters (833 kHz). In the United States there were no formal standards defining a broadcasting station until December 1, 1921, when the Department of Commerce issued a regulation specifying that stations making broadcasts intended for the general public now had to hold a Limited Commercial license that authorized operation on 360 meters or 485 meters (619 kHz).\\"Amendments to Regulations\\", Radio Service Bulletin, January 3, 1922, page 10. KDKA was one of a small number of stations that already met this standard at the time of its adoption, as its second year-long license, issued November 7, 1921, included the notation \\"360 meters for general broadcasting\\" in addition to continuing the point-to-point service authorization.Second KDKA license: November 7, 1921 (Limited Commercial license, serial #174, issued to the Westinghouse Electric and Manufacturing Company in East Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania for a one year period.) Encouraged by the success of KDKA, by the end of 1921 Westinghouse established stations in three additional major population centers, including WJZ in Newark, New Jersey (now WABC in New York City); WBZ, originally in Springfield, Massachusetts (now Boston); and KYW, originally in Chicago, Illinois (now Philadelphia). =The 1920s= As part of ongoing facility upgrades, this well-appointed studio went into service in December 1922. As a pioneer in radio broadcasting, KDKA struggled in particular with studio acoustics, especially for large groups of performers. An early attempt to broadcast a concert by Westinghouse employees from a local auditorium found that the sensitive microphones picked up echoes from the walls, causing severe distortion. Moving the performers outdoors eliminated the echoing, so a tent was erected on the building roof, and for a time concerts were performed from this location. Eventually the tent was blown down in a storm, so it was moved indoors, where it was found the tent material helped deaden the echoes. This led to modern studio design, including walls covered with noise-absorbing material, initially \\"monks cloth\\" (which turned out to be a fancy name for burlap).Davis (1928) pages 199-201. Early programming often featured live musical performances by a band composed of Westinghouse employees. The station provided its first remote broadcast on January 2, 1921, airing a religious service from Calvary Episcopal Church. The Calvary services soon became a regular Sunday evening offering, and were continued until 1962.\\"KDKA Made Religious Waves\\" by Dan Graves, MSL. (christianity.com) On January 15, 1921, at 8p.m., KDKA broadcast a speech on European relief by Herbert Hoover from the Duquesne Club in Pittsburgh, that was carried ten miles (sixteen kilometers) by a telephone line connection to Westinghouse's East Pittsburgh Works.\\"Hoover Speech via Wireless\\", Indiana (Pennsylvania) Evening Gazette, January 14, 1921, page 1. On July 2, 1921, RCA arranged to broadcast live, over temporary station WJY, the Jack Dempsey - Georges Carpentier heavyweight boxing match in New Jersey, with the company claiming that 300,000 persons listened to the WJY transmission. KDKA participated in the event by providing supplemental coverage west of WJY's range, as a KDKA announcer repeated the ringside commentary, after it had been relayed by telegraph by Westinghouse engineers who were listening to the WJY broadcast. KDKA's participation included six theaters where attendees were charged admission to hear the reports.\\"Voice-Broadcasting the Stirring Progress of the 'Battle of the Century' \\", The Wireless Age, August 1921, pages 11-21. On August 5, 1921, KDKA became the first radio station to broadcast a major league professional baseball game, when announcer Harold W. Arlin called the Pittsburgh Pirates-Philadelphia Phillies game from Forbes Field.\\"First Radio Broadcast of a Baseball Game\\" (digitaldeliftp.com) In the fall of that year, the station became the first to broadcast a college football game. In 1922, KDKA hosted political humorist Will Rogers in his first radio appearance. Initially KDKA had to share its 360-meter assignment with the other broadcasting stations that were established in the region, until May 15, 1923, when the Department of Commerce expanded the broadcasting frequency assignments into a band from 550 to 1350 kHz. Under this new plan 920 kHz was exclusively allocated to Pittsburgh, and KDKA was granted sole use of this frequency. In 1923, KDKA began simulcasting its broadcasts on shortwave, and for a while used this as a link for transmitting its programs for rebroadcast by station KFHX in Hastings, Nebraska, as part of an unsuccessful experiment to use shortwave signals instead of telephone lines to establish network connections.\\"Setting the Pace in Radio\\" by Jack Binns, Popular Science, July 1924, page 65. From 1923 to 1940, KDKA produced Northern Messenger, airing it over its shortwave radio sister station 8XS (later known as W8XK and WPIT). The program was broadcast over shortwave to the Far North during the winter months, when mail service was impossible, and consisted of personal messages to RCMP officers, missionaries, trappers, and others from family and friends, music, and news. The original financing plan, of using the revenues from radio receiver sales to pay station costs, proved to be insufficient for a number of reasons. Additional expenses included the requirement to pay royalties to musical composers, plus the fact that, unlike the amateur Westinghouse Company staff performers, professional acts started to expect to be paid in something more tangible than publicity. On the revenue side, Westinghouse found that it didn't have the near-monopoly for selling vacuum-tube receivers that it expected it had gotten through the purchase of the commercial rights to the Armstrong regenerative patent. Armstrong had previously sold \\"amateur and experimental\\" rights to around 17 small firms, which also began selling receivers to the general public. Westinghouse sued on the grounds that this went beyond their rights, but lost, which resulted in the formation of a series of major competitors, including Crosley and Zenith.Radio Manufacturers of the 1920s: Vol. 1 by Alan Douglas, 1988, page vi. Running over-the-air commercials was an obvious financing alternative, but initially Westinghouse officials were soundly against the idea, contending that it would destroy the listening experience. In 1922 J. C. McQuiston, from the Westinghouse Department of Publicity, declared that \\"if advertising were permitted, it goes without saying that all the good work that has been done in giving valuable information and pleasant entertainment for the people would be destroyed\\".\\"Advertising by Radio: Can It and Should It Be Done?\\" by J. C. McQuiston, Radio News, August 1922, pages 232, 332-334. In 1922, H. P. Davis suggested that the best solution was \\"five or six large, well-located and powerful stations\\" which \\"could be licensed, protected and organized... and that it would become a matter of such public value, that endowments or Federal subsidies would be possible which would assist those responsible for the service to carry it on and to continue the development and research required to get the most value out of it.\\"\\"Why Radiophone Broadcasting Should be Continued\\" (interview with H. P. Davis), Radio Service Supplement to the National Electragist, November 1922, pages 10-11. However, in 1928 he stated that he had realized \\"from the beginning\\" that advertising would be the ultimate financing solution.Davis (1928) page 223. Westinghouse, along with RCA and General Electric, was a co-founder in 1926 of the National Broadcasting Company (NBC), which created two national radio networks: the NBC Red Network and the NBC Blue Network. KDKA became affiliated with the Blue network, and with this change began selling airtime: up until now, the station had been commercial-free. KDKA played popular music and advertisers began sponsoring special radio programs like The Philco Hour, The Maxwell House Hour and The Wrigley Party. A general frequency reassignment under the provisions of newly formed Federal Radio Commission's General Order 40, effective November 11, 1928, led to KDKA being assigned to the \\"clear channel\\" frequency of 980 kHz. On January 1, 1929, the station inaugurated new studio facilities located in the William Penn Hotel,\\"KDKA Set to Sign Off and Move From Studios Atop William Penn\\" by S. H. Steinhauser, Pittsburgh Press, November 1, 1934, page 30. and on June 26 relocated its Master Control facilities to the hotel.\\"Studio Control\\", Pittsburgh Press, June 25, 1929, page 44. =1930s and '40s= KDKA microphone In 1932, as a result of antitrust proceedings, Westinghouse had to divest its 40% ownership stake of RCA and 20% ownership in NBC.\\"How GE Birthed NBC in 1926\\" by Bradley Johnson, December 7, 2009 (AdAge.com) At 7a.m. on November 2, 1934, the station's 14th birthday, KDKA inaugurated new studios in the Grant Building.\\"Engineers Test New KDKA Plant with Station Founder Listening\\" by S. H. Steinhauser, Pittsburgh Press, October 29, 1934, page 24. The William Penn Hotel studios later became the home of WCAE. In the 1930s, KDKA began the long-running (1932‚Äì1980) Uncle Ed Shaughency show. The station played popular big band and jazz music every morning as well as hosting the KDKA Farm Hour. From 1941 to 1959, the Farm Hour was built around farm reports along with music by Slim Bryant and his Wildcats, who eventually became the top local country music act in the Pittsburgh area. Special programming included ongoing coverage of the 1936 St. Patrick's Day flood that submerged downtown Pittsburgh as far as Wood Street. A final frequency change took place in March 1941, under the provisions of the North American Regional Broadcasting Agreement, as KDKA's clear channel assignment was shifted from 980 to 1020 kHz. In 1943, NBC was compelled by the U.S. government to divest itself of one of its two networks, which resulted in it selling the Blue network (which became the American Broadcasting Company). Prior to the sale KDKA swapped affiliations with KQV to become affiliated with the NBC-Red network. Also during this period, in 1942 it gained a sister station, W75P, on the then-new FM band, which later became KDKA-FM, changing to WPNT in 1979. This station was sold by Westinghouse in 1984, and is now WLTJ. In 1946, KDKA provided live coverage of the inauguration of David L. Lawrence as Pittsburgh Mayor, as well as the presidential and gubernatorial inaugurations. By the end of the decade, the musical and comedy team of Buzz Aston and Bill Hinds, billed as \\"Buzz & Bill\\", aired. =1950s= In the 1950s, Ed Shaughency was moved from mornings to the afternoon, losing his partner, Rainbow (Elmer Walters) in the process. Impressed with the success Rege Cordic was having at WWSW, KDKA hired him away, and Cordic started his KDKA run on Labor Day, 1954. The Cordic & Company morning show, featuring a team of bright and innovative personalities, was a pioneer of today's \\"morning team\\" radio format, but in an unconventional way. Cordic and his group played a small amount of music, but primarily provided entertainment through skits, including recurring characters such as \\"Louie The Garbageman\\" and space alien \\"Omicron\\". Cordic's crew included Karl Hardman and Bob Trow, later known for portraying \\"Bob Dog\\" and \\"Robert Troll\\" on Mister Rogers' Neighborhood. The 1950s saw a shift to more local programming, as the national radio shows were moving to television. Art Pallan, hired away from WWSW, and Bob Tracey became household names, playing the popular music of the day. For some years announcer Sterling Yates, also a musician, played hip, progressive jazz on a Sunday morning broadcast. On January 1, 1951, the married couple Ed and Wendy King launched Party Line, KDKA's first talk show, which ran until Ed King's death on November 18, 1971. Unlike most talk shows, callers were not heard, with the couple taking turns relaying the callers' information. In 1956 newsman Bill Steinbach began his 36-year career at the station ‚Äî within 10 years he was the anchor of the award-winning 90-to-6 news program. KDKA cautiously embraced rock and roll music, with artists such as Bill Haley, the Everly Brothers, Fats Domino, and Elvis Presley, in addition to popular vocalists including Frank Sinatra, Peggy Lee, and Canonsburg, Pennsylvania native Perry Como. However, the station's sound remained much more conservative than most Top 40 stations. In 1955, the station began regular broadcasts of Pirate baseball games, a partnership that ended in 2006, but was restarted in 2012 when KDKA-FM began carrying the games. KDKA gained a television sister station in late 1954, when Westinghouse purchased WDTV (changing its call letters to KDKA-TV) from the DuMont Television Network for a then-record price of $9.75 million.\\"Westinghouse pays record to buy DuMont's WDTV (TV)\\", Broadcasting - Telecasting, December 6, 1954, pp. 27-28. Before the purchase, Westinghouse had attempted to purchase the channel 13 license allocated for public broadcasting, but eventually donated the tower to public interest groups and gave financial backing for the eventual WQED. In a somewhat surprising move, KDKA-TV affiliated with CBS, in contrast to KDKA's longtime NBC affiliation. KDKA radio remained affiliated with NBC radio until the network purchased WJAS in 1957 in order for WJAS's owners to gain a 50% ownership stake in WIIC-TV (now WPXI) with the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette.\\"NBC buys WJAS Pittsburgh\\", Broadcasting - Telecasting, August 12, 1957, page 9. KDKA then went independent, relying more on its Group W ties than on a national network. By May 1956, KDKA's studios had relocated from the Grant Building to 1 Gateway Center, joining KDKA-TV. =1960s= By 1960, KDKA added more rock and roll music, as competitor KQV made ratings gains. \\"Your Pal\\" Pallan played hit songs and KDKA carried the sounds of screaming crowds as the Beatles arrived in Pittsburgh in 1964. The major exponent of rock on KDKA radio was disc jockey Clark Race, who also hosted \\"Dance Party\\" on KDKA-TV, a local version of Dick Clark's American Bandstand. Other artists featured on the station included The Four Seasons, The Vogues, Lou Christie (the latter two Pittsburgh-bred), The Beach Boys, The Hollies, The Supremes, Four Tops, and The Turtles. After 11 years of providing early morning entertainment, Rege Cordic moved to KNX in Los Angeles. His replacements were Pallan and Bob Trow, whose \\"Pallan and Trow, Two For the Show\\" program retained some of the Cordic & Company flavor. Two and a half years later, in April 1968, Jack Bogut moved from Salt Lake City to become the KDKA morning host, a position he held for 15 years. One of Bogut's most memorable contributions to KDKA was his introduction to Western Pennsylvania of the word Farkleberry, which is now a staple of the annual Children's Hospital fund-raising campaign. Other notable personalities included Big Jack Armstrong, Bob Shannon and Terry McGovern; the latter two would go on to enjoy lucrative careers in the Film/TV industry as actors. Also in the 1960s, KDKA reported numerous important events, including the Pirates' improbable 1960 World Series win. In local news reporting, the station pioneered with \\"on the scene\\" reports of Mike Levine, the peripatetic former newspaper man whose mobile-unit broadcasts from Tri-State-area covering fires, floods, bank robberies, and coal mine disasters won numerous journalism awards. His nightly \\"Contact\\" show (later \\"Open Mike\\") was KDKA's initial venture into the news-based talk radio format that would become the station's basic offering. In the summer of 1969, KDKA debuted overnight talk with Jack Wheeler, launching an anything-goes talk show that ran from midnight to 6a.m. six nights a week. =1970s= By the early 1970s, KDKA adopted more of an adult contemporary format, consisting of rock and roll hits of the 1960s plus soft rock, with artists such as America, The Carpenters, Doobie Brothers, Paul Simon and Neil Diamond becoming core offerings. The morning show featured less music and an increased news and commercial content. In 1973, KDKA revamped its \\"Party Line\\" timeslot, with the bombastic John Cigna moving over from WJAS to anchor the nighttime talk program and urge listeners to \\"buy American!\\" In 1974 Perry Marshall replaced Wheeler in the overnight timeslot, which became known as the \\"Marshall's Office\\". In 1975, Roy Fox debuted as the 6 to 9pm talk host. By now, KDKA had become a full service adult contemporary radio station. In 1979, newsman Fred Honsberger began working at KDKA, and went on to host a successful evening talk show plus a top-rated afternoon drive program. Also in 1979, KDKA covered the Three Mile Island nuclear accident, first reported by Harrisburg newsman Mike Pintek. By 1982, Pintek joined the KDKA News staff and later became one of the station's most popular talk hosts, although he was let go at the end of 2005 as part of a programming overhaul. In 2007, he became the host of Night Talk on the Pittsburgh Cable News Channel. As of January 2009, Pintek was rehired at KDKA to host a 6p.m. to 10p.m. talk show, and, following the death of Fred Honsberger, took over the 12 noon-3 p.m. timeslot in January 2010. In July 2017, Pintek took a leave of absence to receive treatment for pancreatic cancer. He died on September 12, 2018.\\"KDKA Radio's Mike Pintek Dies At Age 65\\" by John Shumway, September 12, 2018. =1980s= On July 23, 1982, KDKA claims to have become the world's first radio station to broadcast in AM stereo although experimental AM stereo broadcasts were conducted as early as the 1960s on Mexico's XETRA 690. Throughout the 1980s, KDKA continued an information and news intensive adult contemporary music format, playing four to six songs per hour at drive times and 10 to 12 songs an hour during middays and weekends. At night, the station continued its talk format. The station won four Associated Press Joe Snyder awards for outstanding overall news service in Pennsylvania. =1990s= KDKA eventually made the decision to switch from a full-service format that included music to one that was an exclusively news/talk. The changeover occurred at noon on April 10, 1992, when Larry Richert played the last song aired as a regular part of KDKA programming: Don McLean's \\"American Pie\\", signifying that, for KDKA, this was \\"the day the music died\\".\\"The Day the Music Died\\", Radio and Records, April 17, 1992, page 34. (worldradiohistory.com) Rush Limbaugh was added to the noon to 3:00 p.m. timeslot, and all-news blocks were added in the 6:00 to 9:00 a.m. and the 4:00 to 6:00 p.m. timeslots. In 1997, Bob DeWitt was hired as news director, serving for two years. His award-winning team included Bob Kopler, Dave James, Bob Kmetz, Barbara Boylan, Mike Whitely and Beth Trapani. Westinghouse merged with CBS at the start of 1996, so KDKA would soon become an Infinity Broadcasting station, after that chain (a previously separate entity from CBS and Westinghouse) was acquired by Westinghouse. Westinghouse would later turn itself into CBS Corporation in 1997. Viacom bought CBS Corporation in 1999, but five years later transformed itself into CBS Corporation, thus making KDKA a part of CBS Radio. =2000-present= For the 2007 season, KDKA lost the radio rights to the Pittsburgh Pirates to WPGB. On April 26, 2007, the East Pittsburgh building that was the birthplace for KDKA was razed to make way for an industrial complex. On Tuesday, November 2, 2010, KDKA celebrated its 90th anniversary with election coverage, as it had every first Tuesday in November since its debut in 1920. The 90th anniversary celebration was primarily sponsored by Westinghouse Electric Company, a nuclear power company with a history dating back to the original Westinghouse Electric and Manufacturing Company. KDKA Radio's former studios in Pittsburgh's Gateway Center The radio station's studios were located at One Gateway Center in Pittsburgh from 1956 until 2010. That building still houses the studios of KDKA-TV. The radio station studios were moved to CBS's combined radio facility on Holiday Drive in Green Tree. In July 2008, CBS Corporation announced some of its radio stations were available for sale and the company would concentrate on its operations in major markets.\\"Speculation mounts on KDKA radio sale\\" by Adrian McCoy, Pittsburgh Post Gazette, August 1, 2008. (post-gazette.com) With Pittsburgh ranked as the 24th largest market by Arbitron there was speculation KDKA and its three sister stations, KDKA-FM, WDSY-FM and WBZZ-FM would be sold. The speculation was incorrect and the stations were not on the auction block. Since the establishment of KDKA-FM as a sports talk station, KDKA has since been used as an overflow station for some of its sports rights, including the Pirates (whose rights returned to CBS Radio via KDKA-FM in 2012). On February 2, 2017, CBS agreed to merge CBS Radio with Entercom, currently the fourth-largest radio broadcaster in the United States; the sale will be conducted using a Reverse Morris Trust so that it will be tax-free. While CBS shareholders retain a 72% ownership stake in the combined company, Entercom was the surviving entity, separating KDKA radio (both 1020 and FM 93.7) from KDKA-TV and WPCW-TV. The merger was approved on November 9, 2017, and was consummated on the 17th; the merger marked the first time since its establishment that KDKA has not been owned by a direct descendant of Westinghouse. On September 10, 2018, host Marty Griffin was diagnosed with throat cancer. On November 2, 2020, KDKA will begin simulcasting on FM translator station 100.1 W261AX.\\"KDKA Radio has another home‚Ä¶ 100.1 FM\\" October 19, 2020 (radio.com) Priority claims Trying to achieve a consensus on KDKA's precise status as a broadcasting pioneer, especially in relation to other, earlier stations, has been a source of disagreement for nearly a century. This often includes semantic complexities involving carefully crafted definitions and qualifiers ‚Äî including \\"first\\", \\"oldest\\", \\"scheduled\\", \\"commercial\\", and \\"real\\" ‚Äî in an attempt to make sense of a fluid and not always well documented era. The U.S. government had no a formal definition of broadcasting, or specific regulations, until December 1, 1921 when the existing Limited Commercial license category was amended to add a broadcast service subcategory for a select group of designated stations. (A license class dating back to 1912, not all Limited Commercial stations were authorized to make broadcasts.) Before these new regulations were adopted, there were no prohibitions restricting broadcasting stations from operating under amateur or experimental licenses. A specific \\"broadcasting station\\" license did not exist until one was created by the Federal Radio Commission in 1927. In 1923 the Department of Commerce stated that \\"The first broadcasting license was issued in September, 1921\\",Report of the Secretary of Commerce, \\"Bureau of Navigation: Radio Communication\\", July 1, 1923, page 221. a reference to the September 15, 1921 Limited Commercial license issued to WBZ in Springfield, Massachusetts, which appears to be the first to state that the station would be used exclusively for broadcasting, transmitting on 360 meters, which would become the standard \\"entertainment\\" wavelength designated by the December 1, 1921 regulations. It was only KDKA's second, November 7, 1921 license, that included a reference that it would be used for broadcasting in addition to company-wide point-to-point communication. This led to some early Commerce Department information listing WBZ as the first broadcasting station, and KDKA as the fourth.History of Radio to 1926 by Gleason L. Archer, 1938, page 216. Westinghouse advertisement for KDKA's 25th anniversary (1945) The best known priority dispute has been between KDKA and WWJ in Detroit, Michigan, a controversy in which some neutral observers have carefully tried to avoid being entangled. This was emphasized when the September 3, 1945 issue of Time magazine included a report that the National Association of Broadcasters (NAB) had recently sided with WWJ's \\"claim to being the world's first commercial radio station\\", by concluding that KDKA \\"was ten and a half weeks younger\\".\\"Pioneer\\" (in Radio section), Time magazine, September 3, 1945, pages 64, 66. This assertion brought a quick denial by NAB President J. Harold Ryan, who informed the magazine that it had misconstrued some informational material sent out by the association, and: \\"It was not the intention, nor is it the prerogative of the NAB to attempt to decide the relative claims of two pioneer broadcasting stations.\\"\\"Ryan Writes Time Magazine\\", NAB Reports, September 14, 1945, Volume 13, No. 37, page 401. The magazine does not appear to have either printed Ryan's letter or to have responded to it in its pages. In October Westinghouse withdrew its five stations from NAB membership, which Billboard magazine suggested was largely due to Westinghouse's dissatisfaction with how the NAB had handled KDKA's 25th anniversary.\\"Westinghouse Exits From NAB With All Five of Its Stations\\", The Billboard, October 27, 1945, page 5. It appears that Westinghouse officials were initially unaware that, in addition to Frank Conrad's 8XK, other stations had been making regular news and entertainment broadcasts. This was reflected in the slogan, repeated each week in Westinghouse's Radio Broadcasting News publication beginning with the January 1, 1922 debut issue, that \\"Westinghouse Station KDKA was first to give regular Broadcasting Programs\\".Radio Broadcasting News, January 1, 1922, page 2 (worldradiohistory.com). The publication also informed readers that \\"Westinghouse Radio Sets are best to receive Westinghouse Broadcasting\\". However, research has uncovered several challenges to this broad declaration. In the United States, Charles \\"Doc\\" Herrold, in San Jose, California, was found to have begun test transmissions in 1909, which were followed by weekly concerts beginning in 1912.\\"Will Give Concert by Wireless Telephone\\", San Jose Mercury Herald, July 21, 1912, page 27. In addition, beginning in late 1916, Lee de Forest's \\"Highbridge station\\" (2XG) in New York City also began transmitting regularly scheduled programs,\\"Air Will Be Full of Music To- Night\\", New York Sun, November 6, 1916, page 7. including a comprehensive November 7, 1916 election night broadcast. These programs were suspended in April 1917 with the entry of the United States into World War I, but after the war the 2XG broadcasts resumed in late 1919. The broadcasts were again suspended in early 1920, the result of a run-in with the local Radio Inspector.Father of Radio: The Autobiography of Lee de Forest, 1950, pages 349-351. At this point the station's transmitter was transferred to San Francisco, and relicensed as 6XC, the \\"California Theater Station\\", which around April 1920 inaugurated a wide-ranging selection of daily broadcasts. The next year de Forest wrote that this was the \\"first radio-telephone station devoted solely\\" to broadcasting to the public.\\"'Broadcasting' News by Radiotelephone\\" (letter from Lee de Forest), Electrical World, April 23, 1921, page 936. The station was relicensed as KZY late in 1921, then deleted in early 1923. In 1946, a KDKA promotional pamphlet, issued under the name of the station's general manager, Joseph E. Baudino, stated that Westinghouse's November 2, 1920 election day effort marked \\"the world's first regularly scheduled broadcast\\".\\"Going Forward with Radio\\" as presented by KDKA (promotional pamphlet), 1946, page 3. (worldradiohistory.com) However, Baudino later modified this opinion, and as the lead author, along with John Kittross, of a 1977 review of \\"Broadcasting's Oldest Stations\\", now concluded that the \\"first U.S. radio broadcasting station\\" was in fact Charles Herrold's San Jose station, dating to 1912., Joseph E. Baudino and John M. Kittross, Journal of Broadcasting, Winter 1977, page 68. Still, while allowing for the possibility that \\"new data will be found\\",Additional WWJ reference sources not stated as being reviewed by this article include: Contemporary front page articles in the 1920 editions of the Detroit News, beginning with \\"The News Radiophone To Give Vote Results\\" (August 31, 1920); WWJ‚ÄîThe Detroit News, published by the newspaper in 1922; a detailed station history, \\"WWJ‚ÄîPioneer in Broadcasting\\" by Cynthia Boyes Young (Michigan History, December 1960); \\"WWJ, 'The World's First Radio Station': A History\\" by Robert Preston Rimes (Michigan State University, 1963); and the subsequently published Radio's First Broadcaster: An Autobiography of Elton M. Plant, 1989. the authors credited Baudino's former station, 8ZZ/KDKA, as being the \\"oldest [surviving] station in the nation\\". Herrold's San Jose broadcasts had been suspended due to the World War I prohibition of civilian radio stations, and he did not return to the airwaves until May 1921.\\"Radio School Sends Jazz Music via Air\\", San Jose Mercury Herald, May 3, 1921, page 4. His experimental station was relicensed in December 1921 as KQW, which later moved to San Francisco and changed its call letters to KCBS in 1949. Baudino and Kittross argued that this post-World War I gap disqualified KCBS from \\"oldest station\\" consideration, something neither KQW nor KCBS has agreed with, as program schedules for KQW appearing in 1925 included the slogan \\"Pioneer Broadcasting Station of the World\\",KQW schedule San Jose Evening News, December 12, 1925, page 2. and in 2009 KCBS celebrated its 100th birthday with a yearlong series of events throughout the Bay Area, including the public dedication of a plaque commemorating the \\"Centennial Celebration of the World's First Broadcasting Station\\". At the same time, KCBS adopted the slogan \\"The World's First Broadcasting Station\\". Baudino and Kittross also concluded that there was no significant link between the daily broadcasts introduced on August 20, 1920 by the Detroit News \\"Detroit News Radiophone\\", as amateur station 8MK, and its subsequent transformation into WBL and later WWJ, something with which the newspaper stoutly disagreed: for example, in a 1934 advertisement, WWJ, still owned by the Detroit News, declared itself \\"America's Pioneer Broadcasting Station\\".\\"WWJ\\" (advertisement), Broadcasting, August 15, 1934, page 29. (worldradiohistory.com) A case has also been made for the primacy of the University of Wisconsin's WHA in Madison, Wisconsin, which evolved from an earlier experimental authorization, 9XM. In 1958 a plaque was installed on the university campus crediting \\"9XM-WHA\\" as \\"The Oldest Station in the Nation\\", including the statement that the station began \\"broadcasting on a regular schedule in 1919\\".\\"9XM-WHA ‚Äì Madison, WI\\" marker at Vilas Hall, University of Wisconsin-Madison (waymarking.com) However, Baudino and Kittross found no evidence of organized broadcasting prior to the inauguration of spoken-word weather forecasts on January 3, 1921, and in 2007 a comprehensive station history compiled by Randall Davidson came to the same conclusion.9XM Talking: WHA Radio and the Wisconsin Idea by Randall Davidson, 2007, pages 322-327. An additional qualifier sometimes proposed for KDKA is that it was the first \\"commercial\\" station, but there is no consensus here either, as a 1945 advertisement for WWJ claimed that station was the one where \\"commercial radio began\\".\\"WWJ\\" (advertisement), Broadcasting, August 20, 1945, page 31. (WWJ and KDKA were both initially commercial-free, and did not start to accept advertising until the mid-1920s, so in this case \\"commercial\\" appears to just mean under the control of a commercial enterprise.) Additionally, Westinghouse's operation of KDKA's broadcasting service under a \\"Limited Commercial\\" license appears to have been merely a side-effect of the fact that it had previously been determined that type of authorization was required for KDKA's original role, of providing private point-to-point communication between company installations.

In the early 1920s Westinghouse established additional broadcasting stations, and was interested in linking them together for simultaneous network programming, but wanted to avoid the expense of leasing long-distance telephone lines. It was decided to test the practicality of using shortwave transmissions for distributing programming originating at KDKA.\\"Important Events in Radio\\", Radio Service Bulletin, December 31, 1926, page 30. Beginning on March 4, 1923 KDKA, in addition to its normal operation on 360 meters (833 kHz), transmitted on shortwave wavelengths from 80 to 100 meters (3750 to 3000 kHz), for local rebroadcasts on 360 meters by both KDPM in Cleveland, Ohio and WBZ in East Springfield, Massachusetts.\\"Is Short-wave Relaying a Step Toward National Broadcasting Stations?\\" by W. W. Rodgers, Radio Broadcast, June 1923, pages 119-122. The shortwave relay to KDPM was judged to be successful. However, Westinghouse soon decided to move its relay target to the geographical center of the United States, and switched to a newly constructed station, KFKX in Hastings, Nebraska, beginning on November 22, 1923,\\"Broadcasting Makes a Giant Stretch\\" by Jerome W. Howe, Wireless Age, April 1924, pages 29, 47. which ended the relay transmissions to KDPM.\\"'Dope' on KDPM\\", Cleveland Plain Dealer, February 15, 1925, Dramatic-Feature section, page 9. Ultimately shortwave relays for network programming was determined to be inferior to dedicated telephone line connections, and the transmissions to KFKX ended, with the Hastings operation closing on June 1, 1927.Radio: The Fifth Estate by Judith C. Waller, 1946, page 263. Responsibility for the shortwave transmissions was later transferred to separately licensed experimental stations. In 1922, a 1 kW shortwave transmitter was installed at Westinghouse's factory in East Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, with call sign 8XS.\\"New Stations: Special Land Stations\\", Radio Service Bulletin, October 2, 1922, page 4. This was joined by 8XAU in 1924,\\"New Stations: Special Land Stations\\", Radio Service Bulletin, September 4, 1924, page 3. which, after the original 8XK was deleted later that year,\\"Special Land Stations: Strike out all particulars\\", Radio Service Bulletin, December 1, 1924, page 8. changed its call sign to the historically significant 8XK,\\"Special Land Stations: Alterations and Corrections\\", Radio Service Bulletin, January 2, 1925, page 8. and then W8XK in 1929, with its transmitter power increasing to 40 kW by 1937. The transmissions by W8XK were eventually expanded into an international service conducted independently of KDKA.\\"Statement of S. D.

It can only be reached via ferry from the mainland or boat. There is not an airport on the island. It is considered part of the \\"Abaco Out Islands\\" and is long and ¬Ω mile wide. It was named after the once abundant green turtles that inhabited the area. In 1977, Key West, Florida became a sister city to New Plymouth, Green Turtle Cay's village. The population of the island is about 450 and its main settlement is New Plymouth which was founded in the 18th century. The architecture of the older homes in the village is unique in the Bahamas, with steep-pitched roofs, originating with settlers from New England. New Plymouth contains a post office, a bank, a customs and immigration office, four grocery stores, several restaurants, bars, and churches and there is a museum featuring the paintings of noted Bahamian painter Alton Lowe. New Plymouth also features the \\"Loyalist Memorial Sculpture Garden,\\" a Bahamian National Monument featuring 24 busts of prominent Bahamians arranged around a central pair of life-sized bronze figures of both black and white loyalist women, sculpted by James Mastin. The village can be walked in less than 15 minutes end to end. While cars are allowed on the island, golf carts and bicycles are the usual mode of transport. Both are easily rented for those visiting the island. Green Turtle Cay is known for its beaches and has several full-service hotel-resorts with boat marinas. These are Bluff House and the Green Turtle Club. There is also a boat repair yard with haul-out slips. Green Turtle Cay is a stopover-point for southbound vessels during periods of rough seas in the Whale Cay Passage. Lobstering and tourism are the main industries of the island today. In August 2019, Green Turtle Cay and the rest of the Abacos were struck by Hurricane Dorian. The storm was a Category 5 Hurricane and was the most deadly storm to hit the area.

Overview Head of O. hastatus Commonly known as trap-jaw ants, species in Odontomachus have a pair of large, straight mandibles capable of opening 180 degrees. These jaws are locked in place by an internal mechanism, and can snap shut on prey or objects when sensory hairs on the inside of the mandibles are touched. The mandibles are powerful and fast, giving the ant its common name. The mandibles either kill or maim the prey, allowing the ant to bring it back to the nest. Odontomachus can simply lock and snap its jaws again if one bite is not enough, or to cut off bits of larger food. The mandibles also permit slow and fine movements for other tasks such as nest building and care of larvae. The ants were also observed to use their jaws as a catapult to eject intruders or fling themselves backwards to escape a threat.Ant Jaws Break Speed Record ‚Äî Videos of Odontomachus jumping using its jaws The larvae of trap-jaw ants are remarkable in being ornamented with long spikes and presenting dorsal adhesive pads for fixation onto internal ant nest walls. They are carnivorous, extremely active larvae. Apparently, they undergo three larval moults before entering metamorphosis. Their larvae use substrate to spin cocoons. Speed record Trap-jaw ants of this genus have the second fastest moving predatory appendages within the animal kingdom, after the dracula ant (Mystrium camillae). One study of Odontomachus bauri recorded peak speeds of between , with the jaws closing within just 130 microseconds on average. The peak force exerted was in the order of 300 times the body weight of the ant and acceleration of 1 000 000 m/s¬≤ or 100 000 g. Mimicry The jumping spider genus Enoplomischus seems to mimic this ant genus. Distribution Odontomachus species are found in Central to South America, Asia, Australia, and Africa.

It is on the northern edge of the town and extends into the North Sea. Whilst many English seaside piers are in decline, Southwold Pier is enjoying renewed popularity. It includes a collection of modern coin-operated novelty machines designed and constructed by the inventor Tim Hunkin. History The pier was built in 1900 as a landing stage for steamships that brought tourists from London Clacton and Great Yarmouth until the 1930s. It was in length and finished with a T-shaped end. The ownership of the pier transferred from that of the Coast Development Company following its winding up in 1906, to The Amusement Equipment Company. The landing stage of the pier was destroyed during a storm in 1934, with the T-shaped end being swept away. An addition to the pier of a concert hall and amusement arcade was made during 1937 at the shore end of the pier. During the Second World War the pier had a section removed due to the fear of its use during an invasion. Further damage occurred from an impact with a mine. The pier was rebuilt after the war at a cost of ¬£30000. Further damage caused by storms in October 1955 and February 1979 left the length of the pier at . In 1960, a part of the pier pavilion was transformed into the Neptune Bar public house. Parts of the pier were further restored during 1987 where additional work was carried out to both the theatre and function room. After the reconstruction the pier then reopened in December 1988. Restoration The pier was bought by Chris Iredale in 1987 and he first spent five years turning the pavilion into a profit-making business.\\"Gamble on a near-ruin pays off after 15 years\\", The Independent, Saturday, 11 January 2003. Retrieved 2010-10-10. A major refurbishment program was started in 1999 in order to rebuild the pier. This was completed to a design by Brian Haward ARIBA AABC Architect of The Rope House Southwold and constructed by Nick Haward [Southwold] Limited in 2001 almost 100 years after it was first opened. In 2002 a new T-Shaped end was added, bringing the pier to a total length of . This additional length now allows the pier to accommodate visits by Britain's only surviving sea-going steam passenger ship, the PS Waverley paddle steamer and its running mate the MV Balmoral. Attractions The pier is home to several shops and attractions including traditional souvenir shops, caf√©s, restaurants and amusement arcades.

A triangle mesh is a type of polygon mesh in computer graphics. It comprises a set of triangles (typically in three dimensions) that are connected by their common edges or corners. Many graphics software packages and hardware devices can operate more efficiently on triangles that are grouped into meshes than on a similar number of triangles that are presented individually. This is typically because computer graphics do operations on the vertices at the corners of triangles. With individual triangles, the system has to operate on three vertices for every triangle. In a large mesh, there could be eight or more triangles meeting at a single vertex - by processing those vertices just once, it is possible to do a fraction of the work and achieve an identical effect. In many computer graphics applications it is necessary to manage a mesh of triangles. The mesh components are vertices, edges, and triangles. An application might require knowledge of the various connections between the mesh components. These connections can be managed independently of the actual vertex positions. This document describes a simple data structure that is convenient for managing the connections. This is not the only possible data structure. Many other types exist and have support for various queries about meshes. Representation Various methods of storing and working with a mesh in computer memory are possible. With the OpenGL and DirectX APIs there are two primary ways of passing a triangle mesh to the graphics hardware, triangle strips and index arrays. =Triangle strip= One way of sharing vertex data between triangles is the triangle strip. With strips of triangles each triangle shares one complete edge with one neighbour and another with the next. Another way is the triangle fan which is a set of connected triangles sharing one central vertex. With these methods vertices are dealt with efficiently resulting in the need to only process N+2 vertices in order to draw N triangles. Triangle strips are efficient, however the drawback is that it may not be obvious how or convenient to translate an arbitrary triangle mesh into strips. =The Data Structure= The data structure representing the mesh provides support for two basic operations: inserting triangles and removing triangles. It also supports an edge collapse operation that is useful in triangle decimation schemes. The structure provides no support for the vertex positions, but it does assume that each vertex is assigned a unique integer identifier, typically the index of that vertex in an array of contiguous vertex positions. A mesh vertex is defined by a single integer and is denoted by hvi. A mesh edge is defined by a pair of integers hv0,v1i, each integer corresponding to an end point of the edge. To support edge maps, the edges are stored so that v0 = min(v0,v1). A triangle component is defined by a triple of integers hv0,v1,v2i, each integer corresponding to a vertex of the triangle. To support triangle maps, the triangles are stored so that v0 = min(v0,v1,v2). Observe that hv0,v1,v2i and hv0,v2,v1i are treated as different triangles. An application requiring double‚Äìsided triangles must insert both triples into the data structure. For the sake of avoiding constant reminders about order of indices, in the remainder of the document the pair/triple information does not imply the vertices are ordering in any way (although the implementation does handle the ordering). Connectivity between the components is completely determined by the set of triples representing the triangles. A triangle t = hv0,v1,v2i has vertices v0, v1, and v2. It has edges e0 = hv0,v1i, e1 = hv1,v2i, and e2 = hv2,v0i. The inverse connections are also known. Vertex v0 is adjacent to edges e0 and e2 and to triangle t. Vertex v1 is adjacent to edges e0 and e1 and to triangle t. Vertex v2 is adjacent to edges e1 and e2 and to triangle t. All three edges e0, e1, and e2 are adjacent to t. How much of this information a data structure stores is dependent on the needs of an application. Moreover, the application might want to have additional information stored at the components. The information stored at a vertex, edge, or triangle is referred to as the vertex attribute, edge attribute, or triangle attribute. The abstract representations of these for the simple data structure described here are Vertex = ; // v Edge = ; // v0, v1 Triangle ; // v0, v1, v2 VData = ; EData = ; TData = ; VAttribute = ,set>; // data, eset, tset EAttribute = >; // data, tset TAttribute = ; // data VPair = pair; EPair = pair; TPair = pair; VMap = map; EMap = map; TMap = map; Mesh = ; // vmap, emap, tmap The maps support the standard insertion and removal functions for a hash table. Insertion occurs only if the item does not already exist. Removal occurs only if the item does exist. =Edge Collapse= This operation involves identifying an edge hvk, vti where vk is called the keep vertex and vt is called the throw vertex. The triangles that share this edge are removed from the mesh. The vertex vt is also removed from the mesh. Any triangles that shared vt have that vertex replaced by vk. Figure 1 shows a triangle mesh and a sequence of three edge collapses applied to the mesh. =Index array= With index arrays, a mesh is represented by two separate arrays, one array holding the vertices, and another holding sets of three indices into that array which define a triangle. The graphics system processes the vertices first and renders the triangles afterwards, using the index sets working on the transformed data. In OpenGL, this is supported by the glDrawElements() primitive when using Vertex Buffer Object (VBO). With this method, any arbitrary set of triangles sharing any arbitrary number of vertices can be stored, manipulated, and passed to the graphics API, without any intermediary processing.

Definition  Let ZN denote the Baer‚ÄìSpecker group, that is, the group of all integer sequences, with termwise addition. For each n in N, let en be the sequence with n-th term equal to 1 and all other terms 0. A torsion-free abelian group G is said to be slender if every homomorphism from ZN into G maps all but finitely many of the en to the identity element.  Examples  Every free abelian group is slender. The additive group of rational numbers Q is not slender: any mapping of the en into Q extends to a homomorphism from the free subgroup generated by the en, and as Q is injective this homomorphism extends over the whole of ZN. Therefore, a slender group must be reduced. Every countable reduced torsion-free abelian group is slender, so every proper subgroup of Q is slender.  Properties  * A torsion-free abelian group is slender if and only if it is reduced and contains no copy of the Baer‚ÄìSpecker group and no copy of the p-adic integers for any p. * Direct sums of slender groups are also slender. * Subgroups of slender groups are slender. * Every homomorphism from ZN into a slender group factors through Zn for some natural number n.

He was the eldest son of Sun Qiang, the elder brother of Sun Quan's father Sun Jian. He first served Sun Jian in the campaign against Dong Zhuo. After Sun Jian's death, he took control of the army and went to serve Yuan Shu. He would soon rejoin Sun Ce (Sun Jian's eldest son and successor). He died of illness after the Battle of Red Cliffs. He was succeeded by his son Sun Lin (Â≠´ÈÑ∞). Life Sun Ben was the elder son of Sun Qiang, the elder brother of Sun Jian. Sun Qiang died early, and so his sons were taken in by their uncle. Sun Ben followed his uncle in battle after Sun Jian's return from Luoyang, and led a unit during Sun Jian's attack on Liu Biao. When Sun Jian died, Sun Ben, being older than Sun Ce, gathered many of the soldiers and generals and went to Yuan Shu, who had been Sun Jian's overlord. Sun Ben served under Yuan Shu for a time, along with Sun Jian's brother-in-law, Wu Jing (the brother of Sun Jian's wife Lady Wu). He served as Inspector of Yu Province, but the position was mostly nominal, for he was still young. He met Zhou Yu, and joined him to aid Wu Jing, who was under attack from Liu Yao. Sun Ce soon arrived as well, and both Zhou Yu and Sun Ben joined his army. Wu Jing was saved, and Sun Ben was reunited with his family under Yuan Shu. As a reward for his duties, Sun Ben was made Grand Administrator of Yuzhang Commandery, while Sun Fu was sent to Luling Commandery. When Yuan Shu went out to battle Liu Bei, Sun Ben was assigned to defend Shouchun. When Yuan Shu declared himself emperor, Sun Ben, Wu Jing, Zhou Yu and Lu Su all abandoned him and joined Sun Ce. Sun Ben's wife and children, however, were detained in the city and were unable to join him until later. In 197, Sun Ce and L√º Bu allied with each other to defeat Yuan Shu. Sun Ben and Sun Fu led the attack against Liu Xun, easily scoring a victory. In 200, Sun Ce died, and both Sun Ben and Sun Fu were uneasy about the young Sun Quan being his heir, both being his elder. The two were stationed in Yuzhang when Cao Cao began his advance southward. Sun Fu wrote a letter intending to surrender to Cao Cao, but he was stripped of all rank, and his advisors were executed. Sun Ben also was contemplating surrender, but it is said that Zhu Zhi dissuaded him, and he served at the Battle of Red Cliffs. A few months after, however, Sun Ben died of illness. His son, Sun Lin, succeeded him. At the time of his death, it is said that an edict was in Sun Ben's possession ‚Äì an edict delivered from the capital offering him a high rank under Cao Cao.

It was founded in 1824 by George Ramsay, Earl of Dalhousie, governor of British North America. Its headquarters are still located in Quebec City. After several moves and two fires, the Society settled into the northern wing of Quebec City's Morrin College in 1868. The College closed at the turn of the 20th century but the Society stayed on, eventually taking over the entire building in 2004. The Society's original aims were encyclopaedic, being founded in the infancy of Canada's cultural and intellectual development. The Society gathered historical documents about Canada and republished many rare manuscripts. Research in all fields of knowledge was actively encouraged. Talks were held in the Society's reading room, the best of which were published regularly in a quasi-annual series of Transactions from 1824 to 1924. Over the years, the Society played a part in creating public institutions that would take over many of its traditional roles. For instance, it fostered the foundation of the Public Archives of Canada (today's Library and Archives Canada) in 1872. It was also active in the preservation of Canada‚Äôs built and natural heritage, helping to save the Plains of Abraham from developers and eventually fostering the creation of the Historic Sites and Monuments board of Canada. With the growth of national public institutions, the Society‚Äôs activities gradually became centred on the services of its private lending library, providing access to English-language books in a largely French-speaking city. In the 1990s, the Society reassessed its mission and sought to expand its cultural services to Quebec City's small English-speaking community.

In the 1930s he was joined by several others at Fontainebleau, where his group of \\"'Bleausards\\" developed a love of bouldering that went beyond simple training for the Alps. The famous Allain Angle (V2 - V3), done in 1934, is a testament to their dedication and to the resulting elevation of standards. In Allain's 1949 book, Alpinisme et Competition, he expresses his appreciation of this simple and understated climbing specialty. To facilitate the rock-climbing experience he developed ‚Äì in the 1930s - the first rubber-soled, soft shoes specifically engineered for serious rock work. He wore these on the sandstone boulders as well as on the granite walls of the Alps, where he made several famous first ascents, including the north face of the Aiguille du Dru. These shoes, known as \\"PAs\\", became the model for future generations of climbing footwear. Indeed, the version available in the 1950s looked remarkably like modern climbing footwear. In the 1950s Allain opened a mountaineering store in Paris, where, among other innovative items, he offered the first modern alloy carabiners. Prior to that time, these indispensable snaplinks were made of heavy steel. His brand name then became \\"EB\\", out of his associate's name Edmond Bourdonneau who purchased the store from him in 1950, and now when Allain's name comes up these days, it is more frequently in connection with his pioneering bouldering efforts at Fontainebleau.Pierre Allain: alpiniste visionnaire et inventeur du chausson d'escalade References French rock climbers French mountain climbers 1904 births 2000 deaths Sportspeople from Fontainebleau ","title":"Pierre Allain"},{"id":"5739087","text":"Matthew Jon-Porter Elich (born September 22, 1978) is an American retired professional ice hockey winger.

McInnes, S.J. (January 20, 1923 ‚Äì December 8, 2009) was an American Jesuit and academic. McInnes served as the 5th President of Fairfield University located in Fairfield, Connecticut from 1964 to 1973 and the President of the University of San Francisco from 1972 to 1977. (McInnes served as the president of both universities simultaneously for a few months in 1972). He then headed the Association of Jesuit Colleges and Universities, a consortium of Jesuit colleges and universities in the United States, from 1977 until 1989. McInnes was one of the first Jesuit priests to study business administration. Biography =Early life= McInnes was born on January 20, 1923 in Dorchester, Massachusetts, to parents, William and Mary (Byrne) McInnes. He was one of three children, including his sister, Helen and brother, Paul. McInnes lived in Boston during his early childhood before the family purchased a home in Quincy, Massachusetts. He attended local public schools. McInness enrolled in Boston College in 1940. However, he enlisted in the United States Army in 1942 after noticing an ad on a Boston College bulletin board promising to train students as meteorologists. The United States Army trained McInnes as a meteorologist at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. He travelled with the Army Air Forces as a meteorology officer during World War II, serving in China, Africa and India. He was stationed in Assam for six months and later worked in Shanghai. McInnes graduated from Boston College in 1944 and was honorably discharged from the United States Army in 1946. He initially enrolled in Saint John's Seminary in Massachusetts following World War II, intending to become a diocesan Roman Catholic priest. However, Father John Drummey, a professor at Boston College, recommended that he join the Jesuit order instead. He entered the Society of Jesus in 1946 and studied philosophy at Weston College. McInnes earned his master's degree in business from Boston College. He then obtained a doctorate in business administration from New York University. McInnes was ordained a Jesuit priest in 1957. In doing so, McInnes became one of the first Jesuits to specialize in business administration. =Boston College= McInness joined the faculty of Boston College in 1959. In 1964, he was promoted to assistant dean of Boston College's school of business. =Fairfield University= McInness was appointed as the President of Fairfield University in Connecticut by the Jesuits in 1964, a position he would hold until 1973. He had no prior knowledge that he would was to be given the post at Fairfield and was summoned to a \\"secret meeting\\" where he was appointed president. He oversaw the rapid expansion of the university's campus and student population during his presidency. Under Mcinness, the overall student enrollment at Fairfield doubled to nearly 2,500 students at the time. Fairfield, which had previously been an all-male institution, began accepting women in 1970, becoming a co-ed institution for the first time. The school's first female alumni graduated in 1973.Rev. William C. McInnes, S.J. Profile The Graduate School of Corporate and Political Communication, School of Nursing and Center for Lifetime Learning were all established during McInness' tenure as college president. McInness also oversaw several major challenges to Fairfield University during the 1960s and 1970s. McInness offered testimony before the United States Supreme Court in the Tilton vs. Richardson case. The Tilton vs. Richardson lawsuit, which was filed against Fairfield University and three other Roman Catholic colleges, ultimately upheld the constitutionality of using American federal money for the construction of secular academic buildings at colleges and universities with religious affiliations. The Supreme Court ruled in favor of Fairfield in 1971. In 1969, a group of African American students seized an academic building located on Fairfield's campus. McInness negotiated directly with the students involved, eventually agreeing to some of their demands, including a commitment to hiring minority faculty members and increasing the number of black students from 43 to 240 at the time. Fairfield University also experienced a ten-day student strike during the late 1960s. McInnes was criticized outside Fairfield University because no university students were ever punished for building takeovers or strikes. He noted that no university property or buildings were damaged or destroyed during the 1960s campus unrest, \\"We never had any physical damages on the Fairfield campus, and we did not have any fatalities or serious injuries. But we lost several outside friends, because they did not appreciate the way we were handling the crisis.\\" McInnes was appointed president of the University of San Francisco in 1972. However, he remained the president of both Fairfield and San Francisco simultaneously for four months during the Fall 1972 semester while transititioning between the two colleges. McInnes officially stepped down as president of Fairfield University in 1973 and was succeeded by Thomas R. Fitzgerald, S.J. =University of San Francisco= Father McInnes was appointed president of the University of San Francisco in 1972. He simultaneously served as president of both San Francisco and Fairfield University for four months during the transition between the two universities. The University of San Francisco was in a deep financial crisis at the time of McInnes' arrival in 1972. McInnes instituted a series of financial reforms which resulted in a corrected, balanced budget for the university. McInnes initiated negotiations which led to the acquisition of the now defunct San Francisco College for Women campus on Lone Mountain. Today, the Lone Mountain campus houses administrative offices, classrooms and the offices of the university's president and vice president. McInnes also founded the Fromm Institute for Lifelong Learning, a program for retirees, during his tenure as president. =Association of Jesuit Colleges and Universities= He departed the University of San Francisco in 1977 to become the head of the Association of Jesuit Colleges and Universities (AJCU), a consortium consisting of the twenty-eight Jesuit colleges and universities in the United States. He served as the head of the AJCU for twelve years. His position allowed him to meet both Pope Paul VI and Pope John Paul II. McInness stepped down as head of the AJCU in 1989. =Later life= He later became the campus minister at the University of Connecticut in 1990. That same year, McInnes also became the parochial vicar of St. Thomas Aquinas Roman Catholic Parish in Storrs, Connecticut. In 1998, McInness rejoined Boston College as an adjunct professor at the Carroll School of Management. He also became the faculty advisor for BC's chapter of the Alpha Sigma Nu Jesuit honor society. McInnes campaigned to build a Vietnam War memorial on the Boston College campus. The memorial, which measures 70 feet long and commemorates members of the Boston College community killed in Vietnam, was dedicated on November 11, 2009. Father William McInnes died on December 8, 2009, from complications of cancer and a fall at the Campion Center Jesuit retreat facility in Weston, Massachusetts, at the age of 86. His funeral was held at St. Ignatius Church in Chestnut Hill, Massachusetts, and he was buried at the Campion Center Cemetery in Weston, Massachusetts. References External links *Rev. William C.

His layname was Seol (ÏÑ§ hanja: Ëñõ) or Bak (Î∞ï hanja: Êú¥). Like a great number of other Korean Buddhist monks of the 6th-8th centuries, Won Gwang traveled to China in search of a more thorough grounding in the sacred texts of Buddhism. In 589 Wongwang went to Sui China, where for eleven years he was educated in the major texts of both Hinayana and Mahayana Buddhism. Won Gwang returned to Silla in 600 and promulgated the Mahayana form of Buddhism. His method was to teach the faith to the common people free of complex jargon and employing common words.Chae, Taeg-su, \\"The United Silla Period: the Golden Age of Buddhism.\\" In The History and Culture of Buddhism in Korea (Seoul:Dongguk University Press, 1993), p. 81. Won Gwang is best known for his \\"Five Commandments for Secular Life\\" (ÏÑ∏ÏÜçÏò§Í≥ÑSesok-ogye ‰∏ñ‰øó‰∫îÊàí), which later were attributed as a guiding ethos for the Hwarang. These five commandments were to serve as moral guideposts for the Buddhist layperson. They are an interesting fusion of the Buddhist beliefs and strong sense of patriotism that characterized Silla Buddhism. To Won Gwang, viewing Silla as a true Buddha Land and under constant threat from the neighboring kingdoms of Baekje and Goguryeo, the defense of that land and a Buddhist piety were not at all contradictory. These five principles were as follows: #Loyalty to one's lord (‰∫ãÂêõ‰ª•Âø†; ÏûÑÍ∏àÏùÄ Ï∂©ÏÑ±ÏúºÎ°úÏç® ÏÑ¨Í≤®Ïïº ÌïúÎã§) #Devotion towards one's parents (‰∫ãË¶™‰ª•Â≠ù; Ïñ¥Î≤ÑÏù¥Î•º Ìö®ÎèÑÎ°úÏç® ÏÑ¨Í≤®Ïïº ÌïúÎã§) #Trust among friends (‰∫§Âèã‰ª•‰ø°; Î≤óÏùÄ ÎØøÏùåÏúºÎ°úÏç® ÏÇ¨Í∑ÄÏñ¥Ïïº ÌïúÎã§) #Never retreat in battle (Ëá®Êà∞ÁÑ°ÈÄÄ; Ï†ÑÏüÅÏóê ÏûÑÌïòÏó¨ Î¨ºÎü¨ÎÇòÏßÄ ÏïÑÎãàÌïòÏó¨Ïïº ÌïúÎã§) #Be selective in the taking of life (ÊÆ∫ÁîüÊúâÊìá; Ìï®Î∂ÄÎ°ú ÏÇ¥ÏÉùÏùÑ ÌïòÏßÄ ÎßêÏïÑÏïº ÌïúÎã§) The precise dates of Won Gwang‚Äòs life are unknown.

If the group is M, this says that Ext(F,M) = 0 for all torsion-free groups F. It suffices to check the condition for F the group of rational numbers. More generally, a module M over a ring R is said to be a cotorsion module if Ext1(F,M)=0 for all flat modules F. This is equivalent to the definition for abelian groups (considered as modules over the ring Z of integers) because over Z flat modules are the same as torsion-free modules. Some properties of cotorsion groups: * Any quotient of a cotorsion group is cotorsion. * A direct product of groups is cotorsion if and only if each factor is. * Every divisible group or injective group is cotorsion. * The Baer Fomin Theorem states that a torsion group is cotorsion if and only if it is a direct sum of a divisible group and a bounded group, that is, a group of bounded exponent. * A torsion-free abelian group is cotorsion if and only if it is algebraically compact. * Ulm subgroups of cotorsion groups are cotorsion and Ulm factors of cotorsion groups are algebraically compact.

Originally named Camp Wolters, it was an Army camp from 1925 to 1946. During World War II, it was for a time the largest infantry replacement training center in the United States, and was commanded by Major General Bruce Magruder. During World War II, Camp Wolters served as a German POW camp. After the war, the camp was deactivated for several years. It became an Air Force base in 1951 with the mission of training Air Force engineers. Camp Wolters was the location where two of the war's most famous enlisted infantrymen underwent basic training - Audie Murphy and Eddie Slovik. Audie Murphy completed basic training at Camp Wolters. He was one of the most decorated American combat soldiers of World War II, receiving every military combat award for valor available from the U.S. Army, as well as French and Belgian awards for heroism. At the age of 19, Murphy received the Medal of Honor after single-handedly holding off an entire company of German soldiers for an hour at the Colmar Pocket in France in January 1945, then leading a successful counterattack while wounded and out of ammunition. Also, during World War II on January 24, 1944, Eddie Slovik was sent to Camp Wolters for basic military training. Upon finishing basic training, he was sent to France as a replacement. Slovik was convicted of desertion in November 1944, and, on 31 January 1945, became the first member of the U.S. military since the American Civil War to be executed for desertion. Special Category Army Personnel With the Air Force (SCARWAF) (1951-1956) In 1947 the US Air Force's Far East Air Force (FEAF) needed to upgrade older airfields and build new airfields to support operations in Korea. Since the split between the Army and Air Force in 1947 there was no provision for specialized semi-skilled and skilled troops to perform this sort of task. SCARWAF was a provisional Army and Air Force unit that provided personnel who would perform these construction duties. Camp Wolters was one of the facilities that trained SCARWAF units (and later their Aviation Engineer replacements). It also was used as a storage depot for Air Force equipment. United States Army Primary Helicopter School (1956-1973) In 1956, Camp Wolters reverted to the United States Army to house the United States Army Primary Helicopter School. In 1963 it was designated a \\"permanent\\" military base and renamed Fort Wolters. The facility started with one heliport (Main) and 4 stage fields. At its height it had 3 heliports (Main Heliport, Downing Field, and Dempsey Field) and twenty-five stage fields (Pinto, Sundance, Ramrod, Mustang, Rawhide, Bronco, Wrangler, An Khe, Bac Lieu, Ben Cat, Ben Hoa, Cam Ranh, Can Tho, Chu Lai, Da Nang, Hue, My Tho, Phu Loi, Pleiku, Qui Nhon, Soc Trang, Tay Ninh, Tuy Hoa, Vinh Long, and Vung Tau). The Vietnamese- named stage fields were named after facilities in Vietnam and were oriented to be the same relation to each other, on a smaller scale of course, as they were on the map. The other stage fields were Western-themed. June 1963, the post was re-designated Fort Wolters, a permanent military installation and U.S. Army Primary Helicopter Center. Postwar The base was deactivated in 1973. The site is now used as an industrial park with activities including Ventamatic, Ltd, GR's Workshop, a branch of Weatherford College, and a training center for the Texas Army National Guard.

It took place at the hamlet of Dalrigh (the \\"King's Field\\" in the Scottish Gaelic language) near Tyndrum in Perthshire, Scotland (not to be confused with Dalry, Ayrshire). Bruce's army, reeling westwards after defeat by the English on 19 June at the Battle of Methven, was intercepted and all but destroyed, with Bruce himself narrowly escaping capture. The battle took place sometime between July and early August, but the exact date is unknown.  The MacDougalls  By the late 13th century, the Clan MacDougall had emerged as the most powerful of the descendants of Somerled, a former king of the Hebrides. Alexander MacDougall, the head of the family, was related by marriage to King John Balliol and his nephew John Comyn. He attained high office when John was king, being appointed Sheriff of Lorn in February 1293. Alexander managed to extend his power still further at the expense of the MacDonalds of Islay and the Campbells of Loch Awe, whom he defeated in battle sometime in the mid-1290s. The outbreak of the War of Independence in 1296 placed the MacDougalls on the side of the Scottish patriots. This changed in the most dramatic fashion in February 1306, when Robert the Bruce killed John Comyn. Soon after Bruce seized the crown, and the MacDougalls and other families with Balliol and Comyn associations became allies of the English.  The King's Field  On 19 June 1306 Bruce and his army were caught unprepared in their night camp at the Battle of Methven, west of Perth, by Aymer de Valence, an English general acting for Edward I. What was left of his army retreated westwards, towards the mountains of Argyll. When they reached Strathfillan they found their path blocked at Tyndrum by a large force of MacDougalls, Traquair p. 139 said to have numbered 1,000 men, commanded by Alexander's son, John of Lorne, also known as John Bacach-'the Lame.' We do not know Valence's exact location at this time, but it is likely that his army was not far to the east in pursuit of his defeated enemy. Unable to retreat, Bruce's little army of 300 to 500, including women, the aged, etc. and a guard of Highland men, was forced into battle in disadvantageous circumstances in western Perthshire near the border with Argyll. The exact site of the battle is known in Gaelic as Dail Righ-the King's Field-though it is uncertain if this was the name at the time or added afterwards by the chroniclers. Locals have placed the battle at a number of local place-names (Lasantulich, Dalchaisnie, Inverchaddan, and names with Sasunnaich). The only sources we have for the Battle of Dalrigh are pro-Bruce, and tend at every turn to put a favourable interpretation upon the King's actions. John Barbour has him 'boldly waiting' to engage John in battle, though 'his followers were all too few'. However, Bruce's army had just been defeated and would have needed time to recoup; so it is possible that the MacDougalls took him by surprise. Barbour provides some justification for such an interpretation, providing no description of preparations or dispositions-as he does elsewhere-, just an account of a quick and very close engagement. Bruce's remaining horses were killed by the MacDougall axemen, who also wounded many of his men, including Sir James Douglas and Gilbert de la Hay. Under considerable pressure Bruce did his best to disengage; They thereupon withdrew. In this There was no mark of cowardice. They kept together; and the king Was ever busy rescuing The rearmost of his company. With skill and valour there wrought he, And safely all his men withdrew. He daunted those that would pursue So none durst leave their cloe array, For he was never far away. Bruce was so heavily involved in action with the rearguard that he found himself at one point alone and under attack between a hill and the lochside, a pass so narrow that he could not turn his horse. According to tradition, Bruce was so hard pressed that one of his assailants tore off the studded brooch that fastened his cloak. Known as the \\"Brooch of Lorn\\" it was in possession of the Campbells until 1826 when it was turned over to the MacDougall family.MacDougall, Iain, \\"The Brooch of Lorn\\" in \\"Communications and Replies\\", The Scottish Historical Review, Vol. 3, No. 9 (Oct. 1905), pp. 110‚Äì115, Edinburgh University Press For the king to be placed in such a position, seemingly unsupported, provides some further evidence of the weakness of the royal forces. The enemy was fought off and the army retreated to safety; but not long after it ceased to exist as an organised military force.  Flight  After Dalrigh, Bruce, now styled dismissively as 'King Hob' in English propaganda, was little better than a fugitive, closely pursued by his many enemies, both domestic and foreign. For a time his party took refuge in the mountains of Atholl. From here the king sent Queen Elizabeth, his daughter Marjorie Bruce, his sister, Mary, and Isabella MacDuff the Countess of Buchan to the relative safety of Kildrummy Castle, near the River Don in Aberdeenshire. With James Douglas and a few others he then escaped southwards into the territory of his friend Maol Choluim II, Earl of Lennox. From here he was helped to cross over to the Kintyre Peninsula by way of Bute, where he was aided by Aonghus √ìg Mac Domhnaill, chief of the MacDonalds and a bitter enemy of the MacDougalls. Bruce was given temporary refuge in Dunaverty Castle, a location far too exposed and dangerous to remain in for long. He fled from here into a very uncertain future, not fully reappearing on the stage of history until the early spring of 1307. The recovery of his cause from this point counts as one of the most remarkable episodes in the history of warfare. Two years after Dalrigh the MacDougalls were destroyed at the Battle of Pass of Brander.  References  = Primary = * Barbour, John, The Bruce, trans, A. A. H.

Since the book's publication MacLeod has written two short stories set in the same universe, \\"Lighting Out\\"http://www.sfrevu.com/Review- id.php?id=3776 and \\"Who's Afraid of Wolf 359?\\". Plot The novel is a first contact story, following the generation ship But the Sky, My Lady! The Sky! as it approaches the Destiny Star. Humans have been colonizing the 500 light- years around Earth for a few thousand years, and have never run into a sentient alien species ‚Äî until now. The discovery of an Industrial Age alien race upsets the established protocols of the ship, leading to uncertainty and delays in habitation, which in turn leads to societal unrest and conflict aboard the ship.

The Japanese version was released in 1985 and the export version in 1986. It was only released as a combo with Astro Warrior in a double cart in the United States and European regions but was released as a stand-alone game in Japan. Game description The player is introduced to the game with a short cut scene showing that a princess has been kidnapped and held captive inside a castle by an evil witch. The players mission is to enter the castle and rescue the princess. In order to successfully rescue her, the following items must be found: a cross to prevent her from turning into a witch, a potion to wake her up, and a ring to get her to marry the player. These items are hidden in a maze, separated into separate rooms that are static (i.e. no scrolling). The number of rooms depends on the level of difficulty. Along the way, the player will face monsters and puzzles. Using a magic hammer, the player can squash the enemies, and smash tiles into the bottomless pit. The monsters regenerate at a predetermined respawn spot, similar to Pac-Man, so the player must move quickly. The game ends if the player lost all of his allowed lives.

Lynx Edicions, Barcelona Description Museum specimen Manucodia comrii has a compact and large body approximately 43 cm long, with glossy purple, black and green plumage, red iris and crinkled yellowish-green upper breast and neck feathers. It has curled head feathering and twisted central tail feathers. Both sexes are similar with a slightly smaller female. The curl-crested manucode is the largest species of manucode, and also the largest and heaviest species in its family in terms of body size, weighing up to 450 gramsPerrins, Christopher, Firefly Encyclopedia of Birds. Firefly Books. though its tail is shorter than the black sicklebill. Biology Although not the most vibrant in appearance, the curl-crest manucode is certainly a vocally evolved species. In most birds, the trachea extends straight from the mouth to the lungs, whereas in this species, it extends towards the lower chest area and coils back through the abdominal cavity and then reaches the lungs, which works like a wind instrument and gives the curl-crested manucode a characteristic mellow, fluting sound which is audible from a considerable distance. These vocalizations are common in courtship displays, where the males follow insistently the females among the vegetation spreading their wings and tail and raising their bodies in a strutting fashion. Manucode pairs also vocalize to defend their territories from invading pairs. These birds have diurnal habits. The diet of Manucodia comrii consists mainly of ripe fruits, feeding mostly on figs, but also on insects and other small invertebrates. They usually live in pairs or in small groups in a single territory. Breeding season last from June to November, nest-building has been recorded in mid- November and egg-laying occurs in March and in June‚ÄìOctober. Manucodia comrii is a strictly monogamous bird. The couple collaborates in building of a cup- shaped nest on a bifurcation of a branch. Once 1-2 eggs are laid, both sexes hatch the eggs and raise their chicks. References * Frith, C.

When John died in 2006, Douglas was only out of work for a few months. Maria Arena Bell, the head writer for the series, brought him back as a recurring guest star on September 1, 2006. Since John's death, Douglas has portrayed the role of John Abbott's spirit, and he appears to his children and friends in times of great need. In 2008, Douglas portrayed the role of Alistair Wallingford on the series for three months. Following Alistair's departure, Douglas still returns on occasion as Jack's inner conscience. He has also appeared to Ashley on occasion. Storylines =1980‚Äì99= In 1980, John Abbott was introduced as the founder of Genoa City conglomerate, Jabot Cosmetics. He went to high school with his first wife, Dina Mergeron, as well as other prominent Genoa City residents: Stuart Brooks, Neil Fenmore, Katherine Shepherd, Joanna Manning, Gary Reynolds, and Suzanne Lynch, who Ashley's middle name came from. In 1972, Dina left John to raise their three children: Jack, Ashley, and Traci, with their maid, Mamie Johnson, helping. Ashley discovered in 1982 that Dina had been unfaithful and that Brent Davis was her biological father. Jack graduated from Harvard University and, along with Ashley, who graduated from Colorado State University, prepared to one day take over their family company. Traci graduated from Stanford University and became a best-selling novelist. John continued to run Jabot, but he often butted heads with Jack over business deals. By the early 1980s, John began dating the much younger Jill Foster, but Jack tried to convince his father to stay away from her given her past marriages to Phillip Chancellor II and Stuart Brooks. Yet, Jack ended up having an affair with Jill, and when John found them she immediately wanted to end their relationship. Even Jack decided to stay away from Jill, who in turn launched a sexual harassment lawsuit where she was awarded $10,000. By 1982, John and Jill finally reunite and marry despite Jack and Katherine's pleas against it. Mamie Johnson also tried to keep an eye on Jill, who quickly began another affair with Jack despite his romances with Diane Jenkins and his marriage to Patty Williams. Eventually, Katherine obtained pictures of Jill with Jack. Upon seeing the photos, John had a stroke. In 1986, John and Jill divorced, and John fired Jack and threw him out of his house. Jill received 25% of Jabot Cosmetics, a seat on the board of directors, and a cushy executive position with Jabot at $150,000 a year. With this huge settlement, John and Jack hoped that Jill would stay quiet in order to protect Jabot's image. John replaced Jack at the company with Traci's new husband Brad Carlton (Don Diamont), formerly an Abbott gardener. After his divorce from Jill, he began seeing Joanna Manning (Susan Seaforth Hayes), a high school friend and Lauren Fenmore's (Tracey E. Bregman) mother. He soon moved on to the director of the local soup kitchen, Ellen Winters. John put his love life on hold when Ashley disappeared. He found her in a mental institution in New York, and she had amnesia. Thankfully, she quickly recovered, and John brought her back home to Genoa City. Then, Brad quit his job, and John was forced to hire Jack again. John became involved with Jessica Blair Grainger. Jessica was Christine Blair's (Lauralee Bell) mother, who had recently returned to town. Jessica was diagnosed with AIDS, but she kept her illness a secret from everyone, including John. She tried to move back to Kansas City, Missouri, but she collapsed during her travels. Christine discovered her illness, and she told John. Undeterred, the couple still married in 1988 until Christine's father, Jim Grainger, came to town. John nobly ended the marriage in 1989, and Jessica, Jim, and Christine reunited as a family. Jessica died later that year with her loved ones, including John, at her bedside. Then, Jack decided to take Jabot public, and Victor Newman (Eric Braeden) took over the company. John's shock over this news caused him to have another heart attack. Jack tried to bring Jabot back by ending his romance with Victor's ex-wife Nikki Newman and in turn, Victor would let the Abbotts regain control of Jabot. However, Victor had tricked Jack and he remained in control of Jabot. Out of spite, Jack married Nikki. Victor had also managed a short time afterwards to have a romance with John's ex-wife Jill. Then, Jill and John reunited when she was rejected by Victor Newman. They remarried in 1993, and Jill wanted to have a baby. Still, John complained that he was too old to be a father. She managed to get pregnant before John had a secret vasectomy. John wanted Jill to have an abortion, but she refused. Thus, William Foster Abbott was born in 1993. John thought that Victor might be Billy's father, but when he found out that Billy was his biological son, he grew to love him. Then, Jill had an affair with Jed Sanders due to John's impotence. As Jill and John separated, John's first wife, Dina, returned to Genoa City and John began romancing her again. John eventually proposed and filed a divorce from Jill. Stress from the divorce and the custody battle over Billy gave John a stroke, but he quickly recovered. Dina left Genoa City again much to John, Jack, Ashley, and Traci's surprise. John eventually won custody of Billy and moved to New York where Billy attended boarding school. Jack and Ashley ran Jabot while their father was raising Billy. John returned to Genoa City with a 16-year-old Billy in 1999. He returned to help Jack and Ashley fight to maintain control of Jabot. =1999‚Äì2006= While in town, John began dating his old friend, Gina Roma (Patty Weaver), and he occasionally sang with her at her restaurant, Gina's. Billy graduated high school, and he went to Louisiana for volunteer work. Meanwhile, Traci's daughter, Colleen Carlton (then played by Lyndsy Fonseca), was placed into John's guardianship when she was expelled from school for smoking marijuana in 2001. Colleen began dating J.T. Hellstrom (Thad Luckinbill), but John forbade his granddaughter from seeing J.T., who was much older than she was. Colleen soon began living with her father, Brad Carlton. In 2003, Ashley and Brad were married and expecting a child, but Ashley got into a horrific car accident, and their son, Robert, did not survive. Meanwhile, Gina's restaurant, Gina's, caught on fire, and John watched out for her until she found new employment. Then, John and Ashley scolded Jack for the troubles he brought upon the company. Victor ended up paying Jabot $75 million for his commercial bribery scandal, and Jack was forced to resign. In 2004, John was lovestruck by the much younger Gloria Fisher (Judith Chapman). He was unaware that her sons were Michael Baldwin (Christian LeBlanc) and Kevin Fisher (Greg Rikaart). Kevin had almost murdered Colleen, and he set Gina's on fire. John and Gloria went on a cruise, and they came back as Mr. and Mrs. John Abbott. Ashley and Jack were shocked by their father's latest romance; Jack accepted Gloria if his father was happy, but Ashley refused to accept her new stepmother. Then, John found out about Gloria's sons, and he vowed to divorce her for deceiving him. Suddenly, he fell down a flight of stairs, and he was forced to have hip replacement surgery. Gloria nursed him back to health, and he forgave her for her deceit. Ashley became the CEO of Jabot, but John fired her when she began working with her on-and-off lover, Victor Newman. John came out of retirement, and he resumed his position as CEO of Jabot until he could find a proper replacement. He settled on making Jill Abbott the new CEO. In 2004, Ashley was pursued by a mysterious man, Tom Callahan (Roscoe Born). In reality, Tom was Gloria's estranged husband, Tom Fisher, who she never officially divorced. Tom was Kevin's biological father; he was known as \\"Terrible Tom\\" because he abused Kevin as a child. Tom eventually cornered Gloria, hoping she would give him money now that she was married to a wealthy Abbott. She tricked John into giving her large sums of money that he thought was being used for Michael's wedding. Michael wanted to tell John the truth, but Tom confessed to him first. In the end, Gloria went along with Tom's lie in order to stay in John's good graces. She continued taking money from John because Tom was blackmailing her. Gloria told John that Tom was dead, but their divorce was never finalized. John forgave Gloria for lying to him, and they \\"officially\\" remarried in 2005. Tom wreaked havoc on Michael and Lauren Fenmore's wedding day, and he took Lauren hostage. Gloria was going to meet Tom in order to free Lauren, but John overheard her phone call. He met Tom in an alley, and during their struggle, his gun went off, and Tom was killed. John drove away, and he got into a car accident. At first, he had no recollection of his night, and Ashley confessed to killing Tom. When he remembered, John confessed to killing Tom, and the charges against Ashley were dropped. John was sentenced to seven years in prison for the murder. While John was in prison, Gloria and her sons schemed against the Abbotts. They landed themselves jobs at Jabot, and they sabotaged Ashley and Jack's business plans. Then, John began fighting with his inmates, and he believed that his first wife, Dina, had just left him. A doctor examined him, and Jack, Ashley and Gloria found out that John was being over-medicated. Jack wanted to trick his father into changing his will to remove Gloria. He made John believe that he was cutting Dina out of the will. Six months after his incarceration, John was due to be pardoned by the Governor. Before his release, he had a stroke, and he was left in a vegetative state. John signed a DNR, and Gloria and her stepchildren agreed that they wanted to abide by John's wishes. John's family and friends came to the hospital to say good-bye, and John died in 2006. Jack and Ashley overruled Gloria's wish to have a lavish funeral. Instead, they told her the wrong time for the ceremony, and they held a small family-only memorial for John. Then, Kevin discovered that his mother was tricked, and he held another service for John with his mother. After his death, the Abbotts were appalled to discover that Gloria was left 50% of John's billion-dollar estate. The remaining 50% was to be divided among John's four children. While Gloria was expecting a big payout, she was stunned when a prison chaplain arrived in court, and he handed the judge a handwritten note by John that wrote Gloria out of his will. In addition, news broke that Gloria's marriage to John was invalid because she never officially divorced Tom. Gloria returned \\"home\\" to the Abbott Mansion to find her belongings in trash bags outside while Jack looked on smugly from behind the door. In 2007, the judge made it official that Gloria was not included in John's final will. =Afterlife appearances= John has occasionally appeared as a viewable representation of Jack's conscience. He has often berated Jack for his shabby treatment of Gloria and his unethical behavior, but always reminds him of how much he loves him. While John's spirit has occasionally manifested in ways that could indicate a supernatural origin, he has never known about Gloria's various misdeeds until Jack found out about them. Thus, the \\"spirit\\" is nothing more than a figment of Jack's imagination, appearing as his conscience, rather than a supernatural presence. Ashley, Billy and Katherine Chancellor have had similar visits from John's \\"spirit.\\" On December 24, 2013, Jack looks at photos of Phyllis, who is now in a coma. John appears. He tells Jack he needs to be with someone who can take care of him - Phyllis wouldn't want to see him home alone talking to a ghost. Jack tells him he's right, but first he has to do something. He calls Phyllis to chat to her. This is the last appearance of John until the episode aired on March 24, 2015. John appeared to Ashley in December 2015, when she passed out due to her brain aneurysms. John appeared to Jack in September and October 2016, to tell Jack to forgive Billy and Phyllis for their affair.

He previously served as President of Fairfield University (1942‚Äì44) and Vicar Apostolic of Jamaica (1950‚Äì56). Biography John McEleney was born in Woburn, Massachusetts, the only son among seven children of Charles H. and Bridget (n√©e Gaffigan) McEleney. He attended local public schools, graduating from Woburn High School in 1914. He studied at Boston College, where he earned a Bachelor of Arts degree in 1918 and later a Master of Arts degree in 1924. In 1918, McEleney entered the Society of Jesus, more commonly known as the Jesuits, at the novitiate in Yonkers, New York. He completed his classical studies at St. Andrew-on-Hudson Seminary in Hyde Park in 1921, and then studied philosophy at Weston College in Massachusetts and at Woodstock College in Maryland. From 1924 to 1927, he was a language professor at the Ateneo de Manila University in the Philippines. He then returned to Weston College, where he completed his theological studies in 1931. On June 18, 1930, McEleney was ordained to the priesthood by Bishop John Peterson at Weston. He then served as assistant master of novices at the Shadowbrook novitiate in Lenox until 1934, when he was sent to study ascetical theology at North Wales in the United Kingdom. He resumed his post at Shadowbrook the following year, and earned a Doctor of Philosophy degree from the Pontifical Gregorian University in Rome in 1937. McEleney served as rector of Shadowbrook from 1936 to 1942. In 1942, he became the first president of Fairfield University and the first rector of Fairfield College Preparatory School in Connecticut. He remained in those posts for two years, and afterwards served as provincial of the Jesuits' New England Province from 1944 to 1950.

When the apostolic vicariate was elevated to the Diocese of Kingston on February 29, 1956, McEleney became its first Bishop. McEleney attended the Second Vatican Council between 1962 and 1965. He became an Archbishop when the Diocese of Kingston was elevated to the rank of an archdiocese on September 14, 1967. During his twenty years in Jamaica, he encouraged the growth of a local church with a native clergy and nuns. He opened St. Michael's Seminary in 1952 to train native seminarians. He retired as archbishop on September 1, 1970; he was named Titular Archbishop of Lorium by Pope Paul VI on the same date, resigning on the following December 23.

The group is called fat if it is not thin. Given any generating set of the group, we can consider a graph whose vertices are elements of the group with two vertices adjacent if their ratio is in the generating set. The graph is connected and vertex transitive. paths in the graph correspond to words in the generators. If the graph has a cycle of a given length, it has a cycle of the same length containing the identity element. Thus, the girth of the graph corresponds to the minimum length of a nontrivial word that reduces to the identity. A nontrivial word is a word that, if viewed as a word in the free group, does not reduce to the identity. If the graph has no cycles, its girth is set to be infinity. The girth depends on the choice of generating set. A thin group is a group where the girth has an upper bound for all finite generating sets. Some facts about thin and fat groups and about girths: * Every finite group is thin. * Every free group is fat. * The girth of a cyclic group equals its order. * The girth of a noncyclic abelian group is at most 4, because any two elements commute and the commutation relation gives a nontrivial word. * The girth of the dihedral group is 2. * Every nilpotent group, and more generally, every solvable group, is thin.

It usually has nylon strings, as opposed to steel. Usually, it has a livelier sound compared to the classical guitar. It is used in toque, the guitar-playing part of the art of flamenco.  History  Traditionally, luthiers made guitars to sell at a wide ranges of prices, largely based on the materials used and the amount of decorations, to cater to the popularity of the instrument across all classes of people in Spain.\\"We know from literary sources that the five course guitar was immensely popular in Spain in the early seventeenth century and was also widely played in France and Italy...Yet almost all the surviving guitars were built in Italy...This apparent disparity between the documentary and instrumental evidence can be explained by the fact that, in general, only the more expensively made guitars have been kept as collectors' pieces. During the early seventeenth century the guitar was an instrument of the people of Spain, but was widely played by the Italian aristocracy.\\" Tom and Mary Anne Evans. Guitars: From the Renaissance to Rock. Paddington Press Ltd 1977 p.24 The cheapest guitars were often simple, basic instruments made from the less expensive woods such as cypress. Antonio de Torres, one of the most renowned luthiers, did not differentiate between flamenco and classical guitars. Only after Andr√©s Segovia and others popularized classical guitar music, did this distinction emerge.Jos√© L. Romanillos \\"Antonio De Torres: Guitar Maker-His Life and Work\\" (1987, 1997)  Construction  The traditional flamenco guitar is made of Spanish cypress, sycamore, or rosewood for the back and sides, and spruce for the top. This (in the case of cypress and sycamore) accounts for its characteristic body color. Flamenco guitars are built lighter with thinner tops than classical guitars, which produces a \\"brighter\\" and more percussive sound quality. Builders also use less internal bracing to keep the top more percussively resonant. The top is typically made of either spruce or cedar, though other tone woods are used today. Volume has traditionally been very important for flamenco guitarists, as they must be heard over the sound of the dancers‚Äô nailed shoes. To increase volume, harder woods, such as rosewood, can be used for the back and sides, with softer woods for the top. In contrast to the classical guitar, the flamenco is often equipped with a tap plate (a golpeador), commonly made of plastic, similar to a pickguard, whose function is to protect the body of the guitar from the rhythmic finger taps, or golpes. Originally, all guitars were made with wooden tuning pegs, that pass straight through the headstock, similar to those found on a lute, a violin or oud, as opposed to the modern classical-style guitars' geared tuning mechanisms. \\"Flamenco negra\\" guitars are called \\"negra\\" after the darkness of the harder woods used in their construction, similar materials to those of high-end classical guitars, such as rosewood or other dense tone woods. The harder materials increase volume and tonal range. A typical cypress flamenco guitar produces more treble and louder percussion than the more sonorous negra. These guitars strive to capture some of the sustain achieved by concert caliber classical guitars while retaining the volume and attack associated with flamenco. = Materials = Classical guitars are generally made with spruce or cedar tops and rosewood or mahogany backs and sides to enhance sustain. Flamenco guitars are generally made with spruce tops and cypress or sycamore for the backs and sides to enhance volume and emphasize the attack of the note. Nevertheless, other types of wood may be used for the back and sides, like rosewood, maple, koa, satinwood and caviuna. = Sound = A well-made flamenco guitar responds quickly, and typically has less sustain than a classical. This is desirable, since the flurry of notes that a good flamenco player can produce might sound muddy on a guitar with a big, lush, sustaining sound. The flamenco guitar's sound is often described as percussive; it tends to be brighter, drier and more austere than a classical guitar. Some jazz and Latin guitarists like this punchy tonality, and some players have even discovered that these guitars‚Äô wide-ranging sound also works well for the contrapuntal voicings of Renaissance and Baroque music.  Techniques  Flamenco guitarist Paco de Luc√≠a Flamenco is played somewhat differently from classical guitar. Players use different posture, strumming patterns, and techniques. Flamenco guitarists are known as tocaores (from an Andalusian pronunciation of tocadores, \\"players\\") and flamenco guitar technique is known as toque. Flamenco players tend to play the guitar between the sound hole and the bridge, but as closely as possible to the bridge, to produce a harsher, rasping sound quality. Unlike classical tirando, where the strings are pulled parallel to the soundboard, in flamenco apoyando strings are struck towards the soundboard in such way that the striking finger is caught and supported by the next string, hence the name apoyando (from Spanish apoyar meaning \\"to support\\"). At times, this style of playing causes the vibrating string to gently touch the frets along its length, causing a more percussive sound. While a classical guitarist supports the guitar on the left leg, and holds it at an incline, flamenco guitarists usually cross their legs and support the guitar on whichever leg is on top, placing the neck of the guitar nearly parallel to the floor. The different position accommodates the different playing techniques. Many of the tremolo, golpe, and rasgueado techniques are easier and more relaxed if the upper right arm is supported at the elbow by the body of the guitar rather than by the forearm as in classical guitar. Nonetheless, some flamenco guitarists use classical position. Flamenco is commonly played using a cejilla (capo) which raises the pitch and causes the guitar to sound sharper and more percussive. However, the main purpose in using a cejilla is to change the key of the guitar to match the singer's vocal range. Because Flamenco is an improvisational musical form that uses common structures and chord sequences, the capo makes it easier for players who have never played together before to do so. Rather than transcribe to another key each time the singer changes, the player can move the capo and use the same chord positions. Flamenco uses many highly modified and open chord forms to create a solid drone effect and leave at least one finger free to add melodic notes and movement. Very little traditional Flamenco music is written, but is mostly passed on hand to hand. Books, however, are becoming more available. Both accompaniment and solo flamenco guitar are based as much on modal as tonal harmonies; most often, both are combined. In addition to the techniques common to classical guitar, flamenco guitar technique is uniquely characterized by: * Tirando: Pulling or plucking the strings'ordinary' plucking of the strings with index, middle and ring fingers when playing falsetas. * Picado: Single-line scale passages performed by playing alternately with the index and middle fingers, supporting the other fingers on the string immediately above. Alternate methods include using the thumb rapidly on adjacent strings, as well as using the thumb and index finger alternately, or combining all three methods in a single passage.Picados are the flamenco scales of a guitar, or a guitar playing technique where the musician plays scale passages by alternating the index and middle fingers. Picado is normally executed apoyando (with rest strokes). It is often used rapidly to play a melody. This technique is similar to that of the rest stroke played in classical guitar. The difference is that technique is of central importance in flamenco while peripheral in classical. This enables flamenco guitarists to perform rapid picados while compromising tone quality. * Rasgueado: Strumming done with outward flicks of the right hand fingers, done in a variety of ways. A nice rhythmic roll is obtained, supposedly reminiscent of the bailador‚Äôs (flamenco dancer's) feet and the roll of castanets. The rasgueo can be performed with 5, 4, or 3 fingers. * Alzap√∫a: A thumb technique which has roots in oud plectrum technique. The right hand thumb is used both up and down for single-line notes and/or strumming across a number of strings. Both are combined in quick succession to give it a unique sound. * Arpeggio (Arpegio): In flamenco, both 'ordinary'up the strings from lower notes to higher; and 'reverse'down the strings from higher notes to lower; or the two togetherup the strings then back down from lower notes to higher notes and down again on the lower notes. * Ligado: Using only the left hand fingers to 'hammer' down on a string in successive ascending frets to sound notes from lower to higher, while the right hand is held off the strings; also 'pulling' off a string in successive descending frets to sound notes from higher to lower. * Tremolo: Rapid repetition of a single treble note, often following a bass note. Flamenco tremolo is different from classical guitar tremolo, it is usually played with the right hand pattern p-i-a-m-i which gives a 4 note tremolo. Classical guitar tremolo is played p-a-m-i giving a 3 note tremolo. Or it may be used as an ornament to a chord, in which case it is done on the highest chord string finishing with a thumb across all the strings that make the chord. This creates a very quick trill followed by a full bodied thumb. * Glisando: While holding a finger down on a note at one fret, sliding the finger up the frets of that string to glide the finger through a series of notes up or down (lower to higher or higher to lower); occasionally also used in flamenco. * Seco, or sometimes referred to as 'Sorda' (literally 'quiet', but here meaning 'muffled'; as opposed to 'FuerteStrong'): A technique where the left hand damps the strings at the chordal tonic and the right hand plays purely rhythmic components. This creates a chugging like sound that greatly accents the rhythm, allowing the singer or dancer to play off the beat, creating a strong contra-tempo feel. * Golpe: Percussive finger tapping on the soundboard at the area above or below the strings. This requires a golpeador (tap-plate) to protect the surface of the guitar. Flamenco guitar employs a vast array of percussive and rhythmic techniques that give the music its characteristic feel. Often, eighth note triplets are mixed with sixteenth note runs in a single bar. Even swung notes are commonly mixed with straight notes, and golpes are employed with the compas of different types of rhythms (i.e. bulerias, soleas, etc.) as is strumming with the strings damped for long passages or single notes. More broadly, in terms of general style and ability, one speaks of: * Toque airoso (\\"graceful\\"): lively, rhythmic, with a brilliant, almost metallic sound. * Toque gitano o flamenco (\\"Gypsy\\" or \\"flamenco\\"): deep and very expressive, using many grace notes and countertempos. * Toque pastue√±o (from a bullfighting term for a calm, fearless bull): slow and peaceful. * Toque sobrio (\\"sober\\"): without ornament or showing off. * Toque virtuoso: with exceptional mastery of technique; running the risk of excessive effects. * Toque corto (\\"short\\"): using only basic technique. * Toque fr√≠o (\\"cold\\"): the opposite of gitano or flamenco, unexpressive.

History It was founded following an important bequest from Joseph Morrin, former city mayor and prominent doctor. The college initially occupied rooms rented from the Masonic Temple from 1862 to 1868. It then moved to its permanent headquarters in Fran√ßois Baillairg√©'s 1808 city gaol at 44, Chauss√©e des √âcossais (then Rue Saint-Stanislas) after architect Joseph-Ferdinand Peachy remodelled the building.Canadian Architecture Although officially open to everyone, Morrin College was very much a Presbyterian institution. It attracted some Protestants of other denominations, but few Roman Catholics. The school‚Äôs founder and Principal for 31 of its 40 years was the Reverend John Cook, Minister of Saint-Andrew‚Äôs Church across the street. Faculties A Faculty of Divinity within the school formed a total of 24 Presbyterian ministers. In addition to this, a Faculty of Arts and a short-lived Faculty of Law had a wider appeal. Morrin College was affiliated in Arts with McGill University from 1863 to 1900Donovan, Patrick. \\"Morrin College\\", Part II of Blair, Louisa, Donovan, Patrick and Fyson, Donald, Iron Bars and Bookshelves: A History of the Morrin Centre.

In addition to persistent financial problems, the Anglo-Protestant population of Quebec City was too small to justify an institution of its kind. It never had more than 9 paid professors and 28 full-time students. The institution discontinued regular classes around 1902. It continued to administer the college building and adjacent properties until 1988. The Board of Governors of Morrin College still meets, and continues to administer a fund for the purposes of education. Past financial contributions have ensured the survival of the Literary and Historical Society of Quebec at a precarious time in the early 20th century. The Society now manages the former Morrin College building, now known as the Morrin Centre.  Notable alumni  A total of 46 students graduated with a McGill BA. The school was also a local pioneer in terms of women's education, allowing female students to study for a BA in co-ed classes from 1885.

She was transferred to the Royal Canadian Navy in 1928 and served primarily as a training ship until 1936. Design and description During the First World War, Royal Navy intelligence investigated German torpedo craft and found that they were more lightly armed than the designs the UK was building. The Royal Navy altered their destroyer designs so that the ships would be less expensive. This meant that the design known as the Admiralty modified 'Trenchant' or \\"S\\" class would be smaller, faster and less expensive, ships which could be built quickly. The ships had a complement of 90 officers and ratings. The Thornycroft version of the S class displaced 1,087 tons. The vessels were long, had a beam of and a draught of . They were larger than their sister ships of the Yarrow or Admiralty designs. The S class had a trawler-like bow with a more sharply sheered and turtleback forecastle. The Thornycroft S-class design were propelled by two shafts driven by Brown- Curtis steam turbines powered by three Yarrow boilers (built by Thornycroft), creating .Parkes, 1933 This gave the ship a maximum speed of . S-class destroyers were armed with three quick-firing (QF) /45 calibre Mk IV guns in single mounts. The forecastle gun was placed on a raised platform. They were also equipped with a QF 2-pounder \\"pom-pom\\" gun for use against aircraft. The vessels also had four Lewis machine guns installed. All S-class destroyers had four torpedo tubes installed in two twin mounts. Unlike the Admiralty and Yarrow designs, all the Thornycroft designed ships had two torpedo tubes equipped. Arrayed along the sides of the ship, they were fitted to fire through a narrow aperture. Service history =Royal Navy= Torbay, was ordered in June 1917 as part of the second order of Thornycroft S-class destroyers by the Royal Navy.Gray & Gardiner, p. 85 In November 1919, the destroyer was part of the 4th Destroyer Flotilla, which was part of the Atlantic Fleet. The destroyer remained a part of this unit until February 1920. Torbay was placed on the reserve list in March 1920 and laid up at HMNB Portsmouth.The Monthly Navy List, (December 1920). p. 876. =Royal Canadian Navy= Torbay, along with her sister , were loaned by the British Government to Canada in 1927 as temporary replacements for the two destroyers in service with the Royal Canadian Navy, and .German (1990), p. 59Johnston et al., p. 1009 Torbay was renamed Champlain for the famous explorer Samuel de Champlain. At the same time the Canadian government commissioned the construction of two further destroyers, and . The vessel was transferred and commissioned into the Royal Canadian Navy on 1 March 1928 at Portsmouth.Macpherson & Barrie, p. 14 Following commissioning, Champlain was sent to the east coast, based out of Halifax. She had come to Canada via the West Indies and arrived in May 1928. On 25 August 1928, the destroyer left Halifax for a goodwill tour of the east coast, returning 3 September.Johnston et al., p. 1014 The ship was used primarily for training purposes for both regular and reserve personnel.Johnston et al., p. 1003 Initially only the east coast vessels participated in the winter cruise in the Caribbean Sea, however beginning in 1929, Vancouver joined Champlain beginning a tradition that would last until the outbreak of the Second World War.Johnston et al., p. 1017 These peacetime training cruises were not always smooth. While en route to the Caribbean Sea in January 1931, Champlain encountered a gale. The ship pushed through the storm, resulting in damage to the ship. The rigging was carried away and when a replacement was jury-rigged together, that too was blown away. The dinghy and whaler suffered damage and one person was injured.Johnston et al., p. 1020 During another winter cruise, personnel from Champlain were involved in an incident at Port of Spain, Trinidad. The chief officer of the Danish vessel had noticed discrepancies among the victuals and had caught the chief tally clerk passing food out of a porthole. A confrontation ensued that left two people injured. Members of Champlains crew responded to Stensbys distress signal and restored order before returning to their ship.Johnston et al., p. 1021 During the 1930s Champlain served on the east coast of Canada alongside Saguenay.German (1990), p. 62 In 1934 the ship returned to the Caribbean with Saguenay, Skeena and Vancouver. There, the four ships participated in the longest cruise that the Royal Canadian Navy had attempted to that point. During the time in the Caribbean, the vessel took part in a week-long training session with the Royal Navy's Home Fleet.Johnston et al., p. 1036 By 1935 the condition of the two S-class destroyers in Canadian service had deteriorated significantly. Custom at this time was to give an active destroyer a thorough and complete refit (referred to as a D2) every six to eight years. Champlain, which had been completed in 1918, had never undergone such a refit. She and her sister were surveyed by naval engineers in 1934 and the report concluded that it would cost $165,000 to refit both ships.Johnston et al, p. 1052 This had to be done as the loan conditions with the British government stipulated that the ships had to be returned in good condition. Rendering them safe for an ocean crossing to the United Kingdom would still cost $50,000 more than a standard refit. Canada intended to return the S-class destroyers to the United Kingdom as they were considered antiquated. The United Kingdom initially wanted to have them broken up within the United Kingdom. However, they agreed to have them scrapped in Canada as they were no longer sure of the two vessels crossing the ocean successfully. It was also agreed that the armament of the destroyers would remain in Canadian stockpiles after the ships were broken up.Johnston et al., p. 1078 Champlain was mentioned in the London Naval Treaty of 1930 as being set for disposal in 1936, and was to be replaced by the newer . During her service with the Royal Canadian Navy, Champlains running cost was as low as $68,678 in 1928 and as high as $217,021 in 1931.Johnston et al., p. 1080 The destroyer was paid off at Halifax on 25 November 1936 and broken up in 1937.

It has found many uses in abelian group theory and related areas. Definition A subgroup S of a (typically abelian) group G is said to be pure if whenever an element of S has an n^{\\\\text{th}} root in G, it necessarily has an n^{\\\\text{th}} root in S. Formally, \\\\forall n \\\\in\\\\Z, a \\\\in S, x^n = a is solvable in G \\\\Rightarrow x^n = a is solvable in S.Fuchs, L (1970), Infinite Abelian Groups, I, Pure and Applied Mathematics, New York, Academic Press. Origins Pure subgroups are also called isolated subgroups or serving subgroups and were first investigated in Pr√ºfer's 1923 paper which described conditions for the decomposition of primary abelian groups as direct sums of cyclic groups using pure subgroups. The work of Pr√ºfer was complemented by Kulikoff where many results were proved again using pure subgroups systematically. In particular, a proof was given that pure subgroups of finite exponent are direct summands. A more complete discussion of pure subgroups, their relation to infinite abelian group theory, and a survey of their literature is given in Irving Kaplansky's little red book. Examples * Every direct summand of a group is a pure subgroup * Every pure subgroup of a pure subgroup is pure. * A divisible subgroup of an Abelian group is pure. * If the quotient group is torsion-free, the subgroup is pure. * The torsion subgroup of an Abelian group is pure. * The union of pure subgroups is a pure subgroup. Since in a finitely generated Abelian group the torsion subgroup is a direct summand, one might ask if the torsion subgroup is always a direct summand of an Abelian group. It turns out that it is not always a summand, but it is a pure subgroup. Under certain mild conditions, pure subgroups are direct summands. So, one can still recover the desired result under those conditions, as in Kulikoff's paper. Pure subgroups can be used as an intermediate property between a result on direct summands with finiteness conditions and a full result on direct summands with less restrictive finiteness conditions. Another example of this use is Pr√ºfer's paper, where the fact that \\"finite torsion Abelian groups are direct sums of cyclic groups\\" is extended to the result that \\"all torsion Abelian groups of finite exponent are direct sums of cyclic groups\\" via an intermediate consideration of pure subgroups. Generalizations Pure subgroups were generalized in several ways in the theory of abelian groups and modules. Pure submodules were defined in a variety of ways, but eventually settled on the modern definition in terms of tensor products or systems of equations; earlier definitions were usually more direct generalizations such as the single equation used above for n'th roots. Pure injective and pure projective modules follow closely from the ideas of Pr√ºfer's 1923 paper. While pure projective modules have not found as many applications as pure injectives, they are more closely related to the original work: A module is pure projective if it is a direct summand of a direct sum of finitely presented modules. In the case of the integers and Abelian groups a pure projective module amounts to a direct sum of cyclic groups. References * Chapter III.

According to The Guild of Music Supervisors, a music supervisor is ‚Äúa qualified professional who oversees all music related aspects of film, television, advertising, video games and other existing or emerging visual media platforms as required.‚ÄùGuild of Music Supervisors. In the musical theatre industry, a music supervisor is often responsible for managing a team of music directors working on any number of musical productions. Description A music supervisor is somebody with a broad and encyclopedic music expertise and a sophisticated knowledge of music licensing and negotiation. Typically, a music supervisor proposes previously recorded songs to the director or producer of a film, advertisement, television show, trailer, promo, video game, or any other form of visual media.Sobel, Ron, and Dick Weissman. Music Publishing: The Roadmap to Royalties. New York: Routledge, 2008. A music supervisor will usually act as a liaison between the creative and business ends of the process.Baskerville, David, PHD. Music Business and Career Guide. 2006. Sage Publications, CA. Once a song is approved, they approach the rights holders of that song to seek permission to license (usually creating master recording licenses and synchronization licenses) and to work out the financial details of the song's use. In many instances, the artist or songwriter of the recorded song is given the opportunity to accept or decline the synchronization of their song. This position is most active within media-based industries, including live events, television, film, advertising, theatre, and video gaming.Wentz, Brook. Hey, that‚Äôs my music!: Music supervision, licensing, and content acquisition. 2007. Hal Leonard Books, NY NY. Music supervisors may work within production companies, film studios, networks, music supervision companies, or do freelance work. Job responsibilities A supervisor's responsibilities are to locate, secure and oversee music related talent. They liaise between the rights holders of the recorded music involved and the director of the project they have been hired to work on. In addition, they advise, generate and work within financial parameters of the project they are hired to work on. They must deliver musical elements within a timely manner and secure legal rights of the song before it is used. The music supervisor will gather the appropriate information to list credits and, in certain cases, will manage royalty collection. The overarching responsibility of a music supervisor is to meet the needs of a project's director and producer. This means catering to the creative goals of a project under a strict budget: often less than 5% of a project's total budget. The director/producer will discuss their vision for the project with the music supervisor, and how they expect the music to enhance this vision. The visual media will then be spotted by the supervisor ‚Äì a process of choosing where selected music will be inserted. Traditional spots include the main title, opening credits, and closing credits, while additional spots are incorporated to trigger emotional responses from viewers. Scores, or background music, are also an important consideration for enhancing visual media. Scores can range from the background to a dramatic scene to television bumpers ‚Äì the music signifying leading into or coming back from a commercial break. After being given or creating a budget, the supervisor must select appropriate music for the project ‚Äì either by licensing existing songs/scores, or creating new songs/scores. In the selection process, a music supervisor may choose to seek the help of a third party licensing company or a music publisher, which will pitch songs to the supervisor from within their library of music. If creating new music, the supervisor may become responsible for additional roles, including securing artists or composers, facilitating the production and recording process, overseeing finances, and finalizing post-theatrical uses of the soundtrack. When using pre-existing music, the supervisor's duties focus on the legal and financial aspects of licensing and negotiating. A large percentage of a music supervisor's job revolves around music clearance alone. When it comes to royalty collections, a music supervisor will sometimes be in charge of arranging this source of the selected artist's revenue. Royalties for music placements are paid out by Performance Rights Organizations (such as ASCAP, BMI, and SESAC in the United States). In order to detect the placements an artist has made with visual media, these companies need to be aware of their placement. Depending on the type of project (ad placement, television show, etc.). the music supervisor will have to either make sure the artist is credited properly, send video clips of the placement to the publisher (which will then be sent to the proper Performance Rights Organization),or create a cue sheet of all of the songs used in the project Many directors and producers will choose to work with a single supervisor for a project, however it varies from project to project. For example, music supervisors can be hired at an entertainment company as an ‚Äúin house‚Äù staff member to manage the supervision for several projects (such as at an advertising agency). A production company may also hire a supervisor on a project-by-project basis (such as hiring one supervisor for an entire television series as seen with Gossip Girl or The O.C.). Music supervisors may also be hired on a show-by-show basis (ex. AMC's Mad Men, which has used multiple music supervisors). Qualifications/background A music supervisor must have a wide knowledge of music and a passion for musical research. There is no set educational or career path to become a music supervisor. Educational backgrounds range from Bachelor of Fine Arts in music to business degrees to no higher education at all. Because the majority of the position involves music negotiations, clearances, publishing/performing deals, etc., a legal background is an excellent qualification. Some supervisors are musicians, producers, agents, or managers ‚Äì experience with the music or film/television industries is a strong background upon which to build. Despite common misconceptions, musical knowledge (writing, reading, performing, composing) is not nearly as important as a familiarity with a broad range of music, including popular styles and artists, as well as the production/negotiating process itself. Author of Music Business Handbook and Career Guide David Baskerville notes \\"This is one of the few production specialties that has almost unlimited growth potential, because there [is] no universally accepted job description. The field remains wide open to people with connections and the ability to get the job done.\\" The proliferation of video technology has resulted in an increased demand for production companies needing to license music, and the field now accommodates many career professionals. Because of the massive expansion in the field, many colleges and universities offer courses in music supervision. For example, NYU Steinhardt's Music Business program offers a course titled ‚ÄúStrategic Music and Branding‚Äù.\\"Music Business Curriculum.\\" NYU Steinhardt. New York University, 2013. Salary Music supervisor salaries vary depending upon the project and the hiring process. Salaries can range from $35,000 annually at a music supervision firm, to upwards of $250,000 for a freelance supervisor per feature film (Austin). Music supervisors also have the opportunity to continue receiving funds through soundtrack royalties. It is generally more profitable (assuming one will be regularly hired) to work freelance jobs than to work for a larger corporation. However some supervisors may choose to work within a music supervision company (such as Chop Shop Music Supervision). In addition, music supervisors who work \\"in house\\" within an entertainment, such as an advertising agency or within the music department of a production company, will earn a salary based upon their ranking and company earnings. While staff jobs with a network, studio, or production company offer more security, the recognition and pay are significantly lower. Despite the environment, a music supervisor should always work out a contract including expectations, responsibilities, and payment before beginning a project. History Originally, music was used in silent films to hide mechanical noises within a theatre, like the projector. Often a musician would be present to play improvised or pre-selected pieces along with the visual images on screen.Schulenberg, Richard. Legal Aspects of the Music Industry: An Insider‚Äôs View. 1999. Billboard Books, New York New York. This led to the establishment of the soundtrack, and an emphasis on accompanying silent visual media with music. Over time, films began hiring composers to create instrumental soundtracks to accompany films. It became apparent to studios that when a movie included a hit song, more people were likely to see it, and as a result of that, more people were likely to purchase the song recording. The demand for music supervisors in the production process solidified in the 1980s, and has continued to grow with the popularity of media soundtracks.Austin, D., Austin, C., Peterik, Jim. Songwriting for Dummies, 2nd Edition. 2010. Wiley Publishing, Inc., Hoboken, NJ. While the use of songs not originally composed for the film did not save money, licensing a song made for a more stable understanding for the director and producer of the film what music was going to be used in the scene. Instead of having to wait for new instrumental music to be commissioned, they could have an understanding of what recording would be used before the film was finalized. This led to an emerging need for selecting and licensing songs, which is how the position of music supervisor developed. Taking advantage of this musical component has become an increasingly feasible marketing strategy for these media outlets, placing a growing responsibility on the music supervisor. Over the past decade, synchronization licensing has become one of the most significant ways for an artist to gain exposure and to earn money. Finding a way to a music supervisor can give an artist the opportunity to spread their music on a platform that would expose them to a much larger audience than they may have been able to find on their own. One of the most notable synchronization collaborations was with Moby's 1999 album Play, which was the first ever to have all of its tracks linked to a synchronization license.Smith, Ethan. \\"Organization Moby.\\" Wired May 2002.https://www.wired.com/wired/archive/10.05/moby.html The job of a music supervisor has only recently become increasingly significant and the importance of this position continues to grow. Institutions such as the Guild of Music Supervisors are promoting the understanding of music supervision. In 2007 several supervisors, in order to promote, pursue and recognize the craft of music supervision. Since 2011 guild has granted awards for excellence in the position. They encourage other institutions, such as the Hollywood Music and Media Awards, to acknowledge accomplishments in the field.

The Revolutionary Workers' Party (Trotskyist) was a socialist political party in Britain, based in Birmingham.Peter Barberis, John McHugh and Mike Tyldesley, Encyclopedia of British and Irish Political Organizations, London: Frances Pinter, 2000 History It was founded in 1963 by members of the Revolutionary Socialist League who supported the Fourth International of J. Posadas when it split from the International Secretariat of the Fourth International.http://posadiststoday.com/775-2/ The group began working on the European Marxist Review and publishing Red Flag. It later supported Sinn F√©in, the Black Panther Party and also worked within Labour Party Young Socialists. In the early 1970s, the party suffered a major split, with supporters of Dave Douglass leaving to form the Socialist Union (Internationalist). The remainder of the party remained loyal to Posadas' line; it continued with a very low level of activity after his death in 1981, and continued to publish Red Flag intermittently until the year 2000. Posadism The organisation adhered to Posadism, the theories of Argentine Trotskyist, J. Posadas. He was the author of a number of works with an unconventional slant; he tried to create a synthesis of Trotskyism and Ufology.

He is best known for his role in Ryuhei Kitamura's cult film, Versus. Since his debut, Sakaguchi has worked with Kitamura several times, often appearing alongside fellow Kitamura staple Hideo Sakaki. He has also worked with frequent Kitamura collaborators Yudai Yamaguchi and Yuji Shimomura. Sakaguchi is a talented martial artist, and most often appears in films featuring copious fight scenes, usually performing all of his own stunts. He is purportedly skilled in Bajiquan, Shorinji Kempo, Boxing, Kickboxing, and while recently filming Re:Born learned the tactical martial art Zero Range Combat developed by Yoshitaka Inagawa.  Biography  Before entering into the film industry, Sakaguchi was an underground street fighter who was well known for his skill in the martial arts. He was discovered by then-unknown director Ryuhei Kitamura, who recruited Sakaguchi for a lead role in Versus. Since then, Sakaguchi has appeared in several films directed by Kitamura, including the Azumi films, Kitamura's short in the Jam Films titled The Messenger, and minor roles in Aragami and Alive. He played a larger role in the quirky, yet successful Battlefield Baseball (produced by Kitamura and directed by Yudai Yamaguchi). 2006 saw Sakaguchi in more mainstream roles, such as Yashamaru in Shinobi: Heart Under Blade, and \\"Grave\\" in Death Trance. He also guest-starred in the Japanese tokusatsu show, Kamen Rider Kabuto, as the villain Reiji Nogi/Cassisworm. In 2008, Sakaguchi made his directorial debut with Sakigake!! Otokojuku (a.k.a. \\"Samurai School\\"), in which he also starred, wrote the screenplay, and choreographed the action sequences. He made a cameo appearance in Yoshihiro Nishimura's 2008 exploitation film, Tokyo Gore Police, as well as directed/starred in Yoroi: Samurai Zombie, based on a story by Ryuhei Kitamura. In 2011, Sakaguchi reprised his role as Yaky√ª Jubei in Deadball, a reimagining of Battlefield Baseball, and also co-directed/starred in Yakuza Weapon, based on the manga Gokud≈ç Heiki. In 2013, Sakaguchi announced his retirement from acting to focus on work behind the camera. Despite this, he is expected to reprise his role as KSC2-303 in Ryuhei Kitamura's Versus 2, and has stated that he is currently working on a sequel to Death Trance.

Seeing limited service with the Royal Navy, the ship was loaned to the Royal Canadian Navy in March 1928. The destroyer served primarily as a training vessel until 1936 when the vessel was discarded. Design During the First World War, Royal Navy intelligence investigated German torpedo craft and found that they were more lightly armed than the designs the United Kingdom was building. The Royal Navy altered their destroyer designs so that the ships would be less expensive. This meant that the design known as the Admiralty modified 'Trenchant' or S class would be smaller, faster and less expensive, ships which could be built quickly. The ships had a complement of 90 officers and ratings.Gardiner & Gray, p. 85 The Thornycroft version of the S-class displaced . The vessels were long, had a beam of and a draught of . They were larger than their sister ships of the Yarrow or Admiralty design. The S class had a trawler-like bow with a more sharply sheered and turtleback forecastle. The Thornycroft S-class design was propelled by two shafts driven by Brown-Curtis steam turbines powered by three Yarrow boilers (built by Thornycroft). This created .Parkes, 1933 This gave the ships a maximum speed of . S-class destroyers were armed with three quick- firing (QF) /45 calibre Mk IV guns in three single mounts. The forecastle gun was placed on a raised platform. They were also equipped with a QF 2-pounder (40 mm) pom-pom for use against aircraft. The vessels also had four Lewis machine guns installed. All S-class destroyers had four torpedo tubes installed in two twin mounts. Unlike the Admiralty and Yarrow designs, all Thornycroft designed ships were equipped with two 18-inch (450 mm) torpedo tubes. Arrayed along the sides of the ship, they were fitted to fire through a narrow aperture. Service history =Royal Navy= Toreador was ordered in June 1917 as part of the second order of Thornycroft S-class destroyer for the Royal Navy. She was laid down in November 1917 and launched on 7 December 1918. She was placed in reserve at HMNB Portsmouth in May 1919. =Royal Canadian Navy= The former HMCS Vancouver being prepared for recycling. Toreador, along with her sister , were loaned by the British government to Canada in 1927 to replace their two existing destroyers, and .German (1990), p. 59.Johnston et al., p. 1009 At the same time the Canadian Government commissioned the construction of two further destroyers, and at Portsmouth.Macpherson & Barrie, p. 14 The vessel was renamed Vancouver, after the famous explorer, George Vancouver. Vancouver and Champlain were the first two ships with names associated with Canada. During the 1930s Vancouver served on the west coast of Canada alongside Skeena.German (1990), p. 62 The vessel was used as a training vessel, visiting many ports along the coast.Johnston et al., p. 1016 In 1930, Vancouver was named in the London Naval Treaty, which put limits on the amount of warships a nation could have and their size. Initially the west coast training ships did not have a cruise through the Caribbean Sea like their east coast comrades. However, after a couple of winters in Canadian waters, Vancouver was sent to join Champlain in the West Indies.Johnston et al. p. 1017 In 1931, the British Foreign Office requested that Canada send one of its vessels to El Salvador due to an increased threat to British persons and property there following a rebellion until a Royal Navy ship could arrive. Arriving on 23 January 1932, Vancouver and Skeena went to separate ports initially. Vancouver was sent to Port La Union, where the ship refueled and re-provisioned. While there the British Charge d'Affairs sent an order by telephone for the ship to land an armed platoon, however, the order was never followed. Most of the time at Port La Union was spent passing idle and the destroyer remained there until 25 January when she departed for Acajutla. She remained at Acajutla until after the senior officers had returned from their inspection of what became known as la matanza.Johnston et al. pp. 1029‚Äì30 During a training deployment to the Caribbean Sea in 1934, Vancouver took part in the longest cruise attempted by the Royal Canadian Navy to that point. On that same deployment, the ship spent one week training with the British Home Fleet.Johnston et al., p. 1037 By 1935 the condition of the two S-class destroyers in Canadian service had deteriorated significantly. Custom at this time was to give an active destroyer a thorough and complete refit (referred to as a D2) every six to eight years. Vancouver, which had been completed in 1918, had never undergone such a refit. She and her sister ship were surveyed by naval engineers in 1934 and the report concluded that it would cost $165,000 to refit both ships.Johnston et al, p. 1052 This had to be done as the loan conditions with the British government stipulated that the ships had to be returned in good condition. Rendering them safe for an ocean crossing to the United Kingdom would still cost $50,000 more than a standard refit. Canada intended to return the S-class destroyers to the United Kingdom as they were considered antiquated. The United Kingdom initially wanted to have them scrapped at home, however they agreed to have them broken up in Canada as they were no longer sure of the two vessels crossing the ocean. It was also agreed that the armament of the destroyers would remain in Canadian stockpiles after the ships were broken up.Johnston et al., p. 1078 Vancouver were noted as being set for disposal in 1936. She was paid off on 25 November 1936 and broken up in 1937.

While he was mentioned by Eloy d'Amerval as one of the greatest composers of the age, and resident in Paradise, relatively few of his works have survived. He was a contemporary of Johannes Ockeghem, and spent his life in the Burgundian Netherlands, France and Italy. Life Fed√© was probably from the region of Artois, most likely from Douai, based on the presence of several possible relatives of his at Cambrai Cathedral, several of whom had \\"of Douai\\" appended to their names. From 1439 to 1440 he was vicar at St. Am√© in Douai. By 1443 he had gone to Italy, a region which was to become a common destination for composers from northern Europe for the next one hundred fifty years: Fed√© sang in the papal chapel in Rome. From July 1445 to March 1446 he worked in Ferrara, at the court chapel of Leonello d'Este. Fed√© thus was one of the earliest composers from northern Europe to work in Ferrara, a rich center of artistic patronage, which was to become a center of musical innovation for the remainder of the Renaissance. Later in 1446 he was back in Cambrai, working as \\"petit vicar\\" at the cathedral there. He did not stay long, for by 1449 he was in Paris, employed by the Ste Chapelle as a chaplain, where he stayed until 1450, and in 1451 he was part of the chapel of Charles VII (Charles d'Orl√©ans). After the death of Charles in 1461 (and a 10-year gap in his record), Fed√© served in the chapel of Queen Marie d'Anjou, until she died in 1463. In 1466 he likely returned to Italy briefly, for his name appears in the rolls of the singers at St. Peter's in Rome, but he probably returned to France shortly thereafter. Three other employment records remain in France: a payment note at Ste Chapelle in Bourges in 1472-1473, another at the royal chapel of Louis XI in 1473, and a series of payments between 1472 and 1477 at the Ste Chapelle in Paris. Fed√© probably died in Paris in 1477, since the payments stopped then, but no exact record of his death remains. Music and influence Fed√© wrote both sacred and secular music, but only a few pieces have survived of what may have been a substantial output, based on his reputation, and his appearance as one of the great composers of the age in Eloy's massive 1508 poem, which listed the composers resident in Heaven. Several two-voice settings of the Magnificat by Fed√© survive in manuscripts preserved at Ferrara. Some of his secular pieces, a rondeau and two virelai, survive in a chansonnier from Nivelles, but were not recovered until the development of ultraviolet document-recovery technology in 1984, for most of them had been carefully erased. The apparent deliberate eradication of only Fed√©'s music from this collection suggests that the original owner of the book either did not care for the composer or the music. Stylistically his music is typical of French music of the middle 15th century, including the use of fauxbourdon, but no focused scholarly analysis has yet been performed on his five compositions with reliable attribution.

Initially titled The Art Baker Show, the program originally aired on American television between 1950 and 1959. Later versions of the series were seen in 1972, 1981, and 2000. On the show, viewers were asked to send in postcards describing something that they wanted to see on television, such as the reenactment of William Tell shooting an apple off his son's head. (1950 US national archery champion Stan Overby performed the feat, shooting an apple off his assistant's head.) The show was originally broadcast live, so some of the riskier propositions took on added elements of danger and suspense. A segment where animal trainer and stuntman, Reed Parham wrestled a huge, deadly anaconda, for example, nearly became disastrous until assistants interceded with guns drawn, visibly unnerving host Art Baker. Guest stars Baker was fond of granting requests to see show-business personalities. He reunited the Our Gang troupe of the 1920s (Johnny Downs, Joe Cobb, Mickey Daniels, Allen \\"Farina\\" Hoskins, and Jackie Condon), and staged encore performances by singers Gloria Jean, Nick Lucas and Arthur Lee Simpkins; comedians Buster Keaton, Eddie Gribbon, and El Brendel with his wife Flo Bert; European musical entertainer Yonelli; actor Bela Lugosi and cowboy bullwhip artist Whip Wilson, among many others. Short film clips were also presented, with the selection based upon viewer requests. As a consequence, many of the clips were presented multiple times. Some of the more popular clips included a tour of the bizarre Winchester Mystery House and the collapse of the first Tacoma Narrows Bridge. The program was named The Art Baker Show, after the series creator and host. In April 1951, the show‚Äôs title was changed to You Asked for It. Originally airing on the DuMont Television Network from December 29, 1950, to December 7, 1951, it moved to ABC, where it remained until the end of its original run on September 27, 1959. The show was sponsored by Skippy Peanut Butter and Studebaker Automobiles. Art Baker hosted the show until early 1958, when Jack Smith took over for the remaining 20 months. During the Smith years, memorable segments included a profile of Dr. John Ott's elaborate automated time-lapse multiple camera greenhouse filming the growth of plants (plugging his 1958 book My Ivory Cellar), a man who wanted to see his bit part in a silent movie after about forty years, and how a dangerous fire collapsing building stunt sequence was filmed with stunt people rolling into a hidden pit at the last possible second. Later versions After ABC canceled the original show in 1959, various revivals have aired in the decades since: *An all-new version of You Asked For It began to air in syndication in 1972, and was also hosted by Jack Smith. *In 1981, another syndicated version went on the air as The New You Asked For It, with impressionist Rich Little as the host and Jayne Kennedy as co-host. Jack Smith served as a narrator on this version, voicing the clips from the older shows, and took over as host in the show's second season. This incarnation lasted until the summer of 1983. *The Family Channel had a version of their own from 1991 to 1992 called You Asked For It, Again with Jimmy Brogan as the host. *In spring of 2000, a short-lived version, hosted by comedian Phil Morris, aired on NBC. In popular culture In the Happy Days episode \\"Fearless Fonzarelli\\" (aired September 30, 1975), Fonzie (Henry Winkler) jumps his motorcycle over fourteen garbage cans.

You Wanted To See It shows up again in the Weezer video \\"Buddy Holly\\" which shows the band playing at Arnold's Drive- In, a popular diner in the Happy Days sitcom.

Although the figures are intended as Eleanor of Aquitaine, Henry II of England, and William Marshall, the story is an entire invention. Synopsis The song exists in various versions, but the essential elements are as follows: Queen Eleanor lies dying. She wishes to confess her sins to save her soul on her deathbed, but she fears that if she confesses to an English priest, he will divulge her wrongdoings to her husband, King Henry of England. Thus, she sends to France for a priest with no loyalty to the English crown (in some versions her fear of being found out is stated directly; in others, it is implied). When King Henry hears that she has sent overseas for a priest, he suspects that his wife the queen has betrayed him in some way (again, this is stated more directly in some versions than in others). To gain information about this suspected betrayal, he hatches a plan. He suggests to his friend and associate, Earl Marshall, that they both disguise themselves as French priests and go to hear the queen's confession. Earl Marshall instantly refuses (in some versions of the ballad), saying that to \\"beguile\\" the queen in this way is a punishable crime for which he'll surely be hanged. (The implication is that Earl Marshall knows very well what the content of the queen's confession will be and does not want to be there with King Henry when she delivers it.) Desperate to learn what the queen has been doing behind his back, King Henry swears a royal oath (in most versions of the ballad) to Earl Marshall that regardless of what the queen might say, no official record will be made of it and no one will ever know that Earl Marshall helped deceive the queen. Earl Marshall relents, and the two men, dressed as French priests, go to hear the queen's deathbed confession. Queen Eleanor reveals several shocking sins. These vary depending on the version of the ballad, but in most versions she admits: a) she lost her virginity to Earl Marshall and not to the king; b) she has tried to poison King Henry (in some versions, she says she successfully poisoned Rosamund Clifford, the king's mistress); and c) she adores her son fathered by Earl Marshall and reviles the son she has borne to King Henry. The king by now is livid and, throwing off his disguise, he reveals himself to the horrified queen. The ballad ends as King Henry says that were it not for his royal oath, he would kill Earl Marshall.

History In 1913, Frederick C. Clift, an attorney from a large family in the Sierra foothills, commissioned a 300-room hotel on a lot the family had inherited. The architect, a former student of Ecole de Beaux Arts, was George Applegarth and Kenneth A. MacDonald Jr. of MacDonald and Applegarth, the former of whom also designed the Palace of the Legion of Honor. The hotel opened on February 1, 1915, to serve crowds attending the Panama‚ÄìPacific International Exposition. Advertised as the first hotel in San Francisco to be fire and earthquake proof, with its 1924 addition of 3 floors, it became the largest hotel in the state. The hotel's Art Deco Redwood Room bar was added in 1933, paneled with wood from a single redwood tree. Canadian Four Seasons Hotels acquired an interest in the hotel in 1976, and began managing it as their first US property. Two years later, in 1978, they renamed it the Four Seasons Clift Hotel. On February 21, 1995, Four Seasons sold their interest in the property and it became The Clift, a Grand Heritage Hotel. Ian Schrager Hotels took over management in 1997, and the hotel became simply Clift. Schrager bought the hotel outright in 1999, for $80 million. Soon after, he oversaw a $50 million complete renovation, which involved the restoration of the Redwood Room, and the gutting and redesign of much of the rest of the hotel, by designer Philippe Starck. The hotel reopened on August 3, 2001. Starck's lobby featured his furniture collection, including chairs from Ray and Charles Eames, furniture by Salvador Dali, and a stool by Roberto Matta (inspired by Ren√© Margritte). Sonesta Hotels assumed management of the hotel in May 2018 and it was renamed The Clift Royal Sonesta Hotel.

It supported the elected government of Ahmed Tejan Kabbah against the rebel groups Revolutionary United Front (RUF) and Armed Forces Revolutionary Council (AFRC). Much of the CDF was made up of the Kamajors group, which is part of the larger Mende ethnic group. The Kamajors believed in many magical ways of defending themselves, such as rituals to create bulletproof skin. Three leaders of the CDF were indicted at the Special Court for Sierra Leone, more specifically Samuel Hinga Norman (head of the CDF), Moinina Fofana (second in command) and Allieu Kondewa (military commander of the CDF).  History  The term ‚ÄúCivil Defense Forces‚Äù was first coined in between 1997 and 1998 by expatriate Sierra Leoneans in Monrovia. The title encompassed ‚Äúdisparate militias previously referred to by ethnically coded titles‚Äù.Hoffman, Danny. \\"The Meaning of a Militia: Understanding the Civil Defence Forces of Sierra Leone.\\" African Affairs 106.425 (2010): 636-62. Oxford Journals. Web. 8 Dec. 2010. . The CDF included soldiers from the militia groups the Kuranko tamaboro, the Mende kamajoisia, the Temne gbethis and kapras, and the Kono donsos.Hoffman, Danny. \\"The Meaning of a Militia: Understanding the Civil Defence Forces of Sierra Leone.\\" African Affairs 106.425 (2010): 636-62. Oxford Journals. Web. 8 Dec. 2010. . The goal of the overarching title was to create a sense of unity and prerogative between the independent militias. The largest group involved with the CDF was the kamajoisia, or kamajors. Traditionally, the title ‚Äúkamajors‚Äù is used to refer to the Mende belief in ‚Äúspecialized hunters empowered to use both firearms and occult ‚Äòmedicines‚Äô in pursuit of big game‚Äù and against all other forces that threatened Mende villages.Hoffman, Danny. \\"The Meaning of a Militia: Understanding the Civil Defence Forces of Sierra Leone.\\" African Affairs 106.425 (2010): 636-62. Oxford Journals. Web. 8 Dec. 2010. . In Mende culture, the identity of the kamajors is synonymous with protection, and represented a similar meaning when community defense militias mobilized in reaction to the Sierra Leonean government‚Äôs failure to defeat the rebel forces of the Revolutionary United Front (RUF). The militia groups became increasingly consolidated as civilians came to distrust the military, which they saw as being as dangerous as the rebel groups. They soon fell under the influence and direction of academic Dr Alpha Lavalie and the National Provisional Ruling Council (NPRC) Secretary of State East, Lieutenant Tom Nyuma.Hoffman, Danny. \\"The Meaning of a Militia: Understanding the Civil Defence Forces of Sierra Leone.\\" African Affairs 106.425 (2010): 636-62. Oxford Journals. Web. 8 Dec. 2010. . The CDF increased its prominence and influence following the election of the Sierra Leone People‚Äôs Party into office in 1996, which was largely composed of Mende members. Sam Hinga Norman, the Regent Chief of Jiama-Bongor chiefdom, became a key figure in the kamajor movement and was appointed as the SLPP's Deputy Minister of Defense. The CDF was widely viewed as the de facto security force for the SLPP, and would come into direct conflict with the military after the military‚Äôs ousting of the SLPP government in May 1997. In coordination with the Nigerian-based Economic Community of West African States Monitoring Group (ECOMOG), the CDF was able to reinstate the SLPP to power in March 1998, and would be officially constituted until the civil war was officially declared over in January 2002.Hoffman, Danny. \\"The Meaning of a Militia: Understanding the Civil Defence Forces of Sierra Leone.\\" African Affairs 106.425 (2010): 636-62. Oxford Journals. Web. 8 Dec. 2010. .  Atrocities  The CDF committed a vast number of atrocities and human rights abuses during the Sierra Leonean civil war. During the war, while fighting alongside the Nigerian ECOMOG troops, the CDF was either complicit or directly responsible for many of the events brought before the Special Court for Sierra Leone. In the offensive of January 1999 the CDF was accused of committing upwards of 180 executions of captured RUF members without validating their guilt. Furthermore, around the towns of Bradford and Moyamba, members of the Kamajors posed as rebels and launched multiple attacks on the civilian population that included robbery and indiscriminant murder.\\"Africa 10.\\" Home  Human Rights Watch. Web. 08 Dec. 2010. . There have also been countless accounts of CDF abuses on children as well as the indoctrination and forced subordination of child soldiers.\\"Africa 10.\\" Home  Human Rights Watch. Web. 08 Dec. 2010. . School destroyed by Sierra Leone Civil War  Indictments  In 2003 the Special Court for Sierra Leone was set up in cooperation with the United Nations to bring those responsible for the greatest crimes in the country‚Äôs civil war to be prosecuted. Among the 13 convictions that were handed out were three prominent CDF members. The three men indicted were Allie Kondewa, Moinina Fofana and Samuel Hinga Norman.Hoffman, Danny. \\"The Meaning of a Militia: Understanding the Civil Defence Forces of Sierra Leone.\\" African Affairs 106.425 (2010): 636-62. Oxford Journals. Web. 8 Dec. 2010. . Each of these men had been decided upon as the central leaders of the CDF and the most responsible for the crimes after a thorough investigation by the Court, which took the testimonies of thousands of victims. The trial began in July 2004 and concluded in September 2006. Before sentences could be handed out Samuel Hinga Norman died of natural causes during surgery in Dakar, Senegal.Hoffman, Danny. \\"The Meaning of a Militia: Understanding the Civil Defence Forces of Sierra Leone.\\" African Affairs 106.425 (2010): 636-62. Oxford Journals. Web. 8 Dec. 2010. . Fofana and Kondewa were found guilty of the charges of murder, pillage and the use of child soldiers and were sentenced to six and eights years respectively.

A 2D side-scrolling platform/adventure video game developed by Recreational Brainware and published by Sega on the Sega Mega Drive/Genesis in 1992. Different games were also developed by NuFX and released on the Game Gear and by Technical Wave on the Master System. Other different Taz-Mania games were also published by Sunsoft and released on the SNES and 2 games on the Game Boy were made too. One from David A. Palmer Productions and published by Sunsoft and another from Beam Software and published by THQ. Plot The plot of the game was actually a twist on the usual \\"Save the World\\" story setting for many platform/adventure games. One evening, Hugh Tazmanian Devil was telling his three children (Taz, his sister Molly and his brother Jake) an intriguing tale: Once there were huge giant seabirds that laid giant eggs which could feed a family of Tazmanian devils for over a year. There are also legends that somewhere along the island of Tasmania, there is a Lost Valley, where the giant seabirds still nest. Taz becomes fascinated by the prospect of the potentially large omelet and leaves in search for one of those giant eggs. Thus, the player must direct Taz across various stages in search for the Lost Valley and its Giant Bird. Gameplay Players control Taz as he searches for the giant egg. Taz is able to jump, spin into a tornado and eat various objects. Spinning into a tornado allows Taz to defeat most enemies, as well as gain extra jump distance, knock away items and get past certain obstacles unharmed. Taz has the ability to eat most, if not all items throughout the level, such as health recovering food items, extra lives and continues. Eating some chilli peppers allows Taz to breathe fire in order to defeat stronger enemies, while eating a star grants Taz temporary invincibility. Other items, such as bombs and weed killer can be thrown at enemies, but will damage Taz if he eats them. Development Recreational Brainware was led by 2 programmers ‚Äì Burt Sloane and Jonathan Miller and was based in San Francisco. A semi- sequel to this game in design and concept but unrelated to the Taz-Mania cartoon series was also developed and released by Sega on the same platforms in between 1994 and 1996, entitled Taz in Escape from Mars. An official sequel titled Taz-Mania 2 was planned with an isometric viewpoint, but was never put into development. Reception The Mega Drive version was a bestseller in the UK for 2 months.Official Gallup UK Mega Drive sales chart, October 1992, published in Mega (magazine) issue 1 Mega placed the game at #19 in their Top Mega Drive Games of All Time.Mega magazine issue 1, page 76, Future Publishing, Oct 1992 Entertainment Weekly gave the game a B.

Sveti Klement island and Palmi≈æana are geographically located in the Paklinski Islands archipelago and administratively they are part of the Split-Dalmatia County of Croatia. Palmi≈æana has a marina with room for 200 boats, a small shop and a tourist information office.  History  The name is a misnomer and it comes from the word ‚ÄúPaklina‚Äù, which is a derivative of pine resin used for filling the gaps between the keel and the boat. During ancient times these island were used as ports for merchant and war navies of the ancient Phoenicians, Greeks, Romans and all other conquerors of these shores. From Venice until Libya there isn‚Äôt a place that offers such an abundance of shelter from any wind direction. Tourism Tourism on Palmi≈æana was established in 1906 by Professor Eugen Meneghello on his 300-year-old estate. He imported exotic plants from all over the world and created the rare and magnificent botanical park. Eugen's son, Giorgio Meneghello Toto, one of world's best grouper fishers, built the island's complex and his wife, Dagmar (n√©e: Gebauer), has been managing Palmi≈æana for over 30 years. Currently, Dagmar manages Palmi≈æana with the help of her three children and her grandson.  Plants  The rosemary, which blooms several times a year on every slope on Palmi≈æana, filling the air with its heady scent, gave Palmizana its second name: \\"The Island of the Rosemary\\". Aloe, another plant, also grows everywhere. Sites This area of the Adriatic hides the greatest number of antique shipwrecks and places on the sea-bed where one can easily find amphore. The Meneghello family amphore collection is one of the biggest in the Adriatic because of this. The sea around the Palmi≈æana is a treasury of fish, coral and incredibly beautiful undersea landscapes. The botanical gardens of Palmi≈æana are full of exotic plants, tree-like opuntias, agaves, numerous other cacti and succulents, mimosas, eucalyptuses, laurels, olives and different kinds of aromatic herbs and plants. Cuisine Exquisite traditional Palmi≈æana cuisine is praised for its delicious specialities, based on fish, lobsters, scampi, shellfish and other seafood served with fresh vegetables from the island gardens. The cuisine has been declared one of the best in the Mediterranean by the German Magazine Boote, English Traveler and Croatian magazines Gloria and Playboy. The Marina ACI marina Palmi≈æana lies in Palmi≈æana Bay on the northeastern coast of St. Clement Island. The marina is protected from all winds except those from the north and northeast, while strong south and southwest winds can cause swells. The marina has room for 200 boats and is open from the middle of March to the end of October. The marina has 160 berths, all with water and power supply. The harbor has a reception facility, exchange office, restaurant, toilets and showers, and grocery store. The nearest gas station (2.5 Nm) is in the Hvar harbor (Kri≈æna luka). Since August, 1999, ACI marina Palmi≈æana has continuous power supply and more power supply at the marina piers. The marina is situated in one of the safest natural harbors on the Adriatic Sea, renowned for its safety since ancient times. It is situated 3,5 km from Hvar. It offers 190 moorings with optional connections to the water and electric power, telephone and VHF links.

He often used a pseudonym for his film work, chiefly Jack Randall, though he played roles as Allen Byron and Byron Vance too. Early life The reference book Who's Who in Hollywood gives Randall's place of birth as Quincy, Illinois. Film career Randall began his career as a supporting actor and foil at RKO, but he left when Monogram Pictures promised him the chance to star in films. They were true to their word, and he appeared in a series of Western films through the 1930s and 1940s. (In 1935, he actually played a star of Westerns in RKO's Another Face, released in 1935.) Many of Randall's early B-movies with Monogram feature him as a singing cowboy, but his later roles were generally straight Western stories, and all were hampered by the low budgets typical of that studio. Many of his cowboy characters were named \\"Jack\\". Randall adopted his new \\"Allen Byron\\" identity in the 1940s in an effort to boost his fading professional fortunes, but the roles he received with new studio Producers Releasing Corporation were not up to the task. He died unexpectedly in 1945 while filming a serial called The Royal Mounted Rides Again for Universal Studios, after a fall from a horse at Canoga Park, California, in which he struck a tree.Associated Press, \\"Cowboy Actor - Husband Of Barbara Bennett Killed\\", The San Bernardino Daily Sun, San Bernardino, California, Tuesday 17 July 1945, Volume 51, page 1.

It centers around a space flight attempt and the efforts of Coyote and several Oriental antagonists to stop it. The IRS (Inquisition for Revenue Securement) and NASA (National Astral Spellcraft Administration) also become involved. The two main characters from Operation Chaos, Steve Matuchek, a werewolf and engineer for Nornwell Scrytronics, and Virginia \\"Ginny\\" Matuchek continue in their fight against the forces of evil. Now married and in their 40s, they have three children‚ÄîVal, the child they rescued from Hell in Operation Chaos when she was 3, now 14‚Äì15 years old; Ben, 10 years old; and Chryssa, 4 years old. A few characters from Operation Chaos also reappear, such as Barney Sturlason, Steve's boss, and Bob Shining Knife, a Native American F.B.I. agent, though they have small roles in this novel. Plot summary The world of Operation Luna has an alternative history, which mostly resembled our own until a great \\"Awakening\\" brought awareness of supernatural forces to the world at large. This Awakening led to drastic changes in society; industrial machinery was largely replaced by technology driven by magic, spells, and \\"goetic forces\\" instead of fossil fuels and electricity. For example, the main mode of transportation is broomsticks and magic carpets fitted with cabins for people to sit in; radios are called \\"runers,\\" apparently activated by runes; and the propulsion behind space flight is achieved by a combination of mechanical technology, spelled crystals, and arcane materials such as mummy dust. Steve helped in the construction of a spacecraft for Operation Selene, the United States' first attempt to send a manned craft to the Moon. However, a disaster caused by beings adverse to the mission destroy the vehicle and nearly kill the celestonaut, Curtice Newton, although Steve, in wolf form, saves her. Afterward, Steve, Ginny, and a handful of people begin to investigate the disaster and make plans to put Operation Luna into effect, a smaller version of Operation Selene independent from NASA. Since the identities of the entities behind the Operation Selene disaster remain somewhat veiled and mysterious, Steve and Ginny enlist the help of a number of people, including Balawahdiwa, a Zuni high priest; Fotherwick-Botts, an enchanted sword that can talk; and Fjalar, a Norwegian dwarf who forged Fotherwick-Botts. Though the characters live in Gallup, New Mexico, the characters travel to various other locations in their investigations, including London, England, various parts of Norway, and even Yggdrasil, the legendary Norse site of the World Tree. The time period is roughly in the late 1990s. Although vague, their initial investigations reveal that the malevolent spirits who collaborated with Coyote are Asian in origin, leading them to suspect a connection to Dr. Fu Ch'ing, a Chinese scientist, government agent, and thaumaturge. (The U.S.' largest competitor for space exploration in the novel is China rather than Russia.) Meanwhile, the F.B.I. suspects Ginny's brother, Will, an astronomer who helped in the planning of Operation Selene and who has an interest in Chinese culture and connections with people in the country. Steve and Ginny themselves worry that he may be possessed by an evil spirit, though tests reveal no trace of a foreign entity. Themes There are a number of themes explored in this book. Among them are: * Religious diversity: Although the narrator, Steve, hints at his and his wife's vague Christianity mitigated by agnosticism, and the existence of a \\"One True God\\" is assumed, the reality of a diverse number of religious traditions is affirmed, including Native American (specifically Zuni) beliefs, Norse mythology, Asian traditions (specifically Chinese mythology), and Judaism (in a small part, as Steve regards the holiness of his Jewish neighbors with reverence). Though Steve sees deities in other pantheons as powerful creatures subservient to the power of the One True God, the beliefs of followers have an important role in the power and disposition toward humanity of such beings. Also, holiness is regarded as something admirable in and of itself, no matter the tradition, so long as the spiritual principles behind it are benign. *Political satire: As in Operation Chaos, Anderson's libertarian ideas are reflected in the portrayal of government. While Anderson had a disdain for some leftist ideas (such as protestation against scientific research and anarchist ideals, more clearly evident in Operation Chaos), his criticism of \\"big government\\" and bureaucracy also shines through, as the I.R.S. draws the characters into a financial nightmare, beleaguering them with obscure tax codes. *Racism and colonialism: Because the site of Operation Selene is amidst Native American reservations, the characters confront the question of white atrocities. Some Native Americans see NASA's site as an incursion on sacred land, while others bless the site with protection spells. Steve deals with these issues by asserting to his companion, Balawahdiwa, and several deities who he encounters, that though whites have engaged in horrible things, so have Native Americans, citing everything from large mammals in North America to the more malicious activities of tribes such as the Apache and Anasazi. Although Steve's (and perhaps Anderson's) view may be seen as a case of special pleading, those who ally with him agree that the forces they fight against are malevolent to the Earth itself, to humanity and nature, not just to whites. Colonial attitudes are also exposed in other characters, such as Fotherwick-Botts, largely an English nationalist (since most of his battles were carried out by Englishmen), who has a prejudice against \\"natives\\". *Scientific progress: With the very different principles that their world operates under, Steve and Will discuss the possible limitations of technology without the influence of magic. For example, they imagine what it would be like if Albert Einstein and Max Planck did not synthesize their ideas, which would result in separate theories of relativity and quantum mechanics. Also, the relevance and viability of space exploration is also questioned. Though not given as much space as might be expected, Anderson was a supporter of space exploration, and the adversity encountered by public and governmental voices is challenged by the benefits that will be gained through knowledge of the cosmos. *Gender roles: Though not directly discussed, some of the characters, especially Ginny, are powerful women, and some of the male characters (such as Fjalar and Fotherwick-Botts) have more traditional views of women as domestic servants. However, even those characters come to respect the power that the women have, and Steve, who fits a largely masculine stereotype, often remarks that Ginny has much more power than he does, and in several situations he has to sit aside while she effects spells or does research he is not able to do.

The character was created and introduced by William J. Bell, and debuted in the episode airing on October 18, 1994. Phyllis was originally and most notably portrayed by actress Michelle Stafford, until August 2013 (other than Sandra Nelson portraying Phyllis for nearly two years, until Stafford was brought back by former head writer, Kay Alden, in 2000). Stafford has been praised for her portrayal, for which she has won two Daytime Emmy Awards, but left the series after nearly sixteen years, with the character being written into a coma; Stafford last appeared on August 2, 2013. The role passed to Gina Tognoni, who debuted on August 11, 2014, and continued for nearly five years until she departed in June 2019, when Stafford re-claimed the role. Phyllis was introduced as a groupie of fictional rock singer Danny Romalotti (Michael Damian), and claimed to have given birth to his child, Daniel (Michael Graziadei). Danny married Phyllis out of obligation to his son, sparking a rivalry between Phyllis and Danny's ex-wife, Christine Blair (Lauralee Bell), which is a continuing storyline. The character is known for scheming to get what she wants. Phyllis has also been involved with Jack Abbott (Peter Bergman) and Nicholas Newman (Joshua Morrow); both relationships have fan followings.  Casting  Stafford made her debut on October 18, 1994. Her stint on the soap opera was initially a short-term role; however, her work impressed the producers and she was placed on contract. On February 14, 1997, Stafford left the soap opera to pursue other career opportunities, and the role was recast with Sandra Nelson. She portrayed the role from March 21, 1997, until February 22, 1999.The Young and the Restless recap (February 18, 1999) - Soapcentral.com In July 2000, Stafford was brought back to the soap opera by former head writer Kay Alden. Stafford first aired on July 13 of that year. The Young and the Restless recap (July 14, 2000) - Soapcentral.com Speaking of her return, Stafford stated:https://www.webcitation.org/6IlYbj8Qv?url=http://www.cbs.com/Common/text/daytime/yr/chats/mstafford.htm In 2009, Stafford signed a new contract with The Young and the Restless which would ensure her portrayal of Phyllis for an unspecified period of time. In May 2013, it was announced that Stafford would be exiting the soap opera after sixteen years in the role. Stafford later confirmed that her final scenes would air sometime that August. In July 2013, Stafford appeared on the cover of Soap Opera Digest which was dubbed \\"Her Final Interview.\\" In the interview with editor Stephanie Sloane, she confessed that she was completely done with the soap opera, though wouldn't mind if the role of Phyllis was recast, stating: \\"They may, as a courtesy, ask if I wanted to come back; I don't know, they may not. It's okay with me. It doesn't matter because I am done. I'm completely done. And I'm not upset if they recast, I totally would understand.\\" Stafford also stated she had some ideas for a recast, but would not detail the specifics of those ideas. Stafford also opened up as to her reasons for departing the series, stating, \\"There were other things that I really wanted to do. And the way that the show runs right now, the climate of daytime, the producers, the company, isn‚Äôt so apt to be as accommodating with other projects. I don‚Äôt say that as a criticism; as a producer, I‚Äôd do the same. And recently, probably at the end of last year, I was considering it seriously. I think it coincided with my sister getting sick in September, and being a mother, and really thinking about life, the future and other things that I wanted to create,‚Äù says Stafford on why she decided to leave the show. ‚ÄúThere were a lot of personal reasons that I just think are not important to share with the world. Only my good friends should know.\\" Stafford exited the series on August 2, 2013. In May 2014, when Stafford joined the cast of General Hospital in the role of Nina Clay, the show went ahead with plans to recast the role of Phyllis. On May 22, 2014, reports surfaced that former One Life to Live and Guiding Light actress Gina Tognoni had been cast in the role of Phyllis, following her \\"flawless\\" audition. Tognoni began taping on July 9 and made her debut on August 11, 2014. In March 2019, Daytime Confidential reported that Tognoni had been let go from the soap, with Stafford returning to the role. Tognoni made her last appearance on June 7, 2019; Stafford returned during the final moments of the June 17, 2019, episode.  Development  When she debuted, Phyllis was known to scheme to get what she wanted. The Record said she is \\"usually scheming and she wouldn't have her any other way.\\" Of her \\"damaged\\" familial background, Stafford stated: \\"I think Phyllis is looking for something she decided must exist in life that maybe doesn‚Äôt. She is looking for something she never had, which is a family unit and real love. She is looking for that and she is thinking that it should be a certain way, because it is not what she had. In truth, that thing that she is looking for might not even exist. But she is trying to find it.\\" Phyllis' first romance on the soap opera was with Danny Romalotti (Michael Damian), whom she conned into believing he had fathered a child with her. During their loveless marriage, Stafford stated: \\"Phyllis is trying to figure out how to hold on to (her husband) Danny. Her shrink tells her, 'Don't exaggerate your sexuality.' But she doesn't get it. Danny isn't even the father of the baby. That's something that might come up later. But in the meantime, this woman is going to get him.\\" When he discovered her deception, a vicious divorce battle ensued. They later briefly remarried before Danny obtained custody of Phyllis' son, Daniel, and left town with him. Upon her return in 2000, Phyllis began dating Jack Abbott (Peter Bergman) and they were later married. Of their romance, Bergman stated: \\"These two were perfectly wrong for each other. These two people cared about each other and wanted this to work in the worst possible way, but just couldn‚Äôt make it work. That is not normal for soaps. It was fun to play and for the audience to watch, because these two people were desperately loving each other and they are destructive of each other, and someone is going to hurt someone here. These are two type ‚ÄúA‚Äù personalities.\\" After being told more children weren't possible, Phyllis and Jack attempted to gain custody of Jack's son, Kyle Jenkins, from Diane Jenkins (Susan Walters), which failed and they eventually divorce in 2004. In 2005, Phyllis and Jack reunited, just before she began an affair with Nicholas Newman (Joshua Morrow). Nick used the affair to numb his emotions after his daughter's tragic death, having been married to Sharon Newman (Sharon Case). A love triangle forms between the three characters, and while Nick initially returns to Sharon, Phyllis becomes pregnant and is unsure if Nick or Jack is the father. A paternity test supposedly revealed Nick as the father, and their daughter, Summer Newman (Hunter King), is born in December 2006, and they are married in May 2007. Their three-year marriage eventually succumbs to Nick's ongoing feelings for Sharon, which resulted in an affair and the birth of their daughter, Faith. Nick divorces Phyllis in 2010. They briefly reunite and remarry in 2012, although it ends due to Phyllis' adultery and lies. Morrow stated that \\"not many husbands would put up with what he has\\" in his marriages to Phyllis. For the years following Summer's birth, speculation arose that Jack was in fact Summer's father, not Nick. In 2013, it was revealed that the paternity test conducted in 2006 was inconclusive.  Storylines  = Backstory = Phyllis was born on June 14, 1974 in Darien, Connecticut to parents George Summers and Lydia Callahan. She then ran away from home as a teenager for undisclosed reasons, leaving behind a younger sister who was revealed to be Avery Bailey Clark in 2011. In 1993, Phyllis gave birth to a son, Daniel, who was fathered by Brian Hamilton who wanted nothing to do with Phyllis or her unborn child. Thus, she conned Danny Romalotti into believing Daniel was his son, and he married her out of obligation. In 1995, her parents came to Genoa City to visit her but Phyllis chased them out of town. = 1994‚Äì = Phyllis arrived in Genoa City in 1994. She was a fan of rockstar Danny Romalotti, whom she drugged to get in bed with her. When she got pregnant, Phyllis altered the DNA results to show Danny as the father. Danny left his wife, Christine Blair, and married Phyllis, who gave birth to Daniel Romalotti Jr. Danny eventually left Phyllis. Intent on revenge, Phyllis ran down Christine and her fianc√©, Paul Williams. They survived. Danny and Phyllis underwent therapy. Phyllis had an affair with her psychiatrist, Tim Reid; and taped them having sex to blackmail him into telling the courts that Danny and Phyllis should not divorce. They divorced anyway and Phyllis was briefly engaged to Tim before reuniting with Danny. Eventually, Brian Hamilton was revealed to be Daniel's biological father; however, Danny fought for custody and won, leaving town with him. Phyllis later had relationships with Malcolm Winters, Michael Baldwin, and Jack Abbott, before leaving town. She returned as a web designer for Jabot Cosmetics, but was later fired and went to work for Newman Enterprises. Phyllis married Jack and they learned she was unable to have any more children. She and Jack tried to get custody of his son, Kyle Jenkins Abbott from Kyle's mother, Diane Jenkins, and Phyllis tried to get Diane out of their lives. Diane set Phyllis up to be jailed for arson and attempted murder, but Phyllis was released. She and Jack divorced. In 2004, Phyllis' son Daniel returned as a teenager and she eventually bonded with him as mother and son. Phyllis later reunited with Jack and began working with Nikki Newman on NVP, a new company funded by Newman Enterprises. She then had an affair with Nick Newman while he was married to Sharon, and grieving the loss of their daughter Cassie. Phyllis became pregnant, and Nick divorced Sharon and then married Phyllis, who gave birth to Summer Newman. Phyllis blackmailed Brad Carlton over his own affair with Sharon, so he would vote for what she wanted on the Newman board. While on a business trip with Sharon and Drucilla Winters, the three women got into a fight, and Drucilla and Sharon fell off a cliff; Dru was never found. Phyllis went to jail for blackmailing Brad and Sharon. Nick was later involved in a plane crash and presumed dead. He showed up months later, with amnesia, believing he was still married to Sharon. He eventually regained his memory. Later, Phyllis, Nick, Jack, and Sharon develop a \\"Restless Style\\" magazine, but Jack and Sharon eventually leave. After witnessing Nick and Sharon kissing in Paris, Phyllis tried to get Brad to keep Sharon away from Nick. This failed, and Nick and Sharon had sex at the Abbott cabin. Sharon wound up pregnant, giving birth to Faith Newman. Phyllis divorces Nick due to his connection with Sharon. Nick and Phyllis eventually reconnected, despite their divorce. Phyllis got custody of Daniel's daughter Lucy, who had been illegally adopted by Billy and Victoria Abbott. In 2012, Phyllis became pregnant and Nick proposed. Phyllis lost the baby, but they still got married. Their marriage was strained when Phyllis finally faced charges for running down Paul and Christine in December 1994. Phyllis' former therapist, Tim Reid, came to town and blackmailed Phyllis. When Tim dropped dead in Phyllis' apartment, she moved the body and then turned to Ronan Malloy for help. Her marriage to Nick ended when Phyllis slept with Ronan, also straining Phyllis' relationship with a teenaged Summer. Phyllis eventually regained a close relationship with her daughter, while also rekindling her romance with Jack. In the summer of 2013, it was revealed that Nick had lied and claimed paternity over Summer, despite the original paternity test taken years before having been corrupted. He takes a second test, which still proves that he is the father. However, Sharon now wants Nick back, and tampers with the test results, allowing everyone to believe Jack is now the father of Summer. Phyllis ultimately hears Sharon confessing to this at Cassie's grave, resulting in an altercation between the two and ending with Phyllis falling down a flight of stairs. At the hospital, Phyllis briefly awakes with Jack at her side, and he proposes, but Phyllis is unresponsive. She then has a panic attack at the sight of Sharon in the window of the door. This causes her to relapse into a coma and is diagnosed with a bruise on her brain. This causes Daniel to request that she be moved to an experimental facility off the coast of where he resides, in Georgia. This is much to the dismay of Jack, Summer, and Avery, as they do not want her to be so far away. After much convincing, the group decides to try everything possible to help Phyllis, and agrees to send her to Georgia. Before leaving for Georgia, Jack is seen placing a ring on an unresponsive, comatose Phyllis to make their engagement official. In the summer of 2014, Summer makes a visit to inform her mother that she has married Austin Travers (Matthew Atkinson). While she lay in her coma, Jack comes to visit Phyllis to tell her that he needed to see her one last time before he officially moves on with the new woman in his life, Kelly Andrews (Cady McClain). He also speaks with her doctor, who informs him that there has been very little change in Phyllis' condition over the past year, and there is very little that they can do. In an attempt to uncover Sharon's paternity test- switch secret, Victor goes to Georgia and gathers information about a risky form of medication that may be able to wake up patients who are in comas. The doctor later tells him that in order for the medication to be used, he would need the approval and signature of an immediate family member. Triggered by Victor's visit, Phyllis begins to display small responses of movement. After Victor secretly gets Summer to forge her signature on the required documents, Phyllis' doctor begins to administer the drug, and she emerges from her coma. Escaping the clinic, she hitchhikes her way back to Genoa City and crashes the wedding of Nick and Sharon. Phyllis' friends and family are thrilled that Phyllis is back. Kelly, however, is not due to the fact that Phyllis' return to Genoa City caused the termination of Kelly and Jack's relationship. In November, when Sharon is getting ready for her second attempt to marry Nick, Phyllis shows up and tricks Sharon into going with her to the stairwell where Phyllis fell. In September 2016, Phyllis and Jack divorced due to Phyllis and Billy's affair. Phyllis desperately tries to regain Jacks love and trust, but fails to do so and gives up in December 2016 after sharing a kiss. They now have a civil work relationship and continue to involve themselves in each other's lives. In August 2017, Phyllis and Benjamin Hochman create a plan to take down Victoria Newman's company, Brash and Sassy so Phyllis can spend more time with Billy. In April 2018, Phyllis helps bury the body of J.T Hellstorm, with the help of Sharon Newman, Victoria Newman, and Nikki Newman after Nikki hits J.T over the head with a firepoker. In July 2018, Phyllis sleeps with Nick Newman, although she is still in a relationship with Billy Abbott. In September, Mariah Copeland learns of Nick and Phyllis‚Äôs betrayal, and tells her mother, Sharon Newman, on the day she is supposed to marry Nick. Sharon confronts Nick, in front of their family and friends, and leaves him at the altar. Once Billy learns of this, he sleeps with Summer in retaliation, leading to the end of Billy and Phyllis‚Äôs relationship. Phyllis becomes Jabots CEO in late October 2018, and enlists the help of newcomer Kerry Johnson to replace the position of the absent Ashley Abbott Hot off the heels of her breakup, Phyllis finds comfort in Nick, and they decide to start a relationship, as well as move in together, much to the dismay of Sharon. However, this relationship is short lived, as Phyllis persuades the D.A, Christine Blair to give her immunity, in return to confessing about the murder of J.T. Hellstrom, and leaving the others to fend for themselves. Nick, being irritated and angry, leaves Phyllis soon after.  Reception  Stafford has been praised for her portrayal. In 1995, Lilana Novakovich of the Toronto Star stated: \\"Michelle Stafford is every bit as irrepressible as Phyllis Romalotti, her character on The Young and the Restless.\\" The Sharon/Nick/Phyllis love triangle, which took place from 2006 to 2010, was considered one of the genre's most titillating storylines. Jamaica Gleaner was enthralled by the twists and turns of the love triangle and published an interview with Stafford; the newspaper asked whether Nick would end his ten-year marriage to Sharon and rather enter into an official romance with her pregnant character Phyllis. Stafford replied, \\"In a perfect world, she'd wish [the baby was] Nick's. But he's married; he's not going to leave Sharon. And she doesn't want him to.\\" The love triangle was a prominent topic of soap opera debate during its run. Daniel R. Coleridge of TV Guide labeled it \\"A can't-miss week for the popular Sharon/Nick/Phyllis triangle\\" when Phyllis's OB-GYN is to inform her that she is expecting. On-Air On-Soaps has noted that both Phyllis' pairings with both Jack and Nick have garnered fan followings; they recognized her pairing with Nick as the \\"Phick vs. Shick\\" fan-base war. Stafford has received a number of honors for her portrayal of Phyllis, including Soap Opera Digest Award wins for Outstanding Female Newcomer in 1996, for Outstanding Villainess in 1997 and for Outstanding Lead Actress in 2003, earning another nomination in the same category in 2005. Stafford also received a nomination for the Soap Opera Digest Award for Outstanding Female Scene Stealer in 2001. She received a Daytime Emmy Award nomination for Outstanding Supporting Actress in a Drama Series in 1996, winning in 1997. Stafford has also received eight nominations for the Daytime Emmy Award for Outstanding Lead Actress in a Drama Series in 2003, 2005, 2007, 2008, 2010, 2011, 2013, winning only once in 2004. At the 32nd Daytime Emmy Awards, Stafford and co-star Peter Bergman were nominated for the Special Fan Award for Irresistible Combination. Tognoni's performance of Phyllis has been met with critical acclaim, earning a Daytime Emmy nomination for Outstanding Lead Actress in a Drama Series in 2015, yet winning the award in 2017.

The ship was launched in 1913 in Seattle, Washington as the submarine for Chile. This deal fell through and the boat, along with , was offered to British Columbia's premier Sir Richard McBride, just nine days before the United Kingdom's declaration of war in 1914. On 4 August 1914, the day war was declared, the boat departed at night (to maintain secrecy from the Chilean, German, and U.S. governments) for handover to British Columbia authorities near Victoria, British Columbia. The Dominion Government of Canada later ratified the sale although there was a Parliamentary investigation of the cost of both boats, over twice the annual budget for the entire Royal Canadian Navy in 1913‚Äì14. CC-2 served in the Royal Canadian Navy from 1914 to 1920, when the submarine was discarded and broken up in 1925. Design The two submarines of the CC class were not identical, with the Electric Boat Company employed two separate designs with the same internal machinery for the submarines. CC-1 was built to the design 19E and CC-2 was built to design 19B. CC-2 was armed with three torpedo tubes of the same size, two forward and one astern.Johnston et al. p. 312Perkins, p. 33 This gave CC-2 a tapered bow. Both submarines used Whitehead Mk IV torpedoes that had a range of at .Ferguson, 2014. p. 30 The only source for these torpedoes in Canada was 's stock and it took some time before they were shipped to the submarines. CC-2 displaced surfaced and submerged and had a length of , a beam of and a draught of .Colledge, p. 115Macpherson and Barrie, p. 15 The boats could dive and unlike modern submarines, the main ballast and trim tanks were located internally. The boats were powered by MAN 6-cylinder diesel engines constructed in the United States under licence.Perkins, p. 36 The CC class could carry of diesel fuel.Ferguson, 2014. p. 28 The two submarines were designed to make surfaced and submerged. CC-2 had a complement of two officers and sixteen ratings. Construction and acquisition Ordered by the Chilean government from the Electric Boat Company, the submarine was constructed on the east coast, broken down into component parts and shipped across the country to Seattle to be reassembled by the Seattle Construction and Drydock Company.Johnston et al. pp. 307‚Äì308Ferguson, 2014. p. 8 Named Antofagasta, the submarine was launched on 31 December 1913. The deal with Chile fell through after the Chilean government grew unhappy with the submarine's capability. After meeting with Canadian officials in Victoria, British Columbia, a planned was hatched to sell the submarines to Canada. Sir Richard McBride, the Premier of British Columbia did not wait for approval of the deal from the national government in Ottawa and authorized the purchase of the submarines. On 3 August 1914, Antofagasta and sister boat Iquique left Seattle in secrecy and sailed for Canada. Meeting British Columbia officials outside Canadian waters, the transfer was made with British Columbia paying $1.15 million for the two submarines. The two subs were taken to British Columbia to await federal approval of the deal. On 7 August, the Government of Canada passed an Order in Council assuming responsibility for and purchasing the two warships from British Columbia, the only province of Canada to have owned warships.Johnston et al. p. 310 In keeping with an earlier Australian practice when two British E-class submarines had been renamed AE 1 and AE 2 by adding the \\"A\\" in front of the class to denote Australia, the two submarines purchased by Canada, resembling British C-class submarines, had two \\"C\\"s placed in front of their names to denote Canada and their apparent class. The acquisition of the submarines faced serious scrutiny, undergoing a Royal Commission and investigation.Johnston et al. p. 311 The submarines faced criticism from Royal Navy experts and even the Electric Boat Company.Ferguson 2014, pp. 35‚Äì36 However, the Royal Commission later found in favour of the decision to acquire the submarines. Service history Commissioned on 6 August 1914 as CC-2, the submarine was assigned to the west coast in the home port of Esquimalt, British Columbia, and conducted training operations and patrols for three years. Together with the cruiser , CC-1 and CC-2 were the only Canadian or British ships defending the west coast of Canada between 1914 and 1917. Under the Anglo-Japanese alliance Britain left the defence of British Columbia to the Imperial Japanese Navy's North American Task Force. In 1917 the submarine was transferred to the east coast with CC-1 and the submarine tender . On 21 June 1917 the three vessels left Esquimalt. Off Cape Blanco, the fleet ran into a gale and CC-2 rolled heavily in the seas, seawater contaminating the sub's batteries. Half the crew was incapacitated by chlorine gas. The high seas also caused the propellers on both the submarines to be tossed out of the water, in turn causing the engines to over-rev. The stabilisation of this problem later caused the battery cells to start to break down and eventually short-circuit and start electrical fires.Ferguson, 2014. pp. 75‚Äì77 The electrical fires led the crews to only operate one diesel engine at a time, as the other was usually under repair. CC-2 worked until San Francisco and then both submarines were towed to San Diego. Confined to port- hopping down the coast and passing through the Canal Zone, the fleet had to stop at Kingston, Jamaica to make repairs.Ferguson, 2014. pp. 77‚Äì80 The group's transit through the Panama Canal was the first time a warship transited the Panama Canal under the White Ensign. Moving on from Kingston, the three ships spent five days at Charleston, South Carolina making more repairs. The fleet attempted to set out, but returned to Charleston for more repairs. They left again and hit a storm, the fleet limping into Norfolk, Virginia, where the submarines spent two weeks in the US Navy dockyard. The group arrived at Halifax, Nova Scotia on 17 October 1917 for preparation to send the two subs to the Mediterranean and Europe. Following their arrival at Halifax, it was found that the two submarines both need an engine overhaul and that neither would be available until mid-August 1918.Johnston et al. p. 780 Only after the Admiralty was informed of their dire condition did they rescind that order and then ordered them for use as coastal defence on the east coast.Ferguson, 2014. p. 81 CC-2 was then held in Halifax as a Training Assistance Boat, training surface vessels in anti-submarine warfare.Ferguson, 2014. pp. 94‚Äì95 The sub finished the war as a training vessel, not going on patrol again before the Armistice.Ferguson, 2014. p. 95 Following the war, the Royal Navy transferred the H-class submarines H14 and H15 to Canada. The Royal Canadian Navy could not operate both the H class and the CC class, so the decision was made to place the CC class in reserve.Ferguson, 2014. p. 105 The two submarines were put up for sale in 1920 and were packaged with Niobe for disposal.Johnston et al., p. 853 The three vessels were sold for scrap in 1925 and broken up.

It is a follow-up to Super Monaco GP. The game was also endorsed by, and had technical input from, the then-Formula One champion Ayrton Senna. Gameplay includes a World Championship season, along with a three-race \\"Senna GP\\" mode. The game was initially suggested by Sega's distributor in Brazil, Tectoy, but developed by Sega in Japan. The game's development was also assisted by Senna, who personally supplied his own advice about the tracks featured in the game. Reception to Ayrton Senna's Super Monaco GP II was mixed to positive, with reviewers praising the gameplay and the graphics but criticizing too few changes from Super Monaco GP. Gameplay alt=A view from a racing car of a racetrack ahead Based on Formula One, Ayrton Senna's Super Monaco GP II features 19 race tracks, including three tracks in the Senna GP mode. Players take control of a race car from the driver's seat view, with a rear view at the screen top. The display also includes a map, tachometer, and speedometer. Six individual save slots are included to save games. In the game's World Championship mode, players have a choice of Beginner or Master difficulty. In addition to the difficulty of the competition, Beginner races take three laps while Master races take six. Each season takes place over sixteen races, in which the player races against fifteen computer-controlled opponents. Players can also enter their name and nationality when starting the mode. Before a race, players can choose their car's transmission: automatic, 4-speed semi- automatic, or 7-speed manual. While automatics are easier to control, manuals provide greater speed. Players must qualify before each race or else start in 12th place. Additionally, the Senna GP mode features races on three tracks, completion of which will earn the player an Ayrton Senna Super License. A Free Practice mode is also available.  Development  The initial pitch for Ayrton Senna's Super Monaco GP II came from Tectoy, Sega's distributor in Brazil. Tectoy approached Sega of Japan with the concept of developing a game starring Brazilian F1 driver Ayrton Senna, who was the 1988, 1990, and 1991 World Champion. Sega of Japan executive vice president Shoichiro Irimajiri personally knew Senna, having previously been an executive at Honda with its F1 division, the engine provider for Senna's team at McLaren, under his oversight. As development of the game began, Senna himself was personally involved in providing direction for the game and ensured he saw to changes he suggested for the game. Among Senna's suggestions were a lack of speed reduction when driving over stripes in the corners, which the first game had done. A visit Senna made to Sega of Japan's headquarters shortly before the 1991 Japanese Grand Prix resulted in a three and a half hour visit, with developers flocking to meet with him. Senna also recorded voice segments commenting on each of the F1 tracks in the game; he refused to record a segment for the Circuit de Barcelona-Catalunya until he had raced on it at the 1991 Spanish Grand Prix, his first time on the track. The game was announced in Japan by October 1991. Ayrton Senna's Super Monaco GP II was released on July 17, 1992 in Japan, August 1992 in PAL regions, and September 1992 in North America. For an article in their magazine, Mega Drive Advanced Gaming had F1 racing driver Johnny Herbert play the game. In 1994, an article in Computer and Video Games called the game \\"easily the biggest selling driving game for the Mega Drive.\\" Reception GamePro praised the speed of the Genesis version and highlighted its improvements in graphics and sound over Super Monaco GP. Player One gave the Mega Drive version a positive review, but posed that owners of the first game would have difficulty understanding why to purchase the sequel. Two reviewers for Mean Machines praised the game as being one of the best racing games on the console but as too similar to Super Monaco GP; the same sentiment was echoed by Tim Boone of Computer and Video Games. Vince Matthews of Game Players was critical of the lack of improvements compared to the original game, focused mainly on control pad issues. In reviewing the game for Hobby Consolas, Giancarlo Vialli gave high praise for the game's improvements over the original, but found the lack of setup adjustments that were present in the first game as a negative. Mega placed the game at #5 in their \\"Top Mega Drive Games of All Time\\". In reviewing the Master System version, German magazine VideoGames gave praise to the game's controls while also critical of the lack of perception of speed. Reviews for Player One and Sega Power shared the same criticism of the Master System version. For the Game Gear version, German magazine Power Play praised the improvement of the graphics over the first game.

They are used in the field of mathematical finance to evaluate derivative securities, such as options. The name derives from the models' treatment of the underlying security's volatility as a random process, governed by state variables such as the price level of the underlying security, the tendency of volatility to revert to some long-run mean value, and the variance of the volatility process itself, among others. Stochastic volatility models are one approach to resolve a shortcoming of the Black‚ÄìScholes model. In particular, models based on Black-Scholes assume that the underlying volatility is constant over the life of the derivative, and unaffected by the changes in the price level of the underlying security. However, these models cannot explain long-observed features of the implied volatility surface such as volatility smile and skew, which indicate that implied volatility does tend to vary with respect to strike price and expiry. By assuming that the volatility of the underlying price is a stochastic process rather than a constant, it becomes possible to model derivatives more accurately. Basic model Starting from a constant volatility approach, assume that the derivative's underlying asset price follows a standard model for geometric Brownian motion: : dS_t = \\\\mu S_t\\\\,dt + \\\\sigma S_t\\\\,dW_t \\\\, where \\\\mu \\\\, is the constant drift (i.e. expected return) of the security price S_t \\\\,, \\\\sigma \\\\, is the constant volatility, and dW_t \\\\, is a standard Wiener process with zero mean and unit rate of variance. The explicit solution of this stochastic differential equation is :S_t= S_0 e^{(\\\\mu- \\\\frac{1}{2} \\\\sigma^2) t+ \\\\sigma W_t}. The maximum likelihood estimator to estimate the constant volatility \\\\sigma \\\\, for given stock prices S_t \\\\, at different times t_i \\\\, is : \\\\begin{align} \\\\widehat{\\\\sigma}^2 &= \\\\left(\\\\frac 1 n \\\\sum_{i=1}^n \\\\frac{(\\\\ln S_{t_i}- \\\\ln S_{t_{i-1}})^2}{t_i- t_{i-1}} \\\\right) - \\\\frac 1 n \\\\frac{(\\\\ln S_{t_n}- \\\\ln S_{t_0})^2}{t_n-t_0}\\\\\\\\\\\\ & = \\\\frac 1 n \\\\sum_{i=1}^n (t_i-t_{i-1})\\\\left(\\\\frac{\\\\ln \\\\frac{S_{t_i}}{S_{t_{i-1}}}}{t_i-t_{i-1}} - \\\\frac{\\\\ln \\\\frac{S_{t_n}}{S_{t_0}}}{t_n-t_0}\\\\right)^2; \\\\end{align} its expected value is \\\\operatorname E \\\\left[ \\\\widehat{\\\\sigma}^2\\\\right]= \\\\frac{n-1}{n} \\\\sigma^2. This basic model with constant volatility \\\\sigma \\\\, is the starting point for non- stochastic volatility models such as Black‚ÄìScholes model and Cox‚ÄìRoss‚ÄìRubinstein model. For a stochastic volatility model, replace the constant volatility \\\\sigma \\\\, with a function u_t \\\\,, that models the variance of S_t \\\\,. This variance function is also modeled as Brownian motion, and the form of u_t \\\\, depends on the particular SV model under study. : dS_t = \\\\mu S_t\\\\,dt + \\\\sqrt{ u_t} S_t\\\\,dW_t \\\\, : d u_t = \\\\alpha_{ u,t}\\\\,dt + \\\\beta_{ u,t}\\\\,dB_t \\\\, where \\\\alpha_{ u,t} \\\\, and \\\\beta_{ u,t} \\\\, are some functions of u \\\\,, and dB_t \\\\, is another standard gaussian that is correlated with dW_t \\\\, with constant correlation factor \\\\rho \\\\,. =Heston model= The popular Heston model is a commonly used SV model, in which the randomness of the variance process varies as the square root of variance. In this case, the differential equation for variance takes the form: : d u_t = \\\\theta(\\\\omega - u_t)\\\\,dt + \\\\xi \\\\sqrt{ u_t}\\\\,dB_t \\\\, where \\\\omega is the mean long-term variance, \\\\theta is the rate at which the variance reverts toward its long-term mean, \\\\xi is the volatility of the variance process, and dB_t is, like dW_t, a gaussian with zero mean and dt variance. However, dW_t and dB_t are correlated with the constant correlation value \\\\rho. In other words, the Heston SV model assumes that the variance is a random process that #exhibits a tendency to revert towards a long-term mean \\\\omega at a rate \\\\theta, #exhibits a volatility proportional to the square root of its level #and whose source of randomness is correlated (with correlation \\\\rho) with the randomness of the underlying's price processes. Some parametrisation of the volatility surface, such as 'SVI', are based on the Heston model. =CEV model = The CEV model describes the relationship between volatility and price, introducing stochastic volatility: :dS_t=\\\\mu S_t \\\\, dt + \\\\sigma S_t^{\\\\, \\\\gamma} \\\\, dW_t Conceptually, in some markets volatility rises when prices rise (e.g. commodities), so \\\\gamma > 1. In other markets, volatility tends to rise as prices fall, modelled with \\\\gamma < 1. Some argue that because the CEV model does not incorporate its own stochastic process for volatility, it is not truly a stochastic volatility model. Instead, they call it a local volatility model. =SABR volatility model= The SABR model (Stochastic Alpha, Beta, Rho), introduced by Hagan et al.PS Hagan, D Kumar, A Lesniewski, DE Woodward (2002) Managing smile risk, Wilmott, 84-108. describes a single forward F (related to any asset e.g. an index, interest rate, bond, currency or equity) under stochastic volatility \\\\sigma: :dF_t=\\\\sigma_t F^\\\\beta_t\\\\, dW_t, :d\\\\sigma_t=\\\\alpha\\\\sigma_t\\\\, dZ_t, The initial values F_0 and \\\\sigma_0 are the current forward price and volatility, whereas W_t and Z_t are two correlated Wiener processes (i.e. Brownian motions) with correlation coefficient -1<\\\\rho<1. The constant parameters \\\\beta,\\\\;\\\\alpha are such that 0\\\\leq\\\\beta\\\\leq 1,\\\\;\\\\alpha\\\\geq 0. The main feature of the SABR model is to be able to reproduce the smile effect of the volatility smile. =GARCH model= The Generalized Autoregressive Conditional Heteroskedasticity (GARCH) model is another popular model for estimating stochastic volatility. It assumes that the randomness of the variance process varies with the variance, as opposed to the square root of the variance as in the Heston model. The standard GARCH(1,1) model has the following form for the variance differential: : d u_t = \\\\theta(\\\\omega - u_t)\\\\,dt + \\\\xi u_t\\\\,dB_t \\\\, The GARCH model has been extended via numerous variants, including the NGARCH, TGARCH, IGARCH, LGARCH, EGARCH, GJR-GARCH, etc. Strictly, however, the conditional volatilities from GARCH models are not stochastic since at time t the volatility is completely pre-determined (deterministic) given previous values. =3/2 model= The 3/2 model is similar to the Heston model, but assumes that the randomness of the variance process varies with u_t^{3/2}. The form of the variance differential is: : d u_t = u_t(\\\\omega - \\\\theta u_t)\\\\,dt + \\\\xi u_t^{3/2} \\\\,dB_t. \\\\, However the meaning of the parameters is different from Heston model. In this model both, mean reverting and volatility of variance parameters, are stochastic quantities given by \\\\theta u_t and \\\\xi u_t respectively. Calibration and estimation Once a particular SV model is chosen, it must be calibrated against existing market data. Calibration is the process of identifying the set of model parameters that are most likely given the observed data. One popular technique is to use maximum likelihood estimation (MLE). For instance, in the Heston model, the set of model parameters \\\\Psi_0 = \\\\\\\\{\\\\omega, \\\\theta, \\\\xi, \\\\rho\\\\\\\\} \\\\, can be estimated applying an MLE algorithm such as the Powell Directed Set method to observations of historic underlying security prices. In this case, you start with an estimate for \\\\Psi_0 \\\\,, compute the residual errors when applying the historic price data to the resulting model, and then adjust \\\\Psi \\\\, to try to minimize these errors. Once the calibration has been performed, it is standard practice to re-calibrate the model periodically. An alternative to calibration is statistical estimation, thereby accounting for parameter uncertainty. Many frequentist and Bayesian methods have been proposed and implemented, typically for a subset of the abovementioned models. The following list contains extension packages for the open source statistical software R that have been specifically designed for heteroskedasticity estimation. The first three cater for GARCH-type models with deterministic volatilities; the fourth deals with stochastic volatility estimation. * rugarch: ARFIMA, in-mean, external regressors and various GARCH flavors, with methods for fit, forecast, simulation, inference and plotting. * fGarch: Part of the Rmetrics environment for teaching \\"Financial Engineering and Computational Finance\\". * bayesGARCH: Bayesian estimation of the GARCH(1,1) model with Student's t innovations. * stochvol: Efficient algorithms for fully Bayesian estimation of stochastic volatility (SV) models via Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods.

Service history =Royal Navy= In November 1914 the Royal Navy contracted Bethlehem Steel to construct a batch of H-class submarines at their Fore River Shipyard in Quincy, Massachusetts. These ships were to be armed only in Montreal. This second batch was seized by the American government due to their neutrality at the time and were only released after the United States had entered the war in 1917. H15 was one such boat and while under construction, the submarine was accidentally sunk at her berth in of water while fitting out in December 1917. This delayed her completion for six months, H15 finally being declared completed on 14 August 1918.Perkins (1989), pp. 187‚Äì88Colledge, p. 280 On 9 November 1918 H15 left New York City and sailed for Bermuda. However, while en route, the First World War ended and upon arriving at Bermuda, H15 remained there in reserve.Ferguson, pp. 98, 104Perkins (1989), p. 194 In mid-December 1918 her crew left in ships for return to the United Kingdom.Ferguson, p. 99 =Royal Canadian Navy= On 7 February 1919, the Royal Navy formally transferred H15 and her sister H14 to the Royal Canadian Navy. The two boats, both in Bermuda still, had lain unused since December. However, even though United Kingdom had gifted the two submarines, Canada was expected to find crews to move the boats from Bermuda. The Royal Canadian Navy did not want them and tried to get the Admiralty to take them back.Ferguson, p. 104 The Royal Canadian Navy, forced to take the submarines, was in turn obligated to discontinue the use of the s as they could not equip all four boats. H15 arrived at Halifax in June 1919. Like the previous CC class, a \\"C\\" was placed in front of the name of the ship to denote it belonged to Canada.Ferguson, p. 105 Commissioned into the Royal Canadian Navy on 1 April 1921 at Halifax it took two months to make CH-15 and her sister operational.Ferguson, p. 106 By July 1921 both boats were functioning and exercised with the rest of the Canadian armed forces practicing harbour defence. While in service the submarine was used primarily for training anti- submarine warfare.Johnston et al. p. 881 After arguing that remaining at Halifax during the winter months would be detrimental to the vessels' status,Johnston et al. p. 874 CH-15 and her sister, accompanied by , wintered at Bermuda. The two submarines returned to Halifax in April 1922. Following the election of Mackenzie King government, the Naval Service was required to cut expenditures.Johnston et al. p. 885 Upon their return it was found that the government had refused to pay for the upkeep of the submarines and they were paid off on 22 June 1922.Ferguson, p. 107 Following their decommissioning, a report was commissioned that examined the cost of maintaining and re-activating the submarines. It was found too costly and the plan was abandoned. In February 1925 the Admiralty enquired into the condition of the two warships and the response was negative, questioning the two boats ability to return to service. In 1926 the two submarines were put for sale along with , the proceeds of the sale going to the Royal Navy.

Plot summary Harold Parkette is in need of a new lawn mowing service. The summer before, a neighbor's cat was accidentally killed when another neighbor's dog chased it under the mower. Harold has been putting off hiring new help for the summer, but when he sees an ad for a mowing service, he calls. A van reading \\"Pastoral Greenery\\" soon pulls up to his home. The man working for the service, a hairy, pot-bellied fellow, is shown the overgrown back lawn and is hired. Harold is enjoying a rest as he reads the paper, wondering about the lawnmower man mentioning Circe, when he hears the lawnmower outside. Startled, he races to the back porch and sees the lawnmower running by itself and the naked lawnmower man following it on all fours and eating the grass. The lawnmower seemingly deliberately chases and kills a mole and Harold faints. When Harold revives, the lawnmower man explains that this new method, introduced by his boss, grants substantial benefits, and that he makes sacrificial victims of customers who cannot appreciate the process. Harold, though unnerved, allows the lawnmower man to return to work. As soon as the man is out of sight, Harold desperately calls the police, but is interrupted by the lawnmower man, who reveals his boss's name: Pan. The lawnmower briefly chases Harold through his living room before brutally slaughtering him. When the police arrive, they conclude that Harold was murdered and dismembered by a schizophrenic sex maniac. As they leave, the scent of freshly cut grass hangs strongly in the air.  Adaptations  *The story was adapted in graphic form in Bizarre Adventures #29 (December 1981). The adaptation features the original text of the short story, accompanied by art by Walt Simonson. Publisher IDW rereleased the story in a portfolio edition shot from the original art in 2014. *A twelve-minute Dollar Baby short film, The Lawnmower Man: A Suburban Nightmare, was released in 1987. It was written by future screenwriter and New Line Cinema production executive Michael De Luca (In the Mouth of Madness) and directed by James Gonis. The film was shot in 1985 while Gonis was a junior at New York University. Originally budgeted at $800, the final film ultimately cost nearly $5,000. It has screened at several film festivals: New York University; at Horrorfest 1989, a screening of King films at the Stanley Hotel (the hotel that inspired King's novel The Shining); a New York film festival of Greek-American filmmakers in 1991; and at the 1st Annual Dollar Baby festival in Orono, Maine in 2004. *A feature film, The Lawnmower Man, starring Jeff Fahey and Pierce Brosnan, was released in 1992 by New Line Cinema. This film used an original screenplay entitled \\"CyberGod\\", borrowing only the title of the short story. The film concerns a scientist, Dr. Lawrence Angelo (Brosnan), who subjects mentally challenged Jobe Smith (Fahey) to virtual reality experiments. Jobe's mental abilities improve to superhuman levels as the process continues, but he lacks the emotional maturity and character to use his powers humanely. When Angelo's employers interfere with the process, Jobe becomes a homicidal megalomaniac. King won a lawsuit to have his name removed from the credits, and then won further damages when his name was included in the home video release.

She was originally associated with the Chicago no wave scene, which included bands such as the Scissor Girls, U.S. Maple and Bride of No No. She has been a voice and piano teacher at Chicago's Old Town School of Folk Music since 2002, and has served as composer and musical director for theater productions of musicals by Brian Torrey Scott. Background Born in the United States to Iranian parents, Azita spent part of her childhood in Iran and was attending grade school in Tehran when the Iranian revolution began in late 1978. Her family moved back to the United States soon after, settling in Bethesda, Maryland. Growing up, she attended an all-girls school, Holton-Arms, and studied classical piano. As a teen, she would attend punk rock shows in Washington, D.C. In 1989, Azita moved to Chicago to study at the Art Institute of Chicago. Musical career =Scissor Girls= Disillusioned with the visual arts as a medium for expression, she turned to performance art and sound. In 1991, she formed the spastic noise-rock group The Scissor Girls with Sue Anne Zollinger on guitar (later replaced by Kelly Kuvo), Heather Melowic on drums, and herself on vocals and bass. Their live performances were highly theatrical and the members often dressed in homemade costumes ranging from Catholic schoolgirl uniforms to clothes made of Bubble Wrap and duct tape. After two albums and a singles compilation, the Scissor Girls broke up in late 1996. =Miss High Heel= In late 1995, Azita played synthesizer for a short- lived Weasel Walter/Jim O'Rourke project Miss High-Heel. Their self-titled CD was released on B-Sides Records (now NoSides Records) in 1998. =Bride of No- No= Azita formed the Bride of No-No, another project known for extreme theatrics, in 1999. Band members, which included drummers Jen Kienzler, Shannon Morrow and guitarists J. Graf and M.V. Carbon (also of Metalux), disguised themselves onstage in what has been described as mummy-like burkhas. After two albums the band eventually dissolved in 2002. =Solo= Azita recorded her first solo work, Music for Scattered Brains, to be used as a part of her college thesis project. Music for Scattered Brains was originally released on vinyl in 1995. In 1997, Azita returned to playing her childhood instrument, the piano while rooming with engineer Elliot Dicks who brought a piano into their loft. On piano, she started writing and recording material which would eventually be released under her own name. Enantiodromia was released in 2003 on Drag City, and Life on the Fly followed in 2004. Descriptions of this release varied, from comparisons with Steely Dan to comparisons with \\"a bad Rod Stewart album from the early 1980s\\". Azita's album, How Will You?, was released on February 17, 2009. Her latest album, Year was issued in November 2012.

Since there were no medical schools in the city at the time, Morrin worked as a surgeon's apprentice. He returned to Scotland for a medical education at the University of Edinburgh. He came back to Quebec City upon graduating, where he began working as a doctor at the H√¥tel-Dieu de Qu√©bec in 1826. In 1845, Morrin helped found the Beauport Asylum with two colleagues and subsequently continued his work as a doctor there. He also played a role in the founding of a major medical school in the city. Morrin served twice as mayor in the 1850s, and was the first democratically elected mayor of the city. At the age of 66 he retired due to poor health. Upon retiring, Morrin bestowed money and property to three of his friends to found the institution that later became Morrin College. He also left behind an amount of money to Universit√© Laval, the proceeds of which continue to be distributed to this day as financial aid for medical students.

He worked as a voting rights worker in Mississippi, a Peace Corps Volunteer in the Ivory Coast, and as Church World Service/CARE Field Director in Cambodia in 1980. Stanton was the Research Professor in Genocide Studies and Prevention at the School for Conflict Analysis and Resolution, George Mason University, Arlington, Virginia, until his retirement in 2019.Biography at George Mason University website. From 2003 to 2009 he was the James Farmer Professor in Human Rights at the University of Mary Washington in Fredericksburg, Virginia. He has been a Law Professor at Washington and Lee University, American University, and the University of Swaziland. He has degrees from Oberlin College, Harvard Divinity School, Yale Law School, and a Doctorate in Cultural Anthropology from the University of Chicago. He was a fellow at the Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars (2001‚Äì2002). Career Stanton was a law professor at Washington and Lee University from 1985 to 1991, was a Fulbright Professor at the University of Swaziland, and was a professor of Justice, Law, and Society at the American University. From 2003 - 2009, he was the James Farmer Professor in Human Rights at the University of Mary Washington in Fredericksburg, Virginia. Stanton founded the Cambodian Genocide Project at Yale in 1981 and since then has been a driving force to bring the Khmer Rouge to justice. Stanton was the Chair of the American Bar Association Young Lawyer's Division Committee on Human Rights and a member of the A.B.A.'s Standing Committee on World Order Under Law. Stanton was a legal advisor to Rukh, the Ukrainian independence movement (1988 - 1992), work for which he was named the Ukrainian Congress Committee of America's 1992 Man of the Year. Stanton served in the State Department (1992‚Äì1999). At the State Department he drafted the United Nations Security Council resolutions that created the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda the Burundi Commission of Inquiry, and the Central African Arms Flow Commission. He also drafted the U.N. Peacekeeping Operations resolutions that helped bring about an end to the Mozambique civil war. In 1994, Stanton won the American Foreign Service Association's W. Averell Harriman Award for \\"extraordinary contributions to the practice of diplomacy exemplifying intellectual courage,\\" based on his dissent from U.S. policy on the Rwandan genocide. After his tenure at the State Department, Stanton criticized United States president Bill Clinton's statements following the genocide, saying that he was lying when he asserted that the government didn't know the genocide was coming, citing confidential diplomatic cables sent three months before the genocide by the United States ambassador to Rwanda. Stanton wrote the State Department options paper on ways to bring the Khmer Rouge to justice in Cambodia. Stanton was deeply involved in the U.N.-Cambodian government negotiations that brought about the creation of the Khmer Rouge Tribunal, for which he drafted internal rules of procedure. Stanton is best known for his authorship of The Ten Stages of Genocide, a model of the genocidal process that the US State Department and UN have used in predicting and taking steps to prevent genocide. His Ten Stage model is used in courses on genocide in schools and colleges around the world. In 1999 Stanton founded Genocide Watch. From 1999 to 2000, he also served as Co-Chair of the Washington Working Group for the International Criminal Court. In 2004, Dr. Stanton published a proposal to establish an Office for Genocide Prevention at the UN.http://genocidewatch.org/createungenocidectr.html With other members of the International Campaign to End Genocide, he met with UN officials to lobby for the proposal. In 2004 in Stockholm, Secretary General Kofi Annan announced the creation of the Office of the UN Special Advisor for the Prevention of Genocide. In 2007, Stanton was elected President of the International Association of Genocide Scholars, to serve until 2009. He served as First Vice President of the Association from 2005 to 2007. In 2013, the organization gave Stanton its Distinguished Service Award and made him a Life Member. In 2012, Stanton called for the United States to release \\"all diplomatic and intelligence cables relating to the [Gukurahundi] massacres\\" of Zimbabwe and to release information regarding its decision \\"to remain silent\\", in order to \\"clear its conscience\\". Genocide Watch In 1999 Stanton founded Genocide Watch, a non-governmental organization campaigning against genocide based in Washington, D.C.. Genocide Watch is the Chair and Coordinator of the Alliance Against Genocide, which includes 70 organizations in 24 countries, including the Minority Rights Group, the International Crisis Group, the Aegis Trust, and Survival International. Its board of advisers includes former commander of United Nations peacekeeping forces in Rwanda Rom√©o Dallaire, former Nuremberg Prosecutor Benjamin Ferencz, and former US Ambassador to the United Nations Samantha Power. In 2010, Genocide Watch was the first organization to assert that the 1980s Gukurahundi massacres in Zimbabwe met the definition of genocide, calling for the prosecution of Zimbabwean leaders including president Robert Mugabe. In 2019, the organization issued alerts regarding the risk of genocide of the Muslim population in the Indian states of Jammu and Kashmir and Assam. In 2020, the organization joined in signing an open letter by various rights groups urging the U.N. Human Rights Council (UNHRC) to investigate the actions of the Chinese government regarding Turkic Muslim minorities in the Xinjiang region, and \\"develop strategies\\" to end the alleged violations which they consider to be acts of genocide. In the case of Bosco Ntaganda within the International Criminal Court investigation in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Genocide Watch submitted amicus curiae observations along with the Antiquities Coalition and Blue Shield International, on the interpretation of attacks on cultural property in the Rome Statute.

Although primarily a commercial product, an open- source General Public Licence version was released in 2004 for Linux to allow developers to experiment with ideas for possible inclusion in the commercial product. In late 2008, a community-driven site formed to direct a fork of the GPL release that is not associated with Ladybridge Systems, ScarletDME. The original open source implementation was deprecated. In 2015, Ladybridge Systems announced that cloud solutions provider, Zumasys, in Irvine, California, had been appointed as the worldwide distributor for the OpenQM MultiValue database product with design and development of the software remaining with the UK-based, Ladybridge Systems. Zumasys acquired full ownership rights to OpenQM in January 2019 and Martin Phillips became a Zumasys employee at the same time, continuing as product architect and primary developer. =Unique Multi-Value features= OpenQM is a multivalue database, and, as such, shares many aspects in common with similar Pick-descended databases. It also has a number of features not found in most other commercial MV databases, such as auto-sizing of database files, 'binary clean' execution of QMBasic, and, perhaps uniquely in the MV world, object, class and exception handling support in Basic. Support for arbitrarily multi-dimensional data collections was added in 2014 to extend the data model beyond the three dimensions supported by most multi-value systems.

From quantum field theory to string theory * Emission and absorption: one of the most basic building blocks of quantum field theory, is the notion that particles (such as electrons) can emit and absorb other particles (such as photons). Thus, an electron may just \\"split\\" into an electron plus a photon, with a certain probability (which is roughly the coupling constant). This is described in string theory as one string splitting into two. This process is an integral part of the theory. The mode on the original string also \\"splits\\" between its two parts, resulting in two strings which possibly have different modes, representing two different particles. * Coupling constant: in quantum field theory this is, roughly, the probability for one particle to emit or absorb another particle, the latter typically being a gauge boson (a particle carrying a force). In string theory, the coupling constant is no longer a constant, but is rather determined by the abundance of strings in a particular mode, the dilaton. Strings in this mode couple to the worldsheet curvature of other strings, so their abundance through space-time determines the measure by which an average string worldsheet will be curved. This determines its probability to split or connect to other strings: the more a worldsheet is curved, it has a higher chance of splitting and reconnecting. * Spin: each particle in quantum field theory has a particular spin s, which is an internal angular momentum. Classically, the particle rotates in a fixed frequency, but this cannot be understood if particles are point-like. In string theory, spin is understood by the rotation of the string; For example, a photon with well-defined spin components (i.e. in circular polarization) looks like a tiny straight line revolving around its center. * Gauge symmetry: in quantum field theory, the mathematical description of physical fields include non-physical states. In order to omit these states from the description of every physical process, a mechanism called gauge symmetry is used. This is true for string theory as well, but in string theory it is often more intuitive to understand why the non-physical states should be disposed of. The simplest example is the photon: a photon is a vector particle (it has an inner \\"arrow\\" which points to some direction, its polarization). Mathematically, it can point towards any direction in space- time. Suppose the photon is moving in the z direction; then it may either point towards the x, y or z spatial directions, or towards the t (time) direction (or any diagonal direction). Physically, however, the photon may not point towards the z or t directions (longitudinal polarization), but only in the x-y plane (transverse polarization). A gauge symmetry is used to dispose of the non-physical states. In string theory, a photon is described by a tiny oscillating line, with the axis of the line being the direction of the polarization (i.e. the inner direction of the photon is the axis of the string which the photon is made of). If we look at the worldsheet, the photon will look like a long strip which stretches along the time direction with an angle towards the z-direction (because it is moving along the z-direction as time goes by); its short dimension is therefore in the x-y plane. The short dimension of this strip is precisely the direction of the photon (its polarization) in a certain moment in time. Thus the photon cannot point towards the z or t directions, and its polarization must be transverse. ::Note: formally, gauge symmetries in string theory are (at least in most cases) a result of the existence of a global symmetry together with the profound gauge symmetry of string theory, which is the symmetry of the worldsheet under a local change of coordinates and scales. * Renormalization: in particle physics the behaviour of particles in the smallest scales is largely unknown. In order to avoid this difficulty, the particles are treated as fields behaving according to an \\"effective field theory\\" at low energy scales, and a mathematical tool known as renormalization is used to describe the unknown aspects of this effective theory using only a few parameters. These parameters can be adjusted so that calculations give adequate results. In string theory, this is unnecessary since the behaviour of the strings is presumed to be known to every scale. * Fermions: in the bosonic string, a string can be described as an elastic one-dimensional object (i.e. a line) \\"living\\" in spacetime. In superstring theory, every point of the string is not only located at some point in spacetime, but it may also have a small arrow \\"drawn\\" on it, pointing at some direction in spacetime. These arrows are described by a field \\"living\\" on the string. This is a fermionic field, because at each point of the string there is only one arrow; thus one cannot bring two arrows to the same point. This fermionic field (which is a field on the worldsheet) is ultimately responsible for the appearance of fermions in spacetime: roughly, two strings with arrows drawn on them cannot coexist at the same point in spacetime, because then one would effectively have one string with two sets of arrows at the same point, which is not allowed, as explained above. Therefore two such strings are fermions in spacetime.This argument uses the zero picture representation, in which states of the Neveu‚ÄìSchwarz sector have an even number of excited fermionic oscillators, and are therefore commuting among themselves (i.e. have the statistics of bosons). States of the Ramond sector are anticommuting among themselves (i.e. have the statistics of fermions), ultimately due to the fermionic fields \\"living\\" on them. The spacetime statistics of states in scattering amplitudes is a consequence of their worldsheet statistics.

A native of Mobile, Alabama, he saw action as a sergeant major in the Seven Days Battles, and later became a second lieutenant in the Confederate States Marine Corps. He was captured at Fort Gaines, Mobile Bay, Alabama, August 5, 1864, and paroled at Nanna Hubba Bluff, Alabama, May 10, 1865. After the war, he became the owner of the Mobile Register, and served as postmaster of Mobile. Family and early life Rapier was born in Spring Hill, a suburb of Mobile, Alabama, the son of Thomas Gwynn Rapier and Evalina Senac. His maternal uncle was Confederate Paymaster Felix senac. He was also related to Angela S. Mallory, wife of Secretary of the Confederate Navy, Stephen R. Mallory. In 1857 he worked as a clerk in New Orleans until the outbreak of the American Civil War.Donnelly, Biographical Sketches, 163-165. Confederate States service Rapier was enlisted from Louisiana as a private in Captain Henri St. Paul's Company (Second Company) of the Louisiana Foot Rifles on April 22, 1861. This was later folded into Company A, 7th Battalion, Louisiana Infantry. Their first assignment was Pensacola, Florida, where they arrived on April 28 and stayed until mid-September. They were then transferred to Richmond, Virginia, where they encamped for several months in the vicinity of Centerville. The battalion was then assigned to Brigadier General Richard H. Anderson's Brigade on the Virginia Peninsula in May 1862. Rapier was promoted to Sergeant-Major of the battalion, in which capacity he fought in the Battle of Williamsburg and in the Seven Days battles. During the Battle of Frayser's Farm, June 30, 1862, part of the Seven Day's campaign, he was blinded temporarily by a shell exploding inches from his face. In August, his battalion was divided and his company became Company E of the Confederate States Zouave Battalion, Louisiana Volunteers. On August 12, this organization became part of Starke's Brigade of Taliaferro's Division. Rapier continued to serve as sergeant major. He then saw action at the Second Battle of Bull Run, Battle of Antietam and Fredericksburg, before his battalion was transferred to southeastern Virginia. In January, he was promoted to first lieutenant and adjutant of his battalion. In March, it is reported that Secretary Mallory offered him a commission in the Confederate Marine Corps, but Rapier did not initially accept it. However, several weeks later he took the examination, passed and was commissioned as a second lieutenant, dated July 11, 1863. On August 1, he was ordered to report to Secretary Mallory, where he was then assigned to the Marine Camp at Drewry's Bluff, James River, Virginia, as part of Company A.Register of Officers of the Confederate States Navy, 160 He served there briefly until he was ordered on December 22, 1863, to report to Admiral Franklin Buchanan, commander of the Mobile Squadron. On arrival on December 28, he was assigned to the Mobile Marine Barracks. On August 3, 1864, Rapier and several fellow marines were ordered to reinforce Fort Gaines on Dauphin Island, Mobile Bay, Alabama, during which time he was made Major W. R. Browne's adjutant. Thus he participated in the Battle of Mobile Bay. When the commanding officer of the fort, Colonel Charles D. Anderson, held a council with his officers on August 6, he revealed a document he wished them to sign, surrendering the fort. Rapier and one other marine, were some of the very few that refused to sign.Sullivan, 66 Rapier was captured on August 8, 1864. He later escaped from prison in New Orleans on October 13, 1864, by making his way through the swamps and bayous until he reached Mobile on November 10. He met up with Captain Fry, a relative, who gave him command of two 32-pounder guns on the gunboat Morgan. He participated in the Battle of Spanish Fort and the Battle of Fort Blakely in April 1865. He was on this boat until he surrendered on May 4, 1865. He was paroled May 10, 1865, at Nanna Hubba Bluff, Alabama. After the war After the war, he married the daughter of a former commander, Regina St. Paul, in 1866, and after her death, he married Regina Demouy. In 1866, Rapier took a position at the Mobile Times with his father-in-law Major St. Paul. The Times was later consolidated into the Mobile Register. He later became part owner, with Colonel John Forsyth, and upon the death of the latter, became the sole owner in 1877. In December 1894, President Grover Cleveland appointed him Postmaster of Mobile, which position he held until March 1897.

Her victim, Mary Clifford, was one of her domestic servants, who died from cumulative injuries and associated infected wounds. As a result of witness testimony and medical evidence at her trial, Brownrigg was hanged at Tyburn on 14 September 1767. Early life: 1720‚Äì1765 Born in 1720 to a working class family, Elizabeth married James Brownrigg, an apprentice plumber, while still a teenager. She gave birth to sixteen children, but only three survived infancy. In 1765, Elizabeth, James and their son John moved to Flower de Luce Road in London's Fetter Lane. James was prospering from his career as a plumber, and Elizabeth was a respected midwife. As a result of her work, Saint Dunstans Parish appointed her overseer of women and children, and she was given custody of several female children as domestic servants from the London Foundling Hospital. Foundling Hospital: vocational and educational debate Since Thomas Coram had founded it in 1739, there had been a constant debate about what the station of the Foundling Hospital's young charges should be: whether they were being overeducated, or whether they should be subject to vocational education and trained for apprenticeships, which would lead to future stable lives as domestic servants. The latter was decided upon, and the Foundling Hospital began to tender older children and young adolescents for vocational training as apprentices in 1759, shortly before the events described in this entry took place. Elizabeth Brownrigg was not the only abusive adult who used hapless children as slave labor, however, as contemporary accounts indicate. After the events described in this entry, the Foundling Hospital instituted greater safeguards of oversight for apprenticeship tendering, and reported cases of apprentice abuse dropped considerably. Abuse of servants: 1765‚Äì1767 Illustration of Elizabeth Brownrigg flogging Mary Clifford from the Newgate Calendar Little biographical information is available to explain her subsequent behavior. However, Elizabeth Brownrigg proved ill-suited to the task of caring for her foundling domestic servants and soon began to engage in severe physical abuse. This often involved stripping her young charges naked, chaining them to wooden beams or pipes, and then whipping them severely with switches, bullwhip handles and other implements for the slightest infraction of her rules. Mary Jones, one of her earlier charges, ran away from her house and sought sanctuary with the London Foundling Hospital. After a medical examination, the Governors of the London Foundling Hospital demanded that James Brownrigg keep his wife's abusive tendencies in check, but enforced no further action. Heedless of this reprimand, Brownrigg also severely abused two other domestic servants, Mary Mitchell and Mary Clifford. Like Jones before her, Mitchell sought refuge from the abusive behavior of her employer, but John Brownrigg forced her to return to Flower de Luce Road. Clifford was entrusted to Brownrigg's care, despite the Governors' earlier concerns about her abusive behaviour towards her charges. As a result, Brownrigg engaged in more excessive punishment towards Clifford. She was kept naked, forced to sleep on a mat inside a coal hole, and when she forced open cupboards for food because she was fed only bread and water, Elizabeth Brownrigg repeatedly beat her for a day's duration, chained to a roof beam in her kitchen. By June 1767 Mitchell and Clifford were experiencing infection of their untreated wounds, and Brownrigg's repeated assaults gave them no time to heal. Beginning to suspect something was awry, Brownrigg's neighbours asked the London Foundling Hospital to further investigate the premises. As a result, Brownrigg yielded Mary Mitchell, but Foundling Hospital Inspector Grundy then demanded to know where Clifford was, and took James Brownrigg prisoner, although Elizabeth and John Brownrigg escaped. Public feeling ran high against the Brownriggs, ensuring their capture would be swift. In Wandsworth, a chandler recognised the fugitives, and the trio stood trial in the Old Bailey in August 1767. Portrait of Elizabeth Brownrigg Trial and execution: August‚ÄìSeptember 1767 By this time, Mary Clifford had succumbed to her infected wounds, and Elizabeth Brownrigg was charged with her murder. At the trial, Mary Mitchell testified against her former employer, as did Grundy and an apprentice of James Brownrigg. Medical evidence and autopsy results indicated that Brownrigg's repeated assaults and negligence of Clifford's injuries had contributed to the fourteen-year-old's death, so Elizabeth Brownrigg was sentenced to hang at Tyburn and her corpse be publicly dissected. While awaiting execution she expressed remorse and prayed for salvation. Crowds condemned her on the way to her execution. :‚ÄúOn her way to the place of execution the people expressed their abhorrence of her crime in terms which, though not proper for the occasion, testified their astonishment that such a wretch could have existed: they even prayed for her damnation instead of her salvation: they doubted not but that ‚Äòthe devil would fetch her,‚Äô and hoped that ‚Äòshe would go to hell.‚Äô Such were the sentiments of the mob.‚Äù Even sixty years later, The Newgate Calendar crime periodical still bore testimony to the impression that Elizabeth Brownrigg's crimes had made on Georgian and Victorian England.

The gorge is an indirect product of glaciation; 10,000 years ago, just as the Ice Age was coming to an end, torrential runoff water from melting glaciers eroded a deep, narrow chasm through the limestone barrier. Although barely long, this passage is bordered by sheer cliffs up to high on either side. The gorge varies in width from some at its widest to just at its narrowest. The gorge is a popular tourist attraction, many visitors attracted by the nearby Reichenbach Falls, which Sir Arthur Conan Doyle selected as the setting for Sherlock Holmes' murder by Professor Moriarty. Permission to build walking paths along the Gorge was granted in 1887, and the walkway has been open to the public since 1889. From 1912 until 1956, the Meiringen‚ÄìReichenbach‚ÄìAareschlucht tramway linked the gorge's western entrance to Meiringen; since 1946 the Meiringen-Innertkirchen railway has also served the same purpose. The restaurant and kiosk at the western entrance was first built in 1928 and reconstructed in 1987. In 2003 a station was built on the railway to serve the eastern entrance, along with a suspension bridge to link the station and entrance; a bistro and kiosk was added to this entrance in 2008. The path through the gorge is accessed by entrances at each end of the gorge, where an admission charge is levied. For most of its length the path is a wooden construction on a metal frame cantilevered out from the wall of the gorge, with short stretches in tunnel. The entrances are each linked to stations on the Meiringen-Innertkirchen railway, with Aareschlucht West station at the western end of the gorge, and the underground Aareschlucht Ost station connecting to the eastern entrance.

Belvedere was built in Trieste and first operated as a passenger and cargo ship when the city and company were part of Austro- Hungarian Empire. After World War I the city and ship, converted to cargo in the early 1920s, became Italian. In 1941 Belvedere was in Philadelphia when foreign ships of Axis powers were interned and then seized. The ship was taken over for operation by the War Shipping Administration through agents until scuttled at Omaha Beach. Austro-Hungarian/Italian service Belvedere was built by Cantiere Navale Triestino in Trieste, then part of Austro-Hungarian Empire, to operate for l'Unione Austriaco di Nav. Soc. Anon (Unione Austriaca Company) from the port of Trieste.Reference Soci√©t√© d'Arch√©ologie et de M√©moire Maritime contains a photo of the ship. Belvedere was built specifically for migrant and cargo trade between the Adriatic and North or South America.The Museo/Cantieristica is in an historic building inside the village built outside the shipyard for workeers. The reference contains detailed history of the ship. The ship sailed on her maiden voyage 30 August 1913 to New York by way of Patras, Messina, Palermo, and Algiers. That service continued until World War I when the ship served as a barracks ship for arsenal workers in Pola. Belvedere became Italian flagged in 1919 when Trieste became Italian after the war. The ship operated with Unione di Nav. Soc. Anon then in 1920 by Cosulich Soc. Triestina di Nav both of Trieste. Refrigeration for beef cargo and conversion from coal to oil took place in the early 1920s. In 1936 the ship was converted to cargo with capacity for only 12 passengers. In 1937 the ship was modified to be operated by Italia S.A.di Nav, Genoa in Italy to Boston, New York and Philadelphia service. U.S. Internment & seizure =Internment= The ship, arriving in Philadelphia on 7 June 1941, was among the 28 Italian ships interned then seized under the Ship Requisition Act signed June 6, 1941. The United States Coast Guard had first taken possession of the ship and removed the crew under the World War I era Espionage Act of 1917 to secure the vessel and prevent damage to it or the port by enemy aliens. Sixteen of the Belvedere crew were arrested by U.S. officials and charged with sabotage. They and members of the crews of ships brought to Philadelphia from four other vessels seized in the Delaware River were accused of causing $1,000,000 damage on orders of the Italian naval attache in Washington. Those found guilty, and most charged were, got one to three year prison sentences. Appeals by the papal delegation got those serving in prison transferred to join other Italian internees at the prisoner of war camp at Fort Missoula, Montana. =War Shipping Administration Audacious= Belvedere was then seized and taken over by the War Shipping Administration 27 October 1941, renamed and flagged in Panama under the name Audacious, then assigned the same day for operation under a general agency agreement with United States Lines. On 2 November 1942 Audacious was reassigned under the same terms to the U.S. Navigation Company. Assignment of seized vessels to operating companies was under a policy of making such assignments based on cooperation of companies in developing American merchant marine interests on particular trade routes by constructing and operating vessels on such routes. =Scuttling at Omaha Beach= Audacious made a last ocean voyage in February 1944 sailing in convoy with troops and supplies to Liverpool. The voyage was in Convoy HX 280 departing from New York 20 February 1944 arriving in Liverpool 9 March.A search of Warsailors convoys shows Audacious in a number of trans Atlantic convoys. After discharge of cargo large holes were made between cargo holds and explosive charges rigged within the double bottom. The ship then went to Scotland to await the invasion. About 2,000 troops were embarked and the ship sailed under escort to arrive off the beach just after midnight 6 June 1944. The troops were disembarked into landing craft. The ship's civilian crew remained aboard awaiting the tow to the assigned scuttling position where they too disembarked into landing craft from which they could hear the charges explode and see the ship settling. The ship was scuttled as part of the Omaha Beach Mulberry harbour breakwater 8 June 1944. The Navy prepared the blockships for defense with each having the aft deck gun removed, which was usually replaced with four 20mm and one 40mm anti-aircraft guns served by Navy Armed Guard crews. The blockships were under artillery fire by day and bombers at night. The Armed Guard aboard Audacious remained until 18 June 1944, the day before a storm wrecked the harbor. Audacious was used as an example in written testimony by the maritime historian and author Charles Dana Gibson to the U.S. House of Representatives Subcommittee on Merchant Marine during hearings in August 1986 regarding veteran status and recognition of merchant mariners during the war. He noted that those serving on the Normandy blockships had been granted veteran status as members of The Blockship Group ‚Äî Mulberry Operation, Normandy, with the application submitted specifically for \\"the Panamanian freighter Audacious,\\" while those serving in equally dangerous roles at sea had not. With regard to Audacious he noted the crew had been made up of mixed nationalities, had never been a part of any military command, though blockship crews were under virtual \\"house arrest\\" by the Army to ensure secrecy, and that the blockship operation was a joint Army, Navy and WSA effort. He further noted the service aboard the blockships, some unmanned, was no more dangerous than merchant mariners aboard ships then operating for periods within the harbor created by the abandoned blockships. After repeated refusals in Congress, a court ordered veteran status to most World War II merchant mariners January 19, 1988.

History In 1962, Andrew Langston moved his family young wife Gloria Langston and son Andre Langston to Rochester after being offered a job at a local TV station. Upon his arrival, he was quickly turned away once they realized he was Black and did not want him on camera. In order to provide for his family he became an insurance agent, barber, and took a sales job at National Clothing Company. One of his most prominent clients at National Clothing Company was Xerox founder, Joseph Wilson. Wilson and Langston became good friends over time and would talk about a number of topics. One topic being, Langston's dream of starting his own radio station. Due to the poor treatment of Black people, race riots, and lack of proper news coverage Langston wanted to create a vehicle to give the unheard a voice. Wilson believed in Langston's dream and promised him a space atop the Xerox tower, the highest building in Rochester, for his antenna once he solidified ownership of the station. Their agreement was written on a napkin. In 1968, Langston went to Washington, D.C. to meet with the FCC to apply for his license to broadcast on the available frequency 103.9 MHz. After six years, WDKX commenced broadcasting at 5:30 a.m. on April 6, 1974. Wilson kept his promise and the WDKX antenna was placed on top of the Xerox Tower where it still stands today. Langston chose the call letters DKX with intention, standing for influential Black community leaders ‚Äì Fredrick Douglass, Martin Luther King Jr., and Malcolm X. Andrew A. Langston, received the \\"Rochester Radio Broadcaster of the Year\\" Award, the National Association of Black Owned Broadcasters \\"Pioneer\\" Award, and was inducted to the \\"New York State Broadcasters Hall of Fame\\" inaugural class for his contributions to the broadcasting industry. He passed in 2010. The station is a key element within the community of Rochester. They are heavily focused on the betterment and empowerment of the community.

On December 13, 2016, a referendum was held to build a new middle school (called North Brunswick Township Middle School) on vacant land at Route 130 and Renaissance Boulevard North, which was passed by voters (1,807 in favor and 1,648 against).

The new middle school will only house students in 7th and 8th grade, instead of 6th through 8th. As a result, Linwood Middle School, the current middle school for students in grades 6-8, will become a 5-6 school (as the district's elementary schools were also overcrowded) and a wing of the school will also become the Early Childhood Center and the Board of Education office. The current Early Childhood Center, which is not even located in North Brunswick and instead in nearby Milltown in a building that the district has leased, will no longer be used by North Brunswick Schools. The Board of Education office is located in the former Maple Meade School, which will be sold and likely demolished after the offices are moved out and into Linwood School. Russell, Suzanne.

This post also requires him to oversee disciplinary action for on-field incidents.https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/news/mlb-moves-joe-torre-to-advisory- role-hands-disciplinarian-duties-to-former-pitcher-chris-young/ He made his Major League Baseball (MLB) debut on August 24, 2004, with the Texas Rangers and also has Major League experience with the San Diego Padres, New York Mets, Seattle Mariners, and Kansas City Royals. He had previously excelled in basketball and baseball at Highland Park High School in University Park, Texas, and Princeton University. Young helped Highland Park reach the Class 4A Region II basketball final in 1997 and the Class 4A Texas state basketball final in 1998. He tossed a no-hitter in 1997 while compiling a 6‚Äì0 record, helping Highland Park reach the Class 4A Texas state baseball final. During his senior year, he was District Most Valuable Player in basketball, and led his baseball team to the state championship, while pitching in two no-hitters. That year, he was a first-team All-State selection in basketball and baseball. After a high school career as an athlete and scholar, Young excelled in both baseball and basketball for Princeton University and became the Ivy League's first male two-sport Rookie of the Year. Selected by the Pittsburgh Pirates in the third round of the June 2000 draft, he had brief professional experiences in the Pirates, Montreal Expos, and Texas Rangers minor league systems before debuting with the Rangers in August 2004. Young's professional baseball career took off in the 2006 season, when he was the major league leader in opponent batting average, hits per nine innings and road earned run average (ERA) and was named the National League Pitcher of the Month for June. Additionally, he extended his streak of consecutive undefeated games started as a visiting pitcher to 24, and secured the only Padres win in the team's 3‚Äì1 series loss to the St. Louis Cardinals in the 2006 National League Division Series. In 2007, he defended his opponent batting average and hits per nine innings titles, but instead of winning the road ERA title he won the home ERA title. He is , which makes him, along with former pitchers Eric Hillman, Randy Johnson, Andrew Brackman and Andrew Sisco, the second tallest player in baseball history, next to relief pitcher Jon Rauch (who is and Young's teammate on the 2012 New York Mets). He was elected to the 2007 MLB All-Star Game as a first-time All-Star via the All-Star Final Vote. High school Young attended Highland Park High School, where he played basketball and baseball. He lettered three times in basketball, in a career in which he scored over 1,000 points, and accumulated 500 rebounds and 200 blocks. He was a two-year letterman in baseball, compiling a 14‚Äì3 record with 180 strikeouts. In basketball, he averaged 16 points, 12 rebounds, and 3 blocked shots a game, and in baseball he had an 8‚Äì3 record with a 1.70 ERA and 95 strikeouts in 80 innings pitched. As a sophomore in the fall of 1995, he was moved up to the varsity basketball team from the junior varsity due to injuries. As a junior, his presence was significant enough that one opposing team practiced with a coach holding a broom in the air to simulate playing against him. He helped his team reach the Class 4A-state Region II final. As a junior in baseball, Young threw a no-hitter against McKinney High School in Spring 1997. However, he missed a large part of the season after getting off to a 6‚Äì0 start because of a stress fracture in his foot. Nonetheless, he was already considered a top professional prospect, and he was named as one of seven Highland Park players on the all-district team. By the summer of 1997, he was able to play for the Dallas Mustangs who were the defending national champions in the Connie Mack World Series, and he earned the win in the fifth place game of the World Series. By January of Young's senior season, he had led his basketball team to a district-leading 23‚Äì1 (4‚Äì0 in district) record and first place in both The Dallas Morning News' Class 4A area poll and the Texas Association of Basketball Coaches' state poll. Young developed a reputation as a finesse post player, and that season he led his team to the UIL State Tournament championship game. Highland Park lost to Houston's Waltrip High School and Young was credited with a tournament-high 18 rebounds by the Fort Worth Star- Telegram, although The Dallas Morning News only credited him with 17 points and 14 rebounds. Young finished his senior season as a Texas Association of Basketball Coaches' first-team All-State selection and the District 9-4A Most Valuable Player. He was later chosen to play in the mid-summer Texas High School Coaches Association's Southwestern All-Star basketball game at the Hofheinz Pavilion. Young announced he planned to attend Princeton in May 1998. He chose Princeton over Boston College, University of Oklahoma, University of Pennsylvania, University of Texas, Vanderbilt University, and Yale University. Young's decision was based on Princeton's rising national profile in basketball and the opportunity to work with baseball coach Scott Bradley, who had played catcher for the Seattle Mariners while 6‚Äì10 pitcher Randy Johnson was with the team. On May 9, 1998, Young was involved in a combined no-hitter when he pitched into the fifth inning against Mois√©s E. Molina High School and was relieved by Mike Matthews. Highland Park won this game, which was the clinching Region II best-of-3 bi-district series game, by the 10-run rule. Young displayed home run power as a senior, and in some games, he played designated hitter. Later that month, Young pitched another no-hitter in another 10-run rule victory, this time against Carthage High School. Young was the starting pitcher at UFCU Disch-Falk Field during the Texas state 4A championship game victory against Calallen High School, and he clinched the game with a successful pickoff move. He was selected to the Texas High School Baseball Coaches Association 1998 All-State baseball team as well as The Texas Sports Writers Association third-team Class 4A all-state baseball. College career In his freshman season at Princeton University, Young was the first male athlete to be named Ivy League Rookie of the Year in two sports‚Äîbasketball and baseball‚Äîand was a unanimous selection for both awards. In addition, Young was named second-team All-Ivy in basketball and was basketball Rookie of the Week each of the final six weeks and seven weeks overall. His season was capped with Ivy League Player of the Year and freshman All-America honors from Basketball Weekly. Statistically, Young set Princeton Tigers men's basketball freshman records for points (387) and rebounds (160) by averaging 12.9 points and 5.3 rebounds a game with the 1998‚Äì99 Princeton Tigers men's basketball team. He also had 39 points, 19 rebounds, and 15 assists in three games at the Rainbow Classic basketball tournament, hosted by the University of Hawaii. He posted a season-high 24 points in a National Invitation Tournament win against the NC State Wolfpack. In baseball, Young led Princeton and the Ivy League with a 2.38 ERA. During this performance he allowed only one home run over the course of 150 batters faced, and was twice named Ivy League Rookie of the Week. Young concluded his college basketball career by starting every game with the 1999‚Äì2000 team. Among his accomplishments that season were 22 double-digit scoring games, breaking his own single-season school record for blocked shots with 87, and leading the team with 13.8 points per game, 6.3 rebounds per game, 87 blocked shots and 40 steals. He was also second on the team with 105 assists. Young had the highest rebounding average of any Princeton player since 1978 and was also the thirteenth player in school history to record 100 assists in a season. For his college basketball career, Young accumulated 801 points, 350 rebounds, and 142 blocks. His best game performances included a 20-point game on the road against the 11th-ranked Kansas Jayhawks, a career-high 30 points against Harvard, and a school record of nine blocked shots against the Ohio Bobcats. During his sophomore baseball season in 2000, Young was the Ivy League's leading pitcher with a 1.82 ERA overall and a 1.05 figure in conference games. He compiled a perfect record of 5‚Äì0 in eight appearances, with 52 strikeouts in 49‚Öì innings. Young was a unanimous first-team All-Ivy League baseball selection, and he led the Tigers to their first Ivy League title since 1996. Young pitched a complete game and struck out seven batters in the 5‚Äì2 win in the championship series opener against Dartmouth. In 2000, he played collegiate summer baseball for the Chatham A's of the Cape Cod Baseball League. Young was selected by the Pittsburgh Pirates in the third round of the 2000 amateur draft and signed a US$1.65 million contract with Pittsburgh on September 6 after holding out until he gained assurances that he would be able to complete his collegiate education. His athletic career was not entirely on hold as an upperclassman, and he was able to get some low minor league experience before completing his degree at Princeton in politics in June 2002 and becoming a full-time professional athlete. He played in the class A minor leagues after his junior year. Young then completed his senior thesis, entitled \\"The Impact of Jackie Robinson and the Integration of Baseball on Racial Stereotypes in America: A Quantitative Content Analysis of Stories about Race in the New York Times\\" while commuting on minor league buses as a player for the Hickory Crawdads. Young was also offered a two-year guaranteed contract to play basketball for the Sacramento Kings of the National Basketball Association in 2002 by fellow Princeton alum and Kings president Geoff Petrie. Professional career Chris Young warms up before game at Chicago Young was drafted by the Pittsburgh Pirates in the third round of the 2000 MLB draft. He was signed to a deal on September 6. After a few years of minor league service, he was traded to the Montreal Expos' organization. The Expos traded him to the Texas Rangers, for whom he eventually made his major league debut. After less than two seasons with the Rangers, he was traded to the San Diego Padres. =Minor leagues= In 2001, Young went 5‚Äì3 with a 4.12 ERA in 12 starts for the Hickory Crawdads in the Class-A South Atlantic League, including two complete games. In 2002, Young helped the Crawdads to the league title with an 11‚Äì9 record and 3.11 ERA in 26 starts. Young earned decisions in fifteen straight starts from April 16 and July 4. He allowed more than three earned runs in just two of 26 starts. Opposing batters batted .234. He was traded to the Montreal Expos with Jon Searles for pitcher Matt Herges in a postseason trade. Young began the 2003 season on the disabled list before joining the Brevard County Manatees of the Florida State League towards the end of April. He posted a 5‚Äì2 record with a 1.62 ERA, and held opposing batters to a .150 batting average in eight starts. His season was highlighted by an eight-inning, one-hit, no-walk, eight-strikeout performance against the Fort Myers Miracle on May 11. This capped a 3‚Äì0, 0.47 ERA start to the season. In June 2003, Young was promoted to the Harrisburg Senators of the Double-A Eastern League. He went 4‚Äì4 with a 4.01 ERA in 15 starts. In July, he went 3‚Äì0 and finished with an ERA of 3.03 over five starts. His season was highlighted by an eight-strikeout final outing on August 30 against the Norwich Navigators and a win on July 27 against the Reading Phillies in which he threw seven shutout innings. He was traded by the Montreal Expos to the Texas Rangers organization on April 3, 2004 in a preseason deal along with Josh McKinley for Einar D√≠az and Justin Echols. He started the 2004 season with the Frisco RoughRiders of the Texas League where he went 6‚Äì5 with a 4.48 ERA in 18 starts. The only two home runs he allowed in his final 12 starts and 61 innings with the RoughRiders occurred on July 3, against Round Rock. He struck out a season-high eight batters on May 9 against El Paso. Young was promoted to the Triple-A Oklahoma RedHawks of the Pacific Coast League in late July and went a perfect 3‚Äì0 with a 1.48 ERA in five starts. During this brief stint he allowed only nine walks while compiling 34 strikeouts, and held opposition batters to a .189 average. He posted four quality starts, and in his fifth start he only allowed two runs. The club was 4‚Äì1 in his PCL starts. The only loss was due to a blown save with a 4‚Äì2 ninth-inning lead on August 7 against the Tacoma Rainiers in a game in which Young allowed no earned runs. He was named Pacific Coast League Pitcher of the Week for August 16 to 22 after his last start on August 18 against the Memphis Redbirds. Young took a no-hitter into the sixth inning of his second Triple-A start on August 2 against the Sacramento River Cats. =Texas Rangers= 2004 Young debuted with the Rangers on August 24, 2004 against the Minnesota Twins. He pitched 5‚Öî innings, giving up four hits and three earned runs, while striking out four and walking three batters. Young exited the game trailing 3‚Äì0, but was rescued by a comeback walk-off 5‚Äì4 win. This debut made Young the first Princeton baseball player to start a major league game at any position since Dave Sisler (son of Hall of Famer George Sisler and brother of Dick Sisler) gave up six earned runs in just over four innings on August 27, 1961 in the second game of a doubleheader against the Detroit Tigers. The game also marked the first appearance in a major league game by a Princeton baseball player since Bob Tufts played his final game for the Kansas City Royals on May 6, 1983. Other Princeton baseball players who have recorded either 50 innings pitched or 130 at bats (the requirements to qualify for Rookie of the Year) in the major leagues are Moe Berg, Homer Hillebrand, King Lear, Dutch Meier, Dutch Sterrett, and Bobby Vaughn. Young has been joined in the major leagues by Princetonian Ross Ohlendorf who debuted for the New York Yankees on September 11, 2007. Another Princetonian, Tim Lahey, was on the Philadelphia Phillies roster from the team's Opening Day on March 31, 2008 until April 5, 2008 without making an appearance. The debut, which occurred in a home game at Ameriquest Field in Arlington, served as a homecoming for Young who grew up in nearby Dallas, Texas and went to Highland Park High School. With his debut, Young became the second-tallest player in Major League Baseball, only an inch shorter than the Jon Rauch. Three other current and previous pitchers‚ÄîRandy Johnson, Andrew Sisco and Eric Hillman‚Äîare also . He became the tallest pitcher in Rangers history, surpassing the right-handed pitcher Mike Smithson. After becoming part of the starting rotation, he made seven starts and compiled a 3‚Äì2 record with a 4.71 ERA. Young signed a three-year contract through 2007 on November 19. Young's first major league decision came during his second start in an August 29 loss to the Baltimore Orioles. His first win came in his third start on September 4 against the Boston Red Sox. His fifth start was a six-inning performance in a 1‚Äì0 win against the Anaheim Angels on September 19. This was the first Ranger 1‚Äì0 victory since August 25, 2000 against the Toronto Blue Jays, a stretch of 669 games. The club went 5‚Äì2 during his starts in his brief 2004 stint with the club. 2005 Young was one of three rookies on the Opening Day roster. He made 31 starts in 2005 with the Rangers, compiling a 12‚Äì7 record with a 4.26 ERA. His twelve victories tied Kevin Brown's record for most wins by a Rangers rookie. His season started slowly, with seven earned runs allowed in 7‚Öì innings pitched (8.59 ERA) over his first two starts. However, over the course of 11 starts from April 17 ‚Äì June 13, he lowered his ERA to a season-low 2.78 by going 6‚Äì2, 2.18 in 70‚Öì innings pitched over that stretch. This included the month of May when he went 3‚Äì0 in five starts with a 1.42 ERA that was third-best among all qualifying major leaguers for the month. This included his season-high 13‚Öî scoreless innings recorded from May 3‚Äì9. He had subsequent hot and cold streaks, with a record of 2‚Äì4 and a 9.07 ERA in nine starts from June 20 ‚Äì August 2, followed by a 2.53 ERA over his final nine starts. He closed out the season by winning his final four decisions, which was a personal best. May 9 was one of two times Young came within an inning of a shutout by pitching eight scoreless innings; August 17 against the Cleveland Indians was the other. Young recorded a personal-best eight strikeouts in a seven-inning no- decision on June 2 at Detroit. The closest Young came to a no-hitter was 5‚Öî innings of hitless pitching in a road game against the Houston Astros on June 25 before allowing a Craig Biggio single in the sixth inning. Over the course of the season, Young was the beneficiary of the second-highest run support in the majors, trailing only David Wells of the Boston Red Sox. However, he surrendered three runs or less in 22 of 31 starts. After a 2005 season when he went 5‚Äì0 with a 3.47 ERA in 11 games during the day and 7‚Äì7 with a 4.71 ERA in 20 games at night, he had a career 8‚Äì1 record with a 3.31 ERA in 15 day games and 7‚Äì8 with a 5.05 mark in 23 games at night. In his rookie season, Young ranked in the top five among qualifying major league rookies in several statistical categories: strikeouts (second, 137), wins (tied for third, 12), ERA (fourth, 4.26), starts (fifth, 31) and innings pitched (fifth, 164‚Öî). He also tied Rangers rookie club records: wins (12, Edwin Correa in 1986 and Kevin Brown in 1989) and pre All-Star break wins (8, Jeff Zimmerman in 1999 and Jos√© Guzm√°n in 1986). Young ranked fifth among all American League pitchers with 7.5 strikeouts per 9 innings. Despite this success, however, he was a key part of an offseason trade that also sent Terrmel Sledge and Adri√°n Gonz√°lez to the San Diego Padres for starting pitcher Adam Eaton, middle reliever Akinori Otsuka and minor-league catcher Billy Killian. =San Diego Padres= 2006 Chris Young wearing the Padres military-style jersey 2006 marked Young's breakout season. His ERA continued its downward trend, falling to 3.46 over 31 starts, good enough for sixth best in the National League, and he recorded a career-high 169 strikeouts. He finished with an 11‚Äì5 record, led all major league pitchers with a 2.41 road ERA, allowed a league- leading 6.72 hits per 9 innings pitched, and a .206 opponent batting average. He had 15 no decisions, the most among MLB starting pitchers in 2006. During 2006 he led the majors in stolen bases allowed, with 41. During the season, Young won a National League Pitcher of the Month award, took a no-hitter into the sixth inning or beyond three times, and extended his undefeated road start streak to 24 games. This streak made Young one of only three pitchers in major league history to have gone at least 23 straight road starts without a loss; Allie Reynolds set the record at 25 straight road starts spanning the 1948 and 1949 seasons, with Russ Meyer falling one short, going undefeated in 24 straight road contests spanning the 1953 and 1954 seasons. In his first six starts after Memorial Day, he improved from a 3‚Äì3 with a 4.32 ERA to 7‚Äì3 with a 2.97 ERA, by allowing only four earned runs over 38‚Öî innings. He was named one of five candidates from the National League for Major League Baseball's \\"All-Star Final Vote\\" to determine the final official selection for the 2006 Major League Baseball All-Star Game; however, Los Angeles Dodgers first baseman Nomar Garciaparra was elected. Nonetheless, his strong June performance ‚Äì during which he allowed 16 hits and 13 walks over 30‚Öî innings, maintained a 1.17 ERA and struck out 34 ‚Äì earned him the National League Pitcher of the Month award. His five starts in June were highlighted by a career-best 12-strikeout performance on June 9 against the Florida Marlins and a June 21 win over his former team, the Texas Rangers. On September 22, Young had a no-hitter through 8‚Öì innings of the game against the Pittsburgh Pirates before pinch hitter Joe Randa hit a two-run home run. This would have been the first no-hitter in Padres history. It was the first time a Padre had taken a no-hitter into the ninth inning since Andy Ashby on September 5, 1997 vs. the Atlanta Braves. Young had been on pace for a perfect game through 5‚Öî innings. Young also took a no-hitter into the eighth inning on May 30 against the Colorado Rockies as a prelude to his June performance. In that game, which marked the first time a pitcher took a no-hitter into the eighth inning during the 2006 season, he surrendered a double to Brad Hawpe, who had been a teammate in the 1997 Connie Mack World Series, on his first pitch of the eighth inning and 99th of the game. During Young's next start on June 4 at Pittsburgh, he did not allow a hit for the first 5‚Öì innings, making him one of only two pitchers (Steve Trachsel ‚Äì June 20‚Äì25, 2002) to have consecutive starts with at least five hitless innings since the 2000 season. He ended the season by winning his first career postseason start; on October 7, he earned a 3‚Äì1 victory in Game 3 of the 2006 National League Division Series against the St. Louis Cardinals. He pitched 6‚Öî shutout innings, struck out nine, walked two and allowed four hits. It remains the Padres' only victory in ten post- season games against the Cardinals. The Padres lost the series three games to one. Young's 6‚Äì0 road performance in 2006 was one of 49 undefeated road seasons with at least five victories by a pitcher since post-season play began in 1903. However, it was the first to be followed by a postseason road victory. In November, he traveled to Japan to take part in the Major League Baseball Japan All-Star Series. Young was the starter in an exhibition game against the Yomiuri Giants, which was memorable for the major leaguers' three- run ninth-inning rally to earn a tie. This game was the prelude to the five- game series which began with three games at the Tokyo Dome and was followed by games in Osaka and Fukuoka. Young pitched the fourth game of the series. Young also blogged on behalf of mlb.com about daily life during the trip. He detailed visits with United States Ambassador to Japan Tom Schieffer, time in the Harajuku, and travels on the Bullet Train. 2007 Young throwing a four-seam fastball during pregame warmup at Wrigley Field in Chicago. In his season debut on April 4 against the San Francisco Giants, Young became the 435th different pitcher to surrender a home run to Barry Bonds when he surrendered Bonds' first of the season and 735th of his career. The game marked Young's 25th consecutive road start without a loss. Young was 9‚Äì0 during the streak, which ended in his subsequent road start on April 15 at Dodger Stadium in a 9‚Äì3 loss to the Los Angeles Dodgers. The last of the nine other pitchers to go 20 consecutive road starts without a loss was Greg Maddux who went 22 starts without a loss during 1997 and 1998. Young's streak began on June 25, 2005. On April 10, Young signed a four-year extension with the Padres through the 2010 season, reportedly worth US$14.5 million with a club option for 2011. Chris Young during delivery On June 16, Young threw a pitch that hit Chicago Cubs All-Star first baseman Derrek Lee on the back of the upper left arm. The day before the fracas, Alfonso Soriano homered off David Wells, and the Padres believed Soriano showed poor sportsmanship by admiring and celebrating his home run. The pitch nicked Lee's left hand near his surgically repaired wrist. When the Lee began walking towards first base, both he and Young, , exchanged words, and a bench-clearing altercation ensued. Both Young and Lee were ejected from the game, along with Jake Peavy and Cubs bench coach Gerald Perry. On June 18, Young and Lee were suspended five games each for their roles in the brawl, and Perry was suspended three games. All suspended parties were fined, as were Peavy and Brian Giles. Young and Lee appealed their suspensions, which were to begin the following day. At the time of the scuffle in the fourth inning, both pitchers were working on no-hitters. Young was ejected in the game, and he earned a no-decision in the game which the Padres ultimately won 1‚Äì0. On June 24, Jake Peavy surrendered three earned runs in five innings, which caused his ERA to rise from 1.98 to 2.14. This gave Young, who had a 2.08 ERA, the National League-leading average for one day. The next day, Brad Penny allowed only one earned run over eight innings to take the lead with a 2.04 ERA. Chris Young batting against Chicago Cubs starting pitcher Carlos Zambrano shortly before the brawl on June 16, 2007 On July 1, Young was nominated as a candidate for the All-Star Final Vote, contending against Tom Gorzelanny, Roy Oswalt, Brandon Webb and Carlos Zambrano. In a bid for the final spot on July 4, Young posted seven scoreless innings in a 1‚Äì0 victory over the Florida Marlins to not only retake the National League ERA lead, but also assume the major league lead over Brad Penny by a slim margin (1.9968 to 1.9970). The voting ended on July 5, with Young defeating the four opposing pitchers to earn his first career All-Star Game selection. The selection made Young the sixth Ivy League athlete named to the All-Star team (joining Lou Gehrig, Red Rolfe, Ron Darling, Brad Ausmus and Mike Remlinger). Young entered the All-Star break with the major league lead in ERA and opponent batting average as well as an undefeated streak extending back to a May 12 loss to the Cardinals. Prior to the announcement of his election, Young dropped his appeal of the five-game suspension. Young served his suspension during the final four games before the All-Star break and the first game afterwards, yet was allowed to play in the All-Star Game at AT&T; Park in San Francisco, California. In the fifth inning of the 5‚Äì4 American League victory for which Young was the losing pitcher, he surrendered the first inside-the-park home run in All-Star game history to Ichiro Suzuki. He was placed on the disabled list after he incurred a strained oblique muscle during the third inning of his July 24 start. On August 9, he was activated off the disabled list to make a scheduled start. He took a 12-start (five- decision) undefeated streak, dating back to a May 12 loss to the Cardinals, into his first start off the disabled list, but he took the loss in a 5‚Äì0 defeat, which was again against the Cardinals. Young ended the 2007 season as the major league leader in opponent batting average and hits per nine innings, but also in stolen bases allowed (with 44). He battled injuries late in the season and surrendered the ERA leadership to Jake Peavy in his August 30 start. 2008 Chris Young pitching against the Rockies on May 11, 2008 Young started the season in the second spot in the Padres rotation between ace Peavy and Maddux. He pitched his first three turns from the second spot in the rotation. On April 18, he missed his turn and Maddux moved into the second spot in the rotation. Young has since been pitching in the third spot in the rotation. The number three spot in the rotation is the only one that was not scheduled to start during the Padres visit to Wrigley Field May 12‚Äì15, 2008. Young, thus, did not make a start against the Cubs with whom he had an altercation in 2007. On May 21, 2008 in a game against the St. Louis Cardinals, Young was hit in the face by a line-drive from Albert Pujols. Young was sitting on the ground for several minutes but was able to leave the field under his own power as he only sustained a nasal fracture and a laceration on his nose. Later in the same inning, Pujols would also sprain the ankle of Padres catcher Josh Bard while sliding into home plate. Young returned to the mound on July 29 with five shutout innings against the Arizona Diamondbacks. Young then did not pitch between August 10 and September 1 due to another disabled list stint and returned to the lineup to take the loss in a game where Greg Maddux, who had become a Los Angeles Dodger, earned his 354th victory to tie Roger Clemens for eighth on the all-time list. Then, on September 7 he came within four outs of perfection when Milwaukee Brewers' Gabe Kapler hit a one-out home run in the eighth inning. He allowed two hits, did not walk a batter and struck out five, en route to 10‚Äì1 victory at Milwaukee's Miller Park. Young did not get his first perfect game or first no- hitter, but he did end up with the first complete game of his career after 114 starts. Two starts later he hit his first home run as a major league batter. 2009 After starting the season with a 4‚Äì2 record, Young lost his last four starts before spending the remainder of the season on the disabled list. His final start occurred on June 14. He was initially placed on the 15-day disabled list on June 19, but on July 31 he was transferred to the 60-day disabled list. In August, he had season ending arthroscopic surgery to repair partial tears in his labrum. He had been disabled with shoulder inflammation. For the 2009 season, he was 4-6 with a 5.21 ERA.Chris Young Stats  Baseball- Reference.com 2010 Young pitched six shutout innings in the second game of the season before being pulled with a right shoulder strain. He missed almost the entire season except for three starts near the end of the season, finishing the season 2‚Äì0 with a 0.90 ERA. In November, the Padres declined to pick up the option for 2011. In 2010, he was chosen as the eighth-smartest athlete in sports by Sporting News. =New York Mets= 2011 On January 17, 2011, Young signed a contract with the New York Mets worth $1.1 million with the ability to reach up to $4.5 million through incentives. In his first career start with the Mets on April 5, 2011, Young went five and a third innings while striking out seven batters, recording the victory in a 7‚Äì1 Mets win over the Philadelphia Phillies. He also went three for three at the plate with two runs batted in against Phillies starter Cole Hamels. In that game, Young became the first Mets pitcher in team history to record two hits in a single inning. Shortly after the start of the season, Young sustained an arm injury which forced him to miss the remainder of the 2011 season on the disabled list. Following the season, he was a free agent. 2012 New York Mets in 2012 On March 26, 2012, Young signed on a minor league deal with the Mets. He had recently undergone surgery to repair a torn anterior capsule in his right shoulder. He spent the first 33 days of the season on the triple A Buffalo Bisons' disabled list before being activated on May 10. Young subsequently made three starts with the single A St. Lucie Mets on May 11, May 16 and 25 before being promoted back to Buffalo on May 27. He compiled a 1‚Äì0 record with 3.18 ERA in 17.0 innings during the three starts. On May 31, he pitched 6 scoreless innings for the Bisons against the Columbus Clippers. The Mets announced on June 4 that they would call Young up to the major league roster on June 5. On June 5, 2012, Young made his return against the Washington Nationals at Nationals Park with the Mets, giving up 3 runs (2 earned) over 5 innings in a game that was eventually decided in 12 innings. On June 6 his wife gave birth and he was placed on a paternity leave, which was not intended to interfere with his June 10 scheduled start. The move was for the purpose of freeing up a roster spot during Young's off days under a Major League Baseball rule that allows for a three-day leave. Young made his next start on June 12 against the Tampa Bay Rays, earning his first win in over a year. =Washington Nationals= 2013‚Äì14 On February 21, 2013, Young signed a minor league deal with the Washington Nationals and an invitation to training camp. On March 26, 2013 he was granted his unconditional release by the Nationals after opting out of his contract. He was re-signed by the Nationals on April 4, 2013. He was then assigned to Triple-A Syracuse. He made his season debut on April 23 against Rochester, giving up 6 runs in 4.2 innings. He made 6 additional starts before going on the disabled list with a neck injury on May 28, 2 days after leaving a start against Columbus after the first inning. He made 2 starts at the end of the year in the Gulf Coast League and with Short-Season Auburn before the end of the injury-marred season. In 9 total starts, he went 1‚Äì2 with a 6.81 ERA, striking out 21 in 37 innings. After experiencing pain in his shoulder and neck, he had surgery to repair what was diagnosed as thoracic outlet syndrome. This condition is a nerve problem that puts pressure on a pitcher's shoulder. On November 19, 2013, Young re-signed with the Nationals on a minor league deal. He was released on March 25, 2014. =Seattle Mariners= 2014 Seattle Mariners in 2014 Young signed a highly incentivized one-year deal with the Seattle Mariners on March 27, 2014. Young was scheduled to debut as a starter for the Mariners on April 4. However, the Oakland Coliseum had its first rainout since 1998. As a result, after 159 Major League starts and 102 Minor League starts, Young made his first appearance as a relief pitcher (other than the 2007 All-Star Game) and he pitched two shutout innings on April 6 against the Oakland A's later in that series. He made his first Major League start since September 9, 2012 on April 13 against Oakland. He posted six scoreless innings, while scattering 4 hits and 3 walks. By early June, Young was in the conversation for Major League Baseball Comeback Player of the Year Award, with a 5‚Äì2 start and 3.27 ERA, according to MLB.com's Adam Lewis. In helping to stabilize a rotation battered by injuries and ineffectual fifth starters, Mariners manager Lloyd McClendon was unabashed in his praise of the right-hander at the time, calling him a \\"godsend.\\" Young finished the season with a 12‚Äì9 record and a 3.65 ERA in 29 starts. His 7.8 hits per nine innings was the sixth in the AL. Following the season, Young was recognized with the Major League Baseball Comeback Player of the Year Award, The Sporting News American League Comeback Player of the Year Award, and Players Choice Comeback Player of the Year Award. At the conclusion of the season, Young became a free agent. =Kansas City Royals= 2015 Kansas City Royals in the 2015 World Series On March 7, 2015, Young signed with the Kansas City Royals. Young entered the season in the long reliever role with the Royals. He appeared in the Royals' sixth game on April 12 against the Los Angeles Angels with two scoreless innings as the Royals started the season 6‚Äì0. Young made his first start with the Royals on May 1. He tossed five no-hit innings against the Detroit Tigers. On June 16, Young posted 7 shutout innings and 3 runs batted in against the Milwaukee Brewers, becoming the first Royals pitcher to tally 3 RBI in a game since 1972. After achieving a record of 8‚Äì6 with a 3.25 ERA through the end of July, Young was returned to the bullpen on July 31 after posting a 5.11 ERA over a 5-game stretch. On September 27 (one day after his father died), Young made his first start since July 28 and pitched 5 no-hit innings against the Cleveland Indians. On October 20, Young started and pitched 4 2/3 innings in a game 4 victory in the 2015 American League Championship Series against the Toronto Blue Jays. It was Young's first postseason start since the 2006 National League Division Series. He earned the win in the October 27 game 1 of the 2015 World Series when he shut down the New York Mets, giving up a walk and no hits while striking out 4 over the final three innings, to help the Royals win 5‚Äì4 in 14 innings. 2016 On December 7, 2015, the Royals announced that they had signed Young to a two-year $11.75 million contract with mutual third- year option. After beginning the 2016 season with a record of 1-5 in 7 starts, Young was placed on the disabled list with a strained right forearm from May 12 to 28. After his DL stint, Young continued to serve the Royals as a swingman out of the bullpen, finishing the season appearing in 34 games, 13 starts. He was 3-9 and registered a 6.19 ERA, his highest ERA over a full season to that point in his career. He also tied a career high by allowing 28 home runs, and gave up a career-high 10.6 hits per 9 innings. 2017 Young began the season in the bullpen after failing to win a spot in the Kansas City rotation. On June 23, 2017, Young was designated for assignment by the Royals. He was immediately released. For the 2017 season, he was 0-0 with a 7.50 ERA in 14 games. =Return to the Padres= Young signed a minor league contract with the Padres on December 29, 2017. He was released on March 27, 2018. Retirement Young moved into administration effective May 14, 2018 as the Vice President, On-Field Operations, Initiatives & Strategy under MLB Chief Baseball Officer Joe Torre, reporting directly to Senior Vice President, On-Field Operations Peter Woodfork. Head of MLB Operations In May 2018, Young became an MLB executive when he was promoted to serve as vice president of on-field operations, initiatives and strategy. In February 2020, Young was promoted to Senior Vice President to replace Joe Torre as the MLB's enforcer of discipline action, such as deciding fines and suspensions.https://www.espn.com/mlb/story/_/id/28649530/former-pitcher-chris- young-replacing-joe-torre-mlb-disciplinarian With this promotion, Young's position was also named Senior Vice President He also oversees the On-Field Operations and Umpiring Departments.https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/news/mlb- moves-joe-torre-to-advisory-role-hands-disciplinarian-duties-to-former- pitcher-chris-young Player profile =Pitching style= Young is not a traditional power pitcher. He is said to be a control pitcher in a power pitcher's body‚Äîhis pitching style is more like Greg Maddux's than that of five-time Cy Young Award winner Randy Johnson, who is the same height as Young. Young has been traded three times partly because of the low velocity of his fastball, which is in the 83‚Äì87 miles per hour (133.6‚Äì140 km/h) range. Young has learned how to use precise location to make his fastball effective. He has also been compared to another control pitcher, Jim Palmer, because Young similarly induces popups and fly ball outs with deceptive late movement on his high fastballs. Over 50% of the balls put in play against him are fly balls. Of the flyballs hit off Young in 2007, 3.8% were home runs. while the average is about 11%. From 2003 to 2006 the best single-season percentage was 6.2% by Dontrelle Willis in 2005. Young's mid-2000s repertoire included fastballs, curveballs, sliders and changeups. His curveball is a slow curveball and his fastball has been described by former teammate and catcher Mike Piazza as having late life and late movement that seems to jump. His curveball is used to keep the hitters off balance so that they do not jump on his low-velocity fastball. Former Ranger pitching coach Orel Hershiser says Young has the ability to throw his fastball to all locations effectively which gives him a chance at success. Hershiser describes Young's pitches as sneaky fast because his methodical delivery and size give him deception. This delivery has also left him susceptible to stolen bases due to the relatively long time it takes for him to deliver a pitch from the stretch.Chris Young's Fatal Flaw  FanGraphs Baseball By 2012, nearly all of his pitches were fastballs or sliders. =Batting= Throughout his career, Young had a career .150 batting average, including 31 hits, eight of which were extra base hits (six doubles, one triple, and one home run). He never recorded a stolen base. The only Princeton players who have hit a home run or recorded a stolen base at least once during their careers, along with Young, are Moe Berg, Dutch Sterrett, Homer Hillebrand, Dutch Meier, Ted Reed, Bobby Vaughn, and Will Venable. Venable is the most recent player to have accomplished the feat. These same players join Young as Princeton alumni to have hit a home run. Berg had been the last to do so before Young hit his home run on September 20, 2008. Personal life Young's wife, Elizabeth Patrick, is the granddaughter of Lester Patrick, who was the namesake of the National Hockey League's Patrick Division and the Lester Patrick Trophy. She was also a member of the Princeton University class of 2002, and she attends law school in Washington, D.C. On March 4, 2008, she was induced into labor four days before her due date to deliver a girl named Catherine Elizabeth. In July 2010, the Youngs had their second child (first son), Scott Patrick. On June 6, 2012, the Youngs had their third child, Grant Christopher.

In 1996, at the age of 19, he became the youngest player to ever be chosen for an Olympic baseball team, and his team won a silver medal in the Atlanta Olympics. Professional career start in Japan =Chunichi Dragons= The Chunichi Dragons drafted Fukudome in 1998 in the first round as a shortstop. Fukudome had grown up a fan of Dragons infielder Kazuyoshi Tatsunami, and received an autograph from Tatsunami, who would be his teammate when he joined the Dragons. Manager Senichi Hoshino used Fukudome in 132 games in his rookie year, and Fukudome batted .284 with 16 home runs, and contributing to his team's league championship. However, he also led the league in strikeouts. While Fukudome was fast and had a strong throwing arm, he simply could not field ground balls well at shortstop. He made several errors which led to his team's loss in the Japan Series, and was often taken out of games in later innings. He was converted to third base in his second year, but his fielding improved little, and his hitting dropped as well. The next year, he was moved to the outfield. While he played poorly at first, he gradually improved to become the everyday right fielder. His natural speed and strong arm has since led to his winning four Golden Glove awards in the outfield. His hitting also improved dramatically. He stopped Hideki Matsui in his run for the triple crown in , by leading the league in batting average (.343). He hit .313 with 34 homers the next year, establishing himself as one of the best hitters in the league. In 2004, he joined the Japanese Olympic baseball team for the second time, winning a bronze medal in the Athens Olympics. He was chosen for the 2006 World Baseball Classic team, and pinch-hit with a two-run home run off Byung-hyun Kim in the semi-finals against Korea. He pinch-hit again in the finals for a two-run hit against Cuba. In 2006, he batted .351 with 31 home runs and 104 RBIs, winning the Central League MVP award. Career in the United States Fukudome with the Cubs Fukudome at bat with the Chicago Cubs When asked whether he had any interest in the Major Leagues on a television show in the 2006 off-season, Fukudome answered, \\"It would be a lie to say I didn't. Playing in the World Baseball Classic increased my desire to play in the majors.\\" =Chicago Cubs= Fukudome with the Cubs in 2008 Fukudome became a free agent in November 2007. On December 11, 2007, the Chicago Cubs signed Fukudome to a four-year, $48 million contract. Fukudome said in an interview that one of the main reasons he chose the Chicago Cubs over the other three teams trying to sign him to their roster was because he wanted to be the first Japanese player to play for the team. He also thought Chicago had a great Japanese community, and that it was a great place to raise his children. Fukudome made his Major League debut on March 31, 2008, against the Milwaukee Brewers at Wrigley Field. He went 3-for-3 with a walk, including a double on his first Major League pitch, and a three-run game-tying home run off Brewers' closer √âric Gagn√© in the bottom of the ninth inning. The Brewers went on to win 4-3 in extra innings. In April 2008, a souvenir stand selling unlicensed Cubs apparel sold a t-shirt bearing the Cubs cartoon bear wearing oversized Harry Caray-style glasses encircled by the phrase \\"Horry Kow\\" (an Engrish play on Caray's \\"Holy Cow!\\" catchphrase) in cartoonish Asian script below. Mark Kolbusz, the souvenir stand operator, said the shirt was his top seller so far that season, and that 1 in 10 customers complained that it was offensive. After he was shown the shirt, Fukudome said through his interpreter, \\"I don't know what the creator of the shirt meant this to be, but they should make it right. Maybe the creator created it because he thought it was funny, or maybe he made it to condescend the race. I don't know.\\" After a story on the t-shirt appeared in the Chicago Sun-Times, the Cubs ordered Kolbusz to pull the shirt off the stand and to stop production. After a fast start, Fukudome's 2008 MLB performance faded. After a .327 batting average in April, each successive month reflected less success as Fukudome batted .293 in May, .264 in June, .236 in July, .193 in August, and .178 in September, followed by .100 in the postseason. He ended the year with a .257 average, and a .370 slugging percentage. He hit .251 against right-handers, and .137 when there were 2 outs and runners in scoring position. Fukudome's slide was detailed in a New York Times article. Nonetheless, on July 7, 2008, Fukudome was voted a starter in the 2008 MLB All-Star Game.https://www.baseball- reference.com/pi/bsplit.cgi?n1=fukudko01 Cubs manager Lou Piniella defended him from criticism, and said, \\"[Fukudome] does such a good job in right field we hate to take him out of the lineup\\", and further stated the team would continue to give him more opportunities. After the Game 2 loss to the Dodgers in the NLDS, a reporter asked Piniella, enraged about the loss, about starting Fukudome. Piniella responded, \\"I'm going to play [Mike] Fontenot or Reed Johnson or somebody else, and that's the end of that story. The kid is struggling, and there's no sense sending him out there anymore.\\"http://mlb.mlb.com/news/article.jsp?ymd=20081003&content;_id=3586311&vkey;=news_chc&fext;=.jsp&c;_id=chc Fukudome managed only one single in 10 at-bats in the postseason. In 2009, the Cubs switched Fukudome to center field, after acquiring right fielder Milton Bradley. In July, Fukudome became the Cubs' leadoff hitter. He replaced Alfonso Soriano, who had been performing poorly in May and June. He had the lowest range factor of all starting major league center fielders (2.29).\\"MLB Player Fielding Stats ‚Äì As cf ‚Äì 2009\\" ESPN, accessed October 6, 2009 Fukudome walked 93 times, hit 38 doubles, and stole six bases. His .375 on-base percentage was second on the team. During his time in Chicago, Fukudome quickly endeared himself to supporters and became a fan favorite. His #1 Jersey was one of the League's best sellers during his tenure with the Cubs. =Cleveland Indians= On July 28, 2011, he was traded to the Cleveland Indians for 2 minor league prospects. In 59 games in Cleveland, he hit only .249. On August 12, right fielder Shin-Soo Choo was activated from the 15-day disabled list, moving Fukudome to Center field. But on August 27, Choo suffered another injury that would put him on the 15-day disabled list again on September 1, and that moved Fukudome back to right. =Chicago White Sox= Fukudome signed a 1-year $1 million contract with the Chicago White Sox on February 14, 2012. On June 22, Fukudome was designated for assignment after hitting .171, 0 home runs and 4 RBI in 24 games played and 41 at-bats. Fukudome was released June 26. =New York Yankees= The New York Yankees signed Fukudome to a minor league contract on July 13, 2012. Fukudome was released by the Yankees September 3, 2012 after hitting .264 in 43 games for New York's AAA Scranton/Wilkes-Barre team. Return to Japan =Hanshin Tigers= After the MLB season, Fukodome left the United States to return to Japan and sign with the Hanshin Tigers. After playing just 63 games in 2013 and 104 in 2014 with limited offensive production, Fukudome experienced a resurgence in 2015 at the age of 38. In playing all but three of the season's 143 games, he batted .281 with 20 home runs, 24 doubles, and 76 RBI. The home run and RBI totals were Fukudome's highest since his second to last year with the Chunichi Dragons of the Central League in 2006. At the end of the 2015 season, Fukudome was named to an NPB Best Nine lineup for a fourth time and was awarded his fifth career Golden Glove as an outfielder. The nine years between his last Golden Glove and 2015 is a Central League record. He will return to the Tigers' outfield in 2016 for his 18th professional season at age 39. On 30 July 2016, Fukudome became the 4th player in NPB history to register multiple cycle hits as he helped lead the Tigers to an 8-3 victory over his former team, the Chunichi Dragons. World Baseball Classic Fukudome was a part of the 2006 World Baseball Classic and 2009 World Baseball Classic champion Japanese teams.

It is the eighth novel in a series of nine known collectively as The Rescuers which tells the story of two little mice, Bernard and Miss Bianca, and their adventures as members of the Mouse Prisoner's Aid Society, a mouse organization dedicated to cheering up and rescuing prisoners around the world. Plot summary When Miss Bianca's owner, referred to as \\"The Boy,\\" becomes sick and is taken to a mountain resort far from the city, where the fresh air will help him get over his illness. Miss Bianca must travel with him and leaves her house, known as the \\"Porcelain Pagoda,\\" in charge of Bernard, whom she trusts with her life. Shortly after Miss Bianca leaves, Bernard is visited in his bachelor flat by an obnoxious old mouse named Nicodemus, who tells him that he is in a great predicament and hoped to find the legendary Miss Bianca to help him. The problem centers around his owner, an orphaned young lady named Miss Tomasina, who has been kidnapped by mountain bandits under the order of her legal guardian, and with only three days before she comes of age to claim her parents' properties as hers. Bernard decides to take the case, in the process gathering valuable clues and going through several mishaps, like being kept as a pet for a few minutes by a bunch of school girls and almost getting roasted alive by two housemaids. He also meets one of the most curious characters of the whole series, a stuffed bear named Algernon, who proves to be an invaluable ally for the future. Bernard and Algernon eventually travel to a desolate and perilous wasteland known as the \\"Wolf Range,\\" where their clues had pointed that Miss Tomasina is being kept. All this time, Miss Bianca daydreams about Bernard and wonders what he is up to. When she arrives home from the mountains, she realises that Bernard is nowhere to be found and worriedly runs to his flat to see if he is not terribly ill, ready to nurse him all night if necessary. Upon questioning Nicodemus and Bernard's neighbors, she hears all about Bernard's quest to rescue Miss Tomasina and really begins to worry about him. It is in this point of the series that readers realise just how important Bernard is to Miss Bianca, and is where she lets go of her formal self and gives in to her love for him, realizing that she just cannot live without Bernard. She refuses to eat or sleep, and becomes very taciturn, thinking of nothing except her dear Bernard, lost in some desolate corner of the Wolf Range, with only a stuffed toy to accompany him. Meanwhile, Bernard and Algernon eventually find the bandits' hideout and rescue Miss Tomasina right on time. The most hilarious events occur at this point, as well as a very bleak one: the legal guardian of Miss Tomasina dies from a heart attack in the middle of the court. After all the adventure, Algernon finds a place with another stuffed bear named Nigel and form a stuffed toy club. Bernard returns to Miss Bianca and they sit beside the fountain in her courtyard, leading to one of the few but very touching moments in which Bernard and Miss Bianca's whiskers touch and they feel each other's love aglow. Miss Bianca asks Bernard to please come and live with her, for she feels that they have had enough adventure in their lifetime and wishes to settle down and retire. Bernard, however, has a different feeling. Something inside him tells him that there is still something he must do, one more adventure to live, which leads to the final part of the Rescuers series, Bernard into Battle.

Schools =Peterhouse Boys' School= The boys' school is the oldest member of the group. It was founded in 1955 by Rector Fred Snell, who had previously been headmaster at Michaelhouse in South Africa. The school has an enrollment of approximately 500 boys, all of whom are boarders. The boys are organised into six houses named after people who were significant in the history of the school or the Anglican Church in Zimbabwe. They are, in order of founding: *Ellis, named after Sir Ellis Robins. He was Chairman of the British South Africa Company. *Paget, named after The Rev Edward Francis Paget who was a Zimbabwean Anglican Bishop in the middle part of the 20th century. *Grinham, named after Robert Grinham founder and former headmaster of Ruzawi School. *Malvern, named after Sir Godfrey Huggins who became Lord Malvern. He was a Prime Minister of Southern Rhodesia (1933‚Äì53) and first Prime Minister of the Federation of Rhodesia and Nyasaland (1953‚Äì56). *Founders, named in honour of all the schools founders. *Snell, named after Fred Snell, the school's founder. Each boy is allocated a house upon enrollment, and he remains a member of that house until he leaves. In addition to the houses being buildings in which the boys reside, they are also the teams through which the boys compete on the sporting academic and cultural front. In the late 1980s an additional house, Tinokura was created to house D Block boys (aged 13 and 14) in their first year at Peterhouse. Tinokura is organised so that each boy shares a dormitory with other D Blockers from his house for the year; its purpose is to allow the new boy to adjust to the Peterhouse 'system' before exposure to the strict regimental functioning of the main houses. =Peterhouse Girls' School= The girls' school was founded in 1987, two years after the opening of Springvale House under the headship of Michael Hammond with 28 pupils. Peterhouse Girls' has an enrollment of 430 boarding pupils. Unlike Peterhouse Boys', the girls' school has two separate house systems (that is, boarding and competitive houses). The girls' school has a horizontal boarding structure. The boarding houses at Peterhouse Girls' School are: *D Block accommodates girls in D Block (Form 1). *Kathleen House was named after Kathleen Grinham, wife of Canon Robert Grinham, founder of Springvale School and accommodates the C Block (Form 2) girls. *Margaret House was named after Margaret Snell, wife of Fred Snell, founder of Peterhouse and accommodates the B Block (Form 3) girls. *Elizabeth House was named after Elizabeth Megahey, wife of Alan Megahey, who established the Peterhouse Group of Schools and accommodates the A Block (Form 4) girls. *Williams Field - The senior girls (that is, the Vth Form and VIth Form) move into Vth Form cottages and VIth Form cottages. The competitive houses compete in areas such as academics, cultural and sporting activities. House points are awarded for these competitions. The houses are named after some of the first animals at Gosho Park, the names are: *Eland, *Impala, *Kudu and *Sable. =Springvale House= Initially founded as Springvale School in 1952 by Robert Grinham and Maurice Carver (then a boys' school), the school reopened in 1985 under the oversight of the Peterhouse Group with the name Springvale House. The school is a co-educational day and boarding institution, unlike the senior schools in the Group which are single-sex, full-boarding institutions. Parks =Gosho Park= Gosho Park is a conservation area of approximately of land on the Springvale Estate (it is adjacent to Peterhouse Girls' School and Springvale House), enclosed by a game fence. It named after Patrick Gosho, a former Estate Manager at Springvale House. The park is an area of Brachystegia woodland with two streams, their associated grasslands and rocky outcrops (some with Bushmen paintings). 237 species of birds have been recorded by the Mashonaland East Birding Group with a variety of Brachystegia species such as the spotted creeper, miombo and rufous-bellied tits. There are 72 species of trees in the area as recorded by the Tree Society. Gosho Park is used regularly by the three schools and neighbouring schools for educational and recreational purposes. Conservation camps are organised for primary school pupils; and geography field trips, research projects in biology and leadership courses take place in the park. =Calderwood Park= Petrean Society The Petrean Society is the alumni/alumnae association of individuals involved in the Peterhouse Boys' and Peterhouse Girls' schools. A Petrean is any pupil who has been a member of the school, normally for a minimum period of two years; any person who has been a member of the staff of the school for at least three years; or any person who has been a member of the Executive Committee of the school for at least three years.

Biography Robertson, the son of the Rev. John Robertson, was born at Halstead, Essex, England. He was educated at the Southwestern Academy, Glasgow and trained as a bookseller with James Maclehose, bookseller to the University of Glasgow. He emigrated to New Zealand as a young man, and, two years later (in 1882), he relocated to Sydney, where he found employment at the local branch of George Robertson and Company, booksellers of Melbourne. He was not related to the founder of that firm. In January 1886 he joined David M. Angus in partnership, at first in Market Street, Sydney and later, in Castlereagh Street. After Angus' death in 1900 Robertson continued in partnership with Frederick Wymark and Richard Thomson who had acquired Angus' share of the business, until in 1907 the partnership was converted into a public company and continues under the name of Angus & Robertson Ltd. As a bookseller Robertson was always interested in buying \\"books and other rare items relating to Australia and adjacent regions\\". He encouraged the wealthy Sydney book collector David Scott Mitchell to collect early Australian books and manuscripts. Mitchell's formation of his unmatched collection, which he later bequeathed to the state of New South Wales, was \\"largely indebted to the efforts of booksellers who knew Australiana, including George Robertson, Fred W. Wymark, William Dymock and James R. Tyrrell\\".Geoffrey Chapman Ingleton, \\"Australiana\\", in: The Australian Encyclopedia, The Grolier Society of Australia, 1963, Vol. 1, p. 340. Around 1895 the publishing side of the business began to be developed and many successful volumes were launched. Among the earlier authors were Henry Lawson, Banjo Paterson and Victor Daley. Robertson could recognize quickly a promising author and was willing to take considerable risks in backing his judgment. During the last 30 years of his life the number of volumes he published exceeded the total number brought out in the same period by all the other publishers in Australia. The Australian Encyclopaedia, published in two volumes in 1926, is one of the most important books published in Australia. In recognition to Robertson's contribution to publishing, the Australian Publishers Association has established the George Robertson Award, for individuals who have 30+ years' service to publishing and its success. He was married twice, first to Elizabeth Stewart Bruce in 1881, and, in 1910, to Eva Adeline Ducat. He died at the age of 73 and was survived by his second wife and his children (three daughters and a son) from his first marriage.

He moved to Ann Arbor in the early 1970s to work as an investment officer at the University of Michigan, where he remained employed until his retirement in 2001. Jernigan was elected to the Ann Arbor city council from the city's fourth ward in 1982. In 1987, Jernigan ran for Ann Arbor mayor as a moderate Republican. He defeated the perennial conservative mayoral candidate Paul S. Jensen in the Republican primary, and unseated the one-term Democratic incumbent mayor, Edward C. Pierce, in the April election. Jernigan won reelection as mayor in 1989, beating back a challenge from Democratic candidate Raymond F. Clevenger, who had served as a U.S. Representative from Michigan's 11th district from 1965-67. During his second term, Jernigan successfully spearheaded a voter referendum to raise city penalties for marijuana possession to $25 for a first offense, after calling Ann Arbor's famously lenient \\"five-dollar pot law\\" an \\"embarrassment\\" to the city.\\"Michigan,\\" USA Today, 20 December 1989, p. 7A; \\"Home of 'Hash Bash' May Raise Pot Fine,\\" Washington Times, 10 January 1990, p.

Houle (born February 12, 1985) is a Canadian former professional ice hockey goaltender who played one game in the National Hockey League (NHL) for the Philadelphia Flyers during the season. Playing career As a youth, Houle played in the 1999 Quebec International Pee-Wee Hockey Tournament with the Richelieu √âclaireurs minor ice hockey team. Houle played junior ice hockey for the Cape Breton Screaming Eagles of the Quebec Major Junior Hockey League from 2001 to 2005. He ended the 2003-04 season ranked second in the league with 34 wins and a 2.32 GAA. He was awarded the Jacques Plante Memorial Trophy as the QMJHL goaltender of the year, named a QMJHL first-team all-star, and a Canadian Hockey League second-team all-star. House was drafted by the Philadelphia Flyers 232nd overall in the 2004 NHL Entry Draft. He was named the QMJHL Defensive Player of the Year, and finished 7th in the QMJHL in wins (26) and 5th in GAA (2.51). Following his senior season in the QMJHL, he attended Flyers training camp, but was reassigned to the Trenton Titans of the ECHL at the close of the Philadelphia Phantoms training camp. Houle had played seven straight games for the Titans after Scott Stirling was traded to the San Antonio Rampage. In those seven games, he managed to put together the sixth best goals against average in the ECHL. The Phantoms liked what they saw in him and decided to switch him with Rejean Beauchemin, who was struggling early in the season. At the AHL level, Houle excelled. However, the test truly came when Jamie Storr was called up to be backup goalie for Antero Niittym√§ki while Robert Esche was on the injury list. With Storr in the National Hockey League, Houle became the starting goalie and retained this for the rest of the season. Scheduled to be a restricted free agent following the 2007-08 season, Houle became an unrestricted free agent when the Flyers didn't extend him a qualifying offer. Houle eventually signed with the ECHL's Las Vegas Wranglers, but after three games and recording a 1-2-0 record with a 3.03 GAA, Houle was traded to the Cincinnati Cyclones.

History He was born in New Orleans, Louisiana a year after his parents, Michael and Jean Frayne Hosey, immigrated to the United States from County Wexford in Ireland. In 1858, the four-year- old Hosey moved with his family to Mount Vernon, Ohio, where his father took a job as a gardener on the estate of Colonel Jesse P. Buckingham.Liley, Arthur, et al.

At age 13, three years after his father died from malaria, extreme poverty forced William Hosey to drop out of a Catholic grammar school to work at Mount Vernon-based C & C Cooper Company machine shop. Five years later, William, his mother and older brother Lawrence moved to Fort Wayne, where William took a job as a machinist for the Pennsylvania Railroad. Lawrence died of pneumonia two years later. William worked at the railroad for 34 years. During this time, William attended night classes to finish his education.

Robertson was born at Glasgow, Scotland. His parents moved to Dublin when he was four years old. He subsequently became apprenticed to a firm of publishers. He worked for a time with Currey and Company Booksellers in Scotland. In Dublin he had become friendly with Samuel Mullen and the two young men decided to emigrate to Australia. They reached Melbourne on the Great Britain in 1852, bringing with them a collection of books. Robertson opened first in Russell Street but soon moved to Collins Street, and around 1861 built a three-storey building at 69 Elizabeth Street. The business was developing fast, principally on the wholesale side. In those days there were no publishers' representatives in Australia, and the great problem for the bookseller was to forecast what would be popular, and order a sufficient number of copies to meet the demand. Around 1873 large premises were built in Little Collins Street, with provision for stationery, book-binding, lithography, etc., and branches were opened in Sydney, Adelaide, Brisbane and Auckland. Commencing January 1875 he published the quarterly magazine Melbourne Review whose contents consisted chiefly of essays of quality and diversity. The issue of July 1885 may have been the last. In 1891 a revival was announced, with Henry Giles Turner as editor, and again published by Robertson & Co., but it is not known if even one issue was printed. In 1890 Robertson retired and the business was carried on by his son, Charles. It was eventually formed into a company which in 1922 was amalgamated with Melville and Mullens under the name of Robertson and Mullens Ltd. He was married twice and had a large family. The need for encouraging local literature was not then fully appreciated, but Robertson published such books as Kendall's Leaves from Australian Forests, Gordon's Sea Spray and Smoke Drift, and James Brunton Stephens' The Black Gin and other Poems.

Their independently produced album was released in 1975 by Polydor Records in Canada, then under Mercury Records label was reissued in 1976 for worldwide distribution, both labels were owned by PolyGram at the time (they are now owned by Universal Music Group). The album was picked up by many radio stations in the United States and was one of the most requested albums in Texas. As a consequence, Moxy was picked up by the larger Mercury Records label in the US and a national distribution deal was made and the album was reissued in 1976. The album produced the hit songs \\"Can't You See I'm a Star\\", \\"Train\\", \\"Out of the Darkness\\" and with \\"Sail On Sail Away\\" and \\"Moon Rider\\" that are still in the 2000s (decade) on regular rotation on several rock radio stations in Texas. The album sold well because of heavy promotion by the label who released the album on 8 Track in large numbers. Tommy Bolin was a guest musician on the album. He had previously been the lead guitarist for the James Gang and would go on to replace Ritchie Blackmore in Deep Purple. Bolin does all but two guitar solos. Earl Johnson performed all rhythm guitar and the solos on \\"Sail On Sail Away\\", \\"Can't You See I'm A Star\\" and the ending of \\"Train\\". Johnson was supposed to do all the guitar parts, but got into a disagreement with the producer and was tossed out of the studio. Bolin, being nearby, was asked by Moxy's manager Roland Paquin to fill in for Johnson. Paquin knew Bolin from when he was road manager for the James Gang. Bolin was only in the studio for this album, contrary to popular belief that he appears on Moxy II. Though Bolin's time with Moxy was short, the album is popular with his fans. Bolin's tone and phrasing were very similar to his classic James Gang sound. Buddy Caine, who is listed on the album cover, did not join the band until after the album was finished. Caine was initially brought on board by the band as a rhythm guitarist to free up Johnson so he could play the solos on stage that Bolin had played in the studio.

Œ≤-Hydroxybutyric acid is a chiral compound with two enantiomers: D-Œ≤- hydroxybutyric acid and L-Œ≤-hydroxybutyric acid. Its oxidized and polymeric derivatives occur widely in nature. In humans, D-Œ≤-hydroxybutyric acid is one of two primary endogenous agonists of hydroxycarboxylic acid receptor 2 (HCA2), a G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR). Biosynthesis In humans, can be synthesized in the liver via the metabolism of fatty acids (e.g., butyrate), , and ketogenic amino acids through a series of reactions that metabolize these compounds into acetoacetate, which is the first ketone body that is produced in the fasting state. The biosynthesis of from acetoacetate is catalyzed by the Œ≤-hydroxybutyrate dehydrogenase enzyme. Butyrate can also be metabolized into via a second metabolic pathway that does not involve acetoacetate as a metabolic intermediate. This metabolic pathway is as follows: :butyrate‚Üíbutyryl-CoA‚Üícrotonyl-CoA‚ÜíŒ≤-hydroxybutyryl-CoA‚Üípoly-Œ≤- hydroxybutyrate‚Üí()‚Üí The last reaction in this metabolic pathway, which involves the conversion of () into , is catalyzed by the hydroxybutyrate-dimer hydrolase enzyme. The concentration of Œ≤-hydroxybutyrate in human blood plasma, as with other ketone bodies, increases through ketosis. This elevated Œ≤-hydroxybutyrate level is naturally expected, as Œ≤-hydroxybutyrate is formed from acetoacetate. The compound can be used as an energy source by the brain when blood glucose is low. Diabetic patients can have their ketone levels tested via urine or blood to indicate diabetic ketoacidosis. In alcoholic ketoacidosis, this ketone body is produced in greatest concentration. Ketogenesis occurs if oxaloacetate in the liver cells is depleted, a circumstance created by reduced carbohydrate intake (through diet or starvation); prolonged, excessive alcohol consumption; and/or insulin deficiency. Because oxaloacetate is crucial for entry of acetyl-CoA into the TCA cycle, the rapid production of acetyl-CoA from fatty acid oxidation in the absence of ample oxaloacetate overwhelms the decreased capacity of the TCA cycle, and the resultant excess of acetyl-CoA is shunted towards ketone body production. Biological activity D-Œ≤-Hydroxybutyric acid, along with butyric acid, are the two primary endogenous agonists of hydroxycarboxylic acid receptor 2 (HCA2), a GPCR. Œ≤-Hydroxybutyric acid is able to cross the blood-brain-barrier into the central nervous system. Levels of Œ≤-hydroxybutyric acid increase in the liver, heart, muscle, brain, and other tissues with exercise, calorie restriction, fasting, and ketogenic diets. The compound has been found to act as a histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitor. Through inhibition of the HDAC class I isoenzymes HDAC2 and HDAC3, Œ≤-hydroxybutyric acid has been found to increase brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) levels and TrkB signaling in the hippocampus. Moreover, a rodent study found that prolonged exercise increases plasma Œ≤-hydroxybutyrate concentrations, which induces promoters of the BDNF gene in the hippocampus. These findings may have clinical relevance in the treatment of depression, anxiety, and cognitive impairment. In epilepsy patients on the ketogenic diet, blood Œ≤-hydroxybutyrate levels correlate best with degree of seizure control. The threshold for optimal anticonvulsant effect appears to be approximately 4 mmol/L. Laboratory and industrial chemistry Œ≤-Hydroxybutyric acid is the precursor to polyesters, which are biodegradable plastics. This polymer, poly(3-hydroxybutyrate), is also naturally produced by the bacteria Alcaligenes eutrophus. Œ≤-Hydroxybutyrate can be extracted from poly(3-hydroxybutyrate) by acid hydrolysis.Dieter Seebach, Albert K. Beck, Richard Breitschuh, and Kurt Job \\"Direct Degradation of the Biopolymer Poly[(R)-3-Hydroxybutrric Acid to (R)-3-Hydroxybutanoic Acid and Its Methyl Ester\\" Org. Synth. 1993, 71, 39. The concentration of in blood plasma is measured through a test that uses Œ≤-hydroxybutyrate dehydrogenase, with NAD+ as an electron-accepting cofactor. The conversion of to acetoacetate, which is catalyzed by this enzyme, reduces the NAD+ to NADH, generating an electrical change; the magnitude of this change can then be used to extrapolate the amount of in the sample.

He was born in Naples to a noble family. He first appears in the historical record as a soldier in the service of the Kingdom of Naples 1535 and later as a singer and amateur actor, including for Ferrante Sanseverino, Prince of Salerno in Naples; he probably did not perform at the wedding of Don Francesco d'Este, Alfonso II d'Este's uncle. He served in the army of Charles V and in 1554 he defected to France, where he became a gentilhomme de la chambre du Roi under Henri II and later, his sons Francois II and Charles IX. In 1571 he went to Vienna, Venice, Turin, Florence and in 1573 to Naples, where he subsequently joined the expedition of Don Juan to re-conquer Tunis for the Spanish. Later he lived in Rome, in the service of Cardinal Luigi d'Este. The first record of Brancaccio being at the court of Alfonso d'Este II in Ferrara is in 1577, singing with the ladies of the first period of the Concerto delle donne, the amateurs Lucrezia Bendidio, Leonora Sanvitale, and Vittoria Bentivoglio. In 1581 he published a translation and commentary on Julius Caesar's Commentarii de Bello Gallico in Venice, which survives in printings from 1581, 1582 (Vittorio Baldini), and 1585 (Aldo Manuzzio). Brancaccio was brought to the court at Ferrara by Duke Alfonso II d'Este specifically to sing for his musica secreta, where he was highly prized as a skilled bass. According to one contemporary commentator, part of the agreement when Brancacio was brought in was that he was \\"not to talk of his miracles of war.\\"Newcomb 1986 pg. 95 Alfonso and Brancaccio did not get along very well, due in part to Brancaccio's resistance to being seen as a professional musician, a position he viewed as lower-status, more akin to that of a servant than a full member of the court,Newcomb 1986 pg 94 and in part because of Alfonso's impatience with Brancaccio's tendency to brag. While Brancaccio was in the duke's employ he received around 400 scudi per year (in 1582 this was 130 lire per month) as well as a house and horses whenever he wanted or had use for them. During this period Torquato Tasso and Giovanni Battista Guarini wrote poems in Brancaccio's honor. In 1581, he was out of favor with the court, or more specifically the Duke because of his absence in Venice. He returned to the court by October 1581, but it was not to be for very long.Newcomb 1980, 14 In 1583 Brancaccio was fired for insubordination; he refused to sing on the spot for Anne, Duke de Joyeuse.Newcomb 1986 pg. 94 In 1585 he tried to get back in the duke's good graces through a series of letters and with the help of Giovanni Battista Guarini; however, he was unsuccessful. Newcomb describes the personality which comes through in these letters as \\"blustering, proud, preposterous, and rather touching.\\"Newcomb 1980, pg 185 He died in 1586.

He was one of the wealthiest people of his time in Europe. Born before 1463 in Landau in Palatinate, early in his life he started a merchant business in Breslau. In 1483 he settled in Krak√≥w, in Poland. A wealthy merchant and tradesman dealing with spices, metals, timbers, livestock, etc., he opened branch offices of his firm in many towns of Poland, Germany, Russia and Hungary. In 1498, he was elected to the Town's Charter, and in 1514, he was granted citizenship by the King Sigismund I of Poland, who granted him with a noble status. As the king's banker and main purveyor to the royal court, Boner became one of the wealthiest men in Europe of his times. History of the palace in Balice Among other deeds, he was able to recover the royal treasury from the verge of bankruptcy, having strengthened it with roughly 200,000 Red z≈Çoty, an incredible sum for 15th century standards. He bought off the Royal properties for debts, among them the entire area of Spisz (for 12,000 Red z≈Çoty from Jordan of Zakliczyn), the town of O≈õwiƒôcim and Ruthenian salt mines (for 14,000 Red z≈Çoty from Stanis≈Çaw Ko≈õcielski) and a number of royal towns (including Sieradz, Gostynin, Radom, Sochaczew, Piotrk√≥w, Drohobycz, Rabsztyn, G≈Çuch√≥w, Tuchola, Nowy SƒÖcz, Inowroc≈Çaw and others). In 1515, he became the manager of the Wieliczka salt mine, one of the most profitable enterprises of the epoch, from which a large part of the Poland's income was drawn. He also received the castles of Ojc√≥w and Rabsztyn as his private property. History of the castle of Rabsztyn In 1522, he also became the royal governor of Krak√≥w. Among his most notable successes was a division of the treasury between state and royal treasuries, an arrangement that survived until the Partitions of Poland in the late 18th century. He served as financier to the King of Poland, and acted as a representative for handling money paid to buy indulgences in Poland. He was a patron of German and Italian scholars and artists. He died in 1523 in Breslau, during a business trip. He is featured in Jan Matejko's painting Hanging of the Sigismund bell.

In Mozart's own catalogue of his works, this concerto is dated 30 September 1784. The work is orchestrated for solo piano, flute, two oboes, two bassoons, two horns, and strings.  History  For years, historical speculation was that Mozart had written this concerto for Maria Theresa von Paradis, based on a letter written around that time by Leopold Mozart to his daughter Nannerl. However, Hermann Ullrich has discounted this theory, based on the date of entry in Mozart's catalogue and the fact that von Paradis had left Paris at the start of October 1784, which indicated that there was not sufficient time to send von Paradis the concerto for performance. Richard Maunder has countered with the idea that Mozart could still have sent the concerto to Paris and that it would have been forwarded to von Paradis in London, where it was possible that she performed the work in March 1785.  Music  The principal theme of the concerto's first movement, shown here through the opening eight measures of the first violin part. The concerto is in three movements: The slow movement is a theme and variations. Martha Kingdon Ward has commented that the slow movement of this concerto contains one of the \\"most tranquil\\" of Mozart's flute solos, specifically in the G-major variation. M.S. Cole has noted Mozart's use of meter changes in the finale, starting at measure 171, from to in the winds, with the piano following at measure 179. This changing of tempo in rondo finales was contrary to common practice at the time. Joel Galand has performed a Schenkerian analysis of the rondo finale and noted features such as its novel use of II as a remote key. Mozart wrote out two different cadenzas for the first movement. Joseph Swain has performed a Schenkerian analysis of each first-movement cadenza.

Wisniewski (March 21, 1953 in ‚Äì September 11, 2002), was an American writer and illustrator best known for children's books. Early life Wisniewski was born in England, where his father was stationed as a master sergeant in the Air Force. He and his family moved throughout Europe and America when he was a child, following his father's postings. He credits his mother with teaching him to draw in the first grade, which led to his love of reading, starting with Marvel Comics and moving on to Classics Illustrated. He attended the University of Maryland, College Park but could not afford more than one semester, and dropped out to join the Ringling Brothers and Barnum & Bailey Clown College, graduating in 1973 after two months. He worked for several years as a clown with both Ringling and Circus Vargas before moving to Maryland, where he was hired by his future wife, Donna Harris, in 1975 to join the Prince George's Country Puppet Theatre. They married in 1976, six months after meeting, and without going on a single date. In 1980, they started the Clarion Puppet Theatre (later known as the Clarion Shadow Theatre), where he learned to use an X-Acto knife to cut out jointed shadow puppets and background scenery. The Clarion Shadow Theatre toured in schools, theaters and at the Smithsonian. In 1990, they presented Peter and the Wolf at the Kennedy Center. Writing and illustrating career After his children were born, touring was impossible, so he became a full-time illustrator, working for newspapers and magazines on a freelance basis. In 1987, he met the editor Dilys Evans, who reviewed his portfolio and, according to his recollection, said \\"I'm going to give you the names and numbers of four publishers and you can tell them I sent you.\\" He procrastinated until two weeks before he was due to meet with the first publisher in New York, when he came up with the idea for what would become his first children's book in 1989, The Warrior and the Wise Man. Wisniewski sold that book to the first publisher, Lothrop, who published it in 1989, four years after he started work as an illustrator. He developed his cut-paper style over successive books, adding multiple layers for depth and detail to characters and scenes. For the 16 illustrations in one book, he estimated he made 800 to 1,000 cuts. After Golem, Wisniewski turned to lighter fare: \\"I didn't really have another historical epic left in me for a while, because it's such a Sturm-und-Drang kind of story\\". However, his first comic pitches to Clarion were rebuffed, and he returned to Lothrop to publish The Secret Knowledge of Grown-Ups in 1998. Between 1980 and 2002, Donna Wisniewski estimated that David toured 100 schools per year, performing (and later reading from his books). Awards His book Golem, won the 1997 Caldecott Medal. In his acceptance speech, he said of himself: \\"I am a self- taught artist and writer who depends on instincts developed through years of circus and puppet performance to guide a story's structure and look.\\" Selected works *Elfwyn's Saga New York: Lothrop, Lee & Shepard Books, 1990. *Golem.

Couples no longer needed to show grounds for divorce, but instead, just that their relationship had suffered an irreconcilable breakdown. Due to the division of power between the Commonwealth and the Australian states under the Australian Constitution, the Act initially could deal with children born or adopted only within a marriage, it was not until later years that the Family Law Act dealt with matters relating to ex-nuptial children. However, the states referred these powers to the Commonwealth and, until the 2006 amendments to the law, were all located under Chapter VII of the Act. For limitations on recognition of de facto couples inside and outside of Australia see Section 51(xxxvii) of the Australian Constitution. The Act has clearly, over time, been one of the most controversial pieces of Australian legislation and has been subject to numerous changes and amendments since its enactment. A number of amendments have reflected the political climate of the times: centre-left Australian governments, such as those led by the Australian Labor Party, strengthened the relevancy of non financial contribution of the stay-at-home mother in property matters; centre-right governments, such as those led by the Liberal Party of Australia, have furthered the wishes of fathers' groups by extending the rights and responsibilities in negotiating parenting arrangements. The 2006 amendments changed the way matters involving children are dealt with. These included: * a progression towards compulsory mediation (before Court proceedings can be filed, in an effort to ensure matters do not reach litigation), * greater examination of issues involving family violence, child abuse or neglect, * more importance being placed on a child's family and social connections, and * a presumption that parents have equal parental responsibility - NOT equal parenting time. * encouraging both parents to remain meaningfully involved in their children's lives following separation, provided there is no risk of violence or abuse. Divorce The original 1975 Act revolutionised the divorce law of Australia (or, as termed in the law, \\"dissolution of marriage\\") by replacing the previous fault grounds with the single ground of irretrievable breakdown, established by separation and living apart for a period of twelve months. It also reduced the time for a decree nisi for a divorce to take effect from three months to one month. Amendments in 2004 abolished the provisions dealing with \\"decrees nisi\\" or \\"decrees absolute\\" and changed the term dissolution of marriage to divorce. The twelve- month separation requirements remained and the one-month waiting period for a divorce order to take effect remained. =Parenting orders= Part VII of the Act deals with the custody and welfare of children in Australia, regardless of the relationship between the parents. The Part has been amended significantly in 1995, 2006, and 2011. Children's matters are determined on the basis of who the child will 'live with' and 'spend time with' (terms which were formerly labeled 'residence' and 'contact' respectively). Although the term custody often refers to where children live, the concept was abolished in 1995 with the Family Law Reform Act. The concept of custody gave much wider decision making powers to the parent with whom children lived, than either the concept of 'residence' or 'live with'. Since 1995 both parents legally have the same (but not shared) parental responsibility for children, regardless of where and with whom the children live, until and unless a court makes a different order. Each parent has parental responsibility (subject to court orders). Parental responsibility is the ability to make decisions that affect the day-to-day and long term care and welfare of the child, and can include things such as what school they attend and what their name is. The Act does not specify that the person with whom the child is to reside or spend time with must necessarily be their natural parent, and provision is made for anyone 'concerned with the care, welfare or development of the child' to apply to the Court for orders. Who may apply for a parenting order. In all proceedings, the paramount consideration is the 'best interests of the child', and the Court will not make an order that is contrary to these interests. Child's best interests paramount consideration in making a parenting order.. If there is a dispute about parenting matters and the case is placed before a court, then the Court must apply a presumption that it is in the best interests of children that their parents have equal shared parental responsibility for the children. Presumption of equal shared parental responsibility when making parenting orders. In practical terms this means that parents must consult one another about major decisions affecting the care of children (but not day-to-day decisions), whereas without that order parents can make decisions together or without consulting each other. The presumption does not apply in circumstances of family violence or there has been any abuse (including sexual abuse) of a child, a parent or any family member living with the child. There is no presumption of equal time with the child, however, if the presumption of equal shared parental responsibility has not been rebutted, the Court must consider whether it is in the best interests of the child and whether it is reasonably practicable. Judgment Summary [2010 HCASum 4] High Court (3 March 2010). If the decision is made to not allocate equal time in such circumstances, then the Court is required to consider allocating 'substantial and significant' time instead. Court to consider child spending equal time or substantial and significant time with each parent in certain circumstances. Substantial and significant time includes weekends, weekdays, special days and holidays, and in practical terms usually means more than every second weekend. The basis on which who the child lives with and spends time with (and how much time is spent) is determined firstly with reference to the best interests principle. What is in the child's 'best interests' is determined with reference to the primary and secondary considerations found under s.60CC, How a court determines what is in a child's best interests. and it is by reference to these factors that argument proceeds in the Federal Circuit Court and the Family Court of Australia. Full custody (a 'live with' order) will usually be awarded to the parent who is better able to demonstrate that they can meet the child's best interests. =Property orders= Part VIII of the Act deals with the distribution of property after a marriage breakdown, and the Court has broad power under section 79 to order property settlement between parties based on a number of factors regarding 'contribution' and 'future needs'. Because of the limitation of Commonwealth power, until 1 March 2009 the Family Court could adjudicate on a property dispute if it arose out of only a matrimonial relationship. In 2009 the states agreed to refer power to the Commonwealth to include breakup of de facto relationships (including same sex relationships) which was accepted. The changes, passed by the Labor Rudd Government, came into effect on 1 March 2009. Prior to this de facto and same- sex couples did not have the same property rights as married couples under the Act, and so had to rely on their state's de facto relationship legislation. Such claims were often much harder to prove than under the Act, and did not include all the same considerations as under the Act, and could result in a more uneven or diminished distribution of property than would otherwise be possible. It is necessary to bring a property claim before or within 12 months of the divorce occurring or two years of separation for de facto couples, although unlike property proceedings in various other countries, the two usually occur separately. A standard s.79 property adjustment, Alteration of property interests. has 4 steps: :1. Identify the marital assets and ascribe a value to them :The assets which may be distributed under the Act include the totality of the parties' joint and several assets. The amount of property is determined at the date of hearing rather than at the date of divorce, so this can also include property acquired after separation. Superannuation is also a marital asset under s.90MC, but will not be available for distribution until it 'vests'. :2. Look at each party's contributions to the marriage under s.79(4) :This section of the Act contains a list of factors by which the Court can determine who contributed what to the marriage. Broadly, the contributions can be taken as financial in nature (for example, paying off a mortgage) or non-financial in nature (for example, taking care of the children). The party which can demonstrate a larger contribution to the marital relationship will receive a larger proportion of the assets. :3. Look at each party's financial resources and future needs under s.75(2) and adjust accordingly :4 The court then considers whether the proposed distribution is just and equitable :After the parties' contributions have been established, a final adjustment is made according to their individual future needs. These needs can include factors such as an inability to gain employment, the continued care of a child under 18 years of age, and medical expenses. This is often used to account for a party which has not shown a great deal of substantive contributions, but will require money to live on as a result of factors largely outside of its control. More complex questions arise when a party has incurred losses,\\" [2006] Federal Judicial Scholarship 1. or when assets are held by trusts. =Other provisions= Section 120 of the Act abolished the actions for criminal conversation, damages for adultery and enticement of a party to a marriage, but it did not change the law relating to breach of promise. The action for breach of promise has been abolished in South Australia.https://www.lawreform.ie/_fileupload/consultation%20papers/wpBreachofPromise.htm Creation of courts The Family Law Act created the Family Court of Australia, with equal status to the Federal Court of Australia, as a court of record and with both original and appellate jurisdiction. Appeals from the Full Court of the Family Court of Australia (the appellate jurisdiction) are to the High Court of Australia. In 2000, in a somewhat controversial move, the Australian government created the Federal Circuit Court of Australia as a second court to handle matters under the Family Law Act. Appeals from the Federal Circuit Court are to the Family Court of Australia, Appeals to Family Court from Federal Circuit Court and Magistrates Court of Western Australia. but its decisions are not considered inferior to the Family Court. Western Australia has continued to refer its family law matters to the Family Court of Western Australia by virtue of the Family Court Act 1997 (WA). Powers of the court The Family Law Act gives the Court powers to make orders to restrain domestic violence, dispose of matrimonial property (including resources such as superannuation), parental responsibility, the living arrangements of children and financial maintenance for former spouses or children. The Court retains its ability to hand down punitive sanctions in a number of areas where parties do not comply with Court orders. In the most extreme cases, as confirmed by the 2006 Amendments, this can include sentences of imprisonment (up to 12 months), fines, work orders, bonds and the like. In most cases, however, the most effective method of penalising a person is to award legal costs against them. In fact, the 2006 Amendments encourage this to be used as a sanction where people make improper or false allegations about someone else before the Court.  Polygamous marriages  The Family Law Act 1975 recognises that polygamous marriages may be lawfully entered into in countries other than Australia and grants rights under the Act to participants of these polygamous marriages. Polygamous marriages.  Same-sex marriages  The Family Law Act 1975 recognises the need to preserve and protect the institution of marriage as the union between 2 persons, to the exclusion of all others voluntarily entered into for life. Principles to be applied by courts. The Federal Circuit Court of Australia holds jurisdiction to handle the dissolution of same sex marriages (i.e. divorces) through Part VI of the Family Law Act 1975. De facto couples De facto couples are also provided for under the act. Other provisions The default position in family law proceedings is that each party pays his or her own costs. The Act also abolished prison as a penalty for maintenance defaulters and imprisoned those held in contempt of the court. Previous system Though the Commonwealth had the power since federation in 1901 to make laws affecting divorce and related matters such as custody and maintenance, it did not enact such national uniform laws until 1961, when the Matrimonial Causes Act 1961https://www.legislation.gov.au/Details/C1959A00104 came into operation. The Act continued the fault-based system operating under state authority. Under the Commonwealth law a spouse had to establish one of the 14 grounds for divorce set out in the Act, including adultery, desertion, cruelty, habitual drunkenness, imprisonment and insanity.The Matrimonial Causes Act 1959 In reality, the system was very expensive and humiliating for the spouses, necessitating appointment of barristers, often private detectives, collection of evidence, obtaining witness statements, photographs and hotel receipts, etc. Failure to prove a spouse's guilt or wrongdoing would result in a judge refusing to grant a divorce.https://aifs.gov.au/sites/default/files/publication- documents/family_law_and_marriage_breakdown_in_australia.pdf The Matrimonial Causes Act 1961 was replaced by no-fault divorce system of the Family Law Act 1975.

This article is intended to document and discuss historical and contemporary racial and ethnic stereotypes in the medium of mainstream comics. Sociopolitical impact of comics Throughout history, comics have reflected the sociopolitical attitudes of their writers and readers. In America, early comics consisted primarily of short, humorous comic strips printed in newspapers. In the 1930s, comics evolved into longer, action-oriented storylines and transitioned into the comic medium format. It began addressing important contemporary political issues. For example, some have suggested that the Wonder Woman character and title evolved as a vehicle to communicate pro-American attitudes during World War II.Emad, M.C. \\"Reading Wonder Woman‚Äôs Body: Mythologies of Gender & Nation . The Journal of Popular Culture, 2004 (Author notes: Reading Wonder Woman‚Äôs Body: \\"This is a preprint of an article accepted for publication in The Journal of Popular Culture, copyright 2004 Blackwell Publishing.) X-Men creator, Stan Lee has frequently cited the Civil Rights Movement as the inspiration for his mutant team of superheroes, and has translated many of the tensions of majority-minority race politics into the X-Men title. Nonetheless, for many years, comic book characters noticeably lacked racial and ethnic diversity. Comics writer and artist Kev F. Sutherland said \\"...when you look at the shelves and see half the titles on sale are characters like Superman, Batman, Spider-Man - dammit, these characters weren't even allowed to be Jewish like their creators, let alone be black.\\" http://comicsbulletin.com/black-couples-in-comics/ Recognizing the influence of comics on popular culture, some members of ethnic and racial communities have focused their attention on stereotypes within comics, and have begun lobbying to change them. This is accomplished in many ways, frequently by either writing new character of color or \\"trans-racializing\\" existing characters from Whites to racial or ethnic minorities (e.g. the changing of Karate Kid's race from White to Asian). Given the recent popularity of injecting characters of color into popular comic titles, a new concern has arisen regarding possible tokenism, and many writers advocate not just the inclusion of characters of color into predominantly White casts of characters, but that these minority characters defy the racial and ethnic stereotypes so prevalent in the history of comics, as well as maintaining the high standard of comic book writing. Daley Osiyemi, creator of Brodie's Law and co-founder of Pulp Theatre Entertainment said, \\"...we don't just want black characters or superheroes in comics as mere tokens, they have to be strong characters in their own right and have strong stories built around them.\\" In 2007 the scholarly journal MELUS (publication of the Society for the Study of Multi- Ethnic Literature of the United States) devoted an entire issue to the literary and sociological representations of race and ethnicity in comics. The issue was guest edited by Derek Parker Royal, and it included essays on older graphic narratives (such as Jackie Ormes's Torchy Brown and Min√© Okubo's Citizen 13660), more recent graphic novels (Ho Che Anderson's King, Ben Katchor's The Jew of New York, and Mark Kalesniko's Mail Order Bride), as well as various comic book series (Dwayne McDuffie's Deathlok, Adrian Tomine's Optic Nerve, and Los Bros Hernandez's Love and Rockets). Gilbert Hernandez illustrated the cover, and the issue included an interview with him as well. Middle Eastern On the other hand, Jack Shaheen, professor emeritus of mass communications at Southern Illinois University has written extensively on the plight of Arabs in the American mass media. He wrote that due to ignorance, fear, and political beliefs, Arabs are rarely portrayed as anything but villains. Those few positive portrayals are often passive, neither taking the limelight away from the most often Caucasian protagonists, nor overshadowing the active role of the evil Arabs in the book. Examples include Marvel's Fasaud, Apocalypse, Shadow King, Living Monolith, Asp, the Desert Swords, Abdul Alhazred, Saracen, the original Arabian Knight and from DC comics Ra's al Ghul and Talia al Ghul. =The terrorist= As far back as 1953, in an issue of John Wayne Adventure Comics, John Wayne captures an Arab who is attempting to drive American oil companies out by launching a terrorist campaign.Wright, Bradford (2001). Comic Book Nation: The Transformation of Youth Culture in America, Baltimore: Johns Hopkins University Press. Black An early black character to be incorporated into a syndicated comic strip was Lothar, who appeared in Mandrake the Magician in the 1930s. He was Mandrake's sidekick: the circus strongman, who wore a Tarzan-style costume, was drawn in the Sambo-style of the time (see below) and was poor, and uneducated. Since the introduction of Lothar, black characters have received a variety of treatments in comics, and not all of them positive. =Physical caricatures= Early graphic art of all kinds often depicted Black characters in a stylized fashion, emphasizing certain physical features to form a recognizable racial caricature of Black faces. These features often included long unkempt hair, broad noses, enormous red-tinted lips, dark skin and ragged clothing reminiscent of those worn by Black slaves. These characters were also depicted as speaking accented English. In the early 20th century United States, these kinds of representations were seen frequently in newspaper comic strips and political cartoons, as well as in later comic magazines, and were also present in early cartoons by Disney and Looney Tunes. In comics, nameless Black bystanders and even some notable heroes and villains were developed in this style, including The Spirit's sidekick Ebony White (see next section) and Billy Batson's valet Steamboat. Ebony White Writer-artist Will Eisner is sometimes criticized for his depiction of Ebony White, the young African American sidekick of Eisner's 1940s and 1950s character The Spirit. Eisner later admitted to consciously stereotyping the character, but said he tried to do so with \\"responsibility\\", and argued that \\"at the time humor consisted in our society of bad English and physical difference in identity\\".Time.com (Sept. 19, 2003): Will Eisner interview The character developed beyond the stereotype as the series progressed, and Eisner also introduced black characters (such as the plain-speaking Detective Grey) who defied popular stereotypes. In a 1966 New York Herald Tribune feature by his former office manager-turned-journalist, Marilyn Mercer wrote, \\"Ebony never drew criticism from Negro groups (in fact, Eisner was commended by some for using him), perhaps because, although his speech pattern was early Minstrel Show, he himself derived from another literary tradition: he was a combination of Tom Sawyer and Penrod, with a touch of Horatio Alger hero, and color didn't really come into it\\".Mercer, Marilyn, \\"The Only Real Middle-Class Crimefighter\\", New York (Sunday supplement, New York Herald Tribune), Jan. 9, 1966; reprinted Alter Ego #48 (see under References below) =Savages= Critics of the portrayal of early Black characters note the frequency with which Black characters were shown as uncivilized savages, frequently shown with bones in their ears, noses, and hair. Tintin in the Congo The artist Herg√© received much criticism for his first comics. Tintin in the Congo, from 1930, presented the typical colonial view Belgians had about the people in Belgian Congo, including the missionary bringing civilization to the uneducated blacks. According to one reviewer, \\"the Africans are portrayed as primitive, simple-minded folk\\".Amazon editorial review Herg√©, 23 years old at the time, defended himself as being na√Øve instead of intentionally racist. Nevertheless, the album wasn't translated into English until very recently, due to those concerns. =Animals= The historian Ian Gordon, author of Comic Strips and Consumer Culture, 1890-1945, argues that the need for comic strips to appeal to diverse national audiences in the USA meant that the outright racial caricatures of minstrelsy did not translate to the comic strips with any commercial success. Instead artists and writers developed \\"de-raciate\\" Black stereotypes in the form of funny animal characters the first of which Felix the Cat owed his existence directly to the racialized humor of a strip named \\"Sambo and His Funny Noises.\\" Other examples of such characters include Krazy Kat, created by George Herriman who was biracial, and Mickey Mouse.Gordon, Ian. Comic Strips and Consumer Culture, 1890-1945. (Smithsonian Institution Scholarly Press 2002) =Blaxploitation era= In the late-1960s and throughout the 1970s, several African-American heroes were created in the vein of Blaxploitation-era movie protagonists, and seemed to be a direct response to the notable Black Nationalist movement. These (predominantly male) heroes were often martial artists, came from the ghetto, and were politically motivated. They were frequently pitted against White villains, representing the Black struggle against 'The Man': a catch-all phrase popularized during the Civil Rights Movement to represent the White power structure. However, as much as the Blaxploitation era superheroes contrasted earlier racial caricatures of Blacks in comics, one attribute remained common: hypersexuality; many Blaxploitation heroes were still highly masculinized, reminiscent of the Mandingo stereotype, and were frequently seen sexually dominating White female characters. Examples of such Blaxploitation characters include Luke Cage, Misty Knight, Bronze Tiger and Black Lightning.Griffin, Rupert. Fanzing 32, March 2001: Black Power or Blaxploitation? Accessed June 29, 2006Singer, Marc. \\"Black Skins\\" and White Masks: Comic books and the secret of race (African American Review 2002) =Black proteges= In the 1970s, several African American heroes were created and paired with established white heroes as sidekicks and black proteges. Black Goliath, for example, became a black and slightly inferior (in terms of scientific ability and combat experience) version of his white mentor. Asian =Yellow Peril= Many Asian characters were pitted against White American protagonists in early American comics, capturing America's real-world frustrations and political distrust of foreign Asian powers. Symbolizing America's \\"phobia of the \\"Yellow Peril\\",Ma, Sheng-Mei. The Deathly Embrace: Orientalism and Asian American Identity, (University of Minnesota Press, 2000) these characters were frequently of foreign nationality (usually Chinese) and often possessed a stereotypically Asian appearance (for example, a long wispy moustache and yellow-tinted skin). They were often highly intelligent or in possession of a powerful, supernatural ability and generally occupied themselves with elaborate plans for world domination, although they were usually thwarted by the American heroes of their time. While usually serious threats, one somewhat humorous Yellow Peril villain was DC's Egg Fu, a giant Communist egg with facial features and a prehensile moustache. Fu Manchu In the early 20th century, author Sax Rohmer published a series of novels focusing on the wildly popular Chinese villain, Dr. Fu Manchu. Attempting to capitalize on this success, DC Comics and Marvel Comics both published comic books featuring Chinese villains physically resembling Fu Manchu and possessing the same personality, sexual ambiguity, and ambitions for world domination. Because neither publisher possessed a license for the Fu Manchu character, these early Chinese comic book villains were either unnamed or had a different name than Fu Manchu. Examples include DC's Red Dragon and Marvel's Yellow Claw and The Mandarin. In 1938, DC Comics obtained the license for Sax Rohmer's character, and subsequent titles featured Fu Manchu as a recurring villain . Marvel Comics obtained the rights for Fu Manchu in 1972, and he was notably introduced as the father of Marvel's Shang-Chi, protagonist of the Master of Kung Fu title. Although both DC and Marvel have since declined to renew their license for the Fu Manchu character, Fu Manchu has made brief appearances in modern comics, As the result of Marvel Comics later losing the rights to the Fu Manchu name, his later appearances give him the real name of Zheng Zu, usually referred to merely as 'The Doctor' (as in Alan Moore's League of Extraordinary Gentlemen). =Coolie= Several early characters of Asian descent were introduced as the clumsy, foolish and bumbling sidekicks of White male superheroes. These characters were frequently caricatures of the Chinese coolie, appearing short in stature, sporting bucked teeth and a queue, and spoke pidgin English. These characters often served as comedy relief or as a convenient hostage for the villain of the day. Examples of such characters include the controversial Chop-Chop (aka Wu Cheng) of DC's Blackhawk team (see below) and Wing-How., sidekick of the Crimson Avenger. Chop-Chop Chop- Chop was the youngest member of the Blackhawk team created by Will Eisner, Chuck Cuidera, and Bob Powell for Quality Comics during World War II. Resembling other Chinese caricatures typical of the era, Chop-Chop was short with bright yellow skin, bucked teeth, and a queue.Zimmerman, Carla B. \\"From Chop-Chop to Wu Cheng: The Evolution of the Chinese Character in Blackhawk Comic Books,\\" in Ethnic Images in the Comics, edited by Charles Hardy and Gail F. Stern (The Balch Institute for Ethnic Studies,1986) pp. 37‚Äì42. His primary role seemed to be as the chef of the Blackhawk team. Strangely, Chop-Chop was also the only member of the Blackhawks who did not wear a Blackhawk uniform; instead, he wore traditional Chinese shirt and pants. Many members of the Asian American community found the character of Chop-Chop to be highly controversial and offensive. Addressing the disparity of Asian American characters in the comic industry and the stereotypical images of early characters, noted Asian American comics writer Larry Hama said, \\"Many companies were still coloring Asians bright yellow... In the '40s and '50s, the character Chop Chop in the 'Blackhawks' had big buck teeth, a long pigtail and lots of cleavers. It wasn't until sometime in the '60s that he evolved into a short slim guy who was a jaundiced shade of orange.\\"SFGate.com (June 1, 2006): Asian pop (archived) The event to which Hama refers occurred in Blackhawk #197 (June 1964). That issue began the \\"New Blackhawks\\", an attempt to modernize the team that included new uniforms. Chop-Chop got a uniform and his own aircraft (he had nearly always ridden with Blackhawk or one of the other team members prior to this time). Chop-Chop was treated and portrayed as a full member of the team from this point on but certain stereotypical factors were still in play. Like most Asian comic book heroes, he was now a martial arts expert. This was emphasized even more when the Blackhawks tried being super-powered heroes in issues #228 (January 1967) to #241 (Jun-Jul 1968). In that run of stories, Chop-Chop was known as \\"Dr. Hands.\\" In the next revival of the Blackhawks (with issue #244, Jan-Feb 1976), Chop-Chop got a new name, Chopper, and was treated pretty much like all the other members of the team. He was no longer an ethnic caricature and the decades of his portrayal as one were simply ignored as if they had never happened. It took a third revival of the title in 1982 (Blackhawk #251) to finally address that issue. Writer Mark Evanier and artist Dan Spiegle avoided all the racial and ethnic stereotypes that had previously defined Chop-Chop‚Äôs character except one. They put him back in the coolie outfit that the character had worn for a large part of his existence. This was a deliberate move so they could examine why Chop-Chop was not treated like a full member of the team in a story titled \\"What‚Äôs the Matter with Chop-Chop?\\" (#265, December 1983). The story has the other Blackhawks examine their attitudes and feelings and, at the end, Wu Cheng gets respect and a uniform. Howard Chaykin's 1987 Blackhawk limited series explains the earlier stereotypical representations as a comic-book-within-a-comic-book and the Chop-Chop of that team expresses indignation toward them. =Martial arts master= Nearly all Asian characters in mainstream American comics are capable of martial arts, and for several Asian characters, this is their only skill or ability. An overwhelming number of Asian characters, particularly those of Japanese descent, are portrayed as masters of ninjutsu or the ways of the samurai, and are frequently introduced as teachers of non-Asian protagonists. Examples include Marvel's Shang-Chi, Colleen Wing, Psylocke although she is actually British in an Asian body, Silver Samurai, DC's Katana, Lady Shiva, and Cassandra Cain. Frequently, martial arts masters are associated with Asian religions, such as Buddhism, and a common archetype is that of the elderly, wise monk. =Dragon lady= Female Asian characters in comics are frequently depicted as hypersexualized, cold-blooded and untrustworthy, in a racial caricature frequently referred to as the dragon lady.Prasso, Sheridan. The Asian Mystique: Dragon Ladies, Geisha Girls, & Our Fantasies of the Exotic Orient (2005 Public Affairs) This stereotype references the popular villainess of the same name who first appeared in the vintage comic strip, Terry and the Pirates,Restrictive Portrayals of Asians in the Media and How to Balance Them ,Prasso, Sheridan 2005 and was later popularized in film by roles such as that of Anna May Wong's title character in the film, Daughter of the Dragon. In comics, examples of the dragon lady stereotype include Marvel's Fah Lo Suee (see below), the daughter of Fu Manchu.Restrictive Portrayals of Asians in the Media and How to Balance Them Fah Lo Suee Fah Lo Suee was a character in Sax Rohmer's series of pulp novels featuring Dr. Fu Manchu. Fah Lo Suee's name meant \\"Sweet Perfume\\", and she was Fu Manchu's daughter. In Marvel Comics, Fah Lo Suee was Shang-Chi's sister, and a hypersexualized temptress with the power of hypnosis. Her loyalties lay only with her own ambitions, and she was willing to turn on anyone, including her own father, if it would benefit her. She eventually joined the Secret Intelligence Service (MI6), a top-secret British intelligence agency, where she became a high-ranking official, although she did this only in further pursuit of power for herself. As the result of Marvel Comics later losing the rights to the Fu Manchu, she is currently known as Zheng Bao Yu / Cursed Lotus.

It was awarded both the Orange Prize for Fiction and PEN/Faulkner Award for Fiction. It was placed on several top book lists, including Amazon's Best Books of the Year (2001). It was also adapted into an opera in 2015.

Retrieved June 16, 2007. the novel follows the relationships among a group of young terrorists and their hostages, who are mostly high-profile executives and politicians, over several months. Many of the characters form unbreakable bonds of friendship, while some fall in love. Opera is a centralizing theme on many levels throughout the story; the operatic term bel canto literally means \\"beautiful singing.\\" Plot summary Set in an unspecified South American country, the story begins at a birthday party thrown at the country's vice presidential home in honor of Katsumi Hosokawa, the visiting chairman of a large Japanese company and opera enthusiast. As a not-so-subtle pretext to get Hosokawa to invest in the country, famous American soprano Roxane Coss is scheduled to perform as the highlight of the party. Near the end of the party, members of a terrorist organization break into the house, intending to take the President of the country hostage. When they realize the President is not in attendance, the terrorist group decides to take the entire party hostage. After determining they have too many hostages, the terrorists decide to release all of the hostages except those they deem most likely to return a large ransom. Two major romantic relationships develop as the standoff drags on and serve as the backdrop to the rest of the story. The first is between Coss and Hosokawa, who develop a deep bond even though they do not speak each other's language and thus cannot communicate verbally. The second relationship is between the translator Gen and the young terrorist Carmen, who must keep their love a secret. The two lovers meet in the china closet every night. At the end of the novel, the government breaks into the house and kills all the terrorists. All of the hostages are freed except for Hosokawa, who dies in the struggle. In an epilogue that takes place some years later, former hostages Simon Thibault and his wife meet with Gen and Roxane, who are getting married in Italy. Characters Katsumi Hosokawa is a Japanese business mogul, who is married with two daughters. He has a strong bond with his young translator Gen. He doesn't speak Spanish and must use Gen for all communication in the host country. Since attending a performance with his father as a child, opera has been his greatest love, and he is passionate about the soprano Roxane Coss, having heard her recordings. He falls in love with the woman herself during their time together. However, he knows their relationship can only last for the duration of the standoff. He is gunned down in the final scenes by the soldiers of the host country, in his attempt to save the teenaged terrorist Carmen. Roxane Coss is an internationally renowned American soprano. At first a prima donna who sets herself apart from the rest of the guests, she eventually begins to bond with the others when she receives a box of musical scores and begins singing to them every morning. She is especially touched by her relationships with Mr. Hosokawa, with whom she falls in love; Gen, with whom she forms a strong bond and eventually marries; Carmen, who sleeps in her bed, braids her hair, and comforts her; and Cesar, another young terrorist with a gifted singing voice whom she begins tutoring. Gen Watanabe is Mr. Hosokawa's translator and assistant. He is a quiet, sensitive and gifted young man who speaks several languages. As the translator, he is usually at the center of the action of the novel, although he is the only hostage, besides a priest, who is not fabulously wealthy and powerful. He begins tutoring Carmen when she asks him to teach her how to read and write in Spanish and English, and they begin meeting each night in the china closet to study and eventually make love. General Benjamin is the most intelligent and thoughtful of the three generals who lead the terrorists. Benjamin was a schoolteacher until his brother was arrested and imprisoned for handing out flyers publicizing a political protest. After that, he joined the terrorist group La Familia de Martin Suarez, named after a ten-year-old boy who was shot dead while handing out flyers for a political rally. Benjamin has left behind a wife and children, and he is fatherly to some of the young terrorists under his command. He is plagued with shingles, which rage across much of his face. Joachim Messner is a Swiss representative for the Red Cross. who negotiates between the government and the terrorists. He is the one person allowed to come and go from the mansion. Messner punctuates the general happiness with frequent reminders that the situation will end badly. Carmen is the terrorist whom Gen loves. Carmen remains incognito in the guise of a male terrorist for the first part of the novel. The leader of the organization, General Benjamin, notices what a beautiful young woman she has become and notes that, \\"had she been this pretty before, he never would have let her sign up.\\" She often prays to Saint Rose of Lima. In the ultimate shootout, she is gunned down before Gen can get to her. In the ensuing newspaper articles, there is no record of her ever existing. Simon Thibault is the French ambassador to the South American country where the novel is set. Because he longs for his wife Edith, who is released early with the rest of the women and children, Thibault is the hostage who is most unhappy during the long standoff. He spends much of his time cooking for both the hostages and the terrorists, and he is almost always wearing Edith's scarf. He and Edith are reunited after the standoff, and they are the witnesses to the marriage of Gen and Roxane in the final chapter. Creative process Patchett was inspired by the Lima Crisis as she watched the events unfold on the news and thought how operatic the crisis was. Patchett was an opera novice prior to writing the book, although she has stated that the character Roxane was modeled on Karol Bennett, an acquaintance of hers who was an opera singer. Since she was not familiar with Bennett's voice, she listened to recordings by the famous American soprano Ren√©e Fleming and imagined Roxane Coss as possessing Fleming's voice. (Patchett and Fleming became friends only after the novel was published.) The original working title was How to Fall in Love with Opera, but her editor advised against it in case bookstores would mis-shelve it in their \\"how to\\" section.von Rhein, John (November 24, 2015). \\"Lyric Opera's Bel Canto ripped from the heart, not the headlines\\". Chicago Tribune. Retrieved December 6, 2015. The manuscript originally contained a prologue from Gen's perspective, establishing the book as a story about how he met his wife. However, Patchett's mentor Elizabeth McCracken told her that the prologue was not needed, so Patchett cut it. Patchett has stated that she always wanted to write with an omniscient third person narrator that \\"moves from person to person within a room\\"‚Äîa style she calls \\"Anna Karenina-third.\\" Her first two novels were in first-person and her third novel was in third-person, but it was limited to one character's perspective. She was pleased when she was able to write in this style for Bel Canto, deeming her achievement of the style a progression in her writing. Reception Sue MacGregor, the broadcaster and chairman of the Orange Prize judges, praised the work, saying, \\"This is a fine piece of writing, mixing tenderness and danger to an impressive degree.\\" Critic Alex Clark praised the wide range of Patchett's writing, which \\"encompass[es] both lightning flashes of brutality and terror and long stretches of incarcerated ennui.\\"Clark, Alex (July 14, 2001).

Canine sexual anatomy and development =General= In domestic dogs, sexual maturity (puberty) occurs between the ages of 6 to 12 months for both males and females, although this can be delayed until up to two years of age for some large breeds. Pregnancy is possible as soon as the first estrus cycle, but breeding is not recommended prior to the second cycle.5361/the_normal_canine.htm, Dr B Eilts, Louisiana State University School of Veterinary Medicine, \\"Normal Canine Reproduction\\" retrieved 10 April 2013 As with other domesticated species, domestication has selectively bred for higher libido, and earlier and more frequent breeding cycles in dogs than in their ancestors. The reproductive cycle =Female cycle= The average length of the reproductive cycle for females is 2‚Äì4 weeks. Females reach sexual maturity (puberty) between 8 and 18 months of age. There is a tremendous variability in the maturation age between breeds, and even within a breed of dog. , Dr B Eilts, LSU Veterinary Medicine, \\"The Normal Canine Estrous Cycle\\" retrieved 10 April 2013. 1\\\\. Proestrus, in which eggs in the ovaries begin to mature and estrogen levels begin to rise, is the first stage of the reproductive cycle. During this stage females, though non- receptive, attract males. Initial changes include swelling of the vulva lips, which become pliable, small amounts of bloody vaginal discharge, frequent urination, and signs of restlessness. Proestrus generally lasts nine days. 2\\\\. Estrus follows, in which estrogen levels are high, mature eggs are released from both ovaries, and females become receptive both physically and mentally to copulation. Only during estrus will copulation result in pregnancy. During proestrus and estrus, females may have a clear, blood tinged, or bloody discharge. Dogs during these stages are often informally referred to as being in heat. The length of these cycles varies greatly among breeds and even between individuals of the same breed. Proestrus and estrus can last anywhere from 5 days to 21 days. 3\\\\. Diestrus is the period following mating. Diestrus lasts approximately 56 to 60 days in a pregnant female, and 60 to 100 days in a non-pregnant female. During both of these periods, progesterone levels are high. Because the hormonal profile of a pregnant female and a female in diestrus are the same, sometimes a non-pregnant female will go through a period of pseudo-pregnancy. At that time she may gain weight, have mammary gland development, produce milk, and exhibit nesting behaviours. 4\\\\. Anestrus is the remaining period, the time of reproductive quiescence. The female has no attraction to mating. Anestrus generally lasts four to five months. Copulation Wolves mating, Tama zoo As with most tetrapods, canine copulation involves the male mounting the female from behind, a position that is colloquially referred to as \\"doggy style\\" but does not have a specifically known origin. When a male canine is interested in mounting a female, he will sniff the female's vulva. If the female is unreceptive, she may sit, lie down, snap, retreat, or otherwise be uncooperative. If the female is receptive, she will stand still and hold her tail to the side, a stance referred to as \\"flagging\\". The male will often continue examining the female's rear, before mounting her from behind while attempting penetration with his penis. At the time of penetration, the canine penis is not erect, and only able to penetrate the female because it includes a narrow bone called the \\"baculum\\", a feature of most placental mammals. When the male achieves penetration, he will usually hold the female tighter and thrust deeply. It is during this time that the male's penis expands and it is important that the bulbus gland is sufficiently far inside for the female to be able to trap it. Unlike human sexual intercourse, where the male penis commonly becomes erect before entering the female, canine copulation involves the male first penetrating the female, after which swelling of the penis to erection occurs, which usually happens rapidly. Knotting Male canines are the only animals that have a locking bulbus glandis or \\"bulb\\", a spherical area of erectile tissue at the base of the penis. During copulation, and only after the male's penis is fully inside the female's vagina, the bulbus glandis becomes engorged with blood. In coyotes, when the female's vagina subsequently contracts, the penis becomes locked inside the female. This is known as \\"tying\\" or \\"knotting\\". While characteristic of mating in most canids, the copulatory tie has been reported to be absent or very brief (less than one minute) in the African wild dog, possibly due to the abundance of large predators in its environment. When the penis is locked into the vagina by the bulbus glandis (when the stud is \\"tied\\"), thrusting behavior stops and the male will usually lift a leg and swing it over the female's back while turning around. The two stand with their hind ends touching and the penis locked inside the vagina while ejaculation occurs, decreasing leakage of semen from the vagina.Social Behaviour In AnimalsBiological Exuberance: Animal Homosexuality and Natural DiversityThe Illustrated Encyclopedia of North American Mammals After some time, typically between 5 and 20 minutes (but sometimes longer), the bulbus glandis disengorges, allowing the mates to separate. Virgin dogs can become quite distressed at finding themselves unable to separate during their first copulation, and may try to pull away or run. Dog breeders often suggest it is appropriate for handlers to attempt to calm the mating dogs if they show anxiety once this stage is reached. After mating, the male usually licks his penis and prepuce. Gestation and litters mongrel A feral dog from Sri Lanka nursing her puppies Gestation in a dog is 63 days in length, if measured from the day of ovulation. Since it is difficult to determine the exact date of ovulation, errors are often made in calculating gestation period., Dr B Eilts, Louisiana State University Veterinary Medicine, \\"Canine Pregnancy\\" retrieved 10 April 2013. Canine sperm can live for 10 to 11 days in the uterine tubes (fallopian tubes) so if a female is bred 10 days before the oocytes (eggs) can be fertilized, she will appear to have a gestation length of 70 days. If she is bred on the day the oocytes can be fertilized, her gestation length will appear to be 60 days long. A rule of thumb is that a mammal will produce half as many offspring as the number of teats on the mother. This rule is altered in domesticated animals since larger litters are often favoured for economic reasons and in dogs, particularly, the great range of sizes and shapes plays a role in how many healthy puppies a female can carry. A female dog usually has 10 teats, though this does not mean she can necessarily provide sufficient nutrition for 10 puppies in one litter. An average litter consists of about five to six puppies, though this number may vary widely based on the breed of dog. Size of the breed is correlated with litter size. Miniature and small breeds average three to four puppies in each litter, with a maximum litter size of about 5‚Äì8. Large and giant breeds average 7 puppies per litter but can have a maximum litter size of about 15. In one study, the Rhodesian Ridgeback had the highest average litter size with 8.9 pups per litter while the Pomeranian and Toy Poodle had the lowest with 2.4 pups per litter. The number of puppies also varies with the mother's age. In smaller breeds, both young and old age are associated with smaller litter size. In larger breeds, only old age is associated with smaller litter size. Use of artificial insemination is also associated with smaller litter size, with frozen semen having a stronger effect than fresh semen. The largest litter size to date was set by a Neapolitan Mastiff in Manea, England on November 29, 2004; the litter was 24 puppies. Some breeds have been developed to emphasize certain physical traits beyond the point at which they can safely bear litters on their own. A large scale study in Norway showed that across all breeds, about 4% of pups will be stillborn and a further 4% will die within the first week (early neonatal mortality). Between 8 days and 8 weeks, 1% will die. Litter size, breed size and age of the female is associated with increased risk. High risk breeds for stillborn includes the Dogue de Bordeaux (14.2%), St. Bernard (12.3%), Chow Chow (12.1%), Pembroke Welsh Corgis (11.7%) and Dalmatian (10.6%). The Basenji, Italian Greyhound, Australian Terrier, Irish Soft Coated Wheaten Terrier and the Bichon Havanais had few to no stillborns (0-0.6%). High risk breeds for early neonatal mortality includes the Rhodesian Ridgeback (11.6%), Dogue de Bordeaux (10.4% ), Dalmatians (8.8%) and Icelandic Sheepdog (8.7%) while the Basenji and Tibetan Terrier had no early neonatal mortality and the Border Terrier and Danish-Swedish Farmdog had <1% early neonatal mortality. Common causes of early neonatal mortality are bacteria infection, fetal asphyxia and fading puppy syndrome. Other causes may include elective euthanasia because of congenital defects or failure to meet breed standards. Other multi-breed studies have put stillborn rates at 6.5-7% and early neonatal mortality at 11.5-19.8%. =Inbreeding depression= On the basis of an analysis of data on 42,855 dachshund litters, it was found that as the inbreeding coefficient increased, litter size decreased and the percentage of stillborn puppies increased, thus indicating inbreeding depression. Inbreeding depression is a reduction in progeny fitness due largely to the homozygous expression of deleterious recessive mutations. =Inbreeding avoidance= Because the African wild dog (Lycaon pictus) largely exists in fragmented small populations, its existence is endangered. Inbreeding avoidance via mate selection is characteristic of the species and has important potential consequences for population persistence. Inbreeding is rare within natal packs. Computer-population simulations indicate that all populations continuing to avoid incestuous mating will become extinct within 100 years due to the unavailability of unrelated mates. Thus the impact of reduced numbers of suitable unrelated mates will likely have a severe demographic impact on the future viability of small wild dog populations. Red wolves primarily live in packs composed of a socially monogamous breeding pair and offspring of different ages. Using long-term data on red wolf individuals of known pedigree, it was found that inbreeding among first-degree relatives was rare. A likely mechanism for avoidance of inbreeding is independent dispersal trajectories from the natal pack. Many of the young wolves spend time alone or in small non-breeding packs composed of unrelated individuals. The union of two unrelated individuals in a new home range is the predominant pattern of breeding pair formation. Among Ethiopian wolves, most females disperse from their natal pack at about two years of age, and some become \\"floaters\\" that may successfully immigrate into existing packs. Breeding pairs are most often unrelated to each other, suggesting that female-biased dispersal reduces inbreeding. Grey wolves and Arctic foxes also exhibit inbreeding avoidance. Inbreeding is ordinarily avoided because it leads to a reduction in progeny fitness (inbreeding depression) due largely to the homozygous expression of deleterious recessive alleles. Cross-fertilization between unrelated individuals ordinarily leads to the masking of deleterious recessive alleles in progeny.Michod, R.E. (1994). \\"Eros and Evolution: A Natural Philosophy of Sex\\" Addison-Wesley Publishing Company, Reading, Massachusetts. Clinical issues Female dogs are at risk for endometritis and pyometra in the postpartum period and after estrus or vaginitis. Signs and symptoms include fever, lethargy, loss of appetite, excessive thirst, restlessness, a foul smelling vaginal discharge which may or may not be bloody, infertility, or they may be asymptomatic. Uterine infections should be treated expeditiously if suspected. Contrary to common belief, uterine infections can strike any intact female, whether she has been bred or not, and whether it is her first season or not although it is more common as dogs become older. Dog breeding These littermates were born to an Australian Shepherd mother who had roamed free, suggesting different fathers. =Semen collection= An artificial vagina is prepared, which is a conical thin latex sleeve ending in a sterile collection tube. The inside of the latex sleeve is lightly lubricated. The male is allowed to sniff a female in estrus. Experienced studs cooperate readily in the process. New studs often require encouragement in the form of manual stimulation. Generally the male will mount the female, and the collector quickly directs the male's penis into the latex sleeve. The male ejaculates and the semen is collected in the tube. The semen is then drawn up into a long thin pipette. Cross breeding Designer breed dogs are Mixed-breed dogs that are intentionally bred from parents of two established breeds. Studies have shown that cross-bred dogs have a number of desirable reproductive traits. Scott and Fuller found that cross-bred dogs were superior mothers compared to purebred mothers, producing more milk and giving better care. These advantages led to a decreased mortality in the offspring of cross-bred dogs; however, the qualities of cross bred dogs are not predictable. For example, Labrador x Poodle (\\"Labradoodle\\") can inherit the coat of either a Labrador, a poodle, or a remix. Spaying and neutering Spaying (females) and neutering (males) refers to the sterilization of animals‚Äîusually by castration (removal of the male's testicles) or ovariohysterectomy (removal of the female's ovaries and uterus)‚Äîto eliminate the ability to procreate, and reduce sex drive. Castration has also been known to reduce aggression in male dogs (in some cases), but spaying has been shown to occasionally increase aggression in female dogs. Animal control agencies in the United States and the ASPCA advise that dogs not intended for further breeding should be spayed or neutered so that they do not have undesired puppies. Spaying and castrating can decrease the risk of hormone-driven diseases such as mammary cancer, as well as undesired hormone-driven behaviors. However, certain medical problems are more likely after neutering, such as urinary incontinence in females and prostate cancer in males. Dogs shown in the conformation ring are not allowed to be either neutered or spayed. It disqualifies them from being shown as they must be intact and unaltered. Female cats and dogs are seven times more likely to develop mammary tumors if they are not spayed before their first heat cycle. StudiesThe Negative Aspects of NeuteringGolden retriever study suggests neutering affects dog health have shown that spaying or neutering may be associated with serious health and behavioural consequences: Altered Females: Increased aggression can be shown in altered females if they have previously displayed aggression prior to surgical alteration. In a study by O'Farrell and Peachy, female dogs less than 11 months of age that had previously shown signs of aggression are more likely to have an increase in aggression after being spayed. These increases in aggression may be due to the sudden change in hormone concentrations that are the result of alteration. While spaying female dogs does not \\"induce\\" aggression, it can increase aggression and facilitate indiscriminate appetite in young altered females and can include them rapidly eating meals or eating food-associated items such as trash. Altered males: In nearly 2/3 of the cases that involve inter-dog aggression, castration can help decrease aggression. Castration also decreases other male-typical behavioral traits such as mounting, roaming, and urine marking. But a few studies have shown that male behavioral issues of mounting, roaming and urine marking still exist in altered males. Some people have reported after altering their male dogs that behavior such as roaming, mounting and urine marking has not changed the behavior. Aggression may increase, as the decrease in testosterone may lead to emotional issues and become more likely to react aggressively when feeling under threat. Male puppies that are neutered between 7 and 10 weeks are three times less likely to display behavioral problems, compared to canines neutered at 6 months or older. Most dominantly aggressive dogs are male, which causes many people to neuter their male canine companions. Removing testosterone can decrease the intensity of a canine's reaction to stimulus. Testosterone does not cause a behavior to occur, but its absence may decrease the occurrence of a \\"bad\\" behavior.

History The Palawan State University, the first state university in Palawan and in Region IV, traces its humble beginnings to the teacher training institution known as Palawan Teacher‚Äôs College (PTC), which was established through Republic Act 4303 on March 2, 1965. Then Congressman Gaudencio Abordo sponsored the bill establishing the college at the then municipality of Puerto Princesa. The creation of PTC was in response to the need of additional teachers in the province since most of the available educators at that time came from Luzon; and only a handful were willing to be assigned in far-flung areas of the province. Funded by an initial half-a-million pesos, the university opened night classes to 101 students under the tutelage of 10 faculty members, and 16 support staff, using four borrowed classrooms from state-funded Palawan National High School. Its first president was Dr. Walfrido Ponce de Leon, and five different presidents since. The early days of the institution as a teacher‚Äôs College saw its thrust focused solely on education degree. Years later however, the school added new curriculum to address the province's other educational needs. In 1984, then Minister of Natural Resources Teodoro Pe√±a sponsored the transition of Palawan Teacher‚Äôs College to Palawan State College by virtue of Batas Pambansa Blg. 797, allowing for the university to offer courses in the Art, Sciences and Technology. Dr. Heracleo Lagrada succeeded Dr. Ponce de Leon as president in 1985 and a year later succeeded by Prof. Paterno Bruselas. In 1991, Dr. Teresita Salva became its fourth president, with the institution championing the cause of being the ‚ÄúPlace for Social Change.‚Äù After her term, Dr. Salva would return for another tenure in 1999 until her retirement in 2011. Under Salva's administration, PSE established its law school, supervised by it first dean, Atty. Teodoro Pe√±a. It was also under the stewardship of Dr. Salva that effort to have Palawan State College be conferred the university status. It was however only on November 12, 1994, under the stewardship of PSU's fifth president Dr. Crispiniano Acosta, that Palawan State College was elevated into a university by virtue of R.A. 7818, sponsored by congressman Alfredo Abueg, Jr. and David Ponce de Leon. PSU in 1995, then offered 11 new academic programs ‚Äì Bachelor of Science in Tourism, Marine Biology, Environmental Science, Computer Science, Agri-Business and Hotel and Restaurant Management, four diploma courses, and the first Petroleum Engineering course in the Philippines. In 1999, Salva returned as university president. Presently, PSU is under the stewardship of its president Dr. Marissa S. Pontillas succeeding Dr. Jeter Sespe√±e. Campuses Palawan State University (PSU) has two major campuses: the Manalo Campus, where the Laboratory Elementary School, Graduate School and School of Law are, and the Main Campus in Tiniguiban Heights, which houses the administration building, the colleges, the Laboratory High School, and the physical plant offices. In addition, a number of extramural studies and programs are being offered in the Palawan State University's College of Community Resources and Development (CCRD) in rural campuses of Rizal, Narra, Quezon, Araceli, Brooke's Point, San Vicente, Cuyo, Coron, Balabac, Roxas, Taytay, El Nido, Linapacan, San Rafael, Sofronio Espa√±ola, Dumaran and Bataraza. Expanded Tertiary Education Equivalency and Accreditation Program In response to the call of time, Palawan State University opened another avenue of learning for non-degree holders but currently working in the different offices and industries who may want to finish their degrees without moving out of their work area. During the 365th meeting of the Board of the Commission on Higher Education held last December 13, 2010, in Manila through CEB Resolution No. 328-2010, the commission approved the University‚Äôs application for the deputation to offer Bachelor of Science in Business Administration and Bachelor of Science in Petroleum Engineering effective January 2011 until January 2016 via Expanded Tertiary Education Equivalency and Accreditation Program (ETEEAP). Expanded Tertiary Education Equivalency and Accreditation Program (ETEEAP) is a comprehensive educational assessment program which recognizes knowledge, skills, attitudes and values obtained by individuals from formal, non-formal and informal education and training and related work experiences. MEDICAL EDUCATION: On 19 August 2013 Palawan State University signed a Memorandum of Agreement with the Government of the Province of Palawan for the establishment of a Graduate School of Medical Sciences and for training of Medical Doctors, construction of a District Hospital in the premises of PSU and Scholarships / free education for residents of Palawan Province. Palawan State University has been training nurses and is affiliated to three hospitals in Puerto Princesa for training of nurses and doctors. The Provincial Government of Palawan will fund the establishment of a new District Hospital in the campus of Palawan State University.

Aziz was the leading general who commanded the Northern Command against the Indian Army in the 1999 Kargil War, and was one of four army generals who helped to initiate the military turnover of the civilian government of Prime minister Nawaz Sharif, also in 1999.'New Vice Chief and CJCSC' Biography Muhammad Aziz Khan was born in Pallandri, Sudhanoti, Jammu and Kashmir in British India (Azad Kashmir, Pakistan) on 1 January 1947. He belonged to elite Sudhan family, one of the Sadozai Pashtun tribe. He first graduating from the High School Palandri, before joining the joined the Pakistan Army in 1964. He first completed his combat duty with the army during the second war with India in 1965, before being redirected to join the Pakistan Military Academy (PMA). In 1966, Aziz passed out from the PMA Kakul with the class of 1st War Course, which is senior to 37th PMA but junior to 38th PMA Long Course, gaining commissioned as 2nd-Lt. in the 12th Battalion of the Punjab Regiment. He went to command an infantry platoon during the third war with India in 1971, and was later sent to attend the Command and Staff College where he qualified as a psc. He later went to attend the National Defence University where he graduated with MSc in War studies. In 1980s, Lt-Col. Aziz commanded the 12th Battalion before joining the Zia administration's staff. In 1980s, Colonel Aziz was selected to be appointed as Military Secretary (Mil Secy) to President Zia-ul-Haq, assisting him when President Zia paid state visit to the United States to meet with U.S. President Ronald Reagan. He was later posted as military attach√© at the Pakistan Embassy in Washington D.C. for the United States Army to maintain military relations with the U.S. military. In 1990, Brigadier Aziz was posted as the Chief of Staff of the X Corps which was under Lt-Gen. G.M. Malik before being stationed in Siachen to command the Northern Light Infantry (NLI). In 1991‚Äì94, Brig. Aziz eventually moved to command the 80th Brigade attached to the Northern Command stationed in the Azad Kashmir. War and Command appointments in the military =Chief of General Staff and Kargil war with India= Kargil region in 1999: Lt-Gen. Aziz was the leading general in masterminding the area contingency plans for the Norther Command to infiltrate the Indian Kashmir. In 1994, Brig. Aziz was promoted as two-star rank when he posted as the GOC of the Force Command North based in Gilgit-Baltistan in Pakistan. Maj-Gen. Aziz served as the GOC of the Northern Command until 1996 when he was promoted to the three-star rank, leaving the command of Maj-Gen. Javed Hassan. In 1996, Lieutenant-General Aziz was posted with the ISI, directing the ISI's analysis department, which had been responsible for providing analysis and gathering intelligence in India and Afghanistan, until 1998. Lt-Gen. Aziz was mainly responsible in keeping intelligence on the Talibans in Afghanistan, and had reputation in the country for his ultraconservative views. On October 1998, Lt-Gen. Aziz was moved to the Army GHQ when he was appointed as the Chief of General Staff, a second-in-command post under the Chief of Army Staff. Himself a Kashmiri, Gen. Aziz was fully committed to the Kashmir cause, begin implementing the plan for covert infiltration in Indian Kashmir, with the approval of the Chief of Army Staff. Later investigative reports compiled by Pakistani historians and journalists, it was revealed that Lt-Gen. Aziz was the leading general who was masterminding the area contingency operations of the Norther Command led by its GOC Maj-Gen. Javed Hassan. Despite being well aware of the consequences, the writers critically questioned Lt-Gen. Aziz's grand strategy that brought the two nations at the brink of war, with international opinion widely accepting the Indian narrative. During the heights of the military actions in Kargil region, the Indian intelligence was able to taped the telephonic conversations took place between the Chairman joint chiefs and army chief Gen. Pervez Musharraf and Chief of General Staff, Lt-Gen. Aziz, proving that it was the Pakistan Army that had infiltrated without the official approval from the executive, the civilian government led by Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif. When the conversations were leaked by the India's Union Ministry of Defence, Prime Minister Sharif met with Lt-Gen. Aziz who continuously denied the authenticity of the tapes, later confided to Chairman joint chiefs Musharraf that the success of operation relied on \\"total secrecy.\\" Later Pakistani Investigative journalist news reports identified that there were four army generals who were in much control of the area contingency plans in Kargil including Lt-Gen. Mahmud Ahmed, commanding the X Corps, Lt-Gen. Shahid Aziz of ISI's Analysis Wing, and Lt-Gen. Jan Orakzai, commanding the XI Corps, besides Lt-Gen. Aziz. After the Kargil incident, there were no official military inquiries into this incident nor there were any subsequent evidence that led to the punishments of those responsible for such incidents. On 12 October 1999, Lt-Gen. Aziz played a decisive role in initiating the military takeover of the civilian government led by Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif when he refused to transfer the control of the military to General Ziauddin Butt. Passing orders to take over the control of the Jinnah Terminal in Karachi, Lt-Gen. Aziz effectively gained control of the military in favor of the Gen. Pervez Musharraf who removed Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif and his administration. After the President Clinton paying a state visit to Pakistan in 2000, Lt-Gen. Aziz was removed from his position and was appointed as the field commander of the IV Corps stationed in Lahore, Punjab, Pakistan, which he commanded until 2001.

Aziz was surprisingly promoted to four-star rank with an immediate effect when he was appointed as the Chairman joint chiefs. This promotion was one of the earliest controversial decisions made by the Musharraf administration, where news media had been very critical of this appointment. At the time of the promotion, Lt-Gen. Aziz was sixth in the seniority with senior army generals who were in the race of promotion to four- star included with seniority: *Lt-Gen. Muzaffar Osmani‚ÄìVice-Chief of Army Staff at Army GHQ in Rawalpindi *Lt-Gen. Hamid Javaid‚Äì Chief of Staff to the President of Pakistan *Lt-Gen. Mahmud Ahmed‚Äì DG ISI *Lt-Gen.

Aziz were elevated to their four-star commanding appointments, the remaining four army generals seek their retirement when they tendered their resignations. Resignations of Mahmud Ahmed and Osmani were widely rumoured due to their closeness to the terrorists outfits. He also stayed as the Colonel-in-Chief of the Punjab Regiment appointed by General Pervez Musharraf on 21 March 2003. Upon appointed, Gen. Aziz called on President Musharraf, thanking the president for the promotion. Despite his initial support for Gen. Musharraf, Aziz Khan soon regretted playing his part in bringing to help stabilize Gen. Pervez Musharraf's role against the civilian government when he lectured and quoted: \\"politics should not be done in uniform.\\" In 2001, Gen. Aziz publicly came out against President Pervez Musharraf's policy on siding with the United States, without effectively addressing the issue of containing the terrorists organizations. He viewed the American attack on Afghanistan with great suspicion, and had held sympathetic views towards the Talibans in Afghanistan, and harboured strong anti-American views when he termed the Americans as \\"number one enemy\\". In a response to the terrorist attack on Indian parliament in 2001, Gen. Aziz oversaw the troop deployment across the border amid the military standoff, and supportive towards the Chinese mediation between the relations of two countries. In 2003, Gen. Aziz went to visit Sri Lanka where he met with Sri Lankan President Chandrika Kumaratunga where he agreed to provide military assistance to Sri Lanka to their civil war. In 2005, Gen.

Marzigliano, aka Leonard Maffei Leonard Maffei was a champion bicycle racer in the United States during the 1930s. Born Leonardo E. Marzigliano in Providence, Rhode Island, he raced under his mother's maiden name because his own name was too long to fit on a jersey. Based in Brooklyn, New York, Maffei raced throughout the Northeast during the heyday of American bicycle racing in venues like Madison Square Garden and the Coney Island Velodrome. He won the New York state championship three times, in 1933's Junior division and the Senior title in 1936 and 1937. Leonard's accomplishments also include riding an antique bicycle (used by Charles M. \\"Mile a Minute\\" Murphy in 1899 to ride a measured mile in under 60 seconds) on national television. In 1936, Leonard won the New York State championship race, but found himself without a way to reach the national championships which were held in St. Louis, Missouri that year. His uncle Damiano Maffei (affectionately known as Uncle Mimi), procured a car by having his brothers and friends contribute towards the expenses in exchange for passage on the trip. Unfortunately, it took so many men to fund the trip that there was no room for Leonard in the small car. Billing his solution as \\"training\\", Uncle Mimi had Leonard pedal behind the car on his bicycle from Brooklyn to St. Louis. The 950 mile trip left him so physically exhausted that he lost the race. An extremely accident prone Leonard survived the Spanish Influenza outbreak of 1918, a household fire, a gas leak, and numerous incidents of falls and car strikes while riding his bicycle, both on and off the competitive track. His most severe injury occurred on July 14, 1962 at the Fair Oaks Velodrome near Middletown, New York. Leonard fell heavy during the seniors race and was inadvertently run over by some of the other riders. He suffered a broken neckbone, shoulder bone, collar bone, and five ribs. Outside of racing, Leonard worked as a ship painter in the Brooklyn Navy Yard, and painted apartments in the famed Stuyvesant Town and Peter Cooper Village housing developments in Manhattan. In his later years, he served as a housesitter and airport driver for affluent retirees in Fort Lauderdale, Florida. A prolific athlete who rode 20 miles a day well into his 70s, he died of stomach cancer in 1989.

Lang was educated at Sydney College under William Timothy Cape. Lang went to Cambridge in March 1837 and, after qualifying as a barrister, returned to Australia. Career In 1842, at a public meeting, he seconded a motion proposed by William Wentworth, that the Crown be petitioned to grant the colony a representative assembly. A few months later he went to India and was successful as a barrister, taking on high-profile clients such as the Rani of Jhansi in her battles against the British East India Company. Lang became a journalist and in 1845 established a paper, the Mofussilite, at Meerut. He also wrote some novels which appeared serially in the Mofussilite and in Fraser's Magazine.

Noad was best known for his popular instructional television series, Guitar with Frederick Noad, which was originally televised on PBS in the mid-1960s and re-syndicated in color in the early 1980s, and which continues to be broadcast today. Biography Born in Blankenberge, Belgium, to British parents, who were on holiday in that country at the time, Noad moved at an early age with his family to Eversley, England and was originally introduced to music through the violin and piano. As a teenager, Noad started playing the guitar, which quickly became his favorite instrument. Noad took a nontraditional path to becoming a professional musician. He received a liberal arts education at Wellington College, Berkshire, earning diplomas in a wide variety of disciplines including ancient history, Latin, Greek, and literature. After service in the Royal Corps of Signals, he earned his master's degree in jurisprudence at Brasenose College, Oxford University in 1957. After graduating from college, Noad found work in America working for J Arthur Rank Films Company. But the company's restructuring made his job redundant and forced him to look for new work. It was at this point that Noad decided to pursue a career in music. He started a small music business in Hollywood, California called the Spanish Guitar Center where he offered music lessons and sold imported classical guitars from famous makers in Spanish cities such as Cordoba and Granada. He also continued his own study under Spanish guitar virtuoso Andr√©s Segovia during Segovia's renowned professional classes at M√∫sica en Compostela in Spain and also under English classical player Julian Bream. Noad married Marilyn Clay Stuart on June 2, 1960. (It was during his honeymoon that he had met Segovia). Settling in California, Noad became an American citizen. Noad soon established himself as a skilled performer and began teaching music at the University of California, Irvine and the California Institute of the Arts. He also authored several instructional guitar books, many focusing on classical guitar playing, but some also encompassing a wide variety of other styles such as travis picking, folk and country, flamenco, Latin rhythms, the blues, and rock and roll.

It was established on a tract of land southeast of Jaffa leased from the Ottoman Sultan, who allocated to the project.Mikve Israel Agricultural School Go Israel The name is taken from two passages in the Book of Jeremiah, Jeremiah 14:8 and 17:13, and was proposed by Wolf Grinstein, one of the school's first students, who later taught there. Netter, the first headmaster, introduced new methods of agricultural training, with Baron Edmond James de Rothschild contributing to the upkeep of the school. Netter pioneered progressive educational methods and a new way of life and agricultural training to the future farmers of this land. There were only about 20,000 Jews in the country at that time, mostly established in the traditional cities of Judaism: Jerusalem, Tiberias, Safed and Hebron.

Their teachers wrote the first study books about agriculture and served as field advisors. Most of the agricultural know-how of the first 50 years was collected and published by Mikve Israel. After finishing their studies, the thousands of graduates left Mikve Israel to start agricultural settlements of all kinds, villages and kibbutzim, moshavim, farms and agricultural schools; or serving in management positions; or continued their agricultural studies in institutions of higher learning and filling positions in research and development, the export branches, marketing and agricultural management.

Most of the fields are irrigated using wells and include field crops, industrial crops, vegetables, fruit trees, orange groves and greenhouses. The school also raises animals including milk cows, chickens and honey bees, as well as having auxiliary branches including computerized agriculture. One dunam (0.1 hectares) is covered by greenhouses. The aim of the greenhouse production branch is to teach students and allow them to research greenhouse issues and technologies. A rainwater harvesting system allows efficient re-use of water collected from the roof for growing of vegetables in greenhouses. Gardening and landscaping activity over 100 dunams (10 hectares) includes woods, lawns and beauty & leisure gardens and spots throughout the village. The gardening and landscaping is maintained by the students supervised and coached by the manager of this production branch. The botanical garden was established in 1930 in order to adapt and acclimate trees and species to the Israeli climate. Plants were imported from all over the world. It now covers now 70 dunams (7 hectares). The dairy farm covers as genetics, computers, milking parlor and cooling, product quality control, feeding, herd health, udder health, artificial insemination and embryo transfer and implants. The stable has the following breeds of riding horses: Hanoverian, Holland and quarter-horse breeds suited to all types of horseback riding: western, sports, and therapeutic riding.

His work ranges from conventional oils on canvas to multi-media compositions and collages to sculptures and architecture. As an originator of Pop art, Phillips trained at the Royal College of Art with his contemporaries David Hockney, Allen Jones, R.B. Kitaj and others figures in British Pop Art. When he was awarded a Harkness Fellowship he moved to New York, where he exhibited alongside American counterparts Andy Warhol, Roy Lichtenstein and James Rosenquist. Phillips later returned to Europe, where he now resides and continues to paint and exhibit. Biography For Men Only ‚Äì Starring MM and BB (1961), Oil, wood and collage on canvas.Phillips was born in 1939 in Birmingham, England. From 1953 to 1955, he studied at Moseley Road Secondary School of Art in Birmingham and from 1955 to 1959 at the Birmingham School of Art. In 1959, he visited Paris and started to exhibit at the RBA Galleries in London. =Sixties= Between 1959 and 1962, Phillips studied at the Royal College of Art where he saw reproductions of work by Jasper Johns and Robert Rauschenberg. He was particularly aligned to American culture and reflected its commercial iconography and aggressive advertising style in his dynamic montage paintings. From 1962 to 1963, he taught at the Coventry College of Art and the Birmingham College of Art. In 1963, he was represented at the Paris Biennale, and in 1964 his work was included in the Pop Art exhibition shown at the Hague, Vienna and Berlin. In 1964, Phillips was awarded the Harkness Fellowship, which brought him to New York where he lived from 1964 until 1966 and while there travelled throughout the United States with his close friend, Allen Jones. In 1965, he had his first one-man exhibition at the Kornblee Gallery, New York. A year later, Phillips returned to Europe, and from 1968 to 1969, he was guest teacher at the Hochschule f√ºr bildende K√ºnste Hamburg. =Seventies= In 1970, Peter Phillips married Claude Marion Xylander and they made frequent trips throughout Africa, the Far East, and the United States. Throughout the decade of the seventies, the Phillips' resided in Zurich, Switzerland. In 1972, Phillips had a retrospective at the Westf√§lischer Kunstverein, M√ºnster, and in 1976 at the Tate Gallery, London. In 1977 he had a retrospective in Milan. =Eighties= In 1981, Phillips' travels took him to Australia. In 1982-83 he had a retrospective exhibition shown at the Walker Art Gallery in Liverpool; the Museum of Modern Art, Oxford; the Laing Art Gallery in Newcastle-upon-Tyne; the Fruitmarket Gallery in Edinburgh; Southampton Art Gallery and the Barbican Art Gallery in London. In 1986, Phillips moved from Zurich to Majorca. Throughout the eighties his work was exhibited at galleries around Spain, including Barcelona, Valencia, Madrid, and Majorca. =Nineties= The decade of the nineties brought Phillips' work to Canada and the United States, for exhibitions in Montreal, Boston, Houston, and New York. He was a featured artist at the Fundacio Miro and Casal Solleric in Majorca in 1996. In 1998, he was exhibited in London at the \\"Freedom of Choices\\" exhibition. At the same time, Phillips built and expanded his property in Majorca to his own design, which has been featured in numerous architecture, gardening, and home magazines. In 1995, he designed the Granada Television idents and endboards featuring the \\"G-arrow\\". =2000 ‚Äì present= A Phillips retrospective was shown in 2002 at the Galleria Civica di Modena, Italy.

Cat communication is the transfer of information by one or more cats that has an effect on the current or future behaviour of another animal, including humans. Cats use a range of communication modalities including vocal, visual, tactile and olfactory. The communication modalities used by domestic cats have been affected by domestication. Vocal communication Cat vocalizations have been categorized according to a range of characteristics. Originally suggested by Mildred Moelk, cat sounds are often still divided into the three main classes: # sounds produced with the mouth closed, the murmurs (purring, trilling) # sounds produced when the mouth is first opened and then gradually closed (meowing, howling, yowling) # sounds produced with the mouth held tensely open in the same position (growls, snarls, hisses, spits, chattering, and chirping). In 1944, Moelk published the first phonetic study of cat sounds.https://www.jstor.org/stable/1416947?seq=1#metadata_info_tab_contents She listened very carefully to her own cats and organized their sounds into 16 phonetic patterns divided into three main categories. She also used a phonetic alphabet to transcribe or write down the different sounds.https://www.google.com/books/edition/The_Secret_Language_of_Cats/1mpFDwAAQBAJ?hl=en&gbpv;=1&dq;=inauthor:%22Susanne+Sch%C3%B6tz%22&printsec;=frontcover She claimed cats had six different forms of meows, to represent friendliness, confidence, dissatisfaction, anger, fear and pain. Moelk classified eight other sounds involved in mating and fighting by listening to the animals in her yard and on the street. Brown et al. categorised vocal responses of cats according to the behavioral context: during separation of kittens from mother cats, during food deprivation, during pain, prior to or during threat or attack behavior, as in disputes over territory or food, during a painful or acutely stressful experience, as in routine prophylactic injections and during kitten deprivation. Less commonly recorded calls from mature cats included purring, conspecific greeting calls or murmurs, extended vocal dialogues between cats in separate cages, \\"frustration\\" calls during training or extinction of conditioned responses. Miller classified vocalisations into five categories according to the sound produced: the purr, chirr, call, meow and growl/snarl/hiss. Owens et al. categorized cat vocalisations based on their acoustic structures. There are three categories: tonal sounds, pulse sounds, and broadband sounds. Tonal sounds are further categorized into groups of harmonically structured sounds or regular tonal sounds. Pulse vocalisations are separated into pulse bursts and hybrid pulse bursts with tonal endings. Broadband sounds are separated into four groups: non-tonal broadband sounds, broadband sounds with tonal beginnings, broadband sounds with short tonal elements, and broadband sounds with long tonal endings. =Purr= Cat on the move. The purr is a continuous, soft, vibrating sound made in the throat by most species of felines. Domestic kittens can purr as early as two days of age. This tonal rumbling can characterize different personalities in domestic cats. Purring is often believed to indicate a positive emotional state, but cats sometimes purr when they are ill, tense, or experiencing traumatic or painful moments such as giving birth. A more expansive definition is \\"purring signals a friendly social mood, and it can be given as a signal to, say, a vet from an injured cat indicating the need for friendship, or as a signal to an owner, saying thank you for friendship given.\\" The mechanism of how cats purr is elusive. This is partly because cats do not have a unique anatomical feature that is clearly responsible for this vocalization. One hypothesis, supported by electromyographic studies, is that cats produce the purring noise by using the vocal folds and/or the muscles of the larynx to alternately dilate and constrict the glottis rapidly, causing air vibrations during inhalation and exhalation. Combined with the steady inhalation and exhalation as the cat breathes, a purring noise is produced with strong harmonics. Purring is sometimes accompanied by other sounds, though this varies between individuals. Some may only purr, while other cats also emit low level outbursts sometimes described as \\"lurps\\" or \\"yowps\\". It was once believed that only the cats of the genus Felis could purr.Breton, R. Roger; Creek, Nancy J. \\"Overview of Felidae\\". Cougar Hill Web. Retrieved May 23, 2013. However, felids of the genus Panthera (tigers, lions, jaguars and leopards) also produce sounds similar to purring, but only when exhaling. Cats may purr for a variety of reasons, including when they are hungry, happy, or anxious. =Meow= A cat meowing for attention The most familiar vocalisation of adult cats is a \\"meow\\" or \\"miaow\\" sound (pronounced ). The meow can be assertive, plaintive, friendly, bold, welcoming, attention-soliciting, demanding, or complaining. It can even be silent, where the cat opens its mouth but does not vocalize. A mew is a high-pitched meow often produced by domestic kittens. It is apparently used to solicit attention from the kitten's mother, and adult cats may use it as well. The mew is similar to what is described in Brown et al. 1978 as an isolation call. By around three to four weeks of age kittens do not mew when at least one littermate is present, and at four to five months of age kittens stop mewing altogether. Adult cats rarely meow to each other, and so adult meowing to human beings is likely to be a post-domestication extension of mewing by kittens. =Chirr= The chirr or chirrup sounds like a meow rolled on the tongue. It is commonly used by mother cats calling their kittens inside the nest. Kittens recognize their own mother's chirp, and do not respond to the chirps of other mothers. It is also used by friendly cats when eliciting the approach of another cat or a human. Humans can mimic the sound to reassure and greet pet cats. =Chirping and chattering= A cat chattering at birds Cats sometimes make excited chirping or chattering noises when observing or stalking prey. These range from quiet clicking sounds to loud but sustained chirping mixed with the occasional meow. Some researchers believe this chattering may also be an involuntary instinctual imitation of the moment a killing bite on the neck occurs. This action activates a vibration of the feline's jaws to allow the precision to slide between a prey's spine. =Call= The call is a loud, rhythmic vocalisation made with the mouth closed. It is primarily associated with female cats soliciting males, and sometimes occurs in males when fighting with each other. A caterwaul is the cry of a cat in heat (estrus). =Growl, snarl, hiss, and spit= The growl, snarl, and hiss are all vocalisations associated with either offensive or defensive aggression. They are usually accompanied by a postural display intended to have a visual effect on the perceived threat. The communication may be directed at cats as well as other species ‚Äì the puffed-up hissing and spitting display of a cat toward an approaching dog is a well- known behavior. Cats hiss when they are startled, scared, angry, or in pain, and also to scare off intruders into their territory. If the hiss and growl warning does not remove the threat, an attack by the cat may follow. Kittens as young as two to three weeks will hiss and spit when first picked up by a human. \\"Spitting\\" is a shorter but louder and more emphatic version of hissing. Familiar lion's roar recorded from a big cat in captivity. = Howl, yowl, moan, and wail = These sounds are commonly used during threatening situations. Howls are more tonal, while moans are long and slowly modulated. Anger wails are combined with growls, and yowls are similar to howls, but longer.Sch√∂tz, S., 2015, June. Agonistic vocalisations in domestic cats: a case study. In Proc Fonetik (Vol. 2015, pp. 85-90). Panting A cat panting Unlike dogs, panting is a rare occurrence in cats, except in warm weather environments. Some cats may pant in response to anxiety, fear or excitement. It can also be caused by play, exercise, or stress from stimuli such as car rides. However, if panting is excessive or the cat appears in distress, it may be a symptom of a more serious condition, such as a nasal blockage, heartworm disease, head trauma, or drug poisoning. In many cases, feline panting, especially if accompanied by other symptoms, such as coughing or shallow breathing (dyspnea), is considered to be abnormal, and treated as a medical emergency. =Ultrasonic= Very high frequency (\\"ultrasonic\\") response components have been observed in kitten vocalizations. Visual communication A cat hissing and arching its back to make itself appear larger to ward off a threat Cats use postures and movement to communicate a wide range of information. There are various responses such as when cats arch their backs, erect their hairs and adopt a sideward posture to communicate fear or aggression. Others may be only a single behavioural change (as perceived by humans) such as slowly blinking to signal relaxation. Domestic cats frequently use visual communication with their eyes, ears, mouths, tails, coats and body postures. It has been stated that a cat's facial features change the most and are probably the best indicator of cat communication. =Posture = Surprised cats have enlarged pupils and erect ears held slightly backwards. A cat's posture communicates its emotions. It is best to observe cats' natural behavior when they are by themselves, with humans, and with other animals. Their postures can be friendly or aggressive, depending upon the situation. Some of the most basic and familiar cat postures include the following: *Relaxed posture ‚Äì The cat is seen lying on the side or sitting. Its breathing is slow to normal, with legs bent, or hind legs laid out or extended. The tail is loosely wrapped, extended, or held up. It also hangs down loosely when the cat is standing. When cats are calm, they tend to stand relaxed with a still tail. *Stretching posture ‚Äì another posture indicating the cat is relaxed. When cats lie on their back with their belly exposed, they are in a position of vulnerability. Therefore, this position may communicate a feeling of trust or comfort; however, cats may also roll onto their back to defend themselves with their claws, or to bask in areas of bright sunlight. *Yawning posture ‚Äì either by itself, or in conjunction with a stretch: another posture of a relaxed cat. Having the mouth open and no teeth exposed indicates playfulness. *Alert posture ‚Äì The cat is lying on its belly, or it may be sitting. Its back is almost horizontal when standing and moving. Its breathing is normal, with its legs bent or extended (when standing). Its tail is curved back or straight upwards, and there may be twitching while the tail is positioned downwards. *Tense posture ‚Äì The cat is lying on its belly, with the back of its body lower than its upper body (slinking) when standing or moving back. Its hind legs are bent and front legs are extended when standing. Its tail is close to the body, tensed or curled downwards; there can be twitching when the cat is standing up. *Anxious/ovulating posture ‚Äì The cat is lying on its belly. The back of the body is more visibly lower than the front part when the cat is standing or moving. Its breathing may be fast, and its legs are tucked under its body. The tail is close to the body and may be curled forward (or close to the body when standing), with the tip of the tail moving up and down (or side to side). *Fearful posture ‚Äì The cat is lying on its belly or crouching directly on top of its paws. Its entire body may be shaking and very near the ground when standing up. Breathing is also fast, with its legs bent near the surface, and its tail curled and very close to its body when standing on all fours. A fearful, defensive cat makes itself smaller, lowers itself toward the ground, arches its back and leans its body away from the threat rather than forward. Fighting usually occurs only when escape is impossible. *Confident posture ‚Äì The cat may walk around in a more comfortable manner with its tail up to the sky indicating their importance. Cats often walk through houses with their tail standing up high above them making them look grander and more elegant. *Terrified posture ‚Äì The cat is crouched directly on top of its paws, with visible shaking seen in some parts of the body. Its tail is close to the body, and it can be standing up, together with its hair at the back. The legs are very stiff or even bent to increase their size. Typically, cats avoid contact when they feel threatened, although they can resort to varying degrees of aggression when they feel cornered, or when escape is impossible. *Aggressive posture ‚Äì The hind legs stiffen, the rump elevates but the back stays flat, tail hairs are erected, the nose is pushed forward and the ears are pulled back slightly. Because cats have both claws and teeth, they can easily cause injury if they become involved in a fight, so this posture is an attempt to elicit deference by a competitor without fighting. The aggressor may attempt to make challengers retreat and will pursue them if they do not flee. A tortoiseshell cat with erect hairs on its tail and back which in this context indicates excitement or curiosity =Ears= Cats can change the position of their ears very quickly, in a continuum from erect when the cat is alert and focused, slightly relaxed when the cat is calm, and flattened against the head when extremely defensive or aggressive. In cats, flattened ears generally indicate that an individual feels threatened and may attack. Flattening of the ears is also a biological adaptation for stalking prey in grass or in a hiding place where the cat's erect ears would give away its position. =Eyes= A direct stare by a cat usually communicates a challenge or threat and is more likely to be seen in high-ranking cats; lower-ranking cats usually withdraw in response. The direct stare is often used during predation or for territorial reasons. In contrast to a direct stare, cats will lower their eyelids or slowly blink them to show trust and affection to their owners. According to Gary Weitzman, a licensed veterinarian and animal author, this type of feline body language is similar to a \\"kitty kiss\\". He further explains in his book, \\"How To Speak Cat: A Guide to Decoding Cat Language,\\" that slow blinking could be a physiological response to lowered stress hormonal levels from being in a calm state. \\"The slow blink really is an acceptance gesture,\\" Weitzman says. \\"They do that when they're absolutely comfortable with you, and they do it with other cats as well.\\" It is not clear why cats do this when they are feeling calm and comfortable, but Weitzman writes, \\"it's likely an autonomic response ‚Ä¶ having to do with the cat having its cortisol [stress hormone] levels down.\\" In fact, Weitzman encourages cat owners to mimic this behavior to return not only a message of affection, but one that reinforces a nonthreatening position. This behavior is not exclusive to domestic house cats. Since cats can be very territorial, in the wild they utilize this slow blinking with other cats to signal themselves as friendly or nonthreatening. =Tail= Cats often use their tails to communicate. A cat holding its tail vertically generally indicates positive emotions such as happiness or confidence; the vertical tail is often used as a friendly greeting toward human beings or other cats (usually close relatives). A half-raised tail can indicate less pleasure, and unhappiness is indicated with a tail held low. In addition, a cat's tail may swing from side to side. If this motion is slow and \\"lazy\\", it generally indicates that the cat is in a relaxed state. Cats will twitch the tip of their tail when hunting or when otherwise alert or playful. Abrupt, full-tail twitching indicates a state of indecision. A stalking domestic cat will typically hold its tail low to the ground while in a crouch, and twitch it quickly from side to side. This tail behavior is also seen when a cat has become \\"irritated\\" and is nearing the point of lashing out, typically by biting or swatting with claws extended. A cat may also twitch its tail when playing. Sometimes during play, a cat, or more commonly, a kitten, will raise the base of its tail high and stiffen all but the tip into a shape like an upside-down \\"U\\". This signals great excitement, to the point of hyperactivity. This may also be seen when younger cats chase each other, or when they run around by themselves. When greeting their owner, cats often hold their tails straight up with a quivering motion that indicates extreme happiness. A scared or surprised cat may erect the hairs on its tail and back. In addition, it may stand more upright and turn its body sideways to increase its apparent size as a threat. Tailless cats, such as the Manx, which possess only a small stub of a tail, move the stub around as if they have a full tail. Tactile communication = Grooming = Cat grooming itself. Cats often lick other cats as allogrooming or to bond (this grooming is usually done between familiar cats). They also sometimes lick humans, which may indicate affection. Oral grooming for domestic and feral cats is a common behavior; recent studies on domestic cats show that they spend about 8% of resting time grooming themselves. Grooming is extremely important not only to clean themselves but also to ensure ectoparasite control. Fleas tend to be the most common ectoparasite of cats and some studies allude to indirect evidence that grooming in cats is effective in dislodging fleas from the head and neck. Cats may also use grooming to scratch itchy areas of the body. =Kneading= Cats sometimes repeatedly tread their front paws on humans or soft objects with a kneading action. This is instinctive to kittens and adults, and is presumably derived from the action used to stimulate milk let-down by the mother during nursing. Kittens \\"knead\\" the breast while suckling, using the forelimbs one at a time in an alternating pattern to push against the mammary glands to stimulate lactation in the mother. Kneading may also have an origin going back to cats' wild ancestors who had to tread down grass or foliage to make a temporary nest in which to rest. Cats carry these infantile behaviors beyond nursing and into adulthood. Some cats \\"nurse,\\" i.e. suck, on clothing or bedding during kneading. The cat exerts firm downwards pressure with its paw, spreading its toes to expose its claws, then curls its toes as it lifts its paw. The process takes place with alternate paws at intervals of one to two seconds. They may knead while sitting on their owner's lap, which may prove painful if the cat has sharp claws. Since most of the preferred \\"domestic traits\\" are neotenous or juvenile traits that persist in the adult, kneading may be a relic juvenile behavior retained in adult domestic cats. It may also stimulate the cat and make it feel good, in the same manner as a human stretching. Kneading is often a precursor to sleeping. Many cats purr while kneading, usually taken to indicate contentment and affection. They also purr mostly when newborn, when feeding, or when trying to feed on their mother's teat. The common association between the two behaviors may corroborate the evidence in favor of the origin of kneading as a remnant instinct. Cats have scent glands on the underside of their paws. When they knead or scratch objects or people, it is likely these pheromones are transferred to the person or object being kneaded or scratched. =Bunting= Some cats rub their faces on humans, apparently as a friendly greeting or indicating affection. This tactile action is combined with olfactory communication as the contact leaves scent from glands located around the mouth and cheeks. Cats also sometimes \\"head-bump\\" humans or other cats with the front part of the head; this action is referred to as \\"bunting\\". Again this communication might have an olfactory component as there are scent glands in this area of the body, and is possibly for seeking attention when the cat turns their head down or to the side while doing so. Head-bumping and cheek rubbing may be displays of social dominance as they are often exhibited by a dominant cat towards a subordinate. Touching noses, sometimes referred to as \\"sniffing noses\\", is a friendly, tactile greeting for cats. =Biting= Gentle biting (often accompanied by purring and kneading) can communicate affection or playfulness, directed at the human owner or another cat; however, stronger bites that are often accompanied by hissing or growling usually communicate aggression.\\"Play Therapy Pt. 2,\\" Cats International retrieved May 22, 2007 When cats mate, the tom bites the scruff of the female's neck as she assumes a lordosis position which communicates that she is receptive to mating. Olfactory communication Cats communicate olfactorily through scent in urine, feces, and chemicals or pheromones from glands located around the mouth, chin, forehead, cheeks, lower back, tail and paws. Their rubbing and head-bumping behaviors are methods of depositing these scents on substrates, including humans. The cat rubs its cheeks on prominent objects in the preferred territory, depositing a chemical pheromone produced in glands in the cheeks. This is known as a contentment pheromone. Synthetic versions of the feline facial pheromone are available commercially. Cats have nine different glands on their body. These are the Pinna (Outer Ear Flaps), Temporal (On their Temples), Cheek (On the sides of their face), Perioral (On the Mouth Corners), Submandibular (Under the Jaw), Interdigital (Between Toes), Anal (on the sides of the Anus), Caudal (All Along Tail), and Supra- Caudal (at the Base of Tail) Urine spraying is also a territorial marking. Cats urinate by squatting onto a horizontal surface; spraying occurs standing up. The cat makes a treading motion with her back feet and quivers her tail, leaving her scent mark on a vertical surface. Unlike a dog's penis, a cat's penis points backward. Although cats may mark with both sprayed and non- sprayed urine, the spray is usually more thick and oily than normally deposited urine, and may contain additional secretions from anal sacs that help the sprayer to make a stronger communication. While cats mark their territory both by rubbing of the scent glands and by urine and fecal deposits, spraying seems to be the \\"loudest\\" feline olfactory statement. It is most frequently observed in intact male cats in competition with other males. Males neutered in adulthood may still spray after neutering. Female cats also sometimes spray. A cat that urinates outside the litter box may indicate dissatisfaction with the box, due to a variety of factors such as substrate texture, cleanliness and privacy. It can also be a sign of urinary tract problems. Male cats on poor diets are susceptible to crystal formation in the urine which can block the urethra and create a medical emergency. The urine of mature male cats in particular contains the amino acid known as felinine which is a precursor to 3-mercapto-3-methylbutan-1-ol (MMB), the sulfur-containing compound that gives cat urine its characteristically strong odor. Felinine is produced in the urine from 3-methylbutanol-cysteinylglycine (3-MBCG) by the excreted peptidase cauxin. It then slowly degrades via bacterial lyase into the more-volatile chemical MMB. Felinine is a possible cat pheromone. { align=\\"center\\" - align=\\"center\\" valign=\\"middle\\"  Chemical structure of felinine  ‚Üí Chemical structure of 3-mercapto-3-methylbutan-1-ol - align=\\"center\\" valign=\\"middle\\"  Felinine  MMB } Socialization Cats, domestic or wild, do participate in social behaviours, even though it is thought that most cat species (besides lions) are solitary, antisocial animals. These include social learning, socialization between cats, and socialization with humans. = Social learning = Cats are observational learners. This type of learning emerges early in a cat's life, and has been shown in many laboratory studies. Young kittens learn to hunt from their mothers by observing their techniques when catching prey. The mother ensures their kittens learn hunting techniques by first bringing dead prey to the litter, followed by live prey. With the live prey, she demonstrates the techniques required for successful capture. Prey-catching behaviour of kittens improves at higher levels over time when their mothers are present. Observational learning for cats can be described in terms of the drive to complete the behaviour, the cue that initiates the behaviour, the response to the cue, and the reward for completing the behaviour. This is shown when cats learn predatory behaviour from their mothers. The drive is hunger, the cue is the prey, the response is to catch the prey, and the reward is to relieve the hunger sensation. Kittens also show observational learning when they are socializing with humans. They are more likely to initiate socialization with humans when their mothers are exhibiting non-aggressive and non-defensive behaviours. Even though mothers spend more time with their kittens, male cats play an important role by breaking up fights among litter mates. Observational learning is not limited to kitten-hood ‚Äì it can also be observed during adulthood. Studies have shown that adult cats that see others performing a task, such as pressing a lever after a visual cue, learn to perform the same task faster than those who did not witness another cat at that task. = Socialization between cats = Usually when strange cats meet, one cat makes a sudden movement that puts the other cat into a defensive mode. The cat will then draw in on itself and prepare to attack if needed. The subordinate cat will usually run away before a physical altercation ensues; however, this is not always the case, and what is known as a \\"tomcat duel\\" may follow. Dominance is also seen as an underlying factor for how conspecifics interact with each other.  Dominance  Dominance can be seen among cats in multi-cat households. \\"Subordinate\\" cats submit to the \\"dominant\\" cat. Dominance includes such behaviours as walking around the dominant cat, waiting for the dominant cat to walk past, avoiding eye contact, crouching, laying on its side (defensive posture), and retreating when the dominant cat approaches. Dominant cats present a specific body posture as well. The cat displays ears straight up, the base of its tail will be arched, and it looks directly at subordinate cats. These dominant cats are usually not aggressive, but if a subordinate cat blocks the food source they may become aggressive. When this aggressive behaviour occurs, it could also lead to the dominant cat preventing subordinate cats from eating and using the litter box. This can cause the subordinate cat to defecate somewhere else and create problems with human interaction.  Social conflicts  Two cats fighting Social conflicts among cats depend solely on the behaviour of the cats. Some research has shown that cats rarely pick fights, but when they do it is usually for protecting food and/or litters, and defending territory. A conflict situation of one tomcat meeting another, making loud calls. The first sign of an imminent tomcat duel is when both cats draw themselves up high on their legs, all hair along the middle of their backs is standing straight up, and they mew and howl loudly as they approach one another. The steps the cats make become slower and shorter the closer they become to one another. Once they are close enough to attack, they pause slightly, and then one cat leaps and tries to bite the nape of the other cat. The other cat has no choice but to retaliate and both cats roll aggressively on the ground, and loud intense screams come from both cats. After some time, the cats separate and stand face to face to begin the attack all over again. This can go on for some time until one cat does not get up again and remains seated. The defeated cat does not move until the victor has completed a sniff of the area and moves outside the fighting area. Once this happens, the defeated cat leaves the area, ending the duel. Females may also fight with each other. If a male and female do not get along, they may also fight. Cats may need to be reintroduced or separated to avoid fights in a closed household. = Socialization with humans = Cats between the age of three and nine weeks are sensitive to human socialization. After this period, socialization can be less effective. Studies have shown that the earlier the kitten is handled, the less fearful the kitten will be towards humans. Other factors that can enhance socialization are having many people handle the kitten frequently, the presence of the mother, and feeding. The presence of the mother is important because cats are observational learners. A mother that is comfortable around humans can reduce anxiety in the kitten and promote the kitten-human relationship. Feral kittens around two to seven weeks old can be socialized usually within a month of capture. Some species of cats cannot be socialized towards humans because of factors like genetic influence and in some cases specific learning experiences. The best way to get a kitten to socialize is to handle the kitten for many hours a week. The process is made easier if there is another socialized cat present but not necessarily in the same space as the feral. If the handler can get a cat to urinate in the litter tray, then the others in a litter will usually follow. Initial contact with thick gloves is highly recommended until trust is established, usually within the first week. It is a challenge to socialize an adult. Socialized adult feral cats tend to trust only those who they trusted in their socialization period, and therefore can be very fearful around strangers. There are a number of problematic behaviours that affect the human‚Äìcat relationship. One behaviour is when cats attack people by clawing and biting. This often occurs spontaneously or could be triggered by sudden movements. Another problematic behaviour is the \\"petting and biting syndrome\\", which involves the cat being petted and then suddenly attacking and running away. Other problems are house soiling, scratching furniture, and when a cat brings dead prey into the house. It is these kinds of behaviours that put a strain on the socialization between cats and people. There are fifty-two measured cat personality traits in cats, with one study suggesting \\"five reliable personality factors were found using principal axis factor analysis: neuroticism, extroversion, dominance, impulsiveness and agreeableness.\\"  See also  * Animal communication * Cat pheromone * Dog communication References External links Animal communication Cat behavior ","title":"Cat communication"},{"id":"5741174","text":"Eugene Glass School is an art school located in Eugene, Oregon featuring glass art workshops for off-hand, lampworked, and fused glass.

Different languages use different terms for citizens of the United States, who are known in English as Americans. All forms of English refer to US citizens as Americans, a term deriving from the United States of America, the country's official name. In the English context, it came to refer to inhabitants of British North America, and then the United States. However, there is some linguistic ambiguity over this use due to the other senses of the word American, which can also refer to people from the Americas in general.Merriam-Webster's Dictionary of English Usage, p. 87. Retrieved November 28, 2008. Other languages, including French, Japanese, and Russian, use cognates of American to refer to people from the United States, while others, particularly Spanish and Portuguese, primarily use terms derived from United States. There are various other local and colloquial names for Americans.  Development of the term American  Amerigo Vespucci first demonstrated that Brazil and the West Indies did not represent Asia's eastern outskirts as conjectured by Christopher Columbus, but instead constituted an entirely separate landmass hitherto unknown to the peoples of the Old World. Martin Waldseem√ºller coined the term America (in honor of Vespucci) in a 1507 world map. First uses of the adjective American referenced European settlements in the New World. Americans referred to the indigenous peoples of the Americas and subsequently to European settlers and their descendants. English use of the term American for people of European descent dates to the 17th century, with the earliest recorded appearance being in Thomas Gage's The English-American: A New Survey of the West Indies in 1648. In English, American came to be applied especially to people in British America and thus its use as a demonym for the United States derives by extension. The United States Declaration of Independence of 1776 refers to \\"the thirteen States of America\\", making the first formal use of the country name, which was officially adopted in 1777 by the nation's first governing constitution, the Articles of Confederation.Articles of Confederation, Article 1.

The local area was in agricultural usage beginning sometime in the 1850s.Phase I Environmental Site Assessment, APN 537-521-1-11, Fremont, California, Earth Metrics Inc. report 10302, Nov. 15, 1989 The Ardenwood Farm locale was characterized first for its use as grazing land and dairy production, and gradually became increasingly dedicated to wheat and vegetable production. A review of available aerial photographs by Earth Metrics revealsAerial Photo GS-VACY 1-99, July 12, 1960, United States Geological Survey Photo Library, Washington DC, that the area immediately to the south was used for agricultural purposes from at least 1960 until some time in the late 1970s cultivated with a grain crop. No discrete rows are visible in the aerial photographs of that time. The Alameda family was a prominent occupant in the area for much of the period of agricultural land use. Mel Alameda of The Alameda Company confirmed to Earth Metrics that while cauliflower has been the dominant historic crop for the area, hay and grazing were the primary use later and until the late 1970s. Based on the lack of visible rows on the aerial photos, it is most probable that the area to the south was used for hay production rather than cauliflower.

History  The House of Commons Broadcast Service was established in October 1977 to maintain the video and audio equipment for broadcasting House of Commons proceedings. CBC had applied for the license in June 1979 to broadcast the House of Commons video feed with additional commentary. A competitive bid, by Canadian cable tv consortium, Cable Satellite Network (CSN) did not get a license for this service. The responsibility to distribute the signal was assigned to the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation. CBC used the Anik satellites to distribute the proceedings to Canadian cable companies. For most of the network's history, John Warren hosted a preview monologue before the beginning of daily proceedings and provided a short summary afterward. In 1989, the CBC and a consortium of cable television providers made a joint proposal for the creation of a new entity, the Canadian Parliamentary Channel (CPaC) that would carry the proceedings of the House of Commons and committees, along with proceedings of royal commissions, enquiries, court hearings and provincial legislatures, and public affairs programming. A review of parliamentary broadcasting resulted but the CPaC proposal was not acted upon. In December 1990, the CBC announced that as a result of budget cuts the CBC \\"is no longer able to bear the cost of operating the English- and French- language parliamentary channels. The government will seek the views of the Speaker of the House and consider means of maintaining the service.\\" The CBC announced that it was discontinuing its role as the parliamentary broadcaster effective April 1, 1991. As an interim measure, the House of Commons' Board of Internal Economy negotiated a temporary contract with the CBC to provide parliamentary coverage for an additional year while the Board considered proposals to take over the service. In 1992, the Board came to an agreement with Canadian Parliamentary Channel, Inc., a consortium of 25 cable companies, to take over the CBC's role. The Cable Public Affairs Channel, owned by a consortium of Canadian cable companies, took over responsibility for broadcasting the House of Commons of Canada proceedings in 1992.

Owing to the relative ease and low cost of raising them in comparison to animals such as cattle or hogs, chickens have become prevalent throughout the cuisine of cultures around the world, and their meat has been variously adapted to regional tastes. Chicken can be prepared in a vast range of ways, including baking, grilling, barbecuing, frying, and boiling, among many others, depending on its purpose. Since the latter half of the 20th century, prepared chicken has become a staple of fast food. Chicken is sometimes cited as being more healthful than red meat, with lower concentrations of cholesterol and saturated fat. The poultry farming industry that accounts for chicken production takes on a range of forms across different parts of the world. In developed countries, chickens are typically subject to intensive farming methods, while less-developed areas raise chickens using more traditional farming techniques. The United Nations estimates there to be 19 billion chickens on Earth today, making them outnumber humans more than two to one.

It was one of the basic ingredients in blancmange, a stew usually consisting of chicken and fried onions cooked in milk and seasoned with spices and sugar. In the United States in the 1800s, chicken was more expensive than other meats and it was \\"sought by the rich because [it is] so costly as to be an uncommon dish.\\" Chicken consumption in the U.S. increased during World War II due to a shortage of beef and pork.Poultry Farming , The History Channel. 2 March 2007.

The most common breeds of chicken consumed in the U.S. are Cornish and White Rock.Focus On: Chicken , USDA. 2 March 2007. Chickens raised specifically for food are called broilers. In the U.S., broilers are typically butchered at a young age. Modern Cornish Cross hybrids, for example, are butchered as early as 8 weeks for fryers and 12 weeks for roasting birds. Capons (castrated cocks) produce more and fattier meat. For this reason, they are considered a delicacy and were particularly popular in the Middle Ages. Edible components Oven-roasted rosemary and lemon chicken. Buffalo wings, invented in Buffalo, New York, are chicken wings that are generally deep-fried then coated or dipped in a sauce. They are now a staple in the cuisine of the United States. *Main **Breast: These are white meat and are relatively dry. **Leg: Comprises two segments: **# The \\"drumstick\\"; this is dark meat and is the lower part of the leg, **# the \\"thigh\\"; also dark meat, this is the upper part of the leg. **Wing: Often served as a light meal or bar food. Buffalo wings are a typical example. Comprises three segments: **# the \\"drumette\\", shaped like a small drumstick, this is white meat, **# the middle \\"flat\\" segment, containing two bones, and **# the tip, often discarded. *Other **Chicken feet: These contain relatively little meat, and are eaten mainly for the skin and cartilage. Although considered exotic in Western cuisine, the feet are common fare in other cuisines, especially in the Caribbean and China. **Giblets: organs such as the heart, gizzards, and liver may be included inside a butchered chicken or sold separately. **Head: Considered a delicacy in China, the head is split down the middle, and the brains and other tissue is eaten. **Kidneys: Normally left in when a broiler carcass is processed, they are found in deep pockets on each side of the vertebral column. **Neck: This is served in various Asian dishes. It is stuffed to make helzel among Ashkenazi Jews. **Oysters: Located on the back, near the thigh, these small, round pieces of dark meat are often considered to be a delicacy. **Pygostyle (chicken's buttocks) and testicles: These are commonly eaten in East Asia and some parts of South East Asia. *By-products **Blood: Immediately after slaughter, blood may be drained into a receptacle, which is then used in various products. In many Asian countries, the blood is poured into low, cylindrical forms, and left to congeal into disc-like cakes for sale. These are commonly cut into cubes, and used in soup dishes. **Carcass: After the removal of the flesh, this is used for soup stock. **Chicken eggs: The most well-known and well-consumed byproduct. **Heart and gizzard: in Brazilian churrascos, chicken hearts are an often seen as a delicacy. **Liver: This is the largest organ of the chicken, and is used in such dishes as P√¢t√© and chopped liver. **Schmaltz: This is produced by rendering the fat, and is used in various dishes. Health Chicken meat contains about two to three times as much polyunsaturated fat as most types of red meat when measured as weight percentage.Feinberg School > Nutrition > Nutrition Fact Sheet: Lipids, Northwestern University Chicken generally includes low fat in the meat itself (castrated roosters excluded). The fat is highly concentrated on the skin. A 100g serving of baked chicken breast contains 4 grams of fat and 31 grams of protein, compared to 10 grams of fat and 27 grams of protein for the same portion of broiled, lean skirt steak. =Use of Roxarsone in chicken production= In factory farming, chickens are routinely administered with the feed additive Roxarsone, an organoarsenic compound which partially decomposes into inorganic arsenic compounded in the flesh of chickens, and in their feces, which are often used as a fertilizer. The compound is used to control stomach pathogens and promote growth. In a 2013 sample conducted by the Johns Hopkins School of Public Health of chicken meat from poultry producers that did not prohibit roxarsone, 70% of the samples in the US had levels which exceeded the safety limits as set by the FDA. The FDA has since revised its stance on safe limits to inorganic arsenic in animal feed by stating that \\"any new animal drug that contributes to the overall inorganic arsenic burden is of potential concern\\". =Antibiotic resistance= Information obtained by the Canadian Integrated Program for Antimicrobial Resistance (CIPARS) \\"strongly indicates that cephalosporin resistance in humans is moving in lockstep with the use of the drug in poultry production\\". According to the Canadian Medical Association Journal, the unapproved antibiotic ceftiofur is routinely injected into eggs in Quebec and Ontario to discourage infection of hatchlings. Although the data are contested by the industry, antibiotic resistance in humans appears to be directly related to the antibiotic's use in eggs. A recent study by the Translational Genomics Research Institute showed that nearly half (47%) of the meat and poultry in US grocery stores was contaminated with S. aureus, with more than half (52%) of those bacteria resistant to antibiotics. Furthermore, as per the FDA, more than 25% of retail chicken is resistant to 5 or more different classes of antibiotic treatment drugs in the United States. An estimated 90‚Äì100% of conventional chicken contains, at least, one form of antibiotic resistance microorganism, while organic chicken has been found to have a lower incidence at 84%. =Fecal matter contamination= In random surveys of chicken products across the United States in 2012, the Physicians Committee for Responsible Medicine found 48% of samples to contain fecal matter. On most commercial chicken farms, the chickens spend their entire life standing in, lying on, and living in their own manure, which is somewhat mixed in with the bedding material (e.g. sawdust, wood shavings, chopped straw, etc.). During shipping from the concentrated animal feeding operation farm to the abattoir, the chickens are usually placed inside shipping crates that usually have slatted floors. Those crates are then piled 5 to 10 rows high on the transport truck to the abattoir. During shipment, the chickens tend to defecate, and that chicken manure tends to sit inside the crowded cages, contaminating the feathers and skin of the chickens, or rains down upon the chickens and crates on the lower levels of the transport truck. By the time the truck gets to the abattoir, most chickens have had their skin and feathers contaminated with feces. There is also fecal matter in the intestines. While the slaughter process removes the feathers and intestines, only visible fecal matter is removed. The high speed automated processes at the abattoir are not designed to remove this fecal contamination on the feather and skin. The high speed processing equipment tend to spray the contamination around to the birds going down the processing line, and the equipment on the line itself. At one or more points on most abattoirs, chemical sprays and baths (e.g. bleach, acids, peroxides, etc.) are used to partially rinse off or kill this bacterial contamination. Unfortunately, the fecal contamination, once it has occurred, especially in the various membranes between the skin and muscle, is impossible to completely remove. With slaughter lines processing up to 140 birds/minute, safety inspectors do not have adequate time to properly examine visible fecal matter. The USDA is currently allowing some abattoirs to process at unlimited line speeds (i.e. in excess of 140 birds/minute), further exacerbating the fecal contamination issue. Marketing and sales A poussin, or juvenile chicken. Chicken is sold both as whole birds and broken down into pieces. In the United Kingdom, juvenile chickens of less than 28 days of age at slaughter are marketed as poussin. Mature chicken is sold as small, medium or large. In the United States, whole mature chickens are marketed as fryers, broilers, and roasters. Fryers are the smallest size (2.5-4 lbs dressed for sale), and the most common, as chicken reach this size quickly (about 7 weeks). Broilers are larger than fryers. Roasters, or roasting hens, are the largest chickens commonly sold (3‚Äì5 months and 6-8 lbs) and are typically more expensive. Even larger and older chickens are called stewing chickens but these are no longer usually found commercially. The names reflect the most appropriate cooking method for the surface area to volume ratio. As the size increases, the volume (which determines how much heat must enter the bird for it to be cooked) increases faster than the surface area (which determines how fast heat can enter the bird). For a fast method of cooking, such as frying, a small bird is appropriate: frying a large piece of chicken results in the inside being undercooked when the outside is ready. Chicken is also sold broken down into pieces. Such pieces usually come from smaller birds that would qualify as fryers if sold whole. Pieces may include quarters, or fourths of the chicken. A chicken is typically cut into two leg quarters and two breast quarters. Each quarter contains two of the commonly available pieces of chicken. A leg quarter contains the thigh, drumstick and a portion of the back; a leg has the back portion removed. A breast quarter contains the breast, wing and portion of the back; a breast has the back portion and wing removed. Pieces may be sold in packages of all of the same pieces, or in combination packages. Whole chicken cut up refers to either the entire bird cut into 8 individual pieces. (8-piece cut); or sometimes without the back. A 9-piece cut (usually for fast food restaurants) has the tip of the breast cut off before splitting. Pick of the chicken, or similar titles, refers to a package with only some of the chicken pieces, typically the breasts, thighs, and legs without wings or back. Thighs and breasts are sold boneless and/or skinless. Chicken livers and/or gizzards are commonly available packaged separately. Other parts of the chicken, such as the neck, feet, combs, etc. are not widely available except in countries where they are in demand, or in cities that cater to ethnic groups who favor these parts. A box of five chicken wings, served at a Hesburger fast food restaurant in Helsinki, Finland. Worldwide, there are many fast food restaurant chains that sell exclusively or primarily poultry products including KFC (global), Red Rooster (Australia), Hector Chicken (Belgium) and CFC (Indonesia). Most of the products on the menus in such eateries are fried or breaded and are served with french fries. Cooking Raw chicken may contain Salmonella. The safe minimum cooking temperature recommended by the U.S. Department of Health & Human Services is to prevent foodborne illness because of bacteria and parasites. However, in Japan raw chicken is sometimes consumed in a dish called , which is sliced raw chicken served in sashimi style. Another preparation is which is lightly seared on the outsides while the inside remains raw. Chicken can be cooked in many ways. It can be made into sausages, skewered, put in salads, traditionally grilled or by using electric grill, breaded and deep-fried, or used in various curries. There is significant variation in cooking methods amongst cultures. Historically common methods include roasting, baking, broasting, and frying. Western cuisine frequently has chicken prepared by deep frying for fast foods such as fried chicken, chicken nuggets, chicken lollipops or Buffalo wings. They are also often grilled for salads or tacos. Chickens often come with labels such as \\"roaster\\", which suggest a method of cooking based on the type of chicken. While these labels are only suggestions, ones labeled for stew often do not do well when cooked with other methods.How to Buy: 5 Things to Keep in Mind , Food Network. 2 March 2007. Some chicken breast cuts and processed chicken breast products include the moniker \\"with rib meat\\". This is a misnomer, as it refers to the small piece of white meat that overlays the scapula, removed along with the breast meat. The breast is cut from the chicken and sold as a solid cut, while the leftover breast and true rib meat is stripped from the bone through mechanical separation for use in chicken franks, for example. Breast meat is often sliced thinly and marketed as chicken slices, an easy filling for sandwiches. Often, the tenderloin (pectoralis minor) is marketed separately from the breast (pectoralis major). In the US, \\"tenders\\" can be either tenderloins or strips cut from the breast. In the UK the strips of pectoralis minor are called \\"chicken mini-fillets\\". Chicken bones are hazardous to health as they tend to break into sharp splinters when eaten, but they can be simmered with vegetables and herbs for hours or even days to make chicken stock. In Asian countries it is possible to buy bones alone as they are very popular for making chicken soups, which are said to be healthy. In Australia the rib cages and backs of chickens after the other cuts have been removed are frequently sold cheaply in supermarket delicatessen sections as either \\"chicken frames\\" or \\"chicken carcasses\\" and are purchased for soup or stock purposes.

Freezing Raw chicken maintains its quality longer in the freezer, as moisture is lost during cooking.Home / Fact Sheets / Safe Food Handling / Freezing and Food Safety from USDA Food Safety and Inspection Service. Last Modified: 3 June 2010. There is little change in nutrient value of chicken during freezer storage. For optimal quality, however, a maximal storage time in the freezer of 12 months is recommended for uncooked whole chicken, 9 months for uncooked chicken parts, 3 to 4 months for uncooked chicken giblets, and 4 months for cooked chicken. Freezing does not usually cause color changes in poultry, but the bones and the meat near them can become dark. This bone darkening results when pigment seeps through the porous bones of young poultry into the surrounding tissues when the poultry meat is frozen and thawed. It is safe to freeze chicken directly in its original packaging, but this type of wrap is permeable to air and quality may diminish over time. Therefore, for prolonged storage, it is recommended to overwrap these packages. It is recommended to freeze unopened vacuum packages as is. If a package has accidentally been torn or has opened while food is in the freezer, the food is still safe to use, but it is still recommended to overwrap or rewrap it. Chicken should be away from other foods, so if they begin to thaw, their juices will not drip onto other foods. If previously frozen chicken is purchased at a retail store, it can be refrozen if it has been handled properly. Chicken can be cooked or reheated from the frozen state, but it will take approximately one and a half times as long to cook, and any wrapping or absorbent paper should be discarded. There are three generally accepted safe methods of reheating frozen chicken: in the refrigerator, in cold water, or using a microwave oven.How to Defrost Chicken: Three Safe Methods Last Modified: 27 March 2016. These methods are endorsed by the FDA as safe, as they minimize the risk of bacterial growth. Bacteria survives but does not grow in freezing temperatures. However, if frozen cooked foods are not defrosted properly and are not reheated to temperatures that kill bacteria, chances of getting a foodborne illness greatly increase.

In 1959, the Nevada Gaming Commission (\\"Commission\\") was created by the passage of the Gaming Control Act (\\"Act\\"), Nevada Revised Statutes Chapters 462‚Äì466, by the Nevada Legislature. The Act laid the foundation for what would become modern gaming regulation. The Commission consists of five members appointed by the governor to four-year terms, with one member acting as Chairman. The Commission members serve in a part-time capacity. The primary responsibilities of the Commission include acting on the recommendations of the Gaming Control Board (Board) in licensing matters and ruling upon work permit appeal cases. The Commission is the final authority on licensing matters, having the ability to approve, restrict, limit, condition, deny, revoke or suspend any gaming license. The Commission is also charged with the responsibility of adopting regulations to implement and enforce the State laws governing gaming. When the Gaming Control Board believes discipline against a gaming licensee is appropriate, the Board acts in the prosecutorial capacity, while the Commission acts in the judicial capacity to determine whether any sanctions should be imposed.State of Nevada: Nevada Gaming Commission License types While numerous types of licenses and approvals can be granted by the commission, the key gaming licenses are: * the restricted gaming license, which applies to the operation of 15 or fewer gaming devices (and no table games) at a single location. The number of restricted licenses changes monthly, but Clark County has around 2,000 restricted licenses, with a cumulative of about 15,000 slot machines as of 2008; * the nonrestricted gaming license, which is granted for the operation of: #a property having 16 or more slot machines; #a property having any number of slot machines together with any other game, gaming device, race book or sports pool at a single location.

The 'Ha' is short for river and 'hoe' means to 'turn around, return, come back.\\" The village is a valuable part of Korean culture because it preserves Joseon period-style architecture, folk traditions, valuable books, and an old tradition of clan-based villages. The village is located in Andong, Gyeongsangbuk-do. To the north of the village is Buyongdae Cliff while Mt. Namsan lies to the south. The village is organized around the geomantic guidelines of pungsu (Korean feng shui) and so the village has the shape of a lotus flower or two interlocking comma shapes. The village is listed by the South Korean government with UNESCO as a World Heritage Site with Yangdong Folk Village in 2010. History The Ryu (or Yu in some transcriptions) clan of Pungsan established the Hahoe Folk Village in the 16th century during the Joseon Dynasty and has been a one-clan community since that time. The village is notable because it has preserved many of its original structures, such as the village Confucian school and other buildings, and maintains folk arts such as the Hahae Mask Dance Drama ('Byeonlsin-gut') which is a shamanist rite honoring the communal spirits of the village. The village today is divided into Namchon (South Village) and Pukchon (North Village) with the main branch of the Pungsan Ryu clan, the Gyeomampa, in the Namchon side and the secondary branch, the Seoaepa, descended from Ryu Seong-ryong a noted prime minister during the reign of King Seonjo of Joseon in the Bukchon side. The north village contains Yangjindang Manor, designated as Treasure No. 306, and Pikchondaek House, designated Important Folklore Material No. 84. The south village contains Chunghyodang Manor, designated as Treasure No. 414 and Namchondaek House, an Important Folklore Material No. 90. While each branch of the Pungsan Ryu clan used lived in their respective manor homes and sides, today both branches live throughout the village. The village maintains old architectural styles that have been lost because of rapid modernization and development in South Korea. Aristocratic tile-roofed residences and thatched- roof servants' homes preserve the architectural styles of the Joseon Dynasty. Wonjijeongsa Pavilion and Byeongsan Confucian School are two notable structures in the village. The village has preserved the shamanist rite of Byeolsin-gut and preserved Hahae masks used in the Hahae Mask Dance. Another rite still practiced is the Jeulbul Nori which uses strings of fireworks fired at the base of the Buyongdae Cliff. Yongmogak Shrine houses Ryu Seong-ryong's collection of books and includes South Korean National Treasure No. 132, the Jingbirok, a book which records the Imjin War of Korea in 1592. Treasure No. 160, Kunmundungok, is a record of the military encampments. Chunghyodang also holds 231 royal writs of appointment.  Intangible cultural asset  = Hahoe Byeolsingut Mask Play = The mask play, which has been played in Hahoe- ri, Pungcheon-myeon, Andong City, North Gyeongsang Province, is National Intangible Cultural Festival No. 69. The origin of this mask play is Seonangje's mask dance, which is an involuntary dramatic victory observed in Dongje, unlike Sandae Myeonghwajeon, a Korean traditional mask play. Byeolsingut is a play that is included in the overall village rite, but has a dramatic independence. = Sunyu Line Fire = 'Sunyu Line Fire' is a folk game in which people hang a bag filled with charcoal powder on a long string hanging in the air and enjoy a spectacular event in which flames come on fire. In Andong's Hahoe Village, the aristocrats went boating together with a poem and a song under the full moon in July. At this time, he enjoyed pouring oil on egg shells or buppy pieces and flying them with a wick, or dropping pine tree stems that had been lit on Buyongdae.

Mikveh Israel is a Spanish and Portuguese synagogue that follows the rite of the Amsterdam esnoga. It is the oldest synagogue in Philadelphia, and among the oldest in the United States. The congregation moved to its current building at 44 North Fourth Street in 1976. The synagogue is located within Philadelphia's Old City Historic District and adjacent to Independence Mall. Mikveh Israel is an active community synagogue with services on the Sabbath, holy days, and special occasions, and offers adult education and cultural programming with a focus on the Spanish and Portuguese tradition and history. It is active within the Center City Jewish community and its kitchen is under the kosher supervision of the Community Kashrus of Greater Philadelphia The Keystone K. Rabbi Albert Gabbai has led the congregation since 1988. Burial ground and founding, 1740‚Äì1782 Mikveh Israel Cemetery (2007) Nathan Levy was a Jewish merchant in Philadelphia when one of his children died in 1738. Desiring a dedicated place for burial, he applied to John Penn, Pennsylvania's colonial proprietor, for \\"a small piece of ground\\" with permission to make it a family cemetery. This property was at the corner of 9th and Walnut Streets, the present site of the Walnut Street Theatre. Congregation Mikveh Israel traces its history to September 25, 1740 when the Province of Pennsylvania and Thomas Penn authorized the burial ground at the north-west corner of Spruce Street and South Darien Street (between 8th and 9th Streets) meant to be a permanent burial ground for the entire Jewish community of Philadelphia. Levy was buried there upon his death in 1753. This burial ground became the Mikveh Israel Cemetery. Jews in Philadelphia in the 1740s and 1750s organized themselves informally for services. In 1761 they acquired a Torah scroll and met in a private residence on Sterling Alley, then between Cherry and Race Streets and Third and Fourth Streets. The congregation moved to a rented building on Cherry Street and held their first Sabbath services on July 25, 1771. The group chartered itself as an organization in 1773. It is estimated that in 1775, the city of Philadelphia had a population of approximately 35,000 of whom 300 were Jewish. Mikveh Israel counted among its members revolutionary patriots including Jonas Phillips, the Gratz family, and Haym Solomon who financed the war. Gershom Mendes Seixas (1745-1816) was minister of Congregation Shearith Israel in Manhattan when the British occupied New York City during the Revolutionary War in 1776. Seixas closed the synagogue and left the city rather than align with the British. He moved first to Connecticut and then to Philadelphia where he led Mikveh Israel. Third and Cherry Streets, 1782‚Äì1825 3rd and Cherry Streets (1782)Mikveh Israel built its first synagogue in 1782 at Third and Cherry Streets. Its initial location was moved after protest that its proposed site next to a church would offend the Dutch Reform Protestant congregants. Prominent Philadelphians including Benjamin Franklin and Robert Morris contributed to its building fund along with local merchant and synagogue member Ephraim Hart who would later organize the Board of Stock-Brokers. In September 1782, the congregation dedicated the new building on Cherry Street near Third Street. The building seated 200 persons and had accommodations for the clergy adjoining it. At the dedication, Seixas invoked heaven's blessing upon \\"the members of these states in Congress assembled and on His Excellency George Washington, commander general of these Colonies.\\" Manuel Josephson (1729‚Äì1796) had also come to Mikveh Israel from New York in 1776. Josephson petitioned the synagogue board to build a mikveh in 1784 and by 1786 it was open under Johnson's organization. Seixas returned to New York in 1784 and Mikveh Israel invited his replacement at Shearith Israel, Jacob Raphael Cohen (1738-1811) to Philadelphia in Seixas' place. Cohen served at Mikveh Israel from 1784 until his death in September 1811. Cohen was replaced in 1814 by Emanuel Nunes Carvalho (1771-1817) who had emigrated from Britain to Barbados to Charleston, South Carolina before being called to Mikveh Israel. Carvalho published A Key to the Hebrew Tongue (Philadelphia, 1815) and his A Sermon, preached on Sunday, July 7, 1816, on Occasion of the Death of the Rev. Mr. Gershom Mendes Seixas (Philadelphia, 1816) became the first Jewish sermon printed in the United States. Cohen served until his death in 1817. Abraham Israel Keys (1780-1828) served as minister from 1824 to 1828. Third and Cherry Streets, 1825‚Äì1860 Cherry Street building sanctuary (1825) The congregation laid the cornerstone for its second building on September 26, 1822 at the same Cherry Street location. William Strickland designed the Egyptian Revival synagogue, the first of its kind in the United States.Diana Muir Appelbaum, \\"Jewish Identity and Egyptian Revival Architecture\\", Journal of Jewish Identities, 2012 (5(2) p. 7.\\"Thomas U. Walter's Crown Street Synagogue, 1848‚Äì49\\", by Rachel Wischnitzer, The Journal of the Society of Architectural Historians, Vol. 13, No. 4 (December 1954), pp. 29-31 A contemporary account reads that \\"the galleries are semi-circular, extending around the north and south of the building, and are supported by the columns which extend to the dome.\\" The new building was dedicated on January 21, 1825. In 1829, Isaac Leeser (1806‚Äì1868) became the synagogue's leader and held that position until 1850. Leeser was one of a small number of rabbis who defended orthodox practices against the growth of Reform Judaism in the mid-nineteenth century United States. Mikveh Israel established its second cemetery in 1849 in South Philadelphia in what was then outside the city's southern limits. The second Mikveh Israel Cemetery (11th and Federal) is located at 1114 Federal Street and now known as the Federal Street Burial Grounds and Mikveh Israel Cemetery #2. A Pennsylvania Historic marker was added in March 2009.http://files.usgwarchives.net/pa/philadelphia/cemeteries/mikvehisrael- federal.txt Sabato Morais (1823‚Äì1897) succeeded Leeser as Mikveh Israel's minister in 1851. 117 N Seventh Street, 1860‚Äì1909 117 N 7th Street (1901) The Cherry Street synagogue was replaced in 1860 by a building at 117 North 7th Street designed by architect John McArthur Jr. who would later design Philadelphia City Hall.Congregation Mikveh Israel. \\"Our History.\\" 2011. Accessed February 2, 2015. http://www.mikvehisrael.org/e2_cms_display.php?p=past_our_history Sabato Morais served as minister at Mikveh Israel for forty-six years from 1851 to 1897. He was an opponent of slavery prior to the Civil War and encouraged the creation of the Ladies' Hebrew Association for the Relief of Sick and Wounded Union Soldiers in May 1863. Morais admired Abraham Lincoln and authored a sermon and prayer on the death of Lincoln's son Willie Lincoln in 1862; delivered a public sermon four days after Lincoln's death in April 1865; and delivered another public sermon on June 1, 1865, the national day of mourning. Later in June 1865, Morais sent a donation of $300 collected from Mikveh Israel members for the construction of the Lincoln Memorial. Morais' son Henry Samuel Morais taught in the synagogue's Hebrew school program, was a principal founder of the Jewish Exponent newspaper in 1887, and served as acting minister of the congregation from his father's death in 1897 through 1898. Mikveh Israel was a center of Jewish education in America during this time. The first U.S. Jewish teachers' college, Gratz College, established under the provisions of the will of Hyman Gratz (1776-1857), began in 1897. Mikveh Israel members started Dropsie College, the first post-graduate institution for Jewish learning in the world in 1907, bringing Cyrus Adler to Philadelphia. Leon Haim Elmaleh (1873‚Äì1972) came to Mikveh Israel as religious leader in 1898 and served until 1929 when he became Reverend Emeritus until his death. Elmaleh was a founder of the Philadelphia Board of Rabbis and the Levantine Jews Society of Philadelphia. 2321 N Broad Street, 1909‚Äì1976 2321 N Broad Street (September 14, 1909) Pilcher and Tachau designed the fourth building which Mikveh Israel constructed in 1909 at Broad and York Streets. During WWI, the Mikveh Israel Association applied for a Red Cross Auxiliary in the Southeastern Pennsylvania Chapter in May 1917. Leading women of the congregation established a work room in the adjoining Gratz College building where one day a week they made surgical garments and collected supplies. Dr. Abraham Neuman (1890‚Äì1970) was rabbi from 1927 to 1943. Dr. Neuman was succeeded by David Jessurun Cardozo (1896-1972). Reverend Alan D. Corre (1931-2017) came to Philadelphia from Manchester, England at age 24 in 1955 and served as rabbi until 1963. Noam Chomsky (born 1928) grew up in Philadelphia at Mikveh Israel on North Broad Street where his father, Dr. William Chomsky (1896-1977), ran the Hebrew school, was president of Gratz College, and taught at Dropsie College. Rabbi Ezekiel Musleah (born 1927) joined Mikveh Israel as minister in 1964 and served in this role until 1979. Dropsie College remained at the Broad and York complex following Mikveh Israel's departure. A 1981 fire damaged part of Dropsie College's building and the school eventually relocated to Merion in 1984. The complex was sold to a church, which did little to rehabilitate the fire-damaged building. The organization Food for Life purchased the complex in November 1992 for $275,000 from the church. The 2321 N Broad Street building was sold for $825,000 in 2015, and was open to the public as a retail clothing store in 2017. 44 N Fourth Street, 1976‚Äìpresent 44 N 4th Street, Philadelphia (July 2014) The creation of Independence National Historical Park was authorized in 1948 and established in 1956. The Jewish population along N Broad Street contracted in the years after World War II. The planned redevelopment of the blocks near Independence Hall and the congregation's original locations encouraged Mikveh Israel to return to the city's historic area. Members had pledged $250,000 by spring 1961 and Christ Church donated $1,000 to the building fund to support and welcome the synagogue's return. Mikveh Israel initially considered locations at 8th and Spruce Streets, 5th and Locust Streets, and near the Christ Church burial ground. Later that year the synagogue had selected the site behind the burial ground, north of Market Street and south of Arch Street. Dr. Bernard J. Alpers, vice-president of the synagogue, persuaded his friend the Philadelphia architect Louis Kahn to plan the new synagogue building. Kahn produced ten designs for the building between 1961 and 1972.There is a drawing of the proposed building in the New York Museum of Modern Art, and a reproduction of this drawing in Encyclopaedia Judaica, volume 10, column 691. Kahn's form concept for the synagogue is quoted in Encyclopaedia Judaica, volume 15, column 624. The Congregation decided that construction and maintenance costs would be too high and did not build Kahn's designs. The new building was instead designed by the architectural firm Harbeson, Hough, Livingston & Larson on a more modest scale, and shared with the nascent National Museum of American Jewish History. The fifth building was dedicated and opened on July 4, 1976 Rabbi Joshua Toledano (1944‚Äì2013) came to Mikveh Israel as minister in the early 1980s, and served until 1988 when he left to start the Mekor Baruch Center in Lower Merion. Rabbi Allan Lazaroff began to serve as minister in September 1989. Rabbi Albert E. Gabbai has served as congregation minister since 1988; Rabbi Gabbai grew up in Cairo and was educated at Yeshiva University in New York and the Shehebar Sephardic Center in Jerusalem. Charles Garson of Gibraltar served as Hazzan from 2010 through 2014, and returns periodically for Jewish festivals and holidays. Mikveh Israel is an active synagogue which is a member of the Center City Kehilla and regularly hosts Sephardic heritage cultural and educational events. The synagogue hosted the 2017 annual world conference of the Society for Crypto-Judaic Studies. Mikveh Israel and Christ Church have a long- standing relationship dating from the founding of the synagogue to the present day. The present location of Mikveh Israel places the two congregations as close neighbors. Christ Church was supportive of Mikveh Israel's first plan to construct a building in the 18th-century. When Mikveh Israel's synagogue burned in 1872, Christ Church contributed funds to the construction of the new building. The congregations have a long-standing custom of sharing a fellowship-dinner once a year which alternates between the buildings of the two congregations. Mikveh Israel is the site of the US memorial for Israel's Lieutenant Colonel Yonatan Netanyahu who was killed in the 1976 Operation Entebbe which rescued 102 of 108 hostages. Netanyahu had attended the Philadelphia area Cheltenham High School with brother Benjamin Netanyahu. Mikveh Israel was selected as the site of the United States memorial, constructed of granite and marble. Benjamin Netanyahu attended the 1986 dedication of the memorial as Deputy Ambassador to the United States and visited again in 2016 to mark the fortieth anniversary of his brother's death. The National Museum of American Jewish History moved to its own building on the southeast corner of 5th and Market Streets on November 15, 2010. Uriah P. Levy (1792‚Äì1862), who would be the first Jewish Commodore in the United States Navy, grew up in Philadelphia and celebrated his bar mitzvah at Mikveh Israel in 1807. A statue of Levy was commissioned by two Jewish U.S. Navy captains and dedicated at the 44 N Fourth Street site in 2011.

It was established to prepare leaders for the Church both at ministerial and laity level. The Church of the Nazarene sought to address the challenges witnessed in African society in the early 1980s through an institution of higher education. In accordance with the Kenya University‚Äôs Act of 1985, (provision for establishment of private universities in Kenya), the Church settled on Kenya as a location to start a Nazarene University which became the first one outside North America. In July 1993, the Board of the Church granted its authority for the establishment of a university in Africa following a unanimous vote by its members during a General Assembly in Indianapolis, Indiana, USA. The Church, through the university‚Äôs founders, continued to pursue negotiations with the Commission of University Education, then Commission of Higher Education (CHE) to establish a degree awarding institution. Therefore, the legal authority to establish the university was given on November 23, 1993, when CHE issued, on behalf of the Kenyan Government, a Letter of Interim Authority for the university to start laying the foundation for the development of ANU. In August 1994 Dr. Martha John, ANU‚Äôs first Vice Chancellor, opened the university‚Äôs doors to 62 students from eleven African countries taking undergraduate courses in Theology and Business Administration and a Masters of Arts in Religion. One year later, the university introduced the Bachelor of Science degree in Computer Science, welcoming an additional 42 students. Professor Leah Marangu took over from Dr. John in January 1996 and was installed as Vice Chancellor in February 1997. On 8 October 2002, the university was granted the Charter (Accreditation Credentials) by the government of Kenya, making ANU the first private university to receive the credential under the new act and without being affiliated with any other university locally and abroad.

It is neighbored by the communities of Butter Cove and Southport. Gooseberry Cove was first settled by inshore fishing families sometime around 1832. The earliest names which were present were Langor, Seward, Balsom and Smith, and many of these family names can be still found in the community today. It became a village in 1940, with a population of 640; by 1956 the population had dropped to 141. The first Postmistress was Delilah Florence Smith. Within the community is the main road which runs right through the community itself, with one small side-road which leads to the fish plant and community wharf. There is another road which circumvents the community and leads to nearby Southport, and though built in the 1980s is still referred to as \\"The New Road\\". Many residents have built homes along The New Road. Businesses Almost entirely a fishing community, the village has a small convenience store, a post office, and a modest fish plant (each of which employs just one person). The community once had a small school which accommodated Kindergarten to Grade 6, but that school was shut down in the late 1980s, which all children now being bused to nearby Little Heart's Ease for schooling.

His main contribution was to systematically record the additions made by Islamic physicians in the Middle Ages, which added between 300 and 400 types of medicine to the one thousand previously known since antiquity. Life Ibn al-Baitar was born in the city of M√°laga in Andalusia (Muslim-controlled Spain) at the end of the twelfth century, hence his nisba \\"al-MƒÅlaqƒ´\\". His name \\"Ibn al-Baitar\\" is Arabic for \\"son of the veterinarian\\", which was his father's job. Ibn al-Bay·π≠ƒÅr learned botany from the M√°lagan botanist Ab≈´ al- øAbbƒÅs al-NabƒÅtƒ´ with whom he started collecting plants in and around Spain. Al-NabƒÅtƒ´ was responsible for developing an early scientific method, introducing empirical and experimental techniques in the testing, description and identification of numerous materia medica, and separating unverified reports from those supported by actual tests and observations. Such an approach was thus adopted by Ibn al-Bay·π≠ƒÅr. In 1219, Ibn al-Bay·π≠ƒÅr left M√°laga, travelling to the coast of North Africa and as far as Anatolia, to collect plants. The major stations he visited include Bugia, Constantinople, Tunis, Tripoli, Barqa and Antalya. After 1224, he entered the service of the Ayyubid Sultan al-KƒÅmil and was appointed chief herbalist. In 1227 al-KƒÅmil extended his domination to Damascus, and Ibn al-Bay·π≠ƒÅr accompanied him there, which provided him an opportunity to collect plants in Syria. His botanical researches extended over a vast area including Arabia and Palestine. He died in Damascus in 1248. Ibn al-Bay·π≠ƒÅr used the name \\"snow of China\\" (in Arabic, thalj al-·π¢ƒ´n) to describe saltpetre while writing about gunpowder.

It is organized alphabetically by the name of the useful plant or plant component or other substance‚Äîa small minority of the items covered are not botanicals. For each item, Ibn al-Bay·π≠ƒÅr makes one or two brief remarks himself and gives brief extracts from a handful of different earlier authors about the item. The bulk of the information is compiled from the earlier authors. The book contains references to 150 previous Arabic authors, as well as 20 previous Greek authors.Russell McNeil, Ibn al-Bay·π≠ƒÅr, Malaspina University- College.Encyclopedia of the History of Arabic Science, volume 1: Astronomy, Theoretical and Applied, pgs. 271‚Äì272.

The Sunday edition featured a mix of puzzles and fan art early on, but later switched entirely to a fan-art format. Among the creators who worked on the strip were Ryan Brown, Dan Berger, Jim Lawson, Michael Dooney, Steve Lavigne and Dean Clarrain. Some of the TMNT daily strips have been reprinted in Comics Revue.

The National Rendezvous and Living History Foundation (NRLHF) is a 501(c)(3) non-profit organization which holds rendezvous across the United States for the period between 1640 and 1840 AD, or roughly during the heyday of the North American fur trade. Its unofficial motto, according to its website is, \\"Formed for the management of the rendezvous program by rendezvous people.\\" Formation The NRLHF was formed by the National Muzzle Loading Rifle Association in December 1998 and incorporated in March 1999. Its Articles of Incorporation can be found here: NRLHF Articles of Incorporation. The reason behind the Foundation's formation was to put the management of the National Muzzle Loading Rifle Association's various regional rendezvous in the hands of those who attended the events. Political structure The overarching guidelines that the Foundation adheres to are outlined in their Constitution and By-Laws. The By-Laws can be found here: NRLHF By Laws. The NRLHF is a democratic organization at its core. Each of the regional rendezvous managed by the Foundation elects a number of delegates to represent them on the Council of Delegates. The Council of Delegates contains eleven elected delegates and two appointed representatives from the parent organization: the NMLRA. The NRLHF's Board of Directors is composed of eight individuals: four officers (President, Vice-President, Secretary, and Treasurer) and four directors. Each of the officers is a delegate elected from the Council of Delegates. Each of the directors was appointed by the parent organization, the NMLRA. The four officers are elected to their position by the Council of Delegates every year during the annual board meeting at the Eastern Primitive Rendezvous. The rendezvous The Midwestern Primitive Rendezvous, 2004 Currently, the NRLHF manages five-week-long regional primitive rendezvous and one specialized weekend event. All of these events must follow the rules and regulations of the Foundation set forth by the Board of Directors. These rules and regulations can be found here: NRLHF Rules and Regulations. Traders or sutlers also have specific rules and regulations to follow. These rules and regulations can be found here: NRLHF Trade Rules and Regulations.

As a professional, he started out announcing games for the Peoria Chiefs single-A baseball club in 1987. Impemba also served as the sports director at WXCL Radio and the play- by-play voice of the Peoria Rivermen of the now-defunct International Hockey League during the 1987-88 season. From 1989 to 1990, Mario served as the voice of the Quad City Angels single-A team in Davenport, Iowa. In 1991, Impemba began calling games for the Tucson Toros of the Pacific Coast League.Detroit Sports Broadcasters Association Member Profile - Mario Impemba Impemba served as the radio (KLAA) and fill-in television (Fox Sports West and KCOP-TV) play- by-play voice of the Anaheim Angels for seven seasons (1995‚Äì2001). =Detroit Tigers= Beginning in 2002, Impemba joined the Tigers television team alongside color commentator Kirk Gibson, replacing play-by-play commentator Josh Lewin. In 2003, Gibson was named the Tigers' bench coach and was replaced in the booth by Rod Allen. The Impemba‚ÄìAllen tandem would last from 2003 to 2018. In the last few years of his tenure, Impemba occasionally worked alongside Gibson and Jack Morris. On September 4, 2018, Impemba and Allen were involved in an off-air physical altercation immediately after broadcasting the Tigers' road game against the Chicago White Sox. Fox Sports Detroit sent the men home on different planes after the game, and the following night's telecast was covered by Kirk Gibson and field-level reporter Matt Shepard. While one source claimed that there was an argument over a chair, followed by Allen putting Impemba in a choke hold, Allen's agent denied that his client choked Impemba. On September 7, Fox Sports Detroit suspended both men from calling any Tigers games for the remainder of the 2018 season. It was later announced that Impemba and Allen's contracts were not renewed for future seasons, ending their 17-year partnership. =Boston Red Sox= On February 13, 2019, Impemba was named as a part-time play-by-play announcer for the Boston Red Sox Radio Network on WEEI. It was announced in January 2020 that he would not return to the Red Sox. Mannerism and notable calls Impemba always announces the game's attendance when there is one out left in the game, and usually rounds down, for example \\"Bottom of the ninth, two outs, the Tigers are about to win in front of a crowd of better than 41,000 fans‚Äî41,212 to be exact.\\" Impemba is also known for calling any catch in which the outfielder holds the glove with palm up a \\"basket catch.\\" His most common home run call is, \\"to the track, to the wall, gone!\\" Impemba, along with Rod Allen, called Armando Galarraga's near-perfect game on June 2, 2010. After Jim Joyce mistakenly called the runner safe at first base on what would have been the final out (Galarraga would retire the next Indians batter to end the game), Impemba stated that he \\"never felt this disappointed after a Tigers victory.\\" Awards and other works Impemba had a Tigers blog named \\"Last Call,\\" hosted on his now-defunct website, marioimpemba.com. His book, If These Walls Could Talk: Detroit Tigers, was published in 2014.

Early Life and Education He was born in Livesey, the second son of the Reverend John Baker, vicar of St Johns, Livesey, and Caroline Baker. He was educated locally and at Manchester Grammar School. He secured a Brackenbury scholarship to Balliol College, Oxford, where he was awarded a first-class degree and a Demonstratorship. Career and Research In 1894 he became a chemistry master at Dulwich College, spending some twenty years in teaching and research, and for a short time (1902-1904) was headmaster of Alleyn's School, Dulwich. During this time he was elected to a Lee's Readership at Christ Church Oxford, becoming responsible for inorganic chemistry lectures at the University. In 1912 he was appointed Professor at Imperial College, replacing Sir T. E. Thorpe as Director of the Chemistry Department; here he remained until retiring in 1932. He conducted pioneering studies on the effects of drying on chemicals and the catalytic effect of moisture in chemical reactions. According to his 1902 FRS application citation he proved that \\"dry carbon and phosphorus will not inflame when heated in dry oxygen; that dry ammonia and hydrogen chloride when mixed do not unite, and that dry ammonium chloride and calomel respectively vaporise without dissociation... [and that] dry hydrogen and oxygen mixed together are not ignited by exposure to the temperature of melting silver\\".Who's Who Volume 55 (1903), p.61. During WWI Baker was appointed scientific adviser to the War Office. He worked with his father-in- law in the development of specially resistant glass for the contact ‚Äòhorns‚Äô of submarine mines. Whitefriars Glass produced 600,000 of these glass horns, individually testing them at extremes of temperature, before dropping them to test their strength. Muriel Baker in 1928 ¬© National Portrait Gallery, London Family Baker married Muriel Powell, daughter of Harry James Powell, glassmaker, on 21 March 1905 at St Barnabas' Church, Dulwich. They had two children: Ronald Powell Brereton (abt. 1906) and Audrey Muriel (1908). Herbert died on 27 April 1935 at Gerrards Cross. Muriel died in the same town on 15 October 1944, leaving her estate to her unmarried daughter. Their son Ronald predeceased his father. Muriel Baker had also studied chemistry at Oxford. There, husband and wife jointly studied the oxides of nitrogen, and published a paper together. When Baker moved to Imperial College, they continued to work together in a laboratory at their home in Gerrards Cross. Honours and Awards He was made Commander of the Order of the British Empire in 1917. In June, 1902, he was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society and in 1923 was awarded their Davy Medal for \\"his researches on the complete drying of gases and liquids\\".

Created by the team of Joe Simon and Jack Kirby, the character marked an early attempt to produce a 3-D comic book. Publication history Created by the writing and art team of Joe Simon and Jack Kirby, whose characters include Marvel Comics' Captain America, DC Comics' Manhunter and many others, Captain 3-D starred in one issue of an eponymous Harvey Comics title, cover-dated December 1953. A second issue of Captain 3-D was partially completed, but the fad for 3-D was waning even as Captain 3-D first appeared. Fictional character biography Around fifty thousand years ago, a battle between two opposing civilizations takes place, one society populated by humanoids, the other a race of Cat People. The Cat People succeed in all but wiping out the humanoids, with only a tiny number of survivors hanging on in underground bases. A humanoid scientist, Professor Five, devises a way that one of his people might survive to oppose the Cat People in the future. The Chosen One will be kept in a sort of \\"two-dimensional half life\\" in a specially prepared book, the Book of D, able to be released for brief periods of time by someone wearing a special pair of glasses. Professor Five entrusts the book to a group of primitive men, who promise to guard it. Shortly afterwards the Cat People kill Professor Five and the other remaining humanoids, leaving the Chosen One the last survivor of his race. However the Cat People are all but destroyed themselves when their continent sinks beneath the ocean. The handful of Cat People survivors are forced to hide in disguise among mankind, although they never give up their dreams of conquest. Knowing that in their weakened state the Chosen One might be able to lead humanity against them, they hunt for the Book of D, but every time they manage to catch up with the Book's guardian and kill him, someone else spirits the Book away to safety and becomes its new guardian. In the early 1950s a strange, badly injured man stumbles into a book shop that has been inherited by teenager Danny Davis. Probably feeling the best place to hide a book would be in a shop full of them, he hands Danny the Book of D and begs him, \\"Keep this one. Never sell it.\\" Seconds later he is killed by one of the disguised Cat People. Danny disarms the killer, who flees. Examining the book afterward, Danny finds a pair of strange glasses inside it. The only other thing inside the book is an illustration of a strangely dressed man. Looking at the picture through the glasses, Danny is astounded when the man springs to life off the page. His arrival is timely as it coincides with the appearance of more gunmen, who identify the man from the book as Captain 3-D. In spite of being outnumbered, Captain 3-D easily subdues the attackers, then has Danny examine them through the same strange glasses that brought him to life. Danny sees that the \\"gunmen\\" are Cat People. The Chosen One, who has become known over the years as Captain 3-D, tells Danny that he is the new guardian of the Book of D. Danny realizes this means he is now a target, but Captain 3-D reassures him that he will not be alone. With that, he returns to his sleep in the Book of D. Powers and abilities The last survivor of an otherwise extinct humanoid race, Captain 3-D is gifted with superior intellect and physical attributes. He is fitter, stronger and faster than normal humans, to a level unspecified in his one brief appearance. Able to survive for millennia stored within the Book of D, Captain 3-D can only be released by the special glasses developed and built by Professor Five.

While originally isolated from the bacterial species Mycobacterium smegmatis and Mycobacterium tuberculosis, the causative agent of tuberculosis, more than 4,200 mycobacteriophage have since been isolated from various environmental and clinical sources. Almost 1400 have been completely sequenced. Mycobacteriophages have served as examples of viral lysogeny and of the divergent morphology and genetic arrangement characteristic of many phage types. All mycobacteriophages found thus far have had double-stranded DNA genomes and have been classified by their structure and appearance into siphoviridae or myoviridae. Discovery A bacteriophage found to infect Mycobacterium smegmatis in 1947 was the first documented example of a mycobacteriophage. It was found in cultures of the bacteria originally growing in moist compost. The first bacteriophage that infects M. tuberculosis was discovered in 1954.  Diversity  Thousands of mycobacteriophage have been isolated using a single host strain, Mycobacterium smegmatis mc2155, over 1400 of which have been completely sequenced. These are mostly from environmental samples, but mycobacteriophages have also been isolated from stool samples of tuberculosis patients, although these have yet to be sequenced. About 30 distinct types (called clusters, or singletons if they have no relatives) that share little nucleotide sequence similarity have been identified. Many of the clusters span sufficient diversity that the genomes warrant division into subclusters (Figure 1). There is also considerable range in overall guanine plus cytosine content (GC%), from 50.3% to 70%, with an average of 64% (M. smegmatis is 67.3%). Thus, phage GC% does not necessarily match that of its host, and the consequent mismatch of codon usage profiles does not appear to be detrimental. Because new mycobacteriophages lacking extensive DNA similarity with the extant collection are still being discovered, and as there are at least seven singletons for which no relatives have been isolated, we clearly have yet to saturate the diversity of this particular population. The collection of >50,000 genes can be sorted into >3,900 groups (so-called phamilies, i.e. phage protein families) according to their shared amino acid sequences. Most of these phamilies (~75%) do not have homologues outside of the mycobacteriophages and are of unknown function. Genetic studies with mycobacteriophage Giles show that 45% of the genes are nonessential for lytic growth. Figure 1. Diversity of mycobacteriophages. Sequenced genomes for 471 mycobacteriophages were compared according to their shared gene contents and overall nucleotide sequence similarity. Colored circles encompass Clusters A‚ÄìT as indicated, and grey circles represent singleton genomes that have no close relatives. A1, A2, A3... indicate subclusters.

With the exception of DS6A, all phages infect M. smegmatis mc2155. From Hatfull 2014  Host range  Host range analysis shows that not all mycobacteriophages from M. smegmatis infect other strains and only phages in Cluster K and in certain subclusters of Cluster A efficiently infect M. tuberculosis (Figure 1). However, mutants can be readily isolated from some phages that expand their host range to infect these other strains. However, the molecular basis of host range specificity is largely unknown. Genome architecture The first sequenced mycobacteriophage genome was that of mycobacteriophage L5 in 1993. In the following years hundreds of additional genomes have been sequenced. Mycobacteriophages have highly mosaic genomes. Their genome sequences show evidence of extensive horizontal genetic transfer, both between phages and between phages and their mycobacterial hosts. Comparisons of these sequences have helped to explain how frequently genetic exchanges of this type may occur in nature, as well as how phages may contribute to bacterial pathogenicity. A selection of 60 mycobacteriophages were isolated and had their genomes sequenced in 2009. These genome sequences were grouped into clusters by several methods in an effort to determine similarities between the phages and to explore their genetic diversity. More than half of the phage species were originally found in or near Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, though others were found in other United States locations, India, and Japan. No distinct differences were found in the genomes of mycobacteriophage species from different global origins. Mycobacteriophage genomes have been found to contain a subset of genes undergoing more rapid genetic flux than other elements of the genomes. These \\"rapid flux\\" genes are exchanged between mycobacteriophage more often and are 50 percent shorter in sequence than the average mycobacteriophage gene. Applications Historically, mycobacteriophage have been used to \\"type\\" (i.e. \\"diagnose\\") mycobacteria, as each phage infects only one or a few bacterial strains. In the 1980s phages were discovered as tools to genetically manipulate their hosts. Jacobs WR Jr. 2000. Mycobacterium tuberculosis: a once genetically intractable organism. In Molecular Genetics of the Mycobacteria, ed. GF Hatfull, WR Jacobs Jr, pp. 1‚Äì16. Washington, DC: ASM Press For instance, phage TM4 was used to construct shuttle phasmids that replicate as large cosmids in Escherichia coli and as phages in mycobacteria. Shuttle phasmids can be manipulated in E. coli and used to efficiently introduce foreign DNA into mycobacteria. Phages with mycobacterial hosts may be especially useful for understanding and fighting mycobacterial infections in humans. A system has been developed to use mycobacteriophage carrying a reporter gene to screen strains of M. tuberculosis for antibiotic resistance. In the future, mycobacteriophage could be used to treat infections by phage therapy.

Formed in 1967, by immigrants primarily from Hong Kong, they are affiliated with the Hip Sing Tong. Throughout the 1980s, the gang often engaged in bloody turf wars with the newer Ghost Shadows, and their activities included extortion, kidnapping, murder, racketeering and illegal gambling. The gang moved heavily into heroin trafficking after the Italian-American Mafia lost the trade as a result of the Pizza Connection prosecutions in the mid-1980s. The boss of the gang, Johnny \\"Onionhead\\" Eng, was sentenced to 24 years' imprisonment on 14 counts of heroin running and conspiracy in 1993. Characteristics Similar to the Triads of China, and the Yakuza of Japan, the Flying Dragons are likely to operate with people of their own ethnicity. Unlike western gangs, gangs such as the Flying Dragons remain fairly unnoticeable by police outside of their own homelands. In the leader Johnny \\"Onionhead\\" Eng's criminal case, it is reported the Flying Dragons are a fairly violent gang, being involved in murders and drug trafficking. Activities The Flying Dragons are said to have operated heavily in Chinatowns in the United States and in Hong Kong.\\"Organized Crime from World of Criminal Justice, Gale\\", n.d. http://search.proquest.com/ As many Asian gangs did, the Flying Dragons dealt with illegal drugs; mainly heroin. They are also known for extortion and kidnapping. Along with South America, Asia entered the market around the 1970s and have played a larger role in supplying drugs to American consumers. The steady demand for illegal drugs by U.S. consumers, which Asian gangs were a significant part of, has led the U.S. government to wage a war on drugs since the 1980s. Gang leader Johnny Eng, otherwise known as \\"Onionhead\\", was brought up on charges of masterminding an international heroin importing scheme. Prosecutors in Brooklyn federal court say there is a mountain of evidence against him such as 300 pounds of heroin shipped to New York in stuffed animals, strapped to couriers and sealed in steel machines used to wash bean sprouts. Drug trafficking throughout Chinatown has been greatly reduced due to the discovery of the tunnels. Gang leader Machine Gun Johnny (\\"Onionhead\\") Eng is said to have come to the United States around the age of 13 from Asia (Hong Kong). He is believed to be a multi-millionaire, with financial interests in Hong Kong, farms in Pennsylvania and land in South America. There are sources which say he took over the Flying Dragons after his predecessor, Michael \\"The Scientist\\" Chen (nicknamed after his cool and calm demeanor), was shot 14 times with 4 bullets in the eyes in the doorway of the Hip Sing credit union in the spring of 1983. Johnny Eng is known for a case in which he was charged for heroin trafficking, facing life without parole, and mocking the trial with smirks and laughs. After he was released from prison he has not been seen since and it is believed that his cousin has taken over. Vietnamese Flying Dragons The Vietnamese Flying Dragons were a former branch of the Flying Dragons gang that consisted of primarily Vietnamese members. One of its former members, David Thai, a Vietnamese refugee who had joined the gang in 1983, decided to leave the gang in 1987 after being disaffected by the lower status of the members that were consigned to this particular branch of the gang, who were mostly viewed as \\"coffee boys\\" and were ordered to carry out crimes that carried the stiffest penalties such as robbery and murder, and were cut off from the main gang's more lucrative activities such as drug dealing. David Thai would later go on to build his own gang that would rival the Flying Dragons, called Born to Kill, which began to compete with the Flying Dragons and the Ghost Shadows for control and territory over Chinatown. Overseas activities The Flying Dragons have many roots in Hong Kong. In 1994, in what law-enforcement officials called a major blow to the largest and last of the traditional criminal gangs in Chinatown, 33 suspected members of the Flying Dragons were indicted on federal racketeering charges. Sources described these charges as three murders, 12 attempted murders, heroin trafficking, illegal gambling, arson, extortion and robberies that stretched from Manhattan into Brooklyn and Queens. They've also been said to be located in parts of Canada and Australia. Asian gang history The Institute for Scientific Analysis has findings\\"A_Short_History_of_Asian_Gangs_in_San_Francisco.pdf\\", n.d., http://www.hawaii.edu/hivandaids/A_Short_History_of_Asian_Gangs_in_San_Francisco.pdf that \\"indicate that Asian gangs first emerged when a large pool of Chinese immigrant youths who arrived in San Francisco in the late 1960s were forced into self reliance by the city's failure to recognize the needs of its newcomers. The integration of Asian gangs into criminal subculture in the Chinese community, lack of legitimate opportunities available to youths, and hostility from other ethnic and Asian groups fueled subsequent generations of Asian gangs.\\" It believed, because of a series of Chinese Exclusion Acts, there were not too many Chinese women and children that were allowed to immigrate into the United States before 1965. The Chinese community was composed of a majority adult males, who were primarily bachelors. Consequently, there were only a small number of children, which stifled the development of gangs in China towns. Apparently, the tradition of organised criminal activities, which utilised able young men, came about in the late 1800s. The Institute for Scientific Analysis's sources say \\"gambling and the use of opium were popular respites from work among the men who lived in Chinatown. Since there were few Chinese women in the United States, prostitution rings formed to serve the needs of bachelors. Many of these activities were run by members of tongs, who sought to ease some of the difficulties recent immigrants faced.\\" References Sources *Silent Threat *Violent NYC Gang *Chinese Organized Crime *Asian Gangs are Brothers in Crime *Gang Members Indicted External links * New York Times - Ex-Head of Chinatown Gang Is Guilty of Leading Drug Ring * New York Times - Five Indicted In a Robbery At a Church * New York Times - Wider Chinatown Gang Warfare Feared Chinese-American culture in New York City Chinese- American organized crime groups Former gangs in New York City Street gangs Overseas Chinese organisations ","title":"Flying Dragons (gang)"},{"id":"5741682","title":"Chain Gang (song)"},{"id":"5741689","text":"The Melbourne Custody Centre is the main reception facility in Melbourne, Australia for people who have been arrested by police. The centre is located underneath the Melbourne Magistrates' Court the centre is utilised during the day to hold prisoners who will be attending hearings at the Magistrates, County or Supreme Courts. When the majority of the prisoners who are there during the day have been transported back to their respective facilities the Victoria Police will, during the evening and night, hold people at the Custody centre when they have been arrested for being \\"Drunk in a Public Place\\".. Ombudsman Victoria Annual Report 2007. Retrieved on September 11, 2009. The facility has been operated by G4S since March 2010. G4S Take Over In March 2010, G4S assumed responsibility for the day-to-day running of The Melbourne Custody Centre. Previously GEO Group had been running the facility but were not considered for the re-tender after a number of incidents whilst they were responsible for the unit. G4S assumed responsibility for the Melbourne Custody Centre (MCC) on 28 March 2010 on behalf of Victoria Police. The MCC, which is located under the Melbourne Magistrates' Court, is initially the central location for all prisoners arrested by Victoria Police. It also receives and accommodates prisoners attending the Melbourne Magistrates Court. Prisoners can be accommodated at the MCC for up to 14 days and the majority are then either transferred to the Melbourne Assessment Prison in the case of males, or the Dame Phyllis Frost Centre for females. The MCC can accommodate a maximum of 67 prisoners and there are approximately 22,000 prisoner movements annually. Victoria Police is responsible for Health Care in the Centre and provides a medical service 24 hours a day, seven days a week. Prisoners may receive both social and professional visits, and the Salvation Army provides welfare and spiritual support and is on site daily. G4S is committed to ensuring that the Custody Centre is a secure and safe environment for prisoners, staff and visitors. It is operated in strict compliance with the Victorian Charter of Human Rights and Responsibilities. Incidents while under GEO Group Inc Management An Ombudsman's report tabled in Parliament in 2007 found that staff at the centre had inadequate training to deal with difficult prisoners and unsatisfactory systems for monitoring incidents. It found there was a culture of excessive force being used by staff. In one such incident in June 2007, a prisoner was seriously mistreated when force was used during a strip search. The Deputy Ombudsman, John Taylor, says the incident is indicative of a wider problem. \\"We are concerned that there is a culture in the custody centre that tolerates unnecessary force,\\" he said. The Ombudsman has called for better training and oversight of staff by the company contracted to run the facility and by Victoria Police. The Ombudsman also wants prisoners to have better access to telephones so they can contact their lawyers. But Victoria Police's Ashley Dickinson says the incident is not being investigated and he is satisfied with the way the centre is being run. \\"We monitor the management of the custody centre very closely and we would say that we are happy with the management,\\" he said. It is the second time in eighteen months that the Ombudsman has been critical of the way people are treated in police custody. Closed circuit TV footage of a prisoner being wrestled to the ground and assaulted has exposed a culture of brute force at the Melbourne Custody Centre, the ombudsman has found. Victorian Ombudsman George Brouwer has called for a review of MCC procedures after finding staff subjected the man to excessive force and \\"serious mistreatment\\". The prisoner, identified as Mr A, was left bloodied with a cut to his head after being pinned to the ground and hit during a strip search on June 13, the ombudsman's report said. Mr A's Experience at MCC Closed circuit TV footage of a prisoner being wrestled to the ground and assaulted has exposed a culture of brute force at the Melbourne Custody Centre, the ombudsman has found. Victorian Ombudsman George Brouwer has called for a review of MCC procedures after finding staff subjected the man to excessive force and \\"serious mistreatment\\". The prisoner, identified as Mr A, was left bloodied with a cut to his head after being pinned to the ground and hit during a strip search on June 13, the ombudsman's report said. The report was tabled in the Victorian parliament in 2007 It highlighted systematic breaches of procedures and insufficient training and supervision at the MCC. The centre is under the Melbourne Magistrates Court and houses prisoners on remand pending court appearances and prisoner transfers. Mr Brouwer said witnesses spoke of a clique of prison officers at the MCC, known as \`the family', who dominated the work force. There was a culture of staff favouritism, tolerance of prisoner abuse and fear that those who spoke out would lose their jobs One witness said officers thrived on aggression. \\"You've got people there that are wanting to punch on,\\" the witness said in the report. \\"There's staff members that want to get at the prisoner that's on the floor simply because the prisoner wouldn't listen in the first instance.\\" Mr Brouwer said it was clear in Mr A's case that officers overreacted and violated his human rights. \\"I am of the opinion that MCC officers have resorted to the use of force as a first response to situations where verbal techniques ... would have been more appropriate,\\" he said. \\"The use of force must be a last resort.\\" Mr A was on remand after being arrested at his home during a search warrant. CCTV footage shows one custody officer, identified as Officer X, lunging at the prisoner's throat as he complains about being strip searched. He ends up pinned to the floor by four officers, including Officer X's girlfriend, Officer Z, who struck him in the head. \\"While I'm on the ground she smacked my head into the ground and blood started coming out,\\" Mr A said in the report. Victoria Police is investigating the assault and the two officers will undergo disciplinary action. The contractor who operates the centre, GEO Group Australia, issued a statement saying they disagreed with key aspects of the report and had a zero tolerance policy on prisoner mistreatment. Mr Brouwer recommended a review of operations at the MCC, installation of a telephone system so prisoners could contact their lawyers and greater monitoring by Victoria Police. He also expressed dismay that the MCC was being used as a \\"de facto prison\\", with inmates often held for up to 28 days, despite his protests last year that stays be limited to one or two days. The Law Institute of Victoria and the Opposition agreed. \\"It's not designed to be a long term prison ... it's designed only for short term holding,\\" Opposition police spokesman Andrew McIntosh said.

View of the southern fa√ßade Dusk panorama of the mosque Located in the north-east of the medina of Kairouan, the mosque is in the intramural district of Houmat al-Jami (literally \\"area of the Great Mosque\\").

Des mots aux modes de spatialisation ¬ª, Gen√®ses, vol. 33, n¬∞33, 1998, pp. 49‚Äì76 This location corresponded originally to the heart of the urban fabric of the city founded by Uqba ibn Nafi. However given the natural lay of the land crossed by several tributaries of the wadis, the urban development of the city spread southwards. Human factors including Hilalian's invasions in 449 AH (1057 AD) led to the decline of the city and halted development. For all these reasons, the mosque which once occupied the center of the medina when first built in 670 is now on the easternmost quarter abutting the city walls. The building is a vast slightly irregular quadrilateral covering some 9,000 m2. It is longer (127.60 metres) on the east side than the west (125.20 metres), and shorter on the north side (72.70 metres) than the south (78 metres). The main minaret is centered on the north. From the outside, the Great Mosque of Kairouan is a fortress-like building with its 1.90 metres thick massive ocher walls, a composite of well-worked stones with intervening courses of rubble stone and baked bricks. The corner towers measuring 4.25 metres on each side are buttressed with solid projecting supports. Structurally given the soft grounds subject to compaction, the buttressed towers added stability to the entire mosque.N√©ji Djelloul, op. cit., p. 8 Despite the austere fa√ßades, the rhythmic patterns of buttresses and towering porches, some surmounted by cupolas, give the sanctuary a sense of striking sober grandeur.

Fondation de la Grande Mosqu√©e de Kairouan Current plan of the Great Mosque of Kairouan Under the rule of the Aghlabid dynasty, Kairouan was at its apogee, and the mosque profited from this period of stability and prosperity. In 836, Emir Ziyadat Allah I reconstructed the mosque once more:Razia Grover Mosques, p. 52, New Holland, 2007 , . this is when the building acquired, at least in its entirety, its current appearance.

In 1967, major restoration works, executed during five years and conducted under the direction of the National Institute of Archeology and Art, were achieved throughout the monument, and were ended with an official reopening of the mosque during the celebration of the Mawlid of 1972. = Host stories = Entry way (1900) Pilgrims around one of the wells (1900) Several centuries after its founding, the Great Mosque of Kairouan is the subject of numerous descriptions by Arab historians and geographers in the Middle Ages. The stories concern mainly the different phases of construction and expansion of the sanctuary, and the successive contributions of many princes to the interior decoration (mihrab, minbar, ceilings, etc.). Among the authors who have written on the subject and whose stories have survived Lucien Golvin, ¬´ Quelques r√©flexions sur la Grande Mosqu√©e de Kairouan √† la p√©riode des Aghlabides ¬ª, pp. 69‚Äì77 are Al-Bakri (Andalusian geographer and historian who died in 1094 and who devoted a sufficiently detailed account of the history of the mosque in his book Description of Septentrional Africa), Al-Nuwayri (historian who died in Egypt, 1332) and Ibn Nagi (scholar and historian of Kairouan who died around 1435). On additions and embellishments made to the building by the Aghlabid emir Abu Ibrahim, Ibn Nagi gives the following account: Old postcard (1900) showing the carved teak minbar and the maqsura Among the Western travelers, poets and writers who visited Kairouan, some of them leave impressions and testimonies sometimes tinged with emotion or admiration on the mosque. From the eighteenth century, the French doctor and naturalist John Andrew Peyssonnel, conducting a study trip to 1724, during the reign of sovereign Al-Husayn Bey I, underlines the reputation of the mosque as a deemed centre of religious and secular studies: At the same time, the doctor and Anglican priest Thomas Shaw (1692‚Äì1751), Courte biographie sur Thomas Shaw (Soci√©t√© des anglicistes de l‚Äôenseignement sup√©rieur) touring the Tunis Regency and passes through Kairouan in 1727, described the mosque as that: \\"which is considered the most beautiful and the most sacred of Berberian territories\\", evoking for example: \\"an almost unbelievable number of granite columns\\". Kairouan n‚Äô√©tait pas une ville interdite (Capitale de la culture islamique 2009) At the end of the nineteenth century, the French writer Guy de Maupassant expresses in his book La vie errante (The Wandering Life), his fascination with the majestic architecture of the Great Mosque of Kairouan as well as the effect created by countless columns: \\"The unique harmony of this temple consists in the proportion and the number of these slender shafts upholding the building, filling, peopling, and making it what it is, create its grace and greatness. Their colorful multitude gives the eye the impression of unlimited\\".Mohamed Bergaoui, Tourisme et voyages en Tunisie : les ann√©es r√©gence, √©d. Simpact, Tunis, 1996, p. 231 Early in the twentieth century, the Austrian poet Rainer Maria Rilke describes his admiration for the impressive minaret:  Architecture and decoration  Overview of the building (centre), southern fa√ßade to the outside (left) and Minaret seen from the courtyard (right) Panoramic view of the Great Mosque of Kairouan, from the right to the left, the prayer hall (with domes), the courtyard and the minaret =Exterior=  Enclosure  Today, the enclosure of the Great Mosque of Kairouan is pierced by nine gates (six opening on the courtyard, two opening on the prayer hall and a ninth allows access to the maqsura) some of them, such as Bab Al-Ma (gate of water) located on the western fa√ßade, are preceded by salient porches flanked by buttresses and surmounted by ribbed domes based on square tholobate which are porting squinches with three vaults.N√©ji Djelloul, op. cit., p. 9 However, Arab geographers and historians of the Middle Ages Al-Muqaddasi and Al-Bakri reported the existence, around the tenth and eleventh centuries, of about ten gates named differently from today. This reflects the fact that, unlike the rest of the mosque, the enclosure has undergone significant changes to ensure the stability of the building (adding many buttresses). Thus, some entries have been sealed, while others were kept. Enceinte et porches de la Grande Mosqu√©e de Kairouan During the thirteenth century, new gates were opened, the most remarkable, Bab Lalla Rihana dated from 1293, is located on the eastern wall of the enclosure. The monumental entrance, work of the Hafsid sovereign Abu Hafs \`Umar ibn Yahya (reign from 1284 to 1295), Fragment de bois √† d√©cor d‚Äôarcatures d‚Äô√©poque hafside (Qantara) is entered in a salient square, flanked by ancient columns supporting horseshoe arches and covered by a dome on squinches. The front fa√ßade of the porch has a large horseshoe arch relied on two marble columns and surmounted by a frieze adorned with a blind arcade, all crowned by serrated merlons (in a sawtooth arrangement).N√©ji Djelloul, op. cit., p. 10 Despite its construction at the end of the thirteenth century, Bab Lalla Rihana blends well with all of the building mainly dating from the ninth century.

Boydell, Woodbridge, 2004, p. 229 It is surrounded on all its four sides by a portico with double rows of arches, opened by slightly horseshoe arches supported by columns in various marbles, in granite or in porphyry, reused from Roman, Early Christian or Byzantine monuments particularly from Carthage. Access to the courtyard by six side entrances dating from the ninth and thirteenth centuries. The portico on the south side of the courtyard, near the prayer hall, includes in its middle a large dressed stone pointed horseshoe arch which rests on ancient columns of white veined marble with Corinthian capitals. This porch of seven metres high is topped with a square base upon which rests a semi-spherical ribbed dome; the latter is ribbed with sharp- edged ribs. The intermediary area, the dodecagonal drum of the dome, is pierced by sixteen small rectangular windows set into rounded niches. Henri Saladin, Tunis et Kairouan, p. 122 The great central arch of the south portico, is flanked on each side by six rhythmically arranged horseshoe arches, which fall on twin columns backed by pillars. Coupole du Bahou de la Grande Mosqu√©e de Kairouan Overall, the proportions and general layout of the fa√ßade of the south portico, with its thirteen arches of which that in the middle constitutes a sort of triumphal arch crowned with a cupola, form an ensemble with \\"a powerful air of majesty\\", according to the French historian and sociologist Paul Sebag (1919‚Äì2004).Paul Sebag, op. cit., p. 102 Image:Courtyard of the Great Mosque of Kairouan.jpgView of the courtyard on the side of the prayer hall facade Image:Great Mosque of Kairouan prayer hall facade.jpgPorch topped with a ribbed dome rising in the middle of the south portico of the courtyard Image:Kairouan Mosque Courtyard with columns.jpgCourtyard seen from one of the arched galleries Image:The Great Mosque of Kairouan, eastern portico of the courtyard.jpgPortico located on the eastern side of the courtyard Image:Great Mosque of Kairouan, eastern portico of the courtyard.jpgInterior view of the eastern portico of the courtyard Image:Great Mosque of Kairouan gallery.jpgInterior view of the western portico of the courtyard  Details of the courtyard  The combination formed by the courtyard and the galleries that surround it covers an immense area whose dimensions are about 90 metres long and 72 metres in width. Cour et minaret de la Grande Mosqu√©e de Kairouan The northern part of the courtyard is paved with flagstones while the rest of the floor is almost entirely composed of white marble slabs. Near its centre is an horizontal sundial, bearing an inscription in naskhi engraved on the marble dating from 1258 AH (which corresponds to the year 1843) and which is accessed by a little staircase; it determines the time of prayers. The rainwater collector or impluvium, probably the work of the Muradid Bey Mohamed Bey al-Mouradi (1686‚Äì1696), is an ingenious system that ensures the capture (with the slightly sloping surface of the courtyard) then filtering stormwater at a central basin furnished with horseshoe arches sculpted in white marble. Cour de la Grande Mosqu√©e de Kairouan Freed from its impurities, the water flows into an underground cistern supported by seven-metre-high pillars. In the courtyard there are also several water wells some of which are placed side by side. Their edges, obtained from the lower parts of ancient cored columns,Paul Sebag, op. cit., p. 90 support the string grooves back the buckets.

The minaret, which occupies the centre of the northern fa√ßade of the complex's enclosure, is 31.5 metres tall and is seated on a square base of 10.7 metres on each side.Paul Sebag, op. cit., p. 97 It is located inside the enclosure and does not have direct access from the outside. It consists of three tapering levels, the last of which is topped with a small ribbed dome that was most probably built later than the rest of the tower.N√©ji Djelloul, op. cit., p. 15 The first and second stories are surmounted by rounded merlons which are pierced by arrowslits. The minaret served as a watchtower, as well as to call the faithful to prayer. The door giving access to the minaret is framed by a lintel and jambs made of recycled carved friezes of antique origin.N√©ji Djelloul, op. cit., p. 13 There are stone blocks from the Roman period that bear Latin inscriptions. Their use probably dates to the work done under the Umayyad governor Bishr ibn Safwan in about 725 AD, and they have been reused at the base of the tower. The greater part of the minaret dates from the time of the Aghlabid princes in the ninth century. It consists of regular layers of carefully cut rubble stone, thus giving the work a stylistically admirable homogeneity and unity.N√©ji Djelloul, op. cit., p. 14 The interior includes a staircase of 129 steps, surmounted by a barrel vault, which gives access to the terraces and the first tier of the minaret. The courtyard fa√ßade (or south fa√ßade) of the tower is pierced with windows that provide light and ventilation, Minaret de la Grande Mosqu√©e de Kairouan (Qantara) while the other three fa√ßades‚Äîfacing north, east and west‚Äîare pierced with small openings in the form of arrowslits. The minaret, in its present aspect, dates largely from the early ninth century, about 836 AD. It is the oldest minaret in the Muslim world,Ahmad Fikri, L‚Äôart islamique de Tunisie : la Grande Mosqu√©e de Kairouan, vol. II, √©d.

Weidenfeld and Nicolson, London, 1981, p. 81 Due to its age and its architectural features, the minaret of the Great Mosque of Kairouan is the prototype for all the minarets of the western Islamic world: it served as a model in both North Africa and in Andalusia.Minaret of the Great Mosque of Kairouan (Qantara) Despite its massive form and austere decoration, it nevertheless presents a harmonious structure and a majestic appearance.

The dome of the mihrab is based on an octagonal drum with slightly concave sides, raised on a square base, decorated on each of its three southern, Easter and western faces with five flat-bottomed niches surmounted by five semi-circular arches, Coupole du mihrab de la Grande Mosqu√©e de Kairouan the niche in the middle is cut by a lobed oculus enrolled in a circular frame. This dome, whose construction goes back to the first half of the ninth century (towards 836), is one of the oldest and most remarkable domes in the western Islamic world.Georges Mar√ßais, Coupole et plafonds de la Grande Mosqu√©e de Kairouan, √©d. Tournier, Paris, 1925, p. 11 =Interior=  Prayer hall  The prayer hall is located on the southern side of the courtyard; and is accessed by 17 carved wooden doors. A portico with double row of arches precede the spacious prayer hall, which takes the shape of a rectangle of 70.6 metres in width and 37.5 metres' depth. Salle de pri√®re de la Grande Mosqu√©e de Kairouan Interior view of the prayer hall Main door of the prayer hall The hypostyle hall is divided into 17 aisles of eight bays, the central nave is wider, as well as the bay along the wall of the qibla.

I, p. 140 The central nave, a sort of triumphal alley which leads to the mihrab,N√©ji Djelloul, op. cit., p. 34 is significantly higher and wider than the other sixteen aisles of the prayer hall.

A legend says they could not count them without going blind.Trudy Ring, Robert M. Salkin and Sharon La Boda, ¬´ Kairouan (Tunisia) ¬ª, International Dictionary of Historic Places, ed. Taylor & Francis, Oxford, 1996, p. 389 The capitals resting on the column shafts offer a wide variety of shapes and styles (Corinthian, Ionic, Composite, etc.). Some capitals were carved for the mosque, but others come from Roman or Byzantine buildings (dating from the second to sixth century) and were reused. According to the German archaeologist Christian Ewert, the special arrangement of reused columns and capitals surrounding the mihrab obeys to a well-defined program and would draw symbolically the plan of the Dome of the Rock.Christian Ewert and Jens-Peter Wisshak, Forschungen zur almohadischen Moschee, ed. Philipp von Zabern, Mainz, 1980, pp. 15‚Äì20 (figure 20) The shafts of the columns are carved in marble of different colors and different backgrounds. Those in white marble come from Italy, some shafts located in the area of the mihrab are in red porphyry imported from Egypt,Actualit√© des religions, n¬∞12‚Äì22, 2000, p. 64 while those made of greenish or pink marble are from quarries of Chemtou, in the north-west of current Tunisia. Although the shafts are of varying heights, the columns are ingeniously arranged to support fallen arches harmoniously. The height difference is compensated by the development of variable bases, capitals and crossbeams; a number of these crossbeams are in cedar wood. The wooden rods, which usually sink to the base of the transom, connect the columns together and maintain the spacing of the arches, thus enhancing the stability of all structures which support the ceiling of the prayer hall.N√©ji Djelloul, op. cit., p. 35 Ancient Corinthian capitals The covering of the prayer hall consists of painted ceilings decorated with vegetal motifs and two domes: one raised at the beginning of the central nave and the other in front of the mihrab. The latter, which its hemispherical cap is cut by 24 concave grooves radiating around the top,N√©ji Djelloul, op. cit., p. 42 is based on ridged horns shaped shell and a drum pierced by eight circular windows which are inserted between sixteen niches grouped by two.Pr√©sentation de la Grande Mosqu√©e de Kairouan (ArchNet) The niches are covered with carved stone panels, finely adorned with characteristic geometric, vegetal and floral patterns of the Aghlabid decorative repertoire: shells, cusped arches, rosettes, vine-leaf, etc. From the outside, the dome of the mihrab is based on an octagonal drum with slightly concave sides, raised on a square base, decorated on each of its three southern, Easter and western faces with five flat-bottomed niches surmounted by five semi-circular arches, the niche in the middle is cut by a lobed oculus enrolled in a circular frame. Partial view of the ceiling of the prayer hall The painted ceilings are a unique ensemble of planks, beams and brackets, illustrating almost thousand years of the history of painting on wood in Tunisia. Wooden brackets offer a wide variety of style and decor in the shape of a crow or a grasshopper with wings or fixed, they are characterised by a setting that combines floral painted or carved, with grooves. The oldest boards date back to the Aghlabid period (ninth century) and are decorated with scrolls and rosettes on a red background consists of squares with concave sides in which are inscribed four-petaled flowers in green and blue, and those performed by the Zirid dynasty (eleventh century) are characterised by inscriptions in black kufic writing with gold rim and the uprights of the letters end with lobed florets, all on a brown background adorned with simple floral patterns. The boards painted under the Hafsid period (during the thirteenth century) offers a floral decor consists of white and blue arches entwined with lobed green. The latest, dated the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries (mostly dating from the time of the Muradid Beys), are distinguished by an epigraphic decoration consists of long black and red texts on olive green background to those painted from 1618 to 1619, under the reign of Murad I Bey (1613‚Äì1631), while those back to the eighteenth century have inscriptions in white naskhi script on an orange background. Plafonds de la salle de pri√®re de la Grande Mosqu√©e de Kairouan = Mihrab and minbar = Close view of the mihrab, whose current state dates from the ninth century The mihrab, which indicates the Qibla (direction of Mecca), in front of which stands the imam during the prayer, is located in the middle of the southern wall of the prayer hall. It is formed by an oven-shaped niche framed by two marble columns and topped by a painted wooden half-cupola. The niche of the mihrab is two metres long, 4.5 metres high and 1.6 metres deep.Mihrab of the Great Mosque of Kairouan (Qantara) The mosque's mihrab, whose decor is a remarkable witness of Muslim art in the early centuries of Islam, is distinguished by its harmonious composition and the quality of its ornaments. Considered as the oldest example of concave mihrab, it dates in its present state to 862‚Äì863 AD.Titus Burckhardt, Art of Islam, Language and Meaning, ed. World Wisdom, Bloomington (Indiana), 2009, page 130 Upper part of the mihrab Luster tiles of the mihrab It is surrounded at its upper part by 139 lusterware tiles (with a metallic sheen), each one is 21.1 centimetres square and they are arranged on the diagonal in a chessboard pattern. Divided into two groups, they are dated from the beginning of the second half of the ninth century but it is not determined with certainty whether they were made in Baghdad or in Kairouan by a Baghdadi artisan, the controversy over the origin of this precious collection agitates the specialists. These tiles are mainly decorated with floral and plant motifs (stylised flowers, palm leaves and asymmetrical leaves on bottom hatch and checkered) belong to two series: one polychrome characterised by a greater richness of tones ranging from light gold to light, dark or ocher yellow, and from brick-red to brown lacquer, the other monochrome is a beautiful luster that goes from smoked gold to green gold. The coating around them is decorated with blue plant motifs dating from the eighteenth century or the first half of the nineteenth century. The horseshoe arch of the mihrab, stilted and broken at the top, rest on two columns of red marble with yellow veins, which surmounted with Byzantine style capitals that carry two crossbeams carved with floral patterns, each one is decorated with a Kufic inscription in relief. View of the minbar; this pulpit, the oldest in existence, is still in its place of origin (in the prayer hall). It is protected by a glass panel. Detail of the marble cladding The wall of the mihrab is covered with 28 panels of white marble, carved and pierced, which have a wide variety of plant and geometric patterns including the stylised grape leaf, the flower and the shell. Behind the openwork hint, there is an oldest niche on which several assumptions were formulated. If one refers to the story of Al-Bakri, an Andalusian historian and geographer of the eleventh century, it is the mihrab which would be done by Uqba Ibn Nafi, the founder of Kairouan, whereas Lucien Golvin shares the view that it is not an old mihrab but hardly a begun construction which may serve to support marble panels and either goes back to work of Ziadet Allah I (817‚Äì838) or to those of Abul Ibrahim around the years 862‚Äì863.Lucien Golvin, ¬´ Le mihrab de Kairouan ¬ª, Kunst des Orients, vol. V, 1969, pp. 1‚Äì38 Above the marble cladding, the mihrab niche is crowned with a half dome-shaped vault made of manchineel bentwood. Covered with a thick coating completely painted, the concavity of the arch is decorated with intertwined scrolls enveloping stylised five-lobed vine leaves, three-lobed florets and sharp clusters, all in yellow on midnight blue background. Mihrab de la Grande Mosqu√©e de Kairouan The minbar, situated on the right of the mihrab, is used by the imam during the Friday or Eids sermons, is a staircase-shaped pulpit with an upper seat, reached by eleven steps, and measuring 3.93 metres' length to 3.31 metres in height. Dated from the ninth century (about 862) and erected under the reign of the sixth Aghlabid ruler Abul Ibrahim (856‚Äì863), it is made in teak wood imported from India.Minbar of the Great Mosque of Kairouan (Qantara) Among all the pulpits of the Muslim world, it is certainly the oldest example of minbar still preserved today.Mohammad Adnan Bakhit, History of humanity, Routledge, 2000, page 345 Probably made by cabinetmakers of Kairouan (some researchers also refer to Baghdad), it consists of an assembly of more than 300 finely carved wood pieces with an exceptional ornamental wealth (vegetal and geometric patterns refer to the Umayyad and Abbasid models), among which about 90 rectangular panels carved with plenty of pine cones, grape leaves, thin and flexible stems, lanceolate fruits and various geometric shapes (squares, diamonds, stars, etc.). The upper edge of the minbar ramp is adorned with a rich and graceful vegetal decoration composed of alternately arranged foliated scrolls, each one containing a spread vine-leaf and a cluster of grapes. In the early twentieth century, the minbar had a painstaking restoration. Although it has existed for more than eleven centuries, all panels, with the exception of nine, are originals and are in a good state of conservation, the fineness of the execution of the minbar makes it a great masterpiece of Islamic wood carving referring to Paul Sebag.Paul Sebag, op. cit., p. 105 This old chair of the ninth century is still in its original location, next to the mihrab. = Maqsura = View of the maqsura decorated with a frieze that includes a kufic character calligraphic inscription The maqsura, located near the minbar, consists of a fence bounding a private enclosure that allows the sovereign and his senior officials to follow the solemn prayer of Friday without mingling with the faithful. Jewel of the art of woodwork produced during the reign of the Zirid prince Al-Mu'izz ibn Badis and dated from the first half of the eleventh century, it is considered the oldest still in place in the Islamic world. It is a cedar wood fence finely sculpted and carved on three sides with various geometric motifs measuring 2.8 metres tall, eight metres long and six metres wide. Its main adornment is a frieze that crowns calligraphy, the latter surmounted by a line of pointed openwork merlons, features an inscription in flowery kufic character carved on the background of interlacing plants. Carefully executed in relief, it represents one of the most beautiful epigraphic bands of Islamic art. The library is near located, accessible by a door which the jambs and the lintel are carved in marble, adorned with a frieze of floral decoration. The library window is marked by an elegant setting that has two columns flanking the opening, which is a horseshoe arch topped by six blind arches and crowned by a series of berms sawtooth.N√©ji Djelloul, op. cit., p. 57  Artworks  The Mosque of Uqba, one of the few religious buildings of Islam has remained intact almost all of its architectural and decorative elements, is due to the richness of its repertoire which is a veritable museum of Islamic decorative art and architecture. Most of the works on which rests the reputation of the mosque are still conserved in situ while a certain number of them have joined the collections of the Raqqada National Museum of Islamic Art; Raqqada is located about ten kilometres southwest of Kairouan. From the library of the mosque comes a large collection of calligraphic scrolls and manuscripts, the oldest dating back to the second half of the ninth century. This valuable collection, observed from the late nineteenth century by the French orientalists Octave Houdas and Ren√© Basset who mention in their report on their scientific mission in Tunisia published in the Journal of African correspondence in 1882, comprises according to the inventory established at the time of the Hafsids (circa 1293‚Äì1294) several Qur'ans and books of fiqh that concern mainly the Maliki fiqh and its sources. These are the oldest fund of Maliki legal literature to have survived.Bernard G. Weiss, Studies in Islamic legal theory, page 9. BRILL, 2002 Two pages of the Blue Qur'an (surah al-Baqarah, verses 197-201), originally in the library of the mosque Among the finest works of this series, the pages of the Blue Qur'an, currently exhibited at Raqqada National Museum of Islamic Art, from a famous Qur'an in the second half of the fourth century of the Hegira (the tenth century) most of which is preserved in Tunisia and the rest scattered in museums and private collections worldwide. Featuring kufic character suras are written in gold on vellum dyed with indigo, they are distinguished by a compact graph with no marks for vowels. The beginning of each surah is indicated by a band consisting of a golden stylised leafy foliage, dotted with red and blue, while the verses are separated by silver rosettes. Other scrolls and calligraphic Qur'ans, as that known as the Hadinah's Qur'an, copied and illuminated by the calligrapher Ali ibn Ahmad al-Warraq for the governess of the Zirid prince Al-Muizz ibn Badis at about 1020 AD, were also in the library before being transferred to Raqqada museum. This collection is a unique source for studying the history and evolution of calligraphy of medieval manuscripts in the Maghreb, covering the period from the ninth to the eleventh century. Other works of art such as the crowns of light (circular chandeliers) made in cast bronze, dating from the Fatimid-Zirid period (around the tenth to the early eleventh century), originally belonged to the furniture of the mosque. These polycandelons, now scattered in various Tunisian museums including Raqqada, consist of three chains supporting a perforated brass plate, which has a central circular ring around which radiate 18 equidistant poles connected by many horseshoe arches and equipped for each of two landmarks flared. The three chains, connected by a suspension ring, are each fixed to the plate by an almond-shaped finial. The crowns of light are marked by Byzantine influence to which the Kairouanese artisan brought the specificities of Islamic decorative repertoire (geometric and floral motifs).Circular chandelier (Discover Islamic Art)  Role in Muslim civilisation  At the time of its greatest splendor, between the ninth and eleventh centuries AD, Kairouan was one of the greatest centres of Islamic civilisation and its reputation as a hotbed of scholarship covered the entire Maghreb. During this period, the Great Mosque of Kairouan was both a place of prayer and a centre for teaching Islamic sciences under the Maliki current. One may conceivably compare its role to that of the University of Paris during the Middle Ages.Henri Saladin, Tunis et Kairouan, p. 118 In addition to studies on the deepening of religious thought and Maliki jurisprudence, the mosque also hosted various courses in secular subjects such as mathematics, astronomy, medicine and botany. The transmission of knowledge was assured by prominent scholars and theologians which included Sahnun ibn Sa'id and Asad ibn al-Furat, eminent jurists who contributed greatly to the dissemination of the Maliki thought, Ishaq ibn Imran and Ibn al-Jazzar in medicine, Abu Sahl al-Kairouani and Abd al-Monim al-Kindi in mathematics. Thus, the mosque, headquarters of a prestigious university with a large library containing a large number of scientific and theological works, was the most remarkable intellectual and cultural centre in North Africa during the ninth, tenth and eleventh centuries.Nurdin Laugu, ¬´ The Roles of Mosque Libraries through History ¬ª, Al-Jami‚Äòah, vol. 45, n¬∞1, pages 103 and 105, 2007 See also * List of the oldest mosques * History of Medieval Arabic and Western European domes * Minar (Firuzabad) References  Further reading  * N√©ji Djelloul, 2000.

The bomber was reputedly the largest wooden aircraft to be produced in any quantity during World War I, with only the Siemens-Schuckert R.VIII prototype bomber of 1916‚Äì1919 being larger, with the Staaken R.VI's wingspan of nearly equaling that of the World War II Boeing B-29 Superfortress, although significantly less than the span of the Siemens-Schuckert R.VIII. Design and development In September 1914, at the start of World War I, Ferdinand von Zeppelin visualised the concept of a Riesenflugzeug (R) bomber, to be larger than the then-nascent Friedel-Ursinus twin-engined military aircraft. Using engineers from the Robert Bosch GmbH, he created the Versuchsbau Gotha-Ost (VGO) consortium in a rented hangar at the Gotha factory. Alexander Baumann became his chief engineer, although later the team included other noted engineers including Zeppelin's associate Claudius Dornier, the 1915 pioneer of all-metal aircraft construction in Hugo Junkers and Baumann's protog√© Adolph Rohrbach. Almost all of these Zeppelin-Staaken Riesenflugzeug designs used some variation of either pusher configuration and/or push-pull configuration in their engine layout, orientation and placement of their powerplants. The first Zeppelin-Staaken \\"giant\\" bomber, the VGO.I of 1915. The first Riesenflugzeug built was the VGO.I flying in April 1915, using three engines; two pusher and one tractor, with a span, four-bay interplane strut layout for its slightly swept-back leading edge biplane configuration, maintained throughout the entire Zeppelin-Staaken R-series of aircraft during World War I. The VGO.I was built for the Marine-Fliegerabteilung (Imperial German naval Air service) and served on the Eastern Front Later modified with two extra engines, it crashed during tests at Staaken. A similar machine, the VGO.II was also used on the Eastern Front. Baumann was an early expert in light-weight construction techniques and placed the four engines in nacelles mounted between the upper and lower wing decks to distribute the loads to save weight in the wing spars. The next aircraft, the VGO.III was a six-engined designThe VGO.III was sometimes unofficially called the R.III but the official R-designations began with R.IV, to avoid confusion with the earlier VGO designations. The 160 hp Maybach engines were paired to drive the three propellers. It served with Riesenflugzeug Abteilung (Rfa) 500. In 1916 VGO moved to the Berlin suburb of Staaken, to take advantage of the vast Zeppelin sheds there. The successor to the VGO III became the Staaken R.IV (IdFlieg number R.12/15), the only \\"one-off\\" Zeppelin-Staaken R-type to survive World War I, powered by a total of six engines, driving three propellers: a tractor configuration system in the nose and two pusher-mount nacelle mounts between the wings. By the autumn of 1916, Staaken was completing its R.V, the R.VI prototype, and R.VII versions of the same design, and Idflieg selected the R.VI for series production over the 6-engined R.IV and other Riesenflugzeug designs, primarily those of Siemens-Schuckertwerke AG. With four direct-drive engines in a tandem push-pull arrangement, and a fully enclosed cockpit, the R.VI design required none of the complex gearboxes of other R-types. Each R.VI bomber cost 557,000 marks and required the support of a 50-man ground crew. The R.VI required a complex 18-wheel undercarriage consisting of twin nosewheels and a quartet of four-wheeled groupings for its main gear to support its weight, and carried two mechanics in flight, seated between the engines in open niches cut in the center of each nacelle. The bombs were carried in an internal bomb bay located under the central fuel tanks, with three racks each capable of holding seven bombs. The R.VI was capable of carrying the 1000 kg PuW bomb. Although designed by Versuchsbau, because of the scope of the project, the production R.VI's were manufactured by other firms: seven by Sch√ºtte-Lanz using sheds at Flugzeugwerft GmbH Staaken, Berlin; six by Automobil und Aviatik A.G. (Aviatik) (the original order was for three); and three by Albatros Flugzeugwerke. 13 of the production models were commissioned into service before the armistice and saw action. One R.VI was as a float-equipped seaplane for the Marine-Fliegerabteilung (Imperial German Naval Air Service), with the designation Type L and s/n 1432, using Maybach engines. After the first flight on 5 September 1917 the Type \\"L\\" crashed during testing on June 3, 1918. The Type 8301, of which four were ordered and three delivered, was developed from the R.VI by elevating the fuselage above the lower wing for greater water clearance, eliminating the bomb bays, and enclosing the open gun position on the nose. =The special \\"R.30/16\\" test aircraft= R.VI serial number R.30/16 was the earliest known supercharged aircraft to fly, with a fifth engine - a Mercedes D.II - installed in the central fuselage, driving a Brown-Boveri four-stage supercharger at some 6,000 rpm. This enabled the R.30/16 to climb to an altitude of . The idea of supercharging an aircraft's propeller-driving piston engines with an extra powerplant used solely to power a supercharger was not attempted again by Germany until later in World War II, when both the Dornier Do 217P and Henschel Hs 130E experimental bomber designs each revived the idea as the H√∂hen-Zentrale-Anlage system. The R.30/16 aircraft was later fitted with four examples of one of the first forms of variable-pitch propellers, believed to have been ground-adjustable only. Operational service The R.VI equipped two Luftstreitkr√§fte (Imperial German Army Air Service) units, Riesenflugzeug-Abteilung (Rfa) 500 and Rfa 501, with the first delivered June 28, 1917. The units first served on the Eastern Front, based at Alt-Auz and Vilua in Kurland until August 1917. Almost all missions were flown at night with bomb loads, operating between altitude. Missions were of three to five hours' duration. Rfa 501 transferred to Ghent, Belgium, to attack France and Great Britain, arriving September 22, 1917, at Sint-Denijs-Westrem airdrome. Rfa 501 later moved its base to Scheldewindeke airdrome south of group headquarters at Gontrode, while Rfa 500 was based at Castinne, France, with its primary targets French airfields and ports. Rfa 501, with an average of five R.VI's available for missions, conducted 11 raids on Great Britain between September 28, 1917, and May 20, 1918, dropping of bombs in 30 sorties. Aircraft flew individually to their targets on moonlit nights, requesting directional bearings by radio after takeoff, then using the River Thames as a navigational landmark. Missions on the round trip lasted seven hours. None were lost in combat over Great Britain (compared to 28 Gotha G bombers shot down over England), but two crashed returning to base in the dark. Four R.VI's were shot down in combat (one-third of the operational inventory), with six others destroyed in crashes, of the 13 commissioned during the war. Six of the 18 eventually built survived the war or were completed after the armistice. Discovered crash site Very little remains of these giant bombers, although nearly a century after the end of World War I amateur historians of the \\"Poelcapelle 1917 Association vzw\\" working in Poelkapelle, northeast of Ypres, identified a wreck that was found in 1981 by Daniel Parrein, a local farmer who was plowing his land. For a while it was thought that the wreck was that of French ace Georges Guynemer's SPAD S.XIII; however that was discounted when repair tools were found at the site, and further research pointed that the engine was a Mercedes D.IVa, possibly of a Gotha G bomber. A comparison of recovered parts was inconclusive, since the parts were common to a number of aircraft other than the Gotha G.http://www.wwi- models.org/Photos/Ger/ZStaakenRVI/index.html In 2007 the researchers, Piet Steen with some help of Johan Vanbeselaere, finally made a conclusive identification after visiting one of the few partial specimens (the distinctive engine nacelles) in a Krak√≥w air museum. With the help of the Polish aviation historians, parts were identified as those of Zeppelin-Staaken R.VI R.34/16, which crashed on 21 April 1918 after a mission against the Royal Air Force airfield at Saint-Omer, France. The R.VI was shot down, apparently by anti-aircraft fire of the British 2nd Army, while trying to cross the front line, killing all seven crew members.http://www.forumeerstewereldoorlog.nl/viewtopic.php?t=8058 Original Dutch article on recovery Variants Zeppelin-Staaken R.VI ;Zeppelin-Staaken R.VI The first true production Zeppelin-Staaken Riesenflugzeug was the R.VI. This giant aircraft was powered either by four 245hp (183KW) Maybach MbIV engines or four 260hp(194KW) Mercedes D.IVa engines. The fuselage was similar to the previous aircraft but the cockpit was extended forwards, enclosed and glazed with a gunners cockpit in the extreme nose. Other improvements included aluminium alloy structure in the triple finned biplane tail unit, which was built with inverse camber to improve the stabilising downforce. Eighteen R.VIs were built serialled 'R25' to 'R39' and 'R52' to 'R54' all except 'R30', which was used exclusively as a supercharged engine test-bed, saw service in the Luftstreitkr√§fte with Rfa500 and Rfa 501 on the western front stationed in the Ghent area. Air raids on England by R.VIs began on 17 September 1917. Many air raids attributed to Gotha bombers were, in fact, carried out by Zeppelin- Staaken R.VI or R.XIV bombers, with direct hits on the Royal Hospital Chelsea with the first 1,000kg bomb dropped on England, on 16/17 February 1918. St Pancras Station was attacked the next night. During the campaign from 18 December 1917 to 20 May 1918 the R.VIs of Rfa501 made eleven raids dropping 27,190kg (28tons) of bombs. Eighteen built. ;Zeppelin-Staaken R.VII Differing little from the R.IV, the R.VII had a revised arrangement of struts in the tail unit. The sole R.VII, serialled R 14/15, crashed during its delivery flight to the front line. One built. ;Zeppelin-Staaken R.XIV The R.XIV closely resembled previous Zeppelin-Staaken Riesenflugzeug differing only in engine installation and details. The five Maybach MbIV engines were arranged as push- pull pairs in the nacelles, with the engineer accommodated between the engines, and a single tractor engine in the nose. Three R.XIVs were built, serialled R 43/16 to R 45/16, of which R 43/16 was shot down by Capt. Archibald Buchanan Yuille of No. 151 Squadron RAF. ;Zeppelin-Staaken R.XV The R.XV also carried on the five engine layout of the R.XIV but introduced a large central fin in the tail unit. Three R.XVs were built, serialled R 46/16 to R 48/16 but there is no evidence that they carried out operational flights. ;Zeppelin-Staaken Type \\"L\\" Seaplane This aircraft was essentially an R.VI fitted with large long duralumin floats. Allocated the serial no. 1432 by the Kaiserliche Marine the aircraft was wrecked during trials. One built. ;Zeppelin-Staaken Type 8301 Seaplane In a further attempt to develop a useful large seaplane for the Kaiserliche Marine, Zeppelin-Staaken used R.VI wings mated to an all new fuselage, which incorporated the large central fin of the R.XV, suspended midway between the mainplanes, all supported by floats similar to the 'Type \\"L\\"'. Three were built, serialled 8301, 8303 and 8304, of which 8301 was also tested with a land undercarriage, the existence of 8302 has not been confirmed.

It occupies part of Balduina, of the territory of Municipio Roma I ( Roma Centro ), of Municipio Roma XIV ( Roma Monte Mario ) and a small portion of Municipio Roma XV of Rome, thus including part of the Quarters Trionfale, Della Vittoria and Primavalle. The same toponym also identifies the urban area which extends over the hill, close to Via Trionfale and the first stretch of Via di Torrevecchia, with the railway station of the same name. It is the highest (139 m) hill in th town and, together with the Janiculum and the Pincius, one of the most scenic spots in the city, especially in the place called \\"Zodiac\\", which offers a south and west view of the main architectural monuments of the city, of the Vatican City, of the Alban Hills, of the Monti Tiburtini, of the Monti Prenestini and of the highest peaks of western central Apennines. Here, moreover, begins the longest Linear Park in Rome, which connects the town to the Parco di Monte Ciocci. The location has been chosen as trigonometrical station in the Gauss‚ÄìBoaga cartographic projection, giving rise to che datum Roma 40. Although it is the highest hill in the modern city of Rome, Monte Mario is not one of the proverbial Seven Hills of Rome, being outside the boundaries of the ancient city.  History  Prati di Castello and Monte Mario in a watercolor by Ettore Roesler Franz Excavations carried out in the Cartoni estate, close to Monte Mario, have found a flint tool, some splinters of the same material and animal teeth. The remains date back to about 65,000 years ago and are the oldest finds in the area of Rome. In the Middle Ages Monte Mario was located on the Via Francigena; pilgrims referred to it as Mons Gaudii (Latin for Mount of the Joy).According to Ferdinand Gregorovius, Geschichte der Stadt Rom im Mittelalter, vol. IV, Munich, C. H. Beck, 1988, p. 660. The Via Francigena came from the Leonine City and continued towards La Giustiniana and then La Storta; then, having passed Isola Farnese, it continued north. = Origin of the name = The hill was known as Mons Vaticanus or Clivus Cinnae (from the name of the Consul Lucius Cornelius Cinna) during the ancient Roman period. The current name, according to some theories, comes from Mario Mellini, a cardinal who owned a villa (since 1935 the seat of the Museo Astronomico e Copernicano of Rome in the official website of the Museo Astronomico e Copernicano) and several hamlets around the hill in the 15th Century. A second hypothesis derives the name from the word mare (Italian for \\"sea\\"), referring to the fossil shells found there or to the fact that from some heights is it possible to see the sea. Finally, a third hypothesis is related to the medieval name of the hill, Monte Malo (\\"Bad Mountain\\"), due to the murder of the patrician Giovanni Crescenzio that took place there in 998. Description Radio-television antenna tower at the RAI broadcast and transmission centre in Monte Mario The eastern part of the hill is a nature reserve and on the west side lies the now upmarket district of the same name. Atop one hill is the church and convent of the Madonna del Rosario. On the hilltop, in the site of the 15th-Century Villa Mellini, rises the Monte Mario Observatory, part of the Rome Observatory, and the Museo Astronomico Copernicano. This location (12¬∞27'8.4\\"E ) was used as the prime meridian (rather than Greenwich) for the maps of Italy until the 1960s. The side of the hill was the former site of the Villa del Pigneto, built by Pietro da Cortona. The ruins of the structure were razed in the 19th Century. The John Felice Rome Center, one of the four campuses of Loyola University Chicago, is located on the hill in Via Massimi. The other settlements on the hill include: * the headquarters and administrative offices of the National Institute for Astrophysics (INAF); * the Transmitting center of Monte Mario, which houses the RAI repeaters; * the Ospedale San Filippo Neri; * the Faculty of Medicine and Surgery \\"Agostino Gemelli\\" of the Universit√† Cattolica del Sacro Cuore and the Agostino Gemelli University Policlinic; * the Roma Monte Mario weather station. The built-up area of the hill include middle and high-bourgeois residential districts, such as Balduina, Trionfale, Belsito and Della Vittoria, as well as a more popular area, corresponding to the northernmost part of Primavalle. The part of Della Vittoria Suburb overlooking Piazza Nostra Signora di Guadalupe is called Monte Mario Alto (\\"High Monte Mario\\") and develops close to Colle Sant'Agata, where, in the 1920s, a cooperative of post and telegraph workers built the first settlement. Other popular housing units were added in the 1930s, while the full edification was completed between the 1960s and the 1980s. Monte Mario is also historically linked to the complex of the former Manicomio Santa Maria della Piet√†, one of the largest and oldest mental health hospital in Europe. = Parks and green areas = The park of Monte Mario * Riserva naturale di Monte Mario: a nature reserve with an area of 204 hectares. *Riserva naturale dell'Insugherata: a nature reserve that hosts most of the herbs surveyed in Rome, whose name derives from the abundant presence of cork oaks (Italian: \\"querce da sughero\\"). Its accesses are in the workshops of the Ospedale San Filippo Neri, in Via Andrea Angiulli and in Via Augusto Conti. It is an important biologic corridor between the urbanized area north of Rome and the Veii Regional Park, north-west of the Capital. The new delimitation of the Grande Raccordo Anulare has considerably reduced the protected area on the north side. *Parco regionale urbano del Pineto: it is a nature reserve, established in 1987 by the municipality of Rome, which covers about 240 hectares and provides an integral reserve area of 26 hectares. It can be accessed from Via della Pineta Sacchetti and Via Proba Petronia. * Linear Park: it occupies the route of the former Rome-Viterbo railway line and was inaugurated on June 14, 2014. It is the larges linear park of Rome and includes a pedestrian and cycle track linking the area of Monte Mario Railway Station, from the complex of Santa Maria della Piet√†, to the Park of Monte Ciocci. The path, five kilometers long, has ten entrances integrated with the traditional mobility roads, intersections with four stations of FR3 railway line (Monte Mario, Gemelli, Balduina, Appiano), three play areas for children and a skating rink, turnstiles between one road and another, to prevent entry to cars and mopeds; moreover, ten standpipes and more one hundred benches. The route has an average gradient of 1%.  Historical re-enactment of Monte Mario Circuit  In 2004, thanks to Moto Guzzi Roma and under the patronage of the Lazio Region, of the Province of Rome and of Roma Capitale, the Monte Mario Circuit was reborn: it is a circuit crossed by Tazio Nuvolari with his Bianchi 350 (the legendary Blue Arrow) on February 24, 1925.

When he went to high school, he asked to be his school's first male baton twirler. Wearing a cheerleader's sweater and white pants with gold stripes, he often was tempted to outperform the majorettes. Jamerson eventually moved to St. Louis and worked as a flight attendant, but was laid off after the 9/11 attacks (he now works as a floral designer).

Several police officers asked him to leave, and he refused, allegedly kicking one of the officers. According to Baton Bob, an officer then logged on to Baton Bob's Facebook account and posted a pro-police message reading, in part, \\"I want to verify, that the Atlanta police was respectful to me considering the circumstances\\". The charges were later dismissed, and the officer who posted the message resigned; his lieutenant was disciplined for \\"violating the responsibilities of a supervisor\\". Baton Bob filed a federal civil rights lawsuit against the city. Although the city released a statement calling Baton Bob's claims \\"baseless\\", they offered a $20,000 settlement. On June 26, 2015, two years to the day after the arrest, Baton Bob married local chef Gary Bender in a ceremony that had been long planned for that day. Their wedding happened to fall on the same date that the Supreme Court announced its decision legalizing same-sex marriage nationwide.

Early life  Frank Jardine was born on 28 August 1841 at the \\"Rathluba\\" property near East Maitland in the British colony of New South Wales. His father, John Jardine, was a Scottish military officer who came to Australia with his wife in 1840 to take up the offer of a land grant and become a grazier. The Jardines sold \\"Rathluba\\" in 1842 and after a brief period living near Cecil Park, moved to the Wellington district in the central-west of the colony. Frank's father became a well-known pastoral squatter, Commissioner of Crown Lands and police magistrate in this region, obtaining and selling various properties including \\"Gobolion\\" and \\"The Holmes\\". With this new found prosperity, Frank, along with his younger brothers were sent to Sydney for schooling to be educated at Sydney Grammar School.  Rockhampton  In 1858, Frank's father accepted a position of Commissioner of Crown Lands in the frontier Port Curtis District and in 1861 he also became the police magistrate at Rockhampton. After completing his schooling in Sydney, Frank joined his parents and siblings at Rockhampton and by 1862 was involved in the business of land sales and subdivision in that town.  Journey to Cape York  Frank Jardine (standing third from left) with his brothers and Native Police troopers In 1864 Jardine's father, John Jardine, was again appointed by the Government of Queensland as a magistrate in another frontier region of British colonisation. This time he was to establish and supervise a British outpost at the very tip of the Cape York Peninsula. With the aid of a contingent of Royal Marines, he sailed there in August 1864 and constructed a small settlement which was called Somerset. It was decided that Frank Jardine along with his younger brother Alexander William Jardine would travel overland from Rockhampton with herds of livestock to Somerset in order to set up a cattle station to support the new outpost. Frank Jardine and his brother initially began this droving journey from Rockhampton in May 1864 in two separate groups which eventually rendezvoused at John Graham MacDonald's Carpentaria Downs station on the Einasleigh River. From here the remaining 1000km was through a region unoccupied by the British. On 11 October 1864 the combined party led by Frank Jardine started out from Carpentaria Downs. It consisted of Frank, his brother Alex, three stockmen, a surveyor, four Native Police troopers, 42 horses and 250 head of cattle. The trip took another five months during which time the party was constantly opposed by the area's Indigenous inhabitants as they forced their way through scrub and swamps and crossed at least six large rivers, including the Jardine River which was subsequently named after the brothers. They reached Somerset on 2 March 1865 with 12 horses and 50 cattle. Jardine's men survived, in poor health; they left a trail of dead Aborigines, dead horses and cattle and all their equipment. Jardine claimed to have personally killed 47 people, with a total death toll for the trip of over 200. Both Jardine brothers were elected Fellows of the Royal Geographical Society and received the Murchison Award.  Point Vallack cattle station  On arrival at Somerset, Frank Jardine and his group started construction of the cattle station. They chose an area about 2km south of the settlement at Point Vallack for the main camp and they also set up an outpost camp named Lockerbie which was 15km west of Somerset. Frank sailed for Brisbane in late 1865 as did his father who resigned from Somerset to return to Rockhampton. Frank, however, maintained ownership of the Point Vallack and Lockerbie cattle stations and returned to the area in early 1866. He soon discovered that the local resident Aboriginal population resented the loss of their lands to his cattle stations and on a number of occasions in 1866 they attempted to burn down the structures and also speared dozens of livestock. The new police magistrate at Somerset noted that Jardine's method of dealing with Aboriginal resistance was to go out and shoot them. In 1867, Jardine led a punitive expedition to Turtle Island where ten people were shot dead. There is also a local oral tradition that Jardine with his stockmen and native troopers shot down another large group of people around this time near to where the modern town of Bamaga now stands.  Police magistrate at Somerset  The Jardine residence, former Government House at Somerset, Cape York, Queensland In December 1867 Frank Jardine while still in charge of his cattle operations, was also appointed by the Queensland Government as police magistrate at Somerset. This appointment gave Jardine immense power over the Cape York region as he now was the government representative, had personal ownership of much of the land, controlled the seven police constables stationed at Somerset and also still commanded the four native troopers who had accompanied him on his overlanding journey in 1864. In May 1868, the local Aboriginal people organised a large assault on Jardine's Point Vallack cattle station which resulted in the death of one of his native troopers named Eulah, and the looting of a significant amount of supplies and firearms. In one account, Jardine is said to have organised a substantial retribution where 32 local people were killed. In the months after this incident Jardine received an extra five Native Police troopers and also decided to sell the troubled Point Vallack cattle station to the government. In June 1869, Jardine discovered that the captain and crew of a pearl-trading cutter named the Sperwer had been killed and their boat burnt by the Kaurareg people living on Muralag Island in the Torres Strait. Over the next 12 months Frank Jardine and Henry Chester (who was a temporary replacement magistrate at Somerset) conducted at least two large punitive expeditions on Muralag Island. In July 1869, Jardine led his native troopers and armed crewmen from the blackbirding vessel Melanie in a dawn raid on a village on the island killing many people. As Jardine believed that the Kaurareg were keeping the wife of the captain of the Sperwer captive somewhere, follow up punishments were organised. In April 1870, Chester led an armed group of 45 police and assistants in another raid on a Muralag village. The village was burnt and 20 men were taken prisoner, three of whom were summarily executed on the beach next to the village. It was later discovered the captain's wife was actually living in Melbourne. Six of Jardine's native troopers deserted in February 1871 taking with them a substantial amount of stores and firearms. Jardine had them hunted down with four shot dead and the remaining two taken prisoner. In that same year Jardine welcomed the arrival of missionaries from the London Missionary Society who used Somerset as a base to impose Christianity over the Torres Strait Islanders, a process that came to be known as \\"The Coming of the Light\\".  Mother-of-pearl merchant  From 1872 Jardine became highly involved in the profitable mother-of-pearl trade in the Torres Strait. He utilised the police constables and Native Police troopers under his command to take divers in government and private boats to collect the pearl shell. It would then be sold and shipped to Sydney for his personal profit. He placed one of his younger brothers, Charles Jardine, as the official owner of the pearling licence to avoid scrutiny of his activities. However, the Brisbane press soon revealed these alleged corrupt practices of misuse of his government position for personal gain. The scandal resulted in Frank Jardine's dismissal from his police magistrate position at Somerset in 1873. Several inquiries followed but Jardine did not have to face any charges largely due to witnesses being unwilling to give testimony and the Premier of Queensland, Arthur Hunter Palmer, being a personal friend and probable business partner of his. Jardine, although removed from government employment, was able to continue his pearling operations in the Torres Strait and quickly expanded his investment in the industry by establishing a large pearling station at Nagi Island. One of Jardine's last actions as police magistrate of Somerset was to lead another punitive mission against a group of Aboriginal people living about 50km from Somerset who had killed a skipper of one of his pearl-boats. With the assistance of his Native Police troopers, a \\"large-scale slaughter\\" ensued. At the time of his dismissal, Jardine was in a relationship with a fifteen year old Samoan girl named Sana Solia who had been brought to the Torres Strait by the missionary George Turner. They married in late 1873 and lived together on Nagi Island (also known as Naghir or Mount Ernest Island) where Jardine continued his pearl shell business and built a family home. In 1877 this house burnt down with much of the Jardines' personal possessions. Fortunately for them, the government in that same year had decided to move its base of Torres Strait operations from Somerset to Thursday Island and approached Frank Jardine with the offer to purchase the old site at Cape York. He accepted and the Premier of Queensland, John Douglas, noted that Jardine would also be able to protect British interests in the area from the remnant Yadhaigana people who still offered resistance to colonisation.  Return to Somerset  The Jardine family residence at Somerset, Cape York, 1917 Frank Jardine took possession of the buildings and the surrounding cattle stations at Somerset in January 1878. His pearling operations at Nagi Island were administered and eventually taken over by a cousin of Sana Solia named James Mills, the grandfather of the Mills Sisters. Jardine continued to reside with his family at Somerset for the next 41 years. Over this time period he expanded his pearling business, purchasing luggers that would collect shell from as far away as the eastern edges of the Great Barrier Reef and even the Louisiade Archipelago. Additionally, he entered into the trepanging industry and owned boats that would collect sea cucumber for the Asian markets. He also broadened his landholdings by establishing the Bertiehaugh cattle station on the Ducie River in 1882. The Jardines consolidated themselves as prominent and respected figures in the region after the shipwreck of the RMS Quetta in 1890. This vessel, carrying 292 people, hit a rock off Albany Island near Somerset and quickly sank. Jardine was able to organise a rescue operation utilising his boats and crew which saved 36 people. Jardine's ongoing battles with the local Indigenous population also continued. The original occupants of the Bertiehaugh property unsuccessfully attempted to displace his cattle establishment there in 1888. Punitive missions of the Native Police followed. Pearling and trepanging luggers that belonged to Jardine and other operators also blackbirded native people from the Bertiehaugh and Ducie River locality to work as forced labour. In 1893, one of Jardine's employees, Captain Samuel Rowe, was killed by a group of people who had been taken from the Ducie River. Two extensive Native Police operations were organised afterwards to inflict summary punishment to the Aboriginal people in the Bertiehaugh area. The Bertiehaugh property is now known as the Steve Irwin Wildlife Reserve and is owned by Terri Irwin.  Jardine's treasure  In early 1891 one of Jardine's large pearl and trepang (beche-de-mer) fleet, schooner Lancashire Lass (1869-1895), Captain Samuel Rowe, reported finding a shipwreck on a coral reef whilst trepanging. The items recovered included an anchor, a small non-ferrous cannon, and 160 lbs (72 kg) of Spanish dollars, estimated to be worth over ¬£300. The dates of three coins were given, the oldest 1800, 1814, and a very indistinct 1833 appeared to be the youngest. The exact location of the wreck was kept secret. The Thursday Island exports for 1891 May 22 included \\"6 boxes of specie\\" (coins) sent to London, England via the steamer Taroba. In 1911 Jardine disclosed that he equipped one of his fleet for salvage and recovered a further ~15 cwt (~760 kg) of Spanish silver pillar dollars. The Queensland steamer Tara from Brisbane, called at Thursday Island about 1891 Nov 20 on its way to London, England. The Pall Mall Gazette (London) 1892 Jan 5 reported the arrival of a large quantity of specie, value many thousand pounds, being Torres Straits treasure. The next day the Liverpool Mercury reported \\"The steamship Tara has arrived from Brisbane with ¬£6600 in specie.\\" In 1897 Percival Pitman Outridge (1863-1938) a pearl fleet owner, reported details of the coins. The Spanish dollars were dated 1713-1823, and the single gold coin recovered was a Spanish onza [ounce] dated 1819. In 1911 Jardine disclosed that the wreck was located \\"in a lagoon of Portlock Reef\\", but did not give the exact location. Rowe in 1891 had said it was \\"on the extreme outer reef of the Great Barrier chain\\". Some describe Portlock Reef as the extreme northern limit of the Great Barrier Reef. Jardine persisted with his option that the ship was Spanish, so it appears that the ship's bell was not found. Spanish dollars were widely accepted, so it was not unusual for ships of many nations to carry significant quantities to pay for goods. The ship was most likely the Sun (1819 ship), brig of Calcutta, Captain Gillett which departed Sydney 1826 May 10 with 40,000 Spanish dollars for Batavia, Singapore, Calcutta via Torres Strait. She was reported wrecked May 27 on a detached part of the Eastern Fields. The ship went to pieces almost immediately, 2 boats headed for Mer (Murray Island). The long boat with 24 were all lost on a reef within sight of Mer. The ship John Munroe picked up Capt. Gillett and 11 others Jun 1 at Mer and took them to Calcutta.  Later life, death and legacy  Francis Lascelles Jardine, 1917 In 1897 Jardine was recommended to the position of General Inspector of the pearl fisheries in the Torres Strait, but the appointment was not forthcoming. In the early 1900s he became a justice of the peace and presided over an inquiry into the whipping of an Aboriginal girl at Mapoon by a missionary. Old age and illness, however, increasingly kept him at the deteriorating Somerset homestead. Frank Jardine died on 19 March 1919 of leprosy at the age of 77. He is buried at Somerset with his Samoan bride Sana Solia who died three years after him. Their graves are now part of the heritage-listed Somerset Graves Site. The Jardine River is named after him as is a type of barramundi fish called Scleropages jardinii.

Wendy is the apple of her father, Ken's, eye. * Dusty Johnson (Kayvan Novak) ‚Äì the eldest son of the family, a lazy, obese man-child who still lives at home with his parents, to their despair. He is imaginative and not unintelligent but dimwitted, lisping and overly optimistic about his own ideas. The rest of the family is content to leave him to his own fantasy world. In episode 4 it was revealed Dusty is 30 years old, despite his age being stated as 28 on the Channel 4 website as well as shown on episode 3. * Jason Johnson (Kayvan Novak) ‚Äì the 17-year-old middle child, is an amiable, jocular lad, generally kind but stupid. In episode 2, it was hinted that he could be gay. * Evelyn \\"Eve\\" Johnson (Daisy Haggard) ‚Äì the youngest of the Johnson children.

Patrons began pelting the police with donuts and coffee cups. The LAPD called for back-up and arrested a number of rioters. Rechy and the other two original detainees were able to escape.

It marked the beginning of transgender activism in San Francisco.Boyd, Nan Alamilla (2004). \\"San Francisco\\" in the Encyclopedia of Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual and Transgendered History in America, Ed. Marc Stein. Vol. 3. Charles Scribner's Sons. pp. 71‚Äì78. The 1960s was a pivotal period for sexual, gender, and ethnic minorities, as social movements championing civil rights and sexual liberation came to fruition. Even churches, like Glide Memorial Methodist Church in San Francisco, began reaching out to the transgender community. Nevertheless, many police officers resisted these movements and the increasing visibility of these groups, continuing to harass and abuse transgender people. This simultaneous rise in support for transgender rights on the one side and the unwillingness to accept these new ideas on the other created the strain that fueled the riot at Compton's Cafeteria in the summer of 1966. The incident began when a transgender woman resisted arrest by throwing coffee at a police officer. It was followed by drag queens pouring into the streets, fighting back with their high heels and heavy bags. Background Compton's Cafeteria was one of a chain of cafeterias, owned by Gene Compton, in San Francisco from the 1940s to the 1970s. The Tenderloin location of Compton's at 101 Taylor Street (at Turk)‚Äîopen from 1954 to 1972‚Äîwas one of the few places where transgender people, especially trans women who had spent a long evening hustling , could congregate publicly in the city, because they were unwelcome in gay bars due to transphobia. Compton's management and staff, in an effort to deter drag queens and trans women, frequently called the police when they were present causing them to be harassed and arrested for a crime called \\"female impersonation.\\" The cafeteria was open all hours until the riots occurred. Most of the fights occurred from 2-3 am so they were forced to close at midnight. Because cross-dressing was illegal at the time, police could use the presence of transgender people in a bar as a pretext for making a raid and closing the bar.Sears, Clare. ‚ÄúElectric Brilliancy: Cross-Dressing Law and Freak Show Displays in Nineteenth-Century San Francisco.‚Äù WSQ: Women‚Äôs Studies Quarterly 36, no. 3 (December 14, 2008): 170‚Äì87. . Many of the militant hustlers and street queens involved in the riot were members of Vanguard, the first known gay youth organization in the United States founded in 1965, which gained the help of radical ministers working with Glide Memorial Church, a center for progressive social activism in the Tenderloin for many years. A lesbian group of street people was also formed called the Street Orphans.Screaming Queens: The Riot at Compton's Cafeteria (documentary film by Victor Silverman and Susan Stryker, 2005) A number of the women that Susan Stryker interviewed for the documentary film \\"Screaming Queens: The Riot at Compton's Cafeteria\\", who were all members of the transgender community in the Tenderloin District during the time of the riot at Compton's Cafeteria, were involved in street prostitution. Among these women was Tamara Ching, who is now a sex-workers-rights activist. They ended up in the profession, many of them lamented, because they faced job discrimination. Eventually, they stopped trying to seek employment elsewhere, though some ‚Äúfortunate‚Äù ones were saved from the dangers of street prostitution because they could ‚Äúpass‚Äù (i.e. they appeared more feminine and could get jobs as dancers or singers). The women who had to sell sex to survive complained of police harassment and abuse by customers. It is clear that social forces‚Äîsystematic marginalization and discrimination‚Äîhave forced these women into prostitution, the only viable source of income. Cause of the riot In the 1960s the Compton's Cafeteria staff began to call the police to crack down on transgender individuals, who went to the restaurant. Management felt that transgender customers were loitering and causing them to lose more desirable business. In response, they implemented a service fee directed at transgender individuals and blatantly harassed them in an attempt to get them to leave the restaurant. In response to police arrests, the transgender community launched a picket of Compton's Cafeteria.Screaming Queens: The Riot at Compton's Cafeteria. 2005. Film. Although the picket was unsuccessful, it was one of the first demonstrations against police violence directed towards transgender people in San Francisco. On the first night of the riot, the management of Compton's called the police when some transgender customers became raucous. Police officers were known to mistreat transgender people. When one of these known officers attempted to arrest one of the trans women, she threw her coffee in his face. According to the director of Screaming Queens, Susan Stryker, the cafeteria \\"erupted.\\" At that point the riot began, dishes and furniture were thrown, and the restaurant's plate-glass windows were smashed. Police called for reinforcements as the fighting spilled into the street, where a police car had all its windows broken out and a sidewalk newsstand was burned down. Dozens of people fought back against the police who forced them into paddy wagons. The next night, more transgender people, hustlers, Tenderloin street people, and other members of the LGBT community joined in a picket of the cafeteria, which did not allow transgender people back in. The demonstration ended with the newly installed plate-glass windows being smashed again. The exact date of the riot is unknown because 1960 police records no longer exist and the riot was not covered by newspapers. Effects of the riot = Vanguard Street Actions = Following the Compton's riot(s), a queer youth group by the name of Vanguard orchestrated some notable actions. The group of queer youth‚Äîmany transgender, many engaged in survival sex work and without stable housing‚Äîhad formed as a social and political group beginning in 1965. They initially formed under the Glide Memorial Church, a radical offshoot of the United Methodist Church. Vanguard's politics highlighted ‚Äúthe issues facing gay and transgender youth in the 1960s produced radical insights into the connections between economic class, police violence, incarceration, and homophobia.‚Äù In early Autumn of 1966, Vanguard hosted a historic ‚Äústreet sweep‚Äù in response to the events at Compton's. About fifty Vanguard members took to the streets of the Tenderloin with push brooms borrowed from the city. They did so in protest, a direct response to the routine practice of police ‚Äúsweeping‚Äù the streets of known queer neighborhoods‚Äîsuch as the Tenderloin‚Äîto remove all the queer people. Many held handmade signs reading ‚ÄúFall Clean Up: This Is a Vanguard Community Project‚Äù, and ‚ÄúAll trash is before the broom,‚Äù pushing against the idea that they, as people, were in any way disposable or unworthy of human dignity. Vanguard symbolically called into question the fact that police were treating transgender and queer sex workers like ‚Äútrash‚Äù to be ‚Äúswept away,‚Äù and instead reclaimed public space as their own. = Later effects of the riot = Felicia \\"Flames\\" Elizondo speaks at a celebration of the 50th anniversary of the Compton's Cafeteria Riot, August 2016. The riot marked a turning point in the local LGBT movement. According to the online encyclopedia glbtq.com: Felicia \\"Flames\\" Elizondo, who participated in the Compton's riot, spoke at a celebration of the 50th anniversary of the Compton's Cafeteria Riot. She said, \\"A lot of people thought we were sick, mental trash,\\" says Elizondo, who underwent gender reassignment surgery in 1974. \\"Nobody cared whether we lived or died. Our own families abandoned us and we had nowhere to go.\\" It was dangerous for queer folks to exist back in 1966 as there were no equality laws and LGBT people were considered \\"perverts\\" and \\"mental cases\\". Furthermore, transgender people found themselves locked out of most \\"respectable\\" jobs and were often forced to turn to prostitution to survive. Many were beaten, and some were brutally murdered. The intersection of Taylor and Turk Streets, following the 2019 San Francisco Trans March. A sign under the Taylor street sign reads \\"Gene Compton's Cafeteria Way\\". Serving as an overseer to the NTCU was Sergeant Elliott Blackstone, designated in 1962 as the first San Francisco Police Department liaison to what was then called the \\"homophile community.\\" According to Susan Stryker, Compton's Cafeteria riot was ‚Äúthe first known incident of collective militant queer resistance to police harassment in U.S. history.\\" Transgender people finally stood up to the abuse and discrimination by police officers. The riot \\"did not solve the problems that transgender people in the Tenderloin faced daily\\", but prompted the city to begin addressing them as citizens rather than as a problem to be removed. Police brutality towards them decreased over time, and they had less fear of being heckled by the police department for dressing how they chose during the daytime. On June 24, 2016, at the conclusion of the San Francisco Trans March, a new street sign was unveiled, renaming the 100 block of Taylor Street to Gene Compton's Cafeteria Way. In August 2016, a number of events were held to celebrate the 50th anniversary of the riot, including a gathering in Boeddeker Park in the Tenderloin. In 2017, the City of San Francisco recognized the Compton's Transgender Cultural District, the world‚Äôs first legally recognized transgender district. In fiction In the first episode of the 2019 Netflix miniseries Tales of the City, Anna Madrigal (Olympia Dukakis) receives a photograph of herself in front of Compton's, taken shortly after she had arrived in San Francisco. In episode three, her tenant and friend Shawna Hawkins (Ellen Page) learns about the riot from new friend Claire Duncan (Zosia Mamet). The two visit the site and lie down together next to the historical marker. The riot is depicted in episode eight of the series, including historical touches like the throwing of the coffee into a cop‚Äôs face.

It is listed by the National Trust of Australia and is on the Victorian Heritage Register. Astley's Amphitheatre Entertainment on the site of today's Princess Theatre dates back to the Gold Rush years of 1854, when entrepreneur Tom Moore constructed a large, barn-like structure called Astley's Amphitheatre. The venue featured a central ring for equestrian entertainment and a stage at one end for dramatic performances. It was named in honour of the Astley Royal Amphitheatre, also known as Astley's Amphitheatre, near Westminster Bridge, London. It was soon leased by the prolific actor-manager George Coppin, who had already established himself as an actor at the Queen's Theatre, and would go on to build the Olympic (known as the \\"Iron Pot\\") on the corner of Exhibition and Lonsdale Streets - the future site of the Comedy Theatre, build the Haymarket Theatre and Apollo Music Hall, and lease (and eventually rebuild) the Theatre Royal in Bourke Street. In 1857, the amphitheatre was extensively renovated and the facade extended, re-opening as the Princess Theatre and Opera House. The New Princess Theatre The Princess Theatre 1922 By 1885, the theatre came under the control of \\"The Triumvirate\\", a partnership between J. C. Williamson, George Musgrove and Arthur Garner. The existing theatre had become rundown, and so the Triumvirate resolved to demolish the existing building. The new theatre, designed by architect William Pitt, interiors designed by George Gordon, and built by Cockram and Comely, was completed in 1886 at a cost of ¬£50,000. The design is in the exuberant Second Empire style, and the theatre forms part of the Victorian streetscape of Spring Street. The theatre re- opened, again, on 18 December 1886, this time simply known as the Princess Theatre, with a performance of Gilbert and Sullivan's The Mikado. When completed, it featured state-of-the-art electrical stage lighting, as well as Australia's first sliding or retractable roof and ceiling which provided ventilation from the auditorium. The marble staircase and grand foyers were hailed as equal to that of the Paris Opera, the Frankfurt Stadt and the Grand in Bordeaux. The theatre at dusk, July 2010 Williamson left the Triumvirate in 1899 to form his own company, and Musgrove continued operate the theatre until 1910. The Princess came under a rapid succession of different owners until 1915, when Ben Fuller took control. Fuller then went into partnership with Hugh J. Ward, and in 1922 they engaged the architect Henry Eli White to extensively renovate the auditorium and foyers, and add the grand copper awning. The New Princess Theatre reopened on 26 December 1922 with a performance of The O'Brien Girl. The theatre was purchased from Fuller in 1933 by Efftee Films, the film production company of F. W. Thring, the theatrical and film entrepreneur, who had his initials FT carved over the proscenium arch. He produced several musicals there, and made it the first home of his radio station 3XY, founded 1935.Argus, 4 August 1993, p.7, quoted in The Two Frank Thrings, Peter Fitzpatrick, Monash University Publications 2012 When F.W. Thring died, Ben Fuller and Garnet Carroll took over the lease of the Princess in Melbourne and in 1946 they formed another partnership forming Carroll-Fuller Theatres Ltd to purchase the Princess Theatre.http://www.liveperformance.com.au/halloffame/garnetcarroll2.html Stained glass window on the Princess Theatre exterior. After Sir Ben Fuller's death in 1952, Carroll assumed complete control.http://www.liveperformance.com.au/halloffame/garnetcarroll2.html For the following 12 years, often in association with other entrepreneurs, he presented an eclectic array of opera, ballet, musical comedy and drama, though he was constrained by the lack of an interstate circuit. At the Princess in 1954 he hosted the National Theatre Movement‚Äôs gala performance of The Tales of Hoffmann for Queen Elizabeth II and Prince Philip. Other notable productions included Ballet Rambert (1947-48), the Old Vic Theatre Company with Sir Laurence (Lord) Olivier and Vivien Leigh (1948), the Shakespeare Memorial Theatre Company (1949), the Vienna Boys' Choir (1954), the Chinese Classical Theatre (1956) and the Sadler's Wells Opera Company (1960 and 1962). Carroll often staged elaborate American musicals‚Äîamong them Kismet (which he himself produced in 1954), The Sound of Music (1960), The King and I (1960) and Carousel (1964)‚Äîwhile they were still in their early months on Broadway, and tried unknown singers and actors.http://adb.anu.edu.au/biography/carroll- garnet-hannell-9697 Carroll died on 23 August 1964 and ownership passed to his son, John Carroll. For some years he maintained the pattern set by his father, but in 1969 the family company, Carroll Freeholds Pty Ltd, leased the Princess to the Australian Elizabethan Theatre Trust. Over time, the theatre was used less frequently, and the theatre fell into disrepair. 1989 reopening and current operation In 1986, David Marriner purchased the theatre and commenced a renovation and refurbishment to restore the building to its 1922 state, and improve its technical capacity. The refurbished theatre reopened on 9 December 1989 with the musical Les Mis√©rables, followed by The Phantom of the Opera, which established a new record for the longest running show ever staged in Victoria. The Princess Theatre continues to be owned and operated by the Marriner Group as a venue for major musical theatre productions, including Beauty and the Beast, MAMMA MIA!, Jersey Boys and The Book of Mormon. In 2017, it was announced that the international production Harry Potter and the Cursed Child would open at the Princess Theatre in early 2019 for an exclusive Australian season,https://www.theage.com.au/entertainment/hit-play-harry- potter-and-the-cursed-child-coming-to-melbourne-in-2019-20171024-gz6rib.html as just the third location for the production after London and New York.

Opened in August 1860, it is the oldest iron pier in the country. Its length of makes it the second-longest in Great Britain, after Southend Pier. Although at one time spanning , a succession of storms and fires during the late 19th and early 20th centuries reduced its length to that of the present day. The pier has been host to famous entertainers, including Charlie Chaplin in the early 20th century. It was visited by steamliners in its heyday, but silting of the channel meant that by the 1920s very few steamers were able to reach the pier, and the service ceased in 1929. The pier fell into disrepair throughout the late 20th century, and by 1990 it was operating at a significant annual loss with rising maintenance costs. The local council sought to have the pier demolished, but were defeated in their attempt by a single vote. The pier was significantly restored during 2000‚Äì2002, and opened to the public in May 2002. The Southport Pier Tramway ran from Southport Promenade to the pier head at various times in the pier's history with various rolling stock, most recently until June 2015. The pier is recorded in the National Heritage List for England as a designated Grade II listed building, first listed on 18 August 1975. Location At , Southport Pier is the second longest in Great Britain. As a result of silting in the water channel, part of the pier now passes overland before reaching the beach, as the silt has allowed land beneath the pier to be reclaimed. The entrance starts at Promenade Road and follows a route inland next to Princes Park, before crossing over Marine Drive and meeting the beach at approximately half-way along its length. The area that now houses the marine lake and surrounding road at the land-end of the pier was acquired by the pier corporation in 1885, following population growth in the local area and pier extensions in the 1870s. In the late 1920s the council reclaimed a large area of the beach to build an urban park, consisting of a lake, miniature railway and car parking. The pier is a seven-minute walk from Southport railway station, away. History =19th century= Pier and bridge, c. 1890‚Äì1900 Proposals for a pier in Southport were first suggested in 1844, in conjunction with a potential railway from Manchester, with a committee formed in 1852 to help promote its construction. Following debates throughout the following few years about what its intended usage should be, the Southport Pier company was formed in March 1859 with a ¬£12,000 capital. The cost to build the pier was estimated at ¬£8000 (), eventually rising to ¬£8700 () with construction work commencing in August 1859. The pier's primary purpose was to be a promenade as opposed to a ship docking pier, and thus is considered to be the country's first pleasure pier. Southport Pier opening ceremony, 1860 A year later, on 2 August 1860, the pier was officially opened with a grand procession; at a length of it was the second-longest and first iron-constructed pleasure pier in the country. Waiting rooms for boat passengers were added during the pier's first few years of operation, and a cable-operated tramway had been installed by 1865. The pier was extended to in 1868 and was used by various steamer ships, including those of the Blackpool, Lytham and Southport Steam Packet Company, with services operating from the pier to resorts including Fleetwood and Llandudno. Visitors to the pier had to pay a toll, priced deliberately high at 6d (equivalent to ¬£2.75 in 2016) to ensure only the most affluent could afford it. As the 1870s progressed, the numbers of working class visitors increased and tolls were reduced to 2d. Storm damage was a frequent occurrence ‚Äì several storms caused damage to the pier's foundations and buildings throughout the late 1880s and early 1890s. A fire in September 1897 destroyed the original pavilion; its replacement was opened in January 1902 and considered grander, with the inclusion of an auditorium. =20th century= A popular attraction from 1903 were an array of divers, typically diving from the tea house roof several times daily; the most popular and longest-serving were Professors Osbourne and Powsey, the latter frequently jumping off the pier on a bicycle. From 1906, the newly constructed pavilion was leased out to play host to a variety of entertainers, including Charlie Chaplin and George Robey. Following the First World War, the pavilion was renamed the Casino and its main attraction on offer was dancing. This period was a financial success for the pier, with a net profit of ¬£9155 () in 1913 and an annual average profit of ¬£6750 () during the 1920s. By the early 1920s, silting in the water channel allowed for land reclamation, whilst it became more and more difficult for steamer ships to reach the pier; the service ceased entirely in 1929. Profits fell during the 1930s depression, compounded with a large fire in July 1933 destroying the pier head. The cost of damage was estimated at ¬£6000 () which was unaffordable to the Southport Pier Company, who ended up selling the pier to Southport Corporation in June 1936 for ¬£34,744 (). The pier was closed to the public during the Second World War to house and operate searchlights to detect enemy aircraft travelling to Liverpool docks, yet was not physically separated from the land like other piers were during this time. The pier did not reopen again until 1950 and in June 1959, suffered a significant fire which destroyed of decking, reducing its length to the present day and for a period of time making it the third longest pier after Herne Bay Pier, until that was destroyed by a storm in 1978. Sefton Council acquired ownership of the pier in 1974 following national reorganisation of local government and it was designated as a Grade II listed structure on 18 August 1975 despite being in a state of deterioration. A grant of ¬£62,400 () was awarded in 1983 by the European Regional Development Fund to strengthen the pier's structure. The pier in 2000, shortly before restoration Deterioration continued during the latter 20th century and worsened by a storm in 1989, causing extensive damage. Despite its listed status, Sefton Council sought to demolish the pier in December 1990 due to the rising cost of repairs and maintenance, yet was defeated by a single vote. Operating at an annual loss of ¬£100,000 and with estimates close to ¬£1 million to secure the future of the pier, plus a further ¬£250,000 required every five years for repainting, a charitable trust was formed in 1993 to upkeep the pier; various funding was secured in the subsequent years to maintain the pier's operation. In February 1997, a grant of ¬£34,000 () was provided from lottery funding in order for a structural survey to be undertaken, confirming the pier's then poor condition and recommending its closure. In October 1998, the pier received a heritage grant of ¬£1.7 million from the Heritage Lottery Fund, awarded to support restoration and access. =21st century= The modern pier pavilion, pictured in 2010 After falling into disrepair and subsequently closing, work to restore the pier began in 2000 and was completed in 2002, opening to the public in May 2002 with the restoration costing ¬£7.2 million, complete with a new tram. Restoration of the pier formed part of a wider redevelopment strategy, including a new sea wall to help prevent flooding, landscaping around the pier and a new ¬£28 million Ocean Plaza shopping complex. The pier today is an open structure, with modern railings on an older base and a deck made of hardwood slats, affording a partial view of the sea below. Along the walkway are name plaques that local people funded to help towards raising the restoration funds. The modern pavilion structure at the pier head was designed by Liverpool architects Shed KM and cost ¬£1.2 million; the building houses a cafeteria with airport style floor to ceiling windows overlooking the beach and a collection of vintage mechanical amusement machines and penny arcade. The exhibition of Edwardian and Victorian machines operates on pre- decimalisation pennies, available to purchase on-site at ¬£1 for 10 old pennies. Plans were announced in April 2017 to renovate the pier as part of a ¬£2.9 million makeover, with two-thirds of the cost coming from the Coastal Communities Fund to include repairs and new retail units. Additionally, the council seek to undertake repainting and mechanical works, as well as pavilion improvements and providing easier access to the pier from the beach. Tramway The Promenade Express, pictured in 2009 Initially, the pier had a baggage line from 1863, though this was replaced in 1864 when the pier was widened to provide a steam-driven tramway capable of transporting passengers and their luggage. The line was re-laid in 1893, with electrification coming in April 1905. The rolling stock was rebuilt in 1936 when the line was taken over by Southport Corporation. The pier was closed during the Second World War, but when it reopened the tram did not reopen with it, as the town had lost its supply of DC electricity. The tram line eventually reopened in 1950, with the track gauge changed and moved to the side of the pier (previously central) and from 1954 operated with new diesel trains, known as the Silver Belle and built by local engineer Harry Barlow who owned the Lakeside Miniature Railway. The stock was replaced in 1973 with English Rose, which operated until the mid-1990s, at which time there were doubts over the pier's future. The Silver Belle stock became derelict at Steamport for some years, before moving to the West Lancashire Light Railway for conversion into carriages. The pier tram in 2011 The restoration in 2002 provided a new narrow gauge tram track in the centre of a widened deck and on 1 August 2005, a new twin-section articulated, battery powered tram car started service on this track, with a passenger capacity of 74 people. The tram ran every day of the year except Christmas Day and provided a half-hourly service in both directions. In July 2013, the tram service was suspended following the discovery of cracks within the supporting columns and ceased running entirely in June 2015 due to rising maintenance costs and council cost-cutting measures. It was replaced by an extension of a pre-existing smaller land train, with the tram removed for sale in March 2016. Cultural references The pier has been featured in films, such as the 1985 film Mr. Love, which was filmed primarily in Southport. In 2014, a BBC drama titled There To Here filmed some scenes at Southport pier, which takes place on June 1996 in Manchester when an IRA bomb caused significant damage to Manchester's city centre.

It was distributed by Warner Bros. Television Distribution. Produced and broadcast in the world's largest television market, the show became popular with millions of children. As characterized by The New York Times, The Magic Garden \\"was a cheerful, low- budget, inadvertently psychedelic half-hour show in which Ms. Janis and Ms. Demas sat on giant toadstools, spoke to flowers, sang songs and told stories.\\" Summary Carole and Paula, the main characters and hosts of the show, sing several songs throughout each episode, often accompanied by Paula's acoustic guitar. The show takes place entirely within the Magic Garden, a colorful set that includes the Magic Tree, which lowers various objects from its branches. Also found throughout the garden are swings, a stone path, a shed, and the Chuckle Patch, a giggling bed of flowers that grows leaves with jokes on one side and the punch line on the other. Many conversations take place at a low stone wall with Sherlock (a mischievous squirrel puppet with a love for peanuts) and Flapper (a colorful bird who was a later addition to the characters in the garden). Stories are often acted out using costumes and props provided by the Story Box. In addition to songs, games, and jokes, the characters provide life lessons for viewers, and extend personal greetings to members of their television audience‚Äîfor example: \\"Hello, Judy. Hello, Jeffrey.\\" The show aired on WPIX at various times during the day on weekdays but only four days a week Monday through Thursday from 1971 through 1984. At some points, it led out of morning cartoons, leading into religious programming. After 1975, it aired afternoons, leading out of religious and public affairs shows into the afternoon cartoons. On Fridays until 1981, in place of The Magic Garden, another children's show produced at WPIX called Joya's Fun School aired in its time slot. After that other children's shows would replace The Magic Garden in the Friday slot. Finally WPIX dropped The Magic Garden altogether on September 14, 1984. WPIX wanted to be strictly entertainment programming during daytime hours. They wanted to modernize their programming. In the year before they dropped The 700 Club and at the time they dropped The Magic Garden, they dropped their weekday non-commercial hour of public affairs programs as well. Development and reception The hosts Carole Demas and Paula Janis, who had met as students at Brooklyn's Midwood High School, and later became New York City school teachers, helped to develop the show. In 1971, Demas (having worked in television and on the professional stage, and in rehearsal for her starring role in Grease on Broadway) was invited by WPIX to host an early-afternoon cartoon program. During the audition, Demas suggested an alternative idea. Asking Janis to come with her to a second audition, Demas and Janis presented a slower-paced show designed to avoid overstimulating young children's developing brains. After being hired, the two women spent the next year developing The Magic Garden, with the help of former Muppets puppeteer Cary Antebi, who created Sherlock. Many of the folk songs featured on the show came from material that Demas and Janis had created as schoolteachers.Itzkoff, Dave. \\"For ‚ÄòThe Magic Garden,‚Äô It‚Äôs Spring All Over Again,\\" New York Times (Nov. 10, 2008). Fifty-two half-hour episodes, a one-hour holiday special (which aired on December 13, 1981)and a 1 hour retrospective THE MAGIC GARDEN STILL GROWING (which aired in 2002) were produced. According to Carole and Paula's Web site, local ratings were equal to or exceeded those of other shows in its genre, such as Sesame Street.\\"The Magic Garden,\\" Carole and Paula‚ÄîFriends Forever Web Site. Accessed May 7, 2014. Three record albums were released due to a high demand, one of which received a Grammy nomination. The program received a citation from Actions for Children's Television, and from the Children's Television Workshop for its creative efforts. On Thanksgiving Day 2002, a special hosted by Carole and Paula aired on WPIX titled The Magic Garden: Still Growing, on which the duo reminisced about the show. This was followed by the broadcast of two episodes shown for the first time on the channel in eighteen years. A DVD including ten episodes, as well as CDs, were released in 2008. On December 13, 2013, WPIX announced via social media that The Magic Garden Christmas Special, which had not been seen since its broadcast 32 years before, had been \\"recently discovered...in a forgotten basement vault\\" and would be aired by the station on the following Christmas Day. After popular acclaim, WPIX has repeated the episode at Christmastime every year since. Currently, Demas is married and appears on stage, television, film, concerts, and cabaret. Janis works in television and has three children. They continue to promote The Magic Garden by doing public appearances and live children's shows billed as Carole and Paula: Friends Forever. Demas and Janis are also working with the WPIX Archives department on a series of \\"Magic Garden Moments,\\" recollections of the original series, for publication on the archive's Facebook page.

It was designed by Ross Brawn and John Piper, and was built and run by Tom Walkinshaw Racing (TWR), on behalf of Jaguar Cars. Design The 1991 season marked the introduction of the FIA‚Äôs new, and controversial, 3.5 Litre Formula which replaced the highly successful Group C category that had been used in the World Sports Car Championship since 1982. However, due to a small number of entries in the new 3.5 litre formula heavily penalised Group C cars were allowed participate in the newly created C2 category for the 1991 season but Jaguar participated in the new formula. To comply with the new regulations Jaguar produced an all-new car, the XJR-14. It was designed by Ross Brawn and John Piper, and was built by Tom Walkinshaw Racing (TWR). In the past, TWR's Jaguars had been designed under the direction of Tony Southgate, while Brawn worked with a large design staff (12 according to John Piper); a paradigm shift (albeit small) in its own right and reflective of Brawn's Formula One background. The abandonment of the Group C fuel consumption regulations meant a change in aerodynamic design philosophy. Coupled that with vastly different packaging requirements for a small, light, normally aspirated engine meant that concerns over drag became a secondary requirement to downforce. The new design, lower kerb weight of and higher downforce levels meant that the XJR-14 was a lot faster in corners compared to the previous Group C front runners. Engine The primary feature of the new regulations centred on 3.5-litre naturally aspirated engines. Although the XJR-14's predecessor, the XJR-11, used a twin turbo-charged 3.5-litre engine derived from the Metro 6R4-derived JV6 engine, in order to comply with the new rules the two turbochargers would have needed to be removed. Naturally this wasn't a realistic option, nor was it ever considered, given the design compromises of not using a bespoke engine. But given the Jaguar-Ford connection, it was a decided to utilise the 3.5-litre Ford HB V8 Formula One power plant. Developed by Geoff Goddard and most notably used by the Benetton Formula One team, but now badged as a Jaguar, the Ford HB was detuned to about 11,500 rpm (compared to about 13,000 rpm) and aimed to produce slightly less power (about vs. around 700 bhp) with aims at enhanced reliability. Race results Three chassis were built and used for 1991: 591, 691, & 791\\\\. In the early part of the 1991 World Sportscar Championship season the XJR-14 was in a league of its own, totally outclassing its rivals and in particular the Peugeot 905 and Mercedes-Benz C291. Only the opening race went Peugeot's way, but that was seen more as a result of luck than the 905's competitiveness. The fact that Jaguar already had a race proven engine certainly helped the team‚Äôs cause, but the rest of the car was far superior to its rivals. It wasn't until midway through the season that the Jaguar met its match through Peugeot's new 905B. This meant a hard fight with the new and quickly improving Peugeot squad for the rest of the season, but Jaguar was able to hold on and secure the manufacturers title with 3 victories. At the 1991 24 Hours of Le Mans, Jaguar initially entered two XJR-14s but later decided that the XJR-14 would not be capable of finishing the distance due to unknowns in the development of the Cosworth HB to last 24 hours. Jaguar instead decided to enter three older XJR-12s which entered in the C2 class. Although the XJR-12s did not manage to win, Jaguar's decision not to run the untested XJR-14 was vindicated by the fact that Peugeot's 905 failed to finish the race. Mercedes also withdrew its C291 in favour of its older C11 models. After 1991, Jaguar decided not to continue in Group C, believing that they had spent enough time in Group C and the instability of rules recently in the World Sportscar Championship. Opting against further development of the XJR-16, TWR sent the XJR-14 to the United States for the 1992 IMSA Camel GTP championship. Chassis 691 (Rebadged as #192) debuted at the 1992 Grand Prix of Miami where it broke the track record by four seconds. Without a major upgrade to the suspension and with the car unable to deal with the high G loads of U.S circuits, the XJR-14 was unable to beat the latest challengers from Toyota and Nissan, forced to finish third in the championship with only two victories. Jaguar continued to use the three updated 1991 chassis throughout the season. Derivatives Meanwhile, TWR had reached an agreement to supply more XJR-14 chassis to Mazda, minus the Cosworth V8s but installed with Mazda-badged Judd V10s for the World Sportscar Championship. Mazda would rebadge the XJR-14s as MXR-01s. The MXR-01 was essentially a productionised XJR-14 and as there had been no ongoing development they ended up not being particularly competitive, scoring no wins and finishing third in the championship. Several years later, TWR would resurrect XJR-14 chassis #691/192 for the development of a new prototype for Porsche. They renamed the car the TWR-Porsche WSC-95. Its most significant feature was that it had the roof removed, turning it into an open cockpit prototype to run under the then-new LMP regulations. The WSC-95 would carry a Porsche 3.0L turbocharged Flat-6. After chassis #691 was modified, TWR built a second WSC-95 from scratch. In both the 1996 and 1997 24 Hours of Le Mans, the TWR-Porsches were able to take the overall win. See Chassis Log.

Both manga and anime were licensed by Anime 18. Plot Taking place in a post-apocalyptic fantasy world, this is the story about three beautiful, young females named Sonya, Kei, and Lukish. They are in an extremely popular girl band called The Pussy Cats which is managed by an old hag. However, this is only a cover up. In actuality, the girls are the notorious female assassins known as The Midnight Panther, who will kill men for money by first sleeping with them and executing them in their own unique manner. The old hag is, in reality, a witch who arranges the transactions. However, when the girls receive a commission to kill the despotic king who is murdering his subjects, one of them takes the job personally and requests the honor. Characters ; Sonya : :: A very sexy, dark haired buxom woman who has the ability to grow and retract her extra resistant hair which she uses to garotte her victims - but not before she seduces them. * Kei : :: An active blonde girl who can shapeshift into a leopard. She uses this feline form to devour her victims after she plays with them. * Lukish : :: Also known as \\"Lou\\", she is the youngest of the three. Lukish was separated at a young age from her family, a king and queen, when they were killed by her brother Bad. After suffering an injury because of her escape, she was rescued and taken in by the hag. After being given treatments, Lukish went through several changes. Her once pale skin was now a dark tan color. She gained exceedingly great strength, as well as immunity to poisons and is, herself, poisonous. Anyone touching her skin for an extended period runs the risk of dying a slow, horrible death. It is revealed these changes were due to the medicine's ingredients being from the liver of a Basilisk dragon. As Lukish is the youngest of the Midnight Panthers, she is not allowed to participate in assassination missions and instead has to hunt dragons as ingredients for the old hag. * Old Hag : :: A strange, ugly old woman who remains unnamed throughout the feature. She runs the activities of both the Pussy Cats and the Midnight Panther. She has a wide understanding of alchemy, especially with toxins, and used that knowledge to save Lukish when she was injured long ago. In the manga, it is revealed that she is the founder of Midnight Panther. * Dark : :: Kei's panther companion. He is very protective of her. * King Bad : :: A tyrannical king who is killing his subject out of a whim... and the half-brother of Lukish. Because he was born out of wedlock, Bad was excluded as heir to the throne, the duty given to Lukish (who was disguised as a boy since only males could inherit the throne). Bad then killed his parents and nearly killed Lukish before she escaped. He later regretted his actions, because he was secretly in love with Lukish (he had no idea that Lukish was actually female and believed himself to be homosexual).

Kaakka Thuruthu (Crow Island) is a small island. It is a seasonal home for migratory birds. By the end of October, birds arrive. Some range to Siberia and Europe and from Himalayan regions, while some of the resident species come from Tamil Nadu and Karnataka. During April, they start departing. The best time for bird watching is between June and August. Forr migratory birds, the best time is November to February. SEED Global School is situated at maranchery.

Biohydrogen is H2 that is produced biologically. Interest is high in this technology because H2 is a clean fuel and can be readily produced from certain kinds of biomass.Y.-H. Percival Zhang \\"Hydrogen Production from Carbohydrates: A Mini-Review\\" in \\"Sustainable Production of Fuels, Chemicals, and Fibers from Forest Biomass\\" ACS Symposium Series, 2011, Volume 1067, pages=203-216. Many challenges characterize this technology, including those intrinsic to H2, such as storage and transportation of a noncondensible gas. Hydrogen producing organisms are poisoned by O2. Yields of H2 are often low. Biochemical principles The main reactions involve fermentation of sugars. Important reactions start with glucose, which is converted to acetic acid: :C6H12O6 \\\\+ 2 H2O ‚Üí 2 CH3CO2H + 2 CO2 \\\\+ 4 H2 A related reaction gives formate instead of carbon dioxide: :C6H12O6 \\\\+ 2 H2O ‚Üí 2 CH3CO2H + 2 HCO2H + 2 H2 These reactions are exergonic by 216 and 209 kcal/mol, respectively. H2 production is catalyzed by two hydrogenases. One is called [FeFe]-hydrogenase; the other is called [NiFe]-hydrogenase. Many organisms express these enzymes. Notable examples are members of the genera Clostridium, Desulfovibrio, Ralstonia, and the pathogen Helicobacter. E. coli is the workhorse for genetic engineering of hydrogenases. It has been estimated that 99% of all organisms utilize dihydrogen (H2). Most of these species are microbes and their ability to use H2 as a metabolite arises from the expression of H2 metalloenzymes known as hydrogenases. Hydrogenases are sub-classified into three different types based on the active site metal content: iron-iron hydrogenase, nickel-iron hydrogenase, and iron hydrogenase. The active site structures of the three types of hydrogenase enzymes. Production by algae The biological hydrogen production with algae is a method of photobiological water splitting which is done in a closed photobioreactor based on the production of hydrogen as a solar fuel by algae.2013 - Gimpel JA, et al Advances in microalgae engineering and synthetic biology applications for biofuel production Algae produce hydrogen under certain conditions. In 2000 it was discovered that if C. reinhardtii algae are deprived of sulfur they will switch from the production of oxygen, as in normal photosynthesis, to the production of hydrogen.Wired- Mutant Algae Is Hydrogen Factory =Photosynthesis= Photosynthesis in cyanobacteria and green algae splits water into hydrogen ions and electrons. The electrons are transported over ferredoxins. Fe-Fe-hydrogenases (enzymes) combine them into hydrogen gas. In Chlamydomonas reinhardtii Photosystem II produces in direct conversion of sunlight 80% of the electrons that end up in the hydrogen gas. Light-harvesting complex photosystem II light-harvesting protein LHCBM9 promotes efficient light energy dissipation. The Fe-Fe- hydrogenases need an anaerobic environment as they are inactivated by oxygen. Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy is used to examine metabolic pathways. =Specialized chlorophyll= The chlorophyll (Chl) antenna size in green algae is minimized, or truncated, to maximize photobiological solar conversion efficiency and H2 production. The truncated Chl antenna size minimizes absorption and wasteful dissipation of sunlight by individual cells, resulting in better light utilization efficiency and greater photosynthetic productivity by the green alga mass culture. =Economics= It would take about 25,000 square kilometre algal farming to produce biohydrogen equivalent to the energy provided by gasoline in the US alone. This area represents approximately 10% of the area devoted to growing soya in the US.Growing hydrogen for the cars of tomorrow =Bioreactor design issues= * Restriction of photosynthetic hydrogen production by accumulation of a proton gradient. * Competitive inhibition of photosynthetic hydrogen production by carbon dioxide. * Requirement for bicarbonate binding at photosystem II (PSII) for efficient photosynthetic activity. * Competitive drainage of electrons by oxygen in algal hydrogen production. * Economics must reach competitive price to other sources of energy and the economics are dependent on several parameters. * A major technical obstacle is the efficiency in converting solar energy into chemical energy stored in molecular hydrogen. Attempts are in progress to solve these problems via bioengineering. History In 1933, Marjory Stephenson and her student Stickland reported that cell suspensions catalysed the reduction of methylene blue with H2. Six years later, Hans Gaffron observed that the green photosynthetic alga Chlamydomonas reinhardtii, would sometimes produce hydrogen.Algae: Power Plant of the Future? In the late 1990s Anastasios Melis discovered that deprivation of sulfur induces the alga to switch from the production of oxygen (normal photosynthesis) to the production of hydrogen. He found that the enzyme responsible for this reaction is hydrogenase, but that the hydrogenase lost this function in the presence of oxygen. Melis also discovered that depleting the amount of sulfur available to the algae interrupted their internal oxygen flow, allowing the hydrogenase an environment in which it can react, causing the algae to produce hydrogen.Reengineering Algae To Fuel The Hydrogen Economy Chlamydomonas moewusii is also a promising strain for the production of hydrogen. Industrial hydrogen Competing for biohydrogen, at least for commercial applications, are many mature industrial processes. Steam reforming of natural gas - sometimes referred to as steam methane reforming (SMR) - is the most common method of producing bulk hydrogen at about 95% of the world production.P. H√§ussinger, R.

Toth joined the Doobies in 2005 following his departure from Vertical Horizon. Always interested in music, Toth says that he has been drumming most of his life. He made good use of his father's record collection and was active in all music programs in East Lyme, Connecticut, playing in his high school band at East Lyme High School. He went on to the University of Miami's Frost School of Music, where he received a Bachelor of Music degree in 1994. While still at school, Toth became a member of the funk/rock band Jennifer Culture. Toth has played in numerous other rock and funk bands over the last decade. Most notably, he was a member of Vertical Horizon from 1996‚Äì2005, which yielded a multi platinum album Everything You Want, the title track of which also charted #1. Toth's association with the group began when he was working at a Boston Borders Books; The mother of Vertical Horizon's lead singer and guitarist Matt Scannell, was shopping in the bookstore and asked Ed for a Vertical Horizon CD, which he had listened to and quite enjoyed. His enthusiasm for the recording impressed Scannell's mother so much that, in gratitude for the assistance she received at the store, she offered to put the bookstore manager and a friend on the guest list for a Vertical Horizon show at Mama Kin, an Aerosmith-owned nightclub, also in Boston. Toth went to the show as the manager's friend; and when the band had an opening for a drummer, Toth auditioned for the spot. When the Doobie Brothers' drummer, Keith Knudsen, died of cancer in 2005; Toth was selected to fill his spot with the band. He has remained as drummer for the band, first in addition to Michael Hossack. After Hossack's untimely passing, Tony Pia was added, and after Pia's departure, Toth became the sole drummer in the band. Toth has been influenced by Stewart Copeland, Neil Peart, Bill Bruford, and a host of other virtuoso drummers. He has also produced some critically acclaimed albums and started a band called Cooper with his friend, Tim Bradshaw.

He taught as a professor at the University of Erlangen, Charles University of Prague, University of T√ºbingen (1866-), University of Munich (1871-). He was a researcher of Roman law.  Life  His father was a Doctor of Laws, his grandfather a master baker in Weiler. Brinz studied in Munich and Berlin and then entered the judicial service of his home state of Bavaria. In Berlin, Professor Adolf August Friedrich Rudorff had encouraged him in the detailed scientific study of Roman law, something which he intensified during his practical work. In 1851 the University of Erlangen-Nuremberg made him an au√üerordentlicher Professor (i.e. professor without chair). From 1854 onwards, he worked there as a full professor (ordentlicher Professor) for Roman law. In 1857 he took up a similar position at the Charles University in Prague. In Prague, Brinz also became politically active, becoming a member of the Bohemian parliament in 1861 and later taking a seat in the Austrian Reichsrat. In the Bohemian parliament he was a dedicated parliamentary orator and politician and, together with the other leaders of the German party, Johann Friedrich Wilhelm Herbst and Leopold Hasner von Artha, resolutely defended German interests. In 1866 he took up a professorship at the University of T√ºbingen. Here he finished his Textbook of the Pandects (Lehrbuch der Pandekten). He rejected a mandate to join the parliament of W√ºrttemberg, but thereupon the parliament elected him a member of the constitutional court. From 1871 onwards, Alois von Brinz taught Roman civil law at the University of Munich was eventually elected Rector of the university. In 1872 he was awarded the Order of Merit of the Bavarian Crown and due to the Order's statutes, thus entered the German nobility. In 1883 he was elected an ordinary member of the Class for History of the Bavarian Academy of Sciences and Humanities.

(1983). Stratigraphic Correlation Chart of Pennsylvania: G75, Pennsylvania Geologic Survey, Harrisburg, Pennsylvania. It is closely related to lizards and the tuatara. Based on a partial skeleton missing part of the tail, some ribs, a hand, and parts of the legs, it was a small animal, about 10 centimeters (4 in) long from the skull to the hips. Like its relative Kuehneosaurus, it was able to glide short distances using 'wings' consisting of highly elongated ribs covered with skin. These gliding membranes would have had a convex upper surface and a concave lower surface, thus creating a simple airfoil structure well-suited to gliding. This method of gliding is also seen in Coelurosauravus and the modern Draco, neither of which are closely related to Icarosaurus. Discovery and history The only known fossil skeleton which definitely belongs to Icarosaurus was found in 1960 in North Bergen, New Jersey by Alfred Siefker, a teenager at the time, who stumbled upon the specimen while exploring a quarry. Siefker brought the specimen to scientists at the American Museum of Natural History in New York for identification and preparation.Wong, K.

The fossil remained in the collections of the AMNH until the late 1980s. In 1989, Siefker reclaimed the specimen, which he kept in a private collection during the following decade. In 2000, Siefker sold the fossil at auction in San Francisco through the auction house Butterfield & Butterfield, despite concerns from paleontologists that the sale could render the specimen unavailable for scientific study. The fossil sold for US$167,000, only half of its appraised value, to Dick Spight of California. That same year, Spight donated the Icarosaurus holotype back to the AMNH, where it was put on display 7 October 2000.

It perpendicularly straddles the Anda peninsula in Gloppen Municipality between the Nordfjorden and Gloppefjorden. The airport has an asphalt runway measuring and aligned 09/27. Services are provided by Wider√∏e on public service obligation with the Ministry of Transport and Communications. The airport is owned and operated by the state- owned Avinor and served 37,272 passengers in 2013. The airport was opened on 1 July 1975 as the only public airport serving Nordfjord, four years after the other regional airports in Sogn og Fjordane county. Originally the airport was served with de Havilland Canada Twin Otters. The airport was plagued with severe turbulence and low regularity. A terminal expansion took place in 1987 and the runway was slightly expanded in 2010. History The first four airports in Sogn og Fjordane and southern Sunnm√∏re opened on 1 July 1971: Flor√∏ Airport: F√∏rde Airport, √òyrane; Sogndal Airport, Hauk√•sen and √òrsta‚ÄìVolda Airport, Hovden. This left the district of Nordfjord without an airport. Four locations were considered; in addition to Anda, these were Markane in Stryn, Bj√∏rlomona in Eid and Mona in Sandane. Anda was ultimately selected. The airport opened on 1 July 1975. Services were part of the West Coast route operated by Wider√∏e with their 19-seat de Havilland Canada Twin Otters. Services were originally flown to Bergen Airport, Flesland; √Ölesund Airport, Vigra and other regional airports on the coast.Arnesen: 119 Wider√∏e de Havilland Canada Dash-8 103 at Sandane Airport To a much greater degree than other regional airports in the area, Anda was subject to severe wind, frequently canceling flights. This was in part due to severe turbulence during the landing. Combined with poor navigation, this caused several near- accidents. This prompted additional navigational equipment to be installed. The airport has had much lower regularity than the other airports in the county. The airport initially had two man-years in the tower and two and a half for other operations. The airport had two employees on duty at any time: one in the tower and one which looked after operations and manned the fire and rescue service, as well as parts of the ground handling. The terminal building was minimal, and check-in was handled by a travel agency in Sandane. This changed in 1987 when the terminal building was rebuilt and the check-in moved to the airport. Wider√∏e replaced its Twin Otters with the de Havilland Canada Dash 8 in the early 1990s. Ownership of the airport passed from Gloppen Municipality to the Civil Aviation Administration (later renamed Avinor) on 1 January 1997. Airport security was introduced on 1 January 2005. The airport was closed between 1 March and 26 August 2010 for renovations costing NOK 150 million. The main work was lengthening the runway by . The European route E39 is built in a tunnel under the extended runway. Facilities Sandane Airport is located at Anda in Gloppen, Norway. It is situated perpendicularly on a peninsula which cuts between Nordfjorden and Gloppefjorden. Both ends of the runway are close to sleep hillsides which dive into the fjords. Travel + Leisure included Sandane in its 2009 list of the world's seventeen scariest runways. The aerodrome has a reference elevation of 60 meters (196 ft). The asphalt runway measures and is aligned 08/26. It has a takeoff run available (TORA) of and a landing distance available (LDA) of . The airport is equipped with category 4 fire and rescue service. The airport is situated from Sandane. Paid parking, taxis and car rental are available at the airport. Airlines and destinations E39 route Wider√∏e provides the only scheduled services at Sandane Airport. They are operated as public service obligation with the Ministry of Transport and Communications and are flown with Dash 8-100 aircraft. Services are provided to Oslo with intermediate stops in Sogndal.Larsen: 5 Operation of the airport runs at a deficit of NOK 20 million in 2012. In addition the routes are subsidies at a cost of NOK 1163 per passenger.Larsen: 18 Combined the air service received subsidies of NOK 1,476 per year. Sandane Airport served 37,272 passengers, 2,977 aircraft movements and 1.5 tonnes of cargo. Road connections The airport is located at the road E39. Taxis and rental cars are available. Sandane is located away. Nordfjordeid is located from the airport, but that includes a ferry connection. People in Nordfjordeid can also drive to √òrsta-Volda Airport, Hovden which from 2012 can be driven without using a ferry, but that is away. Future Avinor is considering the regional airport structure in Southern Norway and has looked at the fate of Sandane airport. Of the five airports in the northwest, Sandane is by far the least used. Avinor has started a process to look at the airport structure in Sogn og Fjordane. After 2010, no new aircraft can be purchased except for small ones, which can use very short runways such as Sandane. Early plans have looked at closing down F√∏rde Airport, Bringeland and Sandane Airport while expanding the runway at Flor√∏ Airport to . This would allow for jetliners to operate from Flor√∏ to Oslo with significantly lower ticket prices and remove the need for subsidies. Previously, the Ministry of Transport and Communications has proposed closing Sandane Airport and splitting the traffic between F√∏rde and √òrsta-Volda Airport, Hovden. The road distance from Sandane to F√∏rde-Bringeland is . People in Nordfjordeid and Stryn on the other side of Nordfjorden have been users of Sandane Airport. Road projects, such as the 2012 opening of the Kviv Tunnel has created one hour road distance without ferry for them to Hovden. Combined with the inability to extend the runway at Sandane further, this could cause the authorities to close down the airport.

Built in the 1860s, it is also the oldest and longest of the three. Although originally intended only as a promenade, competition forced the pier to widen its attractions to include theatres and bars. Unlike Blackpool's other piers, which attracted the working classes with open air dancing and amusements, North Pier catered for the \\"better-class\\" market, with orchestra concerts and respectable comedians. Until 2011, it was the only Blackpool pier that consistently charged admission. The pier is designated by English Heritage as a Grade II listed building, due to its status as the oldest surviving pier created by Eugenius Birch. As of 2019 it is still in regular use, despite having suffered damage from fires, storms and collisions with boats. Its attractions include bars, a theatre, a carousel and an arcade. One of the oldest remaining Sooty glove puppets is on display commemorating Harry Corbett buying the original puppet there. Location North Pier was built at the seaward end of Talbot Road, where the town's first railway station, Blackpool North, was built. Its name reflects its location as the most northerly of Blackpool's three piers. It is about north of Blackpool Tower, which is roughly the midpoint of Blackpool's promenade. The sea front is particularly straight and flat on this stretch of coastline, and the pier extends at right angles into the Irish Sea, more or less level with the promenade. History North Pier, with cast iron columns visible The construction of Blackpool Pier (eventually North Pier) started in May 1862, in Layton-cum-Warbreck, part of the parish of Bispham. In October 1862 severe storms suggested that the planned height of the pier was insufficient, and it was increased by . North Pier was the second of fourteen piers designed by Eugenius Birch, and since Margate Pier was destroyed by a storm in 1978, it is the oldest of the remaining examples of his work still in use. It was the first of Birch's piers to be built by Glasgow engineering firm Richard Laidlaw and Son. The pier, which cost ¬£11,740 to build, originally consisted of a promenade long and wide, extending to wide at the pier-head. The bulk of the pier was constructed from cast iron, with a wooden deck laid on top. The cast iron piles on which the structure rests were inserted using Birch's screw pile process; the screw-tipped piles were twisted into the sand until they hit bedrock. This made construction much quicker and easier, and guaranteed that the pier had a solid foundation. The cast iron columns, in diameter, were filled with concrete for stability at intervals of , and supported by struts that were on average were slightly more than thick. The pier's promenade deck is lined with wooden benches with ornamental cast iron backs. At intervals along the pier are hexagonal kiosks built around 1900 in wood and glass with minaret roofs topped with decorative finials. On opening two of the kiosks were occupied by a bookstall and confectionery stall and the kiosks near the ends of the pier were seated shelters. The pier-head is a combination of 420 tons of cast iron and 340 tons of wrought iron columns; standing above the low water line, it sees a regular change in sea level due to the tide. =Opening= The North Pier's opening ceremony The pier was officially opened in a grand ceremony on 21 May 1863, even though the final had not yet been completed. All the shops in the area were closed and decorated with flags and streamers for the ceremony, which included a procession and a cannon salute, and was attended by more than 20,000 visitors. Although the town only had a population of approximately 4,000, more than 200,000 holiday makers regularly stayed there during the summer months; this included 275,000 admissions in 1863, 400,000 in 1864 and 465,000 the following year. The pier was officially opened by Major Preston, and he and 150 officials then travelled to the Clifton Hotel for a celebratory meal. The pier was intended primarily for leisure rather than seafaring; for the price of 2d (worth approximately ¬£4.90 in 2012)Comparing average earnings between 1863 and 2012, 2 old pence is valued at approximately ¬£4.90 by MeasuringWorth.com the pier provided the opportunity for visitors to walk close to the sea without distractions. This fee was insufficient to deter \\"trippers'\\", which led to Major Preston campaigning for a new pier to cater for the 'trippers'. In 1866, the government agreed that a second pier could be built, despite objections from the Blackpool Pier Company that it was close to their pier and therefore unnecessary. =19th century= As permitted by the original parliamentary order, a landing jetty was built at the end of North Pier in incremental stages between 1864 and 1867. The full length of the jetty was , and the extensions increased the pier's total length to its current . The Blackpool Pier Company used the jetty to operate pleasure steamers that made trips to the surrounding areas. In 1871 swimming and diving lessons were added to the pier. The wreck of HMS Foudroyant in June 1897 In 1874, the pier-head was extended to allow Richard Knill Freeman to incorporate a pavilion, which opened in 1877. The interior decoration led it to be known as the \\"Indian Pavilion\\", and it was Blackpool's primary venue for indoor entertainment until the Winter Gardens opened in 1879. To differentiate itself from the new pier, North Pier focused on catering for the \\"better classes\\", charging for entry and including attractions such as an orchestra and band concerts, in contrast to the Central Pier (or the \\"People's pier\\"), which regularly had music playing and open-air dancing. The pier owners highlighted the difference, charging at least a shilling (worth approximately ¬£19.90 in 2012)Comparing average earnings between 1879 and 2012, 1 shilling is valued at approximately ¬£19.90 by MeasuringWorth.com for concerts and ensuring that advertisements for comedians focused on their lack of vulgarity. Sundays were given over to a church parade. On 8 October 1892, a storm-damaged vessel, Sirene, hit the southern side of the pier, causing four shops and part of the deck to collapse onto the beach below. Several columns were also dislodged, and the ship's bowsprit hit the pier entrance. All eleven crew members were rescued when they were hauled onto the pier. Damage to the pier was estimated to be ¬£5,000 and was promptly repaired. Nelson's former flagship, HMS Foudroyant, was moored alongside North Pier for an exhibition, but slipped anchor and was wrecked on the shore in a violent storm on 16 June 1897, damaging part of the jetty. The wreck of the ship broke up during December storms. The pier was closed for the winter during 1895‚Äì96 as it was unsafe; as a result, the pier was widened as electric lighting was added. =20th century= Blackpool North Pier entrance sign Remains of the tramway in 2012 An Arcade Pavilion was added in 1903 at the entrance to the pier and contained a wide range of amusements to suit all tastes. Further alterations were made to the pier in 1932-33 when the open air stand was replaced with a stage and sun lounge. In 1936, a pleasure steamer returning from Llandudno crashed into the pier. The collision left a gap, and stranded a number of people at the far end. The 1874 Indian Pavilion was severely damaged by fire in 1921. It was refurbished, but was then destroyed by a second fire in 1938. In 1939 it was replaced by a theatre, built in an Art Deco style. At around the same time, the bandstand was removed and replaced with a sun lounge. In the 1960s, the Merrie England bar and an amusement arcade were constructed at the end of the pier nearest to the shore. The 1939 theatre, which is still in use, narrowly escaped damage in 1985 when the early stages of a fire were noticed by performer Vince Hill. In the 1980s, a Victorian-styled entrance was built. In 1991 the pier gained the Carousel bar as an additional attraction, and a small tramway to ease access to the pier-head. By this point, the pier had ceased to have any nautical use, but the jetty section was adapted for use as a helicopter pad in the late 1980s. The Christmas Eve storm of 1997 destroyed the landing jetty, including the helipad. The North Pier is one of the few remaining examples of Birch's classic pier architecture and is a Grade II Listed building, the only Blackpool pier to hold that status. It was recognised as \\"Pier of the Year\\" in 2004 by the National Piers Society. Attractions Carousel on the North Pier North Pier's attractions include a Gypsy palm reader and an ice cream parlour, the North Pier Theatre, a Victorian tea room, and the Carousel and Merrie England bars. The arcade, built in the 1960s, has approximately eleven million coins pass through its machines each year. One of the earliest Sooty bear puppets used by Harry Corbett is on display on the pier. Corbett bought the original Sooty puppet on North Pier for his son, Matthew. When Corbett took the puppet on BBC's Talent Night programme, he marked the nose and ears with soot so that they would show up on the black and white television, giving the puppet its name. The Carousel bar on the pier-head has a Victorian wrought iron canopy, and its outdoor sun-lounge is classified as the largest beer garden in Blackpool. Next to the bar is a two tier carousel, the \\"Venetian Carousel\\", which is protected from sand and spray by a glass wall. After the fire in 1938, the pavilion was replaced with a 1,564-seat theatre which has since hosted a number of acts including; Frankie Vaughan, Frank Randle, Tessie O'Shea, Dave Morris, Bernard Delfont, Morecambe and Wise, Paul Daniels, Freddie Starr, Russ Abbot, Bruce Forsyth, Des O'Connor, Joe Longthorne, Lily Savage, Brian Conley and Hale and Pace. In 2002 a heritage room with photographs was opened up, the foyer entrance was refurbished and a disabled lift added. By 2005, there was no longer a live organist playing in the sun lounge although other live entertainment continues. In 2013, the live organist was brought back into the sun lounge. Ownership The pier was built and owned by the Blackpool Pier Company, created with three thousand ¬£5-shares in 1861 (worth approximately ¬£2,990 in 2012).Comparing average earnings between 1861 and 2012, ¬£5 is valued at approximately ¬£2,990.00 by MeasuringWorth.com The same firm operated the pier in 1953, and the company was incorporated in 1965. The Resorts Division of First Leisure, including the pier, was sold to Leisure Parks for ¬£74 million in 1998. In 2009, the pier was sold to the Six Piers group, which owns Blackpool's other two piers, and hoped to use it as a more tranquil alternative to them. The new owners opened the Victorian-themed tea room, and built an eight-seat shuttle running the length of the pier. In April 2011, the pier was sold to a Blackpool family firm, Sedgwick's, the owners of amusement arcades and the big wheel on Blackpool's Central Pier. Peter Sedgwick explained that he proposed to his wife on North Pier forty years ago, and promised to buy it for her one day. He said that he wants to restore the Victorian heritage of the pier and re-instate the pier's tram. An admission charge of fifty pence to access the board-walk section of the pier was abolished by the Sedgwicks. Liquidation A petition to wind up the Northern Victorian Pier Limited (the company used by the Sedgwick family to manage Blackpool North Pier) was presented on 17 September 2012 by Carlsberg UK Limited, a creditor of the company, and this was to be heard at Blackpool County Court on 15 November 2012. At the 11th hour, an agreement to pay the outstanding balance owed to Carlsberg was made and Peter Sedgwick's company escaped liquidation.

A footpath runs alongside the railway between Dawlish Warren and Dawlish, and another footpath forms a continuation to the sea front promenade at Teignmouth. Both these form part of the South West Coast Path. The South Devon Railway was built to the designs of Isambard Kingdom Brunel and takes a route from Exeter which follows the River Exe to Dawlish Warren, runs beneath the sea cliffs to Teignmouth, and then follows the River Teign to Newton Abbot. It follows tidal waters for about 13 miles, 4 of which are open sea. History Accident to the South Devon Railway at Dawlish, 1855 The section was opened by the South Devon Railway Company, running from Exeter St Davids railway station to Teignmouth railway station on 30 May 1846 and extended to Newton Abbot railway station on 31 December 1846. It was a broad gauge railway of 7 feet ¬º inch gauge and intended to be worked as an atmospheric railway, although atmospheric trains only ran from 13 September 1847 until 9 September 1848. The South Devon Railway was amalgamated into the Great Western Railway on 1 February 1876 and the gauge converted to the standard 4 feet 8¬Ω inches after 20 May 1892. A station was opened to serve Dawlish Warren in 1905, all the other stations on the sea wall having opened with the line in 1846. The Great Western Railway was nationalised into British Railways on 1 January 1948. The line is now owned by Network Rail and the stations and majority of trains operated by the modern-day Great Western Railway. On the night of 4 February 2014, amid high winds and extremely rough seas, part of the sea wall at Dawlish was breached, washing away around of the wall and the ballast under the railway immediately behind. The line was closed. Network Rail began repair work and the line reopened on 4 April 2014. The route =River Exe= A First Great Western InterCity 125 approaching Starcross The river comes into view at Turf. The square pond and disturbed ground between the railway and river are the remains of Turf engine house, one of the engine houses used for powering the atmospheric trains. After a short distance the river wall comes alongside the railway at Powderham. After passing the railway then runs between the river and the deer park of Powderham Castle, to Starcross railway station, situated in the middle of Starcross village. Opposite the pier for the ferry to Exmouth is the Starcross engine house. A little farther along the river, the railway crosses the mouth of Cockwood harbour. Near here was the 1,285 feet long Exe Bight Pier, in use from 1869 for about ten years. On the opposite side of the river trains can sometimes be seen near Lympstone Commando railway station. The river enters the sea at Exmouth while the railway runs behind the sand dunes of Dawlish Warren to reach Dawlish Warren railway station. =Sea wall= Class 221 passes walkers near Teignmouth On leaving Dawlish Warren the railway comes onto the sea wall proper with the walkway alongside, although it quickly enters the short and deep cutting at Langstone Rock. Emerging above the beach, views can be had towards Torbay. A footpath, which is mostly level with the track, follows the railway as far as the Kennaway Tunnel at Dawlish. Just before reaching Dawlish railway station is a footbridge at Coastguard's Cottage. This was used by the railway during its construction and then sold to the coastguard; their boat house is at the top of the beach next to the footbridge. The town of Dawlish can be seen off to the right from Colonnade Viaduct at the other end of the station. The line now enters its first tunnel, Kennaway, beneath Lea Mount, beyond which is Coryton beach, the farthest point accessible by the sea wall footpath from Dawlish. The Coryton tunnel leads to the next beach, Shell Cove, accessible by foot only via the shore at very low tide or by a private path from the clifftop. The railway then passes through Phillot Tunnel and Clerk's Tunnel, emerging onto a section of sea wall at Breeches Rock before diving into Parson's Tunnel beneath Hole Head. The last two tunnels are named after the Parson and Clerk Rocks, a natural arch in the sea off Hole Head. Beyond Parson's Tunnel is a short viaduct across Smugglers Lane and then the footpath resumes for the final stretch past Sprey Point to the cutting at Teignmouth Eastcliff. On the landward side of the railway near Sprey Point can be seen the remains of a lime kiln used during the construction of the line. =River Teign= After passing through Teignmouth railway station, the line continues through a cutting to emerge behind the busy Teignmouth Harbour, after which the railway resumes its course alongside the water, the River Teign. The cuttings on both sides of the station used to be tunnels, but they were opened out between 1879 and 1884. After going under the Shaldon Bridge and passing a boat yard on the site of Teignmouth gas works, the line follows the river past the small promontories at Flow Point, Red Rock, and Summer House, before passing through two small cuttings and crossing Hackney Marshes near the race course to reach Newton Abbot railway station. Across the river opposite Summer House can be seen the waterside inn at Coombe Cellars. Operation Class 43 passes waves breaking over the line at Dawlish During significant high tide levels, trains belonging to the and fleets are restricted from operating along this route due to their vulnerability to the sea spray, unlike the Pacer, Sprinter and Class 43 fleets. A has been tested along the line with no significant problems occurring to the train, however the majority of trains that will replace the Class 43 HST will be the , a longer range version of the Class 800s. Maintenance and the future Running parallel to the open sea at the base of cliffs for four miles, the sea wall has always been prone to damage during rough weather. In December 1852 a large landslip from the cliffs east of Teignmouth caused the railway to close for four days, and in 1855 and 1859 the sea broke through the line at Teignmouth. There have been many more closures since, caused by landslips from the cliffs and by breaches by the sea, especially in winter. In 1929, the wall between Dawlish and Dawlish Warren was damaged by a storm on Christmas Eve, and there was partial subsidence of the down line. Repairing the breach in the sea wall at Dawlish, February 2014 In 1936 the GWR surveyed an inland deviation termed the Dawlish Avoiding Line, initially in 1936 proposed progressing inland between Exminster and Bishopsteignton, and a 1937 shorter route ending west of Dawlish. After gaining parliamentary approval for the required bill, construction started in Spring 1939, but the advent of World War II brought the project to an end. The GWR was nationalised into British Railways on 1 January 1948, and the land sold. The powers of the associated Act of Parliament only lapsed in 1999. In 2010 it was stated in Parliament that \\"in recent years\\" around ¬£9 million had been invested on keeping the sea wall safe and the cliff faces stable, and that the ongoing maintenance of the sea walls and the adjoining estuaries was costing Network Rail around ¬£500,000 annually. The Under-Secretary of State for Transport reiterated the importance of the line to the economy of South Devon and Cornwall, and confirmed that even if there were to be plans for the building of an alternative inland route in the future, \\"in our view, it would not be a substitute in any shape or form for the main line along the coast\\". This is despite the acknowledgement of an inevitable increase in maintenance costs due to rising sea levels. In 2018 Network Rail put forward a proposal to extend the sea wall farther into the English Channel at Teignmouth, with the wall's new edge passing through Sprey Point. The proposal would involve re- aligning the railway, moving the line further from the cliff and creating a space between them to prevent the railway's being affected by cliff subsidence or collapse. Other elements of the proposal include the improvement of the sea wall between Kennaway Tunnel and Dawlish and the installation of an avalanche shelter-style structure at Horse Cove. Government funding of ¬£80 million to raise the sea wall south of Dawlish station by was approved in February 2019.

Created by William J. Bell, the character appeared as a child for her first five-year period. In 2002, Christel Khalil began portraying Lily as a teenager after the character rapidly aged. In 2005, Khalil left the series, resulting in the character's recasting with Davetta Sherwood; however, Sherwood's portrayal was brief when Khalil was asked to return the following year. Khalil began playing the character as a \\"rebellious, yet naive teenager\\", later becoming one of the soap opera's heroines. Winters is the daughter of supermodel-turned-executive Drucilla Winters (Victoria Rowell) born in the midst of a questioned paternity storyline, with Neil Winters (Kristoff St. John) believing he was her father. Eleven years later, the storyline was readdressed with the revelation that Malcolm Winters (Shemar Moore) is her biological father. Lily later began a relationship with Daniel Romalotti (Michael Graziadei), a romance inspired by Romeo and Juliet. The couple were popular with viewers, who were saddened at their separation (because of Daniel's addiction to pornography). Lily was later paired with leading character Cane Ashby (Daniel Goddard), a romance that has attracted significant fan attention. In 2009, the pair were married just before Lily was diagnosed with ovarian cancer, a storyline praised by viewers and critics. Lily and Cane had two children: Charlie and Mattie Ashby, born in 2010. The following year the couple divorced (after Cane faked his death and kept secrets from Lily), but reunited and were remarried in 2012. Khalil has received critical acclaim for her portrayal, which has garnered her an NAACP Image and Daytime Emmy Award. Critics have described her as having evolved from a \\"teen star\\" into a \\"leading lady\\". Casting Winters was first portrayed as a child by Vanessa Carson in 1996, followed by Brooke Marie Bridges from 1998 to 2000. In August 2002 Khalil was cast in the role as a teenager at age 14. Lily was the first soap-opera role for which she auditioned. After screen tests with co-star Kristoff St. John and casting director Marnie Saitta, Khalil was given the part. In 2005 (after portraying the character for three years) Khalil left the series, citing stress as the reason for her departure. The producers tried unsuccessfully to convince Khalil to stay, and recast her role with Sherwood. Sherwood said that while the character Lily was the same, she and Khalil were not the same actress so it would be \\"a little different\\". Although she replaced a popular actress, Sherwood said she felt no anxiety over the recasting because Khalil chose to leave the part. After leaving the series, Khalil and the producers began discussing her possible return. In 2006 she agreed to come back, and Sherwood was released from her contract. Former executive producer and head writer Lynn Marie Latham said she was happy with the casting change; she was impressed by Khalil's work, saying that she is a \\"brilliant actress\\". Latham noted that Sherwood did a \\"fine job\\" as the character, but \\"shows generally prefer to have original players back when they can get them\\". On her MySpace blog, Sherwood said she felt negativity from others on the set of the soap opera before her replacement; she was not told the reason for her firing, which she thought neither right nor fair. Khalil stated in 2007 that her return was a difficult decision to make, but was \\"the best decision ever\\". On August 21, 2012, The Young and the Restless put out a casting call for the role of \\"Sally Tate\\", and the character description lead to speculation that it was a recast for Lily Winters and Khalil was exiting the soap. On August 22, Khalil's official website confirmed that she was leaving the show due to a contract dispute and her contract was set to expire in late-September.. On August 23, 2012, Khalil gave an interview to MSN Entertainment in which she expressed her desire to remain on the show. Saying that she hoped she and the show could eventually come to a mutual agreement. Michaelfairmansoaps.com. Retrieved January 18, 2016 Upon learning of her impending exit, fans of Khalil began a letter write-in, snail mail, e-mail and phone call campaign in support of her remaining on the show. August 28, 2012. Retrieved January 5, 2016. Fan outcry led producers to rethink recasting the role with newly appointed executive producer Jill Farren Phelps later saying that negotiations with Khalil had resumed and she \\"didn't yet know\\" how that would work out. On September 6, 2012, a plane carrying a banner stating \\"Y&R; Fans Want Christel Khalil as Lily Ashby\\" was flown over CBS Television City in support of Khalil. Retrieved January 5, 2016. Fans did a similar campaign in spring 2011 when Khalil's co- star Daniel Goddard was let go from the soap.Youtube.com Retrieved March 31, 2016. In late September, newly appointed head writer Josh Griffith confirmed in an interview with TV Guide that contract negotiations had been resolved and Khalil would remain in the role. On August 27, 2018, Khalil announced her decision to drop to recurring status. As of August 2020, Khalil was once again listed as a series regular. Development =Characterization= In 2002, when Lily was rapidly aged to a teenager, the character was designed as an \\"angst-ridden\\" heroine who struggled with \\"trauma\\"; she was also described as strong, rebellious, and sassy. Khalil said that Lily \\"doesn't take anybody's crap\\" and \\"she's her own person\\". Sherwood was said to have brought a \\"fire\\" to the role, and was told to use it only when necessary. She described Lily as \\"a lot like her mother\\": \\"It makes sense. She spent a lot of time with her mother growing up and she's seen how her mother reacts to certain situations when there is a problem or a dilemma.\\" When Khalil returned to the role she felt that Lily had changed \\"a great deal\\" since she last played her; she was more immature and although it was more fun, it was \\"definitely different\\". In 2009, Soap Opera Digest said that Khalil and Lily had evolved from a \\"teen star\\" into a \\"leading lady\\". Khalil described her happiness with her character's evolution, with more adult storylines and having to \\"deal with things like losing a baby or breaking off her engagement [to Cane]\\". During her marital problems with Cane, Khalil described Lily as a \\"doormat\\" and \\"hopeless romantic\\", saying that her \\"daddy issues\\" were part of that. =Relationships= Greg Rikaart portrays Kevin, formerly an internet predator who targets Lily and infects her with chlamydia. One of Lily's first storylines centered around her manipulation by internet predator Kevin Fisher (Greg Rikaart), who gives her the sexually-transmitted disease chlamydia. Khalil taped public service announcements related to the story, and considered the plot one of her favorites: \\"How many soaps have really covered that? The meeting on the Internet, getting an STD, it was really great stuff.\\" Lily was next involved in a Romeo and Juliet-inspired romance (attracting a significant fan following) with Daniel Romalotti (Michael Graziadei), Kevin's friend. Lily was said to have brought out a new side to Daniel's character, \\"taming\\" him. When Khalil left the show, former head writer John F. Smith promised the character's recast would \\"bring an entirely new level\\" to Lily and Daniel's romance. They fell in love and were married; the pair's popularity continued with Sherwood in the role. Sherwood gave Lily more feistiness, although the character was never written as timid. Sherwood's interpretation drew comparisons to Lily's mother, Drucilla; that \\"fire\\" was brought into Daniel and Lily's relationship. Sherwood said that \\"Dru can be a little dramatic\\", and when Lily faces an issue with Daniel \\"she's not going to remain calm, she's going to do what she saw her mother do\\". The actress praised the pair's storyline for not focusing on the different races of the characters. Khalil was surprised by the advancement of Lily and Daniel's storyline when she returned, particularly the characters' marriage. The plot ended with a social issue: Daniel's addiction to pornography. Graziadei said, \\"My initial conflict was that Daniel has had so many problems with his wife that I couldn't figure out why he'd be doing this\\", and was concerned that Daniel might be seen as \\"lecherous and creepy\\". The pair tried to work through Daniel's addiction, but it ended their marriage. Daniel Goddard portrays Cane, Lily's love interest and later husband. Their pairing has garnered significant fan attention. Lily was later written into a romance with Cane Ashby (Daniel Goddard) intertwined with a modeling career. The couple was designed as star-crossed true loves, and the relationship was said to add further growth to Lily's character. Khalil said that Lily had been in \\"kind of an immature relationship\\" and she thought being with a \\"real man\\" would make Lily grow up and \\"start thinking about her life and situation in a different way\\" and \\"would change Lily for the better\\". Goddard compared the romance to Lady Chatterley's Lover, as both characters grew and learned from the relationship. Storylines for the lovers included the characters' age gap, a miscarriage and a love rectangle with Chloe Mitchell (Elizabeth Hendrickson) and Billy Abbott (Billy Miller). In the love-rectangle story, Chloe deceives Cane into thinking they conceived a child. Goddard said he liked the storyline because of its originality. Love triangles and questioned paternity occur frequently in soap operas, but he felt that Maria Arena Bell made the plots fresh. Khalil said that she \\"loved\\" the storyline and the actors in it; she thought it \\"was a possibility\\" for Lily and Cane to have a happy ending, and Lily \\"can see the hope, and they can adapt and love each other in a more mature and honest way\\". In 2009, the pair were married. For their wedding, Lily wore the dress her mother Drucilla (Victoria Rowell) wore at her 1995 wedding to Neil. Rowell's dress was altered, at Khalil's request; she said it was an \\"old-fashioned, a typical '90s-style gown\\", and she \\"didn't really like it\\". Khalil spoke with Bell and the head of the wardrobe department about updating the dress. Bell agreed; there were \\"little details\\" about the original dress she wanted to keep, and it became \\"a really beautiful dress\\". In 2010, Global BC said Lily was the love of Cane's life. The following year, she divorced him after his continued lies about his faked death. However, she eventually discovered that Cane was trying to protect her and they remarried. Khalil said that she never lost faith in the pair reuniting, since their romance is \\"so popular\\": \\"No matter what happens, they'll always get through it.\\" Goddard noted that their relationship \\"had come full circle\\" and \\"was being done well\\". About Cane and Lily's second wedding, Goddard said that Cane and Lily have \\"certainly had a lot of ups and downs\\" but he thought their fans \\"stayed true and they have expressed their desire for what they want to see\\". He thought a wedding of \\"this caliber\\" would make their fans \\"very, very happy and that is what this is about\\". =Paternity and cancer= Shemar Moore portrayed Lily's biological father, Malcolm Winters. Lily was born into a paternity storyline, with brothers Neil or Malcolm Winters her father. Her mother, Drucilla, had been dating Neil but, was raped by Malcolm (who knew full well that she thought he was Neil while she was groggy from medication). The storyline continued unresolved for several years, with Neil believing he was Lily's father. In 2006, former co-head writer Jack Smith decided to resolve Lily's paternity by revealing that Malcolm was her father. About the storyline, Smith said: In 2009, former head writer Maria Arena Bell developed a storyline about ovarian cancer for Lily. Bell said that the way Lily's struggle was playing out \\"is very much how it would play out in real life\\": \\"There's days where you feel exhausted and you feel powerless...It helps that on our writing team, we have one writer who's currently suffering from breast cancer, who put a lot of her own heart and soul into this story. I myself am a survivor [of] two different cancers.\\" Khalil filmed a public-service announcement for CBS Cares about ovarian cancer and those affected by the disease. Lily shaves her head, requiring Khalil to wear hats, scarves, a bald cap and wigs. The wigs were shorter than the actress' real hair because the writers wanted to make sure the audience knew they were wigs. In 2010 Lily went into remission, and has since been cancer-free. Storylines In 2002, Lily is a rebellious teenager. After living in Paris, her mother Drucilla (Victoria Rowell) moves her back to the United States after she sprayed graffiti in the city. Drucilla hopes that Lily's father, Neil (Kristoff St. John), will reason with her; however, they end up helping him deal with his alcoholism. Lily's parents reunite and plan to remarry‚Äîto her dismay, since she wanted her mother to be with Wesley Carter (Ben Watkins). Lily comes to terms with their relationship, becoming friends with Colleen Carlton (Lyndsy Fonseca). In 2004, Lily is victimized by Internet predator Kevin Fisher (Greg Rikaart), who rapes her and gives her a sexually- transmitted disease. She forgives him after he saves her from another predator who is trying to rape her, but the situation was staged by Daniel Romalotti (Michael Grazaidei) to make Kevin look like a hero. Lily and Daniel begin dating, to their parents‚Äô dismay. In 2006, they marry, and soon afterwards Lily discovers her biological father is her uncle Malcolm (Shemar Moore); this strains her relationship with her mother. They reconcile before Drucilla is presumed dead after falling off a cliff during an argument with Daniel's mother, Phyllis Summers (Michelle Stafford) and Sharon Abbott (Sharon Case). Lily discovers that Daniel has been hiding a pornography addiction which, despite counseling, ends their marriage. Lily is then attracted to Cane Ashby (Daniel Goddard), but they hesitate to begin a relationship because of their age difference. They eventually begin dating, despite disapproval from Neil. Chloe Mitchell (Elizabeth Hendrickson) deceives Cane into believing he fathered her child; however, the child's biological father is Billy Abbott (Billy Miller). Cane's relationship with Lily is interrupted, but they become engaged when the truth about the child's paternity is revealed, and marry in February 2009. They briefly separate when Cane's true identity is revealed, but are reunited when Lily is diagnosed with ovarian cancer (and mourns the death of her best friend, Colleen). During her hysterectomy, two of her eggs are preserved; Cane and Lily want to have children, using Mackenzie Browning (Clementine Ford) as their surrogate mother. She gives birth to twins, Charlie and Mattie Ashby, in June 2010. Soon afterwards, Lily goes into remission; an Australian (Blake Joseph) arrives in Genoa City and blackmails Cane, followed by his father Colin Atkinson (Tristan Rogers) in December 2010. Colin is later engaged to Jill Abbott (Jess Walton), and Cane is shot to death by Blake as he tries to stop their wedding. After Cane's death, Lily sees hallucinations of him in the afterlife, leading her family to suggest therapy. After her ‚Äúhallucination‚Äù leaves footprints in the snow, Lily realizes that Cane is alive, having faked his death; his twin brother, Caleb, was the one who died. Lily feels betrayed and decides to divorce Cane, but later realizes that the story surrounding his faked death was to protect her. They decide to remarry in February 2012 and work at Jabot Cosmetics, where Lily develops an attraction to Tyler Michaelson (Redaric Williams) which makes Cane jealous. Lily and Tyler share a kiss, but she turns him down and returns to Cane. Afterward, Cane hires an assistant at Chancellor Industries, Hilary Curtis (Mishael Morgan), whom Jill and then Lily become suspicious of. Meanwhile, an unknown blogger is targeting the Winters family online, with photos of Hilary kissing Cane as well as the two of them in a hotel room. After a private investigation, the Winters figure out Hilary is the blogger (because she blames Neil for her mother's death years prior) just as Hilary attempts to drug Cane. She is fired from Chancellor Industries and shunned by the family. In 2014, after repairing their marriage, Cane and Lily agree to become the new managers of the Genoa City Athletic Club after her brother Devon Hamilton (Bryton James) buys it. In early 2015, on the heels of finding out Cane helped Hilary and Devon conceal their affair from her father, trust issues once again arise in Lily and Cane's marriage. Which are further exacerbated by Cane's new found closeness to his step aunt, Lauren Fenmore (Tracey Bregman). Lily expresses her discomfort at their closeness, which both dismiss, even though they share a kiss, which Lily later finds out about. The marriage continues to deteriorate to the point where Lily believes the two are having an affair and she, in an act of revenge, beds Joe Clark (Scott Elrod), a business associate and friend of Cane's. She confesses to Cane, who promptly dumps her. The two reconcile a few months later with, unbeknownst to them, Joe having grown obsessed with Lily. In fall 2015, Joe frames Cane for being involved in Hilary's disappearance, leaving Lily unsure of what to believe, which again drives a wedge between the two and Cane moves out of their home. Lily has sex with Joe again before realizing that he framed Cane. Lily helps Cane clear his name and is left devastated when Cane rejects her attempt to reconcile. The two eventually reconcile in 2016. In 2017, Lily becomes the face of Brash & Sassy and quits the Athletic Club. While on a business trip to Tokyo, Cane gets drunk and has sex with their new co-worker, Juliet Helton (Laur Allen). Cane keeps the tryst a secret from Lily until months later Juliet reveals that she's pregnant. After a DNA test confirms Cane is the father, Lily initially chooses to stay with Cane due to their children and her own past infidelity. However, after Cane uses money set aside for the twins private school tuition to pay off a blackmailer, Lily is heartbroken by Cane's continued deception and kicks him out. During their separation Lily continues to get closer to her old friend and current Brash & Sassy photographer, Jordan Wilde (Darnell Kirkwood). The two share a kiss but Lily needs time to figure out what she wants. She later files for divorce from Cane but after Juliet dies during childbirth, she postpones the divorce for Cane's sake. Lily suggests Cane name his newborn son after his deceased younger sister, Samantha. In early 2018, Cane pursues Lily to Paris and the two reconcile. In the summer of 2018, Lily and a pregnant Hilary are involved in a car accident that ends Hilary's life. Lily, racked with guilt and being forced to by Devon, confesses to running the red light that caused the accident and is sentenced to 1 year in prison. In April 2019, Lily is released early and files for divorce from Cane, stating she wants a fresh start. Neil passes away unexpectedly on the day of her release, leaving her devastated. Cane pleads with Lily to stay with him in Genoa City but she leaves the day after her father's funeral to start a new life in Lakewood, Wisconsin as a teacher to the inmates with whom she was once imprisoned. In March 2020, Lily returned to Genoa City to run the new Chancellor Communications division along side Billy Abbott. Reception Khalil as Winters has grown in popularity among viewers, who voted her onto \\"Top Actress\\" lists in publications such as Soap Opera Digest, Soaps In Depth and Soap Opera Update. Critics have also praised Khalil for her portrayal; Soap Opera Digest named her performer of the week during Lily's internet- predator storyline, citing the subtlety of her performance. Mark McGarry of Soap Opera Weekly named the actress outstanding performer of the week on February 28, 2005, praising Khalil's \\"remarkable range\\". CBS Soaps In Depth said Sherwood \\"got off to a slow start\\", but praised her work during the revelation that Lily's husband Daniel was responsible for her attempted rape by Alex. Khalil's return in 2006 was greeted positively by viewers. Lily's cancer storyline was praised by critics and viewers. Janet Di Lauro of Soap Opera Weekly praised the storyline for highlighting Neil and Lily's relationship, saying that they \\"are one of the most effective and heartfelt father-daughter combos in daytime. Kristoff St. John and Christel Khalil share a chemistry that lets the viewers feel Neil's pain when Lily is hurting, and relate to his anger when she has been wronged.\\" Di Lauro criticized the writers for placing a young character such as Lily into so many traumatic stories, including the cancer and hysterectomy. Soap Opera Digest made the cancer story its editor's choice; Di Lauro praised Khalil for her performance during the death of Lily's best friend Colleen Carlton (Tammin Sursok), calling Lily and Colleen's final scenes \\"a bona-fide tearjerker\\" and \\"one of the most touching scenes to air\\" during Colleen's death: \\"Lily could have easily fallen apart and chastised Colleen for leaving her during her house of need. Instead, she held her head high and gave Colleen a proper sendoff... It was as if Lily was gathering strength from Colleen, even as Colleen let go.\\" Lily's relationships with Daniel and Cane were listed among Soaps In Depth's 100 Greatest Soap Opera Couples. The Daniel-and-Lily storyline attracted viewer support for both Khalil and Sherwood, and the magazine called the scene when Daniel and Lily make love after his acquittal for the death of Cassie Newman (Camryn Grimes) one of the top three moments of 2005. Roscoe Born, who played Tom Fisher, praised their storyline: \\"It really brought the two families into so much conflict, and I thought they were very believable as young lovers. They were very passionate, and at the same time, really evoked that feeling of first love.\\" When Lily and Daniel's marriage ended, fans of the couple were saddened. Lily's romance with Cane first received a mixed response; viewers were divided on the couple because of the age difference between the characters. Khalil said that she was sure there were going to be people \\"who will always feel\\" that Cane is too old for Lily, but there are others \\"who just don't care about the age difference\\": \\"You can't please everyone. You just have to do your best with the storyline and hope that people will like it.\\" Soap Opera Digest gave the couple a thumbs-up: \\"On paper, a Cane-and-Lily pairing shouldn't work. They've both just left marriages (to Amber and Daniel, though Cane's wasn't legal), their exes are living together, and Cane is older than Lily. Yet, the adorable Aussie and the cute coed make a charming match.\\" The magazine praised the couple because they united the core families, the Winters and the Chancellors. Soap Opera Weekly considered their Valentine's Day surprise in 2008 \\"a hit\\". Michael Fairman of On-Air On-Soaps called Cane and Lily \\"one of daytime's most popular couples\\", and their story with Billy and Chloe \\"one of soaps all-time best quadrangle story arcs\\". Mallory Harlen of Soap Opera Digest praised the quadrangle for adding another layer to Lily: \\"The always prim, always perfect Lily reminded me way too much of Christine Blair...in a bad way. But being a woman scorned really worked for her; her newfound feistiness is completely fitting for Drucilla's daughter.\\" Nelson Branco of TV Guide Canada criticized the couple; he thought they had no chemistry and wanted Cane \\"in the big leagues and not with little girls\\", but conceded that they had \\"a very vocal, and loyal fanbase\\". Soap Opera Update named Cane and Lily the best couple on The Young and the Restless in 2008, and viewers voted them into top-couple polls in soap-opera magazines. Khalil received two nominations for Outstanding Younger Actress at the 2004 and 2006 Daytime Emmy Awards, and two Young Artist Award nominations for Leading Young Actress in 2003 and 2004.

The Mobile Mini-Circus for Children was established as a nonprofit organization established in 2002 to work with orphaned and traumatized children. After decades of war, the Mobile Mini-Circus for Children aims to unlock the creativity and spirit of fun in Afghan children by bringing tools for storytelling, performance, and public expression to children across Afghanistan. Circus members act as teachers for the children, holding three days of workshops on circus skills such as puppetry, walking on stilts, and juggling. With help from circus trainers and a group of traveling children- artists, mostly orphans, Afghan children create a show for the community over the first two days and then perform it on the third day.

All species of this class are, like all Proteobacteria, Gram-negative. The Epsilonproteobacteria consist of few known genera, mainly the curved to spirilloid Wolinella spp., Helicobacter spp., and Campylobacter spp. Most of the known species inhabit the digestive tracts of animals and serve as symbionts (Wolinella spp. in cattle) or pathogens (Helicobacter spp. in the stomach, Campylobacter spp. in the duodenum). Many Epsilonproteobacteria are motile with flagella. Numerous environmental sequences and isolates of Epsilonproteobacteria have also been recovered from hydrothermal vents and cold seep habitats. Examples of isolates include Sulfurimonas autotrophica, Sulfurimonas paralvinellae, Sulfurovum lithotrophicum and Nautilia profundicola. A member of the class Epsilonproteobacteria occurs as an endosymbiont in the large gills of the deepwater sea snail Alviniconcha hessleri. The Epsilonproteobacteria found at deep-sea hydrothermal vents characteristically exhibit chemolithotrophy, meeting their energy needs by oxidizing reduced sulfur, formate, or hydrogen coupled to the reduction of nitrate or oxygen. Autotrophic Epsilonproteobacteria use the reverse Krebs cycle to fix carbon dioxide into biomass, a pathway originally thought to be of little environmental significance. The oxygen sensitivity of this pathway is consistent with their microaerophilic or anaerobic niche in these environments, and their likely evolution in the Mesoproterozoic oceans, which are thought to have been sulfidic with low levels of oxygen available from cyanobacterial photosynthesis.
