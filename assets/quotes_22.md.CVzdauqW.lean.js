Canadian Forces Base Gander shares the airfield but is a separate entity from the airport. The airport is sometimes referred to as the \\"Crossroads of the World\\". History Early years and prominence Construction of the airport began in 1936 and it was opened in 1938, with its first landing on January 11 of that year, by Captain Douglas Fraser flying a Fox Moth of Imperial Airways. Within a few years it had four runways and was the largest airport in the world. Its official name until 1949 was Newfoundland Airport. In 1940, the operation of the Newfoundland Airport was assigned by the Dominion of Newfoundland to the Royal Canadian Air Force (RCAF) and it was renamed RCAF Station Gander in 1941. The airfield was heavily used by RAF Ferry Command and Air Transport Command for transporting newly built aircraft across the Atlantic Ocean to the European Theatre, as well as for staging operational anti-submarine patrols dedicated to hunting U-boats in the northwest Atlantic. Thousands of aircraft flown by the United States Army Air Corps through the changeover to the United States Army Air Forces, and the RCAF destined for the European Theatre, travelled through Gander. Lockheed Hudson Mark IIIs are prepared for their trans-Atlantic ferry flights at Gander in 1942 The Royal Canadian Navy (RCN) also established Naval Radio Station Gander at the airfield, using the station as a listening post to detect the transmissions and location of enemy submarines and warships. Following the war, the RCAF handed operation of the airfield back to the dominion government in March 1946, although the RCN's radio station remained and the military role for the entire facility was upgraded through the Cold War. The Canadian federal government changed the name to Gander Airport after Newfoundland joined Canada in 1949. It opened the current passenger terminal in 1959. Transatlantic refueling stop On 16 September 1945 the first transatlantic proving flight, a Pan Am DC-4, departed Gander for Shannon in western Ireland. On 24 October 1945, the first scheduled commercial flight, an American Overseas Airlines DC-4, passed through Gander. Following Newfoundland's entry into Confederation, the government renamed the airport Gander International Airport and it came under the administration of Canada's federal Department of Transport. Numerous improvements were made to the runways and terminals. Gander is near the great circle route between North America and Europe. Starting in the 1940s it was a refueling stop for transatlantic flights and continued in this role through the early 1960s and in some cases into the 1990s. Carriers at Gander during this era included: * Aeroflot operated Ilyushin Il-86 widebody flights during the 1980s and early 1990s between Moscow and such long-range destinations as New York and Havana (HAV). Due to the IL-86's limited range of approximately , the flights would make refueling stops at both Shannon and Gander en route to the final destination. , Stoff, Joshua, \\"John F. Kennedy International Airport,\\" p.100 The Boeing 747-200s of the same era had typical ranges from and were much more sought after by international airlines.Jenkins 2000, p.43 The IL-86 was used almost exclusively by Aeroflot and successor post-Soviet airlines. , John Pike, \\"Il-86 Camber,\\" Retrieved July 28, 2017 * Air France ran several services through Gander connecting Paris and Shannon to Montreal, Boston, and New York in the 1950s. * American Overseas Airlines used Gander as a stop for Lockheed Constellation flights between New York and London from 1947. * British Overseas Airways Corporation operated Constellations on London- Shannon-Gander-New York, London-Glasgow-Gander-New York, and London-Glasgow- Gander-Montreal routings from 1947. By 1960, the Gander stop was only used as an alternative to a Glasgow or Shannon stop for Bristol Britannia service to Montreal and Toronto. * Interflug flights between East Germany and Cuba would stop to refuel in Gander until the airline began using Airbus A310s in 1989. * KLM used Gander as a stop on Amsterdam-Glasgow-Gander-New York service from 1946. * Pan American World Airways used Gander as a stop for transatlantic Douglas DC-4 service between New York-Idlewild and Shannon (continuing to London and Lisbon) starting in 1946. Gander remained in use in 1960 as a stop for Douglas DC-7 services between New York and Scandinavia, although other transatlantic flights bypassed Gander by that point. * Sabena operated Brussels-Shannon-Gander-New York service from 1949 using Douglas DC-6s. * Scandinavian Airlines operated Stockholm-Oslo/Copenhagen-Prestwick-Gander-New York service from 1946. * Trans-Canada Air Lines used Gander as a stop for transatlantic service to London from 1946 and also operated local service from Gander to St. John's and Sydney. * Trans World Airlines operated Boston- Gander-Shannon and Boston-Gander-Azores-Lisbon services from 1947 using Constellations, with onward service to destinations in Europe, the Middle East, and India. Runway 04/22 was extended from in 1971.Aviation Daily May 21, 1971 p117, November 8, 1971 p47 With the advent of jets with longer range in the 1960s, most flights no longer needed to refuel. Gander has decreased in importance, but it remains the home of Gander Control, one of the two air traffic control centres (the other being Shanwick Oceanic Control in western Ireland) which direct the high-level airways of the North Atlantic. Most aircraft travelling to and from Europe or North America must talk to at least one of these air traffic controls. Some commercial transatlantic flights still use Gander as a refuelling stop; most notably, some American legacy carriers (United Airlines and Delta Air Lines in particular) who use the Boeing 757 to connect smaller European cities with their major US hubs. The 757 is particularly affected in this respect, as it was not an aircraft intended or designed for transatlantic flights. This practice has been controversial, since strong headwinds over the Atlantic Ocean during the winter months can result in the flights being declared \\"minimum fuel\\", forcing a refuelling stop at Gander in order to safely complete their journey. During the Cold War, Gander was notable for the number of persons from the former Warsaw Pact nations who defected there (including Soviet chess player and pianist Igor Vasilyevich Ivanov, Cuban Olympic swimmer Rafael Polinario, and the Vietnamese woman famously photographed as a naked girl fleeing a napalmed village, Phan Thi Kim Phuc). It was one of the few refueling points where airplanes could stop en route from Eastern Europe or the Soviet Union to Cuba. On December 12, 1985, Gander was the site of the Arrow Air Flight 1285 disaster, in which a McDonnell Douglas DC-8 with 256 on board crashed during takeoff, probably due to atmospheric icing; there were no survivors. The crash was, and remains, , the deadliest airplane accident on Canadian soil. Operation Yellow Ribbon On September 11, 2001, with United States airspace closed because of the terrorist attacks, Gander International played host to 38 airliners, totaling 6,122 passengers and 473 crew, as part of Operation Yellow Ribbon. Gander International received more flights than any other Canadian airport involved in the operation apart from Halifax. The 6,595 passengers and crew accounted for the third highest total of passengers that landed at a Canadian airport involved in the operation, behind Vancouver and Halifax. A major reason that Gander received so much traffic was its ability to handle large aircraft and because Transport Canada and Nav Canada instructed pilots coming from Europe to avoid major airports in Central Canada, such as Toronto-Pearson and Montr√©al-Dorval. The reception these travellers received in the central Newfoundland communities near the airport has been one of the most widely reported happy stories surrounding that day, and was dramatized in the musical Come from Away. To honour the people of Gander and Halifax for their support during the operation, Lufthansa named a new Airbus A340-300 \\"Gander/Halifax\\" on May 16, 2002. That airplane is listed with the registration D-AIFC,D-AIFC at airliners.net and was the first aircraft of that fleet with a city name from outside of Germany. The airport was the site for Canada's memorial service to mark the first anniversary of the attack, over which Prime Minister Jean Chr√©tien, Transport Minister David Collenette, US Ambassador to Canada Paul Cellucci, and provincial and local officials presided. 2,500 of the 6,600 people that were diverted there the year before also attended the ceremony. Future growth Officials at Gander International Airport have stated that the future for the airport is grim unless the federal government provides funding to cover costs. Over 50% of all aircraft operating from the air field are military, and do not pay landing fees. However, domestic passenger traffic increased by over seven percent in 2006, while weekly cargo flights from Iceland show some promise of expansion. The terminal building--built in the 1950s and noted for its modernist design and heritage architecture--still includes many of its original furnishings and fixtures. In April 2014, Gander Airport Authority made plans to abandon the existing terminal building due to high operating costs and replace it with a new terminal a quarter of the size. In 2017, the airport announced the existing terminal would instead be renovated and downsized, at a cost of $26.4 million. Facilities Runway at Gander International Airport Runways Gander has two active runways: runway 13/31 which is , and runway 03/21 (changed from 04/22 in August 2004) which measures and undergone a $10 million comprehensive rehabilitation project completed in September 2012. The airport's runway 03/21 was designated as an emergency landing runway for NASA's Space Shuttle orbiter. The airport is also an important emergency landing runway for large aircraft in transatlantic operation in the ETOPS system, which requires aircraft to always have less than a certain distance from a suitable landing site. For many two- engine aircraft this is two or three hours with malfunction in one engine. Fire services Gander Airport Safety and Airside Operations is responsible for fire and rescue operations using three vehicles at their station within the airport. It also has a mutual aid agreement with the Town of Gander Fire Department to provide additional fire fighting services. .

Newfoundland. *On 21 February 1941, three people were killed when a Lockheed L-14 Super Electra/Hudson departing from Gander crashed near Musgrave Harbour after both of the plane's engines failed. The fatalities include Sir Frederick Grant Banting who died of wounds and exposure. The navigator and co-pilot died instantly, but Banting and the pilot, Captain Joseph Mackey, survived the initial impact. According to Mackey, the sole survivor, Banting died from his injuries the next day. *On 18 September 1946, 27 people lost their lives when a SABENA Douglas DC-4 (OO-CBG) crashed 35 km short of Gander Airport, where the aircraft planned to land for a refueling stop on the flight from Brussels to New York. At the time of the accident (07:42 UTC), there was dense fog near the airport, and the pilot executed a flawed approach at too low an altitude. There were 17 survivors (16 passengers and one crew). *On 5 September 1967 an Ilyushin Il-18 (registration OK-WAI) of Ceskoslovenske Aerolinie (ƒåSA) Flight 523 crashed on climbout heading east on runway 13 while on a Prague-Shannon-Gander-Havana passenger service, killing 37 of 69 on board; the cause was never determined. *On 12 December 1985 Arrow Air Flight 1285 crashed on take-off from the then runway 22. The disaster claimed the lives of 8 crew and 248 soldiers of the United States Army's 101st Airborne Division who were returning home for Christmas from a peacekeeping deployment in the Middle East. The impact on the south side of the Trans- Canada Highway on the shore of Gander Lake left a charred clearing in the forest where a memorial now stands to those who lost their lives in Canada's most deadly air crash. *On 31 March 2007, an Antonov An-124 Ruslan operated by Volga-Dnepr Airlines inbound from Greer, South Carolina, landed on runway 03/21 but failed to stop and ran off the runway.

It drains a large region of the Wrangell Mountains and Chugach Mountains into the Gulf of Alaska. It is known for its extensive delta ecosystem, as well as for its prolific runs of wild salmon, which are among the most highly prized stocks in the world. The river is the tenth largest in the United States, as ranked by average discharge volume at its mouth. Description The Copper River rises out of the Copper Glacier, which lies on the northeast side of Mount Wrangell, in the Wrangell Mountains, within Wrangell-Saint Elias National Park. It begins by flowing almost due north in a valley that lies on the east side of Mount Sanford, and then turns west, forming the northwest edge of the Wrangell Mountains and separating them from the Mentasta Mountains to the northeast. It continues to turn southeast, through a wide marshy plain to Chitina, where it is joined from the southeast by the Chitina River (Ahtna Athabascan Tsedi Na' < tsedi \\"copper\\" + na‚Äô \\"river\\"). A man dip netting on the Copper River, undated photo by John Nathan Cobb (died 1931) The Copper River is approximately long. It drops an average of about , and drains more than ‚Äîan area the size of West Virginia. The river runs at an average of . Downstream from its confluence with the Chitina it flows southwest, passing through a narrow glacier-lined gap in the Chugach Mountains within the Chugach National Forest east of Cordova Peak. There is an extensive area of linear sand dunes up to in height radiating from the mouth of the Copper River. Both Miles Glacier and Childs Glacier calve directly into the river. The Copper enters the Gulf of Alaska southeast of Cordova where it creates a delta nearly wide. History The name of the river comes from the abundant copper deposits along the upper river that were used by Alaska Native population and then later by settlers from the Russian Empire and the United States. Extraction of the copper resources was problematic due to navigation difficulties at the river's mouth. The construction of the Copper River and Northwestern Railway from Cordova through the upper river valley from 1908 to 1911 allowed widespread extraction of the mineral resources, in particular from the Kennecott Mine, discovered in 1898. The mine was abandoned in 1938 and is now a ghost town tourist attraction and historic district maintained by the National Park Service. Copper River Highway (Alaska Route 10) runs from Cordova to the lower Copper River near Childs Glacier, following the old railroad route and ending at the reconstructed Million Dollar Bridge across the river. The Tok Cut-Off (Alaska Route 1) follows the Copper River Valley on the north side of the Chugach Mountains. Fisheries Copper River sockeyes, 2007 The river's famous salmon runs arise from the use of the river watershed by over 2 million salmon each year for spawning. The extensive runs result in many unique varieties, prized for their fat content. The river's commercial salmon season is very brief, beginning in May for chinook salmon and sockeye salmon for periods lasting days or hours at a time. Sport fishing by contrast is open all year long, but peak season on the Copper River lasts from August to September when the coho salmon runs. The fisheries are co-managed by the Alaska Department of Fish and Game (ADF&G;) and the Department of the Interior Federal Subsistence Board. Management data are obtained primarily by ADF&G; at the Miles Lake sonar station and the native village of Eyak at the Baird Canyon and Canyon Creek research stations. Birding The Copper River Delta, which extends for 700,000 acres (2,800 km2), is the largest contiguous wetlands along the Pacific coast of North America. It is used annually by 16 million shorebirds, including the world's entire population of western sandpipers and dunlins. It is also home to the world's largest population of nesting trumpeter swans and is the only known nesting site for the dusky Canada goose subspecies (Branta canadensis occidentalis).

The airport is southeast of the capital and is accessible by the Victoria-Providence Highway. It forms part of the administrative districts of La Pointe Larue (terminal area), Cascade/Providence (in the North), and Anse aux Pins (in the south and military base). The Seychelles non-directional beacon (Ident: SEY) is located off the approach end of Runway 13. The Seychelles VOR-DME (Ident: SEY) is located on the field. Terminals The domestic terminal is a short distance north of the international terminal and offers inter-island flights with a peak of a departure every 10‚Äì15 minutes at busy times which corresponds with international arrivals/departures and every 30 minutes at other times. A cargo terminal is south of the international terminal and handles freight from all international and domestic movements; it is run by Air Seychelles. A base of the Seychelles Public Defence Force (SPDF) is at the southeastern end of Runway 13 on an island that was joined with Mah√© at the construction of the airport. History Early years The opening of the Seychelles International Airport took place on 20 March 1972 by Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth II. Wilkenair of Kenya had, however, already started a ferry service between Mombasa and Mah√© via Diego Suarez in Madagascar and Astove Island (Seychelles) using a twin engine Piper Navajo the previous year. It operated to the Seychelles once a week. The first pilot to land at Seychelles airport was Tony Bentley-Buckle, who flew his private plane from Mombasa to Mahe via Moroni in March 1971 even before the airfield was complete.A. Bentley-Buckle Volume 2 of The British Navy at War and Peace. Whittles Publishing Ltd, U.K. - 2013 The flying time was 9 hours 35 minutes. This was followed by East African Airways in November 1971 and Luxair in December of the same year. A BOAC Super VC10 was the first jet aircraft to land at Seychelles International Airport on 4 July 1971. At the time of the opening it had a 2987 m runway and a control tower. Ground handling and all other airport operations were carried out by the DCA (Directorate of Civil Aviation). In 1972, John Faulkner Taylor and Tony Bentley-Buckle founded the first local aircraft company Air Mah√©, which operated a Piper PA-34 Seneca between Praslin, Fregate, and Mah√© Islands. This aircraft was later replaced by a Britten-Norman Islander. By 1974, over 30 airlines were flying to the Seychelles. Ground handling and all airport operations were being carried out by Aviation Seychelles Company, a company formed in 1973. Construction works for the substantial expansion of the airport started in July 1980 Due to the continuous increase in passenger traffic, a terminal building was built that could cater for 400 more arriving and 400 more departing passengers at any time. Parking bays for up to six large aircraft were built and a parking area for five light aircraft. In 1981, there was a gun battle at Seychelles International Airport, as British national Mike Hoare led a team of 43 South African mercenaries masquerading as holidaying rugby players in a coup attempt in what is known as the Seychelles affair. After their hidden weapons were discovered on arrival a skirmish ensued, with most of the mercenaries later escaping in a hijacked Air India jet.Seychelles: Life's a breeze near the equator The Telegraph, U.K. Development since the 2000s Apron view The years 2005/2006 brought further development of civil aviation in the Seychelles. The Civil Aviation Authority Act was enacted on 4 April 2006 for the corporatisation of the Directorate of Civil Aviation to Seychelles Civil Aviation Authority. Works started to upgrade and extend the terminal building, which has been further extended to handle at least five medium to large jet aircraft (e.g., Boeing 767 or Airbus A330) as well as six smaller jet aircraft (e.g. Boeing 737 or Airbus A320). Additional parking areas were made available to the north-east of the airport to handle the parking of charter, business, and long stay aircraft (e.g. some European flights arrive in the morning starting at 7 a.m. but do not depart until 10 p.m. onwards). This reduces jet-lag as any flight that leaves Seychelles at night will get to most Western European cities in the early morning and vice versa from the European cities to the Seychelles; it also provides sufficient rest for operating crews. The airport has been home to unmanned aerial vehicles operated by the United States Air Force and possibly the Central Intelligence Agency for operations over Somalia and the Horn of Africa. President of Seychelles James Michel apparently welcomed the presence of U.S. drones in Seychelles to combat Somalian piracy and terrorism, dating back to at least August 2009. At least two MQ-9 Reaper UAVs have crashed into the Indian Ocean near the airport since December 2011.

Several tour operators' coach services also link passengers to the ferry terminal at the Old Port (Vieux Port) for inter-island ferry services and to the New Port (Nouveau port) for cruise holidays. There are plans to link the airport with a light railway/tram system that will run along the east coast of Mah√© island due to the high transportation density of this area. Companies were invited to tender by the government in 2007.

Route description The southern terminus of SR 21 is on US 250 in Franklin Township, Tuscarawas County, north of Strasburg and about north of I-77 exit 87. At the intersection, westbound US 250, which had been heading north‚Äìnorthwest, turns to the west while its roadway continues as SR 21\\\\. The route is an undivided, two-lane road. SR 21 proceeds through Franklin Township. At the line with Bethlehem Township, Stark County, the route crosses SR 212 (Dolphin Street SW) and takes the name Erie Avenue SW. As the route enters Navarre, it takes on the character of a small-town street, taking the name Main Street, then enters a concurrency with US 62 at Canal Street. As the route continues through Navarre, it begins to pick up turn lanes. In northern Navarre, the route becomes three lanes, adding a center left-turn lane. Crossing out of Navarre and briefly returning to Bethlehem Township, the route resumes the Erie Avenue SW name. The route next proceeds into Perry Township, then crosses briefly through and skirts the edge of Massillon. SR 21 later crosses into both Summit County and Norton. Just after, there is an interchange with SR 585 and Wooster Road that has an unusual configuration. It is a hybrid cloverstack interchange with a left-hand flyover ramp from eastbound SR 585 to northbound SR 21\\\\. Eastbound Wooster Road just west of the interchange crosses the ramp from eastbound SR 585 to southbound SR 21 at-grade and merges with the loop ramp from southbound SR 21 to eastbound Wooster Road. Additionally, Wooster Road leads to Barberton. SR 21 merges onto I-77 (exit 136) in Copley Township and remains in a concurrency with the interstate until reaching exit 145 in Richfield, where it departs the interstate. SR 21 next passes under the Ohio Turnpike. It then passes through Brecksville and into Independence, where it crosses Interstate 480 on an overpass immediately east of I-480's interchange with I-77. It next passes briefly through Valley View and into Cuyahoga Heights. In Cuyahoga Heights, SR 21 reaches its northern terminus at I-77 exit 157. History SR 21 follows the route of the old U.S. Route 21, a major north-south highway that connected greater Cleveland, Ohio, to southern South Carolina. South of Strasburg, Ohio, near the current southern terminus of SR 21, the designation of US 21 was moved to the new Interstate 77 freeway in east-central and southeastern Ohio by the early 1970s and then decommissioned. North of Strasburg, what remained of US 21 as a route separate from I-77 became SR 21\\\\. While I-77 directly serves the larger cities of Canton, Akron and Cleveland, SR 21 connects the smaller communities of Massillon and Norton (and indirectly connects to Barberton), and serves some Northeast Ohio and Greater Cleveland suburbs as a local through route. Very heavily traveled before the Interstate era, much of SR 21 is divided highway or even freeway due to the needs of the time.

A coil strip of British 1957 Scouting commemorative stamps with the trimming of the perforations on one side clearly visible. A vertical coil pair with a joint line, US 1917. A coil stamp is a type of postage stamp sold in strips one stamp wide. The name derives from the usual handling of long strips, which is to coil them into rolls, in a manner reminiscent of adhesive tape rolls. A large percentage of modern stamps are sold in coil form, because they are more amenable to mechanized handling in large quantities than either sheet stamps or booklet stamps. Origins Coil stamps first appeared at the beginning of the 20th century. In Sweden While in most countries coil production is restricted to the workaday stamps used in large quantities, Sweden has produced coil versions of most of their stamps since 1920. In the United Kingdom In the UK, coil stamps first appeared in 1907, to supply newly installed stamp vending machines. As these were cut from complete sheets, they are perforated on all four sides. As each stamp was worth either a half or one old penny and 240 pence made up one pound sterling, the coils were in rolls of 960 or 480 each. In the United States In the United States, vending machine companies began to experiment with the automated dispensing of stamps. Early efforts to break sheets into strips manually did not work well, since they were prone to tearing and jamming, and soon the companies began to request imperforate sheets from the post office, cutting those into strips and punching holes of various shapes between each stamp. A variety of these \\"private coils\\" is known, some quite rare. The first US government-produced coils appeared in 1908, produced by pasting together enough imperforate sheets to make rolls of 500 or 1,000 stamps, cutting them into strips and perforating between. The 1-cent, 2-cent and 5-cent values in the Series of 1902 (Second Bureau Issue) were produced in coil versions, but relatively few copies exist because in late 1908 the series was superseded by the Washington-Franklin Issues. As a result, all Second Bureau coils are quite rare. Even the most common, the horizontal 2-cent coil, can fetch as much as US$2000, while the much rarer, the 1-cent vertical coil, brought $130,000 at an auction in 2009, and the even rarer 2-cent vertical coil (only eight copies are known) would surely sell for considerably more, should one become available.Siegel Power Search Later a rotary press was adopted, which eliminated the pasting stage. The cylindrical plate used on a rotary press has a seam where ink tends to accumulate, resulting in joint line pairs. Perforations The perforations of coil stamps are usually found along the right and left sides (\\"vertical perf\\"), but they have also been produced with perforations along the top and bottom (\\"horizontal perf\\"). Longer perforations on one side than the other, and separation by cutting rather than tearing, are indications that a stamp may have come from a coil. Recent innovations A recent innovation enabled by self-adhesive technology is the linerless coil stamp. While most self-adhesive stamps have backing paper, linerless coils are like a roll of adhesive tape. Such rolls tend to be enormous, with thousands of stamps, and tend to be used only by large mailing operations.

The fourth named storm and second hurricane of the annual hurricane season, Danielle originated from a tropical wave that emerged off the western coast of Africa on August 21\\\\. Tracking generally west-northwestward, the disturbance was initially disorganized; under favorable atmospheric conditions, shower and thunderstorm activity began to consolidate around a low-pressure center. Following a series of satellite intensity estimates, the system was upgraded to Tropical Depression Four during the pre-dawn hours of August 24, and further to Tropical Storm Danielle that afternoon. Moving around the southern periphery of the Azores High located in the northeastern Atlantic, quick intensification to hurricane status occurred early on August 25\\\\. By 0600 UTC the following day, Danielle reached an initial peak intensity of 105 mph (165 km/h), a Category 2 hurricane. Increased wind shear from a nearby trough encroached on further development later that day, and subsequently led to slight weakening. By 1200 UTC on August 27, despite continued unfavorable conditions, Danielle reached a second peak intensity equal to the first. Weakening once ensued late on August 27 in addition to the days following, and Danielle was a low-end Category 1 hurricane by August 31 as its forward speed slowed. As the cyclone reached the western periphery of the ridge that steered it across the Atlantic for much of its existence, it began yet another period of intensification, and once again attained a peak intensity as a Category 2 hurricane. Passing northwest of Bermuda, Danielle weakened to Category 1 hurricane strength, but for a final time intensified into a 105 mph (165 km/h) tropical cyclone thereafter. As the cyclone passed over increasingly cool sea surface temperatures and became intertwined in a baroclinic zone, it began to undergo an extratropical transition. At 0000 UTC on September 4, Danielle was no longer considered a tropical cyclone, despite retaining hurricane-force winds. Several days later, the remnants of Danielle merged with a larger extratropical low and became indistinguishable. As a tropical cyclone, it produced heavy rainfall in Puerto Rico and the Lesser Antilles, leading to flooding. Tropical storm-force winds were observed in Bermuda even though the cyclone passed well northwest of the island. During Danielle's transition to an extratropical cyclone, it produced light rain and led to minor beach erosion in Newfoundland. The larger extratropical low that merged with the system resulted in large waves off the coast of the United Kingdom, leading to major beach erosion and coastal flooding. Overall, no fatalities were reported with the system and it caused an estimated $50,000 (1998 USD) in damage. Meteorological history Satellite image of Danielle off the U.S. East Coast The origins of Hurricane Danielle trace back to a tropical wave that emerged off the western coast of Africa and into the eastern Atlantic Ocean early on August 21\\\\. Tracking west-northwestward, the National Hurricane Center (NHC) began Dvorak satellite intensity estimates later that morning following the consolidation of convection ‚Äì shower and thunderstorm activity ‚Äì near the system's center. Favorable atmospheric conditions led to further organization, and it is estimated that the disturbance intensified into a tropical depression by 0600 UTC on August 24, while located roughly west-southwest of the Cape Verde Islands. Operationally, the National Hurricane Center initiated advisories at 1530 UTC and noted that the depression was already on the verge of tropical storm intensity. The depression was upgraded to Tropical Storm Danielle later on August 24 following an increase in organization on satellite imagery. As the cyclone moved northwestward along the southern periphery of the Azores High, it began a period of rapid deepening in which a \\"pinhole\\" eye became distinguishable on satellite imagery; on this basis, Danielle was upgraded to a hurricane at 1200 UTC on August 25\\\\. At the time, Danielle was a compact system, with tropical storm force winds spanning only from the center. Although the NHC was fairly certain that the storm would continue west- northwestward, a veer north or south of the forecast track seemed plausible due to the influence of an upper-level low to the west-northwest of Danielle. Nonetheless, the storm continued its west-northwest track. At 0600 UTC on August 26, Danielle attained its maximum sustained wind speed of 105 mph (165 km/h), one of four peak intensities. Although the eye became obscured and southeasterly vertical wind shear increased late on August 26, the National Hurricane Center did not indicate weakening and instead predicted that Danielle would reach winds of 120 mph (195 km/h) by late on August 27. Early on August 27, a United States Air Force reconnaissance aircraft flight reported surface winds of 80 mph (130 km/h), though post-analysis indicates that the intensity of the storm was underestimated. The storm briefly re- strengthened slightly on August 27, reaching its maximum sustained wind speed of 105 mph (165 km/h) for the second time at 1200 UTC. Vertical wind shear persisted and Danielle soon began to weaken again. Later on August 27, the National Hurricane Center predicted that the storm would travel along the periphery of an anticyclone centered just east of Bermuda, which would keep the storm away from the East Coast of the United States. Despite being in an apparently favorable environment, Danielle continued to slowly weaken, as the forecast for decreasing wind shear did not initially materialize. Additionally, upwelling from Hurricane Bonnie roughly a week earlier contributed to a decrease in strength. Although the storm weakened further, reconnaissance aircraft observations on August 29 concluded that the structure of Danielle had improved compared to the previous day. By early on August 30, Danielle had weakened to the extent that it was only a minimal hurricane, with maximum winds of 75 mph (120 km/h) at the time. On August 30, the National Hurricane Center noted that Danielle would soon leave the upwelling track left by Bonnie, and likely lead to intensification. Thus, the possibility of re- strengthening increased, though predictions only showed gradual intensification. Earl on September 2, 1998 By early on August 31, an increase in sustained winds, a decrease in barometric pressure, and a wide eye observed by reconnaissance aircraft all suggested that Danielle was beginning to intensify. On August 31, the anticyclone near Bermuda caused Danielle to curve northeastward, away from the East Coast of the United States. Later that day, a significant increase in intensity led the storm to again reach its maximum sustained wind speed of 105 mph (165 km/h). On September 1, there was significant uncertainty in the future intensity of Danielle, as a shortwave trough located northeast of the storm would either enhance outflow, causing strengthening, or increase wind shear, resulting in weakening. At 1500 UTC on September 1, it was predicted that Danielle would strengthen slightly before weakening and becoming extratropical by September 3. Three hours later, Danielle reached its maximum sustained wind speed of 105 mph (165 km/h) for the fourth and final time. Early on September 2, the storm weakened again and was downgraded to a Category 1 hurricane. At 0600 UTC on September 3, Danielle reached its minimum barometric pressure of 960 mb (hPa; 28.35 inHg), although sustained winds were only 80 mph (130 km/h) at the time. As late as 1500 UTC on September 3, satellite imagery indicated that Danielle was retaining tropical characteristics. The National Hurricane Center did not forecast any further weakening before the extratropical transition, but instead mentioned the possibility of baroclinic strengthening. Late on September 3, the final advisory was issued on the transitioning storm. Danielle officially transitioned into an extratropical cyclone at 0000 UTC on September 4 according to a post-season report from the NHC, while located east-southeast of Newfoundland. The remnants of Danielle traversed east and eventually northeastward across the Atlantic Ocean. It produced rough seas in the British Isles on September 6 before merging with an extratropical low pressure area north of Ireland on September 8. Preparations and impact Shortly after formation, Danielle was considered a potential threat to the Lesser Antilles, with the National Hurricane Center noting that \\"any deviation to the left of the track would bring Danielle closer [to] the Leeward Islands.\\" However, Danielle bypassed far enough north of the Lesser Antilles to prevent any tropical storm or hurricane watches or warnings. Several days later, the storm was considered a possible threat to Florida by local newspapers, though the National Hurricane Center accurately predicted a re-curvature from the United States mainland well in advance. At 1500 UTC on September 1, at which time Danielle was situated northeast of the Bahamas, a tropical storm warning was issued for Bermuda; this was later cancelled after Danielle passed northwest of the island. The outer bands of Danielle produced heavy rainfall in Puerto Rico, causing street flooding and landslides in Bayam√≥n, Guaynabo, Toa Alta, and Vega Alta; several streams overflowed their banks, causing additional flooding. In a neighborhood of Bayam√≥n, one house was damaged after a wall collapsed. Losses in Puerto Rico totaled to approximately $50,000 (1998 USD). Hurricane Bonnie ripped an artificial reef composed of tires offshore Atlantic Beach, North Carolina in late August. Danielle washed numerous of these loose tires ashore, especially on Emerald Isle. As a result, the Governor of North Carolina, Jim Hunt, requested prison labor and the National Guard to clean up beaches from Brunswick County to Carteret County. Instead of resulting in further erosion in the aftermath of Bonnie farther up along the coast, Danielle led to a increase in sand along the New Jersey coastline. In Bermuda, sustained winds of and a gust of were reported on September 2. Offshore Atlantic Canada, wave heights reached as high as . However, other than light rainfall in Newfoundland, the storm caused no impact in Canada. Tori Murden, an American attempting to become the first woman to solo row across the Atlantic Ocean, encountered rough seas from the storm and its remnants. By September 7, Murden sent out a distress signal and was rescued by the Independent Spirit later that day. While passing near the British Isles on September 6 as an extratropical storm, Danielle produced severe sea conditions on the western part of the isles. Major beach erosion was observed, and many people required rescuing. Coastal portions of Cornwall were evacuated as high waves inundated many homes, and an all-terrain police vehicle was shoved into the sea by a rogue wave in the Isles of Scilly. An 11‚Äëyear-old boy and his father were trapped in a sea cave on the north coast of Cornwall due to rough surf. Two other men from Port Isaac also became isolated in the same location after their boat capsized. All four were eventually rescued by a helicopter that hovered near the entrance of the sea cave. At the West Sands Caravan Park near Selsey, West Sussex, twelve families were evacuated to higher ground. A yacht carrying eight people ran aground near Calshot; they required rescuing by the Solent Coastguards. Flash flooding was reported throughout Wiltshire, especially in the town of Melksham. Numerous motorists were left stranded in inundated streets, while water entered several homes, store basements, a fire station, and the Cooper Avon tyre factory.

Those fans who pre- ordered the album received an exclusive 2-CD \\"Deluxe Campaign Edition\\" with a booklet containing the names of everyone who pre-ordered before a certain date. The public release date of the retail single-CD version of the album was 3 May 2004 while a plain 2-CD version was made available from the band's website. A limited (500 copy) edition was released on white multicoloured vinyl by Racket Records on 13 November 2006. The album did not chart in the UK, due to it being packaged with a couple of stickers, which is against chart rules. So despite selling enough for a top 30 position, the album was declared ineligible for the album chart; however, its first single \\"You're Gone\\", reached #7 in the UK Singles Chart, thus becoming their first UK top ten hit since 1987's \\"Incommunicado\\".

The southern terminus is in Hunting Island State Park, South Carolina, of US 21 Business and South Carolina Highway 802 (SC 802) in Beaufort. The northern terminus is in Wytheville, Virginia at an interchange with Interstate 81 (I-81) and US 52\\\\. It travels through the states of South Carolina, North Carolina, and Virginia. It also connects through major Southeastern cities such as Columbia, South Carolina and Charlotte, North Carolina. The northern portion of the road travels parallel to I-77 in northern South Carolina and North Carolina. The road also has three interchanges with I-26 in Lexington and Calhoun counties in South Carolina. Route description South Carolina US 21 travels through the state. Beginning at Hunting Island State Park, US 21 travels west toward Beaufort, where it widens to four lanes. The route bypasses Beaufort to the south, going through Port Royal, Shell Point, and Burton. In the Beaufort area, US 21 passes by the entrances to Parris Island and MCAS Beaufort, the major Marine Corps installations in the area. North of Beaufort, US 21 continues as a four-lane divided highway and intersects with US 17\\\\. The route travels in a wrong-way concurrency with US 17 south for before turning north towards Yemassee, South Carolina, where it becomes a rural two-lane road and intersects with US 17 Alternate. North of Yemassee, US 21 splits off and crosses Interstate 95 (I-95) at exit 42\\\\. The two-lane route continues through rural portions of the state. US 21 goes through Smoaks and Branchville, South Carolina and bypasses Orangeburg. North of Orangeburg, US 21 runs roughly parallel to I-26 until Gaston where it conjoins US 321 and becomes an urban highway. US 21 passes through Cayce, West Columbia, and Columbia. North of Columbia, US 21 splits from US 321, reverting to a rural two-lane road parallel to I-77. In York County, US 21 enters urban areas again, connecting Rock Hill and Fort Mill. Near the North Carolina state line, US 21 merges with I-77 near Carowinds, then enters North Carolina. North Carolina US 21 begins as a concurrency with I-77 in Charlotte, which it repeats three times within the state. Its first break with I-77 is along Statesville Avenue, then proceeding through Huntersville and Cornelius, however, because of its close proximity to I-77 and North Carolina Highway 115 (NC 115), it has no interchange with I-485. The second break with I-77 occurs at Mooresville, where US 21 travels through the city and then northwest into Statesville. After Statesville, US 21 travels northeast to Harmony and Brooks Crossroads, before merging back with I-77 near Jonesville. North of Elkin, US 21 splits with I-77 for the last time and goes north to Sparta, passing the Blue Ridge Parkway after a major, curvy section. North of Sparta, at Twin Oaks, US 221 overlaps with US 21 before entering Virginia. US 21 travels through the western Piedmont of North Carolina, either combined with I-77 or as a two-lane rural road; from the South Carolina state line to Elkin, travelers can easily skip a majority of US 21 via I-77. Virginia View south along US 21 at SR 805 in Grayson County, Virginia After a few miles crossing the state line, US 21 reaches the town of Independence, where it splits with US 221 and continues north. The route goes through the Mount Rogers National Recreation Area before entering the city of Wytheville. After a short concurrency with US 11 in downtown Wytheville, it goes north and ends at the intersection of I-81/US 52\\\\. US 21 travels through western Virginia, mostly as a two-lane rural mountain road. History Southern terminus of US 21 at Hunting Island, South Carolina US 21 in the pre-Interstate era was a north‚Äìsouth highway connecting the area around Lake Erie and the coastal South. One of the few true north‚Äìsouth routes to cross the middle Appalachian Mountains, it became an important corridor for motor traffic between northeastern Ohio, western Pennsylvania, (with US 19) and western New York state with central North Carolina, central and southeastern South Carolina, and (by connecting with other highways) coastal Georgia and most of Florida. US 21 originally (in 1926) connected Cleveland, Ohio, and Yemassee, South Carolina. In 1935 it was extended to Beaufort, South Carolina, and again in 1953 to its current southern terminus at the Atlantic Coast at Hunting Island State Park, between the city of Beaufort and Fripp Island. In the Interstate Highway era much of US 21 became an obvious corridor for a long-distance expressway. The West Virginia Turnpike between Charleston, West Virginia, and Princeton, West Virginia, was the first segment of a planned series of toll highways along or near US 21 from Cleveland to Charlotte, North Carolina. All of the other toll highways were shelved in favor of freeways built with Interstate funding; these freeways and the West Virginia Turnpike became I-77, which completely supplanted old US 21 as a long-distance through route. I-77 was later extended to Columbia, South Carolina, also within a few miles of US 21\\\\. Between Cleveland and Charleston, all but a relatively short segment of US 21 was completely deleted in favor of I-77, the relics being State Route 21 (SR 21), SR 821 between Byesville and Marietta, Ohio, and Guernsey County Road 35 and Tuscarawas County Road 3 (Salt Fork Road), named Old Twenty-One Road and closely follows the route of US 21 from Byesville, Ohio to the village of Newcomerstown, Ohio. County Road 35 briefly becomes a variety of street names as it passes through Cambridge, such as Byesville Road, North Avenue, 11th Street, and Clark Street, before reverting to Old Twenty-One Road on the north side of Cambridge. From there, much of the old US 21 is still intact, however, some sections were demolished and redirected in favor of I-77. Once crossing the Guernsey/Tuscarawas county line, it becomes Salt Fork Road for about a mile, before joining Ohio State Route 258, which takes it the rest of the way to Newcomerstown. In total, the entire section of Old Twenty-One Road between North Cambridge and Newcomerstown is a total of 22.5 miles. The section of US 21 between Mineral Wells and Charleston is now signed as County Route 21 in all four counties along the route (Wood, Wirt, Jackson, and Kanawha). Between Charleston and its current northern terminus at Wytheville, Virginia, almost all of US 21 coincided with either US 60, US 19, or US 52, which remained as US 21 was deleted. The short segment of US 21 in southern West Virginia not coinciding with another U.S. Highway became an extension of West Virginia Route 16. In North Carolina, US 21 originally entered the state along today's NC 51 into Pineville, then followed Old Pineville Road into Charlotte. In the mid-1930s, US 21 moved over to South Boulevard from Old Pineville Road. In 1969, US 21 was rerouted following today's I-77 alignment, the old route was replaced by an extension of US 521\\\\. From 1975‚Äì87, US 21 moved north in segments onto I-77 to its current alignment ending at exit 16A (Sunset Road). Further north, US 21 originally followed Old Statesville Road, replaced in 1956 by NC 115\\\\. In 1966, US 21 was bypassed around Jonesville and Elkin, replaced with US 21 Business.

It has been introduced to many tropical areas, and has become a mildly invasive species in Hawaii, Seychelles, Ascension Island and the Society Islands. The plant may be confused with Philodendron bipinnatifidum as they have similar leaves and growing habits. However, the ingestion of Philodendron bipinnatifidum may cause irritation to the digestive tract and will induce internal swelling. The sap is also known to irritate the skin. Names The specific epithet deliciosa means \\"delicious\\", referring to the edible fruit, while monstera means \\"monstrous\\", in reference to the size that this plant can grow to, over in many cases. Its popular name as a houseplant of \\"Swiss cheese plant\\", or just \\"cheese plant\\", is commonly stated to refer to the holes which develop in its leaves similar to the holes in some Swiss cheeses such as Emmental cheese. Monstera adansonii, which also has holes in the leaves, is also called \\"Swiss cheese plant\\", or Swiss cheese vine.

Description This member of the arum family Araceae is an epiphyte with aerial roots, able to grow up to high in the wild, with large, leathery, glossy, heart-shaped leaves long by broad. The leaves on young plants are smaller and entire with no lobes or holes, but soon produce lobed and fenestrate leaves as they grow.http://www.hort.purdue.edu/newcrop/morton/ceriman.html Fruits of warm climates pp. 15‚Äì17 (1987) access date 2010-07-09Liebmann, Frederik Michael. 1849. Videnskabelige Meddelelser fra Dansk Naturhistorisk Forening i Kj√∏benhavn 1849: 19, Monstera deliciosa Although it can grow very tall in nature, it only measures between when grown indoors. The leaves are large (up to long), heart-shaped and pinnate. The older the plant, the more the leaves are covered with its familiar large perforations. Wild seedlings grow towards the darkest area they can grow until they find a tree trunk, then start to grow up towards the light, creeping up the tree.Online reference to Monstera deliciosa The inflorescence is adorned with a cream-white spathe of uniform, velvety appearance, covering, like a hood, a yellowish white spadix high and about in diameter. Flowers are self pollinating, containing both androecium and gynoecium. Since they contain both structures, this plant is able to self- pollinate. Fruit M. deliciosa fruit growing The fruit of Monstera deliciosa is up to long and diameter, and it looks like a green ear of maize covered with hexagonal scales. As the fruit ripens, these scales or platelets fall off the fruit, releasing a strong and sweet scent. The smell has been compared to a combination of pineapples and bananas. The fruit is edible and safe for humans. Fruits of plants of the Araceae (Arum family) often contain raphides and trichosclereids ‚Äì needle-like structures of calcium oxalate. In M. deliciosa, unripe fruit containing these needle-like crystalline structures can cause irritation of the mouth. It takes longer than a year for fruits to reach maturity. The fruit first shows signs of ripening by the yellowing of its lowest scales. As it ripens, the starch that was stored in the green fruit is converted to sugar, giving it its sweet flavor. This mechanism is comparable to how banana fruits ripen. The strong odor the fruit produces becomes noticeable when it is half-ripe. As time passes and the fruit continues to ripen, the odor becomes stronger. After it becomes fully ripe, however, the scent deteriorates quickly. Distribution and growth This plant lives in the humid tropical forests, in the lowlands and middle mountains, in the extreme south of Mexico and also in Belize, Honduras, Costa Rica, Guatemala and Panama. The seeds fall to the ground, then the seedlings crawl (negative phototropism) until they meet a tree on which to attach. The many adjacent roots thus allow the plant to anchor against its new support and reach the canopy light (although it rarely grows in full sun and prefers a light dimmed by the foliage). Wild plants can also be found in other parts of North America (Florida), Asia (Malaysia, India), Australia and the western Mediterranean (Sicily, Portugal, Morocco, Madeira). Cultivation Monstera deliciosa is commonly grown outdoors as an ornamental plant in the tropics and subtropics. The plant requires a lot of space and a rich and loose soil (ideally garden soil and compost in equal parts). If it grows in the ground it is better to plant it near a tree, where it can climb, if not against a trellis. It is moderately greedy and needs to be watered just to keep the soil slightly moist. Its hardiness is 11 (that is to say the coldest at ). It cannot withstand these temperatures for more than a few hours, but it can live outside in certain regions (Mediterranean coast, Brittany). A steady minimum temperature of at least is preferable, allowing continuous growth. Growth ceases below and it is killed by frost. It needs very bright exposure, but not full sun. Forcing a M. deliciosa to flower outside of its typical tropical habitat proves to be difficult. Specific conditions need to be met for the plant to flower. However, in its tropical and subtropical habitat, the plant flowers easily. In ideal conditions it flowers about three years after planting. The plant can be propagated by taking cuttings of a mature plant or by air layering. Harvesting the fruit In those areas where it grows naturally, M. deliciosa is considered a delicacy due to its sweet and exotic flavor. The fruit may be ripened by cutting it when the first scales begin to lift up and it begins to exude a pungent odor. It is wrapped in a paper bag and set aside until the scales begin popping off. The scales are then brushed off or fall away to reveal the edible flesh underneath. The flesh, which is similar to pineapple in texture, can be cut away from the core and eaten. It has a fruity taste similar to jackfruit and pineapple. The unripe green fruits can irritate the throat and the latex of the leaves and vines can create rashes in the skin, because both contain potassium oxalate: that is the reason why the fruits have to be consumed when the scales lift up. The black irritant fibres can be swept off with the application of a little citrus juice. Indoor cultivation Its architectural qualities, ease of cultivation, and tolerance of a wide range of conditions make it an ideal plant for indoor cultivation as well. For this reason it is a popular plant for the home or office throughout the temperate northern hemisphere. It prefers bright indirect light and temperatures of . Flowering is rare when grown indoors. In the UK Monstera deliciosa and the cultivar 'Variegata' have gained the Royal Horticultural Society's Award of Garden Merit. Other uses The aerial roots have been used as ropes in Peru, and to make baskets in Mexico. In Martinique the root is used to make a remedy for snakebite.

As of 2018 the company has approximately 600,000 subscribers, mostly in the United States. DTN is known for its accurate meteorological forecasting and large network of weather stations, its market analysis services, and its early use of radio and satellite systems to transmit reports to its Midwestern consumers. DTN also operates The Progressive Farmer magazine. DTN was previously owned by Telvent and Schneider Electric, and since 2017 has been owned by Zurich-based TBG. History Formation (1984‚Äì1987) In the early 1980s the Omaha-based company Scoular Grain was a growing agribusiness led by Nebraska grain industry executive Marshall Faith. Faith, along with several other investors, had acquired what was then Scoular-Bishop Grain Company in 1967 and expanded its operations from three grain elevators to dozens of locations in multiple states, and was beginning to branch out beyond grain warehousing. On 9 April 1984 the company created a new subsidiary incorporated under the name Scoular Information Services with the goal of improving communications with farmers. The project was led by Omaha native Roger Brodersen, Scoular's chief operating officer and the executive who supervised new-project development and corporate acquisitions for the company. The subsidiary soon became known as Dataline. Dataline's chief product was an FM radio receiver unit that would pick up Dataline broadcasts transmitted via sideband signals. Farmers and agribusinesses would buy the receivers to get agricultural information and commodities updates. Dataline's customers preferred to lease the receivers rather than buy them, but Scoular was unwilling to finance the equipment, so Brodersen bought Dataline in 1986 and a year later took its stock public in order to raise the capital necessary to acquire the receivers and to develop other information products. Under the new model, subscribers would receive a radio signal receiver and a video terminal at no charge, and then pay a monthly subscription to receive 24-hour-a-day broadcasts of 20+ pages of market information, weather reports, and analysis. In late 1986 the monthly fees were $17.50 and the service was available in Nebraska, Minnesota, Iowa, and Illinois. Public broadcasting station WILL in Champaign was one broadcaster that carried the Dataline signal. At the beginning of 1987 Dataline had 5,300 subscribers; that grew to 10,000 by May and 13,500 in ten states by October. In addition to being accessible on terrestrial FM carriers, Dataline was also broadcast from the Galaxy 1 communications satellite. Monthly fees were $19.50 for 65 videotext pages of market quotes, grain and livestock information, commentary, weather, and reports. In September Dataline partnered with a subsidiary of ConAgra to add an \\"electronic catalog\\" feature to their information feed, allowing subscribers to browse farm supplies, equipment, and other products. On 17 September 1987 the company re-incorporated and was renamed Data Transmission Network. Expansion (1988‚Äì1997) The company, commonly identified simply as DTN, expanded rapidly through the late 1980s and early 1990s; its operating cash flow grew roughly 30% each year beginning in 1989 and by 1993 was $12.9M. By mid-1994 DTN had roughly 77,000 subscribers, about 60,000 of which were in the agricultural sector; the remainder were mostly in the finance and energy industries. Subscriptions in 1994 were $26 a month; satellite connection was an extra $7/month and a color monitor an extra $20/month. By 1997 it had 152,000 customers, 110,000 of which were in agriculture. Beginning in the mid-1990s DTN also grew its operations by acquiring other data and meteorology companies. In May 1996 it acquired its chief competitor FarmDayta (formerly Broadcast Partners) of Urbandale, Iowa for $73M, and adopted its 38,500 subscribers. In 1998 DTN merged its weather services division with Minneapolis-based Kavouras, a company founded in 1977 that specialized in radar-based weather reporting and prediction; DTN also acquired Weather Services Corporation (WSC), a Lexington, Massachusetts-based forecasting and climate prediction company that developed meteorological databases. The union of the three weather organizations became known as DTN/Meteorlogix. The company also worked in the '90s to expand into niche markets by offering more specialized service offerings. Sale and bankruptcy (1998‚Äì2003) In the late 1990s, DTN entered a period of financial uncertainty, in part due to increasing competition with new free information channels like CNBC, the Weather Channel, and websites run by Farm Journal and Pioneer. In response, DTN sought to expand its customer base by selling a broader array of services, including inventory-tracking for auto dealers, coupon-printing kiosks for grocery stores, fire-alert information for forestry services, and other ventures. DTN gained 7,600 new subscribers but lost 4,500 from its core group of agricultural customers, and its stock fell 38% in 1999. Since April 1998, DTN had been seeking an organization to buy the 1300-employee company, but after 11 months had not found anyone willing to pay price that the board felt was appropriate, so in mid-March 1999 founder Roger Brodersen called off the search for a buyer. One week later on 24 March, Brodersen and four other directors resigned and Peter Kamin was named the new chairman. Kamin, the leader of a stockholders group that pressed to sell the company, resumed the search for a buyer. In April 2000, the New York City-based private equity firm Veronis Suhler Stevenson agreed to buy out DTN for $451M, including $91M in debt. DTN at the time had approximately 166,000 clients. Veronis implemented a new strategy by splitting DTN into four separate divisions: agriculture, energy, weather, and financial services. Robert Gordon, who would later become DTN CEO, was hired to run the weather division. Staffing up the four divisions proved slow and costly, and by 2003 sales were lower than in 1998. DTN entered Chapter 11 bankruptcy in late 2003 and its operation was taken over by a consortium of banks led by Wachovia, DTN's lead creditor. DTN emerged from bankruptcy six weeks later. Revival (2004‚Äì2007) Robert Gordon became president in January and CEO in July 2004. He gradually reduced staff to 675, eliminated redundancies, and pushed a new strategy of selling proprietary data at a premium price. Customers paid larger subscription fees ($100 a month for many weather customers) to receive customized, hourly webcasts based on more precise computer models; ag customers paid roughly 50% more for analyses of issues like Asian soybean rust and avian influenza; and energy customers gained access to online exchanges with real-time fuel prices. Gordon's strategy proved successful and DTN began to re-expand. In July 2006 DTN acquired St. Louis-based Surface Systems, Inc. (SSI), a company specializing in weather monitors for roads and airport runways, and integrated its customers and its network of 6000 surface sensors into its Meteorlogix division. In 2007 it acquired the majority of the Edmond, Oklahoma company WeatherBank, integrating its energy, transportation, public safety, and agriculture weather forecasting customers into Meteorlogix. In 2007 DTN also arranged with publisher Time Warner to acquire The Progressive Farmer, an agricultural magazine founded in 1886 and read at the time of acquisition by approximately 600,000 subscribers. The deal for an undisclosed sum supported Time Warner's strategy of shedding smaller publications to focus on its larger magazine properties and DTN's mission of providing agricultural information. DTN remained structured around four brands: DTN Ag, DTN Energy, DTN Market Access, and DTN Meteorlogix. Telvent and Schneider (2008‚Äì2016) On 28 October 2008 Madrid-based IT company Telvent acquired DTN in a $445M all-cash deal. DTN at the time of the acquisition had about 700 employees, 700,000 subscribers, and annual revenues of approximately $180M, with about 90% of its sales derived from its subscription-based services. After its acquisition the company became known as Telvent DTN. Telvent itself was purchased in 2011 by Schneider Electric, a large energy management company based in Rueil- Malmaison, France. Schneider announced in early 2011 that it had reached a deal to acquire Telvent, and in August received regulatory approval to complete the ‚Ç¨1.4B acquisition. Telvent DTN's revenue at the time of the acquisition was approximately $213 million. In June 2014 DTN acquired RevCo, a St. Louis-based agricultural data management business. TBG and recent growth (2017‚Äì) DTN logo circa 2017. In 2016 Schneider put DTN up for sale after a strategic review found that it wasn't essential to the company. Several firms were interested in purchasing DTN (including London-based Euromoney Institutional Investor), but it was Zurich-based venture capital firm TBG that ultimately purchased DTN and in April 2017 completed its acquisition of the company for $900M. Since its purchase by TBG, DTN has acquired several smaller corporations or systems: * Wilkens Weather (acquired 29 September 2017), a marine weather forecasting company based in Houston, Texas and previously owned by Rockwell Collins. * Spensa Technologies (acquired 2 April 2018), a precision agriculture technology company founded in January 2009 and based in the Purdue Research Park in West Lafayette, Indiana. * Energy Management Institute (acquired 10 April 2018), a provider of training services and marketing analysis based in New York City. * Weather Decision Technologies (acquired 8 October 2018), a provider of weather decision support solutions based in Norman, Oklahoma. * PraxSoft (acquired 10 June 2019), previously Praxis Software, a provider of sensor interfaces and communications technology based in Orlando, Florida. * Weatherzone (acquired 1 October 2019), a weather information provider based in Australia. * ClearAg (acquired May 2020 for $12M), a system created by California-based Iteris for monitoring and predicting agricultural conditions. MeteoGroup, a private Europe-based weather organisation acquired by parent TBG in September 2018, is being integrated into DTN. Business sectors Agriculture DTN's agricultural division sells services to farmers and agribusinesses. * For farmers and other producers, DTN provides ag market information, insights on market prices and strategies, and detailed weather information and forecasts. DTN also creates applications used by growers to determine the best time to work fields or spray for pests, and offers Adapt-N-based field nitrogen analysis and planning. * For agribusinesses DTN offers market information and analysis, tools to manage grain trading and communications with growers, weather reports, and other services. Since 2007 DTN has owned and operated The Progressive Farmer, a 600,000-circulation farm and agribusiness magazine founded in 1886. DTN serves about 50,000 growers in North America and most leading agribusinesses. Weather DTN generates weather reports, forecasts, and analysis aimed at consumers in seven sectors: aviation, marine, utilities, renewable energy, transportation, sports, and construction/public safety. Forecasts and reports are based on large data sets that combine proprietary information from DTN's network of 6,000 weather stations with other global content sources. One such source is DTN Services and Systems Spain, where D-ATIS and D-VOLMET systems are manufactured for the company. Combining the various data into a single forecast is done in part through the National Center for Atmospheric Research's Dynamic Integrated foreCast (DICast), a technology licensed from the University Corporation for Atmospheric Research. DTN employs 70 professional meteorologists, most of whom work from locations in Nebraska and Minnesota. The company's forecasts were ranked as the most accurate in the US each year since 2006 for predictions of short-term precipitation and high temperatures. WeatherSentry Online is DTN Weather's principal platform. Oil and gas In the energy sector DTN focuses on the buying, selling, transportation, and storage of fuel. DTN offers real-time fuel market data, tools to monitor how fuel is distributed, and software for managing and automating fuel storage.

Power-ups such as \\"hyposprays\\", which heal damage, and cloaking devices, which render the player invisible, can be found scattered throughout the levels or on corpses. Since the player can carry only one weapon at a time and ammunition is scarce, hand- to-hand combat is the most effective and common means of defeating enemies. The player can punch, kick, and throw enemies; progressing into later levels unlocks stronger moves and combos. There are multiple classes of enemy, each with its own style of unarmed combat. Each class is subdivided into tiers of increasing strength. As in Bungie's earlier Marathon titles, tiers are color- coded, in this case by green (weakest), blue, and red (strongest). Also color- coded are the levels of health each opponent has, indicated by a flash when the player strikes or shoots them. Green flashes show the opponent has high health, red flashes show the enemy is near death. Oni does not confine the player to fighting small groups of enemies in small arenas; each area is fully open to explore. The fourteen levels are of various sizes, some large enough to comprise an entire building. Bungie hired two architects to design the buildings. The Oni engine implements a method of interpolation that tweens key frames, smoothing out the animation of complex martial-arts moves. However, frame slippage is a common problem when multiple non-player characters near the player are attacking. Plot The events of Oni take place in or after the year 2032. The game world is a dystopia, an Earth so polluted that little of it remains habitable. To solve international economic crises, all nations have combined into a single entity, the World Coalition Government. The government is totalitarian, telling the populace that what are actually dangerously toxic regions are wilderness preserves, and uses its police forces, the Technological Crimes Task Force (TCTF), to suppress opposition. The player character, code-named Konoko (voiced by Amanda Winn-Lee), full name later given as Mai Hasegawa, begins the game working for the TCTF. Soon, she learns her employers have been keeping secrets about her past from her. She turns against them as she embarks on a quest of self-discovery. The player learns more about her family and origins while battling both the TCTF and its greatest enemy, the equally monolithic criminal organization called the Syndicate. In the game's climax, Konoko discovers a Syndicate plan to cause the Atmospheric Conversion Centers, air-treatment plants necessary to keep most of the world's population alive, to catastrophically malfunction. She is partially successful in thwarting the plot, saving a portion of humanity. Development The game's universe is heavily influenced by Mamoru Oshii's anime film Ghost in the Shell, with some additional influence from Akira. The original plan was for Konoko to be a cyborg like Ghost in the Shell's Motoko Kusanagi. The explanation for her superhuman abilities was changed to be more organic with the addition of the Daodan Chrysalis concept by design lead Hardy LeBel. Oni was originally expected to be released in the fourth quarter of 1999. Advertising was targeted towards that shipping date, and the game won E3's Game Critics Awards for Best Action/Adventure Game in 1999. However, development difficulties caused the release date to be pushed back continuously. The acquisition of Bungie by Microsoft in 2000 then led to the transfer of the Oni IP to Take-Two Interactive (which owned 20% of the studio prior to Microsoft's acquisition). Since Bungie's employees were moving to the new office location in Microsoft's headquarters or leaving the company, work on Oni had to be completed as quickly as possible. Due to a lack of time to resolve issues with the multiplayer code and to finish the levels intended for use by multiplayer mode, this functionality was omitted from the released version. A sequel was in development at Angel Studios for two years before being cancelled for unknown reasons. Reception The game received \\"average\\" reviews on both platforms according to the review aggregation website Metacritic. Some reviewers were unimpressed by the minimal detail of the environment graphics, the lack of intelligence on the part of the AI in some situations, and the plot, which was occasionally criticized as underdeveloped.Firing Squad's review The game's difficulty in combination with a lack of savepoints was sometimes cited as a negative. Moreover, many fans felt cheated because the game did not deliver on all of its promises. The most notable shortcoming was the absence of LAN-based multiplayer, which had been demoed at hands-on booths at Macworld Expos during Onis development, but removed before release due to stated concerns over latency issues. This too contributed to some lower scores from reviewers. Some of the game's content was cut as well. This included the highly anticipated \\"Iron Demon\\", a large mech shown in-game in one trailer. Also, many of the weapons featured in the trailer and the game cover were not in the game. However, Oni received the most praise for its smooth character animation and large array of fighting moves, as well as how it blended gunplay and melee combat. Thus, reviewers gave Oni mostly average-to-good scores in recognition of the enjoyment factor of the game. Jeff Lundgren of Next Generation said of the PlayStation 2 version, \\"It may have been a long time coming, but it was worth the wait. In fact, in a number of important ways, this is the game The Bouncer should have been.\\" In the United States, Oni sold 50,000 copies by October 2001.  Anniversary Edition  \\"The Anniversary Edition\\" was made by fans and the community, based on years of research, and enhances the retail copy of Oni. The first official release of the Edition was made seven years after Oni's release, hence the original name of the project, \\"Seventh Anniversary Edition\\".

Topography includes low, rolling mountains, plains and lowlands, moderately high rugged mountainous land, and some gently sloped plateaus and highlands. The river contains an exceptional population of sheefish (Stenodus leucicthys), a large predatory whitefish within the salmon family, found throughout the Arctic that spawns in the river's upper reaches during the autumn., FishBase (April 2007) A portion of the vast Western Arctic Caribou Herd utilize the Kobuk river valley as winter range., Alaska Department of Fish and Game (December 2003)  Course  It is commonly assumed that the Kobuk River issues from Walker Lake. However, the headwaters of the river are to the east of Walker Lake in the Endicott Mountains within the Gates of the Arctic National Park and Preserve, just north of the Arctic Circle. It flows briefly south, descending from the mountains through two spectacular canyons (Upper and Lower Kobuk Canyon), then flows generally west along the southern flank of the western Brooks Range in a broad wetlands valley. In the valley it passes a connected community of inland native villages, including Kobuk, Shungnak, and Ambler, where it receives the Ambler River. In the river's lower reaches, where it passes between the Baird and Waring mountains, it traverses Kobuk Valley National Park, the location of the Kobuk Sand Dunes. It then passes Kiana. The river enters its broad delta approximately 10 miles (16 km) southwest of Kiana. The delta is located in The Hotham Inlet of the Kotzebue Sound approximately 30 miles (48 km) southeast of Kotzebue.Alaska Planning Group, U.S. Department of the Interior. Final Environmental Statement for Proposed Kobuk Valley National Monument, 1973  History  The Kobuk's Inuit name means \\"big river\\". It was first transcribed by John Simpson in 1850 as \\"Kowuk.\\" Explored by Lt. G. M. Stoney, USN, in 1883‚Äì1886, who wrote the name \\"Ku-buck,\\" but proposed that it be called \\"Putnam\\" in honor of Master Charles Putnam, USN, officer of the Rodgers, who was carried to sea on the ice and lost in 1880. Lt. J. C. Cantwell, USRCS, also explored the river in 1884 and 1885 and spelled the name \\"Koowak\\" on his map and \\"Kowak\\" in his text. Ivan Petroff spelled the river name \\"Kooak\\" in 1880, and W. H. Dall spelled it \\"Kowk\\" in 1870. Lt. H. T. Allen, USA, obtained the Koyukon Indian name in 1885 which he spelled \\"Holooatna\\" and \\"Holoatna.\\" Native peoples have hunted, fished, and lived along the Kobuk for at least 12,500 years and it has long been an important transportation route for inland peoples. In 1898 the river was the scene of a brief gold rush called the Kobuk River Stampede, which involved about 2,000 prospectors in total. Hearing of gold along the Kobuk and its tributaries, miners set out from Seattle and San Francisco on ships to reach the mouth of the Kobuk. Upon arrival they were informed by native people that it was a scam, and only about 800 traveled upriver. The result was that little or no gold was found, and only on a few tributaries of the river. In 1980 the United States Congress designated of the river downstream from Walker Lake as the Kobuk Wild and Scenic River as part of the National Wild and Scenic Rivers System. The river is considered an outstanding destination for recreational floating.  Climate  The Kobuk River Basin is located just north of the Arctic Circle and has a continental climate. The summers are short and warm, while winters are long and cold. The mean annual temperature in the middle and upper portions of the Kobuk Valley is -6 ¬∞C, and the mean temperature in July is 15 ¬∞C.Mann, D.H., Heiser, P.A., Finney, B.P, 2002. Holocene history of the Great Kobuk Sand Dunes, Northwestern Alaska. Quaternary Science Reviews, 21 (4-6). 709-731. An average of 21 inches (53 cm) of precipitation falls in the basin. However, actual precipitation can range from 15 to 40 inches (40‚Äì100 cm) with greater amounts falling in the upper reaches of the river basin. The Kobuk River Basin is very sensitive to changes in climate. Arctic climates have warmed at approximately twice the global rate in the last several decades.Anisimov, O.A., D.G. Vaughan, T.V. Callaghan, C. Furgal, H. Marchant, T.D. Prowse, H. Vilhj√°lmsson and J.E. Walsh, 2007: Polar regions (Arctic and Antarctic). Climate Change 2007: Impacts, Adaptation and Vulnerability.

Hanson, Eds., Cambridge University Press, Cambridge, 653-685. Records of air-temperature from 1961 to 1990 logged at the latitudes of the Kobuk River, show a warming trend of about 1.4 ¬∞F (0.78 ¬∞C) per decade. The warming has been the strongest in the winter and spring months. Climate change is presently considered the most severe environmental stress in the Kobuk River Basin and throughout Alaska.National Assessment Synthesis Team, Climate Change Impacts on the United States: The Potential Consequences of Climate Variability and Change, US Global Change Research Program, Washington DC, 2000 As a specific example, climate change will cause widespread thawing of permafrost in the discontinuous zone and significant changes in the continuous zone. Thawing permafrost can lead to a landscape of irregular depressions (thermokarst) due to subsiding soils. This can alter drainage patterns and even change the course of streams; whereas other areas could become swamp-like. In addition, slope stability will decrease and permafrost degradation could lead to erosion of river banks resulting in an increase in sediment transport by the rivers.Koster E.A. & M.E. Nieuwenhuijzen, 1992. Permafrost Response to Climatic Change. Published in Greenhouse-Impact on Cold-Climate Ecosystems and Landscapes, Editors: M. Boer & E. Koster. These physical changes will impact nutrient cycling and biological processes within the basin as well.  Geology and soils  Permafrost regions along the Kobuk River Permafrost regions along the Kobuk River are shown in the accompanying figure.  Geomorphology  Kobuk River west of Kiana, Alaska The Kobuk River is a periglacial river, fed by a remnant glacial lake (Walker Lake) and mountain snowmelt in the Brooks Range. It cuts a channel through a landscape otherwise dominated by permafrost. The Kobuk's current form and structure is a direct result of several stages of erosion and channel formation following the last glacial retreat. As the glacier first retreated and melted, large amounts of highly erodible, fine-grained sediment dropped out in relatively high mountain valleys. The availability of this fine-grained, loose sediment combined with a high gradient to turn a newly forming Kobuk River into a fast-working sediment transport system. The river picked up glacial till from its upper reaches and transported it downstream until the gradient diminished. When the river encountered flatter ground, it deposited its sediment load resulting in the creation of broad, flat floodplains, alluvial fans, and meander bends through aggradation.Ballantyne, Colin K., Paraglacial Geomorphology. Quaternary Science Reviews 21 (2002), p. 1935 - 2017 After the first stage of aggradation and sediment transport, the Kobuk began a new phase of erosion and landform development. The river exhausted its supply of easily erodible sediment upstream, thus decreasing its sediment load and increasing its load carrying capacity downstream. With more capacity downstream, the river began to incise into the alluvial fan it previously created, moving sediment stored for a long time on its original floodplains to newer floodplains even further downstream. Further down in the Kobuk watershed, the river worked in concert with the wind to create one of the more famous landforms in Alaska: the Kobuk Dunes. These large sand dunes are the modern ancestor of alluvial deposits that became shaped and dominated by an exchange of aeolian and fluvial processes.Ashley, Gail and Hamilton, Thomas, Fluvial Response to Late Quaternary Climatic Fluctuations, Central Kobuk Valley, Northwestern Alaska. Journal of Sedimentary Petrology, Vol 63 No. 5, September 1993 pgs 814-827 In moister climates, the river has more water, and thus more power, and cuts down through a sandy bed. In times of drier climate, wind dominates and blows a lot of sediment into a weaker fluvial system, leading to aggradation and floodplain re-distribution. Currently, the Kobuk River in its middle and lower reaches is an anastomizing stream, with several braided channels in places, wide migrating meander bends, and oxbow lakes. It is controlled by yearly cycles of freeze and thaw, much like its surrounding landscape. For six months of the year, the river is largely still, frozen on top by a thick layer of ice. In the spring, warmer temperatures cause this ice to begin to melt. But the resulting process is not gradual. Rather, the pressure of melting ice from upstream builds up upon ice \\"dams\\" in the river's channel, eventually causing an \\"ice break-up\\" event, in which a flood of ice and water moves powerfully downstream. These annual spring break-up events have several important consequences. First, the river has deeply undercut and eroded banks, caused by large, fast-moving chunks of ice carving out the river's channel before it begins spilling out onto its floodplain, which is 1 to 6 miles (1.6-9.7 km) wide except at the confluence of major tributaries. Second, the river moves laterally very quickly and dramatically, re-inventing side channels every year as its secondary streams become drowned in each yearly flood by an overwhelming amount of sediment. Lastly, since the river is surrounded mostly by permafrost and because during the spring break-up event there are still large parts of frozen ground close to its banks, floods often transports large amounts of fine sediment across broad expanses of floodplain in thin sheets of water that slide easily across the frozen ground. These characteristics also translate into a relatively variable habitat for the Kobuk's native species. Farthest west, the Kobuk empties into Hotham Inlet, the easterly arm of Kotzebue Sound. During recent geologic times however, when sea level was lower, the Noatak, Kobuk, and Selawik Rivers were joined. Now, they have separate deltas with many lakes and swamps and intricately webbed channel systems. The deltas are composed primarily of silt, sand, and gravel.  Surface water and hydrology  The Kobuk River is ice covered 6 months of the year and in general, late October to late May is a period of relatively low flow. Annually, the hydrograph reflects two flood peaks: the first is associated with spring break-up and the second, a lesser peak, is associated with late summer precipitation. As the snowpack begins to melt toward the end of May, flow in the Kobuk River increases with most of the runoff occurring during June. Flow during the summer (July through September) is dominated by variable precipitation events. Most of the major tributaries of the Kobuk River flow from the north, draining the mountains in the southern Brooks Range. From east to west, these include the Reed River, Beaver Creek, Mauneluk River, Kogoluktuk River, Shungnak River, Ambler River, Akillik River, Tutuksuk River, Salmon River, and the Squirrel River.Hydrologic Unit Map 1987 - U.S. Department of the Interior Geological Survey Within Kobuk Valley National Park, are the Kallarichuk, Kaliguricheark, and Adillik rivers. All of their headwaters are in the Baird Mountains. The major tributaries flowing north from the Waring Mountains are the Pah River, Pick River, and Niaktuvik Creek. The Pah River drains a lowland area of the basin. Most major tributaries draining high relief areas have higher unit runoff than tributaries draining the lower relief areas. Walker Lake is at an altitude of in the headwaters of the Kobuk River.Jones, J.R. et al., Limnology of Walker Lake and Comparisons with Other Lakes in the Brooks Range, Alaska Final Report NPS/AR-89/21 Other surface water features within the basin include Lake Selby, Nutuvukti Lake, and Norutak Lake. Additionally, numerous small lakes and ponds occur in the lowlands along the river, some formed as detached oxbows of the meandering river and others formed where permafrost has melted and caused depressions. Flow records are available from USGS monitoring stations at Ambler and Kiana. Average annual flow for the Kobuk River at Ambler has ranged from to over the period of record 1966‚Äì78, with peak discharge ranging from to . Near Kiana, average annual flow has ranged from to for the period 1977‚Äì99 with peaks of to . Peak flows can result from large volumes of water released when ice jams fail. Flow records are also available for Dahl Creek, a tributary of the Kobuk River with a confluence near the town of Kobuk.

It was built in the 1960s, and it is approximately 1.5 km southeast of the main commercial area. The site itself is approximately 4.8 km in length, 0.5 km in width at its narrowest point, and covers an area of approximately . Its runway is 3 000 m long. When the airport was built it was on the southern boundary of the city. Ouagadougou has since experienced rapid urbanization and the airport is now surrounded by urban development. Besides having outgrown its capacity constraints, Ouagadougou Airport is a source of pollution and risk. The government has plans for a new airport 30 km north of the capital. In addition to civilian traffic, the airport has a military sector. Ouagadougou Airport handles about 98% of all scheduled commercial air traffic in Burkina Faso. Air Burkina and Air France handle about 60% of scheduled passenger traffic. Between 2005 and 2011, air passenger traffic at Ouagadougou airport grew at an average annual rate of 7.0%, reaching about 404,726 passengers in 2011 and was estimated to reach 850,000 by 2025. In 2007 it was the 15th busiest airport in West Africa in passenger volume, just ahead of Port Harcourt (Nigeria) and behind Banjul (Gambia). The total air cargo grew 71% from 4,350 tons in 2005 to about 7,448 tons in 2009. Airlines and destinations Passenger Cargo Military use The United States military uses the military side of the airport as the hub of its airborne intelligence operations for much of Western Africa. The surveillance operations are carried out mainly with small, unarmed turboprop aircraft disguised as private planes but full of surveillance equipment. The U.S. spy planes fly hundreds of miles north to Mali, Mauritania and the Sahara, where they search for Al-Qaida fighters from the Maghreb. The planes refuel on isolated airstrips favored by African bush pilots, extending their effective flight range by thousands of miles. Ouagadougou is the most important of the approximately dozen air bases that the U.S. established in Africa since 2007. Plans for a new airport The government plans to close the current airport upon construction of the Ouagadougou-Donsin Airport, approximately 35 km northeast of Ouagadougou near the village of Donsin. It was originally expected to be completed around 2018, and the government of Burkina Faso has an $85 million loan from the World Bank to help finance the construction. The government of Burkina Faso believed that the project would cost $618 million. The expected date of opening has been pushed back to December 2021. The first phase of construction of the new airport was planned for a five-year period beginning in 2013 and finishing in 2018. This phase will focus on the construction of infrastructure that is required to move the operations from Ouagadougou to Donsin. The plans call for a single runway 3 500 m long, which is 500 m longer than the one at the current airport, with an option to extend to 4 000 m. Generally 3 000 m is sufficient to land virtually any aircraft at sea level, but longer runways are helpful for heavily loaded cargo planes. Space for a second runway and its accompanying infrastructure has been reserved for when growth in air traffic warrants it. A second expansion phase is planned for 2026‚Äì2030 to meet projected increases in demand. At this stage, however, the government of Burkina Faso is seeking investors only for Phase 1.

The disorder is found in the DSM-IV.DSM-IV, American Psychiatric Association 1994 The condition should not be confused with a sexual desire disorder. The term is often used in the diagnosis of women (female sexual arousal disorder), while the term erectile dysfunction (ED) is often used for men. Signs and symptoms In women, the symptoms of the disorder include: * Lack of vaginal lubrication * Lack of vaginal dilation or lengthening * Decreased genital tumescence or swelling * Decreased genital or nipple sensation However, whether lack of physiological arousal is a reliable symptom of the disorder is questionable. Research has shown that women with arousal deficits and women without arousal deficits show equivalent increases in physiological response during experience of erotic stimuli. Causes Contrary to popular belief, the disorder is not always caused from a lack of sexual arousal. Possible causes of the disorder include psychological and emotional factors, such as depression, anger, and stress; relationship factors, such as conflict or lack of trust; medical factors, such as depleted hormones, reduced regional blood flow, and nerve damage; and drug use. The lack of sexual arousal may be due to a general lack of sexual desire or due to a lack of sexual desire for the current partner (i.e., situational). A person may always have had no or low sexual desire or the lack of desire may have been acquired during the person's life. Certain medications like SSRIs may be a contributing factor. Diagnosis A psychologist will first consider any psychological or emotional problems; while a sex therapist will examine relationship issues; after which a medical doctor will investigate medical causes for the disorder. In order to receive this diagnosis, a woman must, for at least 6 months, report at least 3 of the following symptoms: absent or significantly reduced interest in sexual activity, in sexual or erotic thoughts or fantasies, in initiation of sex or receptiveness to sex, in excitement or pleasure in most sexual encounters, in sexual responsiveness to erotic cues, or in genital or non-genital responses to sexual activity. This can be either lifelong or acquired.Hoeksema, S. (2007). Abnormal psychology (4th ed.). Boston: McGraw-Hill. Treatment Depending on the cause of the disorder, hormone therapy or a blood-flow enhancing medication, like Viagra, may be appropriate.

It was built in 1912 and was designed by Thomas W. Lamb. The theatre was known at various times as the William Fox Audubon Theatre, the Beverly Hills Theater, and the San Juan Theater, and the ballroom is noted for being the site of the assassination of Malcolm X on February 21, 1965. It is currently the Audubon Business and Technology Center and the Shabazz Center. History The Audubon Ballroom was built in 1912 by film producer William Fox, who later founded the Fox Film Corporation. Fox hired Thomas W. Lamb, one of the foremost American theater architects, to design the building. The building contained a theatre with 2500 seats, and a second-floor ballroom that could accommodate 200 seated guests.\\"Audubon Ballroom\\" on the New York Preservation Archive Project website During its history, the Audubon Ballroom was used as a vaudeville house, a movie theater, and a meeting hall where political activists often met. In the 1930s, Congregation Emes Wozedek, a synagogue whose members were predominantly immigrants from Germany, began to use basement rooms of the Audubon Ballroom to conduct its religious services.Lowenstein, Steven M. Frankfurt on the Hudson: The German-Jewish Community of Washington Heights, 1933-1983, Its Structure and Culture (Detroit: Wayne State University Press, 1991) . pp. 109-110 At around the same time, several trade unions, including the Municipal Transit Workers, the IRT Brotherhood Union, and the Transport Workers' Union, utilized the meeting rooms. In 1950, the congregants purchased the building, and they continued to hold services there until 1983.Renner, James, \\"History of WaHI: Audubon Ballroom\\" , Washington Heights & Inwood Online (May 2003) Entrance to the Shabazz Center Among the many events held at the Ballroom was the annual New York Mardi Gras Festival. After Malcolm X left the Nation of Islam in 1964, he founded the Organization of Afro-American Unity (OAAU), whose weekly meetings were held at the Audubon Ballroom. It was at one of those meetings, on February 21, 1965, that Malcolm X was assassinated as he was giving a speech. Because of non-payment of property taxes, New York City took possession of the theatre in 1967. Nevertheless, in the 1960s and 1970s, the Ballroom operated as the San Juan Theater, showing films which catered to the increasingly Hispanic neighborhood. It closed in 1980, and the building remained vacant and the exterior deteriorated. Adaptive reuse In 1989, Columbia University, with the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey as a partner, reached an agreement with the city, and in 1992 it began the process of demolishing the Audubon Ballroom to replace it with a medical research facility. Although many city officials, including Mayor David Dinkins, were strongly in favor of the project because of the jobs and economic impetus it would bring to the area, which had suffered greatly in the economic downturn of the 1970s, community activists and Columbia University students - who occupied Hamilton Hall on campus - protested the planned demolition, and historic preservation groups unsuccessfully sued to prevent it. They were also unable to persuade the New York City Landmarks Preservation Commission to hold a hearing on giving the building landmark status. Eventually a compromise was reached, at least in part due to pressure brought by Manhattan Borough President Ruth Messinger and Malcolm X's widow, Betty Shabazz, who both favored adaptive reuse of the building. They were supported by a report on its structural integrity produced by a pro bono team of architects assembled by the New York Landmarks Conservancy and the Municipal Art Society. The compromise allowed Columbia to build on the northern part of the building their research facility - now the Audubon Business and Technology Center in the Mary Woodard Lasker Biomedical Research Building, part of the Audubon Biomedical Science and Technology Park\\"Fact Sheet\\" on the Audubon Center website a public-private partnership between Columbia University Medical Center and the New York state and city governments. In return, 2/3rds of the Audubon Ballroom's original facade - the part along Broadway and West 165th Street - would be preserved and restored. In addition, a portion of the interior ballroom where Malcolm X was killed was restored and protected,Perry, David C. and Wievel, Wim. The University as Urban Developer: Case Studies and Analysis Lincoln Institute, 2005 pp. 54 ff. to be made into a museum honoring him. Neptune on a ship above the entrance In 2005, the Malcolm X and Dr. Betty Shabazz Memorial and Educational Center opened in the lobby to commemorate the contributions Malcolm X made to the civil rights movement. Architecture Architect Thomas Lamb, who later would design the nearby eclectic United Palace, was an advocate of the use of ornamentation and color on his building's exteriors. He would write: \\"\\"Exotic ornaments, colors and scenes are particularly effective in creating an atmosphere in which the mind is free to frolic and becomes receptive to entertainment.\\". In line with this philosophy, the facade of the Audubon Ballroom presents terra-cotta glazed polychromy, encrustations and cornices. Its ornamentations include brown foxes between the windows on the second floor, intended to flatter Fox,\\"Discovering Northern Manhattan: Guide to Washington Heights and Inwood\\" , Chamber of Commerce of Washington Heights and Inwood and, most prominently, a colorful protruding three-dimensional statue of Neptune on a ship. Alterations to the building in 1996 were made by the architecture firm of Davis Brody Bond, who also designed Columbia University's new building, while the restoration of the facade was handled by preservation specialist Jan Hird Pokorny.

The highway starts at Business US Highway 131 (Bus. US 131) and M-60 in Three Rivers and ends at US Highway 12 (US 12) near Coldwater. In between, it crosses farm country and runs along a section of the Prairie River. Following a highway originally numbered M-7, the roadway was renumbered M-86 in 1940. It has been a part of the state highway system at least since 1927. Two other roadways carried the M-86 designation in the 1920s. Two bridges along the road are eligible for inclusion on the National Register of Historic Places (NRHP). Route description M-86 begins in Three Rivers at a junction with Bus. US 131 and M-60. From there the road travels south out of town on Main Street and across the St. Joseph River. After crossing the river, the highway runs through a residential area of town and turns eastward into rural farm lands. M-86 crosses the Prairie River and follows Burr Oak Street into the community of Centreville. The highway switches to follow Main Street through downtown Centreville; east of downtown, Main Street curves along a bend in the river, and it runs parallel to the river out of town. As part of its support of the state highway system, the Michigan Department of Transportation (MDOT) tracks the traffic levels along the roads it maintains. These traffic counts are expressed in terms of average annual daily traffic (AADT), a calculation of the vehicles using a segment of roadway on a typical day of the year. In 2009, MDOT measured 7,642 vehicles including 138 trucks along M-86 in Centreville, the highest traffic levels along the whole highway. As the highway leaves town, it passes by the north side of Lake Templene, and Sand Lake near Nottawa before meeting M-66. From the junction, M-86 and M-66 run concurrently to the north for about , at which point M-86 branches off to the east while M-66 continues on a northerly route. M-86 continues east through agricultural land into the village of Colon. The highway follows South Street and turns north on Blackstone Avenue between Sturgeon and Palmer lakes. Turning to follow State Street, the trunkline heads out of the village to the southeast. It continues eastward along Colon Road, passing north of Matteson Lake near Matteson and through Batavia Center. In Coldwater Township, M-86 experienced its lowest traffic level in 2009 at 1,872 vehicles and 129 trucks AADT. The highway terminates at US 12 west of Coldwater near the Branch County Memorial Airport and Messenger Lake. No segment of M-86 has been listed on the National Highway System, a system of roads important to the nation's economy, defense, and mobility. History Previous designations December 1, 1927 state highway map showing M-86 Upon its inception in 1921, a very different M-86 was routed along a portion of present-day M-66 from M-46 at Six Lakes northward to Remus, ending at M-24 (modern M-20). A few years later in 1924‚Äì25, M-66 was extended north to Remus, supplanting the contemporary M-86. At the same time, the M-86 designation was relocated to Ionia County to run from M-44 in Orleans to M-43 (present day M-66) just east of there. In late 1929, M-44 was extended east from Orleans to junction with M-43, once again, causing M-86 to be supplanted and removed from the highway system. Current designation By the end of 1927, the Michigan State Highway Department (MSHD) had designated a highway numbered M-7 between Three Rivers and Centreville. This highway was extended east by the middle of 1936. The route connected US 131 in downtown Three Rivers to US 112 outside Coldwater. At the time of the extension, all of M-7 was a gravel road. Later that year, the original segment between Three Rivers and Colon was paved, and the state extended the hard-surface route as far as Nottawa in 1937. In 1940, at the same time all single-digit highway numbers were renumbered in the state, the M-86 designation replaced M-7. This incarnation of M-86 followed its present-day routing. Near Nottawa, M-86 ran concurrently with the contemporary M-78 north and east to Colon. In late 1948 or early 1949, the last section of highway was paved in Branch County, hard-surfacing all of M-86 for the first time. A change related to M-66 and M-78 altered M-86 in 1965. South of Battle Creek, M-66 replaced M-78. Rather than follow M-78 between Colon and Athens, M-66 used a different series of roads. The net result was that along M-86, the M-78 concurrency was replaced by a shorter M-66 concurrency. The routing has remain unchanged since. Historic bridges M-86 currently uses one bridge eligible for listing on the NRHP. The span over the St. Joseph River in Three Rivers was built in 1903. It is a five-span concrete arch bridge constructed to look as though created from stacked masonry blocks. The current railings were added in 1952 by the MSHD during a repair project. The second historic structure was the bridge over the Prairie River in Centreville. This camelback pony truss span was moved to that location in 1938‚Äì39, although it was originally built on an unknown location in 1923. In the move, two sidewalks, one on either side of the trusses, were eliminated from the structure. This project was part of Public Works Administration relief work in the area. The structure was moved to Crystal Springs Road in Cass County's Pokagon Township in 2016.

It is almost flawless and is unusual in that it has stars on both sides of the stone. The greyish blue gem was mined in Sri Lanka and is housed in the American Museum of Natural History in New York City. The milky quality of the stone is caused by the traces of the mineral rutile, which is also responsible for the star effect, known as asterism. The tiny fibers of the mineral, aligned in a three-fold pattern within the gem, reflect incoming light into the star pattern.  History  Mineralogist and Tiffany gem expert George Kunz (1856‚Äì1932) was commissioned by wealthy financier J.P. Morgan (1837‚Äì1913) to acquire an impressive gem collection for an exhibit at the Paris Exposition of 1900; the Star of India was among the stones Kunz procured. The Star of India is a huge, blue, star sapphire weighing 563.35 carats. It is cut as a cabochon. A British Army officer brought it to London, where it was cut by Albert Ramsay around 1905. Morgan donated the Star of India along with the rest of the collection to the American Museum of Natural History. Apart from its Sri Lankan origin, the gem's history prior to its acquisition for this collection is unknown. Kunz wrote in 1913 that the Star of India \\"has a more or less indefinite historic record of some three centuries\\". On October 29, 1964, the famous golf-ball- sized stone was stolen, along with several other gems of note, including the Midnight Star, the DeLong Star Ruby, and the Eagle Diamond. The thieves unlocked a bathroom window during museum open hours, climbed in that night, and found that the sapphire was the only gem in the collection protected by an alarm‚Äîand the battery for that was dead. The stones stolen were valued at more than $400,000. Within two days the culprits were arrested: Jack Murphy (also known as \\"Murph the Surf\\"), Allen Kuhn and Roger Clark; however, the gems had already been handed off. In January 1965, in a bid for leniency, Kuhn led authorities to a bus locker in Miami where the uninsured Star of India and some of the other stolen stones were recovered.

Before the 1993 federal election in Canada, Parti Qu√©b√©cois (PQ) leader Jacques Parizeau evoked a strategy for attainment of Quebec independence called the Three Periods. The strategy is partly inspired by the three periods of play in ice hockey (the most popular sport in Quebec). It is seen as a typical Parizeau concept: dedicated and straightforward, especially compared to some sovereigntist attitudes like a few (not all) of Ren√© L√©vesque's (specifically in the last years of his government) or to the √©tapisme or \\"step-by-step\\" strategy. The Three Periods Strategy First period * The election of a great number of candidates from the recently founded Bloc Qu√©b√©cois in Ottawa for 1993 federal election. ** It was achieved: the Bloc sent 54 Member of Parliament (MPs) to the House of Commons of Canada and became the Official Opposition. Parizeau and the PQ publicly supported the Bloc campaign. Second period * The election of a Parti Qu√©b√©cois government in Quebec for the 1994 Quebec election. ** It was achieved: 77 PQ Members of the National Assembly (MNAa) were elected to the National Assembly of Quebec, won a majority government and received a plurality (although slimmer than expected) in popular vote. Third period * The calling and victory of a second referendum on sovereignty for Quebec. ** It failed: the referendum was indeed called in 1995 with 49.42% in favour. Controversy over the nature of the referendum led to the Clarity Act of 2000. Resurgence After the plummeting popularity of the newly elected federalist Quebec government in 2003-2004, the sponsorship scandal, the Bloc's renewed popularity for the 2004 federal elections and the rise in support for sovereignty (49% in April 2004), some evoked the return of a new three part plan. Pauline Marois even wrote an article for the Saison des id√©es in 2004 in favour of establishing a four period plan.

Also a component of the State Trunkline Highway System, the freeway connects I-96 to the downtown area. It has been named the R.E. Olds Freeway (sometimes just Olds Freeway) for Ransom E. Olds, the founder of Oldsmobile and the REO Motor Car Company. I-496 runs east‚Äìwest from I-96/I-69 near the downtown area and north‚Äìsouth along a section that runs concurrently with US Highway 127 (US 127). The trunkline also passes a former assembly plant used by Oldsmobile and runs along or crosses parts of the Grand and Red Cedar rivers. Construction of I-496 started in 1963, and the freeway opened on December 18, 1970. Segments of the freeway south of downtown Lansing were built in the location of a historically black neighborhood. This neighborhood was formed based on the segregationist practices of the early 20th century. Community leaders worked for different housing opportunities for the black residents displaced by I-496 rather than fight the freeway. As the trunkline neared completion, competing proposals to name it resulted in two similar, but separate designations applied to I-496. The city originally approved one name in honor of a former mayor. The local historical society proposed that the state name it as a memorial to Olds after the demolition of the Olds Mansion. The city renamed it the Oldsmobile Expressway, the name under which it opened in December 1970. Two years later, the Michigan Legislature restored its preferred name and it has been the Olds Freeway since. Route description I-496 starts at an interchange with I-96/I-69 at that freeway's exit 95 in Delta Township in Eaton County. The freeway runs eastward through suburban areas of the township adjacent to some residential subdivisions. Continuing eastward, there is an interchange for Creyts Road before I-496 angles to the northeast. At the interchange with Waverly Road, I-496 crosses into Ingham County. The freeway then runs parallel to the Grand River. Near a partial interchange with Lansing Road (old US 27), the freeway gains a pair of service drives: St. Joseph Street runs one-way westbound on the north side, and Malcolm X Street runs eastbound to the south. The next interchange is for the connection to the Capitol Loop and M-99, both of which run along Martin Luther King Jr. Boulevard. The Capitol Loop, also internally numbered Connector 496, is a signed connector that provides access to various state government buildings like the Michigan State Capitol. South of this interchange, M-99 connects to the Lansing Car Assembly plant, a former facility for Oldsmobile. alt=Photograph of Continuing eastward, I-496 passes north of the assembly plant complex and south of the central business district. East of a partial interchange with Walnut Street, the freeway passes the Michigan Women's Hall of Fame, which is located on I-496's southern service drive. The south side of the freeway is adjacent to Cooley Gardens near the confluence of the Grand and Red Cedar rivers. I-496 crosses the Grand River downstream from the confluence and meets the eastern terminus of the Capitol Loop. This interchange with Cedar and Larch streets is also a connection to Business Loop I-96 (BL I-96) and Pennsylvania Avenue. St. Joseph Street ends after the connection to Pennsylvania Avenue. The main freeway crosses a rail line owned by CSX Transportation. I-496 runs parallel to the north side of the rail line while Malcolm X Street follows to the south as far as the Clemens Avenue overpass. The freeway then crosses into East Lansing near the Red Cedar Natural Area. After crossing the city line, I-496 turns southward and merges with US 127\\\\. The two highways run concurrently, and they cross a line of the Canadian National Railway. The freeway runs along the western edge of the campus of Michigan State University. South of campus, I-496/US 127 crosses back into Lansing and has an interchange with Jolly Road before entering Delhi Township. About two-thirds of a mile (1.1 km) south of Jolly Road, I-496 meets I-96 and terminates; US 127 continues southward as a freeway toward Jackson. alt=Photograph of Like other state highways in Michigan, I-496 is maintained by the Michigan Department of Transportation (MDOT). In 2011, the department's traffic surveys showed that on average, 61,082 vehicles used the freeway between BL I-96 and the Trowbridge Road interchange south of US 127, the highest traffic count along I-496. West of Creyts Road, 17,600 vehicles did so each day, which was the lowest count along the trunkline. As an Interstate Highway, all of I-496 is listed on the National Highway System, a network of roads deemed important to the country's economy, defense, and mobility. History alt=Black and white map An east‚Äìwest freeway was originally planned as an Interstate Highway allowing traffic to access downtown Lansing in the 1955 General Location of National System of Interstate Highways (Yellow Book), an early proposal for what would become the Interstate Highway System. As originally proposed by the Michigan State Highway Department in 1958, the freeway was to be called I-296. The department was waiting on approval of a final numbering scheme the next year, before the first Interstates were signed in the state in 1959. By the time construction started on the Lansing freeway, it was numbered I-496. The section near downtown was to be built through a historically African-American neighborhood. The neighborhood was formed through \\"unwritten rules of segregation\\" as real estate agents and mortgage brokers guided black residents to the area when they were looking to buy homes. When the state and federal governments were planning the freeway, the area was chosen for the path of I-496. The neighborhood boasted a community center and several businesses that catered to the black population of Lansing, including the only record store that sold rhythm and blues music. Community leaders did not fight the freeway and instead lobbied for affordable housing and relocation assistance. The construction spurred integration of blacks into the wider community; some were able to move into neighborhoods previously closed to them, purchasing \\"newer houses near better schools.\\" In total, the construction of the freeway required the demolition or removal of nearly 600 homes, 60 businesses, and 15 farms. The first section of I-496 was opened in December 1963, and ran from I-96 northerly to M-43/M-78 (Saginaw and Kalamazoo streets) between Lansing and East Lansing. The freeway, comprising the southern two-thirds, was designated I-496/M-78/BL I-96 while the northern portion was on city streets as M-78/BL I-96. Some 50 men completed the work by year's end; they went entirely without vacation time to accomplish the feat. Another section of freeway was opened in 1966, and US 127 was rerouted to follow I-496/M-78. BL I-96 was removed from I-496/US 127/M-78 and routed along the former US 127. The freeway segment north of the Trowbridge Road interchange continuing northward as part of US 127 was opened in 1969. Another section opened at the same time was the western section from I-96 to Lansing Road (then US 27) in 1969. The remaining section between M-99 (then Logan Street, now Martin Luther King Jr. Boulevard) and I-496/US 127 opened on December 18, 1970, completing construction. The freeway underwent a $42.4 million reconstruction (equivalent to $ in ) between April and November 2001 which included the rehabilitation or reconstruction of 35 bridges, of freeway, and the addition of a weave-merge lane between Pennsylvania Avenue and US 127. Speed limits were raised along I-496 from in 2007 to reflect the speeds motorists were driving during studies conducted by MDOT and the Michigan State Police. alt=Black and white photograph The name applied to the freeway was not without controversy. The Lansing City Council named it in September 1966 after Ralph W. Crego, a former city council member and the longest-serving mayor in the city's history. The Historical Society of Greater Lansing wanted it named the \\"R.E. Olds Expressway\\", in part because the new road brought about the demolition of the Olds Mansion, which was listed on the National Register of Historic Places, and to \\"recogniz[e] the contributions of R.E. Olds to the industries of the city.\\" The society approached the Michigan Legislature, which introduced House Resolution 48 in February 1970 using the historical society's preferred name. The city council realized that they had been bypassed and conveniently discovered that their original resolution was not \\"formally adopted\\". They named a park for Crego instead in October 1970 and adopted a resolution to name I-496 the \\"Oldsmobile Expressway\\". The Legislature approved its resolution resulting in two names, one for the founder of the car company, and one for the company itself. The council member who introduced the city's resolution criticized the Legislature for taking action without consultation. The state resolution was intercepted before it could be sent to the Michigan Department of State Highways, and the freeway opened on December 18, 1970, with the \\"Oldsmobile Expressway\\" name. On August 21, 1972, during the celebrations for the 75th anniversary of Oldsmobile, Senate Concurrent Resolution 345 renamed I-496 the \\"R.E. Olds Freeway\\". Exit list Related trunkline The Capitol Loop is a state trunkline highway running through Lansing that was commissioned on October 13, 1989. It forms a loop route off I-496 through downtown near the Michigan State Capitol complex, home of the state legislature and several state departments. However, unlike other business loops in Michigan, it has unique reassurance markers‚Äîthe signs that serve as regular reminders of the name and number of the highway. It is known internally at MDOT as Connector 496 for inventory purposes. The highway follows a series of one-way and two-way streets through downtown Lansing, directing traffic downtown to the State Capitol and other government buildings. Unlike the other streets downtown, the seven streets composing the Capitol Loop are under state maintenance and jurisdiction. The loop was originally proposed in 1986 as part of a downtown revitalization effort. Almost from the beginning before the highway was commissioned in 1989, it was affected by controversial proposals. The first was related to suggestions by community leaders to rename city streets in honor of Martin Luther King Jr. Another controversy dealt with rebuilding the streets as part of a downtown beautification project; the downtown business community protested the original scope of construction, and the Lansing City Council threatened to cancel the project in response to the controversy. In 2010, additional controversies surfaced regarding the posting and enforcement of speed limits on city streets in Michigan, including the streets that make up the Capitol Loop.

Riconosciuto professed a defense centered on the Inslaw Affair (a legal case in which the U.S. Government was charged with illegal use of computer software). Riconosciuto claimed to have reprogrammed Inslaw's case-management program (Promis) with a secret \\"back-door\\" to allow clandestine tracking of individuals. Riconosciuto stated that he had been threatened with prosecution by a justice department official. Riconosciuto provided an Affidavit detailing threats to a House Select Committee investigating the Inslaw Affair. In his investigation of the allegations surrounding the Inslaw case, Special Counsel Nicholas J. Bua was particularly critical of several of Inslaw's witnesses. He found that Riconosciuto had given inconsistent accounts in statements to the Hamiltons, his affidavit, and in testimony at his 1992 trial for manufacturing methamphetamine.Bua report, pp. 49-53 Bua compared Riconosciuto's story about Promis to \\"a historical novel; a tale of total fiction woven against the background of accurate historical facts.\\"Bua report, p. 72. 1970s Early background Riconoscuito has demonstrated some technical and scientific talents. According to an article originally published in the Village Voice: Riconosciuto was employed as an engineer at a mine in Maricopa, California. Hercules Properties, Ltd. had raised financing and purchased a contaminated waste-disposal site which had once been a portion of a TNT and fertilizer manufacturer known as Hercules Powder Works, and which was located along San Pablo Bay in Contra Costa County, California. (\\"The community of Hercules, named for the factory, is still recognized by its rusting tanks and smoke stacks.\\") 1980s Iran Riconosciuto stated in 1993 that he had knowledge of the October Surprise conspiracy allegations. (see: subsection \\"Earl W. Brian‚ÄîThe Consummate Insider: What a Surprise\\", p. 8) Cabazon Nathan Baca's Emmy winning series \\"The Octopus Murders\\" featured documents from the archives of Michael Riconosciuto. These documents have been the subject of interest for recently reopened cold case homicide investigations. 1990s Inslaw In early 1991, Riconosciuto filed an affidavit before a House judiciary committee investigating the bankruptcy case of Inslaw Inc. v. United States Government. Riconosciuto was called to testify before Congress regarding the modification of PROMIS, a case-management software program that had been developed for the Department of Justice by Washington, D.C.-based Inslaw Inc.. Riconosciuto declared that he had been under the direction of Earl Brian, who was then a controlling shareholder and director of Hadron, Inc..

During his trial, Riconosciuto accused the Drug Enforcement Administration of stealing two copies of his tape. Then later he claimed a third was tossed by him into a Washington State swamp. In addition to his claims of a government \\"frame up\\" related to Inslaw, Riconosciuto maintained that the chemical laboratory on his property was in use for the extraction of precious metals such as platinum in a highly specialized mining operation. No drug-lab contamination was found at the laboratory site and a member of the DOE's Hazardous Spill Response Team asserted that high barium levels on the property were unlikely to be the result of Riconosciuto's work. Barium does have specialized usage for metallurgy with regards to the processing of platinum group metals.

It was discovered in 1958 during research on local anesthetics by MacFarlan Smith of Edinburgh, Scotland, and registered under the trademark Bitrex. Dilutions of as little as 10 ppm are unbearably bitter to most humans. Denatonium salts are usually colorless and odorless solids but are often traded as solutions. They are used as aversive agents (bitterants) to prevent inappropriate ingestion. Denatonium is used in denatured alcohol, antifreeze, preventive nail biting preparations, respirator mask fit-testing, animal repellents, liquid soaps, shampoos, and even Nintendo Switch game cards to prevent accidental swallowing or choking by children. It is not known to pose any long-term health risks. The name denatonium is a portmanteau word reflecting the substance's primary use as a denaturant and its chemical nature as a cation, whence the New Latin suffix -onium.  Structure and physical properties  Denatonium is a quaternary ammonium cation. It is a compound of a salt with an inert anion like benzoate or saccharide. The structure of denatonium is related to the local anesthetic lidocaine, differing only by the addition of a benzyl group to the amino nitrogen. Other similar compounds are procaine and benzocaine. One of the chemical names for the compound is lidocaine benzylbenzoate, although denatonium only denotes the quaternary ammonium cation species itself, and does not necessitate the benzoate counterion.  Biochemistry  Denatonium in humans is recognized by eight distinct bitter taste receptors: TAS2R4, TAS2R8, TAS2R10, TAS2R39, TAS2R43, TAS2R16, TAS2R46, TAS2R47, with TAS2R47 being by far the most sensitive to the compound. Denatonium can act as a bronchodilator by activating bitter taste receptors in the airway smooth muscle.  Applications  The bitterness of the compound guides most applications of denatonium. Denatonium benzoate is used to denature ethanol so that it is not treated as an alcoholic beverage with respect to taxation and sales restrictions. One designation in particular, SD-40B, indicates that ethanol has been denatured using denatonium benzoate. Denatonium is commonly included in placebo medications used in clinical trials to mimic the bitter taste of certain medications. Denatonium also discourages consumption of harmful alcohols like methanol, and additives like ethylene glycol. Denatonium is used in rubbing alcohol as an inactive ingredient. It is also added to many kinds of harmful liquids including solvents (such as nail polish remover), paints, varnishes, toiletries and other personal care items, special nail polish for preventing nail biting, and various other household products. It is also added to less hazardous aerosol products (such as gas dusters) to discourage inhalant abuse of the volatile vapors. In 1995, the U.S. state of Oregon required that denatonium benzoate be added to products containing sweet-tasting ethylene glycol and methanol such as antifreeze and windshield washer fluid to prevent poisonings of children and animals. In December 2012, U.S. manufacturers voluntarily agreed to add denatonium benzoate to antifreeze sold nationwide. Animals are known to have different sensitivities to the effects of denatonium. It is used in some animal repellents (especially for such large mammals as deer). It has been used to safeguard rat poisons from human consumption, as humans are able to detect denatonium at much lower concentrations than rodents.Frank ME, Bouverat BP, MacKinnon BI, Hettinger TP. The distinctiveness of ionic and nonionic bitter stimuli. Physiol Behav. 2004 Jan;80(4):421-31. The repulsive taste of denatonium can be used as a deterrent on products not designed for consumption, and/or are harmful upon consumption. Famously, the Nintendo Switch game cards are coated in denatonium benzoate to prevent young children from consuming them.

He is known for, amongst other things, his contributions to the Thue‚ÄìSiegel‚ÄìRoth theorem in Diophantine approximation and the Siegel mass formula for quadratic forms. He was named as one of the most important mathematicians of the 20th century.P√©rez, R. A. (2011) A brief but historic article of Siegel, NAMS 58(4), 558‚Äì566. Andr√© Weil, without hesitation, named Siegel as the greatest mathematician of the first half of the 20th century. Atle Selberg said of Siegel and his work: Biography Siegel was born in Berlin, where he enrolled at the Humboldt University in Berlin in 1915 as a student in mathematics, astronomy, and physics. Amongst his teachers were Max Planck and Ferdinand Georg Frobenius, whose influence made the young Siegel abandon astronomy and turn towards number theory instead. His best student was J√ºrgen Moser, one of the founders of KAM theory (Kolmogorov‚ÄìArnold‚ÄìMoser), which lies at the foundations of chaos theory. Another notable student was Kurt Mahler, the number theorist. Siegel was an antimilitarist, and in 1917, during World War I he was committed to a psychiatric institute as a conscientious objector. According to his own words, he withstood the experience only because of his support from Edmund Landau, whose father had a clinic in the neighborhood. After the end of World War I, he enrolled at the University of G√∂ttingen, studying under Landau, who was his doctoral thesis supervisor (Ph.D. in 1920). He stayed in G√∂ttingen as a teaching and research assistant; many of his groundbreaking results were published during this period. In 1922, he was appointed professor at the Johann Wolfgang Goethe-Universit√§t of Frankfurt am Main as the successor of Arthur Moritz Sch√∂nflies. Siegel, who was deeply opposed to Nazism, was a close friend of the docents Ernst Hellinger and Max Dehn and used his influence to help them. This attitude prevented Siegel's appointment as a successor to the chair of Constantin Carath√©odory in Munich.Freddy Litten: Die Carath√©odory-Nachfolge in M√ºnchen (1938‚Äì1944) In Frankfurt he took part with Dehn, Hellinger, Paul Epstein, and others in a seminar on the history of mathematics, which was conducted at the highest level. In the seminar they read only original sources. Siegel's reminiscences about the time before World War II are in an essay in his collected works. In 1936 he was a Plenary Speaker at the ICM in Oslo. In 1938, he returned to G√∂ttingen before emigrating in 1940 via Norway to the United States, where he joined the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton, where he had already spent a sabbatical in 1935. He returned to G√∂ttingen only after World War II, when he accepted a post as professor in 1951, which he kept until his retirement in 1959. In 1968 he was elected a foreign associate of the U.S. National Academy of Sciences. Career Siegel's work on number theory, diophantine equations, and celestial mechanics in particular won him numerous honours. In 1978, he was awarded the first Wolf Prize in Mathematics, one of the most prestigious in the field. When the prize committee decided to select the greatest living mathematician, the discussion centered around Siegel and Israel Gelfand as the leading candidates. The prize was ultimately split between them. Siegel's work spans analytic number theory; and his theorem on the finiteness of the integer points of curves, for genus > 1, is historically important as a major general result on diophantine equations, when the field was essentially undeveloped. He worked on L-functions, discovering the (presumed illusory) Siegel zero phenomenon. His work, derived from the Hardy‚ÄìLittlewood circle method on quadratic forms, appeared in the later, adele group theories encompassing the use of theta-functions. The Siegel modular varieties, which describe Siegel modular forms, are recognised as part of the moduli theory of abelian varieties. In all this work the structural implications of analytic methods show through. In the early 1970s Weil gave a series of seminars on the history of number theory prior to the 20th century and he remarked that Siegel once told him that when the first person discovered the simplest case of Faulhaber's formula then, in Siegel's words, \\"Es gefiel dem lieben Gott.\\" (It pleased the dear Lord.) Siegel was a profound student of the history of mathematics and put his studies to good use in such works as the Riemann‚ÄìSiegel formula.

The stannary law (derived from the for tin) is the body of English law that governs tin mining in Devon and Cornwall; although no longer of much practical relevance, the stannary law remains part of the law of the United Kingdom and is arguably the oldest law incorporated into the English legal system.http://thisisnotengland.co.uk/history/cornwall- background.htmlPennington, Robert R. (1973). Stannary Law. David and Charles, Newton Abbot. The stannary law's complexity and comprehensive reach into the lives of tin miners necessitated the existence of the legislative Stannary Convocations of Devon and Cornwall, the judicial Courts of the Vice-Warden of the Stannaries, and the executive Lord Warden of the Stannaries. The separate and powerful government institutions available to the tin miners reflected the enormous importance of the tin industry to the English economy during the Middle Ages. Special laws for tin miners pre-date written legal codes in Britain, and ancient traditions exempted everyone connected with tin mining in Cornwall and Devon from any jurisdiction other than the stannary courts in all but the most exceptional circumstances.  Stannary Convocation of Devon  Edward I's 1305 Stannary Charter established Tavistock, Ashburton and Chagford as Devon's stannary towns, with a monopoly on all tin mining in Devon, a right to representation in the Stannary Parliament and a right to the jurisdiction of the stannary courts. Plympton became the fourth Devon stannary town in 1307. The parliament consisted of ninety-six jurates, with twenty-four being chosen by each of the four Devon stannaries. The jurates were chosen at special courts held in each stannary by \\"tinners\\": a term broad enough to include not just miners and tin work owners, but others concerned with the tin industry.G.R. Lewis, The Stannaries, a study of the medieval tin miners of Cornwall and Devon (1908). (11 Mb PDF document) The Parliament usually met in an open air forum at Crockern Tor. The last convocation of the Devon Parliament was in 1786,Greeves, T 1987 'The Great Courts or Parliaments of the Devon Tinners' Rep Trans Devonshire Ass 119, 143-66 but as late as the 1980s, an honorary stannator would be named whenever a new tin mine was opened.  Cornish Stannary Parliament  A charter of King John had given the tin miners of Cornwall certain legal rights which were confirmed by King Edward I in 1305. They had the rights of \\"bounding\\" (prospecting for and working tin ore deposits), of trial before their own stannary court, and of exemption from ordinary taxation. The stannaries were: Foweymore (district of Bodmin Moor), Blackmore (district of St Austell); Tywarnhayle (district of St Agnes and Carn Brea); and Kerrier and Penwith (district between Godolphin and Land's End). The courts were normally held every three weeks and presided over by the steward who had been appointed by the warden of the stannaries. As there are no extant records before the 16th century the court procedure is unknown; if tinners were compelled to appear before another court they could insist that half the jury be tinners.Halliday, F. E. (1959) A History of Cornwall. London: Gerald Duckworth; p. 132 The privileges of the stannaries of Cornwall were confirmed by Edward III on the creation of the Duchy of Cornwall in 1337. This confirmed that the tin miners were exempt from all civil jurisdiction other than that of the Stannary Courts, except in cases affecting land, life or limb. There was at this period no definition of the districts of each stannary.Hatcher, John (1970) Rural Economy and Society in the Duchy of Cornwall 1300-1500. Cambridge University Press (includes on p. xiv a map of the districts) The Cornish stannaries were suspended in 1496, the year before the Cornish Rebellion of 1497. (See entry for 1497.) Henry VII restored them in return for a payment from the tin miners of the sum, enormous at the time, of ¬£1,000, to support his war on Scotland. In addition to restoring the stannaries and pardoning the people who participated in the rebellion, Henry's Charter of Pardon, 1508 provided that no new laws affecting miners should be enacted without the consent of 24 stannators, six being chosen from each of the four stannaries: *Foymore (or Foweymore): chosen by the mayor and corporation of Lostwithiel *Blackmore: by the mayor and corporation of LauncestonThe Blackmore Stannary, centred at Hensbarrow Beacon, kept its records stored in the church of Luxulyan. *Tywarnhaile (or Tynwarnhail): by the mayor and corporation of Truro *Penwith and Kerrier: by the mayor and corporation of Helston The stannators were described in 1831 as being \\"some of the principal gentlemen of the mining district\\". On assembly the stannators elected a speaker, the meeting being termed a Stannary Parliament. The parliaments were convened occasionally by the Lord Warden of the Stannaries when it was felt that laws concerning the miner's rights needed to be made or revised. The Cornish Stannary Parliament last assembled at Truro in 1752, and continued until 11 September 1753.Lewis, Samuel (1831) Topographical Dictionary of England, volume I In 1977, responding by letter to a written question in the House of Commons from Plaid Cymru MP Dafydd Wigley to the Attorney-General for England and Wales, Lord Chancellor Lord Elwyn-Jones said he could find no record of the charter having been formally amended or withdrawn but also noted academic opinion that \\"no doubt has ever been expressed about Parliament's power to enact legislation for the stannaries without the need to obtain the consent of Convocation\\".In 1978 Dafydd Wigley deposited his papers regarding this in the National Library of Wales, Aberystwyth. In March 2007, Bridget Prentice, Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State in the Ministry of Justice, stated in a Commons written answer that \\"there are no valid Cornish stannary organisations in existence\\" and that there \\"are no treaties today that apply to Cornwall only\\". Stannary courts The Devon stannary courts met in Lydford and operated a prison there, while the Cornish stannary courts met primarily in Truro. The Devon and Cornwall stannary courts were merged into a single Stannaries Court following the Stannaries Act 1855, but their powers were later transferred to county authorities by the Stannaries Court (Abolition) Act 1896. The relations between the stannaries and Westminster were discussed in Strode's Case (1512).  Mining courts and customs in other counties  While the stannaries of Devon and Cornwall had the most developed legal systems, a number of other mining communities had similar privileges. The customs of the community were usually confirmed by charter, with the miners having the right to seek for minerals in all areas other than tilled fields, subject to paying taxes to the Crown. Examples included: *Gloucestershire: The Free Miners of coal and iron of the Forest of Dean had their customs confirmed by charter attributed to Edward I, with a miner's court to try cases between the miners, and a miner's parliament. *Derbyshire: The hundreds of High Peak and Wirksworth (an area known as the \\"King's Field\\") were divided into eight \\"liberties\\" for the purposes of lead mining, and disputes were heard in the barmote courts. *Somerset: The customs of the lead-mining district of the Mendip Hills were encoded under Edward IV. Two courts, consisting of twelve miners, were held annually to enforce the code. *Cumberland: The lead miners of Alston Moor enjoyed legal privileges from the thirteenth century. By the reign of Henry V there was in existence a court of mines, and the miners elected a coroner and bailiff, with the king's officers having no authority to serve writs in the area.  Present day  Some Cornish political activists claim to have revived the Stannary Parliament since 1974, along with the right to veto British legislation. Indeed, it purports to have actually vetoed acts passed by the Parliament of the United Kingdom, although has been unable to enforce this. On 12 December 1974 the Home Office replied to letters from the members of this revived parliament, saying that the Home Office could only accept elections by the stannary towns as constitutive of a valid stannary parliament. However, the stannaries were not abolished, and the Home Office has made no effort to hold these elections. The Revived Cornish Stannary Parliament is driven primarily by Cornish nationalism and demands for greater local autonomy, along with arguments about the constitutional status of Cornwall.

Spanning approximately along a northwest‚Äìsoutheast axis, the turnpike is in two sections. The SR 91 mainline runs roughly , from its southern terminus at an interchange with Interstate 95 (I-95) in Miami Gardens to an interchange with I-75 in Wildwood at its northern terminus. The Homestead Extension of Florida's Turnpike (abbreviated HEFT and designated as unsigned SR 821) continues from the southern end of the mainline for another to US Highway 1 (US 1) in Florida City. The slogan for the road is \\"The Less Stressway\\". The mainline opened in stages between 1957 and 1964, while the extension was completed in 1974. The turnpike runs through Miami, Fort Lauderdale, and West Palm Beach, where it parallels I-95, and through Orlando, where it crosses I-4. Route description Miami to Ft. Pierce The main section of Florida's Turnpike begins at the northern end of the Golden Glades Interchange in Miami Gardens as a six-lane highway, and passes through the Golden Glades Toll Barrier, a cashless toll point, similar to the ones on the HEFT. About north of the toll gantry, it passes by Hard Rock Stadium, home to the Miami Dolphins of the National Football League, to the west before intersecting with the northern end of the HEFT at the Miami-Dade/Broward County line from Golden Glades, continuing the HEFT's mile marker. The highway goes through the inland suburbs of Miramar, Hollywood, and Davie, with an exit at Hollywood Boulevard (SR 820) at mile 50, and passing west of the Seminole Hard Rock Hotel and Casino Hollywood just south the Griffin Road (SR 818) interchange (exit 53). In Davie, about north of the Homestead Extension interchange, it intersects with I-595, providing direct access to Alligator Alley and Ft. Lauderdale International Airport. After two more interchanges, one with Sunrise Boulevard (SR 838) in Plantation and Commercial Boulevard (SR 870) in Tamarac, it crosses the Cypress Creek Toll Plaza in North Lauderdale, the second on the mainline. Just north of the toll plaza, it intersects with the Pompano Beach Service Plaza, the first of seven full-service plazas on the mainline, and where the Turnpike's operations center is located. Still in Pompano Beach, it has a northbound-only exit (and southbound-only entrance) at Atlantic Boulevard (SR 814), followed by full interchanges with Coconut Creek Parkway/Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. Boulevard (County Road 912) (exit 67) and Sample Road (SR 834) (exit 69). It then enters Deerfield Beach with an interchange with the Sawgrass Expressway in Coconut Creek (exit 71), the final interchange in Broward County. The Turnpike then enters Palm Beach County, with one interchange each in Boca Raton (Glades Road, exit 75), Delray Beach (Atlantic Avenue, exit 81) and Boynton Beach (Boynton Beach Boulevard, exit 86). In central Palm Beach County at mile marker 88, the ticket system of the turnpike begins at the Lantana Toll Plaza. The turnpike narrows to a four-lane highway as it goes through a less developed portion of Palm Beach County, crossing interchanges with Lake Worth Road, followed by the Lake Worth/West Palm Beach Service Plaza at mile marker 94. In West Palm Beach, the highway has interchanges with US 98/SR 80 (Southern Boulevard), a SunPass-only interchange at Jog Road, followed by an interchange at Okeechobee Boulevard (exit 99) that heads directly into downtown West Palm Beach. North of the interchange, the highway enters stretch of sparse development between this point and Port St. Lucie, intersecting with the Beeline Highway, another SunPass only interchange before leaving West Palm Beach. Just north of the SR 786 interchange in Palm Beach Gardens (exit 109), I-95 parallels the Turnpike to the east for about , with I-95 visible from the turnpike as it has an interchange with SR 706 (exit 116) in Jupiter and into Martin County. It breaks off as it crosses the Thomas B. Manuel Bridge over the St. Lucie Canal, crossing I-95 without an interchange just south of the SR 714 interchange, the only exit in Martin County. I-95 heads west towards the western fringes of St. Lucie County development, while the turnpike takes a path through the central areas of the county. The turnpike has two interchanges in Port St. Lucie, one at Becker Road (exit 138), the third SunPass-only exit, and SR 716 (exit 142), followed by the Port St. Lucie-Fort Pierce service plaza at mile marker 144. The turnpike intersects I-95 one last time just south of SR 70 (exit 152) in Fort Pierce, as I-95 continues to head up the east coast of Florida and the turnpike curves inland towards Orlando. Ft. Pierce to Wildwood North of the SR 70 interchange, the turnpike enters a rural area, with cattle farms and orange groves lining the road for most of the section between Fort Pierce and Kissimmee, with only one interchange: SR 60 in Yeehaw Junction (exit 193). There are two service plazas in this area, one at Fort Drum at mile marker 184 and the other, Canoe Creek, at mile marker 229. Between Fort Pierce and Yeehaw Junction, the turnpike travels in a nearly east-west direction heading inland, with a gap between the two exits, the second longest of any US expressway. Between Yeehaw Junction and Kissimmee, the turnpike, returning to a north- northwest direction towards Orlando, has a ( southbound) stretch without an exit, the longest of any US expressway. At mile marker 236, the ticket system ends at the Three Lakes toll plaza, as the turnpike enters the Orlando area and development starts to reappear on the turnpike. The SunPass-only interchange located at Kissimmee Park Road, a partial interchange featuring a northbound on- and southbound off-ramp only, is named for Senator N. Ray Carroll, longtime Osceola County banker, citrus grower and cattle rancher. After interchanges with US 192/US 441 (exit 242 northbound, exit 244 southbound) and the Osceola Parkway (exit 249), the turnpike enters Orange County and Orlando. Exit 251 features a partial interchange with SR 417 (Central Florida GreeneWay), with an exit from the northbound turnpike to northbound SR 417 and entrance from southbound SR 417 to the southbound turnpike. Exit 254 in Sky Lake is a massive combined interchange with both US 17/US 92/US 441 (Orange Blossom Trail) and SR 528 (Beachline Expressway), which combines a series of parclo interchanges with access ramps from side roads. The turnpike expands to eight lanes north of this interchange, and then it intersects with Consulate Drive (exit 255), a southbound-only, SunPass-only interchange. State Road 429 in Ocoee, Exit 267A After passing the I-4 interchange (exit 259) near many of Orlando's theme parks, the Turnpike moves in a northwest direction, first passing by the Turkey Lake Service Plaza at mile marker 263, where the FDOT district headquarters of the Turnpike are located. The Turnpike has the next two interchanges with Orlando area tollways, SR 408 (East-West Expressway) at exit 265 and SR 429 (Western Expressway) at exit 267A, where in between the two exits, the turnpike expands to become a twelve-lane highway, and reverting to an eight-lane highway north of the SR 429 interchange. The last two Orange County interchanges are with SR 50 five miles apart at exit 267B and 272, with the turnpike becoming a four- lane highway north of exit 272, and staying that way for the rest of its northward journey. The Turnpike then enters Lake County, heading in a northwestern direction, where hilly countryside becomes a part of the terrain for the remainder of the expressway while intersecting with Hancock Road (exit 278) in Minneola, an electronic toll interchange. At mile 285, it has a northbound exit/southbound entrance with US 27, followed by the Leesburg toll plaza at mile 288, and a southbound exit/northbound entrance with US 27 at mile 289. The last interchange in Lake County is with County Road 470 (exit 296), which does not provide cash. The final toll plaza is in Leesburg. At mile marker 299, the turnpike passes through the final service plaza, the Okahumpka service plaza. Between US 301 (exit 304) and the northern terminus (mile 309) there is no toll. The turnpike ends with an interchange with I-75 in Wildwood, about south of Ocala. Exit 307 at SR 44 provides access to southbound I-75 through that interstate's exit 329, while northbound I-75 travelers (and bidirectional SR 44 travelers) can access the turnpike at this exit. Tolls Tolls on the turnpike are an average of for cars and other two-axle vehicles using SunPass. A trip on the entire turnpike (not including the Homestead Extension) would cost $22.59 with cash/Toll-by-Plate, and $17.45 with SunPass. The ticket system is operated between the Lantana and Three Lakes Barrier tolls, and a coin system is used south of Lantana and north of Kissimmee, with the portion between the Golden Glades toll barrier north to I-595 in Davie being a cashless toll system, similar to the HEFT. The turnpike was originally entirely on the ticket system, but due to congestion in the Miami and Orlando metro areas, a coin system was implemented in those sections of the turnpike in the 1990s. The SunPass electronic toll collection system, in use since 1999, has become the primary method of paying tolls on the turnpike, with 80% of customers using the electronic tolling . SunPass can be used on most Florida toll roads, and in conjunction with other electronic toll collection systems in Florida (E-Pass and LeeWay). SunPass users benefit from an average of a 25% discount on tolls and access to SunPass-only exit ramps. SunPass transponders are available at the gift shop and gas stations at all service plazas, as well as Walgreens, Publix, and CVS stores statewide. As the Turnpike and its system of roads are primary routes for emergency evacuations, tolls may be suspended, in cooperation with the state's emergency operations center and county governments, when a state or national emergency, most common being a hurricane watch, warrant rapid movement of the population. Services Service plazas Turkey Lake Plaza before its 2012 reconstruction Eight service plazas are located along the turnpike, spaced about apart. All eight plazas are open 24 hours a day and located on the center median of the turnpike for access from both directions and offer gasoline, diesel fuel, internet access, travel and tourism info and tickets, picnic areas, TV news, gift shops offering Florida Lottery, family-friendly restrooms, and pay phones. A convenience store/gas station is located at the Snapper Creek plaza on the Homestead Extension of the turnpike, while the remaining seven are full-service plazas, featuring a selection of franchised fast food restaurants. Three of the service plazas (Pompano, Port St. Lucie/Fort Pierce, Turkey Lake) also provide E85 ethanol. The Turkey Lake plaza also has an electric vehicle charger for Tesla vehicles. The operation of Sunshine State Parkway gas stations and service centers was originally bid out under separate contracts, and as a result, differing petroleum brands operated concurrently along the parkway, with varying levels of service and pricing. This practice was discontinued in 1995 when all service center operations were combined to improve supply and continuity of service; with Martin Petroleum, a Florida corporation, operating the stations with Citgo brand fuel at its stations. Since then, the Venezuelan government, under President Hugo Ch√°vez, nationalized Citgo, and in 2006, political controversy resulted in a movement to remove the brand from the turnpike. Currently, the gas stations are under the Shell brand. In 2009, Areas U.S.A. signed a 30-year contract for operation of food and retail concessions, taking over operations from Martin Petroleum and HMSHost. Florida Turnpike Services, L.L.C., Areas' partner, replaced the Citgo brand with Shell. Many of the restaurant brands were also changed over, with Dunkin' Donuts replacing Starbucks locations as well as KFC, Pizza Hut, Villa Pizza and Wendy's replacing most Popeyes and Burger King locations. The reconstruction and renovation of six of the service plazas began on November 1, 2010, to be completed in 2012. The Okahumpka and Ft. Pierce plazas will begin reconstruction when the other plaza projects are complete. Total renovation costs are estimated at $160 million. Intelligent transportation systems Florida's Turnpike Enterprise operates with intelligent transportation systems (ITS), used to detect and manage incidents on their roadways. The ITS are managed by two traffic management centers (TMCs), one in Pompano Beach and the other in Ocoee, operated by Florida's Turnpike Enterprise 24 hours a day, seven days a week. The system, consisting of closed-circuit television traffic cameras, dynamic message signs, highway advisory radio, and radar vehicle detection system, allow the TMC to see anything from congestion to crashes, to disabled vehicles that may pose a threat to the Turnpike's motorists. When necessary, the TMC will activate the dynamic message signs and highway advisory radio stations to alert motorists of the potential situation, as well as AMBER/Silver Alerts. Road Rangers The Safety Patrol (also known as Road Rangers, and currently sponsored by State Farm) offers free roadside assistance on Florida's Turnpike mainline and Homestead Extension. Utility trucks patrol 12 designated zones looking for stranded motorists to provide services such as fuel, tire changes, and use of a cellular phone; and also watching out for crashes and road debris. The Traffic Management Center dispatches them to accidents, debris removal, disabled vehicles, or anything that may potentially affect the traveling public; they also assist the Florida Highway Patrol with traffic maintenance during incidents involving blockage of lanes. History Planning Clermont, at mile 276 In the years following World War II, Florida was experiencing unprecedented growth in population and tourism, along with a revitalized citrus industry recovering from a harsh freeze early in the decade; the increased traffic load quickly burdened the state's highway system. South Florida businessman and accounting firm owner Charles B. Costar was concerned that a trip down the east coast of Florida would take days on the available road network, passing through every small beachside town and siphoning off the traffic before visitors reached South Florida. After driving on the Pennsylvania Turnpike during a vacation there, he envisioned a similar high-speed turnpike in Florida. In 1953, Costar led a lobbying group that resulted in the state legislature creating the \\"Florida Turnpike Act\\", which Governor Dan McCarty signed into law on July 11, 1953, as well as the Florida State Turnpike Authority, which had the ability to plan, design, and construct bond-financed toll roads, in which Costar was instrumental to create, to be repaid through the collection of tolls from Turnpike customers. Thomas B. Manuel, known as the \\"Father of the Turnpike\\", served as chairman of the Florida State Turnpike Authority from January 1955 to January 1961. Manuel debated with state legislature members opposed to tollways, emphasizing the need for a good highway system in a tourism-driven state. During the 1955 legislative session, many small-county legislators and others opposed to the Parkway formed a \\"kill the 'Pike'\\" coalition; Manuel won over the legislators at his headquarters in the Floridan Hotel near the capitol. Only four votes against the turnpike were entered at the end of the session's roll call, and the Legislature granted permission to build with a $70 million bond issue in June 1955. A Turnpike bridge in Stuart bears his name to honor his contributions. Construction Construction on the Parkway began on July 4, 1955, starting at what is now the Golden Glades Interchange. In October 1956, all work on the Sunshine State Parkway north of Ft. Pierce was abandoned and plans for a state-long turnpike were shelved due to passage of the National Interstate and Defense Highways Act, which provided for construction of limited-access highways in the corridors that had been under study for the Parkway Extension. One was Interstate 95, which was slated to connect Jacksonville with Miami in a similar alignment to the planned Sunshine State Parkway Coastal Route. This resulted in completion of a truncated highway that ran from Miami to Fort Pierce, opening on January 25, 1957. In January 1959, Governor LeRoy Collins, favoring a Parkway extension from Fort Pierce to Orlando, stated that building the Parkway north of Orlando would be unnecessary due to the interstate highway system. In late May 1959, the board authorized a study for the Parkway Extension to Orlando, and connecting the Interstate routes in Florida. In 1961, Governor Collins approved the sale of $80 million in bonds to finance the parkway extension from Fort Pierce to Wildwood, adding another of roadway and shifting Interstate 75's route eastward from its original alignment. The extension was opened in three stages: a section between Yeehaw Junction and Orlando opened on July 17, 1963, a section linking Fort Pierce and Yeehaw Junction opened on November 22, 1963, and the section between Orlando and the northern terminus of I-75 opened on July 24, 1964, completing the mainline. =I-95 realignment= The Bureau of Public Roads approved an Interstate 95 alignment that used of the Turnpike from PGA Boulevard (SR 786) in Palm Beach Gardens north to SR 70 in Ft. Pierce in the 1950s. In the mid-1960s, the State Road Department authorized traffic counts be conducted to determine if the separation of Interstate 95 from the Turnpike was feasible, with arguments that using a concurrent alignment was costing Florida money for federal highway funding, but not without the concern of losing toll revenue. Over time, the interstate adopted a route closer to U.S. Route 1, including parallel between Stuart and Palm Beach Gardens, with the turnpike being removed from the I-95 alignment in 1973, and I-95 being completed in 1987. Reckless spending With the St. Petersburg Times in 1963, a team led by Martin Waldron wrote a total of 150,000 words as part of the newspaper's coverage of unchecked spending by the Florida Turnpike Authority that led to estimated costs quadrupling from initial estimates of $100 million. Waldron received a tip about excessive spending by John Hammer, chairman of the Florida Turnpike Authority, which included expensive hotels and meals, corsages for his secretary and overcharging for a chartered plane. His coverage earned the newspaper the Pulitzer Prize for Public Service in 1964, the first for the newspaper, and led to changes in the way the state of Florida managed highway construction projects. System expansion With Florida still growing in population in the 1960s, preliminary studies began for expanding portions of the Turnpike to six lanes in South Florida and additional north‚Äìsouth highways in that area. Dade County and the State Road Department developed a plan for the West Dade Expressway (now known as the Homestead Extension of Florida's Turnpike), beginning at the Turnpike near the Dade County/Broward County line, turning westward and southward, and terminating at Florida City in southern Dade County. In 1967, the Florida State Turnpike Authority was authorized to perform engineering and feasibility studies on the West Dade Expressway and the Bee Line Connector extension, now known as the Martin Andersen Beachline Expressway. The results of the studies came in December 1968, but due to an uncertain bond market and an unknown future for the toll authority, decisions on the roads were delayed. The Florida Department of Transportation was created in July 1969, with the Florida State Turnpike Authority becoming a part of the new FDOT. Soon after, FDOT and Orange and Dade County officials agreed the Bee Line Connector and Homestead Extension of Florida's Turnpike would be financed by revenue bond issues as extensions of Florida's Turnpike. The Beeline Expressway opened in 1973 and the Homestead Extension opened in 1974 as a part of the Turnpike mainline. Later changes Florida's Turnpike looking southbound from the U.S. Route 441 overpass, two miles north of the Yeehaw Junction exit From its opening in January 1957 to April 12, 1968, the road was known as the Sunshine State Parkway (SSP). On April 12, 1968, the road was renamed to its current name of Florida's Turnpike, to identify that the toll road was located in Florida and to avoid confusion from other Florida landmarks such as the Sunshine Skyway Bridge. The Sunshine State Parkway moniker was commonly used for the next decade, and remnants of the name can be seen on several Turnpike maintenance buildings. On September 1, 1971, the Turnpike switched from a sequential exit numbering system to a hybrid numbering system, where adjacent exit numbers differed by 4 south of SR 60 (exit 60 at the time) and 5 north of SR 60. Between 1974 and 1986, the turnpike experienced little change other than maintenance as the original bonds on the road were being paid off. During this period, the turnpike experienced the first of five toll hikes on February 15, 1979, when the cost of a trip from Golden Glades to Wildwood increased to $5.90 from $4.80, the road's original toll. In 1988, the Office of Florida's Turnpike was formed, with $220 million worth of revenue bonds being sold in April 1989 to renovate the toll plazas, service centers and improve the road with the reduction of urban congestion. Fifteen new interchanges were planned in the early 1990s, with four of them opened by July 1991. Also during this time, sections of the turnpike were converted from a ticket system to a coin system due to urban congestion, with several mainline toll plazas being built. The section between the Golden Glades Plaza and Lantana was converted in 1990, with the opening of the Cypress Creek and Lantana toll plazas. Coin baskets were installed in 1994 after years of delays. The portion north of Kissimmee was converted on August 20, 1995, with the addition of the Three Lakes toll plaza and the Wildwood toll plaza at mile 304 being replaced by the Leesburg toll barrier on July 7, 1995. The improvements also came with a series of toll hikes between 1989 and 1993 to make the toll rates more uniform throughout the turnpike's length. The first one was enacted on April 1, 1989, which raised the rate to $9.95. The second one, on July 1, 1991, affected only the section north of Lantana, raising the trip's cost to $12.35. The last one took effect on July 11, 1993, increasing the trip's cost to $14.40. In 1989, the Turnpike switched its exit numbering system to the mile-log system, starting from the south end of the Homestead Extension, 13 years before Florida's interstates integrated it into their system. Because he \\"was one of America's most beloved presidents and a true world leader\\", as the Legislature put it, Florida's Turnpike was designated by the Florida Legislature in 1998 as the Ronald Reagan Turnpike, with 20 signs throughout the turnpike showing the designation. In April 1999, SunPass was introduced to the public, with SunPass-only interchanges and lanes being introduced throughout the 2000s. A toll hike took effect on March 7, 2004, increasing the toll rate for non SunPass users to $18.20, with SunPass users still using the 1993 toll rates. The HEFT ceased cash toll collections on February 19, 2011, becoming an exclusive electronic toll road, a move announced in November 2009. The manned toll plazas were converted into electronic toll gantries, and the only ways to pay are either by SunPass transponders or a \\"toll-by-plate\\" program. The Turnpike mainline began its conversion to a cashless toll road with the Golden Glades toll barrier being converted into a toll gantry on January 25, 2014, and no longer accepts cash. The portion south of I-595 was converted on August 29, 2015. Between 2005 and 2012, the Turnpike spent $380 million doubling the number of lanes from SR 528 to the northernmost interchange with SR 50 west of Winter Garden (exit 272). Most of the section was expanded from four to eight lanes, with the section between SR 408 and SR 429 being expanded from six to twelve lanes. The portion between SR 528 and Interstate 4 opened in 2008, with the portion between I-4 and SR 408 being finished in 2010, SR 408 to Beulah Road (at the north end of the SR 429 interchange) opened in March 2011, and the portion between Beulah Road and SR 50 (exit 272) was completed in 2012. In 2007, legislation was passed in Florida to index toll rates across the state to the national Consumer price index (CPI), to be enacted by the end of June 2012. As a result, the toll rates on roads on Florida's Turnpike Enterprise were raised on June 24, 2012, an increase of 11.7% to reflect the previous five years. The legislation allows for SunPass rates to be raised slightly each year, with cash rates going up every five years, with SunPass rates staying about a quarter cheaper than cash rates. In keeping with the legislation, SunPass and toll-by-plate rates were raised again on July 1, 2013 by 2.1%, with cash toll rates projected to stay the same through at least 2014. Toll rate increases were scheduled for every five years, and mid-2017 was the next scheduled date for such an increase. However, a combination of a low inflation rate and problems within the relevant state authorities caused multiple cancellations and changes in schedule for the next increase. The final projected date for an increase in tolls was eventually set for October 29, 2017. The Turnpike Enterprise and OOCEA (now CFX) agreed to build a partial interchange between SR 417 and Florida's Turnpike in the late 2000s, after negotiations dating back to a 1991 field study. The interchange is being built in two phases. The first phase, built by CFX, added ramps from southbound SR 417 to southbound Florida's Turnpike and from northbound Florida's Turnpike to northbound SR 417. Construction on the first phase began in September 2013 and opened on January 26, 2015. The second phase, completing the interchange, will be built by the Turnpike Enterprise with construction beginning in late 2014 and expected to be completed in 2017, several years ahead of its original completion date. Future Florida's Turnpike looking northbound from the overpass on Canoe Creek Road, with the Canoe Creek service plaza visible Plans are in the works to widen the Turnpike from the Lake Worth Road interchange (exit 93) to the Palm Beach-Martin County line and from SR 50 (exit 272) to North Hancock (exit 278) from four to eight lanes. In Miami-Dade County, several widening projects including new express lanes are underway. Work is also currently ongoing to widen the road from four to eight lanes between SR 528 and SR 417 and complete the interchange with the latter. Completion is expected by 2021. Florida's Turnpike Enterprise plans to convert the entire Turnpike to an all electronic toll road, like the HEFT. Work to convert the section of the Turnpike mainline between I-595 and Lantana began in 2018. The first interchange to be converted will be SR 838 (Sunrise Boulevard, exit 58), with construction running through late 2019. The project also includes several road and interchange improvements along that stretch of the Turnpike. The entire length of the turnpike north of the Three Lakes Toll Plaza is scheduled to become all-electronic by the end of 2020. Reconstruction of the northern end of the Turnpike at its junction with Interstate 75 improved the traffic merge pattern between I-75 and SR 44 with new flyover ramps and additional traffic lanes. The northbound off-ramp to SR 44 was completed on September 19, 2019, while southbound on-ramp construction was completed in early November 2019.NEW TRAFFIC PATTERN Northbound Florida‚Äôs Turnpike and Northbound I-75 Exit Ramps to SR 44 to Open in a New Location the Morning of Thursday, September 19 (Florida Turnpike Enterprise Newsletter; September 18, 2019) The Turnpike Enterprise is also studying a possible developer-funded future interchange at County Road 468 (mile marker 300, servicing The Villages and Lady Lake). This project is neither funded nor scheduled for construction at this time. Exit list North of the HEFT‚ÄìMainline interchange, the mainline continues the mileage from mile 47 from the HEFT. The spur of the mainline south of the HEFT to the Golden Glades Interchange assumes an alternate numbering system that suffixes an X to each exit number.

The only contemporary reference to this treaty, is that of a Welsh monk Asser in his biography of Alfred, (known as Vita √Ülfredi regis Angul Saxonum or Life of Alfred). In it Asser describes how after Guthrum's defeat at the Battle of Edington followed by his surrender some days later, a peace treaty was agreed with Alfred. The treaty was conditional on Guthrum being baptised and also Guthrum and his army leaving Wessex. Sources and historical context Statue of Alfred the Great at Winchester In 878 King Alfred of Wessex defeated the Viking Great Army at the Battle of Edington. Guthrum, the Viking leader, retreated with the remnants of his army to their \\"stronghold\\", where Alfred besieged him. After fourteen days the Vikings, according to Asser: Alfred accepted Guthrum's surrender and the Vikings gave Alfred peace hostages: Three weeks later Guthrum and thirty of his most important men came to Alfred at Aller, near Athelney, and there Guthrum was baptised, with Alfred accepting him as his adoptive son. The unbinding of the chrisom, part of baptismal ritual, took place eight days later at the royal estate and church at Wedmore near Cheddar. Guthrum adopted the baptismal name of Athelstan. The following twelve days Guthrum and his chiefs stayed with Alfred where they were honoured with gifts and feasting. During the summer of 878 Guthrums army remained in Chippenham. Then, as agreed Guthrum and his army moved out of Wessex, and travelled the relative short distance to Cirencester (in the Kingdom of Mercia) and then eventually on to East Anglia. Misinterpretation and confusion The Anglo-Saxon Chronicle for 878 has a similar description to Asser, it details Alfred's movements before, during and after the Battle of Edington. It describes Guthrum's surrender, his baptism at Wedmore and the twelve days of celebration. The only reference to an accord at Wedmore is that from Assers \\"Life of Alfred\\". If there was a formal treaty, contemporary with the events at Wedmore in 878, no such document still exists. However a truce was made; and at a later date a formal treaty was agreed. This one was known as the Treaty of Alfred and Guthrum and it defines the boundaries between Alfred and Guthrums territories as well as agreements on peaceful trade, and the weregild value of its people. This document still survives and is part of the Laws of Alfred. The treaty is seen as a precursor to the formation of Danelaw. The two treaties, that is the Treaty of Wedmore and the Treaty of Alfred and Guthrum have often been confused with each other. It is possible that the Treaty of Wedmore in 878, where Guthrum had to accept baptism and leave Wessex was a verbal agreement. The formal written Treaty of Alfred and Guthrum dividing up the kingdoms followed some years later.

He addresses problems of food production and wastewater processing by using ecosystems technologies that incorporate plants, animals and bacteria. Todd has developed \\"Arks\\" or \\"bioshelters\\", ecologically closed \\"life-support systems\\" with the goal of sustainable functioning. He combines alternative technologies for renewable energy, organic farming, aquaculture, hydroponics and architecture to create \\"living machines\\" or \\"eco-machines\\". John Todd is a co-founder with Nancy Jack Todd of the non-profits New Alchemy Institute (1969‚Äì1991) and Ocean Arks International (1981), and the founder and president of the design and engineering firm John Todd Ecological Design Inc. (1989). A research professor emeritus and distinguished lecturer at the University of Vermont, Todd has published books on ecological design, as well as over 200 scientific papers, popular articles and essays. Early life and education Todd was born in Hamilton, Ontario, Canada in 1939 and grew up near Hamilton Bay on Lake Ontario. The area near his home included marshes and streams which were being badly damaged by pollution. The writings of Louis Bromfield offered Todd a \\"marvelous tale of hope\\" about the possibility of land restoration. Todd earned his B.Sc. (1961) in agriculture and his M.Sc. (1963) in parasitology and tropical medicine at McGill University in Montreal, Quebec, Canada. He then did doctoral work in marine biology at the University of Michigan, studying fisheries and oceanography. His early professional interest in the behavioral ecology of fish was the basis of his work as an assistant professor of ethology at San Diego State University (1968‚Äì1970). Career John Todd joined the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution in Woods Hole, Massachusetts, as an assistant scientist in 1970. At Woods Hole, John Todd began to develop his ideas about how complicated biological food chains worked. An important influence on Todd's thinking was his wife, Nancy Jack Todd, a dancer, writer, editor and activist. In their conversations Nancy wondered if ecological concepts could be applied to address people's needs. She encouraged John Todd to put \\"a human face\\" on his research. Since then, the couple have edited and co-written several books, and are co-recipients of a number of awards. New Alchemy Institute In 1969 the Todds and William O. McLarney co-founded the New Alchemy Institute in Cape Cod, Massachusetts to \\"engage in scientific research in the public interest on ecologically and behaviourally planned agriculture systems and rural land based communities.\\" The institute was a \\"fusion of technology and counterculture\\". Its members proposed to apply principles and design strategies from the biological sciences to technology in ways that would be economically and environmentally sustainable. Although the New Alchemy Institute dissolved in 1991, it has been described as \\"a catalyst of change promoting the development of new ecological design solutions, alternative technologies and methods of ecological food production and waste treatment.\\" One of the approaches they developed was the concept of bioshelters, \\"greenhouse-like architectural structures containing ecosystems for various purposes: food for humans, waste purification systems, etc.\\" Wendell Berry wrote admiringly: \\"The bioshelter idea, then, proposes to make a household on the pattern of an ecosystem, adapted to the local landscape and climate, using local materials... Its governing principle is symbiosis: the food production system heats the house; the fish tanks raise fish, heat the greenhouse, provide irrigation water and fertilizer for the plants.\\" The idea that the wastes created in one part of a system provide valuable resources for another part of the system is fundamental to the design of such sustainable ecosystems. Ocean Arks International In 1981, Todd co-founded the non-profit Ocean Arks International (OAI). The original idea behind Ocean Arks was to build wind-powered vessels capable of carrying ecological materials and support technologies, for use in countries throughout the developing world. Such a vision was beyond the reach of the organization. Todd began to focus on other concerns relating to water, in particular the development of alternative approaches to conventional waste treatment. He applied ideas from aquaculture and organic agriculture to wastewater. His approach was to identify ecological pathways through which nutrients from waste could be recycled. Waste from one organism could become a food source for subsequent organisms, instead of being discarded as an unusable and toxic by-product. The first \\"Solar Aquatics System\\" (SAS) for wastewater treatment was an experimental pilot at the Sugarbush Ski resort near Warren, Vermont, around 1986. During the 1990s, Todd was involved in several attempts to start companies for the technologies he envisioned. The personnel, financing and technologies involved in these companies overlap in complicated and confusing ways, with each other and with Ocean Arks International. The term \\"Living Machines\\" was filed for registration as a wordmark in 1991, and was registered to Ocean Arks International in 1993 by the United States Patent and Trademark Office. Ecological Engineering Associates, Inc. Ecological Engineering Associates, Inc. (EEA) was founded in Marion, Massachusetts in 1988 as a commercial venture to more effectively promote the work of Ocean Arks International. Susan B. Peterson, previously an employee of OAI, became EEA's first president. Co-founder John Todd preferred not to serve on its board, but was involved as an \\"ecological designer\\". EEA designed and installed a wastewater plant to remediate septage lagoons at Harwich, Massachusetts (see below). Work began in 1988, and the system became operational in 1990. EEA developed several other projects, using transparent water columns for treatment units in its \\"solar aquatic systems\\". Patents for processes relating to solar aquatics were filed under the inventor names of John Todd and Barry Silverstein in 1988 and 1991, and granted to EEA. EEA registered the trademark \\"Solar Aquatic\\" specifically for waste treatment tanks with transparent water columns. Living Technologies Inc. Todd also co-founded Living Technologies Inc. (LTI), an ecological design, engineering, and construction company, in Burlington, Vermont. It was incorporated as a company on October 26, 1994, in the state of Florida. Some of the personnel involved in Living Technologies, including president Michael Shaw, had connections to OAI and to a prior company called Advanced Greenhouse Systems (AGS) which had been established in 1989 by William Rapp, also in Burlington Vermont. Two patents for Ecological Fluidized Beds (EFB) were filed by John Todd and Michael Shaw in 1993 and 1995. The patents were granted to OAI in 1996 and 1997. EFBs were used in the design of what were increasingly referred to as living machines. In 1997, Living Technologies Inc. sought a second round of funding, which it obtained from Tom Worrell. In 1998, there was considerable reorganization of the company and its board. Worrell assumed ownership of the company in 1999 and acquired the rights to the original patents for Todd's \\"Living Machine\\". As of December 2000, in an out-of-court settlement, Worrell obtained the sole right to use \\"Living Machine\\" as a proprietary term. Worrell's company went through a number of name changes and relocations. Worrell Water Technologies, LLC of Charlottesville, Virginia currently holds the registered trademark for the name Living Machine. Worrell Water Technologies has redesigned Todd's original systems and patented a number of new technologies since 2002. John Todd Ecological Design Inc. In 1989, Todd incorporated \\"John Todd Research and Design\\" in Falmouth, Massachusetts. It later became \\"John Todd Ecological Design\\" (JTED). Through this company, Todd has developed his own later- generation wastewater treatment systems, under the name \\"Eco-machines\\". As of 2014, John Todd Ecological Design registered the trademark for the term \\"Eco- machines\\". Todd's son, Jonathan Todd, is the president of John Todd Ecological Design. University of Vermont Todd taught at the University of Vermont as a guest lecturer beginning in 1997. He became a research professor in 1999. He is now a research professor emeritus and distinguished lecturer. Ecological design Todd and his colleagues were some of the first people to actually create miniature ecosystems, largely self-perpetuating, which applied ecological principles to address human needs. Todd's approach is one of biomimicry, in which a complex natural ecosystem such as a marsh is studied, recreated and adapted. Learning from the natural system, the ecological designer combines micro-organisms, fish, and plants into a functionally complex system that is capable of carrying out tasks such as bioremediation and phytoremediation. Todd emphasized the importance of establishing an ecosystem with a large number of diverse species and then allowing it to \\"settle\\" to a stable state, a process that could take weeks, months, or even years. He recommended seeding the ecosystem with local species, ones that had already demonstrated an ability to withstand conditions in the target environment. He sought to create systems that were capable of self-organizing and displaying emergent properties. Such systems are of necessity complex and cannot be well understood in terms of simple reductionism. Todd has applied these ideas in various ways, to create types of applications including \\"bioshelters\\" or \\"arks\\", \\"ecological treatment systems\\" (ETS), \\"advanced ecologically engineered systems\\" (AEES) \\"living machines\\", and \\"eco-machines\\". Water living machine at Oberlin College This work has resulted in innovative new approaches to processing wastewater and sewage. Todd and colleagues developed what they called \\"living machines\\". These systems are ecologically engineered technologies developed to restore, conserve, or remediate polluted water, by replicating and accelerating the natural purification processes of streams, ponds and marshes. In practical application, a living machine is a self-contained treatment system designed to treat a specific waste stream using the principles of ecological engineering. It does this by creating diverse communities of bacteria and other microorganisms, algae, plants, trees, snails, fish and other living creatures in a series of tanks. The EPA has concluded that this approach is appropriate to the treatment of municipal and some industrial types of wastewater, and that it can be competitive in cost compared to more conventional systems. Sewage Greenhouse waste treatment plants such as the ones John Todd has developed can yield clean water from sewage. Bacteria consume the organic sewage and turn ammonia into nitrates. The nitrates are used as food for algae and fertilizer for duckweed. Zooplankton and snails consume the algae. Fish eat the zooplankton. Floating plants soak up the leftovers. Bulrushes, cattails, and water hyacinths render the toxins harmless. Trees absorb heavy metals. The byproducts are decorative plants and minnows, both of which are sold. The minnows are sold as bait fish. Aquatic plants, raised in the system's open-air lagoons for sewer treatment, are used in California, Florida, and Mississippi. By enclosing such a system within a greenhouse, it becomes possible to do this in the colder northern climates as well.  Projects  Todd's waste treatment systems have been implemented for sites in at least nine countries, in both the industrialized and developing world. Sites include Australia, Brazil, Canada, Czechoslovakia, England, Hungary, India, Scotland, and the United States. A number of projects have been particularly noteworthy because of the introduction of new concepts or major achievements.  The Cape Cod Ark  Soon after its founding in 1969, the New Alchemy Institute began to develop its first experimental environment, eventually known as the \\"Cape Cod Ark\\", at their headquarters in Falmouth, Massachusetts on Cape Cod. Their goals were to process wastewater and to explore the potential for food production. A series of solar ponds, each with its own ecosystem, processes wastewater and uses recaptured materials to farm fish and to grow vegetables and fruits. These include papaya trees, eggplants, tomatoes, and herbs. Computers were introduced to monitor and study the processes of remediation, energy use, and food production. Heating and electricity needs were met using renewable energy sources. The system was enclosed within a greenhouse, designed by architects Sean Wellesley-Miller and Day Chahroudi, so that it could operate year-round.Observations of Plant Response and Food Production in Solar Bioshelters. November 1977. Kathi Ryan & Earle Barnhart. [Report on maiden winter of Cape Cod Ark, built in fall 1976 ] When the New Alchemy Institute dissolved in 1991, the Cape Cod Ark became the property of a private co-housing community. In 1999, it was taken over by Hilde Maingay and Earle Barnhart, two of the co-founders of the New Alchemy Institute. Working with architect Ate Atema, they upgraded the structure and added an energy-efficient house to the original greenhouse. Under their care, the 1800 square feet Ark became a self-sustaining home, supporting humans, plants, fishes and animals year-round. The Cape Cod Ark was still their home as of 2014. Having provided both an experimental testbed for New Alchemy's ideas, and a sustainable home for two of its founding members for over 15 years, the Cape Cod Ark has been referred to as \\"New Alchemy‚Äôs crowning achievement\\".  The Prince Edward Island Ark  In 1974 Todd returned to Canada to design and build \\"An ARK for P.E.I.\\" at Spry Point, Kings County on Prince Edward Island, with financial support from the federal and provincial governments. Completed by David Bergmark and Ole Hammarlund of Solsearch Architects and the New Alchemy Institute, the Ark gained national attention. It was officially opened by Prime Minister Pierre Trudeau on September 21, 1976. The Ark was an attempt to re-examine the relationship between people and nature. It also gave the New Alchemists an opportunity to test their ideas in a very cold climate. Differing expectations about the project caused difficulties. Because the experimental nature of the Ark had been de- emphasized, the technological problems that occurred became particularly embarrassing. Also, many Canadians expected the publicly funded installation to be viewable as a demonstration project for renewable energy and sustainable living. In contrast, the New Alchemists onsite saw it as a private research installation and tried to discourage visitors. In 1977, New Alchemists David Bergmark and Nancy Willis moved out, ending the experiment in sustainable living. The Ark was supervised for two more years by Ken MacKay, a biologist hired by the provincial government's Institute of Man and Resources (IMR), and then closed in 1981. Nonetheless, the Ark was an important test bed for many of the principles that were later applied to \\"living machines\\", as well as a number of trail-blazing and now established green or sustainable technologies: solar orientation, solar collectors, wind energy, thermal energy storage, and composting toilets. Historian Henry Trim emphasizes the Ark's impact on Canadian culture, helping \\"to introduce Canadians to renewable energy and organic foods as well as pioneering green architecture, aquaponics, and sustainable farming.\\" Although it was demolished in 2000, the Ark has been called one of \\"Prince Edward Island‚Äô s two most iconic works of modern architecture\\". In 2016, it was commemorated in the exhibit Living lightly on the earth: building an Ark for Prince Edward Island, 1974-76 at the Confederation Centre of the Arts in Charlottetown, P.E.I.  Harwich, Massachusetts  In 1988, the town of Harwich, Massachusetts hosted a four- month pilot of one of Todd's lagoon systems, involving 21 solar aquatic ponds and a constructed marsh. The pilot's success encouraged further involvement with Ecological Engineering Associates. For Todd, it was a \\"watershed moment\\", an important proof of concept for the ecological design approach. \\"After the successful first trials, I knew that it was possible to do good things in bad places; in short, to heal the planet.\\" By 1990 a full-scale project was being planned for Harwich's Flax Pond, a 15-acre site. The pond suffered from significant contamination due to leachates from a nearby landfill and septage lagoons. Oxygen levels in the water were low and coliform bacteria counts were high. Sediment deposits included high levels of ammonia, up to 300 times the usual levels of phosphorus, and 80 times the usual concentration of iron. A floating construction called a Pond Restorer was completed in 1992. Using a windmill and solar panels as energy sources, it drew up 100,000 gallons of water per day from the bottom of the pond. The water was sent through a series of columns involving a variety of substrates, bacterial and mineral amendments, freshwater clams, and terrestrial plants. A positive oxygen regime was restored to the bottom of the pond, and sediment depth was significantly reduced by 1995. In the later 1990s, the design was modified to create an \\"advanced ecologically engineered system\\" (AEES). Large reductions in phosphorus, ammonia, and iron occurred between 1999 and 2001. Beginning in June 2001, the original structure was replaced with the first large-scale wastewater application of floating AEES Restorers. Twelve Restorers are arranged across the lagoon, in a pattern designed to promote a serpentine water flow. The installation incorporates 25,000 plants from 25 native species to remediate waste.  Findhorn Ecovillage, Moray, Scotland  Living Machine, Findhorn Ecovillage, 2006 The first \\"Living Machine\\" was created at Findhorn Ecovillage in Moray, Scotland in 1995. For its design, John Todd drew on the work of K√§the Seidel and H.T. Odum. The system had to accommodate wastewater from an ongoing population of about 300 residents, and a seasonally fluctuating population of as many as 10,000 visitors per year. The resulting installation resembles a tropical conservatory garden. Every organism provides food for the next step in the food chain until the cycle is complete. As a first-generation system, the Findhorn installation has undergone numerous changes. During its first fifteen years of operation it passed regular quality checks from the Scottish Environmental Protection Agency (SEPA), and was never out of compliance.  South Burlington, Vermont  The Vermont Advanced Ecologically Engineered System (AEES) was one of four AEES demonstration projects created with funding from the United States Environmental Protection Agency. The site in Chittenden County, near South Burlington, Vermont, was owned by the Massachusetts Institute for Excellence in Marine and Polymer Sciences, who received the grant. The project involved Living Technologies, Inc. as a subcontractor, and Ocean Arks International, with John Todd as principal investigator. Project design began in 1994. The main construction was complete by December 1995, when the introduction of biological species began. A steady state of operation was established by May 1996 and continued to the end of 1999. The plant was designed to treat 80,000 gallons from the city's daily wastewater output of 200,000 gallons. The Vermont AEES included wetlands for the extended aeration and treatment of activated sludge, with an active microbial community as well as plants, invertebrates, and fish. One of the goals of the project was to examine the approach's usefulness in a cold climate. A greenhouse protected the plants. The installation contained two parallel trains of treatment tanks, for experimental comparisons of treatments. During the course of the project, the operators met all but one of the original design goals, and were able to improve on the original design as a result of experimenting with the tank configurations. The area was used as both an experimental and an educational center, and was appreciated for its \\"uniquely beautiful aesthetic experience\\".  Adam Joseph Lewis Center for Environmental Studies  One of Todd's Living Machines was a \\"vital thread\\" in the design of the Adam Joseph Lewis Center for Environmental Studies at Oberlin College by David W. Orr in the 1990s. While the Living Machines's primary function was to treat wastewater, it was also intended to be a model of sustainability and ecological design for the teaching of Oberlin students. Oberlin students helped to design, install, and maintain the system. Due to the complexity of the systems involved and issues in communication, a number of design oversights occurred during planning and construction. Limitations in available space and placement of features obstructed wetland flow, a brick wall with no functional purpose shaded some of the tanks, and some of the plants were in areas that had to be traversed by maintainers. Such problems decreased the system's effectiveness, complicated its maintenance, and had to be addressed. Researchers also regretted that a single processing track was built, limiting their ability to establish parallel control and test conditions.  Omega Center for Sustainable Living  Omega Center for Sustainable Living The Omega Center for Sustainable Living (OCSL) in Rhinebeck, New York, was opened on June 24, 2009. The building was designed by BNIM Architects, working with John Todd Ecological Design as the ecological architects. Designed to be self-sustaining and carbon neutral, the building includes an Eco-machine for water reclamation. The Eco-machine's 4,500-square- foot greenhouse and constructed wetland was designed to recycle about 5 million gallons of wastewater per year through the activity of plants, bacteria, algae, snails, and fungi. In 2010, the Omega Center for Sustainable Living was one of two buildings world-wide to be the first fully certified \\"living buildings\\", demonstrably achieving net zero energy usage and net zero wastewater production over a period of a year.  George D. Aiken Center, University of Vermont  As part of the green redesign of the Aiken Center at the University of Vermont, John Todd Ecological Design, Inc. supported the creation of the Aiken Center Eco Machine between 2006 and 2012. Much of the design work for the water treatment plant was done by Matt Beamas, one of Todd's graduate students, who presented his master's thesis on the work in 2010. In addition to treating all of the wastewater from the Aiken Center, the system provides opportunities for ongoing ecological design research at the school. The wastewater system includes three separate trains, for experimental study of the system's use. The building is considered to be \\"a national model for green renovation of a campus building\\". It has been awarded LEED Platinum certification. Recognition Todd's work has inspired people working on the development of closed ecosystems for living in space, as well as on Earth. Todd was profiled in Inventing Modern America (2002), published by the Lemelson-MIT Program for Invention and Innovation, in which the story of the development of his innovative ecological waste treatment systems is highlighted. John Todd was the inaugural winner of the international Buckminster Fuller Challenge in 2008, for his proposal for a Comprehensive Design for a Carbon Neutral World: The Challenge of Appalachia. Todd put forward a program for the reclamation of more than one million acres of damaged land, through soil remediation, forestry, and the development of renewable energy. Other awards that Todd has received include the Chrysler Award for Innovation in Design in 1994, and on April 22, 1996, an Environmental Merit Award (from the United States Environmental Protection Agency). In 1998, the Todds received the Bioneers Lifetime Achievement Award. Also in 1998 they were the first couple to receive the Lindbergh Award in recognition of their work in technology and the environment. They are Fellows of the Findhorn Foundation. Todd is a fellow of the Gund Institute for Ecological Economics.

Markov is the younger Prince Twin of Markovia and the elder brother of Terra. One of the founding members of the superhero group the Outsiders, he first appeared in a special insert in The Brave and the Bold #200 (July 1983). The character was created by Mike W. Barr and Jim Aparo. Brandon Marshall, a character loosely based on Geo-Force, is portrayed by Jahking Guillory in the live action series Black Lightning. Fictional character biography Batman and the Outsiders Dr. Helga Jace used a device to give Prince Brion Markov superpowers with which he could stop an insurrection mounted by the evil Baron Bedlam. Five other superheroes converge on Markovia for various reasons of their own. Veteran heroes Batman, Metamorpho, and Black Lightning join forces with Geo-Force and two other new heroes, Katana and Halo. After stopping the insurrection, the heroes decide to remain together as the Outsiders, with Batman (who has resigned from the Justice League) as team leader. Brion gets along with his teammates, though he occasionally butts heads with Batman and his teammates due to his short temper. When he is not active as a superhero, Brion attends college in the US and begins dating classmate Denise Howard. In one of their earliest missions, the Outsiders team up with the Teen Titans, who are led at the time by Batman's sidekick, Robin. Geo-Force is the brother of Tara Markov, also known as Terra, of the Titans. Tara is the product of an affair King Markov (Brion's father) had with an unnamed American woman. Fearing scandal, the king sent Tara to be raised in the United States. Unbeknownst to Geo-Force and her fellow Titans, Terra is secretly a spy working for Deathstroke. Brion is happy to be reunited with his half-sister, though Terra is less happy due to her fears that Brion will say the wrong thing and possibly expose the fictional back-story she has told the Titans about herself and how she gained her powers. Several weeks later, Terra betrays the Titans for Deathstroke. In the climactic battle between Titans and the alliance of Deathstroke and Terra, Terra's sociopathic personality breaks down as she tries to kill both the Titans and Deathstroke, when Deathstroke's son Joseph intervenes on behalf of the Titans to stop his father. In the end, Terra accidentally kills herself when she tries to bury the Titans alive in a massive rock storm. At first, the Titans do not tell Geo-Force of her betrayal, letting him think that she has died a hero. However, Batman later reveals the truth to Geo-Force, which leaves him even more heartbroken. In his depression, Geo-Force cannot bring himself to continue wearing his earthtone costume, as it reminds him of Tara, who wore a similar uniform. Designed and suggested by Batman, a new green and gold costume is presented to Brion by his teammates to lift his spirits. It works well, and Geo-Force wears green and gold for most of his career. The colors have a dual importance to Geo-Force as both the colors of his native Markovia's flag, as well as symbolically representing the Earth, from which his powers are derived (green), while reminding him how precious his gifts truly are (gold). By the time he joins the Justice League, however, Geo-Force has returned to another version of his old earthtone uniform. The Outsiders After the Outsiders split with Batman, they are privately funded by Markovia. During this time, Geo-Force is the unofficial new leader of the team. However, this information eventually comes out and Major Disaster destroys their base. Around this time, the sovereignty of Markovia again comes under threat. Investigating the mysterious new prime minister, Geo-Force leads a team of Outsiders and Infinity, Inc. members back to his homeland. Having grown up in the main castle, it is easy for Geo-Force to lead the team in. He soon discovers that the Psycho-Pirate in the disguise of long-term Outsiders enemy Baron Bedlam is attempting to conquer the country. The two teams join forces to stop Psycho-Pirate and leave on good terms. Brion, meanwhile, has a one-night stand with Looker when the team is stranded on a desert island. The move strains the relationship between Brion and his girlfriend Denise, as well as Looker's relationship with her husband. Brion and Looker agree to remain platonic friends afterward. The United States government withdraws any foreign aid from Markovia until that nation releases the true names of the Outsiders. King Gregor, Brion's older brother, is murdered before he can make a decision. Brion becomes king, but he is forced to abdicate and is imprisoned when his sister-in-law, Iona (Gregor's wife), reveals she is pregnant. His teammate Looker reveals to Brion that the murderer of his brother was the team's trusted friend and scientist associate, Doctor Jace. Jace has betrayed the team for the Manhunters because she admires their dedication to knowledge. In the end, Jace dies, along with a mind-controlled Metamorpho. This, along with a second battle with the descendants of teammate Looker, which results in Looker being temporarily stripped of her powers and Halo left injured and comatose, causes the Outsiders to disband and Brion to retire as Geo-Force. In the early 1990s, however, the Outsiders were revived with former Outsiders Geo-Force, Katana, Halo, and Looker joined by new heroes Faust, Technocrat and Wylde. The latter two are on hand to sell a new battlesuit to Markovia. Queen Iona has teamed up with Roderick, a vampire, in order to kill Geo-Force, though the first attempt makes it seem as if Technocrat is under attack. Using a vampire's inability to be recorded, Roderick frames Geo-Force for Iona's on- air murder, forcing the team to run. Geo-Force and the Outsiders are on the run for some time, hiding out mostly in America. They eventually clear their names and destroy Roderick and his vampiric legions. At the end of the second Outsiders series, Brion marries his long-time girlfriend, Denise Howard. Brion and the new Terra awaiting the results of the DNA test. During this time, another Terra has appeared as part of a group known as the Team Titans, who appear to have come from the future. This new Terra claims to have been a normal girl who was given Terra's appearance and powers as a result of a DNA virus. Geo-Force's first attempt to talk to her meets with failure when he accidentally gets swept up in a rock column she has created during a loud party. He finds her again at the Titans headquarters. After a brief fight with her friends, he manages to sit down with her. The new Terra convinces him she is not his sister. Unfortunately, rogue Markovian scientists attack with the intention of forcibly duplicating Terra's powers. Geo-Force and the other Titans rescue her. Further revelations imply that this Terra is in fact from their time, when the original Terra's grave is dug up and her corpse is missing from her coffin. Brion invites Terra to live in Markovia, which she accepts, as her group of Titans is disbanding. In Markovia, scientists conduct a DNA test in the hopes of discovering if Terra is, in fact, Geo-Force's sister. Terra is afraid of finding out the results, fearful that she might, in fact, be a villainous traitor. When the test results come back positive, Brion lies to Terra, telling her that the results are negative. Around this time, as part of the Day of Judgement incident, a portal to hell threatens to swallow the country of Markovia. A small team of Outsiders, including the newer Terra, Katana, and the original Halo, are on hand to help combat it. Geo-Force and Terra become kidnap victims of a strange cult run by a man with mind-control powers. They are rescued by the super-team called the \\"Birds of Prey\\". Geo- Force briefly appears in 52 #35, assisting Metropolis citizens injured in a mass-murder caused by Lex Luthor. He later is a part of the army of heroes gathered by the Justice Society at the end of 52 to battle Black Adam who, in his global killing spree after the death of his wife and brother-in-law, has murdered Terra II. Before the battle, Geo-Force tells Beast Boy not to blame himself for Terra II's death. Justice League of America While sailing in his yacht off the coast of Greece, Geo-Force suddenly finds himself losing control over his powers, which have suddenly changed to include his sister's earth manipulation powers. This sudden increase in power, which causes Geo- Force to black out, is ultimately caused by the villainous Deathstroke through as yet unrevealed means. Geo-Force seeks help from the newly reformed Justice League of America, becoming an unofficial member of the group. This will ultimately be revealed to be Deathstroke's overall plan, as he ultimately confronts Geo-Force in order to blackmail him into becoming a spy, just like Terra, in exchange for Deathstroke's promise to one day remove the added powers he forced upon Geo-Force. Unfortunately for Deathstroke, however, Geo- Force informs Superman, Batman, and Wonder Woman of Deathstroke's scheme and agrees to become a double agent: spying on Deathstroke for the League, while spying on the League for Deathstroke. Unfortunately, the scheme falls apart when Lex Luthor organizes a new incarnation of the Injustice League and captures the Justice League. While a prisoner, Geo-Force is brutally tortured alongside Red Tornado at the hands of Gorilla Grodd. While recovering from his injuries, Geo-Force is \\"traded\\" to Batman's latest incarnation of The Outsiders, much to Geo-Force's dismay and, ultimately, acceptance. In DC Universe: Last Will and Testament, Geo-Force confronts Deathstroke in a battle. After contemplating murder, he is talked out of it by Black Lightning and Rocky Davis of the Challengers of the Unknown. He loses a lot of blood to Deathstroke in their fight. However, he sets their confrontation at the same alley and building complex where Deathstroke's second son Jericho was held after being kidnapped. Slashing his own throat in the same manner as his son was cut lets Deathstroke's guard down, allowing Brion to impale Deathstroke with his own sword through his own body. Believing he has defeated Deathstroke, while sacrificing his own life, he is surprised to wake up in the hospital. It is thought that he single-handedly took down Deathstroke, but no one knows that Geo-Force was trying to commit suicide. Geo-Force becomes the field leader of the Outsiders and is still secretly living with the shame of his actions. Blackest Night Geo-Force is visited by his sister, who has been reanimated as a member of the Black Lantern Corps. Claiming to have been freed from the dark force that was controlling her, Tara begs Brion to kill her.Outsiders vol. 4, #24. DC Comics. However, it is a facade in order to feed on the Outsiders' emotions. Geo-Force turns Terra into a statue and her ring is destroyed by Halo.Outsiders vol. 4, #25. DC Comics. Marriage and divorce Geo-Force later marries his long-time girlfriend, Denise Howard. However, since she is not a Markovian, the marriage is annulled by Brion's choice. Unbeknownst to Brion, Denise later tries to undergo the same experiment which transformed Geo-Force into a powerful hero but, because she does not have Markovian blood in her, she gains the same powers but with a changed appearance and loss of sanity, becoming Geode. She is locked up, but escapes to take revenge on Markovia by killing several innocent Markovians. Geo-Force proclaims his affections for Katana, but before she can answer Geo's declaration of love, they are interrupted by Eradicator. Eradicator informs Brion of Geode's escape and her recent attack on Markovia. Geo-Force and Eradicator go to intercept Geode. The battle with Brion's deranged wife seems one-sided as Geode smacks both heroes around like ragdolls. Eradicator pleads with Geo-Force to use his powers to subdue Geode, but Brion is conflicted over the idea of striking his wife. With Geo-Force unable to take the initiative, Eradicator decides to unleash the full extent of his power to knock Geode unconscious. Later, Geode is free from her captivity, thanks to an unusual character named Veritas. Veritas wants Geode to begin Markovia's immediate destruction, which will draw out Geo-Force, who pinpoints the center of the disturbance in Markovia and is approached by Veritas. Veritas asks Brion to join him and reestablish Markovia's Old World Order. Brion refuses Veritas' offer and Veritas tells Geode to kill her estranged husband. Geo-Force gathers his strength and becomes a giant rock creature. Unfortunately, Brion's unstable powers have put Markovia in danger, because his new form consists of Markovia itself and earthquakes begin to spring up. One earthquake opens up a large crevice beneath Geode and Veritas. The two villains fall to their supposed doom and Geo-Force finally realizes that Veritas used Geode to tempt Geo-Force into unleashing his untapped abilities in order to destroy Markovia. Now, Markovia is torn between civil war and the devastation that Brion has inadvertently wrought on his people. DC Rebirth Prince Brion Markov appears, without his Geo-Force identity or costume, in the miniseries Suicide Squad: Most Wanted. He meets Katana for the first time and helps her and the Suicide Squad battle the terrorist organisation Kobra, attempting to invade Markovia. There is no indication he possesses any superhuman abilities. During the Dark Nights: Metal event it is revealed that Batman had been operating a team known as the Outsiders as a stealth team of black ops for some time, with Metamorpho, Black Lightning, Katana, Halo and Geo-Force.Dark Days: The Forge #1.

At the time when Superman confronts Doctor Manhattan, Geo-Force arrives with his Outsiders alongside the People's Heroes in an attempt to bring Superman in for what happened in Russia. Geo-Force tells Superman to do the right thing and cooperate. Both foreign superheroes and Black Adam's group start to charge towards Superman to see who will get to him first which intensifies when the other foreign superhero teams show up. The fight is broken up when Doctor Manhattan undoes the experiment that erased the Justice Society of America and the Legion of Super-Heroes from history.Doomsday Clock #12. DC Comics. Powers and abilities As implied by his code name, all of Brion's powers are in some way related to the planet Earth. He can manipulate the Earth's gravitational field to make an object heavier (\\"plus-gravity\\") or lighter (\\"null-gravity\\"). He can project scorching \\"lava blasts\\" in imitation of terrestrial volcanoes.Batman and the Outsiders Vol. 1 #1 (1983). DC Comics. By using his null-gravity power on himself, coupled with lava blasts for propulsion, Geo-Force can fly at great speeds for short periods of time (his teammate Black Lightning once remarked that Geo-Force weakens after flying 1,000 miles). Geo-Force has demonstrated the ability to manipulate the Earth itself, in a manner similar to Terra. Brion has shown he can turn organic material to earthen mineral with a touch. This ability is not quite explained in the instance where he turns the reanimated corpse of Terra to stone.Outsiders vol. 4 #25. DC Comics. Geo-Force possesses impressive superhuman strength, speed and durability. He once used his gravity manipulation powers to enhance his own super-strength, strengthening him sufficiently enough to fight pre-crisis Superman toe-to-toe.Batman And the Outsiders #19. DC Comics.

Other versions In the alternate timeline of the Flashpoint event, Brion Markov is the king of Markovia. At some point, he is contacted by Mera while trying to make an alliance with the Atlanteans, due to the Amazonian Invasion of the United Kingdom. He is later captured by Aquaman, who attaches the young king to a machine constructed by Vulko in order to amplify Brion's powers of manipulation of the Earth's gravitational field. It is through Brion that Aquaman manages to cause Western Europe to sink into the sea. In other media Television =Live-action= * The CW TV series Arrow features a character named Dr. Brion Markov in the Season 1 episode \\"Darkness on the Edge of Town\\". This Brion Markov (played by Eric Floyd) is a scientist for Unidac Industries, who invents a device that can manipulate seismic activity. Malcolm Merlyn hires him to develop the device into a weapon. After the task is complete, Merlyn murders Markov and his staff. * A loose adaptation of Geo- Force appears in the third season of the Arrowverse television series Black Lightning, portrayed by Jahking Guillory. This version is named Brandon Marshall, a student at Garfield High alongside Jennifer Pierce. Early in the season, he reveals his geokinetic metahuman status to her and how Helga Jace killed his mother in her experiments before teaming up with on occasion to fight off an invasion of Markovians. Near the end of the season, he learns that his mother Helen was a Markovian and his father had the same earth-based abilities as him. Brandon kept Dr. Jace in his apartment so that she can give him information about his father. =Animation= * Geo-Force appears in the Batman: The Brave and the Bold episode \\"Requiem for a Scarlet Speedster!\\", voiced by Hunter Parrish. He is one of the latest members of the Outsiders when they help Batman fight Kobra. * Geo-Force appears in Young Justice: Outsiders, voiced by Troy Baker. In this incarnation, Brion is a seventeen- year-old boy and the fraternal, younger twin brother of Crown Prince Gregor Markov of Markovia. After his younger sister Tara was kidnapped by meta-human traffickers two years earlier, Brion decides to activate his meta-gene in order to gain the power to stop the traffickers and find his sister. After being put into a meta-activation tank against his will by Dr. Helga Jace and Dr. Simon Ecks, Brion's meta-gene is activated. When his villainous uncle Baron Bedlam tried to frame him for the recent murder of his parents, Brion angrily confronts his uncle, but is outmatched since he is unable to control his new-found powers. After Superboy's intervention and having to prevent meta-humans from causing further damage to Markovia, Gregor is forced to exile a heartbroken Brion from their home. Though he asks Superboy to take care of his brother in his place. Brion begins training with Nightwing, Artemis, Halo, Black Lightning, and then Forager to better develop and control his new-found abilities. Due to his banishment and his family tragedies, Brion has anger issues being expressively angry at Superboy, and the other heroes and impatient at how long it is taking to find his sister. Over the course of the series, he becomes attracted to \\"Violet Harper\\" who he later calls his girlfriend, and develops a friendship with Forager. In \\"True Heroes\\", Brion finally reunites with his long-lost sister after two years and helps her release her fellow slaves. He introduces her to his girlfriend and is glad that she has joined the Team, but he is unaware that princess Tara is secretly in league with the enemy. He and the other three members later joined the Team until he later switches to the Outsiders. In the season finale, during a mission to Markovia to once again defeat his uncle, Brion eventually learns of his sister's deceit when she attempts to kill Beast Boy, but she chooses to stay with the heroes in the last minute for the kindness and respect they've shown her. However, overwhelmed with rage and feeling betrayed long enough, Brion betrays everyone back except Ambassador Zviad Baazovi and he gets his revenge on his uncle by turning his own arm into magma and shooting it down his uncle's throat while still in rock form, thus petrifying and outright killing him. Believing his actions truly justified and having lost everything, Brion starts embracing his darkest impulses and punishes the world by banishing the heroes from Markovia and even proceeding to overthrow DeLamb and usurp Gregor as King of Markovia with Baazovi as his chancellor, unaware he is now merely a puppet for the Light which Zviad has just joined by manipulating Brion with his partial psychic powers. Miscellaneous * Geo-Force appears in Teen Titans Go (#51 Metamorphosis). Geo-Force is the older brother of Terra and the crown prince of Markovia, his and Terra's homeland. He showed up in America looking for his younger sister, Terra, to bring her back to Markovia. After he had come in contact with the Titans, Beast Boy brought him to the school where he met the schoolgirl who looked like Terra. Geo-Force was certain that the schoolgirl was, in fact, his sister Terra, but he remarked that she looked happy now, something he had never seen in Markovia. Deciding not to confront her, he left her to grow up happy in Jump City and headed back to Markovia alone. When flying off with Beast Boy, Terra appears to have caught a glimpse of her brother, and gives a smile before continuing to talk to her friends, indicating that she does indeed remember him.

The first Aqualad, Garth, debuted in February 1960 in Adventure Comics #269 and was created by writer Robert Bernstein and artist Ramona Fradon. This Aqualad also appeared in animated form on television in 1967 and 1968. The second Aqualad, \\"Kaldur\\" Kaldur'ahm, was originally created for the Young Justice 2010 animated TV series by Greg Weisman, Brandon Vietti and Phil Bourassa. Several months prior to the launch of the cartoon, an altered version of the character introduced as Jackson Hyde was brought into comic books by writer Geoff Johns and artist Ivan Reis in September 2010. The Garth version of Aqualad made his live adaptation debut in the second season of the DC Universe series Titans, played by Drew Van Acker. Fictional character biography Garth Years ago, King Thar and his wife Queen Berra became the reigning monarchs of Shayeris, the capital of a group of Idyllist colonies in the Hidden Valley. Radical Idyllists deposed and murdered King Thar and banished his pregnant wife Queen Berra to Poseidonis, the capital city of Atlantis; there she gave birth to Garth, a child with purple eyes. Superstitious Atlanteans claimed that Garth had been born genetically inferior due to his purple eyes and banished him to a barren seabed leagues away from Atlantis. He survived and later befriended Aquaman, the sometimes outcast King of Atlantis. He was a founding member of the Teen Titans, and later became known as Tempest. Kaldur'ahm (Jackson Hyde) Jackson Hyde first appeared in Brightest Day #10 (September 2010). This coincides with the appearance of Aqualad in the Young Justice animated series (albeit using the name Kaldur'ahm). According to Johns, the new Aqualad is named Jackson Hyde, and is a black teenager from New Mexico. In a teaser poster for the Brightest Day event, he is shown using \\"hard water\\" abilities to create a sword. This ability had previously been thought to belong exclusively to Aquaman's wife, Mera, and people from her world. In other media Television * Aqualad's first animated appearance was alongside Aquaman in Filmation's 1967 animated series The Superman/Aquaman Hour of Adventure, as well as in the Teen Titans shorts that were part of the series. The Aquaman cartoon series of 1968 was a repackaged 30-minute version featuring primarily (but not exclusively) Aquaman and Aqualad. He was voiced by Jerry Dexter. * Aqualad has also appeared on the Teen Titans animated series, voiced by Wil Wheaton. His first appearance was in \\"Deep Six\\" where he, Tramm, and the Titans defeated Trident; here and in his other appearances, he demonstrates telepathic control of sea life. In \\"Winner Take All\\", Aqualad demonstrates the ability to control water by means of Hydrokinesis. In the series, he serves as a Titans East member, a short term crush of Raven and Starfire, and a temporary rival to Beast Boy. He is now an official member of Teen Titans' sister group, Titans East, with Bumblebee, Speedy, and the twins M√°s y Menos. He appears in a cameo in the movie after the series, Teen Titans: Trouble in Tokyo. As the Titans travel to Tokyo, Japan he comes out of the water and waves to them. * Aqualad also makes eight appearances on the comic series based on the show. In his first appearance in Teen Titans Go! (issue #10), he searches for Gill Girl. He told the Titans that she used to have a crush on him, but he looked at her like a sister. Beast Boy did not believe him and says that she dumped him. He made short appearances in #20, #25, & #27. One of the stories in issue #30 focused on him and Speedy. In issue #48 an alternative version of him as Tempest appeared in a group called the Teen Tyrants. * Aqualad was mentioned in the Batman: The Brave and the Bold episode \\"The Color of Revenge!\\", as Batman says to Robin, \\"Even Aqualad had to scrub barnacles.\\" He made a full appearance in \\"Sidekicks Assemble!\\", voiced by Zack Shada as a teenager and by Zachary Gordon as a child. He battled Ra's al Ghul along with Robin and Speedy. Here, Aqualad is shown to be in his late teens and is very resentful of the praise lavished upon Aquaman, eventually telling him off in the episode's final scene. * Garth appears in the Young Justice episode \\"Downtime\\", where he is voiced by Yuri Lowenthal. In the episode, it is explained that Garth is the best friend of Kaldur‚Äôahm. While Kaldur went on to become Aquaman's sidekick, Garth stayed in Atlantis in order to hone his abilities at an Atlantean sorcery conservatory. Sometime in between this, and the episode \\"Downtime\\", he started a relationship with Tula (Aquagirl), who was formerly involved with Kaldur. A reference to his Tempest identity is made during a battle with Black Manta, with Garth shouting \\"I summon the power of the tempest!\\" while conjuring a cyclone. * Aqualad appears in the animated series Young Justice, voiced by Khary Payton. His name is Kaldur'ahm, but he goes by the nickname Kaldur. Within the series, he is the son of supervillain Black Manta, and the leader of Young Justice. In the episode \\"Alienated\\", Kaldur leaves the team to join his father. He blames the team for Aquagirl's death on a mission and Aquaman for not telling him who his real father was. He dons a similar outfit to Black Manta. While confronting the team, he appears to murder Artemis. However, this is an elaborate ruse to go undercover in Black Manta's organization. * The Kaldur‚Äôahm version of Aqualad appears in the Teen Titans Go! episode \\"Let's Get Serious\\", reprised by Khary Payton, where he mocks the Titans for not being \\"serious\\" heroes. The Garth version of Aqualad debuted in the episode \\"Pirates\\", reprised by Wil Wheaton, where he starts dating Raven, much to Beast Boy's jealousy, until Raven ultimately dumps him after forcing him and Beast Boy to fight to death, and Aqualad loses; afterwards, he makes recurring appearances throughout the series. * The Garth version of Aqualad appears in season 2 of the DC Universe series Titans portrayed by Drew Van Acker. *The Garth version of Aqualad appears in DC Super Hero Girls, voiced by Jessica McKenna. This incarnation is much younger than other versions, still being a child, and is a student at Metropolis High School. His last name is also mentioned as being Bernstein, and he is shown to be carrying small bottles of water around for when he needs to use his super- powers.

It is one of the four major dopamine pathways in the brain, and is critical in the production of movement as part of a system called the basal ganglia motor loop. Dopaminergic neurons of this pathway release dopamine from axon terminals that synapse onto GABAergic medium spiny neurons (MSNs), also known as spiny projection neurons (SPNs), located in the striatum. Degeneration of dopaminergic neurons in the SNc is one of the main pathological features of Parkinson's disease,Diaz, Jaime. How Drugs Influence Behavior. Englewood Cliffs: Prentice Hall, 1996. leading to a marked reduction in dopamine function and the symptomatic motor deficits of Parkinson's disease including hypokinesia, tremors, rigidity, and postural imbalance.  Anatomy  The connection between the substantia nigra pars compacta and the dorsal striatum is mediated via dopaminergic axons.  Substantia nigra pars compacta (SNc)  The substantia nigra is located in the ventral midbrain of each hemisphere. It has two distinct parts, the pars compacta (SNc) and the pars reticulata (SNr). The pars compacta contains dopaminergic neurons from the A9 cell group that forms the nigrostriatal pathway that, by supplying dopamine to the striatum, relays information to the basal ganglia. In contrast, the pars reticulata contains mostly GABAergic neurons. The SNc is composed of a thin band of cells that overlies the SNr and is situated laterally to the A10 group of dopaminergic neurons in the ventral tegmental area (VTA) that forms the mesolimbic dopamine pathway. The SNc is easily visualized in human brain sections because the dopamine neurons contain a black pigment called neuromelanin which is known to accumulate with age. The dopaminergic cell bodies in the SNc are densely packed with approximately 200,000 to 420,000 dopamine cells in human SNc and 8,000 to 12,000 dopamine cells in mouse SNc. These dopamine cell bodies are localized to one of two chemically defined layers. Those in the upper layer (or dorsal tier) contain a binding protein called calbindin-D28K which can buffer calcium levels inside the cell when it becomes too high or toxic. Dopamine cells in the lower layer (or ventral tier) lacks this protein and are more vulnerable to the effects of neurotoxins (e.g. MPTP) that can cause Parkinson disease-like symptoms. The dorsal tier dopamine cells have dendrites that radiate horizontally across the pars compacta, whereas ventral tier dopamine cells have dendrites that extend ventrally into the pars reticulata.  Dopaminergic axons  The axons from dopamine neurons emanate from a primary dendrite and project ipsilaterally (on the same side) via the medial forebrain bundle to the dorsal striatum. There is a rough topographical correlation between the anatomical localization of the dopamine cell body within the SNc and the area of termination in the dorsal striatum. Dopaminergic cells in the lateral parts of the SNc project mainly to the lateral and caudal (posterior) parts of the striatum, whereas dopamine cells in the medial SNc project to the medial striatum. In addition, dopamine cells in the dorsal tier project to the ventromedial striatum, whereas the ventral tier neurons project to the dorsal caudate nucleus and putamen. In general, there is a greater density of dopaminergic input to the dorsolateral striatum. Each dopamine neuron has an extremely large unmyelinated axonal arborization which can innervate up to 6% of the striatal volume in a rat. Although all SNc dopamine cells project to both the striosome (or patch) and matrix neurochemical compartments of the striatum, most of the axonal territory of a dorsal tier neuron is in the matrix compartment while the majority of the axonal field of ventral tier neurons is in the striosomes. Nigrostriatal dopamine axons can also give rise to axon collaterals that project to other brain regions. For example, some, SNc nigrostriatal dopamine axons send axon collaterals to the pedunculopontine nucleus, the ventral palladium, subthalamic nucleus, globus pallidus, amygdala and the thalamus. A small number of SNc dorsal tier dopamine neurons also project directly to the cortex, although most of the dopaminergic innervation of the cortex comes from the adjacent VTA dopamine neurons. Dorsal striatum The dorsal striatum is located in the subcortical region of the forebrain. In primates and other mammals it is divided by the anterior limb of a white matter tract called the internal capsule, into two parts: the caudate nucleus and the putamen. In rodents, the internal capsule is poorly developed such that the caudate and putamen are not separated but form one large entity called the caudate putamen (CPu). The majority (about 95%) of cells in the dorsal striatum are GABAergic medium spiny neurons (MSNs) also known as spiny projection neurons (SPNs). Approximately half of these MSNs contain dopamine D1 receptors and project directly to the substantia nigra to form the direct pathway of the basal ganglia, whereas the other half express dopamine D2 receptors that project indirectly to the substantia nigra via the globus pallidus and subthalamic nucleus to form the indirect pathway of the basal ganglia. The remaining 5% of cells are interneurons that are either cholinergic neurons, or one of several types of GABAergic neurons. The axons and dendrites of these interneurons stay within the striatum. The caudate nucleus and putamen receive excitatory information from all areas of the cerebral cortex. These glutamatergic inputs are generally topographically arranged such that the putamen takes information largely from the sensorimotor cortex whereas the caudate nucleus obtains information largely from the association cortex. In addition, the dorsal striatum receives excitatory inputs from other brain structures like the thalamus, and minor excitatory inputs from the hippocampus and amygdala. The dorsal striatum contains neurochemically defined compartments called striosomes (also known as patches) that exhibit dense Œº-opioid receptor staining embedded within a matrix compartment that contains higher acetylcholinesterase and calbindin-D28K. The dopaminergic axon terminals of the nigrostriatal pathway synapse onto GABAergic MSNs in the dorsal striatum. They form synapses on the cell body and dendritic shaft regions but mostly on the necks of dendritic spines that also receive glutamatergic input to the heads of the same dendritic spines.  Function  The main function of the nigrostriatal pathway is to influence voluntary movement through basal ganglia motor loops. Along with the mesolimbic and mesocortical dopaminergic pathways the nigrostriatal dopamine pathway can also influence other brain functions including cognition, reward and addiction. Nigrostriatal dopaminergic neurons exhibit tonic and phasic patterns of neuronal firing activity. This can lead to different patterns of dopamine release from the axon terminals in the dorsal striatum and also from the cell body (soma) and dendrites in the SNc and SNr. As well as releasing dopamine some axons in the nigrostriatal pathway can also co-release GABA. Basal ganglia connections showing direct and indirect pathways for movement. The nigrostriatal dopamine pathway is shown in pink. The nigrostriatal pathway influences movement through two pathways, the direct pathway of movement and the indirect pathway of movement.  Direct pathway of movement  The direct pathway is involved in facilitation of wanted movements. The projections from dopamine D1 receptor containing medium spiny neurons in the caudate nucleus and putamen synapse onto tonically active GABAergic cells in the substantia nigra pars reticulata and the internal segment of the globus pallidus (GPi) which then project to the thalamus. Because the striatonigral / striatoentopeduncular and nigrothalamic pathways are inhibitory, activation of the direct pathway creates an overall net excitatory on the thalamus and on movement generated by the motor cortex.  Indirect pathway of movement  The indirect pathway is involved in suppressing unwanted movement. The projections from dopamine D2 receptor containing medium spiny neurons in the caudate nucleus and putamen synapse onto tonically active GABAergic cells in the external segment of the globus pallidus (GPe) which then projects to the substantia nigra pars reticulata via the excitatory subthalmic nucleus (STN). Because the striatopallidal and nigrothalamic pathways are inhibitory but the subthalamic to nigra pathway is excitatory, activation of the indirect pathway creates an overall net inhibitory effect on the thalamus and on movement by the motor cortex. Clinical significance  Parkinson's disease  Parkinson's disease is characterized by severe motor problems, mainly hypokinesia, rigidity, tremors, and postural imbalance. Loss of dopamine neurons in the nigrostriatal pathway is one of the main pathological features of Parkinson's disease. Degeneration of dopamine producing neurons in the substantia nigra pars compacta and the putamen-caudate complex leads to diminished concentrations of dopamine in the nigrostriatal pathway, leading to reduced function and the characteristic symptoms. The symptoms of the disease typically do not show themselves until 80-90% of dopamine function has been lost. = Levodopa-induced dyskinesia = Levodopa-induced dyskinesias (LID) is a complication associated with long-term use of the Parkinson's treatment L-DOPA characterized by involuntary movement and muscle contractions. This disorder occurs in up to 90% of patients after 9 years of treatment. The use of L-DOPA in patients can lead to interruption of nigrostriatal dopamine projections as well as changes in the post-synaptic neurons in the basal ganglia.  Schizophrenia  Presynaptic dopamine metabolism is altered in schizophrenia.

It is located south of Guatemala City's center and from Antigua Guatemala. It is administered by the Direcci√≥n General de Aeron√°utica Civil. La Aurora International Airport is the primary airport of Guatemala. The airport went through a massive modernization and expansion. The airport is now able to accept a greater number of flights and larger aircraft. It provides high standard installations to the traveler. The old terminal has been renovated in accordance with its original design. It was partly demolished and was expanded with a new glass-designed concourse and is now able to accommodate up to twenty-two aircraft. The greater project was completed by December 2008. The airport currently has two terminals: Central and North. La Aurora International Airport is the fourth busiest airport in Central America in terms of passenger traffic, surpassed by Tocumen International Airport in Panam√°, Juan Santamar√≠a International Airport in Costa Rica, and Monse√±or √ìscar Arnulfo Romero International Airport in El Salvador. In June 2007 the airport was certified as Category I but lost it in August 2018.  Overview  La Aurora is being renovated, along with other airports in Guatemala, such as Mundo Maya International Airport, Quetzaltenango Airport, Puerto Barrios Airport, and San Jos√© Airport. In July 2007, seven new gates were opened. These gates are equipped with jetway bridges and modern conveniences, also a new parking garage was also built and it can handle up to 500 vehicles. There are brand new ticket counters. 2007 brought significant gate expansion (11 new gates were available starting December 2007). The airport now has two concourses. The northern concourse has 12 traditional gates and 3 remote gates. The central concourse, is used for larger aircraft as it provides 4‚Äì6 gates depending on the size of the aircraft. The airport's runway currently measures . There have been efforts in the past to expand the runway but this has not yet been possible since there's a commercial area to the north of the runway and a small ravine near the southern side of the runway. Still, the renovation of the runway is in progress. The first phase consists in repaving the runway as well modernizing the illumination system. Future plans to expand the taxiway repave and move all the cargo facilities to San Jos√© Airport in Escuintla and Puerto Barrios Airport in Izabal. This will make room for more passenger terminal area and improved taxiways. Finally, the airport administration building is being refurbished and a regional terminal is being built. La Aurora International Airport has 2 Exclusive VIP Lounges.

During World War II, the airport was used by the United States Army Air Forces Sixth Air Force defending the Central American coastline against Axis powers submarines. The first American personnel began arriving in December 1941; the airfield was improved and expanded by the United States' 805th Engineer Aviation Battalion in early 1942. During its period of American use, the military facilities of the airport were known as Guatemala City Air Base. Flying units assigned to the airport were: * 51st Fighter Squadron (Detachment) (32d Fighter Group), 2 January 1942 ‚Äì 9 March 1943, (P-40 Warhawk) * 74th Bombardment Squadron (40th, 6th Bombardment Groups), 9 January 1942 ‚Äì 7 April 1944 (B-18 Bolo, B-17 Flying Fortress) * 44th Bombardment Squadron (40th Bombardment Group) 6 July 1942 ‚Äì 4 June 1943, (B-18 Bolo) Detachments from the airfield operated intermittently from San Jose Airport, San Jos√©, Costa Rica, and Puerto San Jos√©, Guatemala from 1942 though 1944. After the war ended, a small number of Americans remained at the airport performing training duties with the Guatemalan Air Force and also operating a weather station (MATS 6th Weather Squadron). United States personnel were restricted to base during the Guatemalan revolution following the death of Colonel Francisco Xavier Arana on 18 July 1949. Some artillery shells landed on the base during the violence. The facility was closed on 28 July 1949 and turned over to Guatemalan authorities. The airport was closed for six months in 2020, from March to September, in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. Airlines and destinations Passenger Check-in counters at the airport.

Accidents and incidents * On 1 March 1980, a Douglas C-47 of the Fuerza A√©rea Guatemalteca was damaged beyond repair near La Aurora. * On 6 April 1993, TACA Airlines Flight 510, a Boeing 767, ran off the end of Runway 19 (now Runway 20) after landing. A passenger on board filmed the landing, which showed a runway with standing water from a tropical storm which had just passed over. A great amount of runway had passed under the plane before touchdown and the pilot forced the landing. In spite of thrust reversers used, the plane could not slow down in time, began to shudder from excessive wheel- braking, the captain made a last second decision to steer the airplane to the left of the runway (avoiding a big ditch at the end of the runway), went down an embankment and stopped into some structures. Surprisingly, there were no fatalities and the only injured people were 3 non-passengers. The aircraft was written off. *On 28 April 1995, Faucett Flight 705, a Douglas DC-8 leased by Millon Air, overshot the runway and crashed into several houses. All three crew members onboard survived, but 6 people on the ground were killed. *On 21 December 1999, Cubana de Aviaci√≥n Flight 1216, a McDonnell Douglas DC-10-30 (leased to Cubana by AOM French Airlines) overshot runway 19 during landing and crashed into a residential area. 16 of the 314 people on board were killed, along with two people on the ground. * On 4 June 2018, the airport had to close due to the 2018 Volc√°n de Fuego eruption.

It is independent of the moral dimension, which is called moral agency. In sociology, an agent is an individual engaging with the social structure. Notably, though, the primacy of social structure vs. individual capacity with regard to persons' actions is debated within sociology. This debate concerns, at least partly, the level of reflexivity an agent may possess. Agency may either be classified as unconscious, involuntary behavior, or purposeful, goal directed activity (intentional action). An agent typically has some sort of immediate awareness of their physical activity and the goals that the activity is aimed at realizing. In ‚Äògoal directed action‚Äô an agent implements a kind of direct control or guidance over their own behavior. Human agency Agency is contrasted to objects reacting to natural forces involving only unthinking deterministic processes. In this respect, agency is subtly distinct from the concept of free will, the philosophical doctrine that our choices are not the product of causal chains, but are significantly free or undetermined. Human agency entails the claim that humans do in fact make decisions and enact them on the world. How humans come to make decisions, by free choice or other processes, is another issue. The capacity of a human to act as an agent is personal to that human, though considerations of the outcomes flowing from particular acts of human agency for us and others can then be thought to invest a moral component into a given situation wherein an agent has acted, and thus to involve moral agency. If a situation is the consequence of human decision making, persons may be under a duty to apply value judgments to the consequences of their decisions, and held to be responsible for those decisions. Human agency entitles the observer to ask should this have occurred? in a way that would be nonsensical in circumstances lacking human decisions-makers, for example, the impact of comet Shoemaker‚ÄìLevy on Jupiter. In philosophy The philosophical discipline in charge of studying agency is action theory. In certain philosophical traditions (particularly those established by Hegel and Marx), human agency is a collective, historical dynamic, rather than a function arising out of individual behavior. Hegel's Geist and Marx's universal class are idealist and materialist expressions of this idea of humans treated as social beings, organized to act in concert. Also look at the debate, philosophically derived in part from the works of Hume, between determinism and indeterminacy. Structure and agency forms an enduring core debate in sociology. Essentially the same as in the Marxist conception, \\"agency\\" refers to the capacity of individuals to act independently and to make their own free choices, based on their will, whereas \\"structure\\" refers to those factors (such as social class, but also religion, gender, ethnicity, subculture, etc.) that seem to limit or influence the opportunities that individuals have. In other sciences Other notions of agency have arisen in the field of economics/management, psychology and social cybernetics: In economics (contract theory): Economic agency is an internal instrumentality through which external influences operate mechanistically on action. Internal agency events are a reflection of the impact of external environments from which causal attributes are ignored, and the self-system is simply a repository and conduit for environmental forces. In psychology: The term of agency used in different fields of psychology with different meaning. It can refer to the ability of recognizing agents or attributing agency to objects based on simple perceptual cues or principles, for instance the principle of rationality, which holds that context-sensitive, goal-directed efficient actions are the crucial characteristics of agents. This topic is thoroughly investigated by developmental and comparative psychologists to understand how an observer is able to differentiate agentive entities from inanimate objects, but it can be also related to the term of autonomous intelligent agency used in cybernetics. Agency can also imply the sense of agency, that is the feeling of being in control. Emergent interactive agency defines Bandura's view of agencies, where human agency can be exercised through direct personal agency. Bandura formulates his view of agency as a socio-cognitive one, where people are self-organizing, proactive, self- regulating, and engage in self-reflection, and are not just reactive organisms shaped and shepherded by external events. People have the power to influence their own actions to produce certain results. The capacity to exercise control over one‚Äôs thought processes, motivation, affect, and action operates through mechanisms of personal agency. Such agencies are emergent and interactive, apply perspectives of social cognition, and make causal contributions to its own motivations and actions using ‚Äòreciprocal causation‚Äô.Bandura, A. (1986). Social Foundations of Thought and Action: A Social Cognitive Theory, Prentice- Hall, Englewood Cliffs, NJ Bormann, 1996 In social cybernetics: Autonomous agency is able to embrace the concepts of both the economic agency and the emergent interactive agency. An autonomous system is self-directed, operating in, and being influenced by, interactive environments. It usually has its own immanent dynamics that impact on the way it interacts. It is also adaptable and (hence viable thus having a durable existence), proactive, self- organizing, self-regulating and so forth, participates in creating its own behaviour, and contributes to its life circumstances through cognitive and cultural functionality. Autonomous agency may also be concerned with the relationship between two or more agencies in a mutual relationship with each other and their environments, with imperatives for an agency's behaviour within an interactive context due to immanent emergent attributes.Guo, K.J., Yolles, M., Fink, G., Iles, P., 2016, The Changing Organisation: Agency Theory in a Cross-cultural Context, Cambridge: Cambridge University Press In political economy: Human agency refers to the ability to shape one‚Äôs life and a few dimensions can be differentiated. Individual agency is reflected in individual choices and the ability to influence one‚Äôs life conditions and chances. The individual agency differs strongly within the society across age, gender, income, education, personal health status, position in social networks, and other dimensions. Collective agency refers to situations in which individuals pool their knowledge, skills, and resources, and act in concert to shape their future. Everyday agency refers to consumer and daily choices, and finally strategic agency refers to the capacity to affect the wider system change. Political economy approaches can be used to conceptualize the agency enabling or limiting rule system, wichthat constitutes the ‚Äúgrammar‚Äù for social action and that is used by the actors to structure and regulate their transactions with one another in defined situations or spheres of activity.

The intended effect is to make viewers, surrounded by the panoramic image, feel as if they were standing in the midst of the place depicted in the image. Background Paul Philippoteaux painting the Gettysburg Cyclorama circa 1883. From the archives of Gettysburg National Military Park Panoramas were invented by Irish painter Robert Barker, who wanted to find a way to capture the panoramic view from Calton Hill in central Edinburgh, Scotland. He subsequently opened his first cyclorama building in Edinburgh in 1787. Cycloramas were very popular in the late 19th century. The most popular traveled from city to city to provide local entertainment ‚Äî much like a modern movie. As the viewers stood in the center of the painting, there would often be music and a narrator telling the story of the event depicted. Sometimes dioramas were constructed in the foreground to provide additional realism to the cyclorama. Circular and hexagonal-shaped buildings were constructed in almost every major US and European city to provide a viewing space for the cycloramas. For example, a 360¬∞ depiction of the land and naval battles of Vicksburg was completed and first exhibited in Paris. This work by Lucien- Pierre Sergent and Joseph Bertrand traveled to New York, Chicago and San Francisco and Tokyo. \\"Land and Naval Battles of Vicksburg, Panorama in Asakusa Park, Tokyo,\\" c. 1891; retrieved 2011-06-03 In 1885 the Philadelphia Panorama Company installed the \\"Battle of Chattanooga\\" in two units in Kansas City and Philadelphia, it was painted by Eugen Bracht. In 1892 a cyclorama was made of the 1876 \\"Battle of Little Bighorn.\\" Little Bighorn Cyclorama Battle of Gettysburg Cyclorama building st the Alaska Yukon Pacific Exhibition in 1909 Hundreds of cycloramas were produced; however, only about thirty survive. An extension of this concept into motion pictures was pioneered with the invention of the Cin√©orama that debuted at the 1900 Paris Exposition. These evolved into such formats as IMAX and Circle-Vision 360¬∞ as can be seen Epcot's Reflections of China. Ben-Hur dramatisation  The main action centerpiece of the 1899 play Ben-Hur was the use of a live chariot race using real horses and real chariots set against a cyclorama. The Era's drama critic detailed how it was achieved by \\"four great cradles, 20ft in length and 14ft wide, which are movable back and front on railways\\". The horses galloped full- pelt towards the audience, secured by invisible steel cable traces and running on treadmills. Electric rubber rollers spun the chariot wheels. A vast cyclorama backdrop revolved in the opposite direction to create an illusion of massive speed, and fans created clouds of dust. The critic for The Illustrated London News described it as \\"a marvel of stage-illusion\\" that was \\"memorable beyond all else\\". The Sketch's critic called it \\"thrilling and realistic ... enough to make the fortune of any play\\" and noted that \\"the stage, which has to bear 30 tons' weight of chariots and horses, besides huge crowds, has had to be expressly strengthened and shored up\\".Guardian article: Ben-Hur, London, 1902. 8 October 2003.

Etymology How the machine came to be called a \\"bomb\\" has been an object of fascination and speculation. One theory, most likely apocryphal, originated with Polish engineer and army officer Tadeusz Lisicki (who knew Rejewski and his colleague Henryk Zygalski in wartime Britain but was never associated with the Cipher Bureau). He claimed that Jerzy R√≥≈ºycki (the youngest of the three Enigma cryptologists, and who had died in a Mediterranean passenger-ship sinking in January 1942) named the \\"bomb\\" after an ice-cream dessert of that name. This story seems implausible, since Lisicki had not known R√≥≈ºycki. Rejewski himself stated that the device had been dubbed a \\"bomb\\" \\"for lack of a better idea\\".Marian Rejewski, \\"How the Polish Mathematicians Broke Enigma,\\" Appendix D to W≈Çadys≈Çaw Kozaczuk, Enigma, 1984, p. 267. Perhaps the most credible explanation is given by a Cipher Bureau technician, Czes≈Çaw Betlewski: workers at B.S.-4, the Cipher Bureau's German section, christened the machine a \\"bomb\\" (also, alternatively, a \\"washing machine\\" or a \\"mangle\\") because of the characteristic muffled noise that it produced when operating.W≈Çadys≈Çaw Kozaczuk, Enigma, 1984, p. 63, note 1. A top-secret U.S. Army report dated 15 June 1945 stated:The US 6812 Div. Bombe Report (1944) :A machine called the \\"bombe\\" is used to expedite the solution. The first machine was built by the Poles and was a hand operated multiple enigma machine. When a possible solution was reached a part would fall off the machine onto the floor with a loud noise. Hence the name \\"bombe\\". The U.S. Army's above description of the Polish bomba is both vague and inaccurate, as is clear from the device's description at the end of the second paragraph of the \\"History\\" section, below: \\"Each bomb... essentially constituted an electrically powered aggregate of six Enigmas...\\" Determination of a solution involved no disassembly (\\"a part... fall[ing off\\") of the device. Background The German Enigma used a combination key to control the operation of the machine: rotor order, which rotors to install, which ring setting for each rotor, which initial setting for each rotor, and the settings of the stecker plugboard. The rotor settings were trigrams (for example, \\"NJR\\") to indicate the way the operator was to set the machine. German Enigma operators were issued lists of these keys, one key for each day. For added security, however, each individual message was encrypted using an additional key modification. The operator randomly selected a trigram rotor setting for each message (for example, \\"PDN\\"). This message key would be typed twice (\\"PDNPDN\\") and encrypted, using the daily key (all the rest of those settings). At this point each operator would reset his machine to the message key, which would then be used for the rest of the message. Because the configuration of the Enigma's rotor set changed with each depression of a key, the repetition would not be obvious in the ciphertext since the same plaintext letters would encrypt to different ciphertext letters. (For example, \\"PDNPDN\\" might become \\"ZRSJVL.\\") This procedure, which seemed reasonably secure to the Germans, was nonetheless a cryptographic malpractice, since the first insights into Enigma encryption could be inferred from seeing how the same character string was encrypted differently two times in a row. History Using the knowledge that the first three letters of a message were the same as the second three, Polish mathematician‚Äìcryptologist Marian Rejewski was able to determine the internal wiring of the Enigma machine and thus to reconstruct the logical structure of the device. Only general traits of the machine were suspected, from the example of the commercial Enigma variant, which the Germans were known to have been using for diplomatic communications. The military versions were sufficiently different to present an entirely new problem. Having done that much, it was still necessary to check each of the potential daily keys to break an encrypted message (i.e., a \\"ciphertext\\"). With many thousands of such possible keys, and with the growing complexity of the Enigma machine and its keying procedures, this was becoming an increasingly daunting task. In order to mechanize and speed up the process, Rejewski, a civilian mathematician working at the Polish General Staff's Cipher Bureau in Warsaw, invented the \\"bomba kryptologiczna\\" (cryptologic bomb), probably in October 1938. Each bomb (six were built in Warsaw for the Cipher Bureau before September 1939) essentially constituted an electrically powered aggregate of six Enigmas and took the place of some one hundred workers.Marian Rejewski, \\"The Mathematical Solution of the Enigma Cipher,\\" Appendix E to W≈Çadys≈Çaw Kozaczuk, Enigma, 1984, p. 290. Enigma's plugboard, with two cables connected (ten were used during World War II). This enhancement greatly increased the system's security. The bomb method was based, like the Poles' earlier \\"grill\\" method, on the fact that the plug connections in the commutator (\\"plugboard\\") did not change all the letters. But while the grill method required unchanged pairs of letters, the bomb method required only unchanged letters. Hence it could be applied even though the number of plug connections in this period was between five and eight. In mid-November 1938, the bombs were ready, and the reconstructing of daily keys now took about two hours.Marian Rejewski, \\"Summary of Our Methods for Reconstructing ENIGMA and Reconstructing Daily Keys...\\", Appendix C to W≈Çadys≈Çaw Kozaczuk, Enigma, 1984, p. 242. Up to July 25, 1939, the Poles had been breaking Enigma messages for over six and a half years without telling their French and British allies. On December 15, 1938, two new rotors, IV and V, were introduced (three of the now five rotors being selected for use in the machine at a time). As Rejewski wrote in a 1979 critique of appendix 1, volume 1 (1979), of the official history of British Intelligence in the Second World War, \\"we quickly found the [wirings] within the [new rotors], but [their] introduction [...] raised the number of possible sequences of drums from 6 to 60 [...] and hence also raised tenfold the work of finding the keys. Thus the change was not qualitative but quantitative. We would have had to markedly increase the personnel to operate the bombs, to produce the perforated sheets (60 series of 26 sheets each were now needed, whereas up to the meeting on July 25, 1939, we had only two such series ready) and to manipulate the sheets.\\"Marian Rejewski, \\"Remarks on Appendix 1 to British Intelligence in the Second World War by F.H. Hinsley\\", p. 80. Harry Hinsley suggested in British Intelligence... that the Poles decided to share their Enigma-breaking techniques and equipment with the French and British in July 1939 because they had encountered insuperable technical difficulties. Rejewski rejected this: \\"No, it was not [cryptologic] difficulties [...] that prompted us to work with the British and French, but only the deteriorating political situation. If we had had no difficulties at all we would still, or even the more so, have shared our achievements with our allies as our contribution to the struggle against Germany.\\" See also * Polish Cipher Bureau. * Bombe: machine, inspired by Rejewski's \\"cryptologic bomb,\\" that was used by British and American cryptologists during World War II to decrypt German Enigma ciphers. * Cryptanalysis of the Enigma. * Zygalski sheets: device, invented about October 1938 by Henryk Zygalski and called \\"perforated sheets\\" by the Poles, that made possible the recovery of the Enigma's entire cipher key.

Biography He was born in a small village called Garissa in the Lughaya district in Somaliland. He was born into the politically powerful Mamassan subclan of the Issa clan. He played an important role in Djibouti's struggle for independence from France. According to I.M. Lewis, \\"with the powerful support of the French electorate\\" Hassan Gouled campaigned against Mahamoud Harbi Farah of the Union Republicaine party, who sought to join the territory with neighboring Somalia. By the time of the 23 November 1958 elections, Mahamoud Harbi's party had disintegrated and with the majority of the Afar vote, his faction won election. Mahamoud Harbi subsequently fled Djibouti, and later died in a plane crash.I. M. Lewis, A modern history of Somalia, fourth edition (Oxford: James Currey, 2002), p. 180 Hassan Gouled served as Vice-President of the Government Council from 1958 to April 1959. Hassan Gouled also served in the French National Assembly 1959-1962 and the French Senate 1952‚Äì1958. He was defeated in parliamentary elections in 1962 by Moussa Ahmed Idriss of the Party of Popular Movement (PMP). In the 1960s, he led the Democratic Union Issa. It is a signatory to the agreement of Arta in September 1963. He was then education minister in a government led by Ali Aref Bourhan from 1963 to 1967. He was briefly jailed in July 1967, along with other officials of the PMP (which he had joined in 1965). He was elected to the Territorial Assembly in November 1968 and later became Minister of the Interior. Later he served as the first Prime Minister of Djibouti between May 1977 and July 1977. Towards independence In 1974, Hassan Gouled called a vote with the support of Fran√ßois Mitterrand. He became president of the African People's League for Independence (LPAI) created in February 1975 by the merger of the African People's Union (UPA) and the League for the Future and Order. The General Secretary was Ahmed Dini. He became President of the Governing Council on 18 May 1977 and was elected President of the future Republic of Djibouti on 28 May by the Chamber of Deputies. It remained so until 1999. After the attack on the \\"Zinc Palm\\" in December 1977, it banned the main opposition party, the MPL, and established a one-party system. Presidency In 1981, Hassan Gouled turned the country into a one party state by declaring that his party, the People's Rally for Progress (Rassemblement populaire pour le progr√®s, RPP), was the sole legal one. As the RPP candidate, he was elected without opposition for a six-year term as President on 12 June 1981, receiving 84.58% of the vote.\\"Sep 1981 - Re-election of President Hassan Gouled Aptidon - Cabinet Reorganization - Intensified Co-operation with North-East African Countries - Conclusion of Treaty of Friendship and Co-operation with Ethiopia\\", Keesing's Record of World Events, Volume 27, September, 1981 Djibouti, Page 31058. After the start of the Djiboutian Civil War in 1991, he allowed for a constitutional referendum on multiparty politics in September 1992, with four parties being permitted. In the parliamentary elections held in December 1992, only two parties competed, and the RPP won all 65 seats in the National Assembly. Gouled was reelected for a fourth term in May 1993 with 60.7% of the vote.Elections in Djibouti, African Elections Database. In the 1990s, the Djibouti economy deteriorated dramatically, with net external assets falling by 40 per cent.

An eternal flame is a flame, lamp or torch that burns for an indefinite time. Most eternal flames are ignited and tended intentionally, but some are natural phenomena caused by natural gas leaks, peat fires and coal seam fires, all of which can be initially ignited by lightning, piezoelectricity or human activity, some of which have burned for a long time. In ancient times, eternal flames were fueled by wood or olive oil; modern examples usually use a piped supply of propane or natural gas. They consume oxygen, transforming it to carbon dioxide. Human-created eternal flames most often commemorate a person or event of national significance, serve as a symbol of an enduring nature such as a religious belief, or a reminder of commitment to a common goal, such as diplomacy. The concept is the same as that of a candlelit vigil. Religious and cultural significance The eternal fire is a long-standing tradition in many cultures and religions. In ancient Iran the atar was tended by a dedicated priest and represented the concept of \\"divine sparks\\" or Amesha Spenta, as understood in Zoroastrianism. Period sources indicate that three \\"great fires\\" existed in the Achaemenid era of Persian history, which are collectively considered the earliest reference to the practice of creating ever-burning community fires. The eternal flame was a component of the Jewish religious rituals performed in the Tabernacle and later in the Temple in Jerusalem, where a commandment required a fire to burn continuously upon the Outer Altar.Leviticus 6:12: \\"And the fire upon the altar shall be burning in it; it shall not be put out: and the priest shall burn wood on it every morning, and lay the burnt offering in order upon it; and he shall burn thereon the fat of the peace offerings\\" Biblos Cross-referenced Holy Bible (King James version) Modern Judaism continues a similar tradition by having a sanctuary lamp, the ner tamid, always lit above the ark in the synagogue. After World War II, such flames gained further meaning, as a reminder of the six million Jews killed in the Holocaust. The Cherokee Nation maintained a fire at the seat of government until ousted by the Indian Removal Act in 1830. At that time, embers from the last great council fire were carried west to the nation's new home in the Oklahoma Territory. The flame, maintained in Oklahoma, was carried back to the last seat of the Cherokee government at Red Clay State Park in south-eastern Tennessee, to the Museum of the Cherokee Indian in Cherokee, North Carolina, and to the Cherokee Nation Tribal Complex in Talequah, Oklahoma.From the First Rising Sun: The Real Prehistory of the Cherokee People and Nation According to Oral Traditions, Legends, and Myths. Charla Jean Morris. Author House, Bloomington, IN: 2011. Page xvii. In China, it has at times been common to establish an eternally lit lamp as a visible aspect of ancestor veneration; it is set in front of a spirit tablet on the family's ancestral altar. Extinguished flames * One of the three \\"Great Flames\\" of the Achaemenid Empire was extinguished during the reign of Alexander the Great to honour the death of his close friend Hephaestion in 324 BC. * An eternal flame was kept burning in the inner hearth of the Temple of Delphic Apollo at Delphi in Greece until Delphi was sacked by the Roman general Sulla in 87 BC.Noted by Pausanias (10.24.5) in the second century CE and earlier mentioned by Herodotus (7.141) and Euripides (Iphigeneia in Tauris) * The Hebrew Bible commands that \\"The fire shall ever be burning upon the altar; it shall never go out\\" (Leviticus 6:5, JPS, regarding the altar of Burnt Offering in the Tabernacle, and later the altars in Solomon's Temple and the Second Temple (the latter sacked by Rome in 70 AD). Many churches (especially Catholic and Lutheran), along with Jewish synagogues, feature an eternal flame on or hung above their altars (churches) or Torah arks (synagogues). * The Sacred fire of Vesta in Ancient Rome, which burned within the Temple of Vesta on the Roman Forum, was extinguished in 394 AD. *The sacred fire of the Celtic goddess Brigid burned at Kildare, Ireland in pagan times and the fire was continued when the site was Christianised by Saint Brigid in the 5th century AD.

The gameplay consists of a mixture of action- adventure and driving in open world environments. Since the series began in 1999, there have been five main installments released. As of August 2011, the series has sold more than 16 million units worldwide. Games Driver The first game of the Driver series was released for the PlayStation on 25 June 1999 in Europe and 30 June in the U.S. It was later released for Game Boy Color in April 2000, Windows in September 2000, Mac in December 2000, and iOS in December 2009. In the game, the player controls a former racecar driver turned undercover police detective named John Tanner. It featured a storyline inspired by 1960's/70's car chase movies such as Bullitt (1968) and The Driver (1978) and based in four real-life cities; Miami, San Francisco, Los Angeles and New York City. It was the best selling game of the Driver series and an evolution of the freedom to explore a city as brought forth in the early Grand Theft Auto games. Driver 2 The second installment in the Driver series was released for the PlayStation on 13 November 2000 in the U.S. by Infogrames (now known as Atari), and later ported to the Game Boy Advance on 4 October 2002 in the U.S. It featured detective John Tanner once more, along with a new partner, detective Tobias Jones, in four more real-life cities (Chicago, Havana, Las Vegas, and Rio de Janeiro). It was the first game in the series to feature 2-player modes, curved roads, and the ability to get out of the car at any time (apart from while being in a pursuit from the police) in order to steal another car on the street. Driver 3 The third installment in the Driver series was released for the PlayStation 2 and Xbox on 21 June 2004 in the U.S. to generally mixed or poor reviews (despite new features such as the ability to use firearms). The game takes place in Miami, Nice and Istanbul. It was subsequently followed by versions for Windows, and Game Boy Advance.Driver 3 speeds onto the GBA - Game Boy Advance News at GameSpot Reflections later paid notice to the complaints about the insipid story line, poor controls, and abundance of glitches in order to improve the series' standings with critics and gamers in Driver: Parallel Lines. Driver: Parallel Lines The fourth game in the series, Driver: Parallel Lines, was released 14 March 2006 for PlayStation 2 and Xbox in the U.S., and 26 June 2007 for Windows and Wii in the U.S. Reflections intended Parallel Lines to \\"return the series to its roots\\" by focusing more on driving. The game differs greatly in other aspects from its predecessors, though, as the story no longer follows undercover police officer Tanner and the game takes place in only one location, New York City. The new main player's name is TK, a criminal rather than a cop. The game includes two time periods, 1978 and 2006, when the main player is sentenced to prison for 28 years and returns in 2006. The game received better reviews, but unlike Driver 3, did not sell particularly well. Driver 76 Driver 76 is a PlayStation Portable game in the Driver series. Set in New York City in 1976, two years before the events in the first half of Driver: Parallel Lines, the player takes the role of Ray, TK's friend and a supporting character from Parallel Lines. The game was developed by Sumo Digital and Reflections, and was the first Driver game published by Ubisoft after they acquired Reflections. It was released on 8 May 2007 in the U.S. Driver: San Francisco The fifth Driver game was long rumored to be in production. After several years of speculation, Ubisoft unveiled Driver: San Francisco at E3 2010. After several delays, it was released on 1 September 2011 in Australia. The game takes place in one location, San Francisco, and follows the series protagonist, Tanner, being in a coma after suffering an accident. Thus, the player controls Tanner during his coma dream. The plot of the Wii version of Driver: San Francisco is completely different from the other versions. It is a prequel to the events of the original Driver. For the game, developers decided to remove the ability to get out of a car in order to steal another car on the street. Instead, they created a new mechanic called \\"Shift\\", enabling the players to shift to any car at any time. The game received generally positive reviews, getting the highest ratings in the whole series after Driver. Like Driver 3, it sold particularly well. Driver: Renegade 3D A Nintendo 3DS game, Driver: Renegade 3D follows John Tanner trying to take down the New York City crime mobs. It was released in 2011. Driver: Speedboat Paradise A free-to-play smartphone game released on iOS and Android in December 2014. The game, which makes use of in-app purchases, revolves solely around missions on speedboats.https://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2015-04-09-driver-speedboat- paradise-is-out-now-on-mobile-devices Novels Driver: Nemesis, a novel written by Alex Sharp, was published in 2010 to coincide with the release of Driver: San Francisco. The novel is a sequel to Driver 2 and a prequel to the events of Driver: San Francisco, taking place at some point before Hurricane Katrina. The story follows John Tanner's undercover infiltration to a crime network in New Orleans. It features several characters from the first two games and provides additional backstory for Tanner's life prior to becoming a member of law enforcement. Related games Driver: Vegas (released in 2006) and Driver: LA Undercover (released in 2007) are two mobile games featuring John Tanner. Vegas features his exploits in Las Vegas in an attempt to exact revenge on Charles Jericho after Driver 3, while LA Undercover, set two years later, features Tanner's exploits in Los Angeles to take down the Los Angeles Mafia by working his way up the ladder. C.O.P. The Recruit On 3 November 2009, Ubisoft released C.O.P. The Recruit for Nintendo DS. It was originally registered under numerous names, one of which being \\"Driver: The Recruit\\". Watch Dogs The Disrupt engine for Watch Dogs was originally intended for a different game focused on driving, potentially in the Driver franchise. Ubisoft Reflections staff who had previously worked on Driver: San Francisco and Driver: Parallel Lines, were working with Ubisoft Montreal on the development of Watch Dogs. Film adaptation In February 2002, Impact Pictures, the production team of Paul W. S. Anderson and Jeremy Bolt, announced that it had acquired the film and TV rights to adapt the Atari video game Driver. Screenwriters James DeMonaco, Todd Jason Harthan, and James Roday were developing a script at the time. Impact Pictures had originally intended to produce the film Driver to coincide with the release of the video game Driver 3. The following November, Impact Pictures announced its plans to produce a $50 million adaptation of Driver after wrapping up principal photography on Resident Evil: Apocalypse. In April 2006, Rogue Pictures acquired the film rights to Driver from Impact Pictures and Constantin Films, the production companies responsible for the Resident Evil film franchise. Roger Avary replaced the original screenwriters in writing the script for Driver, as well as directing the film. Prior to January 2007, Driver, having a budget of $48 million, was slated to shoot at Cinespace Studios' MT28 lot in Toronto, Ontario, Canada. Due to a waterfront revitalization project, the studio was forced to move and the film was put on hold. In May 2009, the movie script was leaked on the internet.

Zimbabwe Cricket is a full member of the International Cricket Council (ICC), and administers the Zimbabwe national cricket team, organising Test tours, One-Day Internationals and Twenty20 Internationals with other nations. It also organises domestic cricket, including the Castle Logan Cup, the Coca-Cola Metbank Pro50 Championship and the Stanbic Bank 20 Series in Zimbabwe. In July 2019, the ICC suspended Zimbabwe Cricket, with the team barred from taking part in ICC events, which put their participation in the 2019 ICC Women's World Twenty20 Qualifier and the 2019 ICC T20 World Cup Qualifier tournaments in doubt. Later the same month, the ICC wrote to Zimbabwe Cricket, instructing them to reinstate their board that was elected on 14 June 2019, or risk the termination of their ICC membership. In October 2019, the ICC lifted its suspension on Zimbabwe Cricket, allowing them to take part in future ICC events. History Zimbabwe cricket went through major upheaval during the 2000s. During the 2003 Cricket World Cup, senior team members Andy Flower and Henry Olonga staged their \\"black armband protest\\" at the \\"death of democracy\\" in Zimbabwe, a reference to the country's political situation. Both players subsequently retired from international cricket. In 2004, the majority of the remaining senior players quit the international game following a player protest triggered by the removal of then-captain Heath Streak, resulting in a very young and inexperienced side being fielded in subsequent series against Sri Lanka and Australia. Zimbabwe's resounding defeats in those series led to the withdrawal of Test status that, apart from a brief resumption in 2005 with series against South Africa, New Zealand and India, remained in place until early 2011. Recent improvements in Zimbabwe's on-field performances, including a notable victory over Australia in the 2007 ICC World Twenty20 group stages and an overhaul of coaching staff has, however, led to the side's Test status being reinstated, with matches now planned against Bangladesh, Pakistan and New Zealand in late 2011.http://sandbox.zimcricketnews.com/?q=2006/06/14/upcoming-fixtures In February 2017, Zimbabwe Cricket confirmed that an academy side would tour England later that year to play fixtures against second XI sides, including Northamptonshire and Worcestershire. The following players were selected for the squad: Ryan Burl, Tinashe Kamunhukamwe, Taffy Mupariwa, Tafadzwa Tsiga, Tarisai Musakanda, Tylor Trenoweth, William Mashinge, Faraz Akram, Carl Mumba, Blessing Muzarabani, Tendai Nyamayaro, Mkhululi Nyathi, Richard Ngarava, Kuziva Ziwira, Thamsanqa Nunu and Brandon Mavuta. In September 2018, the former national team coach Heath Streak submitted an application to the court to have Zimbabwe Cricket liquidated, in relation to outstanding debts. Return to Test cricket As part of the lead-up to their Test return, Zimbabwe Cricket announced major upgrades to the Harare Sports Club and Mutare Sports Club grounds.http://www.cricinfo.com/zimbabwe/content/story/481066.html Plans for a new Test ground at Victoria Falls were also revealed.http://www.cricinfo.com/zimbabwe/content/story/465632.html ZC also signed a three-year deal with Reebok worth $1mn. The deal will see Reebok sponsor the Domestic competitions and provide the kits of the Zimbabwean national cricket team. http://www.cricinfo.com/zimbabwe/content/story/484154.html Zimbabwe v. Bangladesh Zimbabwe played their first Test match, after regaining their Test status, against Bangladesh at the Harare Sports Club in Harare. The only Test started on Thursday 4 August 2011. Bangladesh won the toss and elected to field first. Zimbabwe won the Test on day five by 130 runs.

Biography Robert S. Shankland was an undergraduate at the Case School for Applied Sciences from 1925‚Äì1929 and received his master's degree in 1933. He completed his Ph.D. degree in 1935 for work on photon scattering with Arthur Compton at the University of Chicago. His other research included work on the ionosphere and standard frequency regulations from 1929‚Äì1930 with the US National Bureau of Standards, and worked in England on sonar for submarine warfare early in World War II. Shankland's report on the Albert A. Michelson's Irvine Ranch experiments was published in 1953. In the British journal Nature, Shankland gave the historical background of how Einstein formulates the first two principles, in 1905, of the special theory of relativity from the Michelson‚ÄìMorley experiment. Shankland believed that the accepted direct explanation for the Michelson‚ÄìMorley experiment is provided by the special theory of relativity given by Einstein in 1905. Shankland recorded that Michelson's Santa Ana trip was to look at the science of the aether. After completing graduate studies he joined the faculty at Case School for Applied Sciences. In 1941 he succeeded Dayton C. Miller as the Ambrose Swasey Professor of Physics at Case, a position he held until his retirement in 1976. Shankland worked on neutrino experiments with Argonne National Laboratory from 1953‚Äì1969, and had other interests including the history of relativity and architectural acoustics. He collaborated with George Szell, the director of the Cleveland Orchestra, to improve the acoustics of Severance Hall, making it easier for musicians to hear each other on the stage. Shankland's father, Frank North Shankland, was the author of \\"Modern Romances\\" and several books on birds and animals. In 1929 Shankland married Hilda Catherine Kinneson. They had five children: Ruth Ellen, Dorothy Margaret, Lois Virginia, Ava Gertrude, and Sherwood Jean, and 14 grandchildren. Hilda died in 1970 and he married Eleanor Newlin. Shankland was a passionate outdoorsman and a knowledgeable collector of iron animal traps and Native American artifacts. Analysis of the Miller experiment Beginning in 1952, Shankland led a team that performed an analysis of Dayton Miller's interferometric results, and concluded that Miller's reported positive ether drift was likely caused by thermal fluctuations, and that, when this is taken into account, the results were consistent with special relativity. Shankland's explanation is now accepted by most mainstream scientists. In 1925‚Äì1926, Dayton Miller performed interferometric observations at Mount Wilson, similar to the Michelson‚ÄìMorley experiment, that appeared to reflect a measurable drift of the Earth through the luminiferous aether, in apparent contradiction with other experiments of that type and with relativity's prediction that no aether should be observable. In 1955, Shankland published a paper analyzing Miller's data, arguing that \\"the small periodic fringe displacements found by Miller are due in part to statistical fluctuations in the readings of the fringe positions in a very difficult experiment\\" and \\"the remaining systematic effects are ascribed to local temperature conditions.\\" Moreover, he argues that the thermal gradients responsible for the effects \\"were much more troublesome at Mount Wilson than those encountered by experimenters elsewhere, including Miller himself in his work done at Case in Cleveland.\\" In a 1973 review paper on the experimental development of relativity, Shankland included an August 31, 1954 letter to him by Einstein agreeing with his analysis. (Shankland had sent Einstein a manuscript prior to its publication.) Einstein wrote: :I thank you very much for sending me your careful study about the Miller experiments. Those experiments, conducted with so much care, merit, of course, a very careful statistical investigation. This is more so as the existence of a not trivial positive effect would affect very deeply the fundament of theoretical physics as it is presently accepted. :You have shown convincingly that the observed effect is outside the range of accidental deviations and must, therefore, have a systematic cause. You made it quite probable that this systematic cause has nothing to do with \\"ether-wind,\\" but has to do with differences of temperature of the air traversed by the two light bundles which produced the bands of interference. Such an effect is indeed practically inevitable if the walls of the laboratory room have a not negligible difference in temperature. :It is one of the cases where the systematic errors are increasing quickly with the dimension of the apparatus. In Shankland's re-analysis, no statistically significant signal for the existence of aether was found. The analysis is accepted by mainstream physicists, the abandonment of the concept of the aether is nearly universal, and Miller's observed signal is believed the result of experimenter's bias; the \\"signal\\" that Miller observed in 1933 is actually composed of points that are an average of several hundred measurements each, and the magnitude of the signal is more than 10 times smaller than the resolution with which the measurements were recorded. Though Maurice Allais and James DeMeo do not accept Shankland's refutation and hold to the belief that Miller's experiment invalidates the theory of relativity, Einstein's theory is today regarded by most physicists as proven, based largely on the vastly more accurate repetitions of Miller's measurements made using modern optical technology by numerous independent researchers that have shown conclusively that Miller's reported positive signal was spurious. Miller's data, and Shankland's analysis of it, are now of only historical interest.  External links and references  * AIP International Catalog of Sources, summary of Robert S.

The screenplay by Bo Goldman, Kevin Wade, Ron Osborn and Jeff Reno is loosely based on the 1934 film Death Takes a Holiday. It was the second pairing of Hopkins and Pitt after their 1994 film Legends of the Fall. The film received mixed reviews from critics. It grossed $143 million worldwide. Plot Billionaire media mogul Bill Parrish is considering a merger between his company and another media giant and is about to celebrate his 65th birthday with an elaborate party planned by his eldest daughter, Allison. His youngest daughter, Susan, a resident in internal medicine, is in a relationship with one of Bill's board members, Drew. She is considering marriage, but Bill can tell that she is not passionately in love. When she asks for the short version of his impassioned speech, he simply says, \\"Stay open. Who knows? Lightning could strike!\\". When their company helicopter lands, he begins to hear a mysterious voice, which he tries with increasing difficulty to ignore. Susan meets a vibrant young man at a coffee shop. He takes an interest in her and tells her that lightning may strike. She is enamored but parts without getting his name. Unbeknownst to her, the man is struck by multiple cars in a possibly fatal collision. Death arrives at Bill's home in the uninjured body of the young man, explaining that Bill's impassioned speech has piqued his interest. Given Bill's \\"competence, experience, and wisdom\\", Death says that for as long as Bill will be his guide on Earth, Bill will not have to die. Making up a name on the spot, Death is introduced to the family as \\"Joe Black\\". Bill's best efforts to navigate the next few days, knowing them now to be his last, fail to keep events from going rapidly out of his control. Drew is secretly conspiring with a man bidding for Parrish Communications. He capitalizes on Bill's strange behavior and unexplained reliance on Joe to convince the board of directors to vote Bill out as chairman, using information given to him inadvertently by Bill's son-in-law, Quince, to push through approval for the merger which Bill had decided to oppose. Quince is devastated. Susan is confused by the appearance of Joe, believing him to be the young man from the coffee shop, but eventually falls deeply in love with him. Joe is now under the influence of human desires and becomes attracted to her as well. After they make love, Joe asks Susan, \\"What do we do now?\\" She replies, \\"It'll come to us\\". Bill angrily confronts Joe about his relationship with his daughter, but Joe declares his intention to take Susan with him for his own. As his last birthday arrives, Bill appeals to Joe to recognize the meaning of true love and all it encompasses, especially honesty and sacrifice. Joe comes to understand that he must set aside his own desire and allow Susan to live her life. He also helps Bill regain control of his company, exposing Drew's underhanded business dealings to the board by claiming to be an agent of the Internal Revenue Service and threatening to put Drew in jail. At the party, Bill makes his peace with his daughters. Susan tells Joe that she has loved him ever since that day in the coffee shop. Joe realizes that Susan loves the unknown man, not him, and the realization crushes him slightly. Mastering his emotions powerfully he balks at telling Susan who he really is, although she seems to intuit his true identity. Struggling to comprehend the magnitude of the situation, Susan cannot label Joe as Death. She says finally, \\"You're, you're Joe\\". He promises her \\"you will always have what you found in the coffee shop\\". On a hillock in the grounds above the party, Bill expresses trepidation, asking \\"Should I be afraid?\\", Joe replies \\"Not a man like you\\". Fireworks explode in the distance while Susan watches Joe and her father walk out of view. Susan is stunned as \\"Joe\\" reappears alone, bewildered, this time as the young man from the coffee shop. He is uninjured and cannot account for how he got there. Susan accepts that her father is gone, and rekindles the romantic spark she had shared with the young man. \\"What do we do now?\\" she asks. \\"It'll come to us\\", Joe replies, as the two of them descend hand-in-hand towards the twinkling lights of the party. Cast Locations Most of William Parrish's country mansion scenes were shot at the Aldrich Mansion in Rhode Island. The penthouse interiors and Parrish Communications offices were sets built at the 14th Regiment Armory in the South Slope neighborhood in Brooklyn, New York. The place where Susan and the Young Man from the Coffee Shop first meet is Broadway Restaurant, at 2664 Broadway and West 101st Street, Manhattan. Box office Meet Joe Black opened on November 13, 1998, and grossed $15,017,995 domestically upon its opening weekend (11/13-15) at #3, behind The Waterboys second weekend and the opening of I Still Know What You Did Last Summer. While the film had a disappointing domestic box office return of $44,619,100, it fared much better overseas. Taking in an additional $98,321,000, the movie grossed a worldwide total of $142,940,100. As Meet Joe Black was one of the few films showing the first trailer for Star Wars: Episode I ‚Äì The Phantom Menace, it was reported that droves of Star Wars fans bought tickets for the film, only to leave after the trailer showed. Critical response Meet Joe Black received mixed reviews from critics, with most complimenting the performances but criticizing the film's three-hour length, the slow pacing and the screenplay. Roger Ebert gave it three stars, but disliked the peripheral story lines and overly drawn-out ending. He concluded that despite its flaws, \\"there's so much that's fine in this movie\\". Peter Travers of Rolling Stone thought that most of the characters were one- dimensional. Anthony Hopkins received uniform praise for his performance, with Travers opining that Hopkins' Bill Parrish was the only fully realized character in the film; Mick LaSalle commented that \\"Hopkins' acting is so emotionally full that the tiniest moments...ring with complexities of thought and feeling.\\" Brad Pitt, on the other hand, received a mixed response, with LaSalle calling the performance so bad \\"it hurts\\" and James Berardinelli calling it \\"execrable\\". The film has a 53% \\"Rotten\\" response from Rotten Tomatoes, with the site's consensus calling the film \\"Glacially slow, [and] uneventful.\\" It earned a Razzie Award nomination for Worst Remake or Sequel. Edited version A two-hour version was made to show on television and airline flights, by cutting most of the plotline involving Bill Parrish's business. Since Brest derided this edit of his film and disowned it, the director's credit was changed to the Hollywood pseudonym Alan Smithee.

Biography  Lowe attended Arnold School, an independent school in his home town of Blackpool, Lancashire. Whilst at school, Lowe played trombone in a seven-piece dance band called One Under the Eight, that played old-time favourites like \\"Hello Dolly\\", \\"La Bamba\\" and \\"Moon River\\". Lowe's grandfather had been a trombonist and was a member of comedy jazz troupe The Nitwits. Lowe also became a skilled pianist. Lowe studied architecture at the University of Liverpool from 1978 but never graduated, as he stated various times on television appearances and the Life in Pop documentary, due to the formation of the Pet Shop Boys. During a work placement in 1981 at a London architectural practice, he designed a staircase for an industrial estate in Milton Keynes. It was at this time that he met Neil Tennant in a hi-fi shop on the Kings Road in London.  Musical career  Pet Shop Boys Lowe generally performs as the Pet Shop Boys' keyboardist; he occasionally provides spoken-word vocals. On the song \\"I Want A Lover\\" Lowe played trombone, which he studied at school. Solo appearances In 1993 he wrote and produced the track \\"Do the Right Thing\\" for the footballer Ian Wright (Lowe is a passionate Arsenal F.C. fan). The song featured backing vocals by the long-time Pet Shop Boys' backing singer, Sylvia Mason-James, and the single featured remixes by Rollo. Two years later, Lowe had a cameo in the Australian soap opera Neighbours. His appearance was filmed whilst Pet Shop Boys were touring that country. In 2004, he was commissioned to do music for an advertisement for the sunscreen brand Blockhead. The song ended up in a remixed version on a \\"Caf√© Mambo\\" chill-out compilation. Two years later, he wrote the music for the song \\"Streets of Berlin\\", featured in the revival of Bent at the Trafalgar Studios in Whitehall. In 2011, Lowe appeared as featured vocalist on Stop Modernists's cover version of the New Order song \\"Subculture\\". This was the first time he had appeared as vocals on a non-Pet Shop Boys' project. Public appearance Lowe is well known for his understated public presence, often wearing sportswear and with his eyes invisible behind sunglasses. In Pet Shop Boys videos and photoshoots he is often seen looking on as a spectator standing slightly behind Tennant. In live performances he rarely interacts with the audience and often stands still while playing keyboards.

The mesocortical pathway is a dopaminergic pathway that connects the ventral tegmentum to the prefrontal cortex. It is one of the four major dopamine pathways in the brain. It is essential to the normal cognitive function of the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (part of the frontal lobe), and is thought to be involved in cognitive control, motivation, and emotional response. This pathway may be the brain system that is abnormal or functioning abnormally in psychoses, such as schizophrenia.Diaz, Jaime. How Drugs Influence Behavior. Englewood Cliffs: Prentice Hall, 1996. It is thought to be associated with the negative symptoms of schizophrenia, which include avolition, alogia and flat affect.

The grain was historically gathered and eaten in North America and China. While now a delicacy in North America, the grain is eaten less in China, where the plant's stem is used as a vegetable. While more widely known in English as wild rice, manomin is not classified as a rice but rather a cereal. Wild rice is not directly related to Asian rice (Oryza sativa), whose wild progenitors are O. rufipogon and O. nivara, although they are close cousins, sharing the tribe Oryzeae. Wild-rice grains have a chewy outer sheath with a tender inner grain that has a slightly vegetal taste. The plants grow in shallow water in small lakes and slow-flowing streams; often, only the flowering head of wild rice rises above the water. The grain is eaten by dabbling ducks and other aquatic wildlife.  Species  Three species of wild rice are native to North America: * Northern wild rice (Zizania palustris) is an annual plant native to the Great Lakes region of North America, the aquatic areas of the Boreal Forest regions of Northern Ontario, Alberta, Saskatchewan and Manitoba in Canada and Minnesota, Wisconsin, Michigan and Idaho in the US. * Wild rice (Z. aquatica), also an annual, grows in the Saint Lawrence River, the state of Florida, and on the Atlantic and Gulf coasts of the United States. * Texas wild rice (Z. texana) is a perennial plant found only in a small area along the San Marcos River in central Texas. One species is native to Asia: * Manchurian wild rice (Z. latifolia; incorrect synonym: Z. caduciflora) is a perennial native to China. Texas wild rice is in danger of extinction due to loss of suitable habitat in its limited range and to pollution. The pollen of Texas wild rice can only travel about 30 inches away from a parent plant. If pollen does not land on a receptive female flower within that distance, no seeds are produced.Pollination Habits of Endangered Rice Revealed to Help Preservation Newswise, Retrieved on July 15, 2008. Manchurian wild rice has almost disappeared from the wild in its native range, but has been accidentally introduced into the wild in New Zealand and is considered an invasive species there.  Use as food  Harvesting wild rice. The species most commonly harvested as grain are the annual species: Zizania palustris and Zizania aquatica. The former, though now domesticated and grown commercially, is still often gathered from lakes in the traditional manner, especially by indigenous peoples in North America; the latter was also used extensively in the past.Moerman, Daniel, Native American Ethnobotany (Timber Press, Portland Oregon 1998), p. 614.  Use by Native Americans  Native Americans and others harvest wild rice by canoeing into a stand of plants, and bending the ripe grain heads with two small wooden poles/sticks called \\"knockers\\" or \\"flails\\", so as to thresh the seeds into the canoe. One person vans (or \\"knocks\\") rice into the canoe while the other paddles slowly or uses a push pole. The plants are not beaten with the knockers, but require only a gentle brushing to dislodge the mature grain. Some seeds fall to the muddy bottom and germinate later in the year. The size of the knockers, as well as other details, are prescribed in state and tribal law. By Minnesota statute, knockers must be at most diameter, long, and weight. Ojibwa wild rice pouch, cedar bark, American Museum of Natural History Several Native American cultures, such as the Ojibwa, consider wild rice to be a sacred component in their culture. The Ojibwa people call this plant manoomin, meaning \\"harvesting berry\\" (commonly translated \\"good berry\\"). Tribes that are recorded as historically harvesting Zizania aquatica are the Dakota, Menominee, Meskwaki, Ojibwa, Omaha, Ponca, Thompson, and Ho-Chunk (Winnebago). Native people who utilized Zizania palustris are the Chippewa/Ojibwa, Ottawa/Odawa and Potawatomi. Ways of preparing it varied from stewing the grains with deer broth and/or maple syrup, made into stuffings for wild birds, or even steaming it into sweets like puffed rice, or rice pudding sweetened with maple syrup. For these groups, the harvest of wild rice is an important cultural (and often economic) event. The Menominee tribe were named Omanoominii by the neighboring Ojibwa after this plant. Many places in Illinois, Indiana, Manitoba, Michigan, Minnesota, Ontario, Saskatchewan, and Wisconsin are named after this plant, including Mahnomen, Minnesota and Menomonie, Wisconsin; many lakes and streams bear the name \\"Rice\\", \\"Wildrice\\", \\"Wild Rice\\", or \\"Zizania\\".  Commercialisation  Because of its nutritional value and taste, wild rice increased in popularity in the late 20th century, and commercial cultivation began in the U.S. and Canada to supply the increased demand. In 1950, James and Gerald Godward started experimenting with wild rice in a one-acre meadow north of Brainerd, Minnesota. They constructed dikes around the acre, dug ditches for drainage, and put in water controls. In the fall, they tilled the soil. Then, in the spring of 1951, they acquired of seed from Wildlife Nurseries Inc. They scattered the seed onto the soil, diked it in, and flooded the paddy. Much to their surprise, since they were told wild rice needs flowing water to grow well, the seeds sprouted and produced a crop. They continued to experiment with wild rice throughout the early 1950s and were the first to officially cultivate the previously wild crop.Oelke, Ervin. Saga of the Grain. 2007\\\\. pp.29-33. In the United States, the main producers are California and Minnesota (where it is the official state grain), and it is mainly cultivated in paddy fields. In Canada, it is usually harvested from natural bodies of water; the largest producer is Saskatchewan. Wild rice is also produced in Hungary and Australia. In Hungary, cultivation started in 1974 on the rice field of Szarvas.  Manchurian wild rice  Manchurian wild rice (), gathered from the wild, was once an important grain in ancient China. It is now very rare in the wild, and its use as a grain has completely disappeared in China, though it continues to be cultivated for its stems. Wild rice stems before and after peeling. The swollen crisp white stems of Manchurian wild rice are grown as a vegetable, popular in East and Southeast Asia. The swelling occurs because of infection with the smut fungus Ustilago esculenta. The fungus prevents the plant from flowering, so the crop is propagated asexually, the infection being passed from mother plant to daughter plant. Harvest must be made between about 120 days and 170 days after planting, after the stem begins to swell, but before the infection reaches its reproductive stage, when the stem will begin to turn black and eventually disintegrate into fungal spores. The vegetable is especially common in China, where it is known as gƒÅos«în (È´òÁ≠ç) or jiƒÅob√°i (Ëå≠ÁôΩ). Other names which may be used in English include coba and water bamboo. Importation of the vegetable to the United States is prohibited in order to protect North American species from the smut fungus.  Nutrition  Cooked wild rice. Typically sold as a dried whole grain, wild rice is relatively high in protein, the amino acid lysine and dietary fiber, and low in fat. Nutritional analysis shows wild rice to be the grain second only to oats in protein content per 100 calories. Like true rice, it does not contain gluten. It is also a good source of certain minerals and B vitamins. One cup of cooked wild rice provides 5% or more of the daily value of thiamin, riboflavin, iron, and potassium; 10% or more of the daily value of niacin, Vitamin b6, folate, magnesium, phosphorus; 15% of zinc; and over 20% of manganese.  Safety  Wild rice seeds can be infected by the highly toxic fungus ergot, which is dangerous if eaten. Infected grains have pink or purplish blotches or growths of the fungus, from the size of a seed to several times larger.Peterson, Lee, A Field Guide to Edible Wild Plants of Eastern and Central North America (Houghton Mifflin Company, New York City), p. 228.  Archaeology of Minnesota wild rice  Food source Anthropologists since the early 1900s have focused on wild rice as a food source, often with an emphasis on the harvesting of the aquatic plant in the Lake Superior region by the Anishinaabe people, also known as the Chippewa, Ojibwa and Ojibwe (Densmore 1929: 128). The Smithsonian Institution's Bureau of American Ethnology published \\"The Wild Rice Gatherers in the Upper Great Lakes: A Study in American Primitive Economics\\" by Albert Ernest Jenks in 1901. In addition to his fieldwork interviewing members of various tribal communities, Jenks examined the accounts of explorers, fur traders and government agents from the early 1600s to the late 1800s to detail an \\"aboriginal economic activity which is absolutely unique, and in which no article is employed not of aboriginal conception and workmanship\\" (Jenks 1901: 1019). His study further notes wild rice's importance in the fur-trading era because the region would have been nearly inaccessible if not for the availability of wild rice and the ability to store it for long periods of time (Jenks 1901: 1019). Wild rice's social and economic importance has continued into present times for the Anishinaabe and other north woods tribal members despite the availability of more easily obtainable food sources (Vennum 1988: 58‚Äì80). Processing by various cultures This continued use of wild rice from ancient to modern times has provided opportunities to examine the plant's processing by various cultures through the archaeological record they left behind during their occupation of seasonal ricing camps. Early ethnographic reports, tribal accounts and historical writings also inform archaeological research in the human use of wild rice. For example, geographer and ethnologist Henry Schoolcraft in the mid-1800s wrote about depressions in the ground on the shore of a lake with wild rice growing in the water. He wrote that wild rice processors placed animal hides in the holes, filled them with rice and stomped on the rice to thresh it (Jenks 1901: 1067). These jigging pits are part of the husking needed to process wild rice, and archaeologists see these holes in the soil stratigraphy in archaeological excavations today. Such historical records from the post-contact period in the Lake Superior region focus on Anishinaabe harvesting and processing techniques. Archaeological investigations of wild rice processing from the American era, before and after the creation of federal Indian reservations, also provide information on the loss of traditional harvesting areas, as 1800s fur trader and Indian interpreter Benjamin G. Armstrong wrote about outsiders \\"who claimed to have acquired title to all the swamps and overflowed lakes on the reservations, depriving the Indians of their rice fields, cranberry marshes and hay meadows\\" (Armstrong 1892: 81). Despite the close association of the Anishinaabe and wild rice today, indigenous use of this food for subsistence also predates their arrival in the Lake Superior region. The Anishinaabe today were part of a larger Algonquian group who left eastern North America on a centuries-long journey to the west along the St. Lawrence River and Great Lakes. The Anishinaabe migration story details a vision to follow a giant clam shell in the sky to a place where the food grows on the water. This journey ended between the late 1400s and early 1600s in the Lake Superior wild rice country when they encountered the plant (Warren 1885: 76‚Äì95). Prehistory Archaeological and other scientific investigations have focused on the prehistoric exploitation of wild rice by humans, including: 1) the Anishinaabe, 2) so-called proto-Anishinaabe who may have later transformed into this culture from an earlier form, 3) other indigenous groups who exist today such as the Sioux people, and 4) archaeological-categorized cultures from the Initial and Terminal Woodland periods whose living lineages today are more difficult to identify. A seminal 1969 archaeological study indicated the prehistoric nature of indigenous wild rice harvesting and processing through radiocarbon dating, putting to rest argument made by some European-Americans that wild rice production did not begin until post-contact times. Researchers tested clay linings of thermal features and jigging pits associated with parching and threshing of the plant. But a more precise dating of the antiquity of human use of wild rice and the appearance of the plant itself in lakes and streams have been the subjects of continuing academic debates. These disputes may be framed around these questions: When did wild rice first appear in various areas of the region? When was it plentiful enough to be harvested in quantities to be a significant food source? What is the relationship of wild rice to the introduction of pottery and to increases in indigenous populations in the past 2,000 years? \\"The use of wild rice by and its influence on prehistoric people in northeast Minnesota has led to much argument among archaeologists and paleoecologists\\" (Huber 2001: 2). As an example, archaeologists divide human occupation of northeast Minnesota into numerous time periods. They are: the Paleo-Indian period from 7,000 years ago (5000 BC) extending back to an uncertain time after the glaciers receded from the last Ice Age; the Archaic period from 2,500 to 7,000 years ago (5000‚Äì500 BC); the Initial Woodland period from 2,500 to 1,300 years ago (500 BC‚Äì700 AD); the Terminal Woodland period from 1,300 to 400 years ago (700‚Äì1600 AD); and the historical period after that time. (Huber 2001: 34‚Äì52). These rough dates are open to debate and vary by location in the state. In general, two lines of inquiry have focused on archaeological wild rice: 1) The radiocarbon dating of charred wild rice seeds or the associated charcoal left behind during the parching stage of rice production, and 2) Examination of preserved wild rice seeds associated with specific prehistoric pottery styles found in excavations of processing sites. Different pottery styles in northern Minnesota are linked to certain times in the Initial and Terminal Woodland periods stretching from around 500 BC to the time of contact between indigenous peoples and Europeans. To place this in context, \\"Although ceramics may have appeared as early as 2,000 BC in the southeastern United States, it is about 1,500 years later that they became evident in the Midwest\\" (Anfinson 1979). After European contact, indigenous wild rice processors generally abandoned ceramic vessels in favor of metal kettles (Hilger 1951/1992: 148). Woodland period The Initial Woodland period in northeast Minnesota marks the beginning of the use of pottery and burial mound building in the archaeological record. The Initial Woodland also experienced an increase in indigenous population. One hypothesis is that wild rice as a food source was related to these three developments (Valppu 1989: 1). An example of a northeast Minnesota wild rice location, the Big Rice site in the Superior National Forest, considered a classic Initial and Terminal Woodland period type site, illustrates the methods of archaeological investigations into the plant's use by humans through time. Archaeological techniques along with ethnographic records and tribal oral testimony, when taken together, suggest use of this particular lakeside site since 50 BC. On its own, accelerator mass spectrometry (AMS) radiocarbon dating of wild rice seeds and charcoal samples from the Big Rice itself indicated indigenous use of this site dating to 2,050 years ago. Furthermore, all excavation levels that solely contained ceramics only used during the Initial Woodland period (known as Laurel pottery complex) also included wild rice seeds. This indicated the use of wild rice during the Initial Woodland period, according to the study (Valppu and Rapp 2000: 86). Excavators have documented more than 50,000 pottery shards from the site from the Initial and Terminal Woodland periods. Specifically, researchers analyzed ceramic rimsherds of Laurel pottery from the Initial Woodland period and Blackduck, Sandy Lake and Selkirk pottery styles from the Terminal Woodland period (Shafer 2003: ii, 1). Each pottery type had wild rice seeds associated with it in the soil layers of archaeological deposits. These soil layers were not contaminated with pottery from other eras. This suggests intensive exploitation of the site for wild rice processing through these time periods by different cultures. For example, archaeologists often associate Sandy Lake pottery with the Sioux people, who were later displaced by the Anishinaabe and possibly other Algonquian migrants. Archaeologists often associate Selkirk pottery with the Cree people, an Algonquian group. An examination of the pollen sequence at Big Rice indicates that wild rice existed in \\"harvestable quantities\\" 3,600 years ago during the Archaic period. This date is 1,600 years before the AMS radiocarbon date of human-processed charred wild rice seeds at the site during the Initial Woodland period, although there is no archaeological evidence of human use of the wild rice at the site that far back in time as yet (Huber 2001; 1‚Äì2).  Ornamental use  Wild rice is also grown as an ornamental plant in garden ponds.

It is one of the treatments of choice for Prinzmetal angina. It may be used to treat severe high blood pressure in pregnancy. Its use in preterm labor may allow more time for steroids to improve the baby's lung function and provide time for transfer of the mother to a well qualified medical facility before delivery. It is a calcium channel blocker of the dihydropyridine type. Nifedipine is taken by mouth and comes in fast and slow release formulations. Common side effects include lightheadedness, headache, feeling tired, leg swelling, cough, and shortness of breath. Serious side effects may include low blood pressure and heart failure. There is tentative evidence that its use in pregnancy is safe; however, it is not recommended during breastfeeding. Nifedipine was patented in 1967, and approved for use in the United States in 1981. It is on the World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines. It is available as a generic medication. In 2017, it was the 120th most commonly prescribed medication in the United States, with more than six million prescriptions. Medical uses High blood pressure The approved uses are for the long-term treatment of hypertension and angina pectoris. In hypertension, recent clinical guidelines generally favour diuretics and ACE inhibitors, although calcium channel antagonists, along with thiazide diuretics, are still favoured as primary treatment for patients over 55 and black patients.Hypertension: management of hypertension in adults in primary care. Clinical guideline CG34. National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE), June 2006. Fulltext index . . Nifedipine given as sublingual administration has previously been used in hypertensive emergencies. It was once frequently prescribed on an as-needed basis to patients taking MAOIs for real or perceived hypertensive crises. This was found to be dangerous, and has been abandoned. Sublingual administration of nifedipine promotes a hypotensive effect via peripheral vasodilation. It can cause an uncontrollable decrease in blood pressure, reflex tachycardia, and a steal phenomenon in certain vascular beds. There have been multiple reports in the medical literature of serious adverse effects with sublingual nifedipine, including cerebral ischemia/infarction, myocardial infarction, complete heart block, and death. As a result of this, in 1985 the FDA reviewed all data regarding the safety and effectiveness of sublingual nifedipine for the management of hypertensive emergencies, and concluded that the practice should be abandoned because it was neither safe nor effective. An exception to the avoidance of this practice is in the use of nifedipine for the treatment of hypertension associated with autonomic dysreflexia in spinal cord injury. Early labor Nifedipine has been used frequently as a tocolytic (agent that delays premature labor). A Cochrane review has concluded that it has benefits over placebo or no treatment for prolongation of pregnancy. It also has benefits over beta-agonists and may also have some benefits over atosiban and magnesium sulfate, although atosiban results in fewer maternal adverse effects. No difference was found in the rate of deaths among babies around the time of birth, while data on longer-term outcomes is lacking. Other Raynaud's phenomenon is often treated with nifedipine. A 2005 meta-analysis showed modest benefits (33% decrease in attack severity, 2.8-5 reduction in absolute number of attacks per week); it does conclude that most included studies used low doses of nifedipine. Topical nifedipine has been shown to be as effective as topical nitrates for anal fissures. Nifedipine is also used in high-altitude medicine to treat high altitude pulmonary edema. Other uses include painful spasms of the esophagus such as from cancer or tetanus. It is also used for the small subset of people with pulmonary hypertension. Finally, nifedipine can be used in the treatment of renal calculi, which are commonly referred to as kidney stones. Studies have indicated that it helps to relieve renal colic. However, alpha blockers (such as tamsulosin) have been described as being significantly better. Side effects Nifedipine rapidly lowers blood pressure, and patients are commonly warned they may feel dizzy or faint after taking the first few doses. Tachycardia (fast heart rate) may occur as a reaction. These problems are much less frequent in the sustained-release preparations of nifedipine. Extended release formulations of nifedipine should be taken on an empty stomach, and patients are warned not to consume anything containing grapefruit or grapefruit juice, as they raise blood nifedipine levels. There are several possible mechanisms, including the inhibition of CYP3A4-mediated metabolism. Overdose A number of persons have developed toxicity due to acute overdosage with nifedipine, either accidentally or intentionally, and via either oral or parenteral administration. The adverse effects include lethargy, bradycardia, marked hypotension and loss of consciousness. The drug may be quantified in blood or plasma to confirm a diagnosis of poisoning, or to assist in a medicolegal investigation following death. Analytical methods usually involve gas or liquid chromatography and specimen concentrations are usually in the 100-1000 Œºg/L range.Nifediac package insert, TEVA Pharmaceuticals, Sellersville, Pennsylvania, August, 2009. Mechanism of action Nifedipine is a calcium channel blocker. Although nifedipine and other dihydropyridines are commonly regarded as specific to the L-type calcium channel, they also possess nonspecific activity towards other voltage-dependent calcium channels. Nifedipine has additionally been found to act as an antagonist of the mineralocorticoid receptor, or as an antimineralocorticoid. History Nifedipine (initially BAY a1040) was developed by the German pharmaceutical company Bayer, with most initial studies being performed in the early 1970s. The use of nifedipine and related calcium channel antagonists was much reduced in response to 1995 trials that mortality was increased in patients with coronary artery disease who took nifedipine. This study was a meta-analysis, and demonstrated harm mainly in short-acting forms of nifedipine (that could cause large fluctuations in blood pressure) and at high doses of 80 mg a day and more.

All Saints' Church, restored in 1866, is late Norman. In the reign of King Richard II, the Manor of Clovelly was bought by the judge Sir John Cary, and the church contains several monuments to the Cary family, Lords of the Manor for 600 years. Clovelly was a solely agricultural parish with no harbour until the late 16th century, when the squire, George Cary, had the stone pier erected, thus providing the only haven on this coast between Appledore and Boscastle. He also erected fish cellars and warehouses at the cliff base, and cottages along the banks of the stream that provided the only route to the shore from the plateau above. The works cost him ¬£2,000 and turned Clovelly into a fishing village. The village is privately owned and has been associated with only three families since the middle of the 13th century. The estate is run by the Clovelly Estate Company, led by John Rous, a descendant of the Hamlyn family who have owned the village, estate and manor house, Clovelly Court, since 1738. John Rous is the only son of Keith Rous, the 5th Earl of Stradbroke and Mary Asquith, granddaughter of former Prime Minister H. H. Asquith. In 1901 the village had a population of 621.

At Grade II*, are numbers 16, and 45‚Äì47, 53‚Äì54 (53 has the house name Crazy Kate's), and 59‚Äì61. There are two public houses and two hotels. Lifeboat station The village has an RNLI lifeboat station with its boat, the Toby Rundle, installed in 2014. Access There is a public road leading to the harbour and main street with a right of way for pedestrians and vehicles. The village main street is not accessible by motor vehicles. The lack of vehicular access to the main street has led to deliveries being made by sledge. This is not done as a tourist attraction, but as a matter of practicality. Goods are delivered by being pulled down on a sledge from the upper car park, and refuse is collected by being pulled down the hill to a vehicle at the harbour. Donkeys on the steep main street, outside the village's post office. The slope can be seen by comparing the cobbled street with the (level) slate pavement in front of the shop. The village is served by Stagecoach bus service 319; the route includes Barnstaple, Bideford and Hartland.http://www.clovelly.co.uk Visitors' Website Notable residents and cultural references Waterfall visible by boat The novelist Charles Kingsley lived here as a child from 1831 to 1836, while his father, Rev. Charles Kingsley, served first as senior curate then as rector. Later, in 1855, his novel Westward Ho! did much to stimulate interest in Clovelly and to boost its tourist trade. Actor Joss Ackland and his wife Rosemary bought a property in Higher Clovelly on the outskirts of the village in 1989. Ackland still lives there but Rosemary died in 2002 and is buried in the grounds of their home. Ackland has appeared in promotional videos for the town and has spoken often of his love of and connection to Clovelly. Clovelly is also described by Charles Dickens in \\"A Message from the Sea\\" and was painted by Rex Whistler, whose cameos of the village were used on a china service by Josiah Wedgwood. The sixteenth-century Carys of Clovelly feature in the historical novel The Grove of Eagles by Winston Graham. The surgeon Campbell De Morgan (1811‚Äì1876), who first speculated that cancer arose locally and then spread more widely in the body, was born here. Clovelly is mentioned in passing by Rudyard Kipling in Stalky & Co. as being located to the west of the boys' academy. In Susan Coolidge's In the High Valley (1890), part of the Katy series, a walk into Clovelly is described: \\"...-surely a more extraordinary thing in the way of a street does not exist in the known world. The little village is built on the sides of a crack in a tremendous cliff; the 'street' is merely the bottom of the crack, into which the ingenuity of man has fitted a few stones, set slant- wise, with intersecting ridges on which the foot can catch as it goes slipping hopelessly down.\\" J.M.W. Turner's painting of Clovelly Harbour around 1822 hangs in the National Gallery of Ireland, Dublin. On Sunday 28 October 1838 twelve fishing vessels with a total of twenty-six men on board left Clovelly harbour for the fishing grounds. Only one vessel and its crew ever returned after a ferocious storm in the Bristol Channel. This event led to the founding of the Shipwrecked Mariners' Society early the following year with the object of The charity is active supporting the seafaring community suffering hardship and distress. Cultural tradition An 18th-century chapbook entitled The History of John Gregg and his Family of Robbers and Murderers explains that \\"Chovaley\\" (i.e. Clovelly) was once the home of a tribe of cannibalistic bandits. It is alleged that Gregg and his extended family of dozens were eventually tracked down by bloodhounds and were burnt alive in three fires. They were said to have lived in \\"a cave near the sea-side\\" and had committed some 1,000 murders.James Halliwell-Phillipps (July 1849). Notices of Fugitive Tracts, and Chap-books. Read Books (2013). p.85. Although the story is fiction, writer Daniel Codd observes that a stretch of Clovelly Bay is called \\"the Devil's Kitchen\\"‚Äî\\"an apt name indeed if there is any truth in the ghoulish story of the Gregg family\\".Codd, Daniel (2013).

Feb. 2007 The Worcester and Birmingham Canal is a canal linking Birmingham and Worcester in England. It starts in Worcester, as an 'offshoot' of the River Severn (just after the river lock) and ends in Gas Street Basin in Birmingham. It is long. There are 58 locks in total on the canal, including the 30 Tardebigge Locks, one of the largest lock flights in Europe. The canal climbs from Worcester to Birmingham. History The parliamentary bill permitting its construction was passed in 1791 empowering the company to raise ¬£180,000 (equivalent to ¬£ in ), through 1,800 shares at a cost of ¬£100 each. It also allowed them to raise a further ¬£70,000, if needed, amongst themselves or by the mortgage of tolls and rates. The Act also permitted the company to allow landowners on the line to build wharfs and wharfhouse, and if they refuse to, the company are allowed to if needed. A further Act of Parliament authorised the raising of ¬£149,929 amongst themselves or through the creation of new shares. However, the company were unable to raise the full amount of money authorised by the second Act, and so another was passed allowing them to raise ¬£49,680. Another Act was passed to obtain more money in 1808. This Act empowered the company to raise ¬£168,000 through the creation of 4,200 shares at ¬£40 each. A final Act was passed in 1815 after the company had purchased land for reservoirs, which was not permitted in the previous Acts. The Act permitted the company to sell the land and to pay a debt of ¬£29,096 (equivalent to ¬£ in ), to the treasurers by 29 September 1815 as well, otherwise it would be taken out of the proceeds raised from selling the land. The canal was surveyed by Josiah Clowes and John Snape. Its engineers changed often, and included Thomas Cartwright, John Woodhouse and William Crosley. Construction of a barge-width (14 ft) canal began in 1792 from the Birmingham end, but progressed slowly. Selly Oak was reached in October 1795 and Kings Norton Junction by May 1796, meeting the new Stratford-upon-Avon Canal which had by then reached Hockley Heath. By March 1797 the 2726 yard (2493 m) Wast Hills Tunnel was open and the canal was trading to Hopwood. In 1807 the canal reached Tardebigge without the use of locks. From Worcester Bar to Tardebigge top lock, the canal is at the 453 ft Birmingham Level. The cost of building locks was too great so the 56 locks down to Worcester were built to the narrow specification, with the final two locks connecting to the Severn in Worcester being to allow river craft access to Diglis Basin. The final 16 miles (26 km) was opened in December 1815. Plans to construct basins at Lowesmoor and Diglis were carried out eventually. Worcester and Birmingham Canal signpost. The Dudley Canal Line No 2 was built through the Lapal Tunnel to meet the canal at Selly Oak in 1798. After repeated collapses, the tunnel was finally abandoned in 1917 leaving a short stretch navigable between Selly Oak and a brick works at California until 1953, after which it was drained and filled in. A campaign group, The Lapal Canal Trust, is working to restore it, with a diversion around the tunnel. A major user of the canal was the Cadbury chocolate factories at Bournville and Blackpole, Worcester. Birmingham terminus For twenty years direct connection to the Birmingham Canal Navigations (BCN) was prevented by the Worcester Bar, a physical barrier at Gas Street Basin, Birmingham designed so that the BCN would not lose water to the Worcester and Birmingham. Cargoes had to be laboriously manhandled between boats on either side. In 1815 an Act allowed the creation of a stop lock and the bar was breached. The Worcester and Birmingham raised their water level by six inches to minimise water loss and today the two pairs of lock gates have been removed. There were separate toll offices either side of the bar for the two canal companies. The bar still exists, with boats moored to both sides of it. The commercial terminus in Birmingham was Worcester Wharf, a large complex extending from the bar along Bridge Street, Gas Street and Granville Street. Part of it now forms a water front to The Mailbox shopping and residential complex. Birmingham West Suburban Railway After the development of the new Birmingham New Street, a group of local business men noticed the resultant need for additional railway capacity south, through what were the under developed suburbs of south Birmingham and villages of northern Worcestershire. They therefore proposed development of a new branch railway, following the route of the Worcester and Birmingham Canal south to the Birmingham and Gloucester Railway to allow access to their new station at Kings Norton. Needing finance for construction of the BWSR, the newly formed Midland Railway became involved in the deal. An eventual agreement was reached with the then loss making canal company, who would be paid a rent for the land, which later became a guarantee of a 1% share dividend. The payments to the canal company and development began in 1873, and the line was running by 1875. Originally the railway terminated at Granville Street station and later the Central Goods station and goods yard through a tunnel under the canal, both stations now demolished and built upon. Today it forms a large part of the southern section of the Cross-City Line which runs in another tunnel under the canal adjacent to the Holliday Street Aqueduct. Today Aerial view of the new railway bridge (nearest to camera) and Ariel Aqueduct, over the diverted A38, taken in January 2013 At Selly Oak, a new aqueduct, the 'Ariel Aqueduct', was constructed in 2011 to carry the canal over a new section of the A38. The canal is popular for leisure and has a number of narrowboat hire centres at Alvechurch, Worcester, Tardebigge, Dunhampstead and Stoke Prior. The canal forms part of the Stourport Ring, which is one of the popular cruising rings for holiday boating. The ring takes in parts of four waterways, is long, and includes 105 locks. Another ring which includes the Worcester and Birmingham Canal is the Avon Ring, which is long with 129 locks, and also includes parts of four waterways.

Quantales are sometimes referred to as complete residuated semigroups. Overview A quantale is a complete lattice Q with an associative binary operation ‚àó : Q √ó Q -> Q, called its multiplication, satisfying a distributive property such that :x*\\\\left(\\\\bigvee_{i\\\\in I}{y_i}\\\\right) = \\\\bigvee_{i\\\\in I}(x*y_i) and :\\\\left(\\\\bigvee_{i\\\\in I}{y_i}\\\\right)*{x}=\\\\bigvee_{i\\\\in I}(y_i*x) for all x, yi in Q, i in I (here I is any index set). The quantale is unital if it has an identity element e for its multiplication: :x*e = x = e*x for all x in Q. In this case, the quantale is naturally a monoid with respect to its multiplication ‚àó. A unital quantale may be defined equivalently as a monoid in the category Sup of complete join semi-lattices. A unital quantale is an idempotent semiring under join and multiplication. A unital quantale in which the identity is the top element of the underlying lattice is said to be strictly two-sided (or simply integral). A commutative quantale is a quantale whose multiplication is commutative. A frame, with its multiplication given by the meet operation, is a typical example of a strictly two-sided commutative quantale. Another simple example is provided by the unit interval together with its usual multiplication. An idempotent quantale is a quantale whose multiplication is idempotent. A frame is the same as an idempotent strictly two-sided quantale. An involutive quantale is a quantale with an involution :(xy)^\\\\circ = y^\\\\circ x^\\\\circ that preserves joins: :\\\\biggl(\\\\bigvee_{i\\\\in I}{x_i}\\\\biggr)^\\\\circ =\\\\bigvee_{i\\\\in I}(x_i^\\\\circ). A quantale homomorphism is a map f : Q1 -> Q2 that preserves joins and multiplication for all x, y, xi in Q1, and i in I: :f(xy) = f(x)f(y), :f\\\\left(\\\\bigvee_{i \\\\in I}{x_i}\\\\right) = \\\\bigvee_{i \\\\in I} f(x_i).

It is on the estuary where the rivers Taw and Torridge meet, between the villages of Westleigh and Yelland and on the opposite bank of Appledore. There is an electoral ward with the same name. Its total population at the 2011 census was 1,501. There is a small river beach and sand dunes, that home some rare species of orchid including the pyramid orchid. The Tarka Trail passes through Instow, providing an easy means for people to arrive by foot or on bike. This section of the Trail is also part of the South West Coast Path, offering longer walks along the coast. The village is served by the Church of St John the Baptist, which has 13th/14th century origins and is a Grade I listed building. A chapel of ease, All Saints, was built in 1936 and is now also used as a community centre. Instow Railway Station Instow railway station in 1969 The line opened from Barnstaple to Fremington in 1848, and then passenger trains ran from Barnstaple to Bideford from 2 November 1855 after the Bideford Extension Railway. The line was further extended to Torrington in 1872. Passenger services ceased on 2 October 1965 although ball clay traffic continued until 1982. The track was finally removed in 1985. Instow Signal Box Instow has a famous railway signal box, which is over 130 years old and was the UK's first Grade II listed signal box. It used to control the signals at Instow Station and also the operation of the level crossing. You can see the wheel that operated the gates, pull the signal levers, one of which still operates a signal, and generally learn how the box worked. In 2003 the box was nationally recognised for its restoration and educational value by receiving the Carillion Rail Award at the National Railway Heritage Awards. The signal box is now managed and run by volunteers of the Bideford Railway Heritage Centre and is open to the public on occasional Sundays and Bank Holidays. Instow Beach A39 Torridge Bridge Instow Beach also known as Instow Sands, is used widely during summer months at the peak of the tourist season. The beach is suitable for families as it enjoys few waves because of the sandbanks at the mouth of the estuary cancelling out most of the ocean swell. However, bathing water quality has regularly failed Environment Agency mandatory standards over the last few decades. There is a large number of boats anchored on the sand. Many are only accessible at low-tide or via a dinghy or what is locally known as a tender. Windsurfing and kite surfing have become popular, taking advantage of the open position and calm waters. Canoeing and kayaking in the rivers to Instow beach is also popular. Leading lights The rear of the two leading lights at Instow. In 1820 a pair of leading lights was established at Braunton Burrows to help guide vessels entering the Taw Torridge Estuary from Bideford Bay. Designed by Joseph Nelson, they were known as the Bideford High and Low Lights. When the ground they were on became unstable they were demolished (in 1957) and replaced by a new pair of leading lights at Instow. Initially the rear light was supported on a tubular steel structure (since replaced by a steel lattice structure) and the front light on a wooden structure, which was irreparably damaged in a storm in January 1990 and likewise replaced by a steel lattice tower. Both lights remain operational and are managed by Trinity House. Arromanches Camp Near the village is Arromanches Camp which is operated by the Royal Marines; the main unit which uses the camp is No. 11 (Amphibious Trials and Training) Squadron.

The Gundlach Periscope, usually known under its British designation as Vickers Tank Periscope MK.IV, was a revolutionary invention by Polish engineer Rudolf Gundlach, manufactured for Polish 7TP tanks from the end of 1935 and patented in 1936 as the Gundlach Peryskop obrotowy. It was the first device to allow the tank commander to have a 360-degree view from his turret with a single periscope. By rotating the periscope and allowing the tank commander to look backwards through the second eyepiece, he no longer had to change position to look behind the turret. Early tanks had small turrets and fixed seating, without an independently rotating cupola, and so the commander wasn't easily able to move himself to another rear-facing periscope. On 14 June 1935 it was officially adopted by the Polish Army, as reversible periscope G wz. 34 Miros≈Çaw Zientarzewski (in Polish), Peryskop odwracalny wz. 34, \\"Militaria i Fakty\\" nr 2/2006 , p. 48. The design was first used in the TKS tankette, then in 7TP light tank. Shortly before the war it was given to the British and was used in almost all tanks of WWII, including the British Crusader, Churchill, Valentine, and Cromwell and the American Sherman. After the German and Soviet attack and fall of Poland in 1939 it was copied entirely from captured 7TP and TKS Polish tanks and later used by the USSR (including in the T-34 and T-70). As a part of Polish-British pre-war military cooperation, the patent was sold for a penny (actually 1 Polish Zloty) to Vickers-Armstrong. It was produced as the Vickers Tank Periscope MK.IV (pictured), and built into all British tanks (Crusader, Churchill, Valentine, Cromwell). After the fall of Poland, Germany, USSR and Romania captured some equipment, allowing them to copy the invention. In USSR the Gundlach periscope was known as MK-4 (harking to the British designation, as Russian sources openly confirm that it was copied from samples acquired with British-supplied tanks) and implemented in all tanks (including the T-34 and T-70). Later technology was transferred to USA and as a periscope M6 implemented in all US tanks (M3/M5 Stuart, M4 Sherman and others). At the end of World War II this technology was adopted throughout the world and used basically unchanged for almost 50 years, until it was replaced by electronic devices.

Brothers Alan and Richard Jensen gave the new name, Jensen Motors Limited, to the commercial body and sports car body making business of W J Smith & Sons Limited in 1934. It ceased trading in 1976. Though trading resumed in 1998 Jensen Motors Limited was dissolved in 2011. Jensen Motors built specialist car bodies for major manufacturers alongside cars of their own design using engines and mechanicals of major manufacturers Ford, Austin and Chrysler. The rights to Jensen's trademarks were bought with the company and it briefly operated in Speke, Liverpool, from 1998 to 2002. Under subsequent owners, a new version of the Jensen Interceptor was announced in 2011. It was planned to bring manufacture of that new model back to the former Jaguar motor plant in Browns Lane, Coventry. Jensen brothers woodie\\" Shooting brake 1938 Jensen S-type drophead, 3.5 litre In 1926 young Alan Jensen (1906-1994) and his brother Richard Jensen (1909-1977)Frank Alan Jensen and Richard Arthur Jensen built a new boat-tailed sporting body on one of the first Chummy baby Austins. It was seen by Alfred Herbert Wilde, (1891-1930) chief engineer of Standard Motor Company. He persuaded Alan Jensen to join New Avon Body Co, a Standard Motor associate and under Wilde‚Äôs aegis Alan Jensen designed the first Standard Avon open two-seaters produced from 1929 to 1933. He went on to design two more cars for Avon then moved with his brother Richard to Austin dealers Edgbaston Garage Limited, Bournbrook, in a building still standing next to the University of Birmingham campus. Edgbaston Garage, a car servicing business, had been bought for his son in 1929 by J A M Patrick's father. Young Joe Patrick, involved in all fields of motor sport, was setting up a coachbuilding operation. For his Edgbaston Garage the Jensen brothers made handsome bodies for the new Wolseley Hornet and Hornet Special chassis. To the concern of the brothers their cars were widely advertised as The Patrick Special and so in 1931 the brothers moved again. Edgbaston Garage became Patrick Motors Limited.Motoring. ‚Äò‚ÄôThe Times‚Äô‚Äô, Thursday, Aug 26, 1976; pg. 23; Issue 59792 The Jensen brothers had gone to work for lorry body maker W J Smith & Sons in Carters Green in West Bromwich again to build bodies for small sports cars including more Wolseley Hornet Specials. This was a quite separate development which Smith named on their account Jensen Motors. Their own name was on the product. In 1934 Smith died and the brothers managed to buy a controlling shareholding in Smith & Sons. They later changed the name of W J Smith & Sons to Jensen Motors Limited. Smith's announced an open 4-seater and a lowered 2-seater in May 1931 both to be known as Jensen Wolseley Hornets. They later expanded to build exclusive customised bodies for standard cars produced by several manufacturers of the day including Morris, Singer, Standard, as well as Wolseley. In 1934 they were commissioned by American film actor Clark Gable to design and build a car for him based on a Ford V-8 chassis. The resultant car won them much acclaim and stimulated huge interest in their work, including a deal with Ford to produce a run of Jensen-Fords with Jensen bodywork with a Ford chassis and engine. In 1934 they also started to design their first true production car under the name White Lady. This evolved into the Jensen S-type which went into production in 1935. Commercial vehicles JNSN lorry In the late 1930s Jensen diversified into the production of commercial vehicles under the marque JNSN, including the manufacture of a series of innovative lightweight trucks, built with unrestricted aluminium alloys, for Reynolds Tube and the prototype for the articulated Jen-Tug which went into production in the late 1940s. During the Second World War Jensen concentrated on the war effort and produced components for military vehicles including the turrets for tanks, and on the production of specialised ambulances and fire-engines. After the war production of the Jen-Tug thrived and Jensen also produced a new range of JNSN lightweight diesel trucks and chassis which were used for a variety of vehicles including pantechnicons and buses. A handful of Jensen buses and coaches were produced for independent operators into the 1950s, with Perkins diesel engines, David Brown gearboxes, and bodywork by a variety of bodybuilders of the time, which had the distinctive large JNSN marque cut into the sheet metal on the front of the bus, below the windscreen. In the 1950s Jensen were chosen by the British Motor Corporation (BMC) to build the bodies for the four-wheel-drive Austin Gipsy. In 1958 they built a small number of Jensen Tempo light commercial vans, pick-ups and minibuses, a German original design, built under licence in the UK, none are known to survive. Sports cars 1952 Jensen Interceptor Production of cars ceased during the war years, but by 1946 a new vehicle was offered, the Jensen PW (a luxury saloon). Few were produced since raw materials were carefully limited by the new government's central planning. Also in 1946 body designer Eric Neale joined Jensen Motors from Wolseley and his first project was the more modern coup√© which followed in 1950, named the Interceptor, which was built until 1957. 1960 Jensen 541R In 1955, Jensen started production of Neale's masterpiece, the 541, which used the then- revolutionary material of fibreglass for its bodywork. The radiator grille was covered by an unusual driver-controlled swivelling flap. 1964 Jensen C-V8 The 541S was replaced by another Neale design, the C-V8 in October 1962, which replaced the Austin-sourced straight-6 of the previous cars with a 6-litre American Chrysler V8. This large engine in such a lightweight car made the Jensen one of the fastest four-seaters of the time. 1973 Interceptor S, and its distinctive rear window For its eventual replacement, the Interceptor, Jensen turned to the Italian coachbuilder, Carrozzeria Touring, for the body design, and to steel for the material. First displayed alongside the production C-V8 FF in October 1965Power Continues To Climb. The Times, Wednesday, Oct 20, 1965; pg. 17; Issue 56457 and put into production in the second half of 1966 the bodyshells themselves were built by Vignale of Italy and later by Jensen. The same Chrysler wedge-head powerplant was used in the earlier cars with the later cars moving to the in engine. The Interceptor was offered in fastback, convertible and (rare) coup√© versions. The fastback was by far the most popular with its large, curving wrap-around rear window that was hinged for access to the storage area, making the Jensen an early form of liftback. FF ‚Äî All wheel drive and ABS Jensen FF Mk.II The Jensen Motors stand at the October 1964 Earls Court Motorshow displayed a Jensen FF car equipped with all wheel drive and ABS as publicised but not displayed in February 1964. At the following Show in October 1965 a production ready CV-8 FF was displayed, priced almost 50 per cent more than the standard car and three inches longer. However, it remained a prototype and instead the Interceptor-based Jensen FF entered production in 1966. The FF is apparently externally identical to the Interceptor, although it was four inches longer in the bonnet (all ahead of the windscreen) and it had a second row of air vents behind the front wheels. The extra letters stood for Ferguson Formula, Ferguson Research being the inventor of the full-time all wheel drive system adopted, the first on a production sports car. Also featured was the Dunlop Maxaret anti-lock braking system in one of the first uses of ABS in a production car. Just 320 FFs were constructed and production ceased in 1971. Other projects Austin A40 Sports, ca 1951 Austin A40 Sports: As one in a series of collaborations between Austin and Jensen, the Austin A40 Sports originated when Austin's chairman Leonard Lord, upon seeing the Interceptor, requested that Jensen, and their designer Eric Neale, develop a body that could use the A40 mechanicals. The resulting body-on-frame A40 Sports ‚Äì which debuted at the 1949 London Motor Show ‚Äì had been designed by Eric Neale, an ex-Wolseley stylist who had joined Jensen in 1946. During production, the A40 Sports' aluminium bodies were built by Jensen and transported to Austin's Longbridge plant for final assembly. The A40 Sports had been intended as more of a sporty touring car and not a sports car per se, and over 4000 examples were manufactured from 1951‚Äì1953. Austin-Healey 100: Although Jensen's design for a new Austin-based sports-car was rejected by the British Motor Corporation (BMC) in 1952 in favour of a design provided by Donald Healey, Jensen did win the BMC contract to build the bodies for the resultant Austin- Healey 100 and the rest of the \\"big Healey\\" cars.

The Times, Friday, Sep 19, 1975; pg. 18; Issue 59505 The empty premises were auctioned off in mid-August 1976. Two new companies: Jensen Special Products (JSP) and Jensen Parts & Service Limited (JP&S;) were created to pick up the pieces of Jensen Motors. JSP was created as a specialist engineering and design business from Jensen's development department. JP&S; was created to provide parts and service to the existing Jensen customer base. JP&S; then turned into a company called International Motors, who gained the UK franchise for Subaru and Maserati, as well as Hyundai from 1982. Both JSP and JP&S; were bought by a holding company, Britcar Holdings. In 1982 JP&S;, with the rights to use the Jensen brand names, was sold to Ian Orford who put the Interceptor back into production as the Mk IV. Jensen Parts and Service was renamed Jensen Cars Limited and an average 11 cars were made every month during the 1980s always in small numbers before the company was sold to Unicorn Holdings of Stockport and a Mk V Interceptor was proposed but never materialised although a few more Mk IVs were built. Revival hopes Jensen S-V8 A revival in 2001 was short lived. By the end of 2002 production on their only model ‚Äì the ¬£40,000 S-V8 ‚Äì had ceased. After a ¬£10 million investment, including Liverpool City Council and the Department of Trade and Industry, a two-seater convertible, the Jensen S-V8, had been launched at the 1998 British International Motor Show, with an initial production run of 300 deposit paid vehicles planned at a selling price of ¬£40,000 each, but by October 1999 it was confirmed that 110 orders had been placed. The new Liverpool factory in Speke commenced production in August 2001 but troubles with manufacture meant production ceased with only 20 ever leaving the factory and another 18 cars left partially completed. The company went into administration in July 2002. The Jensen name and partially completed cars were later sold to SV Automotive of Carterton, Oxfordshire, in 2003 who decided to complete the building of 12 of the cars, retaining the others for spare parts, and finally selling them for ¬£38,070. Jensen International Automotive In April 2010 Jensen International Automotive (JIA) was founded. This new company will buy old Jensen Interceptors, and sell them as new cars after a complete restoration, with new engine and interior trim.Charles Dunstone invests in Jensen Interceptor relaunch, BBC In September 2011 CPP, a specialist sports car manufacturer announced they were planning to make a new Jensen, expected to go on sale to the public sometime in 2014. The new Interceptor was to be based around an all-aluminium chassis and to feature alloy panels, \\"echoing the four-seat grand tourer layout of the much-loved original\\", according to the official press release. The Jensen Group On the 25 February 2015, Autocar published a report stating that the Jensen name is officially being revived with two models expected by 2016. The first model, shown in clay on the same article, shows a vehicle called the Jensen GT. This model will be built in bespoke numbers and cost around ¬£350,000 or roughly 408.000 Euros outside the UK. Also in 2016, Jensen is expected to launch the successor to the famous Jensen Interceptor, called the Interceptor 2. These revival announcements are completely different to those announced by CPP in 2011 and are \\"officially sanctioned\\" by the company leading the project, \\"The Jensen Group\\", who have said they have established complete ownership over the Jensen marque. The interim Jensen GT will be produced under an agreement between the Jensen Group and Jensen International Automotive, a small British company that builds modified Interceptor R models. http://www.autocar.co.uk/car-news/new- cars/jensen-name-returns-new-gt-model Jensen cars * Jensen S-type (1936‚Äì1941) * Jensen H-type (1938‚Äì1945) * Jensen PW (1946‚Äì1952) * Jensen Interceptor (1950‚Äì1957) * Jensen 541 (1954‚Äì1959) * Jensen 541R (1957‚Äì1960) * Jensen 541S (1960‚Äì1963) * Jensen C-V8 (1962‚Äì1966) * Jensen P66 (1965 prototype only) * Jensen Interceptor (1966‚Äì1976) * Jensen FF (1966‚Äì1971) * Jensen SP (1971‚Äì1973) * Jensen-Healey (1972‚Äì1975) * Jensen GT (1975‚Äì1976) * Jensen S-V8 (2001) See also * Austin-Healey 100 * Austin-Healey 3000 * Volvo P1800 * Sunbeam Tiger * List of car manufacturers of the United Kingdom Notes References External links *Catalogue of the Jensen Motors archives, held at the Modern Records Centre, University of Warwick *Jensen Motors Limited Jensen Motors Limited website Defunct motor vehicle manufacturers of England Defunct truck manufacturers of the United Kingdom Luxury motor vehicle manufacturers Jensen Coachbuilders of the United Kingdom Defunct companies based in the West Midlands (county) ","title":"Jensen Motors"},{"id":"716839","text":"Dorte Juul Jensen is a senior scientist and head of the Center for Fundamental Research: Metal Structures in Four Dimensions and Materials Research Division, Ris√∏ DTU National Laboratory for Sustainable Energy, Roskilde, Denmark.

Cargo (physical goods) is primarily delivered via roads and railroads on land, shipping lanes on the sea, and airline networks in the air. Certain types of goods may be delivered via specialized networks, such as pipelines for liquid goods, power grids for electrical power and computer networks such as the Internet or broadcast networks for electronic information. Car transport is a particular subgroup; a related variant is Autorack, which involves transport of autos by railroads. Delivery is a fundamental component of commerce and trade, and involves transport and distribution. The general process of delivering goods is known as distribution, while the study of effective processes for delivery and disposition of goods and personnel is called logistics. Firms specializing in delivering commercial goods from the point of production or storage to their point of sale are generally known as distributors, while those that specialize in the delivery of goods to the consumer are known as delivery services. Postal, courier, and relocation services also deliver goods for commercial and private interests.  Consumer goods delivery  A Dairy Crest Smiths Elizabethan electric Milk float used to deliver fresh milk to people's doorsteps. Most consumer goods are delivered from a point of production (such as a factory or farm) through one or more points of storage (warehouses) to a point of sale (such as retail stores or online vendors), where the consumer buys the good and is responsible for its transportation to point of consumption. There are many variations on this model for specific types of goods and modes of sale. Products sold via catalogue or the Internet may be delivered directly from the manufacturer or warehouse to the consumer's home, or to an automated delivery booth. Small manufacturers may deliver their products directly to retail stores without warehousing. Some manufacturers maintain factory outlets which serve as both points of storage and points of sale, selling products directly to consumers at wholesale prices, although many retail stores falsely advertise as factory outlets. Building, construction, landscaping and like materials are generally delivered to the consumer by a contractor as part of another service. Some highly perishable or hazardous goods, such as radioisotopes used in medical imaging, are delivered directly from manufacturer to consumer. Home delivery is often available for fast food and other convenience products, e.g. pizza delivery. Sometimes home delivery of supermarket goods is possible. A milk float is a small battery electric vehicle (BEV), specifically designed for the delivery of fresh milk. A new form of delivery is emerging on the horizon of the internet age: Delivery by the crowd e.g. crowd delivery. In this concept, an individual not necessarily contracted by the vendor performs the delivery of goods to the destination. Sometimes, private courier companies will also deliver consumer goods on a regular basis for companies like E-commerce businesses.  Delivery vehicles  Asda Mercedes-Benz Sprinter vans for delivering groceries to customers' doors Delivery tricycle A horse-drawn dairy delivery vehicle in Montreal, Quebec, Canada in 1942 The consumer demand for supermarkets to deliver to their door created the need for a mixed temperature controlled vehicle on 3.5T chassis. These vehicle bodies were initially built with the traditional GRP sandwich panels but as more damage resistant lightweight materials with better insulation properties have become available companies have been developing Advanced Home Delivery Vehicles. The 2012 Commercial Vehicle Show in the UK saw the new JDC PolyBilt design, one of the latest of these \\"Plastic\\" bodies that can also be recycled at the end of its service life unlike the traditional GRP which ends up as landfill. Vehicles are often specialized to deliver different types of goods. On land, semi-trailers are outfitted with various trailers such as box trailers, flatbeds, car carriers, tanks and other specialized trailers, while railroad trains include similarly specialized cars. Armored cars, dump trucks and concrete mixers are examples of vehicles specialized for delivery of specific types of goods. On the sea, merchant ships come in various forms, such as cargo ships, oil tankers and fishing boats. Freight aircraft are used to deliver cargo. Often, passenger vehicles are used for delivery of goods. These include buses, vans, pick-ups, cars (e.g., for mail or pizza delivery), motorcycles and bicycles (e.g., for newspaper delivery). A significant amount of freight is carried in the cargo holds of passenger ships and aircraft. Everyday travelers, known as a casual courier, can also be used to deliver goods. Delivery to remote, primitive or inhospitable areas may be accomplished using small aircraft, snowmobiles, horse-drawn vehicles, dog sleds, pack animals, on foot, or by a variety of other transport methods. Larger firms including Amazon, Google, and FedEx have been investing in using delivery drones that are capable of carrying light packages across short distances.  Periodic deliveries  Some products are delivered to consumers on a periodic schedule. Historically, home delivery of many goods was much more common in urban centres of the developed world. At the beginning of the 20th century, perishable farm items such as milk, eggs and ice, were delivered weekly or even daily to customers by local farms. Milkmen delivered milk and other farm produce. With the advent of home refrigeration and better distribution methods, these products are today largely delivered through the same retail distribution systems as other food products. Icemen delivered ice for iceboxes until the popularization of home refrigerator rendered them obsolete in most places. Similarly, laundry was once picked up and washed at a commercial laundry before being delivered to middle-class homes until the appearance of the washing machine and dryer (the lower classes washed their own and the upper classes had live-in servants). Likewise deliveries of coal and wood for home heating were more common until they were replaced in many areas by natural gas, oil, or electric heating. Some products, most notably home heating oil, are still delivered periodically. Human blood may be delivered to hospitals on a periodic schedule. Milk delivery continued until the mid-twentieth century across North America. For example, the last milk delivery by horse-and-wagon in Edmonton was in 1961. Milkman jokes continue in circulation long after. Related lines of Jeannie C.

He headed the design division of the Armored Weapons Technical Research Bureau (Biuro Bada≈Ñ Technicznych Broni Pancernych). He held the military rank of major in the Corps of Engineers of the Polish Army. He was the chief designer of the Ursus wz. 29 armored car and supervised design work for the 7TP light tank and the 10TP fast tank prototype. Early life Rudolf Gundlach was born on 28 March 1892 in Wiskitki, Russian Empire (now Poland) into an Evangelical family. His father was a pastor. From 1903 to 1911, he attended a classical gymnasium in ≈Å√≥d≈∫, and then entered the Riga Technical University where he studied until his conscription into the Russian Army in 1916. He graduated from a non-commissioned officers school of artillery and served in the 8th Heavy Artillery Brigade. In mid-1917, he became a member of the Union of Military Poles in Tartu. He organized an artillery unit for the Polish I Corps. Interwar Poland Gundlach enlisted into the Polish Army in November 1918. After graduating from the Automotive Officers School in Krak√≥w in October 1919, he served as an adjutant in the Automotive Command Center in ≈Å√≥d≈∫. He was appointed lieutenant in December 1919 and commanded a column of military vehicles during the Polish‚ÄìSoviet War. In 1925, Gundlach finished his studies at the Faculty of Mechanical Engineering of the Warsaw University of Technology, but failed to obtain the engineer's degree (he didn't take the diploma exam). In January 1930, he was promoted to the rank of captain, and in 1937 to the rank of major. In interwar Poland, he worked in the Engineering Department of the Ministry of Military Affairs, as a clerk in the Institute of Engineering Research, and from 1931, was the head of the Armored Weapons Construction Bureau in the Army Research Institute for Engineering. In December 1934, he became the head of the Design and Construction Department in the Armoured Weapons Technical Research Bureau. He remained at this position until the outbreak of World War II. He was decorated with the Silver Cross of Merit. France After the fall of Poland in 1939, Gundlach was one of hundreds of thousand Polish soldiers, technicians, scientists and engineers who escaped to France via Romania. In France he worked in the Bureau of War Industry (Biuro Wojennego Przemys≈Çu przy Ministerstwie Przemys≈Çu), and in the Ministry of Industry of the Polish Government in Exile. After the fall of France, health problems prevented him from evacuating to Great Britain and he stayed in Vichy France for the remainder of the war. After the end of World War II, Gundlach sought enforcement of intellectual property rights over his periscope, which had been copied in several countries and produced under different names. He was unsuccessful in the United States due to long and costly court proceedings, but managed to obtain a license fee from the British Royal Commission. He received a large payment for his periscope patent from some of its producers. In 1947, he gained compensation from the British authorities, and a French court awarded him 84 million francs for the use of his invention by Barbier-Bernard. After paying the attorney's fees, court costs, and taxes, he was left with 17 million francs, which allowed him to buy a villa in Le V√©sinet near Paris. He established a bakery in 1953. His house served as a meeting place for Polish immigrants. He sold it in 1956 and moved to Colombes, where he died on 4 July 1957 and was buried at the local cemetery. Gundlach Rotary Periscope Gundlach periscope. He is famous for his invention of the Gundlach Rotary Periscope (), patented in 1938, which made possible 360¬∞ vision. The periscope enabled an observer (e.g., the tank commander) to look forward (upper panel of the picture) or backward (lower panel) without moving his seat. Since it greatly increased the comfort of observer and widened the field of view, the new periscope design was used in virtually every tank built after 1940. It was first implemented in TKS and 7TP Polish tanks. As a part of Polish-British pre-war military cooperation, the patent was sold to Vickers-Armstrong for one Polish Zloty / 1 PLN /. It was produced as Vickers Tank Periscope MK.IV (pictured), and built into all British tanks (such as Crusader, Churchill, Valentine, Cromwell). After the fall of Poland, Germany, USSR and Romania captured equipment, allowing them to copy the invention. In the USSR, the Gundlach periscope was known as MK-4 and implemented in all tanks (including the T-34 and T-70). All Axis tanks and APC (including tanks of Italy, Romania, Hungary, Finland and Japan) were equipped or retro-fitted with this periscope until 1941. The technology was later transferred to the USA and implemented as the M6 periscope in all US tanks (M3/M5 Stuart, M4 Sherman and others). After the Second World War the technology was adopted thorough the whole world. Even today, original Gundlach periscopes are used in some tanks and APCs.

The term refers to the difficulties and inconveniences that the user of a dictionary believes or feels are associated with consulting a particular dictionary or dictionary article. For example, the extensive use of abbreviations in articles in order to save space may annoy the user, because it is often difficult to read such condensed texts and understand the abbreviations, thereby increasing the lexicographic information costs. The important point in connection with lexicographic information costs is the relation between the information costs anticipated by the user and the information value the user expects to gain from consulting a dictionary or dictionary article. The more easily a user can navigate a dictionary and its articles, the lower the information costs and, hopefully, the more content with the dictionary the user will be. The higher the information costs of a dictionary, the more dissatisfied the user will be. There are two general types of lexicographic information costs: # the search costs are the efforts required by users when searching for something in dictionaries, i.e., the look-up activities required to find what they are looking for; and # the comprehension costs, which are the efforts required by users to understand and interpret the data in dictionaries. The concept of lexicographic information costs was first proposed by the Danish scholar and metalexicographer Sandro Nielsen (see below). The concept is relevant to lexicographers when planning and compiling a dictionary; for the users when consulting the dictionary; and for reviewers when evaluating a dictionary.

He is often considered one of the most important rulers in Wallachian history and a national hero of Romania. He was the second son of Vlad Dracul, who became the ruler of Wallachia in 1436. Vlad and his younger brother, Radu, were held as hostages in the Ottoman Empire in 1442 to secure their father's loyalty. Vlad's father and eldest brother, Mircea, were murdered after John Hunyadi, regent-governor of Hungary, invaded Wallachia in 1447. Hunyadi installed Vlad's second cousin, VladislavII, as the new voivode. Hunyadi launched a military campaign against the Ottomans in the autumn of 1448, and Vladislav accompanied him. Vlad broke into Wallachia with Ottoman support in October, but Vladislav returned and Vlad sought refuge in the Ottoman Empire before the end of the year. Vlad went to Moldavia in 1449 or 1450, and later to Hungary. Relations between Hungary and Vladislav later deteriorated, and in 1456 Vlad invaded Wallachia with Hungarian support. Vladislav died fighting against him. Vlad began a purge among the Wallachian boyars to strengthen his position. He came into conflict with the Transylvanian Saxons, who supported his opponents, Dan and Basarab LaiotƒÉ (who were Vladislav's brothers), and Vlad's illegitimate half-brother, Vlad the Monk. Vlad plundered the Saxon villages, taking the captured people to Wallachia where he had them impaled (which inspired his cognomen). Peace was restored in 1460. The Ottoman Sultan, Mehmed II, ordered Vlad to pay homage to him personally, but Vlad had the Sultan's two envoys captured and impaled. In February 1462, he attacked Ottoman territory, massacring tens of thousands of Turks and Bulgarians. Mehmed launched a campaign against Wallachia to replace Vlad with Vlad's younger brother, Radu. Vlad attempted to capture the sultan at T√¢rgovi»ôte during the night of 1617June 1462. The sultan and the main Ottoman army left Wallachia, but more and more Wallachians deserted to Radu. Vlad went to Transylvania to seek assistance from Matthias Corvinus, King of Hungary, in late 1462, but Corvinus had him imprisoned. Vlad was held in captivity in Visegr√°d from 1463 to 1475. During this period, anecdotes about his cruelty started to spread in Germany and Italy. He was released at the request of Stephen III of Moldavia in the summer of 1475. He fought in Corvinus's army against the Ottomans in Bosnia in early 1476. Hungarian and Moldavian troops helped him to force Basarab LaiotƒÉ (who had dethroned Vlad's brother, Radu) to flee from Wallachia in November. Basarab returned with Ottoman support before the end of the year. Vlad was killed in battle before 10January 1477. Books describing Vlad's cruel acts were among the first bestsellers in the German-speaking territories. In Russia, popular stories suggested that Vlad was able to strengthen central government only through applying brutal punishments, and a similar view was adopted by most Romanian historians in the 19th century. Vlad's reputation for cruelty and his patronymic inspired the name of the vampire Count Dracula.  Name  Vlad's father, Vlad Dracul The expression Dracula, which is now primarily known as the name of a fictional vampire, was for centuries known as the sobriquet of VladIII. Diplomatic reports and popular stories referred to him as Dracula, Dracuglia, or Drakula already in the 15thcentury. He himself signed his two letters as \\"Dragulya\\" or \\"Drakulya\\" in the late 1470s. His name had its origin in the sobriquet of his father, Vlad Dracul (\\"Vlad the Dragon\\" in medieval Romanian), who received it after he became a member of the Order of the Dragon. Dracula is the Slavonic genitive form of Dracul, meaning \\"[the son] of Dracul (or the Dragon)\\". In modern Romanian, dracul means \\"the devil\\", which contributed to Vlad's reputation. Vlad III is known as Vlad »öepe»ô (or Vlad the Impaler) in Romanian historiography. This sobriquet is connected to the impalement that was his favorite method of execution. The Ottoman writer Tursun Beg referred to him as ' (Impaler Lord) around 1500. Mircea the Shepherd, Voivode of Wallachia, used this sobriquet when referring to Vlad III in a letter of grant on 1April 1551.  Early life  Vlad was the second legitimate son of Vlad II Dracul, who was an illegitimate son of Mircea I of Wallachia. VladII had won the moniker \\"Dracul\\" for his membership in the Order of the Dragon, a militant fraternity founded by Holy Roman Emperor Sigismund. The Order of the Dragon was dedicated to halting the Ottoman advance into Europe. As he was old enough to be a candidate to the throne of Wallachia in 1448, his time of birth would have been between 1428 and 1431. Vlad was most probably born after his father settled in Transylvania in 1429. Historian Radu Florescu writes that Vlad was born in the Transylvanian Saxon town of Sighi»ôoara (then in the Kingdom of Hungary), where his father lived in a three-storey stone house from 1431 to 1435. Modern historians identify Vlad's mother either as a daughter or a kinswoman of Alexander I of Moldavia, or as his father's unknown first wife. The house in the main square of Sighi»ôoara where Vlad's father lived from 1431 to 1435 Vlad II Dracul seized Wallachia after the death of his half-brother Alexander I Aldea in 1436. One of his charters (which was issued on 20January 1437) preserved the first reference to Vlad III and his elder brother, Mircea, mentioning them as their father's \\"first born sons\\". They were mentioned in four further documents between 1437 and 1439. The last of the four charters also referred to their younger brother, Radu. After a meeting with John Hunyadi, Voivode of Transylvania, Vlad II Dracul did not support an Ottoman invasion of Transylvania in March 1442. The Ottoman Sultan, Murad II, ordered him to come to Gallipoli to demonstrate his loyalty. Vlad and Radu accompanied their father to the Ottoman Empire, where they were all imprisoned. Vlad Dracul was released before the end of the year, but Vlad and Radu remained hostages to secure his loyalty. They were held imprisoned in the fortress of Eƒürig√∂z (now Doƒürug√∂z), according to contemporaneous Ottoman chronicles. Their lives were especially in danger after their father supported Vladislaus, King of Poland and Hungary, against the Ottoman Empire during the Crusade of Varna in 1444. Vlad II Dracul was convinced that his two sons were \\"butchered for the sake of Christian peace\\", but neither Vlad nor Radu was murdered or mutilated after their father's rebellion. Vlad Dracul again acknowledged the sultan's suzerainty and promised to pay a yearly tribute to him in 1446 or 1447. John Hunyadi (who had become the regent-governor of Hungary in 1446) broke into Wallachia in November 1447. The Byzantine historian Michael Critobulus wrote that Vlad and Radu fled to the Ottoman Empire, which suggests that the sultan had allowed them to return to Wallachia after their father paid homage to him. Vlad Dracul and his eldest son, Mircea, were murdered. Hunyadi made Vladislav II (son of Vlad Dracul's cousin, Dan II) the ruler of Wallachia.  Reigns   First rule  Lands ruled around 1390 by Vlad the Impaler's grandfather, Mircea I of Wallachia (the lands on the right side of the Danube had been lost to the Ottomans before Vlad's reign) Upon the death of his father and elder brother, Vlad became a potential claimant to Wallachia. VladislavII of Wallachia accompanied John Hunyadi, who launched a campaign against the Ottoman Empire in September 1448. Taking advantage of his opponent's absence, Vlad broke into Wallachia at the head of an Ottoman army in early October. He had to accept that the Ottomans had captured the fortress of Giurgiu on the Danube and strengthened it. The Ottomans defeated Hunyadi's army in the Battle of Kosovo between 17and 18October. Hunyadi's deputy, Nicholas V√≠zaknai, urged Vlad to come to meet him in Transylvania, but Vlad refused him. VladislavII returned to Wallachia at the head of the remnants of his army. Vlad was forced to flee to the Ottoman Empire before 7December 1448.  In exile  Vlad first settled in Edirne in the Ottoman Empire after his fall. Not long after, he moved to Moldavia, where BogdanII (his father's brother-in-law and possibly his maternal uncle) had mounted the throne with John Hunyadi's support in the autumn of 1449. After Bogdan was murdered by Peter III Aaron in October 1451, Bogdan's son, Stephen, fled to Transylvania with Vlad to seek assistance from Hunyadi. However, Hunyadi concluded a three-year truce with the Ottoman Empire on 20November 1451, acknowledging the Wallachian boyars' right to elect the successor of VladislavII if he died. Vlad allegedly wanted to settle in Bra»ôov (which was a center of the Wallachian boyars expelled by VladislausII), but Hunyadi forbade the burghers to give shelter to him on 6February 1452. Vlad returned to Moldavia where AlexƒÉndrel had dethroned Peter Aaron. The events of his life during the years that followed are unknown. He must have returned to Hungary before 3July 1456, because on that day Hunyadi informed the townspeople of Bra»ôov that he had tasked Vlad with the defence of the Transylvanian border.  Second rule  = Consolidation = Ruins of the in T√¢rgovi»ôte The circumstances and the date of Vlad's return to Wallachia are uncertain. He invaded Wallachia with Hungarian support either in April, July or August 1456. VladislavII died during the invasion. Vlad sent his first extant letter as voivode of Wallachia to the burghers of Bra»ôov on 10September. He promised to protect them in case of an Ottoman invasion of Transylvania, but he also sought their assistance if the Ottomans occupied Wallachia. In the same letter, he stated that \\"when a man or a prince is strong and powerful he can make peace as he wants to; but when he is weak, a stronger one will come and do what he wants to him\\", showing his authoritarian personality. Multiple sources (including Laonikos Chalkokondyles's chronicle) recorded that hundreds or thousands of people were executed at Vlad's order at the beginning of his reign. He began a purge against the boyars who had participated in the murder of his father and elder brother, or whom he suspected of plotting against him. Chalkokondyles stated that Vlad \\"quickly effected a great change and utterly revolutionized the affairs of Wallachia\\" through granting the \\"money, property, and other goods\\" of his victims to his retainers. The lists of the members of the princely council during Vlad's reign also show that only two of them (Voico Dobri»õa and Iova) were able to retain their positions between 1457 and 1461. = Conflict with the Saxons = Vlad sent the customary tribute to the sultan. After John Hunyadi died on 11August 1456, his elder son, Ladislaus Hunyadi became the captain-general of Hungary. He accused Vlad of having \\"no intention of remaining faithful\\" to the king of Hungary in a letter to the burghers of Bra»ôov, also ordering them to support VladislausII's brother, DanIII, against Vlad. The burghers of Sibiu supported another pretender, \\"a priest of the Romanians who calls himself a Prince's son\\". The latter (identified as Vlad's illegitimate brother, Vlad the Monk) took possession of Amla»ô, which had customarily been held by the rulers of Wallachia in Transylvania. seats (or administrative units) of the Transylvanian Saxons Ladislaus V of Hungary had Ladislaus Hunyadi executed on 16March 1457. Hunyadi's mother, Erzs√©bet Szil√°gyi, and her brother, Michael Szil√°gyi, stirred up a rebellion against the king. Taking advantage of the civil war in Hungary, Vlad assisted Stephen, son of BogdanII of Moldavia, in his move to seize Moldavia in June 1457. Vlad also broke into Transylvania and plundered the villages around Bra»ôov and Sibiu. The earliest German stories about Vlad recounted that he had carried \\"men, women, children\\" from a Saxon village to Wallachia and had them impaled. Since the Transylvanian Saxons remained loyal to the king, Vlad's attack against them strengthened the position of the Szil√°gyis. Vlad's representatives participated in the peace negotiations between Michael Szil√°gyi and the Saxons. According to their treaty, the burghers of Bra»ôov agreed that they would expel Dan from their town. Vlad promised that the merchants of Sibiu could freely \\"buy and sell\\" goods in Wallachia in exchange for the \\"same treatment\\" of the Wallachian merchants in Transylvania. Vlad referred to Michael Szil√°gyi as \\"his Lord and elder brother\\" in a letter on 1December 1457. Ladislaus Hunyadi's younger brother, Matthias Corvinus, was elected king of Hungary on 24January 1458. He ordered the burghers of Sibiu to keep the peace with Vlad on 3March. Vlad styled himself \\"Lord and ruler over all of Wallachia, and the duchies of Amla»ô and FƒÉgƒÉra»ô\\" on 20September 1459, showing that he had taken possession of both of these traditional Transylvanian fiefs of the rulers of Wallachia. Michael Szil√°gyi allowed the boyar Michael (an official of VladislavII of Wallachia) and other Wallachian boyars to settle in Transylvania in late March 1458. Before long, Vlad had the boyar Michael killed. In May, Vlad asked the burghers of Bra»ôov to send craftsmen to Wallachia, but his relationship with the Saxons deteriorated before the end of the year. According to a scholarly theory, the conflict emerged after Vlad forbade the Saxons to enter Wallachia, forcing them to sell their goods to Wallachian merchants at compulsory border fairs. Vlad's protectionist tendencies or border fairs are not documented. Instead, in 1476 Vlad emphasized that he had always promoted free trade during his reign. The Saxons confiscated the steel that a Wallachian merchant had bought in Bra»ôov without repaying the price to him. In response, Vlad \\"ransacked and tortured\\" some Saxon merchants, according to a letter that Basarab LaiotƒÉ (a son of DanII of Wallachia) wrote on 21January 1459. Basarab had settled in Sighi»ôoara and laid claim to Wallachia. However, Matthias Corvinus supported DanIII (who was again in Bra»ôov) against Vlad. DanIII stated that Vlad had Saxon merchants and their children impaled or burnt alive in Wallachia. Dan III broke into Wallachia, but Vlad defeated and executed him before 22April 1460. Vlad invaded southern Transylvania and destroyed the suburbs of Bra»ôov, ordering the impalement of all men and women who had been captured. During the ensuing negotiations, Vlad demanded the expulsion or punishment of all Wallachian refugees from Bra»ôov. Peace had been restored before 26July 1460, when Vlad addressed the burghers of Bra»ôov as his \\"brothers and friends\\". Vlad invaded the region around Amla»ô and FƒÉgƒÉra»ô on 24August to punish the local inhabitants who had supported DanIII. = Ottoman war = The Ottoman Sultan, Mehmed II, who invaded Wallachia during Vlad's reign Konstantin Mihailoviƒá (who served as a janissary in the sultan's army) recorded that Vlad refused to pay homage to the sultan in an unspecified year. The Renaissance historian Giovanni Maria degli Angiolelli likewise wrote that Vlad had failed to pay tribute to the sultan for three years. Both records suggest that Vlad ignored the suzerainty of the Ottoman Sultan, Mehmed II, already in 1459, but both works were written decades after the events. Tursun Beg (a secretary in the sultan's court) stated that Vlad only turned against the Ottoman Empire when the sultan \\"was away on the long expedition in Trebizon\\" in 1461. According to Tursun Beg, Vlad started new negotiations with Matthias Corvinus, but the sultan was soon informed by his spies. Mehmed sent his envoy, the Greek Thomas Katabolinos (also known as Yunus bey), to Wallachia, ordering Vlad to come to Constantinople. He also sent secret instructions to Hamza, bey of Nicopolis, to capture Vlad after he crossed the Danube. Vlad found out the sultan's \\"deceit and trickery\\", captured Hamza and Katabolinos, and had them executed. After the execution of the Ottoman officials, Vlad gave orders in fluent Turkish to the commander of the fortress of Giurgiu to open the gates, enabling the Wallachian soldiers to break in the fortress and capture it. He invaded the Ottoman Empire, devastating the villages along the Danube. He informed Matthias Corvinus about the military action in a letter on 11February 1462. He stated that more than \\"23,884 Turks and Bulgarians\\" had been killed at his order during the campaign. He sought military assistance from Corvinus, declaring that he had broken the peace with the sultan \\"for the honor\\" of the king and the Holy Crown of Hungary and \\"for the preservation of Christianity and the strengthening of the Catholic faith\\". The relationship between Moldavia and Wallachia had become tense by 1462, according to a letter of the Genoese governor of Kaffa. Having learnt of Vlad's invasion, Mehmed II raised an army of more than 150,000 strong, that was said to be \\"second in size only to the one\\"Laonikos Chalkokondyles: The Histories (Book 9, chapter 90), p. 377. that occupied Constantinople in 1453, according to Chalkokondyles. The size of the army suggests that the sultan wanted to occupy Wallachia, according to a number of historians (including Franz Babinger, Radu Florescu, and Nicolae Stoicescu). On the other hand, Mehmed had granted Wallachia to Vlad's brother, Radu, before the invasion of Wallachia, showing that the sultan's principal purpose was only the change of the ruler of Wallachia. The Battle with Torches, a painting by Theodor Aman about Vlad's Night Attack at T√¢rgovi»ôte The Ottoman fleet landed at BrƒÉila (which was the only Wallachian port on the Danube) in May. The main Ottoman army crossed the Danube under the command of the sultan at Nicoplis on 4June 1462. Outnumbered by the enemy, Vlad adopted a scorched earth policy and retreated towards T√¢rgovi»ôte. During the night of 1617 June, Vlad broke into the Ottoman camp in an attempt to capture or kill the sultan. Either the imprisonment or the death of the sultan would have caused a panic among the Ottomans, which could have enabled Vlad to defeat the Ottoman army. However, the Wallachians \\"missed the court of the sultan himself\\"Laonikos Chalkokondyles: The Histories (Book 9, chapter 101), p. 387. and attacked the tents of the viziers Mahmut Pasha and Isaac. Having failed to attack the sultan's camp, Vlad and his retainers left the Ottoman camp at dawn. Mehmed entered T√¢rgovi»ôte at the end of June. The town had been deserted, but the Ottomans were horrified to discover a \\"forest of the impaled\\" (thousands of stakes with the carcasses of executed people), according to Chalkokondyles. Tursun Beg recorded that the Ottomans suffered from summer heat and thirst during the campaign. The sultan decided to retreat from Wallachia and marched towards BrƒÉila. StephenIII of Moldavia hurried to Chilia (now Kiliya in Ukraine) to seize the important fortress where a Hungarian garrison had been placed. Vlad also departed for Chilia, but left behind a troop of 6,000 strong to try to hinder the march of the sultan's army, but the Ottomans defeated the Wallachians. Stephen of Moldavia was wounded during the siege of Chilia and returned to Moldavia before Vlad came to the fortress. The main Ottoman army left Wallachia, but Vlad's brother Radu and his Ottoman troops stayed behind in the BƒÉrƒÉgan Plain. Radu sent messengers to the Wallachians, reminding them that the sultan could again invade their country. Although Vlad defeated Radu and his Ottoman allies in two battles during the following months, more and more Wallachians deserted to Radu. Vlad withdrew to the Carpathian Mountains, hoping that Matthias Corvinus would help him regain his throne. However, Albert of Istenmez≈ë, the deputy of the Count of the Sz√©kelys, had recommended in mid-August that the Saxons recognize Radu. Radu also made an offer to the burghers of Bra»ôov to confirm their commercial privileges and pay them a compensation of 15,000 ducats.  Imprisonment in Hungary  Renaissance palaces of Matthias Corvinus's summer residence at Visegr√°d (engraving from the 1480s) Matthias Corvinus came to Transylvania in November 1462. The negotiations between Corvinus and Vlad lasted for weeks, but Corvinus did not want to wage war against the Ottoman Empire. At the king's order, his Czech mercenary commander, John Jiskra of Brand√Ωs, captured Vlad near RucƒÉr in Wallachia. To provide an explanation for Vlad's imprisonment to Pope Pius II and the Venetians (who had sent money to finance a campaign against the Ottoman Empire), Corvinus presented three letters, allegedly written by Vlad on 7November 1462, to MehmedII, Mahmud Pasha, and Stephen of Moldavia. According to the letters, Vlad offered to join his forces with the sultan's army against Hungary if the sultan restored him to his throne. Most historians agree that the documents were forged to give grounds for Vlad's imprisonment. Corvinus's court historian, Antonio Bonfini, admitted that the reason for Vlad's imprisonment was never clarified. Florescu writes, \\"[T]he style of writing, the rhetoric of meek submission (hardly compatible with what we know of Dracula's character), clumsy wording, and poor Latin\\" are all evidence that the letters could not be written on Vlad's order. He associates the author of the forgery with a Saxon priest of Bra»ôov. Vlad was first imprisoned \\"in the city of Belgrade\\"Laonikos Chalkokondyles: The Histories (Book 10, chapter 1), p. 401. (now Alba Iulia in Romania), according to Chalkokondyles. Before long, he was taken to Visegr√°d, where he was held for fourteen years. No documents referring to Vlad between 1462 and 1475 have been preserved. In the summer of 1475, StephenIII of Moldavia sent his envoys to Matthias Corvinus, asking him to send Vlad to Wallachia against Basarab LaiotƒÉ, who had submitted himself to the Ottomans. Stephen wanted to secure Wallachia for a ruler who had been an enemy of the Ottoman Empire, because \\"the Wallachians [were] like the Turks\\" to the Moldavians, according to his letter. According to the Slavic stories about Vlad, he was only released after he converted to Catholicism.  Third rule and death  Matthias Corvinus recognized Vlad as the lawful prince of Wallachia, but he did not provide him military assistance to regain his principality. Vlad settled in a house in Pest. When a group of soldiers broke into the house while pursuing a thief who had tried to hide there, Vlad had their commander executed because they had not asked his permission before entering his home, according to the Slavic stories about his life. Vlad moved to Transylvania in June 1475. He wanted to settle in Sibiu and sent his envoy to the town in early June to arrange a house for him. MehmedII acknowledged Basarab LaiotƒÉ as the lawful ruler of Wallachia. Corvinus ordered the burghers of Sibiu to give 200 golden florins to Vlad from the royal revenues on 21September, but Vlad left Transylvania for Buda in October. Vlad bought a house in P√©cs that became known as Drakula h√°za (\\"Dracula's house\\" in Hungarian). In January 1476 John Pongr√°c of Dengeleg, Voivode of Transylvania, urged the people of Bra»ôov to send to Vlad all those of his supporters who had settled in the town, because Corvinus and Basarab LaiotƒÉ had concluded a treaty. The relationship between the Transylvanian Saxons and Basarab remained tense, and the Saxons gave shelter to Basarab's opponents during the following months. Corvinus dispatched Vlad and the Serbian Vuk Grgureviƒá to fight against the Ottomans in Bosnia in early 1476. They captured Srebrenica and other fortresses in February and March 1476. Basarab LaiotƒÉ, who tried to defend his throne against Vlad with Ottoman support Mehmed II invaded Moldavia and defeated StephenIII in the Battle of Valea AlbƒÉ on 26July 1476. Stephen B√°thory and Vlad entered Moldavia, forcing the sultan to lift the siege of the fortress at T√¢rgu Neam»õ in late August, according to a letter of Matthias Corvinus. The contemporaneous Jakob Unrest added that Vuk Grgureviƒá and a member of the noble Jak≈°iƒá family also participated in the struggle against the Ottomans in Moldavia. Matthias Corvinus ordered the Transylvanian Saxons to support B√°thory's planned invasion of Wallachia on 6September 1476, also informing them that Stephen of Moldavia would also invade Wallachia. Vlad stayed in Bra»ôov and confirmed the commercial privileges of the local burghers in Wallachia on 7October 1476. B√°thory's forces captured T√¢rgovi»ôte on 8November. Stephen of Moldavia and Vlad ceremoniously confirmed their alliance, and they occupied Bucharest, forcing Basarab LaiotƒÉ to seek refuge in the Ottoman Empire on 16November. Vlad informed the merchants of Bra»ôov about his victory, urging them to come to Wallachia. He was crowned before 26November. Basarab LaiotƒÉ returned to Wallachia with Ottoman support, and Vlad died fighting against them in late December 1476 or early January 1477. In a letter written on 10January 1477, StephenIII of Moldavia related that Vlad's Moldavian retinue had also been massacred. According to Leonardo Botta, the Milanese ambassador to Buda, the Ottomans cut Vlad's corpse into pieces. Bonfini wrote that Vlad's head was sent to MehmedII. The place of his burial is unknown. According to popular tradition (which was first recorded in the late 19th century), Vlad was buried in the Monastery of Snagov. However, the excavations carried out by Dinu V. Rosetti in 1933 found no tomb below the supposed \\"unmarked tombstone\\" of Vlad in the monastery church. Rosetti reported: \\"Under the tombstone attributed to Vlad there was no tomb. Only many bones and jaws of horses.\\" Historian Constantin Rezachevici said Vlad was most probably buried in the first church of the Comana Monastery, which had been established by Vlad and was near the battlefield where he was killed.  Family  Vlad had two wives, according to modern specialists. His first wife may have been an illegitimate daughter of John Hunyadi, according to historian Alexandru Simon. Vlad's second wife was Jusztina Szil√°gyi, who was a cousin of Matthias Corvinus. She was the widow of Vencel Pongr√°c of Szentmikl√≥s when \\"Ladislaus Dragwlya\\" married her, most probably in 1475. She survived Vlad Dracul, and first married P√°l Suki, then J√°nos Erd√©lyi. Vlad's eldest son, Mihnea, was born in 1462. Vlad's unnamed second son was killed before 1486. Vlad's third son, Vlad Drakwlya, unsuccessfully laid claim to Wallachia around 1495. He was the forefather of the noble Drakwla family.  Legacy   Reputation for cruelty  = First records = Stories about Vlad's brutal acts began circulating during his lifetime. After his arrest, courtiers of Matthias Corvinus promoted their spread. The papal legate, Niccolo Modrussiense, had already written about such stories to Pope PiusII in 1462. Two years later, the pope included them in his Commentaries. The meistersinger Michael Beheim wrote a lengthy poem about Vlad's deeds, allegedly based on his conversation with a Catholic monk who had managed to escape from Vlad's prison. The poem, called ' (\\"Story of a Despot Called Dracula, Voievod of Wallachia\\"), was performed at the court of Frederick III, Holy Roman Emperor in Wiener Neustadt during the winter of 1463. According to one of Beheim's stories, Vlad had two monks impaled to assist them to go to heaven, also ordering the impalement of their donkey because it began braying after its masters' death. Beheim also accused Vlad of duplicity, stating that Vlad had promised support to both Matthias Corvinus and MehmedII but did not keep the promise. In 1475, Gabriele Rangoni, Bishop of Eger (and a former papal legate), understood that Vlad had been imprisoned because of his cruelty. Rangoni also recorded the rumour that while in prison Vlad caught rats to cut them up into pieces or stuck them on small pieces of wood, because he was unable to \\"forget his wickedness\\". Antonio Bonfini also recorded anecdotes about Vlad in his Historia Pannonica around 1495. Bonfini wanted to justify both the removal and the restoration of Vlad by Matthias. He described Vlad as \\"a man of unheard cruelty and justice\\". Bonfini's stories about Vlad were repeated in Sebastian M√ºnster's Cosmography. M√ºnster also recorded Vlad's \\"reputation for tyrannical justice\\". = German stories = 1499 German woodcut showing Dracule waide dining among the impaled corpses of his victims Works containing the stories about Vlad's cruelty were published in Low German in the Holy Roman Empire before 1480. The stories were allegedly written in the early 1460s, because they describe Vlad's campaign across the Danube in early 1462, but they do not refer to MehmedII's invasion of Wallachia in June of the same year. They provide a detailed narration of the conflicts between Vlad and the Transylvanian Saxons, showing that they originated \\"in the literary minds of the Saxons\\". The stories about Vlad's plundering raids in Transylvania were clearly based on an eyewitness account, because they contain accurate details (including the lists of the churches destroyed by Vlad and the dates of the raids). They describe Vlad as a \\"demented psychopath, a sadist, a gruesome murderer, a masochist\\", worse than Caligula and Nero. However, the stories emphasizing Vlad's cruelty are to be treated with cautionDavid \\"Race\\" Bannon, ‚ÄúDracula‚Äôs Art of War: A Martial Portrait of Vlad III Tepes,‚Äù Kungfu, Nov 2000: 18-19, 58-59. because his brutal acts were very probably exaggerated (or even invented) by the Saxons. The invention of movable type printing contributed to the popularity of the stories about Vlad, making them one of the first \\"bestsellers\\" in Europe. To enhance sales, they were published in books with woodcuts on their title pages that depicted horrific scenes. For instance, the editions published in Nuremberg in 1499 and in Strasbourg in 1500 depict Vlad dining at a table surrounded by dead or dying people on poles. = Slavic stories = There are more than twenty manuscripts (written between the 15th and 18th centuries) which preserved the text of the Skazanie o Drakule voievode (The Tale about Voivode Dracula). The manuscripts were written in Russian, but they copied a text that had originally been recorded in a South Slavic language, because they contain expressions alien to the Russian language but used in South Slavic idioms (such as diavol for \\"evil\\"). The original text was written in Buda between 1482 and 1486. The nineteen anecdotes in the Skazanie are longer than the German stories about Vlad. They are a mixture of fact and fiction, according to historian Raymond T. McNally. Almost half of the anecdotes emphasize, like the German stories, Vlad's brutality, but they also underline that his cruelty enabled him to strengthen the central government in Wallachia. For instance, the Skazanie writes of a golden cup that nobody dared to steal at a fountain because Vlad \\"hated stealing so violently ... that anybody who caused any evil or robbery ... did not live long\\", thereby promoting public order, and the German story about Vlad's campaign against Ottoman territory underlined his cruel acts while the Skazanie emphasized his successful diplomacy calling him \\"zlomudry\\" or \\"evil-wise\\". On the other hand, the Skazanie sharply criticized Vlad for his conversion to Catholicism, attributing his death to this apostasy. Some elements of the anecdotes were later added to Russian stories about Ivan the Terrible of Russia. = Assertion by modern standards = The mass murders that Vlad carried out indiscriminately and brutally would most likely amount to acts of genocide and war crimes by current standards.Michael Arntfield, Springer, 2016, Gothic Forensics: Criminal Investigative Procedure in Victorian Horror & Mystery, p. 109 Romanian defense minister Ioan Mircea Pa»ôcu asserted that Vlad would have been condemned for crimes against humanity had he been put on trial at Nuremberg.Henry F. Carey, Lexington Books, 2004, Romania Since 1989: Politics, Economics, and Society, p. 87  National hero  Ruins of Poienari Castle, the scene of a popular tale about Vlad Vlad the Impaler and the Turkish envoys, painting by Theodor Aman The Cantacuzino Chronicle was the first Romanian historical work to record a tale about Vlad the Impaler, narrating the impalement of the old boyars of T√¢rgovi»ôte for the murder of his brother, Dan. The chronicle added that Vlad forced the young boyars and their wives and children to build the Poienari Castle. The legend of the Poienari Castle was mentioned in 1747 by NeofitI, Metropolitan of Ungro‚ÄìWallachia, who complemented it with the story of Me»ôterul Manole, who allegedly walled in his bride to prevent the crumbling of the walls of the castle during the building project. In the early 20th century, Constantin RƒÉdulescu-Codin, a teacher in Muscel County where the castle was situated, published a local legend about Vlad's letter of grant \\"written on rabbit skin\\" for the villagers who had helped him to escape from Poienari Castle to Transylvania during the Ottoman invasion of Wallachia. In other villages of the region, the donation is attributed to the legendary Radu Negru. RƒÉdulescu- Codin recorded further local legends, some of which are also known from the German and Slavic stories about Vlad, suggesting that the latter stories preserved oral tradition. For instance, the tales about the burning of the lazy, the poor, and the lame at Vlad's order and the execution of the woman who had made her husband too short a shirt can also be found among the German and Slavic anecdotes. The peasants telling the tales knew that Vlad's sobriquet was connected to the frequent impalements during his reign, but they said only such cruel acts could secure public order in Wallachia. Most Romanian artists have regarded Vlad as a just ruler and a realistic tyrant who punished criminals and executed unpatriotic boyars to strengthen the central government. Ion Budai-Deleanu wrote the first Romanian epic poem focusing on him. Deleanu's »öiganiada (Gypsy Epic) (which was published only in 1875, almost a century after its composition) presented Vlad as a hero fighting against the boyars, Ottomans, strigoi (or vampires), and other evil spirits at the head of an army of gypsies and angels. The poet Dimitrie Bolintineanu emphasized Vlad's triumphs in his Battles of the Romanians in the middle of the 19thcentury. He regarded Vlad as a reformer whose acts of violence were necessary to prevent the despotism of the boyars. One of the greatest Romanian poets, Mihai Eminescu, dedicated a historic ballad, The Third Letter, to the valiant princes of Wallachia, including Vlad. He urges Vlad to return from the grave and to annihilate the enemies of the Romanian nation: In the early 1860s, the painter Theodor Aman depicted the meeting of Vlad and the Ottoman envoys, showing the envoys' fear of the Wallachian ruler. Since the middle of the 19th century, Romanian historians have treated Vlad as one of the greatest Romanian rulers, emphasizing his fight for the independence of the Romanian lands. Even Vlad's acts of cruelty were often represented as rational acts serving national interest. Alexandru Dimitrie Xenopol was one of the first historians to emphasize that Vlad could only stop the internal fights of the boyar parties through his acts of terror. Constantin C. Giurescu remarked, \\"The tortures and executions which [Vlad] ordered were not out of caprice, but always had a reason, and very often a reason of state.\\" Ioan Bogdan was one of the few Romanian historians who did not accept this heroic image. In his work published in 1896, Vlad »öepe»ô and the German and Russian Narratives, he concluded that the Romanians should be ashamed of Vlad, instead of presenting him as \\"a model of courage and patriotism\\". According to an opinion poll conducted in 1999, 4.1% of the participants chose Vlad the Impaler as one of \\"the most important historical personalities who have influenced the destiny of the Romanians for the better\\".  Vampire mythology  The stories about Vlad made him the best-known medieval ruler of the Romanian lands in Europe. However, Bram Stoker's Dracula, which was published in 1897, was the first book to make a connection between Dracula and vampirism. Stoker had his attention drawn to the blood-sucking vampires of Romanian folklore by Emily Gerard's article about Transylvanian superstitions (published in 1885). His limited knowledge about the medieval history of Wallachia came from William Wilkinson's book entitled Account of the Principalities of Wallachia and Moldavia with Political Observations Relative to Them, published in 1820. Stoker \\"apparently did not know much about\\" Vlad the Impaler, \\"certainly not enough for us to say that Vlad was the inspiration for\\" Count Dracula, according to Elizabeth Miller. For instance, Stoker wrote that Dracula had been of Sz√©kely origin only because he knew about both Attila the Hun's destructive campaigns and the alleged Hunnic origin of the Sz√©kelys. Stoker's main source, Wilkinson, who accepted the reliability of the German stories, described Vlad as a wicked man. Actually, Stoker's working papers for his book contain no references to the historical figure, the name of the character being named in all draughts but the later ones 'Count Wampyr'. Consequently, Stoker borrowed the name and \\"scraps of miscellaneous information\\" about the history of Wallachia when writing his book about Count Dracula.  Appearance and representations  Pope Pius II's legate, Niccol√≤ Modrussa, painted the only extant description of Vlad, whom he had met in Buda. A copy of Vlad's portrait has been featured in the \\"monster portrait gallery\\" in the Ambras Castle at Innsbruck. The picture depicts \\"a strong, cruel, and somehow tortured man\\" with \\"large, deep-set, dark green, and penetrating eyes\\", according to Florescu. The color of Vlad's hair cannot be determined, because Modrussa mentions that Vlad was black-haired, while the portrait seems to show that he had fair hair. The picture depicts Vlad with a large lower lip. Vlad's bad reputation in the German-speaking territories can be detected in a number of Renaissance paintings. He was portrayed among the witnesses of Saint Andrew's martyrdom in a 15th-century painting, displayed in the Belvedere in Vienna. A figure similar to Vlad is one of the witnesses of Christ in the Calvary in a chapel of the St. Stephen's Cathedral in Vienna.

The office was created by the Constitution of 1949 (Section V). The president of the Republic was elected by the People's Chamber (Volkskammer) and the Chamber of States (Landerkammer), the two chambers of parliament. The office was mostly ceremonial in nature. If necessary, the President of the Volkskammer acted as the president of the Republic. The sole incumbent was Wilhelm Pieck of the Socialist Unity Party of Germany (SED), elected on 11 October 1949Wilhelm Pieck timeline Retrieved 10 June 2010 and re-elected in 1953 and in 1957. Shortly after the death of Pieck on 7 September 1960, the Constitution was amended. The Law concerning the formation of the State Council of 12 September 1960 introduced a collective head of state instead of the presidency, the State Council of East Germany. In the last, democratic phase of East Germany in 1989/90, the State Council was abolished; President of the People's Chamber Sabine Bergmann-Pohl acted as head of state.  Election  The president of the Republic was elected for a term of four years by a joint session of the Volkskammer and the Landerkammer, which was convened and presided over by the President of the Volkskammer.Article 101 of the Constitution of 1949. Any citizen who was at least thirty-five years old was eligible for the post. The administrative reform of 1952 led to the dissolution of the states (L√§nder) of East Germany. The Landerkammer thereby became meaningless; it met in 1954 for the last time and was formally abolished in 1958. As a result, the Volkskammer alone was responsible for the election of the president.  Oath of office  On assuming office, the president of the Republic took the following oath before a joint session of the Volkskammer and the Landerkammer:Article 102 of the Constitution of 1949.  Impeachment  The president of the Republic might be recalled before the expiration of his term by a joint resolution of the Volkskammer and the Landerkammer. Such a resolution required a two-thirds majority of the statutory number of representatives.Article 103 of the Constitution of 1949.  Duties and competences  Largely a ceremonial position (similarly to the president of West Germany), the duties and competences of the president of the Republic as stipulated in articles 104‚Äì108 of the Constitution of 1949: * Promulgating the laws of the Republic.Article 104 of the Constitution of 1949. * Receiving the oath of office from members of the Council of Ministers upon their assumption of duties. * Representing the Republic in international relations.Article 105 of the Constitution of 1949. * Concluding and signing treaties with foreign countries on behalf of the Republic. * Accrediting and receiving ambassadors and ministers. To become effective, all orders and decrees issued by the president of the Republic needed to be countersigned by the chairman of the Council of Ministers or the competent Minister.Article 106 of the Constitution of 1949. The president exercised the right of pardon on behalf of the Republic. In this function he was advised by a committee of the Volkskammer.Article 107 of the Constitution of 1949.  Incapacitation and vacancy  Whenever the president of the Republic was unable to attend to his office, he was represented by the president of the Volkskammer. If such incapacity is expected to continue for a protracted period, a substitute was to be appointed by (a specific) law.Article 108 of the Constitution of 1949. Whenever the presidency was terminated prematurely, the same rule applied until the election of a new president. President Pieck was already 73 years old when he won his first term in 1949. Although he served as co-chairman of the SED alongside Prime Minister Otto Grotewohl from 1949 to 1950, he never played a major role in the party. Most of the power was held by Walter Ulbricht, First Secretary of the party from 1950. This changed after the abolition of the presidential office, since the leader of the SED was usually also the Chairman of the State Council.  Abolition  After Wilhelm Pieck had died in 1960, the presidency was abolished in favor of a collective body, the State Council. The State Council was elected in the same way as the president, by the Volkskammer, and exercised the powers of the presidency. The State Council was effectively represented by its chairman. With the Constitution of 1968, the last references to the presidency were eliminated. After the Peaceful Revolution, there were plans to reintroduce the office of the president of the Republic by constitutional law from 1990 onward, which did not happen in the course of German reunification.

Background In 1235 Emperor Frederick was in Germany to quell the rebellion of his son Henry. In the autumn of that year he decided to return to Italy to suppress the Lombard communes which, backed by Pope Gregory IX, were contesting his authority. He arrived at Valeggio, near Verona, and, with the help of Ezzelino III da Romano and other Ghibelline leaders, sacked the city of Vicenza. Satisfied with this first outcome, he came back to Germany to deal with another German princes' rebellion, leaving Hermann von Salza, Grand Master of the Teutonic Order, in Italy to monitor the situation. In August 1237 the emperor returned again to Italy, this time aiming to definitively crush the Second Lombard League. He crossed the Alps to Verona and here his 2,000 knights were joined by Ezzelino III da Romano's troops, including soldiers from Treviso, Padua, Vicenza, and Verona itself, as well as by Tuscan men led by Gaboard of Arnstein. Later 6,000 infantry and horsemen from the Kingdom of Sicily came, including Apulian Muslim archers.These units intervened at the end of the battle ‚Äì \\"Emptying their quivers\\", as quoted by Pier delle Vigne The rest of the army was formed by Ghibellines from Cremona, Pavia, Modena, Parma, and Reggio, for a total of 12,000 ‚Äì 15,000 men The imperial army marched first against Mantua, which decided to surrender instead of being sacked, and then to Bergamo, whose council of nobles took the same decision in exchange for no formal submission. Frederick then invaded Brescia's territory, capturing Goito and Montichiari among the others, although the latter's resistance gave time for most of the Lombard League troops to reach Brescia. The 2,000-knights and 6,000-infantry strong army, led by Pietro Tiepolo, podest√† of Milan and son of the doge of Venice, occupied a favorable position at Manerbio (November 1237). The two armies remained fifteen days facing each other without battling, separated by a marsh that thwarted the knights' effectiveness. Frederick, whose army was becoming short of supply, left his camp in search of a more advantageous position, and on 24 November 1237 crossed the Oglio River, marching northwards to wait for the enemy's moves at Soncino. The battle The Lombards believed the rumors, skilfully spread by the emperor, that he was withdrawing to Cremona to spend the winter there. Therefore, they also started towards their winter quarters. However, Frederick had posted a contingent from Bergamo at Cividate al Piano, which would inform him of the Lombard movements through smoke signals. When the Lombard army had completed its crossing of Oglio at Pontoglio and Palazzolo, the imperial troops saw large clouds of smoke and moved to Cortenuova, which was 18 km from their current positions. The imperial vanguard included Saracens and horsemen, which were the first units to attack the withdrawing Lombards, followed by the infantry. Taken by surprise, the Milanese and Piacentines were unable to form a defense line, and fled to Cortenuova. When Frederick and his main force reached the battlefield, it was scattered with knights, slain or wounded and his passage blocked by riderless horses. At Cortenuova, other Milanese and troops from Alessandria rallied around their Carroccio, where the Lombards fought valiantly under the Saracen arrows and the Teutonic charges. A column of men from Milanese noble families, despite the arrival of other Bergamo troops, was able to protect the rest of the army's retreat to Cortenuova till nightfall. To keep the army's morale as high as possible, Frederick ordered his troop to sleep with their armor on, and to attack at the first light of dawn. On the other side, the podest√† of Milan, recognizing that the troops could not withstand another battle, ordered the abandonment of the town along with the Carroccio and the rest of the baggage. On the dawn of 28 November the Imperials attacked the hastily-retreating Lombards, who collapsed with minimal resistance. Many drowned in the Oglio, which was overflowing due to a flood. About 5,000 Lombards were captured, and the wounded and killed numbered several thousand. The Milanese alone lost 2,500 soldiers Of the battlefield, Pietro della Vigna recorded:. Aftermath The Lombard League's army was virtually annihilated. Frederick made a triumphal entrance in the allied city of Cremona, with the Carroccio towed by an elephant and Tiepolo chained on it. The latter was first detained in Apulia and then publicly executed in Trani. The Carroccio was later sent to Rome as a show of the imperial power. The Lombard League disbanded. Lodi, Novara, Vercelli, Chieri, and Savona were captured or submitted to the emperor, while Amadeus IV of Savoy and Boniface II of Montferrat confirmed their Ghibelline allegiance. Milan, Brescia, Piacenza, and Bologna remained alone in arms. Frederick, now at the top of his strength, besieged Milan. He rejected all Milanese peace overtures, insisting on unconditional surrender. Milan and five other cities, however, held out, and, in October 1238, he had to raise the siege of Brescia. The emperor then went on to invade the Papal States, and was excommunicated by Pope Gregory IX.

Its two sections connect the New South Wales South Coast to the Monaro region, and the Monaro to the South West Slopes via the Snowy Mountains. The higher altitude regions of this road are subject to snow over the winter months, and the road also provides access to many parts of the Snowy Mountains Scheme. The highway bears the B72 shield along its entire length. The highway originally bore the name Monaro Highway until 1958, when it received its current name. It originally ran from to but has been shortened to run from the Princes Highway to the Hume Highway instead. Part of the roadway was reallocated to what is now known as the Monaro Highway in 1955. Reservoirs created as a result of dams built in the 1950s and 1960s as part of the Snowy Mountains Scheme required the creation of major realignments to avoid submerged areas. Previous to New South Wales' conversion to alphanumeric route markers, it was signed as National Route 18. Route description The Snowy Mountains Highway begins at a T-intersection with the Princes Highway at , north of . It heads roughly west through hilly terrain, the terrain smooths eventually and the road crosses the Bemboka River at Morans Crossing. A short distance further the road passes through , taking on the name Loftus Street within the urban area. West of Bemboka the road follows the southern bank of the Bemboka River, before crossing the Nunnock River near its confluence with the Bemboka River at the base of the Great Dividing Range escarpment. Up until this point the immediate landscape surrounding the road has so far consisted of farmland. From the base of the range the road enters South East Forest National Park and follows a steep and winding alignment up the range from about above sea level, to over . At the top of the range the road then enters Glenbog State Forest before once again traversing farmland for a short distance until it meets the Monaro Highway at , south of . This intersection is a T-intersection, through traffic continues north on the Monaro Highway, while traffic heading to the south from either direction must turn. To reach the western section of the Snowy Mountains Highway the Monaro Highway must be taken north towards at this point. The western section begins at the Bombala and Sharp Street roundabout in Cooma. The highway takes on the name Sharp Street from this intersection as it heads west within Cooma urban area. Upon leaving Cooma, the road heads west via farmland to the village of . Here the road meets a T-intersection, with through traffic taking Kosciuszko Road southwest towards . The highway turns to continue on its westerly heading. The roadway then makes its way through undulating terrain for some distance before it passes through , and on into Kosciuszko National Park. The park boundary is marked by a sign, there are no park entry gates on the highway, and park entry fees are not payable. The road winds through mountainous terrain as it climbs towards the abandoned mining settlement of , situated at an altitude of around . The landscape becomes open grassland at this point and remains relatively flat as the road continues relatively gently up an alpine valley created by the Eucumbene River and its numerous tributaries. At the top of the valley the road reaches its highest point a little below . The road then descends into part of a similar valley created by the Murrumbidgee River as it passes by the access roads for Yarrangobilly Caves. The highway then veers northwest back into forested terrain and continues along the same rough heading through hilly terrain for some distance before a mountainous descent from , near the town of which is located a few kilometres west of the highway. Continuing on, the roadway passes by Jounama Dam and then roughly parallels the eastern side of Blowering Reservoir (created by Blowering Dam further downstream). It then leaves the National Park descending into farmland on the Tumut Plains, roughly above sea level. From here the highway then crosses the Tumut River and heads into the town of itself, taking on the names Blowering Street, Fitzroy Street, and Adelong Street within the urban area. West of Tumut the road crosses a large valley created by Gilmore Creek and Deep Creek, before a small climb through Adelong Gap into the town of , taking on the names Tumut Street, Inglis Street, and Lynch Street within the urban area. Beyond Adelong, the road continues northeast through undulating terrain before crossing Hillas Creek and then following it for the last few kilometres until the Snowy Mountains Highway's western terminus at the Hume Highway, located roughly halfway between and . High altitude sections subject to snow and ice have yellow lane markings and red reflector posts (which are sometimes double or triple height); in contrast to the white lines and posts generally seen elsewhere around Australia. It is recommended that snow chains are carried for all two-wheel drive vehicles travelling on this highway within Kosciuszko National Park during the winter months. History Snowy Mountains highway near Kiandra The Snowy Mountains Highway was listed as a State Highway by the New South Wales Main Roads Board (MRB) in their 1928 annual report. The following year, the MRB's hierarchical system which supported this listing was proclaimed with the passing of the Main Roads (Amendment) Act, April 1929. The highway was classified as State Highway 4, and originally known as the Monaro Highway. It ran from , via , , , and various other towns and villages, to . In 1933, the Department of Main Roads (DMR) which had succeeded the MRB in the previous year; proclaimed the portion of the Snowy Mountains Highway between Wagga Wagga and the Hume Highway at Lower Tarcutta to be part of the Sturt Highway. The Snowy Mountains Highway then terminated at its own junction with the Hume Highway instead. When the Snowy Mountains Scheme commenced in 1949, the road began to increase in importance. Roadworks to increase the standard of the road were undertaken, and were often paid for by the Snowy Mountains Hydro-Electric Authority. In 1955, it was decided that what was still then known as the Monaro Highway would be renamed as the Snowy Mountains Highway. This was done as only a relatively small portion of the road was actually within the Monaro region. The section of road between and was also reclassified as part of State Highway 19, which at that time ran from Canberra, to the Victorian border west of . The various roads classified as State Highway 19, were then named as the Monaro Highway in 1958. In contrast with the Snowy Mountains Highway, the entire length of that highway is within the Monaro region. Over the years further changes to the alignment have occurred. The eastern section of the highway no longer runs west to Nimittabel, instead meeting the Monaro Highway to the south; the old section has been renamed as Old Bega Road. It also no longer runs east to the coast at Tathra, and now terminates where it meets the Princes Highway; the section from Bega to Tathra has been renamed as Tathra Road. The western section has also seen some major changes with the highway being realigned to avoid Lake Eucumbene near due to the construction of Eucumbene Dam in the 1950s. Similarly realignment was required to avoid the Jounama Pondage and Blowering Reservoir near due to the construction of Jounama and Blowering Dams in the 1960s. Route markers Route markers were first introduced in Australia in late 1954. Over the following decades they were progressively rolled out to the various highways around the nation, under a nationwide route numbering scheme. Previous to the NSW conversion to alphanumeric routes in 2013, the highway was signed as National Route 18 shield along its entire length. In addition to this, the section of the Monaro Highway between Cooma and Steeple Flat was also signed the National Route 18 shield in addition to the National Route 23 route marker used along the remainder of its length within NSW; this kind of arrangement is known as a duplex or concurrency. This allowed one route to cover the highway from end to end. The Snowy Mountains Highway was allocated the alphanumeric route B72 as part of New South Wales' 2013 conversion. The route duplex along the Monaro Highway remains intact with B72 used in addition to B23 between Cooma and Steeple Flat.

Boats may be conveyed afloat, in caissons, or may be carried in cradles or slings. An inclined plane is quicker and wastes less water than a flight of canal locks, but is more costly to install and operate. A development of the idea is the water slope. An alternative to consecutive locks is a boat lift. Operation Typically, such a feature consists of a slope, with one or more rail tracks on it. Boats are raised between different levels by sailing into water-filled tanks, or caissons, with wheels on the bottom and watertight doors at each end. The caisson is mounted on an angled wheelbase, to keep it horizontal to the water level, and is generally aligned sideways to the slope. These are drawn up or down hill on the rails, usually by means of cables pulled by a stationary engine. In most designs two caissons are used, one going up and one down, acting as counterweights for greater efficiency. When the caisson has reached the top or bottom of the slope, the doors open and the boat leaves. There are also inclined planes without a tank or caisson, instead carrying vessels up out of the water cradled in slings or resting on their keels. In a few cases the boats were permanently fitted with wheels. History Inclined planes have evolved over the centuries. Some of the first were used by the Egyptians to bypass waterfalls on the Nile. These consisted of wooden slides covered with silt which reduced friction. Timeline *600BC ‚Äì The Diolkos, an early Greek inclined plane, was in use. *385AD ‚Äì Inclined planes were in use on the Grand Canal in China. *1167 ‚Äì Nieuwedamme overtoom (a simple type of incline) was built at Ypres. *1568 ‚Äì Wagon of Zafosina in use near Venice. *1773 ‚Äì John Edyvean proposed the use of inclined planes on the St. Columb Canal in Cornwall, UK. *1773 ‚Äì Inclined planes proposed on the projected Caldon Canal. (See Peter Lead, The Caldon Canal, Oakwood Press 1990.) *1777 ‚Äì 3 inclined planes or 'dry wherries' began operation on Dukart's Canal, near Coalisland, in the south-east of County Tyrone in Ulster.Hadfield's British Canals eighth edition Joseph Boughey Page 49 The inclines were a failure and were dismantled by 1787. *1788 ‚Äì An inclined plane was built by William Reynolds and used, for the first time in England, to raise canal boats on England's Ketley Canal. *1792 ‚Äì William Reynolds of Ketley Ironworks constructed several inclined planes on the Shropshire Canal. *1792 - 1921 ‚Äì In 1792 the Shropshire Tub Canals were built incorporating a number of inclined planes. One of these, the Trench plane closed in 1921 and brought to an end boat-carrying inclined planes in Britain *1793 ‚Äì American born inventor Robert Fulton wrote a letter to Lord Stanhope suggesting inclined planes instead of locks for Bude Canal in Cornwall. Lord Stanhope replied saying his idea for working the plane had already been thought of by Edmund Leach. *1794 ‚Äì Robert Fulton took out a British patent (# 1988), for improvements to inclined planes including a double inclined plane system to be used to raise canal boats without locks. *1795 - 1805 ‚Äì South Hadley Canal began operations, on the Connecticut River in Massachusetts, United States.

Scenic World is home to four attractions, the Scenic Railway, the Scenic Skyway, the Scenic Cableway and Scenic Walkway a 2.4 km elevated boardwalk through ancient rainforest. Onsite facilities also include free all-day parking. Overview Railway The Scenic Railway is an incline railway now used for tourism. The steepest section of track is on an incline of 52 degrees (128% gradient) contained within a total distance of . It was originally constructed for a coal and oil shale mining operation in the Jamison Valley in the 1880s, in order to haul the coal and shale from the valley floor up to the escarpment above. From 1928 to 1945 it carried coal during the week and passengers at weekends. The coal mine was closed in 1945 after which it remained as a tourist attraction. The Scenic Railway was temporarily closed on 13 January 2013 (although the Skyway, Cableway, and Walkway remained open) as construction to upgrade both tracks and carriages began. The work was completed and the railway reopened in April 2013. The Scenic Railway makes many claims to be the steepest passenger railway, the steepest funicular, and the steepest incline in the world. However the railway uses a winch system and no counterbalancing carriage, therefore it is an inclined lift rather than a funicular. the steepest true funicular is the Stoosbahn in Switzerland.  Skyway  Built in 1958 the Scenic Skyway is another cable-driven conveyance at Scenic World. It travels across the gorge above the Katoomba Falls, above the valley floor. The original Scenic Skyway was withdrawn on 4 April 2004 after 587,401 crossings and now sits in the picnic area at Scenic World. It was replaced by a new cabin in December of the same year. The new Skyway was built by Doppelmayr and CWA Constructions, and features a 72-person cabin with sections of liquid crystal glass that turns a raised section of the floor transparent as the ride progresses. In November 2005 a second station on the opposite cliff-face opened, allowing Skyway passengers to disembark and follow bush walking trails to the nearby Echo Point. In November 2017 the latest Scenic Skyway cabin was launched. The Skyway cabin is 30% bigger than its predecessor, offering visitors a more spacious ride with easier boarding, as well as free WiFi. Cableway In 2000 Scenic World installed the Sceniscender, now called Scenic Cableway, 84-passenger cable car from Doppelmayr that passes over a tower on the edge of the cliff, and then to the Botton Station in the Jamison Valley below.  Dining  Scenic World operates two food and beverage outlets, namely EATS270 and the Terrace Caf√©. The former Scenic Revolving Restaurant was renovated and reopened in late 2012 as an eatery. During this time a decision was made to cease operation of the revolving floor. The floor can still, however, be turned on by request for private functions. Both EATS270 and the Terrace Caf√© feature balcony areas with extensive outdoor seating overlooking the Three Sisters and Jamison Valley. Scenic World food and beverage outlets are not open in the evenings for general dining, but can be booked for private functions and corporate events.  Orphan Rocker  In 1984 Scenic World began building a roller coaster known as the Orphan Rocker, named after the nearby Orphan Rock.https://hikingtheworld.blog/2019/10/27/orphan-rock-blue-mountains/ This is the first roller coaster to be completely designed and manufactured in Australia. The highlight of this ride is meant to be a swooping banked turn that takes riders within metres of the edge of a cliff. It has in the past been referred to as a \\"sitdown suspended\\" coaster, because although it is a conventional sitdown coaster, the trains can tilt from side to side, like a suspended coaster, giving it its name. It was originally planned as a scenic monorail ride, but it soon evolved into a roller-coaster ride. The roller coaster has never publicly opened due to demands for redevelopment elsewhere onsite. Visitation to Scenic World in the 1980s was increasing rapidly, mostly due to increased numbers of Japanese visitors, necessitating additional access into the valley and the idea for Scenic World's third ride, The Cableway (originally Scenicscender), was born. Portions of the coaster's track has been removed as of 2017.https://rcdb.com/1870.htm See also *List of funicular railways References Further reading * Shale Tramways of Katoomba Luxton, John R.

These avatars can be textual, graphical representations, or live video avatars with auditory and touch sensations. In general, virtual worlds allow for multiple users but single player computer games, such as The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim, can also be considered a type of virtual world. The user accesses a computer-simulated world which presents perceptual stimuli to the user, who in turn can manipulate elements of the modeled world and thus experience a degree of presence. Such modeled worlds and their rules may draw from reality or fantasy worlds. Example rules are gravity, topography, locomotion, real-time actions, and communication. Communication between users can range from text, graphical icons, visual gesture, sound, and rarely, forms using touch, voice command, and balance senses. Massively multiplayer online games depict a wide range of worlds, including those based on science fiction, the real world, super heroes, sports, horror, and historical milieus. The most common form of such games are fantasy worlds, whereas those based on the real world are relatively rare. Most MMORPGs have real-time actions and communication. Players create a character who travels between buildings, towns, and worlds to carry out business or leisure activities. Communication is usually textual, but real- time voice communication is also possible. The form of communication used can substantially affect the experience of players in the game. Virtual worlds are not limited to games but, depending on the degree of immediacy presented, can encompass computer conferencing and text-based chatrooms. Sometimes, emoticons and emojis are available to show feeling or facial expression. Emoticons often have a keyboard shortcut. Edward Castronova is an economist who has argued that \\"synthetic worlds\\" is a better term for these cyberspaces, but this term has not been widely adopted. History The concept of virtual worlds significantly predates computers. The Roman naturalist, Pliny the Elder, expressed an interest in perceptual illusion.Pliny: A Virtual World In the twentieth century, the cinematographer Morton Heilig explored the creation of the Sensorama, a theatre experience designed to stimulate the senses of the audience‚Äîvision, sound, balance, smell, even touch (via wind)‚Äîand so draw them more effectively into the productions Among the earliest virtual worlds implemented by computers were virtual reality simulators, such as the work of Ivan Sutherland. Such devices are characterized by bulky headsets and other types of sensory input simulation. Contemporary virtual worlds, in particular the multi-user online environments, emerged mostly independently of this research, fueled instead by the gaming industry but drawing on similar inspiration. While classic sensory-imitating virtual reality relies on tricking the perceptual system into experiencing an immersive environment, virtual worlds typically rely on mentally and emotionally engaging content which gives rise to an immersive experience. Maze War was the first networked, 3D multi-user first person shooter game. Maze introduced the concept of online players in 1973‚Äì1974 as \\"eyeball 'avatars' chasing each other around in a maze.\\" It was played on ARPANET, or Advanced Research Projects Agency Network, a precursor to the Internet funded by the United States Department of Defense for use in university and research laboratories. The initial game could only be played on an Imlac, as it was specifically designed for this type of computer. The first virtual worlds presented on the Internet were communities and chat rooms, some of which evolved into MUDs and MUSHes. The first MUD, known as MUD1, was released in 1978. The acronym originally stood for Multi- User Dungeon, but later also came to mean Multi-User Dimension and Multi-User Domain. A MUD is a virtual world with many players interacting in real time.Mitchell, Don. ‚ÄúFrom MUDs To Virtual Worlds‚Äù, Microsoft Research, March 23, 1995. Accessed February 28, 2008. The early versions were text-based, offering only limited graphical representation and often using a Command Line Interface. Users interact in role-playing or competitive games by typing commands and can read or view descriptions of the world and other players. Such early worlds began the MUD heritage that eventually led to massively multiplayer online role-playing games, more commonly known as MMORPGs, a genre of role-playing games in which a large number of players interact within a virtual world. Some prototype virtual worlds were WorldsAway, a two- dimensional chat environment where users designed their own avatars; Dreamscape, an interactive community featuring a virtual world by CompuServe; Cityspace, an educational networking and 3D computer graphics project for children; and The Palace, a 2-dimensional community driven virtual world. However, credit for the first online virtual world usually goes to Habitat, developed in 1987 by LucasFilm Games for the Commodore 64 computer, and running on the Quantum Link service (the precursor to America Online). In 1996, the city of Helsinki, Finland with Helsinki Telephone Company (since Elisa Group) launched what was called the first online virtual 3D depiction intended to map an entire city. The Virtual Helsinki project was eventually renamed Helsinki Arena 2000 project and parts of the city in modern and historical context were rendered in 3D.\\"Helsinki Goes Virtual\\",The Infowin Newsclips Archive for 1997 In 1999, Whyville.net the first virtual world specifically for children was launched with a base in game-based learning and one of the earliest virtual currency-based economies. Shortly after, in 2000, Habbo launched and grew to become one of the most popular and longest running virtual worlds with millions of users around the world. Virtual world concepts Definitions for a \\"virtual world\\" include: * a \\"synchronous, persistent network of people, represented as avatars, facilitated by networked computers\\", by Mark W. Bell in 2008 * \\"an automated, shared, persistent environment with and through which people can interact in real time by means of a virtual self\\", by Richard Bartle in 2010 * \\"A persistent, simulated and immersive environment, facilitated by networked computers, providing multiple users with avatars and communication tools with which to act and interact in- world and in real-time.\\", by Carina Girvan in 2013 There is no generally accepted definition of virtual world, but they do require that the world be persistent; in other words, the world must continue to exist even after a user exits the world, and user-made changes to the world should be preserved. While the interaction with other participants is done in real-time, time consistency is not always maintained in online virtual worlds. For example, EverQuest time passes faster than real-time despite using the same calendar and time units to present game time. As virtual world is a general term, the virtual environment supports varying degrees of play and gaming. Some uses of the term include * Massively multiplayer online games (MMOGs) games in which a large number of players interact within a virtual world. The concept of MMO has spread to other game types such as sports, real-time strategy and others. The persistence criterion is the only criterion that separates virtual worlds from video games, meaning that some MMO versions of RTS and FPS games resemble virtual worlds; Destiny is a video game that is such a pseudo virtual world. Emerging concepts include basing the terrain of such games on real satellite photos, such as those available through the Google Maps API or through a simple virtual geocaching of \\"easter eggs\\" on WikiMapia or similar mash-ups, where permitted; these concepts are virtual worlds making use of mixed reality. * Collaborative virtual environments (CVEs) designed for collaborative work in a virtual environment. * Massively multiplayer online real-life games (MMORLGs), also called virtual social worlds,Kaplan, Andreas M.; Haenlein, Michael (2009). \\"The fairyland of Second Life: About virtual social worlds and how to use them\\". Business Horizons 52 (6) where the user can edit and alter their avatar at will, allowing them to play a more dynamic role, or multiple roles. Economy A virtual economy is the emergent property of the interaction between participants in a virtual world. While the designers have a great deal of control over the economy by the encoded mechanics of trade, it is nonetheless the actions of players that define the economic conditions of a virtual world. The economy arises as a result of the choices that players make under the scarcity of real and virtual resources such as time or currency. Participants have a limited time in the virtual world, as in the real world, which they must divide between task such as collecting resources, practicing trade skills, or engaging in less productive fun play. The choices they make in their interaction with the virtual world, along with the mechanics of trade and wealth acquisition, dictate the relative values of items in the economy. The economy in virtual worlds is typically driven by in-game needs such as equipment, food, or trade goods. Virtual economies like that of Second Life, however, are almost entirely player- produced with very little link to in-game needs. While the relevance of virtual world economics to physical world economics has been questioned, it has been shown the users of virtual worlds respond to economic stimuli (such as the law of supply and demand) in the same way that people do in the physical world.Castronova, Edward, et al. \\"A Test of the Law of Demand in a Virtual World: Exploring the Petri Dish.\\" Discoveries in Gaming and Computer- Mediated Simulations: New Interdisciplinary Applications (2011): 301. In fact, there are often very direct corollaries between physical world economic decisions and virtual world economic decisions, such as the decision by prisoners of war in World War II to adopt cigarettes as currency and the adoption of Stones of Jordan as currency in Diablo II. The value of objects in a virtual economy is usually linked to their usefulness and the difficulty of obtaining them. The investment of real world resources (time, membership fees, etc.) in acquisition of wealth in a virtual economy may contribute to the real world value of virtual objects. This real world value is made obvious by the (mostly illegal) trade of virtual items on online market sites like eBay, PlayerUp, IGE for real world money.\\"Securing Gaming Account Transactions\\", Securing Gaming Account Transactions Recent legal disputes also acknowledge the value of virtual property, even overriding the mandatory EULA which many software companies use to establish that virtual property has no value and/or that users of the virtual world have no legal claim to property therein.Sinrod, Eric J. ‚ÄúVirtual world litigation for real‚Äù, ‚ÄúCnet News‚Äù, June 13, 2007. Accessed March 6, 2008. Some industry analysts have moreover observed that there is a secondary industry growing behind the virtual worlds, made up by social networks, websites and other projects completely devoted to virtual worlds communities and gamers. Special websites such as GamerDNA, Koinup and others which serve as social networks for virtual worlds users are facing some crucial issues as the DataPortability of avatars across many virtual worlds and MMORPGs.Brady Forrest, \\"Wow and Cottage Industries\\", O'Really Radar, December 4, 2006 Virtual worlds offer advertisers the potential for virtual advertisements, such as the in-game advertising already found in a number of video games. Geography The geography of virtual worlds can vary widely because the role of geography and space is an important design component over which the developers of virtual worlds have control and may choose to alter. Virtual worlds are, at least superficially, digital instantiations of three-dimensional space. As a result, considerations of geography in virtual worlds (such as World of Warcraft) often revolve around ‚Äúspatial narratives‚Äù in which players act out a nomadic hero's journey along the lines of that present in The Odyssey. The creation of fantastic places is also a reoccurring theme in the geographic study of virtual worlds, although, perhaps counterintuitively, the heaviest users of virtual worlds often downgrade the sensory stimuli of the world's fantastic places in order to make themselves more efficient at core tasks in the world, such as killing monsters. However, the geographic component of some worlds may only be a geographic veneer atop an otherwise nonspatial core structure. For instance, while imposing geographic constraints upon users when they quest for items, these constraints may be removed when they sell items in a geographically unconstrained auction house. In this way, virtual worlds may provide a glimpse into what the future economic geography of the physical world may be like as more and more goods become digital. Research Virtual spaces can serve a variety of research and educational goals and may be useful for examining human behaviour. Offline- and virtual-world personalities differ from each other but are nevertheless significantly related which has a number of implications for self-verification, self-enhancement and other personality theories.Doodson, J. (2009)The relationship and differences between physical- and virtual-world personality . Conference paper presented at University of Exeter.Doodson, J. (2009).The relationship and differences between physical and virtual world-personality . Undergraduate dissertation. University of Bath. Panic and agoraphobia have also been studied in a virtual world. Given the large engagement, especially of young children in virtual worlds, there has been a steady growth in research studies involving the social, educational and even emotional impact of virtual worlds on children. The John D. and Catherine T. MacArthur Foundation for example have funded research into virtual worlds including, for example, how preteens explore and share information about reproductive health. A larger set of studies on children's social and political use of the virtual world Whyville.net has also been published in the book \\"Connected Play: Tweens in a Virtual World\\" Authored by Yasmin B. Kafai, Deborah A. Fields, and Mizuko Ito. Several other research publications now specifically address the use of virtual worlds for education. Other research focused more on adults explores the reasons for indulging and the emotions of virtual world users. Many users seek an escape or a comfort zone in entering these virtual worlds, as well as a sense of acceptance and freedom. Virtual worlds allow users to freely explore many facets of their personalities in ways that are not easily available to them in real life.Indalecio, Tina. Psychology Today. How Much Of An Individual‚Äôs Virtual Identity, Is Really - Real? Exploring Identity in the Virtual World - Is that REALLY you? 1991‚Äì2012. Sussex Publishers, LLC. 30 April 2010 However, users may not be able to apply this new information outside of the virtual world. Thus, virtual worlds allow for users to flourish within the world and possibly become addicted to their new virtual life which may create a challenge as far as dealing with others and in emotionally surviving within their real lives. One reason for this freedom of exploration can be attributed to the anonymity that virtual worlds provide. It gives the individual the ability to be free from social norms, family pressures or expectations they may face in their personal real world lives. The avatar persona experiences an experience similar to an escape from reality like drug or alcohol usage for numbing pain or hiding behind it. The avatar no longer represents a simple tool or mechanism manipulated in cyberspace. Instead, it has become the individual's bridge between the physical and virtual world, a conduit through which to express oneself among other social actors.McCreery, Michael Patrick. UNLV University Libraries. University of Nevada, Las Vegas. \\"Personality, Presence, And The Virtual Self: A Fivefactor Model Approach To Behavioral Analysis Within A Virtual Environment\\". 201. The avatar becomes the person's alter ego; the vehicle to which one utilizes to exist among others who are all seeking the same satisfaction. While greatly facilitating ease of interaction across time and geographic boundaries, the virtual world presents an unreal environment with instant connection and gratification. Online encounters are employed as seemingly fulfilling alternatives to ‚Äúlive person‚Äù relationships (Toronto, 2009). When one is ashamed, insecure, lost or just looking for something different and stimulating to engage in, virtual worlds are the perfect environment for its users. A person has unlimited access to an infinite array of opportunities to fulfill every fantasy, grant every wish, or satisfy every desire. He or she can face any fear or conquer any enemy, all at the click of a mouse (Toronto, 2009). Ultimately, virtual worlds are the place to go when real life becomes overbearing or boring. While in real life individuals hesitate to communicate their true opinions, it is easier to do so online because they don't ever have to meet the people they are talking with (Toronto, 2009). Thus, virtual worlds are basically a psychological escape. Another area of research related to virtual worlds is the field of navigation. Specifically, this research investigates whether or not virtual environments are adequate learning tools in regards to real-world navigation. Psychologists at Saint Michael's College found that video game experience corresponded with ability to navigate virtual environments and complete objectives; however, that experience did not correlate with an increased ability to navigate real, physical environments. An extensive study at the University of Washington conducted multiple experiments involving virtual navigation. One experiment had two groups of subjects, the first of which examined maps of a virtual environment, and the second of which navigated the virtual environment. The groups of subjects then completed an objective in the virtual environment. There was little difference between the two groups‚Äô performances, and what difference there was, it was in favor of the map-users. The test subjects, though, were generally unfamiliar with the virtual world interface, likely leading to some impaired navigation, and thus bias in the yielded analysis of the experiments. The study concluded that the interface objects made natural navigation movements impossible, and perhaps less intrusive controls for the virtual environment would reduce the effect of the impairment.Satalich, Glenna (1995). \\"Navigation and Wayfinding in Virtual Reality: Finding Proper Tools and Cues to Enhance Navigation Awareness \\". M.S. thesis. University of Washington, USA. Hardware Unlike most video games, which are usually navigated using various free-ranging human interface devices (HIDs), virtual worlds are usually navigated (as of 2009) using HIDs which are designed and oriented around flat, 2-dimensional graphical user interfaces; as most comparatively inexpensive computer mice are manufactured and distributed for 2-dimensional UI navigation, the lack of 3D-capable HID usage among most virtual world users is likely due to both the lack of penetration of 3D-capable devices into non-niche, non-gaming markets as well as the generally higher pricing of such devices compared to 2-dimensional HIDs. Even those users who do make use of HIDs which provide such features as six degrees of freedom often have to switch between separate 3D and 2D devices in order to navigate their respectively designed interfaces. Like video gamers, some users of virtual world clients may also have a difficult experience with the necessity of proper graphics hardware (such as the more advanced graphics processing units distributed by Nvidia and AMD) for the sake of reducing the frequency of less-than-fluid graphics instances in the navigation of virtual worlds. However, in part for this reason, a growing number of virtual world engines, especially serving children, are entirely browser-based requiring no software down loads or specialized computer hardware. The first virtual world of this kind was Whyville.net, launched in 1999, built by Numedeon inc. which obtained an early patent for its browser-based implementation. Application domains A film made in Second Life using machinima. Social Although the social interactions of participants in virtual worlds are often viewed in the context of 3D Games, other forms of interaction are common as well, including forums, blogs, wikis, chatrooms, instant messaging, and video- conferences. Communities are born in places which have their own rules, topics, jokes, and even language. Members of such communities can find like- minded people to interact with, whether this be through a shared passion, the wish to share information, or a desire to meet new people and experience new things. Users may develop personalities within the community adapted to the particular world they are interacting with, which can impact the way they think and act. Internet friendships and participation online communities tend to complement existing friendships and civic participation rather than replacing or diminishing such interactions.Schroeder, Ralph (1999). Social Life in Virtual Worlds: Structure and Interaction in Multi-User Virtual Reality Technology , Communications & Strategies, no. 33, 1st quarter, p. 137.] Medical Disabled or chronically invalided people of any age can benefit enormously from experiencing the mental and emotional freedom gained by temporarily leaving their disabilities behind and doing, through the medium of their avatars, things as simple and potentially accessible to able, healthy people as walking, running, dancing, sailing, fishing, swimming, surfing, flying, skiing, gardening, exploring and other physical activities which their illnesses or disabilities prevent them from doing in real life. They may also be able to socialize, form friendships and relationships much more easily and avoid the stigma and other obstacles which would normally be attached to their disabilities. This can be much more constructive, emotionally satisfying and mentally fulfilling than passive pastimes such as television watching, playing computer games, reading or more conventional types of internet use. The Starlight Children's Foundation helps hospitalized children (suffering from painful diseases or autism for example) to create a comfortable and safe environment which can expand their situation, experience interactions (when the involvement of a multiple cultures and players from around the world is factored in) they may not have been able to experience without a virtual world, healthy or sick. Virtual worlds also enable them to experience and act beyond the restrictions of their illness and help to relieve stress. Virtual worlds can help players become more familiar and comfortable with actions they may in real-life feel reluctant or embarrassed. For example, in World of Warcraft, /dance is the emote for a dance move which a player in the virtual world can \\"emote\\" quite simply. And a familiarization with said or similar \\"emotes\\" or social skills (such as, encouragement, gratitude, problem-solving, and even kissing) in the virtual world via avatar can make the assimilation to similar forms of expression, socialization, interaction in real life smooth. Interaction with humans through avatars in the virtual world has potential to seriously expand the mechanics of one's interaction with real-life interactions. Commercial As businesses compete in the real world, they also compete in virtual worlds. As there has been an increase in the buying and selling of products online (e-commerce) this twinned with the rise in the popularity of the internet, has forced businesses to adjust to accommodate the new market. Many companies and organizations now incorporate virtual worlds as a new form of advertising. There are many advantages to using these methods of commercialization. An example of this would be Apple creating an online store within Second Life. This allows the users to browse the latest and innovative products. Players cannot actually purchase a product but having these ‚Äúvirtual stores‚Äù is a way of accessing a different clientele and customer demographic. The use of advertising within \\"virtual worlds\\" is a relatively new idea. This is because Virtual Worlds is a relatively new technology. Before companies would use an advertising company to promote their products. With the introduction of the prospect of commercial success within a Virtual World, companies can reduce cost and time constraints by keeping this \\"in-house\\". An obvious advantage is that it will reduce any costs and restrictions that could come into play in the real world. Using virtual worlds gives companies the opportunity to gauge customer reaction and receive feedback. Feedback can be crucial to the development of a project as it will inform the creators exactly what users want. Using virtual worlds as a tool allows companies to test user reaction and give them feedback on products. This can be crucial as it will give the companies an insight as to what the market and customers want from new products, which can give them a competitive edge. Competitive edge is crucial in the ruthless world that is today's business. Another use of virtual worlds business is where players can create a gathering place. Many businesses can now be involved in business-to-business commercial activity and will create a specific area within a virtual world to carry out their business. Within this space all relevant information can be held. This can be useful for a variety of reasons. Players can conduct business with companies on the other side of the world, so there are no geographical limitations, it can increase company productivity. Knowing that there is an area where help is on hand can aid the employees. Sun Microsystems have created an island in Second Life dedicated for the sole use of their employees. This is a place where people can go and seek help, exchange new ideas or to advertise a new product. According to trade media company Virtual Worlds Management, commercial investments in the \\"virtual worlds\\" sector were in excess of US$425 million in Q4 2007, and totaled US$184 million in Q1 2008. However, the selection process for defining a \\"virtual worlds\\" company in this context has been challenged by one industry blog. =E-commerce (legal)= A number of virtual worlds have incorporated systems for sale of goods through virtual interfaces and using virtual currencies. Transfers of in-world credits typically are not bound by laws governing commerce. Such transactions may lack the oversight and protections associated with real-world commerce, and there is potential for fraudulent transactions. One example is that of Ginko Financial, a bank system featured in Second Life where avatars could deposit their real life currency after converted to Linden Dollars for a profit. In July 2007, residents of Second Life crowded around the ATM's in an unsuccessful attempt to withdraw their money. After a few days the ATM's along with the banks disappeared altogether. Around $700,000 in real world money was reported missing from residents in Second Life. An investigation was launched but nothing substantial ever came of finding and punishing the avatar known as Nicholas Portocarrero who was the head of Ginko Financial.Talbot, David. ‚ÄúThe Fleecing of the Avatars.‚Äù Technology Review 111.1 (Jan. 2008): 58-62. Civil and criminal laws exist in the real world and are put in place to govern people's behavior. Virtual Worlds such as Eve Online and Second Life also have people and systems that govern them.Haskins, Walaika (July 31, 2008), Who polices Virtual Worlds? Access date: February 2013. Providers of online virtual spaces have more than one approach to the governing of their environments. Second Life for instance was designed with the expectation being on the residents to establish their own community rules for appropriate behaviour. On the other hand, some virtual worlds such as Habbo enforce clear rules for behaviour, as seen in their terms and conditions.Habbo Hotel (blog), Habbo Hotel House Rules Access date: February 2013. In some instances virtual worlds don't need established rules of conduct because actions such as ‚Äòkilling‚Äô another avatar is impossible. However, if needed to, rule breakers can be punished with fines being payable through their virtual bank account, alternatively a players suspension may be put into effect. Instances of real world theft from a virtual world do exist, Eve Online had an incident where a bank controller stole around 200bn credits and exchanged them for real world cash amounting to ¬£3,115.BBC (July 3, 2009), Billions stolen in online robbery Access date: February 2013. The player in question has now been suspended as trading in- game cash for real money is against Eve Online's terms and conditions.Stockley, Mark (October 1, 2009), Who polices crime in a virtual world? Access date: February 2013. Entertainment There are many MMORPG virtual worlds out on many platforms. Most notable are IMVU for Windows, PlayStation Home for PlayStation 3, and Second Life for Windows. Many Virtual worlds have shut down since launch however. Notable shutdowns are The Sims Online, The Sims Bustin Out Online Weekend Mode, PlayStation Home, and Club Penguin. =Single-player games= Some single-player video games contain virtual worlds populated by non-player characters (NPC). Many of these allow players to save the current state of this world instance to allow stopping and restarting the virtual world at a later date. (This can be done with some multiplayer environments as well.) The virtual worlds found in video games are often split into discrete levels. Single-player games such as Minecraft allow players to optionally create their own world without other players, and then combine skills from the game to work together with other players and create bigger and more intricate environments. These environments can then be accessed by other players, if the server is available to other players then they may be able to modify parts of it, such as the structure of the environment. At one level, a more or less realistic rendered 3D space like the game world of Halo 3 or Grand Theft Auto V is just as much a big database as Microsoft's Encarta encyclopedia. Use in education Virtual worlds represent a powerful new medium for instruction and education that presents many opportunities but also some challenges. Persistence allows for continuing and growing social interactions, which themselves can serve as a basis for collaborative education. The use of virtual worlds can give teachers the opportunity to have a greater level of student participation. It allows users to be able to carry out tasks that could be difficult in the real world due to constraints and restrictions, such as cost, scheduling or location. Virtual worlds have the capability to adapt and grow to different user needs, for example, classroom teachers are able to use virtual worlds in their classroom leveraging their interactive whiteboard with the open-source project Edusim. They can be a good source of user feedback, the typical paper-based resources have limitations that Virtual Worlds can overcome. Multi-user virtual worlds with easy-to-use affordances for building are useful in project-based learning. For example, Active Worlds is used to support classroom teachers in Virginia Beach City Public Schools, the out-of-school NASA RealWorld-InWorld Engineering Design Challenge, and many after school and in school programs in EDUni-NY. Projects range from tightly scaffolded reflection spaces to open building based on student-centered designs. New York Museums AMNH and NYSci have used the medium to support STEM learning experiences for their program participants. Virtual worlds can also be used with virtual learning environments, as in the case of what is done in the Sloodle project, which aims to merge Second Life with Moodle. Virtual worlds allow users with specific needs and requirements to access and use the same learning materials from home as they would receive if they were physically present. Virtual worlds can help users stay up to date with relevant information and needs while also feeling as they are involved. Having the option to be able to attend a presentation via a virtual world from home or from their workplace, can help the user to be more at ease and comfortable. Although virtual worlds are used as an alternative method of communicating and interacting with students and teachers, a sense of isolation can occur such as losing certain body language cues and other more personal aspects that one would achieve if they were face to face. Some virtual worlds also offer an environment where simulation-based activities and games allow users to experiment various phenomenon and learn the underlying physics and principles. An example is Whyville launched in 1999, which targets kids and teenagers, offering them many opportunities to experiment, understand and learn. Topics covered in Whyville vary from physics to nutrition to ecology. Whyville also has a strong entrepreneurial structure based on user created virtual content sold in the internal virtual economy. Some multi-user virtual worlds have become used for educational purposes and are thus called Multi-User Virtual Learning Environments (MUVLEs). Examples have included the use of Second Life for teaching English as a foreign languages (EFL)Par Janusz Arabski, Adam Wojtaszek (2011). The Acquisition of L2 Phonology. Multilingual Matters. Many specialist types of MUVLE have particular pedagogies associated with them. For instance, George Siemens, Stephen Downes continue to promote the use of a type of MUVLE Dave Cormier coined called a 'MOOC'. Even though MOOCs were once seen as \\"next big thing\\" by universities and online education service providers such as Blackboard Inc, this was in fact what has been called a \\"stampede.\\"Laura Pappano. The Year of the MOOC - The New York Times. November 2, 2012 By early 2013, serious questions emerged about whether MOOCs were simply part of a hype cycle and indeed following that hype whether academia was thus \\"MOOC'd out.\\" Language  Language learning is the most widespread type of education in virtual worlds.  Business  Online training overcomes constraints such as distance, infrastructure, accommodation costs and tight scheduling. Although video conferencing may be the most common tool, virtual worlds have been adopted by the business environment for training employees. For example, Second Life has been used in business schools. Virtual training content resembles traditional tutorials and testing of user knowledge. Despite the lack of face to face contact and impaired social linking, learning efficiency may not be adversely affected as adults need autonomy in learning and are more self-directed than younger students. Some companies and public places allow free virtual access to their facilities as an alternative to a video or picture. In fiction Virtual worlds, virtual reality, and cyberspace are popular fictional motifs. The first was probably John M. Ford's 1980 novel Web of Angels, and a prominent early example is the work of William Gibson. Virtual worlds are integral to works such as Tron, Neuromancer, Ghost in the Shell, Snow Crash, The Lawnmower Man, Lawnmower Man 2, ReBoot, Digimon, The Matrix, MegaMan NT Warrior, Epic, Code Lyoko and Real Drive. In A.K. Dewdney's novel, the Planiverse (1984), college students create a virtual world called 2DWorld, leading to contact with Arde, a two-dimensional parallel universe. The main focus of the Japanese cyberpunk, psychological, 13-episode anime titled Serial Experiments Lain (1998) is the Wired, a virtual reality world that governs the sum of all electronic communication and machines; outer receptors are used to mentally transport a person into the Wired itself as a uniquely different virtual avatar. Yasutaka Tsutsui's novel, Gaspard in the Morning (1992), is the story of an individual immersed in the virtual world of a massively multiplayer online game.Tsutsui Yasutaka, The Encyclopedia of Science Fiction The plots of isekai works such as Moon: Remix RPG Adventure (1997), Digimon Adventure (1999), .hack (2002), Sword Art Online (2002), Summer Wars (2009), Accel World (2009), Ready Player One (2011) and Jumani (2017) also involve the virtual worlds of video games. The fourth series of the New Zealand TV series The Tribe features the birth of Reality Space and the Virtual World that was created by Ram, the computer genius-wizard leader of The Technos. In 2009, BBC Radio 7 commissioned Planet B, set in a virtual world in which a man searches for his girlfriend, believed to be dead, but in fact still alive within the world called \\"Planet B\\". The series is the biggest-ever commission for an original drama series. The plot of \\"San Junipero\\", series 3, episode 4 of the anthology TV series Black Mirror, revolves around a virtual world in which participants can choose time periods to visit. Living people may visit only 5 hours per week; while the dying can choose to permanently preserve their consciousness there. Future Virtual worlds may lead to a \\"mobility\\" of labor that may impact national and organizational competitiveness in a manner similar to the changes seen with the mobility of goods and then the mobility of labor. Virtual worlds may increasingly function as centers of commerce, trade, and business.Book, Betsy (March, 2006), Virtual Worlds: today and in the future Access date: February 2013.

The Jamison Valley forms part of the Coxs River canyon system in the Blue Mountains of New South Wales, Australia. It is situated approximately 100 kilometres west of Sydney, capital of New South Wales, and a few kilometres south of Katoomba, the main town in the Blue Mountains. History Indigenous history The traditional inhabitants of the land in what is now known as the Jamison Valley are the Aboriginal Gundungurra people who are estimated to have lived in the region for years, stretching south towards the Burragorang Valley, north of Goulburn. European history The Jamison Valley was named by Governor Lachlan Macquarie in honour of Sir John Jamison (1776-1844), a prominent landowner and physician who visited the Blue Mountains with the governor in 1815. Later, as local towns were beginning to develop, the British naturalist Charles Darwin toured the area. He stayed at the Weatherboard Inn in Wentworth Falls in 1836, and undertook a walk along Jamison Creek to the escarpment of the Jamison Valley, where he was impressed by the views. His route is now commemorated as Darwin's Walk, starting in Wilson Park, Wentworth Falls, and following Jamison Creek to the escarpment.Sydney and Blue Mountains Bushwalks, Neil Paton (Kangaroo Press) 2004, p.207 Coal mining in the valley was started around 1872 by John Britty North, with large-scale infrastructure (Katoomba Scenic Railway) used to overcome the terrain. Geology The Ruined Castle, a popular destination for bushwalkers A view of Mount Solitary from the floor of the Jamison Valley The Jamison Valley stretches north-south from just outside Katoomba to the Mount Solitary ridge; in this direction it is approximately long. From west to east, it stretches from Narrow Neck Plateau to Kings Tableland, making it approximately wide.Blue Mountains Tourist Map, Eighth Edition 1988, New South Wales Government Like the entire Sydney and Blue Mountains region, the valley is a sandstone area, characterised by steep sandstone cliffs. Deeper into the soil there is a layer of shale, which is softer than the sandstone. As this layer of shale was eroded by the watercourses, it collapsed and brought the sandstone down with it, creating the characteristic sandstone valleys and canyons of the Blue Mountains, of which the Jamison Valley is one. The only mountain in the valley is Mount Solitary, which sprawls across the south of the valley from west to east. It is joined to Narrow Neck Plateau by a low ridge which is also the site of the Ruined Castle, a rock formation that is popular with bushwalkers. Immediately east of Mount Solitary is a property called Kedumba Farm, which is no longer worked as a farm. South of Mount Solitary, the valley sprawls through Cedar and Kedumba Valley down to Coxs River and Lake Burragorang, the lake that was created when Warragamba Dam was built. There is a prohibited area around the river and lake to protect Sydney's water supply. Around this area there is a high-tension power line that crosses the valley from east to west; it is followed by a series of service roads that provide access to the powerline and to the area, although much of it is in the prohibited area. These service roads make it possible to do a trek taking in the whole valley, but it is necessary to get permission from Sydney Water to go through the prohibited area. The Katoomba and Jamison topographic maps are essential for any of these walks.Jamison Topographic Map, 8930-2N, Land and Property Information, New South WalesBlue Mountains Tourist Map, 1988 The northern escarpment is deeply serrated, having been carved up by watercourses over millions of years. Watercourses include Jamison Creek, Valley of the Waters Creek, Gordons Creek, Leura Falls Creek, Kedumba River and Causeway Creek. There are also numerous waterfalls, including Wentworth Falls, Empress Falls, Vera Falls, Gordon Falls, Leura Falls and Katoomba Falls.Katoomba Topographic Map, 8930-1-S, Land and Property Information, New South Wales The valley is densely forested, with eucalypt forest over most of its expanse and occasional pockets of semi- rainforest in gullies, where water is concentrated. Activities View of the Jamison Valley from near Wentworth Falls Narrow Neck peninsula The Jamison Valley is commonly visited by bushwalkers and campers. There is a network of tracks across the northern escarpment, including Darwin's Walk, the tracks in the Valley of the Waters and old, neglected tracks that Blue Mountains bushwalkers have been trying to restore for years.How To See the Blue mountains, Jim Smith (Second Back Row Press) 1986, pp.52-55 Tracks are also found along the cliffs near Leura and Katoomba, as well as tracks like the Federal Pass, located at the foot of the cliffs. A track also goes west around to the Ruined Castle and Mount Solitary. The track continues across the mountain but is patchy and suitable only for experienced walkers.Sydney and Blue Mountains Bushwalks, pp.225-228 It is possible to then go up to Kings Tableland and into Wentworth Falls, making a trek of at least three days. The tracks closer to the escarpment are suitable for one-day walks. Mount Solitary is used mostly for camping trips, although some walkers have been known to make one-day walks to the mountain.In this part of the valley there was formerly a sewage treatment plant, not far below the northern escarpment. It was serviced by a dirt road that went up to Kings Tableland and thence to Wentworth Falls town. The plant was closed down in the 1990s, but the service road remains and can be used by bushwalkers. Attractions Attractions include Scenic World, a tourist complex north of the valley. And as well as the steepest funicular railway in the world, the Katoomba Scenic Railway, which was originally built to facilitate coal and oil shale mining in the Jamison Valley. Scenic World also offers the Scenic Skyway cable car, which travels over an arm of the Jamison Valley and offers views of Katoomba Falls and Orphan Rock. The Three Sisters, which are on the northern escarpment of the valley, are one of Australia's most-photographed landmarks.AUSTRALIA‚ÄôS MOST PHOTOGRAPHED LANDMARKS PictureStore The Giant Stairway walking track runs down a cliff into the Jamison Valley, near the Three Sisters, providing access to nature walks through the valley.

The VTA is the origin of the dopaminergic cell bodies of the mesocorticolimbic dopamine system and other dopamine pathways; it is widely implicated in the drug and natural reward circuitry of the brain. The VTA plays an important role in a number of processes, including reward cognition (motivational salience, associative learning, and positively-valenced emotions) and orgasm, among others, as well as several psychiatric disorders. Neurons in the VTA project to numerous areas of the brain, ranging from the prefrontal cortex to the caudal brainstem and several regions in between.  Structure  Anatomical location of VTA in humans Neurobiologists have often had great difficulty distinguishing the VTA in humans and other primate brains from the substantia nigra (SN) and surrounding nuclei. Originally, the ventral tegmental area was designated as a ‚Äònucleus‚Äô, but over time ‚Äòarea‚Äô became the more appropriate term used because of the heterogeneous cytoarchitectonic features of the region and the lack of clear borders that separate it from adjacent regions. Because of the selective limbic-related afferents to the VTA, the cells of the VTA are given the designation A10 to differentiate them from surrounding cells. Location The ventral tegmental area is in the midbrain between several other major areas, some of which are described here. The mammillary bodies and the posterior hypothalamus, both included in the diencephalon, extend rostrally from the VTA. The red nucleus is situated laterally and oculomotor fibers are situated ventromedially to the VTA. The pons and the hindbrain lie caudally to the VTA. Finally, the substantia nigra is located laterally to the VTA.  Subdivisions  In 1987, Oades identified four primary nuclei in the VTA A10 group of cells: the nucleus paranigralis (Npn), the nucleus parabrachialis pigmentosus (Npbp), the nucleus interfascicularis (Nif), and the nucleus linearis (Nln) caudalis and rostralis. Presently, scientists divide the VTA up into four similar zones that are called the paranigral nucleus (PN), the parabrachial pigmented area (PBP), the parafasciculus retroflexus area (PFR), and the rostromedial tegmental nucleus (RMTg), which approximately adhere to the previous divisions. Some definitions of the VTA also include the midline nuclei (i.e. the interfascicular nucleus, rostral linear nucleus, and central linear nucleus). The PN and PBP are rich in dopaminergic cells, whereas the other two regions have low densities of these neurons. The PFR and RMTg contain a low density of tyrosine hydroxylase (TH)-positive cell bodies that are small in size and lightly stain; the RMTg is composed mostly of GABAergic cells. On the other hand, the PN and PBP consist mainly of medium to large sized TH-positive cell bodies that stain moderately.  Inputs  Almost all areas receiving projections from the VTA project back to it. Thus, the ventral tegmental area is reciprocally connected with a wide range of structures throughout the brain suggesting that it has a role in the control of function in the phylogenetically newer and highly developed neocortex, as well as that of the phylogenetically older limbic areas. The VTA is a heterogeneous region consisting of a variety of neurons that are characterized by different neurochemical and neurophysiological properties. Therefore, glutamatergic and GABAergic inputs are not exclusively inhibitory nor exclusively excitatory. The VTA receives glutamatergic afferents from the prefrontal cortex, pedunculopontine tegmental nucleus (PPTg), laterodorsal tegmental nucleus, subthalamic nucleus, bed nucleus of the stria terminalis, superior colliculus, periaqueductal gray, lateral habenula, dorsal raphe nucleus, and lateral hypothalamic and preoptic areas. These glutamatergic afferents play a key role in regulating VTA cell firing. When the glutamatergic neurons are activated, the firing rates of the dopamine neurons increase in the VTA and induce burst firing. Studies have shown that these glutamatergic actions in the VTA are critical to the effects of drugs of abuse. In contrast, the tail of the ventral tegmental area (tVTA, the RMTg) projects to the VTA with GABAergic afferents, functioning as a \\"master brake\\" for the VTA dopamine pathways. GABAergic inputs to the VTA also include the nucleus accumbens, ventral pallidum, dorsal raphe nucleus, lateral hypothalamus, periaqueductal gray, bed nucleus of the stria terminalis, and rostromedial tegmental nucleus (RMTg). The lateral habenula can also exert an inhibitory effect on dopaminergic neurons in the VTA by exciting RMTg GABAergic neurons, which is thought to play an important role in reward prediction errors. Subpallidal afferents into the VTA are mainly GABAergic and, thus, inhibitory. There is a substantial pathway from the subpallidal area to the VTA. When this pathway is disinhibited, an increase in the dopamine release in the mesolimbic pathway amplifies locomotor activity. There are also cholinergic inputs to the VTA, although less studied than the glutamatergic and GABAergic inputs. Optogenetic studies in mice looking at cholinergic inputs from the pedunculopontine tegmental nucleus (PPTg) and the laterodorsal tegmental nucleus demonstrate that these circuits reinforce the discharge properties of VTA neurons, suggesting a modulatory influence on reward circuits.  Outputs  The two primary efferent fiber projections of the VTA are the mesocortical and the mesolimbic pathways, which correspond to the prefrontal cortex and nucleus accumbens respectively. In addition, experiments in rodents have identified a mesohabenular pathway consisting of VTA neurons that do not release dopamine, but glutamate and GABA. Other VTA projections, which utilize dopamine as their primary neurotransmitter, are listed below. * Ventral tegmental area (VTA) projections :* VTA ‚Üí Amygdala :*VTA ‚Üí Entorhinal cortex :* VTA ‚Üí Cingulate gyrus :* VTA ‚Üí Hippocampus :* VTA ‚Üí Nucleus accumbens :* VTA ‚Üí Olfactory bulb :* VTA ‚Üí Prefrontal cortex  Development  Because they develop from common embryonic tissue and partly overlap in their projection fields, Dopaminergic cell groups lack clear anatomical boundaries. During the development of the mammalian brain, both substantia nigra (SN) and VTA neurons initially project to the dorsolateral and ventromedial striatum. However, at birth the SN dopaminergic neurons project exclusively into the dorsolateral striatum, and the VTA dopaminergic neurons project solely into the ventromedial striatum. This pruning of connections occurs through the elimination of the unnecessary collaterals.  Function  As stated above, the VTA, in particular the VTA dopamine neurons, serve several functions in the reward system, motivation, cognition, and drug addiction, and may be the focus of several psychiatric disorders. It has also been shown to process various types of emotion output from the amygdala, where it may also play a role in avoidance and fear-conditioning. Electrophysiological recordings have demonstrated that VTA neurons respond to novel stimuli, unexpected rewards, and reward-predictive sensory cues. The firing pattern of these cells is consistent with the encoding of a reward expectancy error. In 2006, MRI studies by Helen Fisher and her research team found and documented various emotional states relating to intense love correlated with activity in the VTA, which may help explain obsessive behaviors of rejected partners, since this is shared by the reward system. Nest sharing behavior is associated with increased V1aR expression in the VTA of newly paired zebra finches. However, V1aR expression was not related to female directed song rates, which may indicate a selective role of vasotocin in the VTA on pair maintenance versus courtship behavior.  Presence of gap junctions  The VTA has been shown to have a large network of GABAergic neurons that are interconnected via gap junctions. This network allows for electrical conduction, which is considerably faster than the chemical conduction of signals between synapses, though less spatially precise.  Neural composition  The VTA, like the substantia nigra, is populated with melanin-pigmented dopaminergic neurons. Recent studies have suggested that dopaminergic neurons comprise 50-60% of all neurons in the VTA, which is contrary to previous evidence that noted 77% of neurons within the VTA to be dopaminergic. In addition, there is a sizable population of GABAergic neurons in the rostromedial tegmental nucleus (RMTg), a functionally distinct brain structure. These GABAergic neurons regulate the firing of their dopaminergic counterparts that send projections throughout the brain to, but not limited to, the following regions: the prefrontal cortex, the nucleus accumbens, and the locus coeruleus. The VTA also contains a small percentage of excitatory glutamatergic neurons.  Limbic loop  The ‚Äúlimbic loop‚Äù is very similar to the direct pathway motor loop of the basal ganglia. In both systems, there are major excitatory inputs from the cortex to the striatum (accumbens nucleus), the midbrain project neuromodulatory dopamine neurons to the striatum, the striatum makes internuclear connections to the pallidum, and the pallidum has outputs to the thalamus, which projects to the cortex, thus completing the loop. The limbic loop is distinguished from the motor loop by the source and nature of the cortical input, the division of the striatum and pallidum that process the input, the source of the dopaminergic neurons from the midbrain, and the thalamic target of the pallidal output. The limbic loop controls cognitive and affective functioning, since the motor loop controls movement.  CA3 loop  Linking context to reward is important for reward seeking. In 2011, a group of researchers documented a VTA-CA3 loop that uses the lateral septum as an intermediary. They used a pseudo-rabies virus (PRV) as a transsynaptic tracer, and injected it into the VTA. They found that unilateral injection into the VTA resulted in bilateral PRV labeling in CA3 beginning 48 hours after injection. Lesions of the caudodorsal lateral septum (cd-LS) before VTA PRV injection resulted in significantly less PRV labeled neurons in CA3. Theta wave stimulation of CA3 resulted in increased firing rates for dopamine cells in the VTA, and decreased firing rates for GABA neurons in the VTA. The identity of VTA neurons was confirmed by neurobiotin‚Ñ¢ labeling of the recording neuron, and then histological staining for tyrosine hydroxylase (TH). Temporary inactivation of CA3 via GABA agonists prevented context induced reinstatement of lever pressing for intravenous cocaine. The authors propose a functional circuit loop where activation of glutamatergic cells in CA3 causes activation of GABAergic cells in cd-LS, which inhibits GABA interneurons in the VTA, releasing the dopamine cells from the tonic inhibition, and leading to an increased firing rate for the dopamine cells.  Reward system  The dopamine reward circuitry in the human brain involves two projection systems from the ventral midbrain to the nucleus accumbens-olfactory tubercle complex. First, the posteromedial VTA and central linear raphe cells selectively project to the ventromedial striatum, which includes the medial olfactory tubercle and the medial NAC shell. Second, the lateral VTA projects largely to the ventrolateral striatum, which includes the NAC core, the medial NAC shell, and the lateral olfactory tubercle. These pathways are called the meso- ventromedial and the meso-ventrolateral striatal dopamine systems, respectively. The medial projection system is important in the regulation of arousal characterized by affect and drive and plays a different role in goal- directed behavior than the lateral projection system. Unlike the lateral part, the medial one is activated not by rewarding but by noxious stimuli. Therefore, the NAC shell and the posterior VTA are the primary areas involved in the reward system.  Clinical significance  Disorders  The dopaminergic neurons of the substantia nigra and the ventral tegmental area of the midbrain project to the dorsolateral caudate/putamen and to the ventromedially located nucleus accumbens, respectively, establishing the mesostriatal and the mesolimbic pathways. The close proximity of these two pathways causes them to be grouped together under dopaminergic projections. Several disorders result from the disruption of these two pathways: schizophrenia, Parkinson's disease, and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). Current research is examining the subtle difference between the neurons that are involved in these conditions and trying to find a way to selectively treat a specific dopamine projection.  Drug addiction  The nucleus accumbens and the ventral tegmental area are the primary sites where addictive drugs act. The following are commonly considered to be addictive: cocaine, alcohol, opioids, nicotine, cannabinoids, amphetamine, and their analogs. These drugs alter the neuromodulatory influence of dopamine on the processing of reinforcement signals by prolonging the action of dopamine in the nucleus accumbens or by stimulating the activation of neurons there and also in the VTA. The most common drugs of abuse stimulate the release of dopamine, which creates both their rewarding and the psychomotor effects. Compulsive drug-taking behaviors are a result of the permanent functional changes in the mesolimbic dopamine system arising from repetitive dopamine stimulation. Molecular and cellular adaptations are responsible for a sensitized dopamine activity in the VTA and along the mesolimbic dopamine projection in response to drug abuse. In the VTA of addicted individuals, the activity of the dopamine-synthesizing enzyme tyrosine hydroxylase increases, as does the ability of these neurons to respond to excitatory inputs. The latter effect is secondary to increases in the activity of the transcription factor CREB and the up regulation of GluR1, an important subunit of AMPA receptors for glutamate. These alterations in neural processing could account for the waning influence of adaptive emotional signals in the operation of decision making faculties as drug-seeking and drug-taking behaviors become habitual and compulsive. Experiments in rats have shown that they learn to press a lever for the administration of stimulant drugs into the posterior VTA more readily than into the anterior VTA. Other studies have shown that microinjections of dopaminergic drugs into the nucleus accumbens shell increase locomotor activity and exploratory behaviors, conditioned approach responses, and anticipatory sexual behaviors. The withdrawal phenomenon occurs because the deficit in reward functioning initiates a distress cycle wherein the drugs become necessary to restore the normal homeostatic state. Recent research has shown that even after the final stages of withdrawal have been passed, drug-seeking behavior can be restored if exposed to the drug or drug- related stimuli. Comparative anatomy and evolution All studies since 1964 have emphasized the impressive general similarity between the VTA of all mammals from rodents to humans. These studies have focused their efforts on rats, rabbits, dogs, cats, opossum, non-human primates, and humans. There have been slight differences noted, such as changes in the dorsal extent of the A10 cells. To be specific, the dorsal peak of A10 cells is more extensive in primates when compared to other mammals. Furthermore, the number of dopaminergic cells in the VTA increases with phylogenetic progression; for instance, the VTA of the mouse contains approximately 25,000 neurons, while the VTA of a 33-year-old man contains around 450,000 cell bodies.

Kaminski et al. wrote in Science that these claims were justified: Rico retrieved an average of 37 out of 40 items correctly. Rico could also remember items' names for four weeks after his last exposure. Testing and results Kaminski et al. eliminated the Clever Hans effect using a strict protocol: each of the 200 items whose names Rico knew was randomly assigned to one of 20 sets of 10 items. While the owner waited with the dog in a separate room, the experimenter arranged a set of items in the experimental room and then joined the owner and the dog. Next, the experimenter instructed the owner to request that the dog bring two randomly chosen items (one after the other) from the adjacent room. Rico's vocabulary was thus broadly comparable to that of language-trained apes, dolphins, sea lions, and parrots. Rico also responded correctly to a new word with a single exposure, apparently using a canine equivalent of the fast mapping mechanism used by humans. Subject to the anti- Clever Hansing protocols above, a new object was placed alongside seven familiar objects. Rico was told to retrieve the new object, using a word that he had never heard before. Not only could Rico correctly retrieve the object, he also responded correctly to the name of the new object, presumably using a process of elimination. Implications Nature columnist Paul Bloom of Yale University, a scientist specializing in children's acquisition of semantics and language, commented on the study, saying that \\"for psychologists, dogs may be the new chimpanzees.\\" He also had reservations, pointing out that children learn new words in many ways, while Rico learns only through rewards for successfully fetching an object. \\"If any child learned words the way Rico did, the parents would run screaming to the nearest neurologist.\\" Border Collies are bred to respond in clever ways to a combination of human vocal commands and whistles, which makes them excellent sheep dogs. Whether Rico's clever responses equate to any kind of language comprehension or even whether they demonstrate any language skill (apart from distinguishing the difference among sounds) is at best unclear. There are several open questions regarding Rico's abilities that could serve to further illuminate the nature of canine intelligence: * Can Rico demonstrate understanding of a word other than by fetching an object? * Could Rico be told not to fetch a specific object (akin to telling a human child \\"don't touch!\\")? * Can Rico learn a word for any object that is not small and fetchable? * Can the same results be produced with nonlinguistic sounds? According to Julia Fischer, > \\"[Rico's ability] tells us he can do simple logic . . . It's like he's > saying to himself, 'I know the others have names, so this new word cannot > refer to my familiar toys. It must refer to this new thing.'

It was formed in 1998 by five former members of the New Zealand First party. It has often been described as a MƒÅori party. Officially, Mauri Pacific was a multiculturalist party, welcoming anyone who supported racial and cultural harmony. Three of its five MPs were MƒÅori, and two were PƒÅkehƒÅ. The party only contested one election and failed to retain any of its five seats in Parliament. The party disbanded shortly afterwards. Origins Mauri Pacific had its origins in New Zealand First, a populist party led by former National Party minister Winston Peters. After the 1996 election, New Zealand First won 17 seats, including a sweep of all five MƒÅori seats. It held the balance of power in Parliament and eventually went into coalition with the incumbent conservative National Party with Peters as deputy prime minister. Gradually, however, the relationship between New Zealand First and the National Party deteriorated. In August 1998, Peters was sacked from Cabinet, and he pulled New Zealand First out of the coalition. Many New Zealand First MPs were not willing to follow their party back into Opposition, however. Eight of the party's sixteen MPs defected, establishing themselves as independents. These MPs supported the National Party government, enabling it to keep a slim majority in Parliament. Sometime later, five of the newly independent MPs gathered together to establish Mauri Pacific. They were led by Tau Henare, Minister of MƒÅori Affairs and former deputy leader of New Zealand First. The other MPs were Tuku Morgan, Rana Waitai, Jack Elder, and Ann Batten. Henare, Morgan, and Waitai were previously members of the so-called \\"tight five\\", New Zealand First's group of MƒÅori MPs. (The other two members of the \\"tight five,\\" Tu Wyllie and Tuariki Delamere, were not involved with Mauri Pacific - Wyllie had remained with New Zealand First, and Delamere eventually joined the small Te Tawharau party.) Because its three highest- profile MPs were MƒÅori, Mauri Pacific was considered by many to be a MƒÅori party. Its policies were generally favourable towards MƒÅori, such as its proposal to give customary MƒÅori law equal status to modern Western law, but the party portrayed this as multiculturalism rather than mere MƒÅori advocacy. The party made a particular attempt to gather support from Pacific Islanders, although was not particularly successful. Fate Mauri Pacific was not well received by the general public. The behaviour of its members (particularly Tuku Morgan) had been criticised even before the splintering of New Zealand First, and the perception that these MPs had \\"betrayed\\" their former party was strong. Many voters believed that Mauri Pacific had been born out of political opportunism, not out of firmly-held principle. It later came out that Henare had challenged Peters for leadership of New Zealand First prior to the split. In addition, the party's policies were criticised as vague and unspecific. In June, Independent and former New Zealand First MP Tuariki Delamere asked his supporters to give their party vote to Mauri Pacific.http://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/news/article.cfm?c_id=1&objectid;=11081 In November 1999 one of Mauri Pacific's candidates resigned to join the United New Zealand party, citing Mauri Pacific's lack of commitment to Asian voters.http://www.scoop.co.nz/stories/PA9911/S00378/mauri-pacific-candidate- resigns-to-join-united.htm In the 1999 elections, Mauri Pacific stood candidates in twenty electorates. It also put forward a party list of twenty- two people. However, the party gained only 4,008 list votes (0.19% of the total), putting it in thirteenth place. None of Mauri Pacific's sitting MPs were re-elected or even won second place. Shortly after the election, Mauri Pacific disbanded, and the party was deregistered at its own request by the Electoral Commission. Party list The party's party list at the 1999 election was: Tau Henare, Tuku Morgan, Peta Si'ulepa, Rana Waitai, Ann Batten, Te Orohi Paul, Atawhai Tibble, Amokura Huia Panoho, Rovina Anderson, Eric Chuah, Danny Turia, Rajesh Masters, Martin Kaipo, Helen Akhtari, Trieste Te Awe Awe, Sharon Faloon, Rayna Waitai, Fa'amatuainu Iakopo, Laura Mason, Richard Waitai, Kelly Waitai and Api Malu.

It is a dark satire on the rampant corruption in Indian politics, bureaucracy, news media and business, and stars an ensemble cast including Naseeruddin Shah, Ravi Baswani, Om Puri, Pankaj Kapur, Satish Shah, Satish Kaushik, Bhakti Barve and Neena Gupta. Antonioni's film Blowup of 1966 inspired director Kundan Shah, in which two photographers inadvertently capture the murder of a Bombay Municipal Commissioner with their cameras and later discover this when the images are enlarged. The park in which the murder occurs is named \\"Antonioni Park\\". Kundan Shah won the 1984 Indira Gandhi Award for Best Debut Film of a Director for his work. The film was part of the NFDC Retrospective at India International Film Festival in 2006.Jaane Bhi Do Yaaron (Who Pays the Piper) India International Film Festival Official website. Plot Professional photographers Vinod Chopra (Naseeruddin Shah) and Sudhir Mishra (Ravi Baswani) open a photo studio in the prestigious Haji Ali area in Bombay, and hope to make enough money to keep it running. After a disastrous start, they are given some work by the editor of \\"Khabardar\\", a publication that exposes the scandalous lives of the rich and the famous. They accept it and start working with the editor, Shobha Sen (Bhakti Barve), on a story exposing the dealings between an unscrupulous builder, Tarneja (Pankaj Kapoor), and corrupt Municipal Commissioner D'Mello (Satish Shah). During their investigation, they find out that another builder Ahuja (Om Puri) who is Tarneja's business rival is also involved in this dealing to get a contract for building 4 flyovers from D'Mello. While working on their story, Sudhir and Vinod decide to enter a photography contest that carries prize money of Rs. 5000/-, and take a number of photographs all over the city. On developing their pictures, in one of the photographs, they see a man shooting someone and realize that the killer is none other than Tarneja. They immediately return to the scene and find the body lying behind the bushes. Before the duo gets to the body, it disappears, but they manage to retrieve one of a pair of gold cufflinks. Sometime later, they attend the inauguration of a bridge dedicated to the memory of late Municipal Commissioner D'Mello who is supposed to have died of a terminal disease. There they discover the other cuff link. They return at night and dig up the area and unearth a coffin containing the dead body of D'Mello. The Mahabharata scene is considered to be one of the major highlights of the film, and has been praised for its humour. They take several photographs of the corpse, and wheel it with them with the hopes of exposing Tarneja. However, the body disappears and they lie to Shobha saying that the body is hidden safely with them. Shobha, in turn, starts blackmailing Tarneja. He invites her, Vinod and Sudhir for dinner and plants a time bomb to kill them. Unfortunately, the bomb explodes prematurely and the trio escapes. Vinod and Sudhir find out that the body is with Tarneja's rival, Ahuja who had, in an inebriated condition, carried the coffin to his farmhouse. They steal the corpse but not before Tarneja, Ahuja, the new Municipal Commissioner Srivastav, Shobha and others also get involved resulting in a series of comic mix-ups. The climax is set upon a stage dramatization of the Mahabharata, particularly the enactment of the Draupadi Cheer-Haran episode, which is turned on its head with the duo and the group following them inserting themselves into the scene. The iconic sequence also includes a scene from the ill-fated romance of Salim and Anarkali with the corpse playing Anarkali. In the end, the police arrive and Vinod and Sudhir present their evidence to the police officer. Srivastava, being the Assistant Municipal Commissioner, tells the officer to wait a few minutes before arresting Tarneja. Tarneja tells Ahuja and Shobha that if he goes to jail, he would make sure that their malpractices are also exposed. In a twist ending, they all come to an agreement and Srivastava manages to pin the murder of Commissioner D'Mello and the collapse of the bridge on Vinod and Sudhir. In the final scene, Vinod and Sudhir are shown several months/years later released from prison, still in their prison clothes. They turn to the camera and make a symbolic cut-throat gesture, signifying the death of justice and truth.

The midbrain tegmentum extends from the substantia nigra to the cerebral aqueduct in a horizontal section of the midbrain. It forms the floor of the midbrain that surrounds below the cerebral aqueduct as well as the floor of the fourth ventricle while the midbrain tectum forms the roof of the fourth ventricle. The tegmentum contains a collection of tracts and nuclei with movement-related, species-specific, and pain-perception functions. The general structures of midbrain tegmentum include red nucleus and the periaqueductal grey matter. Nigrostriatal Pathway and Mesolimbic Pathway in the Dopaminergic System Unlike the midbrain tectum (which is a sensory structure located posteriorly), the midbrain tegmentum, which locates anteriorly, is related to a number of motor functions. Within the tegmentum, the red nucleus is in charge of motor coordination (specifically for limb movements) and the periaqueductal gray matter (PAG) contains critical circuits for modulating behavioral responses to pains. The substantia nigra (black substance) serves an important role in rewarding behaviors such as approaching desired objects. In addition, the substantia nigra forms reciprocal connections with the basal ganglia which are highly correlated with motor functions and learning. The midbrain tegmentum is also an important part of the dopaminergic system which is essential for feelings of reward and pleasure. Two regions in the midbrain tegmentum are of particular interest. The first one is the substantia nigra which is an important part of the nigrostriatal pathway. This pathway serves to coordinate motor movements and when left unbalanced, motor deficits would follow. For instance, when the dopamine neurons are lost from the substantia nigra, the condition of extreme muscle rigidity occurs as in the Parkinson's disease. The second region is the ventral tegmental area (VTA; or simply ventral tegmentum) which is at the hub of the mesolimbic pathway. Specifically, the VTA is the origin of dopaminergic cell bodies from which signals reach the anterior parts of the brain (e.g., frontal lobes) as well as the posterior parts (e.g., cerebellum). Because of this pathway regulates the experience of reward and pleasure, it is not surprising to see that food and drugs affect it the most in terms of a loss of impulse control. That is, the mesolimbic pathway is essential in regulating drug addiction. The potential mechanism is through the associative learning of the environmental cues and reward. For instance, through each drug use, individuals increasingly associate the cues related to each drug use (e.g., the room in which the drug is taken or the people with which individuals take drug). Over time, the drug enhances the dopamine-related, classically- conditioned cues associated with drug taking. As a result, later encounters with these cues will produce and heighten dopamine activity and subsequently prompt individuals to crave drugs. Moreover, excessive mesolimbic dopamine activity plays a role in schizophrenia, a behavioral disorder characterized by delusions, hallucinations, blunted emotion, agitation, etc. On the other hand, a lack of mesolimbic dopamine activity may induce deficits in attention.

Most people from Windsor were born in Australia (78.8%), followed by England (3.3%), and New Zealand (1.5%). The most common religious group in Windsor was Christianity (65.8%), 25.2% being Catholic and 23.0% Anglican. The second largest group was No Religion (28.9%). The most common occupations in Windsor included Professionals (15.9%), Technicians and Trades Workers (15.1%), Clerical and Administrative Workers (13.6%), Managers (12.8%), and Labourers (11.0%). The median weekly household income was . Geography Windsor's proximity to the Hawkesbury River has resulted in numerous disastrous floods. A horseshoe on the outside wall of the Macquarie Arms pub marks the level the flood peaked at in 1867. During the 1867 flood, beaches along the Hawkesbury River to Barrenjoey were littered with the debris from the town. History The Windsor area was originally inhabited by the Dharuk (also Darug) nation of indigenous aboriginal peoples. Windsor is the third-oldest place of British settlement on the Australian continent. Settlement at the location was first established circa 1791, near the head of navigation on the Hawkesbury River (known as Deerubbin in Dharuk). European settlers utilised the fertile river flats for agriculture. The area was originally called Green Hills, but renamed Windsor (after Windsor in England). The town was officially proclaimed in a Government and General Order issued from Government House, Sydney, dated 15 December 1810. Governor Lachlan Macquarie \\"marked out the district of Green Hills\\", which he \\"... called Windsor\\", after Windsor-on-the-Thames. While in Windsor, Governor Macquarie ordered the main institutions of organised settlement to be erected, including a church, school-house, gaol and \\"commodious inn\\" (Macquarie Arms Hotel). Of these new buildings, the most outstanding was Francis Greenway's St Matthew's Anglican Church. Governor Macquarie himself chose the site for the church. Samuel Marsden, principal chaplain of the colony, consecrated the church on 8 December 1822. Windsor was chosen during settlement because of its agricultural potential and accessible location. In 1813 a report was given to Governor Macquarie from Earl Bathurst detailing a proposed invasion of the Hawkesbury River by France. This planned invasion that did not eventuate targeted the Windsor granary in order to cut off supply to Sydney, demonstrating the relative importance of this new settlement on a global scale. Windsor is north-west of Sydney, and easily accessible by coastal shipping from Sydney along the Hawkesbury River. It was known as the \\"bread basket\\", ensuring the survival of the starving colony. The extensive agriculture caused major silting in the Hawkesbury River; by the 1890s the Hawkesbury River had become so blocked with silt, ships could not travel up to Windsor from the coast. By then, a railway (in 1864) and road (in 1814) had been built to compensate. On 1 January 1803, Daniel Egan was born in Windsor. He went on to become Mayor of Sydney in 1853.

Pitt Town, which is north west of Windsor, was a filming location for the Channel 7 television series A Country Practice. It was the set of the fictional town of Wandin Valley. Pitt Town hosted a doctor's clinic. Windsor High School at Mulgrave was also used as the fictional Burrigan High School in the series Transport Urban sprawl of metropolitan Sydney has almost reached Windsor. The town is now regarded as an outer suburb which has retained its appeal as a small country town. Growth in the Hawkesbury area has created an increased need for public transport and roads. Most people from Windsor traveled to work by car in 2016 (68.9%). Only 9.0% of people used public transport. Windsor railway station opened 1 December 1864. It is on the Richmond branch of the T1 North Shore & Western Line and T5 Cumberland Line of the Sydney Trains network. Located in the town centre is the Windsor Bridge which was constructed in 1874. It is the oldest existing crossing of the Hawkesbury River. There was a proposal in 2013 by the Government of New South Wales to demolish the existing bridge and replace it with a safer bridge. It was suggested by the political activist group Community Action for Windsor Bridge (CAWB) that a bypass is a better option to preserve history, ensure safety, and better manage the congestion of Windsor Road. Nevertheless, construction of the new bridge is underway and has continued despite the protests. On 18 May 2020 the replacement bridge was opened to traffic within Windsor, NSW. Windsor is also connected to Parramatta via the Windsor Road cycleway, with much of its route via the North-West T-way.

It is historically significant as the holder of the world speed record for steam locomotives at . The A4 class was designed by Nigel Gresley to power high-speed streamlined trains. The wind-tunnel-tested, aerodynamic body and high power allowed the class to reach speeds of over , although in everyday service it rarely attained this speed. While in British Railways days regular steam-hauled rail services in the UK were officially limited to a 90 mph 'line speed', pre-war, the A4s had to run significantly above 90 mph just to keep schedule on trains such as the Silver Jubilee and The Coronation,Yeadon 'Named Trains on LNER Lines' combined edition.

The locomotive is long and weighs 165 tons, including the tender. It is painted LNER garter blue with red wheels and steel rims. Mallard is now part of the National Collection at the United Kingdom's National Railway Museum in York. Record Mallard is the holder of the world speed record for steam locomotives at . The record was achieved on 3 July 1938 on the slight downward grade of Stoke Bank south of Grantham on the East Coast Main Line, and the highest speed was recorded at milepost 90¬º, between Little Bytham and Essendine. It broke the 1936 German (DRG Class 05) 002's record of . The record attempt was carried out during the trials of a new quick-acting brake (the Westinghouse \\"QSA\\" brake). Mallard was a very good vehicle for such an endeavour. The A4 class was designed for sustained 100+ mph (160+ km/h) running, and Mallard was one of a few of the class that were built with a double chimney and double Kylchap blastpipe, which made for improved draughting and better exhaust flow at speed. (The remainder of the class were retro-fitted in the late 1950s.) The A4's three-cylinder design made for stability at speed, and the large driving wheels meant that the maximum revolutions per minute (529.4/min at 126 mph) was within the capabilities of the technology of the day. Mallard was just four months old, meaning that it was sufficiently broken-in to run freely, but not overly worn. Selected to crew the locomotive on its record-breaking attempt were driver Joseph Duddington (a man renowned within the LNER for taking calculated risks) and fireman Thomas Bray. In the words of Rob Gwynne, assistant curator of rail vehicles at the National Railway Museum: The A4 class had previously had problems with the big end bearing for the middle cylinder, so the big end was fitted with a \\"stink bomb\\" of aniseed oil which would be released if the bearing overheated. Shortly after attaining the record speed, the middle big end did overheat and Mallard reduced speed, running at 70‚Äì75 miles an hour onwards to Peterborough. It then travelled to Doncaster for repair. This had been foreseen by the publicity department, who had many pictures taken for the press, in case Mallard did not make it back to Kings Cross. The (Edwardian period) Ivatt Atlantic that replaced Mallard at Peterborough was only just in sight when the head of publicity started handing out the pictures. Mallard builder's plate with works' number 1870 Stoke Bank has a gradient of between 1:178 and 1:200. Mallard, pulling a dynamometer car and six coaches, topped Stoke Summit at and accelerated downhill. The speeds at the end of each mile (1.6 km) from the summit were recorded as: 87¬Ω, 96¬Ω, 104, 107, 111¬Ω, 116 and 119 mph (141, 155, 167, 172, 179, 187 and 192 km/h); half-mile (800 m) readings after that gave 120¬æ, 122¬Ω, 123, 124¬º and finally 125 mph (194, 197, 198, 200 and 201 km/h). The speed recorded by instruments in the dynamometer car, marks were made every half second on a paper roll moving 24 inches for every mile travelled. Speeds could be calculated by measuring the distance between the timing marks. Immediately after the run staff in the dynamometer car calculated the speed over five second intervals, finding a maximum of 125 mph. 126 mph was seen for a single second but Gresley would not accept this as a reliable measurement and 125 miles an hour was the figure published. Ten years later, at the time of the 1948 Locomotive Exchanges, plaques were fixed to the sides of the locomotive, these stated 126 miles an hour, which has been the speed generally accepted ever since. Some writers have commented on the implausibility of the rapid changes in speed. A recent analysis has claimed that the paper roll in the dynamometer car was not moving at a constant rate and the peaks and troughs in the speed curve were just a result of this, the maximum speed being a sustained 124 mph for almost a mile. On arrival at King's Cross (just after the run), driver Joe Duddington and inspector Sid Jenkins were quoted as saying that they thought a speed of 130 mph would have been possible if the train had not had to slow for the junctions at Essendine. In addition, at the time of the run there was a permanent way restriction to 15 mph just north of Grantham which slowed the train as they sought to build up maximum speed before reaching the high-speed downhill section just beyond Stoke tunnel. On 3 July 2013, Mallard celebrated 75 years since achieving the world speed record, and to help commemorate this date all six surviving Class A4 locomotives were brought together around the turntable in the Great Hall of the National Railway Museum at York for a two-week 'great gathering'. The visitors include three UK-based, privately owned engines in 4464 Bittern, 60007 Sir Nigel Gresley and 60009 Union of South Africa (formerly Osprey). Mallards two internationally based sisters, 60008 Dwight D. Eisenhower and 60010 Dominion of Canada, were present after completing extensive transatlantic journeys, and undergoing cosmetic restoration at the NRM's workshops. Rival claims Mallards world record has never been officially exceeded by a steam locomotive, though the German Class 05 was at least very close: in 1936, two years before Mallards run, 05 002 had reached 200.4 km/h (124.5 mph) between Hamburg and Berlin. Stoke Bank is long, straight and slightly downhill, whereas the 1936 run of 05 002 took place on a horizontal stretch of track. Unlike world records for cars and aircraft, there is no requirement for an average of two runs in both directions, and assistance from gradient or wind has always been acceptable in rail speed records. Also, unlike Mallard, 05 002 survived the attempt undamaged: on the other hand, its train was only four coaches long (197 tons), whereas Mallards train was seven coaches (240 tons). In terms of rival claims, Gresley and the LNER had just one serious attempt at the record, which was far from a perfect run with a permanent way check just north of Grantham. Despite this a record was set. Gresley planned to have another attempt in September 1939, but this was prevented by the outbreak of World War II. Before the record run on 3 July 1938, it was calculated that was possible, and in fact Driver Duddington and LNER Inspector Sid Jenkins both said they might well have achieved this figure had they not had to slow for the Essendine junctions. There are claims that the Milwaukee Road class F7 and PRR S1 locomotives attained service speeds faster than Mallard's record. However, such claims were not officially verified. The LNER A4 and PRR T1 classes had the same piston stroke and driving wheel diameter, which gave both locomotives the same piston speed for the same track speed. Mallard record plate Thus, Mallard still officially holds the record; plaques affixed to each side of the locomotive commemorate the feat. The plaques were proposed and designed by Morley headmaster Harry Underwood, a keen steam enthusiast, in 1948.West Riding Small Locomotive Society journal, March 1948: \\"Harry Underwood is recorded as being the instigator of the idea (via the C.M.E. Doncaster) of fitting 'Mallard' with commemorative plaques. Photo of plaque design sent to him from Doncaster for his approval.\\" 1948 Locomotive Exchange Trials In 1948, shortly after the formation of British Railways, the decision was taken to test locomotives from all of the former 'Big Four' companies to find the best attributes of speed, power and efficiency with coal and water. There were two ways of testing and comparing locomotives: either at the Rugby Locomotive testing plant, which was not ready until late 1948 or by testing in the field itself. The results of these trials would be used to help design the British Railways Standard locomotives. The express passenger locomotive designs which would be compared were: London Midland Region (former LMS) Princess Coronation class, Eastern Region (former LNER) Class A4, Southern Region (former Southern) Merchant Navy class and Western Region (former GWR) 6000 Class or King class. Mallard with the number 'E22' during the Locomotive exchange of 1948 Three Gresley A4 locomotives were chosen to represent the Eastern Region: E22 Mallard, 60033 Seagull and 60034 Lord Faringdon. All of the locomotives had the Kylchap double blastpipe chimney arrangement and were fresh from Doncaster works. Mallard had emerged from Doncaster with a fresh coat of post-war garter blue livery, stainless steel numbers 22 with a small 'E' painted above them (for Eastern region), new boiler (its fourth) and third tender of its career. E22 Mallard was used on 8 June 1948 on the Waterloo-Exeter route. Driver Marrable took the famous A4 with a load of 481 tons tare, 505 tons full, the same that had been used on the previous trip by 35018 British India Line. Mallard reached Clapham Junction in 6 minutes 57 seconds and Woking in 28 minutes 47 seconds. At Hook there were adverse signals, causing Mallard to slow to a crawl. Even so, Salisbury was reached in 108 minutes and 28 seconds. Despite the signals earlier, the train was only 5-and-a-half minutes late. The net time was 95.5 minutes. Mallard failed after this trial and 60033 Seagull took over. On 10 June Seagull achieved the run in 96 minutes 22 seconds, but had departed 3 minutes late, meaning Seagull had arrived with the same load 3.5 minutes early. For Mallard, the 1948 Locomotive Exchange Trials were over, but Mallard returned to the Waterloo-Exeter line for a Locomotive Club of Great Britain (LCGB) railtour on 24 February 1963. The Elizabethan 60022 hauling The Elizabethan The Elizabethan was a flagship express that ran non-stop over the between London King's Cross and Edinburgh Waverley from 1953 to the mid-1960s. Until September 1961 it was steam-hauled. In its day it was the longest non-stop run in the world. Two crews were needed for the six-and-a- half-hour run. They were able to change over mid-journey by using a corridor tender. Only a few locomotives other than Mallard had such a tender. The last steam-hauled Elizabethans ran on 8 September 1961, the northbound (\\"Down\\" in British railway parlance) train was accompanied by photographers, journalists and performance recorders. Their outputs were uncoordinated and have only come to light over many years. Mallard hauled the train, with sister loco 60009 Union of South Africa hauling the corresponding \\"Up\\" train. The journalists wrote a valedictory piece in The Sunday Telegraph of 10 September 1961. This has recently been reproduced in a compendium of railway-related pieces from The Daily Telegraph and The Sunday Telegraph over the years. This names the driver and fireman from Kings Cross to York as Harold Birkett and John Thorne. They were replaced north of York by driver Bob Currie and fireman Alec Mackay. Chief Motive Power Inspector Bert Dixon stayed on the footplate for the whole trip. The photographers appear to have been from British Railways' own photography unit. Some of the photographs of the trip have survived in the \\"Liverpool Street Collection\\" at the National Railway Museum. Four of them were reproduced in a minority publication in 1971, one of them ‚Äì showing Driver Birkett using the corridor tender ‚Äì has been used in magazines since. Triangulation occurred in Railway Magazine in 2013 when a log of the run was published, with narrative, taken from Railway Performance Society's archives. The original log was compiled by Mr C. Hudson. The train arrived three minutes early after a run involving several speed checks and was interpreted as a credit to men, system and machine. Technical specifications Mallard front view Mallard in 1962. Mallard was released into traffic for the first time on 3 March 1938. It was the first A4 to be fitted with a Kylchap double blast pipe from new. This was one of the factors that led to its selection for the attempt on the world rail speed record in July of that year. Mallard wore a variety of liveries throughout its career. These were: garter blue as 4468, LNER wartime black from 13 June 1942, later wartime black with the tender marked as \\"NE\\" from 21 October 1943 as 22 with yellow small stencilled numbers, post-war garter blue with white and red lining from 5 March 1948 with stainless steel cabside number 22, British railways dark blue as 60022 from 16 September 1949, Brunswick green from 4 July 1952 and its original LNER garter blue for preservation in 1963. The A4 class was built with streamlined valances, or side skirting, but this was removed during the war to ease maintenance. Mallard lost its valances during a works visit 13 June 1942, regaining them in preservation in 1963. Mallard was fitted with twelve boilers during its 25-year career. These boilers were: 9024 (from construction), 8959 (from 4496 Golden Shuttle, 13 June 1942), 8907 (from 2511 Silver King, 1 August 1946), 8948 (from 31 Golden Plover, Walter K Whigham, 10 January 1951), 29301 (from 60019 Bittern, 4 July 1952), 29315 (from 60014 Silver Link, 23 April 1954), 29328 (new-build boiler, 7 June 1957), 29308 (from 60008 Dwight D. Eisenhower, 27 August 1958), 29310 (from 60009 Union of South Africa, 9 March 1960) and 27965 (from 60009 Union of South Africa, 10 August 1961). Mallard has had seven tenders throughout its career. It started off with a non-corridor tender in 1938, had corridor design tenders during its British Railways days and was fitted with a non-corridor tender in 1963 to recreate its original appearance. The tenders it has been fitted with are: 5642 (3 March 1938 ‚Äì 14 March 1939), 5639 (5 May 1939 ‚Äì 16 January 1948), 5323 (5 March 1948 ‚Äì 12 March 1953), 5648 (12 March 1953 ‚Äì 21 July 1958), 5330 (27 August 1958 ‚Äì 30 May 1962), 5651 (30 May 1962 ‚Äì 25 April 1963) and 5670 (current tender, masquerading as original tender 5642). The original non- corridor tender 5642 was later coupled to sister locomotive 60026 Miles Beevor when it was withdrawn on 21 December 1965 but later came into the possession of the A4 Preservation Society who had purchased this locomotive from the scrapyard to assist the restoration of classmate 4498 Sir Nigel Gresley. It was scrapped in 1973 as being surplus to requirements, by which time it had also donated parts to the restoration of A3 class locomotive 4472 Flying Scotsman, which had recently returned from America and was being restored at Derby Workshops. Mallard was allocated to three sheds during its career: Doncaster, transferring on 21 October 1943 to Grantham and on 11 April 1948 to Kings Cross Top Shed. Class Two A4s were exported after retirement, one to the USA (No. 60008 (LNER No. 4496) Dwight D. Eisenhower) and the other to Canada (No. 60010 (LNER No. 4489) Dominion of Canada). In October 2012, they came back to prepare for the 75th anniversary celebrations in 2013 of the record run.Day in pictures, 4 October 2012 , BBC News They and Mallard were joined at the National Railway Museum by No. 4464 (BR. No. 60019) Bittern, No. 60007 (LNER No. 4498) Sir Nigel Gresley and No. 60009 (LNER No. 4488, formerly Osprey) Union of South Africa. No. 60008 had its BR Brunswick Green livery refreshed and No. 60010 was re-painted in LNER Garter Blue with stainless steel lettering and number 4489 and fitted with the Canadian bell and whistle. In early 2014, the six A4s were displayed at the National Railway Museum Shildon, which was the final exhibition of the six engines together. In March 2014, the Mallard returned to York, and the 4464, 60007, and 60009 all returned to their owners. 60008 and 4489 remained at Shildon until April, and were returned respectively to the US and Canada from April‚ÄìJune 2014. Restoration Mallard was restored to working order in the 1980s, but has not operated since, apart from hauling some specials between York and Scarborough in July 1986 and a couple of runs between York and Harrogate/Leeds around Easter 1987. There was also the \\"Postal Pullman\\" from London, Marylebone to Banbury in 1988. The journey had good prior publicity and a large crowd had gathered in the large car park at Kings Sutton railway station and watched the train go through the station at speed. The train returned to London hauled by a diesel locomotive, while Mallard, pulling its support coach, went on to Tyseley. This was related to a special commemorative postage stamp issue.https://www.collectgbstamps.co.uk/explore/issues/?issue=326 Mallard is now part of the National Collection at the United Kingdom's National Railway Museum in York. On the weekend of 5 July 2008, Mallard was taken outside for the first time in years and displayed beside the three other A4s that are resident in the UK, thus reuniting them for the first time since preservation. It departed the museum for Locomotion, the NRM's outbase at Shildon on 23 June 2010, where it was a static exhibit, until it was hauled back to York on 19 July 2011 and put back on display in its original location in the Great Hall. Models Hornby Dublo first produced a model of Mallard in BR loco green for their 3-rail OO gauge system in 1958. Bachmann and Hornby have subsequently released models of Mallard several times in Garter Blue. Hornby released a model of Mallard in BR Express Passenger Blue and a limited edition model in BR Dark Loco Green. Hornby has also released a limited edition model of 4468 in LNER form along with the other five surviving A4s in 2013. A Corgi 1:120 scale model in Garter Blue as part of a series entitled \\"Rail Legends\\" is available. Hachette Publications have also released an 'O' Gauge 'Build-It-Yourself' model in Partwork format. This series is still current in June 2016.

Presnyakov. Great Abatis Border. 2010. Oil on canvas. Map of Zasechnaya cherta in 17th century Zasechnaya cherta (, loosely translated as Great Abatis Line or Great Abatis Border) was a chain of fortification lines, created by Grand Duchy of Moscow and later the Tsardom of Russia to protect it from the Crimean-Nogai Raids who, rapidly moving along the Muravsky Trail, ravaged the southern provinces of the country during a series of the Russo-Crimean Wars.Abatis Lines with maps at cultinfo.ru It was south of the original line along the Oka River. It also served as a border between the Muscovite State and the steppe nomads. As a fortification line stretching for hundreds kilometers, the Great Abatis Border is analogous to the Great Wall of China and the Roman limes. Abatis is a military term for a field fortification made by cutting down trees. The line was built from the felled trees that were arranged as a barricade. It was also fortified by ditches and earth mounds, palisades, watch towers and natural features like lakes and swamps. The width of the abatis mounts up to several hundred meters. In the most dangerous places the abatis was doubled, trebled etc., the gates and small wooden fortresses were created to check the passers.–ó–µ–ª–µ–Ω—ã–µ —Å—Ç–µ–Ω—ã –†–æ—Å—Å–∏–∏, –¢. –ë–µ–ª—è–µ–≤–∞, \\"–ù–∞—É–∫–∞ –∏ –ñ–∏–∑–Ω—å\\", ‚Ññ5 2004 –≥–æ–¥.

Stone and wooden kremlins of the towns were also included in the Great Abatis Line. Among these towns were: Serpukhov, Kolomna, Zaraysk, Tula, Ryazan, Belyov. Other fortresses in the line were smaller ostrogs. Other Russian fortification lines There were a large number of fortification lines in Russian history and it is difficult to get good information on them. The lines naturally moved south as the Russian state expanded. The earliest reference to abatis fortifications appears to be in a Novgorod chronicle of 1137-1139. Abatis lines began appearing in southern Rus' in the 13th century. The 'Great Abatis Line' extended from Bryansk to Meschera and was nominally completed in 1566. It was guarded by a local militia of about 35,000 in the second half of the 16th century. Another source gives an annual callup of 65,000. Behind the line was a mobile army headquartered in Tula (6,279 men in 1616, 17,005 in 1636). There are several notable lines.

Retrieved 13 December 2013) and Mal Leyland, MBE (born 1945), jointly known as the Leyland brothers, were Australian explorers and documentary film-makers, best known for their popular television show, Ask the Leyland Brothers. The show ran on Australian television between 1976-1980 and 1983-1984.Channel Surfing Safari, The Sydney Morning Herald, 21 April 2003 Early life When Mike was eight and Mal was five they migrated with their parents from England to Newcastle, New South Wales, and Mike attended Wallsend Public School. Aged 15 Mike won a trip to the 1956 Olympic Games in Melbourne from a cartoon-drawing competition, and his father bought him a 16mm movie camera to take along. Media career By the age of 21 Mike was a news cameraman at NBN Television and at age 18 Mal was working as a cadet at Newcastle's now-defunct newspaper The Sun. The Leylands realised there was a demand in seeing the Australian outback and the variety to be found in Australia in the 1960's. They filmed locations and arranged film nights at small cinemas and halls. The demand for these film nights lead to a television series. Their first regular TV series, Ask the Leyland Brothers, ran on Australian television from 1976 to 1980, and again from 1983 to 1984. The show often provided Australian viewers with their first look at outback Australia. A following documentary series called Leyland Brothers' World appeared on Australian television. Rather than viewers writing in and asking the Leyland brothers to visit a particular place in Australia and provide information about it as in Ask the Leyland Brothers, it focused on exploration by the Leyland brothers in Australia and featured a double-decker bus. The television show is not to be confused with the theme park of the same name. Honours In 1980 the brothers were awarded the MBE for services to the film industry.

In a 1997 article in The Sunday Age, Mike Leyland said that the initial A$1 million loan blew out due to rain during construction and a 27% interest rate. In July 1992 Chris Palmer of BDO Nelson was appointed receiver and manager of the park when the Leyland Brothers company failed to meet its loan commitment to the Commonwealth Bank. The theme park was sold for $800,000, and continued to trade successfully as the Great Aussie Bushcamp.Great Aussie Bushcamp website The brothers went bankrupt. Later careers After the 1992 bankruptcy, Mike and his wife Margie ran a New Lambton video store and worked for the park's new owner. In 1997 Mike sold part of his Tea Gardens property to fund the production of a far-north Queensland film for Channel Seven. Mike and his wife Margie signed a contract with Channel Seven for 12 one-hour documentaries, the first of which aired in 1998 in The World Around Us slot.

It was situated on the bank of the Volga River, about 30 km downstream from its confluence with the Kama River and some 130 km from modern Kazan in what is now Spassky District. West of it lies a small modern town, since 1991 known as Bolgar. The UNESCO World Heritage Committee inscribed Bolgar Historical and Archaeological Complex (ancient Bolghar hill fort) to the World Heritage List in 2014. Hill fort before reconstruction (lithography of XIX) Common view to hill fort Temples of hill fort  History  The city is supposed to have been the capital of Volga Bulgaria from as early as the 8th century. Regular Russian incursions along the Volga, and internecine fights forced the Volga Bulgarian kings to intermittently move their capital to Bilyar. After a destruction of Bilyar during the Mongol invasion, the older capital became a centre of a separate province (or duchy) within the Golden Horde. During the period of Mongol domination Bolgar acquired immense wealth, many imposing buildings, and grew tenfold in size. The Tokhtamysh‚ÄìTimur war saw a marked decline in its fortunes. It was sacked by Bulaq-Temir in 1361, endangered by Timur, looted by Russian pirates (ushkuiniki), and destroyed in 1431 by Vasily the Blind of Muscovy. As a Muslim religious center Bolgar persevered until the mid-16th century when the Khanate of Kazan was conquered by the Russian Czar Ivan IV and incorporated into the Russian state. During the Tsarist rule the site of the ancient town was settled by Russian commoners. Czar Peter the Great issued a special ukase to preserve the surviving ruins, which was probably a first Russian law aimed at preserving historical heritage.  Little pilgrimage  During the Soviet period, Bolgar was a center of a local Islamic movement known as The Little Hajj: Muslims from Tatarstan and other parts of the Soviet Union could not participate in the hajj to Mecca, so they travelled instead to Bolgar.

The town is part of their cultural heritage, because Volga Bulgaria is the predecessor state of the Khanate of Kazan, which in turn is in a way the predecessor of today's Russian republic of Tatarstan. Today, the capital of Tatarstan is Kazan, but many Tatars consider Bolghar to be their ancient and religious capital and to allow a glimpse of Muslim Bulgar life before the Mongol invasion of Volga Bulgaria.

Reagan called for the General Secretary of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, Mikhail Gorbachev, to open the Berlin Wall, which had separated West and East Berlin since 1961.https://www.politico.com/story/2017/06/11/reagan-challenges-gorbachev-to- tear-down-berlin-wall-june-12-1987-239376 The name is derived from a key line in the middle of the speech: \\"Mr. Gorbachev, tear down this wall!\\" Though it received relatively little media coverage at the time, it became widely known in 1989 after the fall of the Berlin Wall. Background The \\"tear down this wall\\" speech was not the first time Reagan had addressed the issue of the Berlin Wall. In a visit to West Berlin in June 1982, he stated, \\"I'd like to ask the Soviet leaders one question [...] Why is the wall there?\\". In 1986, 25 years after the construction of the wall, in response to West German newspaper Bild-Zeitung asking when he thought the wall could be removed, Reagan said, \\"I call upon those responsible to dismantle it [today]\\". On the day before Reagan's 1987 visit, 50,000 people had demonstrated against the presence of the American president in Berlin. During the visit itself, wide swaths of Berlin were closed off to prevent further anti-Reagan protests. The district of Kreuzberg, in particular, was targeted in this respect, with movement throughout this portion of the city in effect restrained completely (for instance the subway line 1 was shut down). (in German). About those demonstrators, Reagan said at the end of his speech: \\"I wonder if they ever asked themselves that if they should have the kind of government they apparently seek, no one would ever be able to do what they are doing again\\". The speech drew controversy within the Reagan administration, with several senior staffers and aides advising against the phrase, saying anything that might cause further East-West tensions or potential embarrassment to Gorbachev, with whom President Reagan had built a good relationship, should be omitted. American officials in West Germany and presidential speechwriters, including Peter Robinson, thought otherwise. According to an account by Robinson whose factual accuracy has been disputed, he traveled to West Germany to inspect potential speech venues, and gained an overall sense that the majority of West Berliners opposed the wall. Despite getting little support for suggesting Reagan demand the wall's removal, Robinson kept the phrase in the speech text. On Monday, May 18, 1987, President Reagan met with his speechwriters and responded to the speech by saying, \\"I thought it was a good, solid draft.\\" White House Chief of Staff Howard Baker objected, saying it sounded \\"extreme\\" and \\"unpresidential\\", and Deputy U.S. National Security Advisor Colin Powell agreed. Nevertheless, Reagan liked the passage, saying, \\"I think we'll leave it in.\\" Chief speechwriter Anthony Dolan gives another account of the line's origins, however, attributing it directly to Reagan. In an article published in The Wall Street Journal in November 2009, Dolan gives a detailed account of how in an Oval Office meeting that was prior to Robinson's draft Reagan came up with the line on his own. He records impressions of his own reaction and Robinson's at the time. This led to a friendly exchange of letters between Robinson and Dolan over their differing accounts, which The Wall Street Journal published. Speech Arriving in Berlin on Friday, June 12, 1987, President and Mrs. Reagan were taken to the Reichstag, where they viewed the wall from a balcony. Reagan then made his speech at the Brandenburg Gate at 2:00 pm, in front of two panes of bulletproof glass. Among the spectators were West German President Richard von Weizs√§cker, Chancellor Helmut Kohl, and West Berlin Mayor Eberhard Diepgen. That afternoon, Reagan said, Later on in his speech, President Reagan said, \\"As I looked out a moment ago from the Reichstag, that embodiment of German unity, I noticed words crudely spray-painted upon the wall, perhaps by a young Berliner, 'This wall will fall. Beliefs become reality.' Yes, across Europe, this wall will fall. For it cannot withstand faith; it cannot withstand truth. The wall cannot withstand freedom.\\" Another highlight of the speech was Reagan's call to end the arms race with his reference to the Soviets' SS-20 nuclear weapons, and the possibility \\"not merely of limiting the growth of arms, but of eliminating, for the first time, an entire class of nuclear weapons from the face of the earth. Response and legacy The speech received \\"relatively little coverage from the media\\", Time magazine wrote 20 years later. John Kornblum, senior US diplomat in Berlin at the time of Reagan's speech, and US Ambassador to Germany from 1997 to 2001, said \\"[The speech] wasn't really elevated to its current status until 1989, after the wall came down.\\" East Germany's communist rulers were not impressed, dismissing the speech as \\"an absurd demonstration by a cold warrior\\", as later recalled by Politburo member G√ºnter Schabowski. The Soviet press agency TASS accused Reagan of giving an \\"openly provocative, war-mongering speech.\\" Former West German Chancellor Helmut Kohl said he would never forget standing near Reagan when he challenged Gorbachev to tear down the Berlin Wall. \\"He was a stroke of luck for the world, especially for Europe.\\" In an interview with Reagan, he recalls the East German police not allowing people to get near the wall, which prevented the citizens from experiencing the speech at all. The fact that West German police acted in a similar way has, however seldom, been noted in accounts such as these. Peter Robinson, the White House wordsmith who drafted the address, said that the phrase \\"tear down this wall\\" was inspired by a conversation with Ingeborg Elz of West Berlin; in a conversation with Robinson, Elz remarked, \\"If this man Gorbachev is serious with his talk of Glasnost and perestroika he can prove it by getting rid of this wall.\\" Despite Reagan urging Gorbachev to tear down the Berlin Wall, there are some such as Romesh Ratnesar of Time magazine, who commented that there is little evidence that the speech had any impact on the decision to tear down the wall, let alone an impact on the people he addressed. Another critic was Liam Hoare in a 2012 article in The Atlantic, who pointed to the many reasons for the tendency for American media to focus on the significance of this particular speech, without weighing the complexity of the events as they unfolded in both East and West Germany and the Soviet Union. Author James Mann disagreed with both critics like Hoare, who saw Reagan's speech as having no real effect, and those who praised the speech as key to shaking Soviet confidence. In a 2007 opinion article in The New York Times, he put the speech in the context of previous Reagan overtures to the Soviet Union, such as the Reykjavik summit of the previous year, which had very nearly resulted in an agreement to eliminate American and Soviet nuclear weapons entirely. He characterized the speech as a way for Reagan to assuage his right-wing critics that he was still tough on communism, while also extending a renewed invitation to Gorbachev to work together to create \\"the vastly more relaxed climate in which the Soviets sat on their hands when the wall came down.\\" Reagan, claimed Mann, \\"wasn't trying to land a knockout blow on the Soviet regime, nor was he engaging in mere political theater. He was instead doing something else on that damp day in Berlin 20 years [before Mann's article] ‚Äì he was helping to set the terms for the end of the cold war.\\" In 2019, a bronze statue of Reagan was unveiled near the site of the speech.

Sometime in the 1990s, the X*Press X*Change service was renamed InGenius, and faded into obscurity shortly afterward with the rise of the modern Internet as well as improved cable television on-screen graphics technology. The X*Change/InGenius service was discontinued in 1997. Data protocol and user- developed software X*PRESS kept the data stream protocol secret, revealing the specifications to certain software developers only under non-disclosure agreements. Several users, unhappy with the limited capabilities of the PC software provided by X*PRESS or using computer systems for which X*PRESS did not provide any software, attempted to reverse-engineer the protocol of the data stream. This effort was helped by the fact that the Amiga version of X*Press X*Change was distributed on a floppy disk that had, by mistake, some random portions of the software source code on some of its unused blocks. The accidentally released source code provided some details and terminology used to describe the protocol, and other parts were purely reverse-engineered. It was never completely clear whether it was legal to publish or use the various forms of underground software that circulated among a small community of users.

The plane was built in 1900 as a solution to various operational restrictions imposed by the Foxton Lock flight. However, it was not a commercial success and only remained in full-time operation for ten years. The plane was dismantled in 1926. A project to re-create the plane commenced in the 2000s because the narrowbeam locks remain a bottleneck for leisure boat traffic. History The inclined plane under construction in 1900. By 1897, the Grand Junction Canal Company had acquired several of the canals comprising the Leicester line, and was keen to meet demand from carriers seeking to use wider beam (14 ft) craft, rather than the traditional narrow beam boats, which were the only type the locks could accommodate. Their solution was to build an inclined plane to the side of the locks. Initially, the company had planned for the plane to replace the locks, rather than having it act as a second, faster option. Construction began in 1898 and was finished by 10 July 1900. The plane was designed by Gordon Cale Thomas, after a large-scale prototype was built at the company's Bulbourne yard and he had assessed the climb. It had two tanks, or caissons, each capable of holding two narrowboats or a barge. The caissons were full of water, and so balanced each other. The caissons' vertical guillotine gates created a watertight seal. The lift was powered by a 25-horsepower (19 kW) stationary steam engine. The land for the plane was purchased for ¬£1,595 and total expenses for the project came to ¬£39,244 by 24 June 1900. The inclined plane had a journey time of 12 minutes for two boats up and two down, compared with 1¬º hours through the lock system, thereby improving the speed of passage up the hill tremendously. During a 12-hour day, 6,000 tons (6,100 tonnes) of cargo could pass between the upper and lower level. Unlike the locks, where water flowed downhill every time a boat passed through, on the inclined plane almost the same amount of water goes up and down the hill. Only the displaced water is moved, thus saving a great deal of water and giving better control of this vital resource. An initial problem with the plane was the stress placed on the tracks by the caissons. There was a plan to build a similar inclined plane at the Watford Locks at the southern end of the canal's summit level. However, this was never carried through (perhaps due to the low levels of traffic in the plane's first two years), and as the Watford Locks were never widened, the economic benefits of the plane could not be fully realised. The need to continually maintain a supply of steam for the plane's engine ‚Äì in expectation of traffic ‚Äì also proved to be a drain on finances. Thus, despite its obvious effectiveness, the Foxton Inclined Plane was mothballed in 1911 to save money. After that date it saw occasional use when the locks were undergoing maintenance. In 1926, dismantling of the incline's machinery began, and it was sold for scrap in 1928 for a mere ¬£250. That year the chimney on the engine house was demolished and its bricks used for various canal repairs. The mooring bollards from the incline can be found alongside the locks.  Preservation The Foxton Canal Museum is located in the former boiler house for the plane's steam engine. The museum covers the history of the locks and the plane, the lives of the canal workers, and other aspects of the local canal. There is also a collection of Measham pottery. The museum opened in 1989 and is accredited by the Museums, Libraries and Archives Council. Restoration The site of the Foxton Inclined Plane Boat Lift has been recognised as a Scheduled Ancient Monument and was on the Monuments at Risk Register. This recognition, together with the steady increase in leisure boating on British canals, means its restoration is now considered a key project in the development of the national waterway network. The cost of full restoration has been estimated at ¬£9 million (in 2006). Stage 1 of the project ‚Äì the clearing of the site and restoration of the canal arms above and below the plane ‚Äì was completed in 2008. A grant for ¬£1.7 million was received from the Heritage Lottery Fund towards the ¬£2.8 million cost of this first stage, and its successful completion resulted in the site being removed from the Monuments at Risk register.

History Fortress Oreshek Fortress Inside the fortress walls Interior of the dungeon A wooden fortress named Oreshek () or Orekhov () was built by Grand Prince Yury of Moscow (in his capacity as Prince of Novgorod) on behalf of the Novgorod Republic in 1323. After a series of conflicts, a peace treaty was signed at Oreshek on August 12, 1323 between Sweden and Grand Prince Yury and the Novgorod Republic. In 1348 king Magnus Eriksson attacked and briefly took the fortress during his crusade in the region in 1348‚Äì1352.Michael C. Paul, \\"Archbishop Vasilii Kalika, the Fortress at Orekhov and the Defense of Orthodoxy,\\" in Alan V. Murray, ed., The Clash of Cultures on the Medieval Baltic Frontier (Farnham, UK: Ashgate, 2009): 266‚Äì267. It was largely ruined by the time the Novgorodians retook the fortress in 1351. In 1478 the Novgorod Republic was absorbed by the Muscovy who immediately started to strengthen their border with Sweden. The existing small citadel was demolished and a new stone fortress with seven towers was constructed, which occupied almost the complete island. In 1554-1555, during the Russo-Swedish war, the Swedes laid siege to the fortress, with no success. In response, Muscovites besieged Vyborg, with no success either. During the Livonian war, in 1582 Swedish troops led by Pontus De La Gardie almost captured the fortress. After a row of artillery fire they managed to break into one of the towers, but were later repelled by Muscovites. The fort was captured by Sweden in 1611 during the Ingrian War after nine months of siege, when the defenders lost every 9 men of 10. During the Ingrian Campaign of tsar Alexei Mikhailovich in June 1656 the fortress came under a siege by voevoda Potyomkin which lasted until November 1656 with no success. In 1702, during the Great Northern War, the fortress was taken by Russians under Peter the Great in an amphibious assault: 440 Swedish soldiers defended the fort for ten days before surrendering. {see Siege of N√∂teborg (1702)}. Peter renamed the fortress to Shlisselburg, a transliteration into the Cyrillic alphabet of Schl√ºsselburg. The name, meaning \\"Key-fortress\\" in German, which refers to Peter's perception of the fortress as the \\"key to Ingria\\". During Imperial times the fortress lost its military role and was used as a notorious political prison. Immediately after the Russian Revolution of 1917 the prisoners, both political and criminal, were released, and set the prison on fire. Shortly before Shlisselburg was occupied by the German troops (8 September 1941), a garrison of 350 Red Army soldiers was sent to the fortress on Orekhovets island to bring supplies and munition to the frontline. The garrison held the abandoned castle for 500 days preventing the Germans from landing there and cutting the last transit route from Leningrad to the mainland. Heavy artillery fire by the Germans destroyed all the buildings inside the fortress and part of the outer towers and walls, but despite numerous attempts the fortress was not captured. During Operation Iskra (18 January 1943) the siege of the fortress was lifted. The war completely devastated the fortress. Out of original ten towers, the fortress retains only six (five Russian and one Swedish). Renovation of the walls and towers is slow, although still underway. A stone monument in memory of the first Russo-Swedish peace treaty (1323) was placed inside the fortress. Tourists can reach the island from May to October via Shlisselburg or from the Northern bank of Neva, via Petrokrepost' railway station with regular ferries that run every 10‚Äì15 minutes. Town A predecessor of the town was a posad that first appeared around the citadel on the island and in the late XV-early XVI century shifted to both banks of the Neva. Once Muscovites rebuilt the old citadel into a powerful stronghold leaving no place for residential purposes, residents and merchants were only allowed to the island to seek shelter from advancing Swedish troops. A posad on the southern bank was more convenient for its population, unlike for those living on the northern coast, it was easier to flee the enemies to the southeast, into the Russian mainland. The southern posad of Oreshek was turned into a town in 1702 by Peter the Great. In the course of Peter's administrative reform, Shlisselburg was included in Ingermanland Governorate (known since 1710 as St. Petersburg Governorate). In 1727, it became a part of Sankt-Petersburgsky Uyezd, and in 1755 Shlisselburgsky Uyezd was established. In 1914, Sankt-Peterburgsky Uyezd was renamed Petrogradsky Uyezd. Old Ladoga Channel that divides the town into two parts was constructed during 1719-1731 to ensure the safety of the vessel traffic along the southern coast of the dangerously turbulent Lake Ladoga. The plan of the channel was worked out by Emperor Peter I himself. In 1826 the channel became too shallow, so numerous locks, including those in the town, were built to maintain the depth of the channel. In 1861 construction of the new channel was begun, which runs between the old one and the lake. The old channel was finally abandoned in 1940, and what remains of it may still be seen in Shlisselburg. One of the most notorious political prisoners of Shlisselburg fortress was Iustin Zhuk (1887‚Äî1919), anarcho-syndicalist rebel from the Kiev Governorate. During the Russian Revolution he was released from prison and found a job on the gunpowder works of Shlisselburg, where he joined and then headed a commune of pro-Bolshevik workers. Zhuk supported the revolutionary forces in Petrograd and arranged day care for the children of workers as well as sourced food from Ukraine, where he was born. He led a group of Red Guards from Shlisselburg that were dispatched to the Russian- Finnish borderland to halt an intrusion of White Finns towards Petrograd and died in an ambush near Gruzino railway station in 1919. One of the streets in downtown Shlisselburg is named in memory of I. Zhuk On February 14, 1923, Shlisselburgsky Uyezd was merged into Petrogradsky Uyezd. In January 1924, the uyezd was renamed Leningradsky. St. Petersburg Governorate was twice renamed, first Petrograd Governorate and subsequently Leningrad Governorate. On August 1, 1927, the uyezds were abolished. Shlisselburg was made a town of okrug significance and belonged to Leningrad Okrug. On August 19, 1930, Leningradsky Prigorodny District, with the administrative center in Leningrad, was established. On August 19, 1936, the district was abolished and Shlisselburg became the town of oblast significance. During the Great Patriotic War Shlisselburg was swiftly occupied by the German troops (8 September 1941) that aimed to encircle Leningrad. On 18 January 1943 in the course of Operation Iskra Shlisselburg was retaken by the Red Army. As the railway connection to Leningrad via German-occupied Mga was still unavailable, two temporary railway passages over Neva were rapidly built in Shlisselburg, a temporary railway line over the ice, and shortly afterwards a wooden pile bridge. First train with supplies that went through Shlisselburg arrived in Leningrad on 7 February 1943. In 1944, the town's name was changed to Petrokrepost (lit., Peter's fortress). Shlisselburg regained its former name in 1992. In 2010, the administrative structure of Leningrad Oblast was harmonized with its municipal structure, and Shlisselburg became a town of district significance, subordinated to Kirovsky District. Administrative and municipal status Within the framework of administrative divisions, it is incorporated within Kirovsky District as Shlisselburgskoye Settlement Municipal Formation.Oblast Law #32-oz As a municipal division, Shlisselburgskoye Settlement Municipal Formation is incorporated within Kirovsky Municipal District as Shlisselburgskoye Urban Settlement.Law #100-oz Economy Industry There are several shipyards in Shlisselburg. The main company operating in the city is \\"Nevsky shipyard\\" which was founded in 1913 when the ship repair workshops were established.http://www.nssz.ru/en/istoriya-verfi.html The main activities of the company are: shipbuilding, ship repair, modernization and renovation and machine-building.http://www.nssz.ru/en/uslugi.html Transportation The railway platform of Petrokrepost, which has passenger service to Ladozhsky railway station in St. Petersburg, is located on the other bank of the Neva opposite of Shlisselburg. The A120 road, which encircles St. Petersburg, and the M18 Highway, which connects St. Petersburg and Murmansk, pass several kilometers south of the town. The Neva and Lake Ladoga are navigable. In the beginning of the 19th century, a system of canals bypassing Lake Ladoga was built, which at the time was a part of Mariinsky Water System, connecting the Neva with the Volga River. In particular, the New Ladoga Canal connects the Volkhov and the Neva Rivers. It replaced the Old Ladoga Canal built by Peter the Great, which thus became disused and decayed. The canals collectively are known as the Ladoga Canal. The canals originate from the Neva in Shlisselburg. Architecture The sluices of the Ladoga Canal The town does not retain many historical buildings, apart from a handful of 18th-century churches. Perhaps the most remarkable landmark is the Old Ladoga Canal, started at the behest of Peter the Great in 1719, and completed under the guidance of Fieldmarshal Munnich twelve years later. The canal stretches for ; its granite sluices date from 1836.

This assumption is useful in pricing fixed income securities, particularly bonds, and is fundamental to the pricing of derivative instruments. Arbitrage mechanics Arbitrage is the practice of taking advantage of a state of imbalance between two (or possibly more) markets. Where this mismatch can be exploited (i.e. after transaction costs, storage costs, transport costs, dividends etc.) the arbitrageur can \\"lock in\\" a risk-free profit by purchasing and selling simultaneously in both markets. In general, arbitrage ensures that \\"the law of one price\\" will hold; arbitrage also equalises the prices of assets with identical cash flows, and sets the price of assets with known future cash flows. The law of one price The same asset must trade at the same price on all markets (\\"the law of one price\\"). Where this is not true, the arbitrageur will: # buy the asset on the market where it has the lower price, and simultaneously sell it (short) on the second market at the higher price # deliver the asset to the buyer and receive that higher price # pay the seller on the cheaper market with the proceeds and pocket the difference. Assets with identical cash flows Two assets with identical cash flows must trade at the same price. Where this is not true, the arbitrageur will: # sell the asset with the higher price (short sell) and simultaneously buy the asset with the lower price # fund his purchase of the cheaper asset with the proceeds from the sale of the expensive asset and pocket the difference # deliver on his obligations to the buyer of the expensive asset, using the cash flows from the cheaper asset. An asset with a known future-price An asset with a known price in the future must today trade at that price discounted at the risk free rate. Note that this condition can be viewed as an application of the above, where the two assets in question are the asset to be delivered and the risk free asset. (a) where the discounted future price is higher than today's price: # The arbitrageur agrees to deliver the asset on the future date (i.e. sells forward) and simultaneously buys it today with borrowed money. # On the delivery date, the arbitrageur hands over the underlying, and receives the agreed price. # He then repays the lender the borrowed amount plus interest. # The difference between the agreed price and the amount repaid (i.e. owed) is the arbitrage profit. (b) where the discounted future price is lower than today's price: # The arbitrageur agrees to pay for the asset on the future date (i.e. buys forward) and simultaneously sells (short) the underlying today; he invests (or banks) the proceeds. # On the delivery date, he cashes in the matured investment, which has appreciated at the risk free rate. # He then takes delivery of the underlying and pays the agreed price using the matured investment. # The difference between the maturity value and the agreed price is the arbitrage profit. Point (b) is only possible for those holding the asset but not needing it until the future date. There may be few such parties if short-term demand exceeds supply, leading to backwardation. Fixed income securities :See also Fixed income arbitrage; Bond credit rating. Rational pricing is one approach used in pricing fixed rate bonds. Here, each cash flow can be matched by trading in (a) some multiple of a zero-coupon bond corresponding to the coupon date, and of equivalent credit worthiness (if possible, from the same issuer as the bond being valued) with the corresponding maturity, or (b) in a corresponding strip and ZCB. Then, given that the cash flows can be replicated, the price of the bond must today equal the sum of each of its cash flows discounted at the same rate as each ZCB (per #Assets with identical cash flows). Were this not the case, arbitrage would be possible and would bring the price back into line with the price based on ZCBs. The mechanics are as follows. Where the price of the bond is misaligned with the present value of the ZCBs, the arbitrageur could: #finance her purchase of whichever of the bond or the sum of the ZCBs was cheaper #by short selling the other #and meeting her cash flow commitments using the coupons or maturing zeroes as appropriate #then, her profit would be the difference between the two values. The pricing formula is then P_0 = \\\\sum_{t=1}^T\\\\frac{C_t}{(1+r_t)^t}, where each cash flow C_t\\\\, is discounted at the rate r_t\\\\, that matches the coupon date. Often, the formula is expressed as P_0 = \\\\sum_{t=1}^ T C(t) \\\\times P(t), using prices instead of rates, as prices are more readily available. Pricing derivatives A derivative is an instrument that allows for buying and selling of the same asset on two markets ‚Äì the spot market and the derivatives market. Mathematical finance assumes that any imbalance between the two markets will be arbitraged away. Thus, in a correctly priced derivative contract, the derivative price, the strike price (or reference rate), and the spot price will be related such that arbitrage is not possible. See Fundamental theorem of arbitrage-free pricing. Futures In a futures contract, for no arbitrage to be possible, the price paid on delivery (the forward price) must be the same as the cost (including interest) of buying and storing the asset. In other words, the rational forward price represents the expected future value of the underlying discounted at the risk free rate (the \\"asset with a known future-price\\", as above); see Spot‚Äìfuture parity. Thus, for a simple, non-dividend paying asset, the value of the future/forward, F(t)\\\\,, will be found by accumulating the present value S(t)\\\\, at time t\\\\, to maturity T\\\\, by the rate of risk-free return r\\\\,. :F(t) = S(t)\\\\times (1+r)^{(T-t)}\\\\, This relationship may be modified for storage costs, dividends, dividend yields, and convenience yields; see futures contract pricing. Any deviation from this equality allows for arbitrage as follows. *In the case where the forward price is higher: # The arbitrageur sells the futures contract and buys the underlying today (on the spot market) with borrowed money. # On the delivery date, the arbitrageur hands over the underlying, and receives the agreed forward price. # He then repays the lender the borrowed amount plus interest. # The difference between the two amounts is the arbitrage profit. *In the case where the forward price is lower: # The arbitrageur buys the futures contract and sells the underlying today (on the spot market); he invests the proceeds. # On the delivery date, he cashes in the matured investment, which has appreciated at the risk free rate. # He then receives the underlying and pays the agreed forward price using the matured investment. [If he was short the underlying, he returns it now.] # The difference between the two amounts is the arbitrage profit. Swaps Rational pricing underpins the logic of swap valuation. Here, two counterparties \\"swap\\" obligations, effectively exchanging cash flow streams calculated against a notional principal amount, and the value of the swap is the present value (PV) of both sets of future cash flows \\"netted off\\" against each other. To be arbitrage free, the terms of a swap contract are such that, initially, the Net present value of these future cash flows is equal to zero; see Swap (finance) #Valuation and Pricing. Once traded, swaps can (must) also be priced using rational pricing. The examples below are for Interest rate swaps - and is representative of pure rational pricing as it excludes credit risk - although the principle applies to any type of swap. =Valuation at initiation= Consider a fixed-to-floating Interest rate swap where Party A pays a fixed rate (\\"Swap rate\\") , and Party B pays a floating rate. Here, the fixed rate would be such that the present value of future fixed rate payments by Party A is equal to the present value of the expected future floating rate payments (i.e. the NPV is zero). Were this not the case, an arbitrageur, C, could: # Assume the position with the lower present value of payments, and borrow funds equal to this present value # Meet the cash flow obligations on the position by using the borrowed funds, and receive the corresponding payments‚Äîwhich have a higher present value # Use the received payments to repay the debt on the borrowed funds # Pocket the difference ‚Äì where the difference between the present value of the loan and the present value of the inflows is the arbitrage profit =Subsequent valuation= The Floating leg of an interest rate swap can be \\"decomposed\\" into a series of forward rate agreements. Here, since the swap has identical payments to the FRA, arbitrage free pricing must apply as above ‚Äì i.e. the value of this leg is equal to the value of the corresponding FRAs. Similarly, the \\"receive-fixed\\" leg of a swap can be valued by comparison to a bond with the same schedule of payments. (Relatedly, given that their underlyings have the same cash flows, bond options and swaptions are equatable.) See Swap (finance)#Using bond prices. Options As above, where the value of an asset in the future is known (or expected), this value can be used to determine the asset's rational price today. In an option contract, however, exercise is dependent on the price of the underlying, and hence payment is uncertain. Option pricing models therefore include logic that either \\"locks in\\" or \\"infers\\" this future value; both approaches deliver identical results. Methods that lock-in future cash flows assume arbitrage free pricing, and those that infer expected value assume risk neutral valuation. To do this, (in their simplest, though widely used form) both approaches assume a \\"binomial model\\" for the behavior of the underlying instrument, which allows for only two states ‚Äì up or down. If S is the current price, then in the next period the price will either be S up or S down. Here, the value of the share in the up-state is S √ó u, and in the down- state is S √ó d (where u and d are multipliers with d < 1 < u and assuming d < 1+r < u; see the binomial options model). Then, given these two states, the \\"arbitrage free\\" approach creates a position that has an identical value in either state ‚Äì the cash flow in one period is therefore known, and arbitrage pricing is applicable. The risk neutral approach infers expected option value from the intrinsic values at the later two nodes. Although this logic appears far removed from the Black‚ÄìScholes formula and the lattice approach in the Binomial options model, it in fact underlies both models; see The Black‚ÄìScholes PDE. The assumption of binomial behaviour in the underlying price is defensible as the number of time steps between today (valuation) and exercise increases, and the period per time-step is correspondingly short. The Binomial options model allows for a high number of very short time-steps (if coded correctly), while Black‚ÄìScholes, in fact, models a continuous process. The examples below have shares as the underlying, but may be generalised to other instruments. The value of a put option can be derived as below, or may be found from the value of the call using put-call parity. =Arbitrage free pricing= Here, the future payoff is \\"locked in\\" using either \\"delta hedging\\" or the \\"replicating portfolio\\" approach. As above, this payoff is then discounted, and the result is used in the valuation of the option today. Delta hedging It is possible to create a position consisting of Œî shares and 1 call sold, such that the position's value will be identical in the S up and S down states, and hence known with certainty (see Delta hedging). This certain value corresponds to the forward price above (\\"An asset with a known future price\\"), and as above, for no arbitrage to be possible, the present value of the position must be its expected future value discounted at the risk free rate, r. The value of a call is then found by equating the two. # Solve for Œî such that: #: value of position in one period = Œî √ó S up - max (S up ‚Äì strike price, 0 ) = Œî √ó S down - max (S down ‚Äì strike price, 0) # Solve for the value of the call, using Œî, where: #: value of position today = value of position in one period √∑ (1 + r) = Œî √ó S current ‚Äì value of call The replicating portfolio It is possible to create a position consisting of Œî shares and $B borrowed at the risk free rate, which will produce identical cash flows to one option on the underlying share. The position created is known as a \\"replicating portfolio\\" since its cash flows replicate those of the option. As shown above (\\"Assets with identical cash flows\\"), in the absence of arbitrage opportunities, since the cash flows produced are identical, the price of the option today must be the same as the value of the position today. # Solve simultaneously for Œî and B such that: #* Œî √ó S up - B √ó (1 + r) = \\\\max ( 0, S up ‚Äì strike price ) #* Œî √ó S down - B √ó (1 + r) = \\\\max ( 0, S down ‚Äì strike price ) # Solve for the value of the call, using Œî and B, where: #* call = Œî √ó S current - B Note that there is no discounting here ‚Äì the interest rate appears only as part of the construction. This approach is therefore used in preference to others where it is not clear whether the risk free rate may be applied as the discount rate at each decision point, or whether, instead, a premium over risk free, differing by state, would be required. The best example of this would be under Real options analysisSee Ch. 23, Sec. 5, in: Frank Reilly, Keith Brown (2011). \\"Investment Analysis and Portfolio Management.\\" (10th Edition). South-Western College Pub. where managements' actions actually change the risk characteristics of the project in question, and hence the Required rate of return could differ in the up- and down-states. Here, in the above formulae, we then have: \\"Œî √ó S up - B √ó (1 + r up)...\\" and \\"Œî √ó S down - B √ó (1 + r down)...\\" . See Real options valuation#Technical considerations. (Another case where the modelling assumptions may depart from rational pricing is the valuation of employee stock options.) =Risk neutral valuation= Here the value of the option is calculated using the risk neutrality assumption. Under this assumption, the \\"expected value\\" (as opposed to \\"locked in\\" value) is discounted. The expected value is calculated using the intrinsic values from the later two nodes: \\"Option up\\" and \\"Option down\\", with u and d as price multipliers as above. These are then weighted by their respective probabilities: \\"probability\\" p of an up move in the underlying, and \\"probability\\" (1-p) of a down move. The expected value is then discounted at r, the risk-free rate. # Solve for p #: under risk-neutrality, for no arbitrage to be possible in the share, today's price must represent its expected value discounted at the risk free rate (i.e., the share price is a Martingale): #: \\\\begin{align} S &= \\\\frac{p \\\\times S_u + (1-p)\\\\times S_d}{1 + r} \\\\\\\\\\\\ &= \\\\frac{p\\\\times u\\\\times S + (1-p)\\\\times d\\\\times S}{1 + r} \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\Rightarrow p &= \\\\frac{(1+r) - d}{u-d}\\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\end{align} # Solve for call value, using p #: for no arbitrage to be possible in the call, today's price must represent its expected value discounted at the risk free rate: #: \\\\begin{align} C &= \\\\frac{p\\\\times C_u + (1-p) \\\\times C_d}{1+r} \\\\\\\\\\\\ &= \\\\frac{p\\\\times \\\\max(S_u - k, 0) + (1-p) \\\\times\\\\max(S_d -k, 0)}{1+r} \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\end{align} The risk neutrality assumption Note that above, the risk neutral formula does not refer to the expected or forecast return of the underlying, nor its volatility ‚Äì p as solved, relates to the risk-neutral measure as opposed to the actual probability distribution of prices. Nevertheless, both arbitrage free pricing and risk neutral valuation deliver identical results. In fact, it can be shown that \\"delta hedging\\" and \\"risk- neutral valuation\\" use identical formulae expressed differently. Given this equivalence, it is valid to assume \\"risk neutrality\\" when pricing derivatives. A more formal relationship is described via the fundamental theorem of arbitrage-free pricing. Pricing shares The arbitrage pricing theory (APT), a general theory of asset pricing, has become influential in the pricing of shares. APT holds that the expected return of a financial asset can be modelled as a linear function of various macro-economic factors, where sensitivity to changes in each factor is represented by a factor specific beta coefficient: :E\\\\left(r_j\\\\right) = r_f + b_{j1}F_1 + b_{j2}F_2 + ... + b_{jn}F_n + \\\\epsilon_j :where :* E(r_j) is the risky asset's expected return, :* r_f is the risk free rate, :* F_k is the macroeconomic factor, :* b_{jk} is the sensitivity of the asset to factor k, :* and \\\\epsilon_j is the risky asset's idiosyncratic random shock with mean zero. The model derived rate of return will then be used to price the asset correctly ‚Äì the asset price should equal the expected end of period price discounted at the rate implied by model. If the price diverges, arbitrage should bring it back into line. Here, to perform the arbitrage, the investor \\"creates\\" a correctly priced asset (a synthetic asset), a portfolio with the same net-exposure to each of the macroeconomic factors as the mispriced asset but a different expected return. See the arbitrage pricing theory article for detail on the construction of the portfolio. The arbitrageur is then in a position to make a risk free profit as follows: *Where the asset price is too low, the portfolio should have appreciated at the rate implied by the APT, whereas the mispriced asset would have appreciated at more than this rate. The arbitrageur could therefore: #Today: short sell the portfolio and buy the mispriced-asset with the proceeds. #At the end of the period: sell the mispriced asset, use the proceeds to buy back the portfolio, and pocket the difference. *Where the asset price is too high, the portfolio should have appreciated at the rate implied by the APT, whereas the mispriced asset would have appreciated at less than this rate. The arbitrageur could therefore: #Today: short sell the mispriced-asset and buy the portfolio with the proceeds. #At the end of the period: sell the portfolio, use the proceeds to buy back the mispriced-asset, and pocket the difference. Note that under \\"true arbitrage\\", the investor locks-in a guaranteed payoff, whereas under APT arbitrage, the investor locks- in a positive expected payoff. The APT thus assumes \\"arbitrage in expectations\\" ‚Äî i.e. that arbitrage by investors will bring asset prices back into line with the returns expected by the model. The capital asset pricing model (CAPM) is an earlier, (more) influential theory on asset pricing. Although based on different assumptions, the CAPM can, in some ways, be considered a \\"special case\\" of the APT; specifically, the CAPM's security market line represents a single-factor model of the asset price, where beta is exposure to changes in the \\"value of the market\\" as a whole. No-arbitrage pricing under systemic risk Classical valuation methods like the Black- Scholes model or the Merton model cannot account for systemic counterparty risk which is present in systems with financial interconnectedness. More details regarding risk-neutral, arbitrage-free asset and derivative valuation can be found in the systemic risk article (see also valuation under systemic risk).

He was the father of Lady Jane Grey, known as \\"the Nine Days' Queen\\". Portrait of Robert Dudley, 1st Earl of Leicester, once misidentified as that of Henry Grey. Attributed to an unknown Flemish painter. Origins He was the son and heir of Thomas Grey, 2nd Marquess of Dorset (1477‚Äì1530) by his wife Margaret Wotton (1487‚Äì1541), daughter of Sir Robert Wotton (c. 1463‚Äì1524) of Boughton Malherbe in Kent. Through his father he was a great-grandson of Elizabeth Woodville, the wife of King Edward IV, by her first marriage to Sir John Grey of Groby. Marriage and progeny Cancelled betrothal Before 1530, Grey was betrothed to Catherine FitzAlan, the daughter of William FitzAlan, 18th Earl of Arundel, whom he later refused to marry.Julian Lock, \\"Fitzalan, Henry, twelfth earl of Arundel (1512‚Äì1580)\\", Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, Oxford University Press, 2004. Marriage to Lady Frances Brandon In 1533, with the permission of King Henry VIII he married Lady Frances Brandon (1517‚Äì1559), the daughter of Charles Brandon, 1st Duke of Suffolk by his wife Mary Tudor, the sister of King Henry VIII. They had three daughters: *Lady Jane Grey (1537‚Äì1554) *Lady Katherine Grey (1540‚Äì1568) *Lady Mary Grey (1545‚Äì1578) Career Henry VIII's reign Henry Grey became the 3rd Marquess of Dorset in 1530 following the death of his father. Before Henry VIII's death in 1547, Grey became a fixture in court circles. A knight of the Bath, he was the king's sword bearer at Anne Boleyn's coronation in 1533, at Anne of Cleves' arrival in 1540, and at the capture of Boulogne in 1545. Twice he bore the Cap of Maintenance in parliament. He helped lead the army in France in 1545. In 1547 he joined the Order of the Garter. Edward VI's reign After Henry VIII's death in 1547, Grey fell out of favour with the leader of King Edward VI's government, Edward Seymour, 1st Duke of Somerset and Lord Protector of England. Returning to his home in Bradgate, Leicestershire, Grey concentrated on raising his family to greater heights. Thus, with the Protector's brother Thomas, Lord Seymour, Grey conspired to have his daughter Jane married to the King. This plot failed, ending in Seymour's execution, but Grey emerged unscathed. In 1549, John Dudley, Earl of Warwick, overthrew the Protectorship and secured power by appointing loyal friends to the Privy Council. Grey joined the Council as a part of this group. In July 1551 his wife's youngest half-brother, Charles Brandon, 3rd Duke of Suffolk, died. Henry Grey was created Duke of Suffolk jure uxoris on 11 October 1551, in the same ceremony that elevated John Dudley to the Dukedom of Northumberland. Protestantism Henry Grey was best known for his zeal for the Protestant faith. The Swiss reformer Heinrich Bullinger dedicated a book to him in 1551 and frequently corresponded with the family. In Parliament and on the Privy Council, Grey pushed for further Protestant reforms. He is credited with making Leicestershire one of the most reliably Protestant counties in early modern England. Queen Jane Seriously ill, and fearing his own death, King Edward VI granted Northumberland's request for the marriage of Suffolk's daughter Lady Jane Grey to Northumberland's son, Lord Guildford Dudley, on 25 May 1553. Edward later altered his will to make Jane his designated successor. Edward died on 6 July 1553, and three days later Suffolk, Northumberland, and other members of the Privy Council proclaimed Jane queen.Grey, Henry, duke of Suffolk (1517‚Äì1554), magnate by Robert C. Braddock in Dictionary of National Biography (Oxford University Press, 2004) This proclamation failed; not by a large-scale rallying of forces in the country to Henry VIII's eldest daughter, the future Queen Mary I, as is often thought, but by a wavering Privy Council switching its allegiance to Mary during Northumberland's absence on campaign against her. The decision was led by Henry FitzAlan, 19th Earl of Arundel, and William Herbert, 1st Earl of Pembroke. Arundel had been imprisoned earlier by Northumberland for having sided with the previous Protector, Somerset, but it is not clear why Pembroke revolted; especially since his son and heir, Henry Herbert, having married Henry Grey's other daughter, Catherine, the same day as Jane's wedding. The country was divided in its loyalties to the two contenders for queen at the time.Eric Ives (ref.) By his wife's friendship with the new Queen Mary, Grey and his daughter and son-in-law temporarily avoided execution. However, Mary had Henry Grey beheaded on 23 February 1554, after his conviction for high treason for his part in Sir Thomas Wyatt's attempt (JanuaryFebruary 1554) to overthrow her after she announced her intention to marry King Philip II of Spain. Mummified head A mummified head, reputedly that of Henry Grey, 1st Duke of Suffolk, which was found in 1849 at Holy Trinity, Minories and later passed to St Botolph's Aldgate where it was eventually buried in 1990 According to Walter George Bell (writing in 1920),Walter George Bell, Unknown London (London: John Lane, 1920), pp. 3‚Äì18. the severed head of the Duke was discovered in a vault in the Church of Holy Trinity, Minories in London in 1851, preserved by the tannin-rich oak sawdust used to pad the basket on the scaffold on which he had been executed 297 years earlier. Bell believed the head might have been hidden by the Duke's widow to prevent it from being exposed on a spike on London Bridge. Both of them had worshipped in the chapel at Holy Trinity. The church was closed in 1899 and deconsecrated and the head found a new resting place at St Botolph's Church, Aldgate, to which Holy Trinity Parish had been annexed. In 1920, the vicar of St Botolph's kept it in a glass box inside a locked cupboard and was willing to display it to historians, but not to \\"mere tourists\\". The head was examined in the late 19th century by Sir George Scharf, former Keeper of the National Portrait Gallery, who noted a strong resemblance between its features and those in the portrait of the duke then in the possession of the Marquess of Salisbury at Hatfield. However, Bell also notes a scandal at Holy Trinity in 1786 in which a sexton had been found sawing and chopping up coffins in the vaults and using the wood to stoke the fire in his quarters. Many of the bodies had been partly dismembered in the process and Bell warned his readers that the surviving head might well have resulted from this debacle. In later years, the head was sealed in a vault in the crypt at St Botolph's, until a planned conversion of the space into an office resulted in an archaeological investigation of the site between April and July 1990. The archaeologists recovered the head from the vault and it was buried in the churchyard by the parish. Notes References *Robert C.

History Menindee is the oldest European settlement in western New South Wales, and the first town to be established on the Darling River. The first European to visit the area was the surveyor and explorer Major Thomas Mitchell in 1835. He was followed by Charles Sturt in 1844 and the town was the advance base for the Burke and Wills expedition in 1860. Burke and Wills The Burke and Wills expedition camped at Menindee on their journey to cross Australia from Melbourne to the Gulf of Carpentaria. They arrived here on 14 October 1860, crossed the Darling River at Kinchega Station and made Camp XXXIV (their thirty-fourth camp since leaving Melbourne). There was dissent within the party and the deputy-leader George Landells resigned. Robert O'Hara Burke split the party, heading north to Cooper Creek with half the men, stores and animals. The remaining men, stores and animals made a depot camp at Pamamaroo Creek and a sign and cairn mark the site of the camp. This camp was used for the remainder of 1860 and for most of 1861. While in Menindee, Burke stayed at the Maiden's Hotel, which was then owned by Thomas Pain and was known as Pain's Hotel.  Heritage listings  Menindee has a number of heritage-listed sites, including: * 15 km south-west: Kinchega Woolshed Population According to the 2016 census of Population, there were 551 people in Menindee. * Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people made up 36.1% of the population. * 79.3% of people were born in Australia and 84.3% of people only spoke English at home. * The most common responses for religion were No Religion 35.3% and Roman Catholic 23.6%. Geography Menindee is located where the transcontinental railway line crosses the Darling River. Menindee railway station is serviced by the NSW TrainLink Outback Xplorer passenger train from Sydney to Broken Hill on Monday, returning from Broken Hill to Sydney on Tuesday. The GSR Indian Pacific also stops once weekly in each direction on request. The railway line is about 900 km west of Sydney and about 110 kilometres south-east of Broken Hill. Situated on the western edge of town is the Kinchega National Park. Water supply A weir on the Darling River near Menindee diverts water from the river into a series of shallow, otherwise dry, overflow lakes. The Menindee Lakes, also known as the Menindee Water Storage Scheme, regulate the river flow for irrigation downstream into South Australia. Menindee residents had complained about the town's \\"putrid\\" water quality and claimed that cotton growers were removing water from the river during the recent drought.video shows dead 'century-old fish' SMH 9 January 2019 Generally the health of river systems is reliant on summer rains. Some locals were carting water from other sources. The WaterNSW advised property owners not to water their stock from the Darling. The river is subject to blooms of blue green algae in summer. Richard Kingsford, Director of the Centre for Ecosystem Science at the University of NSW said the Menindee Lakes had been drained more often than in the past. In July 2018, 23 gigalitres of environmental water was delivered to the Darling River; this reconnected isolated parts of the river and flushed out algae. In early 2019, up to one million native fish were found dead along a 40-kilometre stretch of the river in Menindee, including the large and critically endangered Murray cod. The apparent trigger for these deaths was a sudden drop in temperature, causing much of the algae bloom to decompose. The levels of dissolved oxygen in the river then fell too low for the fish to survive. Widespread rainfall over north-west NSW and southern Queensland during January/February 2020 started to flow into Menindee Lakes (Lake Wetherell) on 10 March. It was estimated that over 550 gigalitres would reach Menindee Lakes as a result of this flow event. Increased numbers of waterbirds have been observed in the area. Climate Menindee has a desert climate with an annual average rainfall of just 245.8 mm (9.6 in), however rainfall varies significantly from year to year, with the town often going without rainfall for months on end, but occasional severe rainstorms can cause falls of over 100 mm in a day, the last time this happened being January 2011. Menindee is tied with Bourke in recording the hottest temperature in New South Wales, with a temperature of 49.7 ¬∞C (121.5 ¬∞F) recorded on 10 January 1939.  Transport  Menindee is served by The Outback Xplorer (New South Wales Xplorer) service between Sydney and Broken Hill with one train in each direction per week. Trains head west (to Broken Hill) on Mondays and east on Tuesdays. A community access bus service runs to Broken Hill and return Monday to Friday (except public holidays), run by CDC Broken Hill (formerly Murton's City Bus Pty Ltd). No major highway runs through Menindee but the Barrier Highway between Adelaide and Nyngan runs nearby to the north through Broken Hill.

The book is also referred to as Iron made with Pit-Coale, Sea-Coale, &c.; And with the same Fuell to Melt and Fine Imperfect Mettals, And Refine perfect Mettals. Many attendant difficulties had to be overcome before this fuel could be applied to the purpose of smelting iron. Dudley does not describe in his book how he was using coal, only that he was. In so doing, he described his use successively of an ironworks on Pensnett Chase and at Cradley, of a furnace at Himley, and of a furnace at Hasco Bridge near Gornal. Dudley does mention several things that indicate what he was doing. The coal he used was the small pieces and slack which were \\"little or of no use in that inland country\\" and so brought in no money. This coal debris was left in heaps and \\"crowded moist slack heat naturally, and kindle in the middle of these great heaps, often sets the coal works on fire\\" and that \\"Also from these sulphurous heaps, mixed with ironstone (for out of many of the same pits is gotten much ironstone or mine), the fires heating vast quantities of water, passing through these soughs or adits becometh as hot as the bath at Bath\\".Scrivenor quoting Dudley, Dudley describes two rival attempts to smelt iron with coal instigated by supporters of Parliament during the Civil War and the Interregnum. Dudley visited both sites and having examined their furnaces and production methods, when asked his opinion, informed the proprietors that they would fail. The first attempt was by Captain Buck, with the backing of many parliamentary officers including Oliver Cromwell, with technical help from Edward Dagney, an Italian. In the second attempt in the late 1656‚Äì67 by Captain John Copley also failed despite Dudley, at no charge, improving the efficiency of Copley's bellows. Dudley reapplied for a patent from Charles II, in 1660 stating \\"and seeing no man able to perform the mastery of making of iron with pit-coal or sea-coal, ... [without my] laudable inventions the author was, and is, unwilling [that they] should fall to the ground and die with him\\".Scrivenor quoting Dudley, A significant feature of his great work Metallum Martis is a map showing Dudley Castle where he correctly identifies the order and geographic layout of strata of coal and ironstone under survey. Considered to be the earliest of recorded geologic maps, Metallum Martis marks a turning point in the evolution of scientific rationale concerning the recording and interpretation of geological information. It is considered to have been made at Castle Hill in Dudley by Dud Dudley in 1665.

The agency cooperates with numerous national and international entities who are active in aerospace research and technology. Nationally, ASI is responsible for both drafting the National Aerospace Plan and ensuring it is carried out. To do this the agency operates as the owner/coordinator of a number of Italian space research agencies and assets such as CIRA as well as organising the calls and opportunities process for Italian industrial contractors on spaceflight projects. Internationally, the ASI provides Italy's delegation to the Council of the European Space Agency and to its subordinate bodies as well as representing the country's interests in foreign collaborations. ASI's main headquarters are located in Rome, Italy,\\"Contacts .\\" Italian Space Agency. Retrieved on February 27, 2016. \\"Via del Politecnico snc 00133 Rome, Italy\\" and the agency also has direct control over two operational centres: the Centre for Space Geodesy (CGS) located in Matera in Italy, and its own spaceport, the Broglio Space Centre (formerly the San Marco Equatorial Range) on the coastal sublittoral of Kenya, currently used only as a communications ground station. One further balloon launch base located in Trapani was permanently closed in 2010. In 2020 ASI's annual revenues budget was approximately ‚Ç¨2.0 billion and it directly employed around 200 workers.  History   Early Italian aerospace  San Marco 1 (top), Italy's first artificial satellite, at checkout on Wallops Island Activities started officially in 1988 but the agency drew extensively on the work of earlier national organisations as well as the consolidated experience of the many Italian scientists that had been investigating space and astronautics since the end of the 19th century. Some of the most outstanding names in Italian space exploration since its inception were the following: * Giulio Costanzi (1875‚Äì1965), his 1914 writing of space navigation and nuclear propulsion are considered the first Italian contribution to astronautics. * Luigi Gussalli (1885‚Äì1950), astronautics pioneer since the ‚Äò20s, corresponded with international space scientists such as Oberth and Goddard. He invented a double-reaction jet engine, developed multi-stage rockets, suggested a Moon mission and solar radiation powered spaceships. * Gaetano Arturo Crocco (1877-1968), aeronautics and astronautics pioneer, invented the first all- Italian liquid-fuelled combustion chamber and aided in the development of the gravity assist technique for use on planetary fly-by‚Äôs by space probes. * Luigi Crocco (1909-1986), son of Gaetano Arturo, an internationally renowned scientist in aerodynamics theory and jet propulsion. * Aurelio Robotti, expert on rocket liquid fuels, father of the first Italian liquid-fuelled rocket, AR3. * Luigi Broglio (1911-2001), the unanimously recognized father of Italian astronautics, sometimes referred to as the ‚ÄúItalian von Braun‚Äù. Under his guide Italy built and operated a satellite in orbit around the Earth and became the first country to deploy an equatorial launching pad, the San Marco, and to experiment successful launching from it.Luigi Broglio * Carlo Buongiorno, Broglio's pupil and the first director general of ASI.  San Marco programme  Early Italian space efforts during the Space Race era were built around cooperation between the Italian Space Commission (a branch of the National Research Council) and NASA supported primarily by the Centro Ricerche Aerospaziali, the aerospace research group of the University of Rome La Sapienza. This plan, conceived by Luigi Broglio, led to the San Marco programme of Italian-built satellites beginning with the launch of Italy's first satellite, San Marco 1, from Wallops Island. With this launch Italy became the third country in the world to operate its own satellite. The San Marco project since 1967 was focused on the launching of scientific satellites by Scout rockets from a mobile rigid platform located close to the equator. This station, composed of 3 oil platforms and two logistical support boats, was installed off the Kenya coast, close to the town of Malindi. Italy would later launch further satellites in the series (San Marco 2 in 1967, San Marco 3 in 1971, San Marco 4 in 1974 and San Marco D/L in 1988 ) using the American Scout rockets like the original, but from its own spaceport.  Co-operation and consolidation  As one of the earliest countries to be engaged in space exploration, Italy became a founder and key partner in the European Launcher Development Organisation (ELDO) and the European Space Research Organisation (ESRO), established on March 29 and June 14, 1962 respectively. Both of these would later merge to form the European Space Agency on April 30, 1975. Further work would continue under the direction of the National Research Council including the launch of an indigenous telecoms/research satellite called SIRIO-1 in 1977. A planned follow-up mission SIRIO-2 was destroyed in the Ariane 1 L-05 launch failure. During the 1980s it became clear of the need to rationalise and strengthen Italy's position in space research and so the decision was made to create the Italian Space Agency to further coordinate the nation's space activities.  Programmes   Robotic exploration  TSS-1, a tethered satellite, being deployed on STS-46 Vega rocket ASI's first large scientific satellite mission was BeppoSAX, developed in collaboration with the Netherlands and launched in 1996. Named after Giuseppe ‚ÄúBeppo‚Äù Occhialini, an important figure in Italian high-energy physics, the satellite was a mission to study the universe in the X-ray part of the spectrum. Following on from this ASI developed another high-energy astronomical satellite, AGILE for gamma ray astronomy, launched by the Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) in 2007. A particular innovation was the use of a single instrument to measure both Gamma rays and hard X-rays. ASI also has collaborated on many major international space exploration missions including; * Cassini-Huygens, a joint NASA/ESA/ASI mission to the Saturn system launched in 1997. The mission has made many new discoveries and increased understanding of the gas giant's environment, particularly Saturn's varied moons. ASI supplied Cassini's large high-gain antenna and radar package as well as involvement in other instruments. * INTEGRAL, ESA's advanced gamma ray observatory launched in 2002. * Mars Express, the first Western European mission to Mars launched in 2003. Through ASI, Italy provided two important instruments for the mission; MARSIS a radar altimeter and the Planetary Fourier Spectrometer which discovered concentrations of methane in the Martian atmosphere. * Rosetta, an ambitious ESA mission to orbit and for the first time in history land a probe on a comet, 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko, to study it in detail as it enters the inner solar system. This long duration mission was launched in 2004 and arrived at its destination in 2014. Rosetta carries the Italian-built VIRTIS instrument while the Philae Lander's sampling/drilling system, SD2, is another major Italian contribution. * Swift Gamma-Ray Burst Mission, a NASA-led international mission to provide rapid detection of short-lived Gamma-ray Bursts. ASI provides the use of the ground station facility as the San Marco spaceport. * Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter, a NASA mission to Mars launched in 2005. The SHARAD radar was supplied by Italy using experience from MARSIS. * Venus Express, the sister-probe to Mars Express built using the same spacecraft bus and the first Western European mission to Venus. Launched in 2005, ASI contributed a version of VIRTIS spectrometer. * Dawn, a 2007 NASA mission that will study the largest of the Asteroid Belt's objects, the asteroid Vesta and the dwarf planet Ceres. Italy has provided VIR-MS, another evolution of the VIRTIS instrument. * Juno, contributed the Jovian Infrared Auroral Mapper on this mission to planet Jupiter. Italy's space industry has also been involved in many other scientific missions such as SOHO, Cluster II, ISO, XMM-Newton and Planck. The technology experiments TSS-1 and TSS-1R were also conducted in partnership with NASA.  Launcher development  Currently ASI is a partner in the Ariane 5 launcher programme and more recently is the major (65%) backer of the ESA Vega small launcher, capable of putting a payload of 1500 kg to low Earth orbit.  Earth observation  ASI is a participant in many of ESA's programmes in the field of Earth Observation such as ERS-1, ERS-2, ENVISAT, the Meteosat series and the Galileo satellite navigation system. The agency has also collaborated with other European and international partners such as the Shuttle Radar Topography Mission with NASA. In October 1992 NASA launched LAGEOS-2 (following LAGEOS-1 launched in 1976) in cooperation with ASI. A passive satellite, it is a sphere of aluminium covered with retroreflectors to reflect laser ranging beams emitted from ground stations on Earth. The primary mission goals were to determine accurately Earth's Geoid and to measure Tectonic plate movement. In 2010 ASI's own satellite, LARES, will be launched using the Vega rocket. The mission is designed to carry out similar studies to that of LAGEOS 2 but with much greater precision. The Italian Space Agency, under direction of both the Ministry of Research and the Ministry of Defence, developed the COSMO-SkyMed constellation of satellites for both military and civilian use in a broad range of areas.  Human spaceflight  Raffaello, upper left, docked with the International Space Station during STS-114 Through ASI, the Italian space industry is an active player in human spaceflight activities. The three Shuttle MPLM cargo containers Leonardo, Raffaello and Donatello, were manufactured at the Cannes Mandelieu Space Center in Turin, Italy by Alcatel Alenia Space, now Thales Alenia Space. They provide a key function in storing equipment and parts for transfer to the International Space Station. A number of ISS modules have also been made in Italy. As part of ESA's contribution to the costs of the International Space Station, Alcatel Alenia Space manufactured Tranquility, Harmony as well as the Cupola observation deck for NASA. ESA's Columbus module, Western Europe's primary scientific lab on board the ISS, was again built in Turin based on Italy's previous experience in space station module construction.  Italian astronauts  Harmony, itself manufactured in Italy on contract, was accompanied by Nespoli who acted as mission specialist. It is shown here being moved to its final docking port later the same year As an ESA member heavily involved in human spaceflight, ASI sponsors a select few Italian citizens to train at ESA's European Astronaut Corps (EAC) to represent the country on missions. Italians to have flown in space are: * Franco Malerba, Italy's first astronaut and the only one not to fly as a member of the EAC. He flew on STS-46 (July 31 to August 7, 1992) as payload specialist on the first Tethered Satellite System mission. * Umberto Guidoni, flew on STS-75 (February 22 to March 9, 1996) as payload specialist on the second Tethered Satellite System mission - TSS-1R. He became the first Italian and European on the International Space Station during STS-100 (April 19 to May 1, 2001). * Maurizio Cheli, flew with Umberto Guidoni as a mission specialist on STS-75. * Roberto Vittori, has flown on multiple missions to the ISS: Soyuz TM-33, Soyuz TM-34, Soyuz TMA-5, Soyuz TMA-6 and STS-134. * Paolo A. Nespoli, flew on STS-120 (October 23 to November 7, 2007),; he then returned two more times on the ISS: one for the long duration MagISStra mission (Expedition 26/27, from December 15, 2010, to May 23, 2011) aboard the Soyuz TMA-20 and the other for the Vita mission (Expedition 52/53) * Luca Parmitano, selected in February 2009, flew aboard Soyuz TMA-09M on 28 May 2013, arriving at the International Space Station the following day. He returned to earth on 11 November 2013. He is scheduled to return to the ISS on board the Soyuz MS-13 mission in July 2019, he will serve as Flight Engineer on Expedition 60 and Commander on Expedition 61. * Samantha Cristoforetti, also selected in 2009, flew to the International Space Station aboard Soyuz TMA-15M on November 23, 2014. Her original return date was delayed by one month after the failure of two Russian rockets extended her stay in space past the European astronaut and female astronaut endurance records. Her return to Earth, on June 11, 2015, concluded her 199d 16h 42m in space.

The dam's purpose includes flood mitigation, hydro-power, irrigation, water supply and conservation. The impounded reservoir is called Lake Keepit. Location and features Commenced in 1939, with construction halted during World War II, and completed in 1960, the Keepit Dam is a major dam on the Namoi River, located approximately west of Tamworth and north-east of Gunnedah, upstream of the confluence of the Namoi and Peel rivers. The dam was built by the New South Wales Water Conservation & Irrigation Commission to supply water for irrigation, flood mitigation and potable water for the town of Walgett. The dam wall height is and is long. The maximum water depth is and at 100% capacity the dam wall holds back of water at AHD. The surface area of Lake Keepit is and the catchment area is . The central gated overflow crest and six radial gates of the spillway are capable of discharging . An 146.6 million upgrade of facilities commenced in 2009 and resulted in the construction of two spillways and three saddle dams, completed during 2011. A further upgrade is due to commence in 2014 for completion by 2016 that will involve raising the height of the main dam wall by and enhancing post tension in the concrete section of the wall. Keepit Dam is operated in conjunction with Split Rock Dam. The two dams supply water requirements along much of the Namoi Valley, used for irrigation including cotton, cereal and wheat crops, lucerne, fodder and pasture, vegetables, vines, orchards and oil seeds. Power generation A hydro-electric power station generates up to of electricity from the flow of the water leaving Keepit Dam with an average output of per annum. The station was completed in 1960 and upgraded in 1983. The facility is managed by Eraring Energy. Etymology The name Keepit originates after a riverside property called Keypit or Keepit, resumed for part of the storage area. The word probably means 'keep it', a derogatory remark about the apparent worthlessness of the pastoral run. Recreation The area surrounding Lake Keepit is used for local recreation including camping, picnics, swimming, boating, sailing, water skiing and fishing. The lakeshore is the location of Lake Keepit Soaring Club, the second largest gliding club by membership in Australia.

The largest enclosed shopping mall in Mississippi,http://www.metro- marketplace.com/overview.php it is composed of 1,250,000 square feet of retail space on two levels, including four anchor spaces. Regional real estate developer Jim Wilson & Associates built the mall in Mississippi's capital city in 1978, as one of its portfolio of properties throughout the southeastern United States. Key tenants as of 2014 include one of two Burlington Coat Factory stores in the state, and offices of the City of Jackson. The mall is located near the junction of Interstates 20 and 220, along South Jackson's U.S. Highway 80 corridor. After years of ownership by Cannon Management and Jackson Metrocenter Limited, a decade-long decline at the mall led to a foreclosure in November 2012, and subsequent sale to Metrocenter Mall, LLC. History When Metrocenter opened March 1, 1978https://www.newspapers.com/image/16986505/?terms=homart%2B%2B%2Bfriendswood, it was considered to be the largest mall in Mississippi with over 100 services and stores on two levels. The mall opened with three anchor department stores, Jackson-based McRae's, Alabama-based Gayfers, and national retailer Sears. New Orleans-based D.H. Holmes was added as the fourth department store anchor in May 1979. Restaurants were inside two of the department stores ‚Äî Potpourri Restaurant inside D.H. Holmes, and Widow Watson's inside McRae's. Metrocenter also had a Service Merchandise, a specialty outlet of the Jackson-based Jitney-Jungle supermarket chain, and Mississippi's only General Cinema theater as outparcels, and took away most of the business of Jackson Mall, which opened in 1969 with JCPenney, Gayfers, and Woolco as its anchors, in North Jackson. Metrocenter continued to enjoy success after Northpark Mall opened north of the county line in Ridgeland in 1984. Former anchors D.H. Holmes was acquired by and converted to Arkansas-based Dillard's in 1989, bringing with it the closure of the Potpourri Restaurant. A decade later, Dillard's acquired Gayfers by way of a buyout of its parent Mercantile Stores in 1999. McRae's was sold in 2006, and its Metrocenter store rebranded to Belk that year. Sears was the only original anchor to remain until its closure. Decline and closure Metrocenter began to decline in 1999, when the first of the mall's anchor department stores closed. Dillard's, which had acquired two of the mall's anchor spaces by 1999, continued to operate in the former D.H. Holmes space while closing the Gayfer's space. Dillard's remained in the mall until 2006, leaving two active department store anchors at Metrocenter. Within the same year, one of those anchors ‚Äî McRae's ‚Äî was sold to Belk, which assumed the anchor and rebranded the store's restaurant as Brittyanna's. A steady pattern of vacancies continued until August 2007, when Burlington Coat Factory opened in the first level of the former Gayfers property to great fanfare, drawing patrons from more than 90 miles away. Statistics show traffic had increased at Metrocenter by as much as 3,000 cars per day. Despite the addition, demographics in the Jackson metropolitan area and the dangers of South Jackson contributed to substantial vacancies. By June 2009, Belk announced its intent to close the company's Metrocenter's location in August, in order to focus on suburban properties at Ridgeland's Northpark Mall, and Dogwood Festival Market & Promenade in Flowood. The year's end brought a 6‚Äì1 vote during a December 2009 meeting of Jackson's city council, to purchase the former D.H. Holmes/Dillard's property for $39,500, in hopes of spurring a revitalization of South Jackson. The former McRae's/Belk property was sold in July 2010 to Retro Metro, LLC, with plans to divide the one-time anchor between offices for the City of Jackson on the first level, and a mixed-use redevelopment in the second level that included offices, restaurants, and retail space. Watkins Partners, a Jackson-area real estate developer, announced intentions to move forward with Project Retro Metro in December 2010 and started with its mixed-use redevelopment in January 2011. David Watkins, president of Watkins Partners, said, \\"Metrocenter has plummeted.\\" Despite many efforts to redevelop Metrocenter, Sears Holdings announced in late December 2011 that over 100 of its Kmart and Sears properties would close, including the Sears store at Metrocenter. The last of the mall's department store anchors, Sears closed in 2012. Presently the only uses of the mall are the Burlington store, City offices, and scattered small outlets around the center court. Special events are still held in the center court as well. In August 2018, Metrocenter closed its doors though Burlington and parts of the building that hold city offices remain open.End of an era: Metrocenter Mall closes See also *Outlets of Mississippi *Northpark Mall (Mississippi) References External links * Metrocenter Mall official website * Metro Marketplace official website Shopping malls established in 1978 Shopping malls disestablished in 2018 Shopping malls in Mississippi Buildings and structures in Jackson, Mississippi Tourist attractions in Jackson, Mississippi 1978 establishments in Mississippi 2018 disestablishments in Mississippi ","title":"Metrocenter Mall (Jackson, Mississippi)"},{"id":"716991","text":"The Namoi River, a major perennial river that is part of the Barwon catchment of the Murray‚ÄìDarling basin, is located in the Northern Tablelands and North West Slopes districts of New South Wales, Australia. The Namoi River rises on the western slopes of the Moonbi Range and Great Dividing Range, near Niangala, at the convergence of the Macdonald River and Boundary Creek, and flows generally west, joined by twenty-seven tributaries, including the Peel, Manilla and Mooki rivers, before reaching its confluence with the Barwon River, near Walgett. The Namoi River descends over its course; passing near the towns of Gunnedah, Boggabri, Narrabri, Wee Waa and Walgett. The flow of the river is impounded by Lake Keepit and Baraneal Lagoon.  Course  Cuttabri. Manilla. The headwaters of the Namoi, including the Macdonald River, the Peel River, the Cockburn River and the Manilla River, rise on the western slopes of the Great Dividing Range on the Northern Tablelands. Other smaller tributaries include Cobrabald River, Coxs Creek, Maules Creek, Mooki River and Bundock Creek. It rises east of Niangala and flows generally north west after its confluence with its major tributary, the Cobrabald River, then passes through the villages of Woolbrook and Bendemeer. It continues to flow westward to where it changes name to the Namoi River at Boundary Creek just east of where the river enters Warrabah National Park. The Namoi flows past Manilla, where it is joined by the Manilla River. After passing into Keepit Dam it is joined by the Peel River before passing by Carroll, then joined by the Mooki River near Gunnedah on the Liverpool Plains. From here it flows north-westwards past Boggabri, Narrabri, Wee Waa and Burren Junction and eventually joins the Barwon River, near the town of Walgett. Keepit Dam near Gunnedah is an important dam for flood control and irrigation. The floodplains of the lower Namoi around Wee Waa are an important area for growing cotton which is irrigated using water from the dam. History The traditional custodians of the land surrounding the Namoi River are the Aboriginal people of the Kamilaroi nation. The word namoi or nammoy is believed to be the native name for a species of acacia; and ngamu is a Gamilaraay word for \\"breast\\". Alternative meanings of the name include Aboriginal words for \\"forked stick\\" and \\"meeting of the waters\\". Allan Cunningham, a botanist-explorer, in 1827 became the first European to explore the Namoi River. Cunningham named this river \\"Mitchell\\" in honour of a surgeon in Sydney who was dismissed from Government Service because he refused to attend the flogging of a convict at Hyde Park barracks. The Namoi River Road Bridge, which was built at Manilla in 1886, has been placed on the Register of the National Estate. This bridge has eleven metal lattice truss spans and is one of the longest six or seven metal truss bridges completed in Australia by that time.  Fauna  The Namoi supports a wide range of fish and crustaceans, which include Murray cod, yellowbelly, silver perch, catfish (Tandanus tandanus) as well as yabbies (Cherax destructor). \\"Crawbob\\" is a regional name and may be called a \\"yabby\\" elsewhere in the state. Murray cod in the Namoi grow to a very large size, with fish of forty kilograms or larger being not uncommon. European carp and extensive irrigation practices have had adverse impact on the native fish population over the last forty years, and restocking programs have been undertaken, mainly by volunteers, to ensure the survival of the native fish population. The Namoi River snapping turtle or Bell's turtle (Elseya belli) is a species of turtle found only in the upper reaches of the Namoi River, Gwydir and Macdonald rivers on the North West Slopes. The platypus (Ornithorhynchus anatinus) is found in this river and can often be seen around Warrabah National Park, east of Manilla.

In IEEE 802.11 wireless local area networking standards (including Wi-Fi), a service set (also known as extended service set or ESS) is a group of wireless network devices which are identified by the same SSID (service set identifier). SSIDs serve as \\"network names\\" and are typically natural language labels. A service set forms a logical network -- that is operating with the same level 2 networking parameters -- they are on the same logical network segment (e.g., IP subnet or VLAN). Basic service sets (BSS) are a subgroup of devices within a service set which are additionally also operating with the same physical layer medium access characteristics (i.e. radio frequency, modulation scheme, security settings etc.) such that they are wirelessly networked. Devices within basic service sets are identified by BSSIDs (basic service set identifiers), which are 48-bit labels that conform to MAC-48 conventions. While devices may have multiple BSSIDs, usually each BSSID is associated with at most one basic service set at a time. There are two classes of basic service sets: those that are formed by an infrastructure mode redistribution point (access points or mesh nodes), and those that are formed by independent stations in a peer-to-peer ad hoc topology (an Independent Basic Service Set or IBSS.) A basic service set should not to be confused with the coverage area of an access point, known as the 'basic service area' (BSA). Basic service sets (BSSs) Infrastructure mode An infrastructure mode wireless network basic service set (BSS) consists of one redistribution point typically an access point (WAP or AP) together with one or more \\"client\\" stations that are associated with (i.e. connected to) that redistribution point. The operating parameters of the infrastructure-BSS are defined by the redistribution point. Stations communicate only with the redistribution point that they are associated with, and all traffic within the infrastructure-BSS is routed through/bridged by that redistribution point. Each basic service set has its own unique identifier, a BSSID, which is a unique 48-bit identifier that follows MAC address conventions. An infrastructure-BSSID is usually non-configurable, in which case it is either preset during manufacture, or mathematically derived from a preset value such as a serial number, the MAC address of the LAN connection, etc. As with the MAC addresses used for Ethernet devices, infrastructure-BSSIDs are a combination of a 24-bit Organization Unique Identifier (OUI, the manufacturer's identity) and a 24-bit serial number. A BSSID with a value of all 1s is used to indicate the wildcard BSSID, usable only during probe requests or for communications that take place outside the context of a BSS. Mesh basic service set From the point of view of a wireless clients, IEEE 802.11s wireless mesh networks appear as a conventional infrastructure mode topology, and are centrally configured as such. The formation of the mesh's BSS, as well as wireless traffic management (including path selection and forwarding) is negotiated between the nodes (redistribution points) of the mesh infrastructure. The mesh's BSS is distinct from the networks (which may also be wireless) used by a mesh's redistribution points to communicate with one another. Ad hoc In contrast to the stations in an infrastructure- mode network, the stations in a wireless ad hoc network communicate directly with one another, i.e. without a dependence on a distribution point to relay traffic between them. In this form of peer-to-peer wireless networking, the peers form an independent basic service set (IBSS). Some of the responsibilities of a distribution point such as defining network parameters and other \\"beaconing\\" functions are established by the first station in an ad- hoc network. But that station does not relay traffic between the other stations; instead, the peers communicate directly with one another. Like infrastructure-BSSs, independent-BSSs also have a 48-bit MAC address-like identifier. But unlike infrastructure-BSS identifiers, independent-BSSs identifiers are not necessarily unique: the individual/group bit of the address is always set to 0 (individual), the universal/local bit of the address is always set to 1 (local), and the remaining 46 bits are randomly generated. Service set ID (WiFi) The SSID is broadcast by stations in beacon packets to announce the presence of a network. Unlike basic service set identifiers, SSIDs are usually customizable. These SSIDs can be zero to 32 octets (32 bytes) long, and are, for convenience, usually in a natural language, such as English. The 802.11 standards prior to the 2012 edition did not define any particular encoding/representation for SSIDs, which were expected to be treated and handled as an arbitrary sequence of 032 octets that are not limited to printable characters. The IEEE 802.11-2012 defines a tag that the SSID is UTF-8 encoded and when interpreting could contain any non-ISO basic Latin characters within it. Wireless network stacks must still be prepared to handle arbitrary values in the SSID field. Since the contents of an SSID field are arbitrary, the 802.11 standard permits devices to advertise the presence of a wireless network with beacon packets in which the SSID field is set to null. A null SSID (the SSID element's 'length' field is set to zero) is called a \\"wildcard SSID\\" in IEEE 802.11 standards documents, and as a \\"no broadcast SSID\\" or \\"hidden SSID\\" in the context of beacon announcements, and can be used, for example, in enterprise and mesh networks to steer a client to a particular (e.g. less utilized) access point. A station may also likewise transmit packets in which the SSID field is set to null; this prompts an associated access point to send the station a list of supported SSIDs. Once a device has associated with a basic service set, for efficiency, the SSID is not sent within packet headers; only BSSIDs are used for addressing. Extended service sets (ESSs) Formally, there is no distinct ESSID in the 802.11 standards. In 802.11 standard documents, the logical network (ESS or independent-BSS) service set identifier is simply abbreviated SSID, irrespective of whether an SSID identifies an infrastructure-BSS's ESS, or the peer-to-peer network of an independent-BSS. An extended service set (ESS) is a set of one or more infrastructure basic service sets on a common logical network segment (i.e. same IP subnet and VLAN). Key to the concept is that the participating basic service sets appear as a single network to the logical link control layer. Thus, from the perspective of the logical link control layer, stations within an ESS may communicate with one another, and mobile stations may move transparently from one participating BSS to another (within the same ESS). Extended service sets make possible distribution services such as centralized authentication and seamless roaming between infrastructure- BSSs. From the perspective of the link layer, all stations within an ESS are all on the same link, and transfer from one BSS to another is transparent to logical link control. The basic service sets formed in wireless ad hoc networks are, by definition, independent from other BSSs, and an independent- BSS cannot therefore be part of an extended infrastructure. In that formal sense an independent-BSS has no extended service set. However, the network packets of both independent-BSSs and infrastructure-BSSs have a logical network service set identifier, and the logical link control does not distinguish between the use of that field to name an ESS network, and the use of that field to name a peer-to-peer ad hoc network. The two are effectively indistinguishable at the logical link control layer level. Notes References Works cited *. * . *. * . * . * . * .

The lake adjoins the smaller Lake Albert; together they are known as the Lower Lakes.Name used by the Australian Government, see Nomenclature Aboriginal naming Aboriginal people having an association with the lake were reported as knowing it by such names as [Mungkuli, Parnka and Kayinga. European naming English settlers named the lake after Princess Alexandrina, niece and successor of King William IV of Great Britain and Ireland. When the princess ascended the throne and took the name Queen Victoria, there was some talk of changing the name of the lake to Lake Victoria, but the idea was dropped. Description Lake Alexandrina is located north of Encounter Bay and east of Fleurieu Peninsula within what are now the two following South Australian government regions: Fleurieu and Kangaroo Island region, and the Murray Mallee region. The Murray River is the major river to flow into Lake Alexandrina. Others include the Bremer, Angas, and Finniss rivers, all from the eastern side of the southern Mount Lofty Ranges. The lake is shallow and contains a number of islands near the southern end. Loveday Bay is an inlet located at the south-east of Lake Alexandrina, adjacent to Tauwitchere Channel. Lake Alexandrina is connected by a narrow channel to the smaller Lake Albert to the south-east. The lake empties into the Southern Ocean via a channel known as the Murray Mouth, south-east of the town of Goolwa, but when the river flow is low, the mouth is often blocked by a sand-bar. Originally subjected to tidal and storm inflows of seawater, the lake is now maintained as a fresh water one by a series of barrages known as the Goolwa Barrages; these cross five channels between the mainland and three islands near the Murray Mouth. Though the lake has been historically connected to the ocean, the fresh and salt water flows mixed very little, with the lake area remaining fresh over 95% of the time with normal river inflow. Salt water inflows from the ocean would result in relatively little mixing of fresh and salt water, either vertically in the water column or laterally across the flow stream. An 2020 review of hundreds scientific studies relating to the Coorong, Lower Lakes and Murray Mouth has found that it was a freshwater ecosystem prior to European settlement of South Australia. Hindmarsh Island is reputed to be the largest island in the world with salt water on one side and fresh water on the other. History In Aboriginal mythology known as Dreamtime, the lake was inhabited by a monster known as the Muldjewangk. Edward Wilson, visiting the lake in the 1850s described it as follows: > \\"Lake Alexandrina is the finest sheet of fresh water I ever saw. Indeed so > formidable did it look, with a stiff wind blowing up quite a sufficient > swell to make one seasick, that I could scarcely believe it to be fresh. > Such is the fact however. It is forty or fifty miles long by twelve or > fifteen wide and the shores around it receded into the dim distance until > they become invisible, in the way which we are accustomed only with ideas of > salt water. Supplied almost entirely by the Murray, the whole lake retains > the muddy tinge of which I have spoken, and this sadly detracts from the > otherwise beautiful appearances of this magnificent sheet of water.\\" In 2008, water levels in Lake Alexandrina and Lake Albert became so low that there was a high risk of large quantities of acid sulphate soils forming. The soils on the lake beds are naturally rich in iron sulphides. When exposed to the air, such as may occur in a time of severe drought, the sulphides oxidise, producing sulphuric acid. The barrages now prevent the seawater inflows that had formerly prevented this phenomenon in every drought since the last ice age. A weir was proposed near Pomanda Point where the river entered the lake, in order to protect upriver and Adelaide's water supplies should it become necessary to open the barrages, but this plan was dropped by the South Australian government after a campaign by the River, Lakes and Coorong Action Group highlighted the many environmental problems such a weir would cause. Environment Turtles live in the lake, with lizards and snakes being present along the shoreline. Insect species include dragonflies, a range of moths and butterflies, and large numbers of beetles (coleoptera). Freshwater fish inhabit the lake, including the introduced European carp. The soils around the lake are relatively low in organic carbon, although good barley and vegetable crops may be produced. Non-wetting soils are present along the south eastern bounds of Lake Albert and in areas around Lake Alexandrina. The area is important for Australian shelducks Birds The lake is a habitat for many species of waterbird, including migratory waders, or shorebirds, which breed in northern Asia and Alaska. Species supported by the lake include the critically endangered orange-bellied parrots, endangered Australasian bitterns, vulnerable fairy terns, as well as over 1% of the world populations of Cape Barren geese, Australian shelducks, great cormorants and sharp-tailed sandpipers. Protected area status Australian government Lake Alexandrina is part of the wetland complex known as the Coorong and Lakes Alexandrina and Albert Wetland which is listed as a Ramsar site. The wetland is also appears in the non-statutory list known as A Directory of Important Wetlands in Australia. South Australian government Lake Alexandrina includes the following protected areas declared under the National Parks and Wildlife Act 1972 - Currency Creek Game Reserve, Mud Islands Game Reserve, Salt Lagoon Islands Conservation Park and Tolderol Game Reserve.

It is located less than 100 km south-east of Adelaide. It is located on the cliffs above the east (left) bank of the Murray River close to where the river empties into Lake Alexandrina.  First people - Ngarrindjeri inhabitants  Prior to European settlement the area was inhabited by the Ngarrindjeri people. They made bark and reed canoes, and lived on the fish and animals residing beside the river. Once written as \\"Tail'em Bend\\", the origin of the town's name is still argued over. Some attribute it to a corruption of the Ngarrindjeri word \\"thelim\\" meaning \\"bend\\", associated with the sharp bend that the Murray River makes in this location. Others yet say that original Ngarrindjeri inhabitants called this part of the river ‚ÄòThelum Ki‚Äô which means bent water.  European settlement  In 1884 while building the railway line to the eastern state of Victoria, the track laying gang set up camp amongst some native pine trees and naming that particular site ‚ÄòPine Camp‚Äô from then on the local township began to grow. The town was proclaimed in 1887, the year after the railway opened for traffic. At the 2016 census, Tailem Bend had a population of 1,665.

The last two branches were the Pinnaroo railway line and the Loxton railway line via Karoonda.Mid North & Murray Mallee map SA Track & Signal The Loxton line was originally one of five branch lines from the Barmera railway line and was the last to remain in service. It was the only branch to be converted to standard gauge (along with the separate Pinnaroo line) when the main line was converted from broad gauge, however they remained as light rail and ballast with low speed limits. They were only used for collection of bulk grain, as the speed limits are too low to be practical for transport of time-sensitive freight. Both closed in July 2015.Freight Study & Rail Operations Investigation Flywheel Advisory 17 November 2014 The Pinnaroo line continues as the original broad gauge into Victoria to Ouyen where it joins the Mildura to Melbourne line. As the South Australian line closed, the Victorian government was upgrading its end of the line for regional freight. Tailem Bend station was once a significant junction station for passenger trains on the Mallee lines, and home to a locomotive depot.  Highways  Tailem Bend is on the Princes Highway 20 km from the end of the South Eastern Freeway to Adelaide. From Tailem Bend, there is a choice of the Dukes Highway as the direct route to Melbourne, the Princes Highway along the Coorong and coast towards Melbourne, or the Mallee Highway east towards Sydney. There is also a road connecting to the Karoonda Highway leading to Loxton and the Riverland. Tailem Bend is a common stopping point for truck drivers travelling to and/or from Adelaide, as there are no fuel or food outlets with truck facilities on the South Eastern Freeway.

The Myall Lakes are adjacent to the east coast, about north of Sydney. Features and location There are three Myall Lakes, called Myall Lake, Boolambayte Lake and The Broadwater. When full, Myall Lake covers an area of around ; Boolambayte Lake covers an area of around ; and Bombah Broadwater covers an area of around . Smiths Lake is close to the northern Myall Lake, but is not connected nor formally part of the Myall Lakes. The lakes are partially interconnected and navigable by small craft. The Myall River flows into the western side of The Broadwater. The Myall River also flows out of The Broadwater and meanders southwest where it empties into Port Stephens between the towns of Tea Gardens and Hawks Nest. The lower Myall River progressively becomes saltier and more tidal as it flows southwards. Most of the Myall Lakes are surrounded by the Myall Lakes National Park. The NSW National Parks & Wildlife Service operate a car ferry across the lake at Bombah Point. The area between the lakes and the sea is mainly uninhabited coastal woodlands and long isolated beaches although some of it was mined for heavy mineral sands before the 1970s. The village of Bungwahl is located on the northern shore of Myall Lake. There are a number of small islands in the lakes. At the northern end of Myall Lake lies Mayers Point. This was the centre of a timber industry established by Allen Taylor and Company Limited. To assist in the transport of the logs from the forests to the lake, an extensive light railway system was constructed. Due to the nature of Myall Lakes being coastal dune lakes, or coastal lagoons, they were featured in an American documentary about conservation done by producer Elam Stoltzfus.

Content distributors syndicate a web feed, thereby allowing users to subscribe a channel to it by adding the feed resource address to a news aggregator client (also called a feed reader or a news reader). Users typically subscribe to a feed by manually entering the URL of a feed or clicking a link in a web browser or by dragging the link from the web browser to the aggregator, thus \\"RSS and Atom files provide news updates from a website in a simple form for your computer.\\"Blogspace \\"RSS readers (RSS info)\\" The kinds of content delivered by a web feed are typically HTML (webpage content) or links to webpages and other kinds of digital media. Often when websites provide web feeds to notify users of content updates, they only include summaries in the web feed rather than the full content itself. Many news websites, weblogs, schools, and podcasters operate web feeds. As web feeds are designed to be machine-readable rather than human-readable they can also be used to automatically transfer information from one website to another without any human intervention. Technical definition A web feed is a document (often XML-based) whose discrete content items include web links to the source of the content. News websites and blogs are common sources for web feeds, but feeds are also used to deliver structured information ranging from weather data to search results. Common web feed formats are: * Atom * JSON Feed * RSS Although RSS formats have evolved since March 1999, the RSS icon (\\"16px\\") first gained widespread use between 2005 and 2006. The feed icon indicates that a web feed is available. The original icon was created by Stephen Horlander, a designer at Mozilla. With the prevalence of JSON in Web APIs, a further format, JSON Feed, was defined in 2017. History Dave Winer published a modified version of the RSS 0.91 specification on the UserLand website, covering how it was being used in his company's products, and claimed copyright to the document. A few months later, UserLand filed a U.S. trademark registration for RSS, but failed to respond to a USPTO trademark examiner's request and the request was rejected in December 2001. The RSS-DEV Working Group, a project whose members included Guha and representatives of O'Reilly Media and Moreover, produced RSS 1.0 in December 2000. This new version, which reclaimed the name RDF Site Summary from RSS 0.9, reintroduced support for RDF and added XML namespaces support, adopting elements from standard metadata vocabularies such as Dublin Core. In December 2000, Winer released RSS 0.92 a minor set of changes aside from the introduction of the enclosure element, which permitted audio files to be carried in RSS feeds and helped spark podcasting. He also released drafts of RSS 0.93 and RSS 0.94 that were subsequently withdrawn. In September 2002, Winer released a major new version of the format, RSS 2.0, that redubbed its initials Really Simple Syndication. RSS 2.0 removed the type attribute added in the RSS 0.94 draft and added support for namespaces. Because neither Winer nor the RSS-DEV Working Group had Netscape's involvement, they could not make an official claim on the RSS name or format. This has fueled ongoing controversy in the syndication development community as to which entity was the proper publisher of RSS. One product of that contentious debate was the creation of an alternative syndication format, Atom, that began in June 2003. The Atom syndication format, whose creation was in part motivated by a desire to get a clean start free of the issues surrounding RSS, has been adopted as . In July 2003, Winer and UserLand Software assigned the copyright of the RSS 2.0 specification to Harvard's Berkman Center for Internet & Society, where he had just begun a term as a visiting fellow. At the same time, Winer launched the RSS Advisory Board with Brent Simmons and Jon Udell, a group whose purpose was to maintain and publish the specification and answer questions about the format. In December 2005, the Microsoft Internet Explorer teamIcons: It‚Äôs still orange, Microsoft RSS Blog, December 14, 2005 and Outlook teamRSS icon goodness, blog post by Michael A. Affronti of Microsoft (Outlook Program Manager), December 15, 2005 announced on their blogs that they were adopting the feed icon first used in the Mozilla Firefox browser 16px, created by Stephen Horlander, a Mozilla Designer. A few months later, Opera Software followed suit. This effectively made the orange square with white radio waves the industry standard for RSS and Atom feeds, replacing the large variety of icons and text that had been used previously to identify syndication data. In January 2006, Rogers Cadenhead relaunched the RSS Advisory Board without Dave Winer's participation, with a stated desire to continue the development of the RSS format and resolve ambiguities. In June 2007, the board revised their version of the specification to confirm that namespaces may extend core elements with namespace attributes, as Microsoft has done in Internet Explorer 7. According to their view, a difference of interpretation left publishers unsure of whether this was permitted or forbidden. Comparison to email subscriptions Web feeds have some advantages compared to receiving frequently published content via an email: * Users do not disclose their email address when subscribing to a feed and so are not increasing their exposure to threats associated with email: spam, viruses, phishing, and identity theft. * Users do not have to send an unsubscribe request to stop receiving news. They simply remove the feed from their aggregator. * The feed items are automatically sorted in that each feed URL has its own sets of entries (unlike an email box where messages must be sorted by user-defined rules and pattern matching).

Traditional Arab genealogy A family tree of the Qahtanites Arab tradition maintains that a semi-legendary ancestral figure named Qahtan and his 24 sons are the progenitors of Yemen who controlled the Arabian Peninsula known as Qahtani. Early Islamic historians identified Qahtan with the Yoqtan (Joktan) son of Eber (H≈´d) in the Hebrew Bible (Gen. 10:25-29). James A. Montgomery finds it difficult to believe that Qahtan was the biblical Joktan based on etymology. Among the sons of Qahtan are noteworthy figures like A'zaal (believed by Arabs to have been the original name of Sana'a), Hadhramaut and Jurhum whose descendants formed the second Jurhum tribe which Ishmael learned Arabic from. Another son is Ya'rub, and his son Yashjub is the father of Saba'. All Yemeni tribes trace their ancestry back to this \\"Saba\\", either through Himyar or Kahlan, his two sons. The Qahtani people are divided into the two sub-groups of Himyar and Kahlan, who represent the settled Arabs of the south and their nomadic kinsmen (nomads). The Kahlan division of Qahtan consists of 4 subgroups: the Ta' or Tayy, the Azd group which invaded Oman, the 'Amila-Judham group of Palestine, and the Hamdan-Madhhij group who mostly remain in Yemen. The Kahlan branch includes the following tribes: Azd (Aus and Khazraj, Bariq, Ghassan, Khuza'a and Daws), Hamdan, Khath'am, Bajila, Madhhij, Murad, Zubaid, Ash'ar, Lakhm, Tayy (Shammar), and Kindah.

Early linguistic connection  The first groups of Semitic speakers that moved northward already developed the early Semitic names derived from triliteral, and sometimes a quadriliteral verb root. These appellations first appeared in early (now extinct) East Semitic languages, especially Akkadian, Assyrian, and Old Babylonian. A closer examination reveals connections with the Central Semitic language family including: Aramaic, Phoenician, Hebrew, and Nabatean, which is closely related to the Southern Semitic languages Minaean, Sabaean, Qatabanian, Awsanian, Hadhrami, and Himyarite.  Pre-Islamic Qahtani migration out of Arabia  Early Semites who developed civilizations throughout the Ancient Near East gradually relinquished their geopolitical superiority to surrounding cultures and neighboring imperial powers, usually due to either internal turmoil or outside conflict. This climaxed with the arrival of the Chaldeans, and subsequently the rivaling Medes and Persians, during the 7th and 6th centuries BCE respectively. Though the Semites lost geopolitical influence, the Aramaic language emerged as the lingua franca of much of the Near East. However, Aramaic usage declined after the defeat of the Persians and the arrival of the Hellenic armies around 330 BCE. The Ghassanids (ca. 250 CE) were the last major non-Islamic Semitic migration northward out of Yemen. They revived the Semitic presence in the then Roman-controlled Syria. They initially settled in the Hauran region, eventually spreading to modern Lebanon, Palestine and Jordan, briefly securing governorship of Syria away from the Nabataeans. Modern historiography According to Webb, the Qahtanite geneology was likely invented during the early Abbasid period. Qahtan is not cited as an ancestral figure in any pre-Islamic South Arabian records. The name 'q·∏•·π≠n' is only seen in two pre-Islamic inscriptions signifying a minor group connected to the kingdom of Kindah. According to Parolin, the Adnanites are believed to be the descendants of Ishmael through Adnan but the traditional Adnanite lineage doesn't match the biblical line exactly. According to Arab tradition, the Adnanite are called Arabised because it is believed that Ishmael was speaking Hebrew and he got married from a Qahtanite Yemeni woman and learned Arabic from her. Therefore, the Adnanites are considered descendants of Abraham. However, Parolin disputes that Adnanites are descendants of Abraham and says that Modern historiography \\"unveiled the lack of inner coherence of this genealogical system and demonstrated that it finds insufficient matching evidence\\". \\"The ‚Äòarabicised or arabicising Arabs‚Äô, on the contrary, are believed to be the descendants of Ishmael through Adnan, but in this case the genealogy does not match the Biblical line exactly. The label ‚Äòarabicised‚Äô is due to the belief that Ishmael spoke Hebrew until he got to Mecca, where he married a Yemeni woman and learnt Arabic.

During this period of expansionism, the Arabs, including Qahtanite tribes, overspread these lands, intermingling with local native populations while yet maintaining their cultural identity. Although you can find the largest number of Qahtanite Arabs in Yemen. Among the most famous examples of Qahtanite Arabs are the social scholar Ibn Khaldun who was born in Tunisia to a family that immigrated from Islamic Spain (Al-Andalus). Other notable examples are Al Kindi and Ibn al-Baitar.

Truman (CVN-75), during a wreath-laying ceremony held on the flight deck in memory of a service member killed during a training accident. Missing man formation with smoke The missing man formation is an aerial salute performed as part of a flypast of aircraft at a funeral or memorial event, typically in memory of a fallen pilot, a well-known military service member or veteran, or a well-known political figure.  Description  Several variants of the formation are seen. The formation most commonly used in the United States is based on the \\"finger-four\\" aircraft combat formation composed of two pairs of aircraft. The aircraft fly in a V-shape with the flight leader at the point and their wingman on their left. The second element leader and his wingman fly to their right. The formation flies over the ceremony low enough to be clearly seen and the second element leader abruptly pulls up out of the formation while the rest of the formation continues in level flight until all aircraft are out of sight. In an older variant, the formation is flown with the second element leader position conspicuously empty. In another variation, the flight approaches from the south, preferably near sundown, and one of the aircraft will suddenly split off to the west, flying into the sunset. In all cases, the aircraft performing the pull-up, split off, or missing from the formation is honoring the person (or persons) who has died, and it represents their departure.  Examples U.S. Navy F/A-18 jets fly a Missing Man formation at a memorial service for astronaut Neil Armstrong on 31 August 2012. In 1936, King George V received the first recorded flypast for a non-RAF funeral. The United States adopted the tradition in 1938 during the funeral for Major General Oscar Westover with over 50 aircraft and one blank file. By the end of World War II, the missing man formation had evolved to include the pull-up. In April 1954, United States Air Force General Hoyt Vandenberg was buried at Arlington National Cemetery without the traditional horse-drawn artillery caisson. Instead, Vandenberg was honored by a flyover of jet aircraft with one plane missing from the formation. On November 26, 1999, four Air Force F-16s flew the missing man formation over Kyle Field to honor the 12 Texas A&M; students who died during the Aggie Bonfire collapse. The Delaware Air National Guard flew the missing man formation over the Dover International Speedway on June 3, 2001 to honor NASCAR driver Dale Earnhardt Sr., who had perished in a wreck on the final lap of the 2001 Daytona 500 race earlier that year. On June 9, 2004, during the State Funeral of President Ronald Reagan. As the caisson paused at 4th Street and Constitution Avenue, 21 Air Force F-15E Strike Eagles from the 4th Fighter Wing, Seymour Johnson Air Force Base in North Carolina, flew over in missing man formation. In December 2004, as a final tribute to Prince Bernhard of the Netherlands's former military role in the Royal Netherlands Air Force, three modern F-16 jet fighters and a World War II Spitfire performed a missing man formation during his funeral. On September 13, 2007, two days after two Bo 105 helicopters operated by the Swedish Air Force collided, four Saab JAS 39 Gripen performed the missing man formation when relatives to the pilots, accompanied by Micael Byd√©n, visited the crash site. On May 25, 2012, the Royal Norwegian Air Force performed the flypast at the funeral of World War II resistance fighter Gunnar S√∏nsteby, Norway's most highly decorated citizen. The missing man formation was flown at a family memorial service in Indian Hill, Ohio on 31 August 2012 in honour of former American astronaut, US Navy pilot, and test pilot Neil Armstrong, the first man to walk on the Moon. In November 2014 the state memorial service for former Australian Prime Minister Gough Whitlam, who had served as a navigator in the Royal Australian Air Force during World War II, concluded with a missing man formation flight conducted by four RAAF F/A-18 Hornet fighters. On 29 March 2015, the Republic of Singapore Air Force's Black Knights attempted to fly the missing man formation as an aerial salute to long-serving former Prime Minister Lee Kuan Yew during his funeral procession from Parliament House to the University Cultural Centre of the National University of Singapore, but could not, due to rain and low overcast cloud and low visibility; they flew over, above the cloud. On March 11, 2016, Fairchild Republic A-10 Thunderbolt II, also known as the Warthog, perform a missing man formation flyover at Arlington National Cemetery in Arlington, Virginia. The Warthogs flew over the burial service for retired US Air Force Col. Avery Kay, considered the father of the A-10s.

On May 3, 2020, a missing man formation was flown by the RCAF Snowbirds over 12 Wing Shearwater to honor the crew of a CH-148 Helicopter operating aboard HMCS Fredericton that was lost in the Ionian Sea on April 30th during a training exercise. https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/nova- scotia/snowbirds-ns-1.5562572 Motorsport variant The missing man formation is also used in various types of motorsport to commemorate the death of a driver, rider, or official. In case of a rolling start, during the pace laps before the race begins, the driver in the pole position drops back a row into the second row and the field paces with no vehicle in the lead position. This was done during the 2001 Dura Lube 400 at Rockingham by Jeff Gordon, in honor of Dale Earnhardt following his death the week before at the Daytona 500. Similarly, the pole position on a starting grid can be left empty for a standing start. After the deaths of Ayrton Senna and Roland Ratzenberger in the 1994 San Marino Grand Prix, in the next race in Monaco, the first two grid positions were left empty and painted with the colors of their home countries flags - Brazil and Austria, respectively.  American football variant  The missing man formation is frequently used by American football teams to commemorate the death of a teammate. Typically, on the first play in which the fallen player would have appeared, the team takes the field with only ten players, leaving their position in the formation open. On September 1, 2007 the USC Trojans college football team performed the missing man. After scoring their first touchdown, USC lined up for the PAT without a kicker in tribute to teammate Mario Danelo who died just after the 2006 season. On December 2, 2007 the NFL's Washington Redskins lined up for their first defensive play of the game with 10 men in honor of safety Sean Taylor who died on November 27, 2007. On September 3, 2016 the Nebraska Cornhuskers college football team lined up in punt formation without a punter on their first fourth down in their game against the Fresno State Bulldogs to honor punter Sam Foltz, who died in a traffic accident on July 23, 2016. Fresno State declined the resulting delay of game penalty.

He is internationally known as √Ålvaro Siza () and in Portugal as Siza Vieira (). Early life and education Siza was born in Matosinhos, a small coastal town near Porto. He graduated in architecture in 1955, at the former School of Fine Arts of the University of Porto, the current FAUP - Faculdade de Arquitectura da Universidade do Porto. Career Siza completed his first built work (four houses in Matosinhos) even before ending his studies in 1954, the same year that he first opened his private practice in Porto. Along with Fernando T√°vora, he soon became one of the references of the Porto School of Architecture where both were teachers. Both architects worked together between 1955 and 1958. Another architect he has collaborated with is Eduardo Souto de Moura, e.g. on Portugal's flagship pavilions at Expo '98 in Lisbon and Expo 2000 in Hannover, as well as on the Serpentine Pavillon 2005. Siza's work is often described as \\"poetic modernism\\"; he himself has contributed to publications on Luis Barrag√°n. Among Siza's earliest works to gain public attention was a public pool complex (named Piscinas de Mar√©s) he created in the 1960s for Le√ßa da Palmeira, a fishing town and summer resort north of Porto. Completed in 1966, both of the two swimming pools (one for children, the other for adults) as well as the building with changing rooms and a cafe are set into the natural rock formation on the site with unobstructed views of the sea. In 1977, following the revolution in Portugal, the city government of √âvora commissioned Siza to plan a housing project in the rural outskirts of the town. It was to be one of several that he would do for SAAL (Servi√ßo de Apoio Ambulat√≥rio Local), the national housing association, consisting of 1,200 low-cost, housing units, some one-story and some two-story row houses, all with courtyards. He was also a member of the team which reconstructed Chiado, the historic center of Lisbon destroyed by a fire in 1988. Most of his best known works are located in his hometown Porto: the Boa Nova Tea House (1963), the Faculty of Architecture (1987‚Äì93), and the Serralves Museum of Contemporary Art (1997). Since the mid-1970s, Siza has been involved in numerous designs for public housing, public pools, and universities. Between 1995 and 2009, Siza has been working on an architecture museum on Hombroich island, completed in collaboration with Rudolf Finsterwalder. Most recently, he started coordinating the rehabilitation of the monuments and architectonic heritage of Cidade Velha (Old Village) in Santiago, an island of Cape Verde. Commissioned after winning an international competition in 2010, Siza and Granada-based Juan Domingo Santos unveiled designs for a new entrance and visitors center at the Alhambra in 2014. By 2012, Siza warned that he might close his Portuguese office because of a lack of contracts. In 2019, he was commissioned with his first project in the United States, a 450-foot-tall, 37-story apartment building at 611 West 56th Street in Manhattan. In 2014, with Carlos Castanheira, √Ålvaro Size had created a building which is the Building on the Water in Huai'An City, Jiangsu, China and has been award the building of the year 2015 by ArchDaily. In 2020, √Ålvaro Size had designed four buildings respective Siza House, YuChia House, Tea House and Gate House at the Taifong Golf Club, in Changhua, Taiwan. Teaching Siza taught at FAUP from 1966 to 1969, returning in 1976. In addition to his teaching there, he has been a visiting professor at the Graduate School of Design, Harvard University; the University of Pennsylvania; Los Andes University of Bogota; and the √âcole Polytechnique F√©d√©rale de Lausanne. Legacy In July 2014 Siza announced his decision to donate the large part of his architectural archive to the Canadian Centre for Architecture (CCA) in Montreal, Quebec, Canada, in order to make his materials \\"accessible alongside the work of other modern and contemporary architects\\",Siza, √Ålvaro (23 July 2014), \\"√Ålvaro Siza's fonds\\", Canadian Centre for Architecture (CCA). while also giving specific project archives to the Funda√ß√£o Gulbenkian in Lisbon and Funda√ß√£o de Serralves in Porto, Portugal. Recognition Library of the Escola Superior de Educa√ß√£o de Set√∫bal, 1986-1994 In 1987, the dean of Harvard Graduate School of Design, the Spanish architect Rafael Moneo, organized the first show of Siza's work in the United States. In 1992, he was awarded with the renowned Pritzker Prize for the renovation project that he coordinated in the Chiado area of Lisbon, a historic commercial sector that was all but completely destroyed by fire in August 1988. Other prizes include: The Golden Medal of The Superior Council of Architecture of the College of Architects of Madrid in 1988; Mies van der Rohe Award for European Architecture, the Prince of Wales Prize in Urban Design from Harvard University, and the Alvar Aalto Medal in 1988; Portugal's National Prize of Architecture 1993; the Arnold W. Brunner Memorial Prize by the American Academy of Arts and Letters and the Praemium Imperiale in 1998, the Wolf Prize in Arts in 2001, the Urbanism Special Grand Prize of France 2005. Siza's Iber√™ Camargo Foundation in Porto Alegre, his first project built in Brazilian territory, was honoured by the Venice Architecture Biennale with the Golden Lion award in 2002.8th International Architecture Exhibition 2002 La Biennale di Venezia. In 2007 the Brazilian Government awarded him the Cultural Merit Order Medal. More recently he was awarded the RIBA's 2009 Royal Gold Medal and the International Union of Architects' 2011 Gold Medal. Siza was awarded by the Venice Architecture Biennale (13th Edition) with the Golden Lion for lifetime achievement (2012). Siza was conferred the title of Honoris Causa Doctor by the following universities: Polytechnic University of Valencia; √âcole Polytechnique F√©d√©rale de Lausanne; University of Palermo; University Menendez Pelayo, in Santander; Universidad Nacional de Ingenier√≠a in Lima, Peru; University of Coimbra; Lus√≠ada University of Porto; Universidade Federal de Para√≠ba; the Universit√† degli Studi di Napoli Federico II, Polo delle Scienze e delle Tecnologie, in Naples; the University of Architecture and Urbanism of Bucharest \\"Ion Mincu\\", Romania (2005); and the University of Pavia, Italy (2007).

Port Stephens lies within the Port Stephens-Great Lakes Marine Park and is situated about north-east of Sydney. The harbour lies wholly within the local government area of Port Stephens; although its northern shoreline forms the boundary between the Port Stephens and Mid-Coast local government areas. According to the 2006 Census, more than people lived within of its long shoreline and more than lived within .Consolidated population figures from the Australian Bureau of Statistics 2006 Census Geography Port Stephens is formed through the confluence of the Myall and Karuah rivers, Tilligerry Creek, and the Tasman Sea of the South Pacific Ocean. The lower port has a predominantly marine ecology and the upper port an estuarine ecology. The area to the east of Port Stephens comprises the Tomago/Tomaree/Stockton sand beds. A narrow entrance between two striking hills of volcanic origin marks the opening of Port Stephens to the sea. The southern headland, Tomaree or South Head, rises to above mean sea level (AMSL) while Yacaaba, the northern headland, is AMSL. The harbour is mostly shallow and sandy but contains sufficient deep water to accommodate large vessels. After its recovery from the wreck site in 1974 the bow of the , a Norwegian bulk carrier that was shipwrecked on Stockton Beach earlier that year, was moored in Port Stephens, at Salamander Bay, for almost two years. With an area of approximately , Port Stephens is larger than Sydney Harbour. Port Stephens extends approximately inland from the Tasman Sea and at its widest point, between Tanilba Bay and Tahlee, it is across. The narrowest point is between Soldiers Point and Pindimar where the distance is only . Between Nelson Bay and Tea Gardens, in the most well known section of the port, it is wide. The Karuah River drains into Port Stephens at its north-western corner. The Myall River (through the Myall Lakes) drains into the port on its northern shore, about from the mouth of the port. Twelve Mile Creek drains into the port's south-western corner. The southern shore of the port is divided into two distinct areas known as the Tomaree and Tilligerry peninsulas. These are separated by Tilligerry Creek, a watercourse covering approximately , which drains the land in the low-lying areas of Salt Ash, Bobs Farm, Tanilba Bay and Mallabula. While the Tilligerry Peninsula is geographically closer to major centres such as Sydney and Newcastle, it lacks the urban development that has occurred on the much larger ( vs respectively) Tomaree peninsula. Although Lemon Tree Passage, on the Tilligerry Peninsula, and Soldiers Point, on the Tomaree Peninsula, are only from each other, physical separation of the suburbs by Port Stephens and Tilligerry Creek results in them being almost from each other by road. The town of Karuah, located at the north-western corner of the port near the mouth of the Karuah River, experiences similar geographical separation from the Tilligerry Peninsula. Despite being only from Tanilba Bay, the road distance between the two suburbs is . The western shore and the western part of the northern shore of the port are largely undeveloped with the flora ranging from scrubland in the west to the large tracts of bushland which are present along most of the northern shore. Closer to the mouth of the port, at and near Winda Woppa, sandy beaches are prevalent. These extend from Jimmys Beach, near the mouth of the port, to the mouth of the Myall River, a distance of approximately .Measurements from 1:100000 maps 9232 NEWCASTLE and 9332 PORT STEPHENS Just outside the mouth of the port lie the two small insular nature reserves of Cabbage Tree Island and Boondelbah Island, both dedicated to the conservation of the threatened Gould's petrel, and with no public access. History Entrance of Karuah River into Port Stephens (seen from Tanilba Bay, approximately away) The port was named by Captain Cook when he passed by on 11 May 1770, honouring Sir Philip Stephens, who was Secretary to the Admiralty. Stephens was a personal friend of Cook and had recommended him for command of the voyage. It seems Cook's initial choice had actually been Point Keppel and Keppel Bay, but instead he used Keppel Bay later.Parkin, Ray (2003) H.M. Bark Endeavour, p. 213. Carlton South, Victoria: The Miegunyah Press. . The first ship to enter the port was the Salamander, a ship of the Third Fleet that later gave the suburb of Salamander Bay its name, in 1791. (see \\"Early development of Port Stephens\\" section) In that same year escaped convicts, then known as 'bolters', discovered coal in the area. In 1795 the crew of discovered a group of escaped convicts, living with the Worimi people. Port Stephens became a popular haven for escaped convicts and so in 1820 a garrison of soldiers was established at what is now known as Soldiers Point. The cutter Lambton, commanded by Captain James Corlette, began shipping timber and wool out of the port in 1816. The suburb of Corlette was named after the captain. Port Stephens has rather poor soil for the most part, and has limited agricultural potential. For this reason, no large towns developed there historically and it was never developed as a significant port. The major city and port of Newcastle developed at the mouth of the Hunter River, about south-west of Port Stephens. Troops and landing craft crews training at during World War II Despite this, in 1920 there was a push for Port Stephens to be the capital city of a new state in a proposal originating from the country newspaper The Daily Observer. The proposal was the Observer's editor Victor Charles Thompson's idea in response to continuing rural Australian antipathy at the Sydney-centralised funding and governance that many rural newspapers claimed had neglected to aid rural Australian towns. During World War II, the remoteness and lack of any significant civilian population led to the Royal Australian Navy establishing HMAS Assault, an amphibious landing training establishment, at Nelson Bay. The sick bay from HMAS Assault still stands and is used by the Port Stephens Community Arts Centre. A number of small towns developed around the port as fishing, holiday and retirement communities. Since the 1970s, with improved road access from Sydney, and the increasing popularity of coastal retirement lifestyles, there has been major expansion of these towns. Port Stephens-Great Lakes Marine Park On 1 December 2005 the Port Stephens-Great Lakes Marine Park was established pursuant to the . The park comprises approximately and includes all of Port Stephens, the Karuah and Myall rivers and all their creeks and tributaries under tidal influence. The park was established to protect the wide variety of sea life that inhabit the port and nearby coastal areas of the Tasman Sea from just south of Forster to the northern end of Stockton Beach. Demographics Nelson Bay at dusk from Gan Gan Lookout Shoal Bay beach in Port Stephens At the time of the 2006 Census, more than 85% of the population around Port Stephens resided in towns and suburbs that have developed on or near the southern shores of the port. More than 22,188 people live within of the port in the suburbs of Corlette, Lemon Tree Passage, Mallabula, Nelson Bay, Oyster Cove, Salamander Bay, Shoal Bay, Soldiers Point, Tanilba Bay and Taylors Beach. Another 5,343 people live in other suburbs on the Tomaree peninsula that are within of Port Stephens. These suburbs include Anna Bay, Boat Harbour, Bobs Farm, Fingal Bay, Fishermans Bay and One Mile. Most urban development to the south of Port Stephens has occurred on the Tomaree peninsula in the suburbs of Corlette, Nelson Bay, Salamander Bay, Shoal Bay and Soldiers Point. On the western shore is the suburb of Swan Bay, a small community of around 100 persons. The main industry in the area is oyster farming, however a small tourist resort is located near the mouth of Twelve Mile Creek. Karuah township, which has a population of 857, is at the north-western corner of the port, at the mouth of the Karuah River. East of the Karuah River, in the Mid-Coast Council local government area there are 3,584 people living in Bundabah, Carrington, Hawks Nest, North Arm Cove, Pindimar, Tahlee and Tea Gardens. Tourism and recreation Port Stephens is a popular tourism destination with a strong focus on aquatic activities such as whale and dolphin watching, fishing and recreational boating and swimming. Notes # Although of Anna Bay's shoreline actually touches Port Stephens near Taylor's Beach, none of its residents live in this area. The vast majority of Anna Bay residents live close to the Tasman Sea shoreline, well away from Port Stephens, although there is a small community living near the border between Anna Bay and Taylor's Beach.

Its products and services include investment management, lifetime mortgages (a form of equity release), pensions, annuities, and life assurance. As of January 2020, it no longer provides general insurance following the sale of Legal & General Insurance to Allianz. It has operations in the United Kingdom and United States, with investment management businesses in the Gulf, Europe and Asia. Legal & General is listed on the London Stock Exchange and is a constituent of the FTSE 100 Index. Legal & General Investment Management (LGIM), the asset management arm of L&G;, is the 10th largest investment management firm in the world by AUM. It is also the second largest institutional investment management firm in Europe (after BlackRock).  History  1836 to 2000 Legal & General was formed by Sergeant John Adams and five other lawyers in June 1836 in a Chancery Lane coffee shop. Originally called the New Law Life Assurance Society, the society was restricted to those in the legal profession. The name was changed to Legal & General Life Assurance Society to reflect that policies were available to the general public but with share ownership restricted to those in the legal profession. The group expanded in the UK and soon began to acquire overseas life assurance companies, purchasing a pensions business from the Metropolitan Life Assurance Company of New York in the 1930s. The society became a wholly owned division of Legal & General Group plc in the 1970s. Legal & General Group, formed Legal & General America as a holding company in 1981, and bought Government Employees Life Insurance Company (GELICO) and its NY affiliate. The GELICO name changed to Banner in 1983. William Penn was purchased by Legal & General Group Plc as a wholly owned subsidiary of Banner Life Insurance Company in 1989. It bought the Dutch branch of Unlike Assurance Group and also set up business in France during the 1980s. Following the trend in the United Kingdom at the time of financial institutions entering the estate agency sector, Legal & General purchased Whitegates Estate Agency from Provident Financial Group plc for ¬£19 million in December 1989. The former Legal & General logo Kingswood In the 1940s the main office of Legal & General was moved from Temple Bar House in the City of London to a remodelled former girls' school in leafy Kingswood, Surrey, save for some top management functions which remained in London. The girls' school (St. Monica's), which formed the basis for the site, was attended by the novelist Vera Brittain, mother of the politician Shirley Williams. The Kingswood site, which included sports fields, a park, a large and luxurious swimming pool, a canteen and a simulacrum of an English pub, among other facilities, was expanded in the 1950s and again in the 1980s. In 2015, it was announced that the headquarters would close \\"potentially before 2025\\". In fact, after a period of uncertainty for the staff at Kingswood, it was announced that the site would shut much earlier, in 2018. The previous Legal & General logo incorporates the image of the Temple Bar (which is still used in the logo of the company's social and athletic committee), and the founding date. The umbrella logo used today was introduced by former Chief Press Officer Gordon Macdonald in June 1984. Between 1991 and 1994, Legal and General sponsored the Regional Weather Forecasts for the ITV network and in 1999, Legal & General announced plans, which never came to fruition, to merge its business with National Westminster Bank to form the first 'bancassurance' company in the UK. 2000 to present The company sold the Legal & General Bank and Legal & General Mortgage Services to Northern Rock in 2003 and sold its stake in Gresham Insurance, its joint venture with Barclays Bank, to Barclays in 2005. In 2008 Legal & General bought Suffolk Life, a provider of Self Invested Pension products, sold Suffolk Life in 2016 and also outsourced its IT development areas to TCS (Tata Consultancy Services). The company formed a joint venture with two Indian public sector banks, Bank of Baroda and Andhra Bank to launch IndiaFirst Life Insurance Company in India in 2009 and outsourced some IT areas to IBM in October 2010. In 2013 the company bought Lucida Life, a pensions buyout company, for ¬£151 million. In 2014, there was a \\"shock\\" announcement that Legal & General was leaving as one of the Association of British Insurers (ABI)'s around 300 corporate members, due to ABI's \\"decision to transfer its investment business to the Investment Management Association.\\" In the same year, the group disposed of its estate agency business, Xperience, which comprised 89 offices and 75 franchisees, trading as CJ Hole, Ellis and Co, Parkers and Whitegates, to Martin & Co for ¬£6 million. In 2014, the company formed Legal & General Reinsurance, a Bermudian-based reinsurance company. Legal & General Re completed its maiden external transaction in the Dutch market in cooperation with ASR in December 2015. In May 2016 Legal & General Assurance in the UK bought the ¬£3 billion UK annuity portfolio of Aegon. In 2019 following earlier speculation, the company agreed the sale of its General Insurance division, Legal & General Insurance, to Allianz Insurance, the latter making a simultaneous purchase of the remaining 51% share of Liverpool Victoria General Insurance of which it already owned 49%. The acquisition took effect on 1 January 2020, at which time Legal & General Insurance was renamed \\"Fairmead Insurance\\".

They were a member of the National Hockey Association (NHA). The club was founded in 1911 and began operations in 1912. The club won its sole Stanley Cup championship in 1914. The club became the centre of a controversy among NHA owners leading to the NHA suspending operations and the owners forming the National Hockey League (NHL). The Blueshirts were replaced in the NHL by a new Toronto Hockey Club under the ownership of the Toronto Arena Company, the Blueshirts' former landlord. The Torontos' players were leased to the Arena ownership temporarily and competed in the NHL in 1917‚Äì18, winning the Stanley Cup. The Arena Company was then granted a permanent franchise for the 1918‚Äì19 season that evolved into today's Toronto Maple Leafs. History Founding to Cup winners The Torontos, Stanley Cup champions 1913-14 The NHA was founded in 1909 without any teams based in Toronto. National Hockey Association (NHA) founder Ambrose O'Brien operated four franchises in the NHA: the Cobalt Silver Kings, Haileybury Comets, Les Canadiens and the Renfrew Creamery Kings. In 1910, O'Brien suspended the Cobalt, Haileybury and Canadiens clubs and sold one franchise to form the Montreal Canadiens, who took the Les Canadiens' players. In 1911, O'Brien decided to leave professional ice hockey entirely. Quebec interests bought one of the franchises from O'Brien, and the final two were sold to interests who planned to relocate the teams to Toronto. Toronto had not previously had an arena with artificial ice that would be large enough for an NHA team, but in 1911 work had begun on constructing the Arena Gardens. The arena was owned by the Toronto Arena Company, organized on September 19, 1911 with Sir Henry Pellatt as president, Lol Solman as managing director, and directors Aemilius Jarvis, Joseph Kilgour, T.W. Horn, R.A. Smith, and Col. Carlson. There were two other directors from Montreal. W. J. Bellingham was the initial manager. The franchise which became the Toronto Hockey Club was bought by Frank Robinson, Percy Quinn and other investors for . Quinn was president of the Dominion Lacrosse Association, a Canadian professional lacrosse league that had patterned itself after the NHA. The second Toronto franchise was awarded to a group affiliated with the Tecumseh Lacrosse Club of Toronto. The Tecumsehs bought a franchise from O'Brien, paying cash and promissory notes for Although the NHA franchise was bought from O'Brien, who had operated a team with it, no other assets came with the franchise. According to Coleman, the franchise for the Torontos was that used by the Les Canadiens. Other books quote O'Brien as selling the Canadiens to George Kennedy, leaving the case of which franchise was sold to Robinson unresolved. In any case, the Toronto team was built from scratch and did not include any players from Les Canadiens. The first manager was Toronto native and former Ottawa Senators player Bruce Ridpath, who had intended to be a playing-coach but was no longer able to play due to an injury suffered when he was struck by an automobile the previous year. The schedule for the 1911‚Äì12 season was drawn up with two Toronto teams. As the Arena was not finished, no games were scheduled to be played in Toronto until the end of January, when the new arena was supposed to be ready. It soon became clear that construction of Arena Gardens would not be finished in time, and in mid- December it was announced that the two Toronto teams had been dropped from the schedule and the league would play with only four teams that season. The Torontos played their first game on December 25, 1912 before 4,000 fans at Arena Gardens. The Toronto Hockey Club was owned by Quinn, managed by Ridpath, and initially coached by Tom Humphrey who was soon replaced by player-coach Jack Marshall. The team Ridpath put on the ice included Cully Wilson and future hall-of-famers Hap Holmes, Harry Cameron, Frank Foyston, and Frank Nighbor. The Torontos finished the year in a tie for third place. Before the 1913‚Äì14 season, the club faced some upheaval. Ridpath resigned as manager in October 1913 and was replaced by Marshall. Ridpath would try out as a player but gave up his comeback attempt before the season started. Despite the changes, the Torontos won the Stanley Cup in 1914, defeating the Montreal Canadiens in a playoff to decide the NHA champion. After the season, the team then played a series with the Victoria Aristocrats of the Pacific Coast Hockey League. A controversy erupted when a letter arrived from the Stanley Cup trustees on March 17, that the trustees would not let the Stanley Cup travel west, as they did not consider Victoria a proper challenger because they had not formally notified the trustees. However, on March 18, Trustee William Foran stated that it was a misunderstanding. PCHA president Frank Patrick had not filed a challenge, because he had expected Emmett Quinn of the NHA to make all of the arrangements in his role as hockey commissioner, whereas the trustees thought they were being deliberately ignored. In any case, all arrangements had been ironed out and the Victoria challenge was accepted. Nevertheless, the Torontos defeated Victoria in a best-of-five series played in Toronto in three straight games. The Livingstone era Quinn left the team after the Stanley Cup win to return to business and his absence was felt. The next season, the team fell to fourth place in the six-team NHA with a record of 8 wins and 12 losses (down from 13 wins and 7 losses). Before the 1915‚Äì16 season, several events occurred that changed the NHA and the Blueshirts specifically. Robinson joined the Canadian military in 1915 and put the Blueshirts up for sale. Robinson received two offers for the club; the McNamara brothers and Eddie Livingstone, owner of the Toronto Shamrocks. Livingstone was from Toronto and offered more, and Robinson accepted his bid. At the same time, the Pacific Coast Hockey Association‚Äîupset over the NHA's efforts to bring Cyclone Taylor back east‚Äîbroke all ties with the NHA and conducted a player raid. The PCHA created a new team in Seattle and stocked it with the Torontos' two leading scorers in Wilson and Foyston, their goaltender, Hap Holmes, and two other key members of the Toronto team in Jack Walker and Eddie Carpenter. The only regular Blueshirts' players to remain in Toronto were Cameron and Roy McGiffin. Livingstone announced he planned to sell the Shamrocks. After the dust settled, the Patricks had stocked their new team, conducted a raid on the NHA, Robinson was able to sell his team and Livingstone had the Toronto market to himself. Despite the raid, Livingstone did not retaliate against the PCHA and never did. According to authors Morey Holzman and Joseph Nieforth, this strongly suggested a deal had been made between Livingstone, Robinson and the Patricks. To make up for the players lost in the raid, Livingstone transferred Shamrocks players to the Blueshirts and allowed the Shamrock franchise to go dormant. The Torontos, composed mostly of former Shamrock players, skated to a record of 9 wins, 14 losses and 1 tie in the 1915‚Äì16 NHA season, finishing in last place in the five-team league. The Globe was not against the removal of Livingstone, in this editorial of February 13, 1917. Livingstone was frequently at odds with his fellow owners, particularly Sam Lichtenhein of the Montreal Wanderers. Tempers boiled over when the NHA added a second Toronto team in 1916‚Äì17, representing the 228th Battalion of the Canadian army. The 228th was forced to withdraw its team in mid-season when the unit was called overseas. That left the NHA with an odd number of teams. On February 12, the team owners‚Äîat a meeting that did not include Livingstone‚Äîdecided to even-up the number of teams by suspending operations of the Torontos for the rest of the season. All players were given to other NHA teams for the rest of the season. At the time, the plan was to return the players to the Toronto franchise, but the other owners wanted Livingstone out. At the end of the season, Toronto was reinstated, with the condition that Livingstone sell the club within 60 days. However, Livingstone obtained a court order to prevent the sale. 1917‚Äì1919: Arena era On November 22, the NHA owners announced that the league would suspend operations for the 1917‚Äì18 season. About two weeks later, all of the owners except Livingstone announced that they were creating a new league, the National Hockey League. However, they did not invite Livingstone to join them, effectively leaving him in a one-team league. The NHA owners made this move as a work-around the NHA constitution, which barred them from expelling the Blueshirts even though they had long since lost patience with him. Despite having rid themselves of Livingstone, the other teams wished to keep a team in Toronto. They also needed a fourth team to balance the schedule due to the Quebec Bulldogs' decision to sit out the season. Accordingly, Livingstone's landlord, the Toronto Arena Company, was given a temporary Toronto franchise in the NHL and leased Livingstone's Torontos players for the inaugural 1917‚Äì18 NHL season. At the time, Frank Calder, the NHL president, was demanding that the Arena Company and Livingstone come to an agreement to transfer the franchise. To Toronto fans, it looked like little had changed on the ice. Although the team had no official name, it was made up mostly of former Blueshirts. As a result, the newspapers still called the team \\"the Blueshirts\\" or \\"the Torontos,\\" as they always had. Additionally, the team wore a white sweater with a blue \\"T,\\" the same uniform worn by the Blueshirts in the previous season. Led by general manager Charlie Querrie and coach Dick Carroll, the team won the Stanley Cup in 1918. In fitting fashion, no winner was engraved on the Stanley Cup. However, in 1947, the NHL added the name of the Toronto Arenas for 1918. The Arena Company had originally promised to return the Toronto players to Livingstone if no transfer could be arranged. Instead, before the 1918‚Äì19 season, it formed a new club, the Toronto Arena Hockey Club. This new franchise was separated from the Arena Company because it was due money to Livingstone from the players and the Stanley Cup revenues (fixed later by court at $20,000). Additionally, it could exist separately from any legal action filed by Livingstone. On paper, the club was owned by Arena Company secretary-treasurer Hubert Vearncombe and Querrie, with Vearncombe as team president. The NHL readily admitted this new team as a member in good standing. Querrie remained as general manager. However, the team had a dismal five-win season and was forced to suspend operations in February, and blamed Livingstone for interference. By 1919, the NHA owners had established that there would be no revival of the NHA. However, the dispute with Livingstone forced the Arena Company into bankruptcy. The Arenas were sold to a group headed by Querrie, who renamed them the Toronto St. Patricks. This team became the Toronto Maple Leafs midway through the 1926‚Äì27 season. The NHA/NHL claimed the $5000 franchise fee from the 1919 St. Patricks was to 'buy' Livingstone's hockey club. By all accounts, however, the money instead went into Calder's pocket. Despite the ties to the Torontos, the Maple Leafs do not claim the Blueshirts' history as their own (unlike the Canadiens, the other NHL franchise with NHA roots). They do, however, claim the history of the \\"temporary\\" Toronto NHL franchise of 1917‚Äì18. =Players on the 1916‚Äì17 and 1917‚Äì18 teams= Blueshirts' championship banner on display at International Hockey Hall of Fame along with items Harry Cameron used These players were the property of the Toronto Hockey Club in 1916‚Äì17 and returned to play for the Torontos of 1917‚Äì18. * Arthur Brooks * Harry Cameron ‚Äì had played 228 games (NHA and NHL combined) * Jack Coughlin * Corb Denneny * Reg Noble * Ken Randall * Alf Skinner Season-by-season record For the full season-by-season history of the Toronto Hockey Club, see List of Toronto Hockey Club seasons.

The administrative centre and largest town in Bourke Shire, Bourke is approximately north-west of the state capital, Sydney, on the south bank of the Darling River. History The location of the current township of Bourke on a bend in the Darling River is the traditional country of the Ngemba people. The first white explorer to encounter the river was Charles Sturt in 1828 who named it after Sir Ralph Darling, Governor of New South Wales. Having struck the region during an intense drought and a low river, Sturt dismissed the area as largely uninhabitable and short of any features necessary for establishing reliable industry on the land. A Camel caravan in Bourke circa 1900 It was not until the mid-1800s following a visit by colonial surveyor and explorer Sir Thomas Mitchell in 1835 that settlement of the area began. Following tensions with the local people Mitchell built a small stockade to protect his men and named it Fort Bourke after then Governor Sir Richard Bourke. This first crude structure became the foundation for a fledgling community with a small number of agricultural and livestock farms established in the region shortly afterwards. The area started to flourish when its location on the Darling River had it recognised as a key trade centre, linking the nearby outback agricultural industries with the east coast trade routes via the Darling River. Bourke was surveyed for a town in 1869 and soon established itself as the outback trade hub of New South Wales with several transportation industries setting up branches in the town. By the 1880s Bourke would host a Cobb & Co Coach Terminus, several paddle boat companies running the Darling and a bridge crossing the river that would allow for road transportation into the town. Opened on 4 May 1883, the North Bourke Bridge was designed by J H Daniels and modified in 1895 and 1903 by E M de Burgh. Its construction was begun by David BailIie and completed by McCulloch & Co. The 1895 modifications led to improved designs for subsequent lift-span bridges. The bridge is the oldest moveable-span bridge in Australia and is the sole survivor of its type in New South Wales. It served for 114 years before being bypassed in 1997 when a new bridge carrying the Mitchell Highway was opened just downstream. By 1885 Bourke would be accessible by rail, confirming its position as a major inland transport hub. Like many outback Australian townships, Bourke would come to rely on camels for overland transport, and the area supported a large Afghan community that had been imported to drive the teams of camels. A small Afghan mosque that dates back to the 1900s can be found within Bourke cemetery. As trade moved away from river transport routes, Bourke's hold on the inland trade industry began to relax. Whilst no longer considered a trade centre, Bourke serves instead as a key service centre for the state's north western regions. In this semi-arid outback landscape, sheep farming along with some small irrigated cotton crops comprise the primary industry in the area today. Bourke's traditional landholders endured a similar fate to indigenous people across Australia. Dispossessed of their traditional country and in occasional conflict with white settlers, they battled a loss of land and culture and were hit hard by European disease. While the population of the local Ngemba and Barkindji people around the town of Bourke had dwindled by the late 19th century, many continued to live a traditional lifestyle in the region. Others found employment on local stations working with stock and found their skill as trackers in high demand. A large influx of displaced Aboriginal peoples from other areas in the 1940s saw Bourke's indigenous community grow and led to the establishment of a reserve in 1946 by the Aborigines Protection Board. The majority of indigenous settlers were Wangkumara people from the Tibooburra region. In 1962, local high jumper Percy Hobson became the first person of Aboriginal descent to win a Commonwealth Games gold medal for Australia in Perth. The tall Hobson jumped above his height to win the event with a Games record leap of . Hobson was celebrated on his return to Bourke and greeted by a brass band playing \\"Hail the Conquering Hero\\".  Heritage listings  The old Towers Drug Company Building - built 1889-90 Bourke Post Office - built 1880 Bourke has a number of heritage-listed sites, including: * 3-7 Meek Street: St Ignatius Roman Catholic Church and Convent * 45 Mitchell Street: Towers Drug Company Building * 47 Oxley Street: Bourke Post Office * Richard Street: Bourke Court House * 5 Richard Street: Ardsilla * 17 Sturt Street: Old London Bank Building * The North Bourke Bridge, opened in 1883, is on the Engineering Heritage Register. Population In 2016, there were 1,824 people in Bourke. * Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people made up 38.0% of the population. * 78.1% of people were born in Australia and 80.2% spoke only English at home. * The most popular (40.2%) religion was Catholicism. In Bourke today, there are 21 recognised indigenous language groups, including Ngemba, Barkindji, Wangkumara and Murrawari.  Climate  Mitchell Street, Bourke, in \\"The Wet\\", a flood that occurred in 1890 Under the K√∂ppen‚ÄìGeiger classification, Bourke has a hot semi-arid climate (BSh) with a mild amount of rainfall throughout the year. On 4 January 1903, Bourke recorded a maximum temperature of 49.7 ¬∞C (121.5 ¬∞F), making it tied for the highest temperature recorded anywhere in New South Wales with Menindee, which is located further to the south, and one of the highest maximums ever to be recorded in Australia. Education Bourke has many schools for preschool children, primary and high school students. The Bourke ‚Äì Walgett school of Distance education allows children to be schooled at home, from preschool to year 12. Transportation The unsealed Bourke- Wilcannia highway links the two towns. Bourke can be reached by the Mitchell Highway from both the north from Cunnamulla and from the southeast from Nyngan. Brewarrina and Walgett are located on the Kamilaroi Highway that has its western terminus in Bourke. Moree and Goondiwindi, located on the Newell Highway, connect to Bourke via various roads. Cobar via the Kidman Way, is connected from the south. The town is also served by Bourke Airport (private aircraft only at present) and has NSW TrainLink bus service to other regional centres such as Dubbo. It was formerly the largest inland port in the world for exporting wool on the Darling River. The Bourke court house is unique in inland Australia in that it was originally a maritime court and to this day maintains that distinction. That distinction is evident in the crowns that sits above the finials of the flag poles atop the corner parapets of the building. Bourke railway station is the original terminus of the Main Western railway line. The railway extension from Byrock opened on 3 September 1885. Passenger services on the line were cancelled in September 1975 with the line closing down entirely in 1986, leaving the station derelict. The Tourist Information Centre is located on the Mitchell Highway at The Back 'O Bourke Exhibition Centre.Bourke station. NSWrail.net, accessed 8 September 2009. Cultural significance Telegraph Hotel established 1875, now Riverside Motel Bourke is considered to represent the edge of the settled agricultural districts and the gateway to the outback that lies north and west of Bourke. This is reflected in a traditional east coast Australian expression \\"back o' Bourke\\". In 1892 a young writer Henry Lawson was sent to Bourke by the Bulletin editor J.F. Archibald to get a taste of outback life and to try to curb his heavy drinking. In Lawson's own words \\"I got ¬£5 and a railway ticket from the Bulletin and went to Bourke. Painted, picked up in a shearing shed and swagged it for six months\\". The experience was to have a profound effect on the 25-year-old and his encounter with the harsh realities of bush life inspired much of his subsequent work. Lawson would later write \\"if you know Bourke you know Australia\\". In 1992 eight poems, written under a pseudonym and published in the Western Herald, were discovered in the Bourke library archives and confirmed to be Lawson's work. Bush poets Harry 'Breaker' Morant and William Ogilvie also spent time in the Bourke region and based much of their work on the experience. Eye surgeon Fred Hollows was buried in Bourke after his death in 1993. Fred Hollows had worked in Bourke in the early 1970s and had asked to be buried there. The Telegraph Hotel, established in 1888 beside the Darling River, has been restored and now operates as the Riverside Motel. Crime In 2008, persistently high levels of crime in Bourke led to a ban of the takeaway sales of beer in glass bottles, fortified wine larger than 750 ml and cask wine larger than two litres with only 3.5% or less alcohol non-glass bottles being sold midday.Bourke bans the booze , The Land 8 December 2008. A U.S.-style justice reinvestment program has also been put in place to combat crime. Media The town is served by seven FM and two AM radio stations, and five television channels. The commercial radio stations are Rebel FM and The Breeze. Rebel FM broadcasts on 104.9 FM (MHz) and The Breeze broadcasts on 107.3 FM (MHz) from Mt Oxley, Bourke. Both stations are part of the Rebel Media group. ABC radio broadcasts on both the FM and AM bands and is pivotal to maintaining rural and community ties in the area. There are two regional community radio stations based in Bourke. 2WEB broadcasts with 10,000 watts on 585 AM. 2CUZ FM is the regional Indigenous radio station in Bourke. It broadcasts locally on 106.5 FM. Both station broadcast to a myriad of communities in the region. The local paper, The Western Herald, is published on a weekly basis (every Thursday) year-round, except during a short break at Christmas.

He was the principal owner of the Toronto Shamrocks and the Toronto Blueshirts professional ice hockey clubs of the National Hockey Association (NHA), where his battles with his fellow owners led them to create the National Hockey League. Early years Livingstone was born in Toronto, Ontario to David and Ruth Livingstone, the youngest of three children. He played junior and intermediate ice hockey with the St. George's Club in Toronto, before becoming an Ontario Hockey Association referee. He also covered ice hockey for the Toronto Mail and Empire, often reporting on the games he refereed. Livingstone became manager of ice hockey and football at the Toronto Rugby and Athletic Association (TR & AA). The club, formed after a split from the Toronto Amateur Athletic Club, competed in the Ontario Hockey Association and won the John Ross Robertson Trophy as senior ice hockey champions of Ontario in 1913 and 1914. National Hockey Association His success in amateur hockey prompted Livingstone to make the jump to the professional game by buying the struggling Toronto Ontarios of the National Hockey Association (NHA). During the 1914-15 season, the Ontarios traded in their orange sweaters for green and were renamed the Toronto Shamrocks. The team skated to a record of 7 wins and 13 losses, an improvement of three games over the 1913-14 campaign. During the 1914-15 season, on February 3, 1915, Sammy Lichtenhein's Montreal Wanderers were awarded a game by forfeit over the Shamrocks. The Shamrocks had told the league that they could not put a full team on the ice without George McNamara and Howard McNamara, who were at the bedside of their ill father. Livingstone asked for a postponement, but Lichtenhein refused and the league ruled the game forfeited. In a gesture of sportsmanship, Lichtenhein then made an offer to reschedule the game and play the Shamrocks on March 6, 1915. Shortly after, with the Wanderers and Ottawa in a tight two-way race for the league championship, Livingstone demanded that Lichtenhein follow through on his offer to play the forfeited game. Lichtenhein was incensed and threatened to have Livingstone thrown out of the NHA. The Wanderers and Ottawa ended the season tied for first place. The NHA executive met on March 4 and decided to recognize the forfeit and not order the Wanderers to play the Shamrocks (the Wanderers were told to pay the Shamrocks $300‚Äîthe amount they saved by not having to travel to Toronto in February). Instead, a two-game, total-goals series was scheduled between Montreal and Ottawa to determine the champion. The league also rejected Lichtenhein's request to have Livingstone expelled from the NHA. Livingstone and Lichtenhein would continue to feud for years. At one meeting during the 1916-17 campaign, Lichtenhein grew so infuriated that he offered Livingstone $3,000 to abandon his team. Livingstone countered with a $5,000 bid for Lichtenhein to shut down his Wanderers. Before the 1915-16 season, Frank Robinson sold the Toronto Blueshirts ‚Äî the NHA's other Toronto franchise ‚Äî to Livingstone. The NHA did not want one owner to have two clubs in the league, and Livingstone said that he would sell the Shamrocks. But Frank Patrick and Lester Patrick of the Pacific Coast Hockey Association, who had accused the NHA of reneging on an agreement with their league, raided the Blueshirts and signed away most of the team's players. To fill the holes in his lineup, Livingstone transferred Shamrocks players to the Blueshirts, but that left him with little to sell in the Shamrocks. When he had not sold the team by the November 20, 1915, deadline set by the league, the NHA seized the franchise and kept it dormant for the season. Before the season began, Livingstone argued with the owners of Arena Gardens over the terms for the use of their facility and threatened to move his team to Boston. The NHA said that it would not allow the move. During the 1915‚Äì16 season, Livingstone is credited with fielding the first two-line forward team in a game between Toronto and Ottawa. The 1916-17 campaign was a stormy one for the NHA. Canada intensified its contribution to World War I, and a number of pro and amateur hockey players volunteered for military service. The 228th (Northern Fusiliers) Battalion, CEF of the Canadian infantry formed a team in the NHA, taking the place of the suspended Toronto Shamrocks franchise and sharing Arena Gardens with the Blueshirts. Meanwhile, Livingstone lost several of his Blueshirts to the war effort: Harry Cameron, George McNamara, Howard McNamara, and Percy LeSueur. Keats had also joined the 228th, and Livingstone protested to the league about the loss of his star player. The two clubs eventually reached an agreement where Keats was returned to the Blueshirts in exchange for the right to use LeSueur. Another of Livingstone's stars, Cy Denneny, had found full-time employment with the government in Ottawa and told the team that they could either trade him to Ottawa or he would sit out the season. Livingstone said that he would not accept anyone but Frank Nighbor in a trade, or Ottawa could buy Denneny for $1,800‚Äîmore than double the NHA record for a player sale. He then suspended Denneny in November for refusing to report. Livingstone also offered to take goaltender Clint Benedict for Denneny, but that offer was also rejected by Ottawa. Late in January 1917, it seemed that Livingstone had traded Denneny to the Montreal Wanderers for goaltender Billy Hague‚ÄîDenneny even signed an agreement with Montreal‚Äîbut Livingstone backed out of the deal with his nemesis Sammy Lichtenhein. Livingstone ultimately capitulated and sold Denneny to Ottawa, but not before raising the ire of Tommy Gorman in Ottawa and Lichtenhein in Montreal. The Globe was not against the removal of Livingstone, in this editorial of February 13, 1917. Expulsion from NHA On February 8, 1917, the 228th Battalion got its orders to proceed overseas and withdrew its teams from the OHA and the NHA. Three days later, NHA owners‚Äîat a meeting that did not include Livingstone‚Äîvoted to suspend the Blueshirts franchise to keep the number of teams in the league even. Toronto players were put in a lottery and claimed by other teams, although they were to be returned to Toronto when the franchise was reinstated. On February 13, Livingstone issued a statement that he was through with the NHA and that the Blueshirts franchise was available to the highest bidder. Livingstone was going to work on the opening of several arenas and a new hockey league in the United States. Livingstone filed suit against the league and the other owners, and applied for a court injunction to prevent them from moving the remaining teams out of the league. In October 1917, Quebec Bulldogs manager Mike Quinn told the Quebec Telegraph that the Toronto club had been given three weeks to separate itself from Livingstone with the threat that the other owners would operate without Toronto if the club did not comply. There was no response by the deadline. At its annual meeting in November 1917, the NHA announced that it was suspending operations because of the difficulties in running a five-team league and the player shortages introduced by conscription in Canada during the off-season. About a week later, all of the owners other than Livingstone announced that they had formed a new league, the National Hockey League. Livingstone was shut out of the new league, but the NHL retained the contracts of the Toronto franchise players. The Arena Company was awarded a temporary NHL franchise for Toronto and was assigned Livingstone's players for the NHL's inaugural 1917-18 season on an undetermined 'lease' basis. The club‚Äîwhich the press and fans called the \\"Torontos\\" or \\"Blueshirts\\"‚Äîwould have a successful season, and won the Stanley Cup. The Arena Company did not pay for the players and Livingstone filed suit for the revenue earned with the players, now inflated by the Cup success. In 1918, Livingstone and Percy Quinn attempted to force the NHA to restart by forcing a shareholder's meeting, where he hoped that the minority position of the Brunswick Company in the Montreal Canadiens would disallow their vote and swing the vote his way. The NHA owners shot down the plan at what would be the final meeting of the NHA owners in December 1918, voting instead to permanently suspend the NHA, although the organization could not fold completely while it had ongoing legal actions pending against the Canadian military. Legal battles with the Arena Having been cast aside by his former business associates, Livingstone spent the next several years in court, in a bid to be compensated for the loss of his franchise and his players. In February 1918, the courts ruled that the NHA and its owners had not acted improperly in suspending operations of Livingstone's Toronto Hockey Club. The decision was appealed and upheld by the Supreme Court of Canada on November 19, 1919. Mounting legal bills from the dispute forced the Arenas to sell most of their stars, resulting in a horrendous five-win season in 1918-19\\\\. The Arenas were forced to suspend operations after their 18th game. While this legal action was playing out, the Arena Company returned its temporary franchise to the NHL, but refused to return Livingstone's players to him for the 1918-19 season. Instead, it formed a new team, the Toronto Arena Hockey Club‚Äîpopularly known as the Toronto Arenas, with Gardens auditor Hubert Vearncombe as team president. This new team was a self-contained corporation that could exist separately from any legal action, and was thus beyond the reach of Livingstone. The newly-minted Arenas were readily admitted to the NHL as a full member in good standing, and continued to use Livingstone's players. This resulted in another lawsuit being filed, this one against Arena Gardens, Vearncombe and Arena Hockey Club general manager Charlie Querrie. Arena Gardens argued that Livingstone did not own the NHL rights to the players and could not have suffered any damages. The court ruled in Livingstone's favour in January 1920 and awarded $20,000 in damages back-dated to April 1918, but the issue was not settled. Before the end of the year, under the weight of the judgment against it, Arena Gardens went into receivership. Meanwhile, the Arena Hockey Club was sold to a group headed by Querrie, who renamed it the Toronto St. Patricks. In October 1923, a ruling was made that Arena Gardens had abused its position as a trustee of the assets of the Toronto Hockey Club‚Äîits player contracts‚Äîand finding damages of $100,000 in favour of Livingstone. That still was not the end, as the damages were later reduced to $10,000 and that decision was also appealed‚Äîall the way to the privy council, which dismissed the appeal in July 1926. Attempts to launch rival leagues When the rights to his players reverted to him in 1918, Livingstone announced plans to launch the Canadian Hockey Association as a rival to the NHL. The league would include the former NHA team from Quebec, now owned by Percy Quinn, the founding president of the Toronto Hockey Club. Livingstone also received support from Tom Wall, the former owner of the Toronto Ontarios. In the summer of 1920, there was again talk that the Livingstone might get the CHA off the ground, particularly after Percy Quinn was made managing director of Arena Gardens on June 17. Livingstone was looking at starting an international hockey league with franchises in the U.S. and Canada. But the CHA was again thwarted when the NHL moved its struggling Quebec franchise to Hamilton, Ontario which Livingstone had targeted as a prime market. In 1924, Livingstone again announced that he was forming an international league that would have teams in Toronto, Ottawa, New York, Brooklyn, and Buffalo. It was never launched. In February 1926, Livingstone announced the creation of the International Professional Hockey League, of which he was president. The IPHL was to have teams in Toronto, Buffalo, and Detroit, and two teams in both New York and Chicago. Nothing ever came of the league. American Hockey Association In 1926, Livingstone acquired an American Hockey Association franchise for Chicago, the Chicago Cardinals. He negotiated a deal to play at the Chicago Coliseum, the same arena that the fledgling Chicago Black Hawks of the National Hockey League used for its home games. In March 1927, Livingstone tried to sell the team to Harry Herendeen, a Chicago miller, but the league did not approve the transfer. Late in the season, the Coliseum refused to give Livingstone's team ice time, citing non-payment of rent. Livingstone said the rejected new club owner had agreed to pay the rent. After the 1926-27 season, the AHA wanted to negotiate a new agreement with the NHL, setting out the rules for how the leagues would work together. NHL president Frank Calder threatened not to sign an agreement while the AHA was working with Livingstone. On August 24, 1927, the AHA terminated Livingstone's membership in the league. When Livingstone tried to sell the franchise, he was told that he did not have one to sell and that four of his players (including Marvin Wentworth, who would play 13 seasons in the NHL) were now the property of the Blackhawks. He filed suit against Frederic McLaughlin, owner of the Blackhawks, charging him with tampering with his players and in December 1927 filed a $700,000 lawsuit against Calder and three AHA executives claiming that his team was taken away from him through a conspiracy. Ontario Hockey Association Livingstone returned to Toronto and gave up professional hockey for the amateur game. In 1929-30, he started coaching the Toronto Victorias junior team in the Ontario Hockey Association. Starting in the 1931-32 season, the team was affiliated with the Lions Club and renamed the Toronto Lions. They played at Maple Leaf Gardens. Even there, controversy followed him. In November 1933, the OHA ordered three of his players to play with their high school teams for the 1933-34 season. Livingstone charged that the move was taken deliberately against him. In the 1934-35 season, his players included future hall-of-famer Gordie Drillon. He continued to coach the team through the 1938-39 season. Livingstone outlived his enemies Frank Calder, who died in 1943, and Fred McLaughlin, who died in 1944. Livingstone died the day before his 61st birthday in 1945.

He was a cousin of Edmund Burke and spent school and university holidays at Burke's home, and thus acquired some influential friends. He joined the British Army as an ensign in the Grenadier Guards on 22 November 1798, serving in the Netherlands with the Duke of York before a posting in South America in 1807, where he participated in the siege and storming of Montevideo. He was promoted to major general in 1821. He retired from the army after the Peninsular War to live on his Irish estate, but eventually sought government office to increase his income. He was appointed to the Cape Colony and was promoted to Lieutenant-Governor of the Eastern District of the Cape of Good Hope, acting as governor for both the eastern and western districts. Under Bourke's governorship, much was done to reform the old mercantilist system of government inherited from the Dutch East India Company at the Cape. Public life Bourke was an avowed Whig. In November 1830, the Whigs won government in a climate of reform. Major-General Bourke was appointed to succeed Sir Ralph Darling, who was also Irish-born, as Governor of New South Wales in 1831. Bourke proved to be an able, if controversial, governor. In most of his efforts, he faced entrenched opposition from the local conservatives: the 'exclusive' faction in the New South Wales Legislative Council, and the Colonial Secretary Alexander Mcleay and the Colonial Treasurer Campbell Riddell. The newspaper The Sydney Morning Herald always opposed him. (The exclusives were hostile to the participation of ex-convicts ('emancipists') in civil life, hence were opposed to changes which moved the colony from military to civil governance.) Bourke described himself as being \\"pretty much in the situation that Earl Grey would find himself in if all members of his Cabinet were Ultra Tories and he could neither turn them out nor leave them\\". Bourke had authority from the Colonial Office to extend trial by jury and substitute civil for military juries in criminal cases. He managed this despite fierce opposition from the legislature, and his 1833 bill for the extension of juries was only passed with his casting vote and with conservative amendments. A statue of General Sir Richard Bourke, the first public statue ever erected in Australia, stands outside the State Library of New South Wales in Sydney. Appalled by the excessive punishments doled out to convicts, Governor Bourke initiated the Magistrates Act, which simplified existing regulations and limited the sentence a magistrate could pass to 50 lashes (previously no such limit existed). The bill was passed by the legislature because Bourke presented evidence that magistrates were exceeding their powers and passing illegal sentences, in part because regulations were complex and confusing. However, furious magistrates and employers petitioned the crown against this interference with their legal rights, fearing that a reduction in punishments would cease to provide enough deterrence to the convicts, and this issue was exploited by his opponents. In 1835, Bourke issued a proclamation through the Colonial Office, implementing the doctrine of terra nullius by proclaiming that Indigenous Australians could not sell or assign land, nor could an individual person acquire it, other than through distribution by the Crown. Bourke continued to create controversy within the colony by combating the inhumane treatment handed out to convicts, including limiting the number of convicts each employer was allowed to 70, as well as granting rights to emancipists, such as allowing the acquisition of property and service on juries. It has been argued that the abolition of convict transportation to New South Wales in 1840http://www.tocal.com/homestead/vandv/vv40.htm can be attributable to the actions of Bourke. Bourke abolished the status of the Anglican Church as the state church of New South Wales, declaring each religious denomination on equal footing before the law. He also increased spending on education and attempted to set up a system of public nondenominational schools. He was credited as the first governor to publish satisfactory accounts of public receipts and expenditures. In 1837, the year of his promotion to lieutenant-general, he was made colonel for life of the 64th (2nd Staffordshire) Regiment of Foot. The same year, he named the town of Melbourne after The 2nd Viscount Melbourne, the British Prime Minister. Bourke Street in Melbourne's central business district and the town of Bourke were named after him. The County of Bourke, Victoria, which includes Melbourne, and Bourke County, New South Wales, were also named after him. Elizabeth Street, Melbourne, is generally considered to be named in honour of his wife. The bronze statue of Bourke outside the State Library of New South Wales in Sydney was the first public statue ever erected in Australia. It was dedicated on 11 April 1842.Monument Australia.

Trustee savings banks originated to accept savings deposits from those with moderate means. Their shares were not traded on the stock market but, unlike with mutually held building societies, depositors had no voting rights; nor did they have the power to direct the financial and managerial goals of the organisation. Directors were appointed as trustees (hence the name) on a voluntary basis. The first trustee savings bank was established by Reverend Henry Duncan of Ruthwell in Dumfriesshire for his poorest parishioners in 1810, with its sole purpose being to serve the local people in the community. Between 1970 and 1985, the various trustee savings banks in the United Kingdom were amalgamated into a single institution named TSB Group plc, which was floated on the London Stock Exchange. In 1995, the TSB merged with Lloyds Bank to form Lloyds TSB, at that point the largest bank in the UK by market share and the second-largest (to HSBC, which had taken over the Midland Bank in 1992) by market capitalisation. In 2009, following its acquisition of HBOS, Lloyds TSB Group was renamed Lloyds Banking Group,http://www.mediacentre.lloydstsb.com/media/pdf_irmc/mc/press_releases/2009/January/1409pressrelease.pdf?WT.ac=MHPLNCON although the TSB initials initially survived in the names of its principal retail subsidiaries, Lloyds TSB Bank and Lloyds TSB Scotland. In July 2012 however, it was announced that the TSB brand would be resurrected by Lloyds Banking Group for the 632 branches it would divest as a separate business. The new TSB Bank began operations in September 2013 and was divested via an initial public offering in 2014, with the remainder of the business reverting to the Lloyds Bank name. History The Birmingham branch on Broad Street, originally the Birmingham Municipal Bank, designed by Thomas Cecil Howitt and opened by the Prince George in 1933. Early history of the trustee savings banks From the outset, savings banks were retail finance institutions set up under democratic and philanthropic principles. They sought to create thrifty habits amongst small and medium-sized savers such as craftsmen, domestic servants or the growing proletariat, who were outside the well-to-do market that the commercial banks served. In the first half of the 19th century, bank runs or bank collapses were common, so savings banks had no safe outlet for their own deposits.http://mpra.ub.uni- muenchen.de/804/1/MPRA_paper_804.pdf To create trust among potential depositors, the Savings Bank (England) Act 1817 required funds to be invested in government bonds or deposited at the Bank of England.Lawton, C. L. (November 1950). \\"Trustees Savings Banks in the Twentieth Century.\\" Bankers' Magazine This requirement was extended to Scottish savings banks in 1835. From then on, regulation of savings banks in the UK was quite detailed, with several periods of ‚Äúill-health‚Äù and lack of trust in their capacity resulting in government intervention in most aspects of the operation and day-to-day management of savings banks, particularly the nature of their investment portfolios.Horne, H. O. (1947). A History of Savings Banks. London, Oxford University Press An essential feature of a savings bank in the UK was that depositors should have a guarantee of the nominal value of their savings, so that these could be withdrawn at their full value with interest no matter how long the deposit. Funds would be under control of voluntary managers or trustees, hence the roots of the name. This guarantee could not be achieved unless funds were held in securities with a similar guarantee. As a result of the 1817 Act all money received by trustee savings banks, other than that needed to deal with everyday transactions, was held by the Bank of England to the credit of the National Debt Commissioners. The Act specified duties of the treasurers, managers and trustees of the savings banks, none of whom was to derive any benefit from their office. This feature was to dominate the management of the TSBs until the 1970s. Savings banks paying interest on deposits (at a rate ranging from 3% to 5%) proliferated. The number of successful institutions in the UK grew until there were 645 in 1861. Their business remained in collecting low-volume deposits, as early attempts at market diversification had been curtailed by the Savings Bank Act 1891. Modern history of the trustee savings banks By the inter-war years it had become clear that trustee savings banks could compete in the retail bank market. By 1919 the sum of cash and assets held on deposit for all the TSBs reached ¬£100 million, which rose to ¬£162 million in 1929 and ¬£292 million in 1939. From the 1970s the Irish trustee savings banks followed a similar path of amalgamation to their UK counterparts, becoming, in 1992, a single entity; this was purchased by Irish Life and Permanent in 2002. Together, the TSBs were as big as any of the four main London clearing banks. There was little competition between the various trustee savings banks. Each individual trustee savings bank served a separate geographic area, although other organisations competed with them, and this competition grew stronger after 1945. In 1955, inter-savings-bank clearing was extended to the whole country. Such a system had been in operation in Surrey in the south of England for a short time, and it had been proven successful in helping to settle transactions between different savings banks and in improving the service to clients (particularly when on holiday within the UK). Also in 1955, increased competition for deposits (and most notably the growing popularity of hire purchase) led to calls for the Trustee Savings Banks Association to ask the Exchequer and the National Debt Commissioners to allow withdrawals by cheque (as originally proposed in 1926 by W.A. Barclay of the Perth Savings Bank). In 1965 a review of retail credit markets led to the trustee savings banks being allowed to issue current accounts (with cheque withdrawals but no overdraft facilities), undertake the payment of utility bills, and safeguard securities and valuables.Pringle, R. (1973). Banking in Britain. London, Charles Knight & Co. Accordingly, the TSB Trust Company was established in 1967 and a year later the first unit trust issue was offered. Regulatory innovations which allowed the TSBs to diversify their business threatened to erode the deposit base of the clearing banks. But this potential diversification was limited by the restrictive central control of the Exchequer, the National Debt Commissioners and the Trustee Savings Bank Inspection Committee. This type of central control had been designed both to guarantee depositors that the savings banks would remain a secure alternative for their deposits and, by standardising general interest rates and regulations, to make it possible for local trustees to work autonomously. By the early 1960s transactions at retail counters were increasing at around 5% per annum. In 1964 the London Trustee Savings Bank was the first to computerise standing orders, and all account records were put on computer by 1967 ‚Äì this being the first UK bank to do so. Some other savings banks still worked with leather-bound ledgers, and others used passbooks; either way handwritten record cards piled up in thousands and even the most basic management information and accounting (such as the annual balance sheet) was a huge task to compile, requiring a lot of overtime. The savings banks' administration was thus antiquated and time-consuming. They needed modernization and streamlining.  Amalgamation into a single entity Lombard Street headquarters in the City of London. In 1970 there were 75 savings banks in a loose association, with ¬£2,806 million in total assets. There was a wide variation in size: five of the banks each had over ¬£100m in assets (together accounting for 25% of the total), 14 had between ¬£50m and ¬£100m (35%), 39 between ¬£10m and ¬£50m (38%) and 17 under ¬£10m (2%). The largest trustee savings banks were based in London, Glasgow, Edinburgh and Belfast. Those based in the north of England accounted for 50% of total funds, while those in the south of England and Wales accounted for 27%, those in Scotland for 19% and those in Northern Ireland for less than 5%. Geographical location of the 1,655 trustee savings bank branches was also unevenly distributed, with branch density higher in parts of Scotland and the north of England. In 1978 there was one savings bank branch per 18,000 persons in Scotland, but only one per 75,000 persons in London. There was a similar pattern for individual accounts, with two out of five persons in Scotland having an account at a trustee savings bank, one out of five in the north of England, but only one out of twenty in London and the Home Counties.Revell, J. (1973). The British Financial System. London, Macmillan In 1973 at the time of the report by the Page Committee, there were still 73 TSBs and 1,549 branch offices. Eight years had passed since the introduction of cheque accounts. The TSBs sensed the need to respond to changing customer needs.Marshall, I. (1985). \\"Strategic Issues for the Trustees Savings Banks.\\" Long Range Planning 18(4): 39-43 However some individual TSBs had grown faster than others. The assets of the Scottish TSBs, traditionally the strongest members of the TSB movement, had been growing more slowly than those in Lancashire, Yorkshire, the Midlands, Wales and the West Country, which had built up enviable reserves and were anxious to protect their territories. London and southern England remained the areas where the savings banks had little presence. While savings banks and government were considering the movement's future organisational structure and functions as well as those of individual TSBs, the TSBs remained restricted in what services they could offer: they could not give loans to their customers, and there were still limits on how funds could be invested. At this critical stage, the Page Committee recommended that the TSBs be freed from government control, allowed to develop their service range, and thus become a third force in banking. These recommendations were high on the agenda of the newly elected government of Harold Wilson. But the pace of change was to be slow. Officials at the Bank of England, with the support of Sir Athelstan Car√∂e, then chairman of the Trustee Savings Banks Association, called for the establishment of a strong central authority to assume many of the control powers vested in the government, bearing in mind the need to build up adequate capital reserves virtually from scratch. For the government, there was an advantage in widening the TSBs' investment powers only slowly, not least the threat of competition to its own newly created bank, National Girobank. TSBs actively computerised their administration. Two companies were set up in 1972 in preparation for future change: TSB Computer Services Ltd., co-ordinated all computer systems and related developments, and Central Trustee Savings Bank Ltd. dealt with volume transactions.Moss, M. and Russell, I. (1994). An Invaluable Treasure: A History of the TSB. London, Weidenfeld and Nicolson The Trustee Savings Banks Act in 1975 allowed TSBs to offer services equivalent to those of the clearing banks, but it also required that, in the space of one year, the number of independent TSBs was reduced from 73 to 19, under the central co-ordinating authority of the TSB Central Board. This organisational framework for savings banks was in place between 1976 and 1984, a period during which TSB management undertook a series of fundamental changes while pursuing the creation of independent and profitable financial services group. Tom Bryans, general manager of the Northern Ireland Trustee Savings Bank, was the first chief executive of the newly amalgamated trustee savings banks. He was in his mid-50s, and had spent all his working life at the TSB movement, becoming a manager in 1956 and then becoming an expert in computerised banking. Bryans took the helm with a mandate to turn the savings banks from a quasi-government body into successful independent providers, but his salary of ¬£17,000 per annum was well below those paid at similar posts at clearing banks. The amalgamation of individual TSBs into purposely created regional banks and the establishment of a central board in 1975 provided the resources to support the introduction of personal lending in 1977. However, attempts to diversify across retail bank markets failed. Together with the National Giro Bank and the Co-operative Bank, the efforts of the TSBs to penetrate retail finance from scratch in 1971 resulted in only ¬£200m in direct consumer loans in 1979, which accounted for less than 3% of total consumer lending that year. In 1984, the government published a White Paper and a new TSB Bill, in which the quasi-federal decentralised structure was abandoned in favour of a single central organisation that no longer had a unique corporate status but was incorporated under the Companies Act 1985. The purported aim was to give the TSB Group plc, as it was called, a more effective operating structure and also to establish clear ground rules on ownership and accountability, neither of which was clear under former legislation. Airdrie Savings Bank refused to join the single entity, and remained the only independent such bank in the UK until it announced its closure in 2017. In 1984, TSB adopted an advertising slogan by which it is still generally remembered today: \\"The Bank That Likes To Say Yes\\". In 1986, the Central Trustee Savings Bank Limited was renamed TSB England and Wales plcRegistered in England No. 01089268 and Trustee Savings Bank plc was renamed TSB Scotland plc.Registered in Scotland No. SC095237 Flotation In 1986, the shares of TSB Group plc were floated on the stock market and the proceeds given to the bank, adding to the ownership equity ‚Äì a process described by one commentator as \\"selling people a gold box in such a way that when they opened it they found the purchase price inside\\".BBC Radio 4 Today programme, 25 April 2013.

Registered in England No. 1396057 The newly formed TSB Group's retail banking operations were consolidated into TSB England and Wales, TSB Scotland, TSB Northern Ireland and TSB Channel Islands, each trading as TSB Bank. In 1989, TSB England and Wales officially became TSB Bank, with TSB Bank Scotland and TSB Bank Northern Ireland becoming its subsidiary undertakings. The Northern Irish business was sold to Allied Irish Banks in 1991 and now trades as First Trust Bank and the Channel Islands business was integrated into TSB Bank in 1992. Merger with Lloyds Bank TSB Group merged with Lloyds Bank in 1995 to form Lloyds TSB. The merger was structured as a reverse takeover by TSB; Lloyds Bank plc was delisted from the London Stock Exchange and TSB Group plc was renamed Lloyds TSB Group plc on 28 December, with former Lloyds Bank shareholders owning a 70% equity interest in the share capital, effected through a scheme of arrangement. The new bank commenced trading in 1999, after the statutory process of integration was completed.Lloyds TSB Act 1998 (cap. 5) On 28 June, TSB Bank plc transferred engagements to Lloyds Bank plc which then changed its name to Lloyds TSB Bank plc; at the same time, TSB Bank Scotland plc absorbed Lloyds' three Scottish branches becoming Lloyds TSB Scotland plc. The combined business formed the largest bank in the UK by market share and the second-largest to Midland Bank (now HSBC) by market capitalisation. Revival of the TSB brand Following its acquisition of HBOS in January 2009, Lloyds TSB Group was renamed Lloyds Banking Group. In 2009, following the UK bank rescue package, HM Government took a 43.4% stake in Lloyds Banking Group, which later announced that, in order to comply with European Union state aid requirements, it would spin off a part of its business under the TSB brand. The new TSB business consists of all Lloyds TSB Scotland branches, all Cheltenham and Gloucester branches, and some Lloyds TSB branches in England and Wales.http://webcasts.lloydsbankinggroup.com/capitalraising/files/FINAL_- _Analyst_Presentation.pdfhttp://www.lloydsbankinggroup.com/media/pdfs/lbg/2010/9910pressrelease.pdf After a provisional agreement to sell the Lloyds TSB Scotland business to Co- operative Banking Group fell through in early 2013, Lloyds decided to divest it through a stock market flotation. The new TSB Bank began operations on 9 September 2013, at which time the remainder of Lloyds TSB was renamed to Lloyds Bank.

Until 110 BCE, it was integrated into the Qatabanian kingdom, afterwards being recognized as an independent kingdom. According to classical sources, their capital was the ancient city of Zafar, relatively near the modern-day city of Sana'a. Himyarite power eventually shifted to Sana‚Äôa as the population increased in the fifth century. After the establishment of their kingdom, it was ruled by kings from dh≈´-RaydƒÅn tribe.

Its political fortunes relative to Saba' changed frequently until it finally conquered the Sabaean Kingdom around 280.See, e.g., Bafaqih 1990. Himyar then endured until it finally fell to invaders from the Kingdom of Aksum in 525 CE. The Himyarites originally worshiped most of the South-Arabian pantheon, including Wadd,  øAthtar, 'Amm and Almaqah. Since at least the reign of Abikarib As øad (c. 384 to 433 CE), Judaism was adopted as the de-facto state religion. The religion may have been adopted to some extent as much as two centuries earlier, but inscriptions to polytheistic deities ceased after this date. It was embraced initially by the upper classes, and possibly a large proportion of the general population over time.  History  The ·∏§imyarite Kingdom maintained nominal control in Arabia until 525. Its economy was based on agriculture, and foreign trade centered on the export of frankincense and myrrh. For many years, the kingdom was also the major intermediary linking East Africa and the Mediterranean world. This trade largely consisted of exporting ivory from Africa to be sold in the Roman Empire. Ships from ·∏§imyar regularly travelled the East African coast, and the state also exerted a large amount of Influence both cultural, religious and political over the trading cities of East Africa whilst the cities of East Africa remained independent. The Periplus of the Erythraean Sea describes the trading empire of Himyar and its ruler \\"Charibael\\" (probably Karab'il Watar Yuhan'emII), who is said to have been on friendly terms with Rome:  Early period (115 BC until 300 AD)  The \\"Homerite Kingdom\\" is described in the southern tip of the Arabian peninsula in the 1st century Periplus of the Erythraean Sea. During this period, the Kingdom of ·∏§imyar conquered the kingdoms of Saba' and Qataban and took Raydan/Zafar for its capital instead of Ma'rib; therefore, they have been called Dhu Raydan (Arabic: ÿ∞Ÿà ÿ±ŸäÿØÿßŸÜ). In the early 2nd century AD Saba' and Qataban split from the Kingdom of ·∏§imyar; yet in a few decades Qataban was conquered by Hadhramaut (conquered in its turn by ·∏§imyar in the 4th century), whereas Saba' was finally conquered by ·∏§imyar in the late 3rd century.Korotayev A.

This date marks the end of an era in which numerous inscriptions record the names and deeds of kings, and dedicate buildings to local (e.g. Wagal and Simyada) and major (e.g. Almaqah) gods. From the 380s, temples were abandoned and dedications to the old gods ceased, replaced by references to Rahmanan, \\"the Lord of Heaven\\" or \\"Lord of Heaven and Earth\\".Norbert Nebes, 'The Martyrs of NajrƒÅn and End of the ·∏§imyar: On the Political History of South Arabia in the Early Sixth Century,' the Angelika Neuwirth, Nicolai Sinai, Michael Marx (eds.), The Qur'ƒÅn in Context: Historical and Literary Investigations Into the Qur'ƒÅnic Milieu, BRILL 2010 pp.27-60, p.43. The political context for this conversion may have been Arabia's interest in maintaining neutrality and good trade relations with the competing empires of Byzantium, which first adopted Christianity under Constantine the Great and the Sasanian Empire, which alternated between Zurvanism and Manichaeism.\\"The Jewish Kingdom of Himyar (Yemen): Its Rise and Fall,\\" by Jacob Adler, Midstream, May/June 2000, Volume XXXXVI No. 4 One of the first Jewish kings, Tub'a Abu Kariba As'ad (r. 390‚Äì420), is believed to have converted following a military expedition into northern Arabia in an effort to eliminate Byzantine influence. The Byzantine emperors had long eyed the Arabian Peninsula and sought to control the lucrative spice trade and route to India. The Byzantines hoped to establish a protectorate by converting the inhabitants to Christianity. Some progress had been made in northern Arabia but they had little success in ·∏§imyar. Abu- Kariba's forces reached Yathrib and, meeting no resistance, they passed through the city, leaving the king's son behind as governor. Abu-Kariba soon received news that the people of Yathrib had killed his son. He turned back in order to wreak vengeance on the city. After cutting down the palm trees from which the inhabitants derived their main income, he laid siege to the city. The Jews of Yathrib fought side by side with their pagan neighbors. During the siege Abu-Kariba fell severely ill. Two Jewish scholars in Yathrib, Ka'ab and Asad by name, called on the king in his camp and used their knowledge of medicine to restore him to health. While attending the king, they pleaded with him to lift the siege and make peace. The sages' appeal is said to have persuaded Abu-Kariba; he called off his attack and also embraced Judaism along with his entire army. At his insistence, the two Jewish scholars accompanied the ·∏§imyarite king back to his capital, where he demanded that all his people convert to Judaism. Initially, there was great resistance. After an ordeal had justified the king's demand and confirmed the truth of the Jewish faith, many Himyarites supported Judaism. Some historians argue that the people were not motivated by politics, but that Judaism, by its philosophical, simplistic, and austere nature, was attractive to the nature of the Semitic people.P. Yule, Himyar Sp√§tantike im Jemen, Late Antique Yemen, Aichwald, 2007, p. 98-99 Abu- Kariba continued to engage in military campaigns and met his death under unclear circumstances. Some scholars believe that his own soldiers killed him. He left three sons, ·∏§asan, 'Amru, and Zorah, all of whom were minors at the time. After Abu-Kariba's demise, a pagan named Dh≈´-Shanatir seized the throne. In the reign of Subahbi'il Yakkaf, Azqir, the son of Abu Karib Assad and serving as a Christian missionary from NajrƒÅn, was put to death after he had erected a chapel with a cross. Christian sources interpret the event as a martyrdom at Jewish hands: the site for his execution, NajrƒÅn, was said to have been chosen on the advice of a rabbi,Shlomo Sand, The Invention of the Jewish People, Verso 2009 p.194. but indigenous sources do not mention persecutions on the grounds of faith. His death may have been intended to deter the extension of Byzantine influence.Robert Hoyland,Arabia and the Arabs: From the Bronze Age to the Coming of Islam, Routledge, 2001, p.51. The first Aksumite invasion took place sometime in the 5th century and was triggered by the persecution of Christians. Two Christian sources, including the Zuqnin Chronicle once attributed to Dionysius I Telmaharoyo, which was written more than three centuries later, say that the Himyarite king prompted the killings by stating, \\"This is because in the countries of the Romans the Christians wickedly harass the Jews who live in their countries and kill many of them. Therefore I am putting these men to death.\\"Christopher Haas, 'Geopolitics and Georgian Identity in Late Antiquity: The Dangerous World of Vakhtang Gorgasali,' in Tamar Nutsubidze, Cornelia B. Horn, Basil Louri√©(eds.),Georgian Christian Thought and Its Cultural Context, BRILL pp.29-44, p.39. In retaliation the Aksumites invaded the land and thereafter established a bishopric and built Christian churches in Zafar. The Jewish monarchy in ·∏§imyar ended with the reign of Y·π≥suf, known as Dh≈´ NuwƒÅs, who, in 523, persecuted the Himyarite Christian population of NajrƒÅn.G.W. Bowersock, The Rise and Fall of a Jewish Kingdom in Arabia, Institute for Advanced Studies, Princeton, 2011, ; The Adulis Throne, Oxford University Press, in press. By the year 500, on the eve of the regency of Marthad'ƒ´lƒÅn Yan≈´f (c. 500-515) the kingdom of Himyar exercised control over much of the Arabian peninsula.Christian Julien Robin,'Arabia and Ethiopia,'in Scott Johnson (ed.) The Oxford Handbook of Late Antiquity, Oxford University Press, 2012, pp.247-333.p.282 It was during his reign that the Himyarite kingdom began to become a tributary state of Aksum, the process concluding by the time of the reign of Ma'dƒ´karib Yafur (519‚Äì522), a Christian appointed by the Aksumites. A coup d'√©tat ensued, with Dhu Nuwas, who had attempted to overthrow the dynasty several years earlier, assuming authority after killing the Aksumite garrison in ZafƒÅr. He proceeded to engage the Ethiopian guards, and their Christian allies in the TihƒÅma coastal lowlands facing Abyssinia. After taking the port of MukhawƒÅn, where he burnt down the local church, he advanced south as far as the fortress of MaddabƒÅn overlooking the Bab-el-Mandeb, where he expected Kaleb Ella A·π£be·∏•a to land his fleet. The campaign eventually killed between 11,500 and 14,000, and took a similar number of prisoners. MukhawƒÅn became his base, while he dispatched one of his generals, a Jewish prince named Shara·∏•'ƒ´l Yaqbul dhu Yaz'an, against NajrƒÅn, a predominantly Christian oasis, with a good number of Jews, who had supported with troops his earlier rebellion, but refused to recognize his authority after the massacre of the Aksumite garrison. The general blocked the caravan route connecting NajrƒÅn with Eastern Arabia. Religious culture During this period, references to pagan gods disappeared from royal inscriptions and texts on public buildings, and were replaced by references to a single deity. Inscriptions in the Sabean language, and sometimes Hebrew, called this deity Rahman (the Merciful), ‚ÄúLord of the Heavens and Earth,‚Äù the ‚ÄúGod of Israel‚Äù and ‚ÄúLord of the Jews.‚Äù Prayers invoking Rahman's blessings on the ‚Äúpeople of Israel‚Äù often ended with the Hebrew words shalom and amen. There is evidence that the solar goddess Shams was especially favoured in Himyar, being the national goddess and possibly an ancestral deity.J. F. Breton (Trans.

This is an imitation of a coin of Augustus. 1st Century CE. *Himyar: The most famous of whose septs were Zaid Al-Jamhur, Banu Quda'a and Sakasik. *Kahlan: The most famous of whose septs were Hamdan, Azd, Anmar, ·π¨ayy (today their descendants are known as Shammar), Midhhij, Kindah, Lakhm, Judham Kahlan septs emigrated from Yemen to dwell in the different parts of the Arabian Peninsula prior to the Great Flood (Sail Al-‚ÄòArim of Ma‚Äôrib Dam), due to the failure of trade under the Roman pressure and domain on both sea and land trade routes following Roman occupation of Egypt and Syria. Naturally enough, the competition between Kahlan and ·∏§imyar led to the evacuation of the first and the settlement of the second in Yemen. The emigrating septs of Kahlan can be divided into four groups: *Azd: Who, under the leadership of ‚ÄòImrƒÅn bin ‚ÄòAmr MuzaiqbƒÅ‚Äô, wandered in Yemen, sent pioneers and finally headed northwards. Details of their emigration can be summed up as follows: **Tha‚Äòlabah bin ‚ÄòAmr left his tribe Al-Azd for ·∏§ijƒÅz and dwelt between Tha‚Äòlabiyah and Dhƒ´ QƒÅr. When he gained strength, he headed for Madƒ´nah where he stayed. Of his seed are Aws and Khazraj, sons of Haritha bin Tha‚Äòlabah. **Haritha bin ‚ÄòAmr, known as KhuzƒÅ‚Äòah, wandered with his people in Hijaz until they came to Mar Az- Zahran. They conquered the ·∏§aram, and settled in Makkah after having driven away its people, the tribe of Jurhum. **‚ÄòImrƒÅn bin ‚ÄòAmr and his folks went to ‚ÄòOman where they established the tribe of Azd whose children inhabited Tihama and were known as Azd-of-Shanu‚Äôa. **Jafna bin ‚ÄòAmr and his family, headed for Syria where he settled and initiated the kingdom of Ghassan who was so named after a spring of water, in ·∏§ijƒÅz, where they stopped on their way to Syria. *Lakhm and Judham: Of whom was Nasr bin Rabi‚Äòa, father of Manadhira, Kings of Heerah. *Ban≈´ ·π¨ayy: Who also emigrated northwards to settle by the so- called Aja and Salma Mountains which were consequently named as Tai‚Äô Mountains. The tribe later became the tribe of Shammar. *Kindah: Who dwelt in Bahrain but were expelled to Hadramout and Najd where they instituted a powerful government but not for long, for the whole tribe soon faded away. Another tribe of Himyar, known as Ban≈´ Qu·∏ëƒÅ'ah, also left Yemen and dwelt in SamƒÅwah on the borders of Iraq. However, it is estimated that the majority of the ·∏§imyar Christian royalty migrated into Jordan, Al-Karak, where initially they were known as Ban≈´ ·∏§imyar (Sons of ·∏§imyar). Many later on moved to central Jordan to settle in Madaba under the family name of Al-Hamarneh (pop 12,000, est. 2010)  Language  It is a matter of debate whether the ·π¢ayhadic Himyarite language was spoken in the south-western Arabian peninsula until the 10th century.Pro: C.

From 1912 until 1931, with the opening of Maple Leaf Gardens, it was the premier site of ice hockey in Toronto, being home to teams from the National Hockey Association (NHA), the National Hockey League (NHL), the Ontario Hockey Association (OHA) and the International Hockey League (IHL). It was the first home of the Toronto Maple Leafs, who played at the arena under various names for their first 13¬Ω seasons. The Arena Gardens was the third rink in Canada to feature a mechanically frozen or 'artificial' ice surface (Shea's Amphitheatre opened in 1909 and Patrick Arena opened in 1911), and for eleven years was the only such facility in eastern Canada. In 1923, it was the site of the first radio broadcast of an ice hockey game, the first radio broadcast of an NHL game, and the first broadcast of an ice hockey game by long-time broadcaster Foster Hewitt. The Arena was also used for musical concerts, gatherings and other sporting events, including professional boxing, cycling, wrestling and tennis. In 1962, it was converted to a curling club and roller skating rink known as The Terrace. The building was demolished in 1989 and the Cathedral Square residential complex and Arena Gardens municipal park now occupy the site. It was located on Mutual Street, just south of Dundas Street East and two blocks east of Church Street in downtown Toronto. History It was constructed for a reported cost of and opened in 1912. It was built on the site of the Mutual Street Rink, used primarily for curling and ice skating between Dundas Street East and Shuter Street. At the time, it was billed as the largest indoor arena in Canada and held about 7,500 for hockey. The rink was owned by the Toronto Arena Company, organized September 19, 1911, with Sir Henry Pellatt as president, Lol Solman as managing director, and directors Aemilius Jarvis, Joseph Kilgour, T.W. Horn, R.A. Smith, and Col. Carlson. There were two other directors from Montreal. W. J. Bellingham was the initial manager. The Arena opened with a performance by Nathan Franko's Orchestra on October 7, 1912, supporting a recital by Alice Neville, soprano of the Metropolitan Opera, tenor Orville Harold and a company of opera singers from the Boston Opera Company organized by Neville. It was the first of a series called the Toronto Music Festival. Entrances to the various blue and red seating sections were indicated by corresponding blue and red lights on the outside of the building. It was followed the next day by a recital by Johanna Gadski with Franko's orchestra. The festival continued all week, concluding on October 12 with a variety show headlined by Canadian theatre and film actress Marie Dressler. Americans Yvonne de Tr√©ville, Charlotte Maconda and Rosa Olitzka sang arias from several operas while Dressler performed a comedic reading of the poem \\"The Glove\\" by Edward Bulwer- Lytton, singing \\"burlesque opera solos\\" to the accompaniment of Nathan Franko's Orchestra. Arena Gardens was initially home to two new teams in the National Hockey Association (NHA): the Toronto Hockey Club and the Tecumseh Hockey Club. Delays in construction meant that the teams could not play in the 1911‚Äì12 season, as was originally scheduled. The of piping for the artificial ice was installed improperly and had to be reinstalled in December 1912. The first professional ice hockey game in the building was on December 21, 1912, an exhibition between the Montreal Canadiens and Montreal Wanderers. Sprague Cleghorn was suspended for four weeks and fined $65 by the NHA for assaulting the Canadiens' Newsy Lalonde in the game. The first official game was on December 25, 1912, a game between the Canadiens and the Torontos. Upon the suspension of the NHA in 1917, the professional franchise of the new National Hockey League (NHL) for Toronto was operated by the Toronto Arena itself. The franchise was operated by the Arena for two years before being sold to become the Toronto St. Patricks. The St. Pats became the Toronto Maple Leafs in 1927 and played at Arena Gardens until the completion of Maple Leaf Gardens in 1931. Until 1923, the Arena was the only facility east of Manitoba with artificial ice-making capability. With this in mind, the St. Pats often let other teams use the Arena as a neutral site during the early and late months of the season, when it was usually too warm for proper ice. The year 1922 saw the first professional wrestling bout at the Arena, between former world champion Stanislaus Zbyszko and Canadian champion George Walker. Professional wrestling would continue at the Arena until 1938. Promoter Ivan Mickailof began promoting weekly shows in 1929. Some of the names that Mickailof presented at the Arena included Strangler Lewis and Toots Mondt, as well as reigning world champions Gus Sonnenberg, Ed Don George, Henri Deglane, Jim Londos, Ali Baba, Vic Christie, Everett Marshall and Billy Weidner, who all defended their titles at the Arena. On February 8, 1923, the first radio broadcast of an ice hockey game was made from the Arena by the Toronto Daily Star's CFCA radio station. Norman Albert did the play-by-play of the third period of a game between North Toronto and Midland, won by North Toronto 16‚Äì4. Later that season, Foster Hewitt made his first radio broadcasts from the Arena, also on CFCA. A game on February 14, 1923, featured the Toronto St. Pats and the Ottawa Senators, and is the first NHL game to be broadcast on radio. The Stanley Cup Final was played at Arena Gardens four times: 1914, 1918, 1920 and 1922. Arena Gardens also hosted the Memorial Cup finals nine times from 1919 to 1931. The Gardens also hosted the Allan Cup final series. A 1931 game between the Montreal Canadiens and the Maple Leafs was filmed by the National Film Board of Canada. 1913 Liberal Party Reception for Wilfrid Laurier at Arena Gardens Photograph of United Church inaugural service The building was also used for mass assemblies. An assembly was held for Sir Wilfrid Laurier in 1913 by the Liberal Party of Canada. On June 10, 1925, this building was used as the venue for the inaugural service of the United Church of Canada, which united four existing denominations: the Presbyterians, the Methodist Church of Canada, the Congregational Union of Canada, and the Association of Local Union Churches. On December 3, 1933, 7,000 persons attended a memorial service for Sir Arthur Currie, commander of the Canadian Corps in World War I. On October 9, 1936, it was the site of a mass assembly by the Communist Party of Canada. After the Maple Leafs left in 1931, the building no longer was a venue for professional ice hockey but remained open as a venue for sports and entertainment. Some of the other sports included bicycle racing, professional boxing and tennis. By 1934, revenues did not keep up with interest on bonds on the property, property taxes and the expenses of operating the arena. The bondholders made it known that the building was for sale. By 1937, with $200,000 of bonds in default, and the Arena in default of 1933 and 1934 taxes of nearly $16,000, and a similar amount estimated for 1936 and 1937, the Arena was listed for sale by the City of Toronto. In 1938, the Arena was leased to Edward \\"Ted\\" Dickson who turned it into a recreation facility offering ice skating in winter and roller skating in summer. The name was changed that year to the Mutual Street Arena. The Glenn Miller big band played at the Arena in January 1942, Miller's only appearance in Toronto. Frank Sinatra made his first appearance in Toronto here in 1949. Roller hockey was introduced to the Arena in the late 1940s. Hank Williams Sr played a concert at the Arena in 1952. The city's first boat show was held in 1954. The Melody Fair theatre-in-the-round operated at the Arena in 1954. Dickson bought the building in 1945 and it remained in the family for the next 43 years. The arena was renovated for $3 million in 1962, adding 18 curling sheets, year- round roller skating, a parking garage and a new facade. The Arena was renamed \\"The Terrace\\", a name it kept until it was sold in 1988. It closed its doors on April 30, 1989, and was demolished a few months later. The site was converted into a residential development with some of the site reserved for a city park. The Terrace name was retained for one of the residential buildings. In May 2011, the name of the city park on the site was changed from Cathedral Square Park to Arena Gardens.

Research has shown that double depression tends to be more severe than either MDD or PDD alone and that individuals with double depression experience relapse more often than those with either MDD or PDD alone. However, there is some research that indicates few differences exist between double depression, MDD, and PDD; as a result, those researchers conclude that double depression is not a distinct disorder. The literature that details the pharmaceutical treatment of double depression is sparse. Although there are studies that demonstrate that certain medications, such as selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), are effective methods of treatment, those studies lack placebo controls; therefore, the studies' conclusions are questionable. Research has found that, as is the case with other depressive disorders, pharmaceutical and therapeutic treatments combined are more effective than the use of either form of treatment alone. Individuals with double depression tend to experience more functional impairment than those with either MDD or PDD alone. As a result, researchers emphasize the need for unique treatments for double depression to be developed and implemented. Presentation Individuals with double depression meet the DSM-5 classification criteria for both MDD and PDD. Goldney and Fisher (2004) determined that, in a sample of 3,010 individuals from southern portions of Australia calculated a prevalence rate of double depression of 2.2%. Jonas et al. (2003) reported a prevalence rate of double depression in the United States of 3.4%‚Äîbased upon an assessment of 7,667 Americans. The prevalence rate of double depression can be compared to rates of PDD at 6.2%, major depressive episode (MDE) at 8.6%, and major depressive episode with severity (MDE-s) at 7.7%. Keller and Shapiro (1982) found that 26% of patients within a sample of 101 met the criteria for both MDD and PDD; however, the aforementioned sample is much smaller‚Äîand much more inclined to inaccuracies‚Äîthan the samples (3,010 and 7,667) described above. Thus, double depression is less common than other forms of depression, but it is still a form of depression that warrants medical attention in the form of behavioral therapies; pharmaceutical treatments; or, both (Miller, Norman, and Keitner, 1999). The characteristics of those with double depression tend to be more severe in nature than those associated with those who have either MDD or PDD. Levitt, Joffe, and MacDonald (1991) found that those with double depression experience fluctuations in mood at an earlier point in life, a more substantial number of depressive episodes, as well as co-morbid disorders of anxieties more often than their MDD-alone counterparts. Goldney and Fisher (2004) reported that individuals with double depression seek medical attention more often than those with either MDD or PDD alone. Leader and Klein (1996) found that individuals with double depression experience a more substantial level of social impairment, which includes factors such as leisure pursuits and relationship characteristics, than those with either MDD or PDD. Dixon and Thyer (1998) concluded that individuals with double depression experiences recoveries on a more frequent basis than their counterparts who have MDD alone (88% to 69%); however, individuals with double depression experience the most substantial rates of relapse of all of those who suffer from chronic depression. In addition, remission from MDD tends to happen faster than remission from PDD (Dixon & Thyer, 1998). Miller, Norman, and Dow (1986) reported that individuals with double depression endure a more severe path of illness, but experience few differences with respect to social impairment compared to their MDD-alone counterparts. In addition, McCullough et al. (2000) found that, with the exception that patients with double depression tended to experience of more severe illness, few differences were apparent. Therefore, the conclusions drawn in previous research that are associated with the nature of the clinical presentation of double depression are mixed. Multiple scientists emphasize the need for additional research to determine adequate treatments for those with double depression, as depression is a disease that places a considerable burden upon communities and societies; furthermore, those researchers predict depression will be, in an economic sense, the second-most burdensome disease on societies come 2020. Treatment Research on pharmaceutical treatment of double depression in particular is sparse. Certain medications, such as fluoxetine, were found in numerous studies to be effective at reducing symptom severity; however, these studies involved open-label trials, double-blind randomized trials that lack placebo conditions, and small sample sizes. Thus, placebo-controlled trials are needed in order to determine adequate and unique treatments for double depression. In addition, the considerable burden depression places upon communities and societies (Goldney & Fisher, 2004) emphasizes the need for additional research into the treatment of chronic depression. Hellerstein et al. (1994) theorized that antidepressant medications could be used to ameliorate both MDD and PDD; a pharmaceutical trial found that fluoxetine facilitated remission in 57.1% of patients after five months of treatment. In addition, Miller, Norman, and Keitner (1999) conducted an intervention in which one cohort received pharmaceutical treatment while another cohort received both pharmaceutical and therapeutic treatment. Their results indicated that those who received the combined intervention were more functional‚Äîin a social sense‚Äîas well as relieved of their depression than those who received the pharmaceutical intervention alone (Miller, Norman, & Keitner, 1999). However, the researchers found that the effect disappeared at both the 6 and 12-month follow-up assessments. Vasile et al. (2012) conducted a pharmaceutical trial with 16 patients with double depression (who had comorbid alcohol dependence) who were treated and monitored for six months. Results showed that three antidepressants‚Äîvenlafaxine, duloxetine, and milnacipran‚Äîwere associated with substantial improvement; venlafaxine was the most effective of the three antidepressants. Koran, Aboujaoude, and Gamel (2007) conducted a pharmaceutical trial with 24 adults who received duloxetine over the course of a 12-week period. Results showed that duloxetine was successful in the treatment of both PDD as well as double depression. However, the researchers' trial was an open-label trial; as a result, the researchers called for a double-blind and placebo-controlled trial to be conducted in order to further validate the benefits the medication seems to provide. In addition, Waslick et al. (1999) used duloxetine to treat 19 children and adolescents with either PDD or double depression; after eight weeks of pharmaceutical treatment, 11 of the patients failed to meet the classification criteria for one of the two disorders, which led to the conclusion that duloxetine was a medication that appeared to provide relief from PDD and double depression in children and adolescents. However, the aforementioned trial (in addition to Koran et al.'s (2007) trial) was an open-label trial, which the authors noted as a limitation. Hirschfield et al. (1998) conducted a 12-week randomized controlled trial (RCT) that involved the administration of sertraline or imipramine, after which 324 of 623 patients either qualified for remission or experienced a substantive improvement in clinical presentation. In a double-blind, fixed-dose trial that involved the use of either the monoamine oxidase inhibitor (MAOI) moclobemide or the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) fluoxetine, Duarte, Mikkelsen, and DeliniStula (1996) were able to facilitate a minimum of a 50% score reduction on the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HDRS). 71% of cases that involved moclobemide‚Äîversus 38% of cases that involved fluoxetine‚Äîwere determined to achieve the aforementioned desired outcome. As a result, the researchers concluded that both antidepressants were similar in their abilities to treat double depression in an effective fashion. However, the lack of a placebo control undermines the extent to which the results can be applied. Marin, Kocsis, Frances, and Parides (1994) conducted an eight-week open trial that entailed the administration of desipramine to 42 individuals with double depression and 33 individuals with PDD. The researchers found that 70% of the PDD patients experienced a substantial improvement in clinical presentation; the proportion associated with the double depression-cohort was said to be similar. However, the lack of blindness as well as a placebo control notes a considerable limitation of the aforementioned research. Goldney and Bain (2006) found that those who have double depression receive some form of treatment on a more substantial basis than their MDD-alone and PDD-alone counterparts. To elaborate, the authors measured that, in Australia, 41.4% of those evaluated with double depression received treatment three or more times over the course of the previous month, whereas 34.5% of those with MDD alone; 23.2% of those with PDD alone; and 10.3% of those who were not depressed received treatment three or more times over the course of the previous month (Goldney & Bain, 2006). In addition, the researchers concluded that those with double depression acquire a more substantial number of treatment visits per month (a mean of 4.3) when compared to their MDD-alone counterparts (a mean of 3.0); their PDD-alone counterparts (a mean of 2.6); and their non-depressed counterparts (a mean of 1.5). Prognosis Although double depression is less prevalent than either MDD or PDD, it is still a form of depression that warrants medical attention in the form of behavioral therapies; pharmaceutical treatments; or, both. Miller, Norman, and Keitner (1999) found that the use of both behavioral and pharmaceutical treatments was more effective on a short- term basis in the reduction of depression than the use of pharmaceutical treatments alone. Klein, Shankman, and Rose (2008) determined that poor maternal-child relationship, histories of sexual abuse, co-morbid disorders of anxieties, and lower educational attainment predicted an increased HAM-D score after a decade; the researchers also determined that those same factors predicted, after a decade, increased functional impairment. In addition, the results showed that the life course of depression did not differ to a substantial extent between individuals with MDD-alone and double depression. Hirschfield et al. (1998) conducted a 12-week RCT that involved the administration of sertraline or imipramine, in which the most notable predictors of treatment response were educational attainment and relationship status; in addition, the authors noted the apparent influence of intrinsic personal traits. However, Hirschfield et al. noted the limitation of a lack of a placebo control. Klein, Taylor, Harding, and Dickstein (1988) reported that, via their assessment of clinical, familial, and socio-environmental characteristics of those with chronic depression, at a six-month follow-up, individuals with double depression experienced decreased rates of remission, increased manifestations of clinical depressive phenomena, increased functional impairment, and increased likelihood of the development and onset of a hypomanic episode than their MDD-alone counterparts; as a result, the authors underscore the importance of the creation of a distinct classification of double depression due to its unique episodic path. Controversies Previous research on the clinical presentation of double depression tends to be mixed. Numerous studies indicate that the course of double depression tends to be more severe in nature. In addition, numerous studies demonstrate that individuals with double depression seek medical attention to a more substantial extent than those with either MDD or PDD. However, Miller, Norman, and Dow (1986) determined that individuals with MDD or PDD versus individuals with double depression experienced similar levels of social impairment. In addition, McCullough and colleagues found that there were few additional differences overall between the characteristics of those with double depression versus those with either MDD or PDD. Research on the course of double depression is also mixed. Klein, Taylor, Harding, and Dickstein (1988) found that remission in individuals with double depression is less probable than it is in individuals with either MDD or PDD; the researchers also noted that those with double depression are more prone to the development and onset of a hypomanic episode than those with either MDD or PDD. In addition, Klein, Shankman, and Rose (2008) and Hirschfield et al. (1998) both concluded that educational status predicted treatment outcome. However, Levitt, Joffe, and MacDonald (1991) demonstrated that the courses of the respective depressive disorders did not differ to a substantial extent. While Klein, Shankman, and Rose (2008) advocate for the creation of a distinct classification of double depression in the future edition(s) of the DSM, Levitt and colleagues (as well as McCullough and colleagues) seem to indicate that, due to the numerous similarities as well as limited differences between double depression and either MDD or PDD, the creation of such a classification would be inappropriate and incorrect. Remick, Sadovnick, Lam, Zis, and Yee (1996) determine that the heritable bases of MDD, PDD, and double depression are similar and that, as a result, the three disorders are unable to be differentiated.

The administrative subdivisions of the Faroe Islands are frequently changing. In the 1980s there were more than 50 municipalities. During the last past decades the number has been decreasing steadily, and more municipal-mergers can be expected within the following years. The aim of the ministry of interior is that in 2015 there will be only seven or nine municipalities in the Faroe Islands, more or less following the boundaries of the districts and constituencies. If this happens the Faroe Islands will have left the administrative structure of \\"parish-municipalities\\" which was built up in the first half of the 20th century and entered a structure of \\"regional- municipalities\\". Furthermore, there was a long-running discussion on reducing or even removing the constituencies. In the end, from the 2008 election onwards, the constituencies were abolished. The regions (s√Ωsla) are not administrative parts of the islands like the municipalities (kommuna), the municipalities charge taxes from the citizens who live there.

It is a collection of short stories in different styles; however, at some points they echo each other and have subtle connection points. Most are fictional but some are historical. Background One of the many recurrent motifs in the book is the portrayal of ships. This alludes to Noah's Ark -- the subject of the first chapter -- which plays a dominant role in the Abrahamic religions as an example of God's judgement. The woodworm who narrates the first chapter questions the wisdom of appointing Noah as God's representative. The woodworm is left out of the ark, just like the other \\"impure\\" or \\"insignificant\\" species; but a colony of woodworms enters the ark as stowaways and they survive the Great Deluge. The woodworm becomes one of the many connecting figures, appearing in almost every chapter and implying processes of decay, especially of knowledge and historical understanding. Plot Chapter 1, \\"The Stowaway\\", is an alternative account of the story of Noah's Ark from the point of view of the woodworms, who were not allowed onboard and were stowaways during the journey. Chapter 2, \\"The Visitors\\", describes the hijacking of a cruise liner, similar to the 1985 incident of the Achille Lauro. Chapter 3, \\"The Wars of Religion\\", reports a trial against the woodworms in a church, as they have caused the building to become unstable. Chapter 4, \\"The Survivor\\", is set in a world in which the Chernobyl disaster was \\"the first big accident\\". Journalists report that the world is on the brink of nuclear war. The protagonist escapes by boat to avoid the assumed inevitability of a nuclear holocaust. Whether this occurred or is merely a result of the protagonist's paranoia is left ambiguous. Chapter 5, \\"Shipwreck\\", is an analysis of G√©ricault's painting, The Raft of the Medusa. The first half narrates the historical events of the shipwreck and the survival of the crew members. The second half of the chapter analyses the painting itself. It describes G√©ricault's \\"softening\\" the impact of reality in order to preserve the aestheticism of the work, or to make the story of what happened more palatable. Chapter 6, \\"The Mountain\\", describes the journey of a religious woman to a monastery where she wants to intercede for her dead father. The Raft of the Medusa plays a role in this story as well. Chapter 7, \\"Three Simple Stories\\", portrays a survivor from the RMS Titanic, the Biblical story of Jonah and the whale, and the Jewish refugees on board the MS St. Louis in 1939, who were prevented from landing in the United States and other countries. Chapter 8, \\"Upstream!\\", consists of letters from an actor who travels to a remote jungle for a film project, described as similar to The Mission (1986). His letters grow more philosophical and complicated as he deals with the living situations, the personalities of his costars and the director, and the peculiarities of the indigenous population, coming to a climax when his colleague is drowned in an accident with a raft. The unnumbered half-chapter, \\"Parenthesis\\", is inserted between Chapters 8 and 9. It is different in style from the other chapters, which are short stories; here a narrator addresses his readers and offers a philosophical discussion on love. The narrator is called \\"Julian Barnes\\", but, as he states, the reader cannot be sure that the narrator's opinions are those of the author. A parallel is drawn with El Greco's painting Burial of the Count of Orgaz, in which the artist confronts the viewer. The piece includes a discussion of lines from Philip Larkin's poem \\"An Arundel Tomb\\" (\\"What will survive of us is love\\") and from W. H. Auden's \\"September 1, 1939\\" (\\"We must love one another or die\\"). Chapter 9, \\"Project Ararat\\", tells the story of fictional astronaut Spike Tiggler, based on the astronaut James Irwin. Tiggler launches an expedition to recover what remains of Noah's Ark. There is overlap with Chapter 6, \\"The Mountain.\\" Chapter 10, \\"The Dream\\", portrays New Heaven. Critical reception Reviewing A History of the World in 10¬Ω Chapters for The Guardian, Jonathan Coe found that it, \\"while hardly a ground-breaking piece of experimentalism, succeeds to the extent that it is both intelligent and reasonably accessible. Where it falls down is in denying its reader any real focus of human attention or involvement\\". He added that, \\"To dismiss the book as being too clever (or merely clever, for that matter) would be ungenerous as well as facile. Barnes is clearly serious about his themes, and there's more than a nod towards emotional commitment. One of his central concerns is the nature of history, and naturally enough - as a good, free- thinking, commonsense, late-20th-century liberal - he rejects any theory of history as pattern or continuum: 'It's more like a multi-media collage,' he explains, and this, of course, is the rationale behind the novel's own structural disjointedness\\". Coe judged that the book failed to explore history's relationship with the exercise of power \\"via the interaction of character. And this is where Barnes disappoints: I can't remember reading a novel which showed so little interest in the politics of everyday relationships - or one, at any rate, which isolated them so ruthlessly from the speculative realm of 'ideas'\\". Coe found the \\"Parenthesis, or half- chapter\\" to be \\"both too florid and too cool at the same time\\", but concluded that, overall, \\"Readers of this novel will feel awed, I'm sure, by the range of its concerns, the thoroughness of its research, and the agility with which it covers its ground. But when there are such big themes at stake, the reader can get tired of being teased, however ever waggishly. It's like finally going to bed with the partner of your dreams and then, instead of making love, being given a jolly good tickle\\". Writing in The New York Times, Joyce Carol Oates began by noting, \\"Post-modernist in conception but accessibly straightforward in execution, Julian Barnes's fifth book is neither the novel it is presented as being nor the breezy pop-history of the world its title suggests. Influenced to varying degrees by such 20th-century presences as the inevitable Borges, Calvino and Nabokov, as well as by Roland Barthes and perhaps Michel Tournier among others, A History of the World in 10 1/2 Chapters is most usefully described as a gathering of prose pieces, some fiction, others rather like essays\\". She found his \\"concerns throughout are abstract and philosophical, though his tone is unpretentious [‚Ä¶]. Very like Borges, Julian Barnes has a predilection for tracing leitmotifs through a variety of metamorphoses\\". For Oates, \\"Given the principle of repetition, of permutations and combinations, it is inevitable that some of Mr. Barnes's prose pieces are more successful than others.[‚Ä¶] the second piece, The Visitors, [‚Ä¶] is wholly unbelievable, and the head terrorist speaks a stagey, mock-Hollywood lingo\\". \\"But\\", she wrote, \\"as A History of the World in 10 1/2 Chapters progresses and leitmotifs recur, often in comically ingenious combinations, the book becomes increasingly engaging and entertaining; and [‚Ä¶] the book attains that genial mastery of tone that characterized Flaubert's Parrot.\\" Oates concluded by writing, \\"A History of the World in 10 1/2 Chapters demystifies its subjects and renders them almost ordinary: 'Myth will become reality, however sceptical we might be.' In so doing it deconstructs, perhaps even mocks, its own ambition. If the reader does not come to the book with certain of the expectations of prose fiction - that ideas will be dramatized with such narrative momentum that one forgets they are 'ideas,' and that complete worlds will be evoked by way of prose, not merely discussed - this is a playful, witty and entertaining gathering of conjectures by a man to whom ideas are quite clearly crucial: a quintessential humanist, it would seem, of the pre- post-modernist species\\". For D. J. Taylor, writing in The Spectator, \\"[‚Ä¶] A History of the World in 10 1/2 Chapters is not a novel, according to the staider definitions; it possesses no character who rises above the level of a cipher and no plot worth speaking of. It is sharp, funny and brilliant without suggesting that this sharpness, humour and brilliance is sufficient to carry through its purpose to any satisfactory conclusion. Yet it is a significant novel, if only because it provides an inventory of the hoops through which the contemporary novelist has to jump if he wants to be taken seriously\\". He went on to claim that \\"there exists a whole pack of modern writers who delight in giving the game away, in telling you that they are making it up, in indulging in outrageous manipulations of character and plot. The result is that hardly anyone in these novels ‚Äî brilliant novels, swimming with lively conceits ‚Äî has that most necessary fictional quality, a life of their own\\" and that \\"A History is another of these newfangled romps, a series of neat, artfully stage-managed stories which combine to create a bizarre, off-centre view of world history\\". In the end, he decided, \\"This is an entertaining book, containing any number of sparkling jokes, but to suggest, as one or two people have begun to suggest, that it pushes back some sort of fictional frontier would be a mistake. [‚Ä¶] Like a great deal of theoretical literary criticism ‚Äî to which it bears a strong resemblance ‚Äî A History expends vast ingenuity on proving something that might be regarded as an axiom. Tous les significations sont arbitraires, [\\"all significations are arbitrary\\"] as a French theorist once put it. Well, we knew that\\".

Tarpon operated out of San Diego and Pearl Harbor with Submarine Division 13 (SubDiv 13) for several years and was then assigned to SubDiv 14\\\\. In October 1939, SubDiv 14 was transferred to the Philippines, augmenting the six old S-boats at Manila. All submarines there were then reorganized into Submarine Squadron 5\\\\. In October 1941, SubDivs 15 and 16 were transferred from Pearl Harbor to Manila, increasing the Asiatic Fleet strength to 29 submarines. They were divided into five divisions; Tarpon was assigned to SubDiv 203\\\\.  World War II   1942  Two days after the Japanese attacked Pearl Harbor, 18 submarines departed the Philippines on their first war patrols. Tarpon, under Lt. Comdr. Lewis Wallace, was assigned an area off southeastern Luzon. Since all the ships that she definitely identified as Japanese presented unfavorable firing angles, the submarine ended her patrol on 11 January 1942 at Darwin, Australia, without having fired a torpedo. Tarpon got underway on 25 January for her second patrol which took her to the Moluccas. On the 30th, she sighted a convoy; but, since the enemy ships were well escorted, the submarine abandoned the chase. On 1 February, Tarpon fired a spread of four torpedoes at a freighter. One hit. She then fired two more; both hit. Her victim was apparently sinking when the submarine left the scene of the attack, but postwar analysis of Japanese records did not confirm the kill. On 11 February, while investigating a surface contact. Tarpon was illuminated by the enemy's searchlight. She dived and went deep but was severely jolted by four depth charges that knocked out her bow planes, rudder angle indicator, and port annunciator. On the night of 23 February ‚Äì 24 February, Tarpon ran aground while attempting to navigate Boling Strait, west of Flores Island. Jettisoning ammunition, fresh water, fuel, and torpedoes failed to lighten the ship enough to float her off. A native boat then took an officer ashore on the island of Adonara, later returning with the only white man on the island, a Dutch missionary, Pastor H. von Den Rulst. He informed Wallace the next high tide would occur between 16:00 and 18:00. His warning that Japanese planes had been over the island during each of the past four days caused the crew a bit of uneasiness until flood tide. Then, with three engines backing, she slid off the bottom, returning to Fremantle on 5 March. Tarpon began her third patrol on 28 March and ended at Pearl Harbor on 17 May with no contacts except a hospital ship. Her next mission, which took her north of Oahu for defense during the Battle of Midway, lasted only ten days, from 30 May to 9 June; but the submarine contacted no enemy shipping. She was then routed back to San Francisco for an overhaul which was completed on 30 September. On 22 October, Tarpon stood out of Pearl Harbor to begin her fifth war patrol which took her to waters north of Bougainville. She sighted many fishing boats which were not worthy of a torpedo and terminated the patrol at Midway on 10 December 1942.  1943  Tarpon then returned to Pearl Harbor for a refit and began her next patrol from there on 10 January 1943, with Tom Wogan at the helm.Blair, p. 405. Her assigned area was in Japanese home waters, south of Honsh≈´. At 21:30 on 1 February, approximately south of Mikura-jima, the submarine fired four torpedoes at a ship and scored one hit. A follow-up attack with two torpedoes broke the 10,935-ton passenger-cargo ship Fushimi Maru in two. Four days later, Tarpon began patrolling the sea lanes leading to Truk. On 8 February, she made radar contact on a large, unidentified ship. She fired a spread of four torpedoes, and all hit the target. The submarine was forced to go deep by escorts and could not watch the 16,975-ton transport sink. The victim was the Tatsuta Maru, bound for Truk with a load of soldiers. Tarpon made no further contacts before returning to Midway on 25 February, with the highest-scoring patrol of the war so far.Blair, p. 406. Her seventh patrol, conducted from 29 March to 15 May, produced no ship contacts; but Tarpon did bombard the radio station at Taroa with her deck gun until return fire from Japanese batteries ashore prompted her to withdraw from the area. On 30 July, Tarpon again headed for Japanese home waters. On 16 August, she sighted a Japanese task force which reportedly included an aircraft carrier of the Otaka-class (there was, in fact, no such class; intelligence had misidentified), but its high speed prohibited an attack.Blair makes no mention of the sighting at all, and an aircraft carrier contact was sufficiently rare he would. On the 21st, the submarine contacted two large, escorted, cargo ships. She fired a spread of three torpedoes at each and damaged both targets.Not confirmed by JANAC. Blair, p. 932. Seven days later, Tarpon damaged another freighter as it was leaving Mikura-jima. On 4 September, she sank a patrol ship with all hands and then returned to Midway on 8 September. Tarpon conducted her ninth war patrol off the coast of Honsh≈´ from 1 October to 3 November. On the night of 16 October, she was patrolling the approaches to Yokohama when she sighted a ship which she tentatively identified as a large auxiliary. The submarine tracked the target until 01:56 the next morning when she attacked it with four torpedoes which stopped it dead in the water. However, it soon got underway again and headed straight for Tarpon. The submarine submerged, went under the ship, and attacked the target from the other side with three more torpedoes which produced one hit in the stern. The enemy still did not sink, so Tarpon fired again with a torpedo which struck the target in the same place as the first. The vessel exploded and disappeared. Postwar examination of enemy records revealed that the victim was the German raider Michel (Schiff 28) which had been preying on Allied shipping in both the Atlantic and the Pacific. Michel was the only German raider sunk by a United States submarine in the Pacific. Four days later, Tarpon contacted an aircraft carrier and a destroyer. She made a submerged approach and fired four torpedoes at the carrier. However, both ships speeded up and avoided. On the morning of 23 October, the submarine made radar contact on two ships and fired five torpedoes at the larger target. All apparently passed under the freighter. The submarine returned to Pearl Harbor on 3 November. Tarpon's next war patrol, a photo reconnaissance of various atolls in the Marshall Islands group from 4 December 1943 to 12 January 1944, was largely uneventful. She did get an opportunity at an inter-island tanker and fired two torpedoes, but both missed and the vessel escaped.  1944  From 19 June to 8 August, Tarpon performed lifeguard duty in the Truk area, but made no rescues. On 14 July, she fired three torpedoes at what was thought to be an inter-island freighter. All missed, and the ship turned out to be a disguised antisubmarine ship. Tarpon went deep to evade the depth charges and cleared the area. On the 25th, she made radar contact on a small convoy and fired three torpedoes at the largest ship. All missed, and the submarine closed to engage with her deck guns. After the second shot, the gun jammed, and only the machine guns continued firing. Tarpon withdrew to clear the gun and then returned to the attack. She inflicted considerable damage on the enemy ship before she was outgunned and forced to break off the engagement. Tarpon's final war patrol, from 31 August to 14 October, consisted of lifeguard duty in the Truk area. When she returned to Pearl Harbor, she was ordered to the east coast of the United States. The submarine departed Pearl Harbor on Christmas Eve, 1944, and arrived at New London, Connecticut, on 17 January 1945.  Post-war  After operations on the east coast, Tarpon was decommissioned at Boston on 15 November 1945. Early in 1947, the submarine was scheduled for duty as a Naval Reserve training ship. Tarpon left Boston under tow on 28 March and arrived at New Orleans on 9 April and was placed in service there on the 17th. She served as a training submarine in the 8th Naval District until placed out of service and stricken from the Navy list on 5 September 1956. Tarpon foundered in deep water, south of Cape Hatteras, North Carolina, on 26 August 1957, while under tow to the scrap yard. Her wreck is located at . Tarpon received seven battle stars for World War II service.

North Sydney is located 3 kilometres north of the Sydney central business districtGregorys Street Directory, Gregorys Publishing Company, 2007 and is the administrative centre for the local government area of North Sydney Council. History Aborigines on the southern side of Port Jackson (Sydney Harbour) called the north side warung which meant the other side, while those on the northern side used the same name to describe the southern side. The first name used by European settlers was Hunterhill, named after a property owned by Thomas Muir of Huntershill (1765‚Äì1799), a Scottish political reformer. He purchased land in 1794 near the location where the north pylon of the Sydney Harbour Bridge is now located, and built a house which he named after his childhood home. This area north to Gore Hill became known as St Leonards. The township of St Leonards was laid out in 1836 in what is now North Sydney, bounded by what is now Miller, Walker, Lavender and Berry Streets. By 1846 there were 106 houses here and by 1859, the commercial centre had extended from Milsons Point to Miller Street. A bus service operated by Jeremiah Wall ran between Milsons Point and North Sydney Shops, and North Sydney thus developed its own identity. Aerial view of North Sydney during construction of the Sydney Harbour Bridge. The North Sydney municipality was incorporated in 1890 and after naming disputes, North Sydney was settled upon. The post office which opened in 1854 as St Leonards was changed to North Sydney in 1890. The first public school which opened in 1874 as St Leonards was renamed North Sydney in 1910.The Book of Sydney Suburbs, Compiled by Frances Pollon, Angus & Robertson Publishers, 1990, Published in Australia , page 191 North Sydney underwent a dramatic transformation into a commercial hub in 1971‚Äì72. In this period no less than 27 skyscrapers were built.Sydney Architecture Trams The history of the North Sydney tramway system can be divided into three periods ‚Äì the first from the original opening in 1886 to 1909, when the McMahons Point line opened. The second period covers the time until the Wynyard line was opened across the Sydney Harbour Bridge in 1932, and the third until construction of the Cahill Expressway on the eastern side of Sydney Harbour Bridge and the wider closure of the system in 1962.D Keenan: The North Sydney lines of the Sydney tramway system. Transit Press November 1987 The first part of the North Sydney tramway system was a double-track cable tramway which commenced at the original Milsons Point Ferry wharf, located where the north pylon of the Harbour Bridge is now. The line originally extended via Alfred St (now Alfred Street South), Junction St (now Pacific Highway), Blue St and Miller Sts to the engine house and depot in Ridge St. It used cable grip cars called \\"dummies\\" and un-powered trailer cars. A feature of these lines was the underground tram terminus at Wynyard railway station (the only one in Australia), and the tracks over the Sydney Harbour Bridge. Trams ran from Blue St, North Sydney over a now-demolished steel arch bridge over the Harbour Bridge Roadway, then over the eastern side of the harbour bridge (now road lanes), through a tram platform at Milsons Point railway station, before descending underground into platforms 1 and 2 of Wynyard station.

The post dates from at least the 12th century, when the title was Keeper of the Coast, but may be older. The Lord Warden was originally in charge of the Cinque Ports, a group of five (cinque in Norman French) port towns on the southeast coast of England that was formed to collectively supply ships for The Crown in the absence at the time of a formal navy. Today the role is a sinecure and an honorary title, and fourteen towns belong to the Cinque Ports confederation. The title is one of the higher honours bestowed by the Sovereign; it has often been held by members of the Royal Family or prime ministers, especially those who have been influential in defending Britain at times of war. The Lord Warden was solely responsible for the return of all writs to the Crown, along with the collection of taxes and the arrest of criminals. His court was held in St James's church, near Dover Castle, and there he exercised jurisdiction broadly equivalent to that of Chancery. He also had a \\"lieutenant's powers of muster\\", and the Constableship of Dover Castle, later added (1267) to the warden's office, enabled him to keep a garrison and administrative staff, including the clerk and the lieutenant of the castle. The coat of arms of the Cinque Ports first appeared in 1305, second amongst the earliest English known heraldic emblems, predating even the coat of arms of the City of London. The coat of arms of the Cinque Ports displays three ships' hulls and three lions passant guardant conjoined to these hulls, all in gold. These may originally have been Gules three lions passant gardant in pale Or (for England) dimidiating Gules three ships' hulks in pale Or. The coat of arms of the Confederation of the Cinque Ports is set out on a red and blue background and traditionally represents the fourteen \\"corporate\\" members. Creation and appointment of the Lord Warden The creation and appointment of the Lord Warden, once among the most powerful appointments of the realm, by the Sovereign was instituted principally after the portsmen sided with the Earl of Leicester against King Henry III, in the Second Barons' War, and was intended to provide some central authority over the Cinque Ports, which were essentially otherwise independent of the King's sheriffs. It was combined from 1267 with the office of Constable of Dover Castle. However, from 1708 Walmer Castle at Deal was to be preferred as the official residence of the Lord Warden of the Cinque Ports. The Lord Warden also holds the office of Admiral of the Cinque Ports with a maritime jurisdiction extending to the middle of the English Channel, from Redcliffe near Seaford, in Sussex to the shore underneath the Naze Tower, encompassing Brightlingsea in Essex,Cinque Ports Act 1821. c76 (Regnal 1 & 2 Geo IV) Sect. 18 Boundaries & Jurisdiction of Lord Warden of the Cinque Ports the only Cinque Port north of the Thames. In earlier centuries the northern limit was taken as the Shoe Beacon in Essex. The courts of Brodhull and Guestling were established to protect the privileges of the Cinque Ports by the portsmen themselves. From the 15th century these courts had been largely replaced by the Lord Warden's Court at Dover. From the 16th century the principal business of the courts was the installation of the Lord Warden and the court is now only occasionally summoned. The office continued to be a powerful one. In 1550 the Mayor and Jurats of Dover refused to accept a Royal Writ because it was not accompanied by a letter of attendance from the Lord Warden. The member ports' parliamentary representatives were appointed by the Lord Warden at first; this influence continued until the 19th century. At the installation of a new Lord Warden, the Speaker of the Confederation of the Cinque Ports instructs the Lord Warden: \\"to undertake the duties of the Ancient and Honourable Office and to uphold the Franchises, Liberties, Customs and Usages of the port.\\" The office of Speaker has traditionally rotated between the affiliate townships every year dating from at least 1550. Inaugurations are begun on 21 May, and membership is ordained through a longstanding maritime tradition of a principle of the prevailing winds coming from west to east. A unique uniform is specified for the Lord Warden (though the present incumbent wears his naval uniform in preference). The uniform is very similar to a pre-1956-pattern Admiral's uniform (complete with cocked hat) trimmed in red and with Cinque Ports insignia.Dress and Insignia worn at HM Court, Lord Chamberlain's Office, 1937 Sir Robert Menzies's uniform (pictured), which he wore as Lord Warden from 1966 to 1978, is preserved at the National Library of Australia. Barons of the Cinque Ports All freemen of the ports, termed \\"portsmen\\", were deemed in the age of feudalism to be barons, and thus members of the baronage entitled to attend the king's parliament. Termed \\"Barons of the Cinque Ports\\", they reflected an early concept that military service at sea constituted land tenure per baroniam making them quasi feudal barons. The early 14th-century treatise Modus Tenendi Parliamentum stated the Barons of the Cinque Ports to hold a place of precedence below the lay magnates but above the representatives of the shires and boroughs. Writs of summons to Parliament were sent to the warden following which representative barons of the Cinque Ports were selected to attend parliament. Thus the warden's duty in this respect was similar to that of the sheriff who received the writs for distribution to the barons in the shires. The warden and barons often experienced clashes of jurisdiction.Roskell, J.S. History of Parliament, House of Commons 1386-1421, Stroud, 1992, vol.1, p.751, Cinque Ports In the 21st century the title \\"Baron of the Cinque Ports\\" is now reserved for Freemen elected by the Mayor, Jurats, and Common Council of the Ports to attend a Coronation, and is solely honorary in nature. List of Lords Warden of the Cinque Ports The first authoritative list of Cinque Ports Confederation Members was produced in 1293 when Stephen of Pencester was Warden. The Lord Warden of the Cinque Ports is appointed for life, but in the earliest of records this was not the case. The office of Lord Warden of the Cinque Ports has been traced from the year 1226 from the appointment of William de Averanch, although he was not the first incumbent of this office. The longest term of office was that of William Brook, Lord Cobham, who presided at the court for 40 years.

In the naval histories of these countries, the Dutch navy is treated with respect, admiration or envy.

In 1667, it attacked the English fleet in its bases, in 1672‚Äì73 it waged a very successful defensive campaign against the combined fleets of France and England [the two battles of Schooneveld and Texel], and in 1688 it achieved an invasion of England in an excellently administrated surprise mobilisation of a major fleet. In a European perspective, the Dutch navy is a strong candidate for the position as the most successful naval organisation of the seventeenth century.\\"Chua, Amy: Day of Empire: How Hyperpowers Rise to Global Dominance ‚Äì and Why They Fall. (New York: Anchor Books, 2009) The oldest extant version of the legend has been dated to the late 18th century. According to the legend, if hailed by another ship, the crew of the Flying Dutchman was said to try to send messages to land, or to people long dead. Purported sightings in the 19th and 20th centuries claimed that the ship glowed with a ghostly light. In ocean lore, the sight of this phantom ship is a portent of doom. Origins View of Table Bay (overlooked by Kaapstad, Dutch Cape Colony) with ships of the Dutch East India Company, c. 1683. In the 17th century, the size of the Dutch merchant fleet probably exceeded the combined fleets of England, France, Spain, Portugal, and Germany.Wallerstein, Immanuel (2011). The Modern World-System II: Mercantilism and the Consolidation of the European World-Economy, 1600‚Äì1750. (New York: Academic Press, 1980), p. 43‚Äì44. As Immanuel Wallerstein (1980) remarked, the Dutch shipbuilding industry was \\"of modern dimensions, inclining strongly toward standardised, repetitive methods. It was highly mechanized and used many labor-saving devices ‚Äì wind-powered sawmills, powered feeders for saw, block and tackles, great cranes to move heavy timbers ‚Äì all of which increased productivity.\\"Lunsford, Virginia W.: Piracy and Privateering in the Golden Age Netherlands. (New York: Palgrave Macmillan, 2005), p. 69. \\"By seventeenth century standards,\\" as Richard Unger affirms, Dutch shipbuilding \\"was a massive industry and larger than any shipbuilding industry which had preceded it.\\"Moore, Jason W.

The legend of the Flying Dutchman is likely to have originated from the 17th- century golden age of the VOC. The first print reference to the ship appears in Travels in various part of Europe, Asia and Africa during a series of thirty years and upward (1790) by John MacDonald: The next literary reference appears in Chapter VI of A Voyage to Botany Bay (1795) (also known as A Voyage to New South Wales), attributed to George Barrington (1755‚Äì1804): The next literary reference introduces the motif of punishment for a crime, in Scenes of Infancy (Edinburgh, 1803) by John Leyden (1775‚Äì1811): Thomas Moore (1779‚Äì1852) places the vessel in the north Atlantic in his poem Written on passing Dead-man's Island in the Gulf of St. Lawrence, Late in the evening, September, 1804:Published in Epistles, Odes, and other poems (London, 1806) \\"Fast gliding along, a gloomy bark / Her sails are full, though the wind is still, / And there blows not a breath her sails to fill.\\" A footnote adds: \\"The above lines were suggested by a superstition very common among sailors, who call this ghost-ship, I think, 'the flying Dutch-man'.\\" Sir Walter Scott (1771‚Äì1832), a friend of John Leyden's, was the first to refer to the vessel as a pirate ship, writing in the notes to Rokeby; a poem (first published December 1812) that the ship was \\"originally a vessel loaded with great wealth, on board of which some horrid act of murder and piracy had been committed\\" and that the apparition of the ship \\"is considered by the mariners as the worst of all possible omens\\". According to some sources, 17th-century Dutch captain Bernard Fokke is the model for the captain of the ghost ship.Eyers, Jonathan (2011). Don't Shoot the Albatross!: Nautical Myths and Superstitions. A&C; Black, London, UK. . Fokke was renowned for the speed of his trips from the Netherlands to Java and was suspected of being in league with the Devil. The first version of the legend as a story was printed in Blackwood's Edinburgh Magazine for May 1821,The author has been identified as John Howison (fl. 1821‚Äì1859) of the East India Company. See Alan Lang Strout, A Bibliography of Articles in Blackwood's Magazine 1817‚Äì1825 (1959, p. 78). which puts the scene as the Cape of Good Hope. This story introduces the name Captain Hendrick Van der Decken for the captain and the motifs (elaborated by later writers) of letters addressed to people long dead being offered to other ships for delivery, but if accepted will bring misfortune; and the captain having sworn to round the Cape of Good Hope though it should take until the day of judgment. Reported sightings There have been many reported or alleged sightings in the 19th and 20th centuries. A well-known sighting was by Prince George of Wales, the future King George V. He was on a three-year voyage during his late adolescence in 1880 with his elder brother Prince Albert Victor of Wales and their tutor John Neill Dalton. They temporarily shipped into after the damaged rudder was repaired in their original ship, the 4,000-tonne corvette Bacchante. The princes' log (indeterminate as to which prince, due to later editing before publication) records the following for the pre-dawn hours of 11 July 1881, off the coast of Australia in the Bass Strait between Melbourne and Sydney: Nicholas Monsarrat, the novelist who wrote The Cruel Sea, described the phenomenon in the Pacific Ocean in his unfinished final book \\"Master Mariner\\", which was partly inspired by this tale (he lived and worked in South Africa after the war) and the story of the Wandering Jew. Explanations as an optical illusion Probably the most credible explanation is a superior mirage or Fata Morgana seen at sea. Book illustration showing superior mirages of two boats > The news soon spread through the vessel that a phantom-ship with a ghostly > crew was sailing in the air over a phantom-ocean, and that it was a bad > omen, and meant that not one of them should ever see land again. The captain > was told the wonderful tale, and coming on deck, he explained to the sailors > that this strange appearance was caused by the reflection of some ship that > was sailing on the water below this image, but at such a distance they could > not see it. There were certain conditions of the atmosphere, he said, when > the sun's rays could form a perfect picture in the air of objects on the > earth, like the images one sees in glass or water, but they were not > generally upright, as in the case of this ship, but reversed‚Äîturned bottom > upwards. This appearance in the air is called a mirage. He told a sailor to > go up to the foretop and look beyond the phantom-ship. The man obeyed, and > reported that he could see on the water, below the ship in the air, one > precisely like it. Just then another ship was seen in the air, only this one > was a steamship, and was bottom-upwards, as the captain had said these > mirages generally appeared.

Stockton Another optical effect known as looming occurs when rays of light are bent across different refractive indices. This could make a ship just off the horizon appear hoisted in the air. Adaptations There is a 20-foot one- design high-performance two-person monohull racing dinghy named the Flying Dutchman (FD). It made its Olympic debut at the 1960 Summer Games competitions in the Gulf of Naples and is still one of the fastest racing dinghies in the world.Portsmouth tables In artworks and design The Flying Dutchman has been captured in paintings by Albert Ryder, now in the Smithsonian American Art Museum, Washington, D.C., and by Howard Pyle, whose painting of the Flying Dutchman is on exhibit at the Delaware Art Museum. In television series and comics * Scooby-Doo featured a Flying Dutchman ghost modeled after the illustrator Howard Pyle's 1900 depiction of the character * \\"The Flying Dutchman\\" is both the name of a pirate ghost (a flying Dutchman) and his haunted pirate ship (The Flying Dutchman) in the Nickelodeon animated comedy series SpongeBob SquarePants. The former is voiced by Brian Doyle-Murray, and the latter is based on Queen Anne's Revenge. * Carl Barks wrote and drew a 1959 comic book story where Uncle Scrooge, Donald Duck and Huey, Dewey, and Louie meet the Flying Dutchman.

It also gets a mention in the closing narration of the episode \\"Death Ship\\". * In 2001, Andromeda aired a first-season episode \\"The Mathematics of Tears\\", in which the Flying Dutchman figured explicitly in the plot. * In an episode of Supernatural a ghost ship heralds the death of the victims of a first mate's ghost. The ship is compared to the Flying Dutchman by Sam Winchester. In film The story was dramatised in the 1951 film Pandora and the Flying Dutchman, starring James Mason (who plays the Dutch Captain Hendrick Van der Decken) and Ava Gardner (who plays Pandora). In this version, the Flying Dutchman is a man, not a ship. The two-hour long film, scripted by its director Albert Lewin, sets the main action on the Mediterranean coast of Spain during the summer of 1930. Centuries earlier the Dutchman had killed his wife, wrongly believing her to be unfaithful. At his trial he is unrepentant and curses God. Providence condemned him to roam the seas until he found the true meaning of love. In the only plot device taken from earlier versions of the story, once every seven years the Dutchman is allowed ashore for six months to search for a woman who will love him enough to die for him, releasing him from his curse, and he finds her in Pandora. Disney's Flying Dutchman prop used in Pirates of the Caribbean moored at Castaway Cay cruise ship terminal In the Pirates of the Caribbean films, the ship made its first appearance in Dead Man's Chest (2006) under the command of the fictional captain, Davy Jones. The story and attributes of the ship were inspired by the actual Flying Dutchman of nautical lore. In literature The 1797‚Äì98 poem by Samuel Taylor Coleridge, The Rime of the Ancient Mariner, contains a similar account of a ghost ship, which may have been influenced by the tale of the Flying Dutchman. Excerpt available at Google Books. One of the first Flying Dutchman short stories was titled \\"Vanderdecken's Message Home; or, the Tenacity of Natural Affection\\" and was published in Blackwood's during 1821. Excerpt available at Google Books. Dutch poet J. Slauerhoff published a number of related poems, particularly in his 1928 volume Eldorado. This story was adapted in the English melodrama The Flying Dutchman; or the Phantom Ship: a Nautical Drama, in three acts (1826) by Edward Fitzball (1792‚Äì1873), music by George Rodwell, and the novel The Phantom Ship (1839) by Frederick Marryat. This in turn was later adapted as Het Vliegend Schip (The Flying Ship) by the Dutch clergyman, A. H. C. R√∂mer. In Marryat's version, Terneuzen, in the Netherlands, is described as the home of the captain, who is called \\"Van der Decken\\" (\\"of the decks\\"). Another adaptation was The Flying Dutchman on Tappan Sea by Washington Irving (1855), in which the captain is named Ramhout van Dam. Irving had already used the story (based on Moore's poem) in his Bracebridge Hall (1822). Hedvig Ekdal describes visions of the Flying Dutchman from the books she reads in the attic in Henrik Ibsen's The Wild Duck (1884). John Boyle O'Reilly's The Flying Dutchman was first published in The Wild Goose, a handwritten newspaper produced by Fenian convicts being transported to Western Australia in 1867. The Death Ship, by W. Clark Russell, was published in 1888. It is narrated by Geoffrey Fenton, descendant of Edward Fenton, second mate of the English ship Saracen on a voyage to the East Indies in 1796. Fenton's ship encounters the Flying Dutchman, and an accident leaves him stranded aboard the cursed ship with her ghostly crew. The captain, Cornelius Vanderdecken, tells Fenton that his ship, the Braave, sailed from Batavia in 1653. British author Brian Jacques wrote a trilogy of fantasy/young adult novels concerning two reluctant members of the Dutchmans crew, a young boy and his dog, who were swept off the ship by a wave on the night the ship was cursed; however, the same angel who pronounced the curse on the ship and crew appeared to them and blessed them, charging them to help those in need . The first novel was titled Castaways of the Flying Dutchman and was first published by Puffin Books in 2001. The second was titled The Angel's Command and was released by Puffin in 2003. The third and final book of the trilogy (due to Jacques' death in 2011) was titled Voyage of Slaves and was released by Puffin in 2006. In the novel The Flying Dutchman (2013) by the Russian novelist Anatoly Kudryavitsky, the ghost ship rebuilds itself from an old barge abandoned on the bank of a big Russian river, and offers itself as a refuge to a persecuted musicologist. The comic fantasy Flying Dutch by Tom Holt is a version of the Flying Dutchman story. In this version, the Dutchman is not a ghost ship but crewed by immortals who can only visit land once every seven years when the unbearable smell that is a side-effect of the elixir of life wears off. The Roger Zelazny short story \\"And Only I Am Escaped to Tell Thee\\" tells of a sailor who escapes from the Flying Dutchman and is rescued by sailors who welcome him to the Mary Celeste. Ward Moore in his 1951 story \\"Flying Dutchman\\" used the myth as a metaphor for an automated bomber plane which continues to fly over an Earth where humanity long since totally destroyed itself and all life in a nuclear war. In Craig Alanson's novel series Expeditionary Force, the Flying Dutchman is a large alien starship that has been commandeered by the human protagonist Joe Bishop, an ancient AI and a multi-national military and civilian crew - who named the ship. In opera and theatre Depiction of Richard Wagner's Opera Der fliegende Holl√§nder Richard Wagner's opera The Flying Dutchman (1843) is adapted from an episode in Heinrich Heine's satirical novel The Memoirs of Mister von Schnabelewopski (Aus den Memoiren des Herrn von Schnabelewopski) (1833), in which a character attends a theatrical performance of The Flying Dutchman in Amsterdam. Heine had first briefly used the legend in his Reisebilder: Die Nordsee (Pictures of Travel: the North Sea) (1826), which simply repeats from Blackwood's Magazine the features of the vessel being seen in a storm and sending letters addressed to persons long since dead. In his 1833 elaboration, it was once thought that it may have been based on Fitzball's play, which was playing at the Adelphi Theatre in London, but the run had ended on 7 April 1827 and Heine did not arrive in London until the 14th. Heine was the first author to introduce the chance of salvation through a woman's devotion and the opportunity to set foot on land every seven years to seek a faithful wife. This imaginary play, unlike Fitzball's play, which has the Cape of Good Hope location, in Heine's account is transferred to the North Sea off Scotland. Wagner's opera was similarly planned to take place off the coast of Scotland, although during the final rehearsals he transferred the action to another part of the North Sea, off Norway. Pierre-Louis Dietsch composed an opera Le vaisseau fant√¥me, ou Le maudit des mers (\\"The Phantom Ship, or The Accursed of the Sea\\"), which was first performed on 9 November 1842 at the Paris Opera. The libretto by Paul Foucher and H. R√©voil was based on Walter Scott's The Pirate as well as Captain Marryat's The Phantom Ship and other sources, although Wagner thought it was based on the scenario of his own opera, which he had just sold to the Opera. The similarity of Dietsch's opera to Wagner's is slight, although Wagner's assertion is often repeated. Berlioz thought Le vaisseau fant√¥me too solemn, but other reviewers were more favourable.Cooper & Millington 1992.Cooper & Millington 2001.

Course The shore of Middle Harbour is nearly everywhere rugged, barren and forested and for this reason Middle Harbour was almost entirely neglected during the first two centuries of European settlement in Sydney. There are only a few small patches of flat land on its shores. There are many small creeks draining the surrounding hills, but no significant rivers flow into Middle Harbour. Within Middle Harbour are, from upstream to downstream, Shell Cove, Pearl Bay, Long Bay, Sugarloaf Bay, Bantry Bay, Fisher Bay, Sandy Bay, Sailors Bay, Powder Hulk Bay, Willoughby Bay and Quakers Hat Bay. Middle Harbour is a significant physical barrier between Sydney's North Shore and the suburbs known as the Northern Beaches area which lie north and east of Middle Harbour. There are only two bridges - the Spit Bridge and the Roseville Bridge - and because of this obstacle, historically the main transport between Manly and Sydney was by ferry.

Berry died at Crows Nest House on 30 November 1873.The Book of Sydney Suburbs, Compiled by Frances Pollen, Angus & Robertson Publishers, 1990, Published in Australia  Heritage listings  Crows Nest has a number of heritage-listed sites, including: * 23 Albany Street: Electricity Power House St Thomas Rest Park St Thomas Rest Park, located in West Street, was originally the cemetery of St Thomas's Church. It was the first burial ground established on Sydney's north shore. The land for the cemetery was donated to the Anglican Parish of St Leonards in 1845 by the prominent landowner and merchant, Alexander Berry. Notable people buried there include Alexander Berry and George Barney. Alexander Berry was buried there with his wife, in 1873, when he died at the age of 92. They are interred in an unusual, pyramid-shaped tomb with his wife's brother, Edward Wollstonecraft, former owner of Crows Nest Farm, after which the area is named. George Barney (lieutenant colonel) was born in London in 1792, and arrived in Sydney in 1835. He held a number of posts, including Commander of the Royal Engineers, and he designed Victoria Barracks. He was responsible for the completion of Fort Denison, Circular Quay, Cockatoo Dock and Darlinghurst Gaol. The park includes the original Sexton's Cottage, which is now used as a museum of local history, and is heritage-listed.State Heritage Register Population At the 2016 census, there were 4,798 residents in Crows Nest. 54.2% of residents were born in Australia.

The photographs served as a basis for future \\"muckraking\\" journalism by exposing the slums to New York City's upper and middle classes. They inspired many reforms of working-class housing, both immediately after publication as well as making a lasting impact in today's society.  Background   19th century, New York City  In the 1880s many people in upper- and middle-class society were unaware of the dangerous conditions in the slums among poor immigrants. After the Civil War, the country transformed into an industrial superpower and became largely urban.Riis, 2011. p.9 Also, a wave of unskilled southern European, eastern European, Asian, and Jewish immigrants came to settle in the \\"promised land\\" of the United States. This migration was vastly different from the previous booms due to the influx of non-western European and non-Protestant individuals, therefore making the split between the \\"new\\" and \\"old\\" immigrants much larger.Riis, 2011. p.15 In the 1880s, over 5.2 million immigrants came to the United States, with many of these people staying in New York City. This increased New York City's population 25%, therefore making the tenement problem much more extreme.Riis, 2011. p.17 A map of the area Jacob Riis surveyed while collecting material for How the Other Half Lives. In the years after the Civil War, many of the former residents of the most notorious slums were wealthy enough to move out of these conditions, or had died in the war.Anbinder, p.343 Also, the elevated railway in the Bowery in 1889 transformed this evolving neighborhood back into the squalid, seedy neighborhood it was before the war, and even made it worse.Anbinder, p.346 The slums were viewed as a problem by people before the publication of How the Other Half Lives. Some political reformers believed that a wider distribution of wealth would fix the problem, while the Socialists believed that public ownership and a redistribution of wealth would fix the problem.Riis, 2010. p.358 National organizations such as the American Red Cross, The National Conference of Charities and Corrections, and the Women's Christian Temperance Union were involved in different aspects of the slum problem, but these efforts were local in scope instead of national.Riis, 2010. p.359  Tenements  Lodgers in a Bayard Street Tenement By 1865, a total of 15,309 tenements existed in New York City, and the city's population was approaching 1,000,000.Plunz, p.11 It was colloquially known to be a housing type for the poor made for maximum densities, within the constraints of a 25-by-100-foot lot.Plunz, p.13 When the Tenement House Act of 1867 was passed, the tenement was defined as: > Any house, building, or portion thereof, which is rented, leased, let or > hired out to be occupied or is occupied, as the home or residence of more > than three families living independently of one another and doing their own > cooking upon the premises, or by more than two families upon a floor, so > living and cooking and having a common right in the halls, stairways, yards, > water-closets, or privies, or some of them.Plunz, p.22 It was with the publication of this act that the basic \\"dumbbell\\" layout of the tenement was first used. This tenement style was supposed to allow more natural light and air ventilation into these living quarters, as well as adding more water closets and allowing for the fire safety regulations explained in the Tenement House Act of 1867.Plunz, pp.22, 24 On top of this, many of the landlords of these tenements did little to improve their conditions. When asked about the enforcement of the new statutes, the Superintendent of Buildings said that he was satisfied with hard wood in these tenements because it \\"burned slowly.\\"Sante, p.31  Jacob Riis  Jacob Riis, author of How the Other Half Lives Jacob Riis emigrated from Denmark in 1870 to New York City, eager to prove himself. Finding it difficult to find work, he found a home in the slums of New York's Lower East Side.Riis, 2011. pp.10-11 He went back to Denmark for a short period of time, returning to New York to become a police reporter. During this time, Riis became a devout Christian and devoted himself to \\"the service of God and his fellows.\\"Riis, 2010. p.332 Riis turned to photography as a sort of \\"pastime\\" and found it a useful tool when writing his police reports. Once he began using magnesium flash powder, he was able to capture the dark and dingy conditions of the tenements.Riis, 2010. pp.172-173 How the Other Half Lives was only one book in Riis' bibliography of highlighting the conditions in the slums of New York. Some of his other works that highlighted more in depth views into slum life were The Children of the Poor, Children of the Tenements, The Battle with the Slums, and Out of Mulberry Street.Riis, 2010. p.335 Summary  Prayer Time in the Nursery; Five Points House of Industry, 1888 In January 1888, Riis bought a detective camera and went on an expedition to gather images of what life was like in the slums of New York City.Riis, 2011. p.3Riis, 2018 [1892]. pp.ix, 59, 64, 87, 208, 269-271 This both included Riis taking his own photos as well as him using the images of other photographers. Finally, on January 28, 1888, Riis presented \\"The Other Half: How It Lives and Dies in New York\\" using his images on a projection screen and taking the viewer on a journey by describing the images. Throughout 1888, Riis continued his lectures in local New York City churches, which were reviewed in several newspapers including New York Sun, Brooklyn Times, New York Evening Post, and Harper's.Riis, 2011. p.4 In February 1889, Riis wrote a magazine article based on his lectures in Scribner magazine, which was a resounding success. The book version of Riis' work was published in January 1890 as How the Other Half Lives: Studies among the Tenements of New York.Riis, 2011. p.5 The title of the book is a reference to a sentence by French writer Fran√ßois Rabelais, who wrote in Pantagruel: \\"one half of the world does not know how the other half lives\\" (\\"la moiti√© du monde ne sait comment l'autre vit\\").Speake, p.325 How the Other Half Lives: Studies among the Tenements of New York explained the living conditions in New York slums as well as the sweatshops in some tenements, which paid workers only a few cents per day. The book explains the plight of working children; they would work in factories and at other jobs. Some children became garment workers and newsies (newsboys). Riis describes the system of tenement housing that had failed, as he claims, because of greed and neglect from wealthier people. He claims a correlation between the high crime rate, drunkenness, and reckless behaviour of the poor and their lack of a proper home.Riis, 2004. pp.3-5 Chapter by chapter he uses his words and photographs to expose the conditions inhabited by the poor in a manner that \\"spoke directly to people's hearts\\".Pascal, pp.84-87 While Riis treats many of the ethnic groups he encounters with slurs and numerous stereotypes, he still keeps his general hypothesis that the reason for the poverty in these communities is caused by the conditions surrounding them.Riis, 2011. p.32 Riis often does have an \\"ethnic hierarchy,\\" often its most extreme towards the Chinese.Riis, 2011. pp.18-19 Riis ends How the Other Half Lives with a plan of how to fix the problem. He asserts that the plan is achievable and that the upper classes will not only profit financially from such ventures, but have a moral obligation to tend to them as well.Riis, 2004. pp.152-153 How the Other Half Lives follows a general outline for the charity writings of the nineteenth century: a section on crime, the Protestant virtues and vices (intemperance, idleness, disorder, uncleanliness), miserable conditions of living, disease, the loss of modesty (especially women), the dissolution of the family, the institutions that would help in their uplift, as well as future sources of reform.Gandal, p.29 The difference was the introduction of photography to prove the squalid conditions and to increase sympathy for the individuals living in these slums. Riis finally convinced the average reader of newspapers that the poor were not so by choice; that the dangerous and unhygienic conditions in which they lived were imposed by society, rather than the result of loose moral standards; that the slums were something that needed to be fixed rather than gaped at or shunned.Sante, pp.34‚Äì35 Critical reception  After publication  Illustration of Riis' photograph of rear tenements The article proved to be popular, and Riis spent the better part of a year expanding it into the book published by Scribner's Books in 1890. It offered more illustrations and halftones than the magazine articles could offer.Riis, 2011. p.6 The book was successful. Soon after its publication, The New York Times lauded its content, calling it a \\"powerful book\\".\\"Matters We Ought to Know: How the Other Half Lives\\", The New York Times, 4 January 1891. The praise for How the Other Half Lives continued in many other newspapers all across the country. Many of these enthusiastic reviews were seen in Christian newsletters, which enjoyed Riis' view on the moral issues of poverty. The Christian Intelligencer reviewed the first edition saying \\"Books like this that lift the curtains and expose to public gaze the great evils of the system will hasten the day of reform.\\" Many of these Christian reviewers found Riis' work to be applicable to their own cities, and called for similar reforms that Riis outlines in How the Other Half Lives.Riis, 2010. pp.324‚Äì327 One of the most famous people who liked Riis' work was Theodore Roosevelt. Roosevelt became close to Riis during his two years as the President of the Police Board.Riis, 2010. p.337 Roosevelt and Riis worked together to abolish police lodging houses, as well as the reenactment of the Civil Service Law, the Tenement House Commission, laws that increased the amount of factory inspectors, making the eight-hour and prevailing rate of wages law effective, regulation of the working hours of women and children, as well as multiple other labor reforms.Riis, 2010. pp.342, 344  Lasting impact  Because of this awakening caused by Riis' efforts, many reforms were quickly compiled to improve conditions for the working poor. In 1894, the Tenement House Committee was established.Plunz, p.38 In 1895, they published the New York Tenement House Act, which outlawed rear tenements and also was the first official document to supplement a written description of tenement housing with photographs. In addition to this legislature, more reform was brought about by the New York Tenement House Act of 1901, which changed the minimum requirements of tenement housing to include reforms in the amount of light received by living quarters, increased fire safety regulations, more ventilation, restrictions on building height, and increased room space. For these reforms, Riis has almost been given full credit for inspiring these acts, especially the Act of 1901. Because of his poignant descriptions of the degradation of Mulberry Bend, this area was razed and replaced with a city park.Gandal, p.148 How the Other Half Lives also inspired reform on a national scale. The Department of Labor published The Housing of the Working People in 1895, which was the second major tenement study of the decade.Riis, 2011. Jacob Riis was only the first to expose the conditions that the impoverished lived in using photographs. Some other works that detailed life in poverty were the images of the migrants during the Dust Bowl commissioned by the Farm Security Administration by Dorothea Lange; The Other America by Michael Harrington; and The American Way of Poverty: How the Other Half Still Lives by Sasha Abramsky.

The film was directed by Albert Lewin and produced by Albert Lewin and Joe Kaufmann from his own screenplay, based on the legend of the Flying Dutchman. It was filmed mainly on the Costa Brava in Spain. The land record speed scenes were shot at Pendine Sands in Wales. The film starred Ava Gardner and James Mason, featuring Nigel Patrick, Sheila Sim, Harold Warrender, Mario Cabr√© and Marius Goring. The cinematographer was Jack Cardiff. Most of the movie was shot on location in Tossa de Mar, Catalonia, Spain, where a statue of Gardner has been erected on the hill overlooking the town's main beach. MGM delayed its release until Gardner's star-making performance in Show Boat (1951) could be seen. The tactic worked, and this film solidified her status as a rising star. Plot In 1930, fishermen in the small Spanish port of Esperanza make a grim discovery in their nets, the bodies of a man and a woman. The resultant ringing of church bells in the village brings the local police and the resident archaeologist, Geoffrey Fielding (Harold Warrender), to the beach. Fielding returns to his villa, and, breaking the \\"fourth wall\\", retells the story of these two people to the audience. Esperanza's small group of English expatriates revolves around Pandora Reynolds (Ava Gardner), an American nightclub singer and femme fatale. All the men love her (or believe that they do), but Pandora is unable to love anyone. She tests her admirers by demanding they give up something they value, citing Zeno of Elea's quote: \\"the measure of true love is how much poison Marius Goring is willing to drink for it.\\" One of her admirers (Marius Goring) thus commits suicide in front of Pandora and her friends by drinking wine that he has laced with poison, but Pandora apparently shows indifference. Pandora agrees to marry a land-speed record holder, Stephen Cameron (Nigel Patrick), after he sends his racing car tumbling into the sea at her request. That same night, the Dutch captain Hendrick van der Zee (James Mason) arrives in Esperanza. Pandora swims out to his yacht and finds him painting a picture of her posed as her namesake, Pandora, whose actions brought an end to the earthly paradise in Greek mythology. Hendrick appears to fall in love with Pandora, and he moves into the same hotel complex as the other expatriates. Geoffrey and Hendrick become friends, collaborating to seek background information on Geoffrey's local finds. One of these relics is a notebook written in Old Dutch, which confirms Geoffrey's suspicion that Hendrick van der Zee is the Flying Dutchman, a 16th- century ship captain who murdered his wife, believing her to be unfaithful. He blasphemed against God at his murder trial, where he was sentenced to death. The evening before his execution, a mysterious force opened the Dutchman's prison doors and allowed him to escape to his waiting ship, where in a dream it was revealed to him that his wife was innocent and he was doomed to sail the seas for eternity unless he could find a woman who loved him enough to die for him. Every seven years, the Dutchman could go ashore for six months to search for that woman. Despite her impending wedding to Stephen, Pandora declares her love for Hendrick, but he is unwilling to have her die for his sake, and tries to provoke her into hating him. Pandora is also loved by Juan Montalvo (Mario Cabr√©), an arrogant, famous bullfighter, who murders Hendrick out of jealousy. But as soon as Montalvo leaves, Hendrick comes back to life as if nothing had happened. He attends the bullfight the next day, and when Montalvo sees him in the audience, he becomes petrified with fear and is fatally gored by the bull. Before dying, Montalvo tells Pandora about his murder of his romantic rival, leaving her confused. On the eve of her wedding, Pandora asks Geoffrey if he knows anything about Hendrick that will clear up her confusion. Once he sees the Flying Dutchman preparing to sail away, he hands her his translation of the notebook. However, the Dutchman's yacht is becalmed. On learning the truth, Pandora swims out to Hendrick again. He shows her a small portrait of his murdered wife. She and Pandora look exactly alike. Hendrik explains they are man and wife and that through her he has been given the chance to escape his doom, but he rejected it because it would cost her death. Pandora is undaunted, however. That night, there is a fierce storm at sea. The next morning, the bodies of Pandora and the Dutchman are recovered.

The story was originally published in Strand Magazine in 1893, and was collected later in The Memoirs of Sherlock Holmes. Unlike the majority of Holmes stories, the main narrator is not Doctor Watson, but Sherlock Holmes himself. With Watson providing an introduction, the story within a story is a classic example of a frame tale. It is one of the earliest recorded cases investigated by Holmes, and establishes his problem solving skills. \\"The Adventure of the Musgrave Ritual\\" shares elements with two Edgar Allan Poe tales: \\"The Gold Bug\\" and \\"The Cask of Amontillado\\". In 1927, Conan Doyle ranked the story at 11th place on his top 12 Holmes stories list. The story did better in a 1959 chart produced by The Baker Street Journal, ranking 6th out of 10.  Plot  In the story, Holmes recounts to Watson the events arising after a visit from a university acquaintance, Reginald Musgrave. Musgrave visits Holmes after the disappearance of two of his domestic staff, Rachel Howells, a maid, and Richard Brunton, the longtime butler. The pair vanished after Musgrave had dismissed Brunton for secretly reading a family document, the Musgrave Ritual. The Ritual, which dates from the 17th century, is a riddle set in question/response form. It reads: Musgrave caught Brunton in the library at two o'clock one morning. Not only had he unlocked a cabinet and taken out the document in question, but he also had what looked like a chart or map, which he promptly stuffed into a pocket upon seeing his employer watching him. Brunton besought Musgrave not to dishonour him by dismissing him, and asked for a month's time to invent some reason for leaving, making it seem as though he was leaving of his own accord. Musgrave granted him a week. The story later reveals that Brunton wanted the time for something else. A few days later, Brunton disappeared, leaving behind most of his belongings. His bed had not been slept in. No sign could be found of him. The maid, Rachel Howells, who was also Brunton's former lover, had a hysterical fit when asked about Brunton's whereabouts, repeating over and over that he was gone. She was in such a state that another servant was posted to sit up with her at night. Eventually, however, the guarding servant nodded off one night, and the hysterical Rachel Howells escaped through a window. Her footprints led to the edge of the mere, and ended there. Musgrave had the mere dredged, but only a sack containing some rusty, mangled bits of metal, and some coloured stones or glass were found. Rachel Howells was never heard from again. Henry VII of England included in a portrait of Charles I of England by Daniel Mytens prior to its destruction in 1649. Holmes looked upon the case not as three mysteries, but as one. He considered the riddle of the ritual. It was a meaningless, absurd tradition to Musgrave, and apparently to all his ancestors going back more than two centuries, but Holmes - and Brunton, too, Holmes suspected - saw it as something very different. He quickly realized that it was a set of instructions for finding something. Ascertaining the height of the oak, which was still standing, and the position of the elm, which was now gone, Holmes performed a few calculations and paced out the route to whatever awaited him, with Musgrave now eagerly following him. It was quite instructive to Holmes that Brunton had recently asked about the old elm tree's height as well, and that he was apparently quite intelligent. Holmes in the calculated place. The two men found themselves inside a doorway, momentarily disappointed, until they realized that there was the last instruction, \\"and so under\\". There was a cellar under where they were standing, as old as the house. Finding their way into it, they saw that the floor had been cleared to expose a stone slab with an iron ring on it. Holmes thought it wise to bring the police in at this point. He and a burly Sussex policeman managed to lift the slab off the little hole that it was covering, and inside, they found an empty, rotten chest, and Brunton, who had been dead for several days. There were no marks on him. He had likely suffocated. Holmes then put everything together for his rather shocked client. Brunton had deduced the ritual's meaning, at least insofar as it led to something valuable. He had determined the elm tree's height by asking his master, had paced out the instructions ‚Äì and Holmes had later even found a peg hole in the lawn made by Brunton ‚Äì had found the hiding place in the old cellar, but then had found it impossible to lift the stone slab himself. So, he had been forced to draw someone else into his treasure hunt. He had unwisely chosen Rachel Howells, who hated him. The two of them could have lifted the slab up, but they would have needed to support it while Brunton climbed down to fetch the treasure. Based on Rachel's sudden flight and disappearance, Holmes wondered if she had deliberately kicked the supports away and left Brunton to die, or if the slab had fallen back into place by itself and caused her to panic. As to the relics found in the bag retrieved from the mere, Holmes examined them and found that the metal parts were gold and the stones were gems. He believed that it was no less than King Charles I‚Äôs (\\"His who is gone\\") medieval crown of St. Edward, being kept for his eventual successor ‚Äì his son, Charles II (\\"He who will come\\"), who would not be crowned until 11 years after the execution of Charles I. The ritual had been a guide to retrieving this important symbol, and Reginald confirms that one of his ancestors, Sir Ralph Musgrave, was a king's man. Holmes theorized that the original holder of the ritual had died before teaching his son about its significance. It had thus become nothing more than a quaint custom for more than 200 years.  Publication history  The story was originally published in the Strand Magazine in May 1893, with illustrations by Sidney Paget. It was later collected in The Memoirs of Sherlock Holmes. The Strands text of the ritual did not specify the month in which the shadow of the elm should be measured (the shadow would be longer in winter and point in different directions throughout the year), but a couplet was added for the Memoirs identifying the month as the \\"sixth from the first\\". \\"The Adventure of the Musgrave Ritual\\" was also published in the US in Harper's Weekly on 13 May 1893, and in the US edition of The Strand Magazine in June 1893.Smith (2014), p. 86. The story was published with six illustrations by Sidney Paget in the Strand.Cawthorne (2011), p. 82. It was included in The Memoirs of Sherlock Holmes, which was published in December 1893 in the UK and February 1894 in the US.Cawthorne (2011), p. 75.  Adaptations  Film and television The 1912 silent film Le Tr√©sor des Musgraves (intertitles in French) The story was adapted for the 1912 French- British √âclair film series as a silent short film. It was also adapted as a short film as part of the Stoll film series. The film was released in 1922. The 1943 film Sherlock Holmes Faces Death, part of the Basil Rathbone/Nigel Bruce series of films, loosely adapted the story, though the ritual was completely re-written to represent a chess game played on the floor of the Musgrave mansion. Also the treasure is a land grant that was given to the Musgraves by Henry VIII instead of the lost crown of Charles I. The story was adapted for the 1965 BBC series Sherlock Holmes with Peter Cushing. The episode is now lost. The story was adapted for an episode of Sherlock Holmes, the Granada Television series starring Jeremy Brett. The episode deviated from the original by including Watson in the adventure; the story nods to the framing device of the original by having Holmes, not looking forward to the trip, remark that he intends to organise some of his old cases before he met Watson in order to keep himself occupied. In addition, the story features an actual oak tree, which Holmes describes as \\"a patriarch among oaks, one of the most magnificent trees that I have ever seen.\\" In the Granada film version, however, Holmes utilizes a weathervane in the shape of an oak perched on top of the Musgrave mansion to solve the mysterious ritual. At the very end of the teleplay, Rachel's body is shown to have been found after having floated up from the mere. Further, the 12th line of the ritual is adapted to suit the scenery and the 5th and 6th lines are omitted. It was filmed in the 400-year- old Baddesley Clinton Manor House near Birmingham, UK. This house was the Musgrave home in the TV episode. An episode of the animated television series Sherlock Holmes in the 22nd Century was based on the story. The episode, titled \\"The Musgrave Ritual\\", first aired in 1999. Episodes 9 and 10 of the 2013 Russian TV series Sherlock Holmes are based on the story, although the storyline is quite different including some action scenes and Brunton being in fact a revenging member of a family of Musgraves' rivals. The Musgrave Ritual is adapted as part of the storyline of the final episode of the fourth season of Sherlock, \\"The Final Problem\\"; as children, the Holmes family lived in an old house called Musgrave, but after Sherlock and Mycroft's sister Eurus was involved in the disappearance of Sherlock's dog/best friend (Sherlock had for years believed it was a dog as he buried the memory due to the scale of the mental trauma), all Eurus would provide as a clue was a strange song. Years later, with John Watson's life at stake as he is trapped in the same location where Eurus left her first victim, Sherlock deduces that the song relates to the unusual dates on various fake gravestones around the house, the resulting 'code' leading him to Eurus' old room to make an emotional appeal to his sister to spare John. Radio Edith Meiser adapted the story as an episode of the American radio series The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes which aired on 5 January 1931, with Richard Gordon as Sherlock Holmes and Leigh Lovell as Dr. Watson.Dickerson (2019), p. 26. The story was adapted for the American radio series The New Adventures of Sherlock Holmes with Basil Rathbone as Holmes and Nigel Bruce as Watson. The episode aired on 16 July 1943.Dickerson (2019), p. 130. A 1962 BBC Light Programme radio adaptation aired as part of the 1952‚Äì1969 radio series starring Carleton Hobbs as Holmes and Norman Shelley as Watson. An adaptation aired on BBC radio in June 1978, starring Barry Foster as Holmes and David Buck as Watson. It was adapted by Michael Bakewell. \\"The Musgrave Ritual\\" was adapted as a 1981 episode of the series CBS Radio Mystery Theater with Gordon Gould as Sherlock Holmes and Court Benson as Dr. Watson. \\"The Musgrave Ritual\\" was dramatised by Peter Mackie for BBC Radio 4 in 1992 as part of the 1989‚Äì1998 radio series starring Clive Merrison as Holmes and Michael Williams as Watson. It featured Robert Daws as Reginald Musgrave and Michael Kilgarriff as Sergeant Harris. A 2014 episode of The Classic Adventures of Sherlock Holmes, a series on the American radio show Imagination Theatre, was adapted from the story, with John Patrick Lowrie as Holmes and Lawrence Albert as Watson. Stage T. S. Eliot stated that he adapted part of the Ritual in his 1935 verse play Murder in the Cathedral as a deliberate homage.

It is often used to describe a difficulty encountered when people with sharply contrasting viewpoints are attempting (and failing) to discuss a topic. In other words, when one is debating with another, there may be a baffling disconnect despite one's apparent understanding of the argument. Despite the apparently sufficient understanding to formulate counter-arguments, the mind of the debater does not allow him to be swayed by that knowledge. There are many instances on the Internet where antiprocess can be observed, but the prime location to see it is in Usenet discussion groups, where discussions tend to be highly polarized. In such debates, both sides appear to have a highly sophisticated understanding of the other position, yet neither side is swayed. As a result, the debate can continue for years without any progress being made.  Dynamics  Antiprocess occurs because: # The mind is capable of multitasking; # The mind has the innate capability to evaluate and select information at a preconscious level so that we are not overwhelmed with the processing requirements; # It is not feasible to maintain two contradictory beliefs at the same time; # It is not possible for people to be aware of every factor leading up to decisions they make; # People learn argumentatively effective but logically invalid defensive strategies (such as rhetorical fallacies); # People tend to favour strategies of thinking that have served them well in the past; and # The truth is just too unpalatable to the mind to accept. The ramifications of these factors are that people can be engaged in a debate sincerely, yet the appearances suggest that they are not. This can lead to acrimony if neither party is aware of antiprocess and does not adjust his or her debating style accordingly.

Rodrigues () or popularly as Am√°lia, was a Portuguese fadista (fado singer) and actress. Known as the 'Rainha do Fado' (\\"Queen of Fado\\"), Rodrigues was instrumental in popularising fado worldwide and travelled internationally throughout her career. Am√°lia remains the best- selling Portuguese artist in history.Am√°lia RodriguesAm√°lia Rodrigues ‚Äì 14 anos de saudadeFado de Am√°lia Rodrigues continua conquistando f√£s Early years Personal life Even though official documents give her date of birth as 23 July, Am√°lia herself maintained that her birthday was actually 1 July 1920. She was born in Pena, a parish of Lisbon, Portugal. Her maternal family had roots in Souto da Casa, a parish in Fund√£o, Central Portugal, where Rodrigues's grandfather worked as a blacksmith. Her father was Albertino de Jesus Rodrigues, originally from the Castelo Branco district in Portugal, and her mother was Lucinda da Piedade Rebordao, of Fund√£o parish, also in Castelo Branco district. In the Parish Church of Fund√£o is the baptism certificate of Rodrigues, a document also published in the Journal of Fund√£o after the singer's death, following an investigation by Salvado J. Travassos who also discovered her birth certificate. According to the testimony of Jos√© Filipe Duarte Gon√ßalves, her sister, Celeste, was born in Lisbon (in addition to another child who died). Rodrigues grew up in poverty. She grew up doing odd jobs like selling fruit in Lisbon's quays. Singing career Rodrigues started singing around 1935. Her first professional engagement in a fado venue took place in 1939, and she was a guest in stage revues. Around that time she met Frederico Val√©rio, a classically trained composer who recognised Am√°lia's potential and composed numerous melodies especially designed for her- adding orchestral accompaniments. Such as 'Fado do Ci√∫me', 'Ai Mouraria', 'Que Deus Me Perdoe', and 'N√£o Sei Porque Te Foste Embora.' By the early 1940s, Am√°lia had become a famous singer in Portugal. Rodrigues began acting with a debut film in 1946 titled 'Capas Negras' followed by her best known movie, 'Fado' (1947).Gabriela Cruz, \\"The Suspended Voice of Am√°lia Rodrigues\\" In Music in Print and Beyond: Hildegard von Bingen to the Beatles, 180‚Äì199. She gained popularity in Spain and Brazil (where, in 1945, she made her first recordings on Brazilian label Continental) where she spent some time and Paris (1949) where she resided. In 1950, while performing at the Marshall Plan international benefit shows, she introduced the song 'April in Portugal' to international audiences, under its original title \\"Coimbra\\". In the early 1950s, the involvement of Portuguese poet David Mour√£o-Ferreira marked a new phase in her career where leading poets were writing specifically for her. The middle years International career Amalia Rodrigues travelled abroad for the first time in 1943, to perform at the Portuguese ambassador in Madrid Pedro Teot√≥nio Pereira's gala party. She was accompanied by singer J√∫lio Proen√ßa and musicians Armandinho and Santos Moreira. She performed in Brazil in 1945 where she made her first recordings, in Berlin in 1950 and also performed in Mexico and France. She was the first Portuguese artist to appear on American TV on ABC in 1953. She sang at Hollywood's Mocambo club in 1954. Am√°lia Rodrigues performing at the Grand Gala du Disque Populaire in the Netherlands, 1969 Rodrigues appeared in Henri Verneuil's film The Lovers of Lisbon (Les Amants du Tage), in a supporting role. In France she almost as popular as in Portugal, and she performed at the prestigious Parisian Olympia hall. This led to the release of the album Portugal's Great Am√°lia Rodrigues Live at the Olympia Theatre in Paris, in 1957.on Monitor Records (now under Smithsonian Folkways In France during the 1950s‚Äì1960s she performed on television and became a well-known artist. Charles Aznavour wrote a fado in French especially for her 'Aie Mourir Pour Toi' and she created French versions of her own songs (e.g. Coimbra became Avril au Portugal. She performed at Olympia for 10 seasons between 1956 and 1992. She then said she would sing only once in a while. She returned in 1962 concentrating on recording and performing live at a slower pace. Her comeback album, 1962's Am√°lia Rodrigues, was with French composer Alain Oulman (1929‚Äì1990), who was to become her main songwriter and musical producer. He wrote melodies for creating a Fado sub-genre known as 'Busto' (Bust). Rodrigues also began to sing her own poems ('Estranha Forma de Vida') on Am√°lia Rodrigues, as well as poems written by other poets, such as Pedro Homem de Mello and David Mour√£o- Ferreira. This album also established her signature songs like 'Povo Que Lavas no Rio', 'Maria Lisboa' and 'Abandono'. Oulman, a left-wing intellectual, was arrested by Portugal's political police (known as PIDE) in 1966, and forced into exile, but he continued contributing for Am√°lia. She resumed her stage- career singing in Israel, the UK, France, and returning to the US for Promenade Concerts at the Hollywood Bowl, and New York City, accompanied by Andre Kostelanetz, in 1966 and 1968. She also sang in the ex-USSR and Romania. Acting career Am√°lia in Amsterdam, 1964. She continued her acting career, in films like 'Sangue Toureiro' (1958), and 'Fado Corrido' (1964). Rodrigues appeared in Carlos Vilardeb√≥'s 1964 arthouse film The Enchanted Islands based on a short story by Herman Melville. Her 1965 recording of poems by 16th century poet Lu√≠s de Cam√µes generated acres of newspaper polemics. Her 1968 single Vou dar de beber √† dor broke all sales records and her 1970 album Com que voz won a number of international awards. Having been given Portugal's Film Award for Best Actress for 'Fado' in 1947, once again she was awarded as Portugal's Best Film Actress in 1965, in a movie where she didn't sing. In between she performed in other genres: she recorded some of her old songs with an orchestra, recorded an album with jazz saxophonist Don Byas 'Encontro' (1968), and recorded an album of American songs with Norrie Paramor's orchestra, 'Am√°lia On Broadway' which includes a rendition of 'Summertime', 'The Nearness of You'. An important album in the 1960s was 'Com Que Voz', (1969), reprising many of her successes and adding a few more, all poems by Portuguese-speaking poets, and music by Alain Oulman. Rodrigues was at the height of her vocal and performing powers during the 1960s. The later years Am√°lia Rodrigues in 1972 In the 1970s, Rodrigues concentrated on live concert performances. During the post-25 April 1974 period, she was falsely accused of being a covert agent of the PIDE; this unjust charge triggered a severe bout of depression on her part. While Salazar had been Prime Minister, Rodrigues had been a financial supporter of the Portuguese Communist Party. At the same time she had occasionally expressed some admiration for Salazar himself, reportedly writing love letters to Salazar when he was hospitalized in 1968. Despite the government's heavy promotion of Rodrigues as a national symbol of Portugal, in private, Salazar hated Fado and Rodrigues (whom he referred to as \\"that creature\\"), considering its central concept of 'saudade' (nostalgia or a painful yearning for the past) as anti-modern and \\"has a softening influence on the Portuguese character\\", one that \\"sapped all energy from the soul and led to inertia\\". From the 1970s Rodrigues enjoyed particularly marked success in Italy and Japan. She recorded an album of Italian traditional songs, A Una Terra Che Amo (1973), and made versions of her own songs in Italian. She recorded live performances in an album called Am√°lia in Italia (1978). Her return to the recording studio with Portuguese material came in 1977 with Cantigas numa L√≠ngua Antiga. Soon after that release, Rodrigues suffered her first really serious troubles in terms of physical health, which caused her to be away from the stage for a short period again, and forced her to concentrate on performing, especially in Portugal. Those problems were followed by two very personal albums: Gostava de Ser Quem Era (1980) (literally 'I Wish I Were Who I Was') and 'L√°grima' (1983): all these songs used poems that she herself wrote. In between she sang Frederico Valerio's songs again, in an album called Fado (1982). The 1980s and 1990s brought her enthronement as a living legend. Her last all-new studio recording, L√°grima, was released in 1983. It was followed by a series of previously lost or unreleased recordings and two greatest hits collections. Illness Am√°lia's house, in Lisbon, today House-Museum. Rodrigues returned to the Olympia in Paris in 1985 for a series of concerts. From 1985 to 1994, she enjoyed great international success. During these years she held concerts in France, Italy, Japan, the Netherlands, Belgium, Germany, Brazil, Argentina, Israel, and the USA, in addition to Portugal. In 1990 the celebrations of her 50th career anniversary started with a major concert in Lisbon's Coliseu dos Recreios at the age of 69. She was decorated by the President of the Republic on stage. Her voice had changed: it was lower in pitch and had acquired a new intensity. Despite a series of illnesses involving her voice, Rodrigues continued recording as late as 1990. She eventually retreated from public performance, although her career gained in stature with an official biography by historian and journalist V√≠tor Pav√£o dos Santos, and a five-hour TV series documenting her half-century-long career featuring rare archival footage (later distilled into the 90-minute film documentary, The Art of Am√°lia). Its director, Bruno de Almeida, has also produced Am√°lia, Live in New York City, a concert film of her 1990 performance at The Town Hall. Rodrigues launched a final album of originals in 1990, Obsess√£o. In December 1994 she gave her last concert, aged 74, during the Lisbon European Capital of Culture concerts. She underwent a lung operation soon after, in 1995. Television specials, interviews and tributes were held. She released a new album with original recordings from the 1960s and 1970s, Segredo (1997), and a book of her poems, including the ones she had sung: Am√°lia: Versos (1997). In 1998, Rodrigues was paid a national tribute at Lisbon's Universal Exhibition (Expo '98), and in February 1999 was considered one of Portugal's 25 most important personalities of the democratic period. Soon after she recorded what would become her last interview for television. The 'Cin√©matheque de Paris' did her a tribute in April 1999, by showing some of her movies. Death Tomb of Am√°lia Rodrigues with fresh flowers in the National Pantheon, Lisboa On 6 October 1999, Rodrigues died at age 79, in her Lisbon home. The Portuguese government, at the time led by Prime Minister Ant√≥nio Guterres, promptly declared three days of national mourning. Her house, in Rua de S√£o Bento, is now a museum. She is interred at the National Pantheon alongside other Portuguese notables. She was given a state funeral, attended by tens of thousands, and later transferred to the national Pantheon in 2001; the first woman ever to be laid among the greatest Portuguese figures, an exceptional honour awarded by Parliament.

The foundation manages her legacy and assets, except her copyright, willed to two of her nephews. By the time of her death in 1999, Rodrigues had received more than 40 decorations and honors from France (including the L√©gion d'Honneur), Lebanon, Portugal, Spain, Israel and Japan. In 2004, Italian director Francesco Vezzoli released short black-and-white film Am√°lia Tra√Øda. In 2007, she came in 14th in Portugal's election of Os Grandes Portugueses (The Greatest Portuguese). One year later, in 2008, a film about her life Am√°lia was released, with Sandra Barata portraying her. Rodrigues was once considered by Variety as one of the voices of the century. She remains one of the most international of Portuguese artists and singers, and in Portugal, a national icon. She put Fado in the world map as a musical genre, and her works continue to inspire other performers and singers today, many of whom sing her repertoire. Rodrigues remains one of Portugal's most famous artists and singers. She was born into a humble family and became one of Portugal's biggest celebrities, internationally recognised artist and singer. Her career spanned 55 years and she recorded songs in several languages (especially Portuguese, French, English, Spanish and Italian). Versions of her own songs, for instance \\"Coimbra\\" (\\"April in Portugal\\") achieved success in France, Italy, USA, Brazil, Argentina, Spain, Mexico, Romania, Japan and The Netherlands, among other countries. Family Rodrigues' parents had nine children but only two, besides Am√°lia, reached adulthood: Vicente and Filipe, Jos√© and Ant√≥nio (all died as infants), Am√°lia, Celeste, Aninhas (who died at sixteen), Maria da Gl√≥ria (who died shortly after birth), and Odete.

This includes Members of Parliament, Peers, lobbyists, researchers, secretaries, civil servants, lobby correspondents and leader writers for newspapers and is so named because Parliament is located in Westminster, London. Politicians in this bubble often graduate from privately educated schools and climb the political ladder to become Members of parliament, always remaining in the professional bubble of Westminster, creating a certain set of life experiences in which of often argued to be displayed in many of the MPs in London.

The Nith River is approximately 125km in length and empties into the Grand River at the town of Paris. It is named after the River Nith in Scotland. Course The Nith river begins in a woodland northwest of Crosshill and west of Waterloo Regional Road 5 in the township of Wellesley, Region of Waterloo. It heads north into Perth County, then turns sharply southwest and passes through the communities of Fernbank and Millbank in Perth East. It continues south, takes in the right tributary Smith Creek and arrives at the community of Nithburg. The river flows east back into Waterloo Region, takes in the right tributary Silver Creek, and then the left tributary Firella Creek south of the community of Wellesley in the township of Wellesley. The river turns south into the township of Wilmot, takes in the left tributary Bamberg Creek and passes through the communities of Phillipsburg and New Hamburg, Ontario. The Nith continues south, takes in the left tributaries Baden Creek and Hunsburger Creek, enters into Blandford-Blenheim, Oxford County and reaches the community of Plattsville. The river turns east, takes in the right tributary Black Creek, and left tributaries Hiller Creek, Alder Creek and Eden Creek, passes back into Waterloo Region, and reaches the community of Ayr in the township of North Dumfries, where it takes in the left tributary Cedar Creek. It then turns sharply west, flows back into Oxford County, then turns southeast passing through the communities of Wolverton and Canning. The Nith then flows into Brant County, takes in the right tributary Mud Creek and left tributary Charlie Creek, passing Barker's Bush and reaching its mouth at the Grand River in Paris.  Recreation  The Nith River is flat water with a few riffles, but rain and snowmelt can significantly increase the flow rate. In the early spring the maximum flow rate reaches a median value of 30 and mean of 40, but commonly exceeds 200 m3/s, causing major flooding in the flat regions upstream such as in and around New Hamburg. The Nith offers excellent paddling conditions in April, including a set of Class III whitewater rapids as the Nith enters Paris, yet by May, the flow rate drops below 5 m3/s and becomes unsuitable for paddling.

Many moduli spaces are constructed using techniques specific to algebraic stacks, such as Artin's representability theorem, which is used to construct the moduli space of pointed algebraic curves \\\\mathcal{M}_{g,n} and the moduli stack of elliptic curves. Originally, they were introduced by Grothendieck to keep track of automorphisms on moduli spaces, a technique which allows for treating these moduli spaces as if their underlying schemes or algebraic spaces are smooth. But, through many generalizations the notion of algebraic stacks was finally discovered by Michael Artin.  Definition   Motivation  One of the motivating examples of an algebraic stack is to consider a groupoid scheme (R,U,s,t,m) over a fixed scheme S. For example, if R = \\\\mu_n\\\\times_S\\\\mathbb{A}^n_S (where \\\\mu_n is the group scheme of roots of unity), U = \\\\mathbb{A}^n_S, s = \\\\text{pr}_U is the projection map, t is the group action > \\\\zeta_n \\\\cdot (x_1,\\\\ldots, x_n)=(\\\\zeta_n x_1,\\\\ldots,\\\\zeta_n x_n) and m is the multiplication map > m: (\\\\mu_n\\\\times_S \\\\mathbb{A}^n_S)\\\\times_{\\\\mu_n\\\\times_S \\\\mathbb{A}^n_S} > (\\\\mu_n\\\\times_S \\\\mathbb{A}^n_S) \\\\to \\\\mu_n\\\\times_S \\\\mathbb{A}^n_S on \\\\mu_n. Then, given an S-scheme \\\\pi:X\\\\to S, the groupoid scheme (R(X),U(X),s,t,m) forms a groupoid (where R,U are their associated functors). Moreover, this construction is functorial on (\\\\mathrm{Sch}/S) forming a contravariant 2-functor > (R(-),U(-),s,t,m): (\\\\mathrm{Sch}/S)^\\\\mathrm{op} \\\\to \\\\text{Cat} where \\\\text{Cat} is the 2-category of small categories. Another way to view this is as a fibred category [U/R] \\\\to (\\\\mathrm{Sch}/S) through the Grothendieck construction. Getting the correct technical conditions, such as the Grothendieck topology on (\\\\mathrm{Sch}/S), gives the definition of an algebraic stack. For instance, in the associated groupoid of k-points for a field k, over the origin object 0 \\\\in \\\\mathbb{A}^n_S(k) there is the groupoid of automorphisms \\\\mu_n(k). _Note that in order to get an algebraic stack from [U/R], and not just a stack, there are additional technical hypotheses required for [U/R]_.  Algebraic stacks  It turns out using the fppf- topology (faithfully flat and locally of finite presentation) on (\\\\mathrm{Sch}/S), denoted (\\\\mathrm{Sch}/S)_{fppf}, forms the basis for defining algebraic stacks. Then, an algebraic stack is a fibered category > p: \\\\mathcal{X} \\\\to (\\\\mathrm{Sch}/S)_{fppf} such that # \\\\mathcal{X} is a category fibered in groupoids, meaning the overcategory for some \\\\pi:X\\\\to S is a groupoid # The diagonal map \\\\Delta:\\\\mathcal{X} \\\\to \\\\mathcal{X}\\\\times_S\\\\mathcal{X} of fibered categories is representable as algebraic spaces # There exists an fppf scheme U \\\\to S and an associated 1-morphism of fibered categories \\\\mathcal{U} \\\\to \\\\mathcal{X} which is surjective and smooth called an atlas. = Explanation of technical conditions =  Using the fppf topology  First of all, the fppf- topology is used because it behaves well with respect to descent. For example, if there are schemes X,Y \\\\in \\\\operatorname{Ob}(\\\\mathrm{Sch}/S) and X \\\\to Ycan be refined to an fppf-cover of Y, if X is flat, locally finite type, or locally of finite presentation, then Y has this property. this kind of idea can be extended further by considering properties local either on the target or the source of a morphism f:X\\\\to Y. For a cover \\\\\\\\{X_i \\\\to X\\\\\\\\}_{i \\\\in I} we say a property \\\\mathcal{P} is local on the source if > f:X\\\\to Y has \\\\mathcal{P} if and only if each X_i \\\\to Y has \\\\mathcal{P}. There is an analogous notion on the target called local on the target. This means given a cover \\\\\\\\{Y_i \\\\to Y \\\\\\\\}_{i \\\\in I} > f:X\\\\to Y has \\\\mathcal{P} if and only if each X\\\\times_YY_i \\\\to Y has > \\\\mathcal{P}. For the fppf topology, having an immersion is local on the target. In addition to the previous properties local on the source for the fppf topology, f being univerally open is also local on the source. Also, being locally Noetherian and Jacobson are local on the source and target for the fppf topology. This does not hold in the fpqc topology, making it not as \\"nice\\" in terms of technical properties. Even though this is true, using algebraic stacks over the fpqc topology still has its use, such as in chromatic homotopy theory. This is because the Moduli stack of formal group laws \\\\mathcal{M}_{fg} is an fpqc-algebraic stackpg 40.  Representable diagonal  By definition, a 1-morphism f:\\\\mathcal{X} \\\\to \\\\mathcal{Y} of categories fibered in groupoids is representable by algebraic spaces \\\\mathcal{X} is representable as an algebraic space meaning there exists an algebraic space > F:(\\\\mathrm{Sch}/S)^\\\\mathrm{op}_{fppf} \\\\to \\\\operatorname{Sets} such that the associated fibered category \\\\mathcal{S}_F \\\\to (F/S)_{fppf}\\\\operatorname{Sets} \\\\to \\\\operatorname{Cat} is the embedding sending a set S to the category of objects S and only identity morphisms. Then, the Grothendieck construction can be applied to give a category fibered in groupoids is equivalent to (F/U)_{fppf}\\\\times_{\\\\mathcal{Y}} \\\\mathcal{X}. There are a number of equivalent conditions for representability of the diagonal which help give intuition for this technical condition, but one of main motivations is the following: for a scheme U and objects x, y \\\\in \\\\operatorname{Ob}(\\\\mathcal{X}_U) the sheaf \\\\operatorname{Isom}(x,y) is representable as an algebraic space. In particular, the stabilizer group for any point on the stack x : \\\\operatorname{Spec}(k) \\\\to \\\\mathcal{X}_{\\\\operatorname{Spec}(k)} is representable as an algebraic space. Another important equivalence of having a representable diagonal is the technical condition that the intersection of any two algebraic spaces in an algebraic stack is an algebraic space. Reformulated using fiber products > \\\\begin{matrix} Y \\\\times_{\\\\mathcal{X}}Z & \\\\to & Y \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\downarrow & & > \\\\downarrow \\\\\\\\\\\\ Z & \\\\to & \\\\mathcal{X} \\\\end{matrix} the representability of the diagonal is equivalent to Y \\\\to \\\\mathcal{X} being representable for an algebraic space Y. This is because given morphisms Y \\\\to \\\\mathcal{X}, Z \\\\to \\\\mathcal{X} from algebraic spaces, they extend to maps \\\\mathcal{X}\\\\times\\\\mathcal{X} from the diagonal map. There is an analogous statement for algebraic spaces which gives representability of a sheaf on (F/S)_{fppf} as an algebraic space. Note that an analogous condition of representability of the diagonal holds for some formulations of higher stacks where the fiber product is an (n-1)-stack for an n-stack \\\\mathcal{X}. = Surjective and smooth atlas =  2-Yoneda lemma  The existence of an fppf scheme U \\\\to S and a 1-morphism of fibered categories \\\\mathcal{U} \\\\to \\\\mathcal{X} which is surjective and smooth depends on defining a smooth and surjective morphisms of fibered categories. Here \\\\mathcal{U} is the algebraic stack from the representable functor h_U on h_U: (Sch/S)_{fppf}^{op} \\\\to Sets upgraded to a category fibered in groupoids where the categories only have trivial morphisms. This means the set > h_U(T) = \\\\text{Hom}_{(Sch/S)_{fppf}}(T,U) is considered as a category, denoted h_\\\\mathcal{U}(T), with objects in h_U(T) as fppf morphisms > f:T \\\\to U and morphisms are the identity morphism. Hence > h_{\\\\mathcal{U}}:(Sch/S)_{fppf}^{op} \\\\to Groupoids is a 2-functor of groupoids. Showing this 2-functor is a sheaf is the content of the 2-Yoneda lemma. Using the Grothendieck construction, there is an associated category fibered in groupoids denoted \\\\mathcal{U} \\\\to \\\\mathcal{X}.  Representable morphisms of categories fibered in groupoids  To say this morphism \\\\mathcal{U} \\\\to \\\\mathcal{X} is smooth or surjective, we have to introduce representable morphisms. A morphism p:\\\\mathcal{X} \\\\to \\\\mathcal{Y} of categories fibered in groupoids over (Sch/S)_{fppf} is said to be representable if given an object T \\\\to S in (Sch/S)_{fppf} and an object t \\\\in \\\\text{Ob}(\\\\mathcal{Y}_T) the 2-fibered product > (Sch/T)_{fppf}\\\\times_{t,\\\\mathcal{Y}} \\\\mathcal{X}_T is representable by a scheme. Then, we can say the morphism of categories fibered in groupoids p is smooth an surjective if the associated morphism > (Sch/T)_{fppf}\\\\times_{t,\\\\mathcal{Y}} \\\\mathcal{X}_T \\\\to (Sch/T)_{fppf} of schemes is smooth and surjective.  Artin and Deligne-Mumford stacks  There is a subclass of algebraic stacks commonly known as Artin stacks. These are algebraic stacks \\\\mathcal{X} where the smooth surjective atlas \\\\mathcal{U} \\\\to \\\\mathcal{X} comes from a smooth surjective scheme U \\\\to S. Similarly, if the morphism U\\\\to S is Etale and surjective, then the stack \\\\mathcal{X} is said to be a Deligne-Mumford stack. The subclass of Deligne-Mumford stacks are useful because they provide the correct setting for many natural stacks considered, such as the moduli stack of algebraic curves. In addition, they are strict enough that object represented by _points in Deligne-Mumford stacks do not have infinitesimal automorphisms_. This is very important because infinitesimal automorphisms make studying the deformation theory of Artin stacks very difficult. For example, the deformation theory of the Artin stack BGL_n = [*/GL_n], the moduli stack of rank n vector bundles, has infinitesimal automorphisms controlled partially by the Lie algebra \\\\mathfrak{gl}_n. This leads to an infinite sequence of deformations and obstructions in general, which is one of the motivations for studying moduli of stable bundles. Only in the special case of the deformation theory of line bundles [*/GL_1] = [*/\\\\mathbb{G}_m] is the deformation tractable, since the Lie algebra is abelian. Note that many stacks cannot be naturally represented as Deligne- Mumford stacks because it only allows for finite covers, or, algebraic stacks with finite covers. Note that because every Etale cover is flat and locally of finite presentation, algebraic stacks defined with the fppf-topology subsume this theory; but, it is still useful since many stacks found in nature are of this form, such as the moduli of curves \\\\mathcal{M}_g. Also, the differential- geometric analogue of such stacks are called orbifolds. The Etale condition implies the 2-functor > B\\\\mu_n:(\\\\mathrm{Sch}/S)^\\\\text{op} \\\\to \\\\text{Cat} sending a scheme to its groupoid of \\\\mu_n-torsors is representable as a stack over the Etale topology, but the Picard-stack B\\\\mathbb{G}_m of \\\\mathbb{G}_m- torsors (equivalently the category of line bundles) is not representable. Stacks of this form are representable as stacks over the fppf-topology. Another reason for considering the fppf-topology versus the etale topology is over characteristic p the Kummer sequence > 0 \\\\to \\\\mu_p \\\\to \\\\mathbb{G}_m \\\\to \\\\mathbb{G}_m \\\\to 0 is exact only as a sequence of fppf sheaves, but not as a sequence of etale sheaves.  Defining algebraic stacks over other topologies  Using other Grothendieck topologies on (F/S) gives alternative theories of algebraic stacks which are either not general enough, or don't behave well with respect to exchanging properties from the base of a cover to the total space of a cover. It it useful to recall there is the following hierarchy of generalization > \\\\text{fpqc} \\\\supset \\\\text{fppf} \\\\supset \\\\text{smooth} \\\\supset \\\\text{etale} > \\\\supset \\\\text{Zariski} of big topologies on (F/S).  Structure sheaf  The structure sheaf of an algebraic stack is an object pulled back from a universal structure sheaf \\\\mathcal{O} on the site (Sch/S)_{fppf}. This universal structure sheaf is defined as > \\\\mathcal{O}:(Sch/S)_{fppf}^{op} \\\\to Rings, \\\\text{ where } U/X \\\\mapsto > \\\\Gamma(U,\\\\mathcal{O}_U) and the associated structure sheaf on a category fibered in groupoids > p:\\\\mathcal{X} \\\\to (Sch/S)_{fppf} is defined as > \\\\mathcal{O}_\\\\mathcal{X} := p^{-1}\\\\mathcal{O} where p^{-1} comes from the map of Grothendieck topologies. In particular, this means is x \\\\in \\\\text{Ob}(\\\\mathcal{X}) lies over U, so p(x) = U, then \\\\mathcal{O}_\\\\mathcal{X}(x)=\\\\Gamma(U,\\\\mathcal{O}_U). As a sanity check, it's worth comparing this to a category fibered in groupoids coming from an S-scheme X for various topologies. For example, if > (\\\\mathcal{X}_{Zar},\\\\mathcal{O}_\\\\mathcal{X}) = ((Sch/X)_{Zar}, \\\\mathcal{O}_X) is a category fibered in groupoids over (Sch/S)_{fppf}, the structure sheaf for an open subscheme U \\\\to X gives > \\\\mathcal{O}_\\\\mathcal{X}(U) = \\\\mathcal{O}_X(U) = \\\\Gamma(U,\\\\mathcal{O}_X) so this definition recovers the classic structure sheaf on a scheme. Moreover, for a quotient stack \\\\mathcal{X} = [X/G], the structure sheaf this just gives the G-invariant sections > \\\\mathcal{O}_{\\\\mathcal{X}}(U) = \\\\Gamma(U,u^*\\\\mathcal{O}_X)^{G} for u:U\\\\to X in (Sch/S)_{fppf}.  Examples   Classifying stacks  Many classifying stacks for algebraic groups are algebraic stacks. In fact, for an algebraic group space G over a scheme S which is flat of finite presentation, the stack BG is algebraictheorem 6.1.

The town in Western Poland with 11,319 inhabitants (2019) is the capital of Krosno County. It is assigned to the Lubusz Voivodeship (since 1999), previously part of Zielona G√≥ra Voivodeship (1975‚Äì1998). History The town was first mentioned as Crosno in 1005, when Duke Boles≈Çaw I Chrobry of Poland had a fortress built here in the course of his armed conflict with Emperor Henry II and the West Slavic Veleti confederation. Due to its strategic location as a point of passage across the Oder, it played an important role at the western border of the Polish kingdom with the Holy Roman Empire during the 11th to 13th centuries. In 1163 Krosno was part of the Duchy of Silesia ruled by Boles≈Çaw I the Tall of the Silesian Piasts at Wroc≈Çaw. In 1201 it received its town charter by Boles≈Çaw's son Duke Henry I the Bearded. Henry erected a stone castle at Krosno, where he died in 1238 and where his widow, Hedwig of Andechs, took refuge during the 1241 Mongol invasion of Europe. When the Duchy of Wroc≈Çaw was finally divided in 1251, the town became part of the newly created Duchy of G≈Çog√≥w under Konrad I. Crossen a. d. Oder in 1900 The town changed hands several times; once it was given as payment to soldiers of the Ascanian margraves of Brandenburg. When the last Piast duke Henry XI of G≈Çog√≥w died without issue in 1476, his widow Barbara of Brandenburg, daughter of Elector Albert Achilles of Brandenburg, inherited the territory of Crossen. The Brandenburg influence met with fierce opposition by Henry's cousin Duke Jan II the Mad of ≈ªaga≈Ñ, who devastated Krosno but in 1482 had to sign an agreement with Albert Achilles, who was able to retain the Krosno area. As a former part of the Duchy of G≈Çog√≥w it officially remained a lien of the Bohemian kingdom until in 1538 King Ferdinand I of Habsburg, renounced all rights to Crossen in 1538, thereby finalizing the district's belonging to the Neumark region of the Brandenburg margraviate. With Brandenburg, Crossen became part of the Kingdom of Prussia in 1701. In reforms after the Napoleonic Wars, the town became part of the Province of Brandenburg in 1815 and was the seat of Landkreis Crossen as part of Regierungsbezirk Frankfurt . As a result of the Unification of Germany, it became part of the German Empire in 1871. In May 1886 the town was devastated by a whirlwind. In 1945 during World War II, the town was conquered by the Soviet Red Army. After Germany's defeat in the war, the town once again became part of Poland, being east of the Oder‚ÄìNeisse line.

They can appear in any area of the dental arch and can affect any dental organ. The opposite of hyperdontia is hypodontia, where there is a congenital lack of teeth, which is a condition seen more commonly than hyperdontia.Pathology of the Hard Dental Tissues The scientific definition of hyperdontia is \\"any tooth or odontogenic structure that is formed from tooth germ in excess of usual number for any given region of the dental arch.\\"R. S. Omer, R. P. Anthonappa, and N. M. King, \\"Determination of the optimum time for surgical removal of unerupted anterior supernumerary teeth,\\" Pediatric Dentistry, vol. 32, no. 1, pp. 14‚Äì20, 2010. The additional teeth, which may be few or many, can occur on any place in the dental arch. Their arrangement may be symmetrical or non-symmetrical. Signs and symptoms The presence of a supernumerary tooth, particularly when seen in young children, is associated with a disturbance of the maxillary incisor region. This commonly results in the impaction of the incisors during the mixed dentition stage. The study debating this also considered many other factors such as: the patient's age, number, morphology, growth orientation and position of the supernumerary tooth. Alongside this issue, the presence of an extra tooth can impede the eruption of adjacent additional or normal teeth. Therefore, the presence of a supernumerary tooth when found must be approached with the appropriate treatment plan, incorporating the likelihood of incisal crowding. In some individuals, the additional teeth can erupt far from the dental arch, within the maxillary sinus. The extra teeth may also migrate to a different location after development. In some cases, supernumerary teeth can lead to the formation of cysts. Crowding is also frequently seen in people with hyperdontia. Causes There is evidence of hereditary factors along with some evidence of environmental factors leading to this condition. While a single excess tooth is relatively common, multiple hyperdontia is rare in people with no other associated diseases or syndromes. Many supernumerary teeth never erupt, but they may delay eruption of nearby teeth or cause other dental or orthodontic problems. Molar-type extra teeth are the rarest form. Dental X-rays are often used to diagnose hyperdontia. It is suggested that supernumerary teeth develop from a third tooth bud arising from the dental lamina near the regular tooth bud or possibly from splitting the regular tooth bud itself. Supernumerary teeth in deciduous (baby) teeth are less common than in permanent teeth. Related conditions Hyperdontia is seen in a number of disorders, including Gardner's syndrome and cleidocranial dysostosis, where multiple supernumerary teeth are seen that are usually impacted. Other associated conditions are: Cleidocranial dysplasia, Ehlers‚ÄìDanlos syndrome Type III, Ellis‚Äìvan Creveld syndrome, Gardner's syndrome, Goldenhar syndrome, Hallermann‚ÄìStreiff syndrome, Orofaciodigital syndrome type I, Incontinentia pigmenti, Marfan syndrome, Nance‚ÄìHoran syndrome, and Tricho-rhino-phalangeal syndrome Type 1.  Diagnosis  Supernumerary teeth may be detected by taking two different dental X-rays at different angles. Examples of this may be an intra-oral X-ray (one that is taken inside the mouth) and a panoramic radiograph. However, these X-rays are 2D and therefore do not accurately portray the 3D view of the teeth. Types Dental stone model showing mesiodens and accessory tooth behind right central incisor Supernumerary teeth can be classified by shape and by position. The shapes include the following: * Supplemental (where the tooth has a normal shape for the teeth in that series); * Tuberculate (also called barrel shaped); * Conical (also called peg shaped); * Compound odontoma (multiple small tooth-like forms); * Complex odontoma (a disorganized mass of dental tissue)Oxford Handbook of Clinical Dentistry When classified by position, a supernumerary tooth may be referred to as a mesiodens, a paramolar, or a distomolar. Occasionally, these teeth do not erupt into the oral cavity but manifest as a malocclusion.Pediatric Gastrointestinal Disease: Pathophysiology, Diagnosis and Management, Volume 1 The most common supernumerary tooth is a mesiodens, which is a malformed, peg- like tooth that occurs between the maxillary central incisors. Fourth and fifth molars that form behind the third molars are another kind of supernumerary teeth. Treatment Although these teeth are usually asymptomatic and pose no threat to the individual, they are often extracted for aesthetic reasons, to allow the eruption of other teeth, orthodontic reasons and/or suspected pathology. This is done particularly if the mesiodens is positioned in the maxillary central incisor region. The traditional method of removal is done by using bone chisels, although a more advanced technique has been found to be more beneficial, especially if surgery is required. Through the use of piezoelectricity, piezoelectric ultrasonic bone surgery may be more time-consuming than the traditional method but it seems to reduce the post-operative bleeding and associated complications quite significantly. Epidemiology It is evident that hyperdontia is more common in the permanent dentition than in the primary. There is a considerable difference between males and females in the prevalence of these teeth in permanent dentition; hyperdontia is twice as common in males as in females. However, this approximation varies in terms of location, other associating syndromes that may be present, and the ethnicity of the individual. In terms of ethnicity, it can be seen that hyperdontia is in fact less common in Caucasian than in Asian populations. There is evidence to show that an individual is more likely to have hyperdontia if other members of their family also have the condition.

It is one of the two kayak and canoeing disciplines at the Summer Olympics, and is referred to by the International Olympic Committee (IOC) as Canoe/Kayak Slalom. The other Olympic canoeing discipline is canoe sprint. Wildwater canoeing is a non-Olympic paddlesport. History Canoe slalom racing started in Europe and in the 1940s, the International Canoe Federation (ICF) was formed to govern the sport. The first World Championships were held in 1949 in Switzerland. From 1949 to 1999, the championships were held every odd-numbered year and have been held annually in non-Summer Olympic years since 2002. Folding kayaks were used from 1949 to 1963; and in the early 1960s, boats were made of fiberglass and nylon. Boats were heavy, usually over 65 pounds (30 kilos). With the advent of kevlar and carbon fiber being used in the 1970s, the widths of the boats were reduced by the ICF, and the boats were reduced in volume to pass the gates, and boats have become much lighter and faster. From 1949 to 1977, all World Championships were held in Europe. The first World Championship held in North America was held at Jonqui√®re, in Qu√©bec, Canada, in 1979. It has been a regular Olympic sport since 1992. In 2020 during the Tokyo Olympics, C2 men loses its status as an official olympic event and is to be replaced by C1 women.  Rules  Each gate consists of two poles hanging from a wire strung across the river. There are 18-25 numbered gates in a course, of which 6 or 8 must be upstream gates, and they are colored as either green (downstream) or red (upstream), indicating the direction they must be negotiated. Upstream gates are always placed in eddies, where the water is flat or moving slightly upstream; the paddler enters an eddy from the main current and paddles upstream through the gate. Downstream gates may also be placed in eddies, to increase the difficulty, and downstream gates in the current can be offset to alternating sides of the current, requiring rapid turns in fast-moving water. Most slalom courses take 80 to 120 seconds to complete for the fastest paddlers. Depending on the level of competition, difficulty of the course, degree of water turbulence. and ability of the other paddlers, times can go up to 200 seconds. In international competitions (World Cups, World Championships, Olympic Games) each competitor does two runs in the qualification round, called the \\"heats\\"; the time of the faster run gives the qualification result. Depending on the number of participants in the event, 10 to 40 boats make it through to the semi-final; this consists of one run on a different course. The fastest semi-final boats, the number determined by the number of participants, make it through to the final, where they navigate the semi-final course once more. Their ranking within the final group is based on the time of that last run alone. If the competitor's boat, paddle or body touches either pole of the gate, a time penalty of two seconds is added. If the competitor misses a gate completely, deliberately pushes the gate to pass through, goes through the gate in the wrong direction or upside-down, or goes through it in the wrong order, a 50-second penalty is given. Only one penalty can be incurred on each gate, and this will be taken as the highest one. Slalom C1 There are currently four Olympic Medal events: * C1 (canoe single) Men * C1 (canoe single) Women (to be added in 2020) * C2 (canoe double) Men (to be dropped after 2016) * K1 (kayak single) Men * K1 (kayak single) Women In the 1960s and early 1970s, boats were made of heavy fiberglass and nylon. The boats were high volume and weighed over 30 pounds (14 kilos). In the early 1970s Kevlar was used and the boats became lighter as well as the volume of the boats was being reduced almost every year as new designs were made. A minimum boat weight was introduced to equalize competition when super light materials began to affect race results. The ICF also reduced the width of the boats in the early 1970s. The gates were hung about 10 cm above the water. When racers began making lower-volume boats, the gates were raised in response to fears that new boats would be of such low volume as to create a hazard to the paddler. Their low-volume sterns allow the boat to slice through the water in a quick turn, or \\"pivot\\". Typically, new racing boats cost between $1,200 and $2,500 (or $850 onwards for the cheapest constructions in fiberglass). Usually boats are made with carbon fiber, Kevlar and fiberglass cloth, using epoxy or polyester resin to hold the layers together. Foam sandwich construction in between layers of carbon, Kevlar, or Aramid is another technique in use to increase the stiffness of slalom boats. In 2005 the minimum length of these boats was reduced from 4 meters down to 3.5 meters, causing a flurry of new, faster boat designs which are able to navigate courses with more speed and precision. The shorter length also allows for easier navigation and less boat damage in the smaller manmade river beds that are prevalent in current elite competitions. Boat design progression is rather limited year to year. Directly from the 2017 ICF Canoe Slalom Rules: *7.1.1 Measurements **All types of K1 Minimum length 3.50 m minimum width 0.60 m **All types of C1 Minimum length 3.50 m minimum width 0.60 m **All types of C2 Minimum length 4.10 m minimum width 0.75 m *7.1.2 Minimum Weight of Boats **(The minimum weight of the boat is determined when the boat is dry. The weight minimums were raised for 2017.) **All types of K1 . (Previously 8 kg). **All types of C1 . (Previously 8 kg). **All types of C2 . *7.1.3 All boats must have a minimum radius at each end of horizontally and vertically. *7.1.4 Rudders are prohibited on all boats *7.1.5 Boats must be designed to, and remain within, the required dimensions. *7.1.6 Kayaks are decked boats, which must be propelled by double-bladed paddles and inside which the competitors sit. Canoes are decked boats that must be propelled by single-bladed paddles and inside which the competitors kneel. There are rules governing almost every aspect of slalom equipment used in major competition, including sponsor advertisement. Some of these rules vary from country to country; each national canoe and kayak governing body publishes its own variation of the rules.  Courses  Whitewater slalom course Slalom courses are usually on Class II - IV whitewater. Some courses are technical, containing many rocks. Others are on stretches containing fewer rocks and larger waves and holes. Olympics Slalom canoeing made its Olympic debut in 1972 in Augsburg, West Germany, for the Munich Games. It was not seen again until 1992 in La Seu d'Urgell as part of the 1992 Olympics in Barcelona, Spain. Since then, slalom paddling has been a regular Olympic event in the following locations: * 1972: Augsburg, West Germany * 1992: La Seu d'Urgell, Spain * 1996: Ocoee River, United States * 2000: Penrith, Australia * 2004: Athens, Greece * 2008: Shunyi, Beijing, China * 2012: Lee Valley, UK * 2016: Rio de Janeiro, Brazil * 2020: Tokyo, Japan * 2024: Vaires-sur-Marne, Paris, France * 2028: Sepulveda Dam, Los Angeles, United States The 1972 Olympics in Augsburg were held on an artificial whitewater course. The Augsburg Eiskanal set the stage for the future of artificial course creation. With the exception of the altered river bed of the Ocoee River in 1996, every Olympic venue has been a manmade concrete channel. Since the late 1980s, artificial course creation has surged; now most countries that field Olympic slalom teams have more than one artificial course to train on. Artificial river creation has evolved and new courses have fewer issues than some of the initial designs.

This ship of the line was launched at Portsmouth at midday on Saturday, 13 June 1801, after she had spent 13 years on the stocks. She was the first man-of-war launched since the Act of Union 1800 created the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland, and at her head displayed a lion couchant on a scroll bearing the Royal arms as emblazoned on the Standard. Launch The launch was a spectacle; it was reported that at least 10,000 people witnessed Commissioner Sir Charles Saxton break a bottle of wine over her stem, and that after the launch Sir Charles gave a most sumptuous cold collation to the nobility and officers of distinction. After the launch, Dreadnought was brought into dock for coppering, and a great number of people went on board to view her. The following day, due to the exertions of Mr Peake, the builder, and the artificers of the dockyard, she was completely coppered in six hours and on Monday morning she went out of dock for rigging and fitting. Active service Her first commander was Captain James Vashon. After cruising for some time in the Channel he proceeded off C√°diz and Menorca where he continued until the summer of 1802.Phillips. Her first master was Mr. Banks followed by Joseph Foss Dessiou (1769‚Äì1853), who was paid off on 15 July 1802. In 1803, Captain Edward Brace briefly took command as flag captain to William Cornwallis, until he was relieved that same year by Captain John Child Purvis. Purvis served under the orders of Admiral Cornwallis until he was promoted to rear-admiral in April 1804. The next commander until August was Robert Carthew Reynolds. He was superseded that month by George Reynolds, who, in turn, was replaced in December that year by Edward Rotheram, who stayed as flag captain to Admiral Cuthbert Collingwood until just before Trafalgar. The winter gale weather off the French coast badly damaged five of the major warships maintaining the blockade. Dreadnought lost most of her powder when water poured into the magazine. In the spring of 1805, Admiral Cornwallis was replaced by an ailing Lord Gardner who allowed the close blockade to be slackened. On 30 March the French fleet escaped from Toulon and reached C√°diz on 9 April. The French and Spanish squadrons sailed separately from there and joined forces in Martinique on 26 May. On 15 May Collingwood and his squadron of seven ships received orders from the Admiralty to sail for Barbados. Before they could depart; however, Horatio Nelson arrived from the Mediterranean Sea in pursuit of the French, and Dreadnought proceeded to C√°diz for Collingwood to command a close blockade there. Early in October 1805 Captain John Conn assumed command of Dreadnought, after having brought Royal Sovereign out from England for Vice-Admiral Collingwood. Collingwood and Rotheram then moved to the newly recoppered first rate on 10 October 1805, leaving Conn in command of the now sluggish Dreadnought, with her barnacled hull badly in need of careening, but nevertheless with a well exercised ship's company, who for months having been under Collingwood's watchful eye, now contained the most efficient gun crews in the fleet. At the battle of Trafalgar on 21 October 1805, Dreadnought was the eighth ship in the lee division to enter the action. She started firing on San Juan Nepomuceno at two o'clock and fifteen minutes later ran her on board and forced her to surrender after her commander Commodore Cosme Damian de Churruca y Elorza had been killed in action. She then attempted to engage Principe de Asturias but the Spanish ship hauled off. During the battle Dreadnought lost seven killed and 26 wounded. After Trafalgar, Dreadnought continued in the blockade of Cadiz. On 25 November, detained the Ragusan ship Nemesis, which was sailing from Isle de France to Leghorn, Italy, with a cargo of spice, indigo dye, and other goods. Dreadnought shared the prize money with ten other British warships. Dreadnought continued to patrol the Channel and the Baltic for another seven years. In 1807, under Captain William Lechmere, she was part of the Channel Fleet. From 1808 to 1809, she was under Captain G. B. Salt, serving as the flagship of Rear-Admiral Thomas Sotheby, off Ushant. On 9 November Dreadnought, , Christian VII, Milford, Naiad, Unicorn, and the hired armed cutters Nimrod and Adrian were all in sight when the Ballahoo class schooner captured the French brig Modeste. On 7 September 1810 Snapper spotted a ship among the rocks on the west side of Ushant. She notified Dreadnought, which attempted a cutting out expedition. The British succeeded in taking the Spanish merchant brig Maria-Antonia, which had been taken by a French privateer. However, the success was bought at a cost of six dead, 31 wounded and six missing, as well as two ship‚Äôs boats, as a result of an ambush by a large party of French troops with two field guns on a cliff overlooking the anchorage.James (1837), Vol. V, p.236. In spring 1811, Dreadnought, under Captain Samuel Hood Linzee, was in Lisbon. She then was in the Baltic at the end of the year. On 16 December 1811 a fleet of about 150 merchant ships sailed from Wingo, near Gothenburg, under the escort of a number of ships, including Dreadnought. A gale resulted in the loss of St George and Defence but Dreadnought and the other ships arrived safely. Fate Dreadnought at Greenwich 1841 by William Parrott Dreadnought was taken out of commission at Portsmouth in 1812. In 1827, she became a lazaretto (quarantine ship) at Milford on Sea and became the second of the ships used by the Seamen's Hospital Society, between 1831 and 1857, as a hospital ship for ex-members of the Merchant Navy or fishing fleet, and their dependents. Dreadnought was broken up in 1857.Dreadnought at Greenwich 1841, by William Parrott, National Maritime Museum Post-script When the Admiralty had Dreadnought broken up, it transferred the infirmary to the , which was renamed Dreadnought. In 1870 the infirmary transferred onto land as the Seamen's Dreadnought Hospital at the Royal Greenwich Hospital. Since 1986, this has become the 'Dreadnought Unit' at St Thomas's Hospital. In addition, the Seamen's Dreadnought Hospital provided in 1919 the foundation for the UK's dedicated Hospital for Tropical Diseases.

There are also some geometric charges known as subordinaries, which have been given lesser status by some heraldic writers, though most have been in use as long as the traditional ordinaries. Diminutives of ordinaries and some subordinaries are charges of the same shape, though thinner. Most of the ordinaries are theoretically said to occupy one-third of the shield; but this is rarely observed in practice, except when the ordinary is the only charge (as in the coat of arms of Austria). The terms ordinary and subordinary are somewhat controversial, as they have been applied arbitrarily and inconsistently among authors, and the use of these terms has been disparaged by some leading heraldic authorities.See \\"CHAPTER IX: THE SO- CALLED ORDINARIES AND SUB-ORDINARIES\\" in Fox-Davies (1909) A Complete Guide to Heraldry. In his Complete Guide to Heraldry (1909), Arthur Charles Fox-Davies asserted that the terms are likely inventions of heraldic writers and not of heralds,Fox-Davies (1909), pp. 106‚Äì107. arguing the \\"utter absurdity of the necessity for any [such] classification at all,\\" and stating that the ordinaries and sub-ordinaries are, in his mind, \\"no more than first charges.\\"Fox-Davies (1909), p. 107.  Ordinaries  Ordinaries Ordinaries (sometimes called \\"honourable ordinaries\\") resemble partitions of the field, but are formally considered objects on the field. Though there is some debate as to exactly which geometrical charges‚Äîwith straight edges and running from edge to edge of the shield‚Äîconstitute ordinaries, certain ones are agreed on by everyone. Except for the chief they are central to the shield. *Cross: a pale and a fess of equal widths conjoined (though the cross is typically thinner than this would suggest), as in the arms of the City of London. *Pale: a vertical stripe right down the middle of the shield. Typically to the width of the field. ** A variant is the Canadian pale, invented in 1964 for the new Canadian national flag: it takes up half the width of the field. * Fess: a horizontal stripe, as in the coat of arms of Austria. Typically to the height of the field. ** Bar: a narrower fess (said in theory to occupy one-fifth of the field), sometimes reckoned as an ordinary in its own right. It is rarely borne singly. *Bend: an oblique band from the dexter chief (the bearer's upper right, viewer's upper left) to the opposite corner, as in the arms of the former grand duchy of Baden. *Bend sinister: A bend in the opposite direction (sinister chief to dexter base). *Chevron: like the beams of a gable; as in the arms of Trans, Switzerland *Saltire A bend and a bend sinister both of the equal widths conjoined like a St Andrew's cross: diagonal cross √ó as in the Scots national banner (often referred to simply as 'the Saltire'). *Chief: horizontal band right across the top of the shield, as in the arms of the district of Lausanne (Vaud, Switzerland). ** Chief triangular begins in the corners and extends to a point that is one quarter to one third the way down the shield. It is a complex line division variant of a chief. ** Chief enarched is drawn with a concave arch. ** Chief double-arched has two concavities. *Terrace in base (French: champagne, terrace; Italian campagna; German Schildfu√ü) **Mount when represented in green and curved or arched, as a hill. **Mount mounted, or Shapournet shapourned: a Trimount.\\"Mount\\" in: William Berry, Encyclopaedia Heraldica, Or Complete Dictionary of Heraldry (1828). The following are sometimes classed as ordinaries, sometimes as subordinaries (see below): *Bordure: the boundary of the shield; often used for cadency. *Pile: downward pointing triangle, issuing from the top of the shield. *Pall or Pairle: a Y-shape. **A variant is the shakefork: a pall cut short of the margins, with pointed ends. It is frequent in Scotland, owing to its prominence in the armoury of Clan Cunningham.

Very loosely, they are geometric or conventional charges that, unlike ordinaries, do not stretch from edge to edge of the shield. There is no definitive list or definition, but they generally include: Fixed subordinaries Fixed subordinaries are those that have a particular place to go on a shield‚Äîor at least a very limited range of places. a canton‚ÄîGules; on a bend or two cinquefoils azure, on a sinister canton argent a cross crosslet fitchy issuing out of a crescent of the first; a bordure engrailed or for difference‚ÄîCook, Scotland * Quarter: the dexter chief quadrant of the shield ** Canton: smaller than the quarter, formally said to occupy one-ninth of the shield, though sometimes drawn smaller. The canton is often said to be the quarter's diminutive, but perhaps it should be treated as a subordinary in its own right as it fulfils heraldic functions not fulfilled by the quarter, and behaves according to its own special rules‚Äîas for example in the case of the canton on which baronets in the UK may display the badges of their 'rank', which is very rarely shown occupying such a large area as the upper left third of the field, and is usually much less and very often shown not as square but as a rectangle with its longer side vertical. Very occasionally a 'sinister canton' is found, on the shield's other side. * Flaunches, always borne in pairs: a circular arc emerging out of each flank of the shield. * Fret: interlacing bendlet, bendlet sinister and mascle. * Gore: two arcs meeting in the fess point to form a triangular segment. * Gyron: the lower half of a quarter cut diagonally, said to be an old charge but rare although there are modern examples (e. g. de Cluseau) * Orle: A bordure separated from the outside of the shield. Like the bordure the orle takes on the shape of the shield or flag it is on. Although the orle's diminutive is the tressure, there are examples of \\"fillet orles\\" (orles narrower than usual). It is often said that an orle may not have other charges charged on it, but the Scots Public Register. When a number of charges are arranged as if on a bordure, they are said to be in orle or to form an orle of such charges. ** Tressure: a thinner version and hence diminutive of the orle. The most famous tressure is probably the double tressure flory counter flory in the royal coat of arms of Scotland. Tressures with other ornamentation exist, such as with maple leaves, crescents, thistles and roses.

In Scots heraldry the escutcheon en surtout serves several different purposes.

Nowadays cottising is used not just for bends but for practically all the ordinaries (and occasionally collections of charges), and consists in placing the ordinary between two diminutive versions of itself (and occasionally other things). A pale so treated is usually blazoned endorsed and a chevron very occasionally couple closed or between two couple closes. A chief, however, cannot be cottised.Mackinnon of Dunakin (1966), p. 56. The ordinary and its cottices need not have the same tincture or the same line ornamentation. Ordinaries very occasionally get cottised by things shaped quite differently from their diminutives‚Äîlike demi maple leaves. Occasionally a collection of charges aligned as if on an ordinary‚Äîin bend, etc.‚Äîis accompanied by cotticing. Voiding, surmounting with another, and fimbriation Any type of charge, but probably most often the ordinaries and subordinaries, can be \\"voided\\"; without further description, this means that a hole in the shape of the charge reveals the field behind it. Occasionally the hole is of different tincture or shape (which must then be specified), so that the charge appears to be surcharged with a smaller charge. Notes References * Boutell, Charles (1983).

","title":"Ordinary (heraldry)"},{"id":"717439","text":"Countries by crude birth rate (CBR) in 2014 Global fertility rates as of 2020 Sub-replacement fertility is a total fertility rate (TFR) that (if sustained) leads to each new generation being less populous than the older, previous one in a given area. The United Nations Population Division defines sub- replacement fertility as any rate below approximately 2.1 children born per woman of childbearing age, but the threshold can be as high as 3.4 in some developing countries because of higher mortality rates., Introduction and Table 1, p. 580 Taken globally, the total fertility rate at replacement was 2.33 children per woman in 2003. This can be \\"translated\\" as 2 children per woman to replace the parents, plus a \\"third of a child\\" to make up for the higher probability of boys born and mortality prior to the end of a person's fertile life. In 2020, the average global fertility rate is around 2.4 children born per woman. Replacement-level fertility in terms of the net reproduction rate (NRR) is exactly one, because the NRR takes both mortality rates and sex ratios at birth into account. As of 2010, about 48% (3.3 billion people) of the world population lives in nations with sub-replacement fertility.\\"Figure 8: Population by Total Fertility (millions)\\" in World Population Prospects, the 2010 Revision. United Nations, Department of Economic and Social Affairs, Population Division (2011) Nonetheless most of these countries still have growing populations due to immigration, population momentum and increase of the life expectancy. This includes most nations of Europe, Canada, Australia, Brazil, Russia, Iran, Tunisia, China, the United States and many others. In 2016, all European Union countries had a sub- replacement fertility rate, ranging from a low of 1.3 in Portugal, Poland, Greece, Spain and Cyprus to a high of 2.0 in France. The countries or areas that have the lowest fertility are in developed parts of East and Southeast Asia: Singapore, Hong Kong and South Korea. Only a few countries have had, for the time being, sufficiently sustained sub-replacement fertility (sometimes combined with other population factors like higher emigration than immigration) to have population decline, such as Japan, Germany, Lithuania, and Ukraine. As of 2019, the total fertility rate varied from 0.92 in South Korea to 7.03 in Niger. Causes There have been a number of explanations for the general decline in fertility rates in much of the world, and the true explanation is almost certainly a combination of different factors. Higher education Woman and her husband, both medical students, and their triplets in East Germany (GDR) in 1984. Some countries have had state policies to encourage births among educated women. The fact that more people are going to colleges and universities, and are working to obtain more post-graduate degrees there, along with the soaring costs of education, have contributed greatly to postponing marriage in many cases, and bearing children at all, or fewer numbers of children. And the fact that the number of women getting higher education has increased has contributed to fewer of them getting married younger, if at all. In the US, for example, females make up more than half of all college students, which is a reversal from a few decades back. The relationship between higher education and childbearing varies by country: for example, in Switzerland by age 40, childlessness among women who had completed tertiary education is 40%, while in France it is only 15%.http://www.oecd.org/els/family/SF_2_5_Childlessness_June2014.pdf In some countries, childlessness has a longer tradition, and was common even before educational levels increased, but in others, such as Southern European ones, it is a recent phenomenon; for instance in Spain the childlessness rate for women aged 40‚Äì44 in 2011 was 21.60%,https://www.oecd.org/els/family/SF_2-5-Childlessness.pdf but historically throughout the 20th century it was around 10%. Not all countries show a relationship between low fertility and education: in Czech Republic, of women born in 1961-1965, low educated women were more likely to be childless than high educated women.http://demografia.hu/hu/letoltes/publikaciok/EPCposter2016.pdf Economic fluctuation The growth of wealth and human development are related to sub-replacement fertility, although a sudden drop in living conditions, such as the great depression, can also lower fertility.http://www.prb.org/publications/datasheets/2012/world-population- data-sheet/fact-sheet-us-population.aspx In Eastern European countries, the fall of communism was followed by an economic collapse in many of these countries in the 1990s. Some countries, such as those that experienced violent conflicts in the 1990s, were badly affected. Large numbers of people lost their jobs, and massive unemployment, lack of jobs outside the big cities, and economic uncertainty discourages people from having children. For instance, in Bosnia-Herzegovina, the total fertility rate in 2016 was only 1.28 children born/woman. Urbanization Some consider the increase of urbanization around the world a central cause. In recent times, residents of urban areas tend to have fewer children than people in rural areas. The need for extra labour from children on farms does not apply to urban-dwellers. Cities tend to have higher property prices, making a large family more expensive, especially in those societies where each child is now expected to have their own bedroom, rather than sharing with siblings as was the case until recently. Rural areas also tend to be more conservative, with less contraception and abortion than urban areas. Reduction of child labour Child labor is common in many parts of the world Countries which have a high fertility rate are usually less developed countries, where families rely on children to help them, with labour such as agricultural work, tending to livestock, or even paid work. In such countries child labour is quite common, with children bringing money at home, or actively supporting the family through physical work. By contrast, in high- income nations, child labour is banned, and it is parents who invest very high costs into their children.https://tad.colman.ac.il/paper-all/9868.pdf Views on the \\"ideal\\" family Although fertility rates are often discussed in terms of state policies (e.g. financial benefits, combining work with family etc.), the deeply entrenched social views on what constitutes an \\"ideal\\" family may play a crucial role: if parents do not envision large families in a positive way, it is difficult to \\"convince\\" them to have many children. In this regard, there are major differences between European countries: while 50.23% of women aged 15‚Äì39 state that the \\"ideal\\" family has 3 or more children in Estonia, and 46.43% say this in Finland; only 11.3% say this in Czech Republic, and 11.39% in Bulgaria.http://www.oecd.org/social/family/database.htm Contraception Changes in contraception are also an important cause, and one that has seen dramatic changes in the last few generations. Legalization and widespread acceptance of contraception in the developed world is a large factor in decreased fertility levels; however, for instance in a European context where its prevalence has always been very high in the modern era, the fertility rates do not seem to be influenced significantly by availability of contraception. While contraception can reduce the number of unwanted births and contribute to a smaller ideal family size, contraception does not start fertility reductions nor substantially effect their size, with these being attributable to other factors.Leridon, H., 2006. Demographic effects of the introduction of steroid contraception in developed countries. Human Reproduction Update, 12(5), pp.603-616. Assisted reproductive technology The availability of assisted reproductive technology (ART) may foster delay of childbearing, because many couples think that it can solve any future fertility problems. Its effect on total fertility rate is extremely small but government support for it is beneficial for families. Human Development Index Human Development Index map. Darker is higher. The Human Development Index (HDI) is a composite statistic of life expectancy, education, and per capita income indicators, which are used to rank countries into four tiers of human development. A country scores higher HDI when the lifespan is higher, the education level is higher, and the GDP per capita is higher. There is a strong inverse correlation between the HDI and the fertility rate of the population: the higher the HDI, the lower the fertility rate. As of 2016, the countries with the highest fertility rate are Burundi, Mali, Somalia, Uganda, Burkina Faso, Zambia, Malawi, Angola, and Afghanistan; while most high-income countries have sub-replacement fertility rates. This is part of the fertility- income paradox, as these high fertility countries are very poor, and it may seem counter-intuitive for families there to have so many children. The inverse relationship between income and fertility has been termed a demographic-economic \\"paradox\\" by the notion that greater means would enable the production of more offspring as suggested by the influential Thomas Malthus. Government policies Some governments have launched programmes to reduce fertility rates and curb population growth. The People's Republic of China implemented a one-child policy for 35 years (from 1979 to 2015); this was relaxed to a two-child policy in 2016. RMB 25,000 in social compensation fees were owed in 2005, for violation of the one child policy. Thus far 11,500 RMB had been collected, so another 13,500 RMB had to be collected. Although today Singapore has a low fertility rate, and the government encourages parents to have more children because birth rates have fallen below the replacement rate, in the 1970s the situation was the opposite: the government wished to slow and reverse the boom in births that started after World War II. Ability to choose The total fertility rate is also influenced by the ability to choose what type of family to have, if and when to have children, and the number of children to have - free from coercion, pressure, or interference from the community, extended family, state or church. This includes prohibition on practices such as child marriage, forced marriage or bride price. In some cultures for instance, the payment of the bride price creates an obligation on the wife to have children, and failure to do so often results in threats and violence. PDF. High-income countries have substantially lower fertility rates, and increased childlessness, because people who remain childless or who have small families are less likely to be stigmatized. In many cultures childless women suffer discrimination, stigma, ostracism, and social isolation.  War  It has been shown, both historically and in the present day, that societies engaged in a prolonged state of war experience a substantial lag in fertility rate. The most notable examples of this phenomenon are accredited to the First and Second World Wars. Modeled by these examples, total war subjects individuals to intense social upheavals and a heavy psychological impact that forcefully prioritizes survival and economic stability over the need to reproduce for the duration of the conflict. Events like these subsequently pave way Haupt, A., Kane, T. T., & Haub, C. (2011). PRB's population handbook. Population reference bureau (sixth edition). for an active effort to repopulate, such as the \\"baby boom\\" after the Second World War. Tempo effect Japan, a highly developed country, has low fertility rates and a rapidly aging population Total fertility rate (TFR) is affected by a phenomenon called the tempo effect, which describes \\"distortions due to changes in the timing of births.\\" John Bongaarts and Griffith Feeney have suggested that this tempo effect is driving the decline of measured fertility rate in the developed world. Type of partnership A study of the United States and multiple countries in Europe came to the result that women who continue to cohabit rather than get married after birth have significantly lower probability of having a second child than married women in all countries except those in Eastern Europe. Another study, on the contrary, came to the result that cohabiting couples in France have equal fertility as married ones. A large survey in the United States came to the result that married women had an average of 1.9 children, compared to 1.3 among those cohabiting. The corresponding numbers for men were 1.7 and 1.1, respectively. The difference of 0.6 children for both sexes was expected to decrease to between 0.2 and 0.3 over the lifetime when correcting for the confounder that married people have their children earlier in life. In the United States, those who cohabit without marrying had increased fertility when the male earns considerably more than the female. Frequency of sex Another explanation for falling fertility could be a reduction in the frequency of sex. For example, according to the Japan Family Planning Association 2016 survey, 47.3% of the men and 47.1% of the women had not had sex with their spouse in the previous month. Social and government acceptance of non-traditional families In recent years, the marriage rate in many countries has decreased. As more young people reject traditional lifestyles that include marriage, the issue arises whether the state accepts non-traditional families such as those based on non-marital cohabitation, or whether it actively discourages non-marital childbearing. In high-income countries, the former position of accepting cohabiting couples and supporting them as a legitimate form of family has been connected with a higher fertility rate (e.g. Scandinavian countries, France, where most births occur outside of marriage) while the latter (such as East Asia - Japan, Hong Kong, Taiwan, Singapore) has been connected with a very low fertility rate. High investment per child Infant mortality rates, under age 1, in 2013. Sub-Saharan Africa has the highest infant mortality rate, as well as the highest TFR. People are more likely in modern society to invest strongly in the needs of their children, such as offering them the best education, shelter (a room only for the child), travel, cultural activities etc. In the past, when child mortality was high, people had more children, but invested less in them. Today, parents usually experience much less doubt about whether the child will live to adulthood, and so are more likely to strongly invest in that child. But strongly investing in each child makes it more difficult to have large numbers of children‚Äîa \\"quantity vs. quality trade-off\\" effect. Gender expectations and norms Social norms both within the family and in society at large determine fertility levels. The quality of couple relations in terms of support given to the woman matters, with studies on fertility in the high-income world showing a U-shaped relationship between gender equity within the couple and fertility: in countries with very low fertility rates, the probability of a woman to have the second child occurs at the extremes - either very low gender equality or very high gender equality. This is also reflected at a social level: countries that are neither sufficiently patriarchal to coerce women into having large families, nor sufficiently egalitarian to incentivize women to have more children through strong support (such as subsidized childcare and good support of working mothers), have very low fertility rates, especially among educated women. Where women are expected to 'choose' between their professional and public life, or having children, the more educated the woman is, the more likely she is to choose the former. The strong emphases on the domestic role of women in Germany (unlike Scandinavia and France) was described as the cause of the very low fertility in that country. Historical effects The Greek historian Polybius largely blamed the decline of the Hellenistic world on low fertility rates, writing in his work The Histories that: In a speech to Roman nobles, the Emperor Augustus commented on the low birthrates of the Roman elite: Upon the establishment of the Roman Empire, Emperor Augustus would introduce legislation to increase the birthrates of the Roman nobility. Some believe that not only the Great Recession, but the Great Depression, may have been the result of a decline in birthrates overall. Clarence L. Barber, an economist at the University of Manitoba, pointed out how demand for housing in the US, for example, began to decline in 1926, due to a decline in 'household formation' (marriage), due, he believed, to the effects of World War I upon society. In early 1929, US housing demand declined precipitously and the stock market crash followed in October of that same year. Attempts to increase the fertility rate One of the most forceful attempts to increase the TFR occurred in communist Romania between 1967 and 1990. Communist leader Nicolae Ceau»ôescu adopted a very aggressive natalist policy that included outlawing abortion and contraception, routine pregnancy tests for women, taxes on childlessness, and legal discrimination against childless people. This period was depicted in movies and documentaries (such as 4 Months, 3 Weeks and 2 Days, Children of the Decree). These policies increased birth rates during the period of policy implementation, but was followed by a decline due to increased illegal abortion. Ceau»ôescu's policy resulted in over 9,000 women who died due to illegal abortions, large numbers of children put into orphanages by parents who couldn't cope with raising them, street children in the 1990s (when many orphanages were closed and the children ended on the streets), and overcrowding in homes and schools. In addition, Ceau»ôescu's demographic policies are feared of having very serious effects in the future, because the generations born under Ceau»ôescu are large (especially the late 1960s and the 1970s), while those born in the 1990s and 2000s are very small. This is believed to cause a very serious demographic shock when the former generations retire, as there will be insufficient young people in the workforce to support the elderly.http://www.zf.ro/eveniment/ce-se-va-intampla-cand-vor-iesi-la- pensie-decreteii-cei-1-7-milioane-de-romani-care-sustin- economia-5997071http://www.zf.ro/eveniment/pensiile-decreteilor-sunt-o-bomba- cu-ceas-statul-le-poate-plati-15-din-salariu-la-batranete-10096647 Apart from Romania, a relatively similar policy of restricted reproductive rights during that period also existed in Communist Albania, under Enver Hoxha (see Abortion in Albania). In 2002, the government of Australia gave financial incentives to parents to have more children. This Baby Bonus was introduced explicitly to increase the birth rate. The birth rate in Australia did increase in the years after (see below). Current effects Population aging may pose an economic challenge to governments as the number of retired citizens drawing public pensions rises in relation to the number of workers. This has been raised as a political issue in France, Germany, and the United States where many people have advocated policy changes to encourage higher birth and immigration rates. Analysing data for 40 countries, Lee et al. show that fertility well above replacement and population growth would typically be most beneficial for government budgets. However, fertility near replacement and population stability would be most beneficial for standards of living when the analysis includes the effects of age structure on families as well as governments. And fertility moderately below replacement and population decline would maximize standards of living when the cost of providing capital for a growing labour force is taken into account. Forecasts thumbrightupright=1.35United Nation's population projections by location. Note the vertical axis is logarithmic and represents millions of people. Sub- replacement fertility does not automatically translate into a population decline because of increasing life expectancy and population momentum: recently high fertility rates produce a disproportionately young population, and younger populations have higher birth rates. This is why some nations with sub-replacement fertility still have a growing population, because a relatively large fraction of their population are still of child-bearing age. But if the fertility trend is sustained (and not compensated by immigration), it results in population ageing and/or population decline. This is already happening and impacts first most of the countries of Europe and East Asia. Current estimates expect the world's total fertility rate to fall below replacement levels by 2050, though population momentum continues to increase global population for several generations beyond that. The development of the world population is linked with concerns of overpopulation, sustainability and exceeding Earth's carrying capacity. Some governments, fearful of a future pensions crisis, have developed natalist policies to attempt to encourage more women to have children. Measures include increasing tax allowances for working parents, improving child-care provision, reducing working hours/weekend working in female-dominated professions such as healthcare and a stricter enforcement of anti-discrimination measures to prevent professional women's promotion prospects being hindered when they take time off work to care for children. Over recent years, the fertility rate has increased to around 2.0 in France and 1.9 in Britain and some other northern European countries, but the role of population policies in these trends is debated. In Italy, for example, natalist policies may have actually discouraged the Italian population from having more children. This \\"widespread resistance\\" was the result of the Italian government, at one point, taxing single persons and criminalizing abortion and even contraception. European analysts hope, with the help of government incentives and large-scale change towards family-friendly policies, to stall the population decline and reverse it by around 2030, expecting that most of Europe will have a slight natural increase by then. C. D. Howe Institute, for example, tries to demonstrate that immigration cannot be used to effectively counter population ageing. Cases of fertility rate increases in individual countries United States For twenty years, the total fertility rate in the United States remained relatively stable compared to much of the world At 1.84 it's now similar to other developed countries. New England has a rate similar to most Western European countries, while the South, Midwest, and border states have fertility rates slightly below replacement. Other developed countries Some other developed countries have experienced a temporary or permanent increase in their birth rate, including France, which recorded a TFR of over 2.00 in 2008; the United Kingdom where TFR increased from 1.64 in 2000 to 1.98 in 2010; Australia, where the birth rate rose from 1.73 in 2001 to 1.93 in 2007 and New Zealand, where the TFR was 2.2 in 2008. Israel is the only developed country that has never had sub-replacement fertility; a declining Arab and Bedouin fertility rate is countered by religious Jewish groups (mostly Haredim) with higher than average fertility rates. In addition, the (mostly non-religious) aliyah Jews from the former USSR shifted from a 1 child per woman fertility rate to an average fertility rate close to 2.2 children per woman. As of 2008, Israel's Jewish fertility rate is the highest among the industrial nations.

It also performs as an equestrian display team. Its name comes from the black uniforms that are still in use today. It is one of the \\"Big Four\\", the most prestigious classical riding academies in the world.Horse & Hound - 7 Things You Need to Know about the Portuguese School of Equestrian Art  History  The historic role of the Saumur School of Cavalry was to provide training for the officers and non-commissioned officers of the French cavalry. The style of equitation characteristic of the school was first taught by Fran√ßois Robichon de La Gu√©rini√®re, the French riding master to King Louis XV and author of the manual √âcole de Cavalerie published in 1731. In 1843, Fran√ßois Baucher introduced his method into the school. This event marked the beginning of a small \\"war\\" between the vicomte d'Aure (head of the school) and Baucher, which continued for several years. After World War II the mounted element of the French Army had been reduced to a few squadrons of North African spahis (disbanded in 1962) and the primarily ceremonial Cavalry of the Republican Guard. While the need for a purely military riding academy had almost vanished, the international prestige of French horsemanship ensured the survival of the Saumur training centre in the form of a national riding school under the Ministry of Sports. Accordingly, in 1972, the National School of √âquitation was constituted around the Cadre Noir, which provided its core teaching staff. Today, there are about 50 horses and a team of elite riders, usually limited to 22. The members of the Cadre Noir have either civilian or military status. Military and civilian riders are distinguished by the insignia on their collar: a grenade for the military or a sun for the civilians. Some of the riders have reached the highest level of international sport, being Olympic or world champions. The Cadre Noir mainly uses Thoroughbreds, Anglo-Arabians, Hanoverians and Selle Fran√ßais, but also keeps Lusitano horses to demonstrate the 16th and 17th century baroque style of riding. The Thoroughbreds and Anglo Arabians are used for the Grand Prix dressage, and perform individually, pas de deux (two horses), pas de trois (three horses), and d√ªe quantit√© (four or more horses). They may be either displayed in hand or ridden.

Construction was halted less than a year after it began and she was redesigned to improve her stability and buoyancy. Upon completion in 1879, the ship was placed in reserve until she was commissioned in 1884 for service with the Mediterranean Fleet. Upon her return 10 years later, she became a coast guard ship in Ireland for two years. The ship then became a depot ship in 1897 before she was reclassified as a second-class battleship in 1900. Dreadnought participated in the annual fleet manoeuvres for the next two years before she became a training ship in 1902. The ship was taken out of service three years later and sold for scrap in 1908. Background and design Dreadnought was originally named Fury and was designed by the Director of Naval Construction (DNC), Sir Edward Reed, as an improved and enlarged version of the preceding turret ships. The ship was laid down, fully framed and partially plated up to the bottom of the waterline belt armourBrown, location 2402 when work was ordered stopped in 1871 in light of the loss of the ironclad turret ship in a heavy storm the previous year. A Committee on Designs was formed in January 1871 to evaluate existing ship designs with special consideration as to their stability and buoyancy and found that the designs of Devastation and Fury were lacking in both qualities and needed to be modified.Parkes, pp. 192‚Äì94 Reed had resigned before Captain was lost and he vehemently opposed the changes made by the new DNC, Nathaniel Barnaby and his assistant, William White, himself a future DNC.Gardiner, p. 82 The main changes were to increase the beam by and widen Reed's armoured breastwork to cover the full width of the hull; this increased the ship's freeboard amidships which improved buoyancy and stability and provided additional, badly needed accommodation for the crew. In addition, the maximum thickness of the armour was increased from , it was extended all the way to the bow and reinforced the ram. Barnaby and White's initial plan was to extend the breastwork fore and aft, almost to the ends of the ship, but this was changed to run all the way to the ends after the results of 's sea trials in 1873‚Äì74 revealed that her low bow caused major problems in head seas. Other changes was the substitution of more economical inverted vertical compound- expansion steam engines for Reed's original horizontal, low-pressure engines, more powerful guns for the ones first chosen, and the fitting of hydraulic pumps to work the gun turrets.Parkes, pp. 206‚Äì08 Description Right elevation and deck plan of Dreadnought as depicted in Brassey's Naval Annual, 1888 Dreadnought had a length between perpendiculars of and was long overall, some longer than the Devastation class. She had a beam of , and a draught of . The ship displaced .Chesneau & Kolesnik, p. 24 Dreadnought was the first ship to have a longitudinal watertight bulkhead that divided the engine and boiler rooms down the centreline. Her crew consisted of 369 officers and ratings. She proved to be a very steady ship with minimal rolling, although she was very wet as high seas usually swept her deck from end to end.Parkes, pp. 207, 210 The ship was the first large ironclad to have two 3-cylinder inverted vertical compound-expansion steam engines. These were built by Humphry & Tennant and each drove a single four-bladed, propeller. Dreadnoughts engines were powered by a dozen cylindrical boilers with a working pressure of .Parkes, p. 207 The engines were designed to produce a total of for a speed of , this was more and faster than the Devastation class. Dreadnought reached a maximum speed of from during her sea trials. The ship carried a maximum of of coal, enough to steam at .Burt, pp. 12‚Äì15 Dreadnought was originally intended to be equipped with a pair of RML 12-inch rifled muzzle-loading guns in each turret, but these were replaced by RML 12.5-inch guns while the ship was being redesigned.Burt, p. 14 The shell of the 12.5-inch gun weighed while the gun itself weighed . The shell had a muzzle velocity of and was credited with the ability to penetrate a nominal of wrought iron armour at the muzzle.Chesneau & Kolesnik, p. 6 The gun turrets were rotated by steam power and loaded by hydraulic power.Parkes, p. 209 The ship had a complete wrought iron, waterline armour belt that was thick amidships and tapered to outside the armoured citadel towards the ends of the ship. The armour plates were tapered to a thickness of 8 inches at their bottom edge and they extended above the waterline and below it. The armoured citadel protected the bases of the gun turrets, the funnel uptakes and the crew's quarters. The sides of the citadel were thick and it had thick curved ends.Parkes, pp. 207, 209‚Äì10 The turrets were protected by two plates, each backed by wood. The aft 13-inch bulkhead of the original design was retained, but the forward one was made redundant by the forward extension of the belt. The conning tower ranged in thickness from and the upper deck was thick inside the citadel and outside. Construction and career Dreadnought entering harbour, probably before 1885 Dreadnought, the fifth ship of her name to serve in the Royal Navy,Colledge, p. 102 was laid down on 10 September 1870 at No. 2 Slip, Pembroke Dockyard, Wales with the name of Fury. Construction was subsequently halted for a time in 1871 to redesign the ship and she was Phillips, pp. 206‚Äì07 renamed Dreadnought on 1 February 1875.Silverstone, p. 225 The renamed ship was launched on 8 March by Mrs. Agnes Wood, daughter of William Courtenay, 11th Earl of Devon. She was completed on 15 February 1879 at a cost of ¬£619,739. The ship was then immediately placed in reserve until 1884 when she was commissioned for service with the Mediterranean Fleet. Dreadnought was fitted with ten 1-inch (25 mm) Nordenfelt guns on the hurricane deck when she was commissioned. The ship sailed for the Mediterranean Sea on 14 October and remained there for the next decade.Parkes, pp. 209, 211 The future King George V served aboard in 1886‚Äì88. She returned to British waters in September 1894 and began a refit at Chatham DockyardPhillips, pp. 207‚Äì08 that included the replacement of her Nordenfelt guns with six quick-firing (QF) 6-pounder and ten QF 3-pounder Hotchkiss guns. Dreadnought became a coast guard ship at Bantry Bay, Ireland in March 1895.Parkes, p. 211 Two years later, in March 1897, she was relieved of that duty and became a depot ship in July at Devonport.Phillips, p. 208 The ship was reboilered and had more QF guns installed in 1898. Dreadnought was reclassified as a second-class battleship in 1900 and took part in British fleet manoeuvres in that year and the following one. In June 1902, she was refitted at Chatham to serve as a tender to HMS Defiance, torpedo school ship at Devonport, and later as a depot ship. She took part in the fleet review held at Spithead on 16 August 1902 for the coronation of King Edward VII, and was commissioned as tender four days later, on 20 August 1902. Lieutenant Harry Louis d‚Ä≤Estoteville Skipwith was appointed in command in October 1902. She was taken out of service and transferred to the Kyles of Bute in 1905. The ship was sold to Thos W Ward's for scrap for ¬£23,000 on 14 July 1908 and was broken up by February 1909.

State of Oklahoma, ex rel. Williamson, 316 U.S. 535 (1942), was the United States Supreme Court ruling. that held that laws permitting the compulsory sterilization of criminals are unconstitutional if the sterilization law treats similar crimes differently.Maggs, Gregory E. and Smith, Peter J. (2011) Constitutional Law. A Contemporary Approach. Thomson Reuters. p. 536. The relevant Oklahoma law applied to \\"habitual criminals,\\" but the law excluded white-collar crimes from carrying sterilization penalties. The Court held that treating similar crimes differently violated the Equal Protection Clause of the 14th Amendment. Background Under Oklahoma's Habitual Criminal Sterilization Act of 1935, the state could impose a sentence of compulsory sterilization as part of their judgment against individuals who had been convicted three or more times of crimes \\"amounting to felonies involving moral turpitude.\\" The defendant, Jack T. Skinner, had been convicted once for chicken-stealing and twice for armed robbery. The motivation behind the law was primarily eugenic: to try to weed out \\"unfit\\" individuals from the gene pool. Criminal sterilization laws like the one in Oklahoma were designed to target \\"criminality,\\" believed by some at the time to possibly be a hereditary trait . Most punitive sterilization laws, including the Oklahoma statute, prescribed vasectomy as the method of rendering the individual infertile (which, unlike castration, does not affect sexual urge or function) in males, and salpingectomy in females (a relatively invasive operation, requiring heavy sedation, and hence with more risks to personal well-being). Majority opinion The exception for white collar crimes was chiefly behind the ruling. The Court held unanimously that the Act violated the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, because white-collar crimes, such as embezzlement, were excluded from the Act's jurisdiction. Justice William O. Douglas concluded: :Oklahoma makes no attempt to say that he who commits larceny by trespass or trick or fraud has biologically inheritable traits which he who commits embezzlement lacks. We have not the slightest basis for inferring that line has any significance in eugenics, nor that the inheritability of criminal traits follows the neat legal distinctions which the law has marked between those two offenses. In terms of fines and imprisonment, the crimes of larceny and embezzlement rate the same under the Oklahoma code. Only when it comes to sterilization are the pains and penalties of the law different. The equal protection clause would indeed be a formula of empty words if such conspicuously artificial lines could be drawn. Furthermore, because of the social and biological implications of reproduction and the irreversibility of sterilization operations, Justice Douglas also stressed that compulsory sterilization laws in general should be held to strict scrutiny: :The power to sterilize, if exercised, may have subtle, far-reaching and devastating effects. In evil or reckless hands it can cause races or types which are inimical to the dominant group to wither and disappear. There is no redemption for the individual whom the law touches. Any experiment which the State conducts is to his irreparable injury. He is forever deprived of a basic liberty. We mention these matters not to reexamine the scope of the police power of the States. We advert to them merely in emphasis of our view that strict scrutiny of the classification which a State makes in a sterilization law is essential, lest unwittingly, or otherwise, invidious discriminations are made against groups or types of individuals in violation of the constitutional guaranty of just and equal laws. In a separate concurring opinion, Chief Justice Harlan F. Stone stated that he disagreed with the majority opinion's reliance on the Equal Protection Clause and instead cited the Due Process Clause to prevent Skinner from being sterilized. The Oklahoma courts did not allow Skinner to call expert witnesses, who might have testified that he did not have any criminal genes and would not be likely to have children who would grow up to become criminals. So, in Chief Justice Stone's view, the state denied Skinner due process by not allowing him to defend himself effectively against the punishment of being sterilized. Aftermath The only types of sterilization which the ruling immediately ended were punitive sterilization; it did not directly comment on compulsory sterilization of the mentally disabled or mentally ill and was not a strict overturning of the Court's ruling in Buck v. Bell (1927). Furthermore, most of the over 64,000 sterilizations performed in the US under the aegis of eugenics legislation were not in prison institutions or performed on convicted criminals; punitive sterilizations made up only negligible amounts of the total operations performed, as most states and prison officials were nervous about their legal status, which were not affirmed in Buck v. Bell specifically, as possible violations of the Eighth (\\"cruel and unusual punishment\\") or Fourteenth Amendments (\\"Due Process\\" and \\"Equal Protection Clauses\\"). Compulsory sterilizations of the mentally disabled and mentally ill continued in the US in significant numbers until the early 1960s. Although many of their laws stayed on the books for many years longer, the last known forced sterilization in the United States occurred in 1981 in Oregon. Federal law prohibits use of federal funds to sterilize \\"any mentally incompetent or institutionalized individual,\\" but states including California use state funds for tubal ligations. A 2013 report showed that between 2006 and 2010, at least 148 women were sterilized after childbirth while incarcerated in two California prisons. In violation of state rules passed in 1994, none of the cases were reviewed by a state oversight committee. Over a third of all compulsory sterilizations in the United States (over 22,670) took place after Skinner v. Oklahoma. The 1942 ruling, however, created a nervous legal atmosphere regarding these other forms of sterilizations and put a heavy damper on sterilization rates which had boomed since the Buck v. Bell ruling in 1927. After the discovery of the Nazi atrocities done in the name of eugenics, including the compulsory sterilization of 450,000 individuals in barely more than a decade, under a sterilization law, which drew heavy inspiration from American statutes, and the close association between eugenics and racism, eugenics, as an ideology, lost almost all public favor. In Equal Protection analysis, Skinner applied the compelling state interest test to punitive sterilization, and Buck applied the less rigorous rational basis test to compulsory sterilization of the mentally disabled. In 2002, the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit held that an inmate, incarcerated by the California Department of Corrections and serving a life sentence, was not permitted to inseminate his wife artificially because \\"the right to procreate is fundamentally inconsistent with incarceration.\\" The Appellate Court distinguished the case from Skinner v. Oklahoma because \\"the right to procreate while incarcerated and the right to be free from surgical sterilization by prison officials are two very different things.\\" See also *List of United States Supreme Court cases, volume 316 *Eugenics *Compulsory sterilization *Buck v.

He began his career playing R&B; for Earl Bostic and later soul jazz recording for the Blue Note label from 1960, touched on jazz fusion during a stint on CTI in the 1970s. He was described by critic Steve Huey as \\"renowned for his distinctively thick, rippling tone [and] earthy grounding in the blues.\\" Turrentine was married to organist Shirley Scott in the 1960s, with whom he frequently recorded, and was the younger brother of trumpeter Tommy Turrentine. Turrentine at Bach Dancing & Dynamite Society, Half Moon Bay, California, August 13, 1989 Biography Turrentine was born in Pittsburgh's Hill District into a musical family. His father, Thomas Turrentine, Sr., was a saxophonist with Al Cooper's Savoy Sultans, his mother played stride piano, and his older brother Tommy Turrentine became a professional trumpet player. He began his prolific career with blues and rhythm and blues bands, and was at first greatly influenced by Illinois Jacquet. In the 1950s, he went on to play with the groups of Lowell Fulson and Earl Bostic. In Bostic's group, he replaced John Coltrane in 1953 and also played in groups led by the pianist and composer Tadd Dameron. Turrentine received his only formal musical training during his military stint in the mid-1950s. In 1959, he left the military and went straight into the band of the drummer Max Roach. He married the organist Shirley Scott in 1960 and the two frequently played and recorded together. In the 1960s, he started working with organist Jimmy Smith, and made many soul jazz recordings both with Smith and as a leader. Scott and Turrentine divorced in 1971. Turrentine turned to jazz fusion and signed for Creed Taylor's CTI label. His first album for CTI, Sugar, recorded in 1970, proved one of his biggest successes and a seminal recording for the label. He worked with Freddie Hubbard, Milt Jackson, George Benson, Bob James, Richard Tee, Idris Muhammad, Ron Carter, Grant Green and Eric Gale, to name a few. He returned to soul jazz in the 1980s and into the 1990s. Turrentine lived in Fort Washington, Maryland, from the early 1990s until his death. He died of a stroke in New York City on September 12, 2000, and was buried in Pittsburgh's Allegheny Cemetery. On June 25, 2019, The New York Times Magazine listed Stanley Turrentine among hundreds of artists whose material was reportedly destroyed in the 2008 Universal fire.

The competition was started by BBC Wales in 1983 to celebrate the opening of St David's Hall in Cardiff, Wales, home of the BBC National Orchestra of Wales. The creation of the competition was overseen by Geraint Stanley Jones, who was the controller at BBC Wales at the time. Auditions are held throughout the world in the autumn before the competition, with singers being selected to take part in Cardiff the following June. Each singer represents their own country. In Wales is there a competition to select the national representative. The winner of the Welsh Singers Showcase represents Wales in BBC Cardiff Singer of the World competition. The competition is judged by a panel of distinguished singers, musicians and music professionals. In 2003 an audience prize was also introduced for the primary competition; in 2011 it was renamed the Dame Joan Sutherland Audience Prize to mark the passing of the singer who was the competition's first patron. History In 1983, the first year of the competition, eighteen singers participated. The winner was Finnish soprano Karita Mattila. Bryn Terfel won the Lieder Prize in 1989 A Lieder Prize was introduced in 1989, as art song and opera are both important forms of singing, but very different. The 1989 competition was particularly noteworthy with Welsh baritone Bryn Terfel winning the Lieder prize and Russian baritone Dmitri Hvorostovsky taking the overall title. Both singers have gone on to enjoy extremely successful careers with international acclaim. The \\"Song Prize\\" (formerly the \\"Lieder Prize\\") was renamed in 2001 in order to clarify that it applies to art song and folksong rather than German Lieder only. The \\"Song Prize\\" became a separate event in 2003, named as the BBC Cardiff Singer of the World Rosenblatt Recital Song Prize. However, after 2009, its name was changed to BBC Cardiff Singer of the World Song Prize. It is not compulsory, and the only entry requirement is that the singer is taking part in the primary competition. It is not possible to enter for the \\"Song Prize\\" only.https://www.bbc.co.uk/wales/cardiffsinger/sites/about/pages/rules.shtml In 2001, Romanian tenor Marius Brenciu became the first singer to win both prizes. Finnish baritone Tommi Hakala won in 2003, with the Song Prize going to Irish soprano Ailish Tynan. The first \\"Audience Prize\\", voted for by the audience both in the hall and for the broadcasts, was awarded to Chilean soprano Angela Marambio. The 2005 prize was won by American soprano Nicole Cabell, with English tenor Andrew Kennedy winning the \\"Song Prize\\" and the \\"Audience Prize\\" being won by Korean soprano Ha-Joung Lee. Chinese singer Shen Yang (subsequently known as Shenyang) won the 2007 competition, The \\"Song Prize\\" was won by English soprano Elizabeth Watts, while Jacques Imbrailo, South African baritone, won the \\"Audience Prize\\". In 2009, the winner was Russian soprano Ekaterina Scherbachenko. The winner of the \\"Song Prize\\" was bass Jan Martinik from the Czech Republic and Italian tenor Giordano Luca took the \\"Audience Prize\\". 2011 winner, Valentina Naforni»õƒÉ Followed a revised format and schedule, the 2011 competition had 20 singers taking part in four preliminary concerts. The 2011 winner was Moldovan soprano Valentina Naforni»õƒÉ, who also won the newly renamed \\"Dame Joan Sutherland Audience Prize\\". The \\"Song Prize\\" was won by Ukrainian baritone Andrei Bondarenko. The 30th anniversary competition took place between 16 and 23 June 2013. It was won by US mezzo-soprano Jamie Barton, who also won the \\"Song Prize\\". The \\"Dame Joan Sutherland Audience Prize\\" was won by English tenor Ben Johnson. Many non-winning finalists have gone on to very distinguished operatic careers. Examples include Finnish soprano Soile Isokoski in 1987, Swedish dramatic soprano Nina Stemme in 1993 and Latvian mezzo-soprano Elina Garanca in 2001 . Organisation The competition is organised by BBC Cymru Wales and was televised nationwide by BBC Two until 2013 and on BBC Four since 2003 (BBC Knowledge in 2001). Additionally, the competition is televised by BBC Two Wales, in Welsh on S4C and broadcast over radio channels BBC Radio 3, BBC Radio Wales and the Welsh language BBC Radio Cymru. All coverage can also be found on BBC iPlayer. It is supported by Welsh National Opera and the City and County of Cardiff. From 2003, the competition's first patron was Dame Joan Sutherland, until her death in 2010.https://www.bbc.co.uk/wales/cardiffsinger/sites/news/pages/dame-joan- sutherland.shtml Since 2011, the patron has been Dame Kiri Te Kanawa.

Built-in inflation is one of three major determinants of the current inflation rate. In Robert J. Gordon's triangle model of inflation, the current inflation rate equals the sum of demand-pull inflation, cost-push inflation, and built-in inflation. \\"Demand-pull inflation\\" refers to the effects of falling unemployment rates (rising real gross domestic product) in the Phillips curve model, while the other two factors lead to shifts in the Phillips curve. The built-in inflation originates from either persistent demand-pull or large cost-push (supply-shock) inflation in the past. It then becomes a \\"normal\\" aspect of the economy, via inflationary expectations and the price/wage spiral. *Inflationary expectations play a role because if workers and employers expect inflation to persist in the future, they will increase their (nominal) wages and prices now. (See real vs. nominal in economics.) This means that inflation happens now simply because of subjective views about what may happen in the future. Following the generally accepted theory of adaptive expectations, such inflationary expectations arise because of persistent past experience with inflation. *The price/wage spiral is the adversarial nature of bargaining about wages in modern capitalism. It is part of the conflict theory of inflation. Workers and employers usually do not get together to agree on the value of real wages. Instead, workers attempt to protect their real wages from falling in response to inflation (or to attain a target real wage) by pushing for higher money (nominal) wages. Thus, if they expect price inflation ‚Äì or have experienced price inflation in the past ‚Äì they push for higher nominal wages. If they are successful, this raises the costs faced by their employers. To protect the real value of their profits (or to attain a target profit rate or rate of return on investment), employers then pass the higher costs on to consumers in the form of higher prices. This encourages workers to push for higher nominal wages because these price rises raise their cost of living; so the inflationary cycle reinforces itself. In the end, built-in inflation involves a vicious circle of both subjective and objective elements, so that inflation encourages inflation to persist. It means that the standard methods of fighting inflation using monetary policy or fiscal policy to induce a recession are extremely expensive, i.e. they can cause large rises in unemployment and large falls in real gross domestic product. This suggests that alternative methods such as wage and price controls (incomes policies) may also be needed in the fight against inflation.

The BBC NOW is the only professional symphony orchestra organisation in Wales, occupying a dual role as both a broadcasting orchestra and national orchestra. The BBC NOW has its administrative base in Cardiff, at the BBC Hoddinott Hall on the site of the Wales Millennium Centre, since January 2009. The BBC NOW is the orchestra-in-residence at St David's Hall, Cardiff, and also performs regularly throughout Wales and beyond, including international tours and annual appearances at the Royal Albert Hall in London at the BBC Proms. Broadcasting work includes studio sessions for BBC Radio and television, although the orchestra's concerts form the bulk of its broadcasts, transmitted primarily on BBC Radio 3 but also on BBC Radio Wales, BBC Radio Cymru and BBC television. The orchestra records many soundtracks for BBC television, including Doctor Who, Torchwood, Human Planet, and Earthflight. History Entrance to the BBC Hoddinott Hall The precursor ensemble of the BBC NOW was the Cardiff Station Orchestra, which was founded in 1924 and had developed into the National Orchestra of Wales by 1928. Funding problems resulted in the disbandment of this orchestra in 1931. In 1935, the BBC Welsh Orchestra was established as a 20-member ensemble, but the orchestra was dissolved with the advent of the Second World War in 1939. After the war, the BBC Welsh Orchestra was revived as a 31-member ensemble, with Mansel Thomas as its first principal conductor. In 1947, the BBC Welsh Chorus was founded as the affiliate chorus of the orchestra. The orchestra's ensemble size increased steadily, reaching 44 musicians in the 1960‚Äì1961 season, 60 musicians in 1974, and 66 musicians in 1976, when the orchestra's name was changed to the BBC Welsh Symphony Orchestra. It reached a full symphonic complement of 88 players in 1987 before being reduced to its current level of 78 players in 2014 as part of BBC savings delivered by Director at the time, Michael Garvey, who also made reductions to the administrative and management team through redundancies. In the 1970s, a new chorus to supplant the former BBC Welsh Chorus, the BBC Welsh Choral Society, was established. In 1993, the orchestra was renamed the BBC National Orchestra of Wales, to reflect more suitably its special role as both a national orchestra and a BBC Performing Group. In parallel, the chorus was renamed the BBC National Chorus of Wales. Both the orchestra and the chorus engage in outreach work through their Education and Community Outreach department, which creates access to the players and singers for Welsh schools, groups, communities and musicians of all abilities. The BBC Hoddinott Hall Tadaaki Otaka, principal conductor from 1987 to 1995, is currently the BBC NOW's conductor laureate. Richard Hickox, principal conductor from 2000 to 2006, was the orchestra's conductor emeritus until his death in November 2008. In July 2011, the BBC NOW announced the appointment of Thomas S√∏nderg√•rd as its 14th principal conductor, effective with the 2012‚Äì2013 season, for an initial contract of 4 years. In February 2016, the BBC NOW announced the further extension of S√∏nderg√•rd's contract as principal conductor through \\"at least 2018\\". S√∏nderg√•rd formally concluded his tenure as principal conductor in July 2018. Past principal guest conductors have included Mariss Jansons, James Loughran and Jac van Steen. Fran√ßois-Xavier Roth was the past associate guest conductor of the BBC NOW. In December 2015, the BBC NOW announced the appointment of Xian Zhang as its next principal guest conductor, effective with the 2016‚Äì2017 season, with an initial contract of 3 years. She is the first female conductor named to a titled post with any BBC orchestra. Past Composers-in-Association have included B Tommy Andersson.

Construction involved the demolishing of the 'Steelworks End' of the ground, and the removal of the front rows of the other terraces. Matches had to be played with grass on top of boards which covered the speedway track, resulting in complaints from other teams. Such problems were influential in the decision of the Football League clubs' to votes against Barrow when the team had to seek re-election to the league following a bottom four finish in the Fourth Division at the end of the 1971‚Äì1972 season, and Barrow were demoted to the Northern Premier League. As it was, the speedway team 'Barrow Bombers' who operated from Holker Street did so only for two years from 1972 till 1974, when the track was removed due to its unpopularity amongst other football clubs. Non-league era Following demotion and the speedway era, Holker Street had become rather dilapidated. The remaining stands were demolished due to Health and Safety concerns, though a cover was retained for the 'Popular Side' and terracing was pushed closer to the pitch following the removal of the speedway track. The CrossBar leisure club and bar was subsequently built at the former Steelworks End as part of a job creation scheme; this remains a dominant feature of the ground and is now the match day hospitality suite, as well as a conference centre.

It is housed in the Grade II listed, neo-gothic former Oozells Street Board School, designed by John Henry Chamberlain in 1877. The gallery's current director is Jonathan Watkins. Ikon was set up to encourage the public to engage in contemporary art. As a result, the gallery delivers an off-site Education and Interpretation scheme to educate audiences, and to promote artists and their work. The gallery is open every day of the week except Mondays, though it opens on bank holiday Mondays. Featured artworks include all forms of media including sound, sculpture and photography as well as paintings. Exhibitions rotate throughout the year so that as many pieces can be displayed as possible. Ikon is a registered charity which is partly funded by Birmingham City Council and Arts Council of England. History The Ikon Gallery logo just inside the entrance to the gallery \\"The Ikon\\" (as it is colloquially known) was founded by art collector Angus Skene and four artists from the Birmingham School of Art, David Prentice, Sylvani Merilion, Jesse Bruton and Robert Groves. The collection began after Skene bought Prentice's painting Kate and the Waterlilies in 1964, and the two started discussions about the lack of support for contemporary artists provided by Birmingham's existing artistic institutions. The gallery was originally conceived as a \\"gallery without walls\\", with exhibitions planned to tour unconventional locations such as cinemas and post offices in a motorcycle sidecar The gallery was then eventually established in 1965 in an octagonal glass-walled kiosk in Birmingham's then-new Bull Ring shopping centre. The gallery's first exhibition displayed work by John Salt. The venue was then staffed by the founding artists and sometimes their spouses on a voluntary basis. The gallery's venture was funded by Skene, but organisational control of the gallery was left in the hands of the artists. The name of the gallery was coined by Groves, who was interested in the icons of the Eastern Orthodox Church. The name was agreed by the other founders partly on the basis that it \\"divides beautifully geometrically and was splendid in all directions\\". In Ikon's founding prospectus it declares: > \\"Ikon is intended as an antithesis to exclusive art establishments and > galleries ‚Ä¶ it has been formed because of the need for an accessible place > where the exchange of visual ideas can become a familiar reality\\" The lease on the kiosk expired after three years, but with Arts Council support the gallery was able to move to the former mortuary in the basement of Queens College in Swallow Street in 1968 and appointed Jeanette Koch as gallery manager.[3] During the next 4 years Ikon held 93 exhibitions and 40 group shows,[6] by which time the lease on the Swallow Street premises came to an end. Under the direction of Simon Chapman (who had previously run the Birmingham Arts Lab) assisted by Jeanette Koch, the gallery embarked on an ambitious expansion of broadening the exhibition programme to include the works of nationally and internationally recognised artists, and to move to a busier location in order to gain greater interest from a wider public. In the autumn of 1972, with increased financial support of The Arts Council together with new funding from West Midlands Arts Association, The Gulbenkian Foundation and a number of local charitable trusts and industry, Ikon re- located in The Birmingham Shopping Centre, a newly built shopping mall above New Street station. The fitting out of the gallery was designed by Walter Thomson of Associated Architects and provided a space four times larger than the Swallow Street gallery and virtually forty times larger than the original Bull Ring kiosk. The number of visitors to the gallery rocketed into the hundreds and on occasions peaked at over a thousand a day providing many with their first opportunity of seeing modern and contemporary art by living artists. The opening show of large chalk on blackboard wall drawings by John Walker firmly established Birmingham as a city with a gallery devoted to the contemporary visual arts. During the next 6 years, Ikon became positioned as one of the most important contemporary art galleries outside London, attracting both exhibitors and visitors from far beyond the city. Among the artists who had solo exhibitions were Ivor Abrahams, Allen Barker, Barry Burman, John Copnall, Vaughan Grylls, Trevor Halliday, David Hepher, Harry Holland, David Leveritt, John Mitchell, John Salt, Peter Sedgely, David Shepherd, William Tillyer and Roger Westwood. Notable group shows included Midland Art Now featuring the work of 20 of the most prominent Midlands based artists including Roy Abell, Barrie Cook, John Farrington, Dick French, William Gear, Colin Hitchmough, John Melville, David Prentice and Peter Tarrant, and which was accompanied by a full colour printed broadsheet catalogue distributed free to the 40,000 readers of the Birmingham Post. Ikon replaced the Birmingham Museum and Art Gallery as the venue for travelling exhibitions of contemporary art such as Diane Arbus curated by John Szarkowski, Chris Orr curated by Nick Serota, Objects and Documents featuring works selected by Richard Smith, An Element of Landscape curated by Jeremy Rees, The Human Clay featuring works selected by R. B. Kitaj, and Berenice Abbott. A Real Birmingham Family by Gillian Wearing, with the Library of Birmingham (left) and Baskerville House in the background By 1978, Ikon had again outgrown its premises and it moved to a former carpet shop in John Bright Street adjacent to the Alexandra Theatre. The gallery moved to its current site, the former Oozells Street Board School, in 1997 with the cost of the conversion partly funded by a grant from the National Lottery. The refurbishment work was designed by Levitt Bernstein, who reinstated the building's tower, which had been demolished during the 1960s. Caf√© Ikon, on the ground floor, was designed by Birmingham-based architects The Space Studio and opened in December 1998. Form, Space & Order were the contractors.

He amassed Primeira Liga totals of 227 matches and 57 goals over 11 seasons, at the service of Lusitano, Belenenses and Porto. After retiring, Pedroto embarked in a coaching career which lasted 22 years (always in the Portuguese top division), going on to become one of Porto's most successful managers. Playing career Club Born in the village of Almacave in Lamego, Viseu District, Pedroto began his senior career with Lusitano F.C. in Vila Real de Santo Ant√≥nio, to where he had been relocated to perform his military service. In February 1950, he scored two of his 12 goals for the season in home wins against FC Porto (3‚Äì1) and Sporting CP (2‚Äì0), as the Primeira Liga title was eventually awarded to S.L. Benfica. In 1950, the 21-year-old Pedroto signed with Lisbon-based C.F. Os Belenenses after being offered a position in the Navy Ministry. He joined Porto two years later, for 335.000 escudos. Pedroto won the national championship twice during his spell at the Est√°dio das Antas, under Dorival Yustrich and B√©la Guttmann. He retired at the age of 31, being immediately named his last club's junior coach. International Over five years, Pedroto won 17 caps for Portugal. He made his debut on 20 April 1952, in a 3‚Äì0 friendly loss to France. Coaching career After becoming a manager, Pedroto was initially in charge of Acad√©mica de Coimbra. He then spent one season apiece with Leix√µes S.C. and Varzim SC, being dismissed by the former midway through 1964‚Äì65 which marked the only occasion in his career where he was relieved of his duties; subsequently, he returned to Porto as an assistant. Over three top-tier campaigns, Pedroto led Porto to the third place twice and the second in 1968‚Äì69, winning the Ta√ßa de Portugal in 1968, He left, however, for Vit√≥ria de Set√∫bal, who would finish a best-ever league runners-up in 1971‚Äì72 and twice reach the quarter-finals of the Inter-Cities Fairs Cup while he was in charge, notably ousting Liverpool in the second round of the 1969‚Äì70 edition of the latter tournament. Starting in 1974 and during two years, Pedroto coached both Boavista F.C. and the Portuguese national team. He won the domestic cup always during his tenure at the former, also finishing in second position in the league in the 1975‚Äì76 season. With the latter, he did not manage to qualify for UEFA Euro 1976 in spite of only losing one match in Group 1. Pedroto returned to Porto ahead of 1976‚Äì77, ending a 19-year drought the following campaign by winning the championship and repeating the feat the next season. He was, however, fired in the summer of 1980 after a run-in with president Am√©rico de S√°. He arguably set the foundations for the club's European exploits in the mid-to-late 1980s. For several decades, Pedroto was the manager with the most wins in the Portuguese top flight with 326. His sides excelled in ball possession and attacking football, and he was also one of the first managers to introduce a team physician; he was accused by fellow coach M√°rio Wilson of being a \\"master of conflict\\", with the pair being often involved in wars of words. Personal life and death Pedroto was affectionately known as \\"Z√© do Bon√©\\" (Cap Joe), due to his habit of wearing a flat tweed cap all the time. He was an avid fisher and reader, who also took an interest in the occult. Pedroto died on 7 January 1985 in Porto at the age of 56, due to cancer.

In France, Italy, Sweden, Finland, Argentina, Belgium, the Netherlands, Brazil, the United Kingdom, the Republic of Ireland, Australia, Nigeria, Greece, Uruguay and Colombia, P&G; markets similar toothpaste formulations under the Oral-B brand. History Crest was introduced in the United States as \\"Fluoristan\\" in 1954, as it contained stannous fluoride. In 1955, the name of the product was changed to \\"Crest with Fluoristan.\\" The composition of the toothpaste had been developed by Joseph C. Muhler, Harry Day, and William H. Nebergall at Indiana University, and was patented by Nebergall. Procter & Gamble paid royalties from use of the patent and thus financed a new dental research institute at this university (\\"The House that Crest built\\").Harry G.

Today, Crest toothpastes use sodium fluoride, or \\"Dentifrice with Fluoristat\\"; Crest Pro-Health uses stannous fluoride again and an abrasive whitener together called \\"Polyfluorite\\". Crest is accepted by the American Dental Association (ADA), as well as by equivalent dental associations in other countries. One notable ad campaign from the brand was in the late 1970s and early 1980s, written and produced by Gregory Sinnott, where animated ads featured the \\"Cavity Creeps\\", a group of grey- colored, rocky humanoid creatures bent on destroying the city of \\"Toothopolis\\" (essentially an island city protected by an enormous wall of teeth), with their signature battle cry \\"We Make, Holes In Teeth!\\" They were defeated time and again by the \\"Crest Team\\", a group of people dressed in Crest-themed jumpsuits, who wielded giant toothbrushes and tubes of Crest to not only ward off the Cavity Creeps but to protect the wall as well. The team would encourage kids at the end of each commercial to \\"watch treats and see your dentist\\" so they could fight cavities \\"like the Crest Team\\". From 2004 to 2010, Crest sold dental floss under the Crest Glide brand. Which is now called Oral-B Glide. The original Crest logo was designed by Donald Deskey. In 2014, Crest Fresh and White were introduced as a replacement for the discontinued Gleem brand.  Manufacturing Plants  Crest products are made in North America according to Procter & Gamble. Their main manufacturing plant is located in Greensboro, NC. A few products are manufactured in Guanajuato, Mexico.  Product line  Crest has also been associated with about twenty brands of dental care products, including toothpaste, toothbrushes, mouthwash, dental floss, and a tooth-whitening product called Crest Whitestrips. Crest Toothpaste has a total of eight product lines: * Gum Health * 3D White * Kid's Crest * Pro-Health * Sensitivity * Enamel * Clean + Fresh * Future-Proof Crest Pro-Health mouthwash side effects Tooth staining Crest Pro- Health mouthwash contains Cetylpyridinium chloride which is known to cause tooth staining in approximately 3 percent of users. Crest has noted that this staining is actually an indication that the product is working as intended, as the stains are a result of bacteria dying on the teeth. Crest stated that because of the low incidence of staining, there was no need to label Pro- Health mouthwash as a potential tooth stainer. However, after numerous complaints and a federal class-action lawsuit, which was later dismissed, the mouthwash now contains a label warning consumers of its potential to stain teeth. Reducing premature birth The use of Crest Pro-Health mouthwash during pregnancy has been shown to be associated with a decrease in preterm births, presumably because the mouthwash reduces the severity of periodontal disease, which is directly linked to preterm births. Timeline * 1955, Crest with Fluoristan was launched in a number of test markets in the United States. * In January 1956, Crest was launched nationally. * In 1960, the American Dental Association issued a report confirming that the toothpaste is effective in preventing tooth decay. * In 1976, the American Chemical Society names Crest with fluoride one of the greatest discoveries in the past 100 years.

It used a clever arrangement of internal transfer ports and a single pushrod-operated exhaust valve to replace the many moving parts found on more conventional rotary engines, and made the Monosoupape engines some of the most reliable of the era. British aircraft designer Thomas Sopwith described the Monosoupape as \\"one of the greatest single advances in aviation\\". Produced under license in both seven and nine-cylinder versions in large numbers in most industrialized countries including Germany (by Oberursel), Russia, Italy, Britain and the US. Two differing nine-cylinder versions were produced, the 9B-2 and 9N, with differing displacements giving the larger displacement 9N version a nearly-cylindrical shaped crankcase, with the 9N also adopting a dual ignition system for increased flight safety. 2,188 units were produced under license in Britain, with an uprated version later built in Russia and the Soviet Union, two of which flew the Soviet TsAGI-1EA single lift-rotor helicopter in 1931-32.Savine, Alexandre. \\"TsAGI 1-EA.\\" ctrl-c.liu.se, 24 March 1997. Retrieved 12 December 2010.video Background Unlike other rotaries, the early Gnome engines like the Gnome Omega, Lambda and Delta used a unique arrangement of valves in order to eliminate pushrods that operated during the inlet phase of the combustion cycle on more conventional engines. Instead, a single exhaust valve on the cylinder head was operated by a pushrod that opened the valve when the pressure dropped at the end of the power stroke. A pressure-operated inlet valve, which was balanced by a counterweight to equalize the centrifugal forces, was placed in the centre of the piston crown, where it opened to allow the fuel‚Äìair charge to enter from the engine's central crankcase. Although ingenious, the system had several drawbacks: the cylinder heads had to be removed to perform maintenance of the intake valves, and to adjust the timing correctly. Fuel economy suffered in comparison to other rotaries because the inlet valves could not be opened and closed at the ideal times. Description In 1913, Louis Seguin and his brother Laurent (engineers who founded the Soci√©t√© Des Moteurs Gnome [the Gnome motor company] in 1905) introduced the new Monosoupape series, which eliminated the inlet valve, replacing it with piston-controlled transfer ports similar to those found in a two-stroke engine. Beginning with the power stroke, the four-stroke engine operated normally until the piston was just about to reach the bottom of its stroke (bottom dead center, or BDC), when the exhaust valve was opened \\"early\\". This let the still-hot burnt combustion gases \\"pop\\" out of the engine while the piston was still moving down, relieving exhaust pressure and preventing exhaust gases from entering the crankcase. After a small additional amount of travel, the piston uncovered 36 small ports around the base of the cylinder, leading to the crankcase which held additional fuel‚Äìair mixture (the charge). No transfer took place at this point since there was no pressure differential; the cylinder was still open to the air and thus at ambient pressure. The overhead valve exhausted directly into the slipstream since no exhaust manifold could be practically fitted to the spinning crankcase and cylinders. The lack of an exhaust manifold also saved weight and prevented excessive amounts of gyroscopic forces in flight. During the exhaust stroke, scavenging occurred as the air moving past the cylinder exterior lowered the pressure inside due to the direct exposure of the exhaust port to the slipstream. The piston continued its exhaust stroke until top dead center (TDC) was reached, but the valve remained open. The piston began to move down on its intake stroke with the valve still open, pulling new air into the cylinder. It remained open until it was two-thirds of the way down, at which point the valve closed and the remainder of the intake stroke greatly reduced the air pressure. When the piston uncovered the transfer ports again, the low pressure in the cylinder drew in the balance of the charge. The charge was an overly rich mixture of air, which was acquired through the hollow crankshaft, and fuel that was continuously injected by a fuel nozzle on the end of a fuel line, entering the crankcase through the hollow crankshaft. The nozzle was in the proximity of, and aimed at, the inside base of the cylinder where the transfer ports were located. The fuel nozzle was stationary with the crankshaft, and the cylinders rotated into position in turn. The compression stroke was conventional. The spark plug was installed horizontally into the rear of the cylinder at the top but had no connecting high-voltage wire. An internal-tooth ring gear mounted on the engine drove a stationary magneto mounted on the firewall, whose high-voltage output terminal was in close proximity to the spark plug terminals as they passed by. This arrangement eliminated the need for distributor and high-voltage wiring found in conventional mechanically timed ignition systems. This ring gear also drove the oil pump, which supplied oil to all bearings, and through hollow pushrods to the rockers and valves and also drove an air pump which pressurized the fuel tank. The later Gnome 9N engines had dual ignition systems for safety, with twin spark plugs per cylinder which were electrically wired, with the wires routed onto the crankcase and a central pair of magnetos driven by the spinning engine crankcase. Control Monosoupapes therefore had a single petrol regulating control used for a limited degree of speed regulation. In early examples, engine speed could be controlled by varying the opening time and extent of the exhaust valves using levers acting on the valve tappet rollers, but this was later abandoned due to causing burning of the valves.[2] Instead, a blip switch was used, which cut out the ignition when pressed. This was used sparingly to avoid fouling the spark plugs, since it was only safe to be used when the fuel supply was also cut. Some later Monosoupapes were fitted with a selector switch which allowed the pilot to cut out three or six cylinders instead of all nine when hitting the blip switch, so that each cylinder fired only once per three engine revolutions but the engine remained in balance. Lubrication The Sopwith Tabloid reproduction shows the sheet-metal cowling used to redirect the oil sprayed by the rotating engine. The lubrication system, as with all rotary engines, was a total-loss type in which castor oil was pumped into the fuel‚Äìair mix. Castor oil was used because it did not readily dissolve into the fuel, and because it offered lubrication qualities superior to other available oils. Over two gallons of castor oil were sprayed into the air during each hour of engine operation. This explains why most rotaries were fitted with cowls, with the lowermost quarter omitted to direct the spray of castor oil away from the pilot.Gnome Monosoupape Type N Rotary Retrieved on 18 February 2009. Unburnt castor oil from the engine had a laxative effect on the pilot if ingested. Because the entire engine rotated, it had to be precisely balanced, requiring precision machining of all parts. As a result, Monosoupapes were extremely expensive to build, the models costing $4,000 in 1916 (approx. $89,000 in 2017 dollars). However, they used less lubricating oil and weighed slightly less than the earlier two-valve engines. Variants ;Gnome Monosoupape 7 Type A :(1916) seven-cylinder rotary engine, .

The Press strove to create a rivalry with the Village Voice. Press editors claimed to have tried to hire away writer Nat Hentoff from the Voice.New York Press - THE EDITORS - Resolutions for the Unresolved Liz Trotta of The Washington Post compared the rivalry to a similar sniping between certain publications in the eighteenth-century British press, such as the Analytical Review and its self-styled nemesis, the Anti-Jacobin Review. The founder, Russ Smith, was a conservative who wrote a long column called \\"Mugger\\" in every issue, but did not promote just a right-wing viewpoint in the publication. The paper's weekly circulation in 2006 topped 100,000,New York Press  Association of Alternative Newsweeklies compared to about 250,000 for the Village Voice,The Village Voice  Association of Alternative Newsweeklies but this total fell to 20,000 by the end of the paper's run. The Press touted a Manhattan-focused, controlled distribution system while a good portion of the Village Voices circulation is outside the NYC metro area. The print edition of New York Press was discontinued on September 1, 2011; its online edition was an aggregate of Manhattan Media's other publications. The print edition of Our Town Downtown was resumed in its place, after merging with New York Press.\\"New York Press Is Dead, Long Live Our Town Downtown\\", Kat Stoeffel, The Observer, 18 October 2011. NYPress.com is currently owned by Straus News. Independent weekly (1988‚Äì2002) The paper was founded by Russ Smith, who published it until he sold it in late 2002. Smith was assisted throughout this period by John Strausbaugh. Smith wrote a column starting with the first issue, which was published under the pseudonym \\"MUGGER\\"; it mostly focused on media coverage of politics, as well as restaurant reviews and personal anecdotes. At some point Smith began running the column under his own name, though still titled \\"Mugger\\"; it ran in the New York Press until 2009. During Smith's editorship, the Press ran regular columns by the radical Alexander Cockburn, the conservative Taki Theodoracopoulos, Christopher Caldwell, future Weekly Standard editor; Soul Coughing lead singer Mike Doughty (both under his own name and under the pseudonym \\"Dirty Sanchez\\"); Adam Mazmanian, Todd Seavey, Paul Lukas, occultist Alan Cabal, Mistress Ruby, J. R. Taylor, Zach Parsi, CJ Sullivan, Dave Lindsay, Spike Vrusho, Ned Vizzini, and Daniel Radosh. Many New York Press writers and editorial staff from this time have advanced in their careers: examples include the author and screenwriter William Monahan, author Dave Eggers; David Skinner, editor of the Weekly Standard and Humanities magazine; author and raconteur Toby Young; Amy Sohn, New York magazine contributing editor and author; author Jonathan Ames; theater critic Jonathan Kalb (two- time winner of the George Jean Nathan Award for Dramatic Criticism);, author Ben Greenman; faux-memoirist \\"JT LeRoy\\"; Scott McConnell, American Conservative magazine editor; writer Kevin R. Kosar, Sam Sifton, New York Times editor; David Corn, novelist and Mother Jones Washington Bureau Chief. The City Sun film critic Armond White joined the staff in 1997 and wrote until 2011. Following the convention established by earlier NY underground papers like East Village Other, New York Press also regularly published cutting-edge comic art, including early work by founding art director Michael Gentile, Kaz, Ben Katchor, Debbie Drechsler, Charles Burns, Mark Beyer, Mark Newgarden, Ward Sutton, M. Wartella, Gary Panter, Danny Hellman, Tony Millionaire, Ariel Bordeaux and others. Ballpoint pen artist Lennie Mace was also among the regular contributing illustrators. Post-acquisition (2003‚Äì2013) Smith sold the paper in late 2002 to investment group Avalon Equity Partners for around US$3 million. Publishers Chuck Colletti and Doug Meadow became the president and C.O.O., respectively. Immediately after the sale, Strausbaugh was fired. After an interim editor declined to stay on, Jeff Koyen was hired away from The Prague Pill. From 2003 to 2005, as editor-in-chief, Koyen continued publishing approximately 100 pages each week. From 2007 onward, the Press ran at less than 40 pages each week. From April 2003 to July 2004, the Press had a sister publication, New York Sports Express, that was a free weekly devoted to sports. The publishers discontinued it. New York Press attracted strong criticism in March 2005 for a cover story entitled \\"The 52 Funniest Things About the Upcoming Death of the Pope,\\" written by Matt Taibbi.New York Press - MATT TAIBBI - The 52 Funniest Things About The Upcoming Death of The Pope The cover prompted outraged comments from a variety of New York politicians. Within a few weeks editor Jeff Koyen resigned due to the uproar. He was replaced by \\"interim editor\\" Alexander Zaitchik. During Koyen's and Zaitchik's editorship, the paper ran regular columns by Paul Krassner, Michelangelo Signorile, and Matt Taibbi. Many of the writers from this time period, including Zaitchik, went on to work at The eXile. Harry Siegel became the paper's editor in August 2005, bringing along with him three editors and writers (Tim Marchman, Jonathan Leaf and Azi Paybarah). He directed the Press to a greater focus on local politics. In February 2006 all four men resigned from the paper, after the publisher rejected a planned cover story that would have shown the Jyllands-Posten Muhammad cartoons from the controversy in Denmark. Siegel was replaced for a short time by Steve Weinstein, former editor of the New York Blade. In 2006, Adario Strange, former editor of The Source, became the new editor. A year later, in 2007, Strange left the paper to return to film directing. After being promoted to publisher, Nick Thomas named Jerry Portwood, former arts and entertainment editor, as editor of the Press. On July 31, 2007, the paper was acquired by Manhattan Media, the owner of Avenue magazine and a small stable of New York community weekly newspapers. One of those weeklies, Our Town Downtown, was initially merged with the New York Press. It was revived independently as the Press replacement in August 2011. In September 2007, David Blum was named editor-in-chief of the New York Press. A former contributing editor of New York magazine and Esquire, Blum had previously been editor-in-chief of the Village Voice. In June 2008, Blum left the New York Press to assume another the editorship of 02138, a new Manhattan Media acquisition. Blum was replaced by Jerry Portwood. From 2005 to 2007, the Press ran regular columns by Amy Goodman and Ed Koch (former Mayor of New York City), among others. In 2013, Manhattan Media sold its Our Town downtown and NYPress.com to Straus News.Isis Venture Partners sells Manhattan Newspaper Group to Straus News Other contributors Matt Taibbi was a contributor in the early 2000s until August 2005.

A member of the Dutch noble Verschuer family, his title Freiherr is often translated as baron. He was regarded as a pioneer in the twin methodology of genetics research and in the study of the inheritance of diseases and anomalies.Bj√∂rn M. Felder, Paul J.

He successfully redefined himself as a geneticist in the postwar era. During the 1950s and 1960s, he was known for research on the effects of nuclear radiation on humans and for his warnings against the possibility of creating \\"scientifically improved\\" human beings offered by genetic science. Verschuer was the director of the Institute for Genetic Biology and Racial Hygiene from 1935 to 1942 and director of the Kaiser Wilhelm Institute of Anthropology, Human Heredity, and Eugenics from 1942 to 1948. From 1951 to 1965, he was Professor of Human Genetics at the University of M√ºnster, where he also served as Dean of the Faculty of Medicine. At M√ºnster, he established one of the largest centers of genetics research in West Germany, and remained one of the world's most prominent genetics researchers until his death. He became Professor Emeritus in 1965; he received numerous memberships in learned societies. In 1952 he was elected President of the German Anthropological Association. His son Helmut von Verschuer was a high-ranking official of the European Commission. Family Otmar von Verschuer was born into a noble family originally from Gelderland, Netherlands; the Verschuer family remains prominent in the Netherlands, where it is known as van Verschuer. From birth he held the title of Freiherr (baron), a title that had been granted to several family branches by the Holy Roman Emperor, the Dutch king, and the elector of Hesse. He was mainly of Dutch, German, Estonian/Baltic German, and Swedish descent, and had distant Scottish ancestry. His father Hans von Verschuer was a businessman who owned a mining company, while his mother Charlotte n√©e von Arnold was originally from Estonia; her family was ennobled in Russia in the mid-19th century and was partially resident in Sweden. He was a descendant of the House of Stuart through his 6th great grandmother Brita Stuart, a Swedish noblewoman of Scottish royal descent.Niclas von Rothstein (2014), \\"von Arnold.\\" Ointroducerad adel 2015 : kalender √∂ver Ointroducerad adels f√∂rening, Otmar von Verschuer was the father of Helmut Freiherr von Verschuer (also known as Helmut van Verschuer), a high-ranking official of the European Commission, and the grandfather of the Belgian-German actor, Leopold Freiherr von Verschuer (born 1961 in Brussels).Hans W. Geissend√∂rfer, Ediths Tagebuch: Erinnerungen, Essays, Personen-Beschreibungen, p. 115, 1983 Early career Verschuer served in the First World War and had been promoted to first lieutenant by 1918. From 1919, he studied medicine at the University of Marburg. He earned a doctorate in medicine at LMU in 1923 and a habilitation at the University of T√ºbingen in 1927. In 1927, he became head of department for human genetics at the Kaiser Wilhelm Institute of Anthropology, Human Heredity, and Eugenics.  Nazi era  Richard Baer, Josef Mengele and Rudolf H√∂ss at Auschwitz, 1944. H√∂cker Album In 1935, Verschuer became a member of the congregation of the anti-Nazi pastor Otto Fricke, a leading member of the Confessing Church. He also maintained a close friendship with his relative, Adam von Trott zu Solz, a leading resistance figure. Despite his proximity to the Confessing Church, he joined the Nazi Party in 1940, although he wasn't actively involved with politics. In the late stages of the Second World War, Verschuer directly or indirectly started to use research material obtained in the Auschwitz concentration camp, mainly through his former student Josef Mengele, who served there as a camp physician.A display of von Verschauer in relation to Mengele appeared during 2011 in the exhibit \\"Deadly Medicine: Creating the Master Race\\" in the Museum of Texas Tech University, Lubbock, Texas. Verschuer was never tried for war crimes despite many indications that he not only was fully cognisant of Mengele's work at Auschwitz, but even encouraged and collaborated with Mengele. In a report to the German Research Council (Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft; DFG) from 1944, Verschuer talked about Mengele's assistance in supplying the KWIfA with some \\"scientific materials\\" from Auschwitz: > My assistant, Dr. Mengele (M.D., Ph.D.) has joined me in this branch of > research. He is presently employed as Hauptsturmf√ºhrer and camp physician in > the concentration camp at Auschwitz. Anthropological investigations on the > most diverse racial groups of this concentration camp are being carried out > with permission of the SS Reichsf√ºhrer [Himmler]; the blood samples are > being sent to my laboratory for analysis. Jewish twins kept alive in Auschwitz for use in Mengele's medical experiments. The Red Army liberated these children in January 1945. Verschuer wrote in the report that the war conditions had made it difficult for the KWIfA to procure \\"twin materials\\" for study, and that Mengele's unique position at Auschwitz offered a special opportunity in this respect. In the summer of 1944, Mengele and his Jewish slave assistant Dr. Mikl√≥s Nyiszli sent other \\"scientific materials\\" to the KWIfA, including the bodies of murdered Gypsies, internal organs of dead children, skeletons of two murdered Jews, and blood samples of twins infected by Mengele with typhus. He was accepted during the war as a member of the American Eugenics Society, a position he kept until his death. Post-war career As the war was drawing to a close in 1945, Verschuer moved the files of the KWIfA into the Western part of Germany, hoping for a more favorable response from the advancing Allied armies than from the advancing Soviet Army. In late 1945 or early 1946, he petitioned the mayor of Frankfurt to allow him to reestablish the KWIfA. However, the commission in charge of rebuilding the Kaiser Wilhelm Gesellschaft decreed that \\"Verschuer should be considered not as a collaborator, but one of the most dangerous Nazi activists of the Third Reich.\\" The KWIfA was not reestablished. In 1951, Verschuer was awarded the prestigious professorship of human genetics at the University of M√ºnster, where he established one of the largest centers of genetics research in West Germany. Like many \\"racial hygienists\\" of the Nazi period, and many American eugenicists, Verschuer was successful in redefining himself as a genetics researcher after the war, and avoided the taint of his work with Nazi eugenics. Many of his wartime students were similarly appointed to top positions in universities of Erlangen, Frankfurt, D√ºsseldorf, and M√ºnster. In his denazification hearing, Verschuer was deemed to be a Nazi fellow traveler (Mitl√§ufer, a relatively mild categorization meaning someone who was neither a supporter or member of the regime nor an active opponent), and fined 600 Reichsmark. He was never prosecuted for his research activities during the war. Leo Alexander who investigated the case concluded that no solid evidence could be found, and considered it likely that Verschuer had destroyed any possibly incriminating material. During the 1950s and 1960s, Verschuer led major research projects on the effects of nuclear radiation on humans. Deeply religious, he also concerned himself with questions of Christian ethics, and argued that eugenics must be based on human dignity and love for mankind; according to historian Sheila F. Weiss he \\"turned his back on\\" Nazi beliefs. In the 1960s he warned against human geneticists trying to create \\"scientifically improved\\" human beings.√úber einen faustischen Pakt Verschuer died in 1969 in an automobile accident.

Thorn. Jade's twin brother is Todd James Rice, a.k.a. Obsidian. Jade is a founding member of Infinity, Inc. She has worked with the Justice League and the Justice Society of America. She is also a member and leader of the Outsiders. After being given a power ring (a spare one), she joined the Green Lantern Corps. The Green Lantern Corps had been resurrected and Jade was the first female Green Lantern from Earth. Jade's romantic interests are Henry \\"Hank\\" King, Jr. and Kyle Rayner. She was ranked 34th in Comics Buyer's Guide's \\"100 Sexiest Women in Comics\\" list.Frankenhoff B. \\"Comics Buyer's Guide Presents: 100 Sexiest Women in Comics.\\" Krause Publications 2011 p28. . Character history The death of Jade. Art by Ivan Reis. Rose, Jade's mother, was married, briefly, to Alan Scott. When she had children by Scott, she gave them up for adoption because she feared she would harm them. Jade and her twin brother were separated. Jade was adopted by a couple living in the suburbs of Milwaukee. Jade learned of her twin brother Todd when she was in her late teens. Shortly after she met Todd, the two siblings tried to join the Justice Society. They were rejected but joined with other children and prot√©g√©s of JSA members to form Infinity Inc. Due to their father's exposure to magical energies, Jade and her brother were born with metahuman powers. Jade's powers first manifested when she was a child when she defended herself against sexual harassment. Jade's powers resembled her father's in that she was able to generate green energy and shape it into constructs. Jade also inherited her mother's power of plant manipulation. Jade made a career in modeling in California then left to pursue photography in New York City. There, her roommate was Kyle Rayner. Jade and Kyle became romantically involved. When Jade lost her powers in a battle with Starheart, Kyle gave her a spare power ring and battery, thus making her a member of the Green Lantern Corps. Kyle later restored her powers during his first, short tenure as the god-like Ion.Green Lantern #148 (May 2002). DC Comics. Jade's power ring eventually passed to John Stewart. After Kyle's friend Terry Berg was attacked, Jade and Kyle left Earth. After completing a number of missions, Jade returned to Earth. She ended her relationship with Kyle after falling in love with another man. Jade then served as a member and leader of the Outsiders. Around this time, Jade assisted Donna Troy and some of the alumni of the Teen Titans in their battle against the Titans of Myth. Jade also assisted the Green Lantern Corps in Green Lantern: Rebirth to defeat and imprison the parasitic fear entity, Parallax. In the Rann-Thanagar War Infinite Crisis Special, Jade died while trying to prevent Alexander Luthor, Jr. from tearing the universe into a multiverse. Her consciousness and powers lingered until her Starheart powers merged with Kyle, awakening the Ion entity, sleeping within him. In the story arc \\"One Year Later\\", Alan Scott lay in a coma after an attack by the Gentleman Ghost. The original Jade appeared to him to say goodbye, granting him another portion of her green energy which replaced his eye that he had lost during the 2005‚Äì2006 \\"Infinite Crisis\\" storyline.JSA #83-85 (May ‚Äì July 2006). DC Comics. \\"Blackest Night\\" Patrick Gleason. During the 2009‚Äì2010 \\"Blackest Night\\" storyline, Jade's remains were reanimated as a member of the Black Lantern Corps.Green Lantern Corps, Vol. 2, #39 (August 2009). DC Comics. Jade, a soulless undead being, used Kyle's affection for her against him. She said his love for her had brought her back. However, Kyle recognized her lies after witnessing the attack of the Black Lantern Corps on the planet Oa. Kyle became enraged and tried to destroy the Black Lantern Corps. Jade captured Kyle and tormented him with black energy constructs of Alexandra DeWitt, Donna Troy, his mother (Moira Rayner), and herself. This was to remind Kyle of his failures to save the women who were important to him.Green Lantern Corps, Vol. 2 #40 (September 2009) DC Comics. The battle between Jade and Kyle was ended by Soranik Natu, who activated Jade's ring.Green Lantern Corps Vol. 2 #41 (October 2009). DC Comics. The Black Lanterns were then given a new directive: to devour Oa's Central Power Battery. Mogo caused all of the Black Lanterns, including Jade, to be pulled down to the planet Oa and absorbed into its core. There, super-hot magma continually burned up the Black Lanterns, preventing them regenerating their forms. Return During the finale of \\"Blackest Night\\", Jade and a few of the Black Lanterns are resurrected in their true forms. Jade and Kyle resumed their relationship.Johns, Geoff (w), Reis, Ivan (p).

Later on, the Justice League found Jade unconscious, held within a green crystal meteor that had crashed in Germany.Justice League of America Vol. 2 #44 (April 2010) DC Comics. The green crystal meteor was the Starheart, the legendary crystal that gave Alan Scott his powers and therefore, Jade, her powers. After waking, Jade revealed that while on Oa, the Starheart had kidnapped her and brought her to Earth in order to locate her father. However, on learning that the Starheart had taken control of her father's body, she opted to help the Justice League to stop him.Justice League of America Vol. 2 #45 (May 2010). DC Comics. Jade joined with the JLA and JSA in order to stop metahumans who were under the control of the Starheart. At the same time, Mr. Terrific searched for a way to weaken the Starheart's power. Jade used her father's old lantern to make a brief connection with her father. The insignia of the Black Lantern Corps was briefly shown, floating behind her.Justice League of America Vol 2. #46, (June 2010) DC Comics. When Jade went to stop her father, she found Kyle, who had been sent by the Guardians of the Universe to kill her father.Justice League of America Vol 2. #47 (July 2010). DC Comics. An Entity of the White Lantern Corps instructed Jade to help her brother Obsidian \\"balance the darkness\\" and save their friends.Brightest Day #7 (August 2010). DC Comics. When Jade tried to rescue Obsidian from the control of the Starheart, Jade and Obsidian were fused together. This fusion made an entity which was also controlled by the Starheart. Jade and Obsidian attacked the Justice League and the Justice Society, until Jade was again contacted by the White Light Entity.Justice Society of America Vol 3. #42 (August 2010). DC Comics. The White Light Entity separated Jade and Obsidian. Obsidian tried to make the fusion occur again but Kyle restrained and removed him. Jade restored her father's Starheart and was reunited with him. As a result of her fusion with Obsidian, Jade was no longer able to be in close proximity to her brother without risking further threat from the Starheart.Justice League of America Vol 2. #48 (August 2010). DC Comics. After this, Jade remained with the Justice League.Justice League of America #60 (August 2011). DC Comics. Following this, Eclipso reawakened and traveled to the Emerald City that Alan Scott established on the moon, stating that he now wished to capture Jade. After taking over Jade, Eclipso has the power of the Starheart and defeats and possesses the Justice League's reserve roster and then badly injures the angel Zauriel. With the Justice League outnumbered, Eclipso then reveals his ultimate goal is to somehow kill God. Eclipso then tortures Zauriel, causing his screams to attract the attention of the new Spectre, Crispus Allen, whom he kills, absorbing the Spectre's powers upon his demise. With his newfound abilities, Eclipso reveals that God relies on the collective love of humanity in order to stay alive and that by destroying the Earth, Eclipso will ultimately kill God once and for all. Just as the members of the JLA prepare to wage a counterattack, Eclipso destroys the moon, apparently dooming all life on Earth. With the moon destroyed, Eclipso then seemingly kills Donna Troy, the physically strongest remaining member of the Justice League. It is ultimately revealed that Donna's death was an illusion conjured by Saint Walker who used his blue power ring to temporarily trap Eclipso in a state of euphoria. After the Atom and Starman break Eclipso's link to his brainwashed slaves, the combined heroes attack Eclipso together, defeating him. In the aftermath it is discovered that Jade and Obsidian can now be within proximity of each other again and their father has control of the Starheart again. After a battle with the villain D'arken and releasing the Starheart energies, Jade's father Alan Scott's body is incinerated. Afterward, there is a funeral for Alan, whom the JSA and Jade believe to be dead.Justice Society of America (vol. 3) #54 (August 2011). DC Comics. As part of the JLA, Jade played a major role in ending the Saturn-Thanagar War by channeling the Starheart's power to magnify the telepathic abilities of the new colonists of Titan to compel the Thanagaran fleet to leave. Jade was removed from continuity with \\"The New 52\\" and \\"DC Rebirth\\" (revealed later was because of Doctor Manhattan altered the timeline that prevented her father from becoming Green Lantern). In the \\"Watchmen\\" sequel \\"Doomsday Clock\\", Jade is among the Justice Society of America members that returns after Doctor Manhattan undoes the experiment that erased the Justice Society of America and the Legion of Super-Heroes.Doomsday Clock #12. DC Comics. Powers and abilities Jade has Starheart energy manipulation powers similar to those of her father. However, unlike her father, her powers do not come from a ring or a lantern but are channeled through the star-shaped birthmark on her palm. As it is with all Green Lanterns, Jade can bring unlimited green energy constructs to life. She can use the constructs in any way, limited only by her will, imagination, and endurance. She uses the constructs most often to create shields, to fly, to travel through outer space and to run very quickly. Jade's power often manifests as green fire. Jade is unable to affect any object made of wood. Jade inherited from her mother the ability to affect plants. Jade can cause accelerated growth of plants and manipulate the movement of most plant life. This ability manifests later in her life and thus she is less familiar with it. Technically speaking, Jade is a meta-human. She was born with green-hued skin, dark green hair, green eyes and a star-shaped birthmark on her palm. Her skin contains chlorophyll (the source of its green hue), and she can photosynthesize sunlight as a plant does. Due to their shared mystical connection with the Starheart, Jade can sense where her twin brother and her father are. She once shared a telepathic connection with her brother. As a member of the Green Lantern Corps, Jade wielded a power ring. Its power is not from the Starheart but from an aspect of the Emotional Spectrum. The power ring gave Jade abilities which were similar to her natural powers. It required recharging every 24 hours by her power battery. Jade's ring has a yellow impurity which required her to face her fears and overcome them with green willpower in order to master it. As a Black Lantern, Jade wielded a black power ring, but as a reanimated corpse she is not in control of her body or powers. Other versions Kingdom Come In Alex Ross' miniseries Kingdom Come, an older Jade has taken the mantle of the Green Lantern. In the end notes of collectors' editions, she is identified as Green Lantern VI. Jade's efforts save her father, herself, and others when the United Nations drops a nuclear bomb during the climactic battle. Tangent Comics In Tangent Comics, the Earth-9 version of Jade is an Asian woman with the power to turn her tattoos into living dragons. 52 In the final issue of 52, a new multiverse is revealed containing 52 parallel identical realities. One is designated \\"Earth-2\\". After Mister Mind eats elements of this reality, it resembles the Pre-Crisis Earth-Two. Although a character who is visually similar to the Jennie-Lynn Hayden incarnation of Jade and JSA members are present, they are not named in the panel in which they appear. In November 2008, the authors disclose that Earth-2's Jade is alive but her father is dead.

This allows her to \\"see\\" via a set of special headphones, as well as granting her the ability to create energy constructs and changing her skin color to green. Though she possesses the green skin of her original counterpart, the Ame-Comi version of Jade uses a power ring rather than an internal source of energy.Ame-Comi Girls #7. DC Comics. Convergence During the DC crossover, Convergence, Jade, reminiscent of her Earth-2 counterpart, and her teammates at Infinity Inc. were trapped on Telos with a variety of other heroes from Earth-2. Depowered, she and her team went on with their lives with Jade returning to her life as an actress. When Telos put the various Earths against each other, Jade once again regained her powers.

Bridget Jones's Diary (1996) and Bridget Jones: The Edge of Reason (1999) were published in 40 countries and sold more than 15 million copies. The two films of the same name achieved international success. In a survey conducted by The Guardian newspaper, Bridget Jones‚Äôs Diary was named as one of the ten novels that best defined the 20th century. Bridget Jones: Mad About the Boy was published in autumn 2013 with record-breaking first-day sales in the UK exceeding 46,000 copies. It occupied the number one spot on The Sunday Times bestseller list for six months. In her review for The New York Times review, Sarah Lyall called the novel \\"sharp and humorous\\" and said that Fielding had \\"allowed her heroine to grow up into someone funnier and more interesting than she was before\\". Late 2016 saw the release of the third movie: Bridget Jones's Baby. On 11 October 2016, and the publication of Fielding's sixth novel, Bridget Jones' Baby: the Diaries based on Fielding's original columns in The Independent newspaper on which the movie ‚Äî which broke UK box office records ‚Äî was based. In a 2004 poll for the BBC, Fielding was named the 29th most influential person in British culture. In December 2016, the BBC's Woman's Hour included Bridget Jones as one of the seven women who had most influenced British female culture over the last seven decades. Biography Fielding grew up in Morley, West Yorkshire, a textile town on the outskirts of Leeds in the north of England. Her father was managing director of a textile factory, next door to the family home, that produced cloth for miners‚Äô donkey jackets. He died in 1982 and her mother, Nellie, still lives in Yorkshire. Fielding attended Wakefield Girls' High School, one of the Grammar Schools in the Wakefield Grammar School Foundation. She has three siblings, Jane, David and Richard. Fielding studied English at St Anne's College, Oxford and was part of the Oxford revue at the 1978 Edinburgh Festival, forming a continuing friendship with a group of comic performers and writers including Richard Curtis and Rowan Atkinson.Jack Boozer (2008) Authorship in film adaptation p.286. University of Texas Press, 2008 Fielding began work at the BBC in 1979 as a regional researcher on the news magazine Nationwide. She progressed to working as a production manager on various children‚Äôs and light entertainment shows. In 1985 Fielding produced a live satellite broadcast from a refugee camp in Eastern Sudan for the launch of Comic Relief. She also wrote and produced documentaries in Africa for the first two Comic Relief fundraising broadcasts. In 1989 she was a researcher for an edition of the Thames TV This Week series \\"Where Hunger is a Weapon\\" about the Southern Sudan rebel war. These experiences formed the basis for her debut novel, Cause Celeb. From 1990 - 1999 she worked as a journalist and columnist on several national newspapers, including The Sunday Times, The Independent and The Telegraph. Her best-known work, Bridget Jones's Diary, began its life as an unattributed column in The Independent in 1995. The success of the column led to four novels and three film adaptations. Fielding was part of the scriptwriting team for all three. Bridget Jones Fielding's first novel, Cause Celeb, whose title derives from the expression cause c√©l√®bre, was published in 1994 to great reviews but limited sales. She was struggling to make ends meet while working on her second novel, a satire about cultural divides in the Caribbean when she was approached by London's The Independent newspaper to write a column as herself about single life in London. Fielding rejected this idea as too embarrassing and exposing and offered instead to create an imaginary, exaggerated, comic character. Writing anonymously, she felt able to be honest about the preoccupations of single women in their thirties. The column quickly acquired a following, her identity was revealed and her publishers asked her to replace her novel about the Caribbean by a novel on Bridget Jones's Diary. The hardback was published in 1996 to good reviews but modest sales. The paperback, published in 1997, went straight to the top of the best-seller chart, stayed there for over six months and went on to become a worldwide best-seller. Fielding continued her columns in The Independent, and then The Daily Telegraph until 1997, publishing a second Bridget novel Bridget Jones: The Edge of Reason in November 1999. The film of Bridget Jones's Diary was released in 2001 and its sequel in 2004. Fielding contributed the further adventures of Bridget Jones for The Independent from 2005. Fielding announced in November 2012 that she was now writing a third instalment in the Bridget Jones series.

The view is from the east looking west as seen from the local mountain Aksla. The bulk of the island Asp√∏ya can be seen in the foreground; the near channel is demarked by the harbor to the right. The fire began on the island, near the last buildings on the island in the upper left. Note that a west wind would push the fire toward the more densely built up areas. The fire was finally controlled at a point to the left, behind the point from which this picture was taken; most of the buildings seen here were destroyed. The √Ölesund fire happened on 23 January 1904 in the Norwegian city of √Ölesund. It destroyed almost the whole city centre, built mostly of wood like the majority of Norwegian towns at the time. The town has since been rebuilt and it is now the administrative centre of √Ölesund Municipality. Fire The fire started around 2 AM on the island of Asp√∏ya, in the Aalesund Preserving Co.‚Äôs factory, which was located where Lower Strand Street 39 (Nedre Strandgate 39) is located today. It is actually stated that the fire started because a cow kicked a torch. In spite of valiant —Ä–æforts at suppression, the wind-driven fire destroyed much of the town. The fire burned to a point just west of what today is called Brusdalshagen, going at least as far as Borgundvegen 39. The last and easternmost house which burned stood where Borgundvegen 37 stands today. In total, the fire destroyed nearly 850 houses, leaving approximately 230 houses remaining within the town borders. There was only one fatality from the fire. Initial alarm At 2:15 AM on Saturday, 23 January 1904, the initial alarm was received from a manual pull station. Shortly afterwards the fire watchtower observed an open fire in the lower part of the road Strandgate. Almost simultaneously another manual pull station signal alarm was received from the Kr√•sbys area. Two fire crews were dispatched immediately. Initial response Although fire crews responded immediately the sky brightened rapidly in the direction of the Aalesund Preserving Co.‚Äôs factory. The weather was unfavorable; a strong gale blew out of the southwest. When the fire engines proceeded through the lower part of the Strandgate to the fire, they encountered heavy smoke and a rain of sparks, such that the horses panicked and had to be blindfolded and led to the fire. When the fire engines arrived on the scene, they found the Aalesund Preserving Co. engulfed in flames and the nearest neighbouring buildings also burning. The two nearest buildings were in flames and before the crew could begin fighting these fires, two more were burning as well. The storm blew so strongly that people had difficulty standing. The draft caused buildings to burn vehemently generating both radiant heat and windblown sparks which spread the fire. Soon a house on the north side of Stradgate was ignited; a ladder was erected and fire hoses were directed at the fire, but the firefighters were ineffective in slowing the rapidly spreading fire. Expansion of the fire At virtually the same time, sparks spread the fire to other houses on the north side of Strandgate. Another fire engine had arrived but the water demand was high and the pressure was so low that the stream could not reach the top of the houses. More houses in the lower part of the street and eastwards to Asp√∏gate began to burn. A steam driven fireboat was brought in service in the harbour near the end of Asp√∏gate.The term gate is a Norwegian suffix meaning street. The translation follows common practice of leaving this suffix, as that‚Äôs how local maps and travel guides display it. The fire now raged over the entire Strandgate and the area had to be evacuated. Prestegate fire line Attempts were made to build a Prestegate fire break by tearing down buildings. Almost immediately thereafter the alarm was raised because the fire had spread to Rasmussen‚Äôs place in the Kirkegate, which lay two blocks further into the city, as well as at the Latin school. Fire fighting on the lower Strandgate could no longer be sustained; the steam driven fireboat had to fall back to a new line on the Langeberggate. There it came into action and was able to power four strong fire suppression steams. Langeberggate fire line Meanwhile, fires had broken out on Tellesb√∏eg√•rd in the Langeberggate. The blocks around the Prestegate were given up as lost. The fire chief chose to concentrate his forces on holding the line at Murg√•rd. With the combined efforts of the fire engines and fireboat, the fires in the Tellesb√∏eg√•rd, the Latin school and Rasmussen‚Äôs place were extinguished (at least temporarily). But the wind continued strong, lofting sparks and embers, so that the fire line was jumped and houses along the Prestegate began to burn. The heat grew so oppressive that the firemen were forced to retreat or risk their lives. Shortly thereafter R√∏nneberg & S√∏nners pakhus in the Notenesgate, which lay about away on the other side of the Brosund (open water), was reported to be burning. Fire also recommenced at the Tellesb√∏eg√•rd, at the Latin school and in a house in √òvregate as well as on the roof at Murg√•rd. The fire line on Prestegate had to be abandoned and the fire boat again relocated. Almost immediately, fire was reported at H.W. Friis‚Äôs sj√∏pakhus in Verpingsvik which lies about away. Hellegate fire line Although the fire fighters were reinforced by additional help, as the fire spread, manpower was lost since those who arrived first to fight the fire feared for their families safety. Some left the lines to assure their relatives were safely evacuated. The fire lines grew longer and longer, with manpower spread more and more thinly. An attempt was made to fall back and create a new fire line to halt the fire at Hellegate street. The fire boat was directed to Apotekerbrygg and the fire forces were concentrated there. But before they could begin activity establishing the fire line there, the roofs of houses on the east side of Hellegate caught fire. Further, the crews dispatched to R√∏nneberg‚Äôs warehouse were unsuccessful in extinguishing that fire. It became clear the outer town was lost. The fire chief chose to halt the fire with the natural water gap fire line of the Brosund combined with suppression of the R√∏nneberg‚Äôs warehouse fire. Brosund fire line The wind, which had initially blown out of the southwest, was westerly at day break and continued to shift until it blew without abating out of the northwest. This distributed sparks and embers over larger and larger areas and the fire spread with increasing celerity. Evacuation The fire started late and spread quickly, leading to a hurried evacuation of people at very short notice into the cold January night. As the fire spread it became clear there was little local shelter to be had and the population of over 10,000 was forced to seek shelter elsewhere. A fortunate few were able to flee by boat. The old and the sick were loaded on wagons and carts, but most fled on foot with only what they could carry. Most fled along Volsdalsvegen (today named Borgundvegen), proceeding to Volsdalen and N√∏rve. Others took the path on the north side of Aksla, which also led to safety Volsdalen. The regional governor Alexander Kielland, reported that over two hundred people spent the night after the fire in Borgund Church. Only one person was known to die. That was an old lady who went back into her house to get her purse. Reconstruction Liberal aid was provided to √Ölesund both from within Norway and from abroad. Kaiser Wilhelm II had been a frequent visitor to the area and expressed a personal concern for the plight of the population. As a result, much of the international help was from Germany, sent in Kaiser Wilhelm‚Äôs name. His first telegram was received while the fire was still being extinguished. He dispatched four ships loaded with personnel, food, medicine, materials for shelters, and equipment. The town was rebuilt in the then contemporary Jugendstil (Art Nouveau). Modern historians have concluded that the fire was actually positive in terms of city development. The pre-fire city centre was extremely crowded, consisting mostly of old and cramped wood housing with only rudimentary sanitary facilities.

His colleague Frank Gardner, who was also shot, survived the terrorist attack but was left paralysed. Personal life Simon Cumbers was the son of Robert (Bob) and Bronagh (Brona) Cumbers. The couple raised their two boys Simon and Stephen and two girls Eimear and Catraoine in Navan, County Meath, Ireland. Simon Cumbers was educated at St. Patrick's Classical School. Cumbers married Louise Bevan, a journalist for BBC News 24 and Radio 5 Live. Cumbers was 36 years old at the time of his murder and he was buried at Redwood Cemetery, Greystones, County Wicklow, Ireland. Career While a student at St Patrick's, he was editor of the school magazine, Tuairim; features writer for Drogheda Independent, Ipswich Evening and Meath Chronicle; and hosted a radio show for Royal County Radio, a local pirate radio station. He started reporting for The Weekender. Around the age of 20, he started as a rookie and advanced to chief reporter for Capitol Radio (now called FM104) in Dublin, Ireland. In 1990, Cumbers moved to the United Kingdom to work with a variety of British broadcasters, including ITN's Channel 4 News, Channel 4 Daily, Sky News, APTN, and the BBC. Cumbers worked both as a journalist and a producer. In the late 1990s, he retrained and became a cameraman as well, establishing Locum Productions with his wife and BBC journalist Louise Bevan, to supply camera crews to broadcasters. Among the stories Cumbers reported on were the 1989 death of Nicolae Ceau»ôescu during the Romanian Revolution; the 1990 release of Brian Keenan in Beirut, Lebanon; the late 1990s Drumcree conflict; the Good Friday Agreement and Omagh bombing in 1998, the Kursk submarine disaster in 2000, and the 2004 Madrid train bombings. He had also interviewed Muammar Gaddafi in Libya.  Death  Journalist Frank Gardner and cameraman Simon Cumbers were assigned to report on the aftermath of the May 2004 Yanbu attack and Khobar massacre terrorist attacks in Saudi Arabia, both of which had British casualties. The British Foreign Office had restricted nonessential travel there. On Sunday morning, the team arrived in the As-Suwaidi neighbourhood of Riyadh, an ultraconservative area where Al-Qaeda was known to have a presence. The team was in place reporting between 10 and 30 minutes and a man, later identified as Adel al-Dhubaiti, greeted the journalists and then opened fire on them. This was followed by shooting from five others who were waiting inside a van. Cumbers was killed at the scene, while Gardner attempted escape but was seriously injured. Cumbers' killer was later sentenced to death. Cumbers' death was considered a murder in the UK. In Saudi Arabia, Adel al-Dhubaiti was arrested in 2004; tried, found guilty, and sentenced to death in November 2014, and executed 2 January 2016. Cumbers' parents spoke out against his execution. Frank Gardner wrote a book, Blood and Sand, published in 2010, about his reporting in Saudi Arabia and the attack on him and Cumbers.  Context  A week before Gardner and Cumbers reported from Saudi Arabia, twenty-two foreigners were taken hostage and killed by a faction of Al-Qaeda during a shooting rampage, known as the Khobar massacre, in an eastern oil hub. The attack was an attempt by Islamic radicals to try to drive out foreigners. This act of violence made oil prices increase rapidly. The leader of the attack was Abdel Aziz al-Muqrin. Later in the same month that Cumbers was killed, US citizen Paul M. Johnson Jr was beheaded in Saudi Arabia.  Impact  A year after Cumbers' death, Irish Aid established the Simon Cumbers Media Fund in honour of his memory. The fund's aim is to help, assist, and promote better quality media coverage of issues in the Irish media. Cumbers was one of the 48 British and Irish journalists who were killed while reporting abroad between 2001 and 2010.  Reactions  Ko√Øchiro Matsuura, the director-general of UNESCO, condemned the attack. His statement said, \\"I condemn this attack which targeted two media professionals carrying out their professional work, and who were investigating the ruthless al-Qaeda terrorist network. It is no coincidence that the enemies of freedom and democracy attack media professionals whose work upholds the values of freedom, enshrined in the United Nations Charter, and of freedom of expression, guaranteed by the Universal Declaration of Human Rights.\\" UK Prime Minister Tony Blair said, \\"We have to be vigilant and get out and get after them and make sure we deal with this (terrorism) issue.\\" A spokesperson for the Committee to Protect Journalists said, \\"We deplore this deadly attack on our colleagues and call on Saudi authorities to apprehend the perpetrators and bring them to justice in a timely manner.\\" Stewart Purvis, a former chief executive of ITN, said, \\"These are tragic circumstances and they are very dangerous for any media presence in Saudi Arabia.\\" See also * Terrorism in Saudi Arabia  References   External links  *Simon Cumbers Media Fund *Locum Productions 1968 births 2004 deaths Assassinated Irish journalists BBC newsreaders and journalists FM104 presenters People educated at St Patrick's Classical School Terrorism deaths in Saudi Arabia Terrorist incidents in Asia in 2004 2000s murders in Saudi Arabia 2004 crimes in Saudi Arabia 2004 murders in Asia Terrorist incidents in Saudi Arabia in the 2000s ","title":"Simon Cumbers"},{"id":"717591","text":"In economics, nominal value is measured in terms of money, whereas real value is measured against goods or services. A real value is one which has been adjusted for inflation, enabling comparison of quantities as if the prices of goods had not changed on average. Changes in value in real terms therefore exclude the effect of inflation. In contrast with a real value, a nominal value has not been adjusted for inflation, and so changes in nominal value reflect at least in part the effect of inflation. Commodity bundles, price indices and inflation A commodity bundle is a sample of goods, which is used to represent the sum total of goods across the economy to which the goods belong, for the purpose of comparison across different times (or locations). At a single point of time, a commodity bundle consists of a list of goods, and each good in the list has a market price and a quantity. The market value of the good is the market price times the quantity at that point of time. The nominal value of the commodity bundle at a point of time is the total market value of the commodity bundle, depending on the market price, and the quantity, of each good in the commodity bundle which are current at the time. A price index is the relative price of a commodity bundle. A price index can be measured over time, or at different locations or markets. If it is measured over time, it is a series of values P_t over time t. A time series price index is calculated relative to a base or reference date. P_0 is the value of the index at the base date. For example, if the base date is (the end of) 1992, P_0 is the value of the index at (the end of) 1992. The price index is typically normalized to start at 100 at the base date, so P_0 is set to 100. The length of time between each value of t and the next one, is normally constant regular time interval, such as a calendar year. P_t is the value of the price index at time t after the base date. P_t equals 100 times the value of the commodity bundle at time t, divided by the value of the commodity bundle at the base date. If the price of the commodity bundle has increased by one percent over the first period after the base date, then P1 = 101. The inflation rate i_t between time t-1 and time t is the change in the price index divided by the price index value at time t-1: i_t = \\\\frac{P_t- P_{t-1}}{P_{t-1}} := \\\\frac{P_t}{P_{t-1}} - 1 expressed as a percentage. Real value The nominal value of a commodity bundle tends to change over time. In contrast, by definition, the real value of the commodity bundle in aggregate remains the same over time. The real values of individual goods or commodities may rise or fall against each other, in relative terms, but a representative commodity bundle as a whole retains its real value as a constant from one period to the next. Real values can for example be expressed in constant 1992 dollars, with the price level fixed 100 at the base date. Comparison of real and nominal gas prices 1996 to 2016, illustrating the formula for conversion. Here the base year is 2016. The price index is applied to adjust the nominal value Q of a quantity, such as wages or total production, to obtain its real value. The real value is the value expressed in terms of purchasing power in the base year. The index price divided by its base-year value P_t / P_0 gives the growth factor of the price index. Real values can be found by dividing the nominal value by the growth factor of a price index. Using the price index growth factor as a divisor for converting a nominal value into a real value, the real value at time t relative to the base date is: :\\\\frac{P_0 \\\\cdot Q_t}{P_t} Real growth rate The real growth rate r_t is the change in a nominal quantity Q_t in real terms since the previous date t-1. It measures by how much the buying power of the quantity has changed over a single period. :r_t = \\\\frac{P_0 \\\\cdot Q_t}{P_t} / \\\\frac{P_0 \\\\cdot Q_{t-1}}{P_{t-1}} - 1 ::= \\\\frac{P_{t-1} \\\\cdot Q_t}{P_t \\\\cdot Q_{t-1}} - 1 ::= \\\\frac{Q_t}{Q_{t-1}} / \\\\frac{P_t}{P_{t-1}} - 1 ::= \\\\frac{1 + g_t}{1 + i_t} - 1 where g_t is the nominal growth rate of Q_t, and i_t is the inflation rate. :1 + r_t = \\\\frac{1 + g_t}{1 + i_t} For values of i_t between ‚àí1 and 1 (i.e. ¬±100 percent), we have the Taylor series :(1 + i_t)^{-1} = 1 - i_t + i_t^2 - i_t^3 + ... so :1 + r_t = (1 + g_t)(1 - i_t + i_t^2 - i_t^3 + ...) :::= 1 + g_t - i_t - g_t i_t + i_t^2 + \\\\text {higher order terms.} Hence as a first-order (i.e. linear) approximation, :r_t = g_t - i_t Real wages and real gross domestic products The bundle of goods used to measure the Consumer Price Index (CPI) is applicable to consumers. So for wage earners as consumers, an appropriate way to measure real wages (the buying power of wages) is to divide the nominal wage (after-tax) by the growth factor in the CPI. Gross domestic product (GDP) is a measure of aggregate output. Nominal GDP in a particular period reflects prices which were current at the time, whereas real GDP compensates for inflation. Price indices and the U.S. National Income and Product Accounts are constructed from bundles of commodities and their respective prices. In the case of GDP, a suitable price index is the GDP price index. In the U.S. National Income and Product Accounts, nominal GDP is called GDP in current dollars (that is, in prices current for each designated year), and real GDP is called GDP in [base-year] dollars (that is, in dollars that can purchase the same quantity of commodities as in the base year). Example {style=\\"border:1px solid #999; text-align:leftcenter; margin: auto;\\" cellspacing=\\"20\\" If for years 1 and 2 (possibly a span of 20 years apart), the nominal wage and price level P of goods are respectively :nominal wage rate: $10 in year 1 and $16 in year 2 :price level: 1.00 in year 1 and 1.333 in year 2, then real wages using year 1 as the base year are respectively: :$10 (= $10/1.00) in year 1 and $12 (= $16/1.333) in year 2. The real wage each year measures the buying power of the hourly wage in common terms. In this example, the real wage rate increased by 20 percent, meaning that an hour's wage would buy 20% more goods in year 2 compared with year 1. } Real interest rates As was shown in the section above on the real growth rate, :1 + r_t = \\\\frac{1 + g_t}{1 + i_t} where :r_t is the rate of increase of a quantity in real terms, :g_t is the rate of increase of the same quantity in nominal terms, and :i_t is the rate of inflation, and as a first-order approximation, :r_t = g_t - i_t. In the case where the growing quantity is a financial asset, g_t is a nominal interest rate and r_t is the corresponding real interest rate; the first-order approximation r_t = g_t - i_t is known as the Fisher equation. Looking back into the past, the ex post real interest rate is approximately the historical nominal interest rate minus inflation. Looking forward into the future, the expected real interest rate is approximately the nominal interest rate minus the expected inflation rate. Cross-sectional comparison Not only time-series data, as above, but also cross-section data which depends on prices which may vary geographically for example, can be adjusted in a similar way. For example, the total value of a good produced in a region of a country depends on both the amount and the price. To compare the output of different regions, the nominal output in a region can be adjusted by repricing the goods at common or average prices.

Elaine Lorillard established the festival in 1954, and she and husband Louis Lorillard financed it for many years. They hired George Wein to organize the first festival and bring jazz to Rhode Island. Most of the early festivals were broadcast on Voice of America radio, and many performances were recorded and released as albums. In 1972, the Newport Jazz Festival was moved to New York City. In 1981, it became a two-site festival when it was returned to Newport while continuing in New York. From 1984 to 2008, the festival was known as the JVC Jazz Festival; however, during the economic downturn of 2009, JVC ceased its support of the festival and was replaced by CareFusion. As of 2012, the festival is sponsored by Natixis Global Asset Management . The festival is hosted in Newport at Fort Adams State Park. It is often held in the same month as the Newport Folk Festival. Festival's establishment at Newport 1950s In 1954, the first Newport Jazz Festival (billed as the \\"First Annual American Jazz Festival\\") was held at Newport Casino, in the Bellevue Avenue Historic District of Newport, Rhode Island. It incorporated academic panel discussions and featured live musical performances. The live performances were set outdoors, on a lawn. These performances were given by a number of notable jazz musicians, including Billie Holiday, and were emceed by Stan Kenton. The festival was hailed by major magazines and newspapers, and some 13,000 people attended between the two days. \\"Over 13,000 enthusiastic fans turned out for last year's festival and this year more than 20,000 crowded the three evening concerts held in spacious Freebody Park.\\" In general, the festival was regarded as a major success. Louis Armstrong and producer Willis Conover, Newport Jazz Festival, 1958 In 1955, organizers were planning a second year for the festival but needed to find a new venue. The Newport Casino would not again host the festival since its lawn and other facilities did not stand up well to such a large event. Festival backer Elaine Lorillard, with her husband, purchased \\"Belcourt\\", a large estate which was available locally, in hopes of hosting the festival there. However, the neighborhood disallowed that plan, citing concerns about potential disturbance. Consequently, the workshops and receptions were held at Belcourt, while the music was presented at Freebody Park, an arena for sports near the casino. Some Newport residents were opposed to the festival. Jazz appreciation was not common within the established upper-class community, and the festival brought crowds of younger music fans to Newport. Many attendees were students who, in the absence of sufficient lodging, slept outdoors wherever they could, with or without tents. Newport was at first not accustomed to this. Traffic gridlock and other contention near the downtown venue were legitimate concerns. Moreover, many of the musicians and their fans were African American. Racist attitudes were probably a factor in some residents' opposition to the festival too as it commonly was across the country at that time. Nonetheless, the festival continued annually and increased in popularity, aided in part by 1958 concert footage released as the documentary film Jazz on a Summer's Day the following year. 1960s In 1960, local papers on July 1 noted a string of violent, but minor, incidents in town on the opening Friday. Saturday was much worse, with thousands of people unable to enter the sold-out shows roaming the city streets and battling police. Some 200 people were arrested, a town record. The National Guard was called in. By Sunday word circulated that the Festival would be cancelled. Poet Langston Hughes, on the grounds, wrote an impromptu lyric called \\"Goodbye Newport Blues\\" and bought it to Muddy Waters, who was headlining the Sunday blues presentation. They announced a spontaneous performance of the piece with pianist Otis Spann leading the band. Likewise the Nashville All-Stars retreated to their rented mansion and recorded a live album on its porch, called After the Riot at Newport. On Monday the 4th the last two days of the festival were indeed cancelled. The 1960 event was also notable for the presence of a rival jazz festival that took place at the Cliff Walk Manor Hotel, just a few blocks away. This was organized by musicians Charles Mingus and Max Roach in protest against the festival paying less to jazz innovators, compared to more mainstream performers; the fact that the innovators were mostly black and the mainstream performers mostly white was also an aggravating factor. In 1961, presentation of the official Newport Jazz Festival was disallowed, due to the difficulties associated with the previous year's festival. In its place, another festival, billed as \\"Music at Newport\\", was produced by Sid Bernstein in cooperation with a group of Newport businessmen. That festival included a number of jazz musicians but was financially unsuccessful. Bernstein announced that he would not seek to return to Newport in 1962. In 1962, the Newport Jazz Festival resumed at Freebody Park. Wein did not resurrect the extinct not-for-profit organization which had run the Newport Jazz Festival through 1960; instead, he freshly incorporated the festival as an independent business venture of his own. He was a music festival pioneer and would run many festivals besides the Newport Jazz Festival during his career. The 1964 festival was the last at Freebody Park, since the event had outgrown that venue also. Festival organizers saw a need to move the festival outside of the downtown area, since the festival-caused gridlock there was a contentious point in the community. A suitable site, actually a simple but ample field, which would become known as Festival Field, was identified, and the move was completed for the 1965 festival. Frank Sinatra played the festival that year, and new attendance records were set. Festival Field remained the venue for the jazz festival until 1971. =1969 - experimentation and excess crowds = The festival's 1969 program was an experiment in fusing jazz, soul, and rock music, and their respective audiences. The Thursday evening set featured performances by jazz musicians Sun Ra, Bill Evans, George Benson, Freddie Hubbard, and Anita O'Day, and a jazz jam session hosted by organist Jimmy Smith and featuring, among others, Art Blakey, Hampton Hawes, Sonny Stitt, and Howard McGhee. Friday afternoon featured a rock-oriented bill featuring the jazz-fusion group Blood, Sweat & Tears, eclectic jazz saxophonist Rahsaan Roland Kirk, and the rock acts The Jeff Beck Group, Ten Years After, and Jethro Tull. Saturday's schedule mixed jazz acts, such as Dave Brubeck and Miles Davis, with rock, blues and R&B; artists such as John Mayall, Sly & The Family Stone, Frank Zappa and his band The Mothers of Invention, and O. C. Smith. Sunday's bill featured a morning performance of Brubeck's oratio The Light in the Wilderness, an afternoon set by James Brown, and an evening finale headlined by the British rock band Led Zeppelin, jazz keyboardist Herbie Hancock, blues guitarists B.B King and Johnny Winter, and jazz drummer Buddy Rich and his orchestra. Davis remarked that the various artists involved were highly encouraging to each other and that he enjoyed the festival more than ever before. He also noticed and appreciated the spirited nature of the younger audience. But some clashes did occur. Excess crowds, estimated at 50,000, who had been unable to obtain tickets filled an adjacent hillside, and the weekend was marred by disturbances, including fence crashing and crowd surging, during the most popular performances. Saturday evening's disturbances were particularly significant, prompting producer George Wein, who feared a riot, to announce that the Sunday evening Led Zeppelin appearance was cancelled. That show was allowed to go forward as initially scheduled after much of the overflow crowd had left the city, following the cancellation announcement. 1970s The 1970 festival was three days instead of the usual four with an estimated attendance of 40,400. Promoter George Wein reverted to an all-jazz policy after he stated the previous year had \\"maybe too much rock.\\" On the first day there was a tribute to Louis Armstrong featuring Dizzy Gillespie, Bobby Hackett, Joe Newman, Wild Bill Davison, Jimmy Owns, and Ray Nance. Mahalia Jackson made a rare festival appearance to pay respects to Armstrong. Saturdays performers included Nina Simone and the Herbie Mann Quintet with Ike & Tina Turner closing out the night. The festival concluded on Sunday with performances from Roberta Flack, Gene McDaniels, Buddy Rich and Ella Fitzgerald. For 1971, the festival booked the rock group The Allman Brothers Band alongside an otherwise predominantly jazz and soul-oriented bill that included performances by Aretha Franklin, Ray Charles, Duke Ellington, Roberta Flack, Charles Mingus, Ornette Coleman, Dionne Warwick, Dave Brubeck, King Curtis, Dizzy Gillespie, and Herbie Mann, as well as the jazz-fusion groups Chase, Soft Machine, and Weather Report. Many more fans were drawn than Festival Field could accommodate. On the second night, after the recording of what would become The Dave Brubeck Quartet featuring Gerry Mulligan - The Last Set at Newport, over 12,000 people on the adjacent hillside crashed the fence during Dionne Warwick's performance of \\"What the World Needs Now Is Love\\". The festival was halted after the stage was rushed and equipment destroyed. The festival would not return to Newport in 1972. =Moving to New York City= In 1972, festival producer George Wein transplanted the festival to New York City, calling it the Newport Jazz Festival-New York. An expanded format involved multiple venues, including Yankee Stadium and Radio City Music Hall, and comprised 30 concerts with 62 performers including Dave Brubeck, Ray Charles, Duke Ellington, Roberta Flack, and Dizzy Gillespie. This format continued for the next years, but Wein missed the outdoors of Newport which the venues of New York City failed to duplicate. In 1977, Wein worked with the city of Saratoga Springs, New York, to move the festival to the Saratoga Performing Arts Center during the following year. He established the Newport Jazz Festival-Saratoga and remained in New York City, retaining the Newport Jazz Festival-New York in what amounted to an expansion. The Saratoga addition began a trend of using the \\"Newport Jazz Festival\\" name outside of Newport, as in the Newport Jazz Festival in Madarao, Japan, from 1982 to 2004. During the 1970s, the Newport Jazz Festival pioneered corporate sponsorship of music festivals. Working with Schlitz and KOOL, the festival changed its name based on what company was sponsoring. 1980s =Return to Newport in 1981= In 1981, George Wein brought the Newport Jazz Festival back to Newport, partly to preserve the Newport Jazz Festival legacy and to protect his interest in the Newport Jazz Festival name. Arrangements with the title sponsor of the Newport Jazz Festival-New York had seen that festival promoted as the \\"Kool Jazz Festival\\". The revived festival took place at Fort Adams State Park, where it has remained since. Newport, now quite keen to tourism, was extremely receptive to the resumption of its Newport Jazz Festival. The 1981 bill featured a lineup entirely of jazz performers, including McCoy Tyner, Dexter Gordon, Miles Davis, Dave Brubeck, Dizzy Gillespie, and Art Blakey. The festival was immediately successful upon returning to Newport, although no longer quite the draw it had been in its first years, owing to shifting interests and to the proliferation of competing festivals. Future installments in the 1980s and 1990s also predominantly featured jazz performers, although acts in other genres continued to appear sporadically, including return performances by B.B. King and Ray Charles in 1984, and blues rock guitarist Stevie Ray Vaughan and his band Double Trouble in 1985. In 1988, the festival temporarily moved to the Newport Casino, where the first festival was held in 1954, and featured a lineup that included Tony Bennett, Mel Torm√©, Illinois Jacquet, k.d. lang, Diana Krall, Ray Charles, Harry Connick Jr., and Wynton Marsalis. 1990s The festival continued to take place annually at Fort Adams through the 1990s and 2000s. Along with established jazz performers such as Wynton Marsalis and George Benson, the festival also featured contemporary jazz musicians, as well as appearances from artists who performed other, related genres. These included: Tito Puente and Celia Cruz (1990), Tower of Power (1992), Thomas Chapin (1995), Medeski Martin & Wood (1997), Femi Kuti, Cassandra Wilson, John Zorn, and Maceo Parker (2000), Isaac Hayes (2002), Pat Metheny (2003), and Dr. John (2006). Bassist Christian McBride made his Jazz Festival debut in 1991 as part of the Jazz Futures ensemble of young jazz musicians that also featured Roy Hargrove and Antonio Hart. In 2016, McBride was selected as the festival's artistic director and lineup curator. 2000s In early 2007, Newport Jazz Festival producer George Wein sold his Festival Productions company in a merger with festival producer Shoreline Media. The merger saw the creation of a new company, Festival Network LLC. That company now owns and operates the Newport festival and controls the legacy \\"Newport Jazz Festival\\" brand. Wein continues with the new company in a senior position but has a relaxed role in festival operations. Starting in 2007, the Newport festival began serving beer and wine at Fort Adams State Park. The 2020 festival was cancelled due to the COVID-19 crisis. Booked artists were invited to return in 2021. Notable performances and recordings Two of the most famous performances in the festival's history are Miles Davis' 1955 solo on \\"'Round Midnight\\" and the Duke Ellington Orchestra's lengthy 1956 performance of \\"Diminuendo and Crescendo in Blue\\", featuring a 27-chorus saxophone solo by Paul Gonsalves. A reconstructed Ellington at Newport, from his 1956 performance, was re-issued in 1999. Aside from the actual festival performance of \\"Diminuendo and Crescendo in Blue\\", including the distant-sounding Gonsalves solo, the original album used re-creations, note for note, of some of the set's highlights, which were re-recorded in the studio. The new set restored the original festival performance after a recording from the Voice of America (which broadcast the performance) was discovered and, among other things, the odd timbre of the Gonsalves performance. Gonsalves, it turned out, stepped up to the wrong microphone to play his legendary solo; he stepped up to the VOA's microphone and not the band's. Gonsalves' performance so excited the audience that the festival sponsors feared that the crowd was on the verge of rioting. The 1957 festival was well documented by Verve Records, which released 12 albums of recorded performances. The 1957 performances of Ella Fitzgerald, Billie Holiday, and Carmen McRae were released on the album Ella Fitzgerald and Billie Holiday at Newport (1958). Those by the Gigi Gryce-Donald Byrd Jazz Laboratory and the Cecil Taylor Quartet featuring Steve Lacy were released on At Newport (1958). The performance of Count Basie was issued as Count Basie at Newport in 1958. The notable film 'Jazz on a Summer's Day' was made from footage of the 1958 Newport Jazz Festival featuring such performers as Louis Armstrong, Anita O'Day and Mahilia Jackson. The film and its soundtrack have been widely released on VHS, DVD, Vinyl and CD. Performances at the 1960 festival by Muddy Waters and Nina Simone were released as the albums At Newport 1960 and Nina Simone at Newport (1960). The 1962 Festival is documented in a film released by Storyville Records. Among the performers are Lambert, Hendricks & Bavan, the Oscar Peterson Trio, Roland Kirk, Duke Ellington, and the Count Basie Orchestra featuring Jimmy Rushing, at the closing. DVD. Part of the appearances by John Coltrane and Archie Shepp from the 1965 Festival appeared on the album New Thing at Newport. A set by Herbie Mann featuring Chick Corea, at that same year's festival, was released on the album Standing Ovation at Newport. Mann also released an album, mostly recorded at that performance, titled New Mann at Newport (1967). Albert Ayler's performance at the 1967 festival was released as part of the Holy Ghost: Rare & Unissued Recordings (1962-70) box set (2004). An Ella Fitzgerald performance from Carnegie Hall in July 1973 was documented on the album Newport Jazz Festival: Live at Carnegie Hall (1973).

Pike was the first all-welded submarine. The welded hull allowed Pike to submerge to much greater depths than her predecessors and at the same time provided greater protection against depth-charge attacks. See the link \\"The Saga of the Submarine\\" below. Service history After shakedown in the Atlantic, Pike departed Newport, R.I. on 10 February 1937, and proceeded via the Panama Canal to Naval Station San Diego. In 1937-1938, she participated in maneuvers near Hawaii. Entering Manila Bay on 1 December 1939, she served with Submarine Squadron 5 (SubRon 5) out of Cavite, P.I. Departing on 20 June 1940, she cruised along the coast of China from Shanghai to Tsingtao. Returning to Cavite on 24 August, she voyaged in the Philippines. In response to the Japanese attack upon Pearl Harbor, she put to sea on 8 December, commanded by Lieutenant Commander Willam A. New to guard sea lanes between Manila and Hong Kong. Sailing from Manila, she moored at Port Darwin, Australia, 24 January 1942. On her third war patrol from 5 February-28 March, she detected the enemy off the Alor Islands 20 February and 24 February, and off Lombok Strait on the 28th. On her fourth war patrol, she sailed from Fremantle, Australia on 19 April, and patrolled north of the Palau Islands and off Wake Island, before reaching Honolulu on 25 May. From 30 May ‚Äì 9 June, she patrolled north of Oahu. Overhauled at Mare Island Naval Shipyard, California, she guided bombers to Wake Island in December, and escaped from a severe depth-charging on 14 January 1943 during an attempted attack off Japan. Departing Pearl Harbor on 31 March, she fired torpedoes at targets off Truk from 12‚Äì14 April, and shelled Satawan Island on the 25th. Getting under way from Pearl Harbor on 22 July, Pike sank 2,022-ton Japanese cargo ship Shoju Maru near Marcus Island 5 August. Sailing from Pearl Harbor on 28 September, she arrived at New London, Connecticut, 3 November. During the remainder of World War II, she trained submarine crews at the Naval Submarine Base New London. Decommissioned on 15 November 1945 at Boston, Massachusetts, she became a Naval Reserve training ship at Baltimore, Maryland, in September 1946. Upon completion of this duty, she was stricken from the Naval Vessel Register on 17 February 1956, and sold for scrapping on 14 January 1957 to A. G. Schoonmaker Co., Inc., New York, N.Y. Awards Pike received four battle stars for her World War II service.

It is the ninth largest river in the United States by average discharge volume at its mouth and seventeenth largest by basin drainage area. The river provides the principal drainage for an area of the remote Alaska Interior on the north and west side of the Alaska Range, flowing southwest into Kuskokwim Bay on the Bering Sea. The highest point in its watershed is Mount Russell. Except for its headwaters in the mountains, the river is broad and flat for its entire course, making it a useful transportation route for many types of watercraft, as well as road vehicles during the winter when it is frozen over. It is the longest free flowing river in the United States. Kuskokwim is a loose transliteration of a Yup'ik word. It is a compound word meaning big slow moving thing. The Alaska Natives of Kuskokwim are Yup'ik Eskimo on the lower Kuskokwim, Deg Hit'an Athabaskan on the middle Kuskokwim, Upper Kuskokwim Athabaskan on the upper Kuskokwim, and Koyukon Athabaskan on the North Fork, Lake Minchumina.  Name  The river's name comes from the Yup'ik, kusquqviim, recorded by a Russian sailor in 1826.Bright, p. 243 An obsolete Tanana (Athabaskan) name for the river was Chin-ana. Upper Kuskokwim (Kolchan) is often used to mean the people of the upper parts of the river, while Yup'ik people live along the lower river. Course Yup'ik at Moravian Mission Station at Kuskokwim River in the year 1900 The river is formed by the confluence of East Fork Kuskokwim River and North Fork Kuskokwim River, east of Medfra. From there it flows southwest to Kuskokwim Bay and the Bering Sea. The Kuskokwim is fed by several forks in central and south-central Alaska. The North Fork (250 mi/400 km) rises in the Kuskokwim Mountains approximately 200 miles (320 km) WSW of Fairbanks and flows southwest in a broad valley. The South Fork (200 mi/320 km) rises in the southwestern end of the Alaska Range west of Mount Gerdine and flows north-northwest through the mountains, past Nikolai, receiving other streams that descend from the Alaska Range northwest of Denali. The two forks join near Medfra, and from there the main stem of the Kuskokwim flows southwest, past McGrath, in a remote valley between the Kuskokwim Mountains to the north and the Alaska Range to the south. In southwest Alaska the river emerges from the Kuskokwim Mountains in a vast lake-studded alluvial plain south of the Yukon River, surrounded by vast spruce forests. It passes a series of Yup'ik villages, including Aniak, and approaches within 50 mi (80 km) of the Yukon before diverging southwest. Southwest of Bethel, the largest community on the river, it broadens into a wide marshy delta that enters Kuskokwim Bay approximately 50 mi (80 km) SSW of Bethel. The lower river below Aniak is located within the Yukon Delta National Wildlife Refuge. The river receives the Big River from the south approximately 20 miles (32 km) southwest of Medfra. It receives the Swift, Stony, and Holitna rivers from the south at the southern end of the Kuskokwim Mountains before emerging on the coastal plain. It receives the Aniak River from the south at Aniak. Approximately 20 miles (32 km) upstream from Bethel it receives the Kisaralik and Kwethluk rivers from the south. It receives the Eek River from the east at Eek near its mouth on Kuskokwim Bay.  History  The principal economic activities along the river have historically been fur trapping and fishing. Subsistence fishing for salmon and whitefish provides a staple of the Yup'ik diet along the river. Economic deposits of placer gold were discovered in 1901 near Aniak. Mineral production in the region has mainly been from scattered placer gold deposits that through 2004 had produced a total of 3.5 million troy ounces of gold. The primary route of the Iditarod Trail follows the South Fork Kuskokwim River out of the Alaska Range and crosses the main stem of the river near McGrath.

Voss's comment was originally made on June 21, 2002, during a discussion relating to an article in German net magazine Telepolis; it ended with the statement \\"If you find sarcasm, please reuse it\\" (\\"Wer Sarkasmus findet, der/die m√∂ge ihn bitte weiterverwenden\\"). Voss posted his comment in response to another poster's comment that endorsed the 9/11 attacks. Voss also added a postscript to his comment, in which he remarked that he had added that original poster and another forum user to a blocklist, since he (Voss) ostensibly took their comments at face value and accused them of Volksverhetzung. (The original poster in turn accused Voss of being serious.) Voss was subsequently charged, following an anonymous report to the police; he received a penalty order for an amount of 1500 euros, which he appealed, and was summoned to a court hearing on January 8, 2003, by the M√ºnster county court. Voss was acquitted of the charge of assentingly accepting that an unbiased reader might interpret his statements as an approval of the September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks on the same day (cf. ¬ß140 StGB); during the course of the trial, it was also revealed that his disclaimer of the posting as sarcasm had been left out of the legal documents provided to the prosecutor by law enforcement agencies. The case raised considerable attention in Germany, both for its free-speech implications and its implications regarding the liability of Internet forum providers for statements made by their members. Voss also claimed that Internet service provider T-Online saved his dynamic IP address, which was turned over to law enforcement agencies without a judge's order, for several months in disagreement with German laws (which only allow the saving of IP addresses for as long as is necessary for billing), and initiated legal action in a separate case, which he won on January 25, 2006. On October 26, 2006, the BGH decided to refuse the complaint from T-Online, whereby the judgement from January 25, 2006 became law.

History  Strafgesetzbuch (1914) In Germany the Strafgesetzbuch goes back to the Penal Code of the German Empire passed in the year 1871 on May 15 in Reichstag which was largely identical to the Penal Code of the North German Confederation from 1870. It came into effect on January 1, 1872. This Reichsstrafgesetzbuch (Imperial Criminal Law) was changed many times in the following decades in response not only to changing moral concepts and constitutional provision granted by the Grundgesetz, but also to scientific and technical reforms. Examples of such new crimes are money laundering or computer sabotage. The Penal Code is a codification of criminal law and the pivotal legal text, while supplementary laws contain provisions affecting criminal law, such as definitions of new types of crime and law enforcement action. The StGB constitutes the legal basis of criminal law in Germany. In the wake of the Third Reich a number of prohibiting provisions were included in the Strafgesetzbuch: * Friedensverrat (\\"treason to peace\\"): preparation of a war of aggression (¬ß 80) and incitement to a war of aggression (¬ß 80a) * dissemination of means of propaganda of unconstitutional organizations (¬ß 86) * use of symbols of unconstitutional organizations (¬ß86a) * incitement to hatred against segments of the population (Volksverhetzung) (¬ß130) In 2002 German public prosecutors were empowered to prosecute crimes against humanity, war crimes and genocide internationally under the V√∂lkerstrafgesetzbuch (\\"Code of Crimes against international Law\\"). Another special penal code is the Wehrstrafgesetz to prosecute special crimes within military service such as insubordination (¬ß20 WStG) and desertion (¬ß16 WStG).  Structure  The German Penal Code is divided into two main parts: General Part (Allgemeiner Teil): in which general issues are arranged, for example: * Area of the law's validity * Law-related definitions * Capacity to be adjudged guilty * Perpetration and incitement or accessoryship * Necessary defence * General provisions for punishments (fines and imprisonment) * Statutes of limitations * Attempts Special Part (Besonderer Teil): in which the different criminal offences and their definitions and punishments are listed, for example: * Crimes against the democratic rule of law * Crimes against public order * Crimes against the person of a sexual nature * Crimes against life * Crimes against another person's wealth (for example robbery and theft) Notable sections These sections differ significantly from the criminal codes in other countries, and/or are relevant for topics discussed in other articles. ¬ß 86a: Use of symbols of unconstitutional organisations Outlaws the distribution or public use of symbols of unconstitutional groups, in particular, flags, insignia, uniforms, slogans and forms of greeting. The laws ban most Nazi insignia from any usage for propagating the ideology outside artistic, scientific, research, or opposition uses (swastikas, SS sig runes, Totenkopf, Othala rune, the neo-Nazi version of the Celtic Cross, the swastikas versions of the Iron Cross and Reichsadler, Wolfsangel, the party and Reichkriegsflagge Nazi flags, the Sturmabteilung emblem, the Nazi salute and the greetings \\"Heil Hitler\\" or \\"Sieg Heil\\", are outlawed under the law) it also extends to bans on symbols of the Communist Party of Germany (Hammer and sickle, red star and red flag are under it), ISIS Black Standard, and Kurdish People's Protection Units (YPG) pennant.http://www.iuscomp.org/gla/statutes/StGB.htm#86a This section has been the basis for the confiscation of video games like Wolfenstein 3D or Mortyr and the ban of Nazi symbolism in World War II-related games until August 2018. ¬ß 103: Insulting of organs and representatives of foreign states (repealed) Turkish president Recep Tayyip Erdoƒüan himself made a complaint 2016 against German satirist Jan B√∂hmermann as a private person because of the alleged insulting.Wegen Beleidigung: Erdogan stellt Strafantrag gegen B√∂hmermann, Der Spiegel, in German The Deputy Prime Minister of Turkey, Numan Kurtulmu≈ü, called the poem a \\"serious crime against humanity\\".Palmer macht sich f√ºr Auslieferung B√∂hmermanns stark, Die Welt, in German On 1 June 2017 the German Bundestag decided by a unanimous vote to repeal this section. This decision went into effect on 1 January 2018. ¬ß 130: Sedition  Section 3 outlaws denying the genocide committed under the rule of National Socialism (1933‚Äì1945). Section 4 prohibits glorifying or approving the reign of the Nazis. ¬ß 130: Incitement to hatred  Section 130 makes it a crime to: * incite hatred against segments of the population or call for violent or arbitrary measures against them in a manner capable of disturbing the peace * to insult, maliciously malign, or defame segments of the population in a manner capable of disturbing the peace * disseminate, publicly make accessible, produce, obtain, supply, stock, offer, announce, commend, undertake to import or export, or facilitate such use by another of written materials that assaults the human dignity of others by insulting, maliciously maligning or defaming segments of the population or a previously indicated group * approve of, deny or downplay an act committed under the rule of National Socialism in a manner capable of disturbing the peace ¬ß 131: Representation of violence Outlaws the dissemination or public display of media \\"which describe cruel or otherwise inhuman acts of violence against human or humanoid beings in a manner which expresses a glorification or rendering harmless of such acts of violence or which represents the cruel or inhuman aspects of the event in a manner which injures human dignity\\".StGB ¬ß131 This section was used as the legal basis for confiscating all horror movies and a few video games such as Mortal Kombat, Manhunt, and Condemned. ¬ß 140: Rewarding and approving crimes Outlaws rewarding or approving of crimes \\"publicly, in a meeting or through dissemination of writings [‚Ä¶], and in a manner that is capable of disturbing the public peace\\".StGB ¬ß140 This only applies to crimes where failure to report is an offense (¬ß 138), among them preparation of a war of aggression (¬ß 80), murder, robbery, treason, and counterfeiting money. This section formed the grounds for the lawsuit against Holger Voss. ¬ß 175: Homosexual acts between men (repealed) This section, which was in force in some form or other from 1871 to 1994, criminalized sexual acts between males under circumstances that varied as the law was modified over the years. Acts between consenting adults, if not done in the context of prostitution, were excluded from prosecution in 1969. Until 1969 the section also criminalized sexual acts between humans and animals. No corresponding legislation against lesbian sex acts existed. ¬ß 202c: Preparation of data espionage or data interception Highly controversial, it outlaws the preparation of an act of data espionage (¬ß 202a) or data interception (¬ß 202b) by making, obtaining, selling, distributing (or otherwise committing or making accessible to others) # passwords or security codes to access data, or # computer programs whose purpose is to commit such an act. As the definition of a \\"program with the purpose of committing data espionage or data interception\\" is quite vague, there is a lot of debate how this new prohibition is to be handled in court, since software essential to system or network security might be seen to fall under this act as well. Too extensive an interpretation will surely collide with the freedom of exercise of occupation as well as the right to property (Articles 12 and 14 of the Basic Law). ¬ß 211: Murder (under aggravating circumstances) In German: Mord. The intentional, successful killing of another person, with at least one of the aggravating circumstances mentioned in ¬ß 211 sec.2 fulfilled. Those circumstances concern base motives, criminal aims or cruel ways of committing the crime. An intentional killing that does not qualify for Mord is called Totschlag (¬ß 212). ¬ß 211 is the only crime within the Strafgesetzbuch that carries a mandatory sentence of life imprisonment (a sentence of life without parole is not expressly provided for in German law, but it is possible certain convicts of murder can spend the rest of their lives in prison). ¬ß 218: Abortion Demonstration against an earlier version of ¬ß 218 in G√∂ttingen, 1988 Regulating abortion, in combination with ¬ß218a. Revised several times, with an early 1970s liberalization declared unconstitutional by the courts, and historically very controversial. After a multi-partisan compromise was reached during the early 1990s, it permits abortion during the first trimester, upon condition of mandatory counseling and a waiting period, and in rare exceptional cases afterwards. After this compromise was found, there has been relatively little further controversy about the section. ¬ß 323c: Duty to Rescue This section requires everybody to \\"render assistance during accidents or a common danger or emergency\\" if necessary, as far as can be expected (\\"under the circumstances, particularly if it is possible without substantial danger to himself and without violation of other important duties\\"). Refusing to assist can be punished with up to one year of imprisonment. As a consequence, should an attempt at first aid prove unsuccessful or actually harmful, it will not be prosecuted (Good Samaritan law). Note that while the duty, in itself, only exists so far as one is actually capable of providing aid, having passed a course in first aid is required for a driving license, and thus on this level is expected from all motorised traffic participants.

In Spring 2000, T-Online became the first major ISP in Germany to offer a flat-rate dialup plan for consumers. This was important because local telephone calls in Germany, including dialup access to ISPs, were not offered on a flat price per call (i.e., unlimited) basis. The flat- rate service was also offered to customers with ISDN connections at the same price as for analog service. In Spring 2001, T-Online announced the demise of the flat-rate dialup plan but offered a flat-rate DSL plan in its place. Deutsche Telekom (T-Online) was the monopoly Internet Service Provider (ISP) for the German Internet until its privatization in 1995, and the dominant ISP thereafter.

Overview Heterophenomenology is put forth as the alternative to traditional Cartesian phenomenology, which Dennett calls \\"lone-wolf autophenomenology\\" to emphasize the fact that traditional phenomenology accepts the subject's self-reports as being authoritative. In contrast, heterophenomenology considers the subjects authoritative only about how things seem to them. It does not dismiss the Cartesian first-person perspective, but rather brackets it so that it can be intersubjectively verified by empirical means, allowing it to be submitted as scientific evidence. The method requires a researcher to listen to the subjects and take what they say seriously, but to also look at everything else available to them, including the subject's bodily responses and environment, evidence provided by relevant neurological or psychological studies, the researcher's memories of their own experiences, and any other scientific data that might help to interpret what the subject has reported. Dennett notes this method is actually the normal way that anyone will choose to investigate aspects of the mind. He writes: \\"heterophenomenology is nothing new; it is nothing other than the method that has been used by psychophysicists, cognitive psychologists, clinical neuropsychologists, and just about everybody who has ever purported to study human consciousness in a serious, scientific way\\". The key role of heterophenomenology in Dennett's philosophy of consciousness is that it defines all that can or needs to be known about the mind. For any phenomenological question \\"why do I experience X\\", there is a corresponding heterophenomenological question \\"why does the subject say 'I experience X'\\". To quote Dennett, \\"The total set of details of heterophenomenology, plus all the data we can gather about concurrent events in the brains of subjects and in the surrounding environment, comprise the total data set for a theory of human consciousness. It leaves out no objective phenomena and no subjective phenomena of consciousness.\\"  Critique  This comparisonMax Velmans, Heterophenomenology vs. critical phenomenology ...https://philpapers.org/rec/VELHVC by Max Velmans from PhilPapers broadens attitudes to phenomena and noumena: Abstract... *Following an on-line dialogue with Dennett (Velmans, 2001) this paper examines the similarities and differences between heterophenomenology (HP) and critical phenomenology (CP), two competing accounts of the way that conscious phenomenology should be, and normally is incorporated into psychology and related sciences. Dennett's heterophenomenology includes subjective reports of conscious experiences, but according to Dennett, first person conscious phenomenena in the form of ‚Äúqualia‚Äù such as hardness, redness, itchiness etc. have no real existence. Consequently, subjective reports about such qualia should be understood as prescientific attempts to make sense of brain functioning that can be entirely understood in third person terms. I trace the history of this position in behaviourism (Watson, Skinner and Ryle) and early forms of physicalism and functionalism (Armstrong), and summarise some of the difficulties of this view. Critical phenomenology also includes a conventional, third person, scientific investigation of brain and behaviour that includes subjects‚Äô reports of what they experience. CP is also cautious about the accuracy or completeness of subjective reports. However, unlike HP, CP does not assume that subjects are necessarily deluded about their experiences or doubt that these experiences can have real qualities that can, in principle, be described. Such experienced qualities cannot be exhaustively reduced to third- person accounts of brain and behaviour. CP is also reflexive, in it assumes experimenters to have first-person experiences that they can describe much as their subjects do. And crucially, experimenter's third-person reports of others are based, in the first instance, on their own first-person experiences. CP is commonplace in psychological science, and given that it conforms both to scientific practice and common sense, I argue that there is little to recommend HP other than an attempt to shore up a counterintuitive, reductive philosophy of mind.

It was named after Lech Wa≈Çƒôsa's Solidarity movement in Poland, which was then widely admired in Illinois, which has a very large Polish- American population, especially around Chicago. The party was founded in 1986 by Senator Adlai Stevenson III in reaction to the Democratic Party's nomination of two followers of Lyndon LaRouche in the race for high state offices: Mark Fairchild, who was running for Lieutenant Governor, and Janice Hart, who was running for Illinois Secretary of State. Stevenson, a Democratic candidate for Illinois Governor, did not want to run alongside anybody associated with LaRouche's organization. There are a number of explanations as to how LaRouche's followers became nominees. Some believe that it simply boiled down to the names of the LaRouche candidates, which sounded less \\"ethnic\\" than those of their opponents George E. Sangmeister and Aurelia Pucinski. Hart's victory over Pucinski was likely helped by a voter reaction to Pucinski, whose father, Roman Pucinski, was a prominent opponent of Chicago Mayor Harold Washington. Many criticized the Democrats for their failure to inform voters exactly who the candidates were, which allowed campaigning efforts in rural areas to be very effective. \\"LaRouche Democrats\\" claimed that the Democratic Party, especially Chairman Charles Manatt, was under the influence of the Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev. LaRouche maintained that the population voted for his followers to take the party back from elitist bankers. In any case, most analysts, including Stevenson himself, agreed that the whole ordeal confused voters and helped the Republican Party's James R. Thompson win the election. The \\"Solidarity Democrats\\" and the LaRouche supporters blamed one another for the subsequent years of Republican control in Illinois state government. Stevenson left politics and went on to become an investment banker. The Solidarity Party continued to exist, completely unaffiliated with Stevenson, after the 1986 incident. In the 1987 Chicago mayoral election, Edward Vrdolyak ran for Mayor of Chicago on the Illinois Solidarity Party ticket, which provided the major opposition to incumbent Harold Washington, Chicago's first African-American mayor, losing to Washington by a final tally of 53%-43%. Its continued existence afterward made it an easy target for other small political parties to \\"take over\\" whenever necessary. One such group was the New Alliance Party (NAP), which was largely unknown in Illinois but still managed to run some of its candidates for local offices. The NAP founder Lenora Fulani campaigned as a Solidarity Party presidential candidate in 1988 and 1992, which is interesting because Fulani works closely with Fred Newman, a former affiliate of LaRouche who broke from the National Caucus of Labor Committees to start his own political activities.

She was crowned European Ladies' Rally Champion five times (1958, 1960, 1962, 1964‚Äì65). Her older brother Stirling Moss was a Formula One Grand Prix star during the 1950s. From 1963 until her death in 2008, Swedish rally driver Erik Carlsson was both her driving-partner and her husband. She is the author of a memoir The Story So Far (1967) and, with her husband, co-author of The Art and Technique of Driving (1965). Biography Pat Moss was born in Thames Ditton, Surrey, England, to British race car driver Alfred Moss and Aileen (n√©e Craufurd). She grew up in Bray, Berkshire and was taught to drive at the age of 11 by her brother, Stirling. But she started her sporting career on horseback, becoming well known as a successful show-jumper and member of the British showjumping team. In 1953, aged 18, she started driving in club rallies after being introduced to the sport by boyfriend Ken Gregory, Stirling's manager. In 1954, Moss bought a Triumph TR2 and started rallying more seriously. She asked Standard-Triumph to cover her expenses to drive her TR2 on the 1955 RAC Rally, but they declined. A more astute MG Cars offered Moss expenses and a works MG TF 1500. Thus began a relationship lasting seven years, netting three championships and benefiting the British Motor Corporation with valuable publicity. As a BMC works team driver, Moss had her breakthrough in 1958, when she drove her Morris Minor to 4th place on the RAC Rally. She achieved another 4th place at Belgium's Li√®ge-Rome-Li√®ge Rally in an Austin-Healey 100/6 and won the first of her five European Ladies' Rally Championships. In 1960, Moss took over-all victory at the Li√®ge‚ÄìRome‚ÄìLi√®ge in an Austin-Healey 3000 and went on to finish 2nd at the Coupe des Alpes. In 1961, she finished 2nd at the RAC Rally. In 1962, she was 3rd at the East African Safari Rally in a Saab 96 and, at the RAC, with the Austin-Healey. Her biggest achievement, however, was winning the Netherlands Tulip Rally in a Mini Cooper, which Moss considered \\"twitchy, and pretty unruly on the limit\\". In 1963, Moss joined Ford of Britain and managed a 6th place at the Acropolis Rally in her Lotus-tuned Ford Cortina. On 9 July 1963Mr Saab, The Tale of Erik Carlsson \\"on the roof\\", page 9. she married fellow rally driver Erik Carlsson. Ford tried to sign Erik; instead, in 1964, Moss switched to Saab works team to partner her husband. Together, they competed in 11 international rallies. Her most notable results were 3rd at the Acropolis Rally and 4th at the Li√®ge-Sofia-Li√®ge and the RAC Rally. At the Monte Carlo Rally, she came in 5th in 1964 and 3rd in 1965. In 1968, Moss joined Lancia to drive the new Fulvia. She did not like the car's strong understeer, but nevertheless drove it to 14th place at the Monte Carlo Rally and 2nd place at the Rallye Sanremo, losing to Pauli Toivonen in a Porsche 911. Her other notable results of the season included winning the Sestriere Rally and finishing 8th at the Acropolis and 7th at the Tour de Corse. At the 1969 Monte Carlo Rally, Moss drove her Fulvia to 6th place. In December 1969, Moss and Carlsson had a daughter, Susan. By that time, Moss was becoming less active in rallying; she nevertheless joined Renault Alpine and drove her Alpine A110 to 10th place at the 1972 Monte Carlo Rally before finally retiring in 1974.

A query string is a part of a uniform resource locator (URL) that assigns values to specified parameters. A query string commonly includes fields added to a base URL by a Web browser or other client application, for example as part of an HTML form. A web server can handle a Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) request either by reading a file from its file system based on the URL path or by handling the request using logic that is specific to the type of resource. In cases where special logic is invoked, the query string will be available to that logic for use in its processing, along with the path component of the URL.  Structure  Typical URL containing a query string is as follows: When a server receives a request for such a page, it may run a program, passing the query string, which in this case is, \`name=ferret\` unchanged, to the program. The question mark is used as a separator, and is not part of the query string. Web frameworks may provide methods for parsing multiple parameters in the query string, separated by some delimiter. In the example URL below, multiple query parameters are separated by the ampersand, \\"\`&\`\\": The exact structure of the query string is not standardized. Methods used to parse the query string may differ between websites. A link in a web page may have a URL that contains a query string. HTML defines three ways a user agent can generate the query string: * an HTML form via the element * a server-side image map via the attribute on the element with a construction * an indexed search via the now deprecated element  Web forms  One of the original uses was to contain the content of an HTML form, also known as web form. In particular, when a form containing the fields \`field1\`, \`field2\`, \`field3\` is submitted, the content of the fields is encoded as a query string as follows: * The query string is composed of a series of field-value pairs. * Within each pair, the field name and value are separated by an equals sign, \\"\`=\`\\". * The series of pairs is separated by the ampersand, \\"\`&\`\\" (or semicolon, \\"\`;\`\\" for URLs embedded in HTML and not generated by a . See below). While there is no definitive standard, most web frameworks allow multiple values to be associated with a single field (e.g. \`field1=value1&field1;=value2&field2;=value3\`). For each field of the form, the query string contains a pair \`field=value\`. Web forms may include fields that are not visible to the user; these fields are included in the query string when the form is submitted This convention is a W3C recommendation.Forms in HTML documents. W3.org. Retrieved on 2013-09-08. W3C recommends that all web servers support semicolon separators in addition to ampersand separatorsPerformance, Implementation, and Design Notes. W3.org. Retrieved on 2013-09-08. to allow application/x-www-form-urlencoded query strings in URLs within HTML documents without having to entity escape ampersands. The form content is only encoded in the URL's query string when the form submission method is GET. The same encoding is used by default when the submission method is POST, but the result is submitted as the HTTP request body rather than being included in a modified URL.  Indexed search  Before forms were added to HTML, browsers rendered the element as a single- line text-input control. The text entered into this control was sent to the server as a query string addition to a GET request for the base URL or another URL specified by the attribute. This was intended to allow web servers to use the provided text as query criteria so they could return a list of matching pages. When the text input into the indexed search control is submitted, it is encoded as a query string as follows: * The query string is composed of a series of arguments by parsing the text into words at the spaces. * The series is separated by the plus sign, '\`+\`'. Though the element is deprecated and most browsers no longer support or render it, there are still some vestiges of indexed search in existence. For example, this is the source of the special handling of plus sign, '\`+\`' within browser URL percent encoding (which today, with the deprecation of indexed search, is all but redundant with \`%20\`). Also some web servers supporting CGI (e.g., Apache) will process the query string into command line arguments if it does not contain an equals sign, '\`=\`' (as per section 4.4 of CGI 1.1). Some CGI scripts still depend on and use this historic behavior for URLs embedded in HTML.  URL encoding  Some characters cannot be part of a URL (for example, the space) and some other characters have a special meaning in a URL: for example, the character \`#\` can be used to further specify a subsection (or fragment) of a document. In HTML forms, the character \`=\` is used to separate a name from a value. The URI generic syntax uses URL encoding to deal with this problem, while HTML forms make some additional substitutions rather than applying percent encoding for all such characters. SPACE is encoded as '\`+\`' or \\"\`%20\`\\". HTML 5 specifies the following transformation for submitting HTML forms with the \\"get\\" method to a web server. The following is a brief summary of the algorithm: * Characters that cannot be converted to the correct charset are replaced with HTML numeric character references * SPACE is encoded as '\`+\`' or '\`%20\`' * Letters (\`A\`‚Äì\`Z\` and \`a\`‚Äì\`z\`), numbers (\`0\`‚Äì\`9\`) and the characters '\`~\`','\`-\`','\`.\`' and '\`_\`' are left as-is * \`+\` is encoded by %2B * All other characters are encoded as \`%HH\` hex representation with any non-ASCII characters first encoded as UTF-8 (or other specified encoding) The octet corresponding to the tilde (\\"\`~\`\\") is permitted in query strings by RFC3986 but required to be percent-encoded in HTML forms to \\"\`%7E\`\\". The encoding of SPACE as '\`+\`' and the selection of \\"as-is\\" characters distinguishes this encoding from RFC 3986.  Example  If a form is embedded in an HTML page as follows: and the user inserts the strings ‚Äúthis is a field‚Äù and ‚Äúwas it clear (already)?‚Äù in the two text fields and presses the submit button, the program \`test.cgi\` (the program specified by the \`action\` attribute of the \`form\` element in the above example) will receive the following query string: \`first=this+is+a+field&second=was+it+clear+%28already%29%3F\`. If the form is processed on the server by a CGI script, the script may typically receive the query string as an environment variable named \`QUERY_STRING\`.  Tracking  A program receiving a query string can ignore part or all of it. If the requested URL corresponds to a file and not to a program, the whole query string is ignored. However, regardless of whether the query string is used or not, the whole URL including it is stored in the server log files. These facts allow query strings to be used to track users in a manner similar to that provided by HTTP cookies. For this to work, every time the user downloads a page, a unique identifier must be chosen and added as a query string to the URLs of all links the page contains. As soon as the user follows one of these links, the corresponding URL is requested to the server. This way, the download of this page is linked with the previous one. For example, when a web page containing the following is requested: [see my page!](foo.html) [mine is better](bar.html) a unique string, such as \`e0a72cb2a2c7\` is chosen, and the page is modified as follows: [see my page!](foo.html?e0a72cb2a2c7) [mine is better](bar.html?e0a72cb2a2c7) The addition of the query string does not change the way the page is shown to the user. When the user follows, for example, the first link, the browser requests the page \`foo.html?e0a72cb2a2c7\` to the server, which ignores what follows \`?\` and sends the page \`foo.html\` as expected, adding the query string to its links as well. This way, any subsequent page request from this user will carry the same query string \`e0a72cb2a2c7\`, making it possible to establish that all these pages have been viewed by the same user. Query strings are often used in association with web beacons. The main differences between query strings used for tracking and HTTP cookies are that: # Query strings form part of the URL, and are therefore included if the user saves or sends the URL to another user; cookies can be maintained across browsing sessions, but are not saved or sent with the URL. # If the user arrives at the same web server by two (or more) independent paths, it will be assigned two different query strings, while the stored cookies are the same. # The user can disable cookies, in which case using cookies for tracking does not work. However, using query strings for tracking should work in all situations. # Different query strings passed by different visits to the page will mean that the pages are never served from the browser (or proxy, if present) cache thereby increasing the load on the web server and slowing down the user experience.  Compatibility issues  According to the HTTP specification: > Various ad hoc limitations on request-line length are found in practice. It > is RECOMMENDED that all HTTP senders and recipients support, at a minimum, > request-line lengths of 8000 octets.HTTP/1.1 Message Syntax and Routing. > ietf.org. Retrieved on 2014-07-31. If the URL is too long, the web server fails with the 414 Request-URI Too Long HTTP status code. The common workaround for these problems is to use POST instead of GET and store the parameters in the request body. The length limits on request bodies are typically much higher than those on URL length. For example, the limit on POST size, by default, is 2 MB on IIS 4.0 and 128 KB on IIS 5.0. The limit is configurable on Apache2 using the \`LimitRequestBody\` directive, which specifies the number of bytes from 0 (meaning unlimited) to 2147483647 (2 GB) that are allowed in a request body.core ‚Äì Apache HTTP Server.
